In this study the impact of achenes on polyphenolic compounds, ascorbic acids, 
and antioxidant activities in strawberry purees at production and after storage 
at 6 and 22 degrees C for 8 and 16 weeks was investigated. Strawberry purees 
were made from flesh, berry, and achene-enriched homogenate and contained 0, 
1.2, and 2.9% achenes, respectively. At production, strawberry purees made from 
flesh contained more anthocyanins, p-coumaroyl glycosides, and ascorbic acids, 
whereas increasing achene levels caused increasing levels of ellagic acid 
derivatives, proanthocyanidins, flavonols, total phenolics (TP), and antioxidant 
activities. In addition, the anthocyanins, TP, and ferric reducing ability power 
(FRAP) in purees with more achenes were better retained during storage. Ascorbic 
acids and anthocyanins declined rapidly during storage, whereas other 
polyphenols and antioxidant activities were more stable; that is, the 
contributions from anthocyanins and ascorbic acids to TP and antioxidant 
activities decreased. The findings that achenes contributed significantly to 
polyphenol content and stability of strawberry purees may be interesting in a 
nutritional and, thus, commercial, perspective.

The antioxidant- and flavonoid-rich contents of red wine and green tea are 
reported to offer protection against cancer, cardiovascular disease, and 
diabetes. Some studies, however, show that flavonoids inhibit GLUT1-mediated, 
facilitative glucose transport, raising the possibility that their interaction 
with GLUT1 and subsequent downstream effects on carbohydrate metabolism may also 
impact health. The present study explores the structure-function relationships 
of flavonoid-GLUT1 interactions. We find that low concentrations of flavonoids 
act as cis-allosteric activators of sugar uptake, whereas higher concentrations 
competitively inhibit sugar uptake and noncompetitively inhibit sugar exit. 
Studies with heterologously expressed human GLUT1, -3, or -4 reveal that 
quercetin-GLUT1 and -GLUT4 interactions are stronger than quercetin-GLUT3 
interactions, that epicatechin gallate (ECG) is more selective for GLUT1, and 
that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is less GLUT isoform-selective. Docking 
studies suggest that only one flavonoid can bind to GLUT1 at any instant, but 
sugar transport and ligand-binding studies indicate that human erythrocyte GLUT1 
can bind at least two flavonoid molecules simultaneously. Quercetin and EGCG are 
each characterized by positive, cooperative binding, whereas ECG shows negative 
cooperative binding. These findings support recent studies suggesting that GLUT1 
forms an oligomeric complex of interacting, allosteric, alternating access 
transporters. We discuss how modulation of facilitative glucose transporters 
could contribute to the protective actions of the flavonoids against diabetes 
and Alzheimer's disease.

Wheat grain is recognized as a good source of potentially health-enhancing 
components such as dietary fiber, phenolics, tocopherols, and carotenoids. 
Anthocyanins, another group of bioactive compounds, are found in blue and purple 
wheat grains. In the present study, a blue aleurone spring wheat line ""Purendo 
38"" with relatively high content of total anthocyanins was used to investigate 
the composition and stability of anthocyanins over three crop years. Commercial 
cultivars of purple (Konini) and red (Katepwa) wheats were included in the 
study. Separation of anthocyanins by high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) showed that each wheat had a distinct anthocyanin profile. Four major 
anthocyanins were separated from blue wheat extracts as compared to five 
anthocyanins in purple wheat. Cyanidin 3-glucoside was the predominant 
anthocyanin in purple wheat, whereas it was the second major anthocyanin in blue 
wheat. The predominant anthocyanin in blue wheat, making up approximately 41% of 
the total anthocyanin content, remains to be structurally unidentified. Blue 
wheat anthocyanins were thermally most stable at pH 1. Their degradation was 
slightly lower at pH 3 as compared to pH 5. Increasing the temperature from 65 
to 95 degrees C increased degradation of blue wheat anthocyanins. Addition of 
SO(2) during heating of blue wheat had a stabilizing effect on anthocyanin 
pigments. The optimal SO(2) concentrations were 500-1000 ppm for whole meals and 
1000-3000 ppm for isolated anthocyanins. Further studies are underway to 
identify and verify individual anthocyanins in blue wheat and their potential 
end uses.

Coloured (black, purple, blue, pink, red, and brown) cereal grains have gained 
much attention recently due to attractive nutritional values. A major type of 
pigments responsible for the colours as well as the health benefits of the 
cereals are anthocyanins. Focusing on the recent updates, this review summarises 
the chemical composition of the anthocyanins in diverse cereals including maize, 
rice, wheat, barley, sorghum, millet, and rye. There is a great diversity in 
anthocyanin composition among various cereals. Special cereal genotypes with 
much enhanced anthocyanin content (e.g., endosperm of rice kernels rich in 
anthocyanins) have been developed by genetic means. The coloured cereals as 
potential ingredients for functional food production have been subjected to 
extensive research for health benefits. Both in vitro and in vivo studies on the 
health effects of the anthocyanins from the cereals have been summarised. The 
claimed health benefits include anti-oxidation, anti-cancer, glycemic and 
bodyweight regulation, neuroprotection, retinal protection, hypolipidemia, 
hepatoprotection, and anti-ageing. These health effects suggest potential uses 
of the cereal anthocyanins for positive human nutrition. However, clinical and 
human studies are needed to confirm these claimed health effects.

Monomeric and oligomeric procyanidins present in cocoa liquors and chocolates 
were separated and quantified in four different laboratories using a 
normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with 
fluorescence detection. Procyanidin standards through decamers were obtained by 
extraction from cocoa beans, enrichment by Sephadex LH-20 gel permeation 
chromatography, and final purification by preparative normal-phase HPLC. The 
purity of each oligomeric fraction was assessed using HPLC coupled to mass 
spectrometry. A composite standard was then prepared, and calibration curves 
were generated for each oligomeric class using a quadratic fit of area sum 
versus concentration. Results obtained by each of the laboratories were in close 
agreement, which suggests this method is reliable and reproducible for 
quantification of procyanidins. Furthermore, the procyanidin content of the 
samples was correlated to the antioxidant capacity measured using the ORAC assay 
as an indicator for potential biological activity.

Epidemiologic studies revealed low mortality in hormone-dependent cancer in 
Japanese women and men consuming a traditional diet. We previously found that 
certain diphenolic food components, lignans and isoflavonoids, which are 
converted to biologically active hormone-like substances by intestinal 
microflora, may be cancer-protective agents. Therefore, we studied urinary 
excretion of these compounds (enterolactone, enterodiol, daidzein, equol, and 
O-desmethylangolensin) in 10 women and 9 men in a rural village south of Kyoto, 
Japan. The subjects consumed a typical low-fat diet with much rice and soy 
products, fish, and vegetables. An isotope-dilution gas chromatographic-mass 
spectrometric method was used for the assays. The urinary excretion of lignans 
was low but that of the isoflavonoids was very high. The excretion of 
isoflavonoids correlated with soybean-product intake. The low mortality in 
breast and prostate cancer of Japanese women and men, respectively, may be due 
to the high intake of soybean products.

The health-promoting effects of whole-grain consumption have been attributed in 
part to their unique phytochemical contents and profiles that complement those 
found in fruits and vegetables. Wheat is an important component of the human 
diet; however, little is known about the phytochemical profiles and total 
antioxidant activities of milled fractions of different wheat varieties. The 
objectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of phytochemicals 
(total phenolics, flavonoids, ferulic acid, and carotenoids) and to determine 
hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity in milled fractions (endosperm 
and bran/germ) of three different wheat varieties, two of which were grown in 
two environments. Grain samples of each of the wheat varieties were milled into 
endosperm and bran/germ fractions. Each fraction was extracted and analyzed for 
total phenolics, ferulic acid, flavonoids, carotenoid contents, and hydrophilic 
and lipophilic antioxidant activities. Total phenolic content of bran/germ 
fractions (2867-3120 micromol of gallic acid equiv/100 g) was 15-18-fold higher 
(p < 0.01) than that of respective endosperm fractions. Ferulic acid content 
ranged from 1005 to 1130 micromol/100 g in bran/germ fractions and from 15 to 21 
micromol/100 g in the endosperm fractions. The bran/germ fraction flavonoid 
content was 740-940 micromol of catechin equiv/100 g. On average, bran/germ 
fractions of wheat had 4-fold more lutein, 12-fold more zeaxanthin, and 2-fold 
more beta-cryptoxanthin than the endosperm fractions. Hydrophilic antioxidant 
activity of bran/germ samples (7.1-16.4 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g) was 
13-27-fold higher than that of the respective endosperm samples. Similarly, 
lipophilic antioxidant activity was 28-89-fold higher in the bran/germ fractions 
(1785-4669 nmol of vitamin E equiv/g). Hydrophilic antioxidant activity 
contribution to the total antioxidant activity (hydrophilic + lipophilic) was 
>80%. In whole-wheat flour, the bran/germ fraction contributed 83% of the total 
phenolic content, 79% of the total flavonoid content, 51% of the total lutein, 
78% of the total zeaxanthin, 42% of the total beta-cryptoxanthin, 85% of the 
total hydrophilic antioxidant activity, and 94% of the total lipophilic 
antioxidant activity. Our results showed that different milled fractions of 
wheat have different profiles of both hydrophilic and lipophilic phytochemicals. 
These findings provide information necessary for evaluating contributions to 
good health and disease prevention from whole-wheat consumption.

This study presents the effects of soaking, cooking, and industrial dehydration 
treatments on phenolic profile and also on antioxidant properties in Pardina 
lentil. HPLC-PAC and HPLC-MS (ESI) analysis identified a total of 35 phenolic 
compounds in raw and processed lentil flours, corresponding to catechins and 
procyanidins (69% of the total of identified phenolic compounds), flavonols 
(17%), flavones, and flavanones (5%), and hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic 
compounds (5 and 4%, respectively). During the industrial process, catechins and 
procyanidins, flavonols, flavones, and flavanones decreased, while 
hydroxybenzoic compounds exhibited an important increase. In addition, raw 
lentils showed high values of the antioxidant activity (66.97 μmol Trolox/g); 
although the thermal processing promotes decreased, the levels of antioxidant 
activity were still relevant. Thus, the significant occurrence of bioactive 
phenolic compounds along with the interesting antioxidant capacity of dehydrated 
lentil flours make them useful for daily inclusion in the human diet as 
ready-to-use for special meals to specific populations.

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a lipid food, which constitutes a pillar of the 
Mediterranean diet. A high number of scientific data have demonstrated that it 
exerts a variety of beneficial effects on human health due to its peculiar 
chemical composition including fatty acids (98-99%) and other active compounds 
even if found in a very low percentage (1-2%). Among them, minor polar compounds 
(MCPs), represented mainly by phenolic compounds, are relevant for their healthy 
properties, as stated by the European Food Safety Authority's (EFSA) claims. In 
this paper, we described the results obtained from a pilot in vivo study, 
focused for the first time on the evaluation of the possible beneficial effects 
of two EVOOs on chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients after the consumption of 
40 mL per day for 9 weeks. The selected EVOOs, traced in the production chain, 
and characterized by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC-DAD-MS) 
analysis, resulted rich in MCPs and satisfied the EFSA's claim for their content 
of hydroxytyrosol and derivatives. The results obtained by this in vivo study 
appear to highlight the potential beneficial role in CKD patients of these EVOOs 
and are promising for future studies.

Seeds of African locust bean, melon, castor oil bean and soybean were processed 
and fermented for 3 days to produce local condiments in the laboratory with a 
method that simulated the traditional production process. Microorganisms 
associated with their fermentation and the organoleptic properties of the 
products were compared. Altogether, seven species of bacteria were involved in 
the fermentation. These included five Bacillus spp. and one species each of 
Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus. Their occurrence vary between the seeds on the 
different days of fermentation. However, Bacillus spp. were present in all the 
seeds throughout the fermentation period. The sensory evaluation preference 
rating for the four products was highest for soybean condiment, followed by that 
made from locust bean. Melon condiment was the least preferred among the four 
products. Statistical analysis showed that there were significant differences (P 
less than or equal to 0.05) among the four products for each of the four 
organoleptic properties evaluated by the judges and also for titratable acidity. 
Glutamic acid level of soybean condiment was highest (0.31%) among the four 
products with that of melon being the lowest (0.04%). These results could serve 
as useful indices for the development of starter culture and optimization of 
production process in commercializing the production of these local condiments.

mg/100 g). A significant (p < 0.05) amount of antioxidants and carotenoids was 
lost after sun-drying of dates, whereas the total content of phenolics and free 
and bound phenolic acids increased significantly (p < 0.05). Anthocyanins were 
detected only in fresh dates. Date varieties had different levels and patterns 
of phenolic acids. Four free phenolic acids (protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, 
syringic acid, and ferulic acid) and nine bound phenolic acids (gallic acid, 
protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, 
syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and o-coumaric acid) were 
tentatively identified. Of the date varieties studied, Khalas, which is 
considered to be premium quality, had higher antioxidant activity, total 
carotenoids, and bound phenolic acids than other varieties. These results 
suggest that all date varieties serve as a good source of natural antioxidants 
and could potentially be considered as a functional food or functional food 
ingredient, although some of their antioxidant constituents are lost during 
sun-drying.

Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is a pulse consumed all over the world, 
representing a good source of protein, as well as fat, fiber, and other 
carbohydrates. As a result of the growing global population the demand for the 
protein component of this pulse is increasing and various approaches have been 
proposed and developed to extract same. In this review the composition, 
functionality, and applications of chickpea protein ingredients are described. 
Moreover, methods to enhance protein quality have been identified, as well as 
applications of the coproducts resulting from protein extraction and processing. 
The principal dry and wet protein enrichment approaches, resulting in protein 
concentrates and isolates, include air classification, alkaline/acid extraction, 
salt extraction, isoelectric precipitation, and membrane filtration. Chickpea 
proteins exhibit good functional properties such as solubility, water and oil 
absorption capacity, emulsifying, foaming, and gelling. During protein 
enrichment, the functionality of protein can be enhanced in addition to primary 
processing (e.g., germination and dehulling, fermentation, enzymatic 
treatments). Different applications of chickpea protein ingredients, and their 
coproducts, have been identified in research, highlighting the potential of 
these ingredients for novel product development and improvement of the 
nutritional profile of existing food products. Formulations to meet consumer 
needs in terms of healthy and sustainable foods have been investigated in the 
literature and can be further explored. Future research may be useful to improve 
applications of the specific coproducts that result from the extraction of 
chickpea proteins, thereby leading to more sustainable processes.

Four different colored carrots, orange, purple with orange core, yellow, and 
white, were examined for their content of phenolics, antioxidant vitamins, and 
sugars as well as their volatiles and sensory responses. A total of 35 volatiles 
were identified in all carrots, 27 positively. White carrot contained the 
highest content of volatiles, followed by orange, purple, and yellow. In total, 
11, 16, 10, and 9 phenolic compounds were determined for the first time in 
orange, purple, yellow, and white carrots, respectively. Of these, chlorogenic 
acid was the most predominant phenolic compound in all carrot varieties. 
Differences (p < 0.05) in relative sweetness, the contents of vitamin C and 
alpha- and beta-carotenes, and certain flavor characteristics were observed 
among the colored carrot varieties examined. Purple carrots contained 2.2 and 
2.3 times more alpha- and beta-carotenes (trace in yellow; not detected in 
white) than orange carrots, respectively. Purple carrot may be used in place of 
other carrot varieties to take advantage of its nutraceutical components.

The effect of roasting on taste-active components of 18 native hazelnut 
varieties, grown in the Giresun province of Turkey, was assessed. Samples were 
examined for their sugars, organic acids, condensed tannins, and free phenolic 
acids. Six sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose, myo-inositol, raffinose, and 
stachyose), seven organic acids (oxalic, maleic, citric, malic, lactic, 
succinic, and acetic), and one phenolic acid (gallic acid) were positively 
identified in natural and roasted hazelnut varieties; among these, sucrose, 
malic acid, and gallic acid predominated, respectively. Total sugars among 
hazelnut varieties ranged from 1.99 to 4.94 g/100 g, organic acids from 0.96 to 
2.72 g/100 g, condensed tannins from 3.99 to 40.56 mg of catechin equivalents/g, 
and gallic acid from 0.159 to 0.871 mg/100 g. Differences existed in the sugar 
and organic acid contents between natural and roasted hazelnut varieties, but 
they did not follow any particular trend. Significant losses (p < 0.05) in 
condensed tannins ( approximately 97.3%) and gallic acid ( approximately 66.7%) 
were noted when the hazelnuts were roasted. The present work suggests that 
roasting resulted in significant loss in condensed tannins and gallic acid due 
to the removal of the brown skin. The effect of roasting on sugars and organic 
acids was not noteworthy.

Rice noodles have been manufactured in the food industry using different 
extrusion methods, such as traditional and modern extrusions, which affect the 
noodle structure and qualities. Therefore, the effects of the extrusion process 
on qualities of rice noodles using the same blend of rice flour and crosslinked 
starch were evaluated. In this study, a capillary rheometer was used as an 
alternative approach to simulate the traditional extrusion method in which the 
noodles are obtained by continuously pressing the pregelatinized noodle dough 
through a die. For modern extrusion, a twin-screw extruder was employed to 
obtain the noodles in a one-step process. The optimal range of moisture content 
used in the formulation was studied. Upon cooking, the noodles showed a decrease 
in cooking time and cooking loss with increasing moisture content in the 
formulation. All cooked noodles showed comparable tensile strength, but those 
extruded by a twin-screw extruder had substantially greater elongation. Scanning 
electron micrographs revealed that the noodles prepared using the extruder had a 
denser starch matrix, while those obtained from a capillary rheometer showed the 
aggregation of starch fragments relevant to the existence of starch 
gelatinization endotherm from differential scanning calorimetry. This indicated 
that the extrusion process using the twin-screw extruder provided a more uniform 
starch transformation, i.e., more starch granule disruption and gelatinization, 
thus giving the noodles a more coherent structure and better extensibility after 
cooking. The obtained results suggested that different thermomechanical 
processes used in the noodle industry gave the extruded rice noodles different 
qualities respective to their different microstructures.

An analytical method based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) and followed by 
liquid chromatographic separation and ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) is 
proposed for the determination of 10 phenolic compounds which participate on 
beer stability and sensory properties in alcohol-free beers. Acetonitrile was 
found to be the most appropriate solvent for the elution of polyphenolic 
compounds adsorbed on C18 cartridges. The performance of the method was assessed 
by the evaluation of parameters such as absolute recovery (generally higher than 
60%), repeatability (lower than 10%), linearity (r2 higher than 0.993) and 
limits of quantitation (ranging from 1 to 37 microg/L); no matrix effects were 
observed. The polyphenol content of different Spanish alcohol-free beers is 
presented. Five phenolic compounds such as protocatechuic, p-coumaric, ferulic, 
caffeic acids, and (+)-catechin were identified at levels lower than 10 mg/L.

Polyphenols in the peel and pulp of 15 Basque cider apple varieties were 
determined by accelerated solvent extraction followed by reversed phase 
high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. It was 
observed that the polyphenolic composition in apple peel depended on varieties, 
whereas the main classes of phenolic compounds in apple pulp were flavan-3-ols 
and hydroxycinnamic acids in all cases, representing both together between 86 
and 95% of total polyphenols assayed.

The polyphenolic compositions of 31 Basque cider apple cultivars were determined 
in pulp, peel, and juice by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode 
array detection analysis of crude extracts and after thiolysis. Total 
polyphenols are distributed in a wide concentration range depending on the 
cultivar. Procyanidins are the class of polyphenols that present major 
concentrations in apple. Their average degrees of polymerization range from 4 to 
8 depending on the cultivar. Apple cultivars were technologically classified 
into bitter and nonbitter categories using different classification systems 
obtained by applying several pattern recognition techniques, such as principal 
component analysis, K-nearest neighbors, soft independent modeling of class 
analogy, partial least-squares, and multilayer feed-forward-artificial neural 
networks, to apple pulp, peel, or juice data (individual polyphenol 
concentrations, total procyanidin content, and the average degree of 
polymerization of procyanidins). Bitter apple cultivars present higher contents 
of flavan-3-ols and/or dihydrochalcones than nonbitter cultivars. Detailed 
knowledge of the polyphenolic profile of each apple cultivar affords information 
about their susceptibility to oxidation, their sensory properties (bitterness, 
astringency), and their possible influence on the characteristics and quality of 
the final product (juice, cider) when apples are processed.

Juices prepared from arils of 'Mollar' pomegranates were analysed for naturally 
occurring microorganisms, CIE Lab colour parameters, total phenols, anthocyanins 
and punicalagins, ellagic acid content and antioxidant capacity before and after 
low-, mild- and high-temperature pasteurisations (LTPs, MTPs and HTPs): 65, 80 
and 90 °C for 30 or 60s. Mean aerobic plate count (APC), yeast and mold count 
(YMC), and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) for fresh juices were 5.7, 5.36 and 4.0 
log CFU/mL, respectively. MTPs and HTPs were sufficiently effective to decrease 
APCs to nil or negligible levels. An increase in CIE a values and decrease in 
CIE b values were the characteristic colour changes in heat-treated juices. The 
effect of pasteurisations showed that total phenols, punicalagins and ellagic 
acid were not much affected by thermal processing. Total anthocyanin content and 
antioxidant capacity were substantially and significantly influenced by the heat 
treatment applied. A linear relationship was observed between Trolox equivalent 
antioxidant capacity (TEAC) values and total anthocyanins, suggesting that they 
contributed strongly to the antioxidant capacity of pomegranate juice.

Six selected phenolic aglycons (caffeic and ellagic acids, kaempferol, 
quercetin, myricetin, and morin) in nine types of berries, and their changes as 
influenced by jam processing, have been evaluated using optimized HPLC with 
diode-array detection. The berry samples, fresh and after jam processing, were 
analyzed, and the total amounts of selected phenolics as aglycons were 
identified and determined by acid hydrolysis. Their contents in fresh and jam 
samples did not indicate appreciable changes; therefore, the influence of jam 
processing on these selected phenolics in berries was suggested to be small, and 
was mostly present in berries as several conjugated forms that were 
glycosylated, esterified, etc., in the samples. The total phenolic content of 
each sample was also determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The three samples 
of each berry, namely fresh, jam, and acid hydrolysate of the berry, had similar 
total phenolic contents. On the other hand, the scavenging effect on the 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was measured, and acid hydrolysates 
showed stronger activity than that of the fresh and jam-processed samples for 
all of the berry types.

The effect of hesperidin (Hp) and naringin (Nar), two major citrus flavanones, 
on the regulation of bone metabolism was examined in male senescent rats. Twenty 
-month -old gonad-intact male Wistar rats received a casein-based diet 
supplemented with or without either 0.5% hesperidin (Hp), 0.5% naringin (Nar) or 
a mix of both flavanones (Hp+Nar, 0.25% each). After 3 months, daily Hp intake 
significantly improved femoral bone integrity as reflected by improvements in 
total and regional bone mineral densities (BMD) (9.7%-12.3% improvements, 
p<0.05) and trabecular bone volume fraction (24.3% improvement, p<0.05) at the 
femur compared with control group. In contrast, naringin exerted site-specific 
effects on BMD (10.2% improvement at the distal metaphyseal area, p<0.05) and no 
further benefit to bone mass was observed with the mix of flavanones. Bone 
resorption (DPD) was significantly attenuated by Hp and Nar given alone (40.3% 
and 26.8% lower compared to control, p<0.05, respectively) but not by the 
mixture of the two. All treatments significantly reduced expression of 
inflammatory markers to a similar extent (IL-6, 81.0-87.9% reduction; NO, 
34.7-39.5% reduction) compared to control. Bone formation did not appear to be 
strongly affected by any of the treatments (no effect on osteocalcin levels, 
modest modulation of tibial BMP-2 mRNA). However, as previously reported, plasma 
lipid-lowering effects were observed with Hp and Nar alone (34.1%-45.1% lower 
for total cholesterol and triglycerides compared to control, p<0.05) or together 
(46% lower for triglycerides, p<0.05). Surprisingly the plasma circulating level 
of naringin (8.15μM) was >5-fold higher than that of hesperidin (1.44μM) at 
equivalent doses (0.5%) and a linear reduction in plasma levels was observed 
upon co-administration (0.25% each) indicating absence of competition for their 
intestinal absorption sites and metabolism. The higher efficacy of Hp at a lower 
plasma concentration than naringin, as well as the identification of the major 
circulating metabolite of hesperidin (hesperetin-7-O-glucuronide) underlines the 
importance of flavanone bioavailability and metabolism in their biological 
efficacy and suggests a structure-function relationship in the mechanism of 
action of the active metabolites.

In order to enhance the quality of hot air drying for Tartary buckwheat sprouts 
and minimize the loss of active substances, this research explored the impact of 
Color Protection(CP), Osmosis(OM), Blanching (BC), β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), and 
Ultrasound (US) in conjunction with hot air drying on the color, nutritional 
value, antioxidant properties, and other attributes of Tartary buckwheat 
sprouts. The findings revealed that as the drying temperature increased from 50 
°C to 70 °C, the drying duration for Tartary buckwheat sprouts decreased across 
all treatment groups, leading to a higher dehydration rate. Treatments involving 
CP, US, and BC effectively reduced the drying time of Tartary buckwheat sprouts. 
Sprouts subjected to CP, β-CD, and US treatments exhibited elevated L* values 
and decreased a* values and displayed a more vibrant green color. When exposed 
to a hot air setting of 60 °C, the total flavonoid content in the CP, OM, β-CD, 
and US groups increased by 8.76%, 6.76%, 12.34%, and 4.25%, respectively, 
compared to the Control Group (CK). The application of the CP, OM, β-CD, and US 
treatments enhanced the sprouts' ability to combat ABTS and DPPH free radicals. 
Notably, under hot air conditions of 60 °C, the β-CD treatment demonstrated the 
most effective quality preservation during the hot air drying process for 
sprouts. This study provides valuable insights into the drying behavior of 
Tartary buckwheat sprouts and offers guidance for optimizing the drying 
procedures in industrial settings. Tartary buckwheat sprouts contain a variety 
of polyphenols and have a high water content. The study of changes in active 
components such as polyphenols and their alteration mechanisms in Tartary 
buckwheat sprouts under different processing methods is particularly important 
for the development of sprout processing.

The ellagic acid, total phenolic, and vitamin C contents in four raspberry 
cultivars (Heritage, Autumn Bliss, Rubi, and Zeva) grown in Spain were detected 
and quantified by HPLC in fresh, just frozen, and stored fruits at -20 degrees C 
for a one year period. Ellagic acid [207-244 mg kg(-)(1) of fresh weight (fw)], 
total phenolic (137-1776 mg kg(-)(1) of fw), and vitamin C (221-312 mg kg(-)(1) 
of fw) contents in raw material were higher in the late cultivars Zeva and Rubi 
than in the early cultivars Autumn Bliss and Heritage. The freezing process 
slightly affected the values of extracted ellagic acid, total phenolic, and 
vitamin C content. At the end of long-term frozen storage (12 months), no 
significant change of total phenolic content extracted was observed, but 
significant decreases of 14-21% in ellagic acid and of 33-55% in vitamin C were 
quantified. Free radical scavenging capacity measured as antiradical efficiency 
(AE) depends on the seasonal period of harvest. Late cultivars, Rubi (6.1 x 
10(-)(4)) and Zeva (10.17 x 10(-)(4)), showed higher AE than early cultivars, 
Heritage (4.02 x 10(-)(4)) and Autumn Bliss (4.36 x 10(-)(4)). The freezing 
process produced a decrease of AE values in the four cultivars ranging between 4 
and 26%. During the frozen storage, the AE values reached after the freezing 
process remained unchanged.

The quantitative and qualitative evolution of the anthocyanins and volatile 
compounds of four raspberry cultivars (cvs. Heritage, Autumn Bliss, Zeva, and 
Rubi) growing in Spain were analyzed raw, just frozen, and during long-term 
frozen storage at -20 degrees C for a 1 year period. HS-SPME coupled with GC-MS 
and HPLC techniques were employed to study the evolution of the volatile 
compounds and the individual anthocyanins, respectively. The volatile aroma 
composition changes produced by the freezing process and long-term frozen 
storage were minimal. Only a significant increase in extraction capacity was 
obtained for alpha-ionone (27%) and for caryophyllene (67%) in Heritage at 12 
months of storage. The stability of anthocyanins to freezing and frozen storage 
depends on the seasonal period of harvest. Heritage and Autumn Bliss (early 
cultivars) were less affected by processing and long-term frozen storage (1 
year), and the total pigment extracted showed the tendency to increase 17 and 
5%, respectively. Rubi and Zeva (late cultivars) suffered a decreased trend on 
the total anthocyanin content of 4% for Rubi and 17.5% for Zeva. Cyanidin 
3-glucoside most easily suffered the degradative reactions that take place 
during processing and the storage period.

A number of potential antioxidants have been evaluated for their effect on 
formation of radicals in beer using the electron spin resonance (ESR) lag phase 
method. Sulfite was found to be the only compound that was able to delay the 
formation of radicals, whereas phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids, 
catechin, epicatechin, and proanthocyanidin dimers had no effect on the 
formation of radicals. Ascorbate, cystein, and cysteamin were on the other hand 
found to be prooxidants. It is suggested that antioxidants must be able to 
either scavenge peroxides or trap metal ions in order to be effective in beer. 
The effectiveness of sulfite is suggested to be a consequence of its 
two-electron nonradical producing reaction with peroxides.

Phenolic compounds are secondary plant metabolites which have long been 
associated with flavor and color characteristics of fruits and vegetables. These 
phenolic compounds attract great interest due to their postulated health 
protecting properties. However, adequate intakes and absorption rate of phenolic 
compounds are necessary for these beneficial effects. Until now, little is known 
about alterations of phenolic compounds content by the cooking process. In the 
present study, the influence of different volumes of cooking water on the amount 
of selected phenolic marker compounds resting in the vegetables was assessed. In 
zucchini, rutin was quantified as a marker for flavonoid glycosides. Chlorogenic 
acid, representative of phenolic acids was analyzed in carrots. In beans, rutin 
and quercitrin, both belonging to flavonoid glycosides, were investigated. In 
potatoes, chlorogenic and caffeic acid were determined. The cooking of zucchini, 
beans and carrots with smaller amounts of water resulted in significant higher 
content of phenolic phytochemicals in the vegetables compared to cooking with 
larger water volumes. For potatoes, which showed great variations in content of 
phenolic acids after cooking, no significant differences in phenolic acids was 
observed. It can be concluded from these observations, that real intakes of 
phenolic compounds from cooked vegetables are lower and that the amounts 
consumed are therefore overestimated.

The contents of pnenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers were quantified by 
HPLC analysis after alkaline hydrolysis in kernels of 17 rye (Secale cereale L.) 
varieties grown in one location in Denmark during 1997 and 1998. Significant 
variations (P < 0.05) with regard to the concentration of the analyzed 
components were observed among the different rye varieties and also between 
different harvest years. However, the content of phenolic acids in the analyzed 
rye varieties was narrow compared to cereals such as wheat and barley. The 
concentration of ferulic acid, the most abundant phenolic acid ranged from 900 
to 1170 microgram g(-1) dry matter. The content in sinapic acid ranged from 70 
to 140 microgram g(-1) dry matter, p-coumaric acid ranged from 40 to 70 
microgram g(-1) dry matter, and caffeic, p-hydroxybenzoic, protocatechuic, and 
vanillic acids were all detected in concentrations less than 20 microgram g(-1) 
dry matter. The most abundant ferulic acid dehydrodimer 8-O-4 -DiFA was 
quantified in concentrations from 130 to 200 microgram g(-1) dry matter followed 
by 8,5 -DiFA benzofuran form (50-100 microgram g(-1) dry matter), 5,5 -DiFA 
(40-70 microgram g(-1) dry matter), and 8,5 -DiFA (20-40 microgram g(-1) dry 
matter).

Major brands of cocoa powder products present in the Spanish market were 
analyzed for monomeric flavanols [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] and 
flavonols [quercetin-3-glucuronide, quercetin-3-glucoside (isoquercitrin), 
quercetin-3-arabinoside, and quercetin]. In addition, the influence of the 
manufacturing process of cocoa powder products, in particular, the 
alkalinization treatment ( Dutching), on the original content of these 
flavonoids has been studied. (-)-Epicatechin was in the range of 116.02-730.26 
microg/g, whereas (+)-catechin was in the range of 81.40-447.62 microg/g in the 
commercial cocoa products studied. Among flavonols, quercetin-3-arabinoside and 
isoquercitrin were the major flavonols in the cocoa powder products studied, 
ranging from 2.10 to 40.33 microg/g and from 3.97 to 42.74 microg/g, 
respectively, followed by quercetin-3-glucuronide (0.13-9.88 microg/g) and 
quercetin aglycone (0.28-3.25 microg/g). To our knowledge, these results are the 
first quantitative data in relation to the content of individualized flavonol 
derivatives in commercial cocoa powder products. The alkalinization treatment 
resulted in 60% loss of the mean total flavonoid content. Among flavanols, 
(-)-epicatechin presented a larger decline (67%, as a mean percentage 
difference) than (+)-catechin (38%), probably because of its epimerization into 
(-)-catechin, a less bioavailable form of catechin. A decline was also confirmed 
for di-, tri-, and tetrameric procyanidins. In the case of flavonols, quercetin 
presented the highest loss (86%), whereas quercetin-3-glucuronide, 
quercetin-3-arabinoside, and isoquercitrin showed a similar decrease (58, 62, 
and 61%, respectively). It is concluded that the large decrease found in the 
flavonoid content of natural cocoa powder, together with the observed change in 
the monomeric flavanol profile that results from the alkalinization treatment, 
could affect the antioxidant properties and the polyphenol biovailability of 
cocoa powder products.

The study examines the combined effects of germination and parboiling on starch 
digestibility, nutrient bioavailability, and glycemic index (GI) of five 
commercially significant South Indian Indica rice varieties: Pokkali, Kuruva, 
Kattuyanam, Jyothi, and Uma. The research assesses changes in the content of 
phenolics, flavonoids, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) induced by 
germination, followed by parboiling. Rice samples were subjected to various 
germination periods prior to parboiling, and their nutritional profiles and GI 
values were compared with those of rice that subjected to parboiling alone. The 
predicted GI was validated through oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) to 
measure physiological glycemic responses (SL-06/2023 and SL-07/2023 dated 
11/01/2023). Additionally, C-peptide levels were assessed in healthy volunteers 
to further evaluate the antidiabetic potential. Results indicate that 
germination combined with parboiling significantly improved the phytochemical 
profiles of the rice varieties. The total phenolic content (TPC) was highest in 
the 48-hour germinated-parboiled Kattuyanam rice (224.0 mg GAE/100 g, p < 0.05), 
while other varieties also showed increased TPC after 48 h of germination. The 
total flavonoid content (TFC) and GABA were also elevated in the 48-hour 
germinated-parboiled Kattuyanam rice (590 mg QE/100 g and 513.2 mg/100 g, 
p < 0.05, respectively). All germinated-parboiled samples exhibited lower GI 
values, with Pokkali showing the lowest predicted GI (41.7). In vivo GI 
measurements validated the in vitro results, underscoring the benefits of 
germination before parboiling in enhancing nutrient bioavailability, starch 
digestibility, and reducing GI. These findings suggest that the combined 
germination and parboiling process could be an effective dietary intervention 
for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes management, highlighting its potential 
for improved nutritional and medicinal applications in rice.

BACKGROUND: Plants have evolved the ability to produce specialized metabolites 
as a defense mechanism against biotic and abiotic stressors, with 
flavonoid-mediated defense responses playing a crucial role in this process. 
Diverse flavonoids are present in various rice-grown resources, and they confer 
tolerance to different environmental conditions, including high temperature 
stress. Elucidating the differences in these flavonoids is essential for 
breeding improved rice varieties with enhanced tolerance to adverse 
environments. In a previous study, we isolated a dominant rice mutant generated 
by T-DNA insertion and christened it rolled and erect leaf 1 (hereafter rel1-D), 
initially identified for its enhanced tolerance to drought stress and its 
involvement in the regulation of leaf rolling and erectness. In this study, we 
utilized ZH11 and the rel1-D mutant as experimental materials to compare the 
expression profiles of genes and metabolites involved in the flavonoid pathway 
and high-temperature tolerance.
RESULT: In our previous study, we generated a dominant mutant rel1-D in the ZH11 
rice background via T-DNA insertion. Upon exposure to high-temperature stress 
followed by a recovery period, we observed that all ZH11 plants succumbed to the 
stress, whereas nearly 50% of the rel1-D mutants survived. Comprehensive 
transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed 1,184 differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) and 126 differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) between the two 
genotypes. Notably, the majority of these differentially expressed genes and 
metabolites were enriched in the phenylalanine and flavonoid biosynthetic 
pathways in the rel1-D mutant. Specifically, the expression levels of key genes 
involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, including OsCHI, OsF3H, OsFLS, OsCHS, OsPAL, 
and Os4CL, were significantly upregulated in rel1-D, resulting in elevated 
levels of flavonoid compounds. Furthermore, we constructed a correlation network 
integrating phenotypic traits with the identified genes and metabolites. Our 
analysis indicated that the metabolism of flavonoids and phenolic compounds in 
leaves was positively correlated, whereas both were negatively correlated with 
yield-related traits.
CONCLUSION: Potential genes regulated by ROLLED AND ERECT LEAF1 (REL1) and 
flavonoid metabolites were identified. REL1 may affect the accumulation of 
flavonoid metabolites by regulating the expression of key genes in the flavonoid

Phenolic and orthodiphenolic compounds together with carotenoids, tocopherols, 
pigments, and fatty acids were tested for their antioxidant effect in 79 samples 
of virgin olive oils cv. Picual and Hojiblanca. A linear regression based on the 
oleic/linoleic ratio and the contents of phenols and tocopherols showed a good 
correlation (adjusted-R(2) = 0.91) with the stability measured by Rancimat, 
later verified with an external text set (adjusted-R(2) = 0.95). A tentative 
study on the percentage contribution of each chemical variable to stability is 
discussed. The contribution of phenolic and orthodiphenolic compounds was around 
51%, the composition of fatty acids 24%, and in less percentage 
alpha-tocopherol, carotenoids, and chlorophylls. No effect, or very little, was 
shown by beta- and gamma-tocopherols.

AIM: We investigated different bioactive compounds including epigallocatechin 
gallate (EGCG), anthocyanidin, resveratrol, phloretin, spermidine, butyrate, and 
β-hydroxybutyrate with regard to their effect on SIRT3 via NRF2 and modulation 
of the proinflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in 
senescence induced 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.
METHODS: For induction of senescence, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were incubated with 
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 8 days. Cell cycle inhibition was observed, and 
β-galactosidase activity was measured. After BrdU treatment, cells were treated 
with different bioactive compounds in various concentrations for 96 h. ELISA was 
used for determining proinflammatory cytokine IL6 in SASP cells.
RESULTS: CDKN1a increased significantly after BrdU incubation compared to 
untreated control (p < 0.01). All secondary plant ingredients used for 
treatment, but not anthocyanidin 50 μM, decrease CDKN1a expression (p < 0.05), 
whereas most endogenous substances did not attenuate CDKN1a. IL6 secretion 
positively correlated with CDKN1a (p < 0.01), whereas EGCG could diminish both, 
IL6 and CDKN1a with the strongest effect (p < 0.01). Although NRF2 positively 
correlated with SIRT3 activation (p < 0.05), only resveratrol (p < 0.01) and 
anthocyanidin (p < 0.05) could activate NRF2 significantly. Solely anthocyanidin 
50 μM (p < 0.05) and 100 μM (p < 0.01) and EGCG 50 μM (p < 0.01) could increase 
SIRT3 expression. Activation of SIRT3 with EGCG correlated with lowered IL6 
secretion significantly (p < 0.05) but not with anthocyanidin.
CONCLUSION: Accumulation of senescent cells in adipose tissue plays an important 
role in obesity and age-related diseases. SIRT3, located in the mitochondria, 
can regulate ROS via different pathways. Thus, targeting SIRT3 activating 
compounds such as EGCG may delay senescence of cells and senescence induced 
inflammatory processes.

The objective of this work was to quantify the flavonoids present in foods most 
commonly consumed by the Brazilian population. The predominant flavonoids found 
in largest abundance in all of the analyzed vegetables were glycosides of 
quercetin. In lettuce, a small amount of luteolin was also detected. In sweet 
pepper, quercetin and luteolin were both present. White onion [48-56 mg/100 g of 
fresh weight (FW), expressed as aglycon], red onion (40-100 mg/100 g of FW), red 
lettuce (67-67.2 mg/100 g of FW), arugula (41-118 mg/100 g of FW), and chicory 
(18-38 mg/100 g of FW) were highest in total flavonoids. In fruits, the highest 
concentrations of flavonoids were found in the peel (125-170 mg/100 g of FW) and 
pulp (35-44 mg/100 g of FW) of oranges and in some apple varieties (14-36 mg/100 
g of FW). Variability in flavonoid content due to time of harvesting was high 
for leafy vegetables and red onions. The estimated ingestion by Brazilian 
population ranged from 60 to 106 mg/day.

This study evaluated bioactive compounds in blood orange (Citrus sinensis (L.) 
Osbeck) peel (BOP) as dietary additives. An 8-week feeding trial was conducted 
to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation on the growth performance, 
body composition, digestive enzyme activity, antioxidant capacity, and immune 
response of juvenile black rockfish. A total of 1260 juvenile rockfish (1.4 ± 
0.01 g) were randomly distributed into seven treatment groups, each with 50 fish 
per circular tank. The groups were fed seven different diets containing graded 
levels of 0 (control, BOP0), 1 (BOP1), 2 (BOP2), 3 (BOP3), 5 (BOP5), 7 (BOP7), 
and 10 (BOP10) g kg-1, respectively. The BOP10 diet significantly enhanced the 
final weight, weight gain, specific growth rate, protein efficiency ratio, and 
protein retention in fish. The BOP treatments notably affected the fishes' 
whole-body crude protein and lipid contents. Plasma total cholesterol levels of 
fish fed the BOP0 and BOP1 diets were significantly higher than those fed the 
BOP7 and BOP10 diets. The activities of trypsin and lipase were significantly 
affected by dietary BOP levels. The antioxidant enzyme activity in the plasma of 
fish fed the BOP10 diet was significantly higher than those fed the BOP0 diet. 
The lysozyme activity and levels of immunoglobulin M and G in fish fed the BOP0 
diet were significantly lower than those in fish fed the BOP10 diet. In 
conclusion, dietary supplementation of BOP at 10 g kg-1 improved the growth 
performance and overall health of juvenile black rockfish.

The search for alternative sources of biologically active compounds of plant 
origin, including phenolic compounds (PCs), is of great importance in medicine 
and pharmacology. Morphophysiological characteristics, photosynthetic pigments, 
PCs content, phenolic profile, as well as antioxidant (AOA) and antiradical 
activity (ARA), were studied for in vitro rhododendrons' microshoots (R. 
smirnowii, R. PJM Elite, R. japonicum). The microshoots of R. PJM Elite had the 
highest photosynthetic pigments content (chlorophylls a and b), exceeding that 
of R. smirnowii and R. japonicum, it was 33% and 42%, respectively. The total 
phenolic content increased in the row R. PJM Elite < R. smirnowii < R. 
japonicum. Twelve to twenty phenolic compounds were identified in ethanol 
extracts of rhododendron microshoots, using high-performance liquid 
chromatography. Quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin dominated in the phenolic 
complex of R. japonicum and R. smirnowii, whereas in R. PJM Elite, they were 
taxifolin and (-)-epicatechin. The AOA and ARA evaluation in DPPH-radical system 
and the model of initiated liposomes oxidation allowed to determine the highest 
activity in both systems for R. japonicum extracts, which was not typical for 
the other two species extracts. A high correlation was found between AOA 
extracts and the flavonoid content in them. The results obtained indicate the 
prospects of using R. japonicum and R. PJM Elite microshoots as an alternative 
source of flavonols and flavanols, accordingly.

INTRODUCTION: The olive tree (Olea europaea L.) has cultural, economic, and 
environmental importance in the Mediterranean region. In the last two decades, 
olive cultivation has shifted from low-density to super high-density (SHD) 
planting systems. These systems are characterized by narrow hedgerows of 
low-vigor, early-bearing cultivars, allowing full mechanization. However, 
limited information are available on shoot growth dynamics of the olive tree 
under the SHD system. This study aimed to investigate the shoot growth dynamics 
of four olive cultivars ('Arbequina', 'Coratina', 'Frantoio', and 'Urano') by 
modeling the elongation of different shoot types (apical proleptic, lateral 
proleptic, sylleptic) under SHD conditions.
METHODS: A four-year field study was conducted on four olive cultivars 
('Arbequina', 'Coratina', 'Frantoio', and 'Urano') grown in an SHD orchard under 
Mediterranean climate. Apical proleptic, lateral proleptic, sylleptic, and 
adventitious shoots were monitored. Logistic regression was applied to model 
shoot elongation, and statistical analyses were conducted to assess the 
influence of cultivar, shoot type, and year. Moreover, the effect of crop load 
and temperature on shoot growth was also evaluated.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: No significant difference was shown between the type of 
shoot and cultivar. Results indicate that single-phase logistic growth was the 
most common pattern, except for the lateral proleptic shoots of 'Coratina' and 
adventitious of 'Urano', where a second vegetative flush occurred. No 
correlation of Growing Degree Days with the shoot growth was observed. As 
confirmed in previous studies, crop load showed a negative influence on shoot 
elongation. Particularly for Arbequina's adventitious shoots, Coratina's and 
Frantio's sylleptic shoots and Urano's lateral proleptic, this trend was 
observed. This evidence showed the potential competition between the 
reproductive and vegetative cycle for assimilates. To our knowledge, this is the 
first report addressing the vegetative growth dynamics of four different shoot 
types of four distinct olive cultivars with different vigor in an SHD system. 
These findings are essential for optimizing cultivar-specific agricultural 
strategies (e.g. canopy management and irrigation) to achieve an optimal yield 
and sustainable cultivation. Future research will explore the vegetative growth 
dynamics, including other factors such as trunk diameter, Leaf Area Index, and 
water stress indices.

BACKGROUND: Different antioxidant compounds are generally transferred from 
olives to olive oil during the production process. This work characterized the 
principal total bioactive compounds (tocopherols and phenols) in olives, olive 
oil and by-products of four cultivars grown in Calabrian areas (southern Italy), 
considering the effect of harvesting period. Antioxidant capacity, total and 
individual phenolic compounds were also analysed.
RESULTS: Drupes, olive paste, pomace and olive wastewater showed similar 
phenolic compounds, while olive oil possessed a different composition, 
suggesting that phenols are not only transferred from drupe to oil, but also 
they change during oil production. Tocopherols varied among cultivars and 
harvesting period: generally, they were more abundant in samples produced in the 
first harvesting period. Qualitative and quantitative differences in phenolic 
composition and antioxidant activity were significantly found among cultivars in 
all the matrices.
CONCLUSION: The highest amount of total phenolic antioxidants ended up in olive 
wastewater with variability due to the olive cultivar, while only a small part 
of them finished in the oil. This work shows evidence that the availability of 
bioactive compounds in different portions from the olive oil extraction belong 
to different varietal origins. In particular, new information was acquired on 
Ottobratica Calipa, a new olive clone, that produced an olive oil with an 
interesting antioxidant amount. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

The antioxidant catechin content of chocolate is four times that of tea. 
Chocolate contributed 20% of the catechin intake in a representative sample of 
the Dutch population, and tea contributes 55%. Epidemiological assessments of 
health effects of tea should include other foods that are sources of catechins.

Phytonutrients (e.g., phenolic compounds and flavonoids) are secondary plant 
metabolites that play an important role in the defense against pathogens and 
protection from oxidative injury because of their potential ability to 
neutralize reactive oxygen species. The present study aimed to determine the 
antioxidant contents, scavenging activity, and toxicity of aqueous extracts of 
common Omani plants. The total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content 
(TFC), scavenging activity against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and brine shrimp 
lethality of the aqueous extracts of commonly used Omani ethnobotanical plants 
were evaluated. The samples exhibited a wide range of the investigated 
parameters. TPC ranged from 0.52 to 65.14 mg gallic acid equivalent/g dry solid, 
whereas TFC ranged from 0.07 to 37.14 mg catechin equivalent/g dry solid. 
Moreover, the scavenging activity ranged from 6.9% to 91.9%. Among 18 plant 
species that were examined, Pteropyrum scoparium, Moringa peregrina, Dodonaea 
viscosa, Rhus aucheri, Acridocarpus orientalis, and Prosopis cineraria showed 
high values in almost all parameters. At exposure levels of 1 to 1,000 μg/mL, 
the lethality test using four plants with the highest TPC values and scavenging 
activity (M. peregrina, P. scoparium, R. aucheri, and P. cineraria) revealed 
that they may be safe for consumption as food or medicine. In general, the study 
demonstrated that some Omani plant species may be potential sources of phenolic 
compounds and flavonoids. Thus, these plant species should be propagated to be 
used in the food and nutraceutical industries. Moreover, they can be consumed to 
combat chronic oxidative stress-mediated diseases.

Catechins, compounds that belong to the flavonoid class, are potentially 
beneficial to human health. To enable an epidemiological evaluation of 
catechins, data on their contents in foods are required. HPLC with UV and 
fluorescence detection was used to determine the levels of (+)-catechin, 
(-)-epicatechin, (+)-gallocatechin (GC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), 
(-)-epicatechin gallate (ECg), and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) in 8 
types of black tea, 18 types of red and white wines, apple juice, grape juice, 
iced tea, beer, chocolate milk, and coffee. Tea infusions contained high levels 
of catechins (102-418 mg of total catechins/L), and tea was the only beverage 
that contained GC, EGC, ECg, and EGCg in addition to (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin. Catechin concentrations were still substantial in red wine 
(27-96 mg/L), but low to negligible amounts were found in white wine, 
commercially available fruit juices, iced tea, and chocolate milk. Catechins 
were absent from beer and coffee. The data reported here provide a base for the 
epidemiological evaluation of the effect of catechins on the risk for chronic 
diseases.

OBJECTIVE: Oral cancer remains a major global health challenge due to its 
aggressive nature, high recurrence rates, and limited treatment options. 
Resveratrol (RV), a naturally occurring polyphenol, has demonstrated promising 
anticancer properties in various malignancies, including oral cancer. This 
systematic review aimed to evaluate preclinical evidence on RV's therapeutic 
effects in oral cancer, focusing on its mechanisms of apoptosis induction, 
metastasis inhibition, autophagy regulation, and immune modulation.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, with a 
comprehensive search in Google Scholar, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of 
Science for preclinical studies published up to March 2, 2025. Both in vitro and 
in vivo studies investigating RV's effects on oral cancer were included based on 
predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction was performed 
independently by multiple researchers, with discrepancies resolved through 
consensus. Key mechanisms of RV's anticancer activity, including apoptosis, 
metastasis suppression, autophagy, and immune regulation, were analyzed.
RESULTS: Out of 346 studies screened, 19 (four in vivo and 15 in vitro) met the 
eligibility criteria. RV exhibited potent anticancer effects in a dose- and 
time-dependent manner, significantly reducing oral cancer cell viability and 
tumor growth in animal models. Mechanistically, RV induced apoptosis through 
caspase-3, -7, and -9 activation and modulation of pro-apoptotic (Bax, Bak) and 
anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL) proteins. RV also inhibited key oncogenic 
pathways, including Akt/mTOR and JAK2/STAT3, thereby suppressing tumor 
proliferation and immune evasion. Additionally, RV impaired metastatic 
progression by downregulating EMT-related transcription factors (TWIST, SLUG, 
and Zeb1) and reducing angiogenic markers such as VEGF and MMPs. Notably, RV 
induced autophagy in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as evidenced by 
increased LC3-II, Beclin1, and p62 expression. In cisplatin-resistant oral 
cancer models, RV promoted both apoptotic and autophagic cell death, suggesting 
its potential as an adjuvant therapy.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review underscored the potential of RV as a 
promising anticancer agent for oral cancer. Through apoptosis induction, 
metastasis suppression, autophagy modulation, and immune regulation, RV 
demonstrated broad-spectrum anticancer effects. However, its low bioavailability 
remains a significant challenge. Future research should focus on optimizing drug 
delivery strategies, such as nanoparticle formulations and combination 
therapies, to enhance RV's therapeutic efficacy and facilitate clinical 
translation.

Salinity is a major abiotic stress that restricts global crop productivity, 
particularly in staple cereals such as wheat (Triticum aestivum). This study 
investigates the biostimulant potential of two cyanobacterial strains, 
Alkalinema pantanalense (freshwater origin) and Geminocystis sp. (marine 
origin), on the early growth of three wheat genotypes under varying salt stress 
conditions (0, 50, 100, and 200 mM NaCl). Algal extracts were applied to seeds 
and seedlings, and physiological, anatomical, and biochemical responses were 
assessed. Results revealed that A. pantanalense significantly improved seed 
germination and chlorophyll content under moderate salinity (50-100 mM), 
especially in genotype G2, with shoot length reaching up to 3.5 cm and 
chlorophyll levels maintained near control values. In contrast, Geminocystis sp. 
enhanced root dry weight even under high salinity (200 mM), suggesting improved 
osmotic adjustment, though it reduced root length and meristem size in some 
genotypes. Anatomical analysis revealed that A. pantanalense increased the 
number of root meristem cells and promoted vascular differentiation, thereby 
supporting structural resilience. Phytochemical profiling revealed that A. 
pantanalense was richer in flavonoids (130.7 µg/g naringin) and phenolic acids 
(ferulic and caffeic), while Geminocystis sp. had higher phytohormone levels, 
notably IAA (20.95 µg/g ) and BA. GC-MS analysis identified bioactive compounds 
such as lupeol and oleic acid in A. pantanalense, and phytol and methyl esters 
in Geminocystis sp. These findings demonstrate distinct yet complementary 
biostimulant profiles between the two cyanobacteria, underscoring their 
potential for sustainable wheat cultivation in saline soils.

The effects of product and preparation variables on the in-cup chemical 
composition of tea extracts is of interest because the appearance and taste 
characteristics and the possible health effects of a tea liquor arise from the 
chemical components extracted from the leaf during tea preparation. A 
comprehensive study was therefore undertaken to determine the contributions of 
product and preparation variables on the total soluble solids, caffeine, and 
polyphenol contents of tea extracts. The results of this study show that the 
variety, growing environment, manufacturing conditions, and grade (particle 
size) of the tea leaves each influence the tea leaf and final infusion 
compositions. In addition, the composition of the tea infusion was shown to be 
influenced by whether the tea was contained in a teabag and, if so, the size and 
material of construction of the bag. Finally, the preparation method, including 
the amounts of tea and water used, infusion time, and amount of agitation, was 
shown to be a major determinant of the component concentrations of tea beverages 
as consumed. An illustration of the variation introduced by these product and 
preparation factors is provided by comparing solids, caffeine, and polyphenol 
contents of green and black tea infusions when commercial products are prepared 
according to the instructions given on their packaging.

The major flavanone-7-O-glycoside constituents in citrus fruit juices (naringin, 
hesperidin, neohesperidin, narirutin, and eriocitrin) were separated as 
diastereomers by multidimensional liquid chromatography. The method consisted of 
coupling two HPLC columns: a reversed-phase (RP(18)) column was used for the 
separation of flavanone glycosides, which were, then, individually switched into 
a carboxymethylated beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD)-based column and resolved as the 
corresponding stereoisomers. The method was used for the full analysis of 
flavanone glycosides in fresh hand-squeezed and commercial fruit juices by 
combining the quantitative estimation with the diastereomeric analysis. 
Quantitative data were in general consistent with previously reported data in 
this field. CC-LC isomer analysis was carried out by coupling the beta-CD column 
with a mass spectrometer operated with negative ion electrospray ionization 
(ESI-MS). The results showed that hesperidin was present in orange juices almost 
exclusively as the 2S isomer, whereas narirutin had mainly the 2R configuration. 
In grapefruit juices (2S)-naringin prevailed with the respect to the 2R isomer, 
whereas the opposite was true for narirutin. Lemon juices contained eriocitrin 
stereoisomers in equal amount (50% each), but hesperidin was almost exclusively 
found as the 2S isomer. Significant differences of the diastereomeric ratios 
were observed between freshly squeezed juices and juices from commercial 
sources.

Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench), characterized by substantial genetic 
diversity, encompasses some lines rich in health-promoting polyphenols. 
Laboratory studies have demonstrated anticancer properties of sorghum phenolics; 
however, their presence may impact nutritional factors, such as digestible 
starch. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of pH and 
high-moisture heating on starch digestibility, phenolic profile, and anticancer 
activity in sorghum. High Phenolic sorghum flour line SC84 was combined with 
buffer solutions (pH 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8) and heated for 0, 10, 30, 60, or 
120 min. Starch digestibility was assessed using the K-DSTRS kit from Megazyme. 
Changes in phenolic composition were analyzed using total phenolic content (TPC) 
and condensed tannin content (CTC) assays coupled with reversed phase high 
performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) analysis. Anticancer potential 
against human colorectal cancer cells (HCT116 and SW480) was determined though 
cell viability assay. Results indicated a significant increase in total starch 
digestibility of sample after heating. Heating samples for 10 min did not 
significantly reduce TPC of samples. However, CTC was significantly reduced with 
heating time, while pH exhibited no significant effect on CTC. The measured 
3-deoxyanthocyanidins experienced a significant decrease (p < 0.0001), while 
certain flavonoids increased significantly (p < 0.05) after heating for 30 min 
or longer. Notably, the 10 min heating duration minimally affected anticancer 
activity, whereas longer heat times diminished extract efficacy against human 
colorectal cancer cells. Alkaline pH levels significantly decreased anticancer 
activity, regardless of heating time. Importantly, heating sorghum for 10 min 
improved starch digestibility with minimal compromise to potential health 
benefits. These findings suggest promising implications for the development of 
high-phenolic sorghum products, and provide valuable insights to guide 
forthcoming animal and clinical studies. The demonstrated impact of wet-heating 
on increased starch digestibility, coupled with the preservation of phenolic 
content and bioactivity, underscores the potential of incorporating 
high-phenolic sorghum lines in future functional food formulations.

The aims of the present study were to determine the level of (-)-epicatechin 
(EC) and its metabolites in rat plasma after oral administration of cocoa powder 
and to evaluate the protective effect of cocoa powder in terms of suppressing 
the oxidation of plasma components. Rats were orally administered 1 g cocoa 
powder/kg body weight, containing 7.80 mg EC, and their blood was collected 
before administration and at designated time intervals thereafter. The EC and 
its metabolites in plasma were treated with beta-glucuronidase and/or sulfatase, 
then analysed by HPLC and by liquid chromatography-MS. Several EC-related 
compounds were detected in plasma such as free EC, and glucuronide, sulfate, and 
glucuronide-sulfate conjugates of non-methylated or methylated EC. All EC 
metabolites showed a maximum concentration in plasma at 30-60 min 
post-administration. Glucuronide conjugates of both non-methylated and 
methylated EC were found in high concentration in plasma. Moreover, 
administration of cocoa powder significantly reduced the accumulation of lipid 
peroxides in plasma and significantly reduced the consumption of 
alpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with 
2,2'-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH (25 mmol/l)) or CuSO(4) 
(100 micromol/l) compared with that in the case of plasma obtained before 
administration. The total EC concentration in plasma was negatively correlated 
with the level of accumulation of lipid peroxides in plasma oxidized by 
treatment with AAPH (25 mmol/l) and was positively correlated with the level of 
residual alpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with CuSO(4) (100 
micromol/l). These results indicate that EC in cocoa powder was absorbed from 
the digestive tract, that various conjugated forms of EC were generated in the 
digestive tract and distributed to the plasma, and that these enhanced the 
antioxidative activity of plasma.

(-)-Epicatechin is a major polyphenol component of cocoa powder. The absorption 
and urinary excretion of (-)-epicatechin following administration of different 
levels of either cocoa powder (150, 750, and 1500 mg/kg) or (-)-epicatechin (1, 
5, and 10 mg/kg) were evaluated in rats. Both the sum of plasma (-)-epicatechin 
metabolites at 1 h postadministration and peak plasma concentrations increased 
in a dose-dependent fashion. The sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in urine, 
excreted within 18 h postadministration, also increased with dose. Moreover, the 
sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites excreted in urine reached the same level in 
both (-)-epicatechin and cocoa powder administration groups for equivalent 
amounts of (-)-epicatechin. These results suggest that, in the dose range 
examined in this study, bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin following 
administration of either (-)-epicatechin or cocoa powder shows dose dependence 
and that the various compounds present in cocoa powder have little effect on the 
bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin in cocoa powder.

We compared levels of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and their metabolites in 
rat plasma and urine after oral administration. Rats were divided into four 
groups and given (+)-catechin (CA group), (-)-epicatechin (EC group), a mixture 
of the two (MIX group) or deionized water. Blood samples were collected before 
administration and at designated time intervals thereafter. Urine samples were 
collected 0-24 h postadministration. (+)-Catechin, (-)-epicatechin and their 
metabolites in plasma and urine were analyzed by HPLC-mass spectrometry after 
treatment with beta-glucuronidase and/or sulfatase. After administration, 
absorbed (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were mainly present in plasma as 
metabolites, such as nonmethylated or 3'-O-methylated conjugates. In the CA and 
MIX groups, the primary metabolite of (+)-catechin in plasma was glucuronide in 
the nonmethylated form. In the EC and MIX groups, in contrast, the primary 
metabolites of (-)-epicatechin in plasma were glucuronide and sulfoglucuronide 
in nonmethylated forms, and sulfate in the 3'-O-methylated forms. Urinary 
excretion of the total amount of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in the EC group was 
significantly higher than the amount of (+)-catechin metabolites in the CA 
group. The sum of (+)-catechin metabolites in the urine was significantly lower 
in the MIX group than in the CA group, and the sum of (-)-epicatechin 
metabolites in the MIX group was also significantly lower than in the EC group. 
These results suggest that the bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin is higher than 
that of (+)-catechin in rats, and that, in combination, (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin might be absorbed competitively in the gastrointestinal tract of 
rats.

In the present study, we examined whether rosmarinic acid (RA) reverses amyloid 
β (Aβ) induced reductions in antioxidant defense, lipid peroxidation, 
cholinergic damage as well as the central auditory deficits. For this purpose, 
Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups; Sham(S), Sham + RA (SR), 
Aβ42 peptide (Aβ) and Aβ42 peptide + RA (AβR) groups. Rat model of Alzheimer was 
established by bilateral injection of Aβ42 peptide (2,2 nmol/10 μl) into the 
lateral ventricles. RA (50 mg/kg, daily) was administered orally by gavage for 
14 days after intracerebroventricular injection. At the end of the experimental 
period, we recorded the auditory event related potentials (AERPs) and mismatch 
negativity (MMN) response to assess auditory functions followed by histological 
and biochemical analysis. Aβ42 injection led to a significant increase in the 
levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and 
4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) but decreased the activity of antioxidant enzymes 
(SOD, CAT, GSH-Px) and glutathione levels. Moreover, Aβ42 injection resulted in 
a reduction in the acetylcholine content and acetylcholine esterase activity. RA 
treatment prevented the observed alterations in the AβR group. Furthermore, RA 
attenuated the increased Aβ staining and astrocyte activation. We also found 
that Aβ42 injection decreased the MMN response and theta power/coherence of 
AERPs, suggesting an impairing effect on auditory discrimination and echoic 
memory processes. RA treatment reversed the Aβ42 related alterations in AERP 
parameters. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that RA prevented Aβ-induced 
antioxidant-oxidant imbalance and cholinergic damage, which may contribute to 
the improvement of neural network dynamics of auditory processes in this rat 
model.

    Eur J Nutr. 2005 Feb;44(1):9.

BACKGROUND: Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural polyphenolic substance contained 
in many Lamiaceae herbs such as Perilla frutescens. Previous studies have shown 
RA has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activity. However, little is known on 
the absorption, metabolism, degradation and excretion of RA.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study in healthy humans was to determine the 
absorption, metabolism, and urinary excretion of RA after a single intake of 
perilla extract (PE).
METHOD: Six healthy men (mean age 37.2 +/- 6.2 y and mean body mass index 22.0 
+/- 1.9 kg/m(2)) were enrolled in the study that was a crossover design 
involving single intakes of PE containing 200 mg RA and placebo with a 10 day 
interval between treatments. Blood samples were collected before intake and at 
designated time intervals, while urine samples were collected over the periods 
0-6 h, 6-24 h and 24-48 h after intake. RA and its related metabolites in plasma 
and urine were measured by LC-MS.
RESULTS: RA, methylated RA (methyl-RA), caffeic acid (CAA), ferulic acid (FA) 
and a trace of m-coumaric acid (COA) were detected in the urine after intake of 
PE. In plasma, RA, methyl-RA and FA were detected, with maximum levels obtained 
0.5, 2 and 0.5 h after intake of PE, respectively. The majority of these 
components in both plasma and urine were present as conjugated forms 
(glucuronide and/or sulfated). The proportion of RA and its related metabolites 
excreted in the urine was 6.3 +/- 2.2% of the total dose, with approximately 75% 
of these components being excreted within 6 h after intake of PE.
CONCLUSIONS: RA contained in PE was absorbed, conjugated and methylated 
following intake, with a small proportion of RA being degraded into various 
components, such as conjugated forms of CAA, FA and COA. These metabolites were 
then rapidly excreted in the urine.

BACKGROUND: Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols such as catechins and 
procyanidins and has been shown in various models to inhibit LDL oxidation and 
atherogenesis.
OBJECTIVE: We examined whether long-term intake of cocoa powder alters plasma 
lipid profiles in normocholesterolemic and mildly hypercholesterolemic human 
subjects.
DESIGN: Twenty-five subjects were randomly assigned to ingest either 12 g 
sugar/d (control group) or 26 g cocoa powder and 12 g sugar/d (cocoa group) for 
12 wk. Blood samples were collected before the study and 12 wk after intake of 
the test drinks. Plasma lipids, LDL oxidative susceptibility, and urinary 
oxidative stress markers were measured.
RESULTS: At 12 wk, we measured a 9% prolongation from baseline levels in the lag 
time of LDL oxidation in the cocoa group. This prolongation in the cocoa group 
was significantly greater than the reduction measured in the control group 
(-13%). A significantly greater increase in plasma HDL cholesterol (24%) was 
observed in the cocoa group than in the control group (5%). A negative 
correlation was observed between plasma concentrations of HDL cholesterol and 
oxidized LDL. At 12 wk, there was a 24% reduction in dityrosine from baseline 
concentrations in the cocoa group. This reduction in the cocoa group was 
significantly greater than the reduction in the control group (-1%).
CONCLUSION: It is possible that increases in HDL-cholesterol concentrations may 
contribute to the suppression of LDL oxidation and that polyphenolic substances 
derived from cocoa powder may contribute to an elevation in HDL cholesterol.

Kakkalide is a major isoflavonoid from the flowers of Pueraria lobata (Willd.) 
Ohwi, possessing the protective effect against ethanol-induced intoxication and 
hepatic injury. The metabolism of kakkalide was investigated in rats. Thirteen 
metabolites were isolated by using solvent extraction and repeated 
chromatographic methods and identified by using spectroscopic methods including 
UV, IR, mass spectrometry, NMR, and circular dichroism experiments. Four new 
compounds were identified as irisolidone-7-O-glucuronide (M-1), 
tectorigenin-7-O-sulfate (M-2), tectorigenin-4'-O-sulfate (M-3), and biochanin 
A-6-O-sulfate (M-4) together with nine known compounds identified as irisolidone 
(M-5), tectorigenin (M-6), tectoridin (M-7), 
5,7-dihydroxy-8,4'-dimethoxyisoflavone (M-8), isotectorigenin (M-9), biochanin A 
(M-10), genistein (M-11), daidzein (M-12), and equol (M-13). The metabolic 
pathway of kakkalide was proposed, which is important to understand its 
metabolic fate and disposition in humans.

Phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of extra-virgin olive oils 
extracted from several Italian varieties were studied at production and during 
storage. The antioxidant activity was measured according to the following tests: 
in the aqueous phase, by radical scavenging of the 
2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical cation; and 
in the lipid phase, using the beta-carotene bleaching method. The phenolic 
content was not correlated to the oxidation indices (peroxide value and 
spectrophotometric constants). The phenolic contents and profiles of the various 
cultivars showed remarkable differences. The phenolic content was strongly 
correlated with the antioxidant activity measured according to the beta-carotene 
test and weakly correlated with the radical scavenging ability.

In the present paper, the following extraction techniques have been used for 
extracting isoflavonoids from the species Matricaria recutita, Rosmarinus 
officinalis, Foeniculum vulgare, and Agrimonia eupatoria L.: supercritical fluid 
extraction (SFE), pressurized fluid extraction, matrix solid phase dispersion, 
ultrasonic extraction in an ultrasonic bath (USE) and by means of an ultrasonic 
homogeniser (HOM), extraction by means of Soxhlet apparatus (SOX), and solid 
phase extraction. Experimental optimization of all techniques has been carried 
out using a soybean flour. Subsequent analyses of the extracts were carried out 
by liquid chromatography with UV detection. The maximum yields of daidzein and 
genistein were obtained by extraction with the SOX, USE, and HOM techniques. The 
maximum yields of apigenin and biochanin A from herb samples were obtained by 
SFE.

BACKGROUND: Acalypha rhomboidea, Asystacia gangetica, Crassocephalum sacrobasis, 
Crotalaria ochroleuca, Heterosis rotundifolia, Hibiscus cannabinus, Hibiscus 
sp., Hibiscus surratensis, Ipomoea eriocarpa, Maerua angolensis, Senna 
obtusifolia and Vigna membranacea are among the common wild edible plants in the 
Acholi sub-region, northern Uganda. This study evaluated the phytochemical 
constituents and antioxidant potential of the plants.
METHODS: Fresh leaves collected from each plant species were air-dried under 
shade. The phytochemical contents of the ethanol and petroleum ether extracts 
were determined using standard protocols. The antioxidant content of the 
methanolic extracts was assessed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay.
RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical analyses indicated the presence of tannins, 
reducing compounds, alkaloids, flavonoids, flavons aglycones, flavanosides, 
anthracenosides, anthocyanosides, volatile oils, coumarins, steroid glycosides, 
sterols and triterpenes. However, the extracts did not contain any emodols and 
saponins. The results of the quantitative phytochemical analysis showed that the 
contents of different phytochemicals detected varied significantly (p < 0.05) 
among the selected plants. The amount of tannins in mg/g (gallic acid 
equivalent) of dry weight varied from 3.90 ± 0.16 in C. ochroleuca to 
10.41 ± 0.78 in I. eriocarpa, total flavonoids in RE, mg/g dry matter from 
4.07 ± 0.11 in I. eriocarpa to 14.94 ± 0.08 in S. obtusifolia. Total alkaloids 
in mg/100 g ranged from 1.59 ± 0.30 in I. eriocarpa to 6.37 ± 0.24 in Hibiscus 
sp. Total phenolic content in GAE, mg/g dry matter ranged from 13.39 ± 0.26 in 
A. rhomboidea to 64.25 ± 0.54 in I. eriocarpa. The in vitro antioxidant assays 
revealed substantial free radical scavenging activity in all the plants. 
Antioxidant activity expressed as IC50 (ppm) ranged from 13.39 for A. rhomboidea 
to 64.84 for I. eriocarpa, compared to 12.82 for ascorbic acid standard. The 
total phenolic compounds and total tannins had significant and positive 
correlations with DPPH free radical scavenging activity.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study provide evidence that the species are 
good natural sources of phytochemicals and antioxidants, whose regular 
consumption could provide human health benefits by protecting against oxidative 
stress related diseases. Further research is needed on the structural 
characterization of the phytochemicals, profiling the plant extracts with high 
antioxidant activity and determining the antimicrobial activities.

Four trichothecene-producing strains of Fusarium graminearum were grown on three 
maize grain fractions, whole grain, degermed grain, and the germ, to determine 
the effect of natural substrates on mycotoxin production. Monitoring the 
ergosterol content after 25 days of incubation indicated that fungal growth on 
all grain fractions was comparable. Trichothecene (TCT) production was highest 
on degermed grain, less on whole grain, and very low or nondetectable on the 
germ; similar results were found with four different strains. It was concluded 
that inhibitor(s) of TCT biosynthesis were present in maize germ. The presence 
of phenolic compounds was investigated in the different fractions. The 
hydroxamate 4-acetylbenzoxazolin-2-one (4-ABOA), a known inhibitor of mycotoxin 
production, was found in the degermed and whole grain fractions but not in the 
germ. Therefore, the TCT inhibition observed on the maize germ fraction used in 
our study is clearly not linked to 4-ABOA. Other soluble phenolic compounds were 
found at a much higher concentration in the germ than in the two other 
fractions. The inhibition property of the soluble ester-bound extracts was 
tested in liquid culture. A possible role for these compounds is discussed.

Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) Components: Interaction with Pro-Inflammatory 
Cytokines Focusing on Cancer and Skeletal Muscle Biology.

Turin, Italy.

The advantages of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) intake as part of a varied, 
healthy and balanced diet were demonstrated by many epidemiological studies. In 
particular, several components present in EVOO, such as tocopherols, carotenoids 
and phenolic compounds, play an important protective role in mitigating 
inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. 
The protective effect exerted by EVOO was proposed to be accounted for by its 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory or anti-proliferative properties. The present 
review will focus on the interactions among EVOO's components and 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, aiming to reveal the mechanisms potentially involved 
in the anticancer action of EVOO. Cancer patients very frequently develop a 
devastating syndrome known as cachexia, which negatively impinges on their 
outcome. The main features of cachexia include progressive body weight loss, fat 
and muscle wasting, and dysmetabolism, all of which partially result from the 
onset of systemic inflammation. In this regard, the possibility that EVOO could 
be beneficial to cancer patients by mitigating cachexia will be reviewed, 
focusing on the skeletal muscle.

BACKGROUND: Kiwifruit is nutrient-rich but prone to postharvest spoilage. 
Conventional juicing results in a significant loss of bioactive compounds, which 
limits its functional value.
RESULTS: Xuxiang kiwifruit juice was fermented using three lactic acid bacterial 
strains: Limosilactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Weissella. 
The highest fermentation performance was observed in juice fermented with L. 
acidophilus: the viable cell count in the L. acidophilus group was significantly 
higher by 3.54% compared to the Weissella-fermented group, reaching 
(2.8 ± 0.5) × 109 CFU mL-1 (P < 0.001). The total acidity increased by 87.01% 
relative to the unfermented sample, achieving 20.59 ± 0.01 g L-1 (P < 0.001). 
After 32 h of fermentation, the total phenolic content increased by 28.94% 
compared to the control, reaching 3.03 ± 0.03 g L-1 (P < 0.001), while the 
vitamin C content represented a 3.22% improvement over the Weissella group 
(P < 0.001). The succinic acid content increased by 24.32% compared to the 
unfermented control, reaching 1.12 ± 0.01 mg mL-1 (P < 0.0001). Notably, ethyl 
palmitate was produced during fermentation with L. acidophilus, contributing to 
a creamy aroma. During fermentation with Weissella, the contents of glutamate 
and glycine were increased, and the ABTS radical scavenging activity increased 
by 27.89% compared to the unfermented control, reaching 95.06 ± 1.22% 
(P < 0.0001). During fermentation with L. fermentum, the flavonoid content 
increased dramatically by 135.29% relative to the unfermented control, reaching 
0.8 ± 0.05 g L-1 (P < 0.0001). After in vitro digestion, the ABTS radical 
scavenging capacity increased by 11.90% compared to the control, reaching 
83.19 ± 1.27% (P < 0.01), and superoxide dismutase activity increased by 3.82%, 
reaching 30 736 U mL-1 (P < 0.05). Fermentation with L. fermentum elevated key 
aroma compounds, including (E)-2-hexen-1-ol (22.54 ± 0.03%), 1-nonanol 
(1.32 ± 0.02%) and (E)-1-(2,6,6-trimethyl-1,3-cyclohexadien-1-yl)-2-buten-1-one 
(4.06 ± 0.02%). This resulted in an enriched flavor profile characterized by 
grassy, floral and citrus, rose and honey notes, along with an enhanced 
perception of berry-like sweetness.
CONCLUSION: The three lactic acid bacterial strains exhibited distinct 
functional advantages during kiwifruit juice fermentation, and L. fermentum 
demonstrated superior overall performance in both flavor compatibility and 
functional preservation. These results provide a technical basis for the 
development of high-quality probiotic kiwifruit beverages. © 2025 Society of

This research provides a comprehensive evaluation of the phytochemical 
composition, antioxidant potential, and biological properties of four plant 
species with longstanding use in ethnobotanical traditions: Calendula 
officinalis, Mentha × piperita, Urtica dioica, and Juglans regia. Plant extracts 
were obtained using a range of solvent systems and subsequently analyzed for 
their content of total polyphenols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids. 
Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry 
(UHPLC-MS) enabled the accurate identification and quantification of major 
polyphenolic constituents. The antioxidant capacity was assessed through a 
series of in vitro assays, and elemental analysis was conducted to determine 
microelement content. To evaluate potential ecological implications, acute 
toxicity was tested using Daphnia magna, while phytotoxic effects were also 
examined. The results demonstrate pronounced antioxidant activity along with 
notable biocidal and soil-enhancing properties. These findings underscore the 
potential of such plant-based formulations as sustainable alternatives to 
conventional agrochemicals and highlight the relevance of integrating 
traditional botanical knowledge with modern strategies for enhancing soil 
quality, crop performance, and environmental sustainability.

Sage herb (Salvia officinalis L.) was extracted at supercritical fluid 
extraction (SFE) conditions with carbon dioxide at different parameters and the 
extracts tested on their antioxidant activity (AA). SFE of sage herb at 35 MPa 
pressure was found to be an effective method to obtain pure extracts. The yields 
of the extracts were substantially increased by using 1% of entrainer solvent 
ethanol. The fractionation of sage extract was a complex procedure in terms of 
extract distribution between separators operating at various pressure and 
temperature conditions. It was also proved by testing the AA of the extracts in 
rapeseed oil. The effect of the extracts on the rapeseed oil weight gain varied 
in a wide range (from 'very low' to 'high') depending on the fractionation 
conditions. Preliminary results showed that to obtain more effective antioxidant 
fractions separation steps should be started at 10 MPa lower pressure than that 
used for the extraction.

The differences in chemical and sensory characteristics between Marselan and 
Cabernet Sauvignon in China were investigated with gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography-triple 
quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-QqQ-MS/MS), combined with color parameters 
and sensory data. The paired t-test results showed that terpenoids, higher 
alcohols, and aliphatic lactones were significantly different according to the 
grape variety. Meanwhile, terpenoids could be considered as marker aroma 
compounds to distinguish Marselan wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, which could 
explain the distinct floral note in Marselan wines. The mean concentrations of 
the mv-vsol, mv-vgol, mv-vcol, mvC-vgol, mv-v(e)cat, mvC-v(e)cat, mv-di(e)cat, 
and cafA were higher in Marselan wines than Cabernet Sauvignon wines, and these 
compounds might confer Marselan wines with a deeper color, more red hue, and 
higher tannin quality. The phenolic profiles of Marselan and Cabernet Sauvignon 
wines were influenced by the winemaking process, mitigating the varietal 
differences. As for sensory evaluation, the intensities of herbaceous, oak, and 
astringency of Cabernet Sauvignon were more pronounced than Marselan, whereas 
the Marselan wines were characterized by a high color intensity and more 
redness, together with floral, sweet, and roasted sweet potato attributes, and 
tannin roughness.

The plant Rhodiola rosea L. of family Crassulaceae was extracted using the 
supercritical CO2-extraction method. Several experimental conditions were 
investigated in the pressure range of 200-500 bar, with the used volume of 
cosolvent ethanol in the amount of 1% in the liquid phase at a temperature in 
the range of 31-70°C. The most effective extraction conditions are pressure 350 
bar and temperature 60°C. The extracts were analyzed by HPLC with MS/MS 
identification. 78 target analytes were isolated from Rhodiola rosea (Russia) 
using a series of column chromatography and mass spectrometry experiments. The 
results of the analysis showed a spectrum of the main active ingredients Rh. 
rosea: salidroside, rhodiolosides (B and C), rhodiosin, luteolin, catechin, 
quercetin, quercitrin, herbacetin, sacranoside A, vimalin, and others. In 
addition to the reported metabolites, 29 metabolites were newly annotated in Rh. 
rosea. There were flavonols: dihydroquercetin, acacetin, mearnsetin, and 
taxifolin-O-pentoside; flavones: apigenin-O-hexoside derivative, tricetin 
trimethyl ether 7-O-hexosyl-hexoside, tricin 7-O-glucoronyl-O-hexoside, tricin 
O-pentoside, and tricin-O-dihexoside; flavanones: eriodictyol-7-O-glucoside; 
flavan-3-ols: gallocatechin, hydroxycinnamic acid caffeoylmalic acid, and 
di-O-caffeoylquinic acid; coumarins: esculetin; esculin: fraxin; and lignans: 
hinokinin, pinoresinol, L-ascorbic acid, glucaric acid, palmitic acid, and 
linolenic acid. The results of supercritical CO2-extraction from roots and 
rhizomes of Rh. rosea, in particular, indicate that the extract contained all 
biologically active components of the plant, as well as inert mixtures of 
extracted compositions.

The aim of the study was to characterize physical and chemical composition of 
four highbush blueberry cultivars (""Bluecrop,"" ""Late Blue,"" ""Chandler,"" and 
""Elliot""). The assessment of ultrasound influence at the osmotic dehydration 
step and during hybrid drying on mass transfer and the nutritional quality of 
all cultivars was also done. The experiment consisted of two stages: (1) 
initial: optimization of osmotic dehydration procedure, (2) the main experiment 
including all stages of dried blueberry production (pretreatment, osmotic 
dehydration chosen in the initial stage, and drying). In both parts, the effect 
of US and cultivar were considered as factors influencing the most important 
quality indices. The osmotic dehydration, in the mixture (1:1) of sucrose 
solution and apple juice concentrate (65°Bx) at a fruit to syrup ratio 1:4, was 
carried out in water bath fitted with ultrasonic transducers (25 kHz, 27.8 W/L) 
at a temperature of 40°C for 150 min. After pretreatment osmo-dehydrated fruits 
were subjected to drying in hybrid (microwave-ultrasound-convective) drum dryer. 
Regardless of the cultivar US had positive influence on mass transfer (up to 22% 
for intact and 12% for mechanically scratched) at the osmotic dehydration stage. 
Unfavorably, its action tend to decrease phenolic compounds content. The final 
effect, however, was strongly influenced by the choice of cultivar. With regard 
to ultrasound applied at the drying step, no explicit effect, either on the 
drying process efficiency or on final product quality, was identified. In the 
same processing conditions ""Elliot"" turned out to be the most promising to 
produce ready-to-eat fruit snacks in terms of the final product stability and 
bioactives content.
PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Hybrid drying was proposed as a novel approach in 
blueberry drying. Ultrasound application as a part of abovementioned drying 
technique is considered an efficient way of shortening drying time due to mass 
transfer intensification and the interaction with dehydrated tissue. However, no 
experiments studying the impact of ultrasound on various cultivars within one 
species were carried out. This study contributes to the understanding that 
appropriate cultivar selection in the production of ready-to-eat dried blueberry 
fruit is just as important as process parameters in obtaining an attractive 
product with a high level of natural bioactive compounds.

A series of kojic acid triazol thiosemicarbazide Schiff base derivatives were 
designed and synthesised. Evaluation on the inhibition of tyrosinase activity 
showed that these compounds possessed potent inhibit tyrosinase activity, and 
the compound 6w (IC50 = 0.94 μM) exhibited the best inhibitory effect. 
Preliminary structure-activity relationships indicate that steric hindrance, 
halogen atom radius, and electron donating ability of functional groups have 
some impact on the inhibition of tyrosinase activity. Inhibition mechanism 
showed that compound 6w is a non-competitive mixed inhibitor, and this result 
was further confirmed by molecular docking. The fluorescence quenching mode of 
compound 6w is dynamic quenching, and interacts with tyrosinase by changing the 
amide structure of tyrosinase. Compound 6w has some anti-browning effect. 
Compound 6p had the strongest DPPH radical scavenging activity 
(IC50 = 10.53 ± 0.014 μM), and compound 6w showed the best ABTS scavenging 
activity (IC50 = 3.03 ± 0.009 μM).

While often recognized as a good plant protein source and a rich source of 
essential nutrients including folate, iron, manganese and phosphorus, lentils 
(Lens culinaris</i> L.) also contain healthful bioactive compounds. They possess 
a number of phenolic compounds including phenolic acids, flavonoids such as 
flavan- 3-ols, flavonols and anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, as well as 
saponins and phytic acid. This review provides a summary of the types and levels 
of phenolic compounds found in the cotyledon of lentils as well as their seed 
coats. The values define broad ranges due to varied cultivars, horticultural 
practices, climatic conditions during lentil development, and the different 
phenolic extraction approaches employed. The prepared lentil extracts were found 
to possess marked antioxidant activity, as assessed by in vitro</i> assays, with 
the results clearly indicating that the endogenous phenolic compounds dictated 
this activity. Processing of raw lentils in the forms of cooking, germination 
and fermentation was determined to affect the phenolics' contents: phenolic 
content of some lentils decreased while those of others increased, most likely 
due to the release of bound phenolics from the plant wall matrix. Finally, a 
summary of some of the positive biological activities observed for lentil 
extracts from cell culture and animal studies is given.

Extracts from rosemary (Salvia Rosmarinus) are analysed for their phytochemistry 
using LC-MS and the phytochemistry identified. The same extracts were tested for 
their efficacy to act as antioxidants by both hydrogen-atom transfer (ORAC) and 
single electron transfer (FRAP). A correlation analysis was performed to 
identify the key phytochemistry responsible for antioxidant efficacy. The top 
performing extracts were then tested in a peptide model and in hair with the 
presence of UV to measure ability to protect against UV-induced peptide and 
protein damage. Polyphenols (e.g. rosmarinic acid, glycosides of selgin) and 
abietane diterpenes (e.g. carnosic acid) in rosemary were identified as the 
principal compounds which enables the extracts to protect hair from UV.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to correlate the phytochemistry of 
rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus), a botanical with known antioxidant properties, to 
a UV protection benefit in hair. These data will give insights into mechanisms 
of UV damage, the ROS formed and their reactivity.
METHODS: LC-MS was used to compare the compounds in 10 commercial extracts of 
rosemary. ORAC (oxygen radical antioxidant capacity) and FRAP (ferric reducing 
antioxidant power) were used to measure the antioxidant capacity of the rosemary 
extracts. The ORAC assay measures ability of an antioxidant to react with a 
peroxyl radical via hydrogen atom extraction and FRAP measures electron transfer 
through reduction of ferric iron (Fe3+ ) to ferrous iron (Fe2+ ) by antioxidants 
present in the samples. Correlation of extract composition with antioxidant 
measures was performed using principal component analysis. Selected extracts 
were assessed for their ability to protect hair from UV damage in a model 
peptide system and on hair. In addition, the same methods were used to test 
rosmarinic acid and carnosic acid, key phytochemistries in the rosemary 
extracts. The model system was a peptide and its decomposition on exposure to UV 
was monitored by LC-MS in the absence and presence of the rosemary extracts. 
Hair degradation in the presence of UV was measured by exposure of UV in an 
Atlas weatherometer followed by extraction of degraded protein in water. A 
fragment of the S100A3 protein was used as a marker of UV damage (m/z = 1278) 
and quantified via LC-MS.
RESULTS: Ten rosemary extracts were assessed for antioxidant performance and 
correlated with their compositions. The phytochemistry in each extract varied 
widely with a total of 33 individual compounds identified. The differences were 
most likely driven by the solvent and extraction method used by the supplier 
with extracts varying in the proportion of polar or non-polar compounds. This 
did influence their reactivity in the ORAC and FRAP assays and their efficacy in 
preventing protein damage. Two of the key compounds identified were rosmarinic 
acid and carnosic acid, with rosmarinic acid dominating in extracts with mainly 
polar compounds and carnosic acid dominating in extracts with mainly nonpolar 
compounds. Extracts with higher rosmarinic acid correlated with ORAC and FRAP 
scores, with UV protection on hair and in the peptide model system. The extracts 
chosen for hair experiments showed hair protection. UV protection was also 
measured for rosmarinic and carnosic acid.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the variation in the profile of phytochemistries in the 10 
rosemary extracts, likely driven by the chosen extraction method, all rosemary 
extracts had antioxidant activity measured. This study suggests that the 
polyphenols (e.g. rosmarinic acid, glycosides of selgin) and abietane diterpenes 
(e.g. carnosic acid) are the principal compounds which enables the extracts to 
protect hair from UV.

Publisher: INTRODUCTION: Les extraits de romarin (Salvia Rosmarinus) sont 
analysés par LC-MS pour établir et identifier leur profil phytochimique. Les 
mêmes extraits ont été testés pour leur efficacité à agir comme antioxydants à 
la fois par transfert d’atome d’hydrogène (ORAC) et par transfert d’électrons 
uniques (FRAP). Une analyse de corrélation a été réalisée pour identifier les 
propriétés phytochimiques clés responsables de l’efficacité antioxydante. Les 
extraits les plus performants ont ensuite été testés dans un modèle peptidique 
et sur les cheveux en présences d’UV pour mesurer la capacité à protéger contre 
les dommages induits par les UV su les peptides et protéines. Les polyphénols 
(par ex. acide rosmarinique, glycosides de selgin) et les diterpènes d’abiétine 
(par ex. acide carnosique) dans le romarin ont été identifiés comme les 
principaux composés permettant aux extraits de protéger les cheveux des UV.
OBJECTIF: L’objectif de ce travail était de mettre en corrélation la phytochimie 
du romarin (Salvia rosmarinus), une plante aux propriétés antioxydantes connues, 
et les bénéfices d’une protection contre les UV dans les cheveux. Ces données 
fourniront des informations sur les mécanismes des dommages causés par les UV, 
la formation du ROS et leur réactivité. MÉTHODES: La LC-MS a été utilisée pour 
comparer les composés de 10 extraits commerciaux de romarin. L’ORAC (Oxygen 
Radical Antioxidant Capacity/Capacité d’absorption des radicaux d’oxygène) et la 
FRAP (Ferric Reduction Antioxidant Power/Pouvoir antioxydant de réduction 
ferrique) ont été utilisés pour mesurer la capacité antioxydante des extraits de 
romarin. Le dosage ORAC mesure la capacité d’un antioxydant à réagir avec un 
radical peroxyl par extraction d’atome d’hydrogène et la FRAP mesure le 
transfert d’électrons par réduction du fer ferrique (Fe3+ ) en fer ferreux (Fe2+ 
) par les antioxydants présents dans les échantillons. La corrélation entre la 
composition de l’extrait et les mesures des antioxydants a été effectuée en 
analysant les composants principaux. Les extraits sélectionnés ont été évalués 
pour leur capacité à protéger les cheveux des dommages causés par les UV dans un 
modèle de système peptidique et sur les cheveux. En outre, les mêmes méthodes 
ont été utilisées pour tester l’acide rosmarinique et l’acide carnosique, 
principales caractéristiques phytochimiques dans les extraits de romarin. Le 
système modèle était un peptide et sa décomposition à l’exposition aux UV a été 
suivie par LC-MS en l’absence et en présence des extraits de romarin. La 
dégradation des cheveux en présence d’UV a été mesurée par l’exposition aux UV 
dans un indicateur de désagrégation Atlas suivi de l’extraction de protéines 
dégradées dans l’eau. Un fragment de la protéine S100A3 a été utilisé comme 
marqueur de dommage UV (m/z = 1278) et quantifié par LC-MS. RÉSULTATS: Dix 
extraits de romarin ont été évalués en termes de performance antioxydante et mis 
en corrélation avec leurs compositions. La phytochimie de chaque extrait variait 
considérablement, avec un total de 33 composés individuels identifiés. Les 
différences étaient très probablement dues à la méthode du solvant et de 
l’extraction utilisée par le fournisseur avec des extraits variant dans la 
proportion de composés polaires ou non polaires. Cela a effectivement influencé 
leur réactivité dans les dosages ORAC et FRAP et leur efficacité dans la 
prévention des dommages protéiques. Deux des composés clés identifiés étaient 
l’acide rosmarinique et l’acide carnosique, l’acide rosmarinique dominant dans 
les extraits contenant principalement des composés polaires et l’acide 
carnosique dominant dans les extraits contenant principalement des composés non 
polaires. Les extraits avec un taux d’acide rosmarinique plus élevé étaient mis 
en corrélation avec les scores ORAC et FRAP, avec une protection UV sur les 
cheveux et dans le système de modèle peptidique. Les extraits choisis pour les 
expériences sur les cheveux ont montré une protection des cheveux. La protection 
contre les UV a également été mesurée pour l’acide rosmarinique et l’acide 
carnosique.
CONCLUSIONS: Malgré la variation des profils phytochimiques dans les dix 
extraits de romarin, probablement induite par la méthode d’extraction choisie, 
l’activité antioxydante de tous les extraits de romarin a été mesurée. Les 
polyphénols (par ex. acide rosmarinique, glycosides de selgin) et les diterpènes 
d’abiétane (par ex. acide carnosique) dans le romarin ont été identifiés comme 
les principaux composés permettant aux extraits de protéger les cheveux contre 
les UV.

This study evaluated the potential of fruit juice processing wastes as a 
prebiotic source and functional food ingredient in probiotic yogurt production. 
Here, it was aimed to demonstrate the prebiotic effect of apricot, peach, apple, 
and grape pomace from fruit juice industry waste in yogurt in vitro by 
determining the composition through microbial short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) 
using gas chromatography. In addition, the effect of these pomaces on the 
quality characteristics of yogurt was investigated. During microbial 
fermentation in yogurt samples to which each fruit pomace was added at different 
ratios, there were gradual significant increases in the amounts of acetate, 
butyrate, and propionate, which are known as short-chain fatty acids and have 
important beneficial effects for colonic microbiota, for all samples (p < 0.05). 
The main monosaccharide observed by monosaccharide analysis was glucose, 
followed by galactose. Microbiological analysis of the probiotic yogurt showed 
that the number of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. 
bulgaricus did not change considerably during storage, and Lactobacillus 
acidophilus made better use of peach and apricot pomace as a prebiotic source. 
Based on the results of the sensory parameters, it can be said that the addition 
of 1% of apple, apricot, and peach grape pomace to yogurt is more liked by 
consumers. This study demonstrated that various fruit pomace fibers that can be 
easily applied to yogurt exhibited positive effects on gut microbiota by 
boosting SCFA. This study yielded significant findings about gut microbiota and 
prebiotic activity, contributing to both prebiotic research and the utilization 
of these components in the food sector.

disposition.

The purpose of this study was to compare intestinal versus hepatic disposition 
of six flavonoids to fully characterize their first-pass metabolism. The 
perfused rat intestinal model and microsomes prepared from rat liver, duodenum, 
jejunum, ileum, and colon were used. The results indicated that isoflavone (12.5 
microM) glucuronidation was highly variable among different microsomes prepared 
from liver or intestine. Comparing to liver metabolism, the intestinal 
metabolism had higher K(m) values (>2-fold). Likewise, the hepatic intrinsic 
clearance (IC, or a ratio of V(max)/K(m)) values of isoflavones were generally 
higher than their intestinal IC values (200-2000% higher), except for prunetin, 
for which the jejunal IC value was 50% higher than its hepatic IC. When 
comparing intestinal metabolism, the results showed that intestinal metabolism 
rates and V(max) values of isoflavones were less when an additional A-ring 
electron-donating group was absent (i.e., daidzein and formononetin). In the rat 
perfusion model using the whole small intestine, genistein (10 microM) was well 
absorbed (77% or 352 nmol/120 min). The first-pass metabolism of genistein was 
extensive, with 40% of absorbed genistein excreted as conjugated metabolites 
into the intestinal lumen. In contrast, the bile excretion of genistein 
conjugates was much less (6.4% of absorbed genistein). In conclusion, intestinal 
glucuronidation is slower in isoflavones without an additional A-ring 
substitution. Perfusion studies suggest that intestine is the main organ for 
genistein glucuronide formation and excretion in rats and may serve as its main 
first-pass metabolism organ.

A novel gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) method was 
developed, using an ion trap mass spectrometer, for the simultaneous 
determination of olive oil bioactive components, elenolic acid, hydroxytyrosol, 
and tyrosol, in rat urine. Samples were analyzed by GC-MS/MS prior to and after 
enzymatic treatment. A solid phase extraction sample pretreatment step with 
greater than 80% analytical recoveries for all compounds was performed followed 
by a derivatization reaction prior to GC-MS/MS analysis. The calibration curves 
were linear for all compounds studied for a dynamic range between 1 and 500 ng. 
The limit of detection was in the mid picogram level for tyrosol and elenolic 
acid (300 pg) and in the low picogram level for hydroxytyrosol (2.5 pg). The 
method was applied to the analysis of rat urine samples after sustained oral 
intake of oleuropein or extra virgin olive oil as a diet supplement.

Oleuropein (OE) is the cardinal bioactive compound derived from Olea europaea 
and possesses numerous beneficial properties for human health. However, despite 
the plethora of analytical methods that have studied the biological fate of 
olive oil-derived bioactive compounds, no validated methodology has been 
published to date for the simultaneous determination of OE, along with all its 
major metabolites. In this study, a liquid chromatography-electrospray 
ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS/MS) method has been developed and 
validated for the quantification of OE, simultaneously with its main metabolites 
hydroxytyrosol, 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid, 
4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methoxy-phenol or homovanillyl alcohol, 
2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid or homovanillic acid, and elenolic acid 
in rat plasma matrix. Samples were analyzed by LC-ESI MS/MS prior to and after 
enzymatic treatment. A solid-phase extraction step with high mean recovery for 
all compounds was performed as sample pretreatment. Calibration curves were 
linear for all bioactive compounds over the range studied, while the method 
exhibited good accuracy, intra- and inter-day precision. The limit of detection 
was in the picogram range (per milliliterof plasma) for HT and OE and in the 
nanogram range (per milliliter of plasma) for the other analytes, and the method 
was simple and rapid. The developed methodology was successfully applied for the 
simultaneous quantification of OE and its aforementioned metabolites in rat 
plasma samples, thus demonstrating its suitability for pharmacokinetics, as well 
as bioavailability and metabolism studies.

A microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) method has been applied for the first time 
to the extraction of the main lignan, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), 
and the two most concentrated hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in flaxseed. The 
effects of microwave power, extraction time and alkaline treatment were 
investigated. It was shown that a 3 min MAE resulted in an SDG content of 
16.1+/-0.4 mg/g, a p-coumaric acid glucoside content of 3.7+/-0.2 mg/g and a 
ferulic acid glucoside content of 4.1+/-0.2 mg/g. These values were compared 
with those obtained using conventional extraction methods and the results 
demonstrated that MAE was more effective in terms of both yield and time 
consumption.

Detailed knowledge about phenolic compounds of Citrus fruits and derived juices 
is important for investigations into Citrus product authentication as well as 
for their potential health benefits. We present an HPLC-DAD-ESI-QTOF-HR-MS/MS 
method for the identification and simultaneous quantitation of more than 50 
compounds ranging from polar phenolic acids over flavonoid glycosides to apolar 
coumarins, psoralens, and polymethoxyflavones in lemon, lime, orange, and 
grapefruit juices. Hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives mainly comprised esters with 
aldaric acids, N-p-coumaroylputrescine, and N-feruloylputrescine. Predominant 
flavonoids were flavone-C- and O-glycosides, flavonol- and 
flavanone-O-glycosides, and polymethoxyflavones. Mass fragmentations of 
flavone-C- and O-glycosides as well as limocitrin glycosides and their acylated 
derivatives carrying malonyl- and/or hydroxymethylglutaryl moieties are 
proposed. The presence of diverse phenolic compounds in juices from four Citrus 
species was confirmed and numerous novel constituents were assigned. Total 
levels of phenolic constituents in the aforementioned Citrus juices are 
presented.

To gain comprehensive insight into the interactions of key coffee odorants, like 
the Strecker aldehydes, acetaldehyde, propanal, methylpropanal, 2- and 
3-methylbutanal, and methional, and the nonvolatile fraction of coffee, an 
untargeted metabolomics approach was applied. Ultra performance liquid 
chromatography (UPLC)-time of flight (TOF)-mass spectrometry (ESI-) profiling 
followed by statistical data analysis revealed a marker substance for a coffee 
beverage spiked with acetaldehyde with an accurate mass of 217.0703 [M - H]-. 
This compound could be identified as a reaction product of quinic acid (QA) and 
acetaldehyde linked by acetalization at the cis-diol function of QA. 
Consequently, the acetalization of aldehydes, QA, 5-O-caffeoyl quinic acid 
(CQA), and quinic acid γ-lactone (QAL) was investigated by means of model 
reactions, followed by synthesis, isolation, and structure elucidation via 
UPLC-TOF-MS and 1D and 2D NMR techniques. UHPLC-MS/MSMRM screening and the 
quantification of aldehyde adducts in coffee beverages revealed the presence of 
QA/acetaldehyde, -/propanal, -/methylpropanal, and -/methional reaction products 
and CQA/acetaldehyde, -/propanal, -/methylpropanal, -/2- and 3-methylbutanal, 
and -/methional and QAL/acetaldehyde adducts for the first time, in 
concentrations of 12-270 μg/L for QA/aldehydes, 5-225 μg/L for CQA/aldehydes, 
and 62-173 μg/L for QAL/acetaldehyde. The sensory characterization of the 
identified compounds showed bitter taste recognition thresholds of 48-297 μmol/L 
for CQA adducts and 658 μmol/L for QAL/acetaldehyde, while the QA adducts showed 
no bitter taste (<2000 μmol/L).

                    Total polyphenols, total anthocyanins, and reduced ascorbic acid were evaluated in berries belonging to the genera Rubus, Ribes, and Aronia by means of spectrophotometric and high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques. The 2,2‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of the fruit extracts was tested. Total polyphenols ranged from 140.6 to 888.5 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW), total anthocyanins ranged from 22.0 to 460.5 mg/100 g FW, and reduced ascorbic acid ranged from 12.4 to 153.8 mg/ 100 g FW. The average EC50 values for Aronia melanocarpa, Ribes nigrum, Ribes rubrum, Rubus fruticosus, and Rubus idaeus were 1.8, 2.8, 5.3, 6.4, and 8.2 mg FW, respectively. The results indicate that the fruits tested are good sources of natural antioxidants.

The variation in flavonoid concentration and composition was investigated in 
baby spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) cv. Emilia sown on three occasions, each 
harvested at three growth stages at 6-day intervals. After harvest, leaves were 
stored in polypropylene bags at 2 or 10 degrees C. Flavonoids were analyzed by 
reversed phase HPLC. Twelve flavonoid peaks were detected. The main flavonoid, 
making up on average 43% of the total flavonoid concentration, was identified as 
5,3',4'-trihydroxy-3-methoxy-6:7-methylenedioxyflavone-4'-glucuronide. Four 
other flavonoids each contributed 7-12% of the total flavonoid content. Total 
flavonoid content was relatively stable during normal retail storage conditions, 
although some of the individual flavonoid compounds showed considerable 
variation. The youngest plants had the highest flavonoid concentration, 
indicating that by harvesting the baby spinach a few days earlier than the 
current commercial stage of harvest, the flavonoid concentration in the product 
may be increased and the content of potentially health-promoting compounds 
enhanced.

Table olives are a major component of the Mediterranean diet and are associated 
with many beneficial biological activities, which are mainly related to their

qualitative composition of table olives in biophenols. The aim of the present 
study was to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant capacity and DNA-protective 
activity of an extract originated from brine samples, according to the Greek 
style debbitering process of Kalamon olive fruits. The main phenolic components 
determined in the brine extract were hydroxytyrosol (HT), verbascoside (VERB) 
and tyrosol (T). The in vitro cell-free assays showed strong radical scavenging 
capacity from the extract, therefore antioxidant potential. At cellular level, 
human endothelial cells (EA.hy296) and murine myoblasts (C2C12) were treated 
with non-cytotoxic concentrations of the brine extract and the redox status was 
assessed by measuring glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid 
peroxidation levels (TBARS). Our results show cell type specific response, 
exerting a hormetic reflection at endothelial cells. Finally, in both cell 
lines, pre-treatment with brine extract protected from H2O2-induced DNA damage. 
In conclusion, this is the first holistic approach highlighted table olive 
wastewaters from Kalamon- Greek style debittering process, as valuable source of 
bioactive compounds, which could have interesting implications for the 
development of new products in food or other industries.

Background/Objectives: Pentacyclic triterpenoids, as bioactive phytochemicals, 
have proven to exhibit significant bioactivity (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
hypoglycemic, and anticancer) and low cytotoxicity. This study developed 
convenient methods for extracting and characterizing a birch bark extract 
enriched in pentacyclic triterpenoids (betulin, betulinic acid, and lupeol) and 
entrapped in two bioavailable nanoformulations. The performance of ATR-FTIR 
spectroscopy as a cost-effective and non-destructive method was evaluated 
comparatively with accurate HPLC-based methods. Methods: The bark extract and 
pure betulin or betulinic acid were used to obtain PEGylated liposomes and nano 
lipid carriers (NLCs). Their size was characterized by light scattering 
diffraction. UV-Vis spectrometry was applied as a preliminary evaluation (1), as 
well as UHPLC-QTOF-ESI+-MS for structure identification (2), ATR-FTIR 
spectroscopy (for semi-quantitative evaluation) (3), and HPLC-DAD for an 
accurate quantification of each component, either in the organic solvents or in 
the nanoformulations (4). Results: The PEGylated liposomes had smaller sizes, 
and higher entrapment efficiency, significantly correlated between the three 
analytical methods. The performance of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was positively 
correlated with HPLC-DAD data and confirmed the potential of this cheaper and 
reliable semi-quantitative method to evaluate the entrapment efficiency of TTs 
in liposome and NLC nanoformulations. Conclusions: The results recommend using 
liposomal nanoformulations for the entrapment of bioactive terpenoids and their 
characterization by ATR-FTIR after validation by HPLC-DAD. The ATR-FTIR 
spectroscopy also offers the possibility of screening in a short time different 
recipes of nanoformulations as well as their stability and bioavailability, 
which is useful for investigations in vitro and in vivo, which may confirm their 
efficacy as therapeutic agents.

All the pea varieties differed significantly (p < 0.05) in their phytic acid 
content. The field pea cultivars had significantly (p < 0.05) higher levels of 
phytic acid and polyphenols than those of vegetable pea varieties. All the 
domestic processing and cooking methods could reduce the contents of phytic acid 
and polyphenols but germination for 48 hours seemed to have a marked lowering 
effect on the levels of these antinutrients in peas.

Research on soybean nutrition is crucial for Chinese agriculture and public 
health, as soybean sprouting enhances its nutritional value. However, the 
relationships between grain quality and soybean varieties are not yet fully 
understood. In this study, the quality of 49 soybean cultivars from 15 different 
origins was evaluated through multiple correlation analysis. Differences were 
observed based on their geographical origin, with Shandong Chongwen showing 
higher calcium and isoflavone levels than the others. A correlation was found 
between protein content and soybean daidzein (0.561***), as well as genistein 
(0.597***). Additionally, sprouting was shown to improve soybean nutrition. 
Among six high-nutrient soybean varieties, increased levels of protein, 
minerals, and isoflavones were observed during germination. Phytic acid and 
oligosaccharide levels decreased by 64.7% and 94.5%, respectively, while saponin 
increased by 106.0%, indicating changes in antinutritional factors. The 
experiment establishes a clear relationship between soybean nutrients and the 
tested variables, highlighting the impact of germination on soybean quality and 
nutrient content.

In the present study, the effects of varying ultrasound treatment durations (5, 
15, 30, and 45 min) applied prior to osmotic dehydration in xylitol solutions on 
apple tissues were investigated. The efficiency of the osmotic dehydration 
process was assessed by analyzing its kinetic parameters. In selected samples of 
osmotically dehydrated fruits, physicochemical properties were evaluated, 
including dry matter content, total acidity, pH, sugar profile, color 
attributes, total phenolic content, antioxidant activity (measured by DPPH and 
ABTS assays), and vitamin C content. Additionally, principal component analysis 
(PCA) was conducted to explore the relationships among the measured variables 
and to identify underlying patterns within the dataset. Osmotic dehydration in 
xylitol significantly modified the physicochemical and antioxidant properties of 
apples, promoting substantial water loss and partial replacement of natural 
sugars with xylitol. The results showed that ultrasound pretreatment markedly 
influenced these effects, with treatment duration playing a critical role. 
Shorter ultrasound applications (15-30 min) enhanced xylitol uptake while better 
preserving antioxidant activity and color, whereas longer ultrasound treatments 
(45 min) achieved greater mass transfer but led to higher losses of bioactive 
compounds compared to untreated samples.

Health-promoting properties such as antioxidative, anticarcinogenic, and 
cholesterol-lowering effects are described for mangiferin and hesperidin, the 
major phenolic compounds present in Cyclopia genistoides (honeybush). However, 
knowledge of their metabolic fate and their absorption from the gastrointestinal 
tract is very limited. The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations 
of mangiferin, hesperidin, and their metabolites in plasma, urine, and feces 
samples from pigs consuming an extract of Cyclopia genistoides. Pigs were 
administered up to 74 mg mangiferin per kilogram of body weight and 1 mg 
hesperidin per kilogram of body weight per day for 11 days. Plasma samples were 
collected at various time points on days 9 and 11 of the study and days 1 and 2 
after termination of extract administration. Urine and feces were collected in 
fractions for 24 hours. In the plasma samples, the aglycone of mangiferin 
(norathyriol) was detected. Mean plasma concentrations ranged from 7.8 to 11.8 
mumol/L. Six metabolites of mangiferin and hesperidin were detected in the 
urine, including methyl mangiferin, norathyriol, its monoglucuronide, 
hesperetin, hesperetin monoglucuronide, and eriodictyol monoglucuronide. Between 
26.0% and 30.8% of the administered dose of hesperidin and only between 1.4% and 
1.6% of mangiferin could be detected in the urine on days 9 and 11 of the study. 
Approximately 8.2% of the administered dose of mangiferin was determined in the 
feces. The main metabolite was norathyriol. Neither hesperidin nor metabolites 
ascribed to hesperidin intake were detected. The results suggest that formation 
of norathyriol from mangiferin occurs in vivo, and specific metabolites were 
identified in blood and excretion products in urine and feces. This study will 
aid in investigating the physiological functions of the parent compounds in 
vivo.

BACKGROUND: Despite decades of research on the relation between soy and breast 
cancer, questions regarding the absorption, metabolism, and distribution of 
isoflavones in breast tissue largely remain unanswered.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the potential health effects of isoflavone consumption 
on normal breast tissue; isoflavone concentrations, metabolites, and 
biodistribution were investigated and compared with 17beta-estradiol exposure.
DESIGN: In this dietary intervention study, healthy women were randomly 
allocated to a soy milk (n = 11; 16.98-mg genistein and 5.40-mg daidzein 
aglycone equivalents per dose), soy supplement (n = 10; 5.27-mg genistein and 
17.56-mg daidzein aglycone equivalents per dose), or control (n = 10) group. 
After a run-in period > or = 4 d, 3 doses of soy milk or soy supplements were 
taken daily for 5 d before an esthetic breast reduction. Blood and breast 
biopsies were collected during surgery and analyzed with liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: After soy administration, genistein and total daidzein concentrations, 
which were expressed as aglycone equivalents, ranged from 135.1 to 2831 nmol/L 
and 105.1 to 1397 nmol/L, respectively, in hydrolyzed serum and from 92.33 to 
493.8 pmol/g and 22.15 to 770.8 pmol/g, respectively, in hydrolyzed breast 
tissue. The major metabolites identified in nonhydrolyzed samples were 
genistein-7-O-glucuronide and daidzein-7-O-glucuronide, with an overall 
glucuronidation of 98%. Total isoflavones showed a breast adipose/glandular 
tissue distribution of 40:60, and their mean (+/-SEM) derived 17beta-estradiol 
equivalents toward estrogen receptor beta were 21 +/- 4-fold and 40 +/- 10-fold 
higher than the 17beta-estradiol concentrations in adipose (0.283 +/- 0.089 
pmol/g, P < 0.001) and glandular (0.246 +/- 0.091 pmol/g, P = 0.001) fractions, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: After intake of soy milk and soy supplements, isoflavones reach 
exposure levels in breast tissue at which potential health effects may occur.

Olive oil is the main source of fat in the Mediterranean diet, and its 
consumption has been related to a low incidence of coronary heart disease and 
certain cancers. Recent findings demonstrate that olive oil phenolics are 
powerful in vitro and in vivo antioxidants and display other biological 
activities that could partially account for the observed healthful effects of 
the Mediterranean diet. A detailed method optimization plan was carried out to 
separate the most popular phenols in olive oil for four separation parameters: 
buffer concentration, buffer pH, applied voltage and temperature. Consequently, 
an analytical method capable of separating 21 different phenols and polyphenols 
by capillary zone electrophoresis was developed; the separation was performed 
within 10 min, using a 40 cm x 50 microm capillary, with a 45 mM sodium 
tetraborate buffer (pH 9.60), at 27 kV and 30 degrees C. The optimized method 
was applied to methanolic extracts of several Italian extra-virgin olive oils 
obtained by different technologies in order to characterize and to compare their 
antioxidant profile. Positive correlations of phenolic compounds found by 
capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and two colorimetric indexes (total 
polyphenols and o-diphenols) were found and discussed.

Phenolic compounds are found in both free and bound forms in cereals. The 
majority is in the insoluble bound form, that is, bound to cell wall material, 
such as ferulic acid and its derivatives. The antioxidant properties of the 
phenolic compounds in grains are associated with the health benefits of grains 
and grain products. The extraction capacity of several solvent mixtures, for 
extracting free phenols from barley flours, and the possibility of employing a 
rapid automated solvent extraction method were studied. The extraction yield of 
each method was evaluated by correlating several spectrophotometric indices 
(absorption at 280, 320, and 370 nm and total phenolic compounds by the 
Folin-Ciocalteu method) with the antioxidant activities of the barley extracts 
(scavenging activity by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl method). Interesting 
results were obtained when ethanol and acetone-based extraction mixtures were 
employed to extract free phenols. A comparison was made between alkaline and 
acid hydrolysis. The extraction yield of bound phenolic compounds increased when 
the digestion time for alkaline hydrolysis was prolonged.

Capillary electrophoresis (CE) can be effectively used as a fast screening tool 
to obtain qualitative and semiquantitative information about simple and complex 
phenolic compounds of extra virgin olive oil. Three simple phenols (tyrosol, 
hydroxytyrosol, and vanillic acid), a secoiridoid derivative (deacetoxy 
oleuropein aglycon), and two lignans (pinoresinol and acetoxypinoresinol) were 
detected as the main compounds in extra virgin olive oils by high-performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). 
Spectrophotometric indices, radical scavenging activity, and oxidative stability 
of extra virgin olive oil samples obtained from olives hand-picked at different 
ripening degrees were statistically correlated with the CZE and HPLC 
quantification. The concentration of phenols in extra virgin olive oil decreased 
with ripeness of olive fruits. The high correlations found between CZE and the 
other analytical results indicate that CE can be applied as a rapid and reliable 
tool to routinely determine phenolic compounds in extra virgin olive oils.

The red grape constituent resveratrol possesses cancer chemopreventive 
properties in rodents. The hypothesis was tested that, in healthy humans, p.o. 
administration of resveratrol is safe and results in measurable plasma levels of 
resveratrol. A phase I study of oral resveratrol (single doses of 0.5, 1, 2.5, 
or 5 g) was conducted in 10 healthy volunteers per dose level. Resveratrol and 
its metabolites were identified in plasma and urine by high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and quantitated by high-performance 
liquid chromatography-UV. Consumption of resveratrol did not cause serious 
adverse events. Resveratrol and six metabolites were recovered from plasma and 
urine. Peak plasma levels of resveratrol at the highest dose were 539 +/- 384 
ng/mL (2.4 micromol/L, mean +/- SD; n = 10), which occurred 1.5 h post-dose. 
Peak levels of two monoglucuronides and resveratrol-3-sulfate were 3- to 8-fold 
higher. The area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) values for 
resveratrol-3-sulfate and resveratrol monoglucuronides were up to 23 times 
greater than those of resveratrol. Urinary excretion of resveratrol and its 
metabolites was rapid, with 77% of all urinary agent-derived species excreted 
within 4 h after the lowest dose. Cancer chemopreventive effects of resveratrol 
in cells in vitro require levels of at least 5 micromol/L. The results presented 
here intimate that consumption of high-dose resveratrol might be insufficient to 
elicit systemic levels commensurate with cancer chemopreventive efficacy. 
However, the high systemic levels of resveratrol conjugate metabolites suggest 
that their cancer chemopreventive properties warrant investigation.

The fate of anthocyanins and ellagitannins in rats was monitored following 
ingestion of raspberry juice. After 1 h low nM concentrations of unmetabolised 
anthocyanins were present in plasma but these declined by 2 h and after 4 h they 
were no longer detectable. For the first 2 h there was an almost full recovery 
of anthocyanins as they passed from the stomach through the duodenum/jejunum and 
into the ileum. After 3 h less than 50% were recovered, and the levels declined 
rapidly thereafter. Excretion of raspberry anthocyanins in urine over a 24 h 
period was equivalent to 1.2% of the amount ingested. Trace quantities of 
anthocyanins were detected in the caecum, colon and faeces and they were absent 
in extracts of liver, kidneys and brain. Urine also contained a number of 
phenolic acids but most were present in quantities well in excess of the 918 
nmol of anthocyanins present in the ingested juice. These findings indicate that 
raspberry anthocyanins per se are poorly absorbed, probably prior to reaching 
the ileum, and that substantial amounts pass from the small to the large 
intestine where they are degraded by colonic bacteria. Ellagitannins disappeared 
in the stomach without accumulation of ellagic acid.

A healthy diet involves eating fruit and vegetables on a daily basis, the 
benefits of which are in part linked to the ingestion of bioactive compounds 
including polyphenols. As a convenient means of delivering additional 
polyphenols to the diet, a polyphenol-rich (P-R) juice drink was prepared and 
the bioavailability of its diverse spectrum of constituents investigated. Ten 
human volunteers followed a low-flavonoid diet for 2 days before drinking 350 mL 
of the P-R beverage. Plasma and urine were collected for 24 h and analyzed by 
HPLC-PDA-MS. The plasma pharmacokinetics and recoveries of urinary metabolites 
of flavan-3-ols, flavanones, dihydrochalcones and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, both 
in terms of their identity and quantity, were, in most instances, not markedly 
different to those reported in other feeding studies with green tea, orange 
juice, apple cider and coffee. This indicates that the combination of 
polyphenolic compounds in the P-R beverage are absorbed and excreted to a 
similar extent whether fed individually or together in a single beverage. It is 
concluded that the P-R beverage can deliver the intended blend of bioavailable 
polyphenols, which would normally require consumption of several different 
plant-derived foods.

How stimulation of the intestinal microbiota may regulate the health-promoting 
effects of dietary polyphenols on liver function has not been fully elucidated. 
Therefore, in this study, we examined whether a combination of 
fructooligosaccharides (FOSs) and a polyphenol preparation (PP) might stimulate 
the intestinal microbiota to increase liver levels of polyphenol-derived 
bioactive compounds. We also investigated how this supplementation affected 
lipid metabolism and antioxidative status in Wistar rats without diet-induced 
metabolic disturbances. Addition of FOSs to the diet with the PP (CPF group) 
considerably reduced the caecal activity of microbial enzymes and elevated the 
production of short-chain fatty acids, mostly propionic acid. The CPF group 
exhibited increased relative abundances of caecal bacteria that were able to 
metabolize polyphenols from the examined preparation. Considerably elevated 
concentrations of ellagic acid, ellagic acid dimethyl ether glucuronide, 
4-hydroxybenzoic acid and methyl cyanidin-3-sophoroside were found in the liver 
in the CPF group. In addition, hepatic downregulation of HIF1α, AHR and SREBP1c, 
which are molecular factors that regulate lipid metabolism and antioxidative 
status, was also found in this group. These changes might explain the 
considerably reduced levels of fat, triglycerides and lipid peroxidation in the 
liver in the CPF group. Moreover, the combination of FOSs and the PP 
considerably elevated the total antioxidant status and activity of superoxide 
dismutase in the blood. To conclude, stimulation of the intestinal microbial 
composition and activity with FOSs increased the health-promoting effects of the 
PP by elevating polyphenolic metabolite levels in the liver and improving lipid 
metabolism and antioxidative status in healthy rats. Therefore, the combination 
of FOSs and polyphenols might be a valuable dietary supplement that is able to 
support preventive healthcare.

Eight avenanthramides, amides of anthranilic acid (1) and 5-hydroxyanthranilic 
acid (2), respectively, and the four cinnamic acids p-coumaric (p), caffeic (c), 
ferulic (f), and sinapic (s) acid, were synthesized for identification in oat 
extracts and for structure-antioxidant activity studies. Three compounds (2p, 
2c, and 2f) were found in oat extracts. As assessed by the reactivity toward 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), all avenanthramides except 1p showed 
activity. Initially, the antioxidant activity of the avenanthramides decreased 
in a similar order as for the corresponding cinnamic acids, that is: sinapic > 
caffeic > ferulic > p-coumaric acid. The avenanthramides derived from 2 were 
usually slightly more active than those derived from 1. All avenanthramides 
inhibited azo-initiated peroxidation of linoleic acid. 1c and 1s were initially 
the most effective compounds. The relative order of antioxidant activities was 
slightly different for the DPPH and the linoleic acid assays run in methanol and 
chlorobenzene, respectively.

We have determined the absorption, conjugation and excretion of 
naringenin-7-O-rutinoside (narirutin) compared to the corresponding glucoside in

eight women), in a double blind, randomised, crossover study, consumed orange

peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 5.4-fold higher (P < 0.0001) and Tmax was 
decreased from 311 to 92 min (P = 0.002) compared to untreated orange juice (1), 
indicating a change in absorption site from the colon to the small intestine. 
Furthermore, the amount in urine was increased from 7 to 47 % (P < 0.0001) of

fortified with three times the original content of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside was 
used. Five hesperetin metabolites (3'-O-glucuronide; 7-O-glucuronide; 
5,7-O-diglucuronide; 3',7-O-diglucuronide; 3'-O-sulphate) were present after all 
treatments (1-3), with the same profile of the conjugates. The present data show 
that bioavailability of naringenin is increased by conversion from rutinoside to 
glucoside, but the profile of the conjugates of flavanones formed and excreted 
in urine is neither affected by the absorption site nor by a 3-fold change in 
dose.

Extraction methods to determine olive oil phenols are not exhaustive. A 
procedure to test their effectiveness, based on the treatment of the extracted 
oil with 2 N HCl followed by analysis of phenols in the aqueous phase, has been 
developed. It was concluded, using this test, that 15-40% of phenols remained 
unextracted when the liquid/liquid extraction method with 80% methanol was 
applied. Solid phase extraction (C(18) cartridge) succeeded in retaining most of 
the phenols in the cartridge, but the recovery yield from the sorbent material 
was low. However, a new extraction method, based on the use of 
N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as an extraction solvent, achieved a complete 
extraction of phenols from oils. The proposed method requires a lower amount of 
oil, solvents, energy, and labor than the traditional ones. Because of the low 
concentration of phenols in the DMF extract, the highly sensitive 
electrochemical detector (EC) technique was studied. All of the phenols detected 
by the traditional UV detectors were also detected by EC using a coulometric 
array system. A rapid and complete analytical methodology of phenols in olive 
oil has been proposed based on coupling DMF extraction and EC detection.

Oranges are rich sources of flavonoids that are bioactive and may protect 
against age-related diseases. The absorption of orange flavanones may be 
affected by factors such as processing and subject anthropometric variables, and 
the bioactivity of the absorbed phytochemicals depends on how they are 
metabolised during absorption. In a randomised cross-over study, twenty subjects 
consumed a single portion of orange fruit (150 g) or juice (300 g) that 
contained the flavanones narirutin and hesperidin, and an additional 109 
subjects across a broad age range (18-80 years) consumed the juice. Flavanone 
metabolites were measured in regularly collected samples of plasma and urine. 
After consumption of fruit or juice, flavanone conjugates, but not the 
aglycones, were detected in plasma and urine. The flavanone conjugates were 
shown to include the 7- and 4'-O-monoglucuronides of naringenin, the 7- and 
3'-O-monoglucuronides of hesperetin, two hesperetin diglucuronides and a 
hesperetin sulfo-glucuronide, but no aglycones or rutinosides. Analysis of the 
plasma pharmacokinetic and urinary excretion data on a dose-adjusted basis 
indicated no difference in absorption or excretion of either flavanone between 
the fruit and juice matrices. In the extended urinary excretion dataset the 
individual variation was very large (range 0-59 % urinary yield). There was a 
small but significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the excretion of hesperetin (but 
not naringenin) with increasing age (P < 0.05), but the effects of sex, BMI and 
contraceptive pill use were shown not to be associated with the variation in 
flavanone excretion.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data showed that tomato and tomato product (sauce, 
paste) consumption is associated with a protective effect against the 
development of some chronic-degenerative diseases. Tomato antioxidant bioactive 
molecules such as carotenoids and polyphenols could be responsible, at least in 
part, for the healthy effect observed. The bioavailability of these compounds is 
an essential requirement to sustain their in vivo role. While it is well known 
that many factors can influence the bioaccessibility of carotenoids from the 
food matrix, there is little information about the factors affecting phenolic 
compounds' bioaccessibility.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This investigation was carried out to evaluate the effect of 
domestic cooking on the bioavailability in humans of antioxidant molecules after 
the administration of a test meal containing cherry tomatoes.
METHODS: A cross-over design was conducted. Subjects (3 females and 2 males) 
consumed experimental meals containing fresh and cooked cherry tomatoes. Blood 
collection was performed at different time intervals (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h).
RESULTS: Carotenoid and phenol plasma concentrations were measured. Plasma 
levels of lycopene and beta-carotene were not significantly different with 
respect to the baseline after ingestion of both the test meals, while plasma 
concentrations of naringenin and chlorogenic acid increased significantly with 
respect to the baseline (P<0.05) after administration of cooked cherry tomatoes, 
but not after administration of fresh cherry tomatoes.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated that domestically cooked tomatoes 
significantly increase naringenin and chlorogenic acid plasma levels. 
Considering that both naringenin and chlorogenic acid are widely studied for 
their potential healthy properties, evidence of their bioavailability and of the 
factors influencing their bioaccessibility is an important tool to sustain the 
possibility that these polyphenols play a biological role in human physiology.

The carotenoid and phenolic acid contents in fresh, stored and processed 
(blanched, frozen and boiled) spinach were comparatively determined by 
spectrophotometric and HPLC analyses. The major carotenoids identified after 
HPLC analysis in saponified samples were lutein (37-53μg/kg), β-carotene 
(18-31μg/kg), violaxanthin (9-23μg/kg) and neoxanthin (10-22μg/kg). These 
carotenoids were all affected by storage and/or heating. The content of 
carotenoids was best preserved after storage for one day at 4°C. The total 
phenolic content in the fresh spinach was 2088mg GAE/kg FW. After LC-MS analysis 
three phenolic acids were identified and quantified. These being ortho-coumaric 
acid (28-60mg/kg FW), ferulic acid (10-35mg/kg) and para-coumaric acid 
(1-30mg/kg) depending on the sample type. After storage of spinach at different 
temperatures (4°C or -18°C) the amount of total phenolic compounds decreased by 
around 20%, while the amount of individual phenolic acids increased by four 
times on average.

Nutritional trials often yield inconsistent results due to the lack of 
standardised study designs, especially when evaluating the health benefits of 
fruits and vegetables. Apple phenolics, linked to various health benefits, have 
particular challenges in human nutritional studies due to compositional changes 
influenced by factors like fruit maturity, growing conditions, tissue type, and 
processing methods. This study applied an 'orchard-to-fork' approach to evaluate 
Monty's Surprise apple phenolics in the skin and flesh, controlling for harvest 
procedures, fruit maturity, and seasonal impact. It further assessed processing 
methods to preserve phenolic content, with the goal of developing a standardised 
material for dietary intervention trials. Monty's Surprise apples were collected 
over two seasons following standardised harvesting protocols and various fruit 
maturity parameters (firmness, starch pattern, and total soluble solids) were 
controlled and measured for various apple sizes. Phenolic content in the skin 
and flesh was analysed with LC-HRAM-MS and compared across seasons. The impacts 
of processing (pureeing, air drying, and slicing) on phenolic content were also 
evaluated. Cold storage for four weeks reduced maturity variability across apple 
sizes. Monty's Surprise apple skin (5270.49 ± 214.95 mg kg-1 FW) had 
significantly (p < 0.0001) higher phenolic concentrations than the flesh (863.69 
± 12.71 mg kg-1 FW), with procyanidins as the main phenolic group. No seasonal 
impact was observed. Pureed apples retained significantly higher phenolics 
compared to sliced or dehydrated samples. Monty's Surprise apple is a rich 
source of health-beneficial phenolics, and pureeing effectively preserves these 
compounds. This study offers guidance for the development of standardised apple 
material for dietary intervention trials to more accurately investigate the 
health benefits of apples.

The polyphenol trans-resveratrol (t-RES) is present as 
t-RES-3-O-beta-D-glycoside, termed piceid, in several plant-derived foods. 
Although data on the metabolism and on in vivo effects of t-RES have been 
reported, quantitative data on the metabolites formed after dietary intake of 
t-RES or piceid are still lacking. In this study, 85.5 mg of piceid per 70 kg of 
body weight (bw) were administered to healthy volunteers in a bolus dose. t-RES 
metabolites formed in plasma and urine were identified and quantified by 
LC-MS/MS, NMR, and HPLC-DAD analysis using chemically synthesized t-RES 
conjugate standards. In addition, the amount of t-RES metabolites bound 
noncovalently to plasma proteins was determined for the first time in humans. 
The metabolites identified and quantified were t-RES-3-sulfate, 
t-RES-3,4'-disulfate, t-RES-3,5-disulfate, t-RES-3-glucuronide and 
t-RES-4'-glucuronide, with t-RES-sulfates being the dominant conjugates in 
plasma and urine. Besides these metabolites, two novel t-RES-C/O-conjugated 
diglucuronides have been identified and quantified in plasma and urine. 
Moreover, it could be shown that up to 50% of the plasma t-RES-3-sulfate, 
t-RES-disulfates, and the novel t-RES-C/O-diglucuronides were bound to proteins. 
Total recovery of the dietary administered piceid in urine ranged between 13.6 
and 35.7%.

This study evaluated the diversity of 68 faba bean accessions grown in the 
Republic of Korea, focusing on variations in antinutrient factors, nutritional 
composition, fatty acids, lipid quality, antioxidant activity, and key 
agronomical traits. All parameters showed significant variations, indicating 
broad genetic diversity. Vicine and convicine were detected in all accessions 
using UHPLC-MS/MS, with their concentrations varying more than threefold. Total 
phenol (1.65-4.38 mg GAE/g), saponin (4.12-9.50 mg DE/g), and tannin 
(1.70-9.47 mg CE/g) contents showed coefficients of variation (CV) above 18.00%. 
Similarly, crude fiber (3.42%-10.85%), dietary fiber (9.18%-25.47%), total 
protein (21.68%-34.40%), and total fat (0.90%-1.99%) contents exhibited wide 
variations (CV > 9.50%). Palmitic acid (15.13%-18.73%) and linoleic acid 
(38.51%-54.93%) were the dominant saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, 
respectively. Antioxidant activities, including DPPH• scavenging activity 
(0.40-2.33 mg AAE/g), ABTS•+ scavenging activity (1.87-7.26 mg TE/g), and ferric 
reducing antioxidant power (0.67-4.94 mg AAE/g) varied significantly, all with 
CVs over 25.00%. Green genotypes exhibited significantly higher tannin, fibers, 
and palmitic and total saturated fatty acids, while yellow genotypes showed 
higher antioxidant activities, total unsaturated fatty acids, and lipid quality 
indices. Cluster and principal component analyses differentiated accessions 
based on their overall biochemical profile. Accession VF050 was identified for 
its low antinutrient content, VF012 and VF004 for distinct antioxidant 
potential, VF062, VF027, and VF012 for lipid quality, VF032, VF009, and VF018 
for high fiber, VF041 and VF057 for high protein, and VF019 and VF027 for 
agronomic performance. These accessions could serve as valuable materials for 
food innovation, crop improvement, and cultivation.

This study explored plasma levels and urinary and fecal excretion of metabolites 
and microbial-derived catabolites over a 24 h period following the ingestion of 
red wine (RWP) or grape seed (GSP) proanthocyanidin-rich extracts by rats. In 
total, 35 structurally-related (epi)catechin metabolites (SREMs) and 5-carbon 
side chain ring fission metabolites (5C-RFMs) (phenyl-γ-valerolactones and 
phenylvaleric acids), and 50 phenolic acid and aromatic catabolites were 
detected after intakes of both extracts. The consumption of the RWP extract, but 
not the GSP extract, led to the appearance of a ∼200 nmol L-1 peak plasma 
concentration of SREMs formed from flavan-3-ol monomers. In contrast, ingestion 
of the GSPs, but not the RWPs, resulted in a substantial increase in 
microbiota-derived 5-carbon side chain ring fission metabolites (5C-RFMs) in 
plasma. 5C-RFMs, along with low molecular weight phenolic catabolites were 
detected in urine after ingestion of both extracts. The GSP and RWP extracts had 
respective mean degrees of polymerisation 5.9 and 6.5 subunits, and the RWP 
extract had an upper polymer size of 21 subunits compared to 44 subunits for the 
GSP extract. The differences in plasma metabolite profiles might, therefore, be 
a consequence of this polydispersity impacting on the microbiota-mediated rates 
of cleavage of the proanthocyanidin subunits and their subsequent metabolism and 
absorption. Urinary excretion of phenolic catabolites indicated that 11% of RWPs 
and 7% for GSPs were subjected to microbial degradation. In all probability 
these figures, rather than representing the percentage of proanthocyanidins that 
are completely degraded, indicate partial cleavage of monomer subunits producing 
a much higher percentage of shortened proanthocyanidin chains. Obtaining more 
detailed information on the in vivo fate of proanthocyanidins is challenging 
because of the difficulties in analysing unabsorbed parent proanthocyanidins and 
their partially degraded flavan-3-ol subunit chains in feces. Further progress 
awaits the development of improved purification and analytical techniques for 
proanthocyanidins and their use in feeding studies, and in vitro fecal and 
bacterial incubations, with radio and/or stable isotope-labelled substrates.

PURPOSE: The flavones apigenin and tricin, which occur in leafy vegetables and 
rice bran, respectively, possess cancer chemopreventive properties in 
preclinical rodent models. Their pharmacology is only poorly understood. We 
compared their tissue levels in mice in vivo and their metabolism in liver 
fractions in vitro.
METHODS: Mice received apigenin or tricin (0.2%) with their diet for 5-7 days, 
and flavone levels were compared in the plasma, liver and gastrointestinal 
mucosa using HPLC-UV. Flavone metabolism was investigated in murine and human 
liver microsomes or cytosol in vitro co-incubated with uridine 
5'-diphosphoglucuronic acid or 3'-phosphoadenosine-5' phosphosulfate. Flavone 
metabolites were characterized by on-line HPLC-mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: After dietary administration of flavones for 7 days, levels of tricin 
in plasma, liver and mucosa exceeded those of apigenin by 350, 33 and 100%, 
respectively. Apigenin was more rapidly glucuronidated than tricin in liver 
microsomes, whilst tricin underwent swifter sulfonation than apigenin in liver 
cytosol. For either flavone the rate of glucuronidation was much faster than 
that of sulfonation. Flavone monoglucuronides and monosulfates were identified 
as metabolites in microsomal and cytosolic incubations, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: When consumed with the diet in mice tricin seems to be more 
available than apigenin in blood and tissues. Differences in their 
glucuronidation may account for their differential availability. Thus tricin may 
have a pharmacokinetic advantage over apigenin. This type of information may 
help decide which flavonoids to select for clinical development.

Although lettuce may provide relatively low levels of antioxidative 
phytochemicals which may contribute to human health, lettuce leaf extracts in 
fact contained compounds with high specific peroxyl radical scavenging 
activities. After determining the extraction conditions that minimized phenolic 
oxidation and produced the highest oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) 
values, the phenolic compounds from red leaf lettuce were separated by 
reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The primary 
phenolic compounds in the leaf tissue extracts were mono- and dicaffeoyltartaric 
acid (CTA and DCTA), mono- and dicaffeoylquinic acid (CQA and DCQA), quercetin 
3-malonylglucoside (QMG), quercetin 3-glucoside (QG), cyanidin 
3-malonylglucoside (CMG), and an unknown phenolic ester (UPE). Significant 
levels of DCQA were only found after wounding. Using the new fluorescein-based 
ORAC assay procedures, fractions from the HPLC analyses were assayed for peroxyl 
radical absorbance capacity. Using absorbance to estimate concentration, the 
decreasing order of contribution to the total ORAC value of an extract from 
wounded tissue was QMG > DCQA > CMG > DCTA > UPE > QG > CTA. The decreasing 
order of the specific peroxyl radical scavenging activities was CMG > QG > DCTA 
> DCQA > QMG > UPE > CQA > CTA. Since the concentrations of plant flavonoid and 
phenolic acid esters are sensitive to environmental factors, this information 
may be used to develop pre- and postharvest conditions which increase the 
dietary benefits of leaf lettuce.

Among the secondary metabolites which are widely distributed in plants and foods 
in plant origin flavonoids is important one. Flavonoids have antioxidant 
activities as free radical scavenging action. They also have anti-inflammatory, 
antiulcer and anti-carcinogenic activities. Diosmin and hesperidin, the 
metabolites of which are diosmetin and hesperitin respectively are considered in 
the present study. Diosmetin has anticancer, antioxidant and blood lipid 
lowering activities. It also enhances venous tone and microcirculation and by 
reducing systemic oxidative stress it protects capillaries. Hesperitin also has 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, blood lipid and cholesterol lowering, 
anti-carcinogenic activities. In the present study efforts were given to develop 
and validate a bioanalytical method for simultaneous estimation of diosmetin and 
hesperitin in human plasma by liquid chromatography electron spray ionization 
mass spectrometry with an application to the analysis of plasma samples obtained 
from the comparative pharmacokinetic studies on healthy human volunteers under 
the framework of bioequivalence study. The developed method for simultaneous 
determination and quantification of diosmetin and hesperitin in human plasma was 
validated as per the US-FDA guidelines. The validation parameters found within 
the specified regulatory limit, hence acceptable. The present method also has a 
short run time (6.0 min) and easy extraction process. The developed method was 
found to be simple, specific, highly selective, sensitive and reproducible. This 
was applied for the analysis of the volunteer plasma samples. On the basis of 
comparison of the AUC0-t, the relative bioavailability of the test preparation 
was found 100.94 and 95.09% for diosmetin and hesperitin respectively of that of 
the reference preparation.

BACKGROUND: Anthocyanins are potent antioxidants that are widely distributed in 
fruit, vegetables, and red wines. Anthocyanin products are also prescribed as 
medicines in many countries for treating various diseases. However, the 
pharmacokinetics of dietary anthocyanins are not known in humans because these 
glycosides were long considered nonabsorbable.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether anthocyanins can 
be absorbed as glycosides and to evaluate their pharmacokinetics in humans.
DESIGN: Four healthy elderly women consumed 720 mg anthocyanins. A series of 
blood and urine samples were collected before and after consumption of the 
anthocyanins. Anthocyanins were measured in plasma and urine by combining an 
octadecylsilane solid-phase extraction for sample preparation and an HPLC system 
with diode array for anthocyanin separation and detection. The structures of 
anthocyanins as glycosides in plasma and urine were further confirmed by using 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Anthocyanins were detected as glycosides in plasma and urine. The 
maximum plasma concentration of total anthocyanins varied from 55.3 to 168.3 
nmol/L, with an average of 97.4 nmol/L, and was reached within 71.3 min. The 
elimination of plasma anthocyanins appeared to follow first-order kinetics. The 
elimination half-life of plasma total anthocyanins was calculated to be 132.6 
min. Most anthocyanin compounds were excreted in urine during the first 4 h. The 
excretion rate of total anthocyanins was 77 microg/h during the first 4 h and 13 
microg/h during the second 4 h.
CONCLUSION: Anthocyanins are absorbed in their unchanged glycated forms in 
elderly women.

Various protein-rich foods are traditionally immersed in virgin olive oil (VOO), 
a medium rich in phenols, which are health-promoting and sensorially important 
compounds. Immersing tofu in VOO may modify the sensory properties and 
nutritional value of both due to the oil's hydrophilic phenol interactions with 
proteins and water. In this study, cubes of fresh tofu (T) (70% water) and 
freeze-dried tofu (FD-T) (5% water) were immersed in VOO for 7 days of cold 
storage. The changes in the phenolic compound content and standard quality 
parameters of the oil were noted after 1, 3, 5, and 7 days of contact with the 
tofu. The total phenols in the oil were determined using the Fast Blue BB assay, 
while single phenols were analyzed by HPLC-UV/VIS. During the 7 days, the total 
phenols in the oil decreased by up to 56% and 26% under the influence of fresh 
and freeze-dried tofu, respectively, including a significant decrease in 
hydroxytyrosol, oleacein, tyrosol, and oleocanthal. The water content and its 
release from fresh tofu significantly contributed to this decline. The 
degradation of the quality of the oil in contact with the fresh tofu was 
observed only in its sensory properties, with a marked reduction in the 
intensity of its fruitiness, bitterness and pungency.

French wines are abundant sources of phenolic compounds. The content of several 
catechins, i.e., (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4, 
trimers C1, and trimer 2 (T2), of 160 French wines was determined by HPLC with 
UV detection. Red wines (n = 95) were found to have high levels of catechins, 
ranging from 32.8 to 209.8 mg/L (mean concentration 114.5 mg/L) for 
(+)-catechin, from 22.1 to 130.7 mg/L (mean concentration 75.7 mg/L) for 
(-)-epicatechin, from 7.8 to 39.1 mg/L (mean concentration 25.4 mg/L) for B1, 
from 18.3 to 93 mg/L (mean concentration 47.4 mg/L) for B2, from 21.4 to 215.6 
mg/L (mean concentration 119.6 mg/L) for B3, from 20.2 to 107.2 mg/L (mean 
concentration 81.9 mg/l) for B4, from 8.6 to 36.9 mg/L (mean concentration 26.3 
mg/L) for C1, and from 26.7 to 79.3 mg/L (mean concentration 67.1 mg/L) for T2. 
White and rosé wines (n = 57 and n = 8) were found to have low levels of 
(+)-catechin (mean concentrations 9.8 and 10.6 mg/L, respectively) and 
(-)-epicatechin (mean concentrations 5.3 and 6.5 mg/L, respectively). These data 
provide a basis for the epidemiological evaluation of catechin intake by the 
consumption of French wine.

A capillary zone electrophoresis method has been carried out to determine and 
quantitate some compounds of the polyphenolic fraction of virgin olive oil which 
have never previously been determined before using capillary electrophoresis, 
such as elenolic acid, ligstroside aglycon, oleuropein aglycon, and 
(+)-pinoresinol. The compounds were identified using standards obtained by 
semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A detailed method 
optimization was performed to separate the phenolic compounds present in olive 
oil using a methanol-water extract of Picual extra-virgin olive oil, and 
different extraction systems were compared (C18-solid phase extraction (SPE), 
Diol-SPE, Sax-SPE and liquid-liquid extraction). The optimized parameters were 
30 mM sodium tetraborate buffer (pH 9.3) at 25 kV with 8 s hydrodynamic 
injection, and the quantitation was carried out by the use of two reference 
compounds at two different wavelengths.

Ophiocordyceps sinensis represents a valuable medicinal resource. In this study, 
mechanisms underlying differences in chemical composition and antioxidant 
capacity among wild O. sinensis (GL), artificially cultivated O. sinensis (RG), 
and product of O. sinensis ""Bailing"" capsules (BL) were systematically 
investigated via in vitro antioxidant capacity assays and untargeted 
metabolomics. Results showed GL exhibited the highest total phenol (TPS) content 
and superior free radical scavenging activity. Additionally, superoxide 
dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities in RG were higher than those in 
BL. Correlation analysis of antioxidant indices demonstrated significant 
positive correlations between total phenols (TPS) and flavonoids (TF) with DPPH 
radical scavenging, ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), hydroxyl 
radical scavenging rate, and superoxide anion radical scavenging rate (p < 
0.01). A total of 6729 metabolites were detected, encompassing amino acids and 
their derivatives, lipids, and nucleotides and their derivatives, among other 
classes. Furthermore, metabolites exhibited distinct intergroup separation, 
indicating significant differences in metabolic profiles between O. sinensis and 
its substitute products. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that differential 
metabolites were mainly enriched in amino acid, lipid, and nucleotide metabolic 
pathways, among which the linoleic acid metabolic pathway was significantly 
downregulated. Key metabolites included γ-linolenic acid, 12(13)-EpOME-d, 
9-HpODE, etc. Additionally, results of correlation analysis revealed that 
differential metabolites of lipids, nucleotides, and amino acids exhibited a 
significant positive correlation with antioxidant indices (p < 0.05). These 
findings suggest that the antioxidant capacity of O. sinensis and its 
substitutes may be regulated via linoleic acid metabolism, providing a 
theoretical basis for advancing targeted functional development of O. sinensis 
and its substitute products.

Common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are a nutritionally valuable crop with high 
levels of bioactive compounds, including phenolics with antioxidant and 
antibacterial properties. However, the functional potential of local Chilean 
landraces remains underexplored. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) can 
influence plant metabolism, enhancing the accumulation of secondary metabolites. 
This study evaluates the effect of PGPB (Bacillus proteolyticus Cyn1, Bacillus 
safensis Cyn2, and their consortium) on the total phenolic content (TPC), 
antioxidant capacity, and antibacterial activity of extracts from the Chilean 
landrace 'Sapito'. For this, 'Sapito' bean seeds were inoculated with individual 
PGPB strains and their consortium and cultivated under field conditions. 
Extracts from the seed coat and cotyledons were obtained using water, ethanol, 
and acetone. TPC was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu method, antioxidant 
activity was assessed via DPPH, ABTS, H₂O₂ scavenging, ferrous ion chelation, 
and FRAP assays, while antibacterial activity was evaluated through agar 
diffusion, growth inhibition, and cell viability assays against Gram positive 
Bacillus cereus and Gram negative Pseudomonas putida. PGPB inoculation 
significantly influenced TPC, with consortium-treated seeds accumulating higher 
phenolic content in aqueous extracts (95.9 ± 27.8 mg GAE/100 g dry seed). 
Antioxidant activity varied across treatments and solvents, with ethanolic and 
acetone extracts displaying the highest radical scavenging activities. 
Antibacterial assays revealed that ethanolic seed coat extracts exhibited 
stronger inhibition against B. cereus. In conclusion, this is the first study 
evaluating the impact of PGPB on the functional properties of a Chilean common 
bean landrace. The findings highlight the potential of microbial inoculation to 
enhance phenolic accumulation and bioactivity, supporting sustainable 
agriculture, food security, and germplasm conservation in the face of climate 
change.

Olives are very rich in phenolic compounds with important health-promoting 
properties. The profile and content of phenols in olive pulp and virgin olive 
oil are strongly influenced by the fruit ripening degree, but little is known 
concerning the evolution of phenolic compounds in the seed. In this work, the 
phenolic composition of seed from Tuscan cultivars (Frantoio, Moraiolo, Leccino) 
was studied over maturation. Starting from each seed sample, a phenolic extract 
was prepared and analyzed by HPLC-DAD-MS. Nüzhenide and nüzhenide 11-methyl 
oleoside were by far the most abundant phenolic compounds; their content reached 
up to 46 g/kg in dry seeds, although this diminished in the final stage of fruit 
maturation. At the same time, the phenolic composition of the pulp was also 
characterized over the course of maturation, showing that oleuropein was by far 
the most abundant compound, with concentrations comparable to those of nüzhenide 
and nüzhenide 11-methyl oleoside in the seeds. Overall, the total amount of 
phenols in seed dry extracts was significant, reaching approx. 100 g/kg. The 
chemically characterized dry phenolic extracts from seeds could be used for 
future biological assays aimed at evaluating the potential bioactivities of 
these phytocomplexes.

The capabilities of spectrophotometric and electrochemical detection techniques 
were investigated for the high-performance liquid chromatographic determination 
of flavonoids. Liquid chromatographic analyses were performed on eleven 
compounds belonging to three different classes of flavonoids: flavanone 
glycosides, flavone and flavonol aglycones. Separation of all compounds examined 
was carried out under reversed-phase conditions on a C18 narrow-bore column for 
UV detection, whereas for electrochemical detection, a C18 standard-bore column 
was used. UV analyses were carried out at 280 nm for flavanones and at 265 nm 
for flavones and flavonols, whereas controlled-potential coulometric 
measurements were performed using a porous graphite electrode. Analytical 
performances of the methods were compared in terms of linearity, limits of 
detection (LODs) and precision. Linearity over two orders of magnitude and LODs 
at low-ppm levels (0.06-1 mg/l) were demonstrated for all techniques considered. 
Instrumental precision in terms of relative standard deviation was found to be 
between 0 and 5% for the liquid chromatography (LC)-UV system and between 0.6 
and 10% for the LC-electrochemical detection (ED) system. The methods developed 
were applied to the analysis of flavanones and flavonols in a real sample, such 
as an extract of orange juice. Even though quercetin glycoside is mostly present 
in orange juice as rutin, other different glycosides of this flavonol could be 
present; on this basis, the hydrolysis of all glycosides to aglycone allows one 
to obtain more accurate data on the flavonol concentration in orange juice. To 
avoid sample degradation and to increase extraction efficiency, quercetin 
hydrolysis was optimized using a central composite design to investigate the 
effects of acid concentration and hydrolysis time on extraction recovery.

The present study aims first to compare the antioxidant microconstituent 
contents between organically and conventionally grown tomatoes and, second, to 
evaluate whether the consumption of purees made of these tomatoes can 
differently affect the plasma levels of antioxidant microconstituents in humans. 
When results were expressed as fresh matter, organic tomatoes had higher vitamin 
C, carotenoids, and polyphenol contents (except for chlorogenic acid) than 
conventional tomatoes. When results were expressed as dry matter, no significant 
difference was found for lycopene and naringenin. In tomato purees, no 
difference in carotenoid content was found between the two modes of culture, 
whereas the concentrations of vitamin C and polyphenols remained higher in 
purees made out of organic tomatoes. For the nutritional intervention, no 
significant difference (after 3 weeks of consumption of 96 g/day of tomato 
puree) was found between the two purees with regard to their ability to affect 
the plasma levels of the two major antioxidants, vitamin C and lycopene.

High-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) coupled 
with electronspray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to detect the flavonoid 
profile in lemon juices obtained from the main Sicilian cultivars (Femminello 
comune, Monachello, and Interdonato). Significant amounts of an unusual 
constituent were found in the lemon juice of the above-mentioned cultivars 
together with eriocitrin, hesperidin, and diosmin. Following purification by 
preparative HPLC, the structure was assigned as 6,8-di-C-glucopyranosyldiosmetin 
by means of DAD-UV, ESI-MS-MS, and (1)H NMR analysis. Three other minor 
components were also detected. One of these presented a flavone nature, and 
spectral data and literature references both suggested a 
6,8-di-C-glucopyranosylapigenin structure. The different contents of eriocitrin, 
hesperidin, diosmin, and above minor components in the cultivars allow juices to 
be readily differentiated.

A clinical study was conducted to investigate the dose response and metabolism 
of strawberry anthocyanins. In a crossover study design, 12 healthy adults 
consumed each of 3 strawberry treatments. The treatments were 100 g, 200 g, and 
400 g of pureed strawberries, delivering 15 micromol, 30 micromol, and 60 
micromol anthocyanin, respectively. Urine samples were collected for 24 h after 
each dose and samples were analyzed by HPLC with diode array detection and ion 
trap MS. Pelargonidin 3-glucoside was the major anthocyanin form in the 
treatments, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside and 3 metabolites of pelargonidin 
3-glucoside (detected as monoglucuronides) were excreted in urine after 
ingestion. One predominant monoglucuronide form was detected in urine in masses 
10-fold higher than the other 2 monoglucuronide forms. Increasing dose resulted 
in increasing appearance of anthocyanins in urine, and the mass of each 
pelargonidin monoglucuronide increased in urine with increasing dose. These 
results suggest that pelargonidin 3-glucoside absorption and metabolism are not 
saturated at masses < or = 60 micromol, thus showing that more strawberry 
anthocyanin can be absorbed with increasing dose.

Alginate oligosaccharide (AOS) is a bioactive carbohydrate known for its 
preservation properties. However, the efficacy of preharvest AOS treatment in 
maintaining the postharvest quality of hardy kiwifruit (Actinidia arguta) has 
not been previously reported. This study explores the effects of preharvest AOS 
treatment (80 mg L-1) on A. arguta fruit, assessing visual quality, 
physiological attributes, aroma, and antioxidant capacity during refrigeration 
and shelf life. Results showed that AOS treatment maintained higher lightness, 
chroma, firmness, and antioxidant levels (total phenolics, flavonoids, ascorbic 
acid, and glutathione), along with antioxidant enzyme activities (peroxidase, 
catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase). Specifically, AOS-treated fruit had 9% 
higher chroma and double the firmness after 60 days of refrigeration. AOS 
treatment reduced ripening and senescence, with 25% lower soluble solids 
content, 22% lower respiration rate, 30% lower ethylene production, and 35% 
lower malondialdehyde content. Electronic nose analysis indicated that AOS 
treatment suppressed changes in fruit aroma and off-odor development, 
maintaining significantly higher quality during the shelf life period. These 
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AOS as a sustainable method to extend 
shelf life and preserve the quality of A. arguta fruit, enhancing its market 
value and consumer appeal. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The research on using alginate 
oligosaccharides (AOS) for preharvest treatment of hardy kiwifruit (Actinidia 
arguta) has practical applications in the food industry. By extending the shelf 
life and preserving the quality of the fruit during storage, this method can 
help reduce postharvest losses and improve the market value and consumer appeal 
of A. arguta fruit. This sustainable preservation technique offers an 
eco-friendly alternative to traditional methods, enhancing the freshness and 
nutritional quality of the fruit available to consumers.

In this study the main chemical parameters, ascorbic acid and polyphenol 
content, and antioxidant activity of two varieties of prunes, dried by 
high-temperature (85 + 70 degrees C) and low-temperature (60 degrees C) 
procedures, were monitored during storage. Ascorbic acid content was higher in 
the prunes dried at 60 degrees C but significantly decreased in both varieties 
during storage. The different classes of polyphenols analyzed (cinnamates, 
anthocyanins, flavonols) showed different stabilities during storage. 
Neochlorogenic acid decreased only in the President variety, whereas chlorogenic 
acid increased in both varieties; anthocyanins, present only in the President 
prunes, disappeared in the first months of storage, and the flavonol content 
fell significantly in both cultivars during the year of the study. Drying 
temperature significantly affected the polyphenol content, with different 
effects according to the class of polyphenols. Antioxidant activity showed a 
significant increase at the end of the storage period and in the President 
variety was higher in the sample dried at the higher temperature.

A sensitive, rapid, efficient, and reliable method for the separation and 
determination of phenolic acids by capillary zone electrophoresis has been 
carried out. A detailed method optimization was carried out to separate 14 
different compounds by studying parameters such as pH, type and concentration of 
buffer, applied voltage, and injection time. The separation was performed within 
16 min, using a 25 mM sodium borate buffer (pH 9.6) at 25 kV with 8 s of 
hydrodynamic injection. With this method and using a liquid-liquid extraction 
system, with recovery values around 95%, it has been possible to detect small 
quantities of phenolic acids in olive oil samples. This is apparently the first 
paper showing the quantification of this specific family of phenolic compounds 
in virgin olive oil samples.

Fourteen phenolic acids have been selectively determined in olive-oil samples 
using the co-electrosmotic capillary electrophoresis mode with UV detection 
after the LLE extraction system. A polycationic surfactant (hexadimetrine 
bromide, HDB), which dynamically coats the inner surface of the capillary and 
causes a fast anodic electroosmotic flow, was added to the electrolyte. The main 
factors affecting co-electroosmotic flow (EOF) such as type of modifier, 
concentration, and influence of organic solvents have been studied. Other 
parameters such as pH, type, and concentration of buffer, applied voltage, and 
injection time were also optimised using hydrodynamic injection for 8 s and UV 
detection at 210 nm. The composition optimum of the running buffer used was a 
20% 2-propanol, 0.001% HDB, and 50 mM sodium borate at a pH value of 9.6. The 
method has been applied to determination and quantification of fourteen phenolic 
acids at ppb levels in olive oil samples after a liquid-liquid extraction.

Coffee pulp is a by-product characterized by its richness in phenolic compounds. 
This study examined the catabolism of (poly)phenols in digested coffee pulp 
flour (CPF) and extract (CPE) during in vitro colonic fermentation. After a 
simulated gastrointestinal digestion, samples were fermented using human 
microbiota and (poly)phenol transformations were analyzed by UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS. 
Digested CPF and CPE contained high amounts of phenolic acids, notably 
3',4'-dihydroxycinnamic (99.7-240.1 μmol 100 g-1) and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid 
(174.1-491.4 μmol 100 g-1). During the in vitro fecal fermentation, 
phenylpropanoic acids (1.5- to 2.6-fold), phenyl-γ-valerolactones (1.3- to 
23-fold), phenylvaleric acids (1.1- to 2-fold) and benzene derivatives 
(1.5-fold) increased; while benzoic and cinnamic acids, cinnamoylquinic 
derivatives, flavonols, benzaldehydes and diphenylpropan-2-ols decreased. The 
(poly)phenols in CPF were catabolized more slowly than in CPE, suggesting 
protection of the fibrous matrix against phenolic degradation. Coffee pulp may 
be a promising food ingredient rich in (poly)phenols contributing to the 
prevention of intestinal diseases.

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a known source of antioxidants, such as 
phenolic compounds, useful in the prevention of non-infectious diseases 
(atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, and other diseases). In the present study, 
EVOO obtained using an innovative ultrasounds-based technology was found richer 
in total polyphenols, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, than EVOO obtained using a 
conventional mechanical technology. The urinary excretion in humans of 
hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, after the administration of ultrasounds and 
mechanical EVOOs, respectively, was assessed and compared. The analytes were 
determined in urine samples, collected for 24 h, of six healthy people (3 men 
and 3 women, age 22-70 years and body mass index <30 kg/m2) who ingested 20 g of 
oil for six consecutive days. A commercial refined olive oil was also used in 
the study to determine the baseline excretion levels of the two metabolites. 
High correlation coefficients (≥0.9311) were found between the amounts of the 
analytes ingested daily with EVOOs and those determined in the 24-h urines. The 
results clearly indicated that the EVOO obtained with the ultrasound process was 
characterized by the highest concentration of biophenols which were consequently 
available in greater quantities after ingestion, indicating that it represents a 
high-quality product containing high levels of beneficial compounds such as 
biophenols readily assimilable by the human body.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Punicalagin is an antioxidant ellagitannin of pomegranate 
juice. This compound is responsible for the high antioxidant activity of this 
juice. Nothing is known about the bioavailability and metabolism of punicalagin 
or other food ellagitannins. The present work aims to evaluate the 
bioavailability and metabolism of punicalagin in the rat as an animal model.
DESIGN: Two groups of rats were studied. One fed with standard rat diet (n = 5) 
and another with the same diet plus 6 % punicalagin (n = 5). Samples of urine 
and faeces were taken during 37 days and plasma every week. The different 
metabolites were analysed by HPLC-MS-MS.
RESULTS: The daily intake of punicalagin ranged from 0.6 to 1.2 g. Values around 
3-6 % the ingested punicalagin were excreted as identified metabolites in faeces 
and urine. In faeces, punicalagin is transformed to hydrolysis products and 
partly metabolites by the rat microflora to 6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one 
derivatives. In plasma, punicalagin was detected at concentrations around 30 
microg/mL, and glucuronides of methyl ether derivatives of ellagic acid were 
also detected. 6H-Dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one derivatives were also detected 
especially during the last few weeks of the experiment. In urine, the main 
metabolites observed were the 6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one derivatives, as 
aglycones or glucuronides.
CONCLUSION: As only 3-6 % of the ingested punicalagin was detected as such or as 
metabolites in urine and faeces, the majority of this ellagitannin has to be

non-analysed tissues, however with only traces of punicalagin metabolites being 
detected in liver or kidney. This is the first report on the absorption of an 
ellagitannin and its presence in plasma. In addition, the transformation of 
ellagic acid derivatives to 6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one derivatives in the rat is 
also confirmed.

Ellagitannins (ETs) are dietary polyphenols, containing ellagic acid (EA) 
subunits, with antioxidant and cancer chemopreventive activities that might 
contribute to health benefits in humans. However, little is known about their 
metabolic fate. We investigate here the metabolism of different dietary ETs and 
EA derivatives in humans. Forty healthy volunteers were distributed in four 
groups. Each group consumed, in a single dose, a different ET-containing 
foodstuff, i.e., strawberries (250 g), red raspberries (225 g), walnuts (35 g), 
and oak-aged red wine (300 mL). After the intake, five urine fractions (F) were 
collected at 8 (F1), 16 (F2), 32 (F3), 40 (F4), and 56 (F5) h. Neither ETs nor 
EA were detected in urine after LC-MS/MS analysis. However, the microbial 
metabolite 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one (urolithin B) conjugated 
with glucuronic acid was detected along the fractions F3-F5 in all of the 
subjects, independently of the consumed foodstuff. The mean percentage of 
metabolite excretion ranged from 2.8 (strawberries) to 16.6% (walnuts) regarding 
the ingested ETs. Considerable interindividual differences were noted, 
identifying ""high and low metabolite excreters"" in each group, which supported 
the involvement of the colonic microflora in ET metabolism. These results 
indicate that urolithin B (a previously described antiangiogenic and 
hyaluronidase inhibitor compound) is a biomarker of human exposure to dietary 
ETs and may be useful in intervention studies with ET-containing products. The 
antioxidant and anticarcinogenic effects of dietary ETs and EA should be 
considered in the gastrointestinal tract whereas the study of potential systemic 
activities should be focused on the bioavailable urolithin B derivatives.

Stoichiometric and kinetic values of phenolics against DPPH 
(2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) were determined for Andean purple corn (Zea mays 
L.) and red sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas). Both crops had higher antioxidant 
capacity and antiradical kinetics than blueberries and higher or similar 
anthocyanin and phenolic contents. The second-order rate constant (k(2)) was 
1.56, 1.12, 0.57, and 0.26 (mg antiradical/mL)(-1) s(-1) for red sweetpotato, 
Trolox, purple corn, and blueberry, respectively. On the molar basis of active 
hydroxyl groups, k(2)' showed the same order as for k(2). Corn cob and 
sweetpotato endodermis contributed the most in phenolic compounds and 
antioxidant capacity. Both crops studied can be considered as excellent novel 
sources of natural antioxidants for the functional food and dietary supplement 
markets.

Nineteen phenolic compounds including hydroxybenzoic acids, hydroxycinnamic 
acids, flavonoids, phenolic alcohols, and phenolic aldehydes have been 
identified and quantified in two monovarietal champagnes, Chardonnay and Pinot 
Noir, by using a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
system coupled with diode array detection. The identification of four 
hydroxycinnamic tartaric esters (caftaric, coutaric, fertaric, and 
2-S-glutathionylcaftaric acids), two flavanonols (astilbin and engeletin), and 
some other compounds was confirmed by HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry. 
Caftaric acid and tyrosol were the major phenols. Hydroxybenzoic acids and 
flavonoids were present at low concentrations. The phenolic compositions of 2000 
and 2001 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir vary quantitatively according to the year and 
the variety, but the chemical natures of the molecules are the same. The total 
phenolic content determined by colorimetric measurement ranges from 176 to 195 
mg/L of gallic acid equivalent and is similar to that described in white wines.

The antioxidant potential of eight clingstone peach cultivars was investigated 
by determining phenolic compounds and inhibition of low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) oxidation. Cultivars low in polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were also selected to 
minimize enzymatic browning. Inhibition of LDL oxidation varied from 17.0 to 
37.1% in peach flesh extract, from 15.2 to 49.8% in whole peach extract, and 
from 18.2 to 48.1% in peel extract. Total phenols were 432.8-768.1 mg/kg in 
flesh extract, 483.3-803.0 mg/kg in whole extract, and 910.9-1922.9 mg/kg in 
peel extract. The correlation coefficient between relative LDL antioxidant 
activity and concentration of total phenols was 0.76. Peel PPO activity was 
higher than flesh activity in most cultivars. The lowest PPO and specific 
activities were found in the Walgant cultivar, followed by Kakamas and 18-8-23. 
These three cultivars combine the desirable characteristics of strong 
antioxidant activity, low PPO activity, and lower susceptibility to browning 
reactions.

Liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) 
with positive and negative ion detection was used for the identification of 
flavonoids in Hakmeitau beans, a black seed cultivar of cowpea (Vigna sinensis). 
Gradient elution with water and acetonitrile, both containing 2% formic acid, 
was employed in chromatographic separation. The peaks were identified by 
comparison of the retention times and the UV-vis spectroscopic and mass 
spectrometric data with authentic standards and/or literature data. The 
identified flavonoids included six anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-O-galactoside, 
cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, malvidin 3-O-glucoside, 
peonidin 3-O-glucoside, and petunidin 3-O-glucoside) and four flavonol/flavonol 
glycosides (kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, quercetin, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, and 
quercetin 3-O-6' '-acetylglucoside). The tentatively identified flavonoids 
included two anthocyanins (malvidin 3-O-acetylglucoside and peonidin 
3-O-malonylglucoside) and three flavonol glycosides (myricetin-3-O-glucoside, 
quercetin 7-O-glucoside, and quercetin-3-O-diglucoside). These flavonoids are 
present in seed coats, and the contents of anthocyanins and flavonol glycosides 
were 20.7 and 2.0 mg/g, respectively.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) currently lacks effective 
treatments to halt disease progression, making the search for preventive and 
therapeutic drugs a pressing issue. Natural products, with their accessibility, 
affordability, and low toxicity, offer promising avenues. Investigating the 
pharmacological effects and related signaling mechanisms of active components 
from natural products on COPD animal models induced by various triggers has 
become an important focus. In animal models induced by cigarette smoke, 
cigarette smoke combined with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), air pollution, elastase, 
bacterial or viral infections, the active compounds of natural products, such as 
flavonoids, terpenoids, and phenolics, can exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, 
mucus-regulating, and airway remodeling-inhibiting effects through key signaling 
pathways including nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme 
oxygenase-1 (HO-1), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK). These findings not only provide a theoretical basis for 
the clinical diagnosis and treatment of COPD but also point to new directions 
for future scientific research.

Nutritional compounds (phenolic compounds, L-ascorbic acid), antioxidant 
activities, and physicochemical characteristics (fruit weight, dry matter, 
soluble solids, pH, acidity, total and reducing sugars) of 33 different sour 
cherry cultivars were studied. Polyphenols were identified by LC-PDA-QTOF/MS and 
quantified by UPLC-PDA-FL. A total of 41 polyphenolic compounds found were 
identified and presented as 14 flavan-3-ols, 11 anthocyanins, 5 hydroxycinnamic 
acids, 10 flavonols, and 1 flavon. The content of total polyphenols (TPs) ranged 
from 2982.51 ('Wisok' cultivar) to 1539.43 mg/100 g dry weight ('Erdi 
Nagygyϋmϋscu'cultivar). Flavan-3-ols, the major class of sour cherry 
polyphenols, represented ∼ 40% of the TP compounds, whereas anthocyanins and 
hydroxycinnamic acids amounted for about 25% each. The content of l-ascorbic 
acid did not exceed 22.18 mg/100 g fresh matter. Some polish sour cherry 
cultivars (especially 'Agat', 'Ametyst', 'Wider', 'Winer', and 'Wisok') may be 
selected to promote the growth of cultivars with strong nutritional and 
phytochemical beneficial effects on human health.

Sour cherries fruits (Prunus cerasus L., syn P. cerasus var. austera) are 
locally known as ""visciola di Sezze"", due to the name of the city where they are 
traditionally cultivated in Lazio Region, Italy. Fruit samples from three 
harvesting years (June 2019, 2020 and 2021), were submitted to a protocol of 
analyses to detect the bioactive content based on year of harvest, freezing, 
homogenization and thermic treatments. Polyphenolic components, particularly 
anthocyanin compounds, were extracted, purified and analyzed by HPLC-DAD and 
DI-ESI-MS. An anthocyanin content between 0.24 and 21 mg/g fresh weight and a 
flavonols content between 0.04 and 0.2 mg/g fresh weight were found, depending 
on the harvest year and the applied procedures. Anthocyanins, besides being the 
principal components, were mainly represented by cyanidin-3-glucosyl-rutinoside 
(about 80%), a not particularly widespread molecule, mostly accounting for 
polyphenolic content. Color analysis and anti-radical activity of the different 
obtained extracts were performed with the aim to correlate organoleptic 
characters and health potential to the detected anthocyanins and flavanols 
content. Results show that immediate post-harvest freezing is the best way to 
preserve the bioactive content, the correlated color expression and anti-radical 
activity.

Recent studies indicate that anthocyanin intake conveys a variety of health 
benefits, which depend on absorption and metabolic mechanisms that deliver 
anthocyanins and their bioactive metabolites to responsive tissues. The 
anthocyanin bioavailability of red cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata) 
was evaluated as reflected by urinary excretion of anthocyanins and anthocyanin 
metabolites. Twelve volunteers consumed 100, 200, and 300 g of steamed red 
cabbage (containing 1.38 micromol of anthocyanins/g of cabbage) in a crossover 
design. Anthocyanin concentration in cabbage extract and urine was measured by 
HPLC-MS/MS. Six nonacylated and 30 acylated anthocyanins were detected in red 
cabbage, and 3 nonacylated anthocyanins, 8 acylated anthocyanins, and 4 
metabolites were present in urine. Mean 24 h excretion of intact anthocyanins 
increased linearly from 45 (100 g dose) to 65 nmol (300 g dose) for acylated 
anthocyanins and from 52 (100 g dose) to 79 nmol (300 g dose) for nonacylated 
anthocyanins. Urinary recovery of intact anthocyanins (percent of anthocyanin 
intake) decreased linearly from 0.041% (100 g dose) to 0.020% (300 g dose) for 
acylated anthocyanins and from 0.18% (100 g dose) to 0.09% (300 g dose) for 
nonacylated anthocyanins. Anthocyanin metabolites consisted of glucuronidated 
and methylated anthocyanins. The results show that red cabbage anthocyanins were 
excreted in both intact and metabolized forms and that recovery of nonacylated 
anthocyanins in urine was >4-fold that of acylated anthocyanins.

Absorption of cyanidin-based anthocyanins is not fully understood with respect 
to dose or anthocyanin structure. In feeding studies using whole foods, 
nonacylated anthocyanins are more bioavailable than their acylated counterparts, 
but the extent to which plant matrix determines relative bioavailability of 
anthocyanins is unknown. Using juice of purple carrots to circumvent matrix 
effects, a feeding trial was conducted to determine relative bioavailability of 
acylated and nonacylated anthocyanins and to assess dose-response effects. 
Appearance of anthocyanins in plasma was measured in 10 healthy adults for 8 h 
following consumption of purple carrot juice. Each subject consumed 50, 150, and 
250 mL of juice containing 76 micromol (65 mg), 228 micromol (194 mg), and 380 
micromol (323 mg) of total anthocyanins, respectively. Acylated anthocyanins 
comprised 76% of total anthocyanins in the juice, yet their bioavailability was 
found to be significantly less than that of nonacylated anthocyanins. Peak 
plasma concentrations of nonacylated anthocyanins were 4-fold higher than that 
for acylated anthocyanins. Absorption efficiency declined across the doses 
administered. Because the treatments were consumed as juice, it could be 
discerned that the difference in bioavailability of acylated versus nonacylated 
anthocyanins was not primarily caused by interactions with the plant matrix.

Understanding how the environment and production and cultivation practices 
influence the composition and quality of food crops is fundamental to the 
production of high-quality nutritious foods. In this 3-year study, total 
phenolics, percent soluble solids, ascorbic acid, and the flavonoid aglycones 
quercetin, kaempferol, and luteolin were measured in two varieties of tomato 
(Lycopersicon esculentum L. cv. Ropreco and Burbank) and two varieties of bell 
peppers (Capsicum annuum L. cv. California Wonder and Excalibur) grown by 
certified organic and conventional practices in a model system. Significantly 
higher levels of percent soluble solids (17%), quercetin (30%), kaempferol 
(17%), and ascorbic acid (26%) were found in Burbank tomatoes (fresh weight 
basis; FWB), whereas only levels of percent soluble solids (10%) and kaempferol 
(20%) were significantly higher in organic Ropreco tomatoes (FWB). Year-to-year 
variability was significant, and high values from 2003 influenced the 3-year 
average value of quercetin reported for organic Burbank tomatoes. Burbank 
tomatoes generally had higher levels of quercetin, kaempferol, total phenolics, 
and ascorbic acid as compared to Ropreco tomatoes. Bell peppers were influenced 
less by environment and did not display cropping system differences.

Tea drinks have a long history and milk is often added to enhance the taste and 
nutritional value, whereas the interaction between the tea bioactive compounds 
with proteins has not been systematically investigated. In this study, a 
milk-tea model was prepared by mixing green tea solution with milk and then 
heating at 100°C for 15 min. The milk tea was then measured using biochemical 
assay, antioxidant detection kit, and microscopy, as well as HPLC-quadrupole 
time-of-flight-MS/MS after ultrafiltration. The study found that as the 
concentration of milk protein increased in the milk-tea system, the total 
phenol-protein binding rate rose from 19.63% to 51.08%, which led to a decrease 
in free polyphenol content. This decrease of polyphenol was also revealed in the 
antioxidant capacity, including 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging 
ability and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power, in a dose-dependent manner. 
Untargeted metabolomics results revealed that the majority of small-molecule 
compounds/polyphenols in tea, such as epigallocatechin gallate, (-)-epicatechin 
gallate, and catechin 5,7,-di-O-gallate, bound to milk proteins and were removed 
by ultrafiltration after addition of milk and heat treatment. The SDS-PAGE and 
Native-PAGE results further indicated that small-molecule compounds in tea 
formed covalent and noncovalent complexes by binding to milk proteins. All of 
these results partially explained that milk proteins form conjugates with tea 
small-molecule compounds. Consistently, the particle size of the tea-milk system 
increased as the tea concentration increased, but the polymer dispersity index 
decreased, indicating a more uniform molecular weight distribution of the 
particles in the system. Addition of milk protein enhanced foam ability in the 
milk-tea system but reduced foam stability. In summary, our findings suggest 
that the proportion of milk added to tea infusion needs to be considered to 
maintain the quality of milk tea from multiple perspectives, including 
stability, nutritional quality, and antioxidant activity.

Aronia berry has extremely strong and unpleasant astringent mouthfeel. However, 
detailed information on the key astringent compounds is still limited. To fill 
this gap, astringent compounds were firstly separated from aronia juice. 
Following sensory evaluation, phenolic profile determination, validation by 
in-vitro models, and thiolytic degradation, key astringent compounds were 
identified. Results showed when most proanthocyanidins (PAs) were removed while 
other phenolic compounds remained, the astringency intensity of aronia juice was 
significantly decreased. In-vitro models, including saliva precipitation index 
and mucin turbidity, validated PAs rather than anthocyanins as the key 
astringent compounds. The protein-precipitated PAs from aronia juice were 
identified as polymers, linked by B-type bonds, with (-)-epicatechin as the 
extension unit and predominantly as the terminal unit, having a 69.56 mean 
degree of polymerization (mDP), far higher than the 35.38 mDP of PAs separated 
directly from juice. These findings would be valuable to the development of 
targeted astringency mitigation approaches.

Epidemiological studies suggest that consumption of whole grain cereals and 
whole grain cereal products have many benefical health effects, including 
reducing risk of diabetes, obesity, coronary heart diseases, stroke and even 
some cancers. Precise knowledge protective compounds present in cereal grains 
can be achieved only when specific biomarkers (biological marker, indicator), 
that could provide estimation of grain cereals absorption and intake, are 
established and determined. 5-n-alkylresorcinols (main fraction of phenolic 
compounds in cereals), because of their specific occurrence only in bran 
fraction, obtained in refining of milling fractions process, could be a very 
good candidate to play the role of biomarker of whole grain intake. They are 
absorbed by animals and humans, present in human plasma and as metabolites in 
urine. Because composition of saturated homologues of 5-n-alkylresorcinols is 
different in rye and wheat grains, they could be used as an indicator of the 
intake of the specific type of cereals and whole grain cereal products.

Scutellarin is widely used in treating various cardiovascular diseases. Few data 
are available regarding its metabolism and pharmacokinetics in humans. The 
objectives of this study were to develop methods to identify major metabolites 
of scutellarin in human urine and plasma and to determine simultaneously the 
parent drug and its major metabolites in human plasma for pharmacokinetic 
studies. Four metabolites were detected in urine samples by liquid 
chromatography coupled with electrospray multi-stage mass spectrometry (MS), but 
only one of them was found in plasma. Its structure was confirmed as 
scutellarein 6-O-beta-D-glucuronide by MS, NMR, and UV absorbance spectra. The 
plasma concentrations of scutellarin and the major metabolite were 
simultaneously determined using liquid chromatography-tandem MS. After a single 
p.o. administration of 60 mg of scutellarin to 20 healthy subjects, the plasma 
concentrations of scutellarin were very low, and its plasma concentration-time 
curve was also anomalous. Plasma concentration of the major metabolite was 
comparatively high, and the peak plasma concentration was 87.0 +/- 29.1 ng/ml. 
The Tmax was late (7.85 +/- 1.62 h), and part of individual pharmacokinetic 
profiles showed double peaks, which indicated scutellarin could be absorbed into 
the intestine after hydrolysis to its aglycone by bacterial enzymes. This was 
followed by reconjugation in the intestinal cell and/or liver with glucuronic 
acid catalyzed by the phase II enzyme, which showed regioselectivity and species 
difference. The regioselectivity of glucuronoconjugation for scutellarin may be 
of importance for pharmacological activity. Plasma concentration of 
isoscutellarin can be used as a biomarker of scutellarin intake.

A direct analysis in real-time (DART) ion source coupled to a high-resolution 
orbitrap mass spectrometer was used for the quantitative analysis of isoflavones 
isolated from soybeans. For the isolation of genistein, daidzein, glycitein, and 
their respective acetyl, malonyl, and glucoside forms, an extraction employing 
80% aqueous MeOH enhanced by sonication was used. As far as the total 
isoflavones (expressed as aglycones) were to be determined, an acid hydrolysis 
with 80% aqueous EtOH and refluxing had to be employed, while in the latter case 
a good agreement of the results with the data generated by the UHPLC-orbitrap MS 
method was achieved, in the case of the analysis of non-hydrolyzed extracts, 
some overestimation of the results as compared with those generated by 
UHPLC-orbitrap MS was observed. A careful investigation of this phenomenon 
showed that the free aglycones originated from the conjugated forms of 
isoflavones in the DART ion source, thus contributing significantly to the 
""free"" genistein/daidzein/glycitein signals during the DART analysis. Good 
recoveries (95-102%) and repeatabilities (RSD: 7-15%) were obtained at the 
spiking levels of 0.5, 1, and 0.05 g/kg, for daidzein, genistein, and glycitein, 
respectively. The limits of detection estimated for the respective analytes were 
5 mg/kg.

In this work, liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem ion-trap mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) was used to investigate the in-vivo and in-vitro 
metabolism of tectoridin. After oral administration of a single dose (100 mg 
kg(-1)) of tectoridin to healthy rats, faeces and urine samples were collected 
for 0-48 h and 0-24 h, respectively. Tectoridin was also incubated with rat 
intestinal flora and rat liver microsomes. Samples from in-vivo and in-vitro 
metabolism studies were purified using a C(18) solid-phase extraction cartridge, 
then separated using a reverse-phase C(18) column with methanol/ water (30:70, 
v/v, adjusted to pH 10.0 with ammonia water) as mobile phase and detected by an 
on-line MS(n) system. The structure of the metabolites was elucidated by 
comparing their molecular weights, retention times and full-scan MS(n) spectra 
with those of the parent drug. The results revealed six metabolites of 
tectoridin in urine (tectorigenin, hydrogenated tectorigenin, mono-hydroxylated 
tectorigenin, di-hydroxylated tectorigenin, glucuronide-conjugated tectorigenin 
and sulfate-conjugated tectorigenin); three metabolites in faeces (tectorigenin, 
di-hydroxylated tectorigenin and sulfateconjugated tectorigenin); one metabolite 
in the intestinal flora incubation mixture (tectorigenin), and four in the liver 
microsomal incubation mixture (tectorigenin, hydrogenated tectorigenin, 
mono-hydroxylated tectorigenin and di-hydroxylated tectorigenin). Except for 
tectorigenin, all other metabolites of tectoridin are reported for the first 
time.

The effect of different light colors on the concentration of albumins and 
globulins during black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) germination was evaluated 
with an RGB LED lighting system. This study aimed to determine how light of 
different spectral composition influences protein content across different 
germination stages. Black bean seeds were germinated under six different LED 
light sources (red, green, blue, white, violet, and cyan), and protein fractions 
were quantified by Bradford's method. The results showed that blue and cyan 
light increased the concentration of albumins. Blue, white, and cyan light for 
globulins increased the concentration compared to germination under solar 
conditions for both fractions. The positive correlation between these protein 
fractions under specific wavelengths suggests a metabolic adaptation to light 
exposure. These findings highlight the potential of controlled lighting 
conditions to enhance the nutritional quality of germinated beans, supporting 
their application as functional food ingredients. Additionally, this study 
underscores the importance of photobiological modulation in seed germination, 
opening new possibilities for optimizing plant-based protein sources. Future 
research could explore the mechanisms behind these protein variations and their 
implications for food production and nutrition.

BACKGROUND: The antioxidant capacity of anthocyanins (AC) rapidly degrades 
during storage, highlighting the need for their stabilization. The 
conformational properties and high proline content of sodium caseinate (NaCAS), 
combined with the formation of NaCAS microgels in the presence of tara gum (TG) 
and acid gelation, suggest its potential as an effective stabilizing or 
encapsulating agent of AC.
RESULTS: Spectrofluorimetric results suggest the formation of a complex between 
NaCAS and AC. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated that the 
presence of TG and blackberry extract (BEX) modifies the NaCAS spectra in the 
analyzed range. These results validated the presence of hydrogen bonding and 
hydrophobic interactions between NaCAS and AC. The impact of the AC-NaCAS 
complex on the stability of the antioxidant capacity was assessed. After 43 days 
of storage, the lyophilized complex with an optimal BEX concentration retained 
70% of its iron-reducing power. Additionally, the results indicate that, at the 
tested concentrations of BEX, the radical scavenging capacity of NaCAS is 
minimally affected.
CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that the bioactive properties of the 
aqueous extract of blackberry are effectively stabilized through the formation 
of complexes with NaCAS in the presence of TG. Both AC and TG interact with 
NaCAS, but in different ways. The antioxidant capacity of these mixtures, 
demonstrated through both reducing power and free radical capture, is preserved 
to a high degree after storage. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.

Carob (Ceratonia siliqua L.) is a Mediterranean plant traditionally valued for 
its nutritional and therapeutic properties. Despite the recognized biological 
potential of its various parts, the pharmacological value of carob leaves 
remains underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the phytochemical content 
and assess the antioxidant, antibacterial, and cytotoxic properties of wild 
carob leaves ethanolic extract (CLEE). The total polyphenol, flavonoid, and 
condensed tannin contents of CLEE were quantified as 163.50 ± 9.25 mg gallic 
acid equivalent/g dry matter (DM), 22.23 ± 8.61 mg quercetin equivalent/g DM, 
and 34.35 ± 9.70 mg catechin equivalent/g DM, respectively. HPLC-DAD analysis 
revealed cinnamic, ferulic, sinapic, rutin, and succinic acids as the dominant 
phenolic compounds. CLEE exhibited strong antioxidant activity, with IC₅₀ values 
of 0.293 ± 0.034 mg/mL for DPPH and 19.48 ± 2.47 mg/mL for ABTS assays, 
alongside a total antioxidant capacity of 189.01 ± 7.18 µg ascorbic acid 
equivalent/mg. The extract also demonstrated notable antibacterial effects 
against a range of bacterial strains, as evaluated by disc diffusion and broth 
microdilution methods. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that CLEE exerted a 
selective antiproliferative effect against the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, 
with an IC₅₀ value of 28.26 ± 3.15 µg/mL. Molecular docking highlighted rutin as 
a key compound contributing to the antioxidant activity. In silico absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiling showed that most detected 
bioactive compounds possess good oral bioavailability and comply with Lipinski's 
rule of five. These findings suggest that CLEE contains pharmacologically 
relevant constituents and holds promise as a source of natural antioxidants and 
antimicrobial and anticancer agents. The study supports the valorisation of wild 
carob leaves, often considered an agricultural by-product, for potential 
applications in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical development.

Epidemiological evidence has suggested that vegetables and fruits may have a 
role in cancer prevention. The aim of the present study was to examine the 
anti-proliferative activity of ten related pure compounds from common vegetables 
and fruits. Studies were conducted on a series of carcinoma cells derived from 
eight human organs. The results show that linalool possessed the strongest 
activity against nine carcinoma cells, and that baicalein and luteolin also 
exhibited a broad spectrum of anti-proliferative activities. Among them, 
linalool showed the strongest activity against carcinoma of the cervix (IC50: 
0.37 microg/ml), stomach (IC50: 14.1 microg/ml), skin (IC50: 14.9 microg/ml), 
lung (IC50: 21.5 microg/ml) and bone (IC50: 21.7 microg/ml). As for the 
flavonoids, luteolin exhibited the strongest activity against carcinoma of the 
stomach (IC50: 7.1 microg/ml), cervix (IC50: 7.7 microg/ml), lung (IC50: 11.7 
microg/ml) and bladder (IC50: 19.5 microg/ml), whereas baicalein possessed the 
strongest anti-proliferative activity against carcinoma of the cervix (IC50: 9.8 
microg/ml), stomach (IC50: 16.1 microg/ml) and skin (IC50: 19.5 microg/ml). The 
present study indicates that linalool possessed the strongest activity against a 
broad spectrum of carcinoma cells, especially cervical carcinoma cells, 
suggesting that linalool and flavonoids are partially responsible for the cancer 
prevention of common vegetables and fruits.

Bell peppers (Capsicum annuum L.) in various stages of maturity are widely used 
in the diets of individuals and in the food industry; they are consumed both 
fresh and after thermal processing. However, every type of processing impacts 
the overall textural and bioactive characteristics of this plant-based food. In 
order to quantify the changes in the bioactive substances and color-structural 
characteristics that occur during selected heat treatments (contact grilling, 
roasting, roasting combined with microwaving, and steam cooking) of bell peppers 
at three maturity stages (green, yellow, and red), analyses of antioxidant 
activity, reducing sugar content, polyphenolic compound content, textural 
properties, and color coordinates in the L*a*b* system were carried out. Some of 
the processes used, such as contact grilling (15.43 mg GAE/g d.b.) and roasting 
combined with microwaving (15.24 mg GAE/g d.b.), proved to be beneficial as the 
total polyphenol content of green peppers (2.75 mg GAE/g d.b.) increased. The 
roasting (3.49 mg TE/g d.b.) and steaming (6.45 mg TE/g d.b.) methods decreased 
the antioxidant activity of yellow bell peppers (14.29 mg TE/g d.b.). Meanwhile, 
the roasting (0.88 mg Glc/g d.b.), contact-grilling (2.19 mg Glc/g d.b.), 
simultaneous microwaving and roasting (0.66 mg Glc/g d.b.), and steaming (1.30 
mg Glc/g d.b.) methods significantly reduced the content of reducing sugars and 
reducing substances in red bell peppers (4.41 mg Glc/g d.b.). The studies proved 
that in order to preserve the antioxidant and bioactive properties of bell 
peppers, it is necessary to consider the use of appropriately selected heat 
treatments, depending on the different stages of maturity. The proper selection 
of adequate thermal treatment can not only increase digestibility, but also 
improve the bioavailability of bioactive substances from this raw material.

Peanuts are consumed mostly as processed products. Although the effect of 
processing on isoflavone composition of legumes has been extensively studied, 
there has been no such study on peanuts. The objective of this study was to 
evaluate the effect of processing (boiling, oil- and dry-roasting) on the 
phytochemical composition of peanuts. Boiling had a significant effect on the 
phytochemical composition of peanuts compared to oil- and dry-roasting. Boiled 
peanuts had the highest total flavonoid and polyphenol content. The biochanin A 
and genistein content of boiled peanut extracts were two- and fourfold higher, 
respectively. trans-Resveratrol was detected only in the boiled peanuts, with 
the commercial product having a significantly (p < or = 0.05) higher 
concentration. Ultraviolet and mass spectrometry chromatograms for the boiled 
peanut extracts show the presence of four additional peaks that were not 
observed in the raw peanut extracts.

Peanuts have been reported to contain bioactive phytochemicals, particularly 
isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, and biochanin A) and trans-resveratrol. 
Currently, limited data are available regarding the levels of these bioactive 
compounds in peanuts with variations in reported levels. The purpose of this 
study was to compare four methods of extraction [stirring, sonication, Soxtec, 
and microwave-assisted sonication (MAS)] for runner peanuts. Quantification of 
the selected compounds was conducted by reverse-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography (RP-HPLC). The results showed that the MAS and Soxtec methods 
extracted significantly higher amounts of the phytochemicals. Also, the defatted 
peanuts gave significantly higher amounts of the phytochemicals compared to the 
nondefatted peanuts. The high levels of the isoflavones may be attributed to 
heat-induced conversion of conjugate glycosides to aglycons. The MAS and Soxtec 
methods may be used for total isoflavone content quantitation, while sonication 
or stirring may be the method of choice for quantitation of isoflavone 
composition (aglycons and glycoside conjugates) in peanuts.

The effect of polyphenols among different varieties of plums on superoxide 
radical scavenging activity (SRSA) was studied by an enzymatic method and their 
IC(50) values were determined. We found that the SRSA levels of the polyphenols 
were closely related to their chemical structures; cyanidin showed the lowest 
IC(50) among the polyphenols examined, and aglycones are more effective than 
their glycosides. BY 69-339 cultivar exhibited the lowest IC(50) among the 
eleven plum cultivars, which means the highest antioxidant activity in 
scavenging superoxide radicals, followed by French Damson, Cacaks Best, 
Beltsville Elite B70197, Empress, Castleton, Stanley, NY 6, NY 101, Mirabellier, 
and NY 9. IC(50) values showed a higher correlation with total flavonoids (r (2) 
= 0.8699) than total phenolics (r (2) = 0.8355), which indicated that flavonoids 
might contribute to the total SRSA more directly than other polyphenols. 
Anthocyanins in plums appeared to be the major contributors to the total SRSA, 
except for two yellow cultivars having no anthocyanins. Chlorogenic acid was the 
predominant phenolic acid, and it also exhibited SRSA significantly in the range 
of 1.0 to 94.9%. Quercetins were the major flavonols in plums. However, they 
showed relatively low contribution to the total SRSA.

The consumption of phytochemicals such as carotenoids and polyphenols within 
whole fruits and vegetables has been associated with decreased incidence of 
various inflammation and oxidative stress related chronic diseases, which may be 
due to direct antioxidant effects, or indirect mechanisms such as affecting 
signal transduction/gene expression. Within the present study, we investigated 
the antioxidant composition of two major groups of vegetables and fruits, 
Brassica oleraceae and prunus spp., and estimated their contribution to 
antioxidant capacity. For this purpose, 17 plum and 27 Brassica varieties were 
collected in Luxembourg, and analysed for their individual polyphenol and 
carotenoid profile, vitamin C, dietary fibre, and minerals/trace elements, and 
their correlation with markers of antioxidant capacity (FRAP, ABTS, 
Folin-Ciocalteu). Total carotenoid and polyphenol content varied considerably 
between the different Brassica and plum varieties, with highest concentrations 
in the variety Kale (13.3 ± 0.58 mg/100g wet weight) and Cherry plum (1.96 ± 
0.28 mg/100g) for carotenoids; and Kale (27.0 ± 0.91 mg/100g) and Kirks plum 
(185 ± 14 mg/100g) for polyphenols. In developed multiple 
linear-regression-models for Brassica, flavonoids, anthocyanins, lutein and 
vitamin C were found to be the best predictors of antioxidant capacity as 
assessed by FRAP (R(2)=0.832) and flavonoids, neochlorogenic acid and vitamin C 
as assessed by ABTS (R(2)=0.831); while for plums these were selenium, total 
sugars, chlorogenic acid and vitamin C (R(2)=0.853), and selenium, chlorogenic 
acid and flavonoids for FRAP (R(2)=0.711). When considering Brassica and plum 
consumption in Luxembourg, it is estimated that both contribute to an 
antioxidant intake equivalent to 26 and 6 mg per day of ascorbic acid 
equivalents, respectively.

To study the effect of polyphenolics on antioxidant activities of cabbages, the 
amounts of total phenolics, total flavonoids, antioxidant capacity and 
individual phenolic compounds in raw and processed cabbages were determined. 
Fresh and pickled red cabbages exhibited the highest total phenolic contents 
(393.1+/-10.8 mg and 366.3+/-3.6 mg gallic acid equivalents/100 g fresh sample, 
respectively). Fresh and pickled red cabbages were also highest in flavonoids 
(108.1+/-9.3 mg and 72.4+/-4.4 mg catechin equivalents/100 g fresh sample, 
respectively). The antioxidant capacity (expressed as vitamin C equivalent 
antioxidant capacity) ranged from 57.1 to 695.6 mg vitamin C equivalents/100 g 
fresh sample, where raw and pickled red cabbages exhibited the highest 
antioxidant capacity. There was a good linear relationship between the total 
phenolics and antioxidant capacity (r2=0.9743), and between the total flavonoids 
and antioxidant capacity (r2=0.9557); however, the relationship between the 
ascorbic acid content and antioxidant capacity was very low (r2=0.1442). The 
antioxidant capacity of raw and processed cabbages was highly correlated with 
their contents of polyphenolics. Kaempferol, quercetin, and apigenin were the 
major flavonoids existing in cabbages except for raw and pickled red cabbages, 
where cyanidin was the predominant flavonoid (73.6-117.7 mg/kg). In the red 
cabbages, cyanidin was the major contributor to the antioxidant capacity as well 
as the content of total phenolics and flavonoids.

Most methods for detecting isoflavones in biological samples do not measure the 
concentration of sulfate conjugates. An LC-MS method is reported here to 
estimate urinary concentrations of genistein and daidzein, their sulfate and 
glucuronide conjugates and other major metabolites. Human and rat urine samples 
were extracted with diethyl ether, or pre-digested with sulfatase and/or 
beta-glucuronidase followed by extraction. The isoflavones were separated using 
gradient LC methods and detected by negative single ion monitoring on an MS 
system using a heated nebulizer atmospheric pressure chemical ionization 
interface. CVs for inter- and intra-assay variability were generally < 20 and 
10%, respectively. Preliminary studies using these procedures demonstrate 52+/-4 
and 26+/-4% of genistein in rat urine was found as the aglycone and sulfate 
conjugates, respectively, compared to 0.36 and 4%, respectively, in human urine. 
This method is suitable for the study of isoflavone sulfate conjugates in 
biological fluids.

[13C(3)]daidzein and [13C(3)]genistein were synthesized and used as internal 
standards for isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Free aglycons and intact 
glucuronide, sulfate, diglucuronide, disulfate, and mixed sulfoglucuronide 
conjugates of isoflavones and lignans were observed in naturally incurred urine 
samples. Sample pretreatment was not necessary, other than addition of internal 
standards and pH adjustment. Urine was injected directly onto the analytical 
column. The limits of detection were generally <50ng/ml, precision was generally 
<10% CV for conjugates. Total hydrolyzed daidzein and genistein were measured 
against quality assurance urine sample and were accurate to within 12%. The 
accuracy of conjugate measurement can not be ascertained, as no reference 
samples are available. The mean sum of daidzein and its conjugates was within 
20% of the hydrolyzed value. Concentrations of the free aglycons of up to 22% of 
genistein and 18% of daidzein were observed. The average pattern was ca. 54% 
7-glucuronide, 25% 4(')-glucuronide, 13% monosulfates, 7% free daidzein, 0.9% 
sulfoglucuronides, 0.4% diglucuronide, and <0.1% disulfate. Selective enzymatic 
deconjugation with glucuronidase and mixed glucuronidase/sulfatase were used to 
validate the accuracy of the quantitation of the intact daidzein conjugates. 
There were no apparent sex differences, or conditioning effects on the 
conjugation profile of isoflavones after chronic dosing.

Fish and fish products (14 samples), Indian foods and meals (10 samples), spices 
(30 samples) and beers (10 samples) were analysed for their phytoestrogen 
content, and a number of significant non-soya sources of dietary phytoestrogens 
were identified. No isoflavones were detected in unprocessed, farmed or ocean 
fish, but some samples of processed fish products contained soya isoflavones, 
which are assumed to come from coatings or protein addition. Additionally, some 
processed fish products contained, genistein glycocongugates not derived from 
soya. Genistein was detected in Indian meals such that, for example, a single 
portion of a vindalooo curry contained 11 mg genistein. The origin was most 
likely from the spices used, since the analysis of curry powders, chilli powder, 
crushed red chillies, garam masala and tandoori powder revealed that some 
contained genistein at more than 100 mg kg(-1). Cumin was the most likely source 
material, although not all individual samples of cumin tested contained high 
levels of genistein. Prenylnaringenin phytoestrogens were determined in UK 
hop-based beers at mean concentrations of 0.21 mg(-1) 6-prenylnaringenin and 
0.06mg(-1) 8-prenylnaringenin. The beers also contained traces of daidzein, 
genistein and biochanin A. The significance of 'hidden soya' in processed foods 
and these non-soya sources of phytoestrogens is that UK dietary intake of 
phytoestrogens must be assumed to be higher than estimated previously and that 
some sources of phytoestrogens remain poorly characterized.

The analysis of general content of polyphenols, minerals and antioxidant 
activity of infusions from selected coffee substitutes is presented. The 
obtained results showed that the coffee infusions prepared from acorns exhibit 
the highest radical scavenging capacities for DPPH 
(EC50 = 0.063-0.066 mgd.w./mL), ABTS (EC50 = 0.021-0.029 mgd.w./mL), 
OH(EC50 = 2.050-2.378 mgd.w./mL) as well as the highest ability to Fe3+ 
reduction (FRAP) (∼1.1 mmolFe/gd.w). These coffee substitutes also contain the 
greatest values of polyphenols (45-50 mgGA/gd.w). Analyzed coffee substitutes 
differ in both quality and quantity of polyphenols, but all tested coffees 
contain gallic and chlorogenic acids. The most of phenolic compounds was found 
in herbal-cereal coffee substitute. The quantitative results and PCA analysis 
indicated a good correlation between the antioxidant activity and total 
polyphenols, flavonoids and gallic acid content. Using the obtained data on the 
composition and antioxidant properties of extracts the cluster analysis (CA) was 
performed to distinguish similar or close types of coffee.

4-Vinylguaiacol (4-VG) is one of the most common off-flavors found in sake. 4-VG 
is produced from its precursor, ferulic acid, which is a component of the cell 
wall of the rice endosperm. The release of ferulic acid in sake brewing is 
thought to be mediated by feruloyl esterase produced by either Aspergillus 
oryzae or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To investigate the effect of FaeA, a 
feruloyl esterase produced by A. oryzae, its loss-of-function strain was 
produced by genome co-editing. The feruloyl esterase activity of the 
faeA-deficient strain was drastically reduced. Sake was fermented using koji 
with S. cerevisiae strain G046, which can convert ferulic acid to 4-VG. 
Fermented sake was analyzed by measuring the 4-VG content and sensory 
evaluation. 4-VG content was reduced to approximately 10% of that of sake 
fermented with control koji. Sensory evaluation revealed that 4-VG was almost 
undetectable. Our findings showed that disruption of faeA in A. oryzae is a 
promising strategy to reduce 4-VG off-flavors in sake.

Phenolic acids (chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic, ellagic, and 
syringic acid) as well as syringaldehyde and juglone were identified in ripe 
fruits of 10 walnut cultivars: Adams, Cisco, Chandler, Franquette, Lara, Fernor, 
Fernette, Alsoszentivani 117 (A-117), Rasna, and Elit. Analyses were done using 
a high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a diode array detector. 
Significant differences in the contents of identified phenolics were observed 
among cultivars. Phenolics were determined separately in the kernel and in the 
thin skin of the walnut, termed the pellicle. Not only in the kernel but also in 
the pellicle did syringic acid, juglone, and ellagic acid predominate (average 
values of 33.83, 11.75, and 5.90 mg/100 g of kernel; and 1003.24, 317.90, and 
128.98 mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively), and the contents of ferulic and 
sinapic acid (average values of 0.06 and 0.05 mg/100 g of kernel and 2.93 and 
2.17 mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively) were the lowest in all cultivars. The 
highest differences in the sum of all identified phenolics were observed between 
Rasna and Fernette fruits; in Rasna there were >2-fold higher contents of 
identified phenolics in both kernel and pellicle. It was found that the walnut 
pellicle is the most important source of walnut phenolics. The ratio between the 
contents in pellicle and kernel varied by at least 14.8-fold for caffeic acid 
(cv. Adams) and by up to 752.0-fold for p-coumaric acid (cv. Elit).

Biotransformation of the phytoestrogen [14C]genistein was investigated in male 
and female rats by application of narrow-bore radio-HPLC-MSn (LCQ, Finnigan) to 
determine intermediates in metabolism. Urine contained five metabolites, 
Gm1-Gm5, 24 h after dosing by gavage with [14C]genistein (4 mg kg(-1)). 
Structural analysis following ESI revealed molecular ions [M+H]+ of m/z 447, 
449, 273, and 271 for metabolites Gm2, Gm3, Gm5 and genistein, respectively and 
an [M-H]- of m/z 349 for Gm4. Metabolite structure was deduced by evaluation of 
product ion spectra derived from unlabelled and [14C]-labelled ions and 
sensitivity to treatment with beta-glucuronidase. These studies indicated 
identity of metabolites with genistein glucuronide (Gm2), dihydrogenistein 
glucuronide (Gm3), genistein sulphate (Gm4) and dihydrogenistein (Gm5). 
Detection of the beta-glucuronidase resistant major metabolite Gm1 by ESI was 
poor and so was analysed by negative ion APCI; this revealed a deprotonated 
molecular ion of m/z 165 which had chromatographic and mass spectral properties 
consistent with authentic 4-hydroxyphenyl-2-propionic acid, a novel metabolite 
of genistein. In vitro metabolism studies with anaerobic caecal cultures derived 
from male and female rats revealed metabolism of genistein to Gm1 via Gm5 and an 
additional metabolite (Gm6) which was identified from product ion spectra as 
6'-hydroxy-O-desmethylangolensin. Biotransformation of genistein by both 
isolated hepatocytes and precision-cut liver slices was limited to 
glucuronidation of parent compound. Commonality of genistein metabolites found 
in rats with those reported in man suggest similar pathways of 
biotransformation, primarily involving gut micro-flora.

Anthocyanins are potent antioxidants that may possess chronic disease preventive 
properties. Here, rapid, reliable, and reproducible solid-phase extraction, 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and mass spectrometry techniques 
are described for the isolation, separation, and identification of anthocyanins 
in human plasma and urine. Recoveries of cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) were 91% 
from water, 71% from plasma, and 81% from urine. Intra- and interday variations 
for C3G extraction were 9 and 9.1% in plasma and 7.1 and 9.1% in urine and were 
less than 15% for all anthocyanins from a standardized bilberry extract 
(mirtoselect). Analysis of mirtoselect by HPLC with UV detection produced 
spectra with 15 peaks compatible with anthocyanin components found in 
mirtoselect within a total run time of 15 min. Chromatographic analysis of human 
urine obtained after an oral dose of mirtoselect yielded 19 anthocyanin peaks. 
Mass spectrometric analysis employing multiple reaction monitoring suggests the 
presence of unchanged anthocyanins and anthocyanidin glucuronide metabolites.

Six strawberry cultivars grown on the same commercial plantation in Brazil were 
evaluated for their chemical composition and quality attributes at the ripe 
stage. The profiles of the main soluble sugars, ascorbic acid, and anthocyanins 
were also obtained during the developmental stages. Results showed significant 
differences among cultivars in all of the investigated parameters. Cv. 
Campineiro showed an average value for texture of 0.63 N, half the value found 
for cv. Oso Grande. Anthocyanin content ranged from 13 (cv. Campineiro) to 55 
(cv. Mazi) mg/100 g. Total ascorbic acid found for cv. Campineiro (85 mg/100 g) 
was twice the amount found in cv. Dover (40 mg/100 g). Fructose was the 
predominant soluble sugar in almost all cultivars. The proportion among the main 
soluble sugars (fructose, sucrose, and glucose) was similar for Oso Grande and 
Toyonoka cultivars. The flavonol content (quercetin plus kaempferol derivatives) 
ranged from 2.7 to 7.1 mg/100 g, with a mean value of 6.1 mg/100 g, whereas free 
ellagic acid ranged from 0.9 to 1.9 and total phenolics varied from 159 to 289

This study investigates the influence of post-deposition thermal annealing 
temperature on the crystal structure, chemical composition, and electrical 
performance of solution-processed indium oxide (In2O3) thin films. Based on 
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the precursor solution, annealing 
temperatures of 350, 450, and 550 °C were adopted. The resulting In2O3 films 
were characterized using ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, atomic force 
microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy, and Hall-effect measurements to evaluate 
their optical, morphological, crystalline polymorphism, and electrical 
properties. The results revealed that the film annealed at 450 °C exhibited a 
field-effect mobility of 4.28 cm2/V·s and an on/off current ratio of 2.15 × 107. 
The measured hysteresis voltages were 3.11, 1.80, and 0.92 V for annealing 
temperatures of 350, 450, and 550 °C, respectively. Altogether, these findings 
indicate that an annealing temperature of 450 °C provides an optimal balance 
between the electrical performance and device stability for In2O3-based 
thin-film transistors (TFTs), making this condition favourable for 
high-performance oxide electronics.

Simultaneous determination of alcohols, amines, amino acids, flavonoids, and 
purine and pyrimidine bases in bottled beer samples directly without any 
pre-treatment was carried out by capillary zone electrophoresis with diode-array 
detection. Electrolyte conditions such as pH, composition and concentration of 
the buffer, working voltage and type and time of injection were checked. The 
best separation of the cited analytes was achieved in 70 mM sodium borate 
solution and pH 10.25. The detection limits were from 2.1 to 5.6 mg L(-1) for 
the 18 compounds studied. The developed method is rapid, sensitive and 
quantitative and has been applied to seven types of international bottled beers 
of different origins bought locally.

Ensuring the safety and stability of minimally processed foods using natural 
preservatives is of great scientific and commercial interest in modern 
biotechnology. Berry juice supplementation is increasingly recognized within 
this field. This study investigated the effectiveness of juices from four berry 
species Aronia melanocarpa, Ribes nigrum, Vaccinium macrocarpon, and Sambucus 
nigra, against the food pathogen Bacillus cereus. Overall, the antibacterial 
potency of juice supplements (up to 10% v/v in tryptic soy broth) followed the 
order of chokeberry > blackcurrant > cranberry > elderberry, with the latter 
showing no inhibitory effects. Notably, chokeberry and elderberry juices 
presented lower acidity and significantly greater phenolic contents (p < 0.05) 
than blackcurrant and cranberry juices did, suggesting that B. cereus 
susceptibility is not strictly dependent upon low extracellular pH or elevated 
anthocyanin levels. Instead, it is inferred to correlate with pro-oxidative 
effects induced directly at the intracellular level. Accordingly, this paper 
discusses the antioxidative, acidic, and lipophilic attributes of juices and 
their constituent fractions, including anthocyanins, to elucidate their 
biopreservative potential. The results of this study increase our understanding 
of the antibacterial susceptibility of B. cereus.

Human bioavailability of the flavonoid dihydrochalcones is little understood, 
and no evidence exists for C-glycosyl flavonoid absorption in humans. The 
present study uses catechol-O-methyltransferase to generate methylated 
metabolites of aspalathin (a C-glycosyl dihydrochalcone from rooibos tea). One 
of the methylated forms, both with and without glucuronidation, was detected 
using LC-MS/MS in the urine of human subjects (n = 6), demonstrating that 
deglycosylation is not a prerequisite for C-glycosyl flavonoid absorption. 
Methylation is catalysed by both intestine and liver cytosolic extracts. The 
results show that flavonoid C-glycosides are methylated and glucuronidated in 
vivo in an intact form in humans.

Cold pressing is one of the most common methods of extracting oil from seeds, 
generating by-products in the form of meals that are often discarded as waste. 
Given the large quantities of these meals and the presence of valuable 
compounds, a thorough investigation of their nutritional value and potential 
applications is essential. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the 
residual oil, total phenol and flavonoid content, phenolic compounds, 
antioxidant activity, as well as the ash, carbohydrate, protein, and mineral 
nutrient content of 15 commercial and non-commercial oilseed meals. The results 
showed that Sesamum indicum meal had the highest residual oil content 
(17.86 ± 2.4%). Among the meals studied, Pistacia atlantica showed the highest 
concentrations of phenols (17.67 ± 0.69 mg GAL/g meal) and flavonoids 
(3.07 ± 0.003 mg QE/g meal). Also, it exhibited the highest DPPH radical 
scavenging activity, with an IC50 value of 33.11 ± 1.41 µg/mL. Quantitative HPLC 
analysis showed that P. atlantica and Helianthus annuus meals were particularly 
rich in quercetin (37.20 ± 2.97 mg/g meal) and rosmarinic acid 
(46.67 ± 3.32 mg/g meal), respectively, suggesting that their antioxidant 
properties may be due to these compounds. In terms of macronutrients, the 
highest carbohydrate content was observed in Arachis hypogaea (37.92 ± 0.11%), 
while H. annuus meal had the greatest protein concentration (45.12 ± 1.83%). 
Mineral analysis showed that Prunus armeniaca, H. annuus, and Chrozophora 
tinctoria meals were the richest sources of potassium (1.73 ± 0.04%), phosphorus 
(0.60 ± 0.03%), and calcium (16.20 ± 0.09%), respectively. Furthermore, the 
highest magnesium content (0.29 ± 0.00%) was found in Cucurbita pepo and 
Lallemantia royleana meals. These findings highlight the nutritional and 
bioactive potential of the meals studied, especially those from P. atlantica, H. 
annuus, and L. royleana, which contain valuable compounds suitable for 
applications in food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and other industries.

This study investigated the influence of Bacillus subtilis fermentation on the 
composition of phenolic substances and antioxidant activity in cornmeal. The 
results indicate that the fermentation process significantly increased both the 
total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC). After 5 days of 
fermentation, the TPC rose from 31.68 ± 1.72 mg/g to 39.46 ± 2.95 mg/g, 
representing a 24.56% increase, while the TFC increased from 2.13 ± 0.11 mg/g to 
7.56 ± 0.29 mg/g, marking a 254.93% increase. Additionally, the proportion of 
free phenolic compounds in cornmeal increased from 20.24% to 83.98%, while the 
proportion of bound phenolic compounds decreased from 79.76% to 16.02%. 
Furthermore, the hydrolytic enzyme activities of cellulase, β-glucosidase, and 
xylanase were significantly correlated with the free phenolic content (FPC) (r > 
0.85, p < 0.05), indicating their crucial role in releasing free phenolic 
compounds from cornmeal. Employing scanning electron microscopy, differential 
scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier-transform infrared 
spectroscopy analyses, we inferred that the enzymes produced by the 
microorganisms disrupted the cellular structure of cornmeal and weakened the 
interactions between bound phenolics and the food matrix, thereby facilitating 
the release of phenolic compounds. This release resulted in an overall increase 
in the antioxidant activity of the cornmeal. The study provided a novel approach 
to enhancing the bioavailability of phenolic acids in cornmeal, indicating the 
potential benefits of fermentation in food processing.

Potato plants synthesize phenolic compounds as protection against bruising and 
injury from bacteria, fungi, viruses, and insects. Because antioxidative 
phenolic compounds are also reported to participate in enzymatic browning 
reactions and to exhibit health-promoting effects in humans, a need exists for 
accurate methods to measure their content in fresh and processed potatoes. To 
contribute to our knowledge about the levels of phenolic compounds in potatoes, 
we validated and used high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid 
chromatography/mass spectrometry to measure levels of chlorogenic acid, a 
chlorogenic isomer, and caffeic acid in flowers, leaves, stems, and tubers of 
the potato plant and in home-processed potatoes. The total phenolic acid content 
of flowers (626 mg/100 g fresh wt) was 21 and 59 times greater than that of 
leaves and stems, respectively. For all samples, chlorogenic acid and its isomer 
contributed 96-98% to the total. Total phenolic acid levels (in g/100 g fresh 
wt) of peels of five potato varieties grown in Korea ranged from 6.5 to 42.1 and 
of the flesh (pulp) from 0.5 to 16.5, with peel/pulp ratios ranging from 2.6 to 
21.1. The total phenolic acid content for 25 American potatoes ranged from 1.0 
to 172. The highest amounts were present in red and purple potatoes. Home 
processing of pulp with various forms of heat induced reductions in the phenolic 
content. The described methodology should facilitate future studies on the role 
of potato phenolic compounds in the plant and the diet.

Noncovalent complexes were used for structural determination and isomer 
differentiation of flavonoid glucuronides. Several flavonoid glucuronides 
including naringenin-7-O-glucuronide, synthesized here for the first time, were 
used as test compounds. Electrospray ionization quadrupole ion trap mass 
spectrometry with collision-induced dissociation (CID) was used to analyze 
complexes of the form [Co(II) (L-H) (Aux)]+ and [Co(II) (L-H) (Aux)2]+, in which 
L is the flavonoid glucuronide and Aux is a phenanthroline-based ligand. These 
complexes yielded characteristic fragmentation patterns that facilitated 
assignment of the substitution position of the glucuronides. The methods were 
adapted to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with 
postcolumn cobalt complexation and were tested on extracts from biological 
fluids. The metabolites naringenin-7-O-glucuronide and 
naringenin-4'-O-glucuronide were detected in human urine following the 
consumption of grapefruit juice. Isomeric quercetin glucuronides were identified 
and differentiated after spiking rat plasma at the 1 microM level, proving that 
the new methods are effective at biologically relevant concentrations.

Cold plasma treatment of kiwifruit juice was studied in the domain of 18-30 kV 
of voltage, 2-6 mm of juice depth, and 6-10 min of treatment time using the 
response surface methodology (RSM). The experimental design utilized was a 
central composite rotatable design. The effect of voltage, juice depth, and 
treatment time on the various responses, namely peroxidase activity, color, 
total phenolic content, ascorbic acid, total antioxidant activity, and total 
flavonoid content, was examined. While modeling, the artificial neural network 
(ANN) showed greater predictive capability than RSM as the coefficient of 
determination (R2 ) value of responses was greater in the case of ANN 
(0.9538-0.9996) than in RSM (0.9041-0.9853). The mean square error value was 
also less in the case of ANN than in RSM. The ANN was coupled with a genetic 
algorithm (GA) for optimization. The optimum condition obtained from ANN-GA was 
30 kV, 5 mm, and 6.7 min, respectively.

Many studies have shown that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) contribute to the 
health benefits of green tea, although its bioavailability is usually low. 
However, the mechanism underlying its intestinal absorption remains unclear. In 
human subjects, it has been reported that the bioavailability of EGCg increases 
after repeated oral catechin intake. We hypothesized that a certain uptake 
transporter was involved in this increase, and investigated a novel EGCg 
transporter. We first confirmed the increase in EGCg bioavailability in mice fed 
the catechin diet for two weeks. Then, in situ intestinal catechin infusion 
exhibited that the absorption of EGCg in the ileum was selectively increased in 
mice fed the catechin diet. A comprehensive analysis of plasma membrane proteins 
revealed 10 candidates for EGCg transporter, which were selectively increased in 
the ileum. EGCg uptake by a Xenopus laevis oocyte expressed with respective 
transporter revealed that oocytes microinjected with DTDST cRNA exhibited 
significantly higher EGCg uptake. Furthermore, uptake of EGCg by CHO-K1 cells 
stably expressing DTDST was significantly higher than that by mock cells, which 
was nullified by treating with a DTDST inhibitor. In conclusion, this study

A LC-MS method was developed for the determination of coumarin, vanillin, and 
ethyl vanillin in vanilla products. Samples were analyzed using LC-electrospray 
ionization (ESI)-MS in the positive ionization mode. Limits of detection for the 
method ranged from 0.051 to 0.073 microg mL(-1). Using the optimized method, 24 
vanilla products were analyzed. All samples tested negative for coumarin. 
Concentrations ranged from 0.38 to 8.59 mg mL(-1) (x =3.73) for vanillin and 
0.33 to 2.27 mg mL(-1) (x =1.03) for ethyl vanillin. The measured concentrations 
are compared to values calculated using UV monitoring and to results reported in 
a similar survey in 1988. Analytical results, method precision, and accuracy 
data are presented.

The phytochemical profiles (total phenolics, anthocyanins, ferulic acid, 
carotenoids) and antioxidant activities of five types of corn (white, yellow, 
high carotenoid, blue, and red) processed into masa, tortillas, and tortilla 
chips were studied. The nixtamalization process significantly (p < 0.05) reduced 
total phenolics and antioxidant activities when compared to raw grains. 
Nixtamalized grains exhibited higher concentration of free phenolics and soluble 
conjugated ferulic acid and had lower concentrations of bound phenolics and 
ferulic acid than unprocessed grains. Among processed products, there was little 
difference in the phytochemical contents and antioxidant activities. Among types 
of corn, the highest concentrations of total phenolics, ferulic acid, and 
antioxidant activity were observed in the high-carotenoid genotype followed by 
the regular yellow counterpart. The white corn contained the lowest amount of 
total phenolics and antioxidant activity. The pigmented blue corn had the 
highest anthocyanin concentration followed by the red counterpart. These 
findings suggest that lime-cooking significantly reduced the phytochemical 
content of nixtamalized products but released phenolics and ferulic acid.

RATIONALE: Spironolactone is a steroidal drug prescribed for a variety of 
medical conditions and is extensively metabolized quickly after administration. 
Measurement of spironolactone and its metabolites remains challenging using mass 
spectrometry (MS) due to in-source fragmentation and relatively poor ionization 
using electrospray ionization. Therefore, improved methods of measurements are 
needed, particularly in the case of small sample volumes.
METHODS: Girard's reagent P (GP) derivatization of spironolactone was employed 
to improve response and provide an MS-based solution to the measurement of 
spironolactone and its metabolites. We performed ultra-high-performance liquid 
chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry 
(UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS)-high-resolution mass 
spectrometry (HRMS) to fully characterize the GP derivatization products. 
Analytes were studied in positive ionization mode, and MS/MS was performed using 
nonresonance and resonance excitation collision-induced dissociation.
RESULTS: We observed the successful GP derivatization of spironolactone and its 
metabolites using authentic chemical standards. A signal enhancement of 1-2 
orders of magnitude was observed for GP-derivatized versions of spironolactone 
and its metabolites. Further, GP derivatization eliminated in-source 
fragmentation. Finally, we performed GP derivatization and 
ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry 
(UHPLC-HRMS) in a small volume of murine serum (20 μL) from 
spironolactone-treated and control animals and observed multiple spironolactone 
metabolites only in the spironolactone-treated group.
CONCLUSIONS: GP derivatization was proven to have advantageous mass spectral 
performance (e.g., limiting in-source fragmentation, enhancing signals, and 
eliminating isobaric analytes) for spironolactone and its metabolites. This work 
and the detailed characterization using ultra-high-performance liquid 
chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS) and IMS 
serve as the foundation for future developments in reaction optimization and/or 
quantitative assay development.

Claims for the potential health benefits of oleocanthal (OLC), a dietary 
phenolic compound found in olive oil, are based mainly on in vitro studies. 
Little is known about the tissue availability of OLC, which is rapidly 
metabolized after ingestion. In this study, the distribution of OLC and its 
metabolites in rat plasma and tissues (stomach, intestine, liver, kidney, 
spleen, lungs, heart, brain, thyroid and skin) at 1, 2 and 4.5 h after the acute 
intake of a refined olive oil containing 0.3 mg/mL of OLC was examined by 
LC-ESI-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS. OLC was only detected in the stomach and intestine 
samples. Moreover, at 2 and 4.5 h, the concentration in the stomach decreased by 
36% and 74%, respectively, and in the intestine by 16% and 33%, respectively. 
Ten OLC metabolites arising from phase I and phase II reactions were identified. 
The metabolites were widely distributed in rat tissues, and the most important 
metabolizing organs were the small intestine and liver. The two main circulating 
metabolites were the conjugates OLC + OH + CH3 and OLC + H2O + glucuronic acid, 
which may significantly contribute to the beneficial health effects associated 
with the regular consumption of extra virgin olive oil. However, more studies 
are necessary to determine the concentrations and molecular structures of OLC 
metabolites in human plasma and tissues when consumed with the presence of other 
phenolic compunds present in EVOO.

In human LDL, the bioactivity of olive oil phenols is determined by the in vivo 
disposition of the biological metabolites of these compounds. Here, we examined 
how the ingestion of 2 similar olive oils affected the content of the metabolic 
forms of olive oil phenols in LDL in men. The oils differed in phenol 
concentrations as follows: high (629 mg/L) for virgin olive oil (VOO) and null 
(0 mg/L) for refined olive oil (ROO). The study population consisted of a 
subsample from the EUROLIVE study and a randomized controlled, crossover design 
was used. Intervention periods lasted 3 wk and were preceded by a 2-wk washout 
period. The levels of LDL hydroxytyrosol monosulfate and homovanillic acid 
sulfate, but not of tyrosol sulfate, increased after VOO ingestion (P < 0.05), 
whereas the concentrations of circulating oxidation markers, including oxidized 
LDL (oxLDL), conjugated dienes, and hydroxy fatty acids, decreased (P < 0.05). 
The levels of LDL phenols and oxidation markers were not affected by ROO 
consumption. The relative increase in the 3 LDL phenols was greater when men 
consumed VOO than when they consumed ROO (P < 0.05), as was the relative 
decrease in plasma oxLDL (P = 0.001) and hydroxy fatty acids (P < 0.001). Plasma 
oxLDL concentrations were negatively correlated with the LDL phenol levels (r = 
-0.296; P = 0.013). Phenols in LDL were not associated with other oxidation 
markers. In summary, the phenol concentration of olive oil modulates the 
phenolic metabolite content in LDL after sustained, daily consumption. The 
inverse relationship of these metabolites with the degree of LDL oxidation 
supports the in vivo antioxidant role of olive oil phenolics compounds.

This study evaluated the effects of incorporating cold-pressed sesame (C-SEO), 
safflower (C-SAO), and black cumin oils (C-BCO) into mayonnaise at substitution 
ratios of 0-20 % to sunflower oil. Refined sunflower oil had the lowest free 
fatty acids (FFA) and strong antiradical activity due to high α-tocopherol and 
β-carotene content. C-BCO showed the highest oxidation levels with a peroxide 
value of 6.52 meq O₂/kg. Increasing cold-pressed oil proportions improved the 
mayonnaise's total phenolic content and antiradical activity, with values 
ranging from 12.07 to 13.26 mg GAE/100 g and 0.56 % to 4.08 %, respectively. SAM 
(safflower oil mayonnaise) displayed the greatest color change, while 
cold-pressed sesame oil exhibited the best lipid oxidation stability. Sensory 
evaluation scores varied from 5.8 to 7.4, with SAM having the highest 
acceptability. All mayonnaises maintained good emulsion stability and 
microbiological safety after 6 months at 4 °C. The findings suggest that 
cold-pressed oils enhance mayonnaise's bioactive content, stability, and 
quality.

Trypsin inhibitors (TI), tannins, and lectins appear to have a role in 
preventing chronic diseases in humans. The genetic variability of these traits 
in common bean needs to be ascertained in order to increase levels through 
breeding. The variability of TI, tannin, and lectins was determined in five bean 
cultivars grown at five locations in Mexico. TI and tannins contents in colored 
beans that belong to the Jalisco race were higher (11.1-11.9 trypsin units 
inhibited (TUI)/mg and 29.0-38.1 mg catechin equivalent (CE)/g, respectively) 
than cultivars of the Durango race (7.9-8.3 TUI/mg and 16.8-19.9 CE/mg, 
respectively). Bayo Victoria, a Durango race cultivar, had three times more 
lectins than levels reported for soybean. Cultivar influenced TI and tannins 
contents (p < 0.001), whereas site affected lectins (p < 0.001). An increase in 
levels of TI and tannins could be enhanced through breeding.

A rapid HPLC-diode array detection (DAD) method was developed for the routine 
analysis of 16 anthocyanins in wine. Direct injection of filtered wine samples 
followed by selective detection at 520 nm allowed quantitation of these 
compounds in red wines. The method was linear for malvidin-3-glucoside over the 
range 5-250ppm, and the limit of detection for this compound was 0.18 ppm. A 
volatile mobile phase is used, which enables hyphenation to mass spectrometry 
(MS). With HPLC-MS, a total of 44 pigments could be identified in South African 
wines. Obtained mass spectra are discussed for a series of representative wine 
constituents and results are compared with literature references. An attempt was 
made to differentiate between different cultivars according to the anthocyanin 
content using stepwise forward linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

The effect of wild blueberry consumption on anthocyanin (ACNs) distribution and 
metabolism in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was investigated. Thirty-two rats were 
fed for 4 or 8 weeks with a control (C) or a wild blueberry-enriched diet (8%) 
(WB). Anthocyanin profile in plasma, urine, feces, brain, and liver was 
evaluated by LC-MS/MS, and significantly increased in urine and not in feces 
after 8 weeks on the WB diet compared to that in 4 weeks, but no anthocyanins 
were detected in plasma, liver, and brain samples either in the C or WB groups. 
Metabolites of ACNs were detected in the plasma, urine, feces, and tissues of 
both the C and WB groups, but the urinary excretion of hippuric acid increased 
significantly after 4 and 8 weeks of WB consumption. Thus, it seems that ACNs 
are metabolized by the intestinal microflora to respective phenyl-alkyl acids, 
which can be further metabolized to benzoic acid. In conclusion, ACNs are 
bioavailable in rats, and the extent of their metabolism and excretion is based 
on diet duration. Additionally, urinary hippuric acid content could represent a 
potential biomarker of ACNs absorption and metabolism in the SD rat under the 
present experimental conditions.

We describe a liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation tandem mass

secoiridoid oleuropein and its bioactive metabolite hydroxytyrosol in rat plasma 
and urine. Samples were prepared by liquid-liquid extraction using ethyl acetate 
with a recovery for both compounds of about 100% in plasma and about 60% in 
urine. The chromatographic separation was performed with a RP-ODS column using a 
water-acetonitrile linear gradient. The calibration curve was linear for both 
biophenols over the range 2.5-1000 ng/ml (LOD 1.25 ng/ml) for plasma and 5-1000 
ng/ml (LOD 2.5 ng/ml) for urine. Plasma concentrations of oleuropein and 
hydroxytyrosol were measured after oral administration of a single dose (100 
mg/kg) of oleuropein. Analysis of treated rat plasma showed the presence of 
unmodified oleuropein, reaching a peak value of 200 ng/ml within 2 h, with a 
small amount of hydroxytyrosol, whereas in urine, both compounds were mainly 
found as glucuronides.

The potential of phytoconstituents from Gomphostigma virgatum to modulate 
molecular markers of oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, which are two 
major contributors to the development of numerous diseases, is still unknown. 
The present study aimed to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
potentials of G. virgatum in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 
cells, as well as to isolate bioactive ingredients via a silica-gel column 
fractionation. Further, a quantitative estimation of phenolics and flavonoids 
was carried out using colorimetric methods, and liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry was utilized to identify potential bioactive compounds. The results 
showed that G. virgatum hydroethanolic leaf extract (GVHLE) and its isolated 
fraction Ff strongly scavenged free radicals, such as ABTS•+, DPPH•, and 
Fe3+-TPTZ, and suppressed LPS-induced NO and ROS production in a dose-dependent 
manner. Moreover, fraction Ff decreased the production of IL-1β, and TNF-α in 
LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells, and it enhanced the release of IL-10 
and restored the expression levels of antioxidant markers, such as SOD, CAT, and 
GSH. Phytochemical investigation of GVHLE and fraction Ff revealed that they 
contain significant amounts of phenolics and flavonoids that offer protection 
against free radicals and damage caused by them. The identification of acteoside 
as the major compound in GVHLE and fraction Ff is sufficient to support its 
substantial contribution to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. 
These findings clearly provide evidence supporting the medicinal use of G. 
virgatum in the treatment of oxidative stress and inflammatory diseases, thus 
opening further investigation on this plant species as a source of bioactive 
compounds for the development of dietary supplements and herbal remedies.

White, blue, red and purple corns (Zea mays L.) were lime-cooked to obtain masa 
for tortillas. The total phenolics and anthocyanins content, antioxidant 
activity expressed as total reducing power (TRP), peroxyl radical bleaching 
(PRAC), total antioxidant activity (TAA) and quinone reductase (QR) induction in 
the murine hepatoma (Hepa 1 c1c7 cell line) as a biological marker for phase II 
detoxification enzymes were investigated. Among the extracts prepared from raw 
corn varieties the highest concentration of total phenolics, anthocyanins, 
antioxidant index and induction of QR-inducing activity were found in the 
Veracruz 42 (Ver 42) genotype. The nixtamalization process (masa) reduced total 
phenolics, anthocyanins and antioxidant activities and the ability for QR 
induction when was compared to raw grain. Processing masa into tortillas also 
negatively affected total phenolics, anthocyanin concentration, antioxidant 
activities, and QR induction in the colored corn varieties. The blue variety and 
its corresponding masa and tortillas did not induce QR. Ver 42 genotype and 
their products (masa and tortilla) showed the greatest antioxidant activity and 
capacity to induce QR.

This study aimed at evaluating the effect of high-energy milling (HEM) and 
traditional nixtamalization (TN) on bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity 
in nixtamalized creole corn flours obtained from a maize genotype cultivated 
under rainy temporal conditions in the Mexican semidesert. Four creole grains, 
including San José de Gracia white and blue (WG and BG), Negritas (NG), and 
Ahualulco white corn grains (SG), were used. For HEM nixtamalization, corn 
grains were hammer-milled; then, two different conditions were evaluated: 
treatment H1, with raw flours with 14% moisture content and 1.1% Ca(OH)2, and 
treatment H2, with raw corn flours with a 23% moisture content and 1.4% Ca(OH)2. 
The TN process was utilized as a control. TN recorded significant losses in 
luminosity value L* (p < 0.05), while HEM nixtamalized blue corn flours remained 
close to -b* values, that is, near to those of raw flour. Anthocyanin content 
showed higher content values in HEM treatments compared with TN (759.55 and 
252.53 mg cyanidin 3-O-β-D-glucoside (C3G)/kg, respectively) (p < 0.05). Total 
soluble phenolic content was higher in HEM nixtamalization compared with the 
traditional process, except for WH2 and SH2 (H2 treatment for WG and SG). Two 
redundant radical scavenging assays were used: antioxidant capacity (DPPH assay) 
exhibited less value in nixtamalized flours than in raw flour (p < 0.05). 
Antioxidant activity by (ABTS) assay was higher in HEM than in TN. Nixtamalized 
flours produced by HEM demonstrated more improvement in nutraceutical properties 
than those produced employing TN.

The huge amount of citrus peel produced worldwide represents an economic burden 
for society. However, this agricultural by-product is a rich source of natural 
molecules, potentially endowed with interesting pharmacological activities. In 
this regard, we decided to investigate if the polymethoxyflavones contained in 
citrus peel waste could be exploited as novel vasorelaxant agents. A 
hydroalcoholic blond orange (Citrus sinensis) peel extract, obtained by 
ultrasonication, was partitioned in dichloromethane. Column chromatography 
allowed for the isolation of four polymethoxyflavones, namely, scutellarein 
tetramethyl ether, nobiletin, tangeretin, and sinensetin, identified by nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and UPLC-HRMS/MS and confirmed by 
multivariate curve resolution of NMR fractional spectra. The four molecules 
showed interesting in vitro vasorelaxant activity, at least, in part, due to the 
blockade of smooth muscle CaV1.2 channels. Molecular modeling and docking 
analysis elucidated the binding mode of the polymethoxyflavones at the homology 
model of the rat CaV1.2c subunit and provided the structural basis to 
rationalise the highest activity of scutellarein tetramethyl ether in the set 
and the dramatic effect of the additional methoxy group occurring in nobiletin 
and sinensetin. In conclusion, citrus peel can be considered a freely available, 
valuable source of vasoactive compounds worthy of pharmaceutical and/or 
nutraceutical exploitation.

OBJECTIVE: Because consumption of teas may be associated with potential health 
benefits due to its content in polyphenols and in Western countries the 
consumption of tea is equally divided between the hot and the ready-to-drink 
(RTD) cold versions of this typical beverage, the aim of this work was to study 
the absorption and metabolism of flavan-3-ols in human volunteers after the 
ingestion of a commercial RTD tea.
METHODS: A feeding study was carried out in 20 healthy human volunteers and 
urine samples were collected for 24h after tea ingestion. Flavan-3-ols-derived 
molecules were identified and quantified in urine samples by high-performance 
liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection.
RESULTS: Eight relevant metabolites were identified in urine, all modified 
flavan-3-ols with the exception of unmetabolized gallic acid. The urinary 
excretion of flavan-3-ols was equal to 7.2% of the intake with tea. Gallic acid, 
which was abundant in the RTD tea used in this study, reached a 4.5% of the 
drunken amount.
CONCLUSIONS: The bioavailability values observed are in agreement with previous 
reports, although the dosage of polyphenols ingested in this study is remarkably 
lower. Moreover, the use of a group of 20 volunteers, more than the average 
number of subjects used for usual human acute-feeding studies involving 
polyphenols, provides additional credibility to the results. After drinking the 
RTD ice tea used in this study, the internal compartments are exposed to 
non-marginal doses of flavanols and flavanol metabolites up to 24h.

This systematic review summarizes findings from human studies investigating the 
different routes of absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion (ADME) of 
dietary flavan-3-ols and their circulating metabolites in healthy subjects. 
Literature searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science. 
Human intervention studies using single and/or multiple intake of flavan-3-ols 
from food, extracts, and pure compounds were included. Forty-nine human 
intervention studies met inclusion criteria. Up to 180 metabolites were 
quantified from blood and urine samples following intake of flavan-3-ols, mainly 
as phase 2 conjugates of microbial catabolites (n = 97), with 
phenyl-γ-valerolactones being the most representative ones (n = 34). Phase 2 
conjugates of monomers and phenyl-γ-valerolactones, the main compounds in both 
plasma and urine, reached two peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of 260 and 
88 nmol/L at 1.8 and 5.3 h (Tmax) after flavan-3-ol intake. They contributed to 
the bioavailability of flavan-3-ols for over 20%. Mean bioavailability for 
flavan-3-ols was moderate (31 ± 23%, n bioavailability values = 20), and it 
seems to be scarcely affected by the amount of ingested compounds. While intra- 
and inter-source differences in flavan-3-ol bioavailability emerged, mean 
flavan-3-ol bioavailability was 82% (n = 1) and 63% (n = 2) after 
(-)-epicatechin and nut (hazelnuts, almonds) intake, respectively, followed by 
25% after consumption of tea (n = 7), cocoa (n = 5), apples (n = 3) and grape 
(n = 2). This highlights the need to better clarify the metabolic yield with 
which monomer flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins are metabolized in humans. This 
work clarified in a comprehensive way for the first time the ADME of a 
(poly)phenol family, highlighting the pool of circulating compounds that might 
be determinants of the putative beneficial effects linked to flavan-3-ol intake. 
Lastly, methodological inputs for implementing well-designed human and 
experimental model studies were provided.

Determination of free phenolic compounds in potato samples was optimized using a 
high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with on-line diode array 
detection. This method was applied to samples of four cultivars of potatoes 
harvested in Tenerife (Canary Islands). The free phenolic compounds found in the 
potato samples were (+)-catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric 
acid, and ferulic acid. Potato samples belonging to Colorada cultivar, ssp. 
andigena, had mean concentrations of total phenolic compounds and chlorogenic 
acid higher than those found for Kerr's Pink and Cara cultivars, ssp. tuberosum, 
and for Negra cultivar, S. x chaucha. In contrast, p-coumaric acid was not 
detected in any potato samples of the Colorada cultivar. Traditional potatoes 
presented a higher mean concentration of ferulic acid than recently imported 
potatoes. A significant and negative correlation was established between 
(+)-catechin and p-coumaric acid. A considerable contribution to the daily 
intake of flavonoids was observed with the actual consumption of potatoes.

The pigments responsible for the yellow-orange coloration of apple juices have 
remained largely unknown up to now. Four French cider apple juices were produced 
in conditions similar to those used in the cider-making industry. The oxidized 
juices, characterized using the CIE L a b parameters, displayed various colors 
depending on the apple variety and native phenolic composition. HPLC-DAD-MS 
revealed contrasting pigment profiles related to oxidized tanning and nontanning 
molecules. The latter were divided into two groups according to their polarity 
and their visible spectra. With regard to phenolic classes, flavanol monomers 
and hydroxycinnamic acids played an essential role in the formation of oxidation 
products. Interestingly, dihydrochalcones appeared to include precursors of some 
yellow compounds. Indeed, the yellow pigment phloretin xyloglucoside oxidation 
product (PXGOPj), derived from phloretin xyloglucoside, was clearly identified 
in apple juices as a xyloglucose analogue of the yellow pigment phloridzin 
oxidation product (POPj), previously characterized in a model solution by Le 
Guernevé et al. (Tetrahedron Lett. 2004, 45 (35), 6673-6677).

Collagen peptides derived from fish skin may be limited in food applications due 
to undesirable flavors. To investigate the effects of Maillard reaction 
modification on their physicochemical and flavor properties, collagen peptides 
from tilapia skin were prepared via enzymatic hydrolysis, followed by the 
Maillard reaction with four reducing sugars (xylose, ribose, glucose and 
glucosamine) through a combined procedure involving simultaneous enzyme 
inactivation and Maillard reaction at 100 °C. The resultant Maillard reaction 
products (MRPs) were characterized by analyzing free amino groups, peptide size 
distribution and color difference, while the reaction progression was monitored 
using UV absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. The flavor profile of MRPs 
was analyzed through quantitative descriptive sensory evaluation and GC-MS 
coupled with principal component analysis. Among the four reducing sugars 
tested, glucosamine-induced Maillard reaction products exhibited the most 
pronounced physicochemical and sensory improvements. Specifically, 
glucosamine-MRPs showed the greatest reduction in free amino groups (0.69 
μmol/L) and a notable decrease in high-molecular-weight peptides (3.31%), 
accompanied by an increase in low-molecular-weight fractions. Colorimetric 
analysis revealed a marked color change (ΔE = 31.78), and spectral analysis 
further confirmed intensified UV absorbance and fluorescence intensity in the 
glucosamine group, indicating advanced reaction progression. Sensory evaluation 
demonstrated a significant reduction in bitterness and enhancement of umami and 
saltiness. Moreover, GC-MS analysis revealed that the glucosamine-treated group 
exhibited the most favorable volatile profile, characterized by an increase in 
aromatic compounds and a substantial decrease in undesirable odorants. This 
study provides a theoretical basis for controlling the undesirable flavor of 
collagen peptides through low-extent Maillard reactions by different reducing 
sugars.

Common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are a nutritionally valuable crop with high 
levels of bioactive compounds, including phenolics with antioxidant and 
antibacterial properties. However, the functional potential of local Chilean 
landraces remains underexplored. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) can 
influence plant metabolism, enhancing the accumulation of secondary metabolites. 
This study evaluates the effect of PGPB (Bacillus proteolyticus Cyn1, Bacillus 
safensis Cyn2, and their consortium) on the total phenolic content (TPC), 
antioxidant capacity, and antibacterial activity of extracts from the Chilean 
landrace 'Sapito'. For this, 'Sapito' bean seeds were inoculated with individual 
PGPB strains and their consortium and cultivated under field conditions. 
Extracts from the seed coat and cotyledons were obtained using water, ethanol, 
and acetone. TPC was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu method, antioxidant 
activity was assessed via DPPH, ABTS, H₂O₂ scavenging, ferrous ion chelation, 
and FRAP assays, while antibacterial activity was evaluated through agar 
diffusion, growth inhibition, and cell viability assays against Gram positive 
Bacillus cereus and Gram negative Pseudomonas putida. PGPB inoculation 
significantly influenced TPC, with consortium-treated seeds accumulating higher 
phenolic content in aqueous extracts (95.9 ± 27.8 mg GAE/100 g dry seed). 
Antioxidant activity varied across treatments and solvents, with ethanolic and 
acetone extracts displaying the highest radical scavenging activities. 
Antibacterial assays revealed that ethanolic seed coat extracts exhibited 
stronger inhibition against B. cereus. In conclusion, this is the first study 
evaluating the impact of PGPB on the functional properties of a Chilean common 
bean landrace. The findings highlight the potential of microbial inoculation to 
enhance phenolic accumulation and bioactivity, supporting sustainable 
agriculture, food security, and germplasm conservation in the face of climate 
change.

Processed fruits and vegetables have been long considered to have lower 
nutritional value than their fresh commodities due to the loss of vitamin C 
during processing. This research group found vitamin C in apples contributed < 
0.4% of total antioxidant activity, indicating most of the activity comes from 
the natural combination of phytochemicals. This suggests that processed fruits 
and vegetables may retain their antioxidant activity despite the loss of vitamin 
C. Here it is shown that thermal processing elevated total antioxidant activity 
and bioaccessible lycopene content in tomatoes and produced no significant 
changes in the total phenolics and total flavonoids content, although loss of 
vitamin C was observed. The raw tomato had 0.76 +/- 0.03 micromol of vitamin C/g 
of tomato. After 2, 15, and 30 min of heating at 88 degrees C, the vitamin C 
content significantly dropped to 0.68 +/- 0.02, 0.64 +/- 0.01, and 0.54 +/- 0.02 
micromol of vitamin C/g of tomato, respectively (p < 0.01). The raw tomato had 
2.01 +/- 0.04 mg of trans-lycopene/g of tomato. After 2, 15, and 30 min of 
heating at 88 degrees C, the trans-lycopene content had increased to 3.11+/- 
0.04, 5.45 +/- 0.02, and 5.32 +/- 0.05 mg of trans-lycopene/g of tomato (p < 
0.01). The antioxidant activity of raw tomatoes was 4.13 +/- 0.36 micromol of 
vitamin C equiv/g of tomato. With heat treatment at 88 degrees C for 2, 15, and 
30 min, the total antioxidant activity significantly increased to 5.29 +/- 0.26, 
5.53 +/- 0.24, and 6.70 +/- 0.25 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of tomato, 
respectively (p < 0.01). There were no significant changes in either total 
phenolics or total flavonoids. These findings indicate thermal processing 
enhanced the nutritional value of tomatoes by increasing the bioaccessible 
lycopene content and total antioxidant activity and are against the notion that 
processed fruits and vegetables have lower nutritional value than fresh produce. 
This information may have a significant impact on consumers' food selection by 
increasing their consumption of fruits and vegetables to reduce the risks of 
chronic diseases.

The aim of the present study was to develop breads by incorporating Spirulina 
platensis powder and to study their organoleptic acceptability, antioxidant 
activity, storage conditions and shelf life of value added acceptable breads. 
Spirulina platensis powder was mixed with wheat flour at different levels (2, 4, 
6 and 8%) to prepare nutritive breads. Breads were developed and organoleptic 
evaluations were performed to find out the most appropriate level of 
supplementation of Spirulina platensis powder. The results showed that 6% 
Spirulina supplemented breads provided higher contents of total phenolic content 
(1.79 mg GAE/g) and antioxidant activity (16.51%). On the basis of organoleptic 
characteristics, overall acceptability scores indicate that Spirulina 
incorporated breads can be stored up to 2 days at room temperature and up to 
4 days at refrigeration temperature without any preservatives. Fat acidity 
content and total bacterial count were found increased as time period increased 
but did not exceed the acceptable limit as given by BIS (Bureau of Indian 
Standards). Spirulina supplements are available in the market but normally 
people does not consume it may be because of less awareness or other reasons but 
if this super food is incorporated in food products like bread, which is 
consumed by everyone will aid to food security and malnutrition of developing 
countries.

The effects of the phenolic compounds of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on AGS 
cells have never been studied so far, which is the aim of this study. The 
profiles of the main phenolic components in EVOOs, mainly secoiridoid compounds 
derived from the transformation of oleuropein during the olive milling process, 
were evaluated and compared. Oils of different origins were evaluated aiming at 
verifying whether chemical differences in the phenolic composition of the dry 
extracts played a role in the metabolism and in maintaining the cellular redox 
state of AGS cells. The following key enzymes of some metabolic pathways were 
studied: lactate dehydrogenase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, glucose 6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and hexokinase. 
As confirmed through PCA analysis, pretreatments with the dry extracts of EVOOs 
at different concentrations appeared to be able to counteract the enzymatic 
activity alterations due to oxidative stress induced by H2O2 1 mM and 2 mM. The 
studied phytocomplexes showed the ability to protect AGS cells from oxidative 
damage and the secoiridoid derivatives from both oleuropein and ligstroside 
contributed to the observed effects. The results suggested that EVOOs with 
medium to high concentrations of phenols can exert this protection.

Common bean effects on health have been related to its dietary fiber content and 
other active compounds. This study assessed the content of flavonoids, 
coumestrol, phenolic acids, galactooligosaccharides, and phytic acid in wild and 
cultivated Mexican common bean seeds (raw and cooked) and that of flavonoids, 
coumestrol, and phenolic acids in germinated bean seeds. The presence of 
isoflavones in raw bean seeds was not confirmed by the UV spectra. Quercetin, 
kaempferol, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and vanillic 
acid mean contents were 10.9, 52.3, 10.1, 9.6, 5.4, and 18.2 microg/g, 
respectively; raffinose, stachyose, verbascose, and phytic acid mean contents 
were 8.5, 56.3, 5.5, and 11.5 mg/g, respectively, in raw seeds. All compounds 
were affected by autoclaving, and germination resulted in a de novo synthesis of 
flavonols, phytoestrogens, and phenolic acids. The impact on health of common 
bean seed is affected by dietary burden, specific compounds content, and 
processing. On the other hand, germinated bean seed or beans sprouts may be 
sources of antioxidants and phytoestrogens.

The black tartary buckwheat husk (BTBH), a processing by-product, is rich in 
nutrients and bioactive compounds. This study investigated the effects of 
roasting treatment on the composition, digestion, and antioxidant properties of 
free and bound phenolics in BTBH. The roasting treatment enhanced the 
extractability of free and bound phenolics by disrupting the grain matrix. 
Following roasting treatment, the phenolic content of BTBH increased 
significantly (p < 0.05), with increments of 8.61 mg GAE/g for free phenols and 
20.88 mg GAE/g for bound phenols. Furthermore, HPLC-Q-Exactive Plus Orbitrap 
HRMS was employed to characterize the free and bound phenolic compounds in BTBH 
of roasting, revealing 22 phenolics and 3 non-phenolic compounds, with 
flavonoids being the major phenolic compounds in BTBH. After the roasting 
treatment, the content of all six phenolic compounds, except for rutin, showed a 
significant increase. During in vitro digestion, roasting treatment is more 
favorable for increasing the content of phenolic compounds and enhancing their 
antioxidant capacity. This research highlights the potential of roasted 
treatment to increase phenolic content and improve the bioactivity of BTBH.

UV-B and IR-A radiation are important inducers of biological changes in skin 
involving ROS generation. The overloading of antioxidant defense mechanisms by 
ROS production could lead to photoaging and photocarcinogenesis processes. 
Various traditional usages are reported for Aralia nudicaulis L. extracts, 
including treatment of dermatological disorders. Antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory properties have already been reported for other Aralia species 
possibly due to the presence of phenolic compounds. However, the phenolic 
composition and the potential activity of A. nudicaulis rhizomes extract against 
oxidative stress and UV/IR damages have not been investigated. The main aims of 
this study were to prepare a fraction enriched in phenolic compounds (FEPC) from 
A. nudicaulis rhizomes, to identify its major phenolic compounds and to assess 
its potential for protective effects against oxidative stress induced by UV-B, 
IR-A or inflammation. A quantitative LC-MS study of FEPC shows that chlorogenic, 
caffeic and protocatechuic acids are the main phenolic compounds present, with 
concentrations of 15.6%, 15.3% and 4.8% of the total composition, respectively. 
With a validated analytical method, those compounds were quantified over 
different stages of the growing period. As for biological potential, first this 
extract demonstrates antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Furthermore, 
ROS generation induced by IR-A and UV-B were strongly inhibited by A. nudicaulis 
extract, suggesting that Aralia nudicaulis L. rhizome extract could protect 
dermal cells against oxidative stress induced by UV-B and IR-A.

The taste profile of oolong tea is intricately shaped by origins and roasting. 
Herein, a comprehensive approach integrating non-targeted metabolomics, 
quantitative analysis and sensory evaluations was employed to analyze the taste 
profile of oolong tea. 25 selected representative oolong teas, including 
Southern Fujian (MN), Northern Fujian (MB), and Taiwan (TW), were meticulously 
were classified into SX-RG-DD, GS, and TGY based on the chemical taste 
phenotypes. A total of 314 non-volatile compounds were identified, among which 
87 and 77 compounds, including catechin, theaflavins, flavonoids and amino acids 
were screened as critical taste metabolites responsible for regions and roasting 
degree, respectively. The reduction of bitter and astringent, coupled with the 
enhancement of umami, sweet and sweet aftertaste exhibited a correlation with 
the decrease in (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epicatechin (EC), 
(-)-epicatechin gallate (ECG) and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), while the 
increase in catechin (C). These findings provide insights for further research 
on optimizing tea quality and refining processing techniques.

Column liquid chromatography on a C18-bonded silica column with 
water-methanol-acetic acid as eluent was used to determine polyphenols and 
caffeine in tea. Without any pretreatment, catechin, epicatechin gallate, 
epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epicatechin and caffeine were 
separated successfully within 15 min. The detection limits (S/N = 3) of 
polyphenols studied were 1.8-24 mg/l at a detection wavelength 270 nm. The 
linear range of the peak area calibration curves for the analytes were over two 
orders of magnitude with a correlation coefficient of 0.996-0.999. Using this 
method, some Chinese tea samples were analyzed with a good reproducibility (RSD 
are below 5%).

Phenolic compounds in loquat fruit were identified as 5-caffeoylquinic acid 
(chlorogenic acid), neochlorogenic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, 5-p-feruloylquinic 
acid, protocatechuic acid, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, epicatechin, o-coumaric acid, 
ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid. Neochlorogenic acid was found to be dominant 
in the early stages of loquat fruit development. Both the concentrations and 
types of phenolic compounds were high in young fruit but then decreased steadily 
during growth. However, the concentration of chlorogenic acid increased during 
ripening and became predominant in ripe fruit. The large rise in chlorogenic 
acid concentration appears to be a characteristic of loquat fruit ripening. In 
all of the cultivars tested, the types of phenolic compounds were similar but 
the total phenolic content varied from 81.8 to 173.8 mg/100 g of fresh pulp. In 
the biosynthetic pathway of chlorogenic acid, the enzyme activities of 
phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (CL), and 
hydroxycinnamoyl CoA:quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (CQT) were high at the 
early stage of growth, diminished to low levels approximately 3 weeks prior to 
harvest, but then rose to a peak at 1 week before harvest. The changes of these 
enzyme activities seemed to be associated with variations in chlorogenic acid 
concentration during development, maturation, and ripening of loquat fruit.

BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic from the human pathogenic virus 
SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a major health hazard globally. The morbidity and 
transmission modality of this disease are severe and uncontrollable. As no 
effective clinical drugs are available for treatment of COVID-19 infection till 
to date and only vaccination is used as prophylaxis and its efficacy is 
restricted due to emergent of new variants of SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgent 
need for effective drugs for its treatment.
PURPOSE: The aim of this review was to provide a detailed analysis of 
anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG), a major 
catechin constituent of green tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze) beverage to 
highlight the scope of EGCG in clinical medicine as both prophylaxis and 
treatment of present COVID-19 infection. In addition, the factors related to 
poor oral bioavailabilty of EGCG was also analysed for a suggestion for future 
research in this direction.
STUDY DESIGN: We collected the published articles related to anti-SARS-CoV-2 
activity of EGCG against the original strain (Wuhan type) and its newly emerged 
variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
METHODS: A systematic search on the published literature was conducted in 
various databases including Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct and Scopus to 
collect the relevant literature.
RESULTS: The findings of this search demonstrate that EGCG shows potent 
antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 virus by preventing viral entry and 
replication in host cells in vitro models. The studies on the molecular 
mechanisms of EGCG in inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in host cells reveal 
that EGCG blocks the entry of the virus particles by interaction with the 
receptor binding domain (RBD) of viral spike (S) protein to host cell surface 
receptor protease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as well as suppression 
of the expressions of host proteases, ACE2, TMPRSS2 and GRP78, required for 
viral entry, by Nrf2 activation in host cells. Moreover, EGCG inhibits the 
activities of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), 
endoribonuclease Nsp15 in vitro models and of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 
(RdRp) in molecular docking model for suppression of viral replication. In 
addition, EGCG significantly inhibits viral inflammatory cytokine production by 
stimulating Nrf2- dependent host immune response in virus-infected cells. EGCG 
significantly reduces the elevated levels of HMGB1, a biomarker of sepsis, lung 
fibrosis and thrombotic complications in viral infections. EGCG potentially 
inhibits the infection of original (Wuhan type) strain of SARS-CoV-2 and other 
newly emerged variants as well as the infections of SARS-CoV-2 virus 
spike-protein of WT and its mutants-mediated pseudotyped viruses . EGCG shows 
maximum inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection when the host cells are 
pre-incubated with the drug prior to viral infection. A sorbitol/lecithin-based 
throat spray containing concentrated green tea extract rich in EGCG content 
significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in oral mucosa. Several factors 
including degradation in gastrointestinal environment, low absorption in small 
intestine and extensive metabolism of EGCG are responsible for its poor 
bioavailability in humans. Pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies of EGCG in 
humans reveal poor bioavailability of EGCG in human plasma and EGCG-4""-sulfate 
is its major metabolite. The concentration of EGCG-4""-sulfate in human plasma is 
almost equivalent to that of free EGCG (Cmax 177.9 vs 233.5 nmol/L). These 
findings suggest that inhibition of sulfation of EGCG is a crucial factor for 
improvement of its bioavailability. In vitro study on the mechanism of EGCG 
sulfonation indicates that sulfotransferases, SULT1A1 and SULT1A3 are 
responsible for sulfonation in human liver and small intestine, respectively. 
Some attempts including structural modifications, and nanoformulations of EGCG 
and addition of nutrients with EGCG have been made to improve the 
bioavailability of EGCG.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that EGCG has strong antiviral 
activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection independent of viral strains (Wuhan type 
(WT), other variants) by inhibition of viral entry and replication in host cells 
in vitro models. EGCG may be useful in reduction of this viral load in salivary 
glands of COVID-19 patients, if it is applied in mouth and throat wash 
formulations in optimal concentrations. EGCG could be a promising candidate in 
the development of effective vaccine for prevention of the infections of newly 
emergent strains of SARS-CoV-2 virus. EGCG might be useful also as a clinical 
medicine for treatment of COVID-19 patients if its bioavailability in human 
plasma is enhanced.

The possibility of proving the undeclared addition of pumpkin puree in apricot 
nectars and jams has been investigated by using the phenol compound fingerprint 
and sensory evaluation. The cheaper pumpkin admixtures in apricot nectars and 
jams could not be detected by the sensory evaluation, particularly if present in 
quantities of <15%. The lower admixtures of pumpkin puree in apricot nectars and 
jams could be detected by the presence of syringic acid, a phenolic compound 
characteristic of the investigated pumpkins (Cucurbita pepo cv. Gleisdorff and 
Table Gold, Cucurbita maxima cv. Turkinja, and Cucurbita moschata cv. Argenta). 
Syringic acid was isolated from pumpkin puree and determined by using HPLC with 
diode array detection. By using the phenolic profile, undeclared pumpkin 
admixture (> or =5%) in the apricot nectars and jams could be proven.

The lentil (Lens culinaris L.) is one of the most important legumes (family, 
Fabaceae). It is a natural functional food rich in many bioactive compounds, 
such as polyphenols, saponins and phytosterols. Several studies have 
demonstrated that the consumption of lentils is potentially important in 
reducing the incidence of a number of chronic diseases, due to their bioactive 
compounds. The most common polyphenols in lentils include phenolic acids, 
flavan-3-ol, flavonols, anthocyanidins, proanthocyanidins or condensed tannins, 
and anthocyanins, which play an important role in the prevention of several 
degenerative diseases in humans, due to their antioxidant activity. Furthermore, 
lentil polyphenols are reported to have antidiabetic, cardioprotective and 
anticancer activities. Lentil saponins are triterpene glycosides, mainly 
soyasaponins I and βg. These saponins have a plasma cholesterol-lowering effect 
in humans and are important in reducing the risk of many chronic diseases. 
Moreover, high levels of phytosterols have been reported in lentils, especially 
in the seed coat, and β-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol are the most 
abundant. Beyond their hypocholesterolemic effect, phytosterols in lentils are 
known for their anti-inflammatory activity. In this review, the current 
information on the nutritional composition, bioactive compounds including 
polyphenols, saponins and phytosterols, and their associated health-promoting 
effects are discussed.

BACKGROUND: Consumption of pulse crops, including field pea, is considered 
effective for a healthy diet. Hulls (seed coats) play an important role for 
protection of the cotyledon and embryo, but also as mediating positive effects 
on health outcomes. The biochemical attributes of field pea hulls were thus 
assessed to determine the occurrence of specific phytochemicals and their 
genotypic variability.
RESULTS: Sequestered bioproducts in mature hulls predominantly consisted of 
trans-lutein and chlorophylls a and b. Trace amounts of other carotenoid and 
pheophytin metabolites were identified. In developing hulls, violaxanthin, 
neoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, chlorophylls a and b and β-carotene were 
detected. Genotypic differences in the accumulation of lutein and chlorophylls a 
and b were observed over years and locations. Polyphenolics and hydroxybenzoic 
acids were detected in the 'dun' and 'maple' field pea types-the only genotypes 
to have pigmented hulls. Unextractable patches of condensed tannin influenced 
the visual uniformity of the maple and dun genotypes, CDC Rocket and CDC 
Dundurn.
CONCLUSIONS: Within the yellow and green market classes, carotenoid and 
chlorophyll accumulation was consistent. Green cotyledon varieties sequestered 
higher concentrations of lutein than the yellow cotyledon varieties. Maple and 
dun types were more variable, reflective of different selection criteria. The 
occurrence of flavonoid-related compounds was correlated only with pigmented 
seed coat genotypes. The dietary potential of the chlorophylls and carotenoids 
that accumulated in the hulls split from the green and yellow field pea types is 
discussed as a value-added prospect in food supplements.

BACKGROUND: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is one of the most abundant and 
important bioactive polyphenolic compounds in green tea. However, despite its 
potent antioxidant effects, its neuroprotective effects on chronic high altitude 
(HA)-induced nerve damage have not been reported. The purpose of this study is 
to use quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) with pathology to dynamically 
evaluate the status of brain damage and the effect of EGCG.
METHODS: A model of HA environments-induced brain injury was established of 
Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats in a natural plateau environment for 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 
12 weeks and 20 weeks. Behavioral alterations were then observed and assessed 
with the open field test (OFT) and Morris water maze (MWM) test. The microglial 
activation, nissl staining and neural degeneration by Fluoro Jade B in the 
hippocampus of the rats were observed by immunohistochemistry. In the rats, 
serum erythropoietin (EPO), hippocampal inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β 
[IL-1β], interleukin-6 [IL-6] and tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α]), ferritin, 
oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione peroxidase [GSH-Px], 
catalase [CAT] and malondialdehyde [MDA]) were detected using ELISA kits and 
biochemical methods. Iron accumulation was observed by QSM and colorimetry. Iron 
metabolisms (ceruloplasmin [Cp], transferrin [Tf], divalent metal transport1 
[DMT1] and hepcidin [Hep]) were detected using qPCR. Neural ultrastructural 
changes were evaluated with electron microscope. Salidroside treatment was 
chosen as the positive control group in ELISA, biochemical detection and 
electron microscopy.
RESULTS: The susceptibility values in the left and right hippocampus, the 
hippocampal ferritin, serum and hippocampal iron content increased significantly 
after HA exposure. The expression of hippocampal Cp and Hep decreased and the 
expression of Tf increased. Nissl staining revealed that the neurons of 
hippocampal CA1 region of h-20w group were small and irregular, atrophied, and 
nuclear shrinkage. Tissue oxidative stress and inflammatory indicators (MDA, 
TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) increased while antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GSH-Px) 
decreased. EGCG attenuated HA environments-induced cognitive impairment, iron 
accumulation, microglial activation and neural degeneration. The effects of EGCG 
in reducing EPO and the metal chelating property with respect to iron were 
dose-dependent, with effects of EGCG (50 mg/kg) being similar to those of 
salidroside (50 mg/kg).
CONCLUSIONS: EGCG can act as a neuroprotective agent against chronic HA 
environments-mediated neural injuries. QSM provides a potential complementary 
imaging technique to detect the effect of treating HA diseases.

Anthocyanins and derived components of red wines were determined by microHPLC 
using a 1 mm ID HPLC column coupled on-line with an MS detector equipped with an 
ESI (ElectroSpray Ionisation) source. The use of microcolumn HPLC greatly 
enhanced detection performance, allowing direct identification of components 
present in the fraction. Nineteen anthocyanins were detected. Fifteen were 
identified, two were tentatively identified, and only the aglycon of the 
remaining two components was certainly identified. Six anthocyanin-derived 
pigments, supposedly formed during wine maturation, were also investigated and 
found in a wine sample. The analysis of red wine anthocyanins was also carried 
out by injecting a large sample volume onto a 0.32 mm ID HPLC column, using the 
column focusing technique, in order to decrease the limit of detection and 
quantification of components present in a very small amounts.

Four high yielding and early maturing cultivars of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) 
namely UPAS-120, ICPL-87, ICPL-151 and, especially, Manak, contained significant 
amounts of polyphenols (1075 to 1328 mg/100g), which may limit their 
utilization. The effectiveness of soaking (6, 12 and 18 h, 30 degrees C), 
soaking and dehulling, ordinary cooking, pressure cooking and germination (24, 
36, 48 h, 30 degrees C) in reducing the levels of polyphenols was investigated. 
A decrease in the polyphenolic contents varying from 4 to 26 percent in 
different pigeon pea cultivar was achieved. Pressure cooking of soaked-dehulled 
seeds was found to be the most effective method, followed by sprouting for 48 h, 
ordinary cooking of soaked-dehulled seeds, and pressure cooking of soaked whole 
seeds followed by sprouting for 36 h.

Eight varieties of lettuce (Lactuca sativum) and three varieties of endive 
(Cichorium endivia) were analyzed for flavonoid composition and content. Total 
flavonoid contents, expressed as units of aglycon for fresh material, were in 
the ranges of 0.3-229 microg/g for lettuce and 44-248 microg/g for endive. Five 
quercetin conjugates [quercetin 3-O-galactoside, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, 
quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, quercetin 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside, and quercetin 
3-O-rhamnoside] and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide were measured in the green-leafed 
lettuce and an additional two cyanidin conjugates [cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and 
cyanidin 3-O-[(6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] in the red-leafed varieties. Three 
kaempferol conjugates [kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-glucuronide, and 
kaempferol 3-O-[6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] were measured in each of the endive 
varieties. The presence and identity of kaempferol 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside in 
endive was shown for the first time. Shredding of lettuce leaf followed by 
exposure to light produced significant losses of the flavonoid moiety in the 
green oak leaf (94%), red oak leaf (43%), iceberg (36%), green batavia (25%), 
lollo biondo (24%), and lollo rosso (6%) samples, whereas cos and green salad 
bowl samples did not show an overall loss. Shredding of endive also produced 
loss of the flavonoid moiety in escarole (32%), fine frisee (13%), and coarse 
frisee (8%). Significant demalonation was observed for both the quercetin and 
cyanidin glucosides in lettuce, whereas a similar degradation of the kaempferol 
analogue was found in endive tissue. Storage of whole heads of both lettuce and 
endive in the dark at 1 degrees C and 98% humidity for 7 days resulted in losses 
of total flavonol glycosides in the range of 7-46%. The identification of the 
amounts, position of substitution, and nature of the sugars is important for 
understanding the potential bioavailability and biological activities of 
flavonoids in salads.

We determined the uptake and excretion of low doses of polyphenols in six 
subjects who each consumed 1.1 L of an alcoholic cider beverage. Over a 24-h 
period, no phloretin was detected in plasma (detection limit = 0.036 
micromol/L), but 21 +/- 5% of the dose (4.8 mg) was excreted in the urine. In 
contrast, from a low dose of 1.6-mg quercetin equivalents, no quercetin was 
found in urine or plasma, but 3'-methyl quercetin was detected in plasma [C(max) 
(maximum concentration) = 0.14 +/- 0.19 micromol/L; range: 0 to 0.44 
micromol/L]. No flavanol monomers (dose of free (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin 
= 3.5 mg) were detected in urine or plasma (detection limit: 0.01 micromol/L). 
Caffeic acid (total dose including esters = 11 mg) was detected only in plasma 
within 2 h, with C(max) = 0.43 +/- 0.3 micromol/L (range: 0.18 to 0.84 
micromol/L). An almost 3-fold increase in hippuric acid was detected in 24-h 
urine (74 +/- 29 micromol/L; range: 38-116 micromol/L), compared with a prestudy 
value of 19 +/- 9 micromol/L. These data show that polyphenols are taken up from 
cider, that phloretin is excreted in the urine and suggest that low doses of 
quercetin are extensively methylated in humans.

Berries are known to contain phenolic substances (i.e., flavonoids and phenolic 
acids), which comprise two large and heterogeneous groups of biologically active 
nonnutrients. This investigation evaluated the content and profile of the 
phenolic compounds present in six different berries found in Northern Europe. 
The latter included bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), cowberry (Vaccinium 
vitis-idaea), cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccus), strawberry (Fragaria ananassa), 
black currant (Ribes nigrum), and red currant (Ribes rubrum). The study was 
focused on two areas. The first involved the extraction and analysis of berries 
for total phenolic content and determination of their antioxidant activity. The 
total phenolic level of berries was correlated with their antioxidant activity. 
Second, the berry extracts were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis to 
determine the content and profile of selected bioactive compounds. The analytes 
of interest included trans-resveratrol, cinnamic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric 
acid, quercetin, and morin.

Antioxidant capacity, as measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), 
and total phenolic and total anthocyanin contents were evaluated in fruit 
tissues of 87 highbush blueberry (Vacciniumcorymbosum L.) and 
species-introgressed highbush blueberry cultivars. ORAC and phenolic levels were 
evaluated in leaf tissues of the same materials. Average values for ORAC, 
phenolics, and anthocyanins in fruit were 15.9 ORAC units, 1.79 mg/g (gallic 
acid equivalents), and 0.95 mg/g (cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents), 
respectively. Cv. Rubel had the highest ORAC per gram of fresh weight values, at 
31.1 units, and cv. Elliott had the highest values on the basis of ORAC per 
square centimeter of surface area. In leaf tissue, values for both ORAC and 
phenolics were significantly higher than in fruit tissue, with mean values of 
490 ORAC units and 44.80 mg/g (gallic acid equivalents), respectively. Leaf ORAC 
had a low, but significant, correlation with fruit phenolics and anthocyanins, 
but not with fruit ORAC. An analysis of ORAC values versus calculated midparent 
values in 11 plants from the 87-cultivar group in which all parents were tested 
suggested that, across cultivars, ORAC inheritance is additive. An investigation 
of ORAC values in a family of 44 cv. Rubel x Duke seedlings showed negative 
epistasis for ORAC values, suggesting Rubel may have gene combinations 
contributing to ORAC that are broken up during hybridization.

Citrus flavonoids have been investigated for their biological activity, with 
both anti-inflammatory and -carcinogenic effects being reported. However, little 
information is known on the bioavailability of these compounds in vivo. The 
objectives of this study were to determine the tissue distribution of naringenin 
after gastric gavage of [3H]-naringenin to rats. Unlabelled naringenin was also 
used to quantify the levels of naringenin and its major metabolites in tissues 
and eliminated in the urine and faeces. Significant radioactivity was detected 
in the plasma as well as all tissues examined 2h post-gavage. After 18h, higher 
levels of radioactivity were retained in plasma and tissues (55% of the 
administered radioactivity). Investigation of the nature of metabolites, using 
unlabelled naringenin, revealed that the glucuronides were the major components 
in plasma, tissues and urine, in addition to the colonic metabolite 
3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid, detected in the urine. The aglycone was the 
form extensively retained in tissues after 18h post-gavage. Total identified 
metabolites detected after 18h in most tissues were only 1-5% of the levels 
detected after 2h. However, the brain, lungs and heart retained 27, 20 and 11%, 
respectively, relative to the total metabolites detected at 2h. While 
radioactive detection suggests increased levels of breakdown products of 
naringenin after 18 h versus 2 h, the products identified using unlabelled 
naringenin are not consistent with this, suggesting that a predominant 
proportion of the naringenin breakdown products at 18 h are retained as smaller 
decomposition molecules which cannot yet be identified.

The effects of cooking treatments (boiling, autoclaving and microwave cooking) 
and germination on the nutritional composition and antinutritional factors of 
chickpeas were studied. Cooking treatments and/or germination caused significant 
(p < 0.05) decreases in fat, total ash, carbohydrate fractions, antinutritional 
factors, minerals and B-vitamins. Germination was less effective than cooking 
treatments in reducing trypsin inhibitor, hemagglutinin activity, tannins and 
saponins; it was more effective in reducing phytic acid, stachyose and 
raffinose. Cooking treatments and germination decreased the concentrations of 
lysine, tryptophan, total aromatic and sulfur-containing amino acids. However, 
cooked and germinated chickpeas were still higher in lysine, isoleucine and 
total aromatic amino acid contents than the FAO/WHO reference. The losses in 
B-vitamins and minerals in chickpeas cooked by microwaving were smaller than in 
those cooked by boiling and autoclaving. Germination resulted in greater 
retention of all minerals and B-vitamins compared to cooking treatments. In 
vitro protein digestibility, protein efficiency ratio and essential amino acid 
index were improved by all treatments. The chemical score and limiting amino 
acid of chickpeas subjected to the various treatments varied considerably, 
depending on the type of treatment. Based on these results, microwave cooking 
appears to be the best alternative for legume preparation in households and 
restaurants.

A HPLC method was developed for the analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside 
(SDG) and hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in milled defatted flaxseed flour. 
Direct extraction by 1 M NaOH for 1 h at 20 degrees C resulted in a higher yield 
than that obtained by hydrolysis of alcoholic extracts. An internal standard, 
o-coumaric acid, was used and the method was found to be easy, fast, and with 
good repeatability. On dry matter basis, different samples of flaxseeds varied 
considerably in their content of (+)-SDG (11.9-25.9 mg/g), (-)-SDG (2.2-5.0 
mg/g), p-coumaric acid glucoside (1.2-8.5 mg/g), and ferulic acid glucoside 
(1.6-5.0 mg/g).

Marinated silver carp is highly favored for its distinctive flavor profile, but 
the role of amino acid metabolism in the formation of characteristic flavors 
during marinating remains unclear. This study systematically investigated the 
formation and evolution mechanism of flavor during the marinating of silver carp 
through physicochemical analysis, microstructural characterization, flavor 
substance identification and metabolomic analysis. The marinating process 
promoted moisture migration and myofibril coarsening, leading to a progressive 
yellowing of color and a decline in hardness and chewiness of the marinated 
silver carp as cooking time increased. Although the total FAA content continued 
to decrease, the EAA/TAA ratio at both 90 min and 120 min met the ideal protein 
pattern recommended by FAO/WHO. Additionally, the non-targeted metabolome 
identified 1591 differential metabolites, of which 54 were significantly 
associated with amino acid metabolism. KEGG pathway analysis showed that the 
amino acid metabolic pathway (such as histidine metabolism, phenylalanine 
metabolism, and lysine biosynthesis) was dominant and its dynamic changes 
reflected the stage-specific characteristics of protein degradation. The 47 key 
compounds (VIP>1) identified by GC-MS showed significant positive correlation 
(r > 0.7, P < 0.05) with most organic acids and significant negative correlation 
(r < -0.7, P < 0.05) with most amino acids and their derivatives, highlighting 
the critical role of amino acid metabolism in flavor formation during the 
marinating of silver carp. These findings provide a scientific basis for the 
targeted modulation of flavor in marinated silver carp, offering insights for 
optimizing processing parameters to enhance sensory quality.

Power ultrasound as an emerging processing technology has been investigated for 
stimulating seeds to enhance germination and accumulation of health-promoting 
metabolites, such as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and phenolic compounds. This 
work was undertaken to evaluate the effects of power ultrasound (25 kHz) on the 
nutritional properties of germinated oats, and the microstructure of oat groats 
after treatment. The changes in the external and internal microstructures of the 
ultrasound-treated oats kernel were investigated using Environmental Scanning 
Electron Microscopy (ESEM) and 3D X-ray Micro Computed Tomography (Micro-CT). 
Physicochemical properties of oats including GABA, free sugars, avenanthramides, 
total phenolic content, and antioxidant capacities were enhanced after 
germination. Furthermore, the power ultrasound treatment for 5 min after soaking 
significantly enhanced the GABA (48-96 h), alanine (24-96 h), succinic acid 
(48-72 h), total phenolic content (24 h), and total avenanthramides (24 h) in 
the germinated oats.

Oat milling fractions were examined for concentrations of total phenolics, 
tocols, and phenolic acids and in vitro antioxidant activity to determine their 
potential as dietary antioxidants. Methanolic extracts of pearling fractions, 
flour and aspirations from flaking, and trichomes had high, intermediate, and 
low antioxidant activities, respectively, evaluated by the beta-carotene 
bleaching method. Pearling fractions were also highest in total phenolics and 
tocols. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, vanillin, p-coumaric 
acid, and ferulic acid were identified and quantified by HPLC. Three 
avenanthramides and an unidentified ferulate derivative were also detected. 
Total phenolic content was significantly correlated with antioxidant activity, 
and regression equations that predicted antioxidant activity from phenolic and 
tocol concentrations were calculated. Antioxidant activity, evaluated by 
beta-carotene bleaching, was correlated with measures of oxygen radical 
absorbance capacity and low-density lipoprotein oxidation. These data indicate a 
potential for oat products, especially those enriched in outer layers of the 
groat, to contribute to dietary intakes of antioxidant phytonutrients.

The taste quality varies greatly among black teas processed at different stages 
of spring; however, the key differential metabolites and the mechanisms 
underlying their differences are unclear. In this study, we aimed to compare the 
taste and metabolite contents of black tea produced in early and late spring, 
and investigate their influencing mechanisms. To this end, we evaluated the 
sensory and taste components of black teas produced during early and late 
spring, as well as the metabolites and the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and 
peroxidase (POD) activities of fresh tea leaves harvested at different times in 
this study. Metabolomic analysis revealed that catechins, theanine, and flavonol 
glycosides were the potential key components responsible for taste variation in 
the black teas. The final contents of theanine and flavonol glycosides in the 
black teas were influenced by the initial levels of these compounds in fresh 
leaves, whereas the contents of catechins were affected by both their initial 
levels and the activities of PPO and POD in fresh leaves. Furthermore, ANS and 
F3GlcT were found to be crucial genes influencing the differential accumulation 
of flavonoids in fresh tea leaves during spring. Our results provide novel 
insights into the mechanisms underlying taste variations between black teas 
produced in early and late spring.

Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata (Fuzi) is a commonly used traditional Chinese 
medicine in clinic for its potency in restoring yang and rescuing from collapse. 
Aconiti alkaloids, mainly including monoester-diterpenoidaconitines (MDAs) and 
diester-diterpenoidaconitines (DDAs), are considered to act as both bioactive 
and toxic constituents. In the present study, a feasible, economical, and 
accurate HPLC method for simultaneous determination of six alkaloid markers 
using the Single Standard for Determination of Multi-Components (SSDMC) method 
was developed and fully validated. Benzoylmesaconine was used as the unique 
reference standard. This method was proven as accurate (recovery varying between 
97.5%-101.8%, RSD < 3%), precise (RSD 0.63%-2.05%), and linear (R > 0.999 9) 
over the concentration ranges, and subsequently applied to quantitative 
evaluation of 62 batches of samples, among which 45 batches were from good 
manufacturing practice (GMP) facilities and 17 batches from the drug market. The 
contents were then analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) and 
homogeneity test. The present study provided valuable information for improving 
the quality standard of Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata. The developed method 
also has the potential in analysis of other Aconitum species, such as Aconitum 
carmichaelii (prepared parent root) and Aconitum kusnezoffii (prepared root).

The polyphenolic composition of 62 wild and weedy Mexican bean collections from 
diverse origins, grouped by their seed coat color, was assessed. According to 
spectrophotometric analysis, the range of total phenols, condensed tannins, and 
total anthocyanins presented wide differences. Furthermore, the phenolic acid, 
flavonoid, and anthocyanin profiles were analyzed using HPLC. Ferulic was the 
main phenolic acid. Kaempferol and quercetin were the main flavonoids, and the 
isoflavones daidzein and coumestrol were found in only low levels in few 
collections. Delphinidin was the main anthocyanidin found, followed by 
petunidin, cyanidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, and peonidin. The wide variation 
observed in polyphenolic contents was more related to their genotype than to the 
color factor. These results show that some wild and weedy beans are good sources 
of phenolic compounds for use in breeding programs focused on nutrition and 
health.

Sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) is a fruit appreciated by consumers for its 
well-known physical and sensory characteristics and its health benefits. Being 
an extremely perishable fruit, it is important to know the unique attributes of 
the cultivars to develop cultivation or postharvest strategies that can enhance 
their quality. This study aimed to understand the influence of physicochemical 
characteristics of two sweet cherry cultivars, Burlat and Van, on the food 
quality perception. Several parameters (weight, dimensions, soluble solids 
content (SSC), pH, titratable acidity (TA), colour, and texture) were measured 
and correlated with sensory data. Results showed that cv. Van presented heavier 
and firmer fruits with high sugar content. In turn, cv. Burlat showed higher pH, 
lower TA, and presented redder and brightest fruits. The principal component 
analysis revealed an evident separation between cultivars. Van cherries stood 
out for their sensory parameters and were classified as more acidic, bitter, and 
astringent, and presented a firmer texture. Contrarily, Burlat cherries were 
distinguished as being more flavourful, succulent, sweeter, and more uniform in 
terms of visual and colour parameters. The results of the sensory analysis 
suggested that perceived quality does not always depend on and/or recognize the 
quality parameters inherent to the physicochemical characteristics of each 
cultivar.

Corni Fructus (CF), used for thousands of years in Asia as food and medicine, 
has different therapeutic effects before and after processing. In the past work, 
the quality assessment of Corni Fructus focused on the limited chemical 
compounds and rarely correlated external properties, such as color. The 
traditional sensory assessment relies partly on human eyes, which is quick but 
lacks objectivity. On a Shimadzu LC-20AD liquid chromatograph system equipped 
with a diode-array detector (DAD), we determined six major compounds (gallic 
acid, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde, morroniside, loganin, sweroside, and 
cornuside I). The extract was analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid 
chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry 
(UHPLC-QTOF-MS) after the solid-phase extraction (SPE) step. Totally 58 
compounds in raw and processed Corni Fructus were identified in negative and 
positive ion modes according to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragments. 
Iridoids, carboxylic acids, tannins, flavonoids, triterpenes, fatty acids, 
saccharides, phospholipids, polysaccharide, amino acid, amide, furan, catechol, 
aldehyde, fatty alcohol and vitamin were included. A multivariate statistical 
analysis based on UHPLC-QTOF-MS filtered 17 differential compounds between raw 
and processed products. The CM-5 colorimeter was applied for digitizing surface 
and powder color. The contents of gallic acid, morroniside, loganin, cornuside 
I, and sweroside significantly correlated with color parameters in raw Corni 
Fructus, particularly adp* and bdp* , but not in processed products, according 
to Spearman correlation analysis. MS peak area of four compounds in raw products 
correlated significantly with color parameters Ldp* , adp* , bdp* , Lpd* , 
apd* , bpd* , respectively, while three compounds in processed products with 
Lpd* , apd* , bpd* . It revealed the relationship between compounds and color of 
Corni Fructus and the crucial compounds to color. In this study, we successfully 
developed a method for comprehensive quality evaluation of Corni Fructus that 
combines HPLC, UHPLC-QTOF-MS, and color determination.

It is an important way for healthy Selenium (Se) supplement to transform 
exogenous Se into organic Se through crops. In the present study, Vigna 
unguiculata was selected as a test material and sprayed with biological nano 
selenium (SeNPs) and Na2SeO3, and its nutrient composition, antioxidant 
capacity, total Se and organic Se content were determined, respectively. 
Further, the response of ABC transporter family members in cowpea to different 
exogenous Se treatments was analyzed by transcriptome sequencing combined with 
different Se forms. The results show that the soluble protein content of cowpea 
increased after twice Se treatment. SeNPs treatment increased the content of 
cellulose in cowpea pods. Na2SeO3 treatment increased the content of vitamin C 
(Vc) in cowpea pods. Se treatments could significantly increase the activities 
of Peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and catalase (CAT) in cowpea pods 
and effectively maintain the activity of Superoxide dismutase (SOD). SeNPs can 
reduce the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in pods. After Se treatment, cowpea 
pods showed a dose-effect relationship on the absorption and accumulation of 
total Se, and Na2SeO3 treatment had a better effect on the increase of total Se 
content in cowpea pods. After treatment with SeNPs and Na2SeO3, the Se species 
detected in cowpea pods was mainly SeMet, followed by MeSeCys. Inorganic Se can 
only be detected in the high concentration treatment group. Analysis of 
transcriptome data of cowpea treated with Se showed that ABC transporters could 
play an active role in response to Se stress and Se absorption, among which 
ABCB, ABCC and ABCG subfamilies played a major role in Se absorption and 
transportation in cowpea. Further analysis by weighted gene co-expression 
network analysis (WGCNA) showed that the content of organic Se in cowpea treated 
with high concentration of SeNPs was significantly and positively correlated 
with the expression level of three transporters ABCC11, ABCC13 and ABCC10, which 
means that the ABCC subfamily may be more involved in the transmembrane 
transport of organic Se in cells.

Isoflavone phytoestrogens found in soybeans are the most widely studied 
phytochemicals in human diets and soy infant formulas. The health benefits of 
the isoflavones daidzein and genistein have been reported, and concerns about 
potential adverse effects have also been raised. However, the results of direct 
analysis of isoflavones and their metabolites in biological fluids after 
consumption of soy-containing diets are scarce. This study describes an LC/MS/MS 
method for the analysis of isoflavones and their metabolites in the urine of 
female rats fed diets made with soy protein isolate. Five isoflavones (daidzein, 
genistein, glycitein, dihydrodaidzein, and O-desmethylangolensin) were 
identified by comparison with authentic standards. Seventeen conjugates of 
isoflavones were characterized in the urine, the most unusual being genistein 
5-glucuronide and four glucuronide conjugates of reductive metabolites of 
daidzein. The application of LC/MS/MS to analyze isoflavone metabolites is 
simple and sensitive, and appears to be an excellent method for determining the 
bioavailability and metabolism of food phytochemistry.

Naringin is a flavonoid that exists in many plants and traditional Chinese 
medicines. In this study, a highly sensitive and specific electrospray 
ionization (ESI) liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) 
method was developed for quantification of naringin and its two metabolites, 
naringenin and naringenin glucuronide. Naringin and naringenin were extracted 
from rat plasma with ethyl acetate, using hesperidin as an internal standard. 
Components in the extract were separated on a 100 mm x 2.0 mm Betabasic 5 microm 
C18 ODS column by isocratic elution with 70% methanol. The components were 
analyzed in the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode in the precursor/product 
ion pair of m/z 581.3/273.4 for naringin, m/z 273.4/153.1 for naringenin and m/z 
611.5/303.4 for hesperidin, respectively. Linear calibration curves were 
obtained in the range of 5-1000 ng/ml, using 0.1 ml rat plasma. The within-day 
coefficients of variation (CVs) were 3.1, 1.8 and 2.2% for naringin, 3.0, 3.3, 
3.1% for naringenin at 5, 50 and 500 ng/ml (n=5). The between-day CVs were 3.4, 
1.7 and 4.9% for naringin and 4.0, 3.0, 4.6% for naringenin (n=5) at 5, 50 and 
500 ng/ml respectively. A formulation based on PEG400 was used and orally 
administered to Sprague-Dawley male rats. Plasma drug concentrations were 
measured by this method and the pharmacokinetics was analyzed by WinNonlin 
computer software. Plasma concentration-time profiles of naringin were found to 
increase quickly and decline rapidly within 2 h and could not be detected after 
24 h. Naringenin and naringenin glucuronide occurred slower and the T(max) were 
about 9 and 7.5 h later, respectively.

The market for decaffeinated coffees has been increasingly expanding over the 
years. Caffeine extraction may result in losses of other compounds such as 
chlorogenic acids (CGA) and, consequently, their 1,5-gamma-quinolactones (CGL) 
in roasted coffee. These phenolic compounds are important for flavor formation 
as well as the health effects of coffee; therefore, losses due to decaffeination 
need to be investigated. The present study evaluates the impact of 
decaffeination processing on CGA and CGL levels of green and roasted arabica 
coffees. Decaffeination produced a 16% average increase in the levels of total 
CGA in green coffee (dry matter), along with a 237% increase in CGL direct 
precursors. Different degrees of roasting showed average increments of 5.5-18% 
in CGL levels of decaffeinated coffee, compared to regular, a change more 
consistent with observed levels of total CGA than with those of CGL direct 
precursors in green samples. On the other hand, CGA levels in roasted coffee 
were 3-9% lower in decaffeinated coffee compared to regular coffee. Although 
differences in CGA and CGL contents of regular and decaffeinated roasted coffees 
appear to be relatively small, they may be enough to affect flavor 
characteristics as well as the biopharmacological properties of the final 
beverage, suggesting the need for further study.

Unbalanced diets generate oxidative stress commonly associated with the 
development of diabetes, atherosclerosis, obesity and cancer. Dietary flavonoids 
have antioxidant properties and may limit this stress and reduce the risk of 
these diseases. We used a metabolomic approach to study the influence of 
catechin, a common flavonoid naturally occurring in various fruits, wine or 
chocolate, on the metabolic changes induced by hyperlipidemic diets. Male Wistar 
rats ( n = 8/group) were fed during 6 weeks normolipidemic (5% w/w) or 
hyperlipidemic (15 and 25%) diets with or without catechin supplementation (0.2% 
w/w). Urines were collected at days 17 and 38 and analyzed by reverse-phase 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF). Hyperlipidic diets led to a 
significant increase of oxidative stress in liver and aorta, upon which catechin 
had no effect. Multivariate analyses (PCA and PLS-DA) of the urine fingerprints 
allowed discrimination of the different diets. Variables were then classified 
according to their dependence on lipid and catechin intake (ANOVA). Nine 
variables were identified as catechin metabolites of tissular or microbial 
origin. Around 1000 variables were significantly affected by the lipid content 
of the diet, and 76 were fully reversed by catechin supplementation. Four 
variables showing an increase in urinary excretion in rats fed the high-fat 
diets were identified as deoxycytidine, nicotinic acid, dihydroxyquinoline and 
pipecolinic acid. After catechin supplementation, the excretion of nicotinic 
acid was fully restored to the level found in the rats fed the low-fat diet. The 
physiological significance of these metabolic changes is discussed.

RATIONALE: 4,4-Diaminodiphenylmethane (MDA) is an aromatic amine classified as a 
Group 2B carcinogen. MDA is widely used as a key ingredient in industrial and 
consumer products such as epoxy resins, polyurethanes, and dyes. Given its 
widespread use and potential for occupational and environmental exposure, 
understanding its hepatic metabolism is crucial in elucidating the toxicological 
profiles of MDA in humans. However, a limited number of metabolites have been 
reported in the literature. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive 
metabolite profiling study to identify and characterize all possible in vitro 
metabolites of MDA.
METHODOLOGY: In vitro hepatic metabolism studies were conducted using pooled 
human liver S9 fractions to stimulate the metabolism of MDA in humans. An 
untargeted metabolite profiling approach was employed using an LC-Orbitrap-HRMS. 
Data processing and identification of metabolites were performed using the 
Compound Discoverer software. A targeted LC-MS/MS method was employed to find 
the relative abundances of metabolites at various incubation times. In silico 
toxicity prediction of MDA-derived metabolites was conducted using the ProTox 
3.0 online tool.
RESULTS: A total of twelve MDA-derived metabolites were successfully identified, 
reflecting both Phase I (hydroxylation, desaturation, oxidative deamination) and 
Phase II (acetylation, sulfation, glucoside conjugation) biotransformation 
pathways. Among these, N-acetylated and desaturation intermediate-related 
metabolites were the most abundant. Based on these findings, an in silico 
toxicological report for the metabolites was proposed.
CONCLUSIONS: The Orbitrap LC-HRMS platform enabled comprehensive identification 
and characterization of in vitro hepatic metabolic profiles of MDA. The 
predicted toxicological profiles and the discovery of additional metabolite 
formation beyond the known acetylation pathway provided new insights that can 
enhance toxicological risk assessment of MDA.

BACKGROUND: Inadequate dietary fiber (DF) intake is associated with several 
human diseases. Bread is commonly consumed, and its DF content can be increased 
by incorporating defatted rice bran (DRB).
OBJECTIVE: This first human study on DRB-fortified bread primarily aims to 
assess the effect of DRB-fortified bread on the relative abundance of a 
composite of key microbial genera and species in fecal samples. Secondary 
outcomes include clinical (cardiovascular risk profile), patient-reported (daily 
bread consumption and bowel movement, gut comfort, general well-being, and total 
DF intake), biological (fecal microbiota gene abundances, and fecal and plasma 
metabolites), and physiome (whole-gut and regional transit time and gas 
fermentation profiles) outcomes in healthy adults with low DF intake.
METHODS: This is a 2-armed, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover 
randomized controlled trial. The study duration is 14 weeks: 2 weeks of lead-in, 
4 weeks of intervention per phase, 2 weeks of washout, and 2 weeks of follow-up. 
Overall, 60 healthy adults with low DF intake (<18 g [female individuals] or <22 
g [male individuals] per day) were recruited in Christchurch, New Zealand, 
between June and December 2022. Randomly assigned participants consumed 3 
(female individuals) or 4 (male individuals) slices of DRB-fortified bread per 
day and then placebo bread, and vice versa. The DRB-fortified bread provided 8 g 
(female individuals) or 10.6 g (male individuals) of total DF, whereas the 
placebo (a matched commercial white toast bread) provided 2.7 g (female 
individuals) or 3.6 g (male individuals) of total DF. Before and after each 
intervention phase, participants provided fecal and blood samples to assess 
biological responses; completed a 3-day food diary to assess usual intakes and 
web-based questionnaires to assess gut comfort, general and mental well-being, 
daily bread intake, and bowel movement via an app; underwent anthropometry and 
blood pressure measurements; and drank blue food dye to assess whole-gut transit 
time. Additionally, 25% (15/60) of the participants ingested Atmo gas-sensing 
capsules to assess colonic gas fermentation profile and whole-gut and regional 
transit time. Mean differences from baseline will be compared between the DRB 
and placebo groups, as well as within groups (after the intervention vs 
baseline). For metabolome analyses, comparisons will be made within and between 
groups using postintervention values.
RESULTS: Preliminary analysis included 56 participants (n=33, 59% female; n=23, 
41% male). Due to the large dataset, data analysis was planned to be fully 
completed by the last quarter of 2024, with full results expected to be 
published in peer-reviewed journals by the end of 2024.
CONCLUSIONS: This first human study offers insights into the prospect of 
consuming DRB-fortified bread to effectively modulate health-promoting gut 
microbes, their metabolism, and DF intake in healthy adults with low DF intake.

Anthocyanins are phenolic compounds widely distributed in fruits and vegetables. 
Their consumption has been shown to prevent some chronic diseases. Anthocyanin 
metabolism, however, is still not fully understood. The aim of this work was to 
evaluate the bioavailability of anthocyanins in humans consuming a meal 
containing strawberries and to identify possible metabolites in urine. Six 
healthy volunteers (three women and three men) consumed a meal containing 200 g 
strawberries (providing 179 micro mol pelargonidin-3-glucoside). Urine samples 
were collected before and after the meal and rapidly treated by solid-phase 
extraction. Identification and quantification of anthocyanin metabolites were 
carried out by HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC with UV-visible detection, respectively. 
In addition to pelargonidin-3-glucoside, five anthocyanin metabolites were 
identified in urine: three monoglucuronides of pelargonidin, one sulfoconjugate 
of pelargonidin and pelargonidin itself. Total urinary excretion of strawberry 
anthocyanin metabolites corresponded to 1.80 +/- 0.29% (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) of 
pelargonidin-3-glucoside ingested. More than 80% of this excretion was related 
to a monoglucuronide. Four hours after the meal, more than two-thirds of 
anthocyanin metabolites had been excreted, although urinary excretion of the 
metabolites continued until the end of the 24-h experiment. This study 
demonstrated that anthocyanins were glucuro- and sulfo-conjugated in humans and 
that the main metabolite of strawberry anthocyanins in human urine was a 
monoglucuronide of pelargonidin.

The consumption of anthocyanins has been shown to prevent certain chronic 
diseases. However, anthocyanin metabolism has not yet been fully elucidated. The 
aim of this study was to evaluate anthocyanin urinary excretion in humans 
receiving a meal containing blackberries and to identify possible metabolites in 
urine. Five healthy volunteers were fed 200 g of blackberries (960 mumol of 
anthocyanins). Urine samples were collected and rapidly treated by solid-phase 
extraction. Anthocyanin metabolites were identified and quantified by 
HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC with UV-vis detection, respectively. In addition to 
native cyanidin 3-glucoside, several other anthocyanin metabolites were 
identified in the urine: methylated glycosides, glucuronides of anthocyanidins 
and anthocyanins, a sulfoconjugate of cyanidin, and anthocyanidins. Total 
urinary excretion of blackberry anthocyanin metabolites was 0.160 +/- 0.020% (n 
= 5) of the amount of anthocyanins ingested. Monoglucuronides of anthocyanidins 
represented >60% of this excretion. Urinary excretion of anthocyanins was 
maximal between 2 and 4 h after the meal, but continued during the 24 h of the 
experiment. This study highlighted the influence of aglycon structure on 
anthocyanin urinary excretion. It demonstrated that anthocyanins are not only 
methylated but also glucuroconjugated and sulfoconjugated in humans and that the 
main metabolites of blackberry anthocyanins in human urine were anthocyanidin 
monoglucuronides.

Anthocyanins are natural pigments that could be involved in various health 
effects. Red oranges are an important dietary source of anthocyanins, including 
cyanidin 3-glucoside (Cy 3-glc) and an acylated derivative, cyanidin 
3-(6''-malonyl)-glucoside (Cy 3-malglc). The aim of this study was to evaluate 
the absorption and metabolism of red orange anthocyanins in rats fed an 
anthocyanin-enriched diet for 12 d (approximately 2.8 micromol anthocyanins/d). 
Furthermore, the absorption of these anthocyanins was studied in both the 
stomach and intestine using in situ models in rats. Anthocyanin metabolites were 
identified and quantified by HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem MS and 
HPLC-diode array detection, respectively. The red orange anthocyanins, Cy 3-glc 
and Cy 3-malglc, as well as their respective methylated derivatives, were 
recovered in urine after red orange juice intake. The 24 h urinary excretion of 
total anthocyanins was low (0.081 (SEM 0.009) % of the ingested amount). 
However, a high proportion (about 20 %) of red orange anthocyanins was absorbed 
from the stomach. More Cy 3-malglc than Cy 3-glc was absorbed in the intestine. 
This study thus indicated that red orange juice anthocyanins were rapidly 
absorbed from both stomach and small intestine, and then excreted in the urine 
as intact and methylated forms. Moreover, the absorption and metabolism of 
acylated anthocyanins and non-acylated anthocyanins were similar.

Anthocyanins are natural dietary pigments that could be involved in various 
health effects. However their mechanisms of absorption are still not fully 
understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of glucose on 
anthocyanin absorption in rats. We first studied anthocyanin bioavailability in 
rats that received by gastric intubation approximately 53 micromol cyanidin 
3-glucoside (Cy 3-glc) equivalents from a red orange extract with or without 
2.51 mmol glucose. Neither 24-h urinary anthocyanin excretion nor plasma 
anthocyanin concentration was significantly affected by simultaneous ingestion 
of glucose. The influence of glucose (12, 42 or 72 mM) on intestinal absorption 
of Cy 3-glc (pure or from a red orange extract; approximately 12.3 microM) was 
further studied using an in situ intestinal perfusion model. Absorption of pure 
Cy 3-glc from the intestinal lumen was not significantly affected by the amount 
of glucose. However, intestinal absorption of Cy 3-glc from the red orange 
extract (6.49 +/- 1.44%, n = 6) was significantly less than that of pure Cy 
3-glc (17.5 +/- 1.3%, n = 7) (p < 0.01) suggesting that the red orange extract 
contained other components that were able to interfere with Cy 3-glc intestinal 
absorption. This study has thus shown that glucose did not interfere with 
anthocyanin glucoside absorption.

Anthocyanins are natural dietary pigments that could be involved in various 
health effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of 
anthocyanins to various organs (bladder, prostate, testes, heart and adipose 
tissue) in rats fed with a blackberry anthocyanin-enriched diet for 12 days. 
Identification and quantification of anthocyanins were carried out by HPLC-DAD. 
The urinary excretion of total anthocyanins (native anthocyanins and their 
metabolites) was low (0.20 +/- 0.03%, n = 8). Proportions of anthocyanin 
derivatives (methylated anthocyanins and glucurono-conjugated derivatives) 
differed according to the organ considered. The bladder contained the highest 
levels of anthocyanins followed by the prostate. Prostate, testes and heart 
contained native cyanidin 3-glucoside and a small proportion of cyanidin 
monoglucuronide. Cyanidin 3-glucoside and methylated derivatives were present in 
adipose tissue. Thus, anthocyanin feeding in rats resulted in a wide 
distribution of anthocyanin derivatives to several organs. Identification of 
target tissues of anthocyanins may then help to understand the mechanisms of 
action of anthocyanins in vivo.

Olive leaves are a waste of the olive oil processing industry and represent a 
good source of phenolic compounds. The aim of this work was to assess the 
influence of olive leaf extract (OLE) on lipid oxidation of baked snacks, like 
breadsticks, made with wheat flour, extra virgin olive oil (EVO), white wine, 
and salt. Two EVOs having different peroxide value and antioxidant profile 
(total phenol content, tocopherols, carotenoids, and antioxidant activity) were 
considered. The snacks were subjected to oven test or stored in the usual 
conditions of retailer shelves. The obtained data highlighted that EVO plays a 
key role both for the quality and for the shelf-life of baked snacks and the use 
of OLE is recommended especially when baked snacks are produced with low quality 
EVO which therefore does not have a good content of natural antioxidants. The 
OLE addition significantly reduced the forced oxidative degradation during oven 
test, as evidenced by a decrease of 27% in oxidation-related volatile compounds 
and of 42% in triacylglycerol oligopolymers compared to control snacks (CTR) 
without OLE. Moreover, OLE effectively acted also in normal storage conditions, 
improving sensory data, induction times, antioxidant activity, and volatile 
compounds compared to CTR (i.e. hexanal 165.49 vs 38.31 μg g-1 in OLE-added). 
The amount of oxidation-related volatile compounds showed an opposite trend with 
the quality level of oil used.

A field experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of fertilization 
level on the phenolic composition of tronchuda cabbage ( Brassica oleracea L. 
var. costata DC) external and internal leaves. Eight different plots were 
constituted: a control without fertilization, one with organic matter, and six 
experiments with conventional fertilizers (nitrogen, boron, and sulfur, two 
levels each). The phenolic compounds were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC-DAD. 
External and internal leaves revealed distinct qualitative composition. In the 
internal leaves were found 15 phenolics (5 kaempferol and 10 cinnamic acid 
derivatives), whereas the external leaves presented 3- p-coumaroylquinic acid 
and 13 kaempferol derivatives. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to 
assess the relationships between phenolic compounds, agronomical practices, and 
harvesting time. Samples obtained with conventional practices were quite 
effectively separated from organic samples, for both types of leaves. In 
general, samples developed without any fertilization presented the highest 
phenolics amounts: external and internal leaves contained 1.4- and 4.6-fold more 
phenolic compounds than the ones that received conventional fertilizer, 
respectively, and the internal leaves presented 2.4 times more phenolics than 
the ones grown with organic amendment. Additionally, samples from organic 
production exhibited higher total phenolics content than those from conventional 
practices, collected at the same time. Samples harvested first were revealed to 
be distinct from the ones collected later. The results show that it is possible 
to grow tronchuda cabbage without excess fertilizers, with highest amounts of 
phenolics and reduced environment contamination.

The present study explored the bioavailability and brain deposition of a grape 
seed polyphenolic extract (GSPE) previously found to attenuate cognitive 
deterioration in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma 
pharmacokinetic response of major GSPE phenolic components was measured 
following intragastric gavage of 50, 100, and 150 mg GSPE per kg body weight. 
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis identified gallic acid 
(GA), catechin (C), and epicatechin (EC) in plasma of rats gavaged acutely with 
GSPE. Additionally, 4-methylgallic acid (4-OMeGA), 3'-methylcatechin (3'-OMeC), 
and 3'-methylepicatechin (3'-OMeEC) were identified as circulating metabolites 
of GSPE phenolic constituents. Cmax for individual GSPE constituents and their 
metabolites increased in a dose-dependent fashion (with increasing GSPE oral 
dose). Repeated daily exposure to GSPE was found to significantly increase 
bioavailability (defined as plasma AUC0-8h) of GA, C, and EC by 198, 253, and 
282% relative to animals receiving only a single acute GSPE dose. EC and C were 
not detectable in brain tissues of rats receiving a single GSPE dose but reached 
levels of 290.7 +/-45.9 and 576.7 +/- 227.7 pg/g in brain tissues from rats 
administered GSPE for 10 days. This study suggests that brain deposition of GA, 
C, and EC is affected by repeated dosing of GSPE.

The simultaneous determination of 19 phenolic compounds was performed directly 
in wort and beer by a combination of reverse-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography coupled with coulometric array detection. Chromatographic 
separation was achieved with an appropriate gradient of flow and a binary 
solvent based on phosphate buffer, methanol, and acetonitrile in a 45-min run. 
Eight serial coulometric detectors were used for on-line generation of 
voltammetric data to resolve coeluting compounds. The method was reliable and 
sensitive, the regression coefficient of standard calibration curves is 0.972 < 
or = r < or = 1.000, and the standard deviation value ranges from 0.010 to 0.129 
mg/L for wort and from 0.002 to 0.332 mg/L for beer. The mean concentrations of 
phenolic acids were 22.1 and 33.8 mg/L, respectively, in worts and beers 
produced in Italy. These amounts represent 5 and 10% of the non-tannic, 
non-flavonoid phenols in wort and beer, respectively.

In vitro studies show that some individual minor polar phenolic compounds (MPC) 
present in virgin olive oil prevent oxidation of human low-density lipoproteins 
(LDL), but few data are available on the antioxidant effect of whole oil 
extract. Thus, whole virgin olive extracts were studied to determine whether 
they maintain the antioxidant activity and whether this last is linked to MPC 
composition of a single virgin oil. Using HPLC-DAD the MPC content in Taggiasca 
and Seggianese virgin olive oils was measured. Taggiasca oil was less rich in 
total MPC (208.5 mg/L) than Seggianese oil (441.9 mg/L). In addition, the major 
compounds of Taggiasca oil were lignan derivatives, whereas the major compounds 
in Seggianese oils were secoiridoid derivatives. Moreover, Taggiasca oil was 
practically free of 5-hydroxytyrosol and 5-hydroxytyrosol derivatives, 
deacetoxy-oleuropein aglycone and oleuropein aglycone. The antioxidant activity 
of the oils on human LDL was evaluated by measuring malondialdehyde and 
conjugate diene generation induced by copper ions. In both tests, the oil 
extracts dose-dependently reduced malondialdehyde and conjugate diene 
generation. Moreover, antioxidant potency correlated with total MPC; thus, 
Seggianese extract was more active. The two oils differed quantitatively and 
qualitatively, and these differences influenced their biological activities; 
thus clinical trials focused on studying the effects of olive oils should 
specify the oils used.

A fast, precise and selective diode array HPLC method is presented for the 
extraction and analysis of soy isoflavonoids from foods and from human urine, 
plasma, and breast milk in support of mechanistic and epidemiologic studies 
assessing the potential cancer protective role of soya or isoflavones. Solid 
phase or solvent extraction was chosen for isolation, and enzymatic or acid 
hydrolysis procedures were used for aglycone production depending on the matrix 
to be analyzed. C-18 reversed-phase HPLC was applied to selectively separate and 
quantitate daidzein (1), glycitein (3), and genistein (4), including their 
malonyl (a) and acetyl (b) esters, and their mammalian metabolites equol (6) and 
O-desmethylangolensin (7), as well as formononetin (2), biochanin-A (5), and 
coumestrol (8) using a gradient elution system. UV absorbance scans and 
authentic standards were applied for identification purposes, additional to 
fluorometric monitoring, electrochemical detection, and GC/ MS analysis after 
trimethyl silylation. Detection limits of 20-microl injections were found to be 
1.09, 0.53, 3.28, and 1.00 pmoles for daidzein, genistein, equol, and 
O-desmethylangolensin (DMA), respectively, by monitoring at the individual 
compound's absorption maximum. The proposed method was applied to monitor 
isoflavone levels in soy foods and in human plasma, urine and breast milk after 
challenge with roasted soybeans. Implications of the presented results on the 
potential activity of isoflavones to prevent cancer by exposing newborn infants 
to these agents are discussed.

Concentrations and glucosidic conjugation patterns of isoflavones were 
determined in soy foods consumed by multiethnic populations in Singapore and 
Hawaii. Six raw and 11 cooked food groups traditionally consumed in Singapore 
and 8 food groups consumed in Hawaii were analyzed by reversed-phase 
high-pressure liquid chromatography with diode array detection. Mean total 
isoflavone levels varied between 35 and 7500 ppm, with the lowest values found 
in soy milk and burgers and the highest levels observed in soybean and its seeds 
and in supplements. Total isoflavone levels and conjugation patterns varied as a 
function of soybean variety, storage conditions, and food processing. A large 
contribution to the differences in total isoflavone content between food groups 
was due to the water content in foods and to leaching of polar analytes into the 
water phase during boiling. Soy protein drinks and traditional soy foods were 
found to possess very similar isoflavone amounts considering usual serving 
sizes.

Effects of Citrus Fruit Juices and Their Bioactive Components on Inflammation 
and Immunity: A Narrative Review.

The immune system provides defence to the host against pathogenic organisms. A 
weak immune system increases susceptibility to infections and allows infections 
to become more severe. One component of the immune response is inflammation. 
Where inflammation is excessive or uncontrolled it can damage host tissues and 
cause pathology. Limitation of oxidative stress is one means of controlling 
inflammation. Citrus fruit juices are a particularly good source of vitamin C 
and folate, which both have roles in sustaining the integrity of immunological 
barriers and in supporting the function of many types of immune cell including 
phagocytes, natural killer cells, T-cells and B-cells. Vitamin C is an 
antioxidant and reduces aspects of the inflammatory response. Important 
bioactive polyphenols in citrus fruit juices include hesperidin, narirutin and 
naringin. Hesperidin is a glycoside of hesperetin while narirutin and naringin 
are glycosides of naringenin. Hesperidin, hesperetin, naringenin, naringin and 
narirutin have all been found to have anti-inflammatory effects in model 
systems, and human trials of hesperidin report reductions in inflammatory 
markers. In humans, orange juice was shown to limit the post-prandial 
inflammation induced by a high fat-high carbohydrate meal. Consuming orange 
juice daily for a period of weeks has been reported to reduce markers of 
inflammation, including C-reactive protein, as confirmed through a recent 
meta-analysis. A newly emerging topic is whether polyphenols from orange juice 
have direct anti-viral effects. In summary, micronutrients and other bioactives 
present in citrus fruit juices have established roles in controlling oxidative 
stress and inflammation and in supporting innate and acquired immune responses. 
Trials in humans demonstrate that orange juice reduces inflammation; its effects 
on innate and acquired immunity require further exploration in well-designed 
trials in appropriate population sub-groups such as older people.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between 
dietary intake of phytoestrogens estimated by a food frequency questionnaire 
(FFQ) with urinary metabolites.
METHODS: Participants were 26 premenopausal, Caucasian women aged 25 to 42 
years. Dietary intake of isoflavones (genistein and daidzein) and lignans 
(secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol) were estimated by a 53-item 
interviewer-administered FFQ on two occasions, reflecting 'habitual' (previous 2 
months) and 'recent' (previous 2 days) dietary intake. Isoflavone (genistein, 
daidzein) and lignan (enterolactone, enterodiol and secoisolariciresinol) 
concentrations were measured in 24-hour urine samples by gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry. Correlations between FFQ (habitual and recent, separately) and 
urinary metabolite values were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients.
RESULTS: Mean habitual isoflavone and lignan intakes were 13.7 mg/day and 13.8 
mg/day, respectively. Mean urinary concentrations of isoflavones and lignans 
were 17.4 micromol/day and 20.6 micromol/day, respectively. Recent and habitual 
isoflavone intakes were correlated with urinary excretion of metabolites (r = 
0.64, p < 0.001 and r = 0.54, p = 0.004, respectively). Urinary excretion of 
lignans was also modestly correlated with recent and habitual lignan intakes (r 
= 0.46, p = 0.02 and r = 0.40, p = 0.05, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of this FFQ as a measure of dietary 
isoflavone and lignan intake in epidemiological studies.

The following 13 compounds were separated in a single analysis on an Inertsil ODS‐3v column with acetonitrile/potassium dihydrogen phosphate as the mobile phase: (−)‐epigallocatechin, (+)‐catechin, (−)‐epicatechin, (−)‐epigallocatechin‐3‐gallate, (−)‐gallocatechin‐3‐gallate, (−)‐epicatechin‐3‐gallate, (−)‐catechin‐3‐gallate, theaflavin, theaflavin‐3‐gallate, theaflavin‐3′‐gallate, theaflavin‐3, 3′‐digallate, caffeine, and theobromine. The data show that (1) extraction time from 3 min to 20 min did not significantly affect measured levels of tea compounds and (2) there was a wide variation in the composition of the tea compounds both within each tea category and among categories: black teas contained both theaflavins and catechins, green and white teas contained catechins and trace amounts of theaflavins, herbal teas contained very low amounts of all tea compounds. A statistical profile of the distribution of catechins, theaflavins, caffeine, and theobromine in the evaluated teas offers consumers a choice of teas containing high levels of health‐promoting compounds.

Thus, stabilization of polyunsaturated lipids by radical scavengers in the oils is important in order to avoid pathophysiological side effects of these essential components of our diet. To determine lipid oxidizability and its inhibition by endogenous antioxidants, we developed a simple fluorescence technique. It is based on solubilisation of the oils in aqueous buffer, labeling of the resulting emulsions with a suitable reporter fluorophore, which reflects lipid oxidation, and continuous monitoring of the decomposition process. Using this method, we found that oxidizability of the oils depended only to a limited extent on the content of lipophilic antioxidants. In addition, a smaller fraction of polar (phenolic) compounds showed comparable protective effects, especially in pumpkin seed oil, which is a non‐refined product therefore containing antioxidative components that are removed from most other edible oils during processing. Therefore, the contribution of these “minor” compounds has to be taken into account when potential biological effects of plant oils are evaluated.</jats:p>"

This research aimed to examine the effect of countercurrent ultrasound on 
extraction efficiency of cold brew coffee (CBC). The quality and flavor of CBC 
obtained by ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UE) were evaluated and compared with 
traditional extraction (TE). Meanwhile, the UE process was monitored in situ 
real-time using a near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer. The optimal UE parameters 
obtained by experiments were dual-frequency of 20/28 kHz, countercurrent 
ultrasonic treatment time of 50 min, ultrasonic power density of 320 W/L, and 
material-liquid ratio of 1:15. Under the optimal parameters, the total dissolved 
solids content (TDS) and extraction yield (EY) were 1.63 % and 20.52 %, 
respectively. This resulted in an 83.33 % improvement in efficiency matching the 
TDS and EY of a 5-h TE CBC. In comparison with the control, the contents of 
total polyphenols, total sugars, and total lipids after ultrasonic treatment 
increased by 13.79 %, 28.49 %, and 333.33 %, respectively, while the total acids 
content decreased by 27.81 %. HPLC and HS-SPME-GC/MS analysis showed similar 
non-volatile and volatile flavor components between UE and TE CBC. A 
quantitative partial least squares (PLS) prediction model was developed to 
monitor TDS and CGA levels during the UE CBC. This model demonstrated excellent 
calibration and prediction performance. (TDS: Rc = 0.9281; RMSECV = 0.0694; 
Rp = 0.9514; RMSEP = 0.0631. CGA: Rc = 0.9086; RMSECV = 0.0316; Rp = 0.9467; 
RMSEP = 0.0212). This study explored an efficient approach for the 
industrialization of CBC production and provided theoretical support for 
developing an intelligent control system for its process.

It has been suggested that the isoflavone, genistein,, may have some role as a 
chemopreventive agent against cancer in humans. Levels of genistein and its 
beta-glucoside conjugate, genistin, ingested in soybeans and related bean 
products by the Japanese were quantified by HPLC, to estimate daily intake of 
these compounds. Amounts of genistein and genistin in soybeans, soy nuts and soy 
powder were in the range of 4.6 to 18.2 and 200.6 to 968.1 micrograms/g food, 
respectively. The values for soy milk and tofu (bean curd) were 1.9 to 13.9 and 
94.8 to 137.7 micrograms/g food, respectively. Levels of isoflavones in 
fermented soybean products, miso (bean paste) and natto (fermented soybeans), 
were 38.5 to 229.1 micrograms/g food for genistein and 71.7 to 492.8 
micrograms/g food for genistin. Thus, the level of genistein in the fermented 
soybean products was higher than in soy beans and soybean products such as soy 
milk and tofu. From these observations, it is suggested that the beta-glycosyl 
bond of genistin is cleaved to produce genistein by microbes during fermentation 
to yield miso and natto. Soy sauce was also found to contain both isoflavones, 
but at levels lower than in miso and natto. On the basis of these data for 
average annual consumption of soybeans and related products, daily intake of 
genistein and genistin by the Japanese is calculated to be 1.5-4.1 and 6.3-8.3 
mg/person, respectively. These levels are much higher than those for Americans 
or Western Europeans, whose mortality rates for breast, colon and prostate 
cancers are greater than the Japanese.

Selecting optimal cultivars is essential for steaming, an emerging consumption 
method. This study evaluated 52 cultivars to examine the effects of steaming on 
physicochemical and sensory properties. Multivariate analysis identified WD, 
X13YZ, and JXMZ as the most suitable for industrial processing. Steaming 
significantly altered color parameters and texture, with hardness decreasing by 
91.86 %. Heat-sensitive nutrients declined markedly, including vitamin C 
(-29.18%), flavonoids (-30.04 %), and total phenols (-35.86 %). Sugar 
composition shifted, with substantial increases in fructose (+47.95 %) and 
glucose (+70.96 %), while sucrose changes were cultivar-specific (e.g., 
+244.37 % in NJDMZ). Antioxidant activity decreased overall, though cultivars 
such as FMG and MLC retained over 75 % hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity. 
Hierarchical clustering grouped cultivars into four classes, enabling targeted 
applications. These findings provide a basis for cultivar selection to balance 
nutritional value and sensory quality in steamed products.

This study revealed variations in the composition and in vitro antioxidant 
activity of proanthocyanidins, hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, flavonols, 
anthocyanins, and triterpene compounds in small cranberry fruit samples 
collected from a bog-type natural habitat in Lithuania during intensive ripening 
of the fruit. The highest total amounts of identified flavonols were determined 
at the beginning of fruit ripening on September 10 (1232.84 ± 31.73 µg/g). The 
highest total amounts of proanthocyanidins (1.85 ± 0.02 mg EE/g, p < 0.05), 
anthocyanins (4096.79 ± 5.93 µg/g, p < 0.05), and triterpene compounds (8248.46 
± 125.60 µg/g, p < 0.05) were detected in small cranberry fruit samples 
collected in the middle of the ripening period (September 16-18). The most 
potent in vitro antiradical and reducing activity was found in extracts of small 
cranberry fruit collected on September 10 (95.25 ± 1.15 µmol TE/g and 159.26 ± 
0.77 µmol/g, respectively). The strongest correlation was found between the 
total content of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives in the small cranberry fruit 
samples and the in vitro reducing activity of their extracts (0.858, p < 0.01). 
Among the individual compounds, the strongest correlation was observed between 
the amounts of isoquercitrin and guaijaverin in V. oxycoccos fruit samples and 
the in vitro reducing activity as assessed by the CUPRAC method (0.844, p < 0.01 
and 0.769, p < 0.05, respectively).

Seed coats and cotyledons from 25 Brazilian and 3 Peruvian bean cultivars were 
investigated in relation to their phenolic profiles and antioxidant capacity. 
Condensed tannins, anthocyanins, and flavonols such as kaempferol and quercetin 
glycosides were mostly found in seed coats. Cotyledons were rich in phenolic 
acids, such as ferulic, sinapic, chlorogenic, and other hydroxycinnamic acids. 
In general, the seed coat color pattern and the type of cultivar showed an 
important influence on the variability of phenolic profiles and levels, 
respectively. Total phenolics and antioxidant capacity assessed by the DPPH 
method were higher in seed coats than in cotyledons. The antioxidant capacity 
had a significant correlation with condensed tannins for all samples and with 
total anthocyanins in black and red seed coats, whereas in cotyledons, it was 
more related to the total phenolic content.

Analysis of phenolics and flavonoids in juice beverages using reversed-phase 
HPLC with coulometric array detection is described. Sixteen serial coulometric 
detectors were used for on-line resolution of co-eluting compounds and 
generation of voltammetric data. Within each class of compounds, oxidation 
potential corresponded to specific substitution patterns where: catechol < 
methoxycatechol < monohydroxyl < methoxyl. Twenty-seven standard compounds were 
resolved in a 45-min run. The limits of detection were in the low ng/ml range 
with a linear response range of at least three orders of magnitude. Intra-run 
retention time variation was < 1% (R.S.D.) and adjacent sensor response ratios 
varied by < 5% (R.S.D.). The utility of this technique in generating 
multivariate data for differentiation of juices and juice mixtures is shown.

The concentrations of trans-resveratrol, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and 
quercetin were evaluated by means of high-performance liquid 
chromatography-diode array detection in red wines obtained from Aglianico, 
Piedirosso, and Nerello Mascalese grapes. The trans-resveratrol and epicatechin 
concentrations did not differ significantly between experimental wines. The 
concentration of quercetin in Nerello Mascalese wines was more than twice that 
observed in Aglianico and Piedirosso wines. Nerello Mascalese wines also 
significantly differed from other wines in the (+)-catechin content, which was 
significantly higher than those found in the other two wines. During maceration, 
the maximum extraction of trans-resveratrol was reached after 12 days for 
Aglianico and Piedirosso, after which a decline was observed. On the contrary, 
in the case of Nerello Mascalese, the concentration of trans-resveratrol 
increased steadily throughout the whole maceration process. After 2 days of 
maceration, the maximum concentration of quercetin was observed in Aglianico 
must, whereas the maximum quercetin extraction was reached after 12 days for 
Piedirosso and 17 days for Nerello Mascalese. The maximum levels of (+)-catechin 
and (-)-epicatechin were generally observed after 12 days of maceration for all 
wines, although a decline of (-)-epicatechin occurred after maximum extraction 
in Aglianico and Piedirosso wines. Following marc pressing, a significant 
increase in the concentration of trans-resveratrol for Aglianico, (+)-catechin 
and (-)-epicatechin for Piedirosso, and (-)-epicatechin for Nerello Mascalese 
was observed.

In this study, we aimed to clarify the effects of phenolic compounds and 
extracts from different extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) varieties obtained from 
fruits of different ripening stages on osteoblast cells (MG-63) proliferation. 
Cell proliferation was increased by hydroxytyrosol, luteolin, apigenin, 
p-coumaric, caffeic, and ferulic acids by approximately 11-16%, as compared with 
controls that were treated with one vehicle alone, while (+)-pinoresinol, 
oleuropein, sinapic, vanillic acid and derivative (vanillin) did not affect cell 
proliferation. All phenolic extracts stimulated MG-63 cell growth, and they 
induced higher cell proliferation rates than individual compounds. The most 
effective EVOO phenolic extracts were those obtained from the Picual variety, as 
they significantly increased cell proliferation by 18-22%. Conversely, Arbequina 
phenolic extracts increased cell proliferation by 9-13%. A decline in osteoblast 
proliferation was observed in oils obtained from olive fruits collected at the 
end of the harvest period, as their total phenolic content decreases at this 
late stage. Further research on the signaling pathways of olive oil phenolic 
compounds involved in the processes and their metabolism should be carried out 
to develop new interventions and adjuvant therapies using EVOO for bone health 
(i.e.osteoporosis) in adulthood and the elderly.

The impact of the olive oil refining process on major antioxidant compound 
levels was evaluated by means of UHPLC analysis of lampante olive oils collected 
at different stages of the refining procedure (degumming, chemical and physical 
flash neutralization, bleaching, and deodorization). For this purpose, the 
evolution of the tocopherol fraction was investigated by means of the UHPLC-FL 
method, while the influence of the refining process on the total hydrolyzed 
phenolic content was assessed by measuring hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol levels 
after acid hydrolysis of the phenolic extracts. Refining was found to have a 
marked effect on total hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol contents, as they are 
completely removed in the early steps of the refining procedure. In contrast, 
the variation trends of tocopherols are not always clear-cut, and significant 
decreases in content from 7% to 16% were only revealed during refining in four 
out of nine samples. In addition, five of the nine refined oils showed final 
tocopherol concentrations higher than 200 mg/kg, the limit imposed by 
international standards regarding the content of such compounds in commercial 
olive oils. This study supports the need for a revision of the International 
Olive Oil Council (IOC) standard relative to the limit established for 
tocopherol addition to refined oils to avoid possible legal and economic trade 
issues.

Epidemiological studies suggest that a moderate consumption of anthocyanins may 
be associated with protection against coronary heart disease. The main dietary 
sources of anthocyanins include red-coloured fruits and red wine. Although 
dietary anthocyanins comprise a diverse mixture of molecules, little is known 
how structural diversity relates to their bioavailability and biological 
function. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the absorption and 
metabolism of the 3-monoglucosides of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin 
and malvidin in humans and to examine both the effect of consuming a red wine 
extract on plasma antioxidant status and on monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 
production in healthy human subjects. After a 12-h overnight fast, seven healthy 
volunteers received 12 g of an anthocyanin extract and provided 13 blood samples 
in the 24 h following the test meal. Furthermore, urine was collected during 
this 24-h period. Anthocyanins were detected in their intact form in both plasma 
and urine samples. Other anthocyanin metabolites could also be detected in 
plasma and urine and were identified as glucuronides of peonidin and malvidin. 
Anthocyanins and their metabolites appeared in plasma about 30 min after 
ingestion of the test meal and reached their maximum value around 1.6 h later 
for glucosides and 2.5 h for glucuronides. Total urinary excretion of red wine 
anthocyanins was 0.05+/-0.01% of the administered dose within 24 h. About 94% of 
the excreted anthocyanins was found in urine within 6 h. In spite of the low 
concentration of anthocyanins found in plasma, an increase in the antioxidant 
capacity and a decrease in MCP-1 circulating levels in plasma were observed.

form) were not detected. One of the most abundant dimers, 8-O-4-diFA, was 
purified from de-starched wheat bran after alkaline hydrolysis and preparative 
HPLC. The resultant product was identical to the chemically synthesised 
8-O-4-dimer by TLC and HPLC as confirmed by 1H-NMR and mass spectrometry. The 
absorption maxima and absorption coefficients for the synthetic compound in 
ethanol were: lambda max: 323 nm, lambda min: 258 nm, epsilon lambda max (M-1 
cm-1): 24,800 +/- 2100 and epsilon 280 (M-1 cm-1): 19,700 +/- 1100. The 
antioxidant properties of 8-O-4-diFA were assessed using: (a) inhibition of 
ascorbate/iron-induced peroxidation of phosphatidylcholine liposomes and; (b) 
scavenging of the radical cation of 2,2'-azinobis 
(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) relative to the water-soluble 
vitamin E analogue, Trolox C. The 8-O-4-diFA was a better antioxidant than 
ferulic acid in both lipid and aqueous phases. This is the first report of the 
antioxidant activity of a natural diferulate obtained from a plant.

The application of hydrostatic high pressure on an industrial line of nectarine 
(Prunus persica L.) purées was assessed in comparison with the traditional 
thermal treatment of pasteurization. Changes after thermal processing (85 °C, 5 
min) and after high-pressure processing (HPP: 450 or 600 MPa for 5 or 10 min) 
and during the refrigerated storage (60 d) of an industrially produced nectarine 
purée were evaluated. Conventional heat pasteurization as well as HPP showed 
similar microorganisms' inactivation and maintained the microbial stability of 
purées until the end of the refrigerated storage (60 d). In general, thermally 
treated purée and HP-treated purée at 600 MPa showed more intense color changes 
after processing than the other treatment. In addition, thermally treated purée 
showed more intense color changes during storage than HPP. The highest 
carotenoids extractability was found in those purées treated at the lowest 
high-pressure-treatment intensity and holding time (450 MPa/5 min), but at the 
end of the storage (day 60), no differences in individual or total carotenoid 
levels were found between the purées. HPP at 600 MPa/10 min showed the highest 
polyphenols content after the treatment and during the storage. At day 0, 
significantly higher values were found of total antioxidant activity in purée 
HP-treated at 450 MPa/10 min than in untreated purée; while at the end of the 
storage, HP-treated purée at 600 MPa/10 min had the highest antioxidant 
activity. Hydrostatic high-pressure application in the industrial line of 
nectarine purée presented some advantages compared to the thermal treatment; 
however, some of the changes found were lessen during the storage period. In 
addition, more studies need to be carried out for HP-treatment intensity 
optimization.

The tender buds of ""Heiyouchun"" (Toona sinensis), a traditional Chinese 
specialty variety, are highly favored as a unique woody vegetable. However, the 
mature leaves exhibit distinct bitterness and lack aromatic compounds, resulting 
in low resource utilization. This study innovatively developed toon leaf tea 
(TLT) using black tea processing techniques. Through integrated metabolomic 
analysis and health benefit evaluation, we systematically compared the 
differences in chemical composition and hypoglycemic effect between TLT and 
traditionally dried mature toon leaves (TOL). Metabolomic analysis revealed that 
the two processing methods induced significant changes in 41 metabolites. 
Compared with TOL, TLT demonstrated significant enrichment in functional 
components including flavonoids (e.g., quercetin derivatives), limonoids, and 
amino acids, along with a marked reduction in phenolic acids and organic acids. 
The synergistic effects of these components effectively improved product flavor 
and enhanced bioactivity. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that the α 
- glucosidase/α - amylase inhibitory activity of TLT and the hypoglycemic effect 
on diabetes model mice are significantly better than that of TOL. This study not 
only elucidates the transformation patterns of chemical constituents in mature 
toon leaves under different processing methods but also provides a scientific 
basis for the resource utilization of mature toon leaves.

Effects of ripeness (nearly ripe, ripe, fully ripe) and cultivar ('Blink', 
'Polka' and 'Senga Sengana') on colour and chemical composition of strawberry 
fruits and their suitability for jam production, evaluated as stability during 
storage at 4 and 20°C for 3 and 6months, were investigated. Quality traits of 
fruits and jams were significantly affected by both ripeness stage and cultivar. 
However, after 6months of storage, particularly at 20°C, the effects of fruit 
ripeness and cultivar were considerably reduced. During jam storage, 
anthocyanins, ascorbic acid, chroma and hue were least stable in jams made from 
the least ripe fruits. Quality traits in jams made from 'Senga Sengana' were 
best preserved during storage, while quality and chemical composition in jams 
made from 'Blink' changed the most. In conclusion, fully ripe fruits were best 
suited for jam processing. Storage at low temperature was preferable and 'Senga 
Sengana' was the most and 'Blink' the least suitable cultivar for processing.

Propolis has various biological activities such as antibacterial, antiviral, 
antioxidant, immunostimulating and antiinflammatory, which are generally 
ascribed to the polyphenolic fraction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
absorption of the main polyphenols [caffeic acid (CA), pinobanksin-5methyl ether 
(P-5ME), pinobanksin (Pb), chrysin (C), pinocembrin (P), galangin (G), 
pinobanksin-3-acetate, pinobanksin esters and caffeic acid phenylethyl ester 
(CAPE)] from a dewaxed and standardized extract of propolis (EPID). Fifteen 
healthy volunteers consumed 5 mL EPID in water, corresponding to 125 mg of 
flavonoids. Blood samples were collected before, each hour for 8 h and 24 h 
after EPID intake. After deconjugation by beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase the 
plasma samples were analyzed by a selective liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method using morin as internal standard (I.S.). A 
kinetic profile characterized by two t(max), respectively at 1 h and about 5 h 
post-ingestion, was observed in all the subjects. The two peaks may be due to 
enterohepatic cycling. Among the various polyphenols ingested, only P-5ME, Pb, 
C, P and G were detected in plasma and C(max)t(1h) were 65.7 +/- 13.3, 46.5 +/- 
12.7, 79.5 +/- 18.6, 168.1 +/- 16.3 and 113.7 +/- 16.8 ng/mL, respectively. 
These levels decreased significantly after 8 h and were no longer detectable 24 
h after EPID intake. The recovery of the extraction for CA, Pb, C, P, G and I.S. 
from spiked plasma was 95.2 +/- 3.1, 93.1 +/- 3.6, 91 +/- 2.5, 96.4 +/- 4.2, 
93.4 +/- 2.4 and 85.5 +/- 2.4%, respectively. The results of this study evidence 
that flavonoids from EPID are absorbed, metabolized and Pb-5ME and G seem to 
have apparent absorption, measured as (AUC/dose), higher than C, P and Pb.

Basella alba is a frequently consumed leafy vegetable. However, research on its 
nutritional components is limited. This study aimed to explore the variation in 
the nutritional components and antioxidant capacity of different cultivars and 
organs of Basella alba. Here, we primarily chose classical spectrophotometry and 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to characterize the variation in 
nutritional components and antioxidant capacity among different organs 
(inflorescences, green fruits, black fruits, leaves, and stems) of eight typical 
cultivars of Basella alba. The determination indices (and methods) included the 
total soluble sugar (anthrone colorimetry), total soluble protein (the Bradford 
method), total chlorophyll (the ethanol-extracting method), total carotenoids 
(the ethanol-extracting method), total ascorbic acid (the HPLC method), total 
proanthocyanidins (the p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde method), total flavonoids 
(AlCl3 colorimetry), total phenolics (the Folin method), and antioxidant 
capacity (the FRAP and ABTS methods). The results indicated that M5 and M6 
exhibited advantages in their nutrient contents and antioxidant capacities. 
Additionally, the inflorescences demonstrated the highest total ascorbic acid 
and total phenolic contents, while the green and black fruits exhibited 
relatively high levels of total proanthocyanidins and antioxidant capacity. In a 
comparison between the green and black fruits, the green fruits showed higher 
levels of total chlorophyll (0.77-1.85 mg g-1 DW), total proanthocyanidins 
(0.62-2.34 mg g-1 DW), total phenolics (15.28-27.35 mg g-1 DW), and ABTS 
(43.39-59.16%), while the black fruits exhibited higher levels of total soluble 
protein (65.45-89.48 mg g-1 DW) and total soluble sugar (56.40-207.62 mg g-1 DW) 
in most cultivars. Chlorophyll, carotenoids, and flavonoids were predominantly 
found in the leaves of most cultivars, whereas the total soluble sugar contents 
were highest in the stems of most cultivars. Overall, our findings underscore 
the significant influence of the cultivars on the nutritional composition of 
Basella alba. Moreover, we observed notable variations in the nutrient contents 
among the different organs of the eight cultivars, and proanthocyanidins may 
contribute significantly to the antioxidant activity of the fruits. On the 
whole, this study provides a theoretical basis for the genetic breeding of 
Basella alba and dietary nutrition and serves as a reference for the 
comprehensive utilization of this vegetable.

In the extracts of fresh raw and frozen broccoli, caffeic, ferulic, sinapinic 
acids and kaempferol were identified. Boiling reduced the amounts of caffeic 
acid and kaempferol in both samples. The concentration of polyphenols was 
2.69mg/g fresh mass and 0.96mg/fresh mass in fresh raw broccoli and frozen raw 
broccoli, respectively. Boiling significantly decreased the amounts of phenolic 
compounds in fresh broccoli (1.58mg/g of fresh mass). In the case of frozen 
broccoli, boiling increased the concentration of polyphenols by 38%. Fresh 
broccoli extract neutralized free radicals by 19.87%. Boiling significantly 
reduced its antiradical activity (to 15.06%). Samples of frozen broccoli had a 
27.06% antiradical ability. Boiling did not change the antiradical activity in 
frozen broccoli case. Hydrothermal processing significantly influenced on the 
ability of the extracts to inhibit the decolorization of β-carotene emulsion. 
The extract of fresh broccoli had a higher activity when uncooked. Boiling 
seemed to increase this activity in the case of frozen broccoli samples. The 
results of the studies on the ability of broccoli extracts to inhibit linoleic 
acid autooxidation were ambiguous and depended on the method applied. No 
correlation was found between the content of phenolic compounds and the 
antioxidant activity of the extracts, regardless of the experimental variant and 
technique used.

The content of anthocyanins, flavonols, and carbohydrates of Tropea red onions 
(Allium cepa L.) was determined by HPLC and HPLC-MS. Cyanidin derivatives 
constitute >50% of total anthocyanins, but delphinidin and petunidin 
derivatives, which have not been reported in red onions thus far, were also 
detected. The flavonoid distribution in the different layers of the bulbs 
indicates that, after homelike peeling, the edible portion contains 79% of the 
total content of quercetin 4'-glucoside but only 27% of the anthocyanins. 
Storage of onions for 6 weeks in different conditions, all of them mimicking 
home storage habits, resulted in a decrease to 64-73% of total anthocyanins. The 
same trend was verified for the total antioxidant activity, which was reduced to 
29-36%. A decrease in glucose and fructose content correlated with anthocyanin 
degradation was also observed. Storage at low temperature seems to better 
preserve the onion anthocyanins.

Freshwater algae possess remarkable metabolic flexibility and environmental 
resilience, enabling them to adapt to polluted habitats and contribute to 
ecological restoration. This study investigates the physiological and 
biochemical responses of five green algal taxa: Monoraphidium sp., Scenedesmus 
sp., Nephrocytium sp., Chlorococcum sp., and Klebsormidium sp. during a 25-day 
phycoremediation of contaminated water of the Yamuna River, New Delhi, India. 
The water, characterized by high concentrations of organic matter, nutrients, 
and heavy metals, induced species-specific metabolic adjustments. A decline in 
chlorophyll a and b (31.25% ± 2.25% to 67.11% ± 5.37% and 11.49% ± 0.25% to 
86.98% ± 3.21%, respectively) indicated stress or damage to the photosynthetic 
system. This decline can be caused by various abiotic or biotic stress factors, 
while carotenoid accumulation, particularly in Chlorococcum sp. 
(307.70% ± 4.32%), suggested photoprotective adaptations. Enhanced biosynthesis 
of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in Chlorococcum sp. (139.33% ± 4.32% and 
81.81% ± 2.72%, respectively) correlated with elevated antioxidant activity 
across all species (27.67% ± 1.61% to 73.51% ± 2.44% DPPH inhibition). Lipid 
content shifts were species-dependent, with Monoraphidium sp. showing the 
highest increase (63.02% ± 2.09%). Elemental CHNS analysis revealed increased 
carbon content and reduced nitrogen and sulfur levels, indicating altered 
nutrient dynamics. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) elucidated distinct 
clusters reflecting interspecific differences in stress-responsive metabolic 
traits. This study demonstrates the metabolic plasticity and stress tolerance of 
green algae under complex pollutant loads, advancing our understanding of algal 
adaptation mechanisms. It shows that phycoremediation not only enhances 
interspecific biochemical divergence but also alters algal elemental 
stoichiometry. By integrating multivariate biochemical analysis with CHNS 
profiling, we identify nitrogen as the primary driver of post-treatment 
differentiation. These findings highlight both the ecological and 
biotechnological relevance of algae in integrated water treatment and 
sustainable biomass utilization, while offering a novel framework for selecting 
candidate species in environmental remediation and biotechnological 
applications.

Using liquid/liquid extraction, three fractions were obtained from an Italian 
red wine containing single polyphenolic subfractions: (1) phenolic acids and 
quercetin-3-glucuronide, (2) catechins and quercetin-3-glucoside, and (3) 
anthocyanins. Beside the scavenging capacity of the different fractions against 
hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals, the in vitro inhibition of low density 
lipoprotein oxidation and platelet aggregation (two main events in the 
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis) were tested. The antioxidant activity of the 
fractions has been compared with that of the original red wine before and after 
dealcoholization. The anthocyanin fraction was the most effective both in 
scavenging reactive oxygen species and in inhibiting lipoprotein oxidation and 
platelet aggregation. This higher activity can be explained by both its high 
concentration in red wine and its antioxidant efficiency, which, at least for 
peroxyl radical scavenging, was three times as high as that of the other two 
fractions. Our results suggest that anthocyanins could be the key component in 
red wine in light of the protection against cardiovascular diseases, although 
this hypothesis needs in vivo evidence.

BACKGROUND: Aqueous extracts of most medicinal plants traditionally employed in 
Portugal (at the ratio of 1 g plant: 110 mL water) have been assayed for total 
antioxidant capacity and phenol content, in order to elucidate their claimed 
medicinal features.
RESULTS: The antioxidant activity was assessed by the ABTS(•+) method; the 
ascorbic acid equivalent values ranged from 1.4280 ± 0.1261 g L(-1) for avocado 
(Persea americana (Lauraceae)) obtained by infusion of powder, down to 0.0027 ± 
0.0012 g L(-1) for olive (Olea europaea (Oleaceae)) obtained by infusion of 
leaves. Total phenol content was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure; 
the gallic acid equivalent values ranged from 0.5541 ± 0.0289 g L(-1) for 
avocado obtained by infusion of powder, down to 0.0053 ± 0.0014 g L(-1) for 
olive obtained by boiling leaves. A good correlation between total antioxidant 
capacity and total phenol content was found.
CONCLUSION: The method of powder infusion should be chosen if high concentration 
of antioxidants are sought. On the other hand, a high antioxidant capacity and a 
high phenol content correlate well with the empirically established (and widely 
publicised) capacity to treat respiratory infections. Copyright © 2007 Society

The effect of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) and cooking on the flavonoids 
and vitamin C content (ascorbic + dehydroascorbic acid; AA + DHAA) of fresh-cut 
spinach was evaluated. The total flavonoid content (approximately 1000 mg 
kg(-)(1) f.w.) remained quite constant during storage in both air and MAP 
atmospheres, while vitamin C (750 mg kg(-)(1)f.w.) was better preserved in 
MAP-stored spinach. AA was transformed to DHAA during storage, and its 
concentration was higher in MAP-stored tissues. The free-radical scavenging 
activity of the isolated flavonoids was tested, and only those flavonoids with 
either a dihydroxyl grouping or acylated with ferulic acid showed significant 
activity. A decrease in the total antioxidant activity was observed during 
storage, particularly important in MAP-stored spinach. The higher content of 
DHAA and lower content of both AA and antioxidant flavonoids in the MAP-stored 
samples could explain this antioxidant activity decrease. Boiling extracted 50% 
of total flavonoids and 60% vitamin C in the cooking water. However, flavonoid 
glucuronides were extracted more in the cooking water than the other glycosides. 
The vitamin C content of the cooked tissue was higher in those samples stored in 
MAP.

The antioxidant activity of pomegranate juices was evaluated by four different 
methods (ABTS, DPPH, DMPD, and FRAP) and compared to those of red wine and a 
green tea infusion. Commercial pomegranate juices showed an antioxidant activity 
(18-20 TEAC) three times higher than those of red wine and green tea (6-8 TEAC). 
The activity was higher in commercial juices extracted from whole pomegranates 
than in experimental juices obtained from the arils only (12-14 TEAC). HPLC-DAD 
and HPLC-MS analyses of the juices revealed that commercial juices contained the 
pomegranate tannin punicalagin (1500-1900 mg/L) while only traces of this 
compound were detected in the experimental juice obtained from arils in the 
laboratory. This shows that pomegranate industrial processing extracts some of 
the hydrolyzable tannins present in the fruit rind. This could account for the 
higher antioxidant activity of commercial juices compared to the experimental 
ones. In addition, anthocyanins, ellagic acid derivatives, and hydrolyzable 
tannins were detected and quantified in the pomegranate juices.

A number of different beverage products claim to have antioxidant potency due to 
their perceived high content of polyphenols. Basic and applied research 
indicates that pomegranate juice (PJ), produced from the Wonderful variety of 
Punica granatum fruits, has strong antioxidant activity and related health 
benefits. Although consumers are familiar with the concept of free radicals and 
antioxidants, they are often misled by claims of superior antioxidant activity 
of different beverages, which are usually based only on testing of a limited 
spectrum of antioxidant activities. There is no available direct comparison of 
PJ's antioxidant activity to those of other widely available polyphenol-rich 
beverage products using a comprehensive variety of antioxidant tests. The 
present study applied (1) four tests of antioxidant potency [Trolox equivalent 
antioxidant capacity (TEAC), total oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), 
free radical scavenging capacity by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and 
ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)]; (2) a test of antioxidant 
functionality, that is, inhibition of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation by 
peroxides and malondialdehyde methods; and (3) evaluation of the total 
polyphenol content [by gallic acid equivalents (GAEs)] of polyphenol-rich 
beverages in the marketplace. The beverages included several different brands as 
follows: apple juice (3), açaí juice (3), black cherry juice (3), blueberry 
juice (3), cranberry juice (3), Concord grape juice (3), orange juice (3), red 
wines (3), iced tea beverages (10) [black tea (3), green tea (4), white tea 
(3)], and a major PJ available in the U.S. market. An overall antioxidant 
potency composite index was calculated by assigning each test equal weight. PJ 
had the greatest antioxidant potency composite index among the beverages tested 
and was at least 20% greater than any of the other beverages tested. Antioxidant 
potency, ability to inhibit LDL oxidation, and total polyphenol content were 
consistent in classifying the antioxidant capacity of the polyphenol-rich 
beverages in the following order: PJ>red wine>Concord grape juice>blueberry 
juice>black cherry juice, açaí juice, cranberry juice>orange juice, iced tea 
beverages, apple juice. Although in vitro antioxidant potency does not prove in 
vivo biological activity, there is also consistent clinical evidence of 
antioxidant potency for the most potent beverages including both PJ and red 
wine.

Orange juice manufactured at industrial scale was subjected to digestion under 
in vitro gastrointestinal conditions (pH, temperature, and enzyme and chemical 
conditions) to evaluate the influence of individual industrial processing 
treatments on flavanone solubility, stability, and ability to permeate through a 
membrane under simulated physiological conditions. Four industrial processes 
including squeezing, standard pasteurization, concentration, and freezing were 
evaluated. Hand squeezing was compared with industrial squeezing. After in vitro 
gastrointestinal digestion of the orange juices, the flavanones able to permeate 
through a dialysis membrane, and those remaining in the retentate were evaluated 
by HPLC as were those present in the insoluble fraction. In all of the assayed 
orange juices, a high content of precipitated chalcones ( approximately 70% of 
the total flavanones) was formed under the physiological conditions of the 
gastrointestinal tract. Hand squeezing provided a higher concentration of 
flavanones in the permeated fraction and lower transformation to chalcones than 
industrial squeezing. Standard pasteurization did not influence the solubility 
and permeability of the orange juice flavanones and chalcones. Industrial 
concentration did not affect the amount of flavanones able to permeate but 
decreased the chalcones produced. Juices produced from frozen orange juice 
contained considerably smaller amounts of both soluble flavanones and insoluble 
chalcones.

Pithecellobium dulce (P. dulce) is a Mexican plant that is consumed raw or in 
different preparations, and its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties 
have traditionally been useful in treating several conditions. However, the 
post-harvest drying process can alter the content of bioactive compounds in P. 
dulce. This study aims to evaluate the impact of different drying methods on the 
phenolic profile and antioxidant capacity of this plant, as well as its 
inhibitory effect on human SW480 colon adenocarcinoma cells. After oven drying, 
the samples showed a higher amount (p < 0.05) of phenolic compounds, up to 
1149.45 ± 69.27 mg GAE/100 g LE, which is 80% more than the freeze-dried 
samples. Also, the antioxidant capacity was higher in oven-dried samples, with 
44.63 ± 2.00 µmol Trolox equivalents/g LE, 108% more than the freeze-dried 
method. Methanolic extraction, in turn, yielded better results than aqueous and 
ethanolic extractions. Up to 14 polyphenolic compounds were detected in 
oven-dried samples. For in vitro assays in SW480 cells, the 50% v/v methanolic 
extract was used. From this extract, the median lethal concentration (LC50) was 
determined to be 13.76 mg/mL, which represents the concentration necessary to 
inhibit the growth of half of the cancer cells of this cell line. The extract 
led to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and an increase in apoptosis-induced 
cell death. The P. dulce extract augmented p53 and decreased KRAS gene 
expressions. Results suggested pro-apoptotic mechanisms in colon cancer cells in 
vitro linked to P. dulce bioactive compounds, which are better preserved when 
oven-dried plants are subjected to methanolic extraction.

St, 15-195 Białystok, Poland.

Quinolizidine alkaloids, found particularly in leguminous plants (Fabaceae), are 
known for their role in plant protection, acting as toxic secondary metabolites 
against pests and pathogens. However, their toxicity also makes them 
anti-nutritional factors in food and feed. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor 
their presence. The aim of this study is to optimise two stages of the research 
procedure, i.e., (1) the conditions of LC-MS/MS instrumental analysis for the 
simultaneous determination of five alkaloids: angustifolin, hydroxylupanine, 
sparteine, and two geometric isomers of lupanine and isolupanine, and (2) the 
extraction and isolation stage of six different leguminous matrices: field 
beans, peas, lupins (narrow-leaved, white, yellow) and lentils. The modified and 
validated QuEChERS method based on LC-MS/MS shows acceptable recoveries 
(71-115%) with relative standard deviation <15%. A slight matrix effect 
(-20-14%) was observed. The uncertainty of the method <28%. The developed method 
shows significant progress in terms of sensitivity, achieving a detection limit 
as low as 0.01 mg/kg. This is a significant improvement over existing analytical 
methods and highlights the great potential of this method for detecting trace 
amounts. The innovative, sensitive, and selective method, offering simplicity 
and speed, was applied to the analysis of real leguminous samples.

This study aimed to assess the use of selected raw materials, such as 
whole-grain oat flakes, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and flaxseeds, to obtain 
bars using baking and drying methods. Modifying the bars' composition involved 
selecting the fibre preparation, replacing water with NFC juice, and using fresh 
apple juice and apple pomace. The Psyllium fibre preparation, also in the form 
of a mixture with apple fibre, was the most useful in dough cohesion and the 
quality of the bars. Baked bars were characterised by higher sensory quality 
than those obtained by drying. Microwave-convection drying was a good 
alternative to baking, primarily due to the lower temperature resulting in a 
lower acrylamide content and comparable product quality. The basic grain 
ingredients and fibre preparations mainly shaped the nutritional and energy 
value and the sensory and microbiological quality. Modifying the recipe using 
NFC or fresh juice and apple pomace allowed the bars to develop new properties 
and quality characteristics. The use of NFC juices resulted in a reduction in 
the pH of the bars, which is associated with a higher microbiological quality of 
the bars. All bars had low acrylamide content, significantly lower than the 
permissible level. Using fresh pomace or fibre preparations made from 
by-products is a possibility to increase the fibre content in the bars and a 
method of managing by-products.

Phenolic composition of red wines from Stanušina, a grape variety indigenous of 
the Republic of Macedonia, was compared with the regional Vranec and the 
international Cabernet Sauvignon. The extent of skin contact (i.e. maceration 
time) on levels of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of wines was 
evaluated. A total of 19 phenolic compounds were identified and quantified. 
Among these malvidin-3-glucoside and its derivatives were the major compounds, 
while caftaric acid was the predominant cinnamic acid derivative, followed by 
catechin, the main flavan-3-ol. The concentration of hydroxycinnamic acids, 
anthocyanins and (+)-catechin ranged from 224 to 511 mg/L, 22 to 360 mg/L and 26 
20 to 375 mg/L, respectively and peaked at 3rd, 6th and 9th day of maceration, 
respectively. However, prolong maceration slightly decreased their 
concentration. Stanušina wines presented high levels of hydroxycinnamic acids 
and antioxidant activity.

The concentrations of 11 phenols and 5 furans were measured in 12 categories of 
distilled spirits by HPLC methodology, together with the total antioxidant 
status (TAS) of the same beverages. Ellagic acid was the phenol present in 
highest concentration in all beverages. Moderate amounts of syringaldehyde, 
syringic acid, and gallic acid, as well as lesser amounts of vanillin and 
vanillic acid, were measurable in most samples of whiskey, brandy, and rum but 
were largely undetectable in gin, vodka, liqueurs, and miscellaneous spirits. 
5-(Hydroxymethyl)furfural was the predominant furan in the former three 
beverages, notably cognac, with 2-furaldehyde the next highest, but these were 
undetectable in most of the latter beverages. Highest TAS values were given by 
armagnac, cognac, and bourbon whiskey, all three of which tended toward the 
highest concentrations of phenols. Negative TAS values were exhibited by rum, 
vodka, gin, and miscellaneous spirits in line with the low or undetectable 
phenol concentrations in these beverages. Wood aging is the most likely source 
of phenols and furans in distilled spirits. Those beverages exposed to this 
treatment contain significant antioxidant activity, which is between the ranges 
for white and red wines, with the potential to augment the antiatherosclerotic 
functions attributable to the ethanol that they contain.

Flavoring olive oils is a new trend in consumer preferences, and different 
enrichment techniques can be used. Coextraction of olives with a flavoring agent 
is an option for obtaining a flavored product without the need for further 
operations. Moreover, ultrasound (US) assisted extraction is an emergent 
technology able to increase extractability. Combining US and coextraction, it is 
possible to obtain new products using different types of olives (e.g., cultivar 
and ripening stage), ingredient(s) with the greatest flavoring and/or bioactive 
potential, as well as extraction conditions. In the present study, mastic thyme 
(Thymus mastichina L.) (TM) and lemon thyme (Thymus x citriodorus) (TC) were 
used for flavoring Cornicabra oils by coextraction. The coextraction trials were 
performed by (i) thyme addition to the olives during crushing or malaxation and 
(ii) US application before malaxation. Several parameters were evaluated in the 
oil: quality criteria parameters, total phenols, fatty acid composition, 
chlorophyll pigments, phenolic profile and oxidative stability. US application 
did not change the phenolic profile of Cornicabra olive oils, while the 
enrichment of olive oils with phenolic compounds or pigments by coextraction was 
very dependent on the thyme used. TM enrichment showed an improvement of several 
new phenolic compounds in the oils, while with TC, fewer new phenols were 
observed. In turn, in the trials with TC, the extraction of chlorophyll pigments 
was higher, particularly in crushing coprocessing. Moreover, the oils obtained 
with US and TM added in the mill or in the malaxator showed lower phenol 
decrease (59%) than oils flavored with TC (76% decrease) or Cornicabra virgin 
olive oil (80% decrease) over an 8-month storage period. Multivariate data 
analysis, considering quality parameters, pigments and phenolic contents, showed 
that flavored oils were mainly grouped by age.

In this work, an Italian extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) sample and the same 
sample added with a carotenoid-rich nutraceutical extract from Lycium barbarum 
L. (EVOOCar) were subjected to a frying process to comparatively assess chemical 
and physical changes and heat stability. Oxidation progress was monitored by 
measuring oil quality changes such as peroxide value, free acidity, K232, K268, 
and fatty acid composition as well as minor compound content, phenols, 
α-tocopherol, and carotenoids. An UHPLC/QTOF-MS metabolomics approach 
discriminated the two oil samples based on their chemical changes during frying, 
identifying also the phenolic classes most exposed to statistically significant 
variations. Partial least square discriminant analysis and volcano analysis were 
applied together to identify the most significant markers allowing group 
separation. The decrease in total phenolic content was lower in EVOOCar than in 
EVOO during frying. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids showed a 
significant percentage loss, 3.7% and 17.2%, respectively, in EVOO after 180min 
frying at 180°C, while they remained constant or slightly changed in EVOOCar. 
Zeaxanthin added to the oil rapidly decreased during the frying process. These 
findings showed that the addition of a carotenoid extract from L. barbarum can 
help to improve the oxidative stability of extra-virgin olive oil.

The chemical properties of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) from Arbequina variety 
grown in Türkiye were evaluated, and its major phenolic compounds (PC) 
(oleocanthal, oleacein, luteolin and tyrosol) were compared with drugs 
(bempedoic acid and ezetimibe) involved in LDL metabolism through in silico 
analyses. The fatty acids composition (FA), PC and volatile organic compound 
(VC) profiles of EVOO obtained from Arbequina olive were evaluated via 
chromatographic methods (GC-FID, HPLC). The quality parameters, including total 
phenolic content (TPC), pigment content, peroxide value (PV), free fatty acid 
levels (FFA) and absorption coefficients, were determined via spectrophotometric 
methods. ADMET profiles, density functional theory (DFT), molecular docking, and 
the biological targets and activities of oleocanthal, oleacein, luteolin, 
tyrosol, bempedoic acid and ezetimibe were calculated and compared. Oleocanthal, 
oleacein, and luteolin completely passed the rules of Lipinski, Ghose, Veber, 
Egan, and Muegge, whereas only luteolin met the optimum ranges of all the 
criteria on the radar map. All 4 PC strongly inhibited OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, 
whereas oleocanthal, oleacein, and luteolin inhibited CYP3A4. Additionally, 
luteolin, oleocanthal and ezetimibe had individual inhibitory effects on CYP1A2, 
CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, respectively. Oleacein had the best binding affinity for 
LDLR, whereas luteolin had the best binding affinity for PCSK9 and ACLY. 
Oleacein was biologically effective against pathogens such as Leishmania 
species, but showed high reactivity with a low energy gap and high malleability. 
In conclusion, oleacein, oleocanthal and luteolin have potential therapeutic 
functions in LDL metabolism, which plays a role in atherosclerosis. However, 
experimental and clinical studies are needed for more evidence.

The phenolic compounds hydroxycinnamates, anthocyanins, flavonols, and 
flavan-3-ols of sweet cherry cultivars Burlat, Saco, Summit, and Van harvested 
in 2001 and 2002 were quantified by HPLC-DAD. Phenolics were analyzed at 
partially ripe and ripe stages and during storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C (room 
temperature) and 1-2 degrees C (cool temperature). Neochlorogenic and 
p-coumaroylquinic acids were the main hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, but 
chlorogenic acid was also identified in all cultivars. The 3-glucoside and 
3-rutinoside of cyanidin were the major anthocyanins. Peonidin and pelargonidin 
3-rutinosides were the minor anthocyanins, and peonidin 3-glucoside was also 
present in cvs. Burlat and Van. Epicatechin was the main monomeric flavan-3-ol 
with catechin present in smaller amounts in all cultivars. The flavonol rutin 
was also detected. Cultivar Saco contained the highest amounts of phenolics [227 
mg/100 g of fresh weight (fw)] and cv. Van the lowest (124 mg/100 g of fw). 
Phenolic acid contents generally decreased with storage at 1-2 degrees C and 
increased with storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C. Anthocyanin levels increased at 
both storage temperatures. In cv. Van the anthocyanins increased up to 5-fold 
during storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C (from 47 to 230 mg/100 g of fw). Flavonol 
and flavan-3-ol contents remained quite constant. For all cultivars the levels 
of phenolic acids were higher in 2001 and the anthocyanin levels were higher in 
2002, which suggest a significant influence of climatic conditions on these 
compounds.

Chlorogenic acid, the ester of caffeic acid with quinic acid, is one of the most 
abundant polyphenols in the human diet with coffee, fruits and vegetables as its 
major sources. Its antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties have been well 
established in animal studies. However, little is known about its gut absorption 
and metabolism. In the present work, four groups of rats (n = 8) were fed a diet 
supplemented with chlorogenic, caffeic or quinic acids (250 micromol/d) or an 
unsupplemented diet for 8 d. Parent compounds and their metabolites were 
estimated in urine (24-h collection) and plasma by HPLC-electrospray 
ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Significant differences in their levels 
were observed among the groups. The recovery of chlorogenic acid in urine was 
low (0.8%, mol/mol), and the total urinary excretion of caffeic acid liberated 
by hydrolysis of chlorogenic acid and its tissular methylated metabolites 
(ferulic and isoferulic acids) did not account for >0.5% (mol/mol) of the dose 
ingested. On the other hand, the metabolites of microbial origin, namely, 
m-coumaric acid and derivatives of phenylpropionic, benzoic and hippuric acids, 
represented the major compounds in both urine and plasma. Hippuric acid largely 
originated from the transformation of the quinic acid moiety, and all other 
metabolites from the caffeic acid moiety. These microbial metabolites accounted 
for 57.4% (mol/mol) of the chlorogenic acid intake. Such a high abundance of 
microbial metabolites shows that the bioavailability of chlorogenic acid depends 
largely on its metabolism by the gut microflora. Their potential importance in 
explaining the biological effects of dietary polyphenols is emphasized.

Apples are known to exhibit various beneficial effects on human health. In the 
present study, we investigated the effect of continuous intake of apple juice 
(AJ) on constipation status. A single dose of loperamide in rats as the 
constipation model markedly decreased the weight and number of fecal pellets 
compared to saline-administered rats as a control. After the administration of 
AJ twice a day for seven days, recovery of defecation close to that of the 
control was observed in loperamide-treated rats. In addition, the total bile 
acid content in the feces increased from day 4 after the administration of AJ. 
Among hepatic and intestinal transporters and enzymes that regulate bile acids, 
the mRNA expression of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (Asbt, 
slc10a2) was decreased by AJ in rats. Furthermore, the Asbt-mediated bile acid 
transport activity in the rat ileum decreased after AJ administration. Moreover, 
in human colonic cancer-derived Caco-2 cells, AJ exposure for 24 and 48 h 
decreased the expressions of ASBT mRNA and protein, and the uptake activity of 
taurocholic acid in both 7- and 21-d cultures. Several components of AJ, such as 
procyanidins, decreased the expression of ASBT in Caco-2 cells. In conclusion, 
ASBT downregulation is a possible mechanism responsible for the 
constipation-relieving effect of apples, and procyanidins may play a role in 
downregulating ASBT, which leads to the beneficial effects of apples against 
constipation. Although it is generally agreed that the common dietary 
compositions play a role in constipation relief, the novel specific mechanism of 
apples found in this study would facilitate understanding food functions.

Mangroves represent a promising yet underexplored source of natural products. 
Sonneratia caseolaris (mangrove apple) is a widely distributed species with a 
long history of use in traditional medicine, and it is receiving increasing 
recognition for its bioactive secondary metabolites. Research has expanded in 
recent decades, but findings remain dispersed across diverse sources, 
complicating interpretation of its chemistry and pharmacological potential. This 
review consolidates four decades of investigations, documenting 141 identified 
compounds from studies largely restricted to India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and 
China and focusing on leaves, fruits, bark, stems, and twigs, with roots notably 
unexplored. The phytochemical profile is dominated by phenolic acids, 
flavonoids, and tannins, alongside terpenoids, steroids, fatty acids, fatty 
alcohols, aldehydes, hydrocarbons, and polysaccharides. The most extensively 
studied activities are antioxidant and antimicrobial, with extracts consistently 
exhibiting strong free-radical scavenging capacity and broad-spectrum 
antibacterial and antifungal effects, including efficacy against drug-resistant 
strains. Additional reports describe central nervous system depressant, 
antidiarrheal, metabolic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic, and 
anti-allergic activities. In contrast, anticancer investigations remain scarce, 
despite promising outcomes reported for related mangrove taxa. By consolidating 
and critically evaluating the existing evidence, this review highlights the 
pharmacological potential of S. caseolaris and identifies key knowledge gaps to 
guide future marine drug discovery.

The fate of anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and ellagitannins was studied following 
the consumption of 300 g of raspberries by healthy human volunteers and subjects 
with an ileostomy. Postingestion plasma and urine from the former and ileal 
fluid and urine from the latter group were collected and analyzed by 
HPLC-PDA-MS(2). Plasma from the healthy volunteers did not contain detectable 
quantities of either the native raspberry polyphenolics or their metabolites. 
The three main raspberry anthocyanins were excreted in urine in both healthy and 
ileostomy volunteers 0-7 h after ingestion, in quantities corresponding to <0.1% 
of intake. This indicates a low level of absorption in the small intestine. With 
ileostomy volunteers 40% of anthocyanins and 23% of the ellagitannin sanguiin 
H-6 were recovered in ileal fluid with the main excretion period being the first 
4 h after raspberry consumption. The recovery of ellagic acid in ileal fluid was 
241%, indicating hydrolysis of ellagitannins in the stomach and/or the small 
intestine. Urinary excretion of ellagic acid and an ellagic acid-O-glucuronide 
was <1% of intake. No intact or conjugated forms of ellagitannins were detected 
in urine from either healthy subjects or ileostomy volunteers. However, in 
healthy subjects, but not the ileostomists, ellagitannins were catabolized with 
the appearance of urolithin A-O-glucuronide, two of its isomers, and urolithin 
B-O-glucuronide in urine collected 7-48 h after raspberry consumption. There was 
marked variation in the urolithin profile of individual volunteers, indicating 
differences in the colonic microflora responsible for ellagitannin degradation.

Recent studies have shown that dietary fiber and polyphenols of vegetables and 
fruits improve lipid metabolism and prevent the oxidation of low density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which hinder the development of 
atherosclerosis. The goal of this study was to measure the total polyphenol and 
dietary fiber contents of some tropical fruits (i.e., pineapple, wax apple, 
rambutan, lichi, guava, and mango) and compare the results to the content of 
these substances in the better characterized persimmon. It was found that lichi, 
guava, and ripe mango (cv. Keaw) have 3.35, 4.95, and 6.25 mg of total 
polyphenols in 100 g fresh fruit, respectively. This is significantly higher 
than in persimmon, pineapple, wax apple, mature green mango, and rambutan [P < 
0.0005 for pineapple (Smooth Cayene variant), wax apple, persimmon, rambutan, 
mature green mango (cv. Keaw); the value of P < 0.001 is found only for 
pineapple (Phuket, Queen variant)]. The same relationship was observed for the 
contents of gallic acid and of dietary fiber. It can be supposed that among the 
studied fruit, lichi, guava, and ripe mango may be preferable for dietary 
prevention of atherosclerosis.

Tyrosol is a phenolic compound present in two of the traditional components of 
the Mediterranean diet: wine and virgin olive oil. The presence of tyrosol has 
been described in red and white wines. Tyrosol is also present in vermouth and 
beer. Tyrosol has been shown to be able to exert antioxidant activity in in 
vitro studies. Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) appears to occur 
predominantly in arterial intima in microdomains sequestered from antioxidants 
of plasma. The antioxidant content of the LDL particle is critical for its 
protection. Thus, phenolics, which are able to bind LDL, could be effective in 
preventing lipid peroxidation and atherosclerotic processes. The ability of 
tyrosol to bind human LDL has been reported. We have demonstrated the 
bioavailability of tyrosol in humans from virgin olive oil in its natural form. 
Urinary tyrosol increased, reaching a peak at 0-4 h after virgin olive oil 
administration. Men and women showed a different pattern of urinary excretion of 
tyrosol. Moreover, tyrosol is absorbed in a dose-dependent manner after 
sustained and moderate doses of virgin olive oil. In summary, our results 
suggest that tyrosol from wine or virgin olive oil could exert beneficial 
effects on human health in vivo if its biological properties are confirmed in in 
vivo studies.

Dietary fibers, major phenolics, main minerals, and trace elements in persimmons 
and apples were analyzed and compared in order to choose a preferable fruit for 
an antiatherosclerotic diet. Fluorometry and atomic absorption spectrometry 
following microwave digestion were optimized for the determination of major 
phenolics and minerals. Total, soluble, and insoluble dietary fibers, total 
phenols, epicatechin, gallic and p-coumaric acids, and concentrations of Na, K, 
Mg, Ca, Fe, and Mn in whole persimmons, their pulps, and peels were 
significantly higher than in whole apples, pulps, and peels (P < 0.01-0.0025). 
Conversely, the contents of Cu and Zn were higher in apples than in persimmons. 
In persimmons and apples all of the above components were higher in their peels 
than in whole fruits and pulps. The relatively high contents of dietary fibers, 
total and major phenolics, main minerals, and trace elements make persimmon 
preferable for an antiatherosclerotic diet.

Polish garlic and white and red onions were subjected to blanching, boiling, 
frying, and microwaving for different periods of time, and then their bioactive 
compounds (polyphenols, flavonoids, flavanols, anthocyanins, tannins, and 
ascorbic acid) and antioxidant activities were determined. It was found that 
blanching and frying and then microwaving of garlic and onions did not decrease 
significantly the amounts of their bioactive compounds and the level of 
antioxidant activities ( P > 0.05). The HPLC profiles of free and soluble ester- 
and glycoside-bound phenolic acids showed that trans-hydroxycinnamic acids 
(caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic) were as much as twice higher in 
garlic than in onions. Quercetin quantity was the highest in red onion among the 
studied vegetables. The electrophoretic separation of nonreduced garlic and 
onion proteins after boiling demonstrated their degradation in the range from 50 
to 112 kDa.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the present work was to evaluate the phytochemical 
profile and the antioxidant activity of strawberry fruit (cv. Camarosa) upon 
postharvest ripening at room temperature (20 °C) and to correlate them with 
qualitative attributes.
RESULTS: 'Camarosa' fruit retained an appreciable postharvest performance for up 
to 1 day shelf life; thereafter substantial quality deterioration was observed. 
An increased phenolic content, mainly attributed to hydroxycinnamic acids, 
flavonols and anthocyanins, was monitored after 3 days maintenance at 20 °C. The 
chromatographic fingerprint of athocyanins showed that pelargonidin-3-glucoside 
was the major anthocyanin, which increased with the increase of shelf life 
period, while cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside were found at 
lower concentrations. The potent radical scavenging activity, evaluated with 
four in vitro assays, showed a higher antioxidant capacity after 3 and 1 days of 
shelf life. In addition, the antioxidant effect of strawberry fruit extracts on 
lipid substrates and on an emulsion system showed a significant inhibition in 
the formation of conjugated diene hyperoxides. Interestingly, no direct 
correlation between the phytochemical profile and the quality attributes exist.
CONCLUSION: 'Camarosa' fruit had acceptable quality attributes for fresh 
consumption and at the same time a high phytochemical content up to 1 day shelf 
life. The over-ripe fruit continued to be an excellent reservoir of natural 
antioxidants, pointing to its potential use as food antioxidant and nutritional 
supplement.

Roasted barley is traditionally valued as a tea ingredient for its flavor and 
health-promoting benefits, which are governed by steeping and roasting 
conditions. This study investigated the effects of particle size (>4.0 mm (S0), 
1.0-4.0 mm (S1), 0.5-1.0 mm (S2), 0.25-0.5 mm (S3), 0.125-0.25 mm (S4), and 
<0.125 mm (S5)) on the release patterns of constituents, as well as the 
antioxidant and lipolysis inhibitory properties of black highland barley (BHB) 
roasted at different temperatures (180-240°C) during tea infusion preparation. 
Results revealed that constituent leaching generally increased with decreasing 
steeping particle size, with β-glucan, free glucose, and polyphenols peaking at 
S4, but total sugar and protein at S5. The release levels of constituents during 
steeping were mainly governed by roasting temperature, with BHB roasted above 
200°C significantly enhancing their contents in the tea infusions (p < 0.05), 
whereas roasting at 240°C resulted in decreases in β-glucan, protein, and free 
glucose. Consequently, the steeping cycle and color characteristics were shaped 
by the interactive effect of grinding and roasting. Relatively higher radical 
scavenging activities were observed in tea infusions at S4, with the highest 
rates found in those roasted at 240°C. However, tea infusions of BHB roasted at 
200°C exhibited the strongest lipolysis inhibition. These results suggested that 
steeping at S4 was preferred for roasted black highland barley (RBHB) beverages, 
with functional benefits primarily determined by roasting temperature.

Quercetin-4'-glucoside is a major flavonol in onions, and this study 
investigated the absorption and fate of radiolabeled quercetin-4'-glucoside in 
rats. Rats ingested [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside and the distribution of 
radioactivity throughout the body was determined after 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 h. The 
gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, and plasma were extracted, and 
radiolabeled components were identified and quantified using high-performance 
liquid chromatography with on-line radioactivity detection and tandem mass 
spectrometry. Two hours after dosing, all the [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside 
had been metabolized. More than 85% of the ingested radioactivity was present in 
the gastrointestinal tract at all time points with approximately 6% being 
absorbed and present in blood and internal organs, primarily the liver and 
kidneys. More than 95% of the absorbed radioactivity was in the form of >20 
different methylated glucuronated and/or sulfated quercetin conjugates. Five 
hours after ingestion, the main radiolabeled metabolites were quercetin

be the gastrointestinal tract. Quercetin metabolites may have a major influence 
on the gut mucosal epithelium and on colonic disease.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Gastric ulcer (GU) is a significant public 
health challenge that impacts millions globally. Palm tree species (family 
Arecaceae) have been traditionally adopted for inflammatory and gastrointestinal 
conditions, among which Aiphanes eggersii Burret remains under exploration.
AIM OF THE STUDY: For the first time, the phenolic profile of defatted aqueous 
ethanol extract (DAEE) of the palm tree Aiphanes eggersii Burret was carried 
out, in addition to the anti-ulcer potential of DAEE in an ethanol-induced 
gastric ulcer (GU) model in rats was assessed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical composition was determined using HPLC/MS, 
chromatographic, and spectroscopic techniques. Rats were pretreated with DAEE 
(200, 400, and 800 mg/kg) or sucralfate (100 mg/kg) for 14 days before the 
induction of GU with a single dose of ethanol (5 mL/kg). Gastric tissues were 
evaluated macroscopically, biochemically, and histologically.
RESULTS: Seven phenolics were isolated, viz, vicenin II (1), rutin (2), 
quercitrin (3), kaempferin (4), cirsimaritin (5), quercetin (6), and caffeic 
acid (7). In addition, fifty-one metabolites belonging to various classes were 
tentatively identified using HPLC/MS. The DAEE significantly declined the ulcer 
index and improved the gastric protection dose independently. It enhanced the 
antioxidant effect via decreasing MDA and increasing GSH, SOD, and CAT. It 
suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, as well 
as the NF-κB/p65 pathway. Moreover, it upregulated HO-1/Nrf2 signaling, restored 
PGE2 levels, and decreased the levels of COX-1 and COX-2. Histological findings 
confirmed mucosal protection and healing.
CONCLUSION: The phenolic-rich extract of A. eggersii Burret exhibits potent 
gastroprotective activity, supporting its potential as a natural therapeutic for 
GU management, while clinical investigation is needed.

BACKGROUND: Kiwifruit is nutrient-rich but prone to postharvest spoilage. 
Conventional juicing results in a significant loss of bioactive compounds, which 
limits its functional value.
RESULTS: Xuxiang kiwifruit juice was fermented using three lactic acid bacterial 
strains: Limosilactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Weissella. 
The highest fermentation performance was observed in juice fermented with L. 
acidophilus: the viable cell count in the L. acidophilus group was significantly 
higher by 3.54% compared to the Weissella-fermented group, reaching 
(2.8 ± 0.5) × 109 CFU mL-1 (P < 0.001). The total acidity increased by 87.01% 
relative to the unfermented sample, achieving 20.59 ± 0.01 g L-1 (P < 0.001). 
After 32 h of fermentation, the total phenolic content increased by 28.94% 
compared to the control, reaching 3.03 ± 0.03 g L-1 (P < 0.001), while the 
vitamin C content represented a 3.22% improvement over the Weissella group 
(P < 0.001). The succinic acid content increased by 24.32% compared to the 
unfermented control, reaching 1.12 ± 0.01 mg mL-1 (P < 0.0001). Notably, ethyl 
palmitate was produced during fermentation with L. acidophilus, contributing to 
a creamy aroma. During fermentation with Weissella, the contents of glutamate 
and glycine were increased, and the ABTS radical scavenging activity increased 
by 27.89% compared to the unfermented control, reaching 95.06 ± 1.22% 
(P < 0.0001). During fermentation with L. fermentum, the flavonoid content 
increased dramatically by 135.29% relative to the unfermented control, reaching 
0.8 ± 0.05 g L-1 (P < 0.0001). After in vitro digestion, the ABTS radical 
scavenging capacity increased by 11.90% compared to the control, reaching 
83.19 ± 1.27% (P < 0.01), and superoxide dismutase activity increased by 3.82%, 
reaching 30 736 U mL-1 (P < 0.05). Fermentation with L. fermentum elevated key 
aroma compounds, including (E)-2-hexen-1-ol (22.54 ± 0.03%), 1-nonanol 
(1.32 ± 0.02%) and (E)-1-(2,6,6-trimethyl-1,3-cyclohexadien-1-yl)-2-buten-1-one 
(4.06 ± 0.02%). This resulted in an enriched flavor profile characterized by 
grassy, floral and citrus, rose and honey notes, along with an enhanced 
perception of berry-like sweetness.
CONCLUSION: The three lactic acid bacterial strains exhibited distinct 
functional advantages during kiwifruit juice fermentation, and L. fermentum 
demonstrated superior overall performance in both flavor compatibility and 
functional preservation. These results provide a technical basis for the 
development of high-quality probiotic kiwifruit beverages. © 2025 Society of

RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Chilling injury is a major disorder affecting the quality 
of tropical and subtropical vegetables during low temperature storage. Snap bean 
(Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is sensitive to chilling injury. The main purpose of the 
present study is to investigate the alleviating effects of 1-methylcyclopropene 
(1-MCP) on chilling injury of snap bean. In addition, the related mechanisms 
were also detected from the perspective of the changes of antioxidant defense 
system.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Snap beans were exposed to different volume fractions of 
1-MCP. After 24 h of treatment, snap beans were stored at 4 °C for up to 14 
days. Chilling injury index, electrolyte leakage, titratable acidity and total 
soluble solids were determined. Contents of chlorophyll, ascorbic acid and 
malondialdehyde were assessed. The total antioxidant capacity, Fe(II) ion 
chelating capacity, scavenging capacities on free radicals and activities of 
antioxidant enzymes were detected. Total phenol content and activities of 
related metabolic enzymes were also determined.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: 1-MCP treatment reduced chilling injury index, 
electrolyte leakage rate and malondialdehyde content of snap beans. The amounts 
of total soluble solids, titratable acid, ascorbic acid and total chlorophyll in 
1-MCP-treated snap beans were significantly higher than those of control. The 
snap beans treated with 1-MCP showed stronger total antioxidant capacity and 
metal chelating activity. The 1-MCP treatment enhanced scavenging effects of 
snap beans on superoxide, hydroxyl and 1,1-diphenyl-2-trinitrophenylhydrazine 
radicals. The activities of peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, superoxide 
dismutase and catalase in 1-MCP-treated group were higher than of control. The 
treatment also enhanced the accumulation of phenolic compounds in snap beans by 
regulating the activities of phenol-metabolizing enzymes such as shikimate 
dehydrogenase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase 
and polyphenol oxidase. In conclusion, with the mechanism that involves the 
activation of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems, 1-MCP has the 
ability to avoid chilling injury of snap bean.
NOVELTY AND SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION: This study gives insights into whether 
1-MCP can regulate postharvest cold resistance in vegetables by enhancing the 
enzymatic antioxidant system and inducing the accumulation of non-enzymatic 
antioxidants. Considering the results, 1-MCP treatment could be an effective 
method to alleviate postharvest chilling injury of snap beans during low 
temperature storage.

In the current era, it is important to consider economic and ecological 
sustainability issues while optimally meeting the nutrient needs of poultry. The 
use and research of alternative feedstuffs have gained importance due to these 
factors. The aim of this study is to reveal the raw lupin seeds' nutrient 
ingredients as an alternative feedstuff and the effects of debittering methods. 
In the present study, two different treatments (germination for 2 days; heat 
treatment in an autoclave at 130 °C for 20 min) were applied to white and blue 
lupin seeds, and the differences in nutrient compositions between them and raw 
seeds were determined. When fatty acid compositions were analyzed, oleic, 
γ-linolenic, arachidic, behenic, erucic, and lignoceric acid values were found 
to be the highest in the raw, autoclaved, and germinated forms of white lupin (p 
< 0.01). The highest values of palmitic, stearic, and linoleic acids were 
observed in blue lupin (p < 0.01). While the value of total quinolizidine 
alkaloids (QA) in raw white lupin grains was higher than 1.943 mg/g, it was 
higher than 1.800 mg/g in autoclaved and germination-treated grains. Similarly, 
the total QA value of raw blue lupin grains was 0.894 mg/g, 0.609 ± 0.244 mg/g 
in germination-treated seeds, and 0.705 ± 0.282 mg/g in autoclave-treated seeds. 
As a result of these findings, it can be said that the methods applied for the 
removal of bitterness gave promising results. Furthermore, it would be rewarding 
to use these lupin varieties in in vitro and in vivo experiments to reveal the 
impacts and mechanisms of debittering methods on poultry.

Sichuan Congou black tea (SCGBT), one of China's top three high-aroma black 
teas, enjoys widespread consumer popularity. However, research into optimal 
processing varieties remains insufficient. This study assessed the quality of 
SCGBT produced from eight tea varieties: 'Fudingdabai' (FDDB), 'Zhongcha 302' 
(ZC302), 'Wuniuzao' (WNZ), 'Chuancha 2' (CC2), 'Fuxuan 9' (FX9), 'Mingshan 131' 
(MS131), 'Zhongcha 108' (ZC108), and 'Huangjinya' (HJY). Sensory evaluation, 
quantitative chemical analysis, and metabolomics techniques were employed. 
Results indicated that HJY, ZC302, and MS131 exhibited strong sweetness, umami, 
and mellowness, while CC2, FX9, and ZC108 were characterized by intense 
bitterness and astringency, attributed to high tea polyphenol levels and low 
free amino acid concentrations. The quality of WNZ and FDDB was relatively 
average. Using non-targeted metabolomics, 4,476 metabolite ion features were 
detected, and 75 significantly differential metabolites were identified 
(p < 0.05 and VIP > 1.0). Correlation analysis revealed that metabolites such as 
valine, L-glutamic acid, asparagine, L-serine, 
kaempferol-3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, quercetin-7-O-glucoside, L-tyrosine, 
and L-norleucine significantly influenced the taste of the tea infusion 
(|r| > 0.8, p < 0.05). Elevated levels of amino acids (L-glutamic acid and 
asparagine) and phenolic acids (gallic acid) contributed to the umami of HJY, 
ZC302, and MS131. Astringency was primarily determined by variations in 
flavonol/flavone and flavonol/flavone glycosides, as well as ester catechins. 
Additionally, the content of sweet-tasting amino acids and non-ester catechins 
was found to fluctuate. In summary, ZC302, MS131, and HJY are more suitable for 
processing into higher-grade SCGBT. These findings provide a theoretical and 
practical foundation for selecting and breeding high-quality SCGBT varieties and 
ensuring consistent product quality.

Metabolic profiling is a valuable tool for elucidating the biochemical pathways 
and key metabolites involved in the health benefits associated with microbial 
fermentation. In this study, we investigated the metabolic changes occurring 
during the fermentation of lettuce leaves by Bacillus subtilis, a widely studied 
bacterium known for its diverse metabolic capabilities. Through non-targeted 
metabolic profiling, we identified and characterized metabolites that may 
contribute to the beneficial effects of fermented lettuce. Using gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), we identified 54 metabolites in the 
fermented lettuce samples. Additionally, we elucidated the alterations in 
metabolite profiles during the bioconversion of lettuce using B. subtilis. 
Notably, 11,14-eicosadienoic acid, 13-docosenoic acid, and oleic acid were 
either produced or enriched during bioconversion, were identified as potential 
contributors to the enhanced nutritional and bioactive properties of fermented 
lettuce. This study underscores the potential of metabolic profiling to uncover 
the metabolic pathways and specific metabolites associated with health benefits 
in fermented foods. These findings pave the way for developing functional foods 
with improved nutritional value and bioactivity.

A method was developed for the simultaneous detection of eight polyphenols 
(t-resveratrol, (+)-catechin, quercetin and p-coumaric, caffeic, sinapic, 
ferulic, and gallic acids) by CZE with electrochemical detection. Separation of 
these polyphenols was achieved within 25 min using a 200 mM borate buffer (pH 
9.4) containing 10% methanol as separation electrolyte. Amperometric detection 
of polyphenols was carried out with a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified 
with a multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNT) layer obtained from a dispersion of 
CNT in polyethylenimine. The excellent electrochemical properties of this 
modified electrode allowed the detection and quantification of the selected 
polyphenols in white wines without any pretreatment step, showing remarkable 
signal stability despite the presence of potential fouling substances in wine. 
The electrophoretic profiles of white wines, obtained using this methodology, 
have proven to be useful for the classification of these wines by means of 
chemometric multivariate techniques. Principal component analysis and 
discriminant analysis allowed accurate classification of wine samples on the 
basis of their grape varietal (verdejo and airén) using the information 
contained in selected zones of the electropherogram. The utility of the proposed 
CZE methodology based on the electrochemical response of CNT-modified electrodes 
appears to be promising in the field of wine industry and it is expected to be 
successfully extended to classification of a wider range of wines made of other 
grape varietals.

Proanthocyanidins (PAs) have been shown to have potential health benefits. 
However, no data exist concerning their dietary intake. Therefore, PAs in common 
and infant foods from the U.S. were analyzed. On the bases of our data and those 
from the USDA's Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII) of 
1994-1996, the mean daily intake of PAs in the U.S. population (>2 y old) was 
estimated to be 57.7 mg/person. Monomers, dimers, trimers, and those above 
trimers contribute 7.1, 11.2, 7.8, and 73.9% of total PAs, respectively. The 
major sources of PAs in the American diet are apples (32.0%), followed by 
chocolate (17.9%) and grapes (17.8%). The 2- to 5-y-old age group (68.2 
mg/person) and men >60 y old (70.8 mg/person) consume more PAs daily than other 
groups because they consume more fruit. The daily intake of PAs for 4- to

In the United States, commercially available foods, including cocoa and 
chocolate, are being marketed with statements referring to the level of 
antioxidant activity and polyphenols. For cocoa-containing foods, there has been 
no comprehensive survey of the content of these and other chemistries. A survey 
of cocoa and chocolate-containing products marketed in the United States was 
conducted to determine antioxidant activity and polyphenol and procyanidin 
contents. Commercially available samples consisted of the top market share 
products in each of the following six categories: natural cocoa, unsweetened 
baking chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet baking chips, milk chocolate, and 
chocolate syrup. Composite samples were characterized using four different 
methods: oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), vitamin C equivalence 
antioxidant capacity (VCEAC), total polyphenols, and procyanidins. All composite 
lots were further characterized for percent nonfat cocoa solids (NFCS) and 
percent fat. Natural cocoas had the highest levels of antioxidant activities, 
total polyphenols, and procyanidins followed by baking chocolates, dark 
chocolates and baking chips, and finally milk chocolate and syrups. The results 
showed a strong linear correlation between NFCS and ORAC (R (2) = 0.9849), total 
polyphenols (R (2) = 0.9793), and procyanidins (R (2) = 0.946), respectively. On 
the basis of principal component analysis, 81.4% of the sample set was 
associated with NFCS, antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, and procyanidins. 
The results indicated that, regardless of the product category, NFCS were the 
primary factor contributing to the level of cocoa antioxidants in the products 
tested. Results further suggested that differences in cocoa bean blends and 
processing, with the possible exception of Dutching, are minor factors in 
determining the level of antioxidants in commercially available cocoa-containing 
products in the United States.

Previous microbiological research demonstrated the presence of a rich 
micro-flora composed mainly of yeasts in the suspended fraction of freshly 
produced olive oil. Some of the yeasts are considered harmful as they can damage 
the quality of the olive oil through the hydrolysis of the triacylglycerols. 
Present research has demonstrated that the lipolytic activity of some 
lipase-producer strains belonging to a yeast species called Candida adriatica, 
Candida diddensiae and Yamadazyma terventina can be modulated by the water and 
the polyphenol content of olive oil. Laboratory tests highlighted a substantial 
increase in free fatty acid in the inoculated olive oil characterized by high 
water content and low polyphenol concentration. The acidity of the olive oil 
samples containing 0.06% and 0.31% of water increased significantly by 33% in 
the lipase-producer yeast strains tested during a period of 2 weeks of 
incubation at 30 °C. All other yeasts showed strong lipolytic activity in the 
presence of 1.31% of water - the only exception to this was the C. adriatica 
1985 strain. The phenolic compounds typical of olive oil represent another 
important factor able to condition the viability and the lipolytic activity of 
the lipase-producer yeasts. From the tests performed on the olive oil 
characterized by an increasing content of total polyphenols equal to 84, 150 and 
510 mg per kg of oil, the percentage of the lipase-producer yeasts able to 
hydrolyse the triacylglycerols was respectively 100%, 67% and 11%.

A validated method was developed for the simultaneous determination of the 
hydroxycinnamates caffeic acid (CA), dihydrocaffeic acid (DHCA), ferulic acid 
(FA), dihydroferulic acid (DHFA), and isoferulic acid (IFA) in human plasma as 
metabolites derived from coffee consumption. The method includes a protein 
precipitation step prior to enzymatic hydrolysis of the conjugated metabolites 
(sulfate, glucuronide, and/or ester) back to their aglycone forms. After 
liquid-liquid extraction, the reconstituted extract was analysed by 
high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to negative electrospray 
ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. Calibration curves were constructed from 
spiked human plasma samples in the range of 0-4800 nM for each of the targeted 
analytes. Two internal standards, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid (500 nM) 
and 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid (200 nM), were spiked at the beginning of the 
sample preparation and before analysis, respectively. Good performance data were 
obtained with limits of detection and quantification of the five 
hydroxycinnamates ranging between 1-15 nM and 3-50 nM, respectively. Within and 
between-days precisions were respectively calculated between 8-18% and 8-30% (at 
50 nM added initially), between 6-9% and 6-12% (at 200 nM), and between 5-9% and 
5-9% (at 500 nM). Precision calculated from different analysts ranged from 18% 
to 44% (at 50 nM), from 8% to 16% (at 200 nM), and from 4% to 8% (at 500 nM). 
Using this method, we determined plasma levels in humans and measured the 
efficiency of deconjugation using our enzymatic cocktail.

The phenolic constituents of seeds of 12 different apple cultivars were 
fractionated by sequential extraction with aqueous acetone (30:70, v/v) and 
ethyl acetate after hexane extraction of the lipids. Low molecular weight 
phenolic compounds were individually quantitated by RP-HPLC-DAD. The contents of 
extractable and nonextractable procyanidins were determined by applying RP-HPLC 
following thiolysis and n-butanol/HCl hydrolysis, respectively. As expected, the 
results revealed marked differences of the ethyl acetate extracts, aqueous 
acetone extracts, and insoluble residues with regard to contents and mean 
degrees of polymerization of procyanidins. Total phenolic contents in the 
defatted apple seed residues ranged between 18.4 and 99.8 mg/g. Phloridzin was 
the most abundant phenolic compound, representing 79-92% of monomeric 
polyphenols. Yields of phenolic compounds significantly differed among the 
cultivars under study, with seeds of cider apples generally being richer in 
phloridzin and catechins than seeds of dessert apple cultivars. This is the 
first study presenting comprehensive data on the contents of phenolic compounds 
in apple seeds comprising extractable and nonextractable procyanidins. 
Furthermore, the present work points out a strategy for the sustainable and 
complete exploitation of apple seeds as valuable agro-industrial byproducts, in 
particular as a rich source of phloridzin and antioxidant flavanols.

Five French cider apple varieties were compared on the basis of their detailed 
polyphenol profile in the cortex and in the juices. Among the factors studied, 
variety was the most important variability factor in fruits, whereas polyphenol 
profiles showed an overall stability from one year to another, and a limited 
decrease of polyphenol concentration was observed during the starch regression 
period of fruit maturation. In juices, procyanidins remained the preponderant 
polyphenol class with concentrations up to 2.4 g/L even in centrifuged juices. 
Compared to the fruits, the average degree of polymerization of procyanidins was 
significantly reduced in the juice. Centrifugation of the crude juice had only 
minor effects on the polyphenol composition. For one variety, highly polymerized 
procyanidins with average degrees of polymerization of 25 were shown to be 
soluble in the centrifuged juice at a concentration of close to 1.2 g/L. 
Oxygenation of the juices during processing resulted in a significant decrease 
of all classes of native polyphenols. Catechins and procyanidins were 
particularly affected by oxidation, whereas caffeoylquinic acid was partly 
preserved. The transfer of polyphenols after pressing was maximal for 
dihydrochalcones and minimal for procyanidins with extraction yield values close 
to 80 and 30%, respectively.

BACKGROUND: In the last years pectin and other hydrocolloids were tested for 
improving the color stability and the retention of bioactive compounds in gelled 
fruit-based products. In line with these concerns, our study has been directed 
to quantify the changes in antioxidant status and color indices of blackberry 
jam obtained with different types of pectin (degree of esterification: DE, 
degree of amidation: DA) and doses in response to processing and storage for 1, 
3 and 6 months at 20°C.
RESULTS: Blackberry jam was obtained by a traditional procedure used in 
households or small-scale systems with different commercial pectins (HMP: 
high-methoxyl pectin, LMP: low-methoxyl pectin and LMAP: low-methoxyl amidated 
pectin) added to three concentrations (0.3, 0.7 and 1.0%) and investigated in 
terms of total monomeric anthocyanins (TMA), antioxidant capacity expressed as 
ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), total phenolics (TP), color density 
(CD) and percent of polymeric color, PC (%). Thermal processing resulted in 
significant depreciation of analyzed parameters reported to the corresponding 
values of fresh fruit as follows: TMA (69-82%), TP (33-55%) and FRAP (18-52%). 
Biologically active compounds and color were best retained one day 
post-processing in jams with LMAP followed by samples with LMP and HMP. Storage 
for 6 months brings along additional dramatic losses reported to the values 
recorded one day post-processing as follows: TMA (31-56%), TP (29-51%) and FRAP 
(20-41%). Also, both processing and storage resulted in significant increases in 
PC (%). The pectin type and dosage are very influential factors for limiting the 
alterations occurring in response to processing and storage. The best color 
retention and the highest TMA, TP and FRAP were achieved by LMAP, followed by 
LMP and HMP. Additionally, a high level of bioactive compounds in jam could be 
related to a high dose of pectin. LMAP to a level of 1% is the most indicated to 
provide the highest antioxidant properties in jam.
CONCLUSIONS: The retention of bioactive compounds and jam color stability were 
strongly dependent on the pectin type and dosage. By a proper selection of 
pectin type and dose could be limited the losses recorded in response to 
processing and storage.

Changes in blackberry ellagitannin composition in response to juicing (clarified 
and nonclarified), pureeing, canning (in water or syrup), and freezing as well 
as changes in processed products during 6 months of storage were investigated. 
Canning, pureeing, and freezing had little effect on ellagitannins, but 
processing berries into nonclarified and clarified juices resulted in total 
ellagitannin losses of 70 and 82%, respectively, due to removal of 
ellagitannin-rich seeds in the presscake. Minimal changes in total ellagitannin 
content were observed during storage of thermally processed products, but 
compositional changes indicative of ellagitannin depolymerization were apparent. 
The ellagitannin content and composition of frozen berries remained stable over 
6 months of storage. Ellagitannins are well retained in canned, pureed, and 
frozen blackberries, but methods are needed to prevent losses during juice 
processing and/or exploit the ellagitannin-rich coproducts.

The steryl ferulate contents of rye and wheat grains and their milling fractions 
were analyzed using a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic 
(HPLC) method. HPLC-mass spectrometry was used for identification. In addition, 
steryl ferulates of some selected milling byproducts were determined. The total 
steryl ferulate contents of rye and wheat grains were 6.0 and 6.3 mg/100 g, 
respectively. Uneven distribution of steryl ferulates in the grains led to 
considerable differences in the milling products; their steryl ferulate contents 
ranged from trace amounts in flours with low ash content to 20 and 34 mg/100 g 
in rye and wheat brans, respectively. Campestanyl ferulate and sitostanyl 
ferulate were the main components, followed by campesteryl ferulate and 
sitosteryl ferulate, whereas sitosterol was the main component in total sterols. 
Among the other samples, a byproduct of rice milling (pearling dust) was the 
best source of steryl ferulates, its total steryl ferulate content being 119 
mg/100 g, whereas no measurable amounts of steryl ferulates were measured in oat 
bran or pearling dust of barley. The results indicated that rye and wheat and 
especially their bran fractions are comparable to corn as steryl ferulate 
sources.

The amounts of quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol aglycons in 25 edible 
berries were analyzed by an optimized RP-HPLC method with UV detection and 
identified with diode array and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry 
detection. Sixteen species of cultivated berries and nine species of wild 
berries were collected in Finland in 1997. Quercetin was found in all berries, 
the contents being highest in bog whortleberry (158 mg/kg, fresh weight), 
lingonberry (74 and 146 mg/kg), cranberry (83 and 121 mg/kg), chokeberry (89 
mg/kg), sweet rowan (85 mg/kg), rowanberry (63 mg/kg), sea buckthorn berry (62 
mg/kg), and crowberry (53 and 56 mg/kg). Amounts between 14 and 142 mg/kg of 
myricetin were detected in cranberry, black currant, crowberry, bog 
whortleberry, blueberries, and bilberry. Kaempferol was detected only in 
gooseberries (16 and 19 mg/kg) and strawberries (5 and 8 mg/kg). Total contents

α-glucosidase enzyme). Fortification was made with extracts of polyphenolic 
compounds of selected plant raw materials rich in polyphenols from quince 
(fruits), tilia (flowers), pomegranate (skin), passion fruit (endocarp), sour 
cherries (leaves), haskap and chokeberry (berries), silver skin (coffee beans), 
rosehip (seeds). Depending on the nature of the polyphenol extract, flavan-3-ols 
(monomeric and polymeric), phenolic acid, flavonols and anthocyanins were 
identified in the product in amounts ranging from 53.7 to 212.6 mg/100 g DM. 
Cookies' colour (L*, a*, b*) depended on the type of polyphenol extract used for 
fortification. Cookies with haskap, chokeberry and sour cherry presented the 
highest antioxidant potential. Cookies with chokeberry, haskap and rosehip 
presented high activity in inhibiting α-amylase (65.5, 60.6 and 62.2% of 
inhibition, respectively), but cookies with haskap, silver skin and quince in 
inhibiting α-glucosidase activity (23.0, 20.4 and 21.4% of inhibition, 
respectively). In the sensory evaluation, the most attractive were cookies with 
rosehip and pomegranate (6.3 and 5.8 score, respectively), but the lowest 
ratings were given to cookies with passion fruit and silver skin but especially 
quince cookies, which obtained the lowest desirability (3.7 score). The 
acceptability of fortified cookies was determined to the least extent by 
monomeric flavan-3-ols and phenolic acids (in minus in odour/flavour, 
bitterness, sweetness and global satisfaction), but anthocyanins, polymeric 
procyanidins and flavonols had the most significant positive impact on consumer 
acceptance of the assessed features, i.e., global satisfaction, odour/flavour, 
sweetness and bitterness (positive consumer drivers).

Effects of domestic processing and storage on the flavonols quercetin, 
myricetin, and kaempferol in five berries were studied using an optimized 
RP-HPLC method with UV and diode array detection after an acid hydrolysis of the 
corresponding glycosides. In fresh berries, the total content of flavonols was 
highest in lingonberry (169 mg/kg) and black currant (157 mg/kg), intermediate 
in bilberry (41 mg/kg) and strawberry (17 mg/kg), and lowest in red raspberry 
(9.5 mg/kg). Cooking strawberries with sugar to make jam resulted in minor 
losses (quercetin 15%, kaempferol 18%). During cooking of bilberries with water 
and sugar to make soup, 40% of quercetin was lost. Traditional preservation of 
crushed lingonberries in their own juice caused a considerable (40%) loss of 
quercetin. Only 15% of quercetin and 30% of myricetin present in unprocessed 
berries were retained in juices made by common domestic methods (steam-extracted 
black currant juice, unpasteurized lingonberry juice). Cold-pressing was 
superior to steam-extraction in extracting flavonols from black currants. During 
9 months of storage at 20 C, quercetin content decreased markedly (40%) in 
bilberries and lingonberries, but not in black currants or red raspberries. 
Myricetin and kaempferol were more susceptible than quercetin to losses during 
storage.

We evaluated the absorbability of anthocyanins in humans and rats administered 
with a beverage prepared from an extract of the tuber of purple sweet potato 
(Ipomoea batatas Cultivar Ayamurasaki), or with an anthocyanin concentrate. Two 
major anthocyanin components, cyanidin 
3-O-(2-O-(6-O-(E)-caffeoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside)-5-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside) 
and peonidin 
3-O-(2-O-(6-O-(E)-caffeoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside)-5-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside), 
were detected in the plasma and urine of both rats and humans by HPLC or liquid 
chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The plasma concentration of 
anthocyanins in humans reached a maximum 90 minutes after ingestion, and the 
recovery of anthocyanins in the urine was estimated as 0.01-0.03%. These results 
indicate that acylated anthocyanins could be selectively absorbed after 
ingesting food.

Purification of polar fractions from cacao liquor extracts gave 17 phenolics 
including four new compounds. The new compounds were characterized as a 
C-glycosidic flavan, an O-glycoside of a dimeric and two O-glycosides of 
trimeric A-linked proanthocyanidins, on the basis of spectroscopic data. 
Isolated polyphenols showed inhibitory effects on nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate-dependent lipid peroxidation in microsomes and on the 
autoxidation of linoleic acid. These effects were attributed to the 
radical-scavenging activity in the peroxidation chain reactions, based on the 
findings that the cacao polyphenols effectively scavenged the 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical.

Cassia bark or cortex cinnamomi, the dried stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia Presl. 
(Lauraceae), is a popular natural spice and a commonly used herb in traditional 
Chinese medicine. However, adulterants are frequently found in the market. In 
this study, 44 samples of Cassia bark including bark from seven related 
Cinnamomum species were collected from fields and market. Four characteristic 
components, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, and coumarin were 
determined by RP-HPLC, and a fingerprint comprised of five markers was 
established. These results showed that cassia barks contained high contents of 
cinnamaldehyde (13.01-56.93 mg/g). The highest content of cinnamaldehyde (up to 
93.83 mg/g) was found in debarked cortex, which is traditionally regarded as 
having the best quality in local herb shops. In contrast, the adulterants from 
the other Cinnamomum species, C. wilsonii Camble, C. japonicum Sieb., C. mairei 
Levl. and C. burmanii (Nees) Blume, contained low contents of cinnamaldehyde 
(<2.00 mg/g). The content of cinnamaldehyde in C. loureirii Nees was comparable 
to that in C. cassia. It is suggested that five characteristic peaks by HPLC are 
suitable for distinguishing genuine cassia bark from the adulterants and could 
be applied in the quality control of this commodity.

The antiradical activity of dry beans was evaluated in order to assess the 
validity of this test and to correlate the results with those achieved with the 
Folin-Ciocalteu method and with a rapid spectrophotometric method for the 
analysis of total flavonoids. Four landraces (12 samples) of common beans 
(Phaseolus vulgaris L.), collected in two regions of Italy (Tuscany and 
Basilicata) in three different years, were analyzed. The EC50 values ranged from 
39 to 2810 mg sample/mg 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazil radical. The phenolic 
content of each sample was expressed as gallic acid equivalents; it changed from 
1.17 to 4.40 mg/g. The flavonoid content, expressed as mg of (+)-catechin per g 
of dry seeds, ranged from 0.24 to 1.43 mg/g. The qualiquantitative composition 
of polyphenols has been also elucidated by means of high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC)-diode array detection and HPLC/MS. These investigations 
showed that rapid tests can contribute to assessing the quality of functional 
food.

Soy foods are a dietary source of high-quality protein, essential 
micronutrients, and isoflavones with the potential to contribute to numerous 
health benefits. Previous research has examined the effects of soy isoflavones 
on health in adults, but comparatively little is known regarding the health 
effects of isoflavones in childhood. The Plants Optimizing Development Study 
(PODS) seeks to address this significant research gap. Children (N = 96) between 
the ages of 8-11 years will be recruited to participate in a 3-month 
randomized-controlled clinical trial. Treatment group participants will receive 
daily, a mix of soy foods with the target total isoflavone (i.e., daidzein, 
genistein, and glycitein) intake of 50 mg/d. The control group will consume 
isocaloric soy-free alternatives. The primary outcomes are sex steroids excreted 
in urine. Secondary outcomes include Android:Gynoid fat ratio, bone mineral 
density (BMD), blood lipids and fasting glucose, fecal microbial α-diversity, 
β-diversity, microbial taxa relative abundance, and cognition. Dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry will assess BMD and Android:Gynoid fat ratio. Urine samples will 
be analyzed for sex steroids using Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and 
adjusted for urinary creatinine. Stool and venous blood samples will assess gut 
microbiota and metabolic marker analyses, respectively. Cognitive assessments 
will include the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities and Academic 
Achievement IV, a spatial memory task, and a modified Eriksen flanker task. The 
central hypothesis is that greater soy isoflavone consumption will not alter sex 
steroid levels but will be associated with beneficial outcomes on body 
composition, metabolic health, and the gut-brain axis in pre- and early 
adolescents.

Dietary supplements manufactured from red clover are widely marketed to provide 
the beneficial health effects of isoflavones without changing the original diet. 
In this study the metabolism of formononetin and biochanin A, the principal 
isoflavones of red clover, was studied in human subjects. Seven women ingested 
four red clover dietary supplements, and the metabolites of the isoflavones were 
identified in their urine samples. The structures of trimethylsilyl derivatives 
of the metabolites were established by GC-MS. New reduced metabolites of 
formononetin (dihydroformononetin and angolensin) and biochanin A 
(dihydrobiochanin A and 6'-hydroxyangolensin) were identified in urine samples 
using authentic reference compounds. Possible metabolic pathways are presented 
for the red clover isoflavones formononetin and biochanin A.

Soy isoflavones have recently gained considerable interest due to their possible 
health benefits. However, detailed studies on the metabolism of isoflavones are 
lacking. The aims of the investigation presented here were (1) to study the in 
vitro intestinal metabolism of isoflavones and their hydroxylated analogues 
3'-OH-daidzein, 6-OH-daidzein, 8-OH-daidzein, and 3'-OH-genistein and (2) to 
characterize the structures of some earlier identified urinary metabolites of 
soy isoflavones, for which no authentic reference compounds have been available. 
Isoflavone standards (1-2 mg) were fermented with human fecal flora (16.7%) for 
24 h. Metabolites formed during the fermentation were tentatively identified by 
interpretation of the mass spectra of trimethylsilylated compounds obtained by 
GC-MS. Compounds having hydroxyl groups at 5-position (i.e., genistein and 
3'-OH-genistein) were completely converted to metabolites that could not be 
detected by the methods used in this study. The metabolism of daidzein and its 
hydroxylated analogues, 3'-OH-daidzein, 6-OH-daidzein, and 8-OH-daidzein, 
occurred to a much lesser extent. Minor amounts of reduced metabolites (i.e., 
isoflavanones and alpha-methyldeoxybenzoins) of these compounds were tentatively 
identified in fermentation extracts. The retention times and the mass spectra of 
reduced isoflavone metabolites, obtained from in vitro fermentations of pure 
compounds, were utilized to identify unknown urinary metabolites of soy 
isoflavones. Four novel isoflavone metabolites were identified in human urine 
collected after soy supplementation: 3' '-OH-O-desmethylangolensin, 
3',4',7-trihydroxyisoflavanone, 4',7,8-trihydroxyisoflavanone, and 
4',6,7-trihydroxyisoflavanone.

Sesamin and sesamolin were isolated and crystallized from high‐lignan cultivars, and their purity was confirmed by HPLC and spectral (UV and fluorescence) analysis.</jats:p>"

Whole grains have been associated with numerous beneficial health outcomes and 
are recommended in Canada's Food Guide; however, there is little research on 
whole grains specific to Canada. Therefore, the objective of this study was to 
characterize the association between Canadians' WG intake and nutrients, food 
groups and diet quality and to understand top sources of WG in the diets of 
Canadians. We used data from the Canadian Community Health Survey 2015: a 
cross-sectional survey that collected information on diet (using a 24-hour 
recall) and health from 20,487 Canadians 1 year and older. We classified study 
participants according to their WG intake: non-WG (n = 10,883) and three groups 
based on age-specific tertiles of WG intake, low-WG (n = 3,322), mid-WG (n = 
3,180), and high-WG (n = 3,102). Results were analyzed using population-based 
survey methods and were adjusted for energy, age, gender, overweight/obesity, 
income, and supplement use. We found differences in nutrients and food groups by 
WG group: there was a significant linear trend across groups of increasing WG 
for increased fiber (children and adults), vitamin B6 (children), thiamin 
(adults), potassium (children and adults), zinc (adults), calcium (children and 
adults), iron (children and adults), magnesium (children and adults), fruit 
(adults), and legumes, nuts and seeds (adults); and decreased total fat 
(adults), saturated fat (adults), folate (children and adults), refined grains 
(adults and children), and meat and poultry (adults) intake. We found that there 
were no differences in total sugar or sodium intake across WG intake groups. The 
high WG intake group for both children and adults had higher diet quality, 
measured by the Nutrient Rich Food Index 9.3, compared to non-WG eaters. The top 
2 food sources of WG across WG intake groups for children and adults were whole 
grain oat and high fiber breakfast cereal and whole grain and whole wheat bread. 
Other top sources of WG included rice, bread products, other breakfast cereals, 
salty snacks, cereal grains and flours, pasta, and sweet snacks. This research 
supports recommendations to increase WG foods intake as a means to improve diet 
quality of Canadians.

Strawberries are known to contain antioxidants, but the significance of 
ingesting antioxidant-rich fruits remains to be established. In order to 
determine whether the consumption of strawberries impacted measures of in vivo 
antioxidant capacity, frozen strawberries (250 g) were administered daily for 3 
weeks to 21 healthy female volunteers. Compliance was confirmed by quantitating 
pelargonidin-glucuronide, urolithin A-glucuronide, and 
2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3-[(2)H]furanone-glucuronide in plasma and urine by 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and antioxidant capacity in serum 
measured by the increase in lag phase of low-density lipoprotein after copper 
sulfate exposure, DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes, and activity of phase II 
enzymes. Among these measures lipid peroxidation lag time increased by 20% (P < 
.01), whereas other measures did not change significantly. The potent 
antioxidant defenses in humans make determination of changes due to dietary 
ingestion in healthy individuals difficult. In summary, daily consumption of 
strawberries resulted in a modest but significant increase in antioxidant 
capacity in a healthy population.

We determined whether nine common herbs (basil, chili, cilantro, dill, garlic, 
ginger, lemongrass, oregano, and parsley) and one herb mixture (Italian Herbs) 
retain the antioxidant capacity (AC) and content of phenolics and characteristic 
marker compounds during processing to dry and paste forms. Oregano exhibited the 
highest AC among the herbs tested in dry and fresh forms. Compared with fresh 
herbs, the AC in dry form was decreased in garlic, chili, dill, oregano and 
parsley and paste form of oregano and basil. With the exception of dried garlic 
and lemongrass in fresh and paste form, all herbs in dry, paste, and fresh form 
contained significant AC. The AC was correlated significantly to the total 
phenolic content in both dry and fresh form. However, there was no significant 
correlation between the AC and the concentration of chemical marker compounds. 
In summary, processed herbs contribute significant amounts of AC to the diet.

The Apocynum tea market primarily consists of two varieties, Apocynum venetum 
and Apocynum pictum, which exhibit significant differences in quality and market 
value. To elucidate these differences, this study systematically evaluated their 
nutritional composition, antioxidant capacity, and metabolic profiles. Key 
findings include: The total flavonoid and total phenolic content in tea 
infusions of A. venetum are higher than in A. pictum and their potential 
antioxdant activety was assessed. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis revealed 
1021 differential metabolites, with 560 more abundant in A. venetum tea and 461 
in A. pictum tea. These metabolites are primarily flavonoids, phenolic acids and 
alkaloids. KEGG pathway analysis highlighting enrichment in ""Flavone and 
flavonol biosynthesis"" and ""Biosynthesis of caffeic acid derivatives"". Network 
pharmacology analysis identified hypertension-related targets, such as CA2, 
ALOX5, and PTGS, supporting the cardiovascular benefits of A. venetum tea. These 
findings offering valuable insights for its commercial and therapeutic 
applications.

The phenolic profile of strawberry fruits (Fragaria x ananassa Duch., Rosaceae) 
was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array 
detection. A peak displaying retention time and UV spectral data identical to 
those of phloridzin (phloretin 2'-O-beta-d-glucoside), a dihydrochalcone 
glucoside so far considered characteristic of apples, was monitored. For further 
characterization, crude extracts of strawberries were purified on polyamide, and 
the target compound was isolated by preparative and analytical HPLC. Structure 
elucidation was performed on the basis of APCI- and ESI-MS in the negative ion 
mode as well as by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy using authentic phloridzin for 
comparison. The d-configuration of the sugar moiety was established by HPLC 
analysis of the corresponding acyclic 
1-deoxy-1-(N-acetyl-alpha-methylbenzylamino)alditol acetate. Apart from its 
chemotaxonomic relevance, this first report on the occurrence of phloridzin in 
strawberries is of particular interest for the authenticity control of 
strawberry products such as juices, jams, and fruit preparations since 
phloridzin has so far been used for the detection of fraudulent admixtures.

The flavonoids, naringin and naringenin and the furanocoumarin, bergapten 
(5-methoxypsoralen), were detected in some fresh grapefruit and commercial 
grapefruit juices but were not detected in other fruit juices tested (orange; 
orange with apple base; dark grape; orange and mango with apple base; orange, 
peach, passion fruit juice). The contents of these three grapefruit constituents 
in commercial juice and fresh grapefruit varied from brand to brand and also 
from lot to lot. Juice was prepared from the fresh fruit via different methods 
(by hand, squeezer or blender). The naringin content, after hand-squeeze, ranged 
from 115 to 384 mg/l. With hand-squeeze juice production, bergapten was not 
detected (less than 0.5 mg/l) in two varieties of grapefruit, and naringenin was 
usually not in detectable levels (less than 2 mg/l) in three varieties. All 
three constituents were present in New Zealand grapefruit preparations 
(including juice by hand-squeeze) and different lots showed variation in content 
(1.5-, 2.3- and 4.7-fold for naringin, naringenin and bergapten, respectively). 
Differences in the concentrations of these three constituents, which have 
potential for drug interaction, may contribute to the variability in 
pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 drugs and some contradictory results of drug 
interaction studies with grapefruit juice.

Oral inflammation and the immune response are distinct but related processes 
where Linum usitatissimum L., fam. Linaceae represents a possible use for 
localized relief. Oral lichen planus (OLP) is an oral potentially malignant 
disorder (OPMD) with an inflammatory background that mainly affects post- and 
peri-menopausal women. The presented methodology was threefold. Firstly, the 
plant extracts were made from flaxseeds of selected cultivars (Szafir [SZ] and 
Jantarol [JA]) containing plant lignans. In silico docking affinity was 
performed to verify the beta and alpha estrogen receptors of keratinocytes' (ERα 
and ERβ) affinity for lignans from the plant extracts. Lastly, tests using 
living keratinocyte cell lines were performed. Adding the studied extracts from 
two cultivars of flaxseed-JA and SZ (10 µg/mL) reduced lipopolysaccharides 
(LPS)-induced cell inflammation markers levels of COX-2 and IL-6. The effect of 
JA was more pronounced than that of SZ, with statistical significance (p < 
0.05). A high in silico affinity was provided during secoisolariciresinol 
diglucoside (SDG) docking to ERα and ERβ. Flaxseed's action could be based on 
the docking affinity of its major components to the estrogen receptors and the 
overall concentration of the elements of the extracts.

Gallic acid is one of the main phenolic components of black tea. The objective 
of this study was to identify urinary gallic acid metabolites with potential for 
use as markers of black tea intake. In an initial study, nine compounds, 
assessed by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, were found to increase 
in concentration in urine after 3 cups of black tea over 3 h. A subsequent study 
employed a controlled crossover design in which 10 subjects consumed 5 cups per 
day of black tea or water for 4 weeks in random order. Twenty-four hour urine 
samples were collected at the end of each period. Of the 9 candidate compounds 
identified in the initial study, only 3 were present at higher concentrations in 
urine of all 10 subjects during tea-drinking in comparison to water-drinking 
periods. These compounds were identified as 4-O-methylgallic acid, 
3-O-methylgallic acid, and 3, 4-O-dimethylgallic acid, all methyl ether 
derivatives of gallic acid. It is suggested that these compounds have the 
potential to be used as markers of black tea intake.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Polyphenols are plant secondary metabolites with a large 
variability in their chemical structure and dietary occurrence that have been 
associated with some protective effects against several chronic diseases. To 
date, limited data exist on intake of polyphenols in populations. The current 
cross-sectional analysis aimed at estimating dietary intakes of all currently 
known individual polyphenols and total intake per class and subclass, and to 
identify their main food sources in the European Prospective Investigation into 
Cancer and Nutrition cohort.
METHODS: Dietary data at baseline were collected using a standardized 24-h 
dietary recall software administered to 36,037 adult subjects. Dietary data were 
linked with Phenol-Explorer, a database with data on 502 individual polyphenols 
in 452 foods and data on polyphenol losses due to cooking and food processing.
RESULTS: Mean total polyphenol intake was the highest in Aarhus-Denmark 
(1786 mg/day in men and 1626 mg/day in women) and the lowest in Greece 
(744 mg/day in men and 584 mg/day in women). When dividing the subjects into 
three regions, the highest intake of total polyphenols was observed in the UK 
health-conscious group, followed by non-Mediterranean (non-MED) and MED 
countries. The main polyphenol contributors were phenolic acids (52.5-56.9 %), 
except in men from MED countries and in the UK health-conscious group where they 
were flavonoids (49.1-61.7 %). Coffee, tea, and fruits were the most important 
food sources of total polyphenols. A total of 437 different individual 
polyphenols were consumed, including 94 consumed at a level >1 mg/day. The most 
abundant ones were the caffeoylquinic acids and the proanthocyanidin oligomers 
and polymers.
CONCLUSION: This study describes the large number of dietary individual 
polyphenols consumed and the high variability of their intakes between European 
populations, particularly between MED and non-MED countries.

The aim of this study was to determine the phytochemicals and antioxidant 
activity in oat-buckwheat doughs and cookies with the addition of ten selected 
spices or herbs (2 g/100 g flours weight basis). The used spices and herbs, as 
was expected, showed a wide range of bioactive molecules, namely phenolic acids 
and flavonoids, and they are a rich source of components with antioxidant 
potential. All analysed oat-buckwheat dough showed higher antioxidant activity 
potential and higher total phenolic content (TPC) compared to cookies. The 
highest TPC was found in clove, both dough and cookies, with its addition 
showing the highest ferric reducing antioxidant power. Generally, cookies with 
the addition of spice/herbs showed higher phytochemical contents and antioxidant 
activity compared to oat-buckwheat cookies without the condiment. The technology 
of obtaining confectionery products, like oat-buckwheat cookies, that will favor 
the protection of bioactive compounds should still be improved.

There is considerable interest in coloured fruits and berries as sources of 
biologically active anthocyanins. To examine the relationship between the oral 
dose and the amount excreted for anthocyanins from a food source across a 
physiological range of doses, volunteers were fed, in random order, four 
portions (100-400 g) of fresh strawberries as part of a standard breakfast. 
Urine was collected at 2 h intervals up to 8 h, and for the period 8-24 h. Fresh 
strawberries contained pelargonidin-3-glucoside as the major anthocyanin with 
smaller amounts of cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside. 
Anthocyanins were detected in the urine of all volunteers for all doses, 
predominantly as pelargonidin glucuronide and sulphate metabolites. There was a 
strong, linear relationship between oral dose and anthocyanin excretion 
(Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient = 0.692, p < 0.001, n = 40) 
which indicated that on an average, every additional unit of dose caused 0.0166 
units of excretion. Within individuals, dose -- excretion data fitted a linear 
regression model (median R(2) = 0.93). We conclude that strawberry anthocyanins 
are partially bioavailable in humans with a linear relationship between oral 
dose and urinary excretion for doses up to 400 g fresh fruit.

The effect of fruit maturation on changes in carotenoids, flavonoids, total 
soluble reducing equivalents, phenolic acids, ascorbic acid, and antioxidant 
activity (AOX) in different pepper types (Capsicum annuum, Capsicum frutescens, 
and Capsicum chinese) was determined. Generally, the concentration of these 
chemical constituents increased as the peppers reached maturity. Peppers 
contained high levels of L-ascorbic acid and carotenoids at maturity, 
contributing 124-338% of the RDA for vitamin C and 0.33-336 RE/100 g of 
provitamin A activity, respectively. Levels of phenolic acids, capxanthin, and 
zeaxanthin generally increased during maturation, whereas the level of lutein 
declined. Flavonoid concentrations varied greatly among the pepper types 
analyzed and were negatively correlated to AOX under the conditions of the 
beta-carotene-linoleic assay. Model systems were used to aid in understanding 
the relationship between flavonoids and AOX. Significant increases in AOX were 
observed in pepper juice models in response to increasing dilution factors and 
the presence of EDTA, indicating a pro-oxidant effect due to metal ions in the 
system. In vitro models demonstrated that increasing levels of flavonoids in 
combination with constant levels of caffeic and ascorbic acid gave a resultant 
AOX that was either additive of the two compounds or competitive in their 
ability to scavenge peroxyl radicals. The model systems were in good agreement 
with the chemical composition of the pepper cultivars and reflected the 
interactions affecting AOX. More research is needed to understand the complex 
interactions that occur among various antioxidants present in pepper extracts.

Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of 11 commercial cultivars and 
15 advanced breeding lines of spinach were determined over two growing seasons 
known to vary in biotic and abiotic stresses. Flavonoid composition and content 
of fall-grown commercial cultivars and advanced breeding lines were also 
determined. Over-winter spinach, which was planted in late fall and harvested in 
the spring, had much higher levels of total phenolics and antioxidant capacity 
than spinach planted in early fall and harvested in late fall, indicating that 
growing conditions, as well as biotic and abiotic stresses, influenced phenolic 
metabolism. Genotype also appeared to play an important role in affecting 
phenolic metabolism and antioxidant capacity in spinach. Advanced breeding lines 
of spinach, which show increased disease resistance, had higher levels of total 
phenolics, individual and total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity than 
commercial cultivars. Our results indicate that plant breeders can select for 
increased phenolic content to increase antioxidant capacity in spinach 
cultivars, or the crops can be grown in different seasons or under certain 
stress conditions to elevate levels of antioxidants.

Fresh blueberries were processed into sugar and sugar-free jams and stored for 6 
months at 4 and 25 degrees C. The jams were analyzed immediately after 
processing and over 6 months of storage for polyphenolic content, percent 
polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity. Processing resulted in losses of 
anthocyanins, procyanidins, chlorogenic acid, and ORAC in both jam types, but 
flavonols were well retained. Marked losses of anthocyanins and procyanidins 
occurred over 6 months of storage and were accompanied by increased polymeric 
color values. Chlorogenic acid levels also declined during storage, but 
flavonols and ORAC changed little. Jams stored at 4 degrees C retained higher 
levels of anthocyanins, procyanidins, and ORAC and had lower polymeric color 
values than jams stored at 25 degrees C. Sugar-free jams retained higher levels 
of anthocyanins and had lower polymeric color values than sugar jams late during 
storage. Blueberry jams should be refrigerated to better retain polyphenolics 
and antioxidant capacity.

Many different approaches for the analysis of these compounds have been published, which has led to ambiguous results that are difficult to compare. In order to explain the controversial data reported in the literature, extraction techniques (solid‐phase extraction, SPE, and liquid‐liquid extraction, LLE), methods of analysis (HPLC and colorimetric assay) and quantification methods have been re‐investigated with genuine olive oil phenols. The optimized LLE system led to high recovery of the nine major olive oil phenolics (93%) and, in addition, was at least as good as the SPE technique in view of costs, solvent and sample consumption, and analysis time. SPE was shown to be problematic  because of the selectivity towards the individual phenolics, particularly the aglycone‐type ones. The proposed LLE/HPLC method was compared with the traditional colorimetric assay (Folin‐Ciocalteu method) by analyzing 23 samples of virgin olive oils. A strong correlation between both methods has been found, suggesting that the colorimetric assay is reasonably valid for a rough prediction of the total phenolic content. In the literature, the level of phenolics is expressed in several different units (reference compound equivalents in case of colorimetric measurements and ppm in HPLC measurements). As these units can differ in orders of  magnitude, it is necessary to convert the data to a common base before comparing or combining them.</jats:p>"

Several recent reports have been published indicating that the antioxidant 
activity of olive oil and tea leaves is not stable over product shelf lives of 
about one year. We have measured the antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, 
flavan-3-ols monomers, and procyanidin levels in milk and dark chocolate, in 
cocoa powder, and in cocoa beans. Results show that for the cocoa products 
studied, antioxidant activity, and flavan-3-ol levels are stable over typical 
shelf lives of one year under controlled storage and over 2 years in ambient 
storage in the laboratory. We also show that 80 year old cocoa powder and 116 
year old cocoa beans still show very high levels of antioxidant activity and 
flavan-3-ol content.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of consumption of fermented and unfermented 
soy products on excretion of urinary isoflavonoid phytoestrogens and lignans in 
healthy men.
DESIGN: A randomized, crossover trial consisting of two 9-day feeding periods 
following 5 days of baseline data collection.
SUBJECTS: Healthy men, aged 20 to 40 years, were recruited from the University 
of Minnesota Twin Cities community. Of the 22 subjects who began the study, 17 
completed all feeding periods.
INTERVENTIONS: Fermented soy product (112 g tempeh) or unfermented soy (125 g 
soybean pieces) was consumed during each controlled feeding period.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Urine samples collected while subjects consumed their 
habitual diets and on the last 3 days of each feeding period were analyzed for 
isoflavonoid and lignan content by isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED: Comparisons of isoflavonoid and lignan excretion 
were analyzed using the general linear model procedure. Orthogonal contrasts 
were used to determine treatment differences of interest.
RESULTS: Urinary excretion of isoflavonoids (equol, O-desmethylangolensin 
[O-DMA], daidzein, genistein) was higher and excretion of lignans (enterodiol, 
enterolactone) was lower when subjects consumed soy-supplemented diets than when 
they consumed their habitual diets (P < .05). Urinary isoflavonoid excretion and 
lignan excretion were similar when subjects consumed tempeh and soybean pieces 
diets; however, recovery of daidzein and genistein was significantly higher when 
subjects consumed the tempeh diet than when they consumed the soybean pieces 
diet (P < .002). When fed soy, 5 of 17 subjects excreted high amounts of equol. 
These five subjects tended to excrete less O-DMA and daidzein than the 12 
subjects who excreted low amounts of equol (P < .06).
CONCLUSIONS: Fermentation of soy decreased the isoflavone content of the product 
fed but increased the urinary isoflavonoid recovery. This finding suggests that 
fermentation increases availability of isoflavones in soy.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of vegetable, fruit, and legume consumption on 
urinary isoflavonoid phytoestrogen and lignan excretion.
DESIGN: After 4 days of data collection, during which subjects consumed their 
habitual diets, subjects were randomly placed on four 9-day controlled 
experimental diets with each subject receiving each diet in a random order.
SUBJECTS: Seven men and three women, aged 20 to 35 years, were recruited from 
the University of Minnesota Twin Cities community.
INTERVENTIONS: All subjects consumed four experimental diets in an assigned 
random order: a controlled basal diet, a legume/allium diet (containing garbanzo 
beans, garlic, and onions), and diets low or high in vegetables and fruits 
(containing apples, pears, potatoes, and carrots).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Urine samples that were collected while subjects consumed 
their habitual diets and during the last 3 days of each feeding period were 
analyzed for isoflavonoid and lignan content using isotope dilution gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED: The effect of vegetable and fruit intake on 
urinary isoflavonoid and lignan excretion was analyzed using the general linear 
model procedure. Post hoc comparisons were made using Duncan's multiple range 
test.
RESULTS: Subjects excreted more of the lignan enterodiol on the high 
vegetable/fruit diet compared with the basal and legume/allium diets (P = .03); 
more of the isoflavonoids O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA), genistein, and sum of 
isoflavonoids on the legume/allium diet compared with the other controlled diets 
(P < .05); and more of the isoflavan equol on the basal and legume/allium diets 
compared with the high vegetable/fruit diet (P < .01). Subjects who excreted 
higher levels of equol on the basal and legume/allium diets also consumed more 
of the milk-based pudding provided as part of the controlled diets.
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary lignan and isoflavonoid excretion changed in response to 
alterations in vegetable, fruit, and legume intake under controlled dietary 
conditions.

The study focused on the effects of processing and storage on the stability of 
flaxseed-derived secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) added to various bakery 
products. The SDG concentration of doughs, baked rye breads, graham buns, and 
muffins was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array 
detection; the baked products were analyzed immediately after baking and upon 
storage at room temperature for 1 week and at -25 degrees C for 1 and 2 months, 
respectively. Added SDG was found to withstand normal baking temperatures in all 
bakery products. SDG also was a relatively stable compound during storage. 
Similarly, the content of SDG in flax buns containing fat-free flaxseed meal was 
unaffected by storage. We conclude that cereal-based bakery products can be 
supplemented with flaxseed-derived SDG.

Peanut and its derivatives, especially peanut butter, are extensively consumed 
in many countries, mainly in the United States, which is also the major exporter 
of these products. trans-Resveratrol is present in peanuts, and recently this 
compound has been quantified in peanut butter. It is well-known that there are 
beneficial effects of trans-resveratrol and its glucoside, the piceid, in 
health. The absorption of trans-resveratrol has been proven in animals, and 
certain studies show that the absorption of some phenols is enhanced by 
conjugation with glucose, so that it could be possible that trans-piceid would 
be more absorbed than its aglycon (trans-resveratrol). In our work, we have 
identified the presence of trans-piceid in peanut butter with a new method to 
quantify trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid (3-beta-glucose of 
trans-resveratrol). This fact is very interesting because the glucosilated form 
could be more easily absorbed by the intestinal gut; in this way trans-piceid 
would exercise its beneficial function more efficiently than trans-resveratrol. 
To our knowledge, this is the first time that trans-piceid has been quantified 
in peanut butter. Resveratrol and piceid contents in natural peanut butters were 
found to be significantly higher than those in blended peanut butters.

We previously showed that nasunin, acylated anthocyanins in eggplant peel, 
comprises two isomers, cis-nasunin and trans-nasunin. In this study, 
gastrointestinal absorption of cis- and trans-nasunins was studied in rats. 
Orally administered nasunins were quickly absorbed in their original acylated 
forms and maximally appeared in blood plasma after 15 min. When the maximum 
plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration curve were 
normalized by orally administered dose (micromoles per kilogram), there was no 
significant difference in the uptake efficiency between two isomers and both 
exhibited a plasma level almost identical to that of delphinidin 
3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside. However, metabolites such as 4'-O-methyl analogues 
and extended glucuronides which were observed for delphinidin 
3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside metabolisms 
were not detected in urine or blood plasma. Moreover, deacylated and glycolytic 
products of nasunins such as delphinidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside or 
delphinidin (aglycone) were also not detected in blood plasma even after oral 
administration for 8 h. These results indicated that nasunins were absorbed in 
their original acylated forms and exhibit a bioavailability almost identical to 
that of nonacylated anthocyanins.

We previously determined that five rather hydrophobic metabolites appeared in 
blood plasma after oral administration of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 
but a group of hydrophilic metabolites still remained unidentified. In the 
present study, 12 hydrophilic metabolites found were collected from urine and 
plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and then 
analyzed by tandem MS spectrometry. From the MS spectra, four metabolites out of 
12 were assigned as glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and six 
out of 12 were glucuronides of the primary metabolites of cyanidin 
3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside). 
Extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and O-methyl 
cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside showed their maximum plasma concentrations 
at 15 and 60 min (or 30 min) after oral administration, respectively. Their 
maximum plasma concentrations ranged from 15 to 70 nM. From the profile of 
urinary-excreted anthocyanins after intravenous administration, it was deduced 
that extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and O-methyl 
cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside were mainly produced in the liver rather 
than by intestinal flora. The area under the plasma concentration curve was 0.25 
micromol min/L for extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside 
and 0.14 micromol min/L for O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 
respectively, when evaluated as cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside equivalent, 
indicating that extended glucuronidation is a critical pathway in cyanidin 
3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside metabolism in rats.

OBJECTIVE: Dry eye, a chronic disease of lachrymal fluid and corneo-conjunctival 
epithelium, could significantly impact visual function, affects quality of life 
and work productivity. Beside several conventional treatments, nutritional 
supplements based on bilberry extract have been identified as effective 
contributors to eye health. Here, we aim at investigating the bioavailability of 
a standardized bilberry extract, its ability to alleviate dry eye symptoms and 
its antioxidant potential.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Either bilberry dried standardized extract derived from 
Vaccinium myrtillus L. fresh frozen fruits (Mirtoselect®) or a highly purified 
anthocyanin-rich extract, devoid of the non anthocyanin component and supported 
on maltodextrins, were each orally administrated to 5 male rats. Blood samples 
were collected at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 minutes after treatment, 
processed and analyzed by UV spectrophotometric method. In a parallel analysis, 
22 otherwise healthy subjects suffering from dry eye symptoms were enrolled 
randomly assigned to receive the more bioavailable bilberry extract or placebo. 
Ophthalmological and clinical examinations including Schirmer's test, pupil 
constriction, diacron-reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs) test and biological 
antioxidant potential (BAP) test were performed at inclusion and after the 
4-week study period.
RESULTS: The area under the curve of plasmatic levels of anthocyanosides in rats 
resulted 202.34±24.23 µg·min/ml for Mirtoselect® and 130.93±4.93 µg·min/ml for 
the highly purified anthocyanin-rich bilberry extract, notwithstanding the fact 
that the highly purified anthocyanin-rich extract group received an anthocyanins 
dosage much higher than the Mirtoselect® group (354 mg/Kg in anthocyanosides vs. 
136 mg/Kg in anthocyanosides). 21 subjects, 11 subjects in the bilberry extract 
(Mirtoselect®) group and 10 subjects in the placebo group completed the clinical 
study. Schirmer's test values indicating the volume of tear secretion were 
significantly improved in the bilberry extract group (p=0.019), whereas no 
significant changes were observed in the placebo group. A subset analysis 
revealed that Mirtoselect® could be more effective in subjects with higher 
tendency of dry eye. In terms of antioxidant potential, the bilberry extract 
produced significant improvement of BAP (p=0.003) and an increase of modified 
BAP/d-ROMs ratio, an indicator of overall balance between antioxidant potential 
and oxidative stress.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that natural, standardized bilberry extract 
(Mirtoselect®) is a natural more bioavailable delivery form anthocyanins, 
suggesting a strong matrix effect exerted by the non-anthocyanin component. 
Furthermore, it can improve tear secretion and plasmatic antioxidant potential 
in subjects suffering from DED symptoms.

Total and free phenolic contents of 16 commonly consumed fruits (comprising 9 
apples, 4 pears, and one each of peach, plum, and kiwi fruit cultivars) were 
measured by Folin-Ciocalteu assay. Total phenol contents varied from 272 to 475 
mg of CtE/100 g of fresh weight. Of the apple cultivars studied, Braeburn and 
Empire had the highest and lowest total phenol content, respectively. The apple 
cultivars ranked in the following decreasing order: Braeburn > Red Delicious > 
Crisp Pink > Granny Smith > Royal Gala > Bramley > Golden Delicious > Fuji > 
Empire. Among pear cultivars, the order was Forelle > Taylor's > Peckham's > 
Conference. Peach and plum equally had high contents. The percentage of 
conjugated phenolics ranged between 3 (Red Delicious) and 77% (Empire) of the 
total phenols. Comparison of different cultivars of the same fruit and between 
different fruits showed broad variations in both phenolic content and in vitro 
antioxidant activity; a weak correlation (R(2) = 0.58) was observed between the 
phenolic content of the fruits and the total antioxidant activity, as estimated 
by the FRAP assay. The calculated dietary intake of total, free, and conjugated 
phenols from average per capita consumption of apples and pears in different 
regions of the U.K. varied between 104-126, 53-64, and 51-62 mg of CtE/day, 
respectively.

BACKGROUND: Dry beans and chickpeas are nutritionally valuable legumes widely 
consumed worldwide. This study examines the impact of oven roasting (110 °C for 
70 min) on the phytochemical, antioxidant, fatty acid and saponin profiles of 12 
pulses, including 11 common beans and 1 chickpea.
RESULTS: Roasting significantly affected the phytochemical composition and 
antinutritional factors with distinct variations among samples. Cranberry bean 
CRAN-1 exhibited the highest total phenolic content in raw samples (19.12 g kg-1 
GAE g-1 DW), which decreased by 6.79% post-roasting. Pigmented beans including 
dark red kidney and CRAN-2 showed strong antioxidant activities pre-roasting 
(DPPH scavenging: 73.94% and 50.16%, respectively). CRAN-2 also had the highest 
anthocyanin content (0.057 to 0.036 g kg-1 DW) among pigmented cultivars, which 
decreased slightly after roasting. Non-extractable polymeric proanthocyanins 
remained stable, while saponin content significantly decreased (up to 77% in 
some cultivars), suggesting improved flavor. Stigmasterol and β-sitosterol were 
the predominant phytosterols with enhanced availability after roasting. Fatty 
acid analysis revealed that saturated fatty acids are predominant, ranging from 
54.7% (Manteca) to 70% (Great Northern), while the fatty acid composition was 
similar across all cultivars.
CONCLUSION: These findings underscore that roasting under mild controlled 
conditions retains and improves key bioactive compounds in common bean flours. 
Pigmented varieties, in particular, offer superior antioxidant and phytochemical 
properties. This research provides a foundation for incorporating roasted pulses 
into functional formulations with both dietary and industrial applications. ©

Fresh aerial parts of different chicory varieties: green chicory (c.v. 
""Catalogna""), two red chicory varieties (""radicchio rosso di Chioggia"" and 
""radicchio rosso di Treviso""), and Witloof or Belgian endive were analyzed by 
HPLC/DAD/MS. The chromatographic fingerprint was diagnostic for each variety. A 
monocaffeoyl tartaric acid, chlorogenic acid, and chicoric acid were detected in 
all the varieties, while cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-(6'' malonyl) 
glucoside, and cyanidin 3-O-(6'' malonyl) glucoside were the main phenolic 
compounds in the red varieties. The flavonoidic compounds, quercetin 
3-O-glucuronide and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide, were absent in the Witloof sample. 
The phenolic compounds from total leaves were the same as those obtained from 
only the colored parts; nevertheless, the total amount was remarkably lower with 
a decrease of up to 80% for Belgian endive. Chemical stability at high 
temperature was observed for the phenolic fraction from the green variety after 
decoction at 100 degrees C for 30 min.

Background and Objectives: Bacterial urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most 
common ailment affecting all age groups in males and females. The commercial 
antibiotics usage augments antibiotics resistance and creates higher recurrence 
rates of such communal infections. Hence, this study is aimed at investigating 
the antibacterial and antioxidant potentials of 15 common spices against 11 
UTI-causing bacterial pathogens. Materials and Methods: The antioxidant 
potential of the methanolic extracts was analyzed as contents of total phenols 
and flavonoids; radical scavenging, total reducing power, the ferric reducing 
power assay. Urinary pathogens were subjected to spice extracts to investigate 
antibacterial assays. Results: Preliminary phytochemical study of spices was 
performed to find those containing alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, 
and steroids that can be recognized for their noteworthy bactericidal effects. 
The outcome of the antioxidative potential from the four methods demonstrated 
the sequence of potent antioxidant activity: Acorus calamus > Alpinia galanga > 
Armoracia rusticana > Capparis spinosa > Aframomum melegueta. The total 
polyphenols and flavonoids in the studied species positively correlated with 
their antioxidant properties. The four most effective spices (A. calamus, A. 
galanga, A. rusticana, and C. spinosa) had a zone of inhibition of at least 22 
mm. A. calamus, A. melegueta, and C. spinosa had the lowest minimum inhibitory 
concentration (MIC) value against Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus 
and Proteus mirabilis. All 15 spices had the lowest minimum bactericidal 
concentration (MBC) value against most of the pathogenic bacteria. Conclusion: 
The four highly potent and unique spices noted for the in vitro control of 
UTI-causing pathogens could be pursued further in the development of 
complementary and alternative medicine against UTI-causing pathogens.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Paederia foetida has long been utilized in 
traditional medicine, necessitating comprehensive safety assessments and precise 
dosage recommendations to avert potential adverse effects in human use.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify and characterize the key phytocompounds 
in P. foetida, evaluate their antioxidant and biological activities, and assess 
their safety through acute and sub-acute toxicity studies in a rat model, 
thereby establishing a scientific basis linking chemical composition, 
therapeutic potential, and safety.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The qualitative profiling, total phenolic, flavonoid 
content, and antioxidant activity of aqueous (PFAE), ethanol (PFEE), and 
methanol (PFME) extracts were evaluated using established protocols and the PASS 
tool employed to predict their therapeutic potential. High-resolution liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (HR-LC-MS) was employed for the identification 
and detailed characterization of bioactive constituents in the whole plant 
methanolic extract (PFME) of P. foetida based on their superior antioxidant 
activity. Polyphenolic compounds were quantified using high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC). Acute (control, 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg, 14 days) and 
sub-acute (control, 500, 1000 and 1500 mg/kg, 28 days) toxicity studies were 
conducted on PFME at the selected doses in male and female Wistar albino rats, 
incorporating clinical observations, mortality tracking, hematological, 
biochemical, and histopathological evaluations.
RESULTS: PFME exhibited the highest concentration of total phenols (3761.68 mg 
GAE/g) and flavonoids (2336.54 mg RuE/g) among the extracts analyzed. HR-LC-MS 
of PFME identified 36 polyphenolic compounds, with chlorogenic acid 
(221.84 mg/g), isoquercetin (178.47 mg/g), rutin (169.88 mg/g), scopoletin 
(148.99 mg/g), quinic acid (111.31 mg/g), and quercetin (71.19 mg/g) being the 
most abundant. Predictive analysis with the PASS tool revealed strong 
antioxidant, free radical scavenging, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic 
activities of PFME. PFME demonstrated superior antioxidant potency relative to 
PFEE and PFAE in assays for DPPH, ABTS•+, superoxide radicals, and reducing 
power. Acute toxicity studies revealed no mortality at any dose level, with no 
significant alterations in hematological, biochemical, or histopathological 
profiles, confirming PFME's high safety margin with an LD50 exceeding 2000 mg/kg 
in both male and female rats. Sub-acute toxicity studies showed no mortality at 
doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg, with no significant changes in hematological, 
biochemical, or histological profiles of lung, brain, kidney, or liver tissues. 
However, at 1500 mg/kg, significant changes were observed in hematological and 
serum biochemical profiles, with histopathological abnormalities in liver and 
kidney tissues of male and female rats. Female rats showed a higher incidence of 
histological abnormalities.
CONCLUSION: The therapeutic effects of P. foetida are closely linked to its high 
levels of polyphenols, especially chlorogenic acid, isoquercetin, rutin, 
scopoletin, quinic acid, and quercetin. These compounds are very important for 
its strong antioxidant and protective effects. PFME showed superior antioxidant 
and free radical scavenging activity than the PFEE and PFAE. PFME exhibited a 
favorable safety profile, with no adverse effects detected at doses up to 
2000 mg/kg in acute toxicity studies and 1000 mg/kg/day in sub-acute toxicity 
studies, thereby establishing this dosage as the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect 
Level (NOAEL). These findings not only validate the traditional utilization of 
P. foetida but also establish a scientific foundation for its ongoing research 
and prospective advancement into safe and efficacious medicinal product 
formulations.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the absorption of a citrus flavonoid, 
naringin, as its glycosylated form. Six healthy volunteers (three males and 
three females) were studied. After a single oral administeration of 500 mg of 
naringin, intact naringin was isolated from 2-4 h urine. Isolated naringin was 
identified by the LC/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), MS/MS, 
and MS/MS/MS techniques. The cumulative urinary excretion of naringin and its 
metabolites (naringenin and naringenin glucuronides) was determined by HPLC for 
0-24 h. Approximately 0.02% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as 
unchanged naringin, whereas urinary recoveries of naringenin and naringenin 
glucuronides were approximately 0.4 and 3.6% of the administered dose, 
respectively. It was concluded that trace amounts of orally administered 
naringin can be absorbed as the glycoside. However, it is not clear whether the 
glycoside is cleaved before or after absorption to generate naringenin.

Vegetables comprise a significant portion of our daily diet with their high 
content in nutrients including fiber, vitamins, minerals, as well as phenolic 
compounds. Vegetable consumption has been shown to be positively associated with 
the prevention of several degenerative diseases thanks to their bioactive 
compounds. Accordingly, five selected vegetables, namely, red chicory, red 
onion, eggplant, purple sweet potato, and black carrot were thoroughly assessed 
for their phenolic content in this study. For this purpose, the total phenolic 
and flavonoid content of these five vegetables and their antioxidant activities 
that are based on three common methods ABTS radical cation decolorization assay 
(ABTS), Cupric Ion Reducing Antioxidant Capacity (CUPRAC), and DPPH scavenging 
activity assay were determined. Additionally, HPLC-PDA/Electrospray ionization 
coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-PDA/-ESI+-MS)-based identification and 
quantification of the members belonging to polyphenols present in each vegetable 
were determined. Statistical correlations between antioxidant activities and the 
specific type of phenolic compounds, such as anthocyanins, flavonoids, 
anthocyanins, and phenolic acids were further elucidated. Phenolic acids 
(chlorogenic and syringic acids) were found to be the most abundant compounds 
that are present in all samples. Among the anthocyanins, cyaniding derivatives 
were present in all vegetables. In terms of their antioxidant activities, the 
analyzed vegetables were ranked as red chicory > purple sweet potato > black 
carrot > eggplant > red onion, in descending order. Superior antioxidant 
activities exhibited by red chicory and purple sweet potato were attributed to 
the high content of phenolic compounds, especially flavonols 
(quercetin-3,4-O-diglucoside) in red chicory and anthocyanins 
(peonidin-3-caffeoyl p-hydroxybenzoylsophoroside-5-glucoside) in purple sweet 
potato.

Sterol ferulate, free sterol, and 5-alk(en)ylresorcinol constituents of wheat, 
rye, and corn bran oils were studied. Among the sterol ferulates, one novel 
compound, 24-methylenecholestanol ferulate (7), along with six known compounds, 
namely, 24-methylcholestanol ferulate (1), 24-methylcholesterol ferulate (2), 
2-methyllathosterol ferulate (3), stigmastanol ferulate (4), sitosterol ferulate 
(5), and schottenol ferulate (6), were isolated and characterized. Five known 
free sterols, namely, 24-methylcholesterol (8), stigmastanol (9), sitosterol 
(10), schottenol (11), and stigmasterol (12), were isolated and identified. 
5-Alk(en)ylresorcinols were found in wheat and rye bran oils but not in corn 
bran oil. Of these, one new compound, 5-n-(2'-oxo-14'-Z-heneicosenyl) resorcinol 
(19), and seven known compounds, namely, 5-n-heptadecyl- (13), 5-n-nonadecyl- 
(14), 5-n-heneicosyl- (15), 5-n-tricosyl- (16), 5-n-pentacosyl- (17), 
5-n-(14'-Z-nonadecenyl)- (18), and 5-n-(2'-oxoheneicosyl)resorcinols (20), were 
isolated and characterized. These compounds were evaluated with respect to their 
inhibitory effects on the induction of Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) 
by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells, which is known to 
be a primary screening test for antitumor promoters. Four compounds, 1, 2, 4,

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of hot air convective drying 
(HACD), microwave vacuum drying (MWVD) and their combination (HACD+MWVD) on the 
drying kinetics, colour, total polyphenols, anthocyanins antioxidant capacity 
and texture of frozen/thawed blueberries. Drying resulted in reduction of total 
polyphenols content and antioxidant capacity (69 and 77%, respectively). The 
highest content of total polyphenols was noted after HACD at 90°C. Lower air 
temperature and prolonged exposure to oxygen resulted in greater degradation of 
polyphenols and antioxidant capacity. Drying processes caused a significant 
decrease (from 70 to 95%) in the content of anthocyanins. The highest content of 
anthocyanins and the strongest antioxidant capacity was found in blueberries 
dried using HACD at 90°C+MWVD. Among drying methods, HACD at 90°C+MWVD satisfied 
significant requirements for dried fruits i.e. short drying time and improved 
product quality.

Methods were developed for the analysis of natural antioxidants including 
phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beverages and plant extracts using gradient 
HPLC with multi-channel electrochemical coulometric detection. Suitability of 
various reversed-phase columns for this purpose was compared; pH and mobile 
phase gradients were optimized with respect to the separation selectivity and 
sensitivity of detection. Because of different target compounds in various 
sample types, the overlapping resolution maps and the normalized resolution 
product approaches described earlier were used to select optimum columns and 
gradients to suit the analysis of the individual sample types. The methods were 
applied to the analysis of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beer, wine, tea, 
and yacon extracts. 32 phenolic compounds were identified and determined, 
including derivatives of benzoic and cinnamic acids, flavones, and a few related 
glycosides. Eight-channel CoulArray detection offers high selectivity and 
sensitivity with limits of detection in the low microg L(-1) range, at least an 
order of magnitude lower than single-channel coulometric detection using the 
Coulochem detector. No special sample pretreatment is necessary and, because of 
the compatibility of the CoulArray detector with gradient elution, phenolic 
antioxidants of different polarities can be determined in a single run. In 
addition to the retention times, the ratios of the areas of the pre-dominant and 
post-dominant peaks to the area of the dominant peak can be used for improved 
identification of natural antioxidants.

Curcuminoids, including curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin, 
are vital for quality control in food, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceuticals. 
Conventional 1D 1H NMR can face challenges in spectral interpretation when 
dealing with overlapping signals and complex coupling patterns, especially in 
structurally similar compounds like curcuminoids. This study explores the use of 
selective homodecoupled 1D 1H NMR spectroscopy as a complementary technique to 
enhance spectral resolution and facilitate peak assignment in curcuminoid 
analysis. By collapsing multiplet structures such as doublets observed in the 
6.6- to 6.8-ppm region for vinylic protons into singlets, this method offers 
improved spectral clarity. Although absolute quantification still requires 
deconvolution, the approach aids in more straightforward relative integration 
and identification of components within curcuminoid mixtures from turmeric 
samples. The results demonstrate improved interpretability compared with 
conventional 1H NMR under similar conditions. Comparative analysis with HPLC 
showed excellent agreement, with standard deviations under 2% for most samples. 
The selective homodecoupled 1D 1H NMR method proved robust and reliable, 
offering an effective tool for profiling curcuminoids and potential application 
to other natural product mixtures.

In this study, five common buckwheats and nine tartary buckwheats grown at 
different locations were analyzed for the contents of rutin, quercetin, and 
amino acids by high-performance liquid chromatography and spectrophotometry. The 
rutin content was higher than quercetin in buckwheat seeds. Rutin content was in 
the range from 0.05 (0.05 g per 100 g dry seeds) to 1.35% of buckwheat seeds. 
Quercetin content varied from 0.01 to 0.17% and in some common buckwheats it was 
even difficult to detect. Comparatively, tartary buckwheat seeds contained more 
rutin and quercetin than common buckwheat seeds. Meanwhile, the bran has higher 
rutin content than the farina in tartary buckwheat seeds, with a respective 
content of 0.45 to 1.19% and 0.14 to 0.67%. It was found that amino acid 
contents were around 1.79 to 12.65% (farina) and 5.74 to 7.89% (bran) in common 
buckwheats, and 1.73 to 5.63% (farina) and 2.64 to 16.78% (bran) in tartary 
buckwheat seeds. The highest total rutin content was found to be 1.35% in 
tartary buckwheat seeds from Sichuan, China. The highest total amounts of amino 
acid were detected to be 20.13% in tartary buckwheat seeds from Changzhi, Shanxi 
Province (China). Our results suggested that food products made of 
whole-buckwheat flour are healthier than those made of fine white flour.

It has been shown that thermal processing of tomatoes and sweet corn results in 
increased antioxidant activities despite the loss of vitamin C. Until now, it is 
unclear whether this positive effect of thermal processing occurs with all crop 
produce. Therefore, analysis of a root vegetable (beets) and of a legume (green 
beans) was undertaken to address this question. Antioxidant activity of beets 
processed under typical commercial processing conditions remained constant 
despite an 8% loss of vitamin C, a 60% loss of color, and 30% loss of dietary 
folate. There was a slight but significant 5% increase in phenolic content of 
processed beets. In contrast, vitamin C and dietary folate content of green 
beans remained constant, whereas a 32% reduction in phenolic compounds occurred 
after typical commercial processing conditions. The antioxidant activity of 
green beans was reduced by 20%. These findings along with previous works suggest 
that the effects of thermal processing vary with the respective produce crop 
type. It also reinforces the concept that optimal health benefits may be 
achieved when a wide variety of plant foods (fruits, vegetables and whole 
grains) and preparation methods are incorporated into the diet.

The metabolic fate of the dietary isoflavones daidzein and genistein was 
investigated in human volunteers challenged with soya. Urinary diphenols, 
isolated by partition chromatography on Sephadex LH-20, were characterized and 
identified by profile capillary gas chromatography (GC) and electron ionization 
mass spectrometry (GC-EIMS) analysis of the trimethylsilyl ether (TMS) 
derivatives. Novel isoflavonic phytoestrogens found in the urine of volunteers 
were those of tetrahydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, 
6'-hydroxy-O-demethylangolesin and 2-dehydro-O-demethylangolensin. Other known 
diphenols identified were those of equal, dehydrodaidzein, O-demethylangolensin, 
daidzein, genistein, glycitein, and the lignan enterolactone. Two other urinary 
isomers with a fragmentation pattern closely resembling that of the persilylated 
TMS ethers of cis/trans-isomers of tetrahydrodaidzein, were characterized based 
on the elucidation of fragments associated with the loss of a non-phenolic-OTMS 
functional group in ring-C. These are fragments presented in the persilylated 
mass spectra of isoflavan-4-ols and isoflav-3-ene-4-ols, demonstrated here by a 
combination of simple and tandem mass spectrometry study of the deuterated 
persilylated TMS ethers of dihydrodaidzein. In a similar study we also present 
the data on the structural identification and fragment elucidation of the 
keto/enol tautomers of the TMS ether derivatives of the dihydro derivatives of 
daidzein and genistein, observed in the urine of volunteers and considered 
probable products of the derivatization process. Finally, the GC and GC-MS data 
of two unknown isoflavonoids and that of a lignan-like compound are presented 
together with those of dihydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, tetrahydrodaidzein and 
2-dehydro-O-demethylangolensin. The latter four were obtained here as products 
of small scale chemical synthesis in a preliminary study on the tentative 
identification of urinary isoflavonoids in human volunteers challenged with 
soya.

Flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) is a rich source of nutritive and bioactive 
compounds. The research evaluated the disparity in phytochemical profiles along 
with total and cellular antioxidant activities between oil and fiber flaxseeds. 
There were significant differences in total phenolics, total flavonoids and 
antioxidant activities among the six cultivars of fiber and oil flaxseed, 
respectively. Four phytochemical compounds including caffeic acid, p-coumaric 
acid and ferulic acid, and secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) were 
identified and quantified in the cultivars of oil and fiber flaxseed by HPLC 
analysis. Notably, the average of total phenolic and flavonoid contents, along 
with total antioxidant activities between fiber and oil flaxseeds were not 
different significantly; even the cellular antioxidant activity of fiber 
flaxseed was superior to oil flaxseed. These results suggest that fiber 
flaxseeds would be valuable candidates as functional products and dietary 
supplements production owing to the higher bioactive values as well as oil 
flaxseeds.

A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separation method with 
photo-diode array (PDA) and mass spectrometric (MS) detection was developed to 
determine and quantify flavonols, flavones, and flavanones in fruits, vegetables 
and beverages. The compounds were analysed as aglycones, obtained after acid 
hydrolysis of freeze-dried food material. Identification was based on retention 
time, UV and mass spectra by comparison with commercial standards, and the UV 
peak areas were used for quantitation of the flavonoid contents. Examples of 
HPLC-MS, analyses of orange pulp, tomato, and apple are presented. The method 
has been used to screen foods on the Danish market, and the contents of 
flavones, flavonols, and flavanones were measured.

A field experiment and two oxidation experiments in the laboratory were carried 
out. The content of the major anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-G) and 
cyanidin-3-sambubioside (Cy-3-Sa), in the fresh fruits from the 13 cultivars 
were from 361 to 1266 and from 269 to 656 mg/100 g, respectively. The two minor 
anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-sambubioside-5-glucoside (Cy-3-Sa-5-G) and 
cyanidin-3.5-diglucoside (Cy-3.5-dG), occurred in concentrations between 5 and 
47 mg/100 g. The content of ascorbic acid and quercetin in the fresh fruits of 
the cultivars varied from 6 to 25, and from 29 to 60 mg/100 g, respectively. 
Purging of the elderberry juice with N2 and/or addition of ascorbic acid reduced 
the oxidative degradation rate of the two major anthocyanins and quercetin. 
Ascorbic acid protected the anthocyanins, but not quercetin from oxidative 
degradation. Mixing of fruits with air during processing and even a low content 
of oxygen in the juice before tapping must be avoided by appropriate steps 
during processing. Improvement of the nutritional value of the elderberry juice 
and increased protection of anthocyanins against oxidative degradation may 
potentially be obtained by selection of cultivars with a high content of 
ascorbic acid.

Ethnobotanical reports from Latvia show that Tanacetum vulgare, Calluna 
vulgaris, Quercus robur, Artemisa absinthium, and Artemisia vulgaris contain 
phenolic compounds that have antioxidant properties, which can be beneficial in 
the treatment and prophylaxis of many diseases. The aim of this study was to 
characterize the phenolic compounds and antioxidant properties of these plants. 
Plant extracts were prepared using ethanol or acetone and then freeze-dried. 
Their total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total 
tannin content (TTC) were determined and characterized by HPLC. Their 
antioxidant properties were determined using a DPPH 
(2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging assay. C. vulgaris herb and 
T. vulgare leaf extracts contained the highest amounts of flavonoids, but the 
bark of Q. robur had mostly tannins and phenolic acids. A. absinthium and A. 
vulgaris had the lowest amounts of polyphenols. When compared using extraction 
solvents, all acetone extracts had more TPC, more TFC, and better antioxidant 
activity. All plants contained chlorogenic acid, which contributes to 
antioxidant properties. The analysed plant extracts could be used in future 
studies to develop medicinal products with antioxidant properties.

Yam bean (Pachyrhizus erosus L.) is an underutilized Mexican tuber valued for 
its dietary fiber but limited in polyphenols, reducing its functional potential. 
This study evaluated the effect of vacuum impregnation (VI) with mango seed 
polyphenolic extract on its in vitro colonic fermentation. Mango seed extract 
was obtained via ultrasound-assisted extraction and incorporated into yam bean 
slices through VI (150 mBar, 15 min), followed by dehydration and in vitro 
gastrointestinal digestion to isolate the indigestible fraction. Four treatments 
were tested: T1 (extract + vacuum), T2 (extract without vacuum), and two water 
controls (T3 and T4). Digested samples were fermented with pooled human fecal 
microbiota for 24 h under anaerobic conditions. T1 showed significantly higher 
total soluble phenols (6.30 ± 0.48 mg GAE/g at 3 h), antioxidant activity 
(5.94 ± 0.12 μmol TE/g at 6 h by DPPH), and pH reduction (4.59 ± 0.04 at 24 h), 
compared to T2 and controls. HPLC-DAD-MS identified 24 phenolic compounds and 
metabolites, with T1 showing greater abundance and earlier appearance of gallic 
acid, pentagalloyl glucose, ellagic acid, and urolithins A and C. GC-MS revealed 
that esters dominated early fermentation in T1, while fatty acids predominated 
after 12 h in all treatments. The higher metabolite diversity and concentration 
in T1 suggests a stronger interaction of polyphenols with the yam bean matrix 
via VI, enhancing microbial bioconversion. These results demonstrate that VI is 
a promising strategy for improving the functional properties of plant matrices 
using polyphenol-rich by-products, contributing to the development of functional 
foods aimed at intestinal health.

The increasing trend of diet-related chronic diseases has stimulated research 
into developing new food products and beverages with health-promoting potential. 
At the same time, new resources, including plant by-products, are currently 
being investigated as a sustainable source of bioactive compounds. In this 
context, the present study focused on the enrichment of apple juice with 
anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds by direct ultrasound-assisted 
extraction (UAE) from bilberry pomace. Response surface methodology combined 
with a Box-Behnken design was used to find the optimal extraction conditions for 
maximizing the total anthocyanin content (TAC), total phenolic content (TPC) and 
DPPH radical scavenging activity (RSA) in the enriched apple juices and to 
characterize their phenolic profile as influenced by the extraction temperature. 
UAE from 15% bilberry pomace during 15 min in apple juice at 80 °C resulted in 
the highest TAC (262.73 mg CGE/L), TPC (1700.91 mg GAE/L) and RSA (8.93 mmol 
Trolox/L) of the enriched apple juice. The chromatographic polyphenolic profile 
of the control and enriched juices showed that, besides anthocyanins, phenolic 
acids (chlorogenic, gallic, caffeic, 3-hydroxybenzoic, p-coumaric, ellagic and 
protocatechuic acids) and flavonoids (epigallocatechin and catechin) were 
extracted from the bilberry pomace directly in the apple juice, while the 
extraction temperature differently impacted the content of individual phenolic 
compounds.

Objectives: In this research study, we introduce a novel approach to develop an 
innovative nanocarrier system comprising gold nanoparticles (GNPs) loaded with 
doxorubicin (D) in combination with natural molecules, such as trans-resveratrol 
(R), piperine (P), and icariin (Ic), against human cervical cancer. The final 
objective is to improve the anticancer efficacy of doxorubicin on HeLa and CaSki 
cell lines. Methods: Resveratrol was also used for the synthesis of GNP_R1 
nanoparticles. Multi-functional GNPs loaded with D, R, P, and Ic (e.g., 
GNP_R1@D/R/P/Ic) were successfully prepared and fully characterized by SPR, TEM, 
HR-TEM, XRD, AFM, DLS, and zeta potential. They were investigated for in vitro 
stability in various biological media. The cytotoxicity activity was tested on 
HeLa and CaSki cell lines, using the MTT assay, for their applications as 
anticancer agents. Results: Our results demonstrate that the novel 
multi-functional GNPs (such as GNP_R1@D/R and GNP_R1@D/R/P/Ic) can effectively 
target the cervical cancer cells, improving the bioavailability of therapeutic 
agents and enhancing their cytotoxicity against cervical cancer cells. In vitro 
assessments demonstrated that the multi-functional GNPs exhibited improved 
stability and potential anticancer efficacy on human cervical cancer cells. 
Conclusions: The described strategy connects the benefits of biomolecules with 
functional nanoparticles toward the development of various GNP_R1@D/R/P/Ic 
nanocarriers for their applications as anticancer agents against human cervical 
cancer. This study provides compelling evidence that the innovative 
nanoparticles can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin against 
cervical cancer and offer a more advantageous alternative compared to 
doxorubicin monotherapy.

Fresh strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.), raspberries (Rubus idaeus 
Michx.), highbush blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum L.), and lowbush blueberries 
(Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton) were stored at 0, 10, 20, and 30 degrees C for 
up to 8 days to determine the effects of storage temperature on whole fruit 
antioxidant capacity (as measured by the oxygen radical absorbing capacity 
assay, Cao et al., Clin. Chem. 1995, 41, 1738-1744) and total phenolic, 
anthocyanin, and ascorbate content. The four fruit varied markedly in their 
total antioxidant capacity, and antioxidant capacity was strongly correlated 
with the content of total phenolics (0.83) and anthocyanins (0.90). The 
antioxidant capacity of the two blueberry species was about 3-fold higher than 
either strawberries or raspberries. However, there was an increase in the 
antioxidant capacity of strawberries and raspberries during storage at 
temperatures >0 degrees C, which was accompanied by increases in anthocyanins in 
strawberries and increases in anthocyanins and total phenolics in raspberries. 
Ascorbate content differed more than 5-fold among the four fruit species; on 
average, strawberries and raspberries had almost 4-times more ascorbate than 
highbush and lowbush blueberries. There were no ascorbate losses in strawberries 
or highbush blueberries during 8 days of storage at the various temperatures, 
but there were losses in the other two fruit species. Ascorbate made only a 
small contribution (0.4-9.4%) to the total antioxidant capacity of the fruit. 
The increase observed in antioxidant capacity through postharvest phenolic 
synthesis and metabolism suggested that commercially feasible technologies may 
be developed to enhance the health functionality of small fruit crops.

Olive oil and fruit samples from six cultivars sampled at four different 
maturity stages were discriminated into cultivars and maturity stages. The 
variables-volatile and phenolic compounds-that significantly (p < 0.01) 
discriminated cultivars and maturity stage groups were identified. Separation by 
stepwise linear discriminant analysis revealed that Manzanilla olive cultivar 
was separated from cultivars Leccino, Barnea, Mission, Corregiola, and Paragon, 
whereas cultivars Corregiola and Paragon formed a cluster. The volatile 
compounds hexanol, hexanal, and 1-penten-3-ol were responsible for the 
discrimination of cultivars. All maturity stages were discriminated, with the 
separation of early stages attributed to oil phenolic compounds, tyrosol and 
oleuropein derivatives, whereas the volatile compounds (E)-2-hexenal, hexanol, 
1-penten-3-ol, and (Z)-2-penten-3-ol characterized the separation of all 
maturity stages and in particular the late stages. Hexanol and 1-penten-3-ol 
characterized the separation of both cultivars and maturity stages.

Virgin olive oils produced at wide ranges of malaxation temperatures (15, 30, 
45, and 60 degrees C) and times (30, 60, 90, and 120 min) in a complete 
factorial experimental design were discriminated with stepwise linear 
discriminant analysis (SLDA) revealing differences with processing conditions. 
Virgin olive oils produced at 15 and 60 degrees C for 30 min showed the most 
significant (p < 0.01) differences. Discrimination was based upon volatile and 
phenolic compounds detected in olive oils, peroxide value (PV), free fatty acids 
(FFA), ultraviolet (UV) absorbances, and oil yield. There were different 
discriminating variables for processing conditions illustrating the dependence 
of virgin olive oil quality on malaxation time and temperature. Volatile 
compounds were the dominant discriminating variables. Common oxidation 
indicators of olive oil (PV, K232, and K270) were not among the variables that 
significantly (p < 0.01) changed with malaxation time and temperature. Variables 
that discriminated both malaxation time and temperature were hexanal, 
3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ethyl alcohol-decarboxymethyl elenolic acid dialdehyde 
(3,4-DHPEA-DEDA) and FFA, whereas 1-penten-3-ol, E-2-hexenal, octane, tyrosol, 
and vanillic acid significantly (p < 0.01) changed with temperature only and 
Z-2-penten-1-ol, (+)-acetoxypinoresinol, and oil yield changed with time only. 
Virgin olive oil quality was significantly influenced by malaxation temperature, 
whereas oil yield discriminated malaxation time. This study demonstrates the two 
modes of hexanal formation: enzymatic and nonenzymatic during virgin olive oil 
extraction.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In Kampo Japanese traditional medicine, 
ointments are used to treat skin wounds and promote wound healing. These 
ointments are prepared by extracting herbal crude drugs in sesame oil, a 
technique that has been practised for centuries. Their preparation varies 
significantly in terms of ingredients, plant species, temperature, and 
extraction time, leading to a wide diversity of formulations. Unlike hydrophilic 
plant extracts, the phytochemical composition and wound-healing efficacy of 
sesame oil-based herbal extractions remain largely unexplored.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to address this gap by focusing on 
lipophilic plant metabolites present in these topical formulations and to 
explore their potential contribution to wound healing using a keratinocyte model 
in vitro.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was conducted to document Kampo ointment-related 
practices, focusing on highlighting variations in extraction protocols, crude 
drug origins, and manufacturing practices. Sample preparation excluded solid 
compounds from the formulations and used different solvents for the metabolomic 
and biological aspects. Metabolomics profiling was performed using LC-HRMS and 
LC-HRMS/MS to analyse the impact of different preparation temperatures and 
botanical sources on extract composition. In vitro assays assessed keratinocyte 
migration and proliferation using scratch assays and EdU 
(5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) incorporation and data were evaluated with 
appropriate statistical methods.
RESULTS: A diversity of practices concerning the Kampo ointments Shiunkō, and 
Shinsen taitsukō was identified. This mainly concerned the extraction 
temperature with three protocols: maceration (M), Low Heating (LH) and High 
Heating (HH). Significant differences in metabolite profiles were observed, 
particularly with regard to the heating temperature of the sesame oil and the 
origin of the crude drugs. These parameters markedly influenced the chemical 
composition through both the formation of transformed lipids and the degradation 
of bioactive compounds such as tocopherols and sterols. While the variety of 
sesame oils and Angelica acutiloba extracts showed no distinct biological 
effects on keratinocyte migration, the complete formulas Shiunkō and Shinsen 
taitsukō unexpectedly delayed wound closure in the model. This result is 
possibly due to the degradation of wound-healing metabolites and the presence of 
cytotoxic ones, or the inadequacy of the cell model used to evaluate these 
complex lipophilic preparations.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the diversity and complexity of traditional 
Kampo ointments in terms of chemical composition and, to a lesser extent, 
biological activity. Preparation temperature and ingredient origin markedly 
shaped the metabolite profiles, affecting both the formation of new lipophilic 
compounds and the degradation of healing-related metabolites. Higher heating 
temperatures and longer extraction times promoted the formation of modified 
lipid compounds and the loss of bioactive metabolites, such as tocopherols and 
sterols. Meanwhile, the botanical origin of Angelica acutiloba affected the 
quantity of glycosylated terpenoids associated with wound healing. Complete 
formulas were found to reduce keratinocyte migration in an in vitro monolayer 
model. Targeted metabolomics suggested a loss of vitamin E-like hydroquinone 
lipids in Shiunkō and the presence of an esterified diterpene in Shinsen 
taitsukō as possible contributors. The direct clinical relevance of these 
observations remains uncertain. These results emphasise the need for in-depth 
investigations into crude drug oily extractions, which are still underexplored. 
Research into traditional Kampo ointments could benefit from a more integrated 
approach that combines metabolomics with innovative biological models, in order 
to better elucidate their therapeutic applications in wound care.

Black and purple carrots have attracted interest as colored extracts for 
coloring food due to their high content of anthocyanins. This study aimed to 
investigate the polyphenol composition of black carrots. Particularly, the 
identification and quantification of phenolic compounds of the variety Deep 
Purple carrot (DPC), which presents a very dark color, was performed by HPLC-PDA 
and HPLC-ESI-MS(n) analyses. The separation of polyphenols from a DPC XAD-7 
extract into an anthocyanin fraction (AF) and co-pigment fraction (CF; primarily 
phenolic acids) was carried out by membrane chromatography. Furthermore, 
possible anti-diabetic effects of the DPC XAD-7 extract and its AF and CF were 
determined. DPC samples (XAD-7, CF, and AF) inhibited α-amylase and 
α-glucosidase in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, DPC XAD-7 and chlorogenic 
acid, but not DPC CF and DPC AF, caused a moderate inhibition of intestinal 
glucose uptake in Caco-2 cells. However, DPC samples did not affect 
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) 
activity. Overall, DPC exhibits an inhibitory effect on α-amylase and 
α-glucosidase activity and on cellular glucose uptake indicating potential 
anti-diabetic properties.

It is unknown whether the bioavailability of isoflavones is affected by the 
concomitant ingestion of glucosides or aglycones. This study was designed to 
investigate the effects of soymilk-based beverages containing different types of 
isoflavones on their absorption, excretion, and metabolism. Twelve healthy 
volunteers consumed 3 kinds of soymilk: untreated soymilk, 
beta-glucosidase-treated soymilk, and fermented soymilk. Blood samples were 
collected after 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 24 h. Urine samples were 
collected from 0 to 48 h. Concentrations of isoflavones and daidzein metabolites 
in serum and urine were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
After the ingestion of soymilk, the total concentration of isoflavones in serum 
rose slowly and reached a maximum of 0.94 +/- 0.39 micromol/L at 6.0 +/- 1.2 h. 
However, beta-glucosidase-treated soymilk and fermented soymilk increased the 
serum isoflavone concentration significantly more quickly with maximum 
concentrations at 1.0 h of 1.75 +/- 0.33 micromol/L and 2.05 +/- 0.32 
micromol/L, respectively. The urinary excretion of isoflavones after ingesting 
of these aglycone-enriched preparations was significantly greater than after 
consumption of untreated soymilk up to 8 h after injection, but not thereafter. 
The total and individual concentrations of isoflavones in serum and urine did 
not differ when subjects consumed the 2 aglycone-enriched soymilks. However, in 
equol producers (n = 5), the ingestion of ESM tended to increase urinary 
excretion of equol compared with the consumption of FSM (P = 0.08). These 
results demonstrated that the isoflavone aglycones of soymilk were absorbed 
faster and in greater amounts than their glucosides in healthy adults and that 
the metabolism of isoflavones might be affected by the type of soymilk consumed.

BACKGROUND: Polyphenols have been shown to be effective against many chronic 
diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, the consumption of 
raisins, being a food rich in polyphenols, has been attributed with 
neuroprotective benefits. Therefore, our main objective is to evaluate the 
effect of including 50 g of raisins in the diet daily for 6 months, on the 
improvement of cognitive performance, cardiovascular risk factors and markers of 
inflammation in a population of older adults without cognitive impairment.
METHODS: Design and intervention: This study will be a randomized controlled 
clinical trial of two parallel groups. Each subject included in the study will 
be randomly assigned to one of two study groups: control group (no supplement), 
intervention group (50 g of raisins daily during 6 months).
STUDY POPULATION: The participants will be selected by consecutive sampling in 
the Primary Care consultations of urban health centers in Salamanca and Zamora 
(Spain), taking into account the selection criteria.
STUDY VARIABLES: Two visits will be made, baseline and at 6 months. Cognitive 
performance will be evaluated (Mini-Mental State Examination test, Rey Auditory 
Verbal Learning Test, verbal fluency and montreal cognitive assessment (Moca)). 
It will also be analyzed the level of physical activity, quality of life, 
activities of daily living, energy and nutritional composition of the diet, body 
composition, blood pressure, heart rate, markers of inflammation and other 
laboratory tests of clinical relevance (glycaemia, total cholesterol, HDL 
cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides). In addition, sociodemographic 
data, personal and family history, medication use and alcohol and tobacco 
consumption will be collected.
DISCUSSION: In this project, it is intended to contribute to minimize the 
problems derived from cognitive deterioration in older people.

Biodegradation in marine medium of PHBV films with or without 5 % wt. of 
phenolic compounds (catechin, ferulic acid, and vanillin) was assessed at 
laboratory scale. Respirometric analyses and film disintegration kinetics were 
used to monitor the process over a period of 162 days. Structural changes in the 
films were analyzed throughout the exposure period using FESEM, DSC, 
Thermogravimetric analyses, XRD, and FTIR spectra. Respirometric tests showed 
complete biodegradation of all materials during the exposure period (the 
biodegradation half-time ranged between 63 and 79 days) but at different rates, 
depending on the phenolic compound incorporated. Ferulic acid and vanillin 
accelerate the PHBV biodegradation, whereas catechin delayed the process. 
Disintegration kinetics confirmed these results and showed that degradation 
occurred from the surface to the interior of the films. This was controlled by 
the degradation rate of the polymer amorphous phase and the formation of a 
biomass coating on the film surface. This is the result of the compounds 
generated by polymer degradation in combination with excretions from 
microorganisms. This coating has the potential to affect the enzyme diffusion to 
the polymer substrate. Moreover, the cohesion forces of the amorphous phase 
(reflected in its glass transition temperature) affected its degradation rate, 
while the slower degrading crystalline fragments were released, thus 
contributing to the disintegration process on the film's surface. Ferulic acid, 
with its hydrolytic effect, enhanced degradation, as did vanillin for its 
plasticizing and weakening effect in the amorphous phase of polymer matrix. In 
contrast, catechin with cross-linking effect hindered the progress of the 
material degradation, considerably slowing down the process rate.

The bioavailability of polyphenols in human and rodents has been discussed 
regarding their biological activity. We found different metabolite profiles of 
quercetin in rat plasma between two administration procedures. A single 
intragastric administration (50 mg/kg) resulted in the appearance of a variety 
of metabolites in the plasma, whereas only a major fraction was detected by free 
access (1% quercetin). The methylated/non-methylated metabolites ratio was much 
higher in the free access group. Mass spectrometric analyses showed that the 
fraction from free access contained highly conjugated quercetin metabolites such 
as sulfo-glucuronides of quercetin and methylquercetin. The metabolite profile 
of human plasma after an intake of onion was similar to that with intragastric 
administration in rats. In vitro oxidation of human low-density lipoprotein 
showed that methylation of the catechol moiety of quercetin significantly 
attenuated the antioxidative activity. These results might provide information 
about the bioavailability of quercetin when conducting animal experiments.

The fragmentation patterns and quantitation possibilities of three 
anthocyanidins (pelargonidin, cyanidin, malvidin), one flavonol (quercetin), two 
flavones (apigenin, luteolin) and two flavanones (naringenin, hesperetin) have 
been investigated as trimethylsilyl and as trimethylsilyl (oxime) derivatives by 
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results proved that anthocyanidins and 
flavanones form trimethylsilyl (oximes), while flavonol and flavones provide 
simple trimethylsilyl derivatives. In all cases, characteristic fragments of 
high masses are formed proper for quantitation purposes. Hydrolysis conditions 
for naringin, hesperidin and rutin have been optimized, resulting in the 
quantitative release of naringenin, hesperetin and quercetin together with their 
corresponding saccharides. These basic studies made possible the identification 
and quantification of the flavonoid, carboxylic-/amino acid and sugar 
constituents of citrus fruit juices and albedos, without any 
extraction/enrichment procedure. In total 33 compounds have been determined in 
hydrolyzed samples, such as 2 flavonoids (naringenin and hesperetin), 6 phenolic 
acids (trimethoxybenzoic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, quinic, chlorogenic and 
rosmarinic acids), 3 aliphatic carboxylic acids (levulinic, malic, citric 
acids), phosphoric acid, 4 amino acids (aspartic, glutamic acids, alanine, 
proline), 9 monosaccharides (xylose, arabinose, rhamnose, fucose, fructose, 
galactose, glucose, galacturonic acid, sedoheptulose), inositol, sugarphosphate, 
5 disaccharides and tocopherol. Measurements were carried out as the 
trimethylsilyl (oxime) ether/ester derivatives of constituents, in the 
concentration range of 2 x 10(-3) to 49.9%. Identification level of samples 
varied between 26.4 and 77.5%, expressed in dry matter content of juices and 
albedos.

In the present study we investigated the metabolic conversion of cyanidin 
glycosides in human subjects using solid-phase extraction,HPLC-diode array 
detector, MS, GC, and enzymic techniques. Volunteers consumed approximately 20 g 
chokeberry extract containing 1.3 g cyanidin 3-glycosides (899 mg cyanidin 
3-galactoside, 321 mg cyanidin 3-arabinoside, 51 mg cyanidin 3-xyloside and 50 
mg cyanidin 3-glucoside). Blood samples were drawn at 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h 
post-consumption of the extract. Urine samples were also collected at 0, 4-5,and 
22-24h. We have confirmed that human subjects have the capacity to metabolise 
cyanidin 3-glycosides, as we observed at least ten individual anthocyanin 
metabolites in the urine and serum. Average concentrations of anthocyanins and 
anthocyanin metabolites in the urine reached levels of 17.9 (range 14.9-20.9) 
l.mol/l within 5 h post-consumption and persisted in 24h urine samples at levels 
of 12.1 (range 11.1-13.0) nmol/l. In addition, average total levels of 
anthocyanins and anthocyanin metabolites detected in the serum were observed at 
5917 (range 197.3-986.1) nmol/ within 2h post-consumption. Cyanidin 
3-galactoside accounted for 55.4% (9.9(range 7-2-12-6) l.mol/) and 66.0% (390.6 
(range 119.4-661-9) nmol V) of the detected anthocyanins in the urine and serum 
samples,respectively. The metabolites were identified as glucuronide conjugates, 
as well as methylated and oxidised derivatives of cyanidin 3-galactoside and 
cyanidin glucuronide. Conjugation probably affects the biological activity of 
anthocyanins and these metabolic products are likely in part responsible for the 
reported health benefits associated with the consumption of anthocyanins.

Anthocyanins are reported to have many ""health promoting"" properties; however, 
despite numerous reports of their bioactivities, their absorption and metabolism 
in humans are poorly understood. The objective of this research was to detail 
the pharmacokinetic parameters of anthocyanins after the administration of a 
721-mg oral dose of cyanidin 3-glycosides from chokeberry extract to human 
subjects. Solid-phase extraction, preparative-HPLC, preparative-TLC, HPLC-diode 
array detection, HPLC-MS, and NMR were utilized to isolate, identity, and 
quantify anthocyanins in 0- to 7-h (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 h) serum and 0- to 
24-h urine samples (total individual urine voids over 24 h). The cumulative 
concentration of total anthocyanins (parent and metabolites) detected in the 
serum (0-7 h) was 376.65 +/- 16.20 (nmol x h)/L (area under the concentration 
time curve), reaching a maximum concentration (C(max) = 96.08 +/- 6.04 nmol/L) 
within 2.8 h. The parent anthocyanins represented only 32.0% [120.63 +/- 2.85 
(nmol x h)/L] of the total anthocyanins detected with 68.0% [256.02 +/- 5.23 
(nmol x h) identified as conjugated metabolites. Additionally, the total urinary 
excretion of anthocyanins over 24 h was 1071.54 +/- 375.46 microg, reaching a 
maximal rate of excretion (R(max) = 202.74 +/- 85.06 microg/h) at 3.72 +/- 0.83 
h. Parallel to the serum data, only 32.5% (347.85 +/- 60.61 microg) of the 
anthocyanins excreted in the urine (total 24 h) were the parent compounds with 
67.5% (723.69 +/- 92.59 microg) occurring as conjugated metabolites. The 
metabolites were identified as glucuronidated and methylated derivatives of the 
parent cyanidin 3-glycosides. The above results indicate that cyanidin 
3-glycosides are rapidly absorbed and metabolized extensively following a 
moderate-to-high oral dose in humans.

Kamut® wheat bran (KWB) is a valuable source of polyphenols, yet its potential 
as a natural antioxidant remains underexplored. This study investigated the 
environmentally sustainable extraction of antioxidants from KWB using 
ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and evaluated the extracts' chemical 
composition, antioxidant activity, and bioaccessibility after in vitro 
digestion. Using response surface methodology, a statistical approach for 
optimizing experimental conditions, the optimal extract obtained at 500 W 
ultrasonic power with 100 % ethanol, contained 103 mg GAE/100 g DW total phenols 
and 117 mg QE/100 g DW total flavonoids. Higher ethanol concentrations improved 
the recovery of lipophilic polyphenols, enhancing their antioxidant activities 
as measured by CUPRAC and DPPH assays, and also protected against lipid 
peroxidation in human plasma. HPLC-HRMS identified tocopherols such as α-, β-, 
and σ-tocopherol, and flavonoids, like kaempferol and luteolin, and phenolic 
acids, including ferulic, vanillic, and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. In cellular 
assays, KWB extracts demonstrated the ability to reduce hemolysis in red blood 
cells to 5-17 % and lowered reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in human 
cells to 26-37 %. Furthermore, the optimal Kamut® wheat bran extract (KWBE) 
exhibited antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum strains, showing 
greater potency against the chloroquine-resistant W2 strain 
(IC50 = 21.57 μg/mL), compared to the chloroquine-sensitive 3D7 strain 
(IC50 = 47.24 μg/mL). During simulated in vitro digestion, KWBE's polyphenols 
exhibited high bioaccessibility, characterized by increased total phenolic 
content and antioxidant activity, confirming its stability and enhanced 
antioxidant potential. Microencapsulation of polyphenols using vibrating nozzle 
technology exhibited encapsulation efficiencies ranging from 51 % to 57 %. 
Overall, KWB polyphenols demonstrated strong antioxidant activity, enhanced 
bioaccessibility after in vitro digestion, and bioactivity against malaria 
parasites, supporting their potential in food and health applications. However, 
safety optimization remains necessary.

BACKGROUND: Soybean is a legume with high nutritional and functional value, rich 
in proteins, lipids and vitamins. Protein concentrates represent promising 
alternatives to animal proteins and their technological properties can be 
affected by the cultivation system. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of 
two distinct cultivation systems and environments - lowland and highland soils - 
on the agronomic performance and quality parameters of grains and their protein 
concentrates across three soybean genotypes.
RESULTS: Differences were observed among genotypes regarding plant height, with 
no significant influence of the cultivation system at stage V6; however, at 
stage R4, variations were noted. The chemical composition varied among 
genotypes, with BRS 257 exhibiting the highest protein content (428.4 g kg-1) in 
lowland soils. Productivity was higher in two genotypes cultivated in highland 
soils. On average, the cooking time of grains produced in highlands was shorter 
(66 min) compared to those produced in lowlands (75 min). In concentrates with 
at least 800.0 g kg-1 protein, the oil absorption capacity and emulsion behavior 
were not influenced by the cultivation system; however, water absorption was 
higher (6640 g kg-1) in genotypes grown in lowlands. Foam formation and 
stability in soybeans produced in lowlands showed the highest volumes, which 
decreased over time but remained superior, except for BMX Delta IPRO.
CONCLUSIONS: The genotypes demonstrated satisfactory agronomic performance, 
exhibiting adequate potential for both crop ecosystems and promising 
technological properties for industrial applications, with adaptability to both 
systems. © 2025 The Author(s). Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture

This study introduces ice-sonication enzymatic extraction as a novel method for 
preparing honey-infused ready-to-drink (RTD) black tea, optimizing bioactive 
compound extraction and sensory appeal. The impact of ice addition (20-60 % 
replacement of water) and sonication time (10-60 min) on physicochemical 
properties, bioactive content, tea cream formation, and sensory attributes was 
investigated. The optimized method (40 % ice, 40-minute sonication) achieved 
superior yields: 46.24 % water extractability, 209.83 µg GAE/100 mL total 
phenolics, 78.86 mM TE/100 mL antioxidant capacity, 30.30 µg CAE/100 mL 
caffeine, 122.40 µg TAE/100 mL tannins, 0.89 % theaflavins, and 8.40 % 
thearubigins. Compared to conventional methods, the optimized approach 
significantly enhanced extraction efficiency, minimized undesirable tea cream 
formation, and improved clarity. Incorporating various honey types (Mustard, 
Forest, Sidr, Acacia, Eucalyptus, Multiflora, Tulsi) at 12 °Brix demonstrated 
significant influences on the tea's physicochemical and sensory profiles. Among 
these, Sidr honey-infused tea exhibited the highest phenolic content, 
antioxidant activity, and sensory preference. This innovative extraction method 
offers a sustainable and effective approach for developing RTD beverages with 
enhanced bioactive content, improved stability, and consumer appeal.

Black tea, green tea, red wine, and cocoa are high in phenolic phytochemicals, 
among which theaflavin, epigallocatechin gallate, resveratrol, and procyanidin, 
respectively, have been extensively investigated due to their possible role as 
chemopreventive agents based on their antioxidant capacities. The present study 
compared the phenolic and flavonoid contents and total antioxidant capacities of 
cocoa, black tea, green tea, and red wine. Cocoa contained much higher levels of 
total phenolics (611 mg of gallic acid equivalents, GAE) and flavonoids (564 mg 
of epicatechin equivalents, ECE) per serving than black tea (124 mg of GAE and 
34 mg of ECE, respectively), green tea (165 mg of GAE and 47 mg of ECE), and red 
wine (340 mg of GAE and 163 mg of ECE). Total antioxidant activities were 
measured using the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) 
and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assays and are 
expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacities (VCEACs). Cocoa 
exhibited the highest antioxidant activity among the samples in ABTS and DPPH 
assays, with VCEACs of 1128 and 836 mg/serving, respectively. The relative total 
antioxidant capacities of the samples in both assays were as follows in 
decreasing order: cocoa > red wine > green tea > black tea. The total 
antioxidant capacities from ABTS and DPPH assays were highly correlated with 
phenolic content (r2 = 0.981 and 0.967, respectively) and flavonoid content (r2 
= 0.949 and 0.915). These results suggest that cocoa is more beneficial to 
health than teas and red wine in terms of its higher antioxidant capacity.

Secondary metabolites are important bioactive compounds for diet and medicine. 
This study optimizes the extraction of hydroethanolic herbal extracts using an 
EDGE (Energized Dispersive Guided Extraction) system, evaluates their 
antioxidant capacity, and analyzes correlations among antioxidant activity, 
total phenolic content, and individual compounds. A Doehlert matrix design was 
used to optimize extraction, having temperature and time as independent 
variables, and total phenolic content (mg GAE/g) as the response, quantified via 
the Folin-Ciocalteu method. Response surface methodology and analysis of 
variance validated the model. Extracts were characterized by high-performance 
liquid chromatography with diode array detector, and antioxidant capacity was 
assessed using three different assays. Correlation analysis explored potential 
synergistic effects. Optimal extraction conditions (40% ethanol, 60% water, 
165.82°C, 6.03 min) yielded a significant model (p < 0.05, R2 = 0.99). The mean 
total phenolic content was 69.18 mg GAE/g (SD = 0.73%). Chromatographic analysis 
confirmed phenolic acids, highlighting rutin in Crataegus oxyacantha and 
theophylline in Sorocea bonplandii. Antioxidant assays indicated a strong 
presence of active compounds, and correlation analysis suggested synergistic 
effects among constituents. The optimized extraction method effectively enhanced 
phenolic compound yield and antioxidant properties. The findings highlight 
potential synergistic interactions among phenolic constituents, contributing to 
the functional properties of the herbal extracts.

Epitheaflagallin (ETFG) and epitheaflagallin 3-O-gallate (ETFGg) are minor 
polyphenols in black tea extract that are enzymatically synthesized from 
epigallocatechin (EGC) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), respectively, in 
green tea extract via laccase oxidation in the presence of gallic acid. The 
constituents of laccase-treated green tea extract in the presence of gallic acid 
are thus quite different from those of nonlaccase-treated green tea extract: EGC 
and EGCg are present in lower concentrations, and ETFG and ETFGg are present in 
higher concentrations. Additionally, laccase-treated green tea extract contains 
further polymerized catechin derivatives, comparable with naturally fermented 
teas such as oolong tea and black tea. We found that ETFGg and laccase-treated 
green tea extracts exhibit versatile physiological functions in vivo and in 
vitro, including antioxidative activity, pancreatic lipase inhibition, 
Streptococcus sorbinus glycosyltransferase inhibition, and an inhibiting effect 
on the activity of matrix metalloprotease-1 and -3 and their synthesis by human 
gingival fibroblasts. We confirmed that these inhibitory effects of ETFGg in 
vitro match well with the results obtained by docking simulations of the 
compounds with their target enzymes or noncatalytic protein. Thus, ETFGg and 
laccase-treated green tea extracts containing ETFGg are promising functional 
food materials with potential antiobesity and antiperiodontal disease 
activities.

Total phenolics, total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity of 11 cultivars of 
fresh plums were determined using spectrophotometric methods. Identification and 
quantification of individual polyphenolics were performed using reversed-phase 
high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with a diode array detector. The 
total phenolic contents of various cultivars widely varied from 125.0 to 372.6 
mg/100 g expressed as gallic acid equivalents. The level of total flavonoids in 
fresh plums ranged between 64.8 and 257.5 mg/100 g expressed as catechin 
equivalents. Antioxidant capacity, expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant 
capacity (VCEAC), ranged from 204.9 to 567.0 mg/100 g with an average of 290.9 
mg/100 g of fresh weight. Cv. Beltsville Elite B70197 showed the highest amounts 
of total phenolics and total flavonoids and the highest VCEAC. A positive 
relationship (correlation coefficient r (2)() = 0.977) was presented between 
total phenolics and VCEAC, suggesting polyphenolics would play an important role 
in free radical scavenging. The level of IC(50) value of superoxide radical 
anion scavenging activity of the plum cultivars ranged from 13.4 to 45.7 mg of 
VCEAC/100 g. Neochlorogenic acid was the predominant polyphenolic among fresh 
plums tested. Flavonols found in plum were commonly quercetin derivatives. Rutin 
was the most predominant flavonol in plums. Various anthocyanins containing 
cyanidin aglycon and peonidin aglycon were commonly found in all plums except 
for cv. Mirabellier and NY 101.

Herein, we studied the variation in leaf and fruit morphological traits and 
antioxidant contents in 43 local and foreign cultivars (cvs) grown under the 
same experimental conditions in the widely cultivated plum species Prunus 
domestica and Prunus salicina. The peel contribution of fruit bioactive 
compounds in a serving portion, correlations among the examined parameters, and 
group patterns in each plum species were also studied. The species and cvs were 
sufficiently separated. Compared to Japanese cvs, European cvs had less 
elongated leaves and smaller and sweeter fruit with less total phenol and 
antioxidant capacities. The Japanese cvs 'Red ace' and the widely grown 'Black 
Amber', together with the European 'Tuleu Dulce', 'BlueFre', and the landrace 
'Asvestochoriou' make up groups with rich dietary sources of phytochemicals. The 
peel tissue contained higher total phenols and antioxidant capacities compared 
to the flesh, while the peel/flesh ratios varied widely among the cvs 
(6.6-fold). The variation in the antioxidant contents was lower among the cvs 
calculated per serving portion (3.7-fold); yet the peel tissue contribution was 
equal to that of the flesh (48.6%), signifying its high nutritive value. We 
observed increased sweetness in the fruit in the later-harvested cultivars, 
while cvs with more blue- and red-colored peel generally contained higher 
antioxidant contents mainly in the European plums. Moreover, larger fruit sizes 
were positively correlated with larger and more elliptic leaf shapes. In 
conclusion, the significant role of the genotype and the peel tissue as a source 
of bioactive compounds in plums were outlined with prospects of utilization in 
future breeding programs.

Prelude were analyzed for total phenolics, antioxidant capacity, and total anthocyanins before and after jam production to evaluate their changes after thermal processing. Fruits had total phenolics ranging from 245.7 to 398.5 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100 g. Antioxidant capacity of fruits ranged from 354.8 to 692.3 mg/100 g, expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC). Total anthocyanins of fruits ranged from 30.9 to 67.1 mg cyanidin 3‐glucoside equivalent (CGE)/100 g. In 100 g of jam, total phenolics varied from 132.9 to 218.9 mg GAE, while antioxidant capacity ranged from 205.6 to 373.5 mg/100 g VCEAC. Jams had total anthocyanins of 5.4 to 30.4 mg CGE/100 g. On the basis of fresh fruit (100 g), the processing and heating during jam making generally decreased the contents of total phenolics, VCEAC, and total anthocyanins. Major losses occurred in anthocyanin content where overall retention varied from 89% to 21%. HPLC analysis of individual anthocyanins from cherry cv. Balaton to its jam showed that processing caused 90% decrease in anthocyanins. The results indicated that more than 73% total phenolics and more than 65% antioxidant capacity were retained after processing fruits into jams. Optimization of food processing would help to conserve the bioactive phenolic compounds in fruits.

Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) contains abundant lignans including lipid-soluble 
lignans (sesamin and sesamolin) and water-soluble lignan glycosides (sesaminol 
triglucoside and sesaminol diglucoside) related to antioxidative activity. In 
this study, near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to develop a 
rapid and nondestructive method for the determination of lignan contents on 
intact sesame seeds. Ninety-three intact seeds were scanned in the reflectance 
mode of a scanning monochromator. This scanning procedure did not require the 
pulverization of samples, allowing each analysis to be completed within minutes. 
Reference values for lignan contents were obtained by high-performance liquid 
chromatography analysis. Calibration equations for lignans (sesamin and 
sesamolin) and lignan glycosides (sesaminol triglucoside and sesaminol 
diglucoside) contents were developed using modified partial least squares 
regression with internal cross-validation (n = 63). The equations obtained had 
low standard errors of cross-validation and moderate R2 (coefficient of 
determination in calibration). The prediction of an external validation set (n = 
30) showed significant correlation between reference values and NIRS predicted 
values based on the SEP (standard error of prediction), bias, and r2 
(coefficient of determination in prediction). The models developed in this study 
had relatively higher values (more than 2.0) of SD/SEP(C) for all lignans and 
lignan glycosides except for sesaminol diglucoside, which had a minor amount, 
indicating good correlation between the reference and the NIRS estimate. The 
results showed that NIRS, a nondestructive screening method, could be used to 
rapidly determine lignan and lignan glycoside contents in the breeding programs 
for high quality sesame.

Ready to drink (RTD) teas are a growing segment in the beverage category, 
brought about by improvements in the flavor of these products and healthy market 
trends driven by consumers. The presented results evaluated the antioxidant 
phytochemical stability of RTD teas from aqueous infusions of traditional green 
tea (Camellia sinensis) and a botanical tea from yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria) 
as influenced by packaging materials during cold storage. Two common packaging 
materials for RTD products are glass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and 
have been compared to a retortable pouch (RP), an emerging packaging material 
for various types of food since it is durable, inexpensive, lightweight, and 
easy to sterilize. Storage stability was then evaluated for each aqueous 
infusion prepared at 10 g/L at 90 °C for 10 min and evaluated at 3 °C in the 
absence of light over 12 weeks. Analyses included quantification and 
characterization of individual polyphenolics by high-performance liquid 
chromatography-photodiode array and liquid chromatography-electrospray 
ionization-mass spectrometry as well as changes in total antioxidant capacity. 
For green tea, concentrations of the three major flavan-3-ols, epigallocatechin 
gallate, epigallocatechin, and epicatechin gallate were better retained in glass 
bottles as compared to other packages over 12 weeks. In yaupon holly, 
chlorogenic acid and its isomers that were the predominant compounds were 
generally stable in each packaging material, and a 20.6-fold higher amount of 
saponin was found as compared to green tea, which caused higher stability of 
flavonol glycosides present in yaupon holly during storage. The antioxidant 
capacity of green tea was better retained in glass and PET versus RP, whereas no 
differences were again observed for yaupon holly. Results highlight the 
superiority of oxygen-impervious glass packaging, but viable alternatives may be 
utilizable for RTD teas with variable phytochemical compositions.

Flaxseed (FS) is a nutritional supplement with high concentrations of (n-3) 
fatty acids and lignans that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. 
The use of FS in the prevention or treatment of acute lung disease is unknown. 
In this study, we evaluated diets with high FS content in experimental murine 
models of acute lung injury and inflammation. The kinetics of lignan 
accumulation in blood, following 10% FS supplementation, was determined using 
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Mice were fed isocaloric control 
and 10% FS-supplemented diets for at least 3 wk and challenged by hyperoxia (80% 
oxygen), intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide, or acid aspiration. 
Bronchoalveolar lavage was evaluated for white blood cells, neutrophils, and 
proteins after a 24 h postintratracheal challenge of hydrochloric acid or 
lipopolysaccharide, or after 6 d of hyperoxia. Lung lipid peroxidation was 
assessed by tissue malondialdehyde concentrations. The plasma concentrations of 
the FS lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, were stable after mice had eaten 
the diets for 2 wk. Following hyperoxia and acid aspiration, bronchoalveolar 
lavage neutrophils decreased in FS-supplemented mice (P = 0.012 and P = 0.027, 
respectively), whereas overall alveolar white blood cell influx tended to be 
lower (P = 0.11). In contrast, neither lung injury nor inflammation was 
ameliorated by FS following lipopolysaccharide instillation. Lung 
malondialdehyde levels were lower in hyperoxic mice than in unchallenged mice (P 
= 0.0001), and decreased with FS treatment following acid aspiration (P = 
0.011). Dietary FS decreased lung inflammation and lipid peroxidation, 
suggesting a protective role against pro-oxidant-induced tissue damage in vivo.

The development of craft brewing has spurred huge interest in unusual and 
traditional technologies and ingredients allowing the production of beers that 
would fulfil consumers' growing demands. In this study, we evaluated the brewing 
performance of traditional Norwegian KVEIK yeast during the production of 
Foreign Extra Stout beer. The content of alcohol of the KVEIK-fermented beer was 
5.11-5.58% v/v, the extract content was 5.05-6.66% w/w, and the pH value was 
4.53-4.83. The KVEIK yeast was able to completely consume maltose and 
maltotriose. The mean concentration of glycerol in KVEIK-fermented beers was 
higher than in the control sample (1.51 g/L vs. 1.12 g/L, respectively). The use 
of KVEIK-type yeast can offer a viable method for increasing the concentration 
of phenolic compounds in beer and for boosting its antioxidative potential. The 
beers produced with KVEIK-type yeast had a total phenol content of 446.9-598.7 
mg GAE/L, exhibited antioxidative potential of 0.63-1.08 mM TE/L in the DPPH• 
assay and 3.85-5.16 mM TE/L in the ABTS•+ assay, and showed a ferric ion 
reducing capacity (FRAP) of 3.54-4.14 mM TE/L. The KVEIK-fermented bears 
contained various levels of volatile compounds (lower or higher depending on the 
yeast strain) and especially of higher alcohols, such as 3-metylobutanol, 
2-metylobutanol, and 1-propanol, or ethyl esters, such as ethyl acetate or 
decanoate, compared to the control beers. In addition, they featured a richer 
fruity aroma (apricot, dried fruit, apples) than the control beers fermented 
with a commercial US-05 strain.

The aim of our study was to develop a gas chromatographic method coupled with 
mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for the determination of underivatised neutral 
(CBDs-N) and acidic (CBDs-A) cannabinoids (CBDs) and cholesterol (Chol). 
Emphasis was also placed on comparing our original GC-MS method with the 
currently developed C18-high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode 
detection (C18-HPLC-DAD). A combination of a long GC column, shallow temperature 
column programme, and mass-spectrometry was employed to avoid issues arising 
from the overlap between CBDs and Chol and background fluctuations. The 
pre-column procedure for CBDs and Chol in egg yolks consisted of hexane 
extractions, whereas the pre-column procedure for CBDs in non-animal samples 
involved methanol and hexane extractions. CBDs-A underwent decarboxylation to 
CBDs during GC-MS analyses, and pre-column extraction of the processed sample 
with NaOH solution allowed for CBD-A removal. No losses of CBDs-N were observed 
in the samples extracted with NaOH solution. GC-MS analyses of the samples 
before and after extraction with NaOH solution enabled the quantification of 
CBDs-A and CBDs-N. CBDs-A did not undergo decarboxylation to CBDs-N during 
C18-HPLC-DAD runs. The use of the C18-HPLC-DAD method allowed simultaneous 
determination of CBDs-N and CBDs-A. In comparison to the C18-HPLC-DAD method, 
our GC-MS technique offered improved sensitivity, precision, specificity, and 
satisfactory separation of underivatised CBDs and Chol from biological materials 
of endogenous species, especially in hemp and hen egg yolk. The scientific 
novelty of the present study is the application of the GC-MS method for 
quantifying underivatised CBDs-A, CBDs-N, and Chol in the samples of interest.

A fast and effective dynamic sonication assisted ethanol extraction method was 
developed for extracting phenolic acids from basil, oregano, rosemary, sage, 
spearmint and thyme of the Lamiaceae family. The results were compared with 
results obtained by conventional solvent extraction techniques. A comprehensive 
two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC x LC) system interfaced to 
electrospray ionisation time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry was then 
optimised for analysis and quantification of the herb extracts. The optimised LC 
x LC system employed a combination of C18 and cyano columns. The relative 
standard deviations for the retention times were better than 0.05% (rosmarinic 
acid 0.1%) and those for the peak areas 2-14% (2 mg/l, n=3). Limits of detection 
were 18-90 ng/ml. The LC x LC-MS method was applied to the quantitative analysis 
of phenolic acids, and the results were compared with those obtained with 
conventional LC-MS.

A highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method with 
electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED) was developed for the determination of 
isoflavones. Electrochemical behaviour of daidzein and genistein was studied on 
carbon paste electrode (CPE) by adsorptive transfer stripping square wave 
voltammetry. The obtained electrochemical results were used for the development 
of HPLC-ED method. Furthermore, isoflavones were separated on an Atlantis dC18 
column using a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile (solvent A) and 0.15M 
acetate buffer of pH 5.5 (solvent B) at a flow rate 0.4 mL/min. A linear 
gradient profile (solvent B) was at 0-2 min 87%; 22 min 60%; 27 min 50%; 31 min 
45%; 47 min 87%. Full scan of multi-channel coulometric detection was tested and 
optimal potential at 450 mV was chosen for our purposes. Calibration curves were 
linear (daidzein R(2) = 0.9993 and genistein R(2) = 0.9987). The detection limit 
for daidzein/genistein was 480/394 pg/mL (1.8/1.5 nM) and per column 2.4/1.9 pg. 
Isoflavones extracted from soybean products (farina, meat, milk) by the 
accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) procedure and isoflavones present in human 
urine were determined by the HPLC-ED method.

Isoflavones are biologically active compounds occurring naturally in a variety 
of plants, with relatively high levels found in soybeans. Twelve laboratories 
participated in a collaborative study to determine the aglycon isoflavone 
content of 8 test samples of soy and foods containing soy. The analytical method 
for the determination of isoflavones incorporates a mild saponification step 
that reduces the number of analytes measured and permits quantitation versus 
commercially available, stable reference standards. Test samples were extracted 
at 65 degrees C with methanol-water (80 + 20), saponified with dilute sodium 
hydroxide solution, and analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography with UV 
detection at 260 nm. Isoflavone results were reported as microg/aglycon/g or 
microg aglycon equivalents/g. The 8 test samples included 2 blind duplicates and 
4 single test samples with total isoflavone concentrations ranging from 
approximately 50 to 3000 microg/g. Test samples of soy ingredients and products 
made with soy were distributed to collaborators with appropriate reference 
standards. Collaborators were asked to analyze test samples in duplicate on 2 
separate days. The data were analyzed for individual isoflavone components, 
subtotals of daidzin-daidzein, glycitin-glycitein, and genistin-genistein, and 
total isoflavones. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for repeatability was 
1.8-7.1%, and the RSD for reproducibility was 3.2-16.1% for total isoflavone 
values of 47-3099 microg/g.

Sumac sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) bran contains polyphenolic compounds 
with health-promoting properties. Functional food product development can add 
economic value to sorghum bran, but acceptability may be limited by bitter 
taste. An acidified cold-brewed sorghum bran beverage was developed, and 
simplified sweetened (SB) and unsweetened (UB) versions were analyzed for 
antioxidant profiles (total phenolic content, phenolic profiling via HPLC, 
condensed tannins, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, and 
2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging) and sensory properties. 
Beverages contained condensed tannins (average of 0.33 mg catechin equivalents 
per milliliter) along with other flavonoids and demonstrated in vitro 
antioxidant capacity (3.32-3.96 mmol Trolox equivalents per milliliter). One 
hundred fourteen consumers, grouped by 6-n-propylthiouracil (bitterness) taster 
status, rated acceptability (9-point hedonic scales), bitterness intensity 
(5-point scale), and purchase intent (PI; yes/no) of model beverages. Although 
the concept was novel, SB was clearly more acceptable to consumers regardless of 
preference for sweet versus unsweet tea (as a reference product concept). Mean 
mouthfeel and flavor liking scores were significantly higher for SB (6.2 and 
5.1, respectively) than UB (4.8 and 3.0, respectively). Bitterness was 
suppressed by the sweetness in SB (mean bitterness intensity of 1.8 vs. 2.6 for 
UB), although 21% of consumers still found it ""too bitter."" However, consumers' 
taster status did not affect beverage acceptability nor bitterness perceptions 
at present phenolic levels (0.53 gallic acid equivalents per milligram). After a 
sorghum/antioxidant information message, positive PI increased to 56% for SB, 
impacting more females than males. Enhanced familiarity and effective product 
messaging can improve acceptability of acidified cold-brewed sorghum bran 
beverages as a novel functional food product concept. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: New 
food applications of cereal bran can provide value in terms of byproduct 
utilization and delivery of health-promoting ingredients. Sorghum bran beverages 
demonstrated antioxidant activity, and the sweetened formulation showed 
decreased bitterness and increased acceptability. Consumers were positively 
influenced by antioxidant information, although most had not previously consumed 
sorghum.

BACKGROUND: The effects of industrial tomato paste processing and long-term (12 
months) ambient storage on the content and stability of quercetin, kaempferol, 
ascorbic acid (AA), dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA), β-carotene and lycopene were 
evaluated in a commercially produced tomato paste.
RESULTS: The initial thermal treatment (hot break; 93 °C for 5 min) resulted in 
significant reductions in quercetin (54%), kaempferol (61%), AA (63%) and 
β-carotene (30%), whereas subsequent processing steps (e.g. evaporation and 
sterilization) did not result in marked changes in these compounds. Lycopene was 
stable during hot break but decreased by 20% through evaporation and 
sterilization. The ratio of DHAA:vitamin C increased during hot break to 23%, 
whereas the ratio of DHAA:vitamin C remained relatively low in subsequent 
processing steps, indicating that AA was not oxidized. AA decreased with 
prolonged storage, with only 13% remaining at 12 months. The carotenoids and 
quercetin remained stable through 12 months of ambient storage.
CONCLUSIONS: Tomato pomace contained significant amounts of carotenoids and 
flavonoids, indicating that it may be an underutilized processing byproduct.

The antiherpes virus properties of Phyllanthus orbicularis Kunth, a 
Cuban-endemic medicinal plant, have been reported previously but data on its 
phytochemical profile and identification of antiviral metabolites as well as 
their mechanisms of action are still lacking. In this work, a bioactivity-guided 
phytochemical analysis was performed in order to isolate anti HSV-2 compounds. 
P. orbicularis contained mainly phenolic acids derivatives and flavonoids. The 
antiviral effects were attributed to (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate (EC(50) = 11.7 
µg/mL), procyanidins B1 and B2 (EC(50) = 32.8 µg/mL and 24.2 µg/mL, 
respectively) as well as oligomeric and polymeric procyanidins and their gallate 
derivatives. The antiviral mechanisms of the active P. orbicularis extracts and 
fractions were also investigated and the inhibition of several HSV-2 early 
replication events and DNA synthesis were observed. This is the first study of 
extensive fractionation and phytochemical characterization of phenolic compounds 
from this species.

Resveratrol is a stilbene, which is one of a group of polyphenols in many plant 
foods. Interest in this substance lies in its potential health benefits. This 
study aimed to compare two different methods, chromatographic and 
constant-wavelength synchronous spectrofluorimetry, an alternative technique to 
determine the amount of resveratrol dietary supplements, as a model for more 
complex foods. High-performance liquid chromatography-photodyode array 
detector-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry was used to confirm the results. 
The results obtained showed that both methods were valid for the determination 
of resveratrol in dietary supplements. HPLC with fluorescence and variable 
wavelength detectors offered better linearity and sensitivity, and would be more 
suitable for the determination of several stilbenes in complex samples. On the 
other hand, constant-wavelength synchronous spectrofluorimetry is a sensitive, 
rapid and inexpensive method that could be used for quick and precise 
determination when samples are expected to contain only one stilbene.

The chronic inflammatory skin disease atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by 
barrier defects, inflammation and microbial dysbiosis with a high prevalence of 
Staphylococcus (S.) aureus. Previously, we reported that a plant extract mixture 
consisting of curly kale, green tea and apple had beneficial effects on AD. 
Herein we further investigated the underlying promising effects exerted by the 
plant extract. The extract exhibited direct antimicrobial activity against S. 
aureus and reduced the number of extra- and intracellular S. aureus in 
keratinocytes. Gene expression analyses and luciferase reporter assays in 2D and 
3D AD-like skin models showed activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) 
by the plant extract. Knockdown experiments with siRNA revealed an AhR-dependent 
induction of the skin barrier molecule filaggrin by the plant extract in the AD 
skin model. Moreover, the plant extract demonstrated antioxidative properties by 
reduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species and induction of the 
antioxidative enzyme NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). In conclusion, the 
antioxidant and antibacterial effects of the plant extract in combination with 
the AhR activation may be promising for the topical treatment of AD. Further 
research has to uncover the full potential of plant extracts for the treatment 
of AD and other inflammatory diseases.

The effects of maturation (green, pink, and ripe) on phenolic composition of 
strawberry cultivars Camarosa, Dorit, Chandler, and Osmanli and their hybrids 
were investigated using a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. 
p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, ellagic acid, cyanidin-3-glucoside, 
pelargonidin-3-glucoside, kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin were individually 
quantified for each stage. The highest amounts of anthocyanins were obtained 
from ripe fruits whereas ellagic acid was found as the main phenolic in the 
green fruits. Phenolic concentrations were found statistically different in 
green and ripe fruits. One hybrid was found to have higher phenolic contents 
than the other genotypes. The p-hydroxybenzoic and p-coumaric acid levels 
changed during maturation, but no differences in contents of flavonoids in green 
and ripe fruit were detected.

The main objective of this study was to differentiate twenty-three monovarietal 
olive oils produced in China (Azappa, Thiaki, Leucocarpa ovoid, manzanillo de 
labata, etc.) by studying their physicochemical properties, fatty acid profiles 
and oxidative stability. The majority of analytical indicators had statistically 
significant differences (p < 0.05). The tested cultivars produced excellent 
olive oils with an appreciable amount of natural antioxidants and chemical 
composition within the legal range. Our results demonstrate that Leucocarpa 
ovoid oil was characterized by high mean levels of total phenols (401.8 mg/kg), 
oleic acid (79.62%) and oxidative stability (18.64 h). Additionally, five types 
of olive oil were selected due to their high overall quality. Investigation of 
virgin olive oils indicates that the differences in the fatty acid profiles, 
phenols, sterols and tocopherols may be caused by genetic factors. The principal 
components analysis (PCA) results showed a strong differentiation between 
various cultivars in regard to their fatty acid composition and phenol, sterol 
and tocopherol levels. These components can be effective tools for efficient 
comparison and differentiation of these cultivars. To the best of our knowledge, 
this is the first work on the differentiation of the chemical constituents of 
virgin olive oils.

Sinapic acid (SA), canolol (CAO) and canolol dimer (CAO dimer) are the main 
phenolic compounds in rapeseed oil. However, their possible efficacy against 
glycation remains unclear. This study aims to explore the impacts of these 
substances on the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) based on 
chemical and cellular models in vitro. Based on fluorescence spectroscopy 
results, three chemical models of BSA-fructose, BSA-methylglyoxal (MGO), and 
arginine (Arg)-MGO showed that SA/CAO/CAO dimer could effectively reduce AGE 
formation but with different abilities. After SA/CAO/CAO dimer incubation, 
effective protection against BSA protein glycation was observed and three 
different MGO adducts were formed. In MGO-induced HUVEC cell models, only CAO 
and CAO dimer significantly inhibited oxidative stress and cell apoptosis, 
accompanied by the regulation of the Nrf2-HO-1 pathway. During the inhibition, 
20 and 12 lipid mediators were reversed in the CAO and CAO dimer groups compared 
to the MGO group.

(Solanum melongena L.), was undertaken to evaluate the substantial variations in 
the extraction techniques, solvents, and parameters as described in the 
published literature. Direct comparison of over 10 extraction procedures or 
conditions was performed to show the importance and influence of sample 
preparation on the assay of phenolic compounds. Chlorogenic acid (CA) was the 
most abundant phenolic acid accounting for >75% of the total phenolic acids 
content extracted from the eggplant sample. Optimum extraction of CA and total 
phenolics (TP) from Black Bell cultivar of eggplant were obtained when 
extractions were performed with a mixture of MeOH/H2O at a ratio of 80:20% v/v 
using a pressurized liquid extractor (PLE) at 100 degrees C. The amount of CA 
and TP extracted from eggplant by the previously reported procedures using a 
wrist shaker, rotary shaker, stirring, sonication, or reflux with different 
extraction solvents (acetone or varying composition of MeOH/H2O solvent 
mixtures) varied significantly between 5 and 95% as compared to PLE. The 
predominant phenolic acids in the free phenolic acid fraction of Black Beauty 
cultivar of eggplant were CA isomers. However, caffeic acid isomers were the 
major phenolic acids extracted from the base-hydrolyzed fraction. The total 
amount of caffeic acid extracted from the Italian Neon cultivar was more that 
twice that of four other eggplant cultivars (Orient Express, Calliope Zebra 
Stripe, Orient Charm Neon, and Black Beauty).

A HPLC method coupled with coulometric electrode array detection for the 
determination of matairesinol in flax seed is described. The defatted sample was 
spiked with bisphenol A (internal standard), refluxed for 75 min in a mixture of 
ethanol-bidistilled water-12 M hydrochloric acid (2:2:1, v/v/v) to extract 
matairesinol conjugates and to hydrolyze them simultaneously. The extract was 
diluted with mobile phase [250 ml acetonitrile-750 ml buffer (730 ml bidistilled 
water, 20 ml glacial acetic acid adjusted to pH 3 with 5 M sodium hydroxide)] 
and injected into the HPLC system. Matairesinol was separated from other 
compounds on a reversed-phase column (Lichrospher 60 RP-Select B, 250 x 4 mm, 5 
micro m) and detected in a coulometric electrode array detector using a 
flow-rate of 0.8 ml/min. The potentials of the eight electrodes were set on 
+150, +200, +250, +300, +350, +400, +550 and +600 mV against modified palladium 
electrodes. The content of matairesinol determined in seven samples varies 
between 7 and 28.5 micro g/g. The limit of quantitation is 5 micro g/g.

Fermented vegetable spreads could offer an opportunity to diversify the range of 
plant-based foods. The challenge in developing the spreads is to achieve high 
quality, including stable consistency, consumer desirability and high 
nutritional value. The aim was to evaluate the application of chia and flaxseed 
meal for fermented zucchini-cucumber spread production. The effect on the 
chemical composition, phenolic compound content, antioxidant activity, and 
sensory quality of the vegetable spread was evaluated. Its color, viscosity, and 
microstructure were also analyzed using instrumental methods. The meal addition 
varied from 4.0 to 14.0%. The spread with meal addition had higher fat, protein, 
ash, and dietary fiber content than the control. Total free phenolic compound 
content and antioxidant activity also increased, and chia seed meal impacted the 
parameters more. On the contrary, flaxseed meal improved more the product's 
consumer desirability than chia. Both were effective gelling agents that 
increased viscosity and enhanced product spreadability, and only flaxseed meal 
showed a masking ability. Its addition reduced the perception and intensity of 
the bitter, tart, and sour taste. The spread formula consisting of fermented 
zucchini and cucumber with 9 to 11.5% flaxseed meal addition was the most 
recommended to achieve the product with high consumer desirability.

Common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) seeds are important nutritious 
grains that are widely spread in several human food products and livestock feed. 
Their health benefits are mainly due to their bioactive phenolic compounds, 
especially rutin and quercetin, which have a positive impact on heart health, 
weight loss, and diabetes management. In this study, we evaluated different 
media and light treatments for the in vitro cultures of common buckwheat (CB) in 
order to find the most optimum one producing the highest yield with the highest 
purity of these compounds. The subcultured treated samples included in this 
study were shoots, leaves, stems, hairy roots, and calli. From the several 
treated samples and under different light stress conditions, the best production 
was achieved by growing the shoots of common buckwheat in hormone-free media 
containing activated charcoal and exposing to blue light, attaining 4.3 mg and 
7.0 mg/g of extracts of rutin and quercetin, respectively, compared to 3.7 mg of 
rutin/g of extract and traces of quercetin in the seeds of CB. Continuous 
multiplication of CB shoots in the media containing charcoal and different 
concentrations of kinetin produced an extract with 161 mg/g of rutin and 26 mg/g 
of quercetin with an almost 20-fold increase in rutin content. The rutin content 
under these conditions reached up to 16% w/w of the extract. The hairy root 
cultures of the leaves exposed to red light showed a significantly high yield of 
quercetin attaining 10 mg/g of extract. Large-scale production of CB shootlets 
under the best conditions were carried out, which enabled the isolation of pure 
quercetin and rutin using a simple chromatographic procedure. The identity and 
purity of the isolated compounds were confirmed through NMR and HPLC analyses.

Atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) is a novel non-thermal technology which increases 
shelf-life of food. The aim of this research to evaluate the effects of ACP 
treatment on antioxidant activity (AOA), total phenol content (TPC), total 
flavonoid content (TFC) and rutin and quercetin levels of Common buckwheat 
(Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) flour (BF) and grain (BG). Whole buckwheat grains 
and flour were subjected to a dielectric barrier discharge plasma reactor for 5 
and 10 min at 50 and 60 kV. Results demonstrated the significant impact of ACP 
treatment on phenolics, flavonoids, especially rutin, and antioxidant activity. 
BF sample treated at 50 kV-10 min (S2), and BG sample treated at 60 kV-5 min 
(S3) showed the most AOA (92.25 ± 0.03, 89.69 ± 0.04% by DPPH and, 48.09 ± 0.05, 
42.88 ± 0.03 mmol Fe2+/mg DW by FRAP), TPC (83.99 ± 0.07, 80.47 ± 0.03 mg GAE/g 
DW), TFC (96.60 ± 0.03, 91.53 ± 0.07 mg RE/g DW), and rutin (3.6 ± 0.06, 
2.7 ± 0.02 mg/kg) levels, respectively. Results indicated that optimum ACP 
treatment can increase TPC, TFC, and AOA of buckwheat.

Aspalathin, a dihydrochalcone and C-glycoside, is the most abundant flavonoid in 
rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which is well known as an herbal tea in many 
countries. Aspalathin appears to have in vitro antioxidative and antimutagenic 
effects. To understand the effects of aspalathin in the body, research on the 
absorption in the intestinal tract, metabolism in the body, and identification 
of circulating metabolites in vivo is required. We investigated the metabolism 
of aspalathin to identify the parent compound and related metabolites in urine 
and plasma after orally administering a rooibos extract (16.3% aspalathin by 96 
g rooibos extract, which equates to 1.1 kg dried rooibos material), produced 
from unfermented rooibos plant material, to pigs over a period of 11 days (oral 
dosage, 157-167 mg aspalathin per kg body weight daily). On days 7 and 11 of the 
study and days 1 and 2 after termination, urine was collected in 24-hour 
fractions, and plasma samples were collected at various time points. To our 
knowledge, this is the first time aspalathin metabolites have been identified in 
vivo, by presenting evidence of the absorption of aspalathin. Six substances 
identified in the urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were 
identified; these represent aspalathin and the metabolites methylated 
aspalathin, glucuronidated aspalathin glucuronidated and methylated aspalathin, 
a glucuronidated aglycone of aspalathin, as well as a metabolite of eriodictyol. 
The latter compound was methylated and contained 2 glucuronic acid moieties. 
This study showed that aspalathin can be absorbed by the intestine as 
C-glycoside as well as being cleaved in an aglycone and sugar moiety. The major 
metabolite in the enzymatically treated samples was methylated aspalathin. 
Between 0.1% and 0.9% of the administered dose of aspalathin could be detected 
in the urine on days 7 and 11 of the feeding study. No metabolites or aspalathin 
were found in plasma samples. The identification of the metabolites in vivo 
enables investigations to determine the biological potential of rooibos 
extracts.

This work presents a bibliographic review about almond kernel non-lipid 
components, in particular about the protein fraction, the carbohydrates and the 
mineral fraction. In addition, other fat-soluble phytochemicals which are 
present in minor concentrations but show important antioxidant activities are 
reviewed. Almond kernel is a rich protein food (8.4-35.1%), in which the 
globulin-albumin fraction dominates, followed by glutelins and prolamins. Within 
the almond kernel protein profile, amandine dominates. Free amino acids 
represent a small amount of the total nitrogen quantity, highlighting the 
presence of glutamic acid and aspartic acid, followed by arginine. Carbohydrates 
that appear in almond kernels (14-28%) are soluble sugars (mainly sucrose), 
starch and other polysaccharides such as cellulose and non-digestible 
hemicelluloses. Regarding the mineral elements, potassium is the most common, 
followed by phosphorus; both macronutrients represent more than 70% of the total 
mineral fraction, without taking into account nitrogen. Microminerals include 
sodium, iron, copper, manganese and zinc. Within the phytochemical compounds, 
tocopherols, squalene, phytosterols, stanols, sphingolipids, phospholipids, 
chlorophylls, carotenoids, phenols and volatile compounds can be found.

BACKGROUND: Dietary intake of flavonoids, a class of plant (poly)phenols, is 
hypothesized to mediate a variety of beneficial health outcomes linked to fruits 
and vegetables (FV) intake. Absorbed flavonoids are metabolized and excreted in 
urine and may serve as biomarkers of FV intake and host metabolism, but defining 
the relationship of urinary biomarkers to the specific time of intake is 
unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize a targeted panel of 6 urinary flavonoids and 
determine the relationship to estimated dietary flavonoid intake over time in 
adults.
METHODS: Dietary flavonoid intake was estimated from both a 30-d food frequency 
questionnaire and 3-d diet records using the Phenol-Explorer database in 17 
adults. Twenty-four-hour urine was collected, and a targeted panel of 6 urinary 
flavonoids (quercetin, phloretin, naringenin, hesperetin, kaempferol, and 
isorhamnetin) was quantified using high-pressure liquid chromatography-diode 
array detection (DAD).
RESULTS: Compared to estimated intakes from a 1 d or 3 d diet record, total 
urinary flavonoids were most strongly associated with total FV (excluding 
potatoes) (rs = 0.53, P = 0.028) and total FV flavonoid (rs = 0.60, P = 0.011) 
intakes estimated by a 2 d diet record (including the day before and the day of 
the 24-h urine collection). There were no significant correlations between 
urinary concentrations of flavonoids and estimated FV intake using a 30-d food 
frequency questionnaire (rs = 0.36, P = 0.16).
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted flavonoid concentrations in a 24-h urine collection may 
serve as a biomarker for estimating dietary exposures over 2 d prior to 
completion of the urine collection, but not more distant dietary exposures.This 
trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03489213.

Lignans are phytoestrogens found in various forms such as glycosides, 
ester-linked oligomers, and aglycones in a variety of foods, including soy 
products, legumes, grains, nuts, vegetables, and fruits. This study aimed to 
optimize the extraction of lignans from cereal grains using response surface 
methodology (RSM). Lignans, including secoisolariciresinol (Seco), matairesinol 
(Mat), pinoresinol (Pin), lariciresinol (Lar), and syringaresinol (Syr), were 
quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry. A Box-Behnken design was employed to determine the optimal values 
for three extraction parameters: temperature (X1: 20°C-60°C), methanol 
concentration (X2: 60%-100%), and extraction time (X3: 30-90 min). The highest 
lignan contents were obtained at X1 = 44.24°C, X2 = 84.64%, and X3 = 53.63 min. 
To apply these experimental conditions to the actual experiment, the optimal 
conditions were slightly adjusted to X1 = 40°C, X2 = 80%, and X3 = 60 min. The 
predicted results closely matched the experimental results obtained using the 
modified optimal extraction conditions. The highest lignan content found in 
barley sprouts (85.930 μg/100 g), however, most grains exhibited relatively low 
concentrations of lignans. These findings provide valuable insights into the 
lignan content of grains and contribute to the generation of reliable data in 
this field.

Dietary phytoestrogens may be involved in the occurrence of chronic diseases. 
Reliable information on the phytoestrogen content in foods is required to assess 
dietary exposure and disease risk in epidemiological studies. However, there is 
little information on isoflavone, lignan, and coumestrol content of cereals and 
cereal-based foods, leading to an underestimation of intake. This is the first 
study of phytoestrogens (isoflavones: biochanin A, daidzein, formononetin, 
genistein, glycitein; lignans: matairesinol, secoisplariciresinol; coumestrol) 
in a comprehensive selection of 101 cereals and cereal-based foods-including 
breads, breakfast cereals, biscuits, pasta and rice-consumed in the UK using a 
sensitive LCMS technique with 13C-labelled internal standards. Phytoestrogens 
were detected in all foods analyzed; bread contained the highest amount of 
phytoestrogens-many as isoflavones-with an average content of 375 +/- 67 
microg/100 g wet weight (excluding soya-linseed bread with 12,000 microg/100 g). 
Most other foods contained less than 100 microg/100 g, many as lignans. Our 
study shows that all foods analyzed contained phytoestrogens, with the highest 
amount found in breads, making them one of the main sources of dietary 
phytoestrogens in the UK. These results will allow a more accurate estimation of 
exposure to dietary phytoestrogens.

The effects of UV radiation and rainfall reduction on the seasonal leaf phenolic 
content/composition and antioxidant activity of the Mediterranean shrub Arbutus 
unedo were studied. Naturally growing plants of A. unedo were submitted to 97% 
UV-B reduction (UVA), 95% UV-A+UV-B reduction (UV0) or near-ambient UV levels 
(UVBA) under two precipitation regimes (natural rainfall or 10-30% rainfall 
reduction). Total phenol, flavonol and flavanol contents, levels of eight 
phenols and antioxidant activity [DPPH(●) radical scavenging and Cu (II) 
reducing capacity] were measured in sun-exposed leaves at the end of four 
consecutive seasons. Results showed a significant seasonal variation in the leaf 
content of phenols of A. unedo, with the lowest values found in spring and the 
highest in autumn and/or winter. Leaf ontogenetic development and/or a possible 
effect of low temperatures in autumn/winter may account for such findings. 
Regardless of the watering regime and the sampling date, plant exposure to UV-B 
radiation decreased the total flavanol content of leaves, while it increased the 
leaf content in quercitrin (the most abundant quercetin derivative identified). 
By contrast, UV-A radiation increased the leaf content of theogallin, a gallic 
acid derivative. Other phenolic compounds (two quercetin derivatives, one of 
them being avicularin, and one kaempferol derivative, juglanin), as well as the 
antioxidant activity of the leaves, showed different responses to UV radiation 
depending on the precipitation regime. Surprisingly, reduced rainfall 
significantly decreased the total amount of quantified quercetin derivatives as 
well as the DPPH scavenging activity in A. unedo leaves. To conclude, present 
findings indicate that leaves of A. unedo can be a good source of antioxidants 
throughout the year, but especially in autumn and winter.

The distribution of total phenolics and main betacyanins in red beetroot (Beta 
vulgaris) root was determined. Also, the subsequent effects of cold storage on 
the content of total phenolics, main betacyanins (betanin and isobetanin), and 
the main known ferulic acid ester 
(beta-D-fructofuranosyl-alpha-D-(6-O-(E)-feruloylglucopyranoside) were 
determined in the peel, which is the root part containing the largest amount of 
total phenolics. The content of total phenolics in the red beetroot water 
extracts was determined according to a modification of the Folin-Ciocalteu 
method and expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE). The compounds of interest 
were identified by HPLC-ESI-MS and NMR techniques, and the contents of compounds 
were determined by HLPC analyses. The total phenolic contents in various root 
parts were found to decrease in the order peel, crown, flesh. Significant 
differences in the contents of total phenolics and individual compounds were 
found when the effect of cold storage (5 degrees C, 0-196 days) on the 
constituents of the peel from intact roots was examined. In addition to the 
betacyanins of red beetroot peel found in our earlier study, tentative 
identifications of betanidin and feruloylamaranthin were made.

The soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein are found in high concentrations in 
human plasma and urine after soy consumption. However, in vitro and in vivo data 
regarding the oxidative metabolism of isoflavones in humans are scarce. 
Therefore, we have studied the oxidative metabolites of these compounds formed 
in human liver microsomes and excreted in urine of male and female humans 
ingesting soy products for 2 days. Human liver microsomes transformed the soy 
isoflavone daidzein to three monohydroxylated and three dihydroxylated 
metabolites according to GC/MS analysis. On the basis of a previous study with 
rat liver microsomes and with the help of reference substances, these 
metabolites were identified as 6,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 
7,3',4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 7,8,4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 
7,8,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, 6,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, and 
6,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone. Significant amounts of the same metabolites 
except 6,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone were also found in urine of female and 
male volunteers after soy intake. Genistein was metabolized by human liver 
microsomes to six hydroxylation products. The main metabolites were the three 
aromatic monohydroxylated products 5,6,7,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, 
5,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone and 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone. The 
aliphatic monohydroxylated metabolite 2,5,7,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone and two 
aromatic dihydroxylated metabolites, 5,7,8,3',4'-pentahydroxyisoflavone and 
5,6,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyisoflavone, were formed in trace amounts. The same 
hydroxylated genistein metabolites except the aliphatic hydroxylated one could 
also be detected in human urine samples. Methylated forms of the catechol 
metabolites, which were generated by incubations with 
catechol-O-methyltransferase in vitro could be detected only in trace amounts in 
the urine samples. This implies that this reaction does not play a major role in 
the biotransformation of the hydroxylated daidzein and genistein metabolites in 
vivo. Most of these oxidative metabolites are described as human in vivo 
metabolites for the first time. Their biological significance remains to be 
established.

Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of two tree spinach species 
(Cnidoscolus chayamansa McVaugh and C. aconitifolius Miller.) were determined in 
raw and cooked leaf extracts. Antioxidant capacity was assessed by the oxygen 
radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, and flavonoid glycoside composition 
was quantified by HPLC and identified by GC. Total phenolics and antioxidant 
capacity were higher in raw than in cooked leaf extracts. The ORAC values were 
strongly correlated with total phenolic content (r = 0.926) in all leaf 
extracts. The major flavonoids isolated from the leaf extracts were 
kaempferol-3-O-glycosides and quercetin-3-O-glycosides. C. aconitifolius leaves 
contained more varieties of the flavonoid glycosides than C. chayamansa. Cooking 
reduced antioxidant activity and phenolic content and resulted in losses of some 
kaempferol glycoside and quercetin glycoside residues in leaf extracts. The 
results of this study indicate that tree spinach leaves are a rich source of 
natural antioxidants for foods.

Comparison of the Effects of Potassium Sulphate and Potassium Chloride 
Fertilisation on Quality Parameters, Including Volatile Compounds, of Potato 
Tubers After Harvest and Storage.

Potatoes are an important staple food with high yield potential and great 
nutritional value. Potassium (K) fertilisation can increase both tuber yield and 
quality, but its effects differ depending on the K fertilisation form. Potatoes 
are known to be chloride sensitive, since chloride ions can influence, for 
example, the starch content. Therefore, fertilisations shortly before planting 
using potassium sulphate (K2SO4) are often recommended instead of potassium 
chloride (KCl). However, the use of different fertilisation forms is 
contradictory, and the chloride sensitivity of potatoes remains unclear. To 
examine this issue in more detail, a 2-year field experiment using two 
cultivars, ""Laura"" and ""Marabel,"" was conducted. K fertilisation with 240 kg K2O 
as K2SO4 and KCl was applied, and the control remained unfertilised. Quality 
traits, including internal and external parameters, were analysed after harvest 
and after 5 months of storage at 6°C. The results revealed minor effects on 
yield, but the starch content and ascorbic acid concentration were reduced due 
to the KCl supply. Furthermore, the reducing sugar concentration in tubers 
increased during storage more after KCl compared to K2SO4 fertilisation. 
Moreover, volatile compounds were affected by the K fertilisation form, with 
higher levels of lipid-derived off-flavour compounds after KCl application. 
However, the effects of cultivation year, cultivar, and storage interacted with 
the influence of the fertilisation form. In summary, KCl fertilisation can 
disadvantageously influence several quality traits, but the use of potato 
cultivars should also be considered when recommending fertilisers.

Lignans and isoflavonoid phytoestrogens, produced from plant precursors by 
colonic bacteria, may protect against certain cancers. We examined the effects 
of flaxseed consumption on urinary lignans and isoflavonoids. Eighteen women 
consumed their usual omnivorous diets for three menstrual cycles and their usual 
diets supplemented with flaxseed powder (10 g/d) for three cycles in a 
randomized crossover design. Three-day urine samples from follicular and luteal 
phases were analyzed for lignans and isoflavonoids by isotope-dilution gas 
chromatography--mass spectrometry. Excretion of the lignans enterodiol and 
enterolactone increased with flaxseed from 1.09 +/- 1.08 and 3.16 +/- 1.47 to 
19.48 +/- 1.10 and 27.79 +/- 1.50 mumol/d, respectively (P < 0.0002). Enterodiol 
and enterolactone excretion varied among subjects in response to flaxseed (3- to 
285-fold increase). There were no differences in excretion of isoflavonoids 
(daidzein, genistein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin) or the lignan 
matairesinol with flaxseed. Excretion was not altered by phase of menstrual 
cycle or duration of flaxseed consumption.

The total alkylresorcinol (AR) content and relative homologue composition of 21 
durum wheat (Triticum durum) kernel samples, as well as 5 pasta products and the 
corresponding flour mixtures, were determined. Durum wheat contained on average 
455 microg/g ARs, and the average relative homologue composition was C17:0 
(0.4%), C19:0 (14%), C21:0 (58%), C23:0 (21%), and C25:0 (6.5%). The homologue 
composition was found to be relatively consistent among samples, with durum 
wheat being different from common wheat by having a higher proportion of the 
longer homologues. No differences in content or homologue composition were 
observed in pasta products compared to flour ingredients, showing that 
alkylresorcinols are stable during pasta processing. The ratio of the homologues 
C17:0 to C21:0 was < or =0.02 for whole grain durum wheat products, which is 
different from those of common wheat (0.1) and rye (0.9).

This study evaluated the impact of High-Temperature Short-Time (HTST) and 
Continuous Flow High-Pressure Homogenization (CFHPH) on the quality attributes 
of grapefruit juice by measuring ascorbic acid, phenolic acids, overall 
antioxidant activity, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, and the growth of 
probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum. The results indicate that HTST 
treatments (75-95 °C) led to a significant (p ≤ 0.05) decline in ascorbic acid 
content, with losses reaching 80.7 %, and a reduction in antioxidant activity, 
primarily due to thermal degradation. In contrast, CFHPH, particularly at 
300 MPa and 4 °C, was found to be effective in preserving ascorbic acid and 
phenolic acid levels in the juice, exhibiting significantly lower degradation 
(≤38.0 % loss) and maintaining higher antioxidant activity throughout the 45-day 
storage period. CFHPH also inactivated PPO, reducing browning potential and 
enhancing the bioavailability of phenolic compounds. The growth of Lactobacillus 
plantarum was favored in CFHPH-treated juices, indicating that the conditions 
and nutrient availability supported its proliferation. In contrast, HTST juices 
displayed lower abundance of phenolics, reduced antioxidant activity, and 
moderate probiotic growth, potentially due to thermal degradation of carbon 
substrates, resulting in limited nutrient availability to support bacterial 
growth. These findings suggest that CFHPH, particularly at lower temperatures 
and higher pressures, is more effective in preserving the nutritional quality 
and probiotic potential of grapefruit juice than traditional thermal treatments. 
Despite its higher energy costs, CFHPH offers a promising alternative for 
retaining bioactive compounds, enhancing the functional quality of processed 
juices, and ensuring the delivery of high-quality products with health-promoting 
attributes to consumers.

Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and 
development of atherosclerosis. Levels of phenolics, major catechins 
[(+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, procyanidin dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4], phenolic 
acids (gallic acid and caffeic acid), caftaric acid, malvidin-3-glucoside, 
peonidin-3-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-glucoside were quantified by HPLC with UV 
detection for 54 French varietal commercial wines taken from southern France to 
study the antioxidant capacity and the daily dietary intake of these compounds 
for the French population. The highest antioxidant capacity was obtained with 
red wines and ranged from 12.8 mmol/L (Grenache) to 25.2 mmol/L (Pinot Noir). 
For white wines, Chardonnay enriched in phenolics by special wine-making was 
found to have an antioxidant capacity of 13.8 mmol/L, comparable to red wine 
values. For red wines classified by vintages (1996-1999) antioxidant capacities 
were approximately 20 mmol/L and then decreased to 13.4 mmol/L for vintages 
1995-1991. Sweet white wines have 1.7 times more antioxidant capacity (3.2 
mmol/L) than dry white wines (1.91 mmol/L). On the basis of a still significant 
French wine consumption of 180 mL/day/person, the current daily intake of 
catechins (monomers and dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4) averaged 5 (dry white wine), 
4.36 (sweet white wines), 7.70 (rosé wines), 31.98 (red wines), and 66.94 (dry 
white wine enriched in phenolic) mg/day/resident for the French population. Red 
wine, and particularly Pinot Noir, Egiodola, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, and 
Merlot varieties, or Chardonnay enriched in phenolics during wine-making for 
white varieties contribute to a very significant catechin dietary intake.

Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and 
development of atherosclerosis. Stilbenes have been shown to have cancer 
chemopreventive activity and to protect lipoproteins from oxidative damage. A 
method for the direct determination of stilbene oligomers (viniferin and 
pallidol) as well as astilbin in different types of wine using high-performance 
liquid chromatography with UV detection is described. In a survey of 21 
commercial wines from the south of France, levels of pallidol and viniferin are 
reported for the first time in different types of wines. Viniferin was found to 
be present only in red and botrytized sweet white wines with levels between 0.1 
and 1.63 mg/L; pallidol was not found in dry and sweet white wines but only in 
wines made by maceration with stems, with levels between 0.38 and 2.22 mg/L. 
Highest levels of astilbin were found in Egiodola (15.13 mg/L), Merlot (11.61 
mg/L), and Cabernet Sauvignon (8.24 mg/L) for red wines and in Sauvignon (5.04 
mg/L) for white varietal wines. Astilbin levels are highest for recent vintages, 
but pallidol is not found in older vintages. During noble rot development in 
Sauvignon or Sémillon grapes from the Sauternes area, levels of trans-astringin, 
trans-resveratrol, trans-piceid, and pallidol are quite low (<0.5 mg/kg of 
grapes). Viniferin and astilbin levels become optimum at 2 and 30 mg/kg, 
respectively, during spot grape and speckle grape stages.

A straightforward stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) for the quantitative 
determination of the di- and trihydroxybenzenes catechol (1), pyrogallol (2), 
3-methylcatechol (3), 4-methylcatechol (4), and 4-ethylcatechol (5) in foods by 
means of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed. With or 
without sample preparation involving phenylboronyl solid phase extraction, the 
method allowed the quantification of the target compounds in complex matrices 
such as coffee beverages with quantification limits of 9 nmol/L for 
4-ethylcatechol, 24 nmol/L for catechol, 3-methyl-, and 4-methylcatechol, and 31 
nmol/L for pyrogallol. Recovery rates for the analytes ranged from 97 to 103%. 
Application of the developed SIDA to various commercial food samples showed that 
quantitative analysis of the target compounds is possible within 30 min and gave 
first quantitative data on the amounts of di- and trihydroxybenzenes in coffee 
beverage, coffee powder, coffee surrogate, beer, malt, roasted cocoa powder, 
bread crust, potato crisps, fruits, and cigarette smoke and human urine. Model 
precursor studies revealed the carbohydrate/amino acid systems as well as the 
plant polyphenols catechin and epicatechin as precursors of catechol and 
5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, caffeic acid as a precursor of catechol and 
4-ethylcatechol, and gallocatechin, epigallocatechin, and gallic acid as 
precursors of pyrogallol.

Maize bran heteroxylan samples were extracted in various conditions of severity. 
Their ferulate and diferulate content was investigated by GC-MS of methyl 
ester-TMSi derivatives. When extracted by 0.5 M NaOH in mild conditions, the 
heteroxylan sample contained a low level of ferulic acid (0.032% by wt.) and the 
main diferulate surviving alkaline extraction was found to be the 8-8' 
diferulate. On peroxidase treatment, this sample nevertheless produced a firm 
and brittle gel without any change in the diferulate profile. Typical lignin 
structures, mainly comprising syringyl units interconnected through beta-O-4, 
beta-1 and beta-beta interunit bonds, were evidenced in the maize bran sample. 
More importantly, these lignin structures were found to be tightly associated 
with the alkali-extracted heteroxylans. Thioacidolysis revealed the occurrence 
of 0.1-0.5% (by wt.) lignin structures in heteroxylan fractions extracted in 
mild or severe conditions, before and after purification of the polysaccharides. 
The gelling potential of the heteroxylan fractions was not only dependent on 
their ferulate level, but also influenced by associated lignin structures. These 
results argue for the occurrence of covalent linkages between heteroxylan chains 
and lignin structures which could participate in the peroxidase-driven gelation 
of feruloylated polysaccharides. They demonstrate the role of low lignin levels 
in the organization of native or reconstructed polysaccharide networks.

Cinnamic Acid Derivatives as Potential Melanogenesis Inhibitors for Use in 
Cosmetic Products.

Cinnamic acid and its derivatives are well-known cosmetic ingredients valued for 
their fragrance, skin-conditioning, UV-filtering, antioxidant, and antimicrobial 
properties. Both natural and synthetic compounds from this group are 
increasingly studied for their potential in skin depigmentation. 
Hyperpigmentation disorders such as melasma, freckles, lentigines, and 
post-inflammatory or hormonal pigmentation are common aesthetic concerns that 
remain difficult to treat effectively. Several cinnamic acid derivatives, 
including plant extracts containing these compounds, have shown promise as 
melanogenesis inhibitors. Notably, piperlongumine has already been registered as 
a cosmetic skin-lightening agent. Natural compounds like ferulic acid and 
chlorogenic acid are used in formulations for their multifunctional benefits to 
skin appearance and condition. Synthetic derivatives, particularly esters and 
amides, have also demonstrated potent anti-melanogenic activity. Interestingly, 
these effects may occur independently of antioxidant mechanisms. Reliable 
evidence supporting the efficacy of these compounds comes from advances in vitro 
models, such as 3D cell cultures and pigmented reconstructed human epidermis. 
However, clinical confirmation remains limited. To date, p-coumaric acid and 
extracts from bird's nest fern and pomegranate peel have been clinically 
evaluated. Current literature supports the continued exploration of cinnamic 
acid derivatives as promising candidates for cosmetic products targeting skin 
hyperpigmentation.

Spectrophotometric determination of tannins in tea and beer samples with 
iron(III) and 1,10-phenanthroline as reagents.

Lau OW, Luk SF, Huang HL.

A simple and accurate spectrophotometric method is proposed for the 
determination of tannins in tea and beer samples based on the reduction of 
iron(III) to iron(II) by tannins at 80 degrees C for 20 min. The iron(II) was 
then reacted with 1,10-phenanthroline at pH 4.4 to form a coloured complex. 
Background correction could be effected by precipitating the tannins in the 
sample solution twice with gelatin and kaolin. Absorbance measurements were made 
at 540 nm and the calibration graph was linear from 0 to 5.5 micrograms ml-1 of 
tannic acid with a slope of 0.213 A p.p.m.-1. The precision for the 
determination of tannins in a tea sample containing 9.45% of tannins was 1.8%. 
Most of the ingredients commonly found in tea and beer samples do not interfere 
with the determination. Several tea and beer samples were analysed for their 
tannin content using the proposed method.

The effect of olive stone removal before processing on the degradation level, 
secoiridoid and tocopherol contents, and antioxidant activity of monovarietal 
extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) was studied. EVOOs were extracted from olives of 
the Leccino, Moraiolo, Frantoio, Pendolino, Taggiasca, and Colombaia varieties 
both in the presence and in the absence of the stones. The degradation level of 
EVOOs was evaluated by acidity, peroxide number, and spectroscopic indices 
K(232) and K(270), according to EU regulation. The secoiridoid compounds typical 
of EVOO, namely, the oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives, hydroxytyrosol, 
tyrosol, and tocopherols were analyzed by HPLC. The antioxidant activity was 
evaluated by the xanthine oxidase/xanthine system, generating superoxide radical 
and hydrogen peroxide, and by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl 
test. Results showed that EVOOs obtained from both stoned and destoned olives 
had a very low degradation level, which was not affected by destoning. Destoning 
lowered slightly the alpha-tocopherol content in EVOOs but increased the total 
secoiridoid content and the antioxidant activity of EVOOs (up to 3.5-fold). 
However, these effects were variety-dependent and negligible in some conditions. 
It was concluded that a better knowledge of the reactions occurring during olive 
processing, and particularly on the involvement of endogenous pulp and stone 
enzymes, is essential to predict the effect of destoning on EVOO quality.

The degradation of secoiridoid, tocopherol, and antioxidant activity in extra 
virgin olive oils (EVOOs) was studied during 8 months of storage in closed 
bottles in the dark, at 40 and 25 degrees C. Picual, Arbequina, Taggiasca, and 
Colombaia monovarietal EVOOs possessing quite different fatty acid and 
antioxidant contents were used. The secoiridoid aglycones, namely, the 
oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives, and alpha-tocopherol decreased following 
pseudo-first-order kinetics. In all EVOOs oleuropein derivatives were less 
stable than the corresponding ligstroside derivatives and alpha-tocopherol. 
Accordingly, overall antioxidant activity decreased following pseudo-first-order 
kinetics, with rate constants ranging from 0.85 x 10(-)(3) to 4.1 x 10(-)(3) 
days(-)(1) at 40 degrees C and from 0.8 x 10(-)(3) to 1.5 x 10(-)(3) days(-)(1) 
at 25 degrees C. According to both the antioxidant activity and the hydrolysis 
and oxidation indices established by EU regulation to assess EVOO quality, 
Colombaia oil was the least stable, followed by Taggiasca, Arbequina, and Picual 
oils. Despite antioxidant degradation, EVOOs with high antioxidant contents were 
still ""excellent"" after 240 days of storage at 40 degrees C. These data led to 
the conclusion that the beneficial properties of EVOOs due to antioxidant 
activity can be maintained throughout their commercial lives.

The potential mechanism behind the browning inhibition in fresh-cut water 
chestnuts (FWC) after eugenol (EUG) treatment was investigated by comparing the 
difference in browning behavior between surface and inner tissues. EUG treatment 
was found to inactivate browning-related enzymes and reduce phenolic contents in 
surface tissue. Molecular docking further confirmed the hydrophobic interactions 
and hydrogen bonding between EUG and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL). 
Moreover, EUG also enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging enzyme 
activities, ultimately decreasing the O2 - generation rates. Regarding inner 
tissue, EUG induced the accumulation of colorless phenolic compounds and 
increased the antioxidant capacity. In conclusion, 1.5 % EUG exhibited the best 
inhibitory effect on FWC browning, which partly attribute to the direct 
inhibitory effects on PAL activity. Furthermore, EUG could also enhance the 
enzymatic/non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity and alleviate the ROS damage to 
membranes, thereby, preventing the contact between oxidative enzymes and phenols 
and indirectly inhibiting the enzymatic browning in FWC.

Sweet bell pepper is a perfect source of flavonoids and carotenoids. Some 
experiments indicated that fresh organic vegetables contained more of these 
bioactive compounds in comparison to the conventional ones. It could be expected 
that pickled organic vegetables also contain more antioxidant compounds. The aim 
of this study was therefore to analyse and to compare the concentration of 
bioactive compounds in organic vs. conventional pickled bell pepper. Two 
cultivars of sweet red pepper (Roberta and Berceo) from organic and conventional 
cultivation were used in the experiment. The content of dry matter, polyphenols 
and carotenoids in fruit has been determined. The conventional pickled bell 
pepper fruits appeared to be richer in phenolic acids, while organic samples 
contained significantly more flavonoids, including myricetin, quercetin, 
kaempferol, apigenin, and carotenoids such as beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, 
capsorubin, cryptoxanthin and cryptoflavin in comparison to the conventional 
ones.

Peaches are tasty and juicy, with a unique flavor. The flavors of peaches always 
vary with cultivars. To investigate the physicochemical and aroma 
characteristics of peaches, the sugars, organic acids, total flavonoids, 
phenols, antioxidant activities, and aroma compounds of seven peach cultivars in 
Xinjiang were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and 
headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS). The results showed that sucrose (59.83 to 87.34%), 
malic acid (32.41 to 59.14%), and chlorogenic acid (10.43 to 45.50%) were the 
dominant sugar, organic acid, and phenolic compound in peaches, respectively. 
The antioxidant activity varied between 147.81 and 394.55 μmol TEs/100 g. The 
analysis of the aroma structure of peaches found that the volatile composition 
of peaches was relatively consistent, though the concentration of total aroma 
and certain separate compounds were different between cultivars. Meanwhile, the

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with photodiode array detection 
was applied for the characterization of anthocyanins in red-fleshed Budd Blood 
(Citrus sinensis) orange. More than seven anthocyanin pigments were separated 
within 30 min by using a binary gradient (0.1% H(3)P0(4) in water and 0.1% 
H(3)PO(4) in acetonitrile) elution on a Prodigy ODS column. Separations by 
reversed-phase HPLC and semipreparative HPLC on a Prodigy 10-microm ODS Prep 
column, and acid and alkali hydrolyses were used for identification of 
anthocyanins. The primary anthocyanins in Budd Blood orange grown in Florida 
were cyanidin-3-(6""-malonylglucoside) (44.8%) followed by cyanidin-3-glucoside 
(33.6%). Two other minor pigments were also acylated with malonic acid. 
Malonated anthocyanins represented the major proportion (>51%) of anthocyanins 
in Budd Blood orange. Total anthocyanin contents and juice color parameters (CIE 
L,a,b) were compared with six other Florida-grown blood oranges.

The polyphenolic and ascorbate (ASC) components as well as the antioxidant 
capacity of Kei-apple (Dovyalis caffra) juice were analyzed and compared to 
three other fruit juices. The Kei-apple juice had significantly the highest 
total polyphenolic concentrations (1013 mg gallic acid equivalent/L), and solid 
phase (C(18)) fractionation identified the majority of these polyphenols to be 
phenolic acids. The Kei-apple juice also had significantly the highest ASC 
concentrations (658 mg/L), which showed exceptional heat stability with very 
little conversion to dehydroascorbate (DHA). Antioxidant capacities of both the 
unfractionated fruit juices and their solid phase-extracted fractions, as 
determined by oxygen radical absorbance capacity and ferric reducing antioxidant 
power analyses, correlated well to the polyphenol concentrations. Gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses showed caffeic acid as the most 
abundant polyphenol present (128.7 mg/L) in the Kei-apple juice; it contributed 
to 63% of the total antioxidant capacity (of all of the individual compounds 
identified). Other notable polyphenols identified in higher concentrations 
included p-coumaric acid, p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and protocatechuic acid. 
Our results therefore support the putative high antioxidant value linked to this 
fruit and better define this potential in terms of the major antioxidants that 
exist in the Kei-apple.

Quantitative HPLC analysis of two key flavonoids and inhibitory activities 
against aldose reductase from different parts of the Korean thistle, Cirsium 
maackii.

Previously, the correlation between antioxidant activity and HPLC profiles of 
several Korean thistles has been recognized. In our ongoing study of the 
comparative evaluation of Korean thistles, we chose Cirsiummaackii to assess the 
antioxidant and aldose reductase (AR) inhibitory activities of its varying 
parts, including the leaves, roots, stems, and flowers, along with two major 
components, luteolin 5-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside (1) and the aglycone luteolin 
(2). In order to determine selective and efficient usage of the individual 
parts, HPLC quantitative analysis of the two key flavonoids of each C. maackii 
part has been performed for the first time. From the results of the comparative 
evaluation between the oxidative stress-related diabetic complications and 
quantitative phytochemical analysis from various parts of C. maackii, the 
content of 1 and 2 might contribute to the antioxidant and AR inhibitory 
activities of this thistle, clearly suggesting their potential for use in the 
development of therapeutic or preventive agents for diabetic complications and 
oxidative stress-related diseases. Furthermore, our present study will pave the 
way of the guidelines for the efficacy and differentiation and standardization 
of individual parts of this herbal material, and as such, this bioactive thistle 
could serve as an alternative source of 1 and 2.

Flavonoid biosynthesis profile was clarified by fruit bagging and re-exposure 
treatments in the green Chinese pear 'Zaosu' (Pyrus bretschneideri Rehd.) and 
its red mutant 'Red Zaosu'. Two distinct biosynthesis patterns of flavonoid 
3-glycosides were found in 'Zaosu' pear. By comparison with 'Red Zaosu', the 
biosynthesis of flavonoid 3-galactosides and flavonoid 3-arabinosides were 
inhibited by bagging and these compounds only re-accumulated to a small degree 
in the fruit peel of 'Zaosu' after the bags were removed. In contrast, the 
biosynthesis of flavonoid 3-gluctosides and flavonoid 3-rutinosides was reduced 
by bagging and then increased when the fruits were re-exposed to sunlight. A 
combination of correlation, multicollinearity test and partial-correlation 
analyses among major flavonoid metabolites indicated that biosynthesis of each 
phenolic compound was independent in 'Zaosu' pear, except for the positive 
correlation between flavonoid 3-rutincosides and flavanols. In contrast with the 
green pear cultivar, almost all phenolic compounds in the red mutant had similar 
biosynthesis patterns except for arbutin. However, only the biosynthesis of 
flavonoid 3-galactosides was relatively independent and strongly affected the 
synthesis of the other phenolic compounds. Therefore, we propose a hypothesis 
that the strong accumulation of flavonoid 3-galactosides stimulated the 
biosynthesis of other flavonoid compounds in the red mutant and, therefore, 
caused systemic variation of flavonoid biosynthesis profiles between 'Zaosu' and 
its red mutant. This hypothesis had been further demonstrated by the enzyme 
activity of UFGT, and transcript levels of flavonoid biosynthetic genes and been 
well tested by a stepwise linear regression forecasting model. The gene that 
encodes flavonoid 3-galacosyltransferase was also identified and isolated from 
the pear genome.

This study investigated the efficacy of semi-solid fermentation with lactic acid 
bacteria on the cooking quality, structural, and functional properties of three 
colored brown rice varieties including brown rice (BRR), red rice (RER), and 
black rice (BLR). Fermentation significantly increased enzymatic activities of 
α-amylase, protease, and cellulase by 27.22%, 23.09%, and 41.72% in BLR, 
respectively (p < 0.05). Total phenolic content increased by up to 34.71% in 
RER, while anthocyanin content decreased in pigmented grains (RER and BLR). 
Structural analysis showed enzymatic degradation increased starch granule 
porosity, accelerated gelatinization and reduced cooking time by 24-27%. Sensory 
evaluation showed overall scores improved by 8-26%. Antioxidant capacity, as 
measured by DPPH, ABTS+, and FRAP assays, improved by 8.47-30.67%. These results 
highlight lactic acid bacteria-mediated semi-solid fermentation as a reliable 
strategy to improve the culinary quality and nutritional value of colored brown 
rice, providing valuable insights for developing functional whole grain 
products.

Peanut and its derivatives, especially peanut butter, are extensively consumed 
in many countries, mainly in the United States, which is also the major exporter 
of these products. trans-Resveratrol is present in peanuts, and recently this 
compound has been quantified in peanut butter. It is well-known that there are 
beneficial effects of trans-resveratrol and its glucoside, the piceid, in 
health. The absorption of trans-resveratrol has been proven in animals, and 
certain studies show that the absorption of some phenols is enhanced by 
conjugation with glucose, so that it could be possible that trans-piceid would 
be more absorbed than its aglycon (trans-resveratrol). In our work, we have 
identified the presence of trans-piceid in peanut butter with a new method to 
quantify trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid (3-beta-glucose of 
trans-resveratrol). This fact is very interesting because the glucosilated form 
could be more easily absorbed by the intestinal gut; in this way trans-piceid 
would exercise its beneficial function more efficiently than trans-resveratrol. 
To our knowledge, this is the first time that trans-piceid has been quantified 
in peanut butter. Resveratrol and piceid contents in natural peanut butters were 
found to be significantly higher than those in blended peanut butters.

In vitro trials have indicated various potential health effects of lingonberries 
( Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.). Most of these studies have been performed with 
berry extract or juice, and the detailed chemical structures of active compounds 
in these products have not been elucidated. Lingonberry contains 
cyanidin-3-galactoside as its main anthocyanin. Absorption and metabolism of the 
compound is not fully understood, and no studies of anthocyanin metabolism have 
been performed with lingonberries. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
urinary excretion of cyanidin-3-galactoside and its metabolites in young and 
healthy subjects receiving a breakfast containing 300 g of lingonberries. A 
fast, selective, and sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (uHPLC-MS/MS) method was optimized for 
the analysis of the anthocyanin metabolites in urine. Both intact 
cyanidin-3-galactoside and its methylated and glucuronidated metabolites were 
identified from urine samples. The two metabolites represented >50% of cyanidin 
excreted in urine. Maximal excretion appeared between 4 and 8 h after the meal. 
Also, the compounds were absorbed more slowly than reported previously in 
several studies.

The aim of this study was to compare some bioactive compounds in apples, peaches 
and pears and their influence on lipids and antioxidant capacity in rats. The 
content of total polyphenols (g/100g) was 0.23 +/- 0.03; 0.22 +/- 0.03 and 0.68 
+/- 0.1 in peeled fruits and 0.48 +/- 0.04, 0.47 +/- 0.04 and 1.2 +/- 0.12 in 
peels of peaches, pears and apples, respectively. Caffeic, p-coumaric and 
ferulic acids and the total radical-trapping antioxidative potential (TRAP) 
values in peeled apples and their peels were significantly higher than in 
peaches and pears, respectively. Contrarary, no significant differences in the 
content of dietary fiber among the studied fruits were found. The content of all 
studied indices in peels was significantly higher than peeled fruits (p < 0.05 
). A good correlation between the total polyphenols and the TRAP values was 
found in all fruits. Diets supplemented with apples and to a less extent with 
peaches and pears have improved lipid metabolism and increased the plasma 
antioxidant potential especially in rats fed with added cholesterol. The highest 
content of biologically active compounds and the best results in the experiment 
on rats makes apple preferable for dietary prevention of atherosclerosis and 
other diseases.

Flavanone glycosides (FGs) and polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) have been 
studied in pigmented orange (Citrus sinensis) juices and second-pressure 
extracts (SPEs) by high-performance liquid chromatography and diode array 
detector. Detection was performed simultaneously at two different wavelengths: 
278 nm (for determination of FGs) and 325 nm (for determination of PMFs). 
Qualitative distribution patterns of FGs and PMFs in juices and SPEs were 
similar, although the quantitative results are quite different. An increased 
narirutin/hesperidin ratio after centrifugation and the presence of high amounts 
of PMFs in SPEs, which remain unchanged after centrifugation, were observed. 
Therefore, a simple and affordable procedure to distinguish an orange juice from 
SPEs was proposed.

Ancient tea plants over 100 years old are valuable sources of 
unique-taste-imparting metabolites sought after in the tea market. Understanding 
the metabolite profiles of ancient tea plants can reveal novel compounds with 
potential health benefits and inform breeding programs for improved tea quality. 
We investigated 26 ancient tea plants from four natural villages in Lancang 
river area, Yunnan province, China, tree' age was estimated based on trunk 
diameter (>20 cm) and local knowledge. UPLC-qTOF-MS/MS analysis identified two 
special compounds, 
1,2-di-O-galloyl-(4,6-(S)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl)-β-d-glucopyranose (GHG) and 
5-O-galloylquinic acid. Significant differences existed between the metabolic 
profiles of ancient tea plants, among which GHG was highly accumulated in some 
of them (peak contents (228.28 mg/g) being 2.61× higher than previously 
reported). GHG also negatively correlated with ester catechins and 
1,2,6-tri-O-galloyl-β-d-glucopyranose. We identify various ancient tea 
germplasms with high levels of GHG that may be highly valuable for the 
development of new tea beverages and functional foods.

Tea has been proposed to have beneficial health effects which have been 
attributed to the polyphenolic compounds known as catechins. The bioavailability 
and biotransformation of these compounds, however, are not clearly understood. 
In this study, we used liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass 
spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS) to determine urinary glucuronidated and sulfated tea 
catechins and their metabolites (including methylated and ring-fission 
metabolites) based on the detection of deprotonated molecular ions and aglycone 
fragment ions. The compound resolution was achieved both chromatographically and 
mass spectroscopically. After green tea administration, the major conjugates 
appeared in human, mouse, and rat urine samples were identified as 
monoglucuronides and monosulfates of (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and 
(-)-epicatechin. We also found O-methyl-EGC-O-glucuronides and -O-sulfates and 
O-methyl-epicatechin-O-sulfates in human urine. 
(-)-5-(3',4',5'-Trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4) and 
(-)-5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6), the ring-fission 
metabolites of EGC and (-)-epicatechin, respectively, were also predominantly in 
monoglucuronide and monosulfate forms in the urine. In comparison to rats, the 
urinary metabolite profiles of tea catechins in mice resemble more closely to 
those in humans. This is the first report describing direct simultaneous 
analysis of multiple tea catechin conjugates in urine samples. This method will 
allow more thorough investigations of the biotransformation of tea polyphenols.

To identify and quantify biologically active components in rat serum after 
orally administrating the decoction of Bulpleurum falcatum L. and Fractus 
aurantii, one of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and 
validated. The HPLC separation was carried out on a Waters Nova Pak C(18) column 
using acetonitrile and water as mobile phase after the sample of rat serum was 
cleaned up with solid-phase extraction. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization 
in the negative ion mode and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) method was 
developed to determine the active components. Three flavonoids of hesperidin, 
neohesperidin and naringin were identified in the serum by comparing their 
retention times and three independent SRM precursor/product ion transitions with 
those of corresponding reference standards. The concentrations of naringin, 
hesperidin and neohesperidin in rat serum determined by SRM measurement were 
16.3, 11.9 and 14.3 ng/ml, respectively, after orally administrating the 
decoction of B. falcatum L. and F. aurantii. This method was validated in terms 
of recovery, linearity, accuracy and precision (intra- and interday variation). 
The recoveries from spiked control samples were 93.0, 89.3 and 91.2% for 
hesperidin, neohesperidin and naringin, respectively. Linearity in rat serum was 
observed over the range of 2.0-50.0 ng/ml. Percent bias (accuracy) and precision 
were well within the acceptable range and the relative standard deviation 
(R.S.D.) of the measured rat serum samples was less than 10% (n=5).

Polymethoxyflavones (PMFs) have been known as a type of bioactive flavones that 
possess various beneficial biological functions. Accumulating evidence 
demonstrated that the metabolites of PMFs, that is, hydroxyl PMFs (OH-PMFs), had 
more potent beneficial biological effects than their corresponding parent PMFs. 
To facilitate the further identification and quantification of OH-PMFs in 
biological samples, the aim of this study was to develop a methodology for the 
simultaneous determination of 10 OH-PMFs using high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) coupled with electrochemistry detection. The HPLC profiles 
of these 10 OH-PMFs affected by different chromatographic parameters (different 
organic composition in mobile phases, the concentration of trifluoroacetic acid, 
and the concentration of ammonium acetate) are fully discussed in this study. 
The optimal condition was selected for the following validation studies. The 
linearity of calibration curves, accuracy, and precision (intra- and interday) 
at three concentration levels (low, middle, and high concentration range) were 
verified. The regression equations were linear (r > 0.9992) over the range of 
0.005-10 μM. The limit of detection for 10 OH-PMFs was in the range of 0.8-3.7 
ng/mL (S/N = 3, 10 μL injection). The recovery rates ranged from 86.6 to 108.7%. 
The precisions of intraday and interday analyses were less than 7.37 and 8.63% 
for relative standard deviation, respectively. This validated method was applied 
for the analysis of a variety of samples containing OH-PMFs. This paper also 
gives an example of analyzing the metabolites of nobiletin in mouse urine using 
the developed method. The transformation from nobiletin to traces of 5-hydroxyl 
metabolites has been discovered by this effective method, and this is the first 
paper to report such an association.

The polyphenolic compositions of three heartnut (Juglans ailanthifolia var. 
cordiformis) varieties (Imshu, Campbell CW1, and Campbell CW3) were examined and 
compared with those of two Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.) varieties (Combe 
and Lake). The nuts were defatted, extracted, and separated into three different 
fractions, the free phenolic acid (FPA), acid-hydrolyzable phenolic acid (AHPA), 
and bound phenolic acid (BPA) fractions. The total phenolic contents (TPCs) in 
both FPA and AHPA of the Persian walnuts were significantly higher (P < 0.001) 
than those of the heartnuts, but not in the BPA (P = 0.20). LC-ESI-MS(n)() 
studies revealed that except for the FPA fraction, the major polyphenolics in 
both heartnut and Persian walnut were ellagic acid and valoneic acid dilactone. 
Persian walnuts contained an average of 0.29 and 1.31 mg of ellagic acid/g nut 
in the 80% methanol extractable fractions FPA and AHPA, respectively. Heartnuts 
contained an average of 0.16 and 0.60 mg of ellagic acid/g nut in the respective 
fractions. Bound ellagic acid in the residue was 0.93 and 0.70 mg/g of nut in 
the Persian walnut and in the heartnut, respectively. Valoneic acid dilactone 
was tentatively identified and quantified as milligrams of ellagic acid 
equivalent per gram of nut. These components were found to contribute to the 
strong total antioxidant activities measured using ferric reducing antioxidant 
power and photochemiluminescence methods.

Flaxseed contains the largest amount of lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside 
(SDG) oligomers and is the richest dietary source of SDG. SDG oligomers in the 
flaxseed extract are often hydrolyzed to break the ester linkages for the 
release of SDG and the glycosidic bonds for the release of secoisolariciresinol 
(SECO). The hydrolysates of SDG oligomers are complicated because of the 
production of esters in an alcohol-containing medium. In this study, a new 
gradient reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has 
been developed to be suitable for the separation and determination of: (1) SDG 
oligomers extracted from the defatted flaxseed powder by a 70% aqueous methanol 
solution; (2) SDG oligomers and their alkaline hydrolysates, including SDG, 
p-coumaric acid glucoside and its methyl ester, ferulic acid glucoside and its 
methyl ester in an alkaline hydrolytic solution; and (3) the succedent acid 
hydrolysates, including secoisolariciresinol monoglucoside (SMG), SECO, 
anhydrosecoisolariciresinol (anhydro-SECO), p-coumaric acid and its methyl 
ester, ferulic acid and its methyl ester, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (HMF) and 
its degradation product in an acid hydrolytic solution. The content of SDG 
oligomers in a defatted flaxseed powder was found to be 38.5 mg/g on a dry 
matter basis, corresponding to a SDG content of 15.4 mg/g, which was determined 
after alkaline hydrolysis. Furthermore, this study presented a major reaction 
pathway for the hydrolysis of SDG oligomers.

Dietary phytoestrogens have a number of biological effects, including endocrine 
disruption, antioxidant potential, and protein tyrosine kinase inhibition. 
Secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin are lignan phytoestrogens found 
in foodstuffs, especially flaxseed. Normally they are glycosidically linked to 
carbohydrates and in the large intestine are deconjugated from the carbohydrate 
portion by bacteria. The aglycone lignans can be further modified to form the 
mammalian phytoestrogens enterodiol, enterolactone, and enterofuran, which are 
absorbed into the body and excreted in urine. To assess the health implications 
of phytoestrogens in general populations, knowledge of the quantity in the foods 
eaten is necessary. This article describes a simple preparative procedure for 
the assay of secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin in foodstuffs 
after hydrolytic removal of any conjugated carbohydrate. The difficulties in the 
practical application of the assay procedure are illustrated and discussed. 
Analytical results indicating the concentration of secoisolariciresinol, 
matairesinol, and shonanin in a number of foodstuffs are presented. Also, the 
mass spectral data of a putative mammalian phytoestrogen, called enterofuran, 
identified in urine are presented.

The withering and fermentation degrees are the key parameters to measure the 
processing technology of black tea. The traditional methods to judge the degree 
of withering and fermentation are time-consuming and inefficient. Here, a 
monitoring model of the biochemical components of tea leaves based on 
hyperspectral imaging technology was established to quantitatively judge the 
withering and fermentation degrees of fresh tea leaves. Hyperspectral imaging 
technology was used to obtain the spectral data during the withering and 
fermentation of the raw materials. The successive projections algorithm (SPA), 
competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), and uninformative variable 
elimination (UVE) are used to select the characteristic bands. Combined with the 
support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and partial least square (PLS) 
methods, the monitoring models of the tea polyphenols (TPs), free amino acids 
(FAA) and caffeine (CAF) contents were established. The results show that: (1) 
CARS performs the best among the three feature band selection methods, and PLS 
performs the best among the three machine learning models; (2) the optimal 
models for predicting the content of the TPs, FAA, and CAF are CARS-PLS, 
SPA-PLS, and CARS-PLS, respectively, and the coefficient of determination of the 
prediction set is 0.91, 0.88, and 0.81, respectively; and (3) the best models 
for quantitatively judging the withering and fermentation degrees are 
FAA-SPA-PLS and TPs-CARS-PLS, respectively. The model proposed in this study can 
improve the monitoring efficiency of the biochemical components of tea leaves 
and provide a basis for the intelligent judgment of the withering and 
fermentation degrees in the process of black tea processing.

LC-DAD-ESI/MS was used to identify 23 flavonoids in the extract of Mexican 
oregano (Lippia graveolens H.B.K.), a spice and herb, used in the USA and 
Mexico. The identification of luteolin-7-O-glucoside, apigenin 7-O-glucoside, 
phloridzin, taxifolin, eriodictyol, scutellarein, luteolin, quercetin, 
naringenin, pinocembrin and galangin was confirmed by direct comparison with 
standards. Identification of 6-hydroxyluteolin, two 6-hydroxyluteolin 
7-O-glycosides, three pentahydroxyflavanone hexosides, scutellarein 
7-O-hexoside, 3-hydroxyphloretin hexoside, and three other flavones, was made by 
detailed analysis of their UV and mass spectral data. The identification of the 
flavonoid glycosides was further confirmed through detection of their aglycones 
following hydrolysis of the samples. The concentration of the identified 
flavonoids in three samples was also estimated. This is the first report of 
detection of over 20 flavonoids, including chalcones, in this plant material.

A screening method using LC-DAD-ESI/MS was applied to the analysis of flavonoids 
in celery, Chinese celery, and celery seeds (Apium graveolens L. and varieties). 
Fifteen flavonoid glycosides were detected in the three celery materials. They 
were identified as luteolin 7-O-apiosylglucoside, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, 
apigenin 7-O-apiosylglucoside, chrysoeriol 7-O-apiosylglucoside, chrysoeriol 
7-O-glucoside, and more than 10 malonyl derivatives of these glycosides. The 
identification of the malonyl derivatives was confirmed by their conversion into 
glycosides upon heating and by comparison of some of the malonates with 
malonates that had previously been identified in red bell pepper and parsley. 
The concentrations of the glycosides and the malonyl glycosides in the three 
materials were estimated by comparison to aglycone standards. This is the first 
report of the presence of these glycosylated flavonoid malonates in celery.

The present study aimed to comprehensively characterize the physicochemical, 
nutritional, and functional properties of Armoracia rusticana leaves and roots, 
with a focus on their potential as sources of bioactive compounds. Quality 
parameters (color, moisture, titratable acidity, pH), macronutrient (proteins, 
fats, carbohydrates, fibers) and micronutrient (minerals, vitamins) content were 
determined. Polyphenolic profiles were evaluated using HPLC-DAD in two types of 
extracts: methanol-water (1:1, v/v) and deionized water. Flavonols (quercetin, 
kaempferol, myricetin), hydroxybenzoic acids (p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, 
caffeic), and hydroxycinnamic acids (chlorogenic, p-coumaric, rosmarinic) were 
identified. Freeze-drying proved effective in preserving thermolabile compounds, 
such as vitamin C (299.78 mg/100 g) and polyphenols (107.14 mg/100 g). 
Antioxidant capacity of the leaf extracts ranged between 74.52% and 76.90%, 
while pigment quantification revealed high levels of chlorophyll a (360.7 mg/100 
g), chlorophyll b (110.03 mg/100 g), and total carotenoids (72.35 mg/100 g). 
FTIR spectroscopy was employed to assess molecular structures and functional 
group composition. Overall, the results support the valorization of A. rusticana 
leaves-an underutilized plant part-alongside roots, for applications in 
functional foods and nutraceutical development.

The major flavonoids in rat serum after oral administration of Dalbergia 
odorifera extract were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by high 
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and its coupling to mass spectrometry 
(HPLC-MS). Utilizing HPLC-MS technique, 18 flavonoids including five 
isoflavones, four isoflavanones, four neoflavones, two flavanones, two 
chalcones, one isoflavanonol were identified in free form in serum sample based 
on comparison with the authentic standards. Furthermore, the amounts of the four 
prominent flavonoids, (3R)-4'-methoxy-2',3,7-trihydroxyisoflavanone, vestitone, 
formononetin and sativanone were determined in serum by HPLC-UV with internal 
standard method. The method was validated and utilized in pharmacokinetic 
studies of these four analytes. This is the first report on identification and 
determination of the major flavonoids in rat serum after oral administration of 
D. odorifera extract and the results provided a firm basis for clarifying the 
pharmacological effect of D. odorifera and evaluating the clinical applications 
of this medicinal herb.

Two commercial samples of soft (70% Canadian Eastern soft red spring and 30% 
Canadian Eastern soft white winter) and hard (90% Canadian western hard red 
spring and 10% Canadian Eastern hard red winter) wheats were used to obtain 
different milling fractions. Phenolics extracted belonged to free, soluble 
esters and insoluble-bound fractions. Soluble esters of phenolics and 
insoluble-bound phenolics were extracted into diethyl ether after alkaline 
hydrolysis of samples. The content of phenolics was determined using 
Folin-Ciocalteu's reagent and expressed as ferulic acid equivalents (FAE). The 
antioxidant activity of phenolic fractions was evaluated using Trolox equivalent 
antioxidant capacity, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging, reducing 
power, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, inhibition of oxidation of human 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and DNA, Rancimat, inhibition of 
photochemilumenescence, and iron(II) chelation activity. The bound phenolic 
content in the bran fraction was 11.3 +/- 0.13 and 12.2 +/- 0.15 mg FAE/g 
defatted material for hard and soft wheats, respectively. The corresponding 
values for flour were 0.33 +/- 0.01 and 0.46 +/- 0.02 mg FAE/g defatted sample. 
The bound phenolic content of hard and soft whole wheats was 2.1 (+/-0.004 or 
+/-0.005) mg FAE/g defatted material. The free phenolic content ranged from 0.14 
+/- 0.004 to 0.98 +/- 0.05 mg FAE/g defatted milling fractions of hard and soft 
wheats examined. The contribution of bound phenolics to the total phenolic 
content was significantly higher than that of free and esterified fractions. In 
wheat, phenolic compounds were concentrated mainly in the bran tissues. In the 
numerous in vitro antioxidant assays carried out, the bound phenolic fraction 
demonstrated a significantly higher antioxidant capacity than free and 
esterified phenolics. Thus, inclusion of bound phenolics in studies related to 
quantification and antioxidant activity evaluation of grains and cereals is 
essential.

Cocoa-phytochemicals have been related to the health-benefits of cocoa 
consumption. Metabolomics has been proposed as a powerful tool to characterize 
both the intake and the effects on the metabolism of dietary components. Human 
urine metabolome modifications after single cocoa intake were explored in a 
randomized, crossed, and controlled trial. After overnight fasting, 10 subjects 
consumed randomly either a single dose of cocoa powder with milk or water, or 
milk without cocoa. Urine samples were collected before the ingestion and at 
0-6, 6-12, and 12-24-h after test-meals consumption. Samples were analyzed by 
HPLC-q-ToF, followed by multivariate data analysis. Results revealed an 
important effect on urinary metabolome during the 24 h after cocoa powder 
intake. These changes were not influenced by matrix as no global differences 
were found between cocoa powder consumption with milk or with water. Overall, 27 
metabolites related to cocoa-phytochemicals, including alkaloid derivatives, 
polyphenol metabolites (both host and microbial metabolites) and 
processing-derived products such as diketopiperazines, were identified as the 
main contributors to the urinary modifications after cocoa powder intake. These 
results confirm that metabolomics will contribute to better characterization of 
the urinary metabolome in order to further explore the metabolism of 
phytochemicals and its relation with human health.

The aim of this study was to compare the amount and activity of phytonutrients 
in raw, grilled, and boiled eggplant fruit using chemical measures and a 
biological assay of oxidative bursts in human neutrophils. The thermally treated 
samples showed various changes in their chemical composition (dry matter, 
soluble solids, acidity, and the amount of alcohol insoluble substances) due to 
the cooking processes and were much richer in the main phenolic compounds such 
as chlorogenic and caffeic acids, which are known to be antioxidants. 
Consequently, their free radical scavenging activity was significantly higher, 
especially that of superoxide anion. The biological assay of oxidative bursts 
from human neutrophils in the presence of 
N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine confirmed the greater activity of 
extracts of the cooked eggplants with respect to raw eggplants. Successive 
extract dilutions showed a significant activity up to 1.25 microg/mL after 
cooking, while raw fruits resulted in an activity up to 10.00 microg/mL. These 
results showed that the thermal treatment commonly used before consumption can 
increase the content and biological activity of antioxidant compounds of 
eggplants.

Flavonoids are phytochemicals that are widespread in the human diet. Despite 
limitations in their bioavailability, experimental and epidemiological data 
suggest health benefits of flavonoid consumption. Valid biomarkers of flavonoid 
intake may be useful for estimating exposure in a range of settings. However, to 
date, few useful flavonoid biomarkers have been identified. In this study, we 
used a metabolite profiling approach to examine the aromatic and phenolic 
profile of plasma and urine of healthy men after oral consumption of 200 mg of 
the pure flavonoids, quercetin, (-)-epicatechin, and epigallocatechin gallate, 
which represent major flavonoid constituents in the diet. Following enzymatic 
hydrolysis, 71 aromatic compounds were quantified in plasma and urine at 2 and 5 
h, respectively, after flavonoid ingestion. Plasma concentrations of different 
aromatic compounds ranged widely, from 0.01 to 10 micromol/L, with variation 
among volunteers. None of the aromatic compounds was significantly elevated in 
plasma 2 h after consumption of either flavonoid compared with water placebo. 
This indicates that flavonoid-derived aromatic compounds are not responsible for 
the acute physiological effects reported within 2 h in previous human 
intervention studies involving flavonoids or flavonoid-rich food consumption. 
These effects are more likely due to absorption of the intact flavonoid. Our 
urine analysis suggested that urinary 4-ethylphenol, benzoic acid, and 
4-ethylbenzoic acid may be potential biomarkers of quercetin intake and 
1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene, 4-O-methylgallic acid, 3-O-methylgallic acid, and 
gallic acid may be potential markers of epigallocatechin gallate intake. 
Potential biomarkers of (-)-epicatechin were not identified. These urinary 
biomarkers may provide an accurate indication of flavonoid exposure.

Fruits and vegetables are considered a good source of antioxidants, which are 
beneficial in protecting the human body against damage induced by free radicals 
and other reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species. In this work, we 
aimed to evaluate the integral antioxidant activity (AOA) and determine 
individual polyphenols in fruits and vegetables of frequent consumption. For 
this purpose, an innovative and high throughput analytical approach based on 
original QuEChERS assisted by ultrasound extraction (USAE), instead of the 
manual agitation used in the classical procedure, was optimized and implemented 
for the isolation of polyphenols. The total phenolic content (TPC), flavonoids, 
anthocyanins, and betalains were evaluated using different spectrophotometric 
assays. In addition, free radical scavenging by methods 
2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) and 
2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power 
(FRAP) were used to estimate the AOA of the investigated fruit and vegetable 
extracts. Red onion, tamarillo, and beetroot were the samples with the highest 
AOA. The quantification and identification of free low molecular weight 
polyphenols from QuEChERS-USAE extracts was carried out by ultra-high-pressure 
liquid chromatography equipped with a photodiode array detection system 
(UHPLC-PDA). Catechin was the most abundant polyphenol, followed by gentisic and 
ferulic acids, mainly in the watercress sample. In relation to flavonols, 
quercetin and kaempferol were found mostly in onion samples, and in small 
quantities in tomato and watercress. The improved analytical approach, 
QuEChERS-USAE/UHPLC-PDA, offers an attractive alternative for the analysis of 
polyphenols from fruit and vegetable samples, providing several advantages over 
traditional extraction techniques, in terms of reproducibility, simplicity, low 
cost, analysis speed, and analytical performance.

Effects of heat treatment and storage on quercetin and isorhamnetin content, 
major and minor components of isorhamnetin, and quercetin glucosides and 
aglycone, were investigated in onion (Allium cepa L.). The sweet onion 'Recorra' 
and red onions 'Hyred' and 'Red Baron' were cultivated in the south part of 
Norway and thereafter stored for eight months. The onions were either not field 
dried, but stored directly, or field dried and then stored, or field dried and 
then heat treated before storage. Neither storage nor heat treatment caused any 
major differences in total flavonol content in the investigated sweet onion as 
well as in the red onion cultivars. The two major quercetin glucosides differed 
in their changes in content during storage; quercetin-4'-glucoside did not show 
any consistent changes during storage in the two red cultivars, independent of 
treatment, whereas quercetin-3,4'-diglucoside increased significantly by 30 or 
51%, respectively, during storage in 'Hyred' and 'Red Baron' in the 24 h heat 
treated onions. Isorhamnetin-4'-glucoside, which might possibly be of special 
interest from a human health point of view, was present at 2-3 times higher 
amount in the sweet onion cultivar than in the two red cultivars. Some of the 
quercetin glucosides present at lower concentrations, 
isorhamnetin-3,4'-diglucoside, quercetin-3,7,4'-triglucoside, and 
quercetin-7,4'-diglucoside, increased during storage in all treatments in both 
'Hyred' and 'Red Baron', though sometimes a decrease was found at the end of 
storage.

Tea, and particularly bottled tea, is widely consumed worldwide and is often 
encountered at crime scenes in poisoning cases or used in place of urine in drug 
abuse monitoring. Tea is a rich source of polyphenols, such as catechins and 
theaflavins, and these compounds are useful for identification of trace 
quantities of tea samples. However, information on the contents of catechins and 
theaflavins in bottled tea is limited. In this study, a method was developed for 
simultaneous analysis of eight catechins and four theaflavins in tea using 
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The concentrations of 
these polyphenols were determined in bottled black, oolong, and green teas after 
a simple pretreatment process by the standard addition method. The developed 
LC-MS/MS method was rapid and all tested polyphenol compounds were separated 
within ~14 min. All tea types contained all the catechins, at varying 
concentrations, but not all the theaflavins were present in all the tea types. 
This indicates that the theaflavin composition reflects the degree of the 
fermentation and could be used for discrimination among different types of tea. 
All the green tea samples contained all eight catechins; however, the 
concentrations of these compounds varied among the tea samples. Principal 
component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis were useful for 
discrimination of samples. It has been unclear whether the variations of 
chemical components are useful for forensic discrimination. Our results 
demonstrate that, in addition to identification of tea varieties, catechins and 
theaflavins can be used for the discrimination of bottled tea samples.

Hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular-related morbidity and 
mortality worldwide. In recent years, there has been growing interest in 
exploring natural products for managing hypertension, with Moringa oleifera 
emerging as a promising natural candidate for blood pressure regulation. This 
review investigates the anti-hypertensive potential of M. oleifera and its 
bioactive constituents, including moringin, phenolic acids, flavonoids, 
astragalin, and minerals, which have been identified for their vasodilatory, 
antioxidant, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory properties. The 
data was collected from various databases, including ScienceDirect, Google 
Scholar, PubMed, Medline, Elsevier, and Directory of Open Access Journals. 
Essential bioactive components of M. oleifera facilitate vasodilation by 
elevating nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and inhibiting ACE, thereby diminishing 
vascular resistance. Furthermore, M. oleifera demonstrates antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory properties that alleviate endothelial dysfunction, promote 
diuresis by increasing sodium and water excretion, and enhance lipid profiles by 
reducing LDL and triglyceride levels. In addition, the high nutritional content 
of this plant, which includes potassium, magnesium, and calcium, contributes to 
further support cardiovascular health. Additionally, the stability, bioactivity, 
and controlled release of Moringa compounds have been improved by advancements 
in nanoformulation, including green synthesis, lipid-based systems, and 
self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery technologies. These data confirm the 
therapeutic potential of M. oleifera as a supplementary treatment in 
hypertension therapy. Nevertheless, it warrants further investigation to 
elucidate its clinical utility and safety profile.

Production of functional foods containing health promoting phytochemicals is an 
attractive issue in food sector. Activating a plant's defense system by 
different biotic and abiotic stressors boosts the synthesis of bioactive 
metabolites. Using this method could be a solution for producing edible sprouts 
rich in nutraceuticals. Limited studies have been conducted on the production of 
functional legume sprouts using chemical elicitors, while the effect of cold 
plasma as a novel physical elicitor on the synthesis of bioactives in fresh 
sprouts has been neglected. Hence, this research aimed to compare the effect of 
low-pressure plasma (at different power levels and treatment times) and chemical 
elicitors (ascorbic acid, glutamic acid, chitosan, chitosan in glutamic acid, 
and NaCl) on enrichment of lentil sprouts with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), 
phenolic and antioxidant compounds. First, cold-plasma at 30, 40, 50, and 60 
watts was applied to the seeds for 5 and 10 min, then the seeds germinated for 
48 and 72 h. In the second stage, the effect of irrigation of seeds with 
chemical elicitors during 48 h of germination was investigated. The highest 
amount of GABA (1476.26 ppm) was measured in lentil sprouts after plasma 
treatment at 40 watts, 5 min and further germination for 48 h, or irrigation of 
seedlings with chitosan (1425.32 ppm) and ascorbic acid (1427.99 ppm). The 
maximum phenolics content and antioxidant activity were observed at 30 watts, 5 
and 10 min of plasma treatment and 48 h of sprouting respectively. As 
conclusion, both cold-plasma and chemical elicitors were effective in enhancing 
the bioactive content of lentil sprouts. The important point is to optimize the 
conditions of each method to obtain the maximum amount of the desired bioactive 
compounds.

White, blue, red and purple corns (Zea mays L.) were lime-cooked to obtain masa 
for tortillas. The total phenolics and anthocyanins content, antioxidant 
activity expressed as total reducing power (TRP), peroxyl radical bleaching 
(PRAC), total antioxidant activity (TAA) and quinone reductase (QR) induction in 
the murine hepatoma (Hepa 1 c1c7 cell line) as a biological marker for phase II 
detoxification enzymes were investigated. Among the extracts prepared from raw 
corn varieties the highest concentration of total phenolics, anthocyanins, 
antioxidant index and induction of QR-inducing activity were found in the 
Veracruz 42 (Ver 42) genotype. The nixtamalization process (masa) reduced total 
phenolics, anthocyanins and antioxidant activities and the ability for QR 
induction when was compared to raw grain. Processing masa into tortillas also 
negatively affected total phenolics, anthocyanin concentration, antioxidant 
activities, and QR induction in the colored corn varieties. The blue variety and 
its corresponding masa and tortillas did not induce QR. Ver 42 genotype and 
their products (masa and tortilla) showed the greatest antioxidant activity and 
capacity to induce QR.

BACKGROUND: Plum is a nutritionally and medicinally valuable fruit with high 
economic value; however, in temperate regions, its yield continuously suffers 
from bacterial canker caused by Pseudomonas syringae pathovars.
RESULTS: To bridge the research gap, a study was conducted to optimize the use 
of rhizobacteria and biogenic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) for controlling 
bacterial canker in plums. Rhizobacteria were isolated from plum orchards and 
identified (through 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, phylogenetic analysis using MEGA) 
and further evaluated for plant growth-promoting characteristics (siderophore 
production, production of hydrogen cyanide, solubilization of phosphate, and 
biofilm formation). The results revealed that 7 isolates out of 19 
rhizobacterial isolates produced biofilm, of which Rw-1, Rw-6, Rw-7, and Hj-2 
were Pseudomonas fluorescens, while Rw-12 and Hj-5 were identified as Bacillus 
subtilis. Besides, biogenic AgNPs were prepared in different concentrations 
(0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.6%) by using Cannabis sativa plant extract. X-ray diffraction 
(indicated the size of crystalline green silver nanoparticles of ~ 20 nm), 
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (confirmed the presence of alkyne 
molecules, polyphenols, and carbonyl compounds on the AgNPs surface), and 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used for characterization of the 
nanoparticles. Additionally, the antibacterial activity of AgNPs was determined 
by the disk diffusion assay with 18-hour cultures of P. syringae. In vitro 
experiments showed that the highest inhibition zone (24.32 mm) was caused by the 
0.6% AgNPs concentration, proving the strongest antibacterial activity. The 
subsequent glasshouse tests confirmed that a consortium of two strains of 
Bacillus with 0.6% AgNPs allowed the lowest disease incidence (18.13%), proving 
efficient disease suppression. Combination of Bacillus and Pseudomonas strains 
with 0.6% AgNPs recorded significantly higher disease incidence, with the 
probable reason being incompatibility among these bacterial genera.
CONCLUSIONS: The research findings emphasize the potential of applying 
compatible rhizobacterial consortia and biogenic (C. sativa) silver 
nanoparticles as a potent substitute for synthetic pesticides in controlling 
plum bacterial canker.

High-performance liquid chromatography/diode-array detection (HPLC/DAD), 
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC/TOFMS) and quadrupole ion trap mass 
spectrometry (HPLC/QIT-MS) were used for separation, identification and 
structural analysis of lignans in Schisandra chinensis and rat plasma after oral 
administration of the herbal extract. Six lignans in Schisandra chinensis 
extract were identified unambiguously by comparing the retention time, their 
characteristic ultraviolet (UV) absorption and accurate mass measurement. A 
formula database of known lignans in Schisandra chinensis was established, 
against which the other 15 lignans were identified effectively based on the 
accurate extract masses and formulae acquired by HPLC/TOFMS. In order to 
distinguish the isomers, multi-stage mass spectrometry (ion trap mass 
spectrometry, MSn) was also used. The fragmentation behavior of the lignans in 
the ion trap mass spectrometer was studied by the six lignan standards, and 
their fragmentation rules in MSn spectra were summarized. These deduced 
fragmentation rules of lignans were successfully implemented in distinguishing 
the three groups of isomers in Schisandra chinensis by HPLC/QIT-MS. By using the 
three different analytical techniques, 21 lignans in Schisandra chinensis were 
identified within 30 min. After oral administration of the extract, 11 lignans 
in rat plasma were detected and identified by comparing their retention time, 
characteristic UV absorption and accurate mass measurement of peaks in 
HPLC/TOFMS chromatograms of the herbal extract. Finally, HPLC/TOFMS fingerprints 
of Schisandra chinensis in vitro and rat plasma in vivo were established. It is 
concluded that a rapid and effective method based on three analytical techniques 
for identification of chemical components was established, which is useful for 
rapid identification of multiple components in Schisandra chinensis in vitro and 
in vivo. In addition, it can provide help for further pharmacology and action 
mechanism study of lignans in Schisandra chinensis.

Dietary flavonoids: intake, health effects and bioavailability.

Hollman PC(1), Katan MB.

Agricultural Products (RIKILT-DLO), The Netherlands.

Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds that occur ubiquitously in foods of plant 
origin. Over 4000 different flavonoids have been described. They may have 
beneficial health effects because of their antioxidant properties and their 
inhibitory role in various stages of tumour development in animal studies. An 
estimation of the total flavonoid intake is difficult, because only limited data 
on food contents are available. It is estimated that humans ingest a few 
hundreds of milligram per day. The average intake of the subclasses of flavonols 
and flavones in The Netherlands was 23 mg/day. The intake of flavonols and 
flavones was inversely associated with subsequent coronary heart disease in most 
but not all prospective epidemiological studies. A protective effect of 
flavonols on cancer was found in only one prospective study. Flavonoids present 
in foods were considered non-absorbable because they are bound to sugars as 
beta-glycosides. However, we found that human absorption of the quercetin 
glycosides from onions (52%) is far better than that of the pure aglycone (24%). 
Flavonol glycosides might contribute to the antioxidant defences of blood. 
Dietary flavonols and flavones probably do not explain the cancer-protective 
effect of vegetables and fruits; a protective effect against cardiovascular 
disease is not conclusive.

Recent interest in food phenolics has increased greatly, because of their 
antioxidant and free radical scavenging abilities. Popular beverages in the 
world include tea, coffee, cocoa, beer, wine and fruit/vegetable juices. All of 
these beverages contain phenolic compounds. In present study total polyphenol 
content and in vitro antioxidant properties were investigated in 16 red wines, 5 
white wines, 5 lager beers, 3 dark beers, 17 fruit juices and 5 vegetable 
juices. High polyphenol content was measured in red wines (1720 +/- 546 mg x 
L(-1)) and in some fruit juices such as elderberry and prunes (5,680 and 1,807 
mg x L(-1), respectively). The concentration of polyphenols was between 159 and 
5,680 mg x L(-1) in fruit juices and between 255 and 696 mg x L(-1) in vegetable 
ones, while low level of phenolics was observed in dark and lager beers and 
white wines (473, 376 and 392 mg x L(-1), respectively). All samples exhibited 
significant antioxidant properties such as hydrogen-donating ability, reducing 
power, chelating ability and total antioxidant status (TAS) value. These 
antioxidant properties strongly correlated with the total polyphenol content of 
the beverages.

Juice made from sea-buckthorn berries (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) is a valuable 
source of bioactive compounds, vitamins, as well as micro- and macronutrients. 
By applying defatted sea-buckthorn juice, it is possible to enhance wheat beer 
and change its sensory properties and the contents of bioactive compounds in the 
finished product. A sensory assessment showed that wheat beers with a 5% v/v 
addition of sea-buckthorn juice were characterised by a balanced taste and aroma 
(overall impression). Physicochemical analyses showed that, compared to the 
control samples, wheat beers enhanced with defatted sea-buckthorn juice at a 
rate of 5% v/v or 10% v/v had high total acidity with respective mean values of 
5.30 and 6.88 (0.1 M NaOH/100 mL), energy values lower on average by 4.04% and 
8.35%, respective polyphenol contents of 274.1 mg GAE/L and 249.7 mg GAE/L, as 
well as higher antioxidant activity (measured using DPPH, FRAP, and ABTS 
assays). The findings show that the samples of wheat beer enhanced with 
sea-buckthorn juice had average ascorbic acid contents of 2.5 and 4.5 mg/100 mL 
(in samples with 5% v/v and 10% v/v additions, respectively) and contained 
flavone glycosides, e.g., kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide-7-O-hexoside. Based on the 
current findings, it can be concluded that wheat beer enhanced with 
sea-buckthorn juice could emerge as a new trend in the brewing industry.

Cocoa products are obtained from the seeds of Theobroma cacao L. In this 
research, cocoa liquor and chocolate produced from cocoa beans from West Africa 
(Forastero, ""bulk"" cacao) and Ecuador (Nacional variety, ""fine-flavor"" cacao), 
were investigated, using a novel approach in which various analytical techniques 
are combined in order to obtain in-depth knowledge of the studied cocoa samples. 
The levels of various classes of primary metabolites were determined and a wide 
range of secondary metabolites, including volatile organic acids, aldehydes, 
esters, pyrazines, polyphenols, methylxanthines and biogenic amines, were 
identified and/or quantified by HS-SPME GC-MS (headspace-solid phase 
microextraction gas chromatography - mass spectrometry). and UPLC-HRMS 
(ultra-performance liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry). 
Odor Activity Values (OAV) were calculated to assess the contribution of 
individual volatiles on the final aroma. Various volatile aroma compounds were 
more abundant in the West African cocoa liquor and chocolate, while the 
Ecuadorian samples were richer in most quantified non-volatile metabolites. 
Principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed that the four samples can be 
clearly distinguished. Alcohols, pyrazines, amino acids and biogenic amines were 
found to be highly influential in causing this differentiation. The proposed 
approach can be useful in future studies on more extensive cocoa sample 
collections, in order to highlight similarities and pinpoint typical differences 
in chemical composition among these samples.

Sample preparation is often overlooked and is frequently considered as ""a means 
to an end"". This systematic study with a phenolic-enriched substrate, eggplant 
(Solanum melongena L.), was undertaken to evaluate the substantial variations in 
the extraction techniques, solvents, and parameters as described in the 
published literature. Direct comparison of over 10 extraction procedures or 
conditions was performed to show the importance and influence of sample 
preparation on the assay of phenolic compounds. Chlorogenic acid (CA) was the 
most abundant phenolic acid accounting for >75% of the total phenolic acids 
content extracted from the eggplant sample. Optimum extraction of CA and total 
phenolics (TP) from Black Bell cultivar of eggplant were obtained when 
extractions were performed with a mixture of MeOH/H2O at a ratio of 80:20% v/v 
using a pressurized liquid extractor (PLE) at 100 degrees C. The amount of CA 
and TP extracted from eggplant by the previously reported procedures using a 
wrist shaker, rotary shaker, stirring, sonication, or reflux with different 
extraction solvents (acetone or varying composition of MeOH/H2O solvent 
mixtures) varied significantly between 5 and 95% as compared to PLE. The 
predominant phenolic acids in the free phenolic acid fraction of Black Beauty 
cultivar of eggplant were CA isomers. However, caffeic acid isomers were the 
major phenolic acids extracted from the base-hydrolyzed fraction. The total 
amount of caffeic acid extracted from the Italian Neon cultivar was more that 
twice that of four other eggplant cultivars (Orient Express, Calliope Zebra 
Stripe, Orient Charm Neon, and Black Beauty).

This study investigates the extraction of phenolic compounds and antioxidant 
activity from spent coffee ground (SCG) and coffee cherry pulp (CCP) using 
subcritical water extraction combined with high-pressure carbon dioxide (CO₂). 
The objective was to optimize extraction conditions to maximize total phenolic 
content (TPC) and DPPH radical scavenging activity. Using Design Expert V.13 and 
Central Composite Design (CCD), key parameters including extraction time 
(30-60 min), temperature (180-220 °C), and solid-to-water ratio 
(0.024-0.027 g/mL) were systematically analyzed. The optimal conditions for SCG 
were determined to be 198 °C, 0.027 g/mL solid-to-water ratio, and 60 min, 
yielding a TPC of 217.26 mg GAE/g DW and a DPPH value of 23.28 µMol TE/g DW. For 
CCP, the best extraction conditions were 189 °C, 0.024 g/mL solid-to-water 
ratio, and 54 min, resulting in a TPC of 230.13 mg GAE/g DW and a DPPH value of 
32.63 µMol TE/g DW. The results indicate that CCP exhibited higher phenolic 
content and antioxidant activity than SCG, emphasizing its potential for 
valorization. Furthermore, Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS) and Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) analyses confirmed the presence 
of bioactive compounds such as quinic acid, theobromine, and caffeine. These 
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of subcritical water and CO₂ extraction 
in enhancing the recovery of bioactive compounds from coffee byproducts. This 
optimized method provides a sustainable and solvent-free approach to extracting 
high-value phenolic compounds, with potential applications in functional food, 
nutraceutical, and pharmaceutical industries.

This study aimed to evaluate the physico-chemical, nutritional, antioxidant, and 
anti-inflammatory properties of Garcinia pedunculata fruit powders obtained from 
different drying methods to explore their potential use in health-promoting 
functional foods. The fruits were processed at mature and ripe stages. Molecular 
modeling studies were also performed to find effective inhibitors from G. 
pedunculata fruit against inflammatory targets. Among the drying methods, the 
hot-air oven drying method was found to be most effective in reducing moisture 
content and water activity, while freeze-drying resulted in better color 
retention and the highest antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The 
mature fruit powders showed better results than the ripe fruit powders in most 
of the analyzed parameters, such as lowest moisture content (13.87 %) and water 
activity (0.477 aw) indicating better shelf life, highest TPC (9.58 mg GAE/g), 
TFC (5.05 mg QE/g), antioxidant (IC50: 300.02 µg/mL), and anti-inflammatory 
(IC50:163.46 µg/mL) activities. The processed fruit powders had high levels of 
crude fiber (5.95-10.18 %) and good amounts of minerals (Na, Ca, K, Mg, Fe, Mn, 
Zn, Cu). The molecular modeling studies revealed that the compounds garcinol and 
isogarcinol exhibited the highest binding affinities (-9.6 kcal/mol and 
-8.8 kcal/mol, respectively) and stability against the target Cyclooxygenase-2 
(COX-2) responsible for inflammation compared to other compounds. Moreover, 
these compounds exhibited better pharmacokinetic qualities and may serve as 
promising bioactive components for preventing inflammation-related diseases. The 
findings underscored the promising potential of G. pedunculata powders as a 
viable active ingredient in functional foods with anti-inflammatory properties.

Oxidative stress has been widely believed to be the mechanism responsible for 
developing diseases such as arthritis, asthma, dementia, and aging. Solanum 
nigrum Linn. is a common edible medicinal herb that belongs to the family 
Solanaceae which has more than 180 chemical components that have so far been 
discovered. The main bioactive components of these are steroidal saponins, 
alkaloids, phenols, and polysaccharides. This article presents comparative 
phytochemical profiling including total phenolic, total flavonoid, alkaloid, 
proanthocyanidins, tannin, and vitamin C contents of three Algerian S. nigrum 
samples collected from three different locations in the Algerian desert. 
Additionally, the potential antioxidant activity of the three samples was 
assessed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, ferric reducing antioxidant power, 
and oxidative hemolysis inhibition assay. Moreover, the correlation between the 
major phenolic phytoconstituents previously reported and isolated from the plant 
and antioxidant activity has also been done by in silico molecular docking. Ten 
bioactive compounds were docked with selected proteins, 
arachidonate-5-lipoxygenase (PDB: 6n2w) and cytochrome c peroxidase (PDB: 2x08), 
to check their affinity with binding sites of these proteins for the possible 
mechanism of action. The docking scores suggest that S. nigrum's quercetin and 
kaempferol may play a significant role in its antioxidant action.

The increasing demand for eco-friendly and biologically active nanomaterials has 
emphasized the need for sustainable nanoparticle synthesis methods. In this 
study, zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) were synthesized using Atropa 
belladonna root extract and evaluated for their biological efficacy. 
Phytochemical screening confirmed the presence of alkaloids, saponins, phenols, 
flavonoids, and diterpenes. UV-Vis spectroscopy indicated the involvement of 
phytoconstituents in NP reduction and stabilization, with a characteristic 
absorption peak at 376 nm and a bandgap energy of 3.30 eV. Structural and 
morphological characterization via FT-IR, XRD, and FESEM revealed the presence 
of functional groups, a hexagonal wurtzite crystalline structure, and spherical 
particles (20-60 nm) with an average crystalline size of 27.9 nm. EDX analysis 
confirmed the elemental purity of Zn and O. In antioxidant assays, the 
green-synthesized ZnO NPs exhibited superior activity compared to the crude 
extract, with lower IC50 values for DPPH (437.47 μg/mL), ABTS (486.31 μg/mL), 
FRAP (717.97 μg/mL), and TAC (394.86 μg/mL). The root extract showed moderate 
antibacterial activity in a concentration-dependent manner, with maximum 
inhibition at 1000 mg (22 ± 0.5 mm against E. coli and S. aureus, and 20 ± 1.5 
mm against P. aeruginosa). In contrast, ZnO NPs exhibited significantly stronger 
antibacterial effects even at lower concentrations, producing inhibition zones 
of 30 ± 1.0 mm against E. coli, 30 ± 0.5 mm against S. aureus, and 30 ± 1.0 mm 
against P. aeruginosa at 100 mg/mL. These results confirm that ZnO NPs possessed 
broad-spectrum antibacterial activity with superior efficacy over the crude 
extract against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Insecticidal 
bioassays demonstrated 99 ± 0.5% mortality in Drosophila melanogaster and 
extended development time (12 ± 1.3 days). Cytotoxicity assays against PC-3 
cells revealed significant anticancer activity, with GI50 values of 172.36 μg/mL 
(extract) and 10.438 μg/mL (ZnO NPs), accompanied by apoptotic features and 
elevated ROS generation (32.6%). These results highlight the multifunctional 
potential of A. belladonna-derived ZnO NPs in therapeutic and agricultural 
applications.

A highly sensitive and specific electrospray ionization (ESI) liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method for quantitation of 
naringenin (NAR) and an explanation for the double peaks phenomenon was 
developed and validated. NAR was extracted from rat plasma and tissues along 
with the internal standard (IS), hesperidin, with ethyl acetate. The analytes 
were analyzed in the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode as the 
precursor/product ion pair of m/z 273.4/151.3 for NAR and m/z 611.5/303.3 for 
the IS. The assay was linear over the concentration range of 5-2500 ng/mL. The 
lower limit quantification was 5 ng/mL, available for plasma pharmacokinetics of 
NAR in rats. Accuracy in within- and between-run precisions showed good 
reproducibility. When NAR was administered orally, only little and predominantly 
its glucuronidation were into circulation in the plasma. There existed double 
peaks phenomenon in plasma concentration-time curve leading to the relatively 
slow elimination of NAR in plasma. The results showed that there was a linear 
relationship between the AUC of total NAR and dosages. And the double peaks are 
mainly due to enterohepatic circulation.

High-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode array and 
electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (MS) detection was used to study 
phenolic compounds in berries of black, green, red, and white currants (Ribes 
spp.). UV-visible spectrometry was a valuable tool for the identification of the 
class of the phenolic compound, whereas MS and MS-MS fragmentation data were 
useful for further structural characterization. Distinct similarities were found 
in the relative distribution of conjugated forms of phenolic compounds among the 
four currants. Phenolic acids were found mainly as hexose esters. Flavonol 
glycosides and anthocyanin pigments were mainly found as 3-O-rutinosides and 
second as 3-O-glucosides. However, cyanidin 3-O-sambubioside and quercetin 
hexoside-malonate were notable phenolic compounds in red currant. Flavonol 
hexoside-malonates were identified and quantified in the berries of currants for 
the first time.

High-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode array and 
electrospray ionization mass spectrometric detection was used to study soluble 
and insoluble forms of phenolic compounds in strawberries, raspberries (red and 
yellow cultivated and red wild), arctic bramble, and cloudberries. 
Hydroxycinnamic acids were present as free forms in cloudberries and mainly as 
sugar esters in the other berries. Quercetin 3-glucuronide was the typical 
flavonol glycoside in all of the berries studied. The composition of the 
predominant anthocyanins can be used to distinguish the studied red Rubus 
species from each other since cyanidin was glycosylated typically with 
3-sophorose (56%) in cultivated red raspberry, with 3-sophorose (30%) and 
3-glucose (27%) in wild red raspberry, and with 3-rutinose (80%) in arctic 
bramble. Ellagic acid was present as free and glycosylated forms and as 
ellagitannins of varying degrees of polymerization. Comparable levels of 
ellagitannins were obtained by the analysis of soluble ellagitannins as gallic 
acid equivalents and by the analysis of ellagic acid equivalents released by 
acid hydrolysis of the extracts.

Mango (Mangifera indica L.) cultivars display a wide range of ripe flesh 
colours, from deep-orange to pale-yellow, largely linked to differences in 
carotenoid profiles. This study examined the relationship between carotenoid 
profile and flesh colour across 25 mango cultivars. Flesh colour was measured 
using chroma (intensity) and hue angle (colour) and correlated with carotenoid 
content quantified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with 
diode-array detection (UHPLC-DAD). Chroma and hue angle displayed a second-order 
inverse polynomial relationship with chroma increasing as hue angle decreased. 
At lower hue angles, a wider range of chroma values was observed. Regression 
analysis showed that chroma correlated most strongly with total carotenoid 
concentration (TCC) (R2 = 0.54), followed by total orange carotenoid 
concentration (R2 = 0.47) and all-trans β-carotene concentration (R2 = 0.45). 
Hue angle correlated most strongly with the total orange carotenoid 
concentration (R2 = 0.76), then all-trans β-carotene concentration (R2 = 0.73) 
and TCC (R2 = 0.64). Interestingly, pale-yellow cultivars often exhibited low 
carotenoid concentrations, high titratable acidity and low soluble solids, 
suggesting incomplete ripening may also contribute to their pale colouration. 
These results provide insight into carotenoid-colour relationships and offer 
direction for phytochemical-based breeding programmes targeting mango flesh 
colour traits.

Common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are a nutritionally valuable crop with high 
levels of bioactive compounds, including phenolics with antioxidant and 
antibacterial properties. However, the functional potential of local Chilean 
landraces remains underexplored. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) can 
influence plant metabolism, enhancing the accumulation of secondary metabolites. 
This study evaluates the effect of PGPB (Bacillus proteolyticus Cyn1, Bacillus 
safensis Cyn2, and their consortium) on the total phenolic content (TPC), 
antioxidant capacity, and antibacterial activity of extracts from the Chilean 
landrace 'Sapito'. For this, 'Sapito' bean seeds were inoculated with individual 
PGPB strains and their consortium and cultivated under field conditions. 
Extracts from the seed coat and cotyledons were obtained using water, ethanol, 
and acetone. TPC was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu method, antioxidant 
activity was assessed via DPPH, ABTS, H₂O₂ scavenging, ferrous ion chelation, 
and FRAP assays, while antibacterial activity was evaluated through agar 
diffusion, growth inhibition, and cell viability assays against Gram positive 
Bacillus cereus and Gram negative Pseudomonas putida. PGPB inoculation 
significantly influenced TPC, with consortium-treated seeds accumulating higher 
phenolic content in aqueous extracts (95.9 ± 27.8 mg GAE/100 g dry seed). 
Antioxidant activity varied across treatments and solvents, with ethanolic and 
acetone extracts displaying the highest radical scavenging activities. 
Antibacterial assays revealed that ethanolic seed coat extracts exhibited 
stronger inhibition against B. cereus. In conclusion, this is the first study 
evaluating the impact of PGPB on the functional properties of a Chilean common 
bean landrace. The findings highlight the potential of microbial inoculation to 
enhance phenolic accumulation and bioactivity, supporting sustainable 
agriculture, food security, and germplasm conservation in the face of climate 
change.

A method was developed to determine the flavanols prodelphinidin B3, procyanidin 
B3, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin by high-performance liquid chromatography, 
using dual-channel electrochemical detection. This method was especially suited 
to the direct analysis of beer samples and to analysis of acetone extracts of 
barley samples, and was capable of determining proanthocyanidins and catechins 
at levels of 0.1-5.0 mg l-1. The use of dual-channel electrochemical detection 
also enabled unambiguous peak identification by measurement of collection 
efficiencies. This method offered improved sensitivity and selectivity compared 
with ultraviolet detection, and sample preparation procedures were greatly 
simplified. The method was applied to the comparison of stabilized and 
unstabilized lagers, and to the analysis of different barley varieties grown in 
Ireland.

Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume is an important spice and aromatic crop having wide 
applications in flavoring, perfumery, beverages, and medicines. The 
steam-distilled volatile oil from cinnamon fruit stalks was analyzed with GC and 
GC-MS. It showed the presence of hydrocarbons (44.7%) and oxygenated compounds 
(52.6%). Twenty-seven compounds constituting ca. 95.98% of the volatile oil were 
characterized. (E)-Cinnamyl acetate (36.59%) and (E)-caryophyllene (22.36%) are 
found to be major compounds. The volatile oil was screened for its potential as 
an antioxidant by using in vitro models, such as the beta-carotene-linoleate and 
phosphomolybdenum complex method. The volatile oil showed 55.94% and 66.9% 
antioxidant activity at 100 and 200 ppm concentration, respectively. Also, the 
volatile oil showed good antioxidant capacity, using the formation of the 
phosphomolybdenum complex. A comparison of the chemical composition of the 
volatile oil was made with that of buds, flowers, and fruits. This is the first 
report on the chemical composition of volatile oil of the fruit stalks of this 
species and its antioxidant activity.

The aromas of three espresso coffee (EC) samples from different botanical 
varieties and types of roast (Arabica coffee, Robusta natural blend, and Robusta 
Torrefacto blend (special roast by adding sugar)) were studied by static 
headspace GC-MS and sensory flavor profile analysis. Seventy-seven compounds 
were identified in all of the EC samples. Among them, 13 key odorants have been 
quantified and correlated with their flavor notes by applying multivariate 
statistical methods. Some correlations have been found in the EC samples: some 
aldehydes with fruity flavors, diones with buttery flavors, and pyrazines with 
earthy/musty, roasty/burnt, and woody/papery flavors. By applying principal 
component analysis (PCA), Arabica and Robusta samples were separated 
successfully by principal component 1 (60.7% of variance), and Torrefacto and 
Natural Robusta EC samples were separated by principal component 2 (28.1% of 
total variance). With PCA, the aroma characterization of each EC sample could be 
observed. A very simple discriminant function using some key odorants was 
obtained by discriminant analysis, allowing the classification of each EC sample 
into its respective group with a success rate of 100%.

Cardiometabolic complications related to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are 
often due to changes in the gut microbiota. The review analyzed studies looking 
at the effects of probiotics, prebiotics, high-fiber diets, and fecal microbiota 
transplantation (FMT) on glucose levels and heart and metabolic health in 
individuals either having T2DM or being at risk. The review followed the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines. The 
literature was searched using text terms and controlled vocabulary, employing 
Boolean operators ""AND,"" ""OR,"" and various combinations across PubMed, Embase, 
and the Cochrane Library. Open-access, full-text English papers from 2005 to 
2025, including those authored by people, were searched. The quality was 
assessed using the Risk of Bias 2.0 (RoB 2.0) tool, and the evidence was 
appraised using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and 
Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Fifteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were 
analyzed for methodological quality, with three categorized as having a high 
risk of bias (RoB). The GRADE tool categorized two high RoB RCTs as ""low 
quality."" However, two RCTs had low RoB and were classified as ""high quality."" 
Ten RCTs had uncertain RoB, lowering the evidence by one point to ""moderate 
quality."" A comprehensive review of RCTs was conducted to assess outcomes 
related to glycemic parameters (e.g., glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting 
glucose), lipid profiles, inflammatory markers, anthropometric measures, and gut 
microbiota composition. Interventions included probiotic and prebiotic 
supplementation, high-fiber or Mediterranean-style diets, and FMT. Probiotic 
yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis 
significantly improved lipid profiles by reducing low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol. High-fiber diets consistently lowered 
fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, triglycerides, and LDL-C while elevating 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and beneficial short-chain fatty 
acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria. Anti-inflammatory effects were observed across 
interventions, notably with probiotics and polyphenol-rich Mediterranean diets, 
which reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and 
other inflammatory cytokines. The Green-Mediterranean diet significantly 
improved weight, insulin resistance, and Framingham risk scores. Novel 
mechanisms involving SCFAs and bile acid metabolism were also identified as key 
modulators of host metabolic response. Microbiota-based interventions offer 
promising avenues for glycemic control and cardiometabolic risk reduction in 
patients with T2DM.

Acetylferulic paeonol ester (APE) and ferulic paeonol ester (FPE) were 
synthesized, and their structures were confirmed by NMR, mass spectra, IR and 
UV-vis data. The antioxidant properties of the synthesized compounds were 
evaluated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and [(2-azino-bis 
(3-ethylbenzthiazoline)-6 -sulfonic acid] (ABTS) assay as well as the production 
of oxidation products (peroxides, conjugated dienes, thiobarbituric 
acid-reactive substances, free fatty acids and total aldehydes) in an elevated 
temperature (60 °C) storage trial of fish oil extracted from anchovy. 
Furthermore, the changes in fatty acid composition were monitored by gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that APE was more effective 
in restraining fish oil oxidation compared to FPE, ferulic acid, paeonol and the 
commercial antioxidant-butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). This study demonstrated 
molecular combinations obtained by covalent bonding two antioxidant active 
molecules can result in novel compounds with enhanced antioxidant activities.

INTRODUCTION: Unintended wounding or bruising during harvest or postharvest 
handling leads to significant tuber loss and imposes economic burden to potato 
industry. Therefore, finding effective strategies to mitigate wound-related 
tuber losses is very important from industry perspectives. Formation of 
protective barrier through accumulation of suberin polyphenolics (SPP) is a 
natural and initial response of potato tuber tissues to wounding.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, efficacy of two natural elicitors, such as 
chitosan oligosaccharide (COS 0.125 g L-1) and cranberry pomace residue 
(Nutri-Cran 0.125 g L-1) was investigated using a mechanically wounded tuber 
tissue model and by histological determination of SPP formation in five 
agronomically relevant and red-skin potato cultivars (Chieftain, Dakota Rose, 
Dakota Ruby, Red LaSoda, Red Norland). Furthermore, the potential role of stress 
protective metabolic regulation involving phenolic metabolites, proline, and 
antioxidant enzymes in tuber WH processes were also investigated during 0-9 days 
after wounding.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Exogenous treatments of both COS and Nutri-Cran resulted 
into enhanced SPP formation in wounded surface, but the impact was more rapid 
with Nutri-Cran treatment in select cultivars. Greater contents of total soluble 
phenolic, ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid, total antioxidant activity, and 
superoxide dismutase activity were also observed in elicitor treated tuber 
tissues at different time points after wounding. Nutri-Cran treatment also 
reduced the activity of succinate dehydrogenase in Red Norland and Dakota Ruby 
at 3 d, indicating a suppression in respiration rate. Collectively, these 
results suggest that Nutri-Cran can be potentially utilized as an effective WH 
treatment to potato tubers for minimizing wound-related losses.

Our study reports the triglyceride (triacylglycerol, TAG) composition of five 
new Tunisian virgin olive oil cultivars obtained through controlled crossings of 
the cultivar (cv.) Chemlali Sfax. These cultivars have been selected among a 
progeny of 500 olive descendants, based on an evaluation of the fatty-acid (FA) 
composition of their oils. Among these samples, two were derived from the 
crossing with the cv. Sigoise as pollinator (SM634) or pollen acceptor (SM1110) 
and the others from the crossing with the cv. Meski as pollen acceptor (SM513, 
SM514, and SM517). The five descendants were characterized by a good fat value, 
a balanced FA composition, and a high content of triolein, varying between 26.9 
(SM514) and 45.46% (SM1110). They had an improved FA composition as compared to 
that of the cv. Chemlali Sfax and their fruits were slightly bigger. The 
principal component analysis suggested that the TAG variables were more suitable 
than the total FAs for an optimum classification of the cultivar samples 
analyzed. The cultivars obtained through the crossing with the cv. Sigoise (as 
pollen acceptor or pollinator) had a more favorable composition of FAs and TAG 
than those obtained through the crossing with the cv. Meski, which indicated 
that genetic factors had the most important influence on the quality of the 
virgin olive oils.

Phenolic compounds in 46 Spanish cider apple varieties were determined by 
RP-HPLC with direct injection. Several pattern recognition procedures, including 
principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and 
partial least squares (PLS-1), were applied to the data in an attempt to 
classify the samples into bitter and nonbitter categories. Reliable decision 
rules were obtained by both LDA and PLS-1. LDA achieved 91.3 and 85.7% correct 
classification respectively, for internal and external evaluation of the model.

Brassica rapa L. is a nutrient-rich plant that plays an integral role in the 
traditional Algerian diet. This study aimed to evaluate the proximate 
composition of its powdered roots and to characterize the phytochemical profile 
of the root extract (BME) using HPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis. Furthermore, the 
antioxidant activity of the extract was assessed through DPPH•, ABTS•+, FRAP, 
and O-phenanthroline assays. The extract exhibited moderate antioxidant activity 
compared to the employed standards. Quantitative analysis revealed high 
concentrations of total phenolics (272.43 ± 2.00 µg GAE/mg extract) and 
flavonoids (32.68 ± 0.1 µg QE/mg extract). The BME also demonstrated significant 
inhibition of α-amylase (IC50 > 400 µg/mL), and strong urease inhibition 
(IC50 = 6.68 ± 1.65 µg/mL). In addition, in silico analysis predicted the 
drug-likeness of taxifolin, a flavonoid identified in the studied extract. This 
research represents the first comprehensive study on the B. rapa L. extract, 
integrating both an in silico approach and an in vitro urease inhibition assay, 
thereby underscoring its potential as a valuable nutritional plant.

PURPOSE: Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), an anthocyanin component of fruits and 
berries, possesses cancer chemopreventive properties in mouse models of 
carcinogenesis. Its pharmacokinetics and metabolism in mice have hitherto not 
been studied.
METHODS: C57BL6J mice received C3G by either gavage at 500 mg/kg or tail vein 
injection at 1 mg/kg. Blood, urine, bile and heart, lung, kidney, liver, 
prostate, brain and gastrointestinal (gi) mucosal tissues were obtained up to 2 
h after administration. Levels of C3G and its anthocyanin metabolites were 
determined by HPLC with visible detection. Metabolites were identified by 
LC/MS/MS.
RESULTS: After oral administration peak concentrations of anthocyanins occurred 
within 30 min after administration. Levels were highest in the urine and gi 
mucosa. In the gi mucosa and liver the predominant flavonoid species after oral 
administration was C3G, whilst after iv dosing the majority of anthocyanins was 
C3G metabolites. After oral or iv administration, C3G half-lives in the 
different biofluids and tissues ranged from 0.7 to 1.8 h and 0.3 to 0.7 h, 
respectively. Systemic bioavailabilities for parent C3G and total anthocyanins 
were 1.7 and 3.3%, respectively. The major metabolites of C3G were products of 
methylation and glucuronidation. Cyanidin was a minor metabolite in the gut.
CONCLUSION: C3G and its metabolites were recovered from murine tissues which may 
be targets for cancer chemopreventive intervention. Anthocyanin levels achieved 
in the gi mucosa, prostate and the kidneys were of an order of magnitude 
consistent with pharmacological activity.

Pharmacokinetics of trans-resveratrol in its aglycone (RES(AGL)) and glucuronide 
(RES(GLU)) forms were studied following intravenous (15 mg/kg i.v.) and oral (50 
mg/kg p.o.) administration of trans-resveratrol in a solution of 
beta-cyclodextrin to intact rats. In addition, the enterohepatic recirculation 
of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) was assessed in a linked-rat model. Multiple plasma and 
urine samples were collected and concentrations of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) were 
determined using an electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
spectrometry method. After i.v. administration, plasma concentrations of 
RES(AGL) declined with a rapid elimination half-life (T(1/2), 0.13 h), followed 
by sudden increases in plasma concentrations 4 to 8 h after drug administration. 
These plasma concentrations resulted in a significant prolongation of the 
terminal elimination half-life of RES(AGL) (T(1/2TER), 1.31 h). RES(AGL) and 
RES(GLU) also displayed sudden increases in plasma concentrations 4 to 8 h after 
oral administration, with T(1/2TER) of 1.48 and 1.58 h, respectively. RES(AGL) 
bioavailability was 38% and its exposure was approximately 46-fold lower than 
that of RES(GLU) (AUC(inf), 7.1 versus 324.7 micromol.h/l). Enterohepatic 
recirculation was confirmed in the linked-rat model since significant plasma 
concentrations of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) were observed in bile-recipient rats at 
4 to 8 h. The percentages of the exposures of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) that were 
due to enterohepatic recirculation were 24.7 and 24.0%, respectively. The 
fraction of drug excreted in the urine over a period of 12 h was negligible. 
These results confirm that RES(AGL) is bioavailable and undergoes extensive 
first-pass glucuronidation, and that enterohepatic recirculation contributes 
significantly to the exposure of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) in rats.

Sweet peppers (Capsicum annuum L.) cv. Vergasa have been studied at four 
maturity stages (immature green, green, immature red, and red). The individual 
phenolics (hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids), vitamin C (ascorbic acid and 
dehydroascorbic acid), and individual carotenoids were characterized and 
quantified. Five hydroxycinnamic derivatives and 23 flavonoids were 
characterized and quantified from the pericarp of sweet pepper by 
high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray 
ionization-mass spectrometry. Identification was carried out by their UV 
spectra, chromatographic comparisons with authentic markers, identification of 
hydrolysis products, and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Hydroxycinnamic 
derivatives, O-glycosides of quercetin, luteolin, and chrysoeriol, and a large 
number of C-glycosyl flavones have been characterized. Some of these compounds 
were found for the first time in nature. Clear differences in the individual and 
total phenolic content were detected between the different maturity stages. 
Immature green pepper had a very high phenolic content while green, immature 
red, and red ripe peppers showed a 4-5-fold reduction. Ascorbic acid was the 
main form of vitamin C, and its content increased as the pepper reached 
maturity. The red ripe stage had a relevant impact on the carotenoids content. 
Thus, immature green peppers showed the highest content of polyphenols, while 
red ripe fruits had the highest content of vitamin C and provitamin A.

The phloretin-O-glycosides, phloretin-2'-O-glucoside and 
phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside, are thought to be unique to apples and 
apple products. To investigate the metabolism and bioavailability of these 
compounds, nine healthy and five ileostomy human subjects consumed 500 mL of 
Thatchers Redstreak apple cider containing 46 micromol of 
phloretin-O-glycosides. Over the ensuing 24 h period, plasma, urine, and ileal 
fluid were collected prior to analysis by high-performance liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The sole metabolite present in 
quantifiable amounts in plasma was phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, which reached a 
peak concentration (C(max)) of 73 nmol/L and 0.6 h after ingestion (T(max)) with 
the healthy subjects, and statistically similar values were obtained with the 
ileostomy volunteers. Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide was also detected in urine 
along with two additional phloretin-O-glucuronides and a 
phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate. The quantity of phloretin metabolites 
excreted in urine represented 5.0 + or - 0.9% of intake in healthy volunteers 
and 5.5 + or - 0.6% in ileostomy volunteers. The similarity in the excretion 
levels of the two groups and the rapid plasma T(max) indicate absorption of the 
dihydrochalcones in the small intestine. Of the two major phloretin-O-glycosides 
in cider, only phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside was recovered in ileal 
fluid in quantities corresponding to 22% of intake. The absence of 
phloretin-2'-O-glucoside in ileal fluid suggests that it is more readily 
absorbed than phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside. 
Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, two other phloretin-O-glucuronides, one 
phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate, two phloretin-O-sulfates, and the aglycone 
phloretin were also detected in the ileal fluid. This implies that the wall of 
the small intestine contains beta-glycosidase, sulfuryltransferase, and 
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities and that, as well as being absorbed, 
sizable amounts of the phloretin metabolites that are formed efflux back into 
the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. The overall recovery of the 
dihydrochalcones and their metabolites in the ileal fluid was equivalent to 
38.6% of intake.

Onions (Allium cepa) are consumed worldwide and represent an important source of 
dietary phytochemicals with proven antioxidant properties, such as phenolic 
acids, flavonoids, thiosulfinates, and anthocyanins. Epidemiological and 
experimental data suggest that regular consumption of onions is associated with 
a reduced risk of degenerative disorders. Therefore, it is of interest to 
investigate the biological properties of different varieties of onions. Here, we 
characterized for the first time a variety of onion, called Ramata di Montoro 
(coppery onion from Montoro), grown in a niche area in southern Italy, and 
compared its phenolic profile and antioxidant properties to a commercial ecotype 
of red onion, Tropea, also present in southern Italy. An analytical method based 
on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with UV detection and mass 
spectrometry was used to separate and characterize the phenolic fraction 
(anthocyanins and flavonols) extracted from both coppery and red types. The main 
compounds detected in the two ecotypes were quercetin and quercetin glucosides, 
isorhamnetin glucosides, kaempferol glucoside, and, among anthocyanins, cyanidin 
glucosides. Tropea ecotype onion showed a higher content of flavonols (632.82 
mg/kg fresh weight) than Montoro type onion (252.91 mg/kg fresh weight). 
Accordingly, the antioxidant activity of the former was 2.8-fold higher compared 
to the latter. More pronounced were the differences existing between the four 
anthocyanins detected in the two ecotypes, with those in the Tropea ecotype 
onion present at concentrations 20-230-fold higher than in the Montoro type 
onion. Both extracts reduced LDL oxidation about 6-fold and protected human 
erythrocytes from oxidative damage induced by HClO by about 40%. In addition, as 
a consequence of HClO treatment, glutathione concentration in erythrocytes was 
reduced about 50% and pretreatment with onion extracts induced a recovery of 
glutathione level by about 15-22%. Qualitative differences highlighted in the 
chemical composition of the two phenolic extracts, especially the total content 
of anthocyanins, which was 30-fold higher in Montoro type onion compared to 
Tropea ecotype, can be associated with the protective effects measured against 
oxidative damage induced in human erythrocytes.

A rainfed control and two treatments receiving a water depth equivalent to 33 and 66% of the estimated crop evapotranspiration (ETc) from the pit hardening stage and a treatment with 66% of ETc during the entire season (25 May‐4 October), were tested. Olive vigour increased with irrigation, which also induced a fresh yield enhancement, mainly due to the increase in fruit size. The differences between treatments were less evident for fruit number per tree and pulp/stone ratio. The phenolic content increased in water deficit‐stressed olives and differences were detected in the concentrations of individual phenolic compounds. Olive oil content and fatty acids composition appeared scarcely affected by irrigation. Values of pH, acidity, sugars, phenolic composition and microbial population were monitored during olive fermentation. Extracts of freshly harvested olive fruits exhibited significantly higher phenolic content than extracts of processed olives. The interaction of irrigation and fermentation appeared to have a significant effect on the chemical and sensory characteristics of the end product. The bitter taste of olive fruit was positively correlated with the level of total phenolics, but negatively correlated with the overall acceptability for direct consumption. The fermentation process was accelerated in the presence of lactic acid bacteria inoculants, indicating the potential use of these microorganisms as quality control markers in table olives during processing.

Traditional methods for fruit juice preservation use high temperatures, which 
degrade beneficial compounds like vitamins and antioxidants. Membrane filtration 
provides a gentler alternative, preserving nutrients through mild operating 
temperatures. This study assessed the temperature and pressure influence on 
watermelon juice microfiltration, focusing on permeated flow, lycopene, sugars, 
phenolic compounds, and flavonoids. Using a 22 composite design with central 
values, optimal conditions were determined by the desirability function, with 
pressure at 1.0 bar and temperature at 37ºC, maximizing these response 
variables. Resistance to permeated flux was primarily due to fouling, with an 
initial 25% flux reduction. The process effectively concentrated lycopene, 
sugars, phenolic compounds, and flavonoids, although mineral content decreased 
in both concentrated and permeated juice, with potassium being the most abundant 
mineral. The concentrated juice showed greater mineral loss than pasteurized due 
to retention during microfiltration. Under optimized conditions, microbial load 
reduction allowed the concentrated juice a shelf life comparable to pasteurized 
juice (14 days). Sensory analysis showed strong consumer acceptance, with 64% of 
tasters expressing purchase intent. These results suggest commercial viability 
for the concentrated juice; moreover, its high carotenoid retention could serve 
as an industrial ingredient for functional foods.

In this study, the antioxidant and chemosensory properties of rice bran were 
evaluated under different oven-roasting temperatures (160 °C, 180 °C, and 
200 °C) and durations (5 min, 10 min, and 15 min). The γ-oryzanol and total 
phenolic contents initially increased in raw rice bran but decreased with 
increasing roasting levels, whereas total flavonoid content initially decreased 
and then increased. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging 
activity exhibited a decreasing trend. Electronic tongue (E-tongue) analysis 
revealed that sweetness was decreased and bitterness was increased as 
accelerated roasting times and temperatures. Electronic nose (E-nose) analysis 
confirmed that the generation of vanillin was identified during roasting, which 
contributed to a vanilla-like odor. The roasting conditions enhanced γ-oryzanol 
contents while improving flavor were 200 °C for 5 min, 180 °C for 5 min or 
10 min, and 160 °C for 5 min or 10 min. These findings provide fundamental 
insights into the potential use of rice bran by-products as food ingredients.

The present study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of three different grapefruit 
flavanone forms in dog plasma and demonstrated their absorption after an oral 
intake of a grapefruit extract; pharmacokinetic parameters of these forms were 
also determined. Ten healthy beagles were administered 70 mg citrus flavonoids 
as a grapefruit extract contained in capsules, while two additional dogs were 
used as controls and given an excipient. The grapefruit flavanone naringin, 
along with its metabolites naringenin and naringenin glucuronide, was detected 
in dog plasma. Blood samples were collected between 0 and 24 h after 
administration of the extract. Naringin reached its maximun plasma concentration 
at around 80 min, whereas naringenin and naringenin glucuronide reached their 
maximun plasma concentrations at around 20 and 30 min, respectively. Maximum 
plasma concentrations of naringin, naringenin and naringenin glucuronide 
(medians and ranges) were 0.24 (0.05-2.08), 0.021 (0.001-0.3) and 0.09 
(0.034-0.12) micromol/l, respectively. The areas under the curves were 23.16 l 
(14.04-70.62) min x micromol/for nariningin, 1.78 (0.09-4.95) min x micromol/l 
for naringenin and 22.5 (2.74-99.23) min x micromol/l for naringenin 
glucuronide. The median and range values for mean residence time were 3.3 
(1.5-9.3), 2.8 (0.8-11.2) and 8.0 (2.3-13.1) h for naringin, naringenin and 
naringenin glucuronide, respectively. The results of the present study 
demonstrate the absorption of grapefruit flavanones via the presence of their 
metabolites in plasma, thus making an important contribution to the field since 
the biological activities ascribed to these compounds rely on their specific 
forms of absorption.

The present study evaluates for the first time in dogs, the kinetics of green 
tea catechins and their metabolic forms in plasma and urine. Ten beagles were 
administered 173 mg (12.35 mg/kg body weight) of catechins as a green tea 
extract, in capsules. Blood samples were collected during 24 h after intake and 
urine samples were collected during the following periods of time: 0-2, 2-6, 6-8 
and 8-24 h. Two catechins with a galloyl moiety and three conjugated metabolites 
were detected in plasma. Most of the detected forms in plasma reached their 
maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) at around 1 h. Median Cmax for ( - 
)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), ( - )-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), ( - 
)-epigallocatechin glucuronide (EGC-glucuronide), ( - )-epicatechin glucuronide 
(EC-glucuronide), ( - )-epicatechin sulphate (EC-sulphate) were 0.3 (range 
0.1-1.9), 0.1 (range 0-0.4), 0.8 (range 0.2-3.9), 0.2 (range 0.1-1.7) and 1 
(range 0.3-3.4) micromol/l, respectively. The areas under the plasma 
concentration v. time curves (AUC0 --> 24) were 427 (range 102-1185) micromol/l 
x min for EGC-glucuronide, 112 (range 53-919) micromol/l x min for EC-sulphate, 
71 (range 26-306) micromol/l x min for EGCG, 40 (range 12-258) micromol/l x min 
for EC-glucuronide and 14 (range 0.1-124) micromol/l x min for ECG. The values 
of mean residence time (MRT0 --> 24) were 5 (range 2-16), 2 (range 1-11), 10 
(range 2-13), 3 (range 2-16) and 2.4 (range 1-18) h for EGCG, ECG, 
EGC-glucuronide, EC-glucuronide and EC-sulphate, respectively. In urine, 
catechins were present as conjugated forms, suggesting bile excretion of EGCG 
and ECG. Green tea catechins are absorbed following an oral administration and 
EGC-glucuronide is the metabolic form that remains in the organism for a longer 
period of time, suggesting that this compound could suffer an enterohepatic 
cycle.

To study the potential hepatic metabolism of olive oil phenols, human hepatoma 
HepG2 cells were incubated for 2 and 18 h with hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and 
hydroxytyrosyl acetate, three phenolic constituents of olive oil. After 
incubation, culture media and cell lysates were hydrolyzed with 
beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase and analyzed by LC-MS. In vitro methylation, 
glucuronidation, and sulfation of pure phenols were also performed. Methylated 
and glucuronidated forms of hydroxytyrosol were detected at 18 h of incubation, 
together with methylglucuronidated metabolites. Hydroxytyrosyl acetate was 
largely converted into free hydroxytyrosol and subsequently metabolized, yet 
small amounts of glucuronidated hydroxytyrosyl acetate were detected. Tyrosol 
was poorly metabolized, with <10% of the phenol glucuronidated after 18 h. Minor 
amounts of free or conjugated phenols were detected in cell lysates. No sulfated 
metabolites were found. In conclusion, olive oil phenols can be metabolized by 
the liver as suggested by the results obtained using HepG2 cells as a hepatic 
model system.

Four cultivars (Bronowicka Ostra, Cyklon, Tornado, and Tajfun) of pepper fruit 
Capsicum annuum L. were studied for phenolics contents and antioxidant activity. 
Two fractions of phenolics, flavonoids (with phenolic acids) and capsaicinoids, 
were isolated from the pericarp of pepper fruit at two growth stages (green and 
red) and were studied for their antioxidant capacity. Both fractions from red 
fruits had higher activities than those from green fruits. A comparison of the 
capsaicinoid fraction with the flavonoid and phenolic acid fraction from red 
fruit with respect to their antioxidant activity gave similar results. Phenolic 
compounds were separated and quantified by LC and HPLC. Contents of nine 
compounds were determined in the flavonoid and phenolic acid fraction: 
trans-p-feruloyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, 
trans-p-sinapoyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, quercetin 
3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside-7-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside, trans-p-ferulyl 
alcohol-4-O-[6-(2-methyl-3-hydroxypropionyl] glucopyranoside, luteolin 
6-C-beta-d-glucopyranoside-8-C-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside, apigenin 
6-C-beta-d-glucopyranoside-8-C-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside, lutoeolin 
7-O-[2-(beta-d-apiofuranosyl)-beta-d-glucopyranoside], quercetin 
3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside, and luteolin 
7-O-[2-(beta-d-apiofuranosyl)-4-(beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-6-malonyl]-beta-d-glucopyranoside. 
The main compounds of this fraction isolated from red pepper were sinapoyl and 
feruloyl glycosides, and the main compound from green pepper was 
quercetin-3-O-l-rhamnoside. Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were the main 
components of the capsaicinoid fraction. A high correlation was found between 
the content of these compounds and the antioxidant activity of both fractions. 
Their antioxidant activities were elucidated by heat-induced oxidation in the 
beta-carotene-linoleic acid system and the antiradical activity by the 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) decoloration test. The highest antioxidant 
activity in the beta-carotene-linoleic acid system was found for 
trans-p-sinapoyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, which was lower than the activity of 
free sinapic acid. Quercetin 3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside had the highest 
antiradical activity in the DPPH system, which was comparable to the activity of 
quercetin. The activities of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were similar to that 
of trans-p-feruloyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside in the DPPH model system.

Grape anthocyanins reacted with diacetyl, a secondary metabolite of 
microorganisms involved in winemaking, to form 10-acetyl-pyranoanthocyanins, a 
type of anthocyanin-derived pigment similar to other vitisin-type 
pyranoanthocyanins found in red wines. The structures of 
10-acetyl-pyranomalvidin-3-β-O-glucoside and 
10-acetyl-pyranopeonidin-3-β-O-glucoside were confirmed by spectroscopic methods 
(UV-vis, MS/MS, and NMR) after their synthesis and isolation. In contrast to 
other vitisin-type pyranoanthocyanins, the newly described 
10-acetyl-pyranoanthocyanins exhibited differentiated color-related properties. 
They showed an important tendency to occur as colorless hemiacetals at C-10 
under wine pH conditions, while co-occurrence of flavylium cation and quinoidal 
base yielded a broad visible absorbance band around 510-520 nm. Moreover, they 
easily reacted with bisulfite in acidic aqueous solution (pH 2.0), but the 
expected bleaching was not observed. Bisulfite bonded to the carbonyl of 
10-acetyl substituent instead of the expected C-10 position of the 
pyranoanthocyanin core, thus giving rise to a red pigment hypsochromically 
shifted toward orangish nuances (maximum absorbances at 487-491 nm).

A method using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous analysis of nine 
chlorogenic acids (CGAs), three isomers each of caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs), 
feruloylquinic acids (FQAs) and dicaffeoylquinic acids (dCQAs), and their two 
metabolites, caffeic acid (CA) and ferulic acid (FA), in human plasma. In 
simultaneous multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) measurements using ESI-MS/MS 
with a negative ion mode, a deprotonated molecular ion derived from each of the 
11 molecules was used as a precursor ion while three diagnostic product ions 
characteristic for each were selected for the qualitative analysis. To obtain 
maximal intensities for all diagnostic product ions, the collision energy was 
optimized for each one. LC separation was achieved under conditions of a 
reversed-phase Inertsil ODS-2 column combined with a gradient elution system 
using 50mM acetic acid with 3% acetonitrile aqueous solution and 50 mM acetic 
acid with 100% acetonitrile. In the quantitative analysis, one of the three 
diagnostic product ions for each of the 11 molecules was selected. Application 
of simultaneous LC-ESI-MS/MS MRM measurements to analyze the 11 standards spiked 
into blank human plasma indicated that all diagnostic product ions were detected 
without any interference, and that the sensitivity, linearity and recovery of 
this method were acceptable. When using this method to analyze those 11 
molecules in the plasma after oral ingestion of 250 ml of a drink containing a 
green coffee bean extract (300 mg CGAs), all 11 molecules were identified and 
CQAs, FQAs and FA were quantified. CQAs, FQAs and dCQAs in human plasma were 
detected for the first time. This method should be useful to understand the 
biological and pharmacological effects of CGAs, such as improvement of human 
hypertension.

Hesperidin is a biologically effective flavonoid. Several studies have reported 
that dietary hesperidin was converted to conjugated metabolites, such as 
hesperetin-glucuronides and sulfoglucuronides, during absorption and metabolism. 
However, the chemical structures of the conjugated metabolites, especially the 
sites of glucuronidation and sulfoglucuronidation in plasma, were unconfirmed. 
Therefore, the concentrations of the metabolites conjugated at various sites in 
plasma could not be individually quantified. In the present study, we identified 
the chemical structures and concentrations of the major conjugated metabolites 
in rat plasma after oral administration of hesperidin. Two 
hesperetin-glucuronides were prepared and identified as 
hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Using 
these authentic compounds, the concentrations of 
hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide in rat 
plasma were individually determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
In rat plasma, hesperetin-glucuronides were primarily comprised of 
hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. The 
concentration of hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide was slightly higher than that 
of hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Furthermore, not only hesperetin 
conjugates but also homoeriodictyol conjugates were observed in rat plasma. The 
present study is the first report elucidating the chemical structures and 
changes in individual concentrations in rat plasma of glucuronides derived from 
orally administered hesperidin.

Anthocyanins (ACs) are phenolic compounds that are distributed widely in fruits 
and vegetables. Although consumption of these compounds has been shown to 
improve visual function, the distribution of ACs in ocular tissue has not been 
examined in detail. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the ocular 
distribution of blackcurrant anthocyanins (BCAs) in rats and rabbits after oral, 
intravenous (i.v.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration. Identification and 
quantification of ACs were carried out using high-performance liquid 
chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) and 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV-visible detection, 
respectively. BCAs were identified in the plasma and whole eye after oral and 
i.p. administration in rats. No other peaks were detected in either plasma or 
ocular tissues after administration when the absorbance of the eluate was 
monitored at 520 nm. This finding indicates that intact forms of ACs were 
present in rats after administration of BCA. In rats given i.p. administration, 
the concentration of total ACs in the whole eye and some ocular tissues was 
higher than that measured in plasma. These results suggested that ACs detected 
in the ocular tissues were not due to residual blood. Following i.v. 
administration in rabbits, four ACs were identified in the plasma and several 
ocular tissues including the aqueous humor, cornea, sclera, choroid, ciliary 
body, iris and retina. A small amount of ACs was also detected in the vitreous

distributed in ocular tissues as intact forms. Our data show clearly that intact 
forms of BCAs pass thorough the blood-aqueous barrier and blood-retinal barrier 
in both rats and rabbits.

Shanlan rice, a unique drought-resistant rice germplasm resource in Hainan 
Province, China, holds significant potential for rice genetic improvement and 
breeding innovation. However, its genetic diversity and significance in rice 
breeding remain inadequately explored. This study conducted a comprehensive 
analysis of phenolic acid profiles and antioxidant properties in the brown rice 
of 84 Shanlan rice accessions. It was revealed that colored Shanlan rice 
accessions exhibited significantly higher total phenolic content (249.00-2408.33 
mg gallic acid equivalents per 100 g of rice flour (mg GAE/100 g)) and 
antioxidant capacity (DPPH: 680.39-809.63 micromoles of Trolox equivalent per 
100 g (μmol TE/100 g); ABTS: 529.93-1917.77 μmol TE/100 g) compared to 
white-grained varieties. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis 
identified eight phenolic acids in the bound fractions, among which the sinapic 
acid (55.08 μg/g) and vanillic acid (11.72 μg/g) were predominant, accounting 
for over 60% of total bound phenolic acid content. A genome-wide association 
study (GWAS) identified 84 significant loci associated with these 
phenolic-related traits. A major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 7 
for free phenolic content, total phenolic content, flavonoids, and DPPH activity 
was co-located at the Rc gene locus, a key regulator of red pericarp 
pigmentation and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis. Haplotype analysis identified 
ten haplotypes in Rc, with the haplotype H002 showing the highest antioxidant 
capacity. Another QTL on chromosome 11 was associated with p-coumaric, vanillic, 
and sinapic acids, although no significant difference was observed in haplotype 
analysis. These results highlight Rc as a key genetic factor underlying 
antioxidant properties in rice, while other loci require further validation. 
This research provides a foundation for breeding health-benefit, 
drought-tolerant rice cultivars using Hainan's unique germplasm.

The contents of free and total phenolic acids and alk(en)ylresorcinols were 
analyzed in commercial products of eight grains: oat (Avena sativa), wheat 
(Triticum spp.), rye (Secale cerale), barley (Hordeum vulgare), buckwheat 
(Fagopyrum esculentum), millet (Panicum miliaceum), rice (Oryza sativa), and 
corn (Zea mays). Avenanthramides were determined in three oat products. Free 
phenolic acids, alk(en)ylresorcinols, and avenanthramides were extracted with 
methanolic acetic acid, 100% methanol, and 80% methanol, respectively, and 
quantified by HPLC. The contents of total phenolic acids were quantified by HPLC 
analysis after alkaline and acid hydrolyses. The highest contents of total 
phenolic acids were in brans of wheat (4527 mg/kg) and rye (4190 mg/kg) and in 
whole-grain flours of these grains (1342 and 1366 mg/kg, respectively). In other 
products, the contents varied from 111 mg/kg (white wheat bread) to 765 mg/kg 
(whole-grain rye bread). Common phenolic acids found in the grain products were 
ferulic acid (most abundant), ferulic acid dehydrodimers, sinapic acid, and 
p-coumaric acid. The grain products were found to contain either none or only 
low amounts of free phenolic acids. The content of avenanthramides in oat flakes 
(26-27 mg/kg) was about double that found in oat bran (13 mg/kg). The highest 
contents of alk(en)ylresorcinols were observed in brans of rye (4108 mg/kg) and 
wheat (3225 mg/kg). In addition, whole-grain rye products (rye bread, rye flour, 
and whole-wheat flour) contained considerable levels of alk(en)ylresorcinols 
(524, 927, and 759 mg/kg, respectively).

Berberis mikuna Job. (common name ""mikuna"") and Berberis burruyacuensis O.R. 
Dantur, S. Radice, E. Giordani and Papini (common name ""sacha mikuna"") are 
endemic native plant species from northwestern Argentina. The aim of this work 
was to evaluate, for the first time, the potential of the pulp, seed, and peel 
powders from B. mikuna and B. burruyacuensis fruits as functional food 
ingredients, with the purpose of adding value to these native resources and 
promoting their sustainable use. All powders exhibited nutritional value due to 
their protein, lipid, fiber, and ash content, especially the seed powder. 
Phenolic compounds (including xanthone, phenolic esters, coumarins, flavonoids, 
tannins, and anthocyanins), alkaloids, amino acids, lipids, and vitamins, 
totaling 33 compounds, were identified in the pulp, seed, and peel of both 
Berberis fruits through UHPLC-PDA-ESI-QT-MS/MS. High anthocyanin content was 
observed in the pulp and peel, mainly in B. mikuna (195.55 ± 7.75 and 283.49 ± 
6.55 g C3GE/100 g of powder, respectively), while tannins were abundant in the 
seeds (3.64 ± 0.11 and 6.09 ± 0.06 mg PB2/100 g of powder for B. mikuna and B. 
burruyacuensis, respectively). The powders exhibited antioxidant activity 
(ABTS•+; H2O2) and the capacity to inhibit enzymes related to metabolic 
syndrome, such as α-glucosidase, α-amylase, and lipase. These findings suggest 
the potential of B. mikuna and B. burruyacuensis fruit powders as functional 
food ingredients, dietary supplements, or natural functional colorants for foods 
and beverages.

Dietary chemoprevention has emerged as a cost-effective approach to control most 
prevalent chronic diseases including cancer. Changes in dietary patterns and 
lifestyle, such as increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables and more 
balanced intakes of meat and plant foods, are a practical and effective strategy 
for reducing the incidence of chronic diseases. Phytonutrients (or 
phytochemicals) are found in eatable fruits and vegetables that, daily ingested, 
may exhibit a potential for modulating human metabolism in a manner favourable 
for the prevention of chronic and degenerative diseases. Carotenoids and 
flavonoids (anthocyanins, phenolic acids, polyphenols) are examples of 
phytonutrients. Consumption of total phytochemical intake has been consistently 
linked to protection from chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, 
cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. To highlight the beneficial health 
effects of phytonutrients in plants, we choose two interesting plants, the 
potato and the citrus fruits. They were chosen owing to their phytonutrient 
content, and low price, which makes them more easily acquired in low incoming 
populations, and consequently they are highly consumed not only in developing 
but also in developed countries. Due to its high nutrient and phytochemical 
content, the potato can lower oxidative stress, a key mechanism for cancer and 
cardiovascular disease prevention. Its phenolic compounds act as antioxidants 
and improve heart health. Furthermore, this review emphasizes the bioactive 
compounds in citrus which can reduce inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen 
species generation, thus attenuating the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Besides important applications in 
the functional food sector, phytochemicals are also employed in the production 
of cosmetic and/or cosmeceutical products.

The dicarboxylic tripeptide glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant intracellular 
thiol. GSH analysis by liquid chromatography is routine. Yet, GSH analysis by 
gas chromatography is challenged due to thermal instability and lacking 
volatility. We report a high-yield laboratory method for the preparation of 
(2)H-labeled GSH dimethyl ester ((d3Me)2-GSH) for use as internal standard (IS) 
which was characterized by LC-MS/MS. For GC-MS analysis, the dimethyl esters of 
GSH and the IS were derivatized with pentafluoropropionic (PFP) anhydride. 
Electron-capture negative-ion chemical ionization of the (Me)2-(PFP)3-GSH 
provided high sensitivity. We encourage increasing use of GC-MS in the analysis 
of amino acids as their Me-PFP derivatives in the ECNICI mode.

Tea is a beverage consumed widely throughout the world. The existence in tea of 
chemopreventing compounds possessing antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic and 
antioxidative properties has been reported. High intakes of tea and foods 
containing flavonoids have recently been shown to be negatively correlated to 
the occurrence of CHD. However, tea may contain other compounds with similar 
activities. Using a new gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method we 
measured lignans and isoflavonoids in samples of twenty commercial teas (black, 
green and red varieties) and, for comparison, six coffees. Both unbrewed and 
brewed tea were investigated. The analysis of the teas yielded relatively high 
levels of the lignans secoisolariciresinol (5.6-28.9 mg/kg; 15.9-81.9 mumol/kg) 
and matairesinol (0.56-4.13 mg/kg; 1.6-11.5 mumol/kg) but only low levels of 
isoflavonoids. Because the plant lignans, as well as their mammalian metabolites 
enterolactone and enterodiol, have antioxidative properties and these mammalian 
lignans occur in high concentrations in plasma, we hypothesize that lignan 
polyphenols may contribute to the protective effect of tea on CHD.

In this study, Corchorus olitorius leaves were subjected to different thermal 
treatments (blanching, boiling, drying, frying, and steaming) and analyzed, 
total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and antioxidant 
activity. Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used 
to identify functional groups, while metabolites were identified with LC-MC. The 
TPC and antioxidant activity of C. olitorius were significantly (p < 0.05) 
increased by cooking and drying. The steam-cooked sample had the highest TPC 
(18.89 mg GAE/g) and TFC (78.42 mg QE/g). With ABTS, FRAP, and DPPH assays, the 
steam-cooked sample exhibited the highest antioxidant activity of 119.58, 
167.31, and 122.23 µM TE/g, respectively. LC-MS identified forty-two (42) 
metabolites in C. olitorius that included phenolic acid derivatives, flavonoid 
derivatives, and amino acid derivatives. Overall, steaming appears to be the 
best cooking method, with respect to the retention of phytochemical compounds 
and antioxidant activity.

Gradient reversed-phase HPLC was used to obtain quantitative estimates of the 
levels of free and conjugated myricetin and quercetin in 65 red wines from 
Italy, Chile, France, California, Australia, Bulgaria, Spain, Romania, New 
Zealand, Brazil, Morocco, and Hungary. The concentrations of total flavonols 
ranged from 4.6 to 41.6 mg L(-1). High total flavonol levels appear to be 
associated with the use of thick-skinned grape varieties, such as Cabernet 
Sauvignon, with a high skin:volume ratio, which were left to ripen fully in 
sunny conditions before harvest and which were extracted efficiently by modern 
methods of vinification. Some Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon wines contained up to 
40 mg of total flavonols L(-1), which was higher than the levels detected in 
Cabernet Sauvignon from France, California, and Australia. The flavonol content 
of 1989 and 1990 Cabernet Sauvignon from Bulgaria was <6 mg L(-1). Chilean 
Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Pinot Noir all contained consistently higher 
concentrations of flavonols than their counterparts from different geographical 
regions.

In this study, four different olive fruit and leaf varieties collected in Jordan 
were assessed for quality using both chemical and biological methods. To 
quantify the phenol and antioxidant content in the olive fruit and leaf 
extracts, a validated UV method was employed. The antioxidant activity and total 
phenolic content of fruit and leaf extracts of the olive varieties were measured 
using the DPPH radical scavenging assay and Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric method, 
respectively. The researchers also conducted a biological assay against colon 
cells to examine the potential health benefits of the olive extracts. The 
results showed that the phenol content of the samples varied depending on the 
region they were collected from and that they contained a significant amount of 
antioxidants. Additionally, it was observed that the samples with higher 
antioxidant content had lower cell viability against colon cells. Overall, this 
study suggests that olive extracts may have potential health benefits for colon 
health and that the phenol and antioxidant content of the extracts can vary 
depending on the source of the olives.

and vegetables. Dietary sources of anthocyanins include red and purple berries, 
grapes, apples, plums, cabbage, or foods containing high levels of natural 
colorants. Cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, peonidin, petunidin, and 
pelargonidin are the six common anthocyanidins. Following consumption, 
anthocyanin, absorption occurs along the gastrointestinal tract, the distal 
lower bowel being the place where most of the absorption and metabolism occurs. 
In the intestine, anthocyanins first undergo extensive microbial catabolism 
followed by absorption and human phase II metabolism. This produces hybrid 
microbial-human metabolites which are absorbed and subsequently increase the 
bioavailability of anthocyanins. Health benefits of anthocyanins have been 
widely described, especially in the prevention of diseases associated with 
oxidative stress, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. 
Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that health-promoting effects attributed 
to anthocyanins may also be related to modulation of gut microbiota. In this 
paper we attempt to provide a comprehensive view of the state-of-the-art 
literature on anthocyanins, summarizing recent findings on their chemistry, 
biosynthesis, nutritional value and on their effects on human health.

The incorporation of Cannabis sativa L. seeds into barley wort was investigated 
to enhance the functional profile of beer. Hemp seeds (cv. Henola) were malted 
via controlled steeping, germination, and kilning, then added to barley malt at 
10% and 30% (w/w) in both malted and unmalted forms. Standard congress mashing 
produced worts whose physicochemical parameters (pH, extract, colour, turbidity, 
filtration and saccharification times) were assessed, alongside profiles of 
fermentable sugars, polyphenols, B-group vitamins, and cannabinoids. Addition of 
hemp seeds reduced extract yield without impairing saccharification or 
filtration and slightly elevated mash pH and turbidity. Maltose and glucose 
levels declined significantly at higher hemp dosages, whereas sucrose remained 
stable. Wort enriched with 30% unmalted seeds exhibited the highest levels of 
trans-ferulic (20.61 µg/g), gallic (5.66 µg/g), trans-p-coumaric (3.68 µg/g), 
quercetin (6.07 µg/g), and trans-cinnamic (4.07 µg/g) acids. Malted hemp 
addition enhanced thiamine (up to 0.302 mg/mL) and riboflavin (up to 178.8 
µg/mL) concentrations. Cannabinoids (THCA-A, THCV, CBDV, CBG, CBN) were 
successfully extracted at µg/mL levels, with the total cannabinoid content 
peaking at 14.59 µg/mL in the 30% malted treatment. These findings demonstrate 
that hemp seeds, particularly in malted form, can enrich barley wort with 
bioactive polyphenols, vitamins, and non-psychoactive cannabinoids under 
standard mashing conditions, without compromising key brewing performance 
metrics. Further work on fermentation, sensory evaluation, stability, and 
bioavailability is warranted to realise hemp-enriched functional beers.

A method was developed to determine the flavanols prodelphinidin B3, procyanidin 
B3, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin by high-performance liquid chromatography, 
using dual-channel electrochemical detection. This method was especially suited 
to the direct analysis of beer samples and to analysis of acetone extracts of 
barley samples, and was capable of determining proanthocyanidins and catechins 
at levels of 0.1-5.0 mg l-1. The use of dual-channel electrochemical detection 
also enabled unambiguous peak identification by measurement of collection 
efficiencies. This method offered improved sensitivity and selectivity compared 
with ultraviolet detection, and sample preparation procedures were greatly 
simplified. The method was applied to the comparison of stabilized and 
unstabilized lagers, and to the analysis of different barley varieties grown in 
Ireland.

Bioactive phenols (BPs) are often targets in red wine analysis. However, other 
compounds interfere in the liquid chromatography methods used for this analysis. 
Here, purification procedures were tested to eliminate anthocyanin interference 
during the determination of 19 red-wine BPs. Liquid chromatography, coupled to a 
diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) and a mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS), was used to 
compare the direct injection of the samples with solid-phase extractions: 
reversed-phase (C18) and strong cation-exchange (SCX). The HPLC-DAD method 
revealed that, out of 13BPs, only six are selectively analyzed with or without 
C18 treatment, whereas SCX enabled the detection of all BPs. The recovery with 
SCX was above 86.6% for eight BPs. Moreover, UPLC-MS demonstrated the potential 
of SCX sample preparation for the determination of 19BPs. The developed 
procedure may be extended to the analysis of other red wine molecules or to 
other analytical methods where anthocyanins may interfere.

Fruits are nowadays considered important suppliers of anti-oxidant molecules. 
Apples are particularly rich in phenolic compounds, non-nutritional 
phytochemicals that play active roles in controlling severe chronic diseases. In 
this work, 19 phenolic compounds were investigated in both skin and pulp tissues 
of seven apple accessions across the Malus genus collected at two stages: during 
fruit development and at harvest. The primary difference in phenolic 
concentration between wild and domesticated accessions, especially in the pulp, 
could be explained by the larger growth rate of the domesticated varieties. The 
proposed dilution effect was also confirmed through the observation of the 
increased content of procyanidin B2+B4 and phloridzin in russet-skinned apples, 
known to have higher concentrations of these compounds. The metabolite screening 
was also accompanied by the expression analysis of 16 polyphenolic genes 
showing, for nine elements, a higher expression at harvest than during fruit 
development. Finally, a polyphenolic comparison with red-fleshed apples was also 
carried out, underlying a larger amount of procyanidins and 
quercetin-3rhamnoside in the white-fleshed accessions. The results presented and 
discussed in this work suggest that specific white-fleshed apples, especially 
with russeted-skin, may play an important role in ameliorating the nutraceutical 
potential of apple fruit.

University, Istanbul, Turkey.

In this study, the biological activities of water and ethanol extracts from 
Sinapis alba and Brassica nigra seeds were evaluated using various bioanalytical 
methods and spectrophotometric analyses. Antioxidant capacities were assessed 
through cupric reducing antioxidant capacity, ferric reducing antioxidant power 
assay, and ferric ion reducing assays, while radical scavenging abilities were 
evaluated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)• and 
2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) diammonium salt (ABTS)•+ 
assays. Total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) were 
quantified as gallic acid equivalents (GAE) and quercetin equivalents (QE), 
respectively. Additionally, anticholinergic activity was determined by Ellman's 
method. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of phenolic compounds in extracts 
were performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Reference 
standards were employed for the comparison. The half-maximal inhibitory 
concentration (IC50) values of S. alba and B. nigra seed extracts were in the 
range 1199-1799 µg/mL for DPPH• and 786.6-1259 µg/mL for ABTS•+ radical 
scavenging activities. TPC levels for S. alba and B. nigra water and ethanol 
extracts varied between 12.35 and 28.82 mg GAE/g extract, while TFC values 
ranged from 12.18 to 28.36 mg QE/g extract. The extracts also showed potent 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitory effects, with IC50 values in the range of 
0.167-0.194 µg/mL. These significant biological activities are attributed to the 
rich phytochemical composition of the seed extracts, indicating their potential 
as natural sources of antioxidant and anticholinergic agents.

The possible beneficial effects of tea consumption have attracted a great deal 
of attention. Many of the biological effects have been attributed to tea 
catechins, but the metabolic fate of these compounds is not clear. In the 
present study, a major metabolite observed in human blood and urine samples 
after green tea administration was identified as a O-methylated derivative of 
(-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) by comparison with products from chemical and 
enzymatic O-methylation of EGC. The structure of this metabolite was elucidated 
as 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epigallocatechin (4'-O-MeEGC) by (1)H and (13)C NMR and 
heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity experiment. The human plasma level of 
4'-O-MeEGC reached its peak value within the first 2 h following tea ingestion. 
Its maximum concentration was 4 to 6 times higher than that of EGC. The 
half-lives of EGC and 4'-O-MeEGC in the blood were 1.02 +/- 0.07 and 4.39 +/- 
1.14 h, respectively. The amount of 4'-O-MeEGC excreted in urine was about 3 
times higher than that of EGC, and 88% of 4'-O-MeEGC was excreted in urine 
within 8 h. The present structural information and concentration-time profile of 
this metabolite provide the basis for understanding the biotransformation of EGC 
and for future elucidation of its biological activities.

(-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant tea catechin, has been 
proposed to be beneficial to human health based on its strong antioxidative and 
other biological activities in vitro. Inadequate knowledge regarding the 
bioavailability and biotransformation of EGCG in humans, however, has limited 
our understanding of its possible beneficial health effects. In this study, 
4',4' '-di-O-methyl-EGCG (4',4' '-DiMeEGCG) was detected in human plasma and 
urine by LC/MS/MS following green tea ingestion. Both 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and EGCG 
reached peak plasma values (20.5 +/- 7.7 and 145.4 +/- 31.6 nM, respectively, in 
4 subjects) at 2 h after the dose. The half-lives of 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and EGCG 
were 4.1 +/- 0.8 and 2.7 +/- 0.9 h, respectively. The cumulative urinary 
excretion of 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG during a 24 h period was 140.3 +/- 48.6 microg, 
about 5-fold higher than that of EGCG, but the excreted 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and 
EGCG in urine only accounted for about 0.1% of ingested EGCG. 
(-)-5-(3',4',5'-Trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4) and 
(-)-5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6), along with another 
possible ring-fission metabolite, 
(-)-5-(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6'), were detected in human 
urine after green tea ingestion. The cumulative excretion of M4, M6', and M6 
during a 24 h period ranged from 75 microg to 1.2 mg, 0.6 to 6 mg, and 0.6 to 10 
mg, respectively. The combined excretion of all three ring-fission metabolites 
accounted for 1.5-16% of ingested catechins. M4, M6', and M6 were all observed 
after the ingestion of pure EGCG or EGC by human subjects, whereas only M6 was 
produced after EC ingestion. These metabolites as well as monomethylated EGCG 
were detected in mice and rats after tea or EGCG administration, and the tissue 
levels reflected the rather low bioavailability of EGCG in rats. The presently 
characterized methylated EGCG metabolites and ring-fission products exist in 
substantial quantities and may contribute to the biological activities of tea.

Food fraud is widespread nowadays in the food products supply chain, from raw 
materials processing to the final product and during storage and transport. The 
most frequent fraud is practiced in staple food commodities like cereals. Their 
origin, variety, genotype, and bioactive compounds are altered to deceive 
consumers. Similarly, in various food sectors like beverage, baking, and 
confectionary, items like melamine, flour improver, and food colors are used in 
the market to temple consumers. To tackle food fraud and authentication, 
non-destructive techniques are being used. These techniques have limitations 
like lack of standardization, interference from multiple absorbing species, 
ambiguous results, and time-consuming to perform, depending on the type, size, 
and location of the system proved difficult to quantify the samples of 
adulteration. Chromatography has been introduced as an effective technique. It 
serves to safeguard public health due to its detection capabilities. 
Chromatography proved a crucial tool against fraudulent practices to preserve 
consumer trust.

Estimation of dietary intake of polyphenols is difficult, due to limited 
availability of food composition data and bias inherent to dietary assessment 
methods. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the associations between 
the intake of polyphenol-rich foods and the urinary excretion of several 
phenolic compounds and therefore explore whether these phenolic compounds could 
be used as a biomarker of intake. Fifty-three participants of the SU.VI.MAX 
study (a randomised primary-prevention trial evaluating the effect of daily 
antioxidant supplementation on chronic diseases) collected a 24 h urine and a 
spot urine sample and filled a dietary record during a 2 d period. Thirteen 
polyphenols and metabolites, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, m-coumaric acid, 
gallic acid, 4-O-methylgallic acid, quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, 
hesperetin, naringenin, phloretin, enterolactone and enterodiol, were measured 
using HPLC-electrospray ionisation-MS-MS. In spot samples apple consumption was 
positively correlated to phloretin, grapefruit consumption to naringenin, orange 
to hesperetin, citrus fruit consumption to both naringenin and hesperetin, with 
r coefficients ranging from 0.31 to 0.57 (P < 0.05). The combination of fruits 
and/or fruit juices was positively correlated to gallic acid and

OBJECTIVE: Estimation of dietary intake of polyphenols is difficult, due to 
limited availability of food composition data and bias inherent to dietary 
assessment methods. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether we 
could detect polyphenols and their metabolites in a spot urine sample in a 
free-living human population and whether it was related to those observed in 
24-h urine samples, for potential use as a biomarkers of polyphenol intake.
SUBJECTS: Four 24-h urine samples and two spot urine samples were collected from 
154 participants of the SU.VI.MAX cohort (a randomized primary-prevention trial 
evaluating the effect of daily antioxidant supplementation on chronic diseases) 
in two separate studies over, respectively, a 7- and 2-day periods. Thirteen 
polyphenols and metabolites (chlorogenic acid (CGA), caffeic acid (CA), 
m-coumaric acid (mCOU), gallic acid (GA), 4-O-methylgallic acid (MeGA), 
quercetin (Q), isorhamnetin (MeQ), kaempferol (K), hesperetin (HESP), naringenin 
(NAR), phloretin (PHLOR), enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) were measured 
using HPLC-ESI-MS-MS.
RESULTS: Correlations between the urinary excretion levels were observed. The 
most significant were explained by metabolic filiations (CGA/CA, CA/mCOU, 
GA/MeGA, Q/MeQ, NAR/PHLOR, ENL/END) or co-occurrence in a same food source 
(NAR/HESP). Concentrations in spot samples correlated with those in 24-h urine 
sample (P<0.02, except for CA and for MeQ). Intra-individual variations were 
smaller than inter-individual variations for all polyphenols (P<0.01) except for 
MeGA and for PHLOR.
CONCLUSION: These results show that these polyphenols and metabolites are useful 
biomarkers for polyphenol intake.

The intake of polyphenols has been demonstrated to have health-promoting and 
disease-preventive effects. The pomegranate (Punica granatum L.), which is rich 
in several polyphenols, has been used for centuries in ancient cultures for its 
medicinal purposes. The potential health benefits of pomegranate polyphenols 
have been demonstrated in numerous in vitro studies and in vivo experiments. 
This study investigated the absorption and antioxidant effects of a standardized 
extract from pomegranate in healthy human volunteers after the acute consumption 
of 800 mg of extract. Results indicate that ellagic acid (EA) from the extract 
is bioavailable, with an observed C(max) of 33 ng/mL at t(max) of 1 h. The 
plasma metabolites urolithin A, urolithin B, hydroxyl-urolithin A, urolithin 
A-glucuronide, and dimethyl ellagic acid-glucuronide were identified by HPLC-MS. 
The antioxidant capacity measured with the oxygen radical absorbance capacity 
(ORAC) assay was increased with a maximum effect of 32% after 0.5 h, whereas the 
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was not affected. The inflammation 
marker interleukin-6 (IL-6) was not significantly affected after 4 h after the 
consumption of the extract. Overall, this study demonstrated the absorbability 
of EA from a pomegranate extract high in ellagitannin content and its ex vivo 
antioxidant effects.

Studies were conducted on the flavonoids (myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, 
luteolin, and apigenin) contents of 62 edible tropical plants. The highest total 
flavonoids content was in onion leaves (1497.5 mg/kg quercetin, 391.0 mg/kg 
luteolin, and 832.0 mg/kg kaempferol), followed by Semambu leaves (2041.0 
mg/kg), bird chili (1663.0 mg/kg), black tea (1491.0 mg/kg), papaya shoots 
(1264.0 mg/kg), and guava (1128.5 mg/kg). The major flavonoid in these plant 
extracts is quercetin, followed by myricetin and kaempferol. Luteolin could be 
detected only in broccoli (74.5 mg/kg dry weight), green chili (33.0 mg/kg), 
bird chili (1035.0 mg/kg), onion leaves (391.0 mg/kg), belimbi fruit (202.0 
mg/kg), belimbi leaves (464.5 mg/kg), French bean (11.0 mg/kg), carrot (37.5 
mg/kg), white radish (9.0 mg/kg), local celery (80.5 mg/kg), limau purut leaves 
(30.5 mg/kg), and dried asam gelugur (107.5 mg/kg). Apigenin was found only in 
Chinese cabbage (187.0 mg/kg), bell pepper (272.0 mg/kg), garlic (217.0 mg/kg), 
belimbi fruit (458.0 mg/kg), French peas (176.0 mg/kg), snake gourd (42.4 
mg/kg), guava (579.0 mg/kg), wolfberry leaves (547.0 mg/kg), local celery (338.5 
mg/kg), daun turi (39.5 mg/kg), and kadok (34.5 mg/kg). In vegetables, quercetin 
glycosides predominate, but glycosides of kaempferol, luteolin, and apigenin are 
also present. Fruits contain almost exclusively quercetin glycosides, whereas 
kaempferol and myricetin glycosides are found only in trace quantities.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of three common 
cooking practices (i.e., boiling, steaming, and frying) on phytochemical 
contents (i.e., polyphenols, carotenoids, glucosinolates, and ascorbic acid), 
total antioxidant capacities (TAC), as measured by three different analytical 
assays [Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), total radical-trapping 
antioxidant parameter (TRAP), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)] and 
physicochemical parameters of three vegetables (carrots, courgettes, and 
broccoli). Water-cooking treatments better preserved the antioxidant compounds, 
particularly carotenoids, in all vegetables analyzed and ascorbic acid in 
carrots and courgettes. Steamed vegetables maintained a better texture quality 
than boiled ones, whereas boiled vegetables showed limited discoloration. Fried 
vegetables showed the lowest degree of softening, even though antioxidant 
compounds were less retained. An overall increase of TEAC, FRAP, and TRAP values 
was observed in all cooked vegetables, probably because of matrix softening and 
increased extractability of compounds, which could be partially converted into 
more antioxidant chemical species. Our findings defy the notion that processed 
vegetables offer lower nutritional quality and also suggest that for each 
vegetable a cooking method would be preferred to preserve the nutritional and 
physicochemical qualities.

Small berries such as black currant constitute one of the important sources of 
potential health-promoting phytochemicals because these fruits are rich sources 
of compounds with high antioxidant properties. In this work, antioxidant 
capacities of different parts (buds, leaves, fruits) of various black currant 
cultivars were compared throughout the growing season with the aim to prepare 
extracts with high antioxidant capacity. Buds (opened, at the end of March) and 
leaves (in June) had a higher content in phenolics and antioxidants than fully 
ripened berries (in July) and the best yield (per branch) was obtained with the 
leaves collected in June due to their higher biomass. The differences observed 
among the eight cultivars tested were small. Concerning flavonols, quercetin was 
dominant in all organs and cultivars, myricetin varied widely among the 
cultivars, and kampferol was very low.

Considerable epidemiological evidence suggests a link between the consumption of 
diets rich in fruits and vegetables and a decreased risk of cardiovascular 
disease and cancers. Anthocyanins have received attention as important dietary 
constituents that may provide health benefits and contribute antioxidant 
capacity beyond that provided by essential micronutrients such as ascorbate, 
tocopherols, and selenium. The emergence of renewed interest by industrial 
countries in traditional herbal medicines and the development of 'functional 
foods' are stimulating the need for more information regarding the 
bioavailability and efficacy of plant polyphenols. Flavonoids represent a 
numerous group of secondary plant metabolites based on the structure of a pyran 
ring flanked by two or more phenyl rings and varying subtly in the degree of 
unsaturation and the pattern of hydroxylation or methylation. Flavonoids also 
vary in the type of sugar attached or the degree of polymerization. 
Anthocyanins, potent flavonoid antioxidants widely distributed in fruits, 
vegetables and red wines, normally occur in nature as glycosides, a form not 
usually considered as bioavailable. We have examined the bioavailability and 
pharmacokinetics of anthocyanins in humans. Anthocyanins were detected as 
glycosides in both plasma and urine samples. The elimination of plasma 
anthocyanins appeared to follow first-order kinetics and most anthocyanin 
compounds were excreted in urine within 4 h after feeding. The current findings 
appear to refute assumptions that anthocyanins are not absorbed in their 
unchanged glycosylated forms in humans.

This systematic review summarizes findings from human studies investigating the 
different routes of absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion (ADME) of 
dietary flavan-3-ols and their circulating metabolites in healthy subjects. 
Literature searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science. 
Human intervention studies using single and/or multiple intake of flavan-3-ols 
from food, extracts, and pure compounds were included. Forty-nine human 
intervention studies met inclusion criteria. Up to 180 metabolites were 
quantified from blood and urine samples following intake of flavan-3-ols, mainly 
as phase 2 conjugates of microbial catabolites (n = 97), with 
phenyl-γ-valerolactones being the most representative ones (n = 34). Phase 2 
conjugates of monomers and phenyl-γ-valerolactones, the main compounds in both 
plasma and urine, reached two peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of 260 and 
88 nmol/L at 1.8 and 5.3 h (Tmax) after flavan-3-ol intake. They contributed to 
the bioavailability of flavan-3-ols for over 20%. Mean bioavailability for 
flavan-3-ols was moderate (31 ± 23%, n bioavailability values = 20), and it 
seems to be scarcely affected by the amount of ingested compounds. While intra- 
and inter-source differences in flavan-3-ol bioavailability emerged, mean 
flavan-3-ol bioavailability was 82% (n = 1) and 63% (n = 2) after 
(-)-epicatechin and nut (hazelnuts, almonds) intake, respectively, followed by 
25% after consumption of tea (n = 7), cocoa (n = 5), apples (n = 3) and grape 
(n = 2). This highlights the need to better clarify the metabolic yield with 
which monomer flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins are metabolized in humans. This 
work clarified in a comprehensive way for the first time the ADME of a 
(poly)phenol family, highlighting the pool of circulating compounds that might 
be determinants of the putative beneficial effects linked to flavan-3-ol intake. 
Lastly, methodological inputs for implementing well-designed human and 
experimental model studies were provided.

Enterolignans (enterodiol and enterolactone) can potentially reduce the risk of 
certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Enterolignans are formed by the 
intestinal microflora after the consumption of plant lignans. Until recently, 
only secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol were considered enterolignan 
precursors, but now several new precursors have been identified, of which 
lariciresinol and pinoresinol have a high degree of conversion. Quantitative 
data on the contents in foods of these new enterolignan precursors are not 
available. Thus, the aim of this study was to compile a lignan database 
including all four major enterolignan precursors. Liquid chromatography-tandem 
mass spectrometry was used to quantify lariciresinol, pinoresinol, 
secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol in eighty-three solid foods and twenty-six 
beverages commonly consumed in The Netherlands. The richest source of lignans 
was flaxseed (301,129 microg/100 g), which contained mainly 
secoisolariciresinol. Also, lignan concentrations in sesame seeds (29,331 
microg/100 g, mainly pinoresinol and lariciresinol) were relatively high. For 
grain products, which are known to be important sources of lignan, lignan 
concentrations ranged from 7 to 764 microg/100 g. However, many vegetables and 
fruits had similar concentrations, because of the contribution of lariciresinol 
and pinoresinol. Brassica vegetables contained unexpectedly high levels of 
lignans (185-2321 microg/100 g), mainly pinoresinol and lariciresinol. Lignan 
levels in beverages varied from 0 (cola) to 91 microg/100 ml (red wine). Only 
four of the 109 foods did not contain a measurable amount of lignans, and in 
most cases the amount of lariciresinol and pinoresinol was larger than that of 
secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol. Thus, available databases largely 
underestimate the amount of enterolignan precursors in foods.

In the United States, commercially available foods, including cocoa and 
chocolate, are being marketed with statements referring to the level of 
antioxidant activity and polyphenols. For cocoa-containing foods, there has been 
no comprehensive survey of the content of these and other chemistries. A survey 
of cocoa and chocolate-containing products marketed in the United States was 
conducted to determine antioxidant activity and polyphenol and procyanidin 
contents. Commercially available samples consisted of the top market share 
products in each of the following six categories: natural cocoa, unsweetened 
baking chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet baking chips, milk chocolate, and 
chocolate syrup. Composite samples were characterized using four different 
methods: oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), vitamin C equivalence 
antioxidant capacity (VCEAC), total polyphenols, and procyanidins. All composite 
lots were further characterized for percent nonfat cocoa solids (NFCS) and 
percent fat. Natural cocoas had the highest levels of antioxidant activities, 
total polyphenols, and procyanidins followed by baking chocolates, dark 
chocolates and baking chips, and finally milk chocolate and syrups. The results 
showed a strong linear correlation between NFCS and ORAC (R (2) = 0.9849), total 
polyphenols (R (2) = 0.9793), and procyanidins (R (2) = 0.946), respectively. On 
the basis of principal component analysis, 81.4% of the sample set was 
associated with NFCS, antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, and procyanidins. 
The results indicated that, regardless of the product category, NFCS were the 
primary factor contributing to the level of cocoa antioxidants in the products 
tested. Results further suggested that differences in cocoa bean blends and 
processing, with the possible exception of Dutching, are minor factors in 
determining the level of antioxidants in commercially available cocoa-containing 
products in the United States.

This work relates to the development of a co-fermented product of sea buckthorn 
(Hippophae rhamnoides L.) with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Issatchenkia 
orientalis. Besides malic acid degradation, the parameters of present production 
technology were also standardized with emphasis on the retainability of total 
phenolic content (TPC) of sea buckthorn juice. The effect of co-fermentation on 
physico-chemical characteristics, organic acids, flavonoids, TPC and antioxidant 
activities was studied. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
analysis showed 55% reduction in malic acid content after the co-fermentation of 
sea buckthorn juice. The TPC of sea buckthorn product was 2.18 g gallic acid 
equivalent (GAE)/l. The estimated scavenging effect on 
2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radicals was 2.63 Trolox equivalent (TE) 
mmol/l. Ferric-reducing antioxidant power and 
2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) assays also showed that 
sea buckthorn product was on a par with commercial wines (Cabernet Shiraz and 
Beaujolais). We conclude that the process of co-fermentation resulted in a 
significant antioxidant potential of sea buckthorn product.

A gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) method for qualitative and 
subsequent quantitative analysis of phenolic antioxidants compounds, presents in 
olive oil, in rat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after oral administration of 
compounds is proposed. The procedure involves the extraction of compounds from 
the samples by a traditional microliquid-liquid extraction method, followed by a 
silylation step before the GC-MS analysis. The chromatographic separation was 
performed by using a low bleed DB5-MS fused-silica capillary column. The 
presence of 21 phenolic compounds was tested in CSF extracts and only free 
tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol and ferulic acid were detected. Those compounds were 
then quantitatively determined using the proposed methology. The molecular ion 
for silylated compounds appears at 370 m/z for hydroxytyrosol, 282 m/z for 
tyrosol and 338 m/z for ferulic acid respectively, while the base peak appears 
at 267 m/z, 179 m/z and 338 m/z. alpha-Naphthol was used as a surrogate (216 and 
201 m/z). The detection capabilities obtained were 74, 92 and 79 ng/mL 
respectively. The method was applied to the determination of trace amounts of 
compounds in rat cerebrospinal fluid after oral administration. The animals were 
fed with a standard chow diet (free of phenolic antioxidants) in order to avoid 
the influence of any other component of the diet on the CSF of the animals.

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and red wine (RW) are two basic elements that form 
part of the so-called Mediterranean diet. Both stand out because of their high 
phenolic compound content and their potential related health benefits. The 
present study is focused on the metabolic disposition of resveratrol (RESV), 
tyrosol (TYR), and hydroxytyrosol (HT) following the consumption of EVOO, RW, 
and a combination of both. In this study, 12 healthy volunteers consumed a 
single dose of 25 mL of EVOO, 150 mL of RW, and a combination of both in a 
crossover randomized clinical trial. Urinary recovery of RESV, TYR, and HT was 
analysed in urine samples collected over a 6-h period following the intake of 
each treatment. Higher HT levels were observed following EVOO compared to RW 
(3788 ± 1751 nmols and 2308 ± 847 nmols respectively). After the combination of 
EVOO and RW, the recovery of TYR and HT metabolites increased statistically 
compared to their separate consumption (4925 ± 1751 nmols of TYR and 6286 ± 3198 
nmols of HT). EVOO triggered an increase in glucuronide conjugates, while RW 
intake raised sulfate metabolites. Marginal effects were observed in RESV 
increased bioavailability after the combination of RW with the fat matrix 
provided by EVOO.

An automated on-line method for the determination of the isoflavones, daidzein 
and genistein, was developed using in-tube solid-phase microextraction coupled 
to high-performance liquid chromatography (in-tube SPME-HPLC). In-tube SPME is a 
new extraction technique for organic compounds in aqueous samples, in which 
analytes are extracted from the sample directly into an open tubular capillary 
by repeated draw/eject cycles of sample solution. Daidzein, genistein and their 
glucosides tested in this study were clearly separated within 8 min by HPLC 
using an XDB-C8 column with diode array detection. In order to optimize the 
extraction of these compounds, several in-tube SPME parameters were examined. 
The glucosides daidzin and genistin were analyzed as aglycones after hydrolysis 
because the glucosides were not concentrated by in-tube SPME. The optimum 
extraction conditions for daidzein and genistein were obtained with 20 
draw/eject cycles of 40 microl of sample using a Supel-Q porous layer open 
tubular capillary column. The extracted compounds were easily desorbed from the 
capillary by mobile phase flow, and carryover was not observed. Using the 
in-tube SPME-HPLC method, the calibration curves of these compounds were linear 
in the range 5-200 ng/ml, with a correlation coefficient above 0.9999 (n = 18), 
and the detection limits (S/N = 3) were 0.4-0.5 ng/ml. This method was 
successfully applied to the analysis of soybean foods without interference 
peaks. The recoveries of aglycones and glucosides spiked into food samples were 
above 97%.

Eriocitrin, a flavonoid glycoside present in lemon fruit, is metabolized in vivo 
to a series of eriodictyol, methylated eriodictyol, 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic 
acid, and their conjugates. Plasma antioxidant activity increased following oral 
administration of aqueous eriocitrin solutions to rats. Eriocitrin metabolites 
were found in plasma and renal excreted urine through HPLC and LC-MS analyses. 
Eriocitrin was not detected in plasma and urine, but eriodictyol, 
homoeriodictyol, and hesperetin in their conjugated forms were detected in 
plasma of 4.0 h following administration of eriocitrin. In urine for 24 h, both 
nonconjugates and conjugates of these metabolites were detected. 
3,4-Dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, which is metabolized from eriodictyol by 
intestinal bacteria, was detected in slight amounts with each form in 4.0-h 
plasma and 24-h urine. Eriocitrin was suggested to be metabolized by intestinal 
bacteria, and then eriodictyol and 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic of its metabolite 
were absorbed. Following administration of eriocitrin, plasma exhibited an 
elevated resistance effect to lipid peroxidation. Eriocitrin metabolites 
functioning as antioxidant agents are discussed.

The triglucoside of sesaminol, i.e., 2,6-O-di(β-D-glucopyranosyl)-β-D- 
glucopyranosylsesaminol (STG), occurs abundantly in sesame seeds and sesame oil 
cake and serves as an inexpensive source for the industrial production of 
sesaminol, an anti-oxidant that displays a number of bioactivities beneficial to 
human health. However, STG has been shown to be highly resistant to the action 
of β-glucosidases, in part due to its branched-chain glycon structure, and these 
circumstances hampered the efficient utilization of STG. We found that a strain 
(KB0549) of the genus Paenibacillus produced a novel enzyme capable of 
efficiently hydrolyzing STG. This enzyme, termed PSTG, was a tetrameric protein 
consisting of identical subunits with an approximate molecular mass of 80 kDa. 
The PSTG gene was cloned on the basis of the partial amino acid sequences of the 
purified enzyme. Sequence comparison showed that the enzyme belonged to the 
glycoside hydrolase family 3, with significant similarities to the Paenibacillus 
glucocerebrosidase (63% identity) and to Bgl3B of Thermotoga neapolitana (37% 
identity). The recombinant enzyme (rPSTG) was highly specific for β-glucosidic 
linkage, and k cat and k cat/K m values for the rPSTG-catalyzed hydrolysis of 
p-nitrophenyl-β-glucopyraniside at 37°C and pH 6.5 were 44 s(-1) and 426 s(-1) 
mM(-1), respectively. The specificity analyses also revealed that the enzyme 
acted more efficiently on sophorose than on cellobiose and gentiobiose. Thus, 
rPSTG is the first example of a β-glucosidase with higher reactivity for 
β-1,2-glucosidic linkage than for β-1,4- and β-1,6-glucosidic linkages, as far 
as could be ascertained. This unique specificity is, at least in part, 
responsible for the enzyme's ability to efficiently decompose STG.

Lignans constitute a group of phytochemicals, which are produced by oxidative 
dimerization of two phenylpropanoid units. Furfuran type lignans such as 
secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, lariciresinol or pinoresinol are widely 
distributed in edible plants, and most of those dietary lignans are metabolized 
by the gut microflora to enterolactone and enterodiol, also known as 
enterolignans, traditionally classified as phytoestrogens. The rich sources of 
lignans are flaxseed, sesame seeds, cereal products, and Brassica vegetables. 
There is a growing interest in biological functions of lignans from edible 
plants, since a higher intake of edible plants containing lignans is known to 
reduce the incidence of certain chronic diseases. This review deals with the 
isolation and preparation of furfuran type lignans from edible plants, and their 
bioactivities such as anticancer, antioxidant, cardiovasculoprotective, 
neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory activities, so that recent informations 
about bioactive lignans from edible plants may be available for the development 
of potential functional food agents. In this article, patents based information 
is also discussed.

The monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric flavan-3-ol composition of wines, grape 
seeds, and skins from Vitis vinifera L. cv. Graciano, Tempranillo, and Cabernet 
Sauvignon has been studied using (1) fractionation by polyamide column 
chromatography followed by HPLC/ESI-MS analysis, (2) fractionation on C(18) 
Sep-Pak cartridges followed by reaction with vanillin and acid-catalyzed 
degradation in the presence of toluene-alpha-thiol (thiolysis). The content of 
monomers ((+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin), procyanidin dimers (B3, B1, B4, and 
B2), trimers (T2 and C1), and dimer gallates (B2-3-O-gallate, B2-3'-O-gallate, 
and B1-3-O-gallate) ranged from 76.93 to 133.18 mg/L in wines, from 2.30 to 8.21 
mg/g in grape seeds, and from 0.14 to 0.38 mg/g in grape skins. In wines, the 
polymeric fraction represented 77-84% of total flavan-3-ols and showed a mean 
degree of polymerization (mDP) value of 6.3-13.0. In grapes, the polymeric 
fraction represented 75-81% of total flavan-3-ols in seeds and 94-98% in skins 
and showed mDP values of 6.4-7.3 in seeds and 33.8-85.7 in skins. All the 
monomeric flavan-3-ols and oligomeric procyanidins found in wines were also 
present in seeds, although differences in their relative abundances were seen. 
The skin polymeric proanthocyanidins participated in the equilibration of the 
wine polymeric proanthocyanidin fraction, especially contributing to the polymer 
subunit composition and mDP.

Mutagenic heterocyclic amines (HAs) are formed at low levels during cooking of 
meat and fish, and some of them are considered to be possible human carcinogens. 
The formation of HAs may be affected by the presence of synthetic or naturally 
occurring antioxidants. In the present study the effect of virgin olive oil 
(VOO) phenolic compounds, identified and quantified by LC-MS, on the formation 
of HAs in a model system was evaluated. An aqueous solution of creatinine, 
glucose, and glycine was heated in the presence of two samples of VOO differing 
only in the composition of phenolic compounds. The addition of VOO to the model 
system inhibited the formation of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline 
(IQx), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), and 
2-amino-3,7,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx) by between 30 and 50% 
compared with the control. Fresh-made olive oil, which contained a high amount 
of dihydroxyphenylethanol derivatives, inhibited HA formation more than a 
1-year-old oil did. The inhibition of HA formation was also verified using 
phenolic compounds extracted from VOO.

Isoformononetin (methoxy isoflavone) is a potent osteogenic isoflavone 
abundantly present in Butea monosperma, Pisum sativum, Mung bean, Machaerium 
villosum, Medicago sativa, and Glycine max. In the current study, an 
LC-ESI-MS/MS method for the simultaneous evaluation of isoformononetin (IFN), 
daidzein (DZN) and equol (EQL) was developed and validated in rat plasma using 
biochanin A as an internal standard. IFN, DZN, and EQL separation was achieved 
by using acetonitrile and acetic acid (0.1%) in the ratio of 90:10 (% v/v) as 
mobile phase under isocratic conditions at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min on Atlantis 
C18 (4.6 × 250 mm, 5.0 μm) column. The achieved method was linear within the 
concentration range of 0.5-500 ng/mL. The method was effectively applied to 
investigate the permeability, protein binding estimation and pharmacokinetics 
studies of IFN in rats. The PAMPA permeability of IFN was found to be high at 
pH 4.0 and 7.0. The protein binding was found to be about 91% of IFN. The oral 
bioavailability of IFN was found to be poor (21.6%). IFN was found to have a 
moderate clearance (2.9 L/h/kg) and a large apparent volume of distribution 
(12.1 L/kg). The plasma half-life (t1/2) and maximum attainable concentration 
(Cmax) of IFN at systemic circulation was found to be 1.9 ± 0.6 h and 
269.3 ± 0.4 after oral administration.

The purpose of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetics of quercetin 
aglycone as well as its conjugated metabolites and to develop a population 
pharmacokinetic model for quercetin that incorporates enterohepatic 
recirculation. The stability of quercetin in different matrices at various 
temperatures and pH, and the quercetin content of six capsules of the herbal 
preparation Quercetin-500 Plus were determined by HPLC. Subjects received 
quercetin 500 mg three times daily and blood and urine samples were obtained. 
The concentration of quercetin aglycone and conjugated metabolites were assayed 
using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. Pharmacokinetic 
parameters were determined using noncompartmental analysis with WinNonlin. A 
population compartment model incorporating input from the gallbladder was 
developed to account for the enterohepatic recirculation observed with 
quercetin. The oral clearance (CL/F) was high (3.5 x 10(4)l/h) with an average 
terminal half-life of 3.5 h for quercetin. The plasma concentration versus time 
curves exhibited re-entry peaks. A one-compartment model that included 
enterohepatic recirculation best described the plasma data. This represents the 
first comprehensive evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and enterohepatic 
recirculation of quercetin in humans. Population pharmacokinetic models adapted 
for enterohepatic recirculation allowed an assessment of the magnitude and 
frequency of the enterohepatic recirculation process.

In light of concerns about hormonally active agents, biomonitoring methods are needed to assess human exposure to such compounds. A method for simultaneous determination of DAI, its metabolite equol (EQ), GEN, and BPA by GC‐MS analysis was established, validated and applied to measure concentrations in human urine. Sample preparation involves enzymatic conjugate cleavage, SPE and derivatization by silylation. For GC/MS analysis, deuterated DAI and GEN and<jats:sup> 13</jats:sup>C‐BPA are used as internal standards. LOD are 4, 4, 5 and 3 ng/mL urine for DAI, EQ, GEN and BPA, respectively. Interassay variations were 9% for DAI, 15% for EQ, 18% for GEN and 10% for BPA. Simple workup and accuracy of the method are suited for biomonitoring. An analysis of urine samples from 15 adults consuming typical German food revealed dietary exposure to phytoestrogens in all samples: GEN concentrations ranged between 13 and 238 ng/mL, those for DAI ranged from 12 to 356 ng/mL. More than half of the individuals excreted also the more estrogenic metabolite EQ, at levels of 8–128 ng/mL. Higher concentrations (GEN: 820, DAI: 960 and EQ: 1740 ng/mL) were measured in a 24 h urine sample upon ingestion of soy protein (50 g with 12.9 mg DAI and 25.2 mg GEN). Only urine collected after some days on strict phytoestrogen‐free diet had undetectable isoflavone levels. BPA was detected in 9 of 15 urine samples ranging from 3 to 11 ng/mL, and at 55 ng/mL in one sample. In conclusion, a reliable method to determine BPA and isoflavones in urine was established and applied in a pilot study: Biomonitoring results show much higher dietary exposure to phytoestrogens than to BPA in German adults.</jats:p>"

Extruded whole flours from blends of cereals and pulses have great potential to 
be key ingredients in the development of more innovative gluten-free products, 
both from a technological and nutritional perspective. The objective of this 
work was to obtain pre-cooked flours from four formulations based on blends of 
whole cereals (PR: parboiled brown rice; PM: pearl millet) and pulses (CP: 
chickpea; CB: common bean). CB was fixed at 10%, and the other components 
(PR-PM-CP) were set at 60-15-15 (F1), 15-60-15 (F2), 15-15-60 (F3), and 30-30-30 
(F4), which were extruded at two combined conditions of feed moisture and screw 
speed: mild E1 (30% and 300 rpm) and severe E2 (18% and 600 rpm). The 
temperature profile was kept constant from 25 to 130 °C (from feed to output). 
The protein, dietary fiber, and ash contents in the raw formulations varied from 
11.2 to 17.4%, 9.8 to 15.0%, and 2.2 to 3.3%, respectively, according to the low 
or high pulse content in the blend. As more mechanical energy was delivered to 
the raw formulations (W·h/kg, 63.7 for E1 and 179.4 for E2), the extruded 
particles had increased water absorption (g/g) from 1.7 to 4.5 (E1) or 3.8 (E2), 
increased water solubility due to E2 from 10.9 to 20.9%, and decreased oil 
absorption (g/g) from 1.5 to 0.9 (E1 and E2). The peak viscosity (PV, cP) was 
noticeable only in the raw formulation F2 (355), which decreased 10.3% due to 
E1. In the other formulations, PV appeared due to E1 in F1 (528), F3 (420), and 
F4 (371), while it disappeared due to E2 in all formulations. However, at the E2 
condition, they did show cold viscosity in the initial stage (222 to 394 cP). 
The final viscosity (FV, cP) decreased from 795 to 390 (E1) or 123 (E2). In F2, 
the contents of phenolic compounds (285 µg GAE/g) and ABTS+ (13.2 μmol TE/g) 
were more than twice that in the other formulations, and their respective 
degradations were low due to E1 (4.2 and 12%) and high due to E2 (16 and 17%). 
Extrusion cooking did not cause significant changes in the luminosity (81) and 
redness (0.9) of particles, while yellowness increased from 15.7 to 18.2 (E1) or 
18.7 (E2). Based on these findings, it is concluded that both extrusion 
conditions improved the technological and functional properties. Regarding the 
formulations, F2 stood out for being rich in antioxidant capacity, which poorly 
degraded under the conditions studied. Further work is needed to contribute to 
understanding the optimization of formulas and processes that would improve the 
nutritional, sensorial, and functional properties while still preserving the 
bioactive value of the final products.

Probiotics are a critical component in fermented dairy products such as yogurt. 
An efficient method to enumerate probiotics in commercially produced yogurt is 
important, but traditional methods are time-consuming, sometimes taking up to 72 
hours. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid method using 
surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to identify and enumerate probiotic 
bacterial cells in yogurt. The identification and enumeration of three different 
probiotic bacterial strains, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus 
bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus were successfully conducted using a 
developed SERS protocol. L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus were also identified 
from a yogurt matrix using a simple extraction procedure utilizing a Percoll 
gradient. Statistical spectral analysis including principal component analysis 
and partial least squares regression analysis allowed for the differentiation, 
characterization and quantification of probiotic strains. The limits of 
detection were 105 CFU mL-1 for L. acidophilus, 104 CFU mL-1 for L. bulgaricus, 
and 106 CFU mL-1 for S. thermophilus. Quantification capability was tested up to 
108 cfu mL-1 and showed strong correlation coefficients (0.94, 0.98 and 0.95 
respectively) between predicted and actual concentrations. The presence of 
probiotic mixtures were clearly detectable from a yogurt food matrix starting at 
105 CFU mL-1. Sample analysis took less than three hours per sample set. Our 
results demonstrate the capability of SERS to detect and enumerate probiotics 
from a yogurt matrix rapidly.

Anthocyanins (ACNs), a class of flavonoid polyphenols responsible for 
pigmentation in plants, have garnered significant scientific interest for their 
potential health-promoting properties. Despite their demonstrated antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, and metabolic benefits, their clinical efficacy is limited by 
low bioavailability and structural instability during digestion. This review 
critically examines the chemical nature, dietary sources, and structural 
diversity of ACNs, with an emphasis on their metabolic fate and functional 
interaction with the gut microbiota. Special attention is given to the emerging 
role of encapsulation technologies in improving ACN stability, gastrointestinal 
delivery, and bioaccessibility. The paper highlights compelling evidence linking 
ACNs and their microbial-derived metabolites to enhanced gut health and 
attenuation of metabolic dysfunctions. Furthermore, it explores the 
bidirectional relationship between ACNs and gut microbiota, elucidating how 
microbial metabolism shapes ACN bioactivity and systemic effects. By integrating 
recent advancements in food chemistry, microbiology, and nutritional science, 
this review emphasizes the potential of encapsulated ACNs as functional 
ingredients in precision nutrition and metabolic health interventions.

The intake of alkylresorcinols and lignans in Spain is unknown due to the lack 
of information on the content of these compounds in particular foods. This paper 
describes the development of the first alkylresorcinol and lignan database 
adapted to the Spanish diet, including foods items especially relevant for this 
population. The values of alkylresorcinols and lignans in common foods and 
beverages were collected from scientific publications in refereed journals, and 
other foods particularly consumed in Spain, for which values were not available, 
were analyzed by standardized protocols and included into the database. The 
Alignia database presents the content of alkylresorcinols in 88 food items and 
the lignan content of 593 foods and beverages. Using the database, the intake of 
lignans in Spain, calculated using data from the Food Composition Panel based on 
household consumption, was estimated to be 0.76 mg/day.

The presence of stilbenes in wine is becoming an important issue due to their 
claimed relation to a low incidence in coronary diseases and their increasing 
implication as cancer chemopreventive and neuroprotective agents. Total 
resveratrol content, quantified as glucoside and aglycone forms of resveratrol, 
has been determined in a survey of 45 Monastrell monovarietal Spanish red wine 
types (around 135 wine samples), belonging to Alicante and Bullas appellations. 
The average between ratio glucoside/aglycone forms of resveratrol in these wines 
was considerably high, ranging from 82 to 91% of resveratrol in its glycosidic 
form. This characteristic was observed in a high percentage of the studied 
wines, which were made under different winemaking procedures, and from different 
vintages (1995-2002). In addition, wines made using macerative fermentations 
with double amount of solid parts (""doble pasta"") reached the highest levels of 
total stilbene content expressed as resveratrol equivalent, i.e., 30 mg/L 
(average of 18.8 mg/L). It can be concluded that high resveratrol glucoside 
concentration and low free isomer content can be considered characteristics of 
the Monastrell variety, as it happens to red wines deriving from other varieties 
grown at warm climates. This fact, also observed for other French and Portuguese 
red varieties, might play an important role in food habits involving these types 
of wines.

Plasma levels of the lignans enterodiol and enterolactone, and also the 
isoflavonic phyto-oestrogens daidzein, equol and genistein, are reported for 
postmenopausal Australian women consuming a traditional diet supplemented with 
linseed, soya flour or clover sprouts. Analysis was performed by gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry, after enzymatic hydrolysis and ion-exchange 
chromatography. Following linseed supplementation, combined levels of 
enterolactone and enterodiol reached 500 ng/ml, whereas after soya flour or 
clover sprouts the respective concentrations of equol, daidzein and genistein 
reached 43, 312 and 148 ng/ml. Not all subjects were able to produce equol from 
daidzein. The possible relationship and role of these weak dietary oestrogens as 
restraining factors in the development of hormone-dependent cancers in Asian 
populations is discussed.

Sensor array is a new method used in aroma analysis. This technique was employed 
for the differentiation of 49 pure Valencia orange juices from 5 different 
origins representative of the main culture areas of citrus according to their 
volatile organic fractions. An experimental design was used to set analytical 
factors, which control the generation of the static headspace; therefore, the 
preliminary optimization of analytical conditions allows the evaluation of the 
potential of such an apparatus in this kind of survey. Results obtained were 
then statistically treated by multivariate analyses such as principal component 
analysis and factorial discriminant analysis. Sensor arrays performed a good 
discrimination of the whole juices in classing them according to the origin of 
Valencia oranges used. A calibration of the sensors was then performed to build 
a database aiming to classify the juices according to the origin of oranges 
involved. New supplementary samples were then analyzed to assess the efficiency 
of the database. This technique coupled with other ones such as high-pressure 
liquid chromatography and gas chromatography may be a new tool for the 
investigation of adulteration detection due to the authentication of the origin 
of raw materials employed in the orange juice processes.

Fruits from 107 genotypes of Vaccinium L., Rubus L., and Ribes L., were analyzed 
for total anthocyanins (ACY), total phenolics (TPH), and antioxidant capacities 
as determined by oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC) and ferric reducing 
antioxidant power (FRAP). Fruit size was highly correlated (r = 0.84) with ACY 
within Vaccinium corymbosum L., but was not correlated to ACY across eight other 
Vaccinium species, or within 27 blackberry hybrids. Certain Vaccinium and Ribes 
fruits with pigmented flesh were lower in ACY, TPH, ORAC, and FRAP compared to 
those values in berries with nonpigmented flesh. ORAC values ranged from 19 to 
131 micromol Trolox equivalents/g in Vaccinium, from 13 to 146 in Rubus, and 
from 17 to 116 in Ribes. Though ACY may indicate TPH, the range observed in 
ACY/TPH ratios precludes prediction of ACY from TPH and vice versa for a single 
genotype. In general, TPH was more highly correlated to antioxidant capacity 
than ACY was. This study demonstrates the wide diversity of phytochemical levels 
and antioxidant capacities within and across three genera of small fruit.

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics and metabolomics tackle the complex 
interactions between proteins and metabolites in fruits. Independently used to 
discern phenotypic disparities among plant accessions, these analytical 
approaches complement well-established DNA fingerprinting methods for assessing 
genetic variability and hereditary distance. To verify the applicability of 
integrated proteomic and metabolomic procedures in evaluating phenotypic 
differences between sweet cherry cultivars, and to potentially relate these 
findings to specific pomological traits, we conducted a comparative analysis of 
fruits from ten Italian accessions. We identified 3786 proteins, of which 288 
exhibited differential representation between ecotypes, including key components 
influencing fruit quality and allergenic potential. Furthermore, 64 polyphenols 
were identified, encompassing anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, flavanols, 
hydroxybenzoic acids, flavonols, and flavanones subgroups. Multivariate analysis 
of total quantitative data outlined cultivar differences and phenotypic 
relationships. Coherent associations between proteomic and metabolomic data 
underscored their complementary role in characterizing genetic relationships 
elucidated through DNA fingerprinting techniques. Proteo-metabolomic results 
verified a certain correlation between the relative abundance of specific 
polyphenols, enzymes involved in their metabolism, and color characteristics of 
fruits. These findings highlight the significance of integrating results from 
diverse omics approaches to reveal molecular drivers of ecotype-specific traits 
and identify biomarkers for selecting and breeding cultivars in the next future.

The health-promoting effects of whole-grain wheat likely derive from phenolic 
compounds and other antioxidants that also make wheat a potential source of 
functional food ingredients. The objective of this study was to determine the 
effects of genotype and growing environment on the phenolic contents and 
antioxidant activities of alcohol-soluble extracts from commercial wheat 
cultivars. Total phenolic contents (TPCs), antioxidant activities (AOAs), and 
concentrations of six phenolic acids were measured in six red- and white-grained 
hard spring wheat genotypes grown at four diverse locations in Western Canada 
during the 2003 crop year. There were significant differences among genotypes 
and environments for TPC, AOA, and concentrations of all the phenolic acids 
measured. The predominant indicators of antioxidant potential, i.e., TPC, AOA, 
and ferulic acid (FA) concentration were highly intercorrelated (r > 0.72). For 
these indices, the Canada Western (CW) Red Spring wheat cultivars Neepawa and AC 
Elsa had the highest levels, whereas an analogous CW hard white spring wheat 
cultivar, AC Snowbird, had the lowest levels. Grain color did not appear to be a 
factor in the expression of antioxidant-related parameters. For both TPC and 
AOA, as well as for vanillic acid, syringic acid, and ferulic acid, 
environmental effects were considerably larger than genotype effects. Neither 
growing temperature nor rainfall from anthesis to maturity appeared to be 
related to the environmental variation that was observed. Genotype x environment 
interaction was small for all parameters compared with genotype and location 
effects and was significant only for TPC. Genotype variation for antioxidant 
properties indicates that it would be possible to select for these quantitative 
traits in a breeding program. However, the significant environmental variation 
observed would delay and/or complicate this process.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ultrasound used as a 
preliminary treatment and drying temperature on the properties of dried apples 
(var. Golden Delicious). The aim of the work was also to optimise the process in 
terms of reducing the drying time and obtaining a product with specific 
properties. The apple tissue was sonicated for various times from 30 to 60 min. 
Then, the tissue was air-dried with a constant air flow of 55 to 85 °C. The work 
determined the dry substance content, water activity, colour parameters, 
content, antioxidant activity, and hygroscopicity of the dried material. The 
drying kinetics were also analysed. The results showed that the decrease in 
sonification time increased the dry matter content and reduced water activity. 
Also, the decrease in drying temperature caused a smaller intake of water and 
led to a lower hygroscopicity of dried apples. The selected parameters of the 
process had a positive effect on the preservation of bioactive compounds and led 
to an increase in antioxidant activity. Experimental results were adapted by a 
second-order polynomial model, where analysis of variance was utilized to define 
optimal drying conditions. Therefore, considering the shortest drying time, the 
lowest colour difference, ΔE, and the highest antioxidant activity, the best 
condition for the drying of apple tissue can be obtained with the application of 
30 min of samples sonication and drying of apples at a temperature of 80.9 °C.

Two novel iridoid-phenylethanoid glycoside heterodimers, verbenalinoside A (1) 
and B (2), along with two known precursors, verbenalin (3) and verbascoside (4) 
were isolated from the dry aerial parts of Verbena officinalis. Verbenalinoside 
A (1) possesses a new 5/6/6/6 core fused by the double bond of iridoid and 
phenolic hydroxyl groups of the phenylethanoid unit. Verbenalinoside B (2) is a 
conjugate of verbenalin (3) and verbascoside (4) by an ether bond. The 
structures of these compounds were elucidated through the comprehensive analysis 
of spectroscopic data, supported by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) 
calculations and DP4 plus NMR calculations. Biological assay results showed that 
1-4 can concentration-dependent rescue the ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity in LO2 
and HepG2 cells, indicating that 1-4 should be potential hepatoprotective 
constituents of V. officinalis.

Flax (Linum usitatissimum) seed provides a nonabsorbable fiber which has been 
used as a laxative and has also been used topically to treat various skin 
conditions. Flaxseed oil contains alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is partially 
converted into the omega-3-fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in the body. Flaxseed oil increases the ALA content 
of breastmilk, but does not increase the DHA content. Maternal intake of 
preformed DHA, primarily derived from seafood or other marine oils, is required 
to increase breastmilk DHA content.[1,2] Flaxseed is generally well tolerated in 
adults, with occasional allergic skin reactions occurring. Very limited data 
exist on the safety and efficacy of flaxseed oil in nursing mothers or infants. 
However, supplementation of infant formula with ALA appears to improve the 
infant's DHA status.[3] Flaxseed used by the nursing mother as a laxative or 
topical poultice are not expected to adversely affect the breastfed infant. 
Flaxseed oil can be used during lactation, but is not effective in counteracting 
a low maternal DHA intake, as in vegetarian or vegan diets. Flax seed is a 
purported galactogogue,[4] but one study found that it was not effective. 
Dietary supplements do not require extensive pre-marketing approval from the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Manufacturers are responsible to ensure the 
safety, but do not need to prove the safety and effectiveness of dietary 
supplements before they are marketed. Dietary supplements may contain multiple 
ingredients, and differences are often found between labeled and actual 
ingredients or their amounts. A manufacturer may contract with an independent 
organization to verify the quality of a product or its ingredients, but that 
does not certify the safety or effectiveness of a product. Because of the above 
issues, clinical testing results on one product may not be applicable to other 
products. More detailed information about dietary supplements is available 
elsewhere on the LactMed Web site.

A HPLC-MS procedure for the sensitive and specific analysis of the black tea 
flavonoid theaflavin in human plasma and urine was developed. Levels were 
measured after enzymatic deconjugation, extraction into ethyl acetate, and 
separation by HPLC, using tandem mass spectrometry as a detecting system. Two 
healthy volunteers consumed 700 mg theaflavins, equivalent to about 30 cups of 
black tea. The maximum concentration detected in blood plasma was 1.0 microg 
l(-1) in a sample collected after 2 h. The concentration in urine also peaked 
after 2 h at 4.2 microg l(-1). Hence, only minute amounts of theaflavins can be 
detected in plasma and urine samples of healthy volunteers after ingestion.

Scottish-grown red raspberries are a rich source of vitamin C and phenolics, 
most notably, the anthocyanins cyanidin-3-sophoroside, 
cyanidin-3-(2(G)-glucosylrutinoside), and cyanidin-3-glucoside, and two 
ellagitannins, sanguiin H-6 and lambertianin C, which are present together with 
trace levels of flavonols, ellagic acid, and hydroxycinnamates. The antioxidant 
capacity of the fresh fruit and the levels of vitamin C and phenolics were not 
affected by freezing. When fruit were stored at 4 degrees C for 3 days and then 
at 18 degrees C for 24 h, mimicking the route fresh fruit takes after harvest to 
the supermarket and onto the consumer's table, anthocyanin levels were 
unaffected while vitamin C levels declined and those of elligitannins increased, 
and overall, there was no effect on the antioxidant capacity of the fruit. It is 
concluded, therefore, that freshly picked, fresh commercial, and frozen 
raspberries all contain similar levels of phytochemicals and antioxidants per 
serving.

It is essential to have a thorough knowledge of the bioavailability and 
metabolism of dietary flavonols to understand their role in disease prevention. 
Lightly fried onions containing 275 micromol flavonols, principally 
quercetin-4'-glucoside and quercetin-3,4'-diglucoside, were fed to healthy human 
volunteers and plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period. Samples were 
analysed by HPLC with diode array and tandem mass spectrometric detection. Five 
flavonol metabolites, quercetin-3'-sulphate, quercetin-3-glucuronide, 
isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide, a quercetin diglucuronide and a quercetin 
glucuronide sulphate, were detected in plasma in quantifiable amounts with trace 
quantities of six additional quercetin metabolites. Sub-micromolar peak plasma 
concentrations (Cmax) of quercetin-3'-sulphate, quercetin-3-glucuronide, 
isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide and quercetin diglucuronide were observed 0.6-0.8 h 
after ingestion. In contrast, the Cmax of quercetin glucuronide sulphate was 2.5 
h. The elimination half-lives (t1/2) of quercetin-3'-sulphate, 
quercetin-3-glucuronide and quercetin diglucuronide were 1.71, 2.33 and 1.76 h 
respectively, while the t1/2 of isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide was 5.34 h and that 
of quercetin glucuronide sulphate was 4.54 h. The profile of metabolites 
excreted in urine was markedly different to that of plasma with many of the 
major urinary components, including quercetin-3'-glucuronide, two quercetin 
glucoside sulphates and a methylquercetin diglucuronide, absent or present in 
only trace amounts in the bloodstream indicative of substantial phase II 
metabolism. Total urinary excretion of quercetin metabolites was 12.9 micromol, 
corresponding to 4.7 % of intake. If these samples had been subjected to 
hydrolysis, as in many previous studies, only quercetin and isorhamnetin would 
have been detected and quantified. The bioactivity of these metabolites should 
be considered.

The bioavailability of dietary phytochemicals may be influenced by the food 
matrix in which they are consumed. In this study the impact of a full-fat yogurt 
on the bioavailability and metabolism of orange juice flavanones was 
investigated. Human plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period after the 
consumption of 250 mL of orange juice containing a total of 168 micromol of 
hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside and 12 micromol of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside, with and 
without 150 mL of full-fat yogurt. The juice also contained 1 g of paracetamol 
and 5 g of lactulose. HPLC-MS(2) analysis revealed the accumulation of 
hesperetin-7-O-glucuronide, and an unassigned hesperetin-O-glucuronide 
metabolite in plasma reached a peak concentration (C(max)) of 924 +/- 224 
nmol/L, 4.4 +/- 0.5 h (T(max)) after orange juice ingestion. The T(max) is 
indicative of absorption in the colon. When the juice was consumed with yogurt, 
neither the C(max) at 661 +/- 170 nmol/L nor the T(max) at 5.1 +/- 0.4 h were 
significantly different from those obtained with juice alone. The two hesperetin 
glucuronides were also excreted in urine along with a third 
hesperetin-O-glucuronide, two hesperetin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfates, a 
hesperetin-O-diglucuronide, a naringenin-O-diglucuronide, and, tentatively 
identified, naringenin-7-O-glucuronide and naringenin-4'-O-glucuronide. This 
indicates the occurrence of substantial, postabsorption, phase II metabolism 
prior to urinary excretion. The quantity of flavanone metabolites excreted 0-5 h 
after orange juice ingestion was significantly reduced by yogurt, but over the 
full 0-24 h urine collection period, the amounts excreted, corresponding to ca. 
7.0% of intake, were not affected by the addition of yogurt to the drink. Nor 
did yogurt have a significant effect on gastric emptying, as determined by 
plasma paracetamol levels, or on the mouth to cecum transit time of the head of 
the meal, assessed by measurement of lactulose-derived breath hydrogen. There is 
also a discussion of the merits of studies of the absorption and metabolism of 
flavanones based on direct analysis of metabolites by HPLC-MS and the more 
traditional indirect approach where samples are treated with a mollusc 
glucuronidase/sulfatase preparation prior to HPLC analysis of the released 
aglycones.

Plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period after the consumption by 
humans of 200 g of strawberries, containing 222 micromol of pelargonidin-3- 
O-glucoside, with and without cream. The main metabolite, a pelargonidin- 
O-glucuronide, reached a peak plasma concentration ( C max) of 274 +/- 24 nmol/L 
after 1.1 +/- 0.4 h ( t max) when only strawberries were ingested. When the 
strawberries were eaten with cream, the C max was not statistically different 
but the t max at 2.4 +/- 0.5 h was delayed significantly ( p < 0.001). The 
pelargonidin- O-glucuronide, along with smaller quantities of other metabolites, 
was also excreted in urine in quantities corresponding to ca. 1% of anthocyanin 
intake. The quantities excreted over the 0-24 h collection period were not 
influenced significantly by cream. However, the 0-2 h excretion of anthocyanin 
metabolites was significantly lower when the strawberries were eaten with cream, 
whereas the reverse occurred during with the 5-8 h excretion period. In keeping 
with these observations, measurement of plasma paracetamol and breath hydrogen 
revealed that cream delayed gastric emptying and extended mouth to cecum transit 
time.

Tanreqing injection (TRQI), a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, has a 
marked curative effect on lower respiratory tract infections. A strategy using 
ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight 
tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MSE) for rapid identification of 
metabolites from TRQI was proposed by UNIFI informatics platform combined with 
multiple data processing techniques. Target prediction was then performed based 
on the original compounds in vivo, and a network between the active compounds 
and common targets was established using Cytoscape v3.9.0. As a result, 64 
original compounds were characterized in TRQI, and 54 original compounds and 76 
metabolites of TRQI were detected in human plasma and urine, two of which (M28 
and M45) were novel metabolites. A novel metabolic pathway for lonicerin was 
identified. The compound-target-pathway network identified 22 target genes and 
20 signaling pathways that were linked to these mechanisms. The key mechanism is 
related to the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The 
bioactive ingredients and mechanisms of action of TQRI against lower respiratory 
tract infections based on original compounds in vivo were explored through 
network pharmacology and molecular docking. This is the first study in which the 
mechanism of action of TRQI in humans has been clarified.

Diet is an important lifestyle factor which influences people's health and the 
prevention of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Cereal-based foods 
constitute the main component of the everyday diet worldwide. Old cereal species 
like spelt (Triticum spelta L.) are becoming more and more popular, especially 
in Europe. This review focuses on the role of bioactive compounds from spelt and 
their possible biological mechanisms of action in glycemic control. Spelt grain 
contains a high amount of dietary fiber, which can modulate postprandial 
glycemia. Other phytochemicals, such as phytic acid and alkylresorcinols, also 
contribute to controlling blood glucose levels, insulin sensitivity and 
hiperinsulinemia. Antioxidant compounds present in spelt grain may act as 
protection from negative outcomes of chronic hyperglycemia. In this paper the 
composition and beneficial properties of spelt are also compared with those of 
widely consumed cereals like common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The health 
benefits of whole grain as opposed to refined products are also discussed.

Neuroinflammation generally refers to an inflammatory response within the 
central nervous system caused by various pathological insults, including 
infection, trauma, ischemia, and toxins. As the brain's sentinel immune cell, 
microglia are tasked as the first responders to infection or tissue injury and 
initiating an inflammatory response. The perennial shrub plant Rosmarinus 
officinalis L. was reported to possess anti-inflammatory, anticancer, 
anti-nociceptive, antidiabetic, neuroprotective, and antioxidative properties. 
The present study aimed to investigate the effects of Rosmarinus officinalis 
ethanolic extracts on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation 
model of BV-2 cells in comparison to carnosol and carnosic acid, phenolic 
diterpenes of the plant. Ultrasound-assisted extraction was used to have 
ethanolic extract of the plant. LPS was used to induce inflammation in BV-2 
cells. Tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) secretion, 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, GSH/GSSG ratio, protein carbonyl 
level, and caspase-3 activity were evaluated. Inflammation induced by LPS was 
reduced by the ethanolic extract. Both carnosol and carnosic acid decreased the 
TNF-α and IL-1β levels as well. The ethanolic extract reduced ROS production and 
protein carbonylation, and increased GSH/GSSG ratio more effectively compared to 
the effects of carnosol and carnosic acid. Results depicted that caspase-3 
activity was reduced by the ethanolic extract and this effect was more 
pronounced compared to carnosol and carnosic acid. The present study indicates 
the ethanolic extract of Rosmarinus officinalis rescues BV-2 cells from 
apoptosis via alleviating inflammation and oxidative stress.

A national sampling plan was developed to select the most widely used 
isoflavone-containing foods in the United States. Foods were selected based on 
their retail volume and sampled in five geographical areas representing seven 
metropolitan areas. Isoflavones were analyzed from composite samples, raw and 
cooked, and reported by brand. Quality control measures were evaluated 
throughout the study. Isoflavone levels ranged from 1 microg/g in soy sauces to 
540 microg/g in tempeh. Soymilk and tofu represented the major portion of soy 
foods evaluated. These data will appear in the electronic version of USDA 
Handbook No. 8 of Food Composition Data in 1999.

Plant factories with artificial lighting (PFALs) are a notable choice for urban 
agriculture due to the system's benefits, where light can be manipulated to 
enhance the product's yield and quality. Our objective was to test the effect of 
light spectra with different red-blue combinations and white light on the 
growth, physiology, and overall quality of three baby-leaf vegetables (green 
lettuce, kale, and pak choi) grown in a restaurant's PFAL. Leaf mass per area 
was lower under the most blue-containing treatments in all species. The 
performance indices (PIabs and PItot) of the photosynthetic apparatus were lower 
under more red light with the exception of PIabs in pak choi. Total soluble 
solids accumulation was diminished under most of the blue-containing LEDs, while 
total phenolics and antioxidant activity were induced by red-blue environments 
rich in blue light. Moreover, chlorophyll and carotenoid accumulation was also 
enhanced under blue-rich light treatments. Nitrate content was the lowest under 
monochromatic blue in all species. Finally, the employees were asked about their 
views on the PFAL within the restaurant's compounds and they expressed positive 
opinions. Overall, a light environment including red and blue wavelengths proved 
beneficial for baby leafy vegetable production in terms of yield and quality.

The inhibition and eradication of oral biofilms is increasingly focused on the 
use of plant extracts as mouthwashes and toothpastes adjuvants. Here, we report 
on the chemical composition and the antibiofilm activity of 15 methanolic 
extracts of Iris species against both mono-(Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
Staphylococcus aureus) and multi-species oral biofilms (Streptococcus gordonii, 
Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, and Actinomyces 
naeslundii). The phytochemical profiles of Iris pallida s.l., Iris versicolor 
L., Iris lactea Pall., Iris carthaliniae Fomin, and Iris germanica were 
determined by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution 
tandem mass spectroscopy (UHPLC-HRMS/MS) analysis, and a total of 180 compounds 
were identified among Iris species with (iso)flavonoid dominancy. I. pallida, I. 
versicolor, and I. germanica inhibited both the quorum sensing and adhesion 
during biofilm formation in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the 
extracts were less active against maturated biofilms. Of the five tested 
species, Iris pallida s.l. was the most effective at both inhibiting biofilm 
formation and disrupting existing biofilms, and the leaf extract exhibited the 
strongest inhibitory effect compared to the root and rhizome extracts. The 
cytotoxicity of the extracts was excluded in human fibroblasts. The inhibition 
of bacterial adhesion significantly correlated with myristic acid content, and 
quorum sensing inhibition correlated with the 7-β-hydroxystigmast-4-en-3-one 
content. These findings could be useful for establishing an effective tool for 
the control of oral biofilms and thus dental diseases.

Neochlorogenic acid (3-CQA) and cryptochlorogenic acid (4-CQA), isolated from 
prune (Prunus domestica L.), were identified by NMR and MS analyses. In 
addition, the quantity of chlorogenic acid isomers in prune were measured by 
HPLC. These isomers, 3-CQA, 4-CQA, and chlorogenic acid (5-CQA), were contained 
in the ratio 78.7:18. 4:3.9, respectively. 4-CQA was identified and quantified 
in prune for the first time, and relatively high amounts of this isomer were 
characteristic. Antioxidative activities of the chlorogenic acid isomers, such 
as scavenging activity on superoxide anion radicals and inhibitory effect 
against oxidation of methyl linoleate, were also evaluated. Each isomer showed 
antioxidative activities which were almost the same.

BACKGROUND: Coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of several 
chronic diseases in a dose-dependent manner. Chronic intake results in the 
transient appearance of bioactive phenolic metabolites in the circulatory 
system. However, there is a lack of information on the impact of different 
patterns of coffee consumption on plasma and urinary profiles of phenolic 
metabolites.
OBJECTIVES: Plasma and urinary phenolic metabolites were investigated following 
regular consumption of different daily dosages of coffee or cocoa-based products 
containing coffee (CBPCC) under a real-life setting.
METHODS: A repeated-dose, randomized, crossover human intervention was conducted 
with 21 healthy volunteers. For 1 mo, participants consumed 1) 1 cup of coffee 
(1C), 2) 3 cups of coffee (3C), or 3) 1 cup of coffee + 2 CBPCC twice daily 
(PC). Plasma and urine samples were collected over a 24-h period after each 
treatment. The nutrikinetics and urinary excretion of native, human phase II, 
and colonic metabolites were assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 51 (poly)phenolic metabolites were quantified, with 41 
metabolites being strictly related to coffee consumption. Significant 
differences were observed among treatments for most of the metabolites. The 
metabolites present in the highest amounts were the hydroxycinnamate, 
phenylpropanoic acid, benzaldehyde, and benzene classes, along with 
(-)-epicatechin and phenyl-γ-valerolactone derivatives after PC treatment. Daily 
average concentrations did not exceed 200 nmol/L and were <100 nmol/L for most 
of the metabolites. The excretion of coffee phenolics ranged from 40% to 70% of 
intake, indicating that coffee hydroxycinnamates are notably more bioavailable 
than previously thought. Interindividual variability was also investigated.
CONCLUSIONS: The absorption, metabolism, nutrikinetic profile, and 
bioavailability of coffee phenolics were established for different patterns of 
coffee consumption under real-life conditions. This work provides the basis for 
further nutritional epidemiology research and mode-of-action cell-based studies. 
This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03166540.

Shanlan rice, a unique drought-resistant rice germplasm resource in Hainan 
Province, China, holds significant potential for rice genetic improvement and 
breeding innovation. However, its genetic diversity and significance in rice 
breeding remain inadequately explored. This study conducted a comprehensive

of 84 Shanlan rice accessions. It was revealed that colored Shanlan rice 
accessions exhibited significantly higher total phenolic content (249.00-2408.33 
mg gallic acid equivalents per 100 g of rice flour (mg GAE/100 g)) and 
antioxidant capacity (DPPH: 680.39-809.63 micromoles of Trolox equivalent per 
100 g (μmol TE/100 g); ABTS: 529.93-1917.77 μmol TE/100 g) compared to 
white-grained varieties. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis 
identified eight phenolic acids in the bound fractions, among which the sinapic 
acid (55.08 μg/g) and vanillic acid (11.72 μg/g) were predominant, accounting 
for over 60% of total bound phenolic acid content. A genome-wide association 
study (GWAS) identified 84 significant loci associated with these 
phenolic-related traits. A major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 7 
for free phenolic content, total phenolic content, flavonoids, and DPPH activity 
was co-located at the Rc gene locus, a key regulator of red pericarp 
pigmentation and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis. Haplotype analysis identified 
ten haplotypes in Rc, with the haplotype H002 showing the highest antioxidant 
capacity. Another QTL on chromosome 11 was associated with p-coumaric, vanillic, 
and sinapic acids, although no significant difference was observed in haplotype 
analysis. These results highlight Rc as a key genetic factor underlying 
antioxidant properties in rice, while other loci require further validation. 
This research provides a foundation for breeding health-benefit, 
drought-tolerant rice cultivars using Hainan's unique germplasm.

In spite of the wide literature describing the biological effects of phenolic 
compounds, scarce data are available on their absorption from diet. In the 
present work, we studied the absorption in humans of phenolic acids from beer, a 
common beverage rich in different phenolic acids with related chemical 
structures. Beer was analyzed for free and total (free+bound) phenolic acids. 
Ferulic, caffeic and sinapic acids were present in beer mainly as bound forms, 
while 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and p-coumaric acid were present mainly as free 
forms. Vanillic acid was present equally in the free and bound forms. Plasma 
samples were collected before and 30 and 60 min after beer administration and 
analyzed for free and conjugated phenolic acid content. A significant two- to 
fourfold increase in plasma levels of phenolic acids was detected with peak 
concentrations at 30 min after beer ingestion. 4-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid was 
present in plasma mainly as nonconjugated forms while p-coumaric acid was 
present equally as nonconjugated and conjugated forms. Ferulic, vanillic and 
caffeic acids were present in plasma predominantly as conjugated forms, with a 
slight prevalence of sulfates with respect to glucuronates. Our results indicate 
that phenolic acids from beer are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and 
are present in blood after being largely metabolized to the form of glucuronide 
and sulfate conjugates. The extent of conjugation is related to the chemical 
structure of phenolic acids: the monohydroxy derivatives showing the lowest 
conjugation degree and the dihydroxy derivatives showing the highest one.

The available information on drug residue stability in chicken egg is scarce. 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the stability of drug residues in 
egg under different traditional cooking procedures. Fresh eggs were spiked with 
different drug concentrations of albendazole (ABZ) and its albendazole 
sulphoxide (ABZSO) and albendazole sulphone (ABZSO2) metabolites; flubendazole 
(FLBZ) and its reduced flubendazole (R-FLBZ) and hydrolyzed flubendazole 
(H-FLBZ) metabolites; amoxicillin (AMX); and enrofloxacin (EFX) and its 
ciprofloxacin (CFX) metabolite. The egg samples were cooked in different ways, 
namely, boiling, microwaving, and omelette making. Drug residue concentrations 
in egg were quantified by HPLC with UV or fluorescence detectors. ABZ and ABZSO 
concentrations in egg were not affected by boiling and microwaving, while the 
omelette processing significantly reduced these molecules. Residues of ABZSO2 in 
egg were stable or increased after all cooking procedures. In contrast, FLBZ and 
its metabolites FLBZ-H and FLBZ-R residues in egg decreased after all 
treatments. The residue concentration quantified for EFX and CFX did not show 
significant changes after any cooking method. AMX residues were unstable, with 
extremely significant drug reduction after all cooking processes. Conventional 
methods of egg cooking cannot be considered a tool to eliminate all veterinary 
drug residues.

Vinegar is a versatile product used for food preservation, cooking, healthcare, 
and cleaning. In this study, 80 vinegar of different raw materials, aging time, 
and for the first time by the agronomic method of raw material cultivation were 
classified by spectralprint techniques with chemometrics. Datasets were obtained 
by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), Fourier transforms mid-infrared 
(FT-IR), near-infrared (NIR), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis); then evaluated 
by common dimension (ComDim) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis 
(PLS-DA). NMR with PLS-DA had the best prediction performance compared to other 
techniques, with accuracy values between 92.3 and 100 %, followed by FT-IR and 
UV-vis of 80.8 and 96.0 % and NIR between 69.2 and 84.0 %. The results indicated 
that the classification of vinegar according to the agronomic cultivation method 
is more complex than aging time or raw material. However, any of these 
spectralprint techniques have demonstrated that they can be used in the 
classification of vinegar.

The antioxidant polyphenols in cacao liquor, a major ingredient of chocolate and 
cocoa, have been characterized as flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidin oligomers. 
In this study, various cacao products were analyzed by normal-phase HPLC, and 
the profiles and quantities of the polyphenols present, grouped by molecular 
size (monomers to approximately oligomers), were compared. Individual cacao 
polyphenols, flavan-3-ols (catechin and epicatechin), and dimeric (procyanidin 
B2), trimeric (procyanidin C1), and tetrameric (cinnamtannin A2) 
proanthocyanidins, and galactopyranosyl-ent-(-)-epicatechin (2alpha-->7, 
4alpha-->8)-(-)-epicatechin (Gal-EC-EC), were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC 
and/or HPLC/MS. The profile of monomers (catechins) and proanthocyanidin in dark 
chocolate was similar to that of cacao liquor, while the ratio of flavan-3-ols 
to the total amount of monomeric and oligomeric polyphenols in the case of pure 
cocoa powder was higher than that in the case of cacao liquor or chocolate.

(-)-epicatechin is one of the most potent antioxidants present in the human 
diet. Particularly high levels are found in black tea, apples, and chocolate. 
High intake of catechins has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular 
diseases. There have been several reports concerning the bioavailability of 
catechins, however, the chemical structure of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in 
blood, tissues, and urine remains unclear. In the present study, we purified and 
elucidated the chemical structure of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in human and 
rat urine after oral administration. Three metabolites were purified from human 
urine including (-)-epicatechin-3'-O-glucuronide, 
4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-3'-O-glucuronide, and 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-5 
or 7-O-glucuronide, according to 1H- and 13C-NMR, HMBC, and LC-MS analyses. The 
metabolites purified from rat urine were 3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin, 
(-)-epicatechin-7-O-glucuronide, and 
3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-7-O-glucuronide. These compounds were also detected 
in the blood of humans and rats by LC-MS. The presence of these metabolites in 
blood and urine suggests that catechins are metabolized and circulated in the 
body after administration of catechin-containing foods.

This research evaluated how both the maize alkaline cooking processes 
(traditional and extrusion-based nixtamalization) and tortilla baking step 
affect the chemical composition, physicochemical parameters, antioxidant 
activity, and phytochemical compounds in tortillas made from QPM. While the 
chemical composition of QPM was largely unaffected by the alkaline processing 
methods, extrusion-based nixtamalization exhibited a higher retention of total 
phenolic compounds (94% retention compared to 72% in the traditional 
nixtamalization process), and antioxidant activity (87-98% retention compared to 
56-66% in the traditional nixtamalization process by ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP 
methods). Furthermore, alkaline extrusion led to higher melanoidin formation, 
compounds associated with antioxidant properties. Nevertheless, the tortilla 
baking step slightly reduced lipid content, it did not significantly alter 
(chemical composition, total phenolic content, and antioxidant activity) the 
other key nutritional and functional properties. Although the subsequent baking 
step slightly reduced the melanoidin content initially formed during both 
nixtamalization processes, the overall melanoidin content in the final extruded 
tortilla remained higher than in the traditional nixtamalized one. This was 
supported by the observed color darkening (reduction in Hunter L value and 
increase in ΔE), which is indicative of Maillard reaction products, including 
melanoidins. These findings support the potential of extrusion processing as a 
more sustainable and health-promoting method for producing QPM-based tortillas.

Coffee is the most popular beverage containing numerous phytochemical components 
that have antioxidant activity capable of scavenging free radicals. Antioxidant 
and phenolic contents have considerable benefits for human health. The aim of 
this study was the molecular identification of 9 coffee samples from the Nepal 
Agricultural Research Council, Lalitpur, Nepal, and the determination of the 
antioxidant activity and total phenolic content of green and roasted coffee 
beans. Molecular identification was performed using ITS-specific PCR followed by 
sequencing and phylogenetic tree construction using the maximum parsimony 
method. The DPPH assay was used to determine the antioxidant activity, and the 
Folin-Ciocalteu (F-C) assay was used to determine the total phenolic content. 
All the samples belonged to the taxa Coffea arabica. The antioxidant activity in 
roasted beans varied from 2.49 to 4.62 AAE mg/g and from 1.4 to 3.9 AAE mg/g in 
green beans. The total phenolic content varied from 2.58 to 3.38 GAE mg/g and 
from 4.16 to 5.36 GAE mg/g for the roasted beans and green beans, respectively. 
The data revealed that the highest antioxidant content (4.62 AAE mg/g) was found 
in roasted coffee and that the highest phenolic content (5.36 GAE mg/g) was 
found in green coffee. The study concludes that roasting increases the 
antioxidant activity but decreases the phenolic content of coffee.

Catechins are polyphenolic plant compounds (flavonoids) that may offer 
significant health benefits to humans. These benefits stem largely from their 
anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, and antimutagenic properties. Recent 
epidemiological studies suggest that the consumption of flavonoid-containing 
foods is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Chocolate is a 
natural cocoa bean-based product that reportedly contains high levels of 
monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric catechins. We have applied solid-liquid 
extraction and liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical 
ionization-mass spectrometry to the identification and determination of the 
predominant monomeric catechins, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin, in a baking 
chocolate Standard Reference Material (NIST Standard Reference Material 2384). 
(+)-Catechin and (-)-epicatechin are detected and quantified in chocolate 
extracts on the basis of selected-ion monitoring of their protonated [M + H](+) 
molecular ions. Tryptophan methyl ester is used as an internal standard. The 
developed method has the capacity to accurately quantify as little as 0.1 
microg/mL (0.01 mg of catechin/g of chocolate) of either catechin in chocolate 
extracts, and the method has additionally been used to certify (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin levels in the baking chocolate Standard Reference Material. This 
is the first reported use of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry for the 
quantitative determination of monomeric catechins in chocolate and the only 
report certifying monomeric catechin levels in a food-based Standard Reference 
Material.

Human metabolism of mammalian lignan precursors in raw and processed flaxseed.

Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

BACKGROUND: The mammalian lignans enterolactone and enterodiol are produced in 
the colon by the action of bacteria on the plant precursor secoisolariciresinol 
diglycoside, which is found in high concentrations in flaxseed.
OBJECTIVE: Two experiments were conducted to determine 1) whether there is a 
dose response in urinary lignan excretion with increasing flaxseed intake, 2) 
whether flaxseed processing affects lignan excretion, 3) peak plasma lignan 
concentrations, and 4) plasma lignan concentrations after chronic 
supplementation.
DESIGN: Nine healthy young women supplemented their diets with 5, 15, or 25 g 
raw or 25 g processed (muffin or bread) flaxseed for 7 d during the follicular 
phase of their menstrual cycles. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected 
at baseline and on the final day of supplementation. As an adjunct to the 
25-g-flaxseed arm, subjects consumed the supplement for an additional day and 
blood and urine samples were collected at specific intervals. All blood and 
urine samples were analyzed for enterolactone and enterodiol by gas 
chromatography-mass spectroscopy.
RESULTS: A dose-dependent urinary lignan response to raw flaxseed was observed 
(r = 0.72, P < 0.001). The processing of flaxseed as a muffin or bread did not 
affect the quantity of lignan excretion. Plasma lignan concentrations were 
greater (P < or = 0.05) than baseline by 9 h after flaxseed ingestion 
(29.35+/-3.69 and 51.75+/-7.49 nmol/L, respectively). The total plasma area 
under the curve was higher on the eighth than on the first day (1840.15+/-343.02 
and 1027.15+/-95.71 nmol x h/L, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Mammalian lignan production from flaxseed precursors is dependent on 
time and dose but not on processing.

Recent studies have shown that soy isoflavone inhibits inducible nitric oxide 
(NO) synthase activities and is reported to have peroxynitrite scavenging 
ability. Consequently, we investigated whether isoflavones (daidzein and 
genistein) and extracts from soy-based products (miso, soymilk, tofu, soy 
sprout, black soybean, soybean, and yuba) would inhibit the reactive nitrogen 
species (RNS) effect in vitro and in vivo. In the in vitro experiments 
[including the protection of cellular DNA from peroxynitrite or sodium 
nitroprusside damage, an inhibitory effect on nitric oxide production from 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells, and nitric oxide scavenging 
ability], extracts from soy-based foods showed a potent antioxidant activity and 
an inhibiting effect on RNS activity. These effects were correlated with total 
isoflavone content. In the in vivo experiments, rats were given isoflavones (4.0 
mg/kg bw) or soy-based product extracts (1.0 g/kg bw) orally for 1 week and were 
injected with vehicle H(2)O (1 mL/kg bw) or LPS (10 mg/kg bw) on the day 7. 
Twelve hours after treatment, the rats were killed, and blood serum was 
collected for analysis. The intraperitoneal administration of LPS resulted in an 
increase in serum nitrite, nitrate, and nitrotyrosine concentrations. These are 
stable metabolite end products of nitric oxide, to 4-, 16-, and 5-fold levels, 
(4, 10 microM and 58 +/- 14 pmol/mL), of the placebo control, respectively. 
Results showed that oral administration of isoflavones and extracts from 
soy-based products significantly decreased serum nitrite, nitrate, and 
nitrotyrosine levels in LPS-induced rats. This study demonstrates that soy 
isoflavone supplementation may inhibit RNS-induced oxidation both in vitro and 
in vivo.

Two varieties of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. crispa and capitata) and one 
variety of escarole (Cichorium endivia var. latifolium) were chosen due to their 
different browning sensitivity during storage as minimally processed products. 
The changes in the compositions and contents of the primary polyphenolic 
compounds were investigated during the first few hours of storage and then after 
1, 2, 3, and 6 days of storage at 6°C and revealed sharp variations. Browning 
development, activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase, and concentration of 
ascorbic acid were also examined during storage. The content of chicoric acid, 
which was the most abundant phenolic compound, varied substantially during the 
first 24 hr of storage and between the different varieties. Oak leaf lettuce, 
which was the most sensitive variety to browning, was characterized by a higher 
maintained chicoric acid level with a constant decreased chlorogenic acid level 
during the storage period. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Browning development is 
responsible for the short shelf life of minimally processed vegetables, such as 
lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Polyphenolic compounds, as substrates of enzymatic 
reactions, are involved in the browning susceptibility of leaves. Comparisons of 
the profiles and contents of these compounds in different leaves showed dramatic 
variations during storage. This study provides additional information to better 
control, optimize minimally processed produce and select more suitable leaves 
for the fresh-cut industry.

Hesperidin is the predominant polyphenol consumed from citrus fruits and juices. 
However, hesperidin is proposed to have limited bioavailability due to the 
rutinoside moiety attached to the flavonoid. The aim of this study was to 
demonstrate in human subjects that the removal of the rhamnose group to yield 
the corresponding flavonoid glucoside (i.e., hesperetin-7-glucoside) will 
improve the bioavailability of the aglycone hesperetin. Healthy volunteers 
(n=16) completed the double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Subjects 
randomly consumed hesperetin equivalents supplied as orange juice with natural 
hesperidin (""low dose""), orange juice treated with hesperidinase enzyme to yield 
hesperetin-7-glucoside, and orange juice fortified to obtain 3 times more 
hesperidin than naturally present (""high dose""). The area under the curve (AUC) 
for total plasma hesperetin of subjects consuming hesperetin-7-glucoside juice 
was 2-fold higher than that of subjects consuming the ""low"" dose hesperidin 
juice [3.45+/-1.27 vs. 1.16+/-0.52 mmol/(L.h), respectively, P>0.0001]. The AUC 
for hesperetin after consuming the hesperetin-7-glucoside juice was improved to 
the level of the ""high"" dose hesperidin juice [4.16+/-1.50 mmol/(L.h)]. The peak 
plasma concentrations (C(max)) of hesperetin were 4-fold higher (2.60+/-1.07 
mmol/L, P<0.0001) after subjects consumed hesperetin-7-glucoside juice compared 
with those consuming ""low"" dose hesperidin juice (0.48 +/- 0.27 mmol/L), and 
1.5-fold higher than those consuming ""high"" dose hesperidin juice (1.05+/-0.25 
mmol/L). The corresponding T(max) was much faster (0.6+/-0.1 h, P<0.0001) after 
subjects consumed hesperetin-7-glucoside juice compared with ""low"" dose 
(7.0+/-3.0 h) and ""high"" dose (7.4+/-2.0 h) hesperidin juices. The results of 
this study demonstrated that the bioavailability of hesperidin was modulated by 
enzymatic conversion to hesperetin-7-glucoside, thus changing the absorption 
site from the colon to the small intestine. This may affect future interventions 
concerning the health benefits of citrus flavonoids.

SCOPE: Diets rich in polyphenols has been associated with better cognitive 
performance. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between 
microbial phenolic metabolites (MPM) in urine and cognition in the context of an 
older population at high cardiovascular risk.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A cross-sectional analysis is conducted in 400 individuals 
of the PREDIMED-Plus study. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry 
is used to identify urinary MPM. Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) adherence is 
estimated with a 17-item questionnaire and cognitive function is evaluated with 
a battery of neuropsychological tests. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression 
models are fitted to assess the relationship of urinary MPM with the MedDiet and 
cognitive tests. Protocatechuic acid and enterolactone glucuronide are 
associated with higher adherence to the MedDiet. Regarding cognitive function, 
protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid glucuronide, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid, 
enterodiol glucuronide, and enterolactone glucuronide are directly associated 
with a global composite score of all the cognitive tests. Furthermore, 
protocatechuic acid and enterolactone glucuronide are associated with higher 
scores in the Mini-Mental State Examination, whereas enterodiol glucuronide is 
associated with improved Clock Drawing Test scores.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the MedDiet is linked to MPM associated 
with better cognitive performance in an older population.

BACKGROUND: Consumption of broccoli is increasing steadily worldwide because of 
the interest in its bioactive composition and nutritive value for health 
promotion. Novel broccoli cultivars to be established under current adverse 
conditions in production areas (aggressive environmental conditions and saline 
irrigation waters) need to maintain physical and nutritional quality for 
consumption and year-round supply to the markets. The newly introduced cultivars 
'Naxos' and 'Parthenon' have been selected as potential candidates to replace 
the currently underperforming 'Nubia' variety. We aimed to compare the physical 
and phytochemical quality (glucosinolates, hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonoids, 
vitamin C and minerals), as well as the in vitro antioxidant capacity of these 
three cultivars under conditions of environmental stress.
RESULTS: 'Parthenon' showed equal productivity and nutritional composition to 
'Nubia', whereas 'Naxos' presented in general the best results when compared to 
'Nubia' and 'Parthenon'. For phenolic compounds 'Nubia' presented the highest 
contents, although 'Naxos' seemed better adapted to saline stress conditions, as 
suggested by the lowest degree of variation in the contents of healthy 
phytochemicals, including phenolic compounds, when grown under such conditions.
CONCLUSION: 'Naxos' broccoli performed best and is a suitable candidate to 
replace 'Nubia' for marketable, nutritive and phytochemical quality, especially 
in areas of production under adverse conditions as found in Mediterranean 
southeast Spain (semiarid climate with saline irrigation water).

The phenolic and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values have been 
measured in six fresh and frozen vegetables (beet green, spinach, broccoli, 
carrot, onion, and celery) from the same cultivar by analyzing the whole juice 
(WJ) and the acetonic extract of the squeezed pulp. To exploit the effect of the 
acid environment on the stability and recovery of the phenolics, perchloric acid 
(PCA) was added directly to WJ and to the pulp before the extraction with 
acetone. In both fresh and frozen vegetables, PCA markedly increased the 
recovery of phenolics extracted from the pulp, but PCA had no effect on the WJ. 
Four of six frozen vegetables showed lower phenolic and ORAC values than the 
fresh vegetables, whereas in the other two cases, values were significantly 
higher compared to fresh samples. Among the fresh vegetables, beet green showed 
the highest ORAC and phenolic values; however, when measured in two different 
cultivars of beet green, the ORAC value showed as much as 4.5-fold variation, 
whereas total phenolics and flavonoids showed 1.2- and 3.5-fold variations, 
respectively. The results show that total phenolics and ORAC, compared in fresh 
and frozen vegetables, represent an index of the mildness of blanching in the 
industry of frozen vegetables and provide a measure of the gap in antioxidants 
in the diet of people who consume frozen instead of fresh vegetables. The plant 
genotype is an important source of variability in the ORAC value, which can be 
conveniently used to increase the intake of antioxidants from vegetables.

Vegetables are the most important sources of phenolics in the Mediterranean 
diet. Phenolics, especially flavonoids, are suggested as being essential 
bioactive compounds providing health benefits. In this study, twenty-seven 
vegetables, fifteen aromatic herbs and some spices consumed in Central Italy 
(the Marches region) were studied to reveal total phenolic, flavonoid and 
flavanol content as well as their antioxidant capacity measured by the oxygen 
radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. A comparison in terms of antioxidant 
capacity was made between different salads, as well as between salads to which 
aromatic herbs had been added. Lemon balm and marjoram at a concentration of 1.5 
% w/w increased by 150 % and 200 % respectively the antioxidant capacity of a 
salad portion. A 200 g portion of a salad enriched with marjoram corresponded to 
an intake of 200 (SD 10) mg phenolics and 4000 (SD 300) ORAC units (micromol 
Trolox equivalents). Olive oils and wine or apple vinegars were the salad 
dressings that provided the highest increase in antioxidant capacity. Among the 
spices tested, cumin and fresh ginger made the most significant contribution to 
the antioxidant capacity. The results are useful in surveying the antioxidant 
parameters of vegetables, herbs and spices produced and consumed in our 
geographical area as well as in quantifying the daily intake of phenolics and 
ORAC units. The results can be used in public health campaigns to stimulate the 
consumption of vegetables able to provide significant health protection in order 
to prevent chronic diseases.

A mandarin-type citrus fruit, ponkan (Citrus reticulata), was processed by 
in-line, chopper pulper, and hand-press extractions to investigate the effect of 
extraction method on the concentrations of bioactive compounds in processed 
juice. Concentrations of polymethoxylated flavones (tangeretin, nobiletin, and 
sinensetin) and beta-cryptoxanthin in juice, and inhibitory activities against 
arachidonate cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenases of the juice extract were 
analyzed. The juice processed by hand-press extraction contained the largest 
amounts of nobiletin (3.56 mg/100 mL), tangeretin (4.10 mg/100 mL), and 
sinensetin (0.13 mg/100 mL). Concentrations of beta-cryptoxanthin were 0.66, 
0.59, 0.55, and 0.50 mg/100 mL in chopper pulper, in-line (5/64 in.), in-line 
(8/64 in.) and hand-press juices, respectively. Both extracts of in-line juices 
showed greater inhibitory activity toward platelet 12-lipoxygenase than the 
others. The inhibitory effect of hand-press juice extract on platelet 
cyclooxygenase activity was remarkable among juice extracts. All juice extracts 
effectively inhibited polymorphonuclear 5-lipoxygenase activity at nearly the 
same rate.

RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Anthocyanins, the most abundant pigments in red wine, play 
an important role in the visual aspect of wine sensory properties. However, due 
to their unstable nature, their ability to polymerise with tannins is important 
for colour stability. Their content varies with grapevine variety, growing 
conditions, viticultural and winemaking practices. Leaf removal, a common 
viticultural practice, enhances anthocyanin accumulation in red grapevines, and 
partial fruit zone leaf removal at different phenological stages can 
significantly influence the anthocyanin content of grapes and wine. This 
two-year study examined how two different times of fruit zone leaf removal at 
different phenological stages affect the initial anthocyanin content in wine and 
their stability during ageing in Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon wines 
grown in a Mediterranean climate.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Partial leaf removal was applied during flowering and 
during vérasion and compared with untreated control. The wines obtained from all 
treatments and varieties were bottled two months after the end of fermentation, 
and then stored and matured under the cellar conditions for one year. To 
determine the influence of different times of leaf removal on the concentration 
of anthocyanins and their stability in the wine, the wines were analysed 
immediately after bottling and again after 6 and 12 months of storage. For the 
determination of all phenolic compounds, high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) was used.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Leaf removal treatments increased the concentration of 
anthocyanins in all three cultivars. The obtained results showed that 
malvidin-3-O-glucoside (Mal-3-Glc) was the most abundant individual anthocyanin, 
while the most unstable anthocyanin was petunidin-3-O-coumaroyl glucoside 
(Pet-3-Coum-Glc). Initial concentration of total anthocyanins in all wine 
samples was significantly affected by different conditions in the two years of 
study, but with a significant effect of the defoliation treatments. Anthocyanin 
concentration decreased during the ageing of the wine, and the degradation of 
anthocyanins ranged from 36 to 90 %. The stability of anthocyanins in wine was 
most influenced by ageing time, while year and treatment had no influence. The 
concentration of total phenolic acids increased during wine ageing, while the 
concentration of total flavonol glycosides (TFG) decreased in all wine samples 
except Merlot from 2016.
NOVELTY AND SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION: The results of this study contribute to a 
better understanding of the stability of increased concentrations of 
anthocyanins in wines during ageing obtained by the practice of grapevine leaf 
removal in the vineyard.

High-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) and mass spectrometric (MS) 
procedures were developed to determine lignans in flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) 
and chaparral (Larrea tridentata). Flaxseed contains high levels of 
phytoestrogens. Chaparral has been associated with acute nonviral toxic 
hepatitis and contains lignans that are structurally similar to known estrogenic 
compounds. Both flaxseed and chaparral products have been marketed as dietary 
supplements. A mild enzyme hydrolysis procedure to prevent the formation of 
artifacts in the isolation step was used in the determination of 
secoisolariciresinol in flaxseed products. HPLC with ultraviolet spectral (UV) 
or MS detection was used as the determinative steps. HPLC procedures with UV 
detection and mass spectrometry were developed to characterize the phenolic 
components, including lignans and flavonoids, of chaparral and to direct 
fractionation studies for the bioassays.

Allelopathic interactions among microalgae play a crucial role in shaping 
phytoplankton community dynamics and have gained attention as potential 
strategies for harmful algal bloom (HAB) control. This study investigated the 
allelopathic effects of Prorocentrum minimum on Skeletonema costatum and 
Heterosigma akashiwo using culture filtrates under varying concentrations and 
heat treatments. Results showed that high-concentration filtrates of P. minimum 
induced cell rupture and lysis for the both species, while moderate 
concentrations (1/3 and 1/2) inhibited their growth but allowed partial cell 
viability. A biphasic effect was observed on H. akashiwo, where low 
concentrations promoted growth, but higher levels were inhibitory. Thermal 
stability tests revealed that the allelochemicals of P. minimum retained their 
inhibitory activity even after heating at 90 °C, especially against S. costatum. 
In contrast, H. akashiwo exhibited recovery in cell density and chlorophyll 
fluorescence (Ft) with increased temperature and duration, suggesting greater 
resilience. Photosynthetic efficiency, measured as Fv/Fm, declined significantly 
for both species under high-concentration filtrate exposure, particularly for H. 
akashiwo. Biochemical assays showed reduced total protein levels and elevated 
malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating oxidative stress brought by filtrates of P. 
minimum. Enzyme activities (SOD, CAT and ATPase) varied by species and 
treatment, again reflecting a pattern of low-concentration stimulation and 
high-concentration inhibition. The allelochemicals released by P. minimum 
demonstrated species-specific effects and substantial chemical complexity, 
disrupting photosynthesis, metabolic activity and redox balance in target 
species. These findings highlight the potential of allelopathy as a tool for 
managing HABs through selective suppression of harmful microalgae.

Cranberry, which is rich in polyphenols, including anthocyanins and 
proanthocyanidins, has been found to have various effects beneficial to human 
health, including prevention of urinary tract infections. These effects have 
been associated with polyphenols in the fruit. We investigated the excretion of 
anthocyanins in human urine after ingestion of cranberry juice. Eleven healthy 
volunteers consumed 200 ml of cranberry juice containing 650.8 microg total 
anthocyanins. Urine samples were collected within 24 h before and after 
consumption. Six of 12 anthocyanins identified in cranberry were quantified in 
human urine by HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization and tandem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS-MS). Among these, peonidin 3-O-galactoside, the second 
most plentiful anthocyanin in the juice, was found most abundantly in urine 
within 24 h, corresponding to 41.5 nmol (56.1% of total anthocyanins). The 
urinary levels of anthocyanins reached a maximum between 3 and 6 h after 
ingestion, and the recovery of total anthocyanins in the urine over 24 h was 
estimated to be 5.0% of the amount consumed. This study found high absorption 
and excretion of cranberry anthocyanins in human urine.

Changes occurring in the concentrations of alpha-tocopherol, total phenols, and 
complex phenols linked to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol (fractions FII and FIV) and 
p-hydroxyphenylethanol (FIII) during storage of virgin olive oil under 
environmental conditions were studied. Under diffused light, alpha-tocopherol 
was decomposed by 79% in 4 months, whereas <45% of the phenols were lost during 
the same period. Among the phenols, FII showed the least stability, and 
decreased by 72% in 6 months. Total phenols, FIII, and FIV recorded reductions 
in the range of 57-63% in 6 months. When the oil was stored in the dark, 
alpha-tocopherol, total phenols, FIII, and FIV exhibited similar profiles of 
degradation, reducing by 39-45% in the first 6 months and 50-62% in 12 months. 
FII was the least stable compound in the dark and recorded a loss of 64% in 6 
months and 79% in 12 months. The levels of the above antioxidants were further 
related to peroxide formation. Remaining levels of these compounds at PV = 20 
meq/kg ranged between 50 and 73% under diffused light and between 40 and 62% in 
the dark.

Four cultivars of strawberries (Senga Sengana, BFr77111, Elsanta, and Honeoye) 
were studied for their content of antioxidants, total antioxidant capacity, and 
low molecular weight carbohydrates in relation to harvest year, ripening stage, 
and cold storage. For ascorbic acid, chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, and total 
antioxidative capacity, measured in both water-soluble and water-insoluble 
extracts, there was a 2-5-fold variation among cultivars. Unripe berries 
contained lower concentrations of chlorogenic acid and p-coumaric acid and also 
quercetin and kaempferol compared with riper berries. During cold storage for up 
to 3 days, relatively few changes in the concentration of the different 
antioxidants occurred. The concentrations of several investigated parameters 
were interrelated, for example, for ascorbic acid and water-soluble antioxidant 
capacity and for ellagic acid and water-insoluble antioxidant capacity. The 
dominating sugars in strawberries were fructose and glucose, but considerable 
amounts of sucrose were also present, and their contents varied among cultivars, 
giving a predicted glycemic index of approximately 81. Verbascose, raffinose, 
and stachyose were found in only minor amounts. The study shows that the 
concentration of a number of bioactive compounds in strawberries varied 
according to cultivar, ripening stage, and storage. This information should make 
it possible to select strawberries with an optimal content of bioactive 
compounds.

Dietary phenols are antioxidants, and their consumption might contribute to the 
prevention of cardiovascular disease. Coffee and tea are major dietary sources 
of phenols. Dietary phenols are metabolized extensively in the body. Lack of 
quantitative data on their metabolites hinders a proper evaluation of the 
potential biological effects of dietary phenols in vivo. The aim of this study 
was to identify and quantify the phenolic acid metabolites of chlorogenic acid 
(major phenol in coffee), quercetin-3-rutinoside (major flavonol in tea) and 
black tea phenols in humans, and determine the site of metabolism. Healthy 
humans (n = 20) with an intact colon participated in a dietary controlled 
crossover study, and we identified and quantified approximately 60 potential 
phenolic acid metabolites in urine. Half of the ingested chlorogenic acid and 
43% of the tea phenols were metabolized to hippuric acid. Quercetin-3-rutinoside 
was metabolized mainly to phenylacetic acids, i.e., 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid 
(36%), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (8%) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic 
acid (5%). In contrast, in seven humans without a colon, we found only traces of 
phenolic acid metabolites in urine after they had ingested chlorogenic acid and 
quercetin-3-rutinoside. This implies that the colonic microflora convert most of 
these dietary phenols into metabolites that then reach the circulation. 
Metabolites of dietary phenols have lower antioxidant activity than their parent 
compounds; therefore, the contribution of dietary phenols to antioxidant 
activity in vivo might be lower than expected from in vitro tests.

Milk and dairy products have great importance in human nutrition related to the 
presence of different nutrients, including protein, fatty acid profile and 
bioactive compounds. Dietary supplementation with foods containing these types 
of compounds may influence the chemical composition of milk and dairy products 
and hence, potentially, the consumer. Our objective was to summarize the 
evidence of the effect of supplementation with antioxidants and phenolic 
compounds in the diets of dairy animals and their effects on milk and dairy 
products. We conducted a systematic search in the MEDLINE/PubMed database for 
studies published up until July 2022 that reported on supplementation with 
antioxidants and phenolic compounds in diets that included plants, herbs, seeds, 
grains and isolated bioactive compounds of dairy animals such as cows, sheep and 
goats and their effects on milk and dairy products. Of the 94 studies identified 
in the search, only 15 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The review 
revealed that supplementation with false flax cake, sweet grass, Acacia 
farnesiana, mushroom myceliated grains and sweet grass promoted an effect on the 
milk lipid profile, whereas supplementation with dried grape pomace and tannin 
extract promoted an effect on the milk and cheese lipid profiles. In six 
studies, the addition of Acacia farnesiana, hesperidin or naringin, durum wheat 
bran, mushroom myceliated grains, dried grape pomace and olive leaves increased 
the antioxidant activity of milk. In conclusion, supplementation with bioactive 
compounds had a positive impact which ranged from an increase in antioxidant 
capacity to a decrease in oxidative biomarkers such as malondialdehyde.

Naringin, a bitter flavanone glycoside in citrus with diverse bioactivities, 
consists of a glycosyl group linked to naringenin. Naringinase-catalyzed 
hydrolysis cleaves this glycosidic bond, converting bitter naringin into 
tasteless naringenin. Current naringinases suffer from limited diversity, poor 
thermostability, and narrow substrate specificity. While the thermostable 
glycosidase from Pyrococcus furiosus enables broad-spectrum debittering via 
transglycosylation, its low catalytic efficiency and complex purification hinder 
practical application. This study employed semi-rational design to engineer 
PfNG. Structural analysis yielded single mutants (F265A, M328S) and 
combinatorial mutant V1, exhibiting optimal activity at 95 °C with a 2.48-fold 
higher Kcat/Km than wild-type. We further developed a streamlined one-step 
thermal purification protocol, providing an efficient alternative to 
chromatography. Structural characterization revealed enhanced activity likely 
originates from: (1) contracted binding pocket volume, (2) widened substrate 
channel entrance, (3) novel hydrogen bonds, and (4) increased conformational 
flexibility. V1 effectively reduced naringin content (>91 %) in green citrus 
extracts and mitigated juice bitterness. Our work resolves key limitations of 
PfNG, advancing its industrial deployment for citrus debittering and 
biopharmaceutical applications.

Hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) from Melissa officinalis are key functional 
components in herb-based food products, however, their limited bioaccessibility 
and interactions with food matrix components restrict their effectiveness in 
realistic food systems. This study aimed to investigate whether pre-digestive 
biotransformation of Melissa officinalis phenolic acids combined with 
incorporation into non-starch polysaccharide (NSP)-rich food matrices, could 
enhance their stability, release, and functional properties under simulated 
gastrointestinal digestion. Lemon balm phenolic extracts were biotransformed 
using selected Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains and combined with 
dietary fiber, oat flakes, and flaxseed matrices. Samples were subjected to in 
vitro digestion, with phenolic profiling (UPLC-PDA-QTOF-ESI-MS), antioxidant 
capacity (ORAC, ABTS), and DPP-4 inhibition assays. Bacterial transformation 
generated low-molecular-weight metabolites (danshensu, caffeic acid), improving 
digestive stability and enhancing bioactivity. NSP-rich matrices modulated 
phenolic release, increasing bioaccessibility of selected compounds (salvianolic 
acid E +403.9 %) while limiting oligomeric acid recovery (BI% reduction up to 
88.9 %). Chemometric analysis confirmed selective matrix-compound interactions 
as key modulators of phenolic release and recovery. These findings highlight a 
novel technological approach to improve the bioactive potential of plant 
phenolics in realistic food systems, supporting the development of functional 
foods with targeted metabolic effects.

Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) is a nutrient-rich plant valued for its 
medicinal and dietary applications that accumulates high levels of cellular 
metabolites. The root system demonstrates potent antioxidant properties. In this 
study, a single-nucleus resolution transcriptomic atlas of the Tartary buckwheat 
root system was generated using fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting. The 
analysis identified 10 major cell types and 22 cell clusters involved in root 
development, along with newly defined marker genes. The developmental 
trajectories of specific root cell types, such as root hairs and cortex cells, 
were mapped, and the key regulatory networks underlying their development were 
constructed. The flavonoid biosynthetic pathway of Tartary buckwheat was 
analyzed at the single-cell level. Furthermore, the core regulatory factor 
FtHD2B in Tartary buckwheat roots promoted the response of roots to stress by 
positively regulating the synthesis of flavonoids. This study provides the 
single-nucleus resolution transcriptomic dataset for the root system of a 
Polygonaceae plant, offering clues for understanding root cell differentiation 
and root system development within this family.

Tobacco black shank, a destructive soil-borne disease caused by Phytophthora 
nicotianae, severely impacts tobacco production. Selenium (Se) is a beneficial 
trace element known to enhance plant stress resistance. While previous studies 
indicated Se's efficacy against black shank, its differential effects on tobacco 
varieties with contrasting innate resistance remain unexplored. Herein, we 
integrated physiological, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses to elucidate 
the mechanisms of Se-induced resistance in a resistant (K326) and a susceptible 
(Zhongyan 100) tobacco cultivar. Our results showed that foliar application of 8 
mg/L Se significantly reduced disease incidence and enhanced antioxidant enzyme 
activities, membrane stability, and accumulation of protective compounds in both 
cultivars. Multi-omics analyses revealed that Se potently enhanced resistance in 
K326 by synergistically upregulating the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, 
promoting the synthesis of lignin precursors and phenolic acids, and maintaining 
purine metabolism to ensure energy supply. In contrast, the susceptible cultivar 
Zhongyan 100 showed limited metabolic capacity to translate Se-induced 
transcriptional changes into effective defence metabolite accumulation. These 
findings provide novel insights into the genotype-dependent mechanisms of 
Se-induced resistance and highlight the potential of precision Se application as 
a strategy to bolster defence in resistant cultivars against soil-borne 
diseases.

Common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are a nutritionally valuable crop with high 
levels of bioactive compounds, including phenolics with antioxidant and 
antibacterial properties. However, the functional potential of local Chilean 
landraces remains underexplored. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) can 
influence plant metabolism, enhancing the accumulation of secondary metabolites. 
This study evaluates the effect of PGPB (Bacillus proteolyticus Cyn1, Bacillus 
safensis Cyn2, and their consortium) on the total phenolic content (TPC), 
antioxidant capacity, and antibacterial activity of extracts from the Chilean 
landrace 'Sapito'. For this, 'Sapito' bean seeds were inoculated with individual 
PGPB strains and their consortium and cultivated under field conditions. 
Extracts from the seed coat and cotyledons were obtained using water, ethanol, 
and acetone. TPC was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu method, antioxidant 
activity was assessed via DPPH, ABTS, H₂O₂ scavenging, ferrous ion chelation, 
and FRAP assays, while antibacterial activity was evaluated through agar 
diffusion, growth inhibition, and cell viability assays against Gram positive 
Bacillus cereus and Gram negative Pseudomonas putida. PGPB inoculation 
significantly influenced TPC, with consortium-treated seeds accumulating higher 
phenolic content in aqueous extracts (95.9 ± 27.8 mg GAE/100 g dry seed). 
Antioxidant activity varied across treatments and solvents, with ethanolic and 
acetone extracts displaying the highest radical scavenging activities. 
Antibacterial assays revealed that ethanolic seed coat extracts exhibited 
stronger inhibition against B. cereus. In conclusion, this is the first study 
evaluating the impact of PGPB on the functional properties of a Chilean common 
bean landrace. The findings highlight the potential of microbial inoculation to 
enhance phenolic accumulation and bioactivity, supporting sustainable 
agriculture, food security, and germplasm conservation in the face of climate 
change.

Epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested that diesel exhaust 
particles (DEPs), which generate reactive oxygen species, may be involved in the 
recent increase in the prevalence of lung diseases. Cacao liquor 
proanthocyanidins (CPs) are naturally occurring polyphenols with antioxidative 
activities. We carried out a study in mice to investigate the effects of dietary 
supplementation of CPs on lung injury induced by intratracheal administration of 
DEPs (500 microg/body). Dietary supplementation with 1.0 percent CPs inhibited 
DEP-induced lung injury, characterized by neutrophil sequestration and edema. 
Immunohistochemical analyses showed that CPs prevented enhanced expression of 
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 caused 
by DEPs in the lung injury. Numerous adducts of nitrotyrosine, N-(hexanonyl) 
lysine, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and 8-OHdG were also observed immunohistochemically 
in the lungs of mice treated with DEPs. However, these indicators of oxidative 
stress were barely visible in mice pretreated with CP supplementation. In 
addition, the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in the lung was 
decreased by CP supplementation in the presence of DEPs. These results suggest 
that CPs inhibit DEP-induced lung injury by reducing oxidative stress, in 
association with a reduction in the expression of adhesion molecules.

Furocoumarins represent a family of natural food constituents with phototoxic 
and photomutagenic properties. They are found mainly in plants belonging to the 
Rutaceae and Umbilliferae such as celery, carrots, and parsnips. Parsnips 
(Pastinaca sativa L.) have become more and more popular as a vegetable, e.g., as 
a constituent of or ingredient in baby food. Previous work has shown that 
microbial infection of parsnip roots can result in a dramatic increase in 
furocoumarin levels. In this study, freshly harvested parsnips were stored as 
whole roots, pieces (cubes), or homogenate at +4 degrees C or -18 degrees C over 
various time periods under standard conditions. It was found that furocoumarin 
concentrations (sum of five furocoumarins: angelicin, isopimpinellin, 
5-methoxypsoralen, 8-methoxypsoralen, and psoralen) in freshly harvested 
parsnips, analyzed by HPLC after extraction with diethyl ether and sequential 
solid phase (reversed-phase and silica) extraction, was generally lower than 2.5 
mg/kg, and storage of parsnips in any form investigated at -18 degrees C over up 
to 50 days did not lead to a marked increase in furocoumarin levels. In 
contrast, storage of whole parsnips, but not of cubes or homogenate, at +4 
degrees C resulted in a marked biphasic increase of furocoumarin concentrations 
after 7 and 38 days of storage up to levels of about 40 mg/kg. A dramatic 
increase in furocoumarin concentrations up to 566 mg/kg was observed when whole 
parsnips obtained from the market were kept at room temperature over 53 days, 
resulting in a visible microbial (mold) infection. Baby food products from the 
German market containing parsnips as an ingredient or constituent showed 
furocoumarin levels < or =0.41 mg/kg, suggesting that properly stored 
roots/preparations have been used. It is recommended that, after harvesting, 
parsnips be kept at -18 degrees C or under other conditions that prevent 
microbial infections.

The extraction yield, phenolic content, anthocyanin content and antioxidant 
activity of extracts from different varieties of red grapes, Cabernet Sauvignon, 
Merlot, Petit Verdot, Syrah, Tempranillo and Tintilla, using pressurized green 
solvents have been analyzed. Two techniques were studied and compared: 
supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) with CO2 + 20% ethanol and pressurized 
liquid extraction (PLE) with either ethanol, water or an ethanol/water mixture 
as the extraction solvents. The Petit Verdot variety allowed the highest global 
and phenolic yield, and antioxidant activity. The best conditios for PLE 
obtained from the experimental design and kinetic study were 50% ethanol/water 
as the pressurized solvent at 90 bar, 120 °C, a flow rate of 5 g/min and, an 
extraction time of 90 min. A statistical analysis of variance has been performed 
and it was found that temperature is the only variable that has a statistical 
influence on the extraction yield. The antioxidant activity levels of the 
extracts are very promising and they are similar to those obtained with the 
antioxidant tocopherol.

Because olives represent an important component of the Mediterranean diet, it is 
necessary to establish unequivocal identification and quantitation of the major 
potential antioxidant phenolic compounds they contain. The major phenolic 
antioxidants in two types of brined olives were isolated and purified by 
semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography. Structural analysis was 
conducted using UV spectrophotometry, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy. In particular, completely assigned 1H and 13C NMR data 
are presented and errors in literature data are corrected. The data show that 
tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, 3-(3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid (dihydrocaffeic 
acid), dihydro-p-coumaric acid (phloretic acid), the phenylpropanoid glucosides 
acteoside (verbascoside) and isoacteoside, along with the flavonoids luteolin 
and apigenin are major components of the phenolic fraction of brined black 
olives. Brined green olives contain only hydroxytyrosol and traces of other 
minor phenolics. Brined olives contain even higher concentrations of phenolic 
antioxidants than olive oil and may, therefore, be more important modulators of 
cancer chemopreventive activity.

California 93740-8003, United States.

The effect of grape and wine tannin structure on retention thermodynamics under 
reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography conditions on a 
polystyrene divinylbenzene column was investigated. On the basis of retention 
response to temperature, an alternative retention factor was developed to 
approximate the combined temperature response of the complex, unresolvable 
tannin mixture. This alternative retention factor was based upon relative tannin 
peak areas separated by an abrupt change in solvent gradient. Using this 
alternative retention factor, retention thermodynamics were calculated. Van't 
Hoff relationships of the natural log of the alternative retention factor 
against temperature followed Kirchoff's relationship. An inverse quadratic 
equation was fit to the data, and from this the thermodynamic parameters for 
tannin retention were calculated. All tannin fractions exhibited exothermic, 
spontaneous interaction, with enthalpy-entropy compensation observed. 
Normalizing for tannin size, distinct tannin compositional effects on 
thermodynamic parameters were observed. The results of this study indicate that 
HPLC can be valuable for measuring the thermodynamics of tannin interaction with 
a hydrophobic surface and provides a potentially valuable alternative to 
calorimetry. Furthermore, the information gathered may provide insight into 
understanding red wine astringency quality.

A dual-probe real time PCR (qPCR) DNA-based analysis was devised for the 
identification of mandarin in orange juice. A single nucleotide polymorphism at 
the trnL-trnF intergenic region of the chloroplast chromosome was confirmed in 
nine orange (Citrus sinensis) and thirteen commercial varieties of mandarin, 
including Citrus reticulata and Citrus unshiu species and a mandarin × tangelo 
hybrid. Two short minor-groove binding fluorescent probes targeting the 
polymorphic sequence were used in the dual-probe qPCR, which allowed the 
detection of both species in single-tube reactions. The similarity of PCR 
efficiencies allowed a simple estimation of the ratio mandarin/orange in the 
juice samples, which correlated to the measured difference of threshold cycle 
values for both probes. The limit of detection of the assay was 5% of mandarin 
in orange juice, both when the juice was freshly prepared (not from concentrate) 
or reconstituted from concentrate, which would allow the detection of 
fraudulently added mandarin juice. The possible use of the dual-probe system for 
quantitative measurements was also tested on fruit juice mixtures. qPCR data 
obtained from samples containing equal amounts of mandarin and orange juice 
revealed that the mandarin target copy number was approximately 2.6-fold higher 
than in orange juice. The use of a matrix-adapted control as calibrator to 
compensate the resulting C(T) bias allowed accurate quantitative measurements to 
be obtained.

A valid method using liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray 
ionization (ESI) ion trap mass spectrometry was established for the study of the 
absorbed and metabolic components of a Chinese medicine 'Shuangdan' granule in 
rat plasma after oral administration. The plasma samples were acidified with 1M 
hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) of two-fold volume 
for three times. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a Zorbax 
SB-C18 column with a linear gradient whereas 0.1% acetic acid/water/acetonitrile 
was used as mobile phase. Mass spectra were acquired in both negative and 
positive modes. More than 20 components including 16 components from 'Shuangdan' 
granule and 5 metabolites were simultaneously identified by comparing their mass 
spectra and retention behavior with reference compounds or literature data. The 
results proved that the established method could be used to identify the 
structure of active components responsible for the pharmacological effects of 
'Shuangdan' granule.

Spinach leaves harvested at three maturity stages from eight commercial 
cultivars (CC) and eight advanced breeding lines (ABL) were evaluated for oxygen 
radical absorbing capacity (ORAC), total phenolics, and flavonoid composition 
and content. ABL had higher levels of total phenolics, total flavonoids, and 
ORAC than CC. Midmaturity spinach leaves had higher levels of total phenolics, 
total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity than immature and mature leaves. The 
contents of individual flavonoids varied in response to maturation, with the 
predominant glucuronated flavones decreasing and patuletin and spinacetin 
derivatives increasing. Both total phenolics and total flavonoids correlated 
well with ORAC (r(xy)() = 0.78 and 0.81, respectively) demonstrating that 
flavonoids were major contributors to antioxidant capacity. Our results indicate 
that spinach genotypes should be harvested at the midmaturity stage for 
consumers to benefit from elevated levels of health promoting flavonoids present 
in the leaves. Additionally, plant breeders can select for increased phenolic 
content to increase antioxidant capacity of spinach genotypes.

The effects of genetic, pre-harvest (season of harvest, spear diameter, spear 
portion and spear tip color) and post-harvest factors (storage and domestic 
preparation practices, e.g., peeling and cooking) on total phenolic, flavonoid 
and ascorbic acid content of white asparagus spears and their correlation with 
antioxidant capacity (DPPH and FRAP) were studied. Results showed that genetic 
material was important for the total phenolic content but not season of harvest, 
spear diameter or storage. Violet spear tips and apical spear portions showed 
the largest amount of total phenolics. Peeling did not affect total phenolics in 
fresh asparagus, whereas it reduced their content in stored asparagus, while 
cooking resulted in an increase in both fresh and stored asparagus. However, the 
soluble extract of total phenolics and flavonoids were minor and the missing 
significance of phenolics and flavonoids in antioxidant capacity of white 
asparagus spears depends on these small amounts.

Soaking together with Heat and Relative Humidity (HRH) treatment has been 
applied successfully to enrich γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in mung beans. 
However, whether and how the above GABA enrichment processing influences the 
other bioactive molecules is elusive. In the present study, mung beans were 
soaked and then treated by HRH for 5 or 7 h. By using metabolomics techniques, 
the changes of 496 metabolites were determined. The relative content of 
flavonoids and phenolic acids increased during soaking but slightly decreased 
during HRH. Intriguingly, soaking and HRH had the opposite effects on the 
glycosylation of polyphenols. The relative content of glycosylated or 
un-glycosylated polyphenols increased during soaking or HRH, respectively. The 
relative content of α-ketoglutaric acid increased more than 20 times after 5 h 
HRH treatment. Bioactive molecules could be enriched during GABA enrichment 
processing. Depending on the desired bioactive compounds, soaking and different 
duration of HRH treatment could be selected.

An HPLC method, using detection after postcolumn derivatization with 
p-dimethylaminocynnamaldehyde (DMACA), was developed for the quantitative 
analysis of individual flavanols in food. This method was applied to flavanol 
determination in 56 different kinds of Spanish food products, including fruit, 
vegetables, legumes, beverages (cider, coffee, beer, tea, and wine), and 
chocolate. The determined compounds corresponded to the catechins and 
proanthocyanidin dimers and trimers usually present in food and, therefore, they 
were representative of the flavanols of low degree of polymerization consumed 
with the diet. The data generated could be used for calculation of the dietary 
intake of either individual or total flavanols, which would allow the further 
establishment of epidemiological correlations with the incidence of chronic 
diseases. Similar flavanol profiles were found in the different samples of a 
similar type of product, even though important variations could exist in the 
concentrations of total and individual flavanols among them. This was attributed 
to factors such as sample origin, stage of ripeness, post-harvesting 
conservation, and processing. Total flavanol contents varied from nondetectable 
in most of the vegetables to 184 mg/100 g found in a sample of broad bean. 
Substantial amounts were also found in some fruits, such as plum and apple, as 
well as in tea and red wine. Epicatechin was the most abundant flavanol, 
followed by catechin and procyanidin B2. In general, catechins were found in all 
the flavanol-containing products, but the presence of gallocatechins was only 
relevant in pomegranate, broad bean, lentil, grape, wine, beer, and tea, and 
most of the berries. Galloyled flavanols were only detected in strawberry, 
medlar, grape, and tea.

The aim of this study was to quantify the contents of individual quercetin 
glycosides in red, yellow and chartreuse onion by High Performance Liquid 
Chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Acid hydrolysis of individual quercetin 
glycosides using 6 M hydrochloric acid guided to identify and separate quercetin 
7,4'-diglucoside, quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin 4'-glucoside, and quercetin. 
The contents of total quercetin glycosides varied extensively among three 
varieties (ranged from 16.10 to 103.93 mg/g DW). Quercetin was the predominant 
compound that accounted mean 32.21 mg/g DW in red onion (43.6% of the total) and 
127.92 mg/g DW in chartreuse onion (78.3% of the total) followed by quercetin 
3-glucoside (28.83 and 24.16 mg/g DW) respectively. Quercetin 3-glucoside levels 
were much higher in yellow onion (43.85 mg/g DW) followed by quercetin 
30.08 mg/g DW. Quercetin 4'-glucoside documented the lowest amount that 
documented mean 2.4% of the total glycosides. The varied contents of glycosides 
present in the different onion varieties were significant.

The current study was aimed to use gamma irradiation (10-25 kGy) as 
pre-treatment technique for improved extraction of phenolics and oil from onion 
dry skin powder (OSP) which was evaluated by TLC, FT/IR and GC/MS methods. Gamma 
irradiation (10 kGy) enhanced the extractability of oil and phenolics by 80 % 
and 50 %, respectively. The ethyl acetate extract (EAE) of irradiated (10 kGy) 
OSP showed significant anti-cancer activity by inhibiting proliferation, 
migration and inducing apoptosis in mice breast cancer cell line (4T1) at lower 
concentration of 0.01 % in comparison with pure quercetin. In addition, 
compositional changes in oil showed oleic, linoleic and palmitic acids as major 
among eight identified fatty acids. The surface morphology of isolated MCC was 
also characterized using SEM. These findings demonstrated the valorization of 
OSP in a zero waste approach using gamma irradiation (10 kGy) which 
concomitantly improved yield and bioactivities of phenolic constituents for 
various health applications.

Black carrot pomace (BCP) is a by-product of colorant production, containing 
various valuable components with the health promoting effects. In this study, 
for the first time, BCP was incorporated into a starch-based extruded snack 
formulation using wheat semolina and corn starch. Total phenolic content, total 
antioxidant capacity, phenolics, and anthocyanins after processing and in vitro 
gastrointestinal digestion were investigated, and physical and textural 
properties of the snack products were determined. Incorporating BCP 
significantly raised the TPC and antioxidant levels, notably achieving peak 
levels in snacks enriched with 20 % BCP. The phenolic acids and anthocyanins 
were increased significantly (48-382 %) (p < 0.05) with simulated gastric 
digestion whereas no anthocyanins were detected after simulated intestinal 
digestion. On the other hand, the extrusion process resulted in a negative 
impact on anthocyanin concentrations, particularly marked by a significant 
reduction in some cyanidin derivatives indicating the detrimental effect of 
extrusion on the molecular integrity of anthocyanins under high temperature and 
pressure, leading to their degradation. In the final product, the snacks 
displayed lower expansion indices, water absorption index, water solubility 
index, and lightness; but had higher hardness and redness values compared to the 
control and turned slightly darker. The study proposes to evaluate BCP as a 
value-added ingredient that imparts functional properties to foods along with 
the utilization of starch in the extrusion process. Additionally, the 
integration of wheat semolina and corn starch contributed to the structural 
integrity and texture of the extruded snacks, highlighting the importance of 
polysaccharides in the formulation.

Grape pomace is commonly considered a waste product of monovarietal red wine 
production. Methods: HPLC-DAD analysis was performed to determine the polyphenol 
and flavonoid contents of all the extracts obtained from Montepulciano d'Abruzzo 
red wine and grape skins whereas, GC-MS was applied to the determination of 
fatty acid composition in grape seeds oil. Biological characterization involves 
antioxidant and antimicrobial assays for all the extracts and seeds oil; Their 
ability to inhibit α-glucosidase, α-amylase, α-tyrosinase, and ChE enzymes was 
also detected, together with anti-inflammatory activity on wine, grape skin 
extracts, and seeds oil by lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and LPS-stimulated macrophage 
release assays. Data indicate significative polyphenols content (199.31 ± 7.21 
mgGAE/g), antioxidant (CUPRAC assay (1036.98 mgTE/g)), enzymatic inhibition 
(α-tyrosinase: 151.30 ± 1.20 mgKAE/g) and anti-inflammatory activities for 
wine-organic extract 2, while the antimicrobial activity of grape skin decoction 
is higher than those reported by wine extracts on three bacterial strains. 
Interestingly only dealcoholized wine and wine-aqueous extract exerts inhibitory 
effects on α-glucosidase (20.62 ± 0.23 mmolACAE/g and 19.81 ± 0.03 mmolACAE/g, 
respectively), while seeds oil is rich in oleic and linoleic acids. These 
results confirm the strong antioxidant properties of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo

The health-relevant functionality of 10 thermally processed Peruvian Andean 
grains (five cereals, three pseudocereals, and two legumes) was evaluated for 
potential type 2 diabetes-relevant antihyperglycemia and antihypertension 
activity using in vitro enzyme assays. Inhibition of enzymes relevant for 
managing early stages of type 2 diabetes such as hyperglycemia-relevant 
alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase and hypertension-relevant angiotensin 
I-converting enzyme (ACE) were assayed along with the total phenolic content, 
phenolic profiles, and antioxidant activity based on the 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical assay. Purple corn (Zea mays L.) (cereal) 
exhibited high free radical scavenging-linked antioxidant activity (77%) and had 
the highest total phenolic content (8 +/- 1 mg of gallic acid equivalents/g of 
sample weight) and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity (51% at 5 mg of sample 
weight). The major phenolic compound in this cereal was protocatechuic acid (287 
+/- 15 microg/g of sample weight). Pseudocereals such as Quinoa (Chenopodium 
quinoa Willd) and Kañiwa (Chenopodium pallidicaule Aellen) were rich in 
quercetin derivatives (1,131 +/- 56 and 943 +/- 35 microg [expressed as 
quercetin aglycone]/g of sample weight, respectively) and had the highest 
antioxidant activity (86% and 75%, respectively). Andean legumes (Lupinus 
mutabilis cultivars SLP-1 and H-6) inhibited significantly the 
hypertension-relevant ACE (52% at 5 mg of sample weight). No alpha-amylase 
inhibitory activity was found in any of the evaluated Andean grains. This in 
vitro study indicates the potential of combination of Andean whole grain 
cereals, pseudocereals, and legumes to develop effective dietary strategies for 
managing type 2 diabetes and associated hypertension and provides the rationale 
for animal and clinical studies.

Membrane assisted passive sampler for triazine compounds in water 
bodies--characterization of environmental conditions and field performance.

Africa.

In this work, a simple, inexpensive and very selective membrane assisted passive 
sampler (MAPS) that does not use organic solvents, based on a thin walled 
silicone hollow fibre membrane for extraction of ionizable organic compounds in 
water bodies is reported. The potential for passive sampling of basic compounds 
is demonstrated. By changing the acceptor solution from acidic to basic 
conditions, the MAPS can be successfully used to extract acidic organic 
compound. The influence of environmental factors such as temperature, sample 
matrix and hydrodynamics on enrichment factors and sampling rates have been 
investigated in order to calibrate the passive sampler for measurement of TWA 
concentration of triazines. The selectivity, extraction efficiency and 
enrichment factor of the developed sampler has been compared to the Chemcatcher 
passive sampler. It was found that the chemical uptake of basic triazine 
compounds into the passive sampler remained linear and integrative throughout 
the 7 days exposure periods. For atrazine, propazine, prometryne and terbutryne 
a large 3 days time lag was experienced. A plot of natural logarithms of the 
amount taken up by the sampler against exposure time gave linear relationship 
for these compounds. The sampling rates for individual triazine compounds 
increased with change of hydrodynamic conditions from static to turbulent. The 
presence of 20 mg L(-1) humic substances in solution was found to have no 
significant effect on the concentration of compounds trapped in the acceptor 
solution. Once these compounds are trapped in the acceptor solution they do not 
diffuse back during the deployment period. A strong dependence of the sampling 
rates on the type of protective cover used was noted. Stainless steel protective 
cover was found to be the better than the iron mesh as it did not rust during 
deployment. The detection limits on HPLC with UV detection ranged from 0.50 to 
4.50 μg L(-1) for MAPS, 0.40 to 3.50 μg L(-1) for Chemcatcher passive sampler 
and 0.35 to 4.50 μg L(-1) for SPE with 7 days exposure of passive samplers. 
Preliminary field trial of the potential of the MAPS to monitor ionizable 
triazine compounds in Hartebeespoort dam found west of Johannesburg, South 
Africa was compared to Chemcatcher and SPE technique with C(18) sorbents for 
grab samples. No quantifiable amounts of triazine compounds were found in any of 
the deployed passive samplers in the preliminary field applications. Triazine 
compounds were also not detected in grab samples after SPE. However, data from 
laboratory studies support the feasibility of MAPS to measure the freely 
dissolved fraction of ionizable organic chemicals in water. The MAPS also 
exhibited slightly better selectivity towards matrix components found in natural 
water compared to SPE technique or Chemcatcher with C(18) disk as trapping 
media.

Eight commercial Italian vini novelli (red wines prepared by carbonic maceration 
and supposed to be consumed within three months from their wine-making) were 
evaluated for their total antioxidant activity. The wines had an average total 
phenol content (1605.4 +/- 337.4 mg/L gallic acid equivalents) lower than that 
of wines prepared by traditional maceration and consumable after aging (2057. 3 
+/- 524.0 mg/L gallic acid equivalents). The average flavanol content (424.7 +/- 
121.3 mg/L catechin equivalents) and the total antioxidant activity (16.8 +/- 
3.8 mmol/L Trolox equivalents) of vini novelli were higher than the 
corresponding values (382.7 +/- 174.5 mg/L catechin equivalents and 12.3 +/- 3.3 
mmol/L Trolox equivalents) found for aged wines. Three couples of experimental 
wines were prepared from the same grapes by traditional or carbonic maceration. 
These wines showed a different phenolic pattern, anthocyanins being more 
abundant in vini novelli. However, the average total antioxidant activities of 
the wines were similar, suggesting that aging (and not the wine-making 
technique) is the main factor influencing the antioxidant activity of red wines.

The optimization and validation of a protocol for the quantification of six 
dietary lignans, i.e., secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, lariciresinol, 
pinoresinol, medioresinol, and syringaresinol, in food are presented. The method 
incorporates isotope dilution to ensure correct accuracy and precision, 
introducing the utilization of individual stable 13C3-labeled lignans. To 
demonstrate the potential of this new method, preliminary results of the levels 
of dietary lignans in selected foods are presented. It is concluded that the 
method fulfils the reliability criteria and can be applied to the analysis of 
the most common lignans in human food, being an essential asset to establish the 
intake of lignans in a determined population and their relation with disease 
prevention.

Lignans constitute a group of phytochemicals widely distributed in the human 
diet. Once ingested, most dietary lignans are metabolized by the gut microflora 
to enterolactone and enterodiol, also known as enterolignans. Together with 
isoflavones and coumestrol, enterolignans have been traditionally classified as 
phytoestrogens, plant-derived compounds that exhibit estrogen-like activity. In 
addition to a higher intake of vegetables, many studies have suggested that the 
presence of phytoestrogens in the Japanese diet is one of the factors that might 
explain the reduced incidence of certain chronic diseases in Japanese 
populations compared with Western countries. Being a vegetable-based diet, 
exposure to dietary lignans should be high, but to assess this exposure, a 
lignan food database is required. Stable isotope-dilution gas chromatography 
coupled with mass spectrometry was used to quantify six plant lignans in 86 food 
items commonly consumed in Japan. These data will complement the previous 
databases and most importantly expand the knowledge of occurrence of lignans in 
food to Eastern diets.

The influence of 2 weeks and 3 months of dark storage upon light-induced 
chlorogenic acid accumulation within tuber tissue of four potato cultivars and 
upon 5-, 4-, and 3-caffeoylquinic acid concentrations within cv. King Edward was 
determined. Storage period significantly affected (P < 0.05) the magnitude of 
the light-induced chlorogenic acid response with accumulation rates 3-4 times 
higher in tubers exposed to light after 2 weeks compared with those placed under 
light after 3 months. Comparison of chlorogenic acid concentrations in controls 
after 2 and 3 months of dark storage indicated that tuber chlorogenic 
concentrations decline during prolonged cold store at 5 degrees C. Rates of 
accumulation in response to light were cultivar-dependent with cv. Fianna the 
most light-sensitive and cv. Maris Piper relatively light-insensitive. In 
virtually all cases exposure to sodium and fluorescent light promoted higher 
rates of accumulation than did exposure to high-pressure mercury light sources. 
Chlorogenic acid values steadily increased over 15 days of illumination with, in 
the majority of cases, no indication of cessation. Light exposure increased 5-, 
4-, and 3-caffeoylquinic acid accumulation rates in cv. King Edward. 
Irrespective of storage period and light source, ratios of 
5-:4-:3-caffeoylquinic acid were ca. 85:15:0 at day 0 and 52:42:6 by day 15.

In the present work, the phenolic composition, and antioxidant and antimicrobial 
properties of twenty-four samples of naturally fermented table olives from the 
northeast of Portugal were evaluated. The analysis of phenolic composition was 
performed by HPLC/DAD, and ten compounds were identified, hydroxytyrosol, 
verbascoside derivate and hydroxytyrosol glycol being the most abundant. Total 
phenolic content varied between 2.37 and 64.17 μg mg(-1) of extract. The IC50 
values from the antioxidant activity methods tested varied between 0.30 and 1.66 
mg mL(-1) for reducing power, and between 0.13 and 0.83 mg mL(-1) for DPPH. The 
results obtained in the antioxidant activity were extremely significantly 
correlated with the main phenolic compounds as well as with the total phenolic 
content. A principal component analysis allowed grouping the samples according 
to their phenolic composition and antioxidant potential. Table olive extracts 
were able to inhibit some pathogenic microorganisms, mainly Gram-positive 
bacteria. Higher antimicrobial inhibition was recorded in the extracts rich in 
phenolic compounds and higher antioxidant potential.

Honey is not only a food source but also a valuable substance for health and 
medicine, owing to its complex composition and bioactive properties. However, 
there is very limited information on the changes in the active compounds of 
honey during digestion and their antioxidant capacity and effect on cancer cells 
at the end of digestion. Herein, we investigate the dynamic changes in their 
bioactive compound composition and antioxidant activity during in vitro 
gastrointestinal digestion and the effect of digested honey on several cancer 
cell lines, after determining the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects of 
mono- and multifloral kinds of honey. The tested raw honey samples exhibited 
higher anti-inflammatory properties (36 %-80 %) with increasing total phenolic 
content (78-132 mg GAE/100 g), along with significant antimicrobial activity 
against E. coli (6-9 mm) and S. aureus (6-14 mm) bacterial species. The findings 
showed that total phenolic and flavonoid contents increased significantly during 
digestion, with a peaking value of 258 mg GAE/100 g in the intestinal phase, 
while TEAC and CUPRAC analysis exhibited variable trends depending on the 
digestion stage. Moreover, the concentration of compounds such as gallic, 
syringic, caffeic, p-coumaric, trans-cinnamic acid, and 
methyl-3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate identified by HPLC-DAD showed some fluctuations 
at different stages of digestion. Cytotoxicity analysis revealed that digested 
honey samples, particularly those with higher phenolic content, exhibited 
pronounced antiproliferative effects on cancer cells at higher concentrations, 
with minimal effects on healthy cells. These findings underscore the importance 
of honey's bioactive compounds, their transformation during digestion, and their 
potential health benefits.

Several recent articles have reported a significant antioxidant capacity of 
cereal products, determined in methanolic and ethanolic extracts. The aim of 
this work was to conduct an assessment of the antioxidant capacity of cereals 
using both chemical and in vitro digestive enzymatic extraction of antioxidants. 
Ferric reducing power (FRAP) and free radical scavenging capacity (DPPH) methods 
were used to determine the antioxidant capacity in wheat flour, bread, raw and 
boiled rice, wheat bran, and oat bran. The most efficient antioxidant extraction 
was achieved by using successively acidic methanol/water (50:50 v/v, pH 2) and 
acetone/water (70:30 v/v). The antioxidant capacity in these extracts ranged 
from 1.1 to 4.4 micromol Trolox/g dw. A significant amount of hydrolyzable 
phenolics with a high antioxidant capacity (from 5 to 108 micromol Trolox/g dw) 
was found in the residues of this aqueous-organic extraction. The antioxidant 
capacities of these nonextractable polyphenols are usually ignored in the 
literature, although they may have an antioxidant role in the gastrointestinal 
tract, especially after colonic fermentation, and may be fermentated to active 
metabolites. On the other hand, in vitro digestive enzymatic extracts obtained 
by enzymatic treatments that mimic conditions in the gastrointestinal tract 
showed that the amount of antioxidants released by the cereal matrix into the 
human intestine may be higher than the one that can be expected from 
measurements in the usual aqueous-organic extracts.

Papaya is one of the most nutritional fruits, rich in vitamins, carotenoids, 
flavonoids and other antioxidants. Previous studies showed phytonutrient 
improvement without affecting quality in tomato fruit and rapeseed through the 
suppression of DE-ETIOLATED-1 (DET1), a negative regulator in 
photomorphogenesis. This study is conducted to study the effects of DET1 gene 
suppression in papaya embryogenic callus. Immature zygotic embryos were 
transformed with constitutive expression of a hairpin DET1 construct (hpDET1). 
PCR screening of transformed calli and reverse transcription quantitative PCR 
(RT-qPCR) verified that DET1 gene downregulation in two of the positive 
transformants. High-throughput cDNA 3' ends sequencing on DET1-suppressed and 
control calli for transcriptomic analysis of global gene expression identified a 
total of 452 significant (FDR < 0.05) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) upon 
DET1 suppression. The 123 upregulated DEGs were mainly involved in 
phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and stress responses, compared to 329 downregulated 
DEGs involved in developmental processes, lipid metabolism, and response to 
various stimuli. This is the first study to demonstrate transcriptome-wide

biosynthetic pathways in papaya. This further supports that the manipulation of 
regulatory gene involved in light-regulated pathway is possible for 
phytonutrient improvement of tropical fruit crops.

In this study, three pearling fractions, namely bran, dehulled grains and 
pearled grains, derived from fourteen hulled and one hull-less Greek barley 
cultivars (Hordeum vulgare L.), were analyzed for the protein, ash, β-glucan, 
phenolic compounds and tocols contents. High variations appeared in the 
bioactive contents across the barley cultivars and fractions as well. The 
protein and ash contents decreased from the outer to the inner layers, whereas 
β-glucans presented an inverse trend. The highest protein and β-glucan contents 
were in the hull-less cultivar; however, one hulled cultivar (Sirios) exhibited 
similar β-glucan content, while another (Constantinos) had even higher protein 
content. The results also revealed that functional compounds were mainly located 
in bran fraction. Similar trends were also noted for the antioxidant activity. 
Ferulic acid was the primary phenolic acid in all fractions, followed by sinapic 
and p-coumaric acids that were dominant in bound form. However, oligomeric 
flavonoids, such as prodelphinidin B3, catechin, and procyanidin B2, were more 
abundant in free form. Overall, this study highlights that different barley 
cultivars can provide pearling flour fractions of varying composition (nutrients 
and bioactives), which have the potential to serve as nutritionally valuable 
ingredients in formulations of cereal-based functional food products.

The phenolic profiles of apple cultivars from the SERIDA Asturian cider apple 
breeding program, including parents and progenies, were determined by 
ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector-electrospray 
ionization-quadrupole time of flight/mass spectrometer in order to study the 
relationship between phenols and the resistance of apple tree cultivars to rosy 
apple aphid (RAA). A pattern recognition technique named partial least square 
discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to classify apple cultivars based on 
resistance to RAA, resistant and susceptible, reaching scores with accuracy 
higher than 97% and 91% respectively. Hydroxycinnamic acids, particularly 
4-caffeoylquinic acid (4-CQA) and 4-p-coumaroylquinic acid (4-pCoQA), were 
identified as the major player in RAA resistance by the PLS-DA model. Indeed, 
the isomerisation 5-CQA → 4-CQA is favoured in resistant cultivars, whereas the 
isomerisation 5-pCoQA → 4-pCoQA is favoured in susceptible cultivars. As a 
result, resistant cultivars accumulate higher amounts of 4-CQA than susceptible 
ones, and the opposite occurs for 4-pCoQA. Also, minor isomerisations of 5-CQA 
to 1-CQA or 3-CQA show opposite behaviour for resistant and susceptible 
cultivars. Cultivar resistance to RAA is concluded to be related with the 
phenylpropanoid pathway, the isomerisation reactions being the key metabolic 
reaction for a cultivar to be resistant or susceptible to RAA.

Prunes, which are industrially obtained by dehydrating fresh plums at 85-90 
degrees C for 18 h, contain higher levels of phenolic compounds than most other 
fruits. Prune phenolics have shown beneficial effects on human health. Reports 
are available in the literature on ascorbic acid, phenol composition, and 
antioxidant activity of fresh plums and prunes, but there is a lack of 
publications on the influence of drying parameters on the phenolic compounds and 
antioxidant activity. A study was carried out on two plum cultivars using two 
sets of air-drying temperatures: (i) air temperature at 85 degrees C until 50% 
of prune moisture level and then the temperature was lowered to 70 degrees C; 
(ii) air temperature at 60 degrees C. Whole fresh and dried fruits were assessed 
for phenolics (catechins, hydroxycinnamic acids, anthocyanins, and flavonols), 
ascorbic acid, and antioxidant activity (all parameters were calculated on a dry 
matter basis). Analysis of data shows that chlorogenic and neochlorogenic acid 
changes were affected by both process parameters and cultivar. Drying destroyed 
anthocyanins, and there was a significant decrease in flavonols. Ascorbic acid 
was drastically reduced in relation to process temperature. The most striking 
result was that drying at 85 degrees C doubled antioxidant activity in both 
cultivars, while contradictory results were found for 60 degrees C processed 
plums.

Aronia juice possesses multiple health benefits; however, unfavorable taste and 
storage instability limit its large-scale production and consumption. In this 
study, aronia juice was formulated with 2% (w/w) gum Arabic or 0.5% (w/w) egg 
white powder, treated with high-pressure processing (HPP) at 600 MPa for 5 min, 
and stored at 4°C for 12 months. A hedonic test (N = 60) was conducted, and the 
level of microorganisms, physicochemical properties, phenolic content, and 
antioxidant capacity during storage were evaluated. The results showed both 
formulations effectively reduced astringency, enhanced consumer liking, and 
improved physical and color stability of aronia juice. During storage, aerobic 
plate count, yeast counts, and mold counts remained below 1 log CFU/mL after HPP 
treatment. Only slight fluctuations were observed in pH, titratable acidity, 
°Brix, and °Brix: acid. Nonanthocyanin phenolic compounds and antioxidant 
capacity remained relatively stable. Overall, aronia juice formulated with gum 
Arabic or egg white powder and treated with HPP exhibited higher consumer 
acceptability, good storage stability, and an extended microbial shelf life at 
4°C. These findings are valuable in meeting consumer demand for healthy fruit 
juices with an appealing taste while supporting the development of the aronia 
berry industry. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study presents an innovative 
approach to improve the taste, quality, and shelf life of aronia berry juice by 
integrating food ingredient technology with high-pressure processing technology. 
The technology also could be used for the commercial production of other 
high-polyphenol juices like aronia berry.

A dispersive solid phase extraction-high performance liquid chromatographic 
(HPLC) method was established for the simultaneous determination of 2,4-D, 
thiabendazole, 2-naphthol, o-phenyl phenol, diphenyl ether and biphenyl in the 
fruits and vegetables. The samples were vortexed for extraction with 
acetonitrile containing sodium chloride and anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The 
acetonitrile extraction was purified by acidic alumina dispersed solid phase 
extraction. The analysis was performed on an Agilent TC C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 
mm, 5 microm) and an ultraviolet detector at 235 nm with a mobile phase of 
methanol-0.02 mol/L (pH 6) potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution, at a flow 
rate of 1.0 mL/min with gradient elution. Good linearities were observed in the 
range of 0.5-20 mg/L with correlation coefficients greater than 0.99. The 
average recoveries of the six preservatives in fruits and vegetables were in the 
range of 84.2% -99. 1% at three spiked levels of 1, 2 and 10 mg/kg (n = 6) and 
the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were in the range of 1.67%-10.3%. The 
limits of quantification were 1 mg/kg. This method is simple, accurate and 
suitable for the determination of the six preservatives in fruits and 
vegetables.

The physicochemical properties of apple juice from 13 apple varieties were 
correlated with the structural features of isolated apple pectin populations. 
Mathematical models explaining these structural properties, revealed variations 
in pectins as present in alcohol insoluble solids (AIS), water-soluble solids 
(WSS), and chelating soluble solids (ChSS). Significant differences in turbidity 
(89.00-4129 NTU), particle size (59.75-218.01 μm in D[4, 3]), and titratable 
acid (0.13 to 0.90 %) were observed, while pH, total soluble solids, and 
ζ-potential showed less variation. Juice yield (54.85-63.35 %) was inversely 
correlated with AIS, WSS, and ChSS content. Juice ζ-potential was positively 
correlated with the degree of methyl-esterification, methyl-ester distribution 
patterns, and the side chain sugar ratios of WSS pectin fractions. Juice quality 
as represented by juice clarity, texture and stability was significantly 
influenced by the diverse structure's features like sugar composition, 
methyl-esterification level and distribution of endogenous pectin. A partial 
least squares (PLS) regression model effectively predicted juice properties 
based on pectin characteristics. These findings underscore the importance of 
pectin structure in determining apple juice quality and provide a valuable 
framework for the juice industry to enhance quality control and inform cultivar 
selection.

Red cabbage contains glucosinolates, precursors to health-promoting 
isothiocyanates. However, raw cabbage often releases mainly epithionitriles and 
nitriles from glucosinolates. To increase isothiocyanate formation, the effect 
of acid usage in the preparation of red cabbage was evaluated. Moreover, the 
effects of the chosen boiling method (acidic boiled red cabbage versus neutral 
boiled blue cabbage) on glucosinolate degradation were investigated using 
UHPLC-DAD-ToF-MS and GC-MS. The addition of vinegar significantly increased 
isothiocyanate formation of cabbage salad from 0.09 to 0.21 µmol/g fresh weight, 
while lemon juice only slightly increased isothiocyanate formation. Acidic 
boiled red cabbage degraded glucosinolates and increased nitrile formation, 
while in neutral boiled blue cabbage, glucosinolates were stable. However, 
shortly boiled blue cabbage (5 min) had the highest isothiocyanate levels 
(0.08 µmol/g fresh weight). Thus, for a diet rich in isothiocyanates it is 
recommended to acidify raw cabbage salads and prepare shortly boiled blue 
cabbage instead of red cabbage.

OBJECTIVE: To detect phenolic acid compounds in various fruits and explore the 
differences in phenolic acids among different types of fruits.
METHODS: The collected 75 types of fruits were classified into 6 categories: 
citrus、melon、drupe、berry、tropical fruit and pome fruits. The phenolic acid 
compounds were detected by high performance liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry. The Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to examine the differences in 
phenolic acids among different types of fruits. The Mann-Whitney U test was used 
to examine the differences in phenolic acid content in fruits from the south and 
north. The Spearman method was used for correlation analysis of compounds in 
fruits.
RESULTS: The sum of phenolic acid content in 75 types of fruit ranges from 0.22 
to 485.97 mg/kg FW. The median of phenolic acid content, from highest to lowest, 
is in the order of pome fruits(76.17 mg/kg FW)&gt;citrus(37.86 mg/kg 
FW)&gt;berry(28.08 mg/kg FW)&gt;tropical fruits(22.56 mg/kg FW)&gt;drupe(20.70 
mg/kg FW)&gt;melon(1.62 mg/kg FW). Among various types of fruits, there was no 
statistical significance in the content of gentisic acid and p-coumaric acid, 
but certain differences in other components among different types of 
fruits(P&lt;0.05). There were few differences in phenolic acids in northern and 
southern fruits, with only three components showing statistical differences: 
chlorogenic acid, vanillic acid, and protocatechuic acid(P&lt;0.05). There were 
more and stronger correlations among phenolic acid compounds in pome fruits, 
followed by citrus and melon fruits. The correlations of phenolic acid compounds 
in tropical fruits, drupe, and berry fruits were fewer. Among phenolic acid 
compounds in all fruits, only sinapic acid and ferulic acid had a strong 
positive correlation(r=0.736, P&lt;0.01).
CONCLUSION: There are certain differences in the content of chlorogenic acid, 
protocatechuic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, 
sinapic acid, salicylic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and the sum of phenolic 
acids among the six categories of fruits. There were certain correlations among 
phenolic acid compounds in fruits.

Cranberries are a rich source of (poly)phenols, in particular proanthocyanidins, 
anthocyanins, flavonols, and phenolic acids. However, little is known about 
their bioavailability in humans. We investigated the absorption, metabolism, and 
excretion of cranberry (poly)phenols in plasma and urine of healthy young men 
after consumption of a cranberry juice (787 mg (poly)phenols). A total of 60 
cranberry-derived phenolic metabolites were identified using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS 
analysis with authentic standards. These included sulfates of pyrogallol, 
valerolactone, benzoic acids, phenylacetic acids, glucuronides of flavonols, as 
well as sulfates and glucuronides of cinnamic acids. The most abundant plasma 
metabolites were small phenolic compounds, in particular hippuric acid, 
catechol-O-sulfate, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, phenylacetic acid, isoferulic 
acid, 4-methylcatechol-O-sulfate, α-hydroxyhippuric acid, ferulic acid 
4-O-sulfate, benzoic acid, 4-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid, dihydrocaffeic acid 
3-O-sulfate, and vanillic acid-4-O-sulfate. Some benzoic acids, cinnamic acids, 
and flavonol metabolites appeared in plasma early, at 1-2 h post-consumption. 
Others such as phenylacetic acids, benzaldehydes, pyrogallols, catechols, 
hippuric and dihydrocinnamic acid derivatives appear in plasma later (Tmax 
4-22 h). The 24 h urinary recovery with respect to the amount of (poly)phenols 
consumed was 6.2%. Our extensive description of the bioavailability of cranberry 
(poly)phenols lays important groundwork necessary to start understanding the 
fate of these compounds in humans.

The study explored how organic acids, sugars, anthocyanins, volatiles, and 
phenolics contributed to the quality formation of pomegranate fruit wine derived 
from 6 cultivars. Fermentation resulted in 97.01 % to 98.39 % sugar consumption 
and a 20 % - 104.76 % increase in acid content across all cultivars. In the 2 
sour pomegranates, high initial acidity inhibited sugar metabolism and led to a 
pronounced acid accumulation during fermentation. In contrast, 2 sweet 
pomegranates with intense red coloration showed greater color degradation and 
phenolic hydrolysis, with anthocyanins and individual phenolics decreasing by 
67.96 % - 73.25 % and 57.24 % - 74.72 %, respectively. Volatile profiles were 
also reshaped by enriching in fatty acid esters and acetate esters. Sour 
pomegranates developed more intense and complex aroma profiles compared to the 
sweet ones. This work enhances the understanding of how raw material composition 
impacts on pomegranate wine processing, offering theoretical guidance for 
improving the quality of pomegranate-based products.

Puerarin (daidzein-8-C-glucoside) is the major bioactive isoflavone of kudzu 
root (the root of Pueraria lobata). Its metabolic fate, however, is not 
well-known. In this study, a sensitive and specific LC-ESI-MS/MS method for the 
determination of puerarin and its metabolites daidzein, dihydrodaidzein, and 
equol was developed for their analysis in biological samples. Two new 
metabolites of puerarin, mono- and dihydroxylated derivatives, were detected in 
the urine and feces of rats after oral administration. The persistence of 
puerarin in blood and urine as the principal metabolic form for the period of 
4-72 h after oral administration suggested that puerarin is rapidly absorbed 
from the intestine without metabolism. Its presence in organs such as the brain 
suggests that this glucoside may enter tissues by specific transport pathways. 
Study of these metabolites may provide further understanding of the health 
beneficial effects of puerarin in kudzu dietary supplements.

Proanthocyanidin rich plant extracts derived from grape seed extract (GSE), 
hawthorn and cranberry are on markets for their preventive effects against 
cardiovascular diseases and uroinfections in woman. However, the importance of 
these health beneficial effects of these botanicals remains elusive due to 
incomplete understanding of uptake, metabolism and bioavailability of 
proanthocyanidins in vivo. In the present study rats were given GSE orally (300 
mg/kg, twice a day) and blood and urine were collected over a 24 h period. 
Monomeric catechins and their methylated metabolites, and proanthocyanidins up 
to trimers were detected in blood samples treated with GSE using LC-MS/MS 
operating in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. A new tetramethylated 
metabolite of dimeric proanthocyanidin (m/z 633) in GSE-treated urine was 
tentatively identified. Using LC-MS/MS, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were 
identified in the brain conclusively. These data suggested that GSE catechins 
cross the blood brain barrier and may be responsible for the neuroprotective 
effects of GSE.

The principal chemical forms of isoflavones in soybean are their 
6''-O-malonyl-beta-glucoside (6OMalGlc) conjugates. Experiments were carried out 
to determine the best conditions for extraction of isoflavones from soyfoods and 
the effects of commercial processing procedures and of cooking on isoflavone 
concentrations and composition. Hot alcohol extraction of ground soybeans 
deesterified 6OMalGlc conjugates. Although room temperature extraction slowed 
the conversion, extraction at 4 degrees C for 2-4 h led to the highest yield of 
6OMalGlc conjugates and the lowest proportion of beta-glucoside conjugates. 
Analysis of soyfood products by reversed-phase HPLC-mass spectrometry revealed 
that defatted soy flour that had not been heat treated consisted mostly of 
6OMalGlc conjugates; in contrast, toasted soy flour contained large amounts of 
6''-O-acetyl-beta-glucoside conjugates, formed by heat-induced decarboxylation 
of the malonate group to acetate. Soymilk and tofu consisted almost entirely of 
beta-glucoside conjugates; low-fat versions of these products were markedly 
depleted in isoflavones. Alcohol-washed soy-protein concentrates contained few 
isoflavones. Isolated soy protein and textured vegetable protein consisted of a 
mixture of all 3 types of isoflavone conjugates. Baking or frying of textured 
vegetable protein at 190 degrees C and baking of soy flour in cookies did not 
alter total isoflavone content, but there was a steady increase in 
beta-glucoside conjugates at the expense of 6OMalGlc conjugates. The chemical 
form of isoflavones in foods should be taken into consideration when evaluating 
their availability for absorption from the diet.

With the increasing global nutritional bar market, developing and formulating 
innovative high-energy and protein bars to compensate for nutrients using date 
fruits is beneficial for health-conscious individuals. The current research was 
undertaken to study the composition and physicochemical characteristics of 
innovative high-energy and high-protein bars using two combinations of Sukkari 
dates or fruit mixtures as a base. Fifty percent of either Sukkari date paste or 
dried fruit mixture (25% raisin, 12.5% fig, and 12.5% apricot) combined with 
other different ingredients was used to produce a date-based bar (DBB) or 
fruit-based bar (FBB). Proximate composition, sugar content, amino and fatty 
acid profiles, minerals and vitamins, phytochemicals, antioxidant activity, and 
visual color parameters of the DBB and the FBB were determined and statistically 
compared. Proximate analysis revealed higher moisture and fat content in the FBB 
than the DBB, while ash and crude fiber were higher in the DBB than the FBB. The 
protein content in the DBB and the FBB was not statistically different. Both 
prepared bars exuded around 376-378 kcal 100 g-1 fresh weight. Sugar profile 
analysis of the DBB and the FBB showed dependable changes based on date or fruit 
content. Fructose, glucose, and maltose contents were higher in the FBB than in 
the DBB, while sucrose content was higher in the DBB than in the FBB. The DBB 
showed significantly higher content in Ca, Cu, Fe, Zn, Mn, and Se and 
significantly lower content in Mg, K, and Na than the FBB, with no variation in 
phosphorus content. The DBB and the FBB contained both essential (EAA) and 
non-essential (NEAA) amino acids. The DBB scored higher Lysine, Methionine, 
Histidine, Threonine, Phenylalanine, Isoleucine, and Cystine contents than the 
FBB, while the FBB scored only higher Leucine and Valine contents than the DBB. 
Seventeen saturated fatty acids were identified in the DBB and the FBB, with 
Palmitic acid (C16:0) as the predominant fatty acid. Oleic acid (C18:1n9c) was 
predominant among seven determined monounsaturated fatty acids. Linoleic fatty 
acid (C18:2n6c) was predominant among eight identified polyunsaturated fatty 
acids. In addition, α-Linolenic (C18:3n3) was detected in a considerable amount. 
However, in both the DBB and the FBB, the content and distribution of fatty 
acids were not remarkably changed. Regarding phytochemicals and bioactive 
compounds, the FBB was significantly higher in total phenolic content (TPC), 
total flavonoids (TF), and total flavonols (TFL) contents and scavenging 
activity against DPPH and ABTS free radicals than the DBB. The DBB and the FBB 
showed positive a* values, indicating a reddish color. The b* values were 27.81 
and 28.54 for the DBB and the FBB, respectively. The DBB is affected by the 
lower L* value and higher browning index (BI) to make its color brownish. 
Sensory evaluation data showed that panelists significantly preferred the DBB 
over the FBB. In conclusion, processing and comparing these bars indicated that 
using Sukkari dates is a nutrient-dense, convenient, economical, and better 
sugar alternative that helps combat the calorie content. Thus, scaling up the 
use of dates instead of fruits in producing high-energy and protein bars 
commercially is highly recommended.

The bioactive compounds present in cocoa, such as polyphenols and 
methylxanthines, are known for their health benefits. The concentration of these 
compounds in cocoa beans is influenced by genotype and post-harvest processing. 
This study utilized a targeted metabolomics approach using UPLC-MS/MS to 
quantify polyphenols (flavan-3-ols, anthocyanins, flavonols, and phenolic acids) 
and methylxanthines in fermented and unfermented cocoa beans from 18 genotypes 
largely cultivated in the Brazilian Amazon region. The major compounds 
identified were theobromine, (-)-epicatechin, procyanidin C1, procyanidin B2, 
and caffeine. Fermentation significantly reduced the concentration of most 
compounds, except for protocatechuic acid, which increased. Principal component 
analysis revealed that chemical differences between fermented and unfermented 
cocoa beans are more pronounced than those between genotypes, mainly due to 
flavan-3-ols and anthocyanins. The concentrations of bioactive compounds varied 
significantly among the 18 genotypes both before and after fermentation. The 
fermented beans were grouped into three distinct clusters, the genotype CAB214 
exhibited the lowest concentrations of bioactive compounds, while CCN51 had the 
highest. The observed chemical diversity has important implications for the 
selection of genotypes aimed at producing chocolate with high levels of 
bioactive compounds and for formulating products in other industries.

The main objective of this study was to increase the economic value of broccoli 
green agro-waste using three wet fractionation methods in the shadow of green 
biorefinery and the circular economy. Product candidates were obtained directly 
by using a mechanical press, and indirectly by using microwave coagulation or 
via lactic acid fermentation of green juice. The leaf protein concentrates (LPC) 
fractions displayed significantly higher dry matter content and crude protein 
content (34-39 m/m% on average) than the green juice fraction (27.4 m/m% on 
average), without considerable changes in the amino acids composition ratio. 
UHPLC-ESI-ORBITRAP-MS/MS analysis showed that kaemferol and quercetin are the 
most abundant flavonols, forming complexes with glycosides and hydroxycinnamic 
acids in green juice. Lacto-ermentation induced a considerable increase in the 
quantity of quercetin (48.75 μg·g-1 dry weight) and kaempferol aglycons (895.26 
μg·g-1 dry weight) of LPC. In contrast, chlorogenic acid isomers and 
sulforaphane disappeared from LPC after lactic acid fermentation, while 
microwave treatment did not cause significant differences. These results confirm 
that both microwave treatment and lacto-fermentation coagulate and concentrate 
most of the soluble proteins. Also, these two processes affect the amount of 
valuable phytochemicals differently, so it should be considered when setting the 
goals.

The yield and quality of cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.) medicinal plant are 
significantly affected by water stress. Producing a synthetic variety of cumin 
using polycross breeding can be an appropriate method for optimizing the 
biosynthesis of metabolites to create high-yielding, drought-tolerant plants 
with higher metabolite content and antioxidant properties. Therefore, a 
comprehensive study was conducted to evaluate the impact of drought stress on 
seed yield, metabolite content, antioxidant properties of ethanolic, methanolic, 
and aqueous extracts, essential oil content and composition, fatty acid 
composition, and physical seed traits of the synthetic variety of cumin in 
comparison with several parental genotypes over two growing seasons under normal 
irrigation (100% field capacity) and drought stress (30% field capacity) 
conditions. The results showed a 79.58%, 12.78% and 12.89% increase in seed 
yield, protein and carbohydrate content of the synthetic cultivar compared to 
the average of the parental genotypes under drought stress conditions. The 
decreasing effect of drought stress on the physical traits of seeds including 
1000-seed weight, area, circumference, length and width of the seed in the 
synthetic cultivar (6.31, 20.84, 17.56, 9.44 and 7.45% respectively) was much 
less than that of the parental genotypes (9.67, 31.82, 18.56, 19.76 and 11.99% 
respectively). Under drought stress conditions, the synthetic cultivar had the 
highest essential oil content (3.11%) and oil content (12.04%). Also, in the 
synthetic variety, the amount of the main active compound of the essential oil 
(cumin aldehyde) and oil (oleic acid) also increased more due to drought stress. 
The synthetic variety had higher content of secondary metabolites (phenol, 
flavonol and flavonoid) and antioxidant properties, especially under drought 
stress conditions. Ethanol was also identified as the most suitable solvent for 
the extraction of polyphenolic compounds and antioxidant power. These findings 
suggest that producing a synthetic variety can be a suitable option for breeding 
high-quality cumin in arid regions. The results of this study can be utilized in 
breeding programs to develop drought-tolerant cumin varieties and other related 
plants with high yield and quality.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Commiphora leptophloeos (Imburana or Umburuna) 
represents a significant botanical resource within the Burseraceae family. 
Indigenous populations across Brazil have historically utilized this medicinal 
plant for addressing various pathological conditions, including respiratory 
diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, ulcerative lesions, and diverse 
inflammatory manifestations. Despite its ethnomedicinal significance, 
comprehensive investigations into the molecular mechanisms governing its 
anti-inflammatory properties remain inadequately explored, limiting our 
understanding of its potential therapeutic uses.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This research evaluated the capacity of leaf and bark extracts 
derived from C. leptophloeos to modulate oxidative stress-induced inflammation 
(OxInflammation) in vitro, while also investigating the molecular signalling 
cascades that mediate these effects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phytochemical profiling of C. leptophloeos leaf and bark 
extracts was performed using flow injection analysis coupled with electrospray 
ionization ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (FIA-ESI-IT-MS/MS). Total phenolic 
and total flavonoid contents were determined through the Folin-Ciocalteu 
methodology, and the aluminum chloride colorimetric technique, respectively. 
Antioxidant capacity was evaluated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) 
radical scavenging assay. The anti-inflammatory potential was assessed through 
multiple complementary methodologies, including: (i) inhibition of protein 
denaturation via bovine serum albumin (BSA) assay; (ii) erythrocyte membrane 
stabilization against hypotonicity-induced lysis; and (iii) trypsin proteolytic 
activity inhibition. Cellular viability was determined using 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. 
Catalase (CAT) enzymatic activity was measured following hydrogen peroxide 
(H2O2) exposure. Nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW 264.7 macrophages was 
quantified using the Griess reaction. Cyclooxygenase (COX) activity was assessed 
via commercial ELISA methodology. Transcriptional regulation of pro-inflammatory 
markers (TLR4, NF-κB, BAX, COX-2, TNF-α, IL-6) and anti-inflammatory/antioxidant 
mediators (Nrf2, HO-1, HIF-1, IL-10) was quantified through real-time 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).
RESULTS: Chromatographic analysis of C. leptophloeos leaf extracts (HECL-LE) 
revealed a complex phytochemical profile comprising one phenolic acid and 
fourteen glycosylated flavonoids derived from apigenin, luteolin, and quercetin. 
Conversely, bark extracts (HECL-BA) exhibited a distinctive chemical signature 
characterized by seven major constituents, including quinic acid and six 
oligomeric B-type procyanidins. Both extracts demonstrated strong antioxidant 
properties, inhibiting more than 80 % of DPPH radicals. Additionally, neither 
extract exhibited hemolytic activity while providing approximately 20 % 
protection against protein denaturation. Bark extracts enhanced cellular 
viability and migration capacity, whereas leaf extracts enhanced catalase 
enzymatic activity. Both extracts exhibited significant anti-inflammatory 
properties, as evidenced by reduced nitric oxide production and downregulation 
of key inflammatory mediators including TLR4, NF-κB, IL-6, TNF-α, BAX, and 
COX-2. Notably, the extracts upregulated Nrf2 expression, a critical 
transcription factor orchestrating cellular antioxidant responses and oxidative 
stress regulation.
CONCLUSIONS: The leaf extracts of C. leptophloeos, characterized by their rich 
flavonoid content-including two novel compounds (luteolin-O-feruloyl-O-hexose 
and apigenin-8-C-hexose-6-O-4-hydroxybenzoic acid)-and bark extracts containing 
oligomeric proanthocyanidins and phenolic compounds, demonstrated substantial 
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties with minimal cytotoxicity. The 
primary molecular mechanisms underlying OxInflammation modulation involve 
attenuation of the TLR4 and NF-κB pathways, decreased levels of pro-inflammatory 
mediators (BAX, IL-6, TNF-α, COX-2), and reduction of nitric oxide production. 
Notably, Nrf2 expression was significantly upregulated, particularly in response 
to bark extract treatment, underscoring its key contribution to oxidative stress 
modulation and facilitating the resolution of acute inflammation. These results 
collectively demonstrate the pharmacological efficacy of C. leptophloeos 
extracts in managing inflammatory conditions linked to oxidative stress, thereby 
providing a scientific basis for their ethnomedicinal applications.

Dietary polyphenolics can be converted into smaller phenolic acids (PA) by 
microorganisms in the colon and may contribute to health benefits associated 
with the parent polyphenolics. Urinary excretion of 18 PA and their conjugates 
was studied, using HPLC-MS/MS, in rats fed AIN93G-based diets containing 5% (dry 
weight basis) of either cranberry (CB), blueberry (BB), or black raspberry 
(BRB). Hippuric, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic, and 
4-hydroxybenzoic acids were excreted in greatest quantity in the urine over a 24 
h period in all diets. Primary PA excreted in the berry diets were 
4-hydroxycinnamic acid for CB; chlorogenic, ferulic, and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic 
acids for BB; and 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic, 3-hydroxybenzoic, and 
3-hydroxycinnamic acids for BRB. PA were present in conjugated form with 
cinnamic acid derivatives being 50-70% and phenylacetic acid derivatives 
conjugated <10%. Conjugated, and not just the free, PA are significant 
contributors to total urinary excretion.

Extracts of aromatic plants of Greek origin were examined as potential sources 
of phenolic compounds. RP-HPLC with UV detection was employed for the 
identification and quantification of the phenolic antioxidants, present in 
methanolic extracts. The most abundant phenolic acids were ferulic acid (1.1-280 
mg/100 g of dry sample) and caffeic acid (1.2-60 mg/100 g of dry sample). 
(+)-Catechin and quercetin were the most abundant flavonoids. Apigenin and 
luteolin were detected in high amounts in Menta pulegium and Thymus vulgaris, 
respectively. The antioxidant capacity was determined, in dried ground plants 
and in their methanol extracts, with the Rancimat test using sunflower oil as 
substrate. Both pulverized plants and extracts showed antioxidant capacity. 
Total phenolic content in the extracts was determined spectrometrically 
according to the Folin-Ciocalteu assay and ranged from 1 to 21 mg of gallic 
acid/100 g of dry sample. Antimicrobial activity of the extracts against 
selected microbes was also conducted in this study.

High production volume chemicals (HPVCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(PAHs) are semi-volatile organic compounds (semi-VOCs) of great environmental 
concern because of their presence worldwide and health problems resulting from 
long-term exposure to some of them. It is essential to have robust analytical 
methods to monitor the concentrations of these compounds not only in 
environmental samples but also individual exposure. In this pilot study we 
develop and validate a multiresidue analytical method based on 
ultrasound-assisted extraction and gas-chromatography mass spectrometry for the 
simultaneous determination of 56 semi-VOCs using silicone wristbands (SWBs) as 
personal passive samplers. The developed method provided recoveries between 43% 
and 114% on sampled SWBs and method detection and quantification limits in the 
range of 0.1-35 ng/g and 0.3-119 ng/g, respectively. A preliminary study was 
performed with a small group of adults living in the industrial city of 
Tarragona (north-eastern Spain) to evaluate the applicability of SWBs for 
monitoring individual exposure to the studied HPVCs and PAHs. Benzothiazoles, 
benzenesulfonamides, UV stabilisers and phenolic antioxidants were determined 
for the first time in SWBs. Phthalates (PAEs), stood out above the rest, 
accounting for 52% of the total concentrations. Diethylhexyl phthalate was the 
compound found at the highest concentrations with values between 1.1 and 
82 μg/g. Carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic dermal risk assessment was performed 
for adults and considering two scenarios (low and high). PAHs were the compounds 
with the highest carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic dermal risk regardless of the 
exposure scenario. The second family of compounds that contributed the most to 
the total risk were PAEs but high punctual concentrations of these compounds 
caused significant differences between exposure scenarios.

Epidemiological studies have suggested an inverse association between polyphenol 
intake and the risk of chronic diseases. However, the lack of comprehensive data 
on population-level intakes, especially in Latin American countries, has limited 
research on this topic. We aimed to estimate total and individual polyphenol 
intakes and determine the major dietary contributors in a representative sample 
of the Brazilian population. Data were obtained from the Brazilian Household 
Budget Survey, a cross-sectional survey which included data on individual food 
intake of 34 003 subjects aged 10 years and over collected using two 24-h 
dietary records. Polyphenol content of foods was identified using the 
Phenol-Explorer database and Brazilian Food Composition Database. Total and 
individual polyphenol intake was calculated, as well as the intake distribution 
by socio-demographic factors. The median and 25-75th percentiles of polyphenol 
intake were 364·3 and 200·9-1008 mg/d, respectively. After energy adjustment, 
the median and 25-75th percentiles of polyphenol intake were 204 and 111·4-542·1 
mg/1000 kcal/d (4184 kJ/d), respectively. Non-alcoholic beverages and fruits 
were the major polyphenol suppliers, and coffee and orange juice the main 
individual food contributors to polyphenol intake. The individual compounds most 
consumed were isomers of chlorogenic acid (5-caffeoylquinic acid, 
4-caffeoylquinic acid, 3-caffeoylquinic acid), naringenin and hesperetin. The 
present study provides, for the first time, data on dietary intake of total and 
individual polyphenols by the Brazilian population and illustrates the low 
quality of their diet. These results will facilitate the study of associations 
between polyphenol class intake and health outcomes, and will also be useful for 
future dietary intake recommendations.

In this study, leaves and roots from three beetroot cultivars (cv. Albina 
Vereduna (white roots), cv. Burpee's Golden (golden roots), and cv. Pablo F1 
(red roots)), as well as Swiss chard leaves (also known as ""rhubarb chard"", or 
Beta vulgaris subsp. cicla var. flavescens) were evaluated in terms of their 
chemical profile and bioactive properties. Roots were characterized by high 
carbohydrate content, which also contributed to greater energy values. In 
contrast, fibers were the predominant macronutrient in leaves, followed by 
carbohydrates. In both leaves and roots, the most abundant organic acids were 
quinic and oxalic, while the major free sugar was sucrose. The profile of fatty 
acid varied between the studied plant parts, with saturated fatty acids 
prevailing in root samples, while leaves exhibited higher levels of 
polyunsaturated fatty acids. Regarding phenolic composition, a total of 19 
compounds were tentatively identified in leaves (including derivatives of 
vitexin, isorhamnetin, quercetin, and ferulic, sinapic, and p-coumaric acids), 
while the roots exhibited a less diverse composition, with a total of eight 
compounds identified (e.g., derivatives of ferulic, sinapic, p-coumaric and 
caffeic acids). A total of eight betalains were also identified, out of which 
seven were classified as betacyanins and one as betaxanthin. The leaves of Swiss 
chard presented compounds from both classes, while the roots and leaves of cv. 
Pablo F1 were characterized only by the presence of betacyanins, and those of 
cv. Burpee's Golden only by betaxanthin. All samples exhibited relevant activity 
against Y. enterocolitica, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus, although leaf 
samples demonstrated better antioxidant capacity. In conclusion, beetroot leaves 
outperformed their corresponding roots in terms of chemical composition, 
antioxidant, and antimicrobial activity, suggesting their high potential as 
nutrient-rich and functional ingredients in a diverse and well-balanced diet.

Allelopathic interactions among microalgae play a crucial role in shaping 
phytoplankton community dynamics and have gained attention as potential 
strategies for harmful algal bloom (HAB) control. This study investigated the 
allelopathic effects of Prorocentrum minimum on Skeletonema costatum and 
Heterosigma akashiwo using culture filtrates under varying concentrations and 
heat treatments. Results showed that high-concentration filtrates of P. minimum 
induced cell rupture and lysis for the both species, while moderate 
concentrations (1/3 and 1/2) inhibited their growth but allowed partial cell 
viability. A biphasic effect was observed on H. akashiwo, where low 
concentrations promoted growth, but higher levels were inhibitory. Thermal 
stability tests revealed that the allelochemicals of P. minimum retained their 
inhibitory activity even after heating at 90 °C, especially against S. costatum. 
In contrast, H. akashiwo exhibited recovery in cell density and chlorophyll 
fluorescence (Ft) with increased temperature and duration, suggesting greater 
resilience. Photosynthetic efficiency, measured as Fv/Fm, declined significantly 
for both species under high-concentration filtrate exposure, particularly for H. 
akashiwo. Biochemical assays showed reduced total protein levels and elevated 
malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating oxidative stress brought by filtrates of P. 
minimum. Enzyme activities (SOD, CAT and ATPase) varied by species and 
treatment, again reflecting a pattern of low-concentration stimulation and 
high-concentration inhibition. The allelochemicals released by P. minimum 
demonstrated species-specific effects and substantial chemical complexity, 
disrupting photosynthesis, metabolic activity and redox balance in target 
species. These findings highlight the potential of allelopathy as a tool for 
managing HABs through selective suppression of harmful microalgae.

In this study, metabolomic analysis of chloroform extracts was performed to 
characterize cherry tomatoes (cv Naomi and Shiren) grown in different Sicilian 
areas, using 1H NMR spectroscopy coupled with multivariate statistical analysis. 
Principal components analysis showed clear discrimination between extracts of 
cherry tomatoes cultivated in two different seasons (winter and summer) and 
grown in three areas of Sicily (Gela, Licata, Pachino). In particular, 
carotenoids and phospholipids mainly were found to be more discriminating 
metabolites for both cultivars in summer and winter. In the present study, the 
simple separation only based on production area was found to be inadequate to 
distinguish the three groups of tomatoes. A clear separation among the different 
samples groups was obtained using a multifactorial approach not only based on 
the geographical origin classification, but considering also cultivar, year and 
seasonality.

Virgin olive oils from percolation (first extraction) have been compared with 
the corresponding oils from centrifugation (second extraction). The former were 
characterized by (i) higher contents of total phenols, o-diphenols, 
hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol-aglycons, tocopherols, trans-2-hexenal, total volatiles, 
and waxes; (ii) higher values of resistance to autoxidation and of turbidity; 
(iii) higher sensory scores; (iv) higher ratios of campesterol/stigmasterol, 
trans-2-hexenal/hexanal, and trans-2-hexenal/total volatiles; (v) lower contents 
of chlorophylls, pheophytins, sterols, and aliphatic and triterpene alcohols; 
(vi) lower alcoholic index and color indices; (vii) similar values of acidity, 
peroxide index, and UV (ultraviolet) spectrophotometric indices; (viii) similar 
percentages of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, triglycerides, and 
diglycerides; and (ix) similar values of glyceridic indices. Stigmastadienes, 
trans-oleic, trans-linoleic, and trans-linolenic acid isomers were not detected 
in the two genuine oil kinds. Hence, the qualitative level of the first 
extraction oil was superior to the second extraction one.

Extraction, resolution, and determination of the trans-hydroxycinnamic acids 
(caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic) were performed in 82 orange juices 
derived from the most important blood and blond varieties grown in Italy. 
Soluble solids, acidity, and anthocyanins were also determined. Hydroxycinnamic 
acids were more abundant in blood orange than in blond juices. Ferulic acid was 
the major component in all cases, but the distribution of the four acids was 
typical in each variety. Discriminant analysis of the experimental results 
showed that these acids could be used as markers of blood and blond varieties. 
The statistical model was used to recognize some mixtures of blood and blond 
juices.

Several fresh orange juices, obtained from five different Citrus sinensis (L.) 
Osbeck varieties (three pigmented varieties, Moro, Sanguinello, and Tarocco, and 
two blond varieties, Valencia late and Washington navel), were subjected to 
antioxidant profile determination (including total polyphenols, flavanones, 
anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, and ascorbic acid). The antioxidant 
activity of these juices was then assessed by means of different ""in vitro"" 
tests (bleaching of the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical; 
peroxidation, induced by the water-soluble radical initiator 
2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride, on mixed 
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/linoleic acid unilamellar vesicles; scavenging 
activity against nitric oxide; total antioxidant status). All orange juices 
tested showed an evident antioxidant effect. Our findings indicate the 
following: (1) the antioxidant efficiency of orange juices may be attributed, in 
a significant part at least, to their content of total phenols, (2) while 
ascorbic acid seems to play a minor role; (3) the antioxidant activity of orange 
juices is related not only to structural features of phytochemicals contained in 
them, but also to their capability to interact with biomembranes; (4) finally, 
as to pigmented juices, their antioxidant efficiency appears to be widely 
influenced by the anthocyanin level. One could speculate that the supply of 
natural antioxidant phenols through daily consumption of orange juice might 
provide additional protection against in vivo oxidation of cellular 
biomolecules.

Quantitative analysis of anthocyanins was performed on a series of blood orange 
juices according to various spectrophotometric and HPLC methods, and the causes 
for different concentration resulting from the application of such procedures 
were investigated. Spectrophotometric methods utilizing aqueous ethanol as a 
solvent provided an anthocyanin content higher than that determined by HPLC. 
Discrepancies were ascribed to the use of impure standards and/or unsuitable 
calibration lines. The most consistent results with the HPLC findings were 
obtained by a method utilizing water as a solvent and cyanidin-3-glucoside as a 
standard. Actual concentration of anthocyanins in blood orange juice was 
remarkably lower than that currently determined by procedures used in the juice 
producing factories.

This study evaluated the impact of High-Temperature Short-Time (HTST) and 
Continuous Flow High-Pressure Homogenization (CFHPH) on the quality attributes 
of grapefruit juice by measuring ascorbic acid, phenolic acids, overall 
antioxidant activity, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, and the growth of 
probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum. The results indicate that HTST 
treatments (75-95 °C) led to a significant (p ≤ 0.05) decline in ascorbic acid 
content, with losses reaching 80.7 %, and a reduction in antioxidant activity, 
primarily due to thermal degradation. In contrast, CFHPH, particularly at 
300 MPa and 4 °C, was found to be effective in preserving ascorbic acid and 
phenolic acid levels in the juice, exhibiting significantly lower degradation 
(≤38.0 % loss) and maintaining higher antioxidant activity throughout the 45-day 
storage period. CFHPH also inactivated PPO, reducing browning potential and 
enhancing the bioavailability of phenolic compounds. The growth of Lactobacillus 
plantarum was favored in CFHPH-treated juices, indicating that the conditions 
and nutrient availability supported its proliferation. In contrast, HTST juices 
displayed lower abundance of phenolics, reduced antioxidant activity, and 
moderate probiotic growth, potentially due to thermal degradation of carbon 
substrates, resulting in limited nutrient availability to support bacterial 
growth. These findings suggest that CFHPH, particularly at lower temperatures 
and higher pressures, is more effective in preserving the nutritional quality 
and probiotic potential of grapefruit juice than traditional thermal treatments. 
Despite its higher energy costs, CFHPH offers a promising alternative for 
retaining bioactive compounds, enhancing the functional quality of processed 
juices, and ensuring the delivery of high-quality products with health-promoting 
attributes to consumers.

Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) is a source of fiber, carbohydrates, minerals and 
phytochemicals such as carotenoids and phenolic compounds. Biofortification with 
provitamin A carotenoid improves the nutritional properties of sweet potatoes 
and can contribute to reducing the deficiency of this micronutrient, but cooking 
may affect its composition. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the 
effect of seven different domestic cooking processes (deep frying, air frying, 
steaming, boiling, pressure cooking, baking, and microwave cooking) on the 
color, phenolic compounds, antioxidant activity, and real retention of 
β-carotene in biofortified sweet potatoes. The air frying was the process that 
promoted more remarkable changes on the color (p < 0.05). The air fryer was the 
most recommended domestic processes for maintaining phenolic compounds and 
antioxidant capacity, while the oven was the least recommended method 
(p < 0.05). Pressure cooking and boiling were the most recommended methods for 
greater β-carotene real retention, whereas air fryer resulted in the greatest 
β-carotene losses in biofortified sweet potatoes (p < 0.05). Different 
conventional cooking methods influence the degree of loss of phytochemicals 
present in biofortified sweet potatoes, which can impact the consumption of 
these nutrients, and the efficiency of the food biofortification program.

Effects of catechins with different structure characteristics on the structure 
and properties of gluten-catechin covalent complex were investigated, and the 
structure-activity relationship was further explored. Catechins including 
epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), and 
epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) could successfully covalently bind with gluten 
through C-N and/or C-S bonds. The physicochemical properties of covalent 
complex, including particle size, thermal stability, content of free amino 
groups, free sulfhydryl groups and disulfide bonds, were significantly affected 
by different catechins, and the action order was: EGCG > ECG > EGC > EC. 
Multispectral analysis indicated that catechins significantly changed the 
tertiary and secondary structures of covalent complex, while galloylated 
catechins (ECG and EGCG) showed stronger capability than non-galloylated 
catechins (EC and EGC). Furthermore, the in vitro protein digestibility of 
covalent complexes reduced with all catechins, and its polyphenols release rate 
and antioxidant activity were improved. Combining multispectral analysis and 
molecular dynamics simulation, the hydroxyl group at 5th position in B ring and 
the galloyl group at 3rd position in C ring played an important role to affect 
the covalent binding of catechins and gluten, while the amount of hydroxyl 
groups and the molecule size of catechins both significantly affected its 
capability to covalently bind with gluten.

Onions (Allium cepa L.) are widely consumed worldwide and are recognized for 
their high content of bioactive compounds with potential health benefits. This 
study investigates the nutritional and phytochemical properties of three onion 
varieties-Tropea red onion, red onion, and yellow onion-analyzed in their whole 
form as well as in their peel and pulp. An innovative drying system was employed 
to assess its impact on the retention of bioactive compounds. The results 
highlight significant differences in nutrient composition among varieties and 
onion parts. The peel exhibited the highest concentrations of proteins, phenolic 
compounds, flavonoids, and antioxidants, followed by the whole onion and pulp. 
Tropea red onion stood out for its superior antioxidant capacity, vitamin C 
content, and phenolic acid levels, reinforcing its potential for functional food 
applications. This study also revealed that mineral content, particularly 
calcium, potassium, and sulfates, varied across onion varieties, influencing 
their nutritional and health-promoting properties. These findings support the 
valorization of onion byproducts for their bioactive potential and 
sustainability in the food industry. The data emphasize the need for further 
research on innovative processing techniques that enhance the bioavailability 
and effectiveness of onion-derived health-promoting compounds.

Although chronic exposure to secoisolariciresinol diglycoside (SDG) was shown to 
alter (3)H-SDG metabolite disposition in rats, the proportion of measured 
radioactivity attributed to known or unknown SDG metabolites was not determined. 
Using HPLC and GC-MS, two experiments were conducted to determine the effect of 
acute (1 d) vs. chronic (10 d) SDG treatment on major urinary metabolites of 
(3)H-SDG in female, Sprague-Dawley rats (70-72-d-old) over a 48-h period and if 
new urinary metabolites were detectable in rats fed nonradioactive flaxseed or 
SDG. A third experiment was conducted to determine changes in postprandial blood 
levels of (3)H-SDG metabolites over a 24-h period with acute or chronic SDG 
treatment. Regardless of treatment, enterodiol, enterolactone and 
secoisolariciresinol accounted for 75-80% of urine radioactivity. Four potential 
new lignan metabolites, two of which were detected in the urine of rats fed 
nonradioactive flaxseed or SDG, were found. Type of treatment had no effect on 
levels of individual urinary metabolites of (3)H-SDG. As observed for plasma 
lignans in women fed flaxseed, blood radioactivity peaked at 9 h and remained 
high until 24 h in both treatment groups, suggesting that blood lignan kinetics 
might be similar with flaxseed or SDG consumption and that they were comparable 
between humans and rats. In conclusion, the main urinary lignan metabolites were 
enterodiol, enterolactone and secoisolariciresinol. Urinary composition or blood 
levels of radioactive lignans were not affected by the duration of SDG exposure. 
Thus, while chronic SDG exposure alters lignan disposition in rats, it does not 
change the metabolite profile.

Depending on the commodity, freezing and canning processes may preserve nutrient value. The initial thermal treatment of processed products can cause loss of water‐soluble and oxygen‐labile nutrients such as vitamin C and the B vitamins. However, these nutrients are relatively stable during subsequent canned storage owing to the lack of oxygen. Frozen products lose fewer nutrients initially because of the short heating time in blanching, but they lose more nutrients during storage owing to oxidation. Phenolic compounds are also water‐soluble and oxygen‐labile, but changes during processing, storage and cooking appear to be highly variable by commodity. Further studies would facilitate the understanding of the changes in these phytochemicals. Changes in moisture content during storage, cooking and processing can misrepresent changes in nutrient content. These findings indicate that exclusive recommendations of fresh produce ignore the nutrient benefits of canned and frozen products. Nutritional comparison would be facilitated if future research would express nutrient data on a dry weight basis to account for changes in moisture.

A study was conducted to determine the presence of resveratrol, pterostilbene, 
and piceatannol in Vaccinium berries. Samples representing selections and 
cultivars of 10 species from Mississippi, North Carolina, Oregon, and Canada 
were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Resveratrol was found in 
Vaccinium angustifolium (lowbush blueberry), Vaccinium arboretum (sparkleberry), 
Vaccinium ashei (rabbiteye blueberry), Vaccinium corymbosum (highbush 
blueberry), Vaccinium elliottii (Elliott's blueberry), Vaccinium macrocarpon 
(cranberry), Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry), Vaccinium stamineum (deerberry), 
Vaccinium vitis-ideae var. vitis-ideae (lingonberry), and Vaccinium vitis-ideae 
var. minor (partridgeberry) at levels between 7 and 5884 ng/g dry sample. 
Lingonberry was found to have the highest content, 5884 ng/g dry sample, 
comparable to that found in grapes, 6471 ng/g dry sample. Pterostilbene was 
found in two cultivars of V. ashei and in V. stamineum at levels of 99-520 ng/g 
dry sample. Piceatannol was found in V. corymbosum and V. stamineum at levels of 
138-422 ng/g dry sample. These naturally occurring stilbenes, known to be strong 
antioxidants and to have cancer chemopreventive activities, will add to the 
purported health benefits derived from the consumption of these small fruits.

Tea is a complex mixture containing a range of compounds from simple phenolics 
to complex thearubigins, many of which have well-recognized antioxidant 
properties. This paper describes the application of high-performance liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS(n)) methods for the rapid and routine 
analysis of more than 30 phenolics in tea. Green and black tea infusions were 
injected directly onto a reversed phase HPLC column, and the phenolics eluted 
using two different mobile phase gradients, one optimized to resolve catechin 
derivatives and the other, flavonols and theaflavins. Compounds, identified on 
the basis of their retention time, absorbance spectrum, and MS fragmentation 
pattern, included (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, theaflavin and their various 
gallate derivatives, quercetin and kaempferol mono-, di-, and triglycosides, 
quinic acid esters of gallic acid and hydroxycinnamates, and the purine 
alkaloids, caffeine and theobromine.

BACKGROUND: Proanthocyanidins, the most abundant polyphenols in chocolate, are 
not depolymerized in the stomach and reach the small intestine intact, where 
they are hardly absorbed because of their high molecular weight. In vitro and in 
vivo studies using pure compounds as substrates suggest that proanthocyanidins 
and the related catechin monomers may be degraded into more bioavailable 
low-molecular-weight phenolic acids by the microflora in the colon.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the amounts of phenolic acids 
formed by the microflora and excreted in the urine of human subjects after 
consumption of polyphenol-rich chocolate.
DESIGN: After consumption of a polyphenol-free diet for 2 d and a subsequent 
overnight fast, 11 healthy subjects (7 men and 4 women) consumed 80 g chocolate 
containing 439 mg proanthocyanidins and 147 mg catechin monomers. All urine was 
collected during the 24 h before chocolate consumption and at 3, 6, 9, 24, and 
48 h after chocolate consumption. Aromatic acids were identified in urine by gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry and were quantified by HPLC-electrospray 
ionization tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Chocolate intake increased the urinary excretion of the 6 following 
phenolic acids: m-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, ferulic acid, 
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, m-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, vanillic acid, and 
m-hydroxybenzoic acid.
CONCLUSION: The antioxidant and biological effects of chocolate may be explained 
not solely by the established absorption of catechin monomers but also by the 
absorption of microbial phenolic acid metabolites.

Beers are a source of dietary flavonoids; however, there exist differences in 
composition, alcohol concentration, and beneficial activities. To characterize 
these differences, three kinds of lager beer of habitual consumption in Spain, 
dark, blond, and alcohol-free, were assayed for total phenolic content, 
antioxidant activity, superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities, and 
in vitro inhibitory effect on DNA oxidative damage. Furthermore, their 
melanoidin content and correlation with antioxidant activity were evaluated. 
Dark beer contained the highest total phenolic (489 +/- 52 mg/L) and melanoidin 
(1.49 +/- 0.02 g/L) contents with a 2-fold difference observed when compared to 
the alcohol-free beer. For the three kinds of beer, the antioxidant activity 
measured as N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride concentration was 
strongly correlated with the total polyphenol content (R(2) = 0.91102, p < 
0.005) and with the melanoidin content (R(2) = 0.7999, p < 0.05). The results 
support a positive effect of beers on the protection of DNA oxidative damage, by 
decreasing the deoxyribose degradation, DNA scission (measured by 
electrophoresis), and inhibition of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) formation. 
Furthermore, a correlation between the total melanoidin content (R(2) = 0.7309, 
p < 0.01) and inhibition of 8-OH-dG was observed.

A quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection 
method separating 16 phenolic acids was achieved. Six columns and several mobile 
phases were investigated. Resolution was achieved with a high-purity silica 
Phenomenex Luna C18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm) and a binary gradient 
consisting of CH3OH-water (with 0.1% formic acid) and flow rate set at 0.7 
ml/min. Acids were detected and quantitation performed at wavelength 
representing the lowest energy lambda(max) for individual acids. Extraction 
procedure from wine was optimized and yields ranged from 79 to 87% based on 
internal standard recovery. To confirm our quantitative results, identical 
samples were analyzed both in-house and by a collaborating laboratory. 
Correlation of two data sets generated linear regression equations that 
approached unity (0.93-0.98) and R2 values ranging from 0.990 to 0.999.

The flavonoid composition of immature leaves of pak choi [Brassica rapa L. ssp. 
chinensis L. (Hanelt.)] was investigated. Flavonol aglycone content was measured 
in 11 pak choi varieties, indicating significant differences (P < 0.05) in 
content between varieties and relatively high contents of kaempferol and 
isorhamnetin. Levels of quercetin ranged from 3.2 to 6.1 mg/100 g of dry weight 
(DW), whereas levels of isorhamnetin and kaempferol were significantly higher 
(8.1-35.1 and 36.0-102.6 mg/100 g of DW, respectively). A large number of 
glycoside and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives of quercetin, kaempferol, and 
isorhamnetin were identified in cv. 'Shanghai' by LC/UV-DAD/ESI-MS/MS. The 
UV-DAD data allowed identification of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, but 
detailed MS/MS fragmentations were required for the structure elucidation. Pak 
choi could be a potentially important source of dietary flavonols, in 
particular, kaempferol and isorhamnetin.

A two-level Plackett-Burman design with 8 variables was used to evaluate 
ultrasonic treatment variables influencing the total phenolic content (TPC) 
extracted from asparagus roots. Steepest ascent method was conducted to identify 
the significance of parameters such as extraction temperature, stirring speed, 
intermission time, extraction time, ultrasonic frequency, and ultrasonic power. 
Ethanol and methanol aqueous solutions were used as extraction solvents and 
solvent's concentration, extraction time, ultrasonic power and solid: liquid 
ratio were optimized in this study. A predicted value of TPC (71.1 mg/g) was 
obtained under the optimum conditions of extraction time 120 min, ultrasonic 
power 550 W, ethanol concentration of 20% and a solid: liquid ratio of 1:100. 
Central composite design was employed to further analyse the common interactions 
between the extraction variables and to further determine the optimal values 
that would generate the maximum TPC, total flavonoids content, total saponins 
content, caffeic acid and in vitro antioxidant activities. The optimal variables 
for ethanol extraction (80 min, 50% of ethanol, 360 W and 1:40) generated higher 
than methanol (410 W for 114.9 min using 73.7% methanol at 1:24).

The historical co-production of olive oil and wine has influenced the 
Mediterranean landscape and economy. Olive oil and wine production generates 
substantial organic waste, including olive pomace, grape pomace, and wastewater, 
which poses environmental challenges if untreated. These byproducts contain 
bioactive compounds, including polyphenols, such as hydroxytyrosol, resveratrol, 
and flavonoids, which possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, 
making them valuable for the development of functional foods and nutraceuticals. 
A combined waste valorization strategy can enhance bioactive compound recovery 
and align it with circular economic principles. The incorporation of olive oil 
and wine byproducts into food matrices, such as bread, pasta, dairy products, 
baked goods, chocolates, beverages, and processed items, has been explored to 
enhance antioxidant content, dietary fiber, and nutritional value. However, 
successful integration depends on maintaining acceptable sensory qualities and 
addressing the technical challenges in extraction, processing, and regulatory 
compliance. Realizing the potential benefits of dual valorization requires a 
systemic shift integrating scientific innovation, regulatory adaptability, and 
consumer engagement, guided by evidence, transparent communication, and 
inclusive governance to ensure that sustainability goals translate into 
environmental, economic, and public health outcomes.

Terrestrial green plants are rich in phylloquinone (PK), and their PK content is 
highly correlated with the chlorophyll content. However, there are few studies 
on the PK content of algae and its correlation with chlorophyll content. To 
evaluate the PK content in algae and its correlation with chlorophyll, the PK 
and chlorophyll contents in algae, including Phaeophyta (18 species), Rhodophyta 
(17 species), and Chlorophyta (seven species), were determined. Algae, 
particularly Phaeophyta, contain more functional components than do other green 
terrestrial plants. Therefore, other components such as carotenoids, 
polyphenols, and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging ability 
were analyzed to confirm their correlation with PK. Furthermore, terrestrial 
plants such as leafy vegetables, other vegetables, and tea powder were evaluated 
for the same components and compared with the experimental results for algae. 
This results showed that PK was abundant in Phaeophyta and almost all samples 
contained more than 100 μg/100 g of dry samples. In particular, Sargassum 
muticum contained 514.11±11.29 μg/100 g. However, almost all of the Rhodophyta 
and Chlorophyta contained a little PK. The results also confirmed a positive 
correlation between the PK and chlorophyll content in Rhodophyta (R2=0.7085), 
Chlorophyta (R2=0.7264), and terrestrial plants (R2=0.8436). However, no 
correlation was observed between the PK and chlorophyll content in Phaeophyta 
(R2=0.1013). In addition, the principal component analysis results showed no 
correlation between PK and other components, such as carotenoids and 
polyphenols, and DPPH radical scavenging ability in algae. However, Phaeophyta 
also contained more functional components, such as carotenoids, polyphenols, and 
DPPH radical scavenging ability than the other algal groups.

In this study polyphenolic compounds extracted from olive fruits of five 
registered cultivars were analyzed. A solid-liquid extraction (LSE) procedure 
with Extrelut cartridge (diatomaceous earth) using different eluents was 
developed to obtain polyphenolic compounds. HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS methods were 
applied for the quali-quantitative analysis of each fraction obtained from LSE. 
The results of this work show that the LSE procedure with diatomaceous earth 
cartridge supplies a rapid and reproducible fractioning method able to obtain a 
quantitative recovery of all compounds and to collect fractions directly 
analyzed by HPLC. A comparison among different cultivars shows significant 
quantitative differences in some polyphenols, such as verbascoside, anthocyanic 
compounds, and oleuropein derivatives.

The flavonoid composition of three phenotypes of ""Zolfino"" landraces, a typical 
bean grown in Tuscany, has been elucidated by means of HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS 
analysis. Flavonols, isoflavones, and anthocyanins have been separated and 
determined in the different samples chosen on the basis of their seed coat 
color. A flavonol that has not been previously found in Phaseolus vulgaris L. 
seeds has been characterized. The quantitative data show the presence of 
flavonols (ranging from 709 to 118 mg/kg of fresh weight), isoflavones (ranging 
from 14 to 2 mg/kg of fresh weight), and anthocyanins, in black beans only. 
These results show that this genotype could be very interesting from a 
nutritional point of view.

There is increasing interest in olive polyphenols because of their biological 
properties as well as their contribution to the color, taste, and shelf life of 
olive products. However, some of these compounds remain unidentified. It has 
been shown that hydroxytyrosol 4-beta-D-glucoside 
(4-beta-D-glucosyl-3-hydroxyphenylethanol) coeluted with hydroxytyrosol 
[(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol] under reversed phase conditions in the phenolic 
chromatograms of olive pulp, vegetation water, and pomace of olive oil 
processing. A method to separate this compound from hydroxytyrosol by HPLC has 
been developed. The concentration of this glucoside increased in olive pulp with 
maturation and could be the main phenolic compound in mature olives. In 
contrast, the presence of this compound was not detected in olive oil by using 
HPLC-MS. The compound must be considered both in table olives and olive oil 
processing because of its glucose and hydroxytyrosol contribution to these 
products.

Stilbenes are valuable phenolic compounds that are synthesized in plants via the 
phenylpropanoid pathway where stilbene synthase (STS) directly catalyzes 
resveratrol or pinosylvin formation. Currently, there is a lack of information 
about the stilbene biosynthetic pathway in spruce (Picea). Resveratrol and 
piceatannol derivatives have been detected in the spruce bark, needles, and 
roots. We analyzed seasonal variation in stilbene spectrum and content in the 
needles of different ages of one tree of spruce Picea jezoensis. HPLC analysis 
revealed the presence of nine stilbenes: t- and cis-astringin, t- and 
cis-piceid, t- and cis-isorhapontin, and t-piceatannol were present in amounts 
of 0.01-6.07 mg/g of dry weight (DW), while t-isorhapontigenin and t-resveratrol 
were present in traces (0.001-0.312 μg/g DW). T-astringin prevailed over other 
stilbenoid compounds (66-86% of all stilbenes). The highest total stilbene 
content was detected in one-year-old needles collected in the autumn and spring 
(5.4-7.77 mg/g DW). We previously cloned and sequenced full-length cDNAs of the 
four STS transcripts (PjSTS1a, PjSTS1b, PjSTS2, and PjSTS3) of P. jezoensis. 
This study presents a detailed analysis of seasonal variations in PjSTS1a, 1b, 
2, and 3 transcript levels in the needles of P. jezoensis of different ages 
using qRT-PCR. PjSTS1a and PjSTS1b transcription was higher in the needles 
collected in the autumn, spring, or summer than in the winter. PjSTS2 was 
actively transcribed in the needles of all ages collected in the winter, spring, 
and summer. PjSTS3 expression did not significantly change during the year and 
did not depend on the age of the needles. Therefore, the data show that high 
levels of the stilbene glucosides and PjSTS expression are present in the 
needles of P. jezoensis.

The levels of trans-piceid, cis-piceid, trans-resveratrol, and cis-resveratrol 
have been measured in 36 grape juices using an HPLC system with spectral 
analysis of eluting peaks. The piceid (glucosides) were the major component in 
the grape juices. In red grape juices the average concentrations were 3.38 mg/L 
for trans-piceid, 0.79 mg/L for cis-piceid, 0.50 mg/L for trans-resveratrol, and 
0.06 mg/L for cis-resveratrol. In white grape juices the levels were, on 
average, 0.18 mg/L for trans-piceid, 0.26 mg/L for cis-piceid, and 0.05 mg/L for 
trans-resveratrol, and cis-resveratrol was not detected in any sample. Levels of 
total resveratrol (trans- and cis-resveratrol and -piceid) found in red and in 
white grape juices are similar to those described in Spanish red and white 
wines. Due to their resveratrol content, as well as other phenolics, grape 
juices may have a beneficial health effect of interest to those who cannot drink 
wine.

Human urine was collected over a 24 h period after the consumption of 250 mL of 
(i) water, (ii) orange juice, and (iii) orange juice plus 150 mL of full fat 
natural yoghurt. The orange juice contained 168 micromol of 
hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside and 18 micromol of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside. GC-MS 
analysis of the urine identified nine phenolic acids, five of which, 
3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylhydracrylic acid, dihydroferulic 
acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylhydracrylic acid and 3-hydroxyhippuric acid, were 
associated with orange juice consumption indicating that they were derived from 
colonic catabolism of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside. The overall 0-24 h excretion of 
the five phenolic acids was 6.7 +/- 1.8 micromol after drinking water and this 
increased significantly (p < 0.05) to 62 +/- 18 micromol, equivalent to 37% of 
the ingested flavanones, following orange juice consumption. When the orange 
juice was ingested with yoghurt excretion fell back markedly to 9.3 +/- 4.4 
micromol. This was not due to a difference in mouth to caecum transit time, as 
measured with breath hydrogen production, though possibly there may have been a 
slowing of the bulk of the meal reaching the large intestine which may then have 
altered the catabolism of the flavanones to phenolic acids by the colonic 
microbiota.

Recent research on the bioavailability of flavan-3-ols after ingestion of green 
tea by humans is reviewed. Glucuronide, sulfate, and methyl metabolites of 
(epi)catechin and (epi)gallocatechin glucuronide reach peak nanomolar per liter 
plasma concentrations 1.6-2.3 h after intake, indicating absorption in the small 
intestine. The concentrations then decline, and only trace amounts remain 8 h 
after ingestion. Urinary excretion of metabolites over a 24-h period after green 
tea consumption corresponded to 28.5% of the ingested (epi)catechin and 11.4% of 
(epi)gallocatechin, suggesting higher absorption than that of most other 
flavonoids. The fate of (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate, the main flavan-3-ol in 
green tea, is unclear because it appears unmetabolized in low concentrations in 
plasma but is not excreted in urine. Possible enterohepatic recirculation of 
flavan-3-ols is discussed along with the impact of dose and other food 
components on flavan-3-ol bioavailability. Approximately two-thirds of the 
ingested flavan-3-ols pass from the small to the large intestine where the 
action of the microbiota results in their conversion to C-6-C-5 
phenylvalerolactones and phenylvaleric acids, which undergo side-chain 
shortening to produce C-6-C-1 phenolic and aromatic acids that enter the 
bloodstream and are excreted in urine in amounts equivalent to 36% of 
flavan-3-ol intake. Some of these colon-derived catabolites may have a role in 
vivo in the potential protective effects of tea consumption. Although black tea, 
which contains theaflavins and thearubigins, is widely consumed in the Western 
world, there is surprisingly little research on the absorption and metabolism of 
these compounds after ingestion and their potential impact on health.

Nine commercial brands of grapefruit juice were analyzed for their flavonoid 
content by HPLC to determine if significant brand-to-brand variance in 
grapefruit juice flavonoid content exists. Flavonoid glycosides narirutin, 
naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, didymin, and poncirin have been identified 
in all the grapefruit juices examined. The aglycone quercetin was detected in 
only two brands. All the juices were free from methoxylated flavonoid aglycones. 
There was a significant difference in the amounts of total flavonoids and 
individual flavonoids in the nine brands. The concentration of total flavonoids 
ranged between 19.44 and 84.28 mg/100 ml juice. Naringin was found to be the 
major flavonoid followed by narirutin and hesperidin. Their concentrations 
ranged from 14.56 to 63.8; 2.25 to 12.20; and 0.24 to 3.12 mg/100 ml juice, 
respectively.

For intact kernels, extraction of 1 g samples with ethyl acetate (40 ml, 24 h) is recommended. The ease of extraction is consistent with the presence of alkylresorcinols in the outer layers of the kernel and their absence in the endosperm. The extracts were analysed (without further purification or derivatisation) by gas chromatography using methyl behenate (C22:0, fatty acid methyl ester) as internal standard.

Cádiz, Puerto Real, Cádiz, Spain.

A fast method using high-performance liquid chromatography based on two 
monolithic columns has been developed for the simultaneous determination of 
isoflavones extracted from soybeans and derived foods. The 12 main isoflavones 
were resolved in 10 min in two coupled monolithic columns working at 35 degrees 
C using a elution gradient of acidified water (0.1% acetic acid) and methanol 
(0.1% acetic acid) at a flow rate of 5 mL min(-1). Retention time and relative 
area standard deviations were below 1% for all isoflavones. The method developed 
was successfully applied to several soy food samples and spiked samples. Total 
isoflavone concentration in sampled soy foods ranged from 34.28 mg L(-1) to 4.29 
mg g(-1).

Two new dehydrotriferulic acids and two dehydrotetraferulic acids were isolated 
from saponified maize bran insoluble fiber using size exclusion chromatography 
on Bio-Beads S-X3 followed by Sephadex LH-20 chromatography and semipreparative 
phenyl-hexyl reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography. On the basis 
of UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and one- and two-dimensional NMR 
experiments, the structures were identified as 
8-5(noncyclic)/5-5-dehydrotriferulic acid, 
8-8(tetrahydrofuran)/5-5-dehydrotriferulic acid, and 
4-O-8/5-5/8-O-4-dehydrotetraferulic acid. The second tetramer was tentatively 
identified as 4-O-8/5-5/8-5(noncyclic)-dehydrotetraferulic acid. Compounds 
containing an 8-5(noncyclic)-coupled dimeric unit probably do not exist in 
planta but are formed from their phenylcoumaran precursors containing an 
8-5(cyclic)-coupled dimeric unit during saponification. The presented 
dehydrotrimers are the first dehydrotriferulates that do not contain an 
8-O-4-coupled dimeric unit. The ferulate dehydrotetramers that are reported for 
the first time are presumed, like the dimers and trimers, to cross-link 
polysaccharides in the plant. Because both tetramers contain a 
5-5/8-O-4-dehydrotriferulate moiety, the predominant dehydrotrimer in maize 
bran, it is not possible to deduce whether tetramers are formed by coupling of a 
fourth unit to a preformed dehydrotriferulate or by 5-5-coupling of preformed 
8-O-4- and 8-5-dehydrodiferulates. Nevertheless, such compounds document 
expanded roles for ferulates in cross-linking polysaccharides in plant cell 
walls.

Quantitation of polymethoxylated flavones in orange juice by high-performance 
liquid chromatography.

Rouseff RL, Ting SV.

A quantitative high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedure for the 
determination of the five major polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) in orange juice 
has been developed. It employs a unique ternary solvent system with coupled 
UV-fluorescence detection. The dual detectors were employed to determine the 
presence of interfering substances and served as a cross check on quantitation. 
Stop flow UV and fluorescence scanning was used to identify peaks and determine 
the presence of impurities. Although all five citrus PMFs fluoresce, some HPLC 
fluorescence peaks were too small to be of much practical use. All five citrus 
PMFs could be quantitated satisfactorily with the fixed wavelength UV (313 nm) 
detector. The HPLC procedure has been used to evaluate each step in the 
preparation. The optimum extracting solvent was selected and one time consuming 
step was eliminated, as it was found to be unnecessary. HPLC values for 
nobiletin and sinensetin are in good agreement with the thin-layer 
chromatographic (TLC) values in the literature. HPLC values for the other three 
flavones were considerably lower than those reported in the literature. The HPLC 
procedure is considerably faster than the TLC procedure with equal or superior 
precision and accuracy.

Interindividual variation in metabolism of soy isoflavones and lignans: 
influence of habitual diet on equol production by the gut microflora.

The soy isoflavones, daidzein and genistein, and the lignans, matairesinol and 
secoisolariciresinol, are phytoestrogens metabolized extensively by the 
intestinal microflora. Considerable important evidence is already available that 
shows extensive interindividual variation in isoflavone metabolism, and we have 
investigated the extent of this variation in a crossover study of a 
soy-containing food low or high in isoflavones (each treatment period lasted for 
17 days, and the 2 treatment periods were separated by a 25-day washout period) 
in 24 healthy subjects [19 women and 5 men, mean age 30 yr, range 19-40, mean 
body mass index 22.5 +/- 3.5 (SD) kg/m2]. There was a 16-fold variation in total 
isoflavonoid excretion in urine after the high-isoflavone treatment period. The 
variation in urinary equol excretion was greatest (664-fold), and subjects fell 
into two groups: poor equol excretors and good equol excretors (36%). A 
significant negative correlation was found between the proportion of energy from 
fat in the habitual diet and urinary equol excretion (r = -0.55; p = 0.012). 
Good equol excretors consumed less fat as percentage of energy than poor 
excretors (26 +/- 2.3% compared with 35 +/- 1.6%, p < 0.01) and more 
carbohydrate as percentage of energy than poor excretors (55 +/- 2.9% compared 
with 47 +/- 1.7%, p < 0.05). Interindividual variation in the urinary excretion 
of O-desmethyl-angolensin (O-DMA) was also apparent (76-fold after the 
high-isoflavone treatment period), but there was no relationship between equol 
excretion and O-DMA excretion. Enterolactone was the major lignan metabolite in 
urine and plasma but showed less interindividual variation than equol and O-DMA. 
It is suggested that the dietary fat intake decreases the capacity of gut 
microbial flora to synthesize equol.

Daidzein (DAN) is an isoflavone, and it is often found in its natural form in 
soybean and food supplements. DAN has poor bioavailability owing to its 
extremely low water solubility and first-pass metabolism. Herein, we 
hypothesized that a bioactivatable natural amino acid-bearing carbamate prodrug 
strategy could increase the water solubility and metabolic stability of DAN. To 
test our hypothesis, nine amino acid prodrugs of DAN were designed and 
synthesized. Compared with DAN, the optimal prodrug 
(daidzein-4'-O-CO-N-isoleucine, D-4'-I) demonstrated enhanced water solubility 
and improved phase II metabolic stability and activation to DAN in plasma. In 
addition, unlike the passive transport of DAN, D-4'-I maintained high 
permeability via organic anion-transporting polypeptide 2B1 (OATP2B1)-mediated 
transport. Importantly, D-4'-I increased the oral bioavailability by 15.5-fold, 
reduced the gender difference, and extended the linear absorption capacity in 
the pharmacokinetics of DAN in rats. Furthermore, D-4'-I exhibited 
dose-dependent protection against liver injury. Thus, the natural amino 
acid-bearing carbamate prodrug strategy shows potential in increasing water 
solubility and improving phase II metabolic stability to enhance the oral 
bioavailability of DAN.

Olive fruits are seriously deteriorated by pre and post harvest damage due to 
the attack of insects, such as Bactrocera olaea, which strongly alters the 
quality of olives. Olives from Chemlali cultivar were collected and divided into 
different groups according to the presence or absence of infestation (0%, 5%, 
10%, 15% and 100%) by the olive fruit fly (B. olaea). The infestation of this 
pest has been studied to evaluate its influence on virgin olive oil quality 
(free acidity, K(232) and K(270), fatty acids composition, pigment 
concentration, organoleptic characteristics, phenolic content, and antioxidant 
power). Results showed that both attacks by B. oleae and maturity process 
affected the quantitative and qualitative composition of the oil. These analyses 
demonstrated that the degree of fly attack was positively correlated with free 
acidity, the values of this parameter increase from 0.6 to 1.5 and 3.4, at the 
infestation levels 10%, 15% and 100%, respectively (R(2)=0.7418, P<0.05), and 
negatively related to the phenolic content which was always lower at the 100% 
infestation level (R(2)=0.9155, P<0.05), and consequently, the organoleptic 
characteristics. In addition, the infestation by olive fly did not cause an 
important change in the fatty acid composition while it is clear that fatty 
acids levels change in relation to the fruit repining stage. The antioxidant 
activity decreased during maturation, it was correlated to the total phenol 
content and the fruit infestation level.

This investigation was designed to characterize phenolic metabolism of the olive 
cultivar, Hardy's Mammoth, by examining its constitutive tissues. The phenolic 
profiles of pulp, seed, stone, and new and old season leaves were monitored over 
two fruiting seasons, to investigate possible relationships between tissues and 
phenol content and to determine the impact of alternate fruit bearing. No major 
qualitative differences in phenolic composition were found between the various 
tissues; however, distinct differences between the tissues with respect to 
quantifiable phenols were established. Relationships between 
2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl (3E,4E)-4-formyl-3-(2-oxoethyl)hex-4-enoate ester, 
oleuropein, and hydroxytyrosol in pulp and leaf were identified and found to be 
related to alternate bearing. Concentrations of 5-caffeoylquinic acid in old 
season leaves differed dramatically between seasons, confirming earlier studies.

Arabinoxylans (AXs) are widely distributed in various cereal grains, such as 
wheat, corn, rye, barley, rice, and oat. The AX molecule contains a linear 
(1,4)-β-D-xylp backbone substituted by α-L-araf units and occasionally t-xylp 
and t-glcpA through α-(1,2) and/or α-(1,3) glycosidic linkages. Arabinoxylan 
shows diversified functional and bioactive properties, influenced by their 
molecular mass, branching degree, ferulic acid (FA) content, and the 
substitution position and chain length of the side chains. This Review 
summarizes the extraction methods for various cereal sources, compares their 
structural features and functional/bioactive properties, and highlights the 
established structure-function/bioactivity relationships, intending to explore 
the potential functions of AXs and their industrial applications.

Arctiin, an important lignan compound in Fructus Arctii, has been reported to 
possess various kinds of bioactivities. Previous studies on the pharmacokinetic 
of arctiin after oral administration showed that it had a rapid absorption phase 
followed by a sharp but lasting disappearance. To gain deep insight into the 
action mechanism of arctiin, the excretion and metabolism of arctiin in vivo 
should be further studied. In this paper, three metabolites were isolated and 
identified in rat feces as (-)-enterolactone (M-1), (-)-arctigenin (M-2) and 
[(2R,3R)-2-(3'-hydroxybenzyl)-3-(3″,4″-dimethoxybenzyl)-butyrolactone] (M-3). 
Based on the structures of three metabolites, possible metabolic pathways of 
arctiin in rats are proposed. At the same time, the cumulative excretion rate of 
arctiin and its metabolites in rat urine and feces were determined, indicating 
that arctiin was excreted 19.84% in urine and 1.80% in feces, respectively, 
enterolactone, the most main metabolite, was excreted 35.80% in feces. These 
results provide very important information for understanding the metabolism and 
excretion of arctiin in vivo and speculating its action mechanism, they can 
provide useful information and reference for further metabolic investigations on 
arctiin in humans.

Epidemiological studies in humans have suggested that tomato consumption and the 
compositional ratios of Prevotella, Megamonas, and Streptococcus in the 
intestinal microbiota are related to intestinal permeability. In this study, we 
investigated the causal relationship using Caenorhabditis (C.) elegans. We 
cultured Escherichia coli OP50 (the standard C. elegans food), Prevotella (P.) 
copri JCM 13464T, Megamonas funiformis JCM 14723T, and Streptococcus salivarius 
JCM 5707T in either normal medium or medium containing 1% (v/v) tomato juice (TJ 
medium), fed these bacteria to C. elegans for three days, and evaluated 
intestinal permeability using the Smurf assay. The proportion of Smurf 
individuals was significantly lower in C. elegans fed P. copri cultured in TJ 
medium than in those fed the same bacteria cultured in normal medium, while 
other strains showed no such medium-dependent differences. Interestingly, 
heat-killed P. copri grown in normal medium also reduced the proportion of Smurf 
individuals. Furthermore, P. copri grown in TJ medium exhibited a lower survival 
rate after seeding on nematode growth medium, an effect not observed in other 
strains. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed that 
P. copri cultured in TJ medium accumulated L-(-)-3-phenyllactic acid 
(L-(-)-3-PLA), a compound known for its antibacterial properties through 
oxidative stress and its protective effects on the intestinal barrier. In 
contrast, the levels of known antioxidants such as 
2,3,4,9-tetrahydro-1H-β-carboline-3-carboxylic acid and 
Cyclo(phenylalanyl-prolyl) were decreased. Culturing P. copri in normal medium 
supplemented with L-(-)-3-PLA alone did not reduce survival, suggesting that 
both L-(-)-3-PLA accumulation and the depletion of antioxidants contribute to 
reduced viability. Additionally, L-(-)-3-PLA directly suppressed intestinal 
permeability in C. elegans. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest 
that TJ may inhibit increased intestinal permeability through both rendering P. 
copri vulnerable and the direct effects of L-(-)-3-PLA. Further studies are 
needed to determine the relevance of these findings to humans.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the metabolic responses of wheat to drought stress is 
essential for developing strategies to enhance its resilience under 
water-deficit conditions. In this study, we investigated the metabolic and 
phenotypic responses of twelve Nordic spring wheat genotypes subjected to 
drought stress over 28 days in a high-throughput phenotyping facility. By 
integrating metabolic profiling with phenotypic assessments, we aimed to 
identify key metabolites and traits associated with drought tolerance.
RESULTS: We identified nearly 200 metabolites that were differentially 
accumulated across four time points, including early drought and recovery 
phases. Of these, 25% were organic acids, 16.2% sugars and derivatives, 16.2% 
amino acids and derivatives, and 10.4% alkaloids, while the rest were mainly 
lipids, nucleotides and derivatives, and phenolic acids. Furthermore, 32 
metabolites showed significant correlations with 17 phenotypic traits, 
highlighting potential biomarkers for drought tolerance. These metabolic markers 
could be utilized in screening programs to accelerate the breeding of 
drought-resilient spring wheat. Our findings suggest that metabolomic changes 
during drought stress and recovery involve critical pathways linked to 
osmoprotection, antioxidant activity, and energy metabolism, which differentiate 
tolerant from non-tolerant genotypes.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining metabolomics 
with high-throughput phenotyping to dissect plant stress responses. By 
identifying key metabolic pathways and potential biomarkers for drought 
tolerance, our findings provide a valuable foundation for breeding 
climate-resilient wheat varieties. Moreover, this integrative approach enhances 
our understanding of plant adaptation to abiotic stress, contributing to future 
efforts in sustainable agriculture and food security.

Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a naturally occurring 
polyphenol with cancer chemopreventive properties in preclinical models of 
carcinogenesis, including those of colorectal cancer. Recently, a variety of 
analogues of resveratrol have been synthesised and investigated in in vitro 
assays. One analogue, 3,4,5,4'-tetramethoxystilbene (DMU 212), showed 
preferential growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic properties in transformed cells, 
when compared with their untransformed counterparts. As part of a 
chemoprevention drug development programme, the pharmacokinetic properties of 
DMU 212 were compared with those of resveratrol in the plasma, liver, kidney, 
lung, heart, brain and small intestinal and colonic mucosa of mice. DMU 212 or 
resveratrol (240 mg kg(-1)) were administered intragastrically, and drug 
concentrations were measured by HPLC. Metabolites were characterised by 
cochromatography with authentic reference compounds and were identified by mass 
spectrometry. The ratios of area of plasma or tissue concentration vs time 
curves of resveratrol over DMU 212 (AUC(res)/AUC(DMU212)) for the plasma, liver, 
small intestinal and colonic mucosa were 3.5, 5, 0.1 and 0.15, respectively. 
Thus, resveratrol afforded significantly higher levels than DMU 212 in the 
plasma and liver, while DMU 212 exhibited superior availability compared to 
resveratrol in the small intestine and colon. Resveratrol was metabolised to its 
sulphate or glucuronate conjugates, while DMU 212 underwent metabolic 
hydroxylation or single and double O-demethylation. DMU 212 and resveratrol 
inhibited the growth of human-derived colon cancer cells HCA-7 and HT-29 in 
vitro with IC(50) values of between 6 and 26 microM. In the light of the 
superior levels achieved in the gastrointestinal tract after the administration 
of DMU 212, when compared to resveratrol, the results provide a good rationale 
to evaluate DMU 212 as a colorectal cancer chemopreventive agent.

In this study, five different black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. Tolosa) 
populations cultivated in different geographical areas including Oiartzun, 
Andoain, Azkoitia, San Esteban and Amasa Villabona, were studied and their 
polyphenolic content was determined. Two food products were prepared from the 
five different bean populations, cooked ""Tolosa"" beans and a hummus made with 
""Tolosa"" cooked beans. Moreover, the variations of total polyphenol content 
(TPC), total anthocyanin content (TAC) and free radical scavenging activity by 
the 1,1-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method were analyzed for raw beans, 
cooked beans, and ""Tolosa"" beans hummus. Polyphenolic detailed composition was 
determined by means of HPLC-MS-QTOF analysis. The ""Tolosa"" bean population 
richest in polyphenols was selected in order to study the effect of in vitro 
digestion on the polyphenolic content and antioxidant effect and the degradation 
of the main anthocyanins was followed during the in vitro digestion. Finally, 
the effect of the different phases of digestion on the cytotoxicity in Caco-2 
cells was determined. The results suggest that cooking ""Tolosa"" black beans 
results in an increase in the bioaccessibility of polyphenols and their 
antioxidant activity, which, additionally has a positive effect on Caco-2 
intestinal cell viability.

This study aimed to assess the impact of roasting degree on antioxidant and 
metabolic parameters in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, we evaluated radical 
scavenging, lipid peroxidation, and the activity of digestive enzymes 
(α-glucosidase, α-amylase, and lipase). In vivo, we first examined coffee's 
effect on carbohydrate and lipid absorption in healthy rats, followed by a 
chronic evaluation of metabolic disorders and antioxidant markers using a 
diet-induced obesity model. In vitro results revealed that increased roasting 
degree reduced the antioxidant capacity of coffee brews. All brews showed lower 
inhibition of α-glucosidase and α-amylase, and lipase inhibition compared to the 
positive control (acarbose or orlistat). In vivo, all roasting degrees 
consistently reduced postprandial glucose levels by 20%. Notably, coffee with a 
high roasting degree (HRD) decreased serum triglycerides (TG) by ∼44% after a 
lipid load, while other roasts did not. Chronic administration of unroasted (UN) 
or HRD coffee significantly reduced weight gain compared to the obese control 
(∼15% and ∼10%, respectively). Notably, all coffee samples improved lipid 
metabolism parameters. UN and HRD coffee significantly decreased adipocyte 
volume by 58% and 48%, respectively, compared to the obese control. 
Additionally, all groups exhibited less than 30% hepatic lipid droplets 
independent of roasting degree. HRD treatment notably increased liver catalase 
(CAT) activity and reduced lipid peroxidation in serum (∼90%), liver (∼59%), and 
adipose tissue (∼37%) compared to the obese control group. These findings 
suggest that HRD in coffee may confer certain biological advantages.

Resveratrol has been associated with reduced cardiovascular disease and reduced 
cancer risk. This phytoalexin has been reported in a number of plant species, 
including grapes, and may be one of the compounds responsible for the health 
benefits of red wine. Analytical methods for measuring resveratrol in wine and 
peanuts were adapted to isolate, identify, and quantify resveratrol in several 
cultivars of peanuts. Aqueous ethanol (80% v/v) extracts from peanuts without 
seed coats were purified over alumina/silica gel columns and analyzed by 
reversed phase HPLC using a C-18 column. Peanuts from each market type, 
Virginia, runner, and Spanish, produced in four different locations contained 
from 0.03 to 0.14 microg of resveratrol/g. Seed coats from runner and Virginia 
types contained approximately 0.65 microg/g of seed coat, which is equivalent to 
<0.04 microg/seed. Quantitative analysis of 15 cultivars representing 3 peanut 
market types, which had been cold stored for up to 3 years, indicated a range of 
0.02-1.79 microg/g of peanut compared to 0.6-8.0 microg/mL in red wines.

Tea is rich in polyphenols and has a variety of biological activities. In order 
to better understand the biological effects of tea constituents on human health, 
markers for their exposure and their metabolic fates are needed. Previously, we 
have characterized several catechin metabolites in the blood and urine, but more 
information on the metabolite profile of tea polyphenols is needed. In the 
present study, the human urinary metabolite profile of tea polyphenols was 
investigated using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass 
spectrometry with data-dependent acquisition. With data-dependent MS/MS analysis 
by collecting the MS2 and MS3 spectra of the most intense ions in the sample, we 
identified more than twenty metabolites of tea polyphenols from human urine 
samples. (-)-Epigallocatechin (EGC) glucuronide, methylated EGC glucuronide, 
methylated EGC sulfate, (-)-epicatechin (EC) glucruronide, EC sulfate, 
methylated EC sulfate, as well as the glucuronide and sulfate metabolites of the 
ring-fission metabolites of tea catechins, 
5-(3',4',5'-trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4), 
5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6) and 
5-(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6'), were the major human 
urinary metabolites of tea polyphenols. To our knowledge, this is the first 
report of the direct simultaneous analysis of the human urinary metabolite 
profile of tea polyphenols using single sample analysis. This method can also be 
used for thorough investigations of the metabolite profiles of many other 
dietary constituents.

(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant and most biologically 
active polyphenolic compound in tea, has been proposed to have many health 
beneficial effects. The metabolic fate of EGCG, however, is not well understood. 
In the present study, we identified a novel EGCG metabolite, 
7-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-EGCG-4''-O-beta-D-glucupyranoside, in a mouse urine 
sample using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass 
spectrometry. The structure of this metabolite was confirmed by analyzing the 
MSn (n = 1-4) spectra as well as comparing the MS/MS spectra of its product ions 
with those from EGCG and EGCG-4''-O-beta-D-glucupyranoside standards. To our 
knowledge, this is the first report of the identification of a glucoside 
metabolite of EGCG in mammals. Our results indicate that glucosidation 
represents a novel pathway in the metabolism of EGCG in mice.

The cortex of 14 French apple varieties (12 cider and 2 juice varieties), one 
English cider variety, and one dessert apple (i.e., Golden Delicious) were 
studied for their polyphenol composition. Total polyphenols were assayed by the 
Folin-Ciocalteu method, and the precise polyphenolic composition (monomeric 
catechins, proanthocyanidins, hydroxycinnamic acids, and dihydrochalcones) was 
obtained by HPLC following thiolysis. ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS analyses showed that 
chlorogenic acid and p-coumaroylquinic acid were methylated under the conditions 
of thiolysis. Depending on the variety, the global polyphenol concentration 
varied from 1 to 7 g per kilogram of fresh cortex. Cider varieties globally 
showed a higher polyphenol concentration than the dessert apple Golden 
Delicious, bitter varieties being the more concentrated. The proportion of the 
polyphenol classes varied greatly from one cultivar to another. For all 
varieties, procyanidins were always the predominant class. They were mainly 
constituted of (-)-epicatechin units with a small proportion of (+)-catechin as 
a terminal unit. The average degree of polymerization ranged between 4.2 and 7.5 
depending upon the variety with an exception for the sharp varieties Guillevic 
and Avrolles which showed significant concentrations of procyanidins with DPn of 
40 and 50, respectively.

Protein quality remains a key nutritional challenge in plant-based yoghurt 
alternatives (PBYA), often limited by suboptimal amino acid profiles, 
antinutritional factors, and low protein digestibility. Therefore, this study 
aimed to evaluate protein quality, assessed via the in vitro protein 
digestibility corrected amino acid score (ivPDCAAS), of an oat-pea blended PBYA 
alongside textural properties and acidification behaviour. Following 
pasteurisation using pulsed electric fields technology, samples were subjected 
to a yoghurt fermentation (8 h at 35 °C) with selected probiotic organisms, 
Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v (Lp299v) and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei 
431, alongside a conventional yoghurt culture, YF-L812 (Yo-flex), and a 
bioprotective starter culture, Bioprox RP80. Results revealed that a 
nutritionally complete amino acid profile, meeting FAO requirements, could be 
achieved by combining oat and pea materials. PEF treatments at 10 kV cm-1 and 
213 kJ L-1 with preheating (45 °C, 22 s) followed by lactic acid fermentation 
achieved an overall mild improvement in protein digestibility by up to 17%, 
linked to a partial degradation of antinutritional factors (phytic acid by 18% 
and trypsin inhibitor by 17%). This increased the nutritonal protein quality of 
the PBYA by up to 14%, dependant on the amino acid metabolism of the selected 
probiotic starter cultures, which included a slight (11-17%) reduction in 
sulphur amino acids (cysteine, methyonine). Additionly, the probiotic Lp299v 
achieved a faster acidification and firmer yoghurt texture compared to a 
conventional yoghurt culture (Yo-flex), while the co-culture Bioprox RP80, 
containing Lp. plantarum and Lc. rhamnosus, proved equally suitable. These 
findings underscore the potential of alternative starter cultures, utilising 
probiotic species such as Lp. plantarum with a versatile metabolic profile to 
achieve an efficient acidification and suitable textural properties of PBYA 
without adversely affecting protein quality indices. Moreover, the integration 
of PEF as an alternative pasteurisation method benefits the preparation of PBYA 
by minimising the degradation of amino acids while partially reducing 
antinutritients. The applied technologies are scalable for industrial use. As 
such, this research supports future innovations in commercial PBYA applications 
by providing key insights into the influence of PEF and fermentation on protein 
nutritional quality.

The presence of resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) and its beta-glucoside, 
piceid (resveratrol-3-beta-D-glucopyranoside), together with their isomers in 
wine appears to be one of the beneficial factors conferring a protective effect 
against cardiovascular disease through red wine ingestion. A total of 42 red and 
white wines was collected in areas from Hokkaido to Kyushu in Japan. The wines 
were fractionated with a C18 Sep-pak cartridge, and the active principles were 
eluted with ethyl acetate. Crude trans- and cis-piceid were extracted from a 
Chinese medicine, 'Kojohkon' (Polygonum cuspidatum), and their retention times 
and UV absorption were confirmed by HPLC. trans- and cis-Resveratrol, and trans- 
and cis-piceid were analyzed in a short C18 HPLC column, and cis-resveratrol was 
quantified from the amount of cis-isomer converted from authentic 
trans-resveratrol that had been treated by UV irradiation. The content of piceid 
is shown as the resveratrol equivalent. The average content of total stilbene 
compounds was 4.37 mg/liter in red wines, while only 0.68 mg/liter in white 
wines. Red wines made from Pinot noir, Merlot, and Zweigeltrebe grapes all had a 
high resveratrol content.

The objective of this study was to determine whether incorporation of blueberries into food products affects their phenolic content or antioxidant and antiproliferation activity. Several blueberry fruit‐containing products including fresh, individually quick frozen (IQF), freeze‐dried, spray‐dried, heat‐dried, cooked, juice concentrate, pie filling, and jam were fractionated to remove sugars and isolate groups of phytochemicals based on solubility. The fractions were analyzed for total phenolics and assayed for ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) antioxidant activity, 2,2‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, and hepa‐1c1c7 antiproliferative activities. For both cultivated and wild berries, fresh and IQF berries had the highest total phenols, antioxidant activity, and antiproliferation activity. Whole freeze‐dried wild blueberries also retained significant antiproliferative activity in 2 fractions eluted with acetone (fraction 4, 4% of control cell growth at 20 (μg/mL) and 50% aqueous acetone (fraction 5, 69% of control cell growth at 20 (μg/mL) and ranked close to the activities recorded for fresh (30% of control cell growth at 20 (μg/mL for fraction 5) and IQF whole fruit (27% of control cell growth at 20 (μg/mL for fraction 5). Products that were heat‐processed retained most of the antioxidant activity and total phenolics found in unprocessed whole fruit. However, the heat‐treated products lacked or had diminished antiproliferation activity, suggesting that although products may be high in phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity, some forms of bioactivity may be compromised by harsh processing methods.

Vitisin A was prepared from malvidin 3-glucoside and pyruvic acid in model wine 
medium, isolated by countercurrent chromatography, and purified by preparative 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The synthesized compound was used 
as a reference standard to quantify vitisin A in Chilean wines from Vitis 
vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, including a vertical row of wines from the same 
vineyard over 16 years. Maximum vitisin A content was reached within the first 
year of storage. Importantly, up to half of the initial amount of vitisin A in 
young wines was still present in 15 year old wines. Although vitisin A was found 
to be much more stable as compared to other monomeric C-4 underivatized 
anthocyanins, it also slowly degrades after reaching its peak concentration. The 
""color activity concept"" was applied to vitisin A, malvidin 3-glucoside, 
malvidin 3-(6' '-acetylglucoside), and polymeric pigments isolated by 
countercurrent chromatography in order to estimate their contribution toward the 
overall color expression of wines. It was found that vitisin A is only a minor 
contributor to the visually perceived color of aged red wines (color 
contribution approximately 5%). The major contributor is the polymeric fraction 
(color contribution approximately 70-90%).

Pinotage red wines were found to contain a reaction product of malvidin 
3-glucoside and caffeic acid, the so-called pinotin A. A total of 50 Pinotage 
wines from the vintages 1996-2002 were analyzed for the content of pinotin A, 
malvidin 3-glucoside, caffeic acid, and caftaric acid. Statistical analyses were 
performed to reveal variations in the content of these compounds and to 
determine the factors that influence pinotin A formation during wine aging. An 
exponential increase of the concentration of this aging product was observed 
with prolonged storage time. The most rapid synthesis of pinotin A was observed 
in 2.5-4 year old wines, although at this age malvidin 3-glucoside is already 
degraded to a large extent. This phenomenon is explained by the increased ratio 
of caffeic acid/malvidin 3-glucoside, which strongly favors the formation of 
pinotin A and makes side reactions less likely. Pinotin A formation proceeds as 
long as a certain level of malvidin 3-glucoside is maintained in the wines. In 
wines >5-6 years old degradation or polymerization of pinotin A finally exceeds 
the rate of its de novo synthesis.

Pistachio shells split naturally prior to maturity leading to their unique 
crack-shell form. Within 24 h of harvest, hull-trapped moisture may cause shell 
staining. The illegal process of bleaching has been used to restore a desirable 
white color to pistachio shells. It is not known whether bleaching adversely 
affects phytochemical levels in pistachios. Therefore, we identified for the 
first time multiple pistachio skin phenolics as quercetin (14.9 microg/g), 
luteolin (10.0 microg/g), eriodictyol (10.2 microg/g), rutin (1.6 microg/g), 
naringenin (1.2 microg/g), apigenin (0.2 microg/g), and the anthocyanins, 
cyanidin-3-galactoside (696 microg/g) and cyanidin-3-glucoside (209 microg/g). 
We investigated the effects of bleaching (0.1-50% hydrogen peroxide) on phenolic 
levels and antioxidative capacities in raw and roasted nuts. Because of their 
flavylium cation structures, anthocyanins were the most sensitive to bleaching. 
Bleaching decreased total anthocyanin levels [mug/g of skins (% hydrogen 
peroxide)]: 905 and 549 (0%); 653 and 145 (0.1%); 111 and 18.4 (5%); 6.1 and 3.2 
(25%); 0 and 0 (50%) for raw and roasted nuts, respectively. Bleaching also 
reduced antioxidative capacity [microM/g of Trolox (% hydrogen peroxide)]: 945 
and 725 (0%); 940 and 472 (0.1%); 930 and 455 (5%); 433 and 370 (25%); 189 and 
173 (50%), for raw and roasted nuts, respectively. Raw nuts preserved phenolic 
levels and antioxidant capacity better than roasted nuts, suggesting 
contributing effects of other substances and/or matrix effects that are 
destroyed by the roasting process. The destruction of bioactive phenolics in 
pistachio skins may negatively impact the potential health benefits arising from 
pistachio consumption.

The present study investigated the effect of pomegranate extract (POMx) and 
pomegranate juice (POM juice) on the growth of major groups of intestinal 
bacteria: Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides fragilis group, clostridia, 
bifidobacteria, and lactobacilli, and the utilization of pomegranate polyphenols 
by Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. The total phenolic content of the 
pomegranate extract and juice was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteau 
colorimetric method and reported as gallic acid equivalent (GAE). The polyphenol 
composition was determined by HPLC. Stool specimens were incubated with 400, 
100, and 25 μg/ml GAE POMx and POM juice and subjected to selective culture. 
Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains were incubated with 400 μg/ml GAE POMx 
and POM juice and metabolites were analyzed. POMx and POM juice increased the 
mean counts of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and significantly inhibited the 
growth of B. fragilis group, clostridia, and Enterobacteriaceae in a 
dose-response manner. Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus utilized ellagic acid 
and glycosyl ellagic acid but little or no punicalin was utilized. Neither POMx 
nor POM juice was converted to urolithins by the test bacteria or the in vitro 
stool cultures. The effect of pomegranate on the gut bacteria considered to be 
beneficial (Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus) suggests that pomegranate may 
potentially work as a prebiotic. The concept that polyphenols such as those in 
pomegranate impact gut microbiota populations may establish a new role for 
polyphenols in human health.

Our group has shown in a phase II clinical trial that pomegranate juice (PJ) 
increases prostate specific antigen (PSA) doubling time in prostate cancer (CaP) 
patients with a rising PSA. Ellagitannins (ETs) are the most abundant 
polyphenols present in PJ and contribute greatly towards its reported biological 
properties. On consumption, ETs hydrolyze to release ellagic acid (EA), which is 
then converted by gut microflora to 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b, d]pyran-6-one 
(urolithin A, UA) derivatives. Despite the accumulating knowledge of ET 
metabolism in animals and humans, there is no available data on the 
pharmacokinetics and tissue disposition of urolithins. Using a standardized 
ET-enriched pomegranate extract (PE), we sought to further define the metabolism 
and tissue distribution of ET metabolites. PE and UA (synthesized in our 
laboratory) were administered to C57BL/6 wild-type male mice, and metabolite 
levels in plasma and tissues were determined over 24 h. ET metabolites were 
concentrated at higher levels in mouse prostate, colon, and intestinal tissues 
as compared to other tissues after administration of PE or UA. We also evaluated 
the effects of PE on CaP growth in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice 
injected subcutaneously with human CaP cells (LAPC-4). PE significantly 
inhibited LAPC-4 xenograft growth in SCID mice as compared to vehicle control. 
Finally, EA and several synthesized urolithins were shown to inhibit the growth 
of human CaP cells in vitro. The chemopreventive potential of pomegranate ETs 
and localization of their bioactive metabolites in mouse prostate tissue suggest 
that pomegranate may play a role in CaP treatment and chemoprevention. This 
warrants future human tissue bioavailability studies and further clinical 
studies in men with CaP.

The effects of Trametes hirsuta laccase and Pentopan Mono BG xylanase and their 
combination on oat, wheat, and mixed oat-wheat doughs and the corresponding 
breads were investigated. Laccase treatment decreased the content of 
water-extractable arabinoxylan (WEAX) in oat dough due to oxidative 
cross-linking of feruloylated arabinoxylans. Laccase treatment also increased 
the proportion of water-soluble polysaccharides (WSNSP) apparently due to the 
beta-glucanase side activity present in the laccase preparation. As a result of 
the laccase treatment, the firmness of fresh oat bread was increased. Xylanase 
treatment doubled the content of WEAX in oat dough and slightly increased the 
amount of WSNSP. Increased stiffness of the dough and firmness of the fresh 
bread were detected, probably because of the increased WEAX content, which 
decreased the amount of water available for beta-glucan. The combination of 
laccase and xylanase produced slight hydrolysis of beta-glucan by the 
beta-glucanase side activity of laccase and enhanced the availability of AX for 
xylanase with concomitant reduction of the amount and molar mass of WSNSP. 
Subsequently, the volume of oat bread was increased. Laccase treatment tightened 
wheat dough, probably due to cross-linking of WEAX to higher molecular weight. 
In oat-wheat dough, laccase slightly increased the proportion of WSNSP between 
medium to low molecular weight and increased the specific volume of the bread. 
Xylanase increased the contents of WEAX and WSNSP between medium to low 
molecular weight in oat-wheat dough, which increased the softness of the dough, 
as well as the specific volume and softness of the bread. The results thus 
indicate that a combination of laccase and xylanase was beneficial for the

Vidalia onion varieties Nirvana, DPS 1032, Yellow 2025, King-Midas, and SBO 133 
grown at Vidalia, Georgia, were analyzed for flavonoid content. A 
high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with photodiode array 
detection was used for quantification. Compounds were analyzed as aglycons after 
acid hydrolysis with 1.2 M HCl. Identification of each compound was based on 
comparison of its retention time and UV spectra with those of pure commercial 
standards. Three major flavonoids, kaempferol, myricetin, and quercetin, were 
identified and quantified. Quercetin was the major flavonoid (7.70-46.32 mg/100 
g fresh weight, FW) present in all varieties, followed by myricetin (2.77-4.13 
mg/100 g FW). Minor quantities of kaempferol (1.10-1.98 mg/100 g FW) were also 
detected. The total polyphenols and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity 
(TEAC) ranged from 73.33 to 180.84 mg/100 g FW and 0.92-1.56 microM TEAC/g FW, 
respectively. A positive but weaker correlation was obtained for total 
polyphenols versus antioxidant capacity. Nevertheless, a stronger correlation 
(r(2) = 0.34) was obtained between flavonoid content versus antioxidant 
capacity. The data indicate that Vidalia onions are a rich source of quercetin, 
and they also contain myricetin and kaempferol.

Blueberries and blackberries grown at various locations in Georgia were 
collected and analyzed for flavonoids, total anthocyanins, total polyphenols, 
and Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). Each sample was analyzed for 
phenolic acids (gallic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, 
and ellagic acid) and flavonoids (catechin, epicatechin, myricetin, quercetin, 
and kaempferol). A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with 
photodiode array detection was used for analysis. Compounds were analyzed as 
aglycons after acid hydrolysis with 1.2 M HCl. Identification of each compound 
was based on retention time and UV spectra by comparison with pure commercial 
standards. Phenolic acids ranged from 0.19 to 258.90 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW), 
and flavonoids ranged from 2.50 to 387.48 mg/100 g FW. Total polyphenols ranged 
from 261.95 to 929.62 mg/100 g FW, and total anthocyanins ranged from 12.70 to 
197.34 mg/100 g FW. TEAC values varied from 8.11 to a maximum of 38.29 microM/g 
FW. A linear relationship was observed between TEAC values and total polyphenols 
or total anthocyanins. The data indicate that blueberries and blackberries are 
rich sources of antioxidants.

Hydrophilic phenols are the most abundant natural antioxidants of virgin olive 
oil (VOO), in which tocopherols and carotenes are also present. The prevalent 
classes of hydrophilic phenols found in VOO are phenyl alcohols, phenolic acids, 
secoiridoids such as the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid 
linked to (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol or (p-hydroxypheny1)ethanol 
(3,4-DHPEA-EDA or p-HPEA-EDA) and an isomer of the oleuropein aglycon 
(3,4-DHPEA-EA), lignans such as (+)-1-acetoxypinoresinol and (+)-pinoresinol, 
and flavonoids. A new method for the analysis of VOO hydrophilic phenols by 
direct injection in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with the use 
of a fluorescence detector (FLD) has been proposed and compared with the 
traditional liquid-liquid extraction technique followed by the HPLC analysis 
utilizing a diode array detector (DAD) and a FLD. Results show that the most 
important classes of phenolic compounds occurring in VOO can be evaluated using 
HPLC direct injection. The efficiency of the new method, as compared to the 
liquid-liquid extraction, was higher to quantify phenyl alcohols, lignans, and 
3,4-DHPEA-EA and lower for the evaluation of 3,4-DHPEA-EDA and p-HPEA-EDA.

The effects of different types and content of polyphenol addition on the 
structure, cooking, antioxidant characteristics and in vitro starch 
digestibility of extruded buckwheat noodles were investigated in this study. The 
result showed epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) was more easily combined with 
starch to form complex than caffeic acid, and amylose tended to be combined with 
polyphenols to form more complex. Amylose had a protective effect on polyphenols 
during extrusion process, which led to a significant increase of polyphenol 
content and antioxidant activity of extruded noodles. The addition of polyphenol 
and high amylose corn starch (HACS) improved the cooking quality of extruded 
buckwheat noodles. The extruded buckwheat noodles with 20 % HACS and 1 % EGCG 
had the lowest cooking loss of 6.08 %. The addition of EGCG and HACS increased 
the content of resistant starch and reduced predicted glycemic index (pGI). The 
noodles with 20 % HACS and 3 % EGCG had the lowest pGI (63.38) and the highest 
resistant starch (RS) content (61.60 %). This study provides a theoretical basis 
for the development of low pGI extruded buckwheat noodles.

Freshly extracted juice from two different varieties of an under-utilized fruit 
(Syzygium malaccense) was subjected to various non-thermal treatments, such as 
ultrasonication (5 and 10 min at 50% amplitude with 30 s pulse lap time) and 
ozonation (0.1 ppm for 20 min), along with the standard heat treatment 
(85 °C/10 min). Various treatment's effect on the microbiological, 
physicochemical, and bioactive constituents of the juice were studied throughout 
storage (28 days at 4 °C). Ultrasonication treatment enhanced the bioactive 
components retention, and higher vitamin C, TPC, DPPH, and ABTS radical 
scavenging activities were observed in ultrasonicated (5 min) juices compared to 
others. The ozone treatment showed deleterious effects on wax apple juice, 
reducing TPC, vitamin C, and flavonoids. Organic acid profiling revealed 
ascorbic, malic, fumaric, and tartaric acids; major phenolic compounds included 
catechin, rutin, syringic, vanillic, protocatechuic, gallic, and rosmarinic 
acids in the fruit juice. Pearson correlation coefficient highlighted positive 
correlations between these compounds and antioxidant activity in both juices. 
The present study addresses the scarcity of information on wax apple juice 
constituents, highlighting its rich organic acids and phenolics content. The 
results showed that ultrasonication (5 min) treatment emerged as an alternative 
to thermal treatment, preserving bioactive compounds in wax apple juice.

An off-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) and ultra-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and 
validated for determining procyanidins, catechin, epicatechin, dimer, and trimer 
in plasma samples. In the validation procedure of the analytical method, 
linearity, precision, accuracy, detection limits (LODs), quantification limits 
(LOQs), and the matrix effect were studied. Recoveries of the procyanidins were 
higher than 84%, except for the trimer, which was 65%. The LODs and LOQs were 
lower than 0.003 and 0.01 microM, respectively, for all the procyanidins 
studied, except for the trimers, which were 0.8 and 0.98 microM, respectively. 
This methodology was then applied for the analysis of rat plasma obtained 2h 
after ingestion of grape seed phenolic extract. Monomers (catechin and 
epicatechin), dimer and trimer in their native form were detected and quantified 
in plasma samples, and their concentration ranged from 0.85 to 8.55 microM. 
Moreover, several metabolites, such as catechin and epicatechin glucuronide, 
catechin and epicatechin methyl glucuronide, and catechin and epicatechin 
methyl-sulphate were identified. These conjugated forms were quantified, in 
reference to the respective unconjugated form, showing concentrations between 
0.06 and 23.90 microM.

Quercetin (QUE), a flavonoid widely found in vegetables and fruits, is primarily 
metabolized through phase II conjugation pathways and circulates as various 
conjugates. We previously showed that QUE and its metabolites are transferred to 
neonatal mice via breast milk. However, as the dams in that study ingested QUE 
during pregnancy, placental transfer may also had occurred. Thus, this study 
aimed to investigate the placental transfer of QUE and its metabolites by 
quantifying their concentrations before parturition. ICR mice were fed a 
standard AIN-93G diet and mated, with gestational day 0 defined as the day of 
mating. On gestational day 14, the diet was switched to 1 % (w/w) 
QUE-supplemented AIN-93G. On gestational day 17, blood, liver, and placenta 
samples were collected from pregnant dams and fetuses. QUE and its metabolites 
were quantified using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with 
quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. QUE and its metabolites were 
detected in the placenta and maternal liver, as well as in the fetal liver. The 
proportions of heteroconjugates (e.g., quercetin glucuronide sulfate and 
isorhamnetin glucuronide sulfate) in the placenta (59 %) and fetal liver (43 %) 
were lower than in maternal plasma (94 %). In contrast, monoconjugates (e.g., 
quercetin glucuronide, quercetin sulfate) and particularly free QUE were 
relatively abundant in both placenta and fetal liver. These findings suggest 
that heteroconjugates from maternal blood may be deconjugated in the placenta. 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively analyze the 
placental transfer of QUE and its metabolites to fetuses in pregnant mice.

BACKGROUND: The nonsteroidal estrogen equol occurs as diastereoisomers, 
S-(-)equol and R-(+)equol, both of which have significant biological actions. 
S-(-)equol, the naturally occurring enantiomer produced by 20-30% of adults 
consuming soy foods, has selective affinity for estrogen receptor-beta, whereas 
both enantiomers modulate androgen action. Little is known about the 
pharmacokinetics of the diastereoisomers, despite current interest in developing 
equol as a nutraceutical or pharmaceutical agent.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare the pharmacokinetics of S-(-)equol and 
R-(+)equol by using [13C] stable-isotope-labeled tracers to facilitate the 
optimization of clinical studies aimed at evaluating the potential of these 
diastereoisomers in the prevention and treatment of estrogen- and 
androgen-dependent conditions.
DESIGN: A randomized, crossover, open-label study in 12 healthy adults (6 men 
and 6 women) compared the plasma and urinary pharmacokinetics of orally 
administered enantiomeric pure forms of S-(-)[2-13C]equol, R-(+)[2-13C]equol, 
and the racemic mixture. Plasma and urinary [13C]R-equol and [13C]S-equol 
concentrations were measured by tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Plasma [13C]equol concentration appearance and disappearance curves 
showed that both enantiomers were rapidly absorbed, attained high circulating 
concentrations, and had a similar terminal elimination half-life of 7-8 h. The 
systemic bioavailability and fractional absorption of R-(+)[2-13C]equol were 
higher than those of S-(-)[2-13C]equol or the racemate. The pharmacokinetics of 
racemic (+/-)[2-13C]equol were different from those of the individual 
enantiomers: slower absorption, lower peak plasma concentrations, and lower 
systemic bioavailability.
CONCLUSIONS: The high bioavailability of both diastereoisomers contrasts with 
previous findings for the soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein, both of which 
have relatively poor bioavailability, and suggests that low doses of equol taken 
twice daily may be sufficient to achieve biological effects.

The soy isoflavone metabolite, S-(-)equol, has selective affinity for estrogen 
receptor (ER)beta and also antagonizes in vivo the action of 
dihydrotestosterone. It is therefore of interest as a potential new therapeutic 
agent in hormone-dependent conditions and is under development as a 
nutraceutical. Our objective in this study was to define the pharmacokinetics of 
natural S-(-)equol after administration of SE5-OH, a newly developed S-(-)equol 
supplement made by incubation of the equol-producing bacterium Lactococcus 
garvieae with soy germ isoflavones. In a single-center, open-label, randomized, 
2-period crossover design study, the pharmacokinetics of S-(-)equol administered 
as single-bolus oral doses of 10 and 30 mg in the form of SE5-OH tablets was 
determined in 12 healthy postmenopausal women. S-(-)equol was measured in plasma 
and urine collected at timed intervals over a 48-h period postdosing using 
tandem MS. Equol-producer status was also determined after a soymilk challenge 
conducted after the pharmacokinetic sampling was complete. S-(-)equol was 
rapidly absorbed after oral administration and attained high plasma 
concentrations, with a plasma elimination half-life of 8 h. The maximum plasma 
concentration/dose, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 
to infinity/dose, and the fraction of dose excreted in urine (%f(e,u)) were 
similar for the 2 doses, indicating a dose-proportional response in total 
S-(-)equol pharmacokinetics. The systemic bioavailability of S-(-)equol was very 
high, as the %f(e,u) was 82% for both doses, which is greater than published 
data for the soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein. Three participants were 
determined to be equol-producers, representing a 25% frequency, and 
equol-producer status had no effect on natural S-(-)equol pharmacokinetics.

The long-term stability in real and accelerated time for galenic oils based on 
full-spectrum cannabis has been studied, using sesame oil as a dilutant. Sesame 
oil is one of the most used vehicles in the cannabis pharmaceutical industry due 
to the costs and increased oral bioavailability of cannabinoids. The real-time 
assays conducted at 25 °C over twelve months demonstrated high stability and 
showed no significant changes in the composition of cannabinoids, total 
polyphenols, flavonoids, or antioxidant capacity. In these studies, it was 
observed that there was no development of microorganisms compromising the 
stability of the oils over a year. The three oil varieties exhibited a high 
bactericidal capacity against E. coli, S. aureus, and P. larvae.

OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to determine the antioxidant activities of 
two varieties of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) seeds using 
2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis 
(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), and ferric reducing antioxidant 
power (FRAP) method, and to investigate the correlation between total phenolic 
as well as flavonoid contents and antioxidant activities of the extracts.
METHODS: The antioxidant activities were determined using DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP 
assays, and the total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) 
were measured by ultraviolet (UV)-Vis spectrophotometry. The correlation between 
total phenolic and flavonoid contents and DPPH IC50, ABTS IC50, and FRAP EC50 
values was analyzed by Pearson's method.
RESULTS: The IC50 DPPH values of all sesame seed extracts were in the range of 
8.88-44.21 μg/mL and IC50 ABTS values were in the range of 24.91-141.19 μg/mL. 
EC50 FRAP value ranged from 222.40 to 872.57 μg/mL. The highest TPC of 1.57 g 
gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100 g was observed in ethanolic extract of black 
sesame seed, while the highest TFC of 4.29 g quercetin equivalent (QE)/100 g was 
observed in ethyl acetate extract of white sesame seeds. The TPC in black sesame 
seed extract was significantly negative correlated with IC50 ABTS value 
(r = -0.828, p < 0.01) and EC50 FRAP value (r = -0.976, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: All sesame seed extracts were categorized as very strong 
antioxidants by DPPH assay. Phenolic compounds in black sesame seeds were found 
to be the major contributors to antioxidant activities by using ABTS and FRAP 
methods. White and black sesame seeds have the potential to be developed as 
sources of natural antioxidants.

The incorporation of bioactive compounds from plant-based by-products into 
staple foods represents a sustainable strategy to enhance both nutritional 
quality and health benefits. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 
buckwheat husk addition (1.5%, 3.0%, 4.5%) on the antioxidant activity, total 
phenolic content (TPC) and its profile, color parameters, and sensory attributes 
of wheat and wholemeal breads. Increasing the husk content significantly (p ≤ 
0.05) enhanced antioxidant activity, especially in the lipid-soluble fraction, 
with the highest values observed at 4.5% addition. In terms of TPC, wheat bread 
showed a significant (p ≤ 0.05) increase (16.5%) only at 3.0% husk addition, 
while wholemeal breads exhibited consistent TPC growth at all levels, reaching a 
35.2% increase at 4.5% enrichment. Phenolic profiling revealed syringic acid as 
the dominant compound, constituting up to 64.4% of total phenolic acids in 
wholemeal bread with 4.5% husk. Flavonoids content increased with husk addition, 
with rutin, catechin, and orientin most prominent. Color analysis indicated a 
reduction in lightness and hue angle, an increase in browning index and total 
color difference with higher husk addition. Addition of husk modified aroma, 
color, and mouthfeel. Wholemeal breads with 1.5% and 4.5% buckwheat husk had the 
highest acceptability, enhancing nutritional and functional quality without 
affecting preference. Buckwheat husk effectively enhances bread's nutritional 
and functional quality.

Total equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and phenolic content of 26 common 
spice extracts from 12 botanical families were investigated. Qualitative and 
quantitative analyses of major phenolics in the spice extracts were 
systematically conducted by reversed-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography (RP-HPLC). Many spices contained high levels of phenolics and 
demonstrated high antioxidant capacity. Wide variation in TEAC values 
(0.55-168.7 mmol/100 g) and total phenolic content (0.04-14.38 g of gallic acid 
equivalent/100 g) was observed. A highly positive linear relationship (R2= 0.95) 
obtained between TEAC values and total phenolic content showed that phenolic 
compounds in the tested spices contributed significantly to their antioxidant 
capacity. Major types of phenolic constituents identified in the spice extracts 
were phenolic acids, phenolic diterpenes, flavonoids, and volatile oils (e.g., 
aromatic compounds). Rosmarinic acid was the dominant phenolic compound in the 
six spices of the family Labiatae. Phenolic volatile oils were the principal 
active ingredients in most spices. The spices and related families with the 
highest antioxidant capacity were screened, e.g., clove in the Myrtaceae, 
cinnamon in the Lauraceae, oregano in the Labiatae, etc., representing potential 
sources of potent natural antioxidants for commercial exploitation. This study 
provides direct comparative data on antioxidant capacity and total and 
individual phenolics contents of the 26 spice extracts.

Tea, one of the most popular beverages worldwide, generates a substantial amount 
of spent leaves, often directly discarded although they may still contain 
valuable compounds. This study aims to optimize the extraction of polyphenols 
from spent black tea (SBT) and spent green tea (SGT) leaves while also exploring 
their antioxidant and antibacterial properties. Response surface methodology was 
utilized to determine the optimal experimental conditions for extracting 
polyphenols from SBT and SGT. The total phenolic content (TPC) was quantified 
using the Folin-Ciocalteu method, while antioxidant activity was evaluated 
through the DPPH assay. Antibacterial activity was assessed using the disk 
diffusion method. Additionally, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
was employed to analyze the phytochemical profiles of the SBT and SGT extracts. 
Optimal extraction for SBT achieved 404 mg GAE/g DM TPC and 51.5% DPPH 
inhibition at 93.64 °C, 79.9 min, and 59.4% ethanol-water. For SGT, conditions 
of 93.63 °C, 81.7 min, and 53.2% ethanol-water yielded 452 mg GAE/g DM TPC and 
78.3% DPPH inhibition. Both tea extracts exhibited antibacterial activity 
against Gram-positive bacteria, with SGT showing greater efficacy against S. 
aureus and slightly better inhibition of B. subtilis compared to SBT. No 
activity was observed against the Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and S. 
typhimurium. HPLC analysis revealed hydroxybenzoic acid as the main phenolic 
compound in SBT (360.7 mg/L), while rutin was predominant in SGT (42.73 mg/L). 
The optimized phenolic-rich extracts of SBT and SGT demonstrated promising 
antioxidant and antibacterial potential, making them strong candidates for use 
as natural health boosters in food products.

In this study, we investigated the intestinal absorption of luteolin and 
luteolin 7-O-beta-glucoside in rats by HPLC. The absorption analysis using rat 
everted small intestine demonstrated that luteolin was converted to glucuronides 
during passing through the intestinal mucosa and that luteolin 
7-O-beta-glucoside was absorbed after hydrolysis to luteolin. Free luteolin, its 
conjugates and methylated conjugates were present in rat plasma after dosing. 
This suggests that some luteolin can escape the intestinal conjugation and the 
hepatic sulfation/methylation. LC/MS analysis showed that the main conjugate 
which circulates in the blood was a monoglucuronide of the unchanged aglycone. 
Luteolin in propyleneglycol was absorbed more rapidly than that in 0.5% 
carboxymethyl cellulose. The plasma concentration of luteolin and its conjugates 
reached the highest level 15 min and 30 min after dosing with luteolin in 
propyleneglycol, respectively. HPLC analysis also allowed us to demonstrate the 
presence of free luteolin and its monoglucuronide in human serum after ingestion 
of luteolin.

The beneficial effects of red, yellow and white onion extracts have been 
assessed by antioxidant activity and antimutagenic activity. And the effects 
compared to BHT and ascorbic acid. Total phenolic compounds and flavonoids in 
onion extracts were determined. Yellow onion extract had more organic acid and 
free sugar than those detected in the white and red onion extract. The 
scavenging activity of DPPH radical and H(2)O(2) were increased depending on the 
concentration. The antioxidant activities using beta-carotene-linoleate system 
and reducing power were increased but the effect was small to that of BHT and 
ascorbic acid. After digested, extracts showed antimutagenic activities, and it 
seems that they inhibit the mutagenicity for digesting. This study demonstrated 
that the antimutagenicities and antioxidant properties of ethyl acetate extract 
against mutagens were related to their phenols and flavonoids, which are heat 
stable and losses digestive juices are relatively low.

Natural resins are complex mixtures of secondary metabolites produced by many 
plants in response to stress or injury and have long been used for their 
antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Among 
resin-producing genera, Commiphora Jacq. (Burseraceae) stands out for the 
traditional and medicinal relevance of its oleogum resins, commonly known as 
myrrh. In this study, we investigated, for the first time, the non-volatile 
fraction of the oleogum resin of Commiphora ornifolia (Balf.f.) J.B.Gillett, 
which is an endemic species of Socotra Island. Ethanol extraction followed by 
chromatographic and spectroscopic analysis (HPLC-DAD, NMR, HRMS) led to the 
isolation of (+)-yangambin, a furofuran lignan not previously reported in this 
species. Quantitative analysis showed yangambin to be present in all eight resin 
samples analyzed, at concentrations ranging from 3.50 (±0.02) to 9.05% (±0.19) 
of the ethanol extract. In addition, the analysis of the hydrolyzed 
polysaccharide fraction revealed the presence of arabinose, rhamnose, galactose, 
and galacturonic acid. These preliminary findings highlight the phytochemical 
richness of C. ornifolia oleogum resin and suggest the presence of other 
potentially bioactive compounds. The presence of yangambin, known for various 
pharmacological activities, supports further phytochemical and biological 
studies on this largely unexplored species.

Cold-pressed oils are oils prepared from pressing plant materials with a screw 
or hydraulic press, yielding oils with little contamination of harmful chemicals 
and high content of nutrients and functional constituents. Cold-pressed oils 
have gained increasing recognition as food supplements for preventing and 
ameliorating body deterioration due to ageing and the progression of lifestyle 
diseases or non-communicable diseases. This article aimed to review their 
structure, bioactivity, and chromatographic analysis of the mostly found 
functional compounds in cold-pressed oils, including phytosterols, carotenoids, 
tocols (tocopherols and tocotrienols), phenolic compounds (flavonoids, phenolic 
acids, tannins, stilbenes, and lignans), and squalene.

Flavanones, the main polyphenols of citrus fruits, are thought to contribute to 
the protective effects of these fruits against cardiovascular diseases and 
cancer. The metabolism of naringin (naringenin 7-O-neohesperidoside) is studied 
here in healthy (sham-operated, ShO) and tumor-bearing (TuB) rats. The tumor was 
induced by implanting Yoshida's sarcoma in hindlimb. Both groups received for 7 
days a semi-synthetic diet containing 0.5% naringin in per feeding conditions. 
Flavanones were analyzed in plasma, liver, kidney and urine by tandem mass 
spectrometry. Naringenin conjugates (essentially glucuronides) accounted for up 
to 98% of the total flavanones in plasma. Low amounts of hesperetin (4'-O-methyl 
naringénine) and isosakuranetin (3'-hydroxy-4'-O-methylnaringenin) were also 
detected in all biological samples and accounted for 2% of the total flavanones 
in plasma. They were largely present as aglycones. The in vivo hydroxylation of 
flavanones is described here for the first time. Total concentrations of 
naringenin metabolites reached 17.3+/-2.7 microM in plasma 6 hours after the 
beginning of the meal in healthy rats and only 10.6+/-1.3 microM in TuB rats. 
The nature of metabolites was similar in both healthy and TuB rats and in 
plasma, tissues and urine. The lower concentration of flavanones in the TuB rats 
suggests that disease and more particularly cancer, may affect the 
bioavailability of flavonoids.

The phenolic compounds present in 17 samples of Portuguese commercial and three 
homemade quince jams were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, to determine 
their authenticity. Two different extraction methods were needed for the 
complete definition of quince jams profiles, one of them including an Amberlite 
XAD-2 cleaning step. These analyses showed that all the samples presented a 
similar profile composed of at least eight identified phenolic compounds, 
several unidentified characteristic procyanidin polymers, and sodium benzoate as 
preservative of quince jams. Several samples also contained arbutin, suggesting 
that these quince jam samples were fraudulently adulterated with pear puree.

Pome trees, apple, pear, and quince, are classified into the subfamily 
Pomoideae, belonging to the Rosaceae family. Their autumnal fruits are consumed 
worldwide in different forms, that is, fresh or transformed into jams, jelly, 
juices, etc. Their well-established beneficial properties to human health were 
found mainly related to their phenolic content. Pulp and peel aqueous acetone 
extracts obtained from Tunisian fruits at commercial maturity were comparatively 
evaluated for their phenolic profiles and antioxidant and antimicrobial 
potentials. The phenolic compounds present in the extracts were identified and 
quantified using RP-HPLC-DAD and ESI-MS techniques. Significant differences in 
the chromatographic profiles among these fruits, as well as between pulp and 
peel extracts of each fruit, were observed. Quince, followed by 'Red Delicious', 
peel extracts showed the highest phenolic content (160.33 and 110.90 mg/100 g of 
fresh weight). The stronger inhibitory effect on DPPH radicals corresponded to 
those obtained from peel materials. A comparative analysis of the antimicrobial 
potential against a range of microorganism strains was also carried out. 
Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus were the most 
sensitive to the active extracts. Among the examined phenolic extracts, 'Red 
Delicious' and quince peels showed the highest effects for inhibiting bacteria 
growth. Minimum inhibitory and bactericide concentrations ranged from 10(2) to 
10(4) microg of polyphenol/mL. Red skin apple and quince peels could be of great 
interest as important antioxidant and antimicrobial polyphenol sources.

The present study reports the phenolic profile and antiproliferative properties 
of quince (Cydonia oblonga Miller) leaf and fruit (pulp, peel, and seed) against 
human kidney and colon cancer cells. The phenolic profiles of quince methanolic 
extracts were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/diode 
array detector (DAD). 5-O-Caffeoylquinic acid was always one of the two major 
phenolic compounds present in all extracts, except for seed. Our results 
revealed that quince leaf and fruit extracts exhibited distinctive 
antiproliferative activities. The extracts from quince leaf showed 
concentration-dependent growth inhibitory activity toward human colon cancer 
cells (IC(50) = 239.7 +/- 43.2 microg/mL), while no effect was observed in renal 
adenocarcinoma cells. Concerning the fruit, seed extracts exhibited no effect on 
colon cancer cell growth, whereas strong antiproliferative efficiency against 
renal cancer cells was observed for the highest concentration assayed (500 
microg/mL). The antiproliferative activity of pulp and peel extracts was low or 
absent in the selected range of extract concentrations. This is the first report 
showing that C. oblonga may be useful as a cancer chemopreventive and/or 
chemotherapeutic agent.

Isoflavones and carotenoids in four experimental genotypes and Hutcheson 
cultivar soybeans were evaluated as a function of processing treatments and 
maturity. Total isoflavone and carotenoid contents were affected by genotypes 
and maturity stages (p < 0.0001). Total isoflavones ranged from 472 microg/g (in 
NTCPR93-40) to 2280 microg/g (in Hutcheson). Lutein contents ranged from 895 (in 
NTCPR93-286) to 2119 (in Honey Brown), and beta-carotene ranged from 291 (in 
Hutcheson) to 491 (in NICPR92-40) microg/100 g. Mean total isoflavone retention 
percentages in immature Hutcheson soybeans were 46% (boiling), 53% (freezing), 
and 40% (freeze-drying). Mean retentions of lutein and beta-carotene, 
respectively, were 92 and 73% in frozen, 62 and 62% in boiled, and 34 and 27% in 
freeze-dried soybeans. Boiling caused a substantial increase in daidzin, 
genistin, and genistein. The results show that post-harvest changes in total 
isoflavones and carotenoids in soybeans are influenced by processing methods, 
but genotype has an effect on isoflavone and carotenoid profiles during seed 
development.

The great potential of whole-plant quinoa (WPQ) as a forage crop has been 
recognized in recent years. In this study, we investigated the effects of 
variety and harvest time on the fermentation characteristics, bacterial 
community, and hygienic quality of WPQ silage. Five varieties (Hongxin, Mengli1, 
SL577, SL2860, SL923) were grown across five separate experimental fields, with 
harvest occurring after 90 days (H1), 105 days (H2), or 120 days (H3). The 
samples were ensiled to evaluate their fermentation characteristics and 
bacterial composition. Hygienic quality was assessed using the Tax4fun2 and 
BugBase tools for potential pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance 
prediction. The variety significantly influenced (P < 0.05) all fermentation 
variables (including pH, lactic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, ethanol, and 
ammonia nitrogen), while harvest time affected pH and the contents of acetic 
acid, propionic acid, and NH3-N (P < 0.05). An interaction between variety and 
harvest time was detected (P < 0.05) for all fermentation variables. Based on 
the flieg' score index, silage quality increased for Mengli1 (5.20-54.8), SL577 
(36.7-71.5), and SL923 (34.9-77.0) with delayed harvest time, while silage 
quality decreased for Hongxin (52.1-41.4) and SL2860 (78.4-63.6). Compared to 
other silages, Hongxin silages exhibited greater differences in bacterial 
community composition between harvest times (indicated by higher PERMANOVA 
R2-value). Tax4fun2 and BugBase analyses revealed that delaying harvest time 
significantly increased (P < 0.05) the relative abundances of pathogenic and 
antibiotic-resistant KEGG pathways (""Infectious disease: bacterial invasion"" and 
""Drug resistance"") and harmful microbes associated with potential pathogenicity 
and antimicrobial resistance in Hongxin silages. This study highlights the 
importance of variety and harvest time in producing high-quality, safe WPQ 
silage, which is beneficial for ensuring the safety in our food supply chain.

Figs are highly perishable, with significant losses due to overripening or 
failure to meet market standards. Drying is essential to extending their shelf 
life and reducing food waste. This study evaluated the impact of traditional sun 
drying and hybrid solar drying on the quality of dried ""Pingo de Mel"" figs. Sun 
drying required 5-7 days, while the hybrid solar drying completed the process in 
3 days. Both methods resulted in a similar final moisture content (29.43% and 
28.14%, respectively), water activity (0.68 and 0.63, respectively), and 
hardness (2.36 and 2.61 N, respectively). Hybrid solar-dried figs exhibited 
slightly lower L* values and higher b* values, reflecting a darker appearance 
with a more pronounced yellow hue. Fresh and sun-dried figs developed fungal 
growth (Alternaria spp., Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium spp., and Fusarium 
spp.) within four weeks, while hybrid solar-dried figs remained 
contamination-free, improving microbial safety. Moreover, hybrid drying 
preserved higher levels of phenolic compounds, particularly rutin and 
5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, along with greater antioxidant activity. Overall, 
hybrid solar drying offers significant advantages over traditional sun drying by 
reducing the drying time, enhancing microbial safety, and preserving bioactive 
compounds, making it a more effective method for fig preservation.

Apples are an important source of flavonoids in the human diet. The effect of 
processing apples into juice on polyphenolic antioxidant content and activity is 
described. Raw juice obtained from Jonagold apples by pulping and straight 
pressing or after pulp enzyming had an antioxidant activity that was only 10 and 
3%, respectively, of the activity of the fresh apples. The levels of flavonoids 
and chlorogenic acid in the juice were reduced to between 50% (chlorogenic acid) 
and 3% (catechins). Most of the antioxidants were retained in the pomace rather 
than being transferred into the juice. Apparently, most of the antioxidant 
compounds are absorbed to the solid matter of the pomace. In apple juice, 45% of 
the total measured antioxidant activity could be ascribed to the analyzed 
antioxidants. For three apple cultivars tested (Elstar, Golden Delicious, and 
Jonagold), the processing methods had similar effects. The results indicate that 
processing can have a major impact on the bioactivity of products.

The difference in urinary excretion of mammalian and plant lignans in rats was 
determined after oral administration of equivalent doses (25 mg/kg of body 
weight) of 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR), lariciresinol (LAR), matairesinol (MR), 
and secoisolariciresinol (SECO). Twenty-four hours-urine samples were collected 
after a single dose and after administration of one dose/day for 10 days. Eight 
lignans were analysed in urine extracts using a high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method showing good sensitivity and 
repeatability. After a single dose of HMR, LAR, MR, and SECO, the main 
metabolites were 7-hydroxyenterolactone (HENL), cyclolariciresinol (CLAR), 
enterolactone (ENL), and enterodiol (END), respectively, but after 10-day 
exposure ENL was the main metabolite of all the tested lignans, showing a 
considerably higher excretion than after a single dose. Metabolic 
transformations of plant lignans into each other could also be observed.

In seed extracts of five oilseed species, in bran extracts of three cereal 
species, and in seed and/or whole berry extracts of 10 berry species, the 
concentrations of a large number of lignans and the enantiomeric composition of 
selected lignans were determined. In the case of sesame and hemp seeds, the 
lignan content and composition of the whole seeds was compared to that of the 
hulled seeds. The results showed that cloudberry seeds are the third most 
lignan-rich food source after linseeds and whole sesame seeds, and that most of 
the berry species analysed were more lignan-rich than the cereal brans. The 
lignans are concentrated in the hull of the oilseeds and in the seeds of the 
berries. In most samples, secoisolarici-, pino-, medio-, and syringaresinol were 
present as a mixture of two enantiomers.

A modified high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for 
determination of trans-resveratrol (resveratrol) in peanuts and peanut products 
has been developed. Resveratrol was extracted with acetonitrile-water (90/10, 
v/v) by blending with diatomaceous earth at high speed followed by purification 
of an aliquot of the extract on a minicolumn packed with Al(2)O(3)-ODS (C(18)) 
mixture. The column was eluted with acetonitrile-water (90/10, v/v), eluate was 
evaporated under nitrogen, and residue was dissolved in HPLC mobile phase. 
Resveratrol in an aliquot of purified extract was quantitated by HPLC on silica 
gel with n-hexane-2-propanol-water-acetonitrile-acetic acid (1050/270/17/5/1, 
v/v) as a mobile phase. The recovery of resveratrol added to diatomaceous earth 
at 0.05 microg/g was 98.95 +/- 17.79%; the recovery of the standard added to 
fresh peanuts (with 0.070 microg/g natural level of resveratrol) at 0.50, 5.00, 
and 10.00 microg/g was 117.23 +/- 8.87, 100.10 +/- 2.49, and 100.45 +/- 1.51%, 
respectively. The quantitation limit of resveratrol in fresh peanuts was about 
0. 01 microg/g. Roasted peanuts had the lowest content of resveratrol of 0.055 
+/- 0.023 microg/g (n = 21), while in peanut butter its concentration was 
significantly higher, 0.324 +/- 0.129 microg/g (n = 46), and boiled peanuts had 
the highest level of 5.138 +/- 2.849 microg/g (n = 12). Resveratrol content in 
commercial peanut products was similar to the resveratrol content of the raw 
peanut fractions routinely used for making them.

Grape pomace extract (GPE) is a rich and relatively low-cost source of phenolic 
compounds. However, little is known about the main GPE metabolites in mammals, 
which could help explain the observed health-promoting effects. This study 
investigated the presence of parent compounds from flavanol, flavonol and 
stilbene families and their metabolites in rat plasma and tissues after an acute 
intake of GPE in doses of 300 and 600 mg kg/body weight. The measurement of free 
compounds and their metabolites was performed by ultra-high performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Results showed the 
presence of epicatechin, epicatechin methyl-glucuronide, epicatechin 
methyl-sulphate, catechin, catechin-glucuronide, quercetin methyl-glucuronide, 
resveratrol-3-glucuronide, resveratrol-4-glucuronide and resveratrol-3-sulphate 
in plasma, which was dose dependent. The most abundant measured compound in 
plasma was epicatechin-glucuronide. The presence of glucuronidated and 
methyl-glucuronidated forms of catechin were observed in the liver at both 
doses, while epicatechin-glucuronide and methyl-glucuronide were detected only 
upon intake of 600 mg GPE/kg body weight. At this dose epicatechin-glucuronide 
and methyl-glucuronide were also detected in muscle, and catechin 
methyl-glucuronide in adipose tissue. Results show the main GPE metabolites 
present in rat tissues after oral consumption, contributing to better understand 
the health benefits of GPE and its potential utilization as a functional 
ingredient.

Fig fruit has been a typical component in the health-promoting Mediterranean 
diet for millennia. To study the potential health-promoting constituents of fig 
fruits, six commercial fig varieties differing in color (black, red, yellow, and 
green) were analyzed for total polyphenols, total flavonoids, antioxidant 
capacity, and amount and profile of anthocyanins. Using reversed-phase liquid 
chromatography (RP-LC), various concentrations of anthocyanins but a similar 
profile was found in all varieties studied. Hydrolysis revealed cyanidin as the 
major aglycon. Proton and carbon NMR confirmed cyanidin-3-O-rhamnoglucoside 
(cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside; C3R) as the main anthocyanin in all fruits. Color 
appearance of fig extract correlated well with total polyphenols, flavonoids, 
anthocyanins, and antioxidant capacity. Extracts of darker varieties showed 
higher contents of phytochemicals compared to lighter colored varieties. Fruit 
skins contributed most of the above phytochemicals and antioxidant activity 
compared to the fruit pulp. Antioxidant capacity correlated well with the 
amounts of polyphenols and anthocyanins (R2 = 0.985 and 0.992, respectively). In 
the dark-colored Mission and the red Brown-Turkey varieties, the anthocyanin 
fraction contributed 36 and 28% of the total antioxidant capacity, respectively. 
C3R contributed 92% of the total antioxidant capacity of the anthocyanin 
fraction. Fruits of the Mission variety contained the highest levels of 
polyphenols, flavonoids, and anthocyanins and exhibited the highest antioxidant 
capacity.

Functional foods are gaining heightened popularity in diet modifications. Green 
bananas contain a significant quantity of resistant starch, dietary fibre, and 
phytochemicals that demonstrate strong antioxidant properties, particularly due 
to the high concentration of polyphenols. The community demand for incorporating 
these essential components into food products, such as bread, has increased. 
Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in the content 
and bio-accessibility of phenolic compounds in bread enriched with 5, 10, and 
15% of Australian green banana powder (GBF) from (Cavendish ""Musa acuminata"", 
Ladyfinger ""Musa paradisiaca L."", and Ducasse ""Musa balbisiana""), as well as 
their antioxidant capabilities and the generation of short-chain fatty acids 
(SCFAs) after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion and colonic fermentation. The 
15% Cavendish bread exhibited significant TPC and TFC at 1.31 mg GAE/g and 0.05 
mg QE/g, respectively, along with substantial antioxidant activity (DPPH, 0.40 
mg TE/g), observed following stomach and intestinal phases. However, the 15% 
Ladyfinger bread exhibited the highest TTC following the stomach digestion, with 
17.4 mg CE/g. The bio-accessibility of most phenolic components from 10% 
GBF-bread was elevated following the gastric and intestinal phases. Nonetheless, 
a substantial total phenolic content (50.3% in Ladyfinger bread) was still 
observable in the residue during colonic fermentation. The highest SCFAs 
production occurred in Cavendish and Ducasse bread after 24 h of fermentation. 
Overall, the consumption of GBF bread can positively influence intestinal health 
and provide antioxidant properties, facilitating future advancements in the 
creation of nutrient-dense and health-enhancing bakery products.

This study investigated the influence of Bacillus subtilis fermentation on the 
composition of phenolic substances and antioxidant activity in cornmeal. The 
results indicate that the fermentation process significantly increased both the 
total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC). After 5 days of 
fermentation, the TPC rose from 31.68 ± 1.72 mg/g to 39.46 ± 2.95 mg/g, 
representing a 24.56% increase, while the TFC increased from 2.13 ± 0.11 mg/g to 
7.56 ± 0.29 mg/g, marking a 254.93% increase. Additionally, the proportion of 
free phenolic compounds in cornmeal increased from 20.24% to 83.98%, while the 
proportion of bound phenolic compounds decreased from 79.76% to 16.02%. 
Furthermore, the hydrolytic enzyme activities of cellulase, β-glucosidase, and 
xylanase were significantly correlated with the free phenolic content (FPC) (r > 
0.85, p < 0.05), indicating their crucial role in releasing free phenolic 
compounds from cornmeal. Employing scanning electron microscopy, differential 
scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier-transform infrared 
spectroscopy analyses, we inferred that the enzymes produced by the 
microorganisms disrupted the cellular structure of cornmeal and weakened the 
interactions between bound phenolics and the food matrix, thereby facilitating 
the release of phenolic compounds. This release resulted in an overall increase 
in the antioxidant activity of the cornmeal. The study provided a novel approach 
to enhancing the bioavailability of phenolic acids in cornmeal, indicating the 
potential benefits of fermentation in food processing.

A phytochemical study was undertaken on tronchuda cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. 
var. costata DC) cultivated under conventional and organic practices and 
collected at different times. Six organic acids (aconitic, citric, ascorbic, 
malic, shikimic, and fumaric acids) were identified and quantified by HPLC-UV. 
Qualitative and quantitative differences were noted between internal and 
external leaves. Analysis of the phenolics of the internal leaves was achieved 
by HPLC-DAD, and the phenolic profile obtained was revealed to be distinct from 
that of the external leaves. By this means were identified and quantified 11 
compounds: 3-p-coumaroylquinic acid, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, 
kaempferol 3-O-(caffeoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol

The aim of the study was to characterize physical and chemical composition of 
four highbush blueberry cultivars (""Bluecrop,"" ""Late Blue,"" ""Chandler,"" and 
""Elliot""). The assessment of ultrasound influence at the osmotic dehydration 
step and during hybrid drying on mass transfer and the nutritional quality of 
all cultivars was also done. The experiment consisted of two stages: (1) 
initial: optimization of osmotic dehydration procedure, (2) the main experiment 
including all stages of dried blueberry production (pretreatment, osmotic 
dehydration chosen in the initial stage, and drying). In both parts, the effect 
of US and cultivar were considered as factors influencing the most important 
quality indices. The osmotic dehydration, in the mixture (1:1) of sucrose 
solution and apple juice concentrate (65°Bx) at a fruit to syrup ratio 1:4, was 
carried out in water bath fitted with ultrasonic transducers (25 kHz, 27.8 W/L) 
at a temperature of 40°C for 150 min. After pretreatment osmo-dehydrated fruits 
were subjected to drying in hybrid (microwave-ultrasound-convective) drum dryer. 
Regardless of the cultivar US had positive influence on mass transfer (up to 22% 
for intact and 12% for mechanically scratched) at the osmotic dehydration stage. 
Unfavorably, its action tend to decrease phenolic compounds content. The final 
effect, however, was strongly influenced by the choice of cultivar. With regard 
to ultrasound applied at the drying step, no explicit effect, either on the 
drying process efficiency or on final product quality, was identified. In the 
same processing conditions ""Elliot"" turned out to be the most promising to 
produce ready-to-eat fruit snacks in terms of the final product stability and 
bioactives content.
PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Hybrid drying was proposed as a novel approach in 
blueberry drying. Ultrasound application as a part of abovementioned drying 
technique is considered an efficient way of shortening drying time due to mass 
transfer intensification and the interaction with dehydrated tissue. However, no 
experiments studying the impact of ultrasound on various cultivars within one 
species were carried out. This study contributes to the understanding that 
appropriate cultivar selection in the production of ready-to-eat dried blueberry 
fruit is just as important as process parameters in obtaining an attractive 
product with a high level of natural bioactive compounds.

Seed coat, cotyledon and embryonic axe fractions of chickpea (Cicer arietinum 
L.) and horse gram (Macrotyloma uniflorum L.) were evaluated for their phenolic 
composition in relation to antioxidant activities. Compositional analysis of 
phenolics by HPLC revealed a wide variation in the distribution of flavonols, 
isoflavones, phenolic acids and anthocyanins among these legume fractions. 
Although cotyledon fractions of both the legumes were rich in phenolic acids, 
the concentrations of flavonols such as quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin 
were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than the embryonic axe and seed coat 
fractions. Ferulic, chlorogenic, caffeic, and vanillic acids were the principal 
phenolic acids found in cotyledons. The most striking difference was the 
predominance of isoflavones in embryonic axe fractions. Although the isoflavone 
genistein was detected in all three fractions of chickpea, it was present 
exclusively in the embryonic axe fraction of horse gram at levels greater than 
daidzein. Furthermore, cyanidin, petunidin, and delphinidin were detected in 
seed coat and embryonic axe fractions but not in cotyledons. In addition to 
these three anthocyanins, malvidin was found only in the horse gram seed coat 
fraction. Seed coat fractions having higher total phenolic indexes were found to 
be the most active 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavengers 
(IC(50) 13.1 to 18.6 microg/mL) followed by embryonic axe and cotyledon 
fractions (IC(50) 15.4 to 34.2 microg/mL). Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) 
scavenging capacities of cotyledons, embryonic axe and seed coats were 12.3, 
34.1 and 78.6% for chickpea and 15.1, 56.8 and 92.6% for horse gram, 
respectively. The multiple antioxidant activity of horse gram and chickpea 
fractions was evident, as they also possessed reducing power and ferrous 
ion-chelating potency. These results contributed to the understanding of the 
relationships between major phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities of 
legumes and provided useful information for effective utilization of 
legume-milled fractions as functional food ingredients for promoting health.

Ten healthy human subjects consumed 500 mL of Choladi green tea, containing 648 
mumol of flavan-3-ols after which plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h 
period and analysed by HPLC-MS. Plasma contained a total of ten metabolites, in 
the form of O-methylated, sulphated and glucuronide conjugates of (epi)catechin 
and (epi)gallocatechin, with 29-126 nM peak plasma concentrations (C(max)) 
occurring 1.6-2.3 h after ingestion, indicative of absorption in the small 
intestine. Plasma also contained unmetabolised (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate 
and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate with respective C(max) values of 55 and 25 nM. 
Urine excreted 0-24 h after consumption of green tea contained 15 metabolites of 
(epi)catechin and (epi)gallocatechin, but (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate and 
(-)-epicatechin-3-gallate were not detected. Overall flavan-3-ol metabolite 
excretion was equivalent to 8.1% of intake, however, urinary (epi)gallocatechin 
metabolites corresponded to 11.4% of (epi)gallocatechin ingestion while 
(epi)catechin metabolites were detected in amounts equivalent to 28.5% of 
(epi)catechin intake. These findings imply that (epi)catechins are highly 
bioavailable, being absorbed and excreted to a much greater extent than most 
other flavonoids. It is also evident that flavan-3-ol metabolites are rapidly 
turned over in the circulatory system and as a consequence C(max) values are not 
an accurate quantitative indicator of the extent to which absorption occurs.

Sensory-guided decomposition of roasted cocoa nibs revealed that, besides 
theobromine and caffeine, a series of bitter-tasting 2,5-diketopiperazines and 
flavan-3-ols were the key inducers of the bitter taste as well as the astringent 
mouthfeel imparted upon consumption of roasted cocoa. In addition, a number of 
polyphenol glycopyranosides as well as a series of N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino 
acids have been identified as key astringent compounds of roasted cocoa. In the 
present investigation, a total of 84 putative taste compounds were quantified in 
roasted cocoa beans and then rated for the taste contribution on the basis of 
dose-over-threshold (DoT) factors to bridge the gap between pure structural 
chemistry and human taste perception. To verify these quantitative results, an 
aqueous taste reconstitute was prepared by blending aqueous solutions of the 
individual taste compounds in their ""natural"" concentrations. Sensory analyses 
revealed that the taste profile of this artificial cocktail was very close to 
the taste profile of an aqueous suspension of roasted cocoa nibs. To further 
narrow down the number of key taste compounds, finally, taste omission 
experiments and human dose/response functions were performed, demonstrating that 
the bitter-tasting alkaloids theobromine and caffeine, seven bitter-tasting 
diketopiperazines, seven bitter- and astringent-tasting flavan-3-ols, six 
puckering astringent N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino acids, four velvety astringent 
flavonol glycosides, gamma-aminobutyric acid, beta-aminoisobutyric acid, and six 
organic acids are the key organoleptics of the roasted cocoa nibs.

To investigate probable health benefits of flavonoids and stilbenes in red wine 
a new reversed-phase (RP) high-performance liquid-chromatographic (HPLC) method 
with enhanced separation efficiency and improved selectivity, sensitivity, and 
speed has been established for determination of the flavonoids quercetin, 
myricetin and kaempferol and the stilbenes cis- and trans-resveratrol, in a 
single run . UV-absorbance, fluorescence (FLD), and mass-spectrometric (MS) 
detection were also evaluated. UV-absorbance detection at 320 nm for stilbenes 
and 377 nm for flavonoids enables their determination up to the nanogram range 
with a linearity of R2>0.9999 (linear range 50 ng mL(-1)-50 microg mL(-1)). 
Calculated values of average recoveries were between 95 and 105% for all 
analytes. For resveratrol, fluorescence detection was highly selective and twice 
as sensitive as UV detection, and linearity was satisfactory (R2>0.9996; linear 
range see UV detection). For the detection of the hydrophilic glycosidic 
compounds piceid and rutin, which are coeluted with other hydrophilic 
ingredients, the validated RP HPLC system was coupled to a quadrupole ion-trap 
mass-spectrometer (MS) via an electrospray interface (ESI) with 25% ammonia 
solution as sheath liquid. MS detection was, highly linear (R2>0.9878; linear 
range 50 ng mL(-1)-50 microg mL(-1)) for all investigated analytes and the 
limits of detection were in the low nanogram range. Compared with UV detection 
MS detection resulted in a 200% increase in signal intensity for myricetin and 
400% increases for quercetin and kaempferol, but equal signal intensity for 
resveratrol. Calculated values of average recoveries were 102% for myricetin and 
79% for piceid. Collision induced dissociation (CID) was also used to obtain 
characteristic fragmentation fingerprints to facilitate qualitative and 
quantitative analysis even in complex matrices. Finally, this hyphenated 
HPLC-ESI-MS method was highly suitable and an essential improvement compared 
with UV- and fluorescence detection.

A method for quantitation of six prenylflavonoids (xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, 
desmethylxanthohumol, 6- and 8-prenylnaringenins and 6-geranylnaringenin) in 
hops and beer by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry has been developed. The method 
allows direct analysis of beer and crude methanolic extracts of hops. After HPLC 
separation, prenylflavonoids were detected by positive ion multiple-reaction 
monitoring using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a heated 
nebulizer--atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface. The accuracy and 
precision were evaluated by replicate analyses of (spiked) samples. Thirteen 
commercial beers were analysed with the method. Isoxanthohumol, formed by 
isomerization of xanthohumol during the brewing process, was the most abundant 
flavonoid in hopped beers, ranging from 0.04 to 3.44 mg/l.

The flavonol contents of 20 varieties of tomato fruit were investigated in 
relation to variety, size, season, and country of origin. Ten commonly consumed 
tomato-based food products were also assessed. Free and conjugated flavonols 
were identified and quantified using reversed-phase HPLC. Ninety-eight percent 
of flavonols detected in tomatoes were found to occur in the skin. Tomatoes 
contained, primarily as conjugates, quercetin and kaempferol. The main quercetin 
conjugate was identified as rutin (quercetin 3-rhamnosylglucoside) by LC-MS. The 
total flavonol content of the different varieties of tomato that were analyzed 
varied from 1.3 to 22.2 microgram/g of fresh weight (fw). Smaller cherry tomato 
fruits originating from warm sunny climates, such as Spain and Israel, were 
found to contain the highest concentration of flavonols. Among the tomato-based 
products investigated, tomato juice and tomato purée were rich in flavonols, 
containing 14-16 microgram/mL and 70 microgram/g fw, respectively. In contrast 
to fresh tomatoes, most tomato-based products contained significant amounts of 
free flavonols.

Teas represent a rich source of dietary antioxidants. This paper describes 
analysis of the antioxidant potential of individual tea phenolics using an 
on-line high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Tea phenolics from 
Kenyan green and black teas were identified using liquid chromatography--mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) in conjunction with the analysis of their 
2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS+) radical scavenging 
ability. Antioxidant potential of flavan-3-ols, caffeoylquinic acids, flavonols, 
and theaflavins was assessed in comparison to the synthetic vitamin E analogue 
Trolox. (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate was identified as the most potent 
antioxidant with a Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) value of 3.0, 
contributing approximately 30% of the total antioxidant capacity of green tea. 
Theaflavins retained antioxidant capacity similar to that of (-)-epicatechin 
monomers whilst conjugated flavonols did not contribute significantly to the 
antioxidant capacity of either green or black tea. After HPLC analysis of the 
antioxidant capacity of phenolics in black tea some 80% of antioxidant activity 
remained unaccounted for indicating the potential importance of thearubigens as 
antioxidants in black teas.

Eleven subjects completed a clinical trial to determine the safety/tolerability

specific anthocyanins-cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-sambubioside, 
cyanidin-3-rutinoside, and cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside, as well as ellagic 
acid. Subjects were fed 45 g of freeze-dried BRB daily for 7 days. Blood samples 
were collected predose on days 1 and 7 and at 10 time points postdose. Urine was 
collected for 12 hours predose on days 1 and 7 and at three 4-hour intervals 
postdose. Maximum concentrations of anthocyanins and ellagic acid in plasma 
occurred at 1 to 2 hours, and maximum quantities in urine appeared from 0 to 4 
hours. Overall, less than 1% of these compounds were absorbed and excreted in 
urine. None of the pharmacokinetic parameters changed significantly between days 
1 and 7. In conclusion, 45 g of freeze-dried BRB daily are well tolerated and 
result in quantifiable anthocyanins and ellagic acid in plasma and urine.

BACKGROUND: The organic food sales have been increasing during the recent years. 
It has been hypothesised that organically grown fruits are healthier based on 
their higher content of phytochemicals. However, data on the bioavailability of 
phytochemicals from organically or conventionally produced plant foods are 
scarce.
METHODS: Two human intervention studies were performed to compare the 
bioavailability of polyphenols in healthy men after ingestion of apples from 
different farming systems. The administered apples were grown organically and 
conventionally under defined conditions and characterised regarding their 
polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity. No significant differences in the 
polyphenol content and the antioxidant capacity from the organic and 
conventional farming system were observed.
RESULTS: In the short-term intervention study, six men consumed either 
organically or conventionally produced apples in a randomized cross-over study. 
After intake of 1 kg apples, phloretin (C (max) 13 + or - 5 nmol/l, t (max) 1.7 
+ or - 1.2 h) and coumaric acid (C (max )35 + or - 12 nmol/l, t (max) 3.0 + or - 
0.8 h) plasma concentrations increased significantly (P < 0.0001) in both 
intervention groups, without differences between the two farming systems. In the 
long-term intervention study, 43 healthy volunteers consumed organically or 
conventionally produced apples (500 g/day; 4 weeks) or no apples in a 
double-blind, randomized intervention study. In this study, 24 h after the last 
dosing regime, the apple intake did not result in increasing polyphenol 
concentrations in plasma and urine compared to the control group suggesting no 
accumulation of apple polyphenols or degradation products in humans.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the two farming systems 
(organic/conventional) do not result in differences in the bioavailability of 
apple polyphenols.

An extract from flaxseed containing oligomeric structures of the phenolic 
glucosides secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), p-coumaric acid glucoside and 
ferulic acid glucoside was fractionated into three oligomeric fractions (F50, 
F60 and F70) by reversed phase liquid chromatography and further subfractionated 
by Sepharose CL-6B. The F50 fraction, which had the highest proportion of 
hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides, was also fractionated on Sephadex LH-20 
according to hydrophobicity and size. The different separations resulted in 
complex profiles of UV-absorbing molecules. HPLC analyses indicated that 
reversed-phase chromatography separated the oligomers according to composition 
of the phenolic glucosides, while the subfractionation revealed that other 
structural features of the oligomers were also important. Using the DPPH 
radical, SDG and oligomeric fractions showed similar hydrogen-donating abilities 
comparable to ferulic acid but higher than α-tocopherol, which suggests that SDG 
was the only active antioxidant.

Three phenolic glucosides, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, p-coumaric acid 
glucoside and ferulic acid glucoside, were analyzed in commercial breads 
containing flaxseed. The total phenolic glucoside content ranged from 15 to 
157mg/100g dry bread. Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside was the dominating 
phenolic glucoside with an average relative content of 62%, followed by 
p-coumaric acid glucoside (20%) and ferulic acid glucoside (18%). Strong 
positive correlations between the phenolic glucosides were found, indicating no 
major effect of raw material or bread-making process on the relative content of 
the phenolic glucosides in flaxseed.

This research studies in detail the contents of phenolic compounds determined by 
the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and the antioxidant activities determined by the 
TEAC (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity), DPPH (using 
diphenyl-p-picrylhydrazyl radical), and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) 
methods, and their correlations for used standards with these methods 
(catechine, gallic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, Trolox, ascorbic acid, and 
ferrous sulfate) and extracts from several species of commonly consumed 
vegetables were studied in detail. The comparison of absolute values of 
absorption coefficients for used standards and for individual methods allows one 
to choose optimal common standards for methods to be compared. The procedures 
applied for the same sets of the extracts using identical calibration procedures 
and common standards allowed better comparison of the results obtained by the 
TEAC, DPPH, and FRAP methods. The values of content of phenolic substances and 
total antioxidant activity of the sets of samples correlate very well for all 
used methods. The very high values of antioxidant activity were found in 
intensely colored vegetables (red cabbage, red onion, etc.), and the values were 
very low in watery vegetables such as potato, marrow, and cucumber.

The quantification of volatile compounds in virgin olive oil poses several 
analytical challenges due to the existence of different concentrations, chemical 
families, and the possible matrix effect. Accurate quantification, using 
adequate methodological calibration and statistical procedures, is essential for 
obtaining reliable results. The aim of this work was to develop and validate an 
analytical-statistical approach for the quantification of volatile compounds in 
virgin olive oil. Therefore, several analytical parameters were determined for 
four calibrations. The ordinary least square (OLS) linear adjustment was 
selected over the weighted least square due to the homoscedasticity of the 
variable errors. Additionally, standard addition (AC) and AC with an internal 
standard (IS) exhibited greater variability, whereas external matrix-matched 
calibration (EC) was identified as the most reliable approach for quantifying 
volatile compounds in virgin olive oil. The employment of an IS did not improve 
the performance of the method in any case. Thus, based on the statistical 
results, the OLS linear adjustment with EC was selected as the best 
statistical-analytical approach for quantifying volatiles in olive oil matrices. 
The volatiles of nine virgin olive oil samples were quantified, applying 
different methodological calibrations, and no differences were detected, 
underscoring EC as a superior alternative.

                    Ultraviolet radiation induced degradation of ascorbic acid in a model apple juice system and in apple juice was studied using a collimated beam batch UV reactor. In the model system, ascorbic acid degradation was more rapid at higher dose levels and the reaction accelerated with increasing exposure time. Ascorbic acid degradation significantly (
                    <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
                    &lt; 0.05) increased as the pH was raised from 2.4 to 5.5, although no difference was observed between 2.4 and 3.3. Increasing malic acid concentration between 0.1 and 1%, increased ascorbic acid degradation (
                    <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>
                    &lt; 0.05) although there was no difference between 0.5 and 1.0%. Solution absorbance, varied by addition of tannic acid, decreased ascorbic acid degradation with increasing concentration due to absorption of UV radiation. Fructose at levels found in apple juice significantly increased ascorbic acid degradation while glucose and sucrose did not. Factors identified that accelerate ascorbic acid degradation may at least partially explain why ascorbic acid degradation occurred more rapidly in UV‐treated apple juice than in the 0.5% malic acid model system. Ascorbic acid degradation continued after UV treatments during dark storage. Storage decreases were faster at higher initial UV dose levels and higher storage temperature.

The absence of reliable estimates of distributions of antioxidants in food 
emulsions hinders the development of a useful method for comparing the 
efficiencies of antioxidants. Here we describe the application of a pseudophase 
kinetic model, originally developed for homogeneous microemulsions, to the 
determination of distribution constants of tert-butylhydroquinone, TBHQ, in a 
fluid, opaque, model food emulsion composed of the nonionic emulsifier 
C(12)E(6), octane, and water. This kinetic method should be applicable to a wide 
variety of charged and uncharged antioxidants in emulsions composed of charged 
and uncharged emulsifiers. The distribution constants for partitioning of TBHQ 
between the oil and surfactant film regions, K(O)(I), and the aqueous and 
surfactant film regions, K(W)(I), were obtained by fitting changes in 
first-order rate constants, k(obs), with emulsifier volume fraction for the 
reaction of 4-hexadecyl-2,6-dimethylbenzenediazonium ion, 16-ArN(2)(+), with 
TBHQ. The rate of formation of the reduced arene product 
hexadecyl-2,6-dimethylbenzene, 16-ArH, was followed by HPLC. About 90% of the 
TBHQ is in the surfactant film at about 2% volume fraction of C(12)E(6), which 
suggests that this region may be the primary site of antioxidant activity for 
neutral phenolic antioxidants.

Roasted barley is traditionally valued as a tea ingredient for its flavor and 
health-promoting benefits, which are governed by steeping and roasting 
conditions. This study investigated the effects of particle size (>4.0 mm (S0), 
1.0-4.0 mm (S1), 0.5-1.0 mm (S2), 0.25-0.5 mm (S3), 0.125-0.25 mm (S4), and 
<0.125 mm (S5)) on the release patterns of constituents, as well as the 
antioxidant and lipolysis inhibitory properties of black highland barley (BHB) 
roasted at different temperatures (180-240°C) during tea infusion preparation. 
Results revealed that constituent leaching generally increased with decreasing 
steeping particle size, with β-glucan, free glucose, and polyphenols peaking at 
S4, but total sugar and protein at S5. The release levels of constituents during 
steeping were mainly governed by roasting temperature, with BHB roasted above 
200°C significantly enhancing their contents in the tea infusions (p < 0.05), 
whereas roasting at 240°C resulted in decreases in β-glucan, protein, and free 
glucose. Consequently, the steeping cycle and color characteristics were shaped 
by the interactive effect of grinding and roasting. Relatively higher radical 
scavenging activities were observed in tea infusions at S4, with the highest 
rates found in those roasted at 240°C. However, tea infusions of BHB roasted at 
200°C exhibited the strongest lipolysis inhibition. These results suggested that 
steeping at S4 was preferred for roasted black highland barley (RBHB) beverages, 
with functional benefits primarily determined by roasting temperature.

Herbal medicine and its derived products have been used in the medicine and 
nutraceutical sectors for the treatment of human disorders and associated 
secondary complications. Plant-derived products play an important role in our 
daily life due to their medicinal properties and pharmacological activities. The 
attention of scientists to natural products has increased due to their 
significant biological activities. Flavonoids represent one of the most 
important phytocompounds present in the higher plants, common fruits, 
vegetables, herbs, wine, juices, and dried fruits. Flavonoids exert potent 
antioxidant activity by blocking and scavenging free radicals. Cirsilineol, also 
called 4',5-dihydroxy-3',6,7-trimethoxyflavone, is an active phytochemical of 
Artemisia vestita, Artemisia monosperma, Artemisia asiatica, and Agrostis 
gigantea. Medicinal importance and pharmacological activities of cirsilineol 
have been investigated in the present work with their analytical aspects in 
order to know the biological importance of cirsilineol in medicine. Literature 
data on cirsilineol were collected and analyzed in the present work to study its 
therapeutic potential against various human disorders and associated secondary 
complications. Scientific data were collected from Google, Google Scholar, 
PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus and analyzed in the present work using the 
term herbal medicine, flavonoid and cirsilineol. Medicinal plants containing a 
significant amount of cirsilineol have biological applications in medicine due 
to their pharmacological activities. This present work signifies the biological 
importance of cirsilineol in medicine as it has antiproliferative, 
gastroprotective, anti-Helicobacter pylori, anti-diabetic and anti-oxidant 
activities. Further therapeutic effectiveness of cirsilineol against different 
types of cancers, including breast carcinoma and lung carcinoma, has been 
discussed in the present work. The biological importance of cirsilineol against 
allergic rhinitis, inflammation, coronavirus, immune system, renal cellular 
membrane and protein glycation has also been discussed in the present work. 
However, the importance of analytical methods for the isolation and 
identification of cirsilineol in medicine has also been analyzed. This work 
aimed to summarize the health-beneficial aspects of cirsilineol in medicine 
which will be beneficial to explore the further therapeutic effectiveness of 
cirsilineol for the treatment of various forms of human disorders.

Volatile sulfur compounds are recognized as primary contributors to the 
off-flavors in many heat-sterilized juices, affecting their commercial appeal. 
The influence of three muskmelon pectin fractions on the formation of volatile 
sulfur compounds via the Methionine-sugars Maillard reaction was investigated. 
Kinetic analysis demonstrated that the formation of methanthiol, dimethyl 
disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, and methional conforms to a zero-order reaction. 
Moreover, all pectin fractions significantly reduced the formation of volatile 
sulfur compounds by lowering the concentrations of 3-deoxyglucosone and 
methylglyoxal. Physicochemical analysis of pectin revealed that thermal 
processing increased the content of galacturonic acid and unsaturated uronides 
in both water-soluble and chelated-soluble pectin while reducing their molecular 
weight. This suggests that thermal degradation products within the 
homogalacturonan region participate in the Maillard reaction. These findings 
offer new insights into the potential of pectin as a natural strategy to 
mitigate the formation of undesirable volatile sulfur compounds in 
heat-sterilized juices.

BACKGROUND: Consumer demand for products rich in phytochemicals is increasing as 
a result of greater awareness of their potential health benefits. However, 
processed products are stored for long-term and the phytochemicals are 
susceptible to degradation during storage. The objective of this study was to 
assess the storage effects on phytochemicals in thermally processed blueberries. 
Thermally processed canned berries and juice/puree were analysed for 
phytochemicals during their long-term storage.
RESULTS: The phytochemical retention of thermally processed blueberries during 
storage was not influenced by production system (conventional versus organic). 
During 13 months of storage, total anthocyanins, total phenolics and total 
antioxidant activity in canned blueberry solids decreased by up to 86, 69 and 
52% respectively. In canned blueberry syrup, total anthocyanins and total 
antioxidant activity decreased by up to 68 and 15% respectively, while total 
phenolic content increased by up to 117%. Similar trends in phytochemical 
content were observed in juice/puree stored for 4 months. The extent of changes 
in phytochemicals of thermally processed blueberries during storage was 
significantly influenced by blanching.
CONCLUSION: Long-term storage of thermally processed blueberries had varying 
degrees of influence on degradation of total anthocyanins, total phenolics and 
total antioxidant activity. Blanching before thermal processing helped to 
preserve the phytochemicals during storage of blueberries.

In this study, a new method was developed for feruloylated oligosaccharides 
(FOs) enzymatic hydrolysis extraction from corn bran, using ionic liquids (ILs) 
as the solvent for the depolymerization of dietary fiber. The 
1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate [Amim]Ac was the most effective IL among the 
eight evaluated ILs, which leads to a 1.5 times-higher total FOs content as 
compared with conventional non-pretreatment extraction. The optimum condition 
acquired by response surface methodology was 194.31 min, 143.08 °C, solid-liquid 
ratio of 1:20, and the concentration of 18.65%. The depolymerized biomass was 
characterized using SEM, FTIR and CLSM. The results confirmed that [Amim]Ac 
mainly enters the cavity among the lignocellulose and breaks linkages to release 
FOs by exposure binding sites of hemicellulose to hydrolysis enzymes. In 
particular, the linkages between ferulic acid and hemicellulose were not 
affected by ILs pretreatment. This study provides an efficient method for the 
preparation of conjugated phenols from lignocellulose.

Cocoa beans are a well-known source of antioxidant polyphenols. Especially 
individual oligomeric proanthocyanidins demonstrated a significant contribution 
to the total antioxidant activity of cocoa compared to monomeric compounds. An 
NP-HPLC-online-DPPH assay was developed for separating the homologous series of 
oligomeric proanthocyanidins and the simultaneous assessment of their 
antioxidant capacity in relation to the degree of polymerization (DP). The 
present study describes the influence of the different stages of a lab-scale 
chocolate manufacturing process on the content of oligomeric proanthocyanidins 
and their antioxidant capacity. The sum of the total proanthocyanidin content (∑ 
DP1-DP13) decreased from 30mg epicatechin equivalents per gram non-fat dry 
matter in raw fresh cocoa beans to 6mg epicatechin equivalents per gram in the 
final chocolate. The antioxidant capacity decreased accordingly from 25mg 
epicatechin equivalents per gram non-fat dry matter in raw fresh cocoa beans to 
4mg/g in the final chocolate product.

The effect of the fermented matrix on the color and the stability of 
anthocyanins contained in strawberry (Fragaria ananassa D.) and highbush 
blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) preparations for fruit yogurts, as well as 
soy-based (Glycine max L. Merr.) and bean-based (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) yogurt 
alternatives, stored for 8 weeks, was evaluated. To produce the fermented bean 
matrix, germinated seeds of white and black beans were used. The obtained 
fermented matrices had similar pH levels, while the soy-based and black 
bean-based yogurt alternatives were characterized by their high content of 
isoflavone aglycones and phenolic acids. The degradation of anthocyanins in 
strawberry and blueberry fermented products during storage followed first-order 
reaction kinetics. Significant differences were found depending on the fermented 
plant-based matrix. The fermented soy-based matrix demonstrated the highest T1/2 
values for total anthocyanins (26.3 and 88.8 weeks for strawberry and blueberry 
products, respectively), whereas the yogurts exhibited the lowest values (13.3 
and 49.3 weeks for strawberry and blueberry products, respectively). In the 
comparison of anthocyanin degradation during the storage of bean-based products, 
the pigments in the matrix obtained from fermented black beans showed better 
stability. During storage, the loss of anthocyanins was higher in strawberry 
products than in blueberry products, particularly with respect to malvidin and 
petunidin derivatives and acylated anthocyanins, which exhibited high stability. 
The total color difference (ΔE*) of blueberry plant-based products after an 8 
week storage period ranged from 1.1 to 1.5. This data suggests that the addition 
of a coloring ingredient for industrial production may not be required.

Anthocyanins are present in human diet due to their wide occurrence in fruits 
and beverages. They possess antioxidant activities and could be involved in 
several health effects. The aim of this study was to investigate anthocyanin 
metabolism and distribution in the digestive area organs (stomach, jejunum and 
liver) and kidney, as well as a target tissue (brain) in rats fed with a 
blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.) anthocyanin-enriched diet for 15 days. 
Identification and quantification of anthocyanin metabolites was carried out by 
HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC-DAD, respectively. The stomach exhibited only native 
blackberry anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-pentose), while 
in other organs (jejunum, liver, and kidney) native and methylated anthocyanins 
as well as conjugated anthocyanidins (cyanidin and peonidin monoglucuronides) 
were identified. Proportions of anthocyanin derivatives differed according to 
the organ considered, with the liver presenting the highest proportion of 
methylated forms. Jejunum and plasma also contained aglycone forms. In the 
brain, total anthocyanin content (blackberry anthocyanins and peonidin 
3-O-glucoside) reached 0.25 +/- 0.05 nmol/g of tissue (n = 6). The urinary 
excretion of total anthocyanins was low (0.19 +/- 0.02% of the ingested amount). 
Thus, organs of the digestive area indicated a metabolic pathway of anthocyanins 
with enzymatic conversions (methylation and/or glucurono-conjugation). Moreover, 
following consumption of an anthocyanin-rich diet, anthocyanins enter the brain.

Physicochemical analysis of processed strained product was performed on 10 
carrot genotypes grown in Texas (TX) and Georgia (GA). Carrots from GA 
experienced hail damage during growth, resulting in damage to their tops. 
Measurements included pH, moisture, soluble phenolics, total carotenoids, 
sugars, organic acids, and isocoumarin (6-MM). Sensory analysis was conducted 
using a trained panel to evaluate relationships between chemical and sensory 
attributes of the genotypes and in carrots spiked with increasing levels of 
6-MM. Preharvest stress conditions in GA carrots seemed to elicit a phytoalexic 
response, producing compounds that impacted the perception of bitter and sour 
flavors. Spiking 6-MM into strained carrots demonstrated the role bitter 
compounds have in lowering sweetness scores while increasing the perception of 
sour flavor. Screening fresh carrots for the phytoalexin 6-MM has the potential 
to significantly improve the sensory quality of processed products.

The phytochemical fingerprinting that add to the nutritional and nutraceutical 
value of the fruits during the ripening stages is beneficial for human 
consumption. Therefore, ripening-dependent changes in phytochemical content and 
antioxidant activities of mango (Mangifera indica L.) cultivar Dusehri at 
various ripening stages were evaluated. Bioassays for phenolic content, 
flavonoid content, antioxidant activities, and UHPLC/MS for phytochemical 
profiling was performed at five ripening stages (RSI-RSV). Total phenolic 
contents significantly increased from 4.25 to 13.08 µg GAE/mg extract upto stage 
III and non-significant decrease was observed thereafter. Flavonoid contents 
varied between 1.16 and 1.23 µg QE/mg extract. DPPH based free radical 
scavenging activity increased (41.07-52.33%) from stage I to stage V while FRSP 
based analysis showed decrease (53.01-27.61 µg TE/mg extract) in activity from 
stage I to stage V. Total antioxidant capacity and total reducing power 
potential of pulp extract gradually increased towards mango ripening stages. A 
non-significant change in amylase inhibition was observed from stage I to stage 
III that significantly dropped in stage IV and V. UHPLC analysis depicted that 
aconitic, methylisocitric, 2,4,6-Hydroxy benzoic acid and beta glucogallin, poly 
phenols, 1-Methylxanthine, 3-Furicacid, Heptenoic acid and many others are 
present at different ripening stages of dusehri mango. PCA analysis and 
hierarchal analysis show Stage I & II clustering while stages III-V make 
separate cluster. These phytochemiclas are responsible for many health benefits. 
The study concludes that dusehri mango have significant antioxidative capacity 
that are due to diverse phytochemicals.

Macroalgae are valuable natural sources for bioprospection and the development 
of raw materials applicable to the nutrition, health, and agriculture 
industries. To build a basis for the sustainable use of marine organisms from 
the Colombian Caribbean, a preliminary study was conducted focusing on known 
functional compounds in two genera of macroalgae, including the species 
Acanthophora spicifera (Rhodophyta), Sargassum ramifolium, and Sargassum 
fluitans (Ochrophyta). This study included the extraction and identification of 
polysaccharides using ultrafiltration, nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR), 
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and size exclusion 
chromatography (SEC); fatty acids by gas chromatographic (GC) profiling; and 
phenolic composition and antioxidant activity by complementary semi-quantitative 
methods (ABTS, DPPH, FRAP, and ORAC assays). Carrageenan-type polysaccharides 
were detected in A. spicifera, while alginate and fucoidan types were found in 
S. ramifolium and S. fluitans; palmitic acid was the predominant fatty acid in 
A. spicifera and S. ramifolium, but it was not detected in S. fluitans. S. 
ramifolium showed the highest ABTS, DPPH, and ORAC activities and phenolic 
compounds, while S. fluitans exhibited the highest FRAP activity. This study 
contributes to the chemical knowledge on Colombian macroalgae to establish 
potential applications in various fields, including biomedicine, cosmetics, 
functional foods, and nutraceutical ingredients.

The aim of the present study is to compare three cultivars of prickly pear 
fruits (""Sanguigna"" red, ""Sulfarina"" yellow and ""Muscaredda"" white) regarding 
the quality parameters of antioxidant activity, phenolic compounds, betalains 
and ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Depending on the crop operation, these cultivars 
are represented by ""Agostane"" and ""Bastardoni"" and are located at an altitude 
between 150 and 750 m, above sea level. Their antioxidant activity was evaluated 
by ORAC assay. Total phenolic compounds, betalains and ascorbic acid recovered 
from pulp juice, were determined by a spectrophotometric analysis. The results 
indicate that the different cultivars of prickly pear possess antioxidant 
activity in function of the type of the adopted practice. These fruits were 
derived from the practice of scozzolatura, by dropping the berries to encourage 
a second bloom of the plant. Among the ""Bastardoni"", the ""Sulfarina"" possesses 
the highest antioxidant activity.

This investigation evaluated the content and profile of flavanoid and phenolic 
acid compounds present in nine Vaccinium species that included domestic 
blueberry cultivars and sample collections from undomesticated colonies. The 
study was focused in two areas of inquiry. The first involved extracting and 
analyzing the berries for total phenolics (TPH), total anthocyanins (ACY), and 
the antioxidant capacity. Vaccinium species differ in their polyphenolic 
content, and these high TPH and ACY levels are correlated to their antioxidant 
capacity. Second, berry extracts were analyzed by high-performance liquid 
chromatography equipped with photodiode array and mass spectrometric detectors 
to determine the content and profile of selected bioactive compounds. The 
flavanoid analytes of interest included the anthocyanidins, flavan-3-ols, and 
flavonol aglycons, as well as specific phenolic acid components. This 
semicomprehensive analysis begins to characterize the phytochemical profiles and 
illustrates the differences in the content of polyphenolic compounds present 
within these Vaccinium species.

Estimation of curcumin intake in Korea based on the Korea National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (2008-2012).

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Turmeric and its active component curcumin have received 
considerable attention due to their many recognized biological activities. 
Turmeric has been commonly used in food preparation and herbal remedies in South 
Asia, leading to a high consumption rate of curcumin in this region. However, 
the amount of curcumin in the Korean diet has not yet been estimated, where 
turmeric is not a common ingredient.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: This study utilized the combined data sets obtained from the 
Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted from 2008 to 
2012 in order to estimate the curcumin intake in the Korean diet. The mean 
intake of curcumin was estimated from the amount of curcumin-containing foods 
(curry powder and ready-made curry) consumed using reported curcumin content in 
commercial turmeric and curry powders.
RESULTS: Only 0.06% of Koreans responded that they consumed foods containing 
curcumin in a given day, and 40% of them were younger than 20 years of age. 
Curcumin-containing foods were largely prepared at home (72.9%) and a 
significant proportion (20.4%, nearly twice that of all other foods) was 
consumed as school and workplace meals. The estimated mean turmeric intake was 
about 0.47 g/day corresponding to 2.7-14.8 mg curcumin, while the average curry 
powder consumption was about 16.4 g, which gave rise to curcumin intake in the 
range of 8.2-95.0 mg among individuals who consumed curcumin. The difference in 
estimated curcumin intake by using the curcumin content in curry powder and 
turmeric may reflect that curry powder manufactured in Korea might contain 
higher amounts of other ingredients such as flour, and an estimation based on 
the curcumin content in the turmeric might be more acceptable.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the amount of curcumin that can be obtained from the Korean 
diet in a day is 2.7-14.8 mg, corresponding to nearly one fourth of the daily 
curcumin intake in South Asia, although curcumin is rarely consumed in Korea.

Recently, cultivated ""Qi-Nan"" (CQN) agarwood has emerged as a new high-quality 
agarwood in the agarwood market owing to its similar characteristics, such as 
high content of resin and richness in two 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone derivatives, 
2-(2-phenylethyl)chromone (59) and 2-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]chromone (60), to 
the wild harvested ""Qi-Nan"" (WQN) agarwood. In this study, we compared the 
chemical constituents and fragrant components of two types of WQN agarwood from 
A. agallocha Roxb. and A. sinensis, respectively, with CQN agarwood and ordinary 
agarwood varieties. Additionally, we analyzed different samples of WQN agarwood 
and CQN agarwood by GC-MS, which revealed several noteworthy differences between 
WQN and CQN agarwood. The chemical diversity of WQN was greater than that of CQN 
agarwood. The content of (59) and (60) was higher in CQN agarwood than in WQN 
agarwood. For the sesquiterpenes, the richness and diversity of sesquiterpenes 
in WQN agarwood, particularly guaiane and agarofuran sesquiterpenes, were higher 
than those in CQN. Moreover, guaiane-furans sesquiterpenes were only detected by 
GC-MS in WQN agarwood of A. sinensis and could be a chemical marker for the WQN 
agarwood of A. sinensis. In addition, we summarized the odor descriptions of the 
constituents and established the correlation of scents and chemical constituents 
in the agarwood.

Phytoestrogens may play a role in hormone-related diseases such as cancer, but 
epidemiological and clinical data are conflicting in part due to inadequate 
databases used in intake estimation. A database of nine phytoestrogens in foods 
relevant to Western diets was developed to more accurately estimate intakes. 
Foods (N = 121) available in Ontario, Canada were prepared as commonly consumed 
and analyzed for isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, glycitein, formononetin), 
lignans (secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, pinoresinol, lariciresinol), and 
coumestan (coumestrol) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. Data 
were presented on an as is (wet) basis per 100 g and per serving. Food groups 
with decreasing levels of total phytoestrogens per 100 g are nuts and oilseeds, 
soy products, cereals and breads, legumes, meat products, and other processed 
foods that may contain soy, vegetables, fruits, alcoholic, and nonalcoholic 
beverages. Soy products contain the highest amounts of isoflavone, followed by 
legumes, meat products and other processed foods, cereals and breads, nuts and 
oilseeds, vegetables, alcoholic beverages, fruits, and nonalcoholic beverages. 
Decreasing amounts of lignans are found in nuts and oilseeds, cereals and 
breads, legumes, fruits, vegetables, soy products, processed foods, alcoholic, 
and nonalcoholic beverages. The richest sources of specific phytoestrogens, 
including coumestrol, were identified. The database will improve phytoestrogen 
intake estimation in future epidemiological and clinical studies particularly in 
Western populations.

Anthocyanins are the most abundant phenolic compounds, widely distributed in 
fruits and vegetables, and exhibit potent antioxidant capacity. Humans ingest a 
significant amount of anthocyanins in the daily diet. The objective of the 
current study was to examine human absorption and metabolism of black raspberry 
anthocyanins when administered at high doses (2.69 +/- 0.085 g/day). Ten healthy 
men consumed 45 g of freeze-dried black raspberries daily for 1 week. Urine 
samples were collected over a 12 h period in 4 h intervals at day 1 and day 7. 
Urinary anthocyanins were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography 
coupled to a photodiode array detector and a tandem mass spectrometer using 
precursor ion and product ion analyses. Anthocyanins were excreted in intact 
forms and metabolized into methylated derivatives in human urine. The urinary 
excretion of anthocyanins reached a maximum concentration (1091.8 +/- 1081.3 
pmol/L, n = 10) during the 4-8 h period after black raspberry ingestion. As 
compared to the anthocyanin distribution in black raspberries, urinary cyanidin 
3-xylosylrutinoside was detected at a higher concentration than that of 
cyanidin-3-rutinoside.

We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the antioxidant, anti-obesity, 
anti-diabetic, and anti-glycation activities associated with the consumption of 
broccoli, red cabbage, alfalfa, and buckwheat seeds. Additionally, we explored 
the relationship between these biological activities and the profiles of amino 
acids, polyphenols, and organic acids identified in the seeds. Our findings 
demonstrated that red cabbage, broccoli, and buckwheat extracts exhibited 
significantly higher antioxidant potential compared to the alfalfa extract. 
Moreover, buckwheat displayed the most significant capacity for inhibiting 
alpha-glucosidase. Remarkably, broccoli and red cabbage demonstrated substantial 
anti-glycation and lipase inhibitory potentials. We identified the presence of 
amino acids, polyphenols, and organic acids in the extracts through untargeted 
metabolomics analysis. Correlation analysis revealed that pyroglutamic acid 
positively correlated with all the investigated functional properties. Most 
polyphenols made positive contributions to the functional properties, with the 
exception of ferulic acid, which displayed a negative correlation with all 
tested biological activities. Furthermore, gluconic acid and arabinonic acid 
among the organic acids identified displayed a positive correlation with all the 
functional properties. These results strongly support the anti-diabetic, 
anti-obesity, and anti-glycation potential of red cabbage, broccoli, and 
buckwheat seeds.

This study reports tannin contents of various tea (19), beer (6) and wine (6) 
samples, produced or sold in Turkey under different brand names. Determinations 
were carried out by employing a previously reported UV-vis spectrophotometric 
method. The standard addition procedure was also compared to the direct 
determination procedure and found to be more reliable. The tannin contents of 
hot water extracts of tea, tea bag and herbal tea samples ranged between 
6.20-8.33, 8.03-6.59 and 2.76-6.54 percent (w/w) respectively. Tannin contents 
of beer and wine samples determined without extraction were found ranging 
between 66.36-77.26 and 67.18-107.62 micrograms/mL respectively. Iron contents 
of analysed wine samples were also found ranging between 0.36 and 10.33 ppm by 
AAS and no relation is found between tannin and iron contents.

The study explores the effect of pre-fermentation heat treatment (PFHT) on the 
flavor and metabolomic profiles of kiwi wine (KW) derived from three kiwifruit 
cultivars. Six KW groups were involved, namely with/without PFHT for green 
(GWH/GW), yellow (YWH/YW), and red (RWH/RW) kiwifruit. E-tongue analysis 
effectively distinguished the taste profiles across these KW groups, identifying 
significant variations. A total of 97 volatile components were characterized 
using GC-MS and GC-IMS, 12 of them were identified as key volatile compounds 
based on a combination of t-tests (p < 0.05) and variable importance in 
projection (VIP) scores. GC-MS and GC-IMS results demonstrated that PFHT 
significantly altered volatile profiles, specifically decreasing ester content 
while increasing aldehyde levels in comparison to untreated samples. 
Furthermore, 71 non-volatile compounds were identified by 1H-NMR, with 10 key 
metabolites (p < 0.05, VIP > 1) contributing to the observed differences. PFHT 
notably influenced metabolomic profiles, particularly in carbohydrate and 
organic acid levels, displaying cultivar-specific differences. Green 
kiwifruit-derived KW showed the most pronounced sensitivity to PFHT, as 
reflected in both flavor and metabolic profiles. These findings offer valuable 
insights for optimizing KW production processes and scaling up industrial 
production.

The phenolic profile of strawberry fruits (Fragaria x ananassa Duch., Rosaceae) 
was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array 
detection. A peak displaying retention time and UV spectral data identical to 
those of phloridzin (phloretin 2'-O-beta-d-glucoside), a dihydrochalcone 
glucoside so far considered characteristic of apples, was monitored. For further 
characterization, crude extracts of strawberries were purified on polyamide, and 
the target compound was isolated by preparative and analytical HPLC. Structure 
elucidation was performed on the basis of APCI- and ESI-MS in the negative ion 
mode as well as by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy using authentic phloridzin for 
comparison. The d-configuration of the sugar moiety was established by HPLC 
analysis of the corresponding acyclic 
1-deoxy-1-(N-acetyl-alpha-methylbenzylamino)alditol acetate. Apart from its 
chemotaxonomic relevance, this first report on the occurrence of phloridzin in 
strawberries is of particular interest for the authenticity control of 
strawberry products such as juices, jams, and fruit preparations since 
phloridzin has so far been used for the detection of fraudulent admixtures.

The phenolic compounds of 25 peach, nectarine, and plum cultivars were studied 
and quantified by HPLC-DAD-ESIMS. Hydroxycinnamates, procyanidins, flavonols, 
and anthocyanins were detected and quantified. White and yellow flesh nectarines 
and peaches, and yellow and red plums, were analyzed at two different maturity 
stages with consideration of both peel and flesh tissues. HPLC-MS analyses 
allowed the identification of procyanidin dimers of the B- and A-types, as well 
as the presence of procyanidin trimers in plums. As a general rule, the peel 
tissues contained higher amounts of phenolics, and anthocyanins and flavonols 
were almost exclusively located in this tissue. No clear differences in the 
phenolic content of nectarines and peaches were detected or between white flesh 
and yellow flesh cultivars. There was no clear trend in phenolic content with 
ripening of the different cultivars. Some cultivars, however, had a very high 
phenolic content. For example, the white flesh nectarine cultivar Brite Pearl 
(350-460 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 430-550 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) and 
the yellow flesh cv. Red Jim (180-190 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 210-330 mg/kg 
procyanidins in flesh), contained 10 times more phenolics than cultivars such as 
Fire Pearl (38-50 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 23-30 mg/kg procyanidins in 
flesh). Among white flesh peaches, cultivars Snow King (300-320 mg/kg 
hydroxycinnamates and 660-695 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) and Snow Giant 
(125-130 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 520-540 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) showed 
the highest content. The plum cultivars Black Beaut and Angeleno were especially 
rich in phenolics.

Cocoa is a food rich in polyphenols, mainly the flavonoid procyanidins and 
flavan-3-ols. The improvement of the cardiovascular function in humans upon 
cocoa consumption has been specifically linked to the presence of flavan-3-ol 
derived metabolites in plasma, especially epicatechin glucuronide. In this 
context, a flavonoid-enriched cocoa-derived product could potentially exert 
stronger health benefits. The aim of the present study was to obtain a cocoa 
powder with a higher flavonoid content (mainly enriched in monomer compounds) 
and assess its flavonoid bioavailability in humans. For this purpose, an 
unfermented, nonroasted, and blanch-treated cocoa powder (A) was obtained. The 
powder contained four times more procyanidins than a conventional (B) cocoa 
powder. Powder A contained eight times more epicatechin and procyanidin B2 than 
powder B. Cocoa milk drinks were prepared with powder A (MDA) and B (MDB). The 
bioavailability of flavonoids in both drinks was assessed in a crossover 
intervention with healthy volunteers. The content of epicatechin glucuronide, 
the main metabolite detected in plasma, was five-fold higher upon consumption of 
MDA as compared with MDB. The urinary excretion of metabolites, mainly methyl 
epicatechin sulfate, was higher upon MDA consumption as compared with MDB, 
ranging from two- to 12-fold higher depending on the metabolite. These results, 
together with previous reports regarding the cardiovascular benefits linked to 
the presence of procyanidin metabolites in plasma, suggest that further clinical 
trials to validate the health benefits of a flavonoid-enriched cocoa powder are 
warranted.

As a cornerstone of Chinese culinary and medicinal heritage, Huajiao owes its 
multifaceted bioactivities predominantly to amide compounds. However, the 
intricate interplay between cultivar-specific amide profiles and 
processing-induced metabolic shifts remains poorly characterized. This study 
employed UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics to systematically and 
initially characterize the amide metabolomes of seven market-dominant Huajiao 
cultivars and evaluate the effects of three drying-methods on amide retention. 
Cultivar-specific metabolic disparities were pronounced: Hancheng cultivar 
exhibited the richest amide repertoire (49 amides), with discriminant biomarkers 
(sylvamide) enabling robust cultivar differentiation. Machine-drying (49 amides) 
outperformed sun-drying (47 amides) and shade-drying (44 amides), highlighting 
its superior capacity to mitigate thermal degradation. Comparative extraction 
profiling revealed that oil-phase-extraction (53 amides) outperformed 
aqueous-phase-extraction (51 amides) in amides enrichment, underscoring 
solvent-dependent extraction efficiency. Multivariate analyses corroborated 
significant metabolic divergence among cultivars and processing groups, 
emphasizing the interactive effects of genotype, environment, and processing on 
amide accumulation. This work offers a metabolomics-based framework for Huajiao 
quality standardization, promoting cultivar-specific processing and solvent 
optimization to boost bioactive retention and industrial application.

Crude phenolic extracts (PE) have been obtained from naturally bearing Spanish 
extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) showing different polyphenol families such as 
secoiridoids, phenolic alcohols, lignans, and flavones. EVOO-derived complex 
phenols (especially from the Arbequina variety olive) have been shown to 
suppress cell growth of SW480 and HT29 human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines. 
Inhibition of proliferation by EVOO-PE Arbequina variety extract was accompanied 
by apoptosis in both colon-cancer-cell lines and a limited G₂M cell-cycle arrest 
in the case of SW480 cells. The metabolized compounds from EVOO-PE in culture 
medium and cytoplasm of both cell lines were analyzed using nano-liquid 
chromatography (nanoLC) coupled with electrospray ionization-time-of-flight-mass 
spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS). The results showed many phenolic compounds and their 
metabolites both in the culture medium as well as in the cytoplasm. The main 
compounds identified from EVOO-PE were hydroxylated luteolin and decarboxymethyl 
oleuropein aglycone.

Consumption of flavonoid-rich foods and beverages is thought to reduce the risk 
of cardiovascular diseases. Whereas the biological activities of flavonoids have 
been characterized in vitro, there are no clear experimental data demonstrating 
that chronic dietary intake and intestinal absorption of flavonoids actually 
protects the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury. We tested whether 
long-term consumption of specific flavonoids (anthocyanins) included in normal 
food could render the heart of rats more resistant to myocardial infarction. 
Maize kernels that differed specifically in their accumulation of anthocyanins 
were used to prepare rodent food in which anthocyanins were either present or 
absent. Male Wistar rats were fed the anthocyanin-rich (ACN-rich) or the 
anthocyanin-free (ACN-free) diet for a period of 8 wk. Anthocyanins were 
significantly absorbed and detected in the blood and urine of only rats fed the 
ACN-rich diet. In Langendorff preparations, the hearts of rats fed the ACN-rich 
diet were more resistant to regional ischemia and reperfusion insult. Moreover, 
on an in vivo model of coronary occlusion and reperfusion, infarct size was 
reduced in rats that ate the ACN-rich diet than in those that consumed the 
ACN-free diet (P < 0.01). Cardioprotection was associated with increased 
myocardial glutathione levels, suggesting that dietary anthocyanins might 
modulate cardiac antioxidant defenses. Our findings suggest important potential 
health benefits of foods rich in anthocyanins and emphasize the need to develop 
anthocyanin-rich functional foods with protective activities for promoting human 
health.

Microgreens are young plants of various vegetables, medicinal and aromatic 
plants, cereals and edible wild plants that were first associated with nouvelle 
cuisine as decoration in dishes due to their attractive appearance and strong 
flavor. Recently, they have become more sought after in the market due to their 
high nutritional value. This is due to the growing interest of consumers in a 
healthy lifestyle that includes a varied diet with emphasis on fresh, functional 
foods. Nowadays, commercial production of microgreens is shifting to modern 
hydroponic systems due to their numerous advantages, such as accelerated plant 
growth and biomass production, earlier harvesting, and more production cycles 
that positively affect yield and chemical composition. Therefore, the aim of 
this study was to determine the content of specialized metabolites and 
antioxidant capacity of hydroponically grown alfalfa (Medicago sativa) cv. 
'Kangaroo', yellow beet (Beta vulgaris var. conditiva) cv. 'Yellow Lady', red 
cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. rubra) cv. 'Red Carpet', and fennel 
(Foeniculum vulgare) cv. 'Aganarpo' microgreens. The highest content of total 
phenols (408.03 mg GAE/100 g fw), flavonoids (214.47 mg GAE/100 g fw), 
non-flavonoids (193.56 mg GAE/100 g fw) and ascorbic acid (74.94 mg/100 g fw) 
was found in fennel microgreens. The highest content of all analyzed chlorophyll 
pigments (Chl_a 0.536 mg/g fw, Chl_b 0.248 mg/g fw, and TCh 0.785 mg/g fw) was 
found in alfalfa microgreens. However, in addition to alfalfa, high levels of 
chlorophyll a (0.528 mg/g fw), total chlorophyll (0.713 mg/g fw) and the highest 
level of total carotenoids (0.196 mg/g fw) were also detected in fennel 
microgreens. The results suggest that microgreens grown on perlite in floating 
hydroponics have high nutritional potential as a functional food important for 
human health and therefore could be recommended for daily diet.

Coffee pulp, a nutrient-rich by-product, holds untapped nutraceutical potential 
but requires postharvest optimization. This study evaluated how ripening stage 
and drying method jointly modulate bioactive compounds in Coffea arabica var. 
Catimor pulp. FT-IR spectroscopy, HPLC-DAD, and antioxidant assays, coupled with 
multivariate analysis, revealed drying as the primary driver of compositional 
changes. FT-IR PCA (97.5 % variance in PC1) distinguished freeze-dried from 
thermally treated samples, while key VIP bands associated with lignin and 
structural carbohydrates, together with bioactive profiles (chlorogenic acid, 
ABTS, caffeine), revealed thermal degradation as a unifying process shaped by 
ripening stage. Drying × ripening effects modulated all variables except 
caffeine, which declined with ripening. Thermal treatments reduced phenolics, 
DPPH, trigonelline, and 5-CQA, with greater losses in overripe pulp. ABTS 
increased with roasting, while peak levels occurred in ripe freeze-dried 
samples. These results underscore the need for ripening-specific drying 
protocols to optimize coffee pulp's functional quality.

We aimed to analyze the chemical compositions in Arabica coffee bean extracts, 
assess the relevant antioxidant and iron-chelating activities in coffee extracts 
and instant coffee, and evaluate the toxicity in roasted coffee. Coffee beans 
were extracted using boiling, drip-filtered and espresso brewing methods. 
Certain phenolics were investigated including trigonelline, caffeic acid and 
their derivatives, gallic acid, epicatechin, chlorogenic acid (CGA) and their 
derivatives, p-coumaroylquinic acid, p-coumaroyl glucoside, the rutin and 
syringic acid that exist in green and roasted coffee extracts, along with 
dimethoxycinnamic acid, caffeoylarbutin and cymaroside that may be present in 
green coffee bean extracts. Different phytochemicals were also detected in all 
of the coffee extracts. Roasted coffee extracts and instant coffees exhibited 
free-radical scavenging properties in a dose-dependent manner, for which drip 
coffee was observed to be the most effective (p < 0.05). All coffee extracts, 
instant coffee varieties and CGA could effectively bind ferric ion in a 
concentration-dependent manner resulting in an iron-bound complex. Roasted 
coffee extracts were neither toxic to normal mononuclear cells nor breast cancer 
cells. The findings indicate that phenolics, particularly CGA, could effectively 
contribute to the iron-chelating and free-radical scavenging properties observed 
in coffee brews. Thus, coffee may possess high pharmacological value and could 
be utilized as a health beverage.

In the present study a simple and highly sensitive RP-HPLC method has been 
established for simultaneous determination of chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, 
vanillic acid and caffeine in coffee samples. The method has been applied to 
eight different coffees available on the Romanian market which were previously 
analysed concerning the total polyphenols content and antioxidant capacity. 
Reduction of the DPPH radical was used to determine the antioxidant capacity of 
the coffee extracts while the total polyphenols content was determined by 
spectrophotometry (Folin Ciocalteu's method). The total polyphenols content 
ranged from 1.98 g GAE/100 g to 4.19 g GAE/100 g while the caffeine content 
ranged from 1.89 g/100 g to 3.05 g/100 g. A large variability was observed in 
chlorogenic acid content of the investigated coffee samples which ranged between 
0.6 and 2.32 g/100 g.

Rats were fed a grape seed extract (GSE) containing (+)-catechin, 
(-)-epicatechin and dimers, trimers, tetramers and polymeric procyanidins. 
Liver, kidney, brain and gastrointestinal (GI) tract together with plasma, urine 
and faeces were collected over a 24 h period and their flavan-3-ol content was 
analysed by HPLC with tandem mass spectrometry and diode array detection. Small 
amounts of the GSE flavan-3-ols moved out of the stomach and into the 
duodenum/jejunum, and to a greater extent the ileum 1 h after ingestion, and 
into the caecum after 2 h with relatively small amounts being detected in the 
colon after 3 h. The GI tract contained the parent GSE flavan-3-ols and 
procyanidins with only trace amounts of metabolites and there were no 
indications that proanthocyanidins were depolymerised in the GI tract releasing 
monomeric flavan-3-ols. Plasma contained exclusively catechin glucuronides and 
methylated glucuronide metabolites which were also detected in the liver and 
kidneys. These metabolites were also present in urine together with sulphated 
metabolites and low amounts of the procyanidin dimers B1, B2, B3 and B4 as well 
as the trimer C2 and an unknown GSE trimer. The amounts of (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin metabolites excreted in urine relative to the quantity of the 
monomers ingested were 27 and 36 %, respectively, after 24 h. This is similar to 
the levels of urinary excretion reported to occur by other investigators after 
feeding (-)-epicatechin to rats and provides further, albeit indirect, evidence 
that the procyanidin oligomers in the GSE were not depolymerised to monomers to 
any extent after ingestion. No convincing analytical data were obtained for the 
presence of flavan-3-ol metabolites in the brain.

Polyphenolic compounds of apple may play an important role in physiologic 
functions related to human health. Different polyphenolics may have varied 
biological activities including antioxidant activity. The objective of this 
study was to investigate the profiles of polyphenolic compounds in different 
apple varieties and different parts of an apple. The total and individual 
polyphenolics differed significantly among the eight apple cultivars grown in 
Ontario, and the peels had higher concentrations than the flesh. Among the 
tested cultivars, Red Delicious and Northern Spy had the highest concentrations 
and Empire the lowest. Five major polyphenolic groups with a total of 16 
identified individual compounds were found, among which the dihydroxycinnamic 
acid esters, phloretin glycosides, and flavan-3-ols were found in both flesh and 
peel, whereas quercetin glycosides were almost exclusively found in the peel. 
Cyanidin 3-galactoside was unique to and found only in red apple peels. In both 
apple peel and flesh, the predominant group of polyphenolics was the 
procyanidins, followed by quercetin glycosides in the peel and hydroxycinnamic 
acid esters in the flesh. 3-Hydroxyphloretin 2'-xyloglucoside was newly 
identified in apple. The results obtained in this study will further the 
understanding of the polyphenolic composition of apples and their roles in 
health-promoting physiological functions.

Black rice (BR) is beneficial for the health of animals and humans. Herein, we 
investigated the pharmacokinetics of cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), a major 
anthocyanin constituent of BR, in male rats. After its intravenous 
administration, C3G was rapidly distributed throughout the body and disappeared 
from the plasma. Its cumulative urinary excretion accounted for less than 20% of 
the dose administered. After a single dose of BR extract (C3G40) containing C3G 
was orally administered (300 mg C3G/kg body weight), the C3G plasma 
concentration peaked at 30 min and then rapidly declined within 4 h. The extent 
of the cumulative urinary excretion of C3G, together with the area under the 
curve (AUC) of the plasma C3G concentration, indicated a bioavailability of 
approximately 0.5-1.5%. These results suggest that C3G was rapidly absorbed from 
the gastrointestinal tract in rats; however, its plasma concentration was very 
low. We also examined the enhancing effect of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), a 
pungent component of wasabi, on the gastrointestinal absorption of C3G in rats. 
Following the co-administration of C3G with AITC dissolved in PEG200, the 
urinary excretion and AUC of C3G were 4.5- and 2.7-fold higher than those in the 
control group (without AITC) (p<0.01), respectively. This is the first study to 
show that the gastrointestinal absorption of BR anthocyanins is promoted by 
AITC.

Urban vertical agriculture with lighting system can be an alternative green 
infrastructure to increase local food production irrespective of environmental 
and soil conditions. In this system, light quality control can improve the plant 
physiological performance, well as induce metabolic pathways that contribute to 
producing phenolic compounds important to human health. Therefore, this study 
aimed to evaluate the influence of RBW (red, blue and white) and monochromatic 
(red and blue; R and B, respectively) light associated or not with UV-B on 
photosynthetic performance and phenolic compound production in microtomato 
fruits cultivated via vertical agriculture. The experimental design adopted was 
completely randomized, with six replicates illuminated with 300 µmol·m-2·s-1 
light intensities (RBW, RBW + UV, B, B + UV, R, and R + UV), 12 h photoperiod, 
and 3.7 W·m-2 UV-B irradiation for 1 h daily for the physiological evaluations. 
Twenty-six days after the installation, gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence 
and nocturnal breathing were evaluated. Fruits in different ripening stages 
(green, orange, and red) were collected from microtomato plants grown under with 
different light qualities, to evaluate the physiological performance. The 
identification and quantification of the phenolic compound rutin was also 
performed to investigate their metabolic response. This study identified that 
plants grown under B + UV had high photosynthetic rates (A=11.57 µmol·m-2·s-1) 
and the fruits at all maturation stages from plants grown under B and B + UV had 
high rutin content. Meanwhile, the activation of suppressive mechanisms was 
necessary in plants grown under R because of the high nocturnal respiration and 
unregulated quantum yield of the non-photochemical dissipation of the 
photosystem II. These results highlight the importance of selecting light 
wavelength for vegetable cultivation to produce fruits with a high content of 
specialized metabolites that influence color, flavor, and health promotion, 
which is of special interest to farmers using sustainable cropping systems.

Xiaoqinggan black tea is made by filling black tea into fresh citrus peel with 
the pulp removed, followed by sunlighting and low-temperature roasting. However, 
existing studies have not yet systematically analyzed the chemical basis of 
flavor characteristics and in vitro antioxidant activity of Xiaoqinggan black 
tea. In this study, a systematically analysis of Xiaoqinggan black tea, 
including its raw materials (black tea and citrus peel) and constituent parts 
(tea core and outer peel), were conducted by quantifying the functional 
components through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and 
chemometrics, in combination with the electronic tongue and colorimetry assays. 
Additionally, the in vitro antioxidant activity of Xiaoqinggan black tea and its 
related samples were also evaluated through five different assays. The 
multivariate analysis revealed that 30 differential compounds were identified, 
demonstrating their key role in distinguishing the five sample groups. Notably, 
three polyphenols (catechin gallate, taxifolin, kaempferol), six amino acids 
(L-theanine, L-tyrosine, L-valine, L-methionine, L-leucine, l-lysine), and total 
free amino acids served as the dominant factors in unique flavor of Xiaoqinggan 
black tea through the correlation analysis of electronic tongue and differential 
compounds. Chromatic aberration analysis revealed that the tea infusion of 
Xiaoqinggan black tea was more vividly red and bright, and it exhibited a more 
intense flavor. The combined analysis of antioxidative activity and functional 
compounds suggested polyphenols were the main contributors to the high total 
antioxidant activity of Xiaoqinggan black tea. In conclusion, polyphenols and 
amino acids constituted the unique flavor and chromatic characteristics of 
Xiaoqinggan black tea, and provided an important chemical basis for its 
antioxidant activity. This study provides insights for improving tea processing 
and product quality, making it relevant to both the tea industry and scientific 
research.

Hydroxytyrosol is quantitatively and qualitatively the principal phenolic 
antioxidant in olive oil. Recently it was shown that hydroxytyrosol and five 
metabolites were excreted in urine when hydroxytyrosol was dosed intravenously 
or orally in an olive oil solution to rats. The conclusive identification of 
three metabolites of hydroxytyrosol by MS/MS as a monosulfate conjugate, a 
3-O-glucuronide conjugate, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid 
(homovanillic acid) has been established in this investigation. The structural 
configurations of the glucuronide conjugate and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic 
acid were confirmed by (1)H NMR. The radical scavenging potencies of 
homovanillic acid, homovanillic alcohol, hydroxytyrosol, and the metabolites 
were examined with the radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. These studies 
showed them to be potent antioxidants with SC(50) values of 14.8 and 11.4 microM 
for homovanillic acid and homovanillic alcohol, respectively. The 
3-O-glucuronide conjugate was more potent than hydroxytyrosol, with an SC(50) of 
2.3 in comparison to 11.0 microM, and the monosulfate conjugate was almost 
devoid of radical scavenging activity.

The effect of fresh-cutting and subsequent cold storage on phenolic compounds 
from five long-term-stored potato cultivars (Agria, Cara, Liseta, Monalisa, and 
Spunta) was studied. Fresh-cutting induced the biosynthesis of three flavonols, 
which were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESIMS as quercetin 3-rutinoside, quercetin 
3-diglucoside, and quercetin 3-glucosylrutinoside. The flavonols were detected 
after a lag period of 3 days of cold storage. The content ranged from 6 to 14 
mg/100 g of fresh weight depending on the cultivar after 6 days of storage. 
Chlorogenic acid as the main caffeic acid derivative and the amino acids 
tyrosine and tryptophan were also quantified. The effect of cold storage under 
light or in dark was studied with new-season-harvested Monalisa potatoes. The 
flavonol induction was higher in fresh-cut potatoes stored under light than in 
the dark. However, caffeic acid derivatives were not affected. Domestic cooking 
such as boiling, microwaving, and frying provoked a partial loss of the 
flavonols, which were retained in the range of 4-16 mg per serving (213 g). 
Steam-cooking resulted in the highest retention of caffeic acid derivatives and 
aromatic amino acids compared with the other cooking methods studied. This means 
that due to the large amount of potatoes consumed in the Western diet, fresh-cut 
potatoes can be a significant source of health-promoting phenolics.

Edible Wild Vegetables Urtica dioica L. and Aegopodium podagraria 
L.-Antioxidants Affected by Processing.

Urtica dioica L. and Aegopodium podagraria L., also known as stinging nettle and 
ground elder, are edible wild green vegetables rich in bioactive and antioxidant 
polyphenols, vitamins, and minerals. Antioxidant activity assays (TEAC-, DPPH-, 
and TPC-assay) in combination with HPLC measurements, to qualify and quantify 
their chemical compositions, were used. Firstly, the drying methods affected the 
antioxidant activity of further processing stages, and outcomes were dependent 
on the species. Secondly, cooking increased the antioxidant activity due to 
higher concentrations of bioactive compounds, and released bound compounds 
through the rupture of cell structures. Furthermore, fridge storage (3 days at 7 
°C) resulted in the lowest antioxidant activity, compared to freezer storage (30 
days at -20 °C). Added 5-caffeoylquinic acid (0.3 mM) led to an increased 
antioxidant activity, most noticeably in freeze-dried samples. Synergistic 
effects of 5-caffeoylquinic acid were primary found in freeze-dried samples, 
analyzed fresh or after storage in the fridge. Metal-chelates can lower the 
antioxidant activity in plant matrices. Edible wild green vegetables are rich in 
polyphenols and processing can even increase their concentrations to boost the 
potential health effects. In general, selected quantified phenolics are not 
solely responsible for the antioxidant activity; minerals, processing, and 
interactions in plant matrices also contribute decisively.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the potential prognostic role of 
nitrogen permease regulator-like 2 (NPRL2) gene expression in predicting 
biochemical recurrence (BCR) following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy 
(RARP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included patients 
who underwent RARP performed by three different surgeons. Clinicopathological 
data and NPRL2 expression in tumor tissues were evaluated immunohistochemically 
(IHC). The level of NPRL2 staining was quantitatively assessed using an IHC 
score based on staining intensity. Factors associated with BCR were analyzed 
using multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: A preoperative PSA level > 10 ng/mL (OR: 4.10, 95% CI: 1.38-12.20, 
p = 0.011), an International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade 
group > 3 (OR: 4.39, 95% CI: 1.45-13.29, p = 0.009), and high NPRL2 expression 
(IHC score > 4) (OR: 3.82, 95% CI: 1.07-13.62, p = 0.039) were identified as 
independent risk factors for BCR.
CONCLUSION: High NPRL2 expression is associated with an increased risk of BCR 
following RARP. These findings suggest a potential prognostic value of NPRL2; 
however, further validation studies are needed due to the small sample size and 
the subjective nature of the assessment.

BACKGROUND: Nutritional biomarkers are alternatives to traditional dietary 
assessment tools. We sought to develop a method for nutritional analysis of 
resveratrol, a phenolic compound with purported health-promoting properties, and 
to determine all resveratrol metabolites.
METHODS: We obtained LDL and urine samples from 11 healthy male volunteers who 
had consumed 250 mL of Merlot red wine. We measured resveratrol and its 
metabolites with 96-well solid-phase extraction plates coupled with HPLC-tandem 
mass spectrometry. Hexestrol was used as the internal standard. Gradient 
chromatography in multiple reaction monitoring mode was performed on a Luna 
C(18) column, maintained at 40 degrees C; m/z transitions were as follows: 
resveratrol, 227/185; resveratrol glucosides, 389/227; resveratrol glucuronides, 
403/227; resveratrol sulfates, 307/227; taxifolin, 303/285; and hexestrol, 
269/134.
RESULTS: Standard calibration curves were linear at 4.4-3289.5 nmol/L. Residual 
analyses were 100% (3.2) for trans-resveratrol and 100% (11.1) for trans-piceid. 
In both matrices, imprecision (CV) was <10.8% at all concentrations. Detection 
limits for resveratrol were 0.2 nmol/L (LDL), 0.3 nmol/L (synthetic urine), and 
4.0 nmol/L (blank urine). Resveratrol and metabolites were checked for 
stability, and no degradation was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry method enabled us to identify 
resveratrol sulfates in human LDL and to characterize the complete profile of 
resveratrol metabolism in human LDL and urine. This method provides an accurate 
index of exposure to resveratrol and its metabolites, which can be used as 
nutritional biomarkers for evaluating the biological effects of moderate wine 
intake on human health.

When discovered in the 50's, isoflavones were suspected to provoke infertility 
syndrome in sheep grazing on clover. Many others effects of these phytoestrogens 
have been documented afterwards. To determine the distribution of isoflavone 
metabolites in ewe tissues and look for a link with their physiological impact, 
two ewes were fed a diet containing 50% red clover silage (variety Pawera) for 
one month with a daily intake of 157.6 mg/kg bw of total isoflavones. Only 
aglycones were fed due to the fermentation stage of the silage. At the 
sacrifice, isoflavone metabolites and aglycones were analyzed in blood, liver, 
kidney, lung, heart, muscle, ovaries, uterus, mammary glands, suprarenal glands, 
thymus, aorta, thyroid, pituitary gland, cerebellum, olfactory lobes, and brain 
hemispheres using HPLC-Coularray and LC-MS-MS. The major compounds recovered in 
tissues were equol and daidzein, present as glucuronides. Kidney concentrations 
were 10-fold higher than in other tissues. Penetration in brain was very 
limited. Reproductive organs contained higher concentrations of isoflavones than 
heart, muscle, or thymus. Distribution of isoflavones in ewe tissues is unequal 
and may reflect specific impact in some target tissues.

BACKGROUND: Procyanidins are extensively metabolized via phase-II and microbial 
enzymes. However, their distribution in the body is not well characterized.
AIM: This study investigates the distribution of procyanidins (monomers and 
dimers) and their phase-II metabolites in plasma and tissues (thymus, heart, 
liver, testicle, lung, kidney, spleen and brain).
METHODS: Wistar rats were fed with 1 g of cocoa cream (CC), 50 mg of procyanidin 
hazelnut skin extract (PE) and 50 mg PE in 1 g CC (PECC). The rats were killed 
at 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and 18 h after gavage, and the plasma and tissues were 
analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS.
RESULTS: Epicatechin-glucuronide was the main metabolite in the plasma after the 
CC intake, with C(max) at 423 nM and t(max) at 2 h, and methyl 
catechin-glucuronide (301 nM, 2 h) was the main metabolite in the plasma after 
the PE intake. As a result of the PECC enrichment, epicatechin-glucuronide (452 
nM, 1.5 h) and catechin-glucuronide (297 nM, 2 h) were the main metabolites in 
the plasma. Methyl catechin-glucuronide was found in the liver after PE (8 
nmol/g tissue, 4 h) and PECC (8 nmol/g, 1.5 h). The kidney was found to contain 
a high concentration of phase-II metabolites of procyanidins and is therefore 
thought to be the main site of metabolism of the compounds. Methyl 
catechin-sulfate (6.4 nmol/g, 4 h) was only quantified in the brain and after PE 
intake. Catechin metabolites were not found in the spleen or heart. Phenolic 
acids were detected in all tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: The formulation of a product enriched or fortified with 
procyanidins is a way to increase their bioavailability, with clear effects on 
the plasmatic pharmacokinetics, and a greater accumulation of phenolic 
metabolites in such tissues as the liver, kidney, lung and brain.

Nut skins are considered to be a rich source of polyphenols and may be partially 
responsible for the numerous health effects associated with nut consumption. 
However, more bioavailability studies of nut skin polyphenols are needed to 
understand the health effects derived from nut consumption. The aim of the 
present study was to determine the profiles of both phase II and 
microbial-derived phenolic metabolites in plasma and urine samples before and 
after the intake of almond skin polyphenols by healthy human subjects (n = 2). 
Glucuronide, O-methyl glucuronide, sulfate, and O-methyl sulfate derivatives of 
(epi)catechin, as well as the glucuronide conjugates of naringenin and 
glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of isorhamnetin, were detected in plasma and 
urine samples after consumption of almond skin polyphenols. The main 
microbial-derived metabolites of flavanols, such as 
5-(dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 
5-(hydroxymethoxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, were also detected in their 
glucuronide and sulfate forms. In addition, numerous metabolites derived from 
further microbial degradation of hydroxyphenylvalerolactones, including 
hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, hydroxycinnamic, hydroxybenzoic, 
and hydroxyhippuric acids, registered major changes in urine after the 
consumption of almond skin polyphenols. The urinary excretion of these microbial 
metabolites was estimated to account for a larger proportion of the total 
polyphenol ingested than phase II metabolites of (epi)catechin, indicating the 
important role of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism of highly polymerized 
almond skin polyphenols. To the authors' knowledge this study constitutes the 
most complete report of the absorption of almond skin polyphenols in humans.

The biological properties of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) polyphenols are strictly 
dependent on their bioavailability. A long-term cocoa feeding trial was 
performed with subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Subjects (n=42) 
received two sachets of 20 g of cocoa powder/day with 250 mL of skimmed milk 
each, or only 500 mL/day of skimmed milk, both for two 4-week periods. The 
phenolic metabolic profile including phase II conjugated metabolites and 
phenolic acids derived from the intestinal microbiota was determined by LC-MS/MS 
in both 24-h urine and fasting plasma. The analysis of 24-h urine revealed 
significant increases of phase II metabolites, including glucuronides and 
sulfate conjugates of (-)-epicatechin, O-methyl-epicatechin, 
5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 
5-(3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, after regular cocoa intake. 
In the case of plasma, only glucuronide conjugates of 
dihydroxyphenylvalerolactones increased. Regular consumption of cocoa also 
resulted in a significant increase in the urinary excretion of colonic 
microbial-derived phenolic metabolites, including vanillic, 
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acids, and particularly 
5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, whereas only the two latter 
metabolites showed a significant increase in fasting plasma. The results found 
herein indicate that 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 
hydroxyphenylacetic acids could be good biomarkers of the regular consumption of 
cocoa and therefore, of flavanol-rich foods.

Health effects of cocoa flavonols depend on their bioavailability, which is 
strongly influenced by the food matrix and the degree of flavanol 
polymerization. The effect of milk on the bioavailability of cocoa flavanoids 
considering phase II metabolites of epicatechin has been the subject of 
considerable debate. This work studies the effect of milk at the colonic 
microbial metabolism level of the nonabsorbed flavanol fraction that reaches the 
colon and is metabolized by the colonic microbiota into various phenolic acids. 
Twenty-one human volunteers followed a diet low in polyphenols for at least 48 h 
before taking, in a random order, 40 g of cocoa powder dissolved either in 250 
mL of whole milk or in 250 mL of water. Urine samples were collected before the 
intake and during three different periods (0-6, 6-12, and 12-24 h). Phenolic 
acids were analyzed by LC-MS/MS after solid-phase extraction. Of the 15 
metabolites assessed, the excretion of 9 phenolic acids was affected by the 
intake of milk. The urinary concentration of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, 
protocatechuic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, 4-hydroxyhippuric, hippuric, caffeic, and 
ferulic acids diminished after the intake of cocoa with milk, whereas urinary 
concentrations of vanillic and phenylacetic acids increased. In conclusion, milk 
partially affects the formation of microbial phenolic acids derived from the 
colonic degradation of procyanidins and other compounds present in cocoa powder.

A reversed-phase HPLC procedure is proposed for the determination of seven 
flavonoids (luteolin, nepetin, hispidulin, jaceosidin, cirsimaritin, 
cirsilineol, and eupatorin) in vervain samples. A simple extractive technique 
was developed, involving only extraction with ethyl ether, which allowed the 
elimination of phenolic acids, yielding a sufficiently purified flavonoid 
fraction. All of the analyzed vervain samples showed a common flavonoid pattern, 
in which hispidulin and jaceosidin were the major compounds and nepetin was the 
minor compound.

Total aliphatic and indole glucosinolates, phenolic compounds (flavonoids and 
hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives), and vitamin C contents were evaluated in freshly 
harvested broccoli (Brassica oleracea L., var. italica, cv. Marathon) 
inflorescences. These were film-wrapped and stored for 7 days at 1 degrees C to 
simulate a maximum period of commercial transport and distribution. After cold 
storage, inflorescences were kept for 3 days at 15 degrees C to simulate a 
retail sale period. For wrapping, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) of 11 microm 
thickness was used. Gas composition was about 17% O(2) and 2% CO(2) during cold 
storage and about 16% O(2) and 3-4% CO(2) during shelf life within packages. The 
predominant glucosinolates were 4-methylsulfinylbutyl-glucosinolate 
(glucoraphanin), 3-indolylmethyl-glucosinolate (glucobrassicin), and 
1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl-glucosinolate (neoglucobrassicin). The predominant 
hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives were identified as 1,2,2'-trisinapoylgentiobiose, 
1,2-diferuloylgentiobiose, 1,2'-disinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose, and 
3-O-caffeoyl-quinic (neochlorogenic acid). Results showed major losses at the 
end of both periods, in comparison with broccoli at harvest. Thus, the 
respective losses, at the end of cold storage and retail periods, were 71-80% of 
total glucosinolates, 62-59% of total flavonoids, 51-44% of sinapic acid 
derivatives, and 73-74% caffeoyl-quinic acid derivatives. Slight differences in 
all compound concentrations between storage and retail sale periods were 
detected. Distribution and retail periods had minimal effects on vitamin C. 
Weight loss was monitored at the end of both periods.

Orange juice is a very rich source of dietary flavanones. The effect of 
flavanone concentration and solubility of orange beverages on their 
bioavailability has been studied in a crossover study with 10 healthy 
volunteers. Five different beverages with different flavanone concentrations 
were evaluated. Commercial orange juices (29.2-70.3 mg of flavanones/100 mL) 
were compared with experimental orange beverages in which the flavanone 
concentration was enhanced (110.2 mg/100 mL). Hesperetin and naringenin 
glucuronides and sulfates were detected and quantified in plasma and urine. The 
study shows that the solubility of the flavanones, and particularly that of 
hesperidin, in the juice is a key factor for the bioavailability as flavanone 
excretion and the C(max) in plasma correlate well with the soluble flavanone 
concentration in the juice, whereas it has no correlation with the total 
flavanone intake. In addition, a large interindividual variation was observed, 
this being consistent for each individual after the intake of the different 
beverages, suggesting that flavanone bioavailability is also dependent on the 
occurrence of specific microbiota that is able to remove the rutinosides from 
the juice glycosides, which results in aglycones that are then absorbed from the 
gut.

The use of synthetic antioxidants has been associated with serious concerns for 
human and environmental health. During ripening stages, tomato fruit is exposed 
to different abiotic stresses which not only influence its nutritional, 
mechanical, and functional properties at harvest, but also affect the quality 
and shelf life of the fruit during storage. This study investigated the pattern 
of changes in dietary antioxidants during various ripening stages of tomato 
fruit (cv. Red Rose) and their impact on storage behavior of the fruit during 
cold storage. Tomato fruits were harvested at mature green, breaker, turning, 
pink, light-red and red stages of maturity. Then, they were analysed for flesh 
firmness, soluble solids content, titratable acidity, total sugars, pH, dry 
matter content, lipophilic (lycopene, β-carotene, and total carotenoids), and 
hydrophilic (ascorbic acid, phenolic and flavonoids) antioxidants. Additional 
fruits were harvested at each maturity stage and divided into three equal lots, 
then were subjected to low-temperature (10 ± 1 °C) storage with 80 ± 5% RH, for 
7, 14, and 21 days. Flesh firmness, and the levels of dietary antioxidants were 
analysed following the subsequent storage periods. The results revealed that the 
peak of hydrophilic antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, phenolic compounds, and 
flavonoids was between the 'pink' and the 'light-red' stages of fruit maturity. 
Whereas tomatoes harvested at the 'red' stage of maturity had the highest levels 
of lycopene and β-carotene. Both the stage of fruit maturity at harvest and 
duration of cold storage influenced flesh firmness, organoleptic and functional 
properties of 'Red Rose' tomato fruit. In conclusion, the results of the current 
investigation have practical implications in formulating foods with improved 
functional properties at processing industries.

Tomatoes and tomato-based products are rich in antioxidants such as carotenoids, 
vitamin C and polyphenols. The industrial processing of diced tomatoes involves 
heat treatments in which these antioxidant compounds may be potentially 
affected. In this study, we evaluate the effect of each separate step in the 
dice-making process. Three technological processes were investigated: Hot, Cold 
and Cold treated with calcium salt (CaCl2). Four stages were monitored in each 
process: (1) fresh tomatoes; (2) peeled tomatoes; (3) diced tomatoes; and (4) 
final product after sauce addition. The main tool for minimising or 
counteracting the eventual processing damage was the strategy of 
'reconstitution', achieved by adding a sauce rich in seeds and peels with high 
levels of antioxidants and phenolics to the diced tomatoes. Different analyses 
were carried out in order to evaluate the effect of each processing step. First, 
total polyphenols (TP) were evaluated using Folin-Ciocalteau (F-C) assay and 
antioxidant activity using ABTS(+) and DPPH assays. Flavonols, flavanones, 
hydroxycinnamic and phenolic acids were then quantified using liquid 
chromatography/electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry 
(HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). The combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that each processing step induces 
alterations in the antioxidant and phenolic profile, and in particular sauce 
addition and calcium treatment significantly affected the levels of antioxidants 
and phenolics during the dice-making process.

The effect of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) (450-550-650 MPa/5-10-15 min) on 
polyphenols profile of purée obtained from commercial tomato varieties 
(Maliniak, Cerise, Black Prince and Lima) was investigated. Individual 
polyphenols, total phenolic index (TPI) were quantified using a mass 
spectrometer (HPLC-MS/MS). Photochemiluminescence (PCLACW), cyclic voltammetry 
(CV) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays were used to determine 
the antioxidant capacity of the hydrophilic extract. The results demonstrated 
that at certain processing conditions, HHP may enhance or decrease the 
nutritional quality of tomato purée. However, the tomato variety was a key 
factor influencing the polyphenols profile and the antioxidant capacity. A 
significant positive correlation was found among TPI, FRAP or CV parameters and 
the concentration of caffeic, ferulic, sinapic and p-coumaric acids, and 
epicatechin. On the other hand, significant positive correlation was observed 
among antioxidant capacity (PCLACW), TPC, rutin and naringenin concentration as 
well as chlorogenic and isochlorogenic acids.

OBJECTIVE: A diet rich in phyto-oestrogens has been suggested to protect against 
a variety of common diseases but UK intake data on phyto-oestrogens or their 
food sources are sparse. The present study estimates the average intakes of 
isoflavones, lignans, enterolignans and coumestrol from 7 d food diaries and 
provides data on total isoflavone, lignan and phyto-oestrogen consumption by 
food group.
DESIGN: Development of a food composition database for twelve phyto-oestrogens 
and analysis of soya food and phyto-oestrogen consumption in a populationbased 
study.
SETTING: Men and women, aged 40–79 years, from the general population 
participating in the Norfolk arm of the European Prospective Investigation into 
Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Norfolk) between 1993 and 1997, with nutrient and 
food data from 7 d food diaries.
SUBJECTS: A subset of 20 437 participants.
RESULTS: The median daily phyto-oestrogen intake for all men was 1199 mg 
(interquartile range 934–1537mg; mean 1504mg, SD 1502mg) and 888mg for all women 
(interquartile range 710–1135 mg; mean 1205 mg, SD 1701mg). In soya consumers, 
median daily intakes were higher: 2861 mg in men (interquartile range 
1304–7269mg; mean 5051mg, SD 5031mg) and 3142 mg in women (interquartile range 
1089–7327mg; mean 5396 mg, SD 6092 mg). In both men and women, bread made the 
greatest contribution to phyto-oestrogen intake – 40?8% and 35?6%, respectively. 
In soya consumers, vegetable dishes and soya/goat’s/sheep’s milks were the main 
contributors – 45?7% and 21?3% in men and 38?4% and 33?7% in women, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The ability to estimate phyto-oestrogen intake in Western 
populations more accurately will aid investigations into their suggested effects 
on health.

electrochemical detection for the simultaneous detection and quantification of 
hydroxycinnamic acids and their corresponding aroma-active volatile phenols in 
wort and beer is reported. The technique gives good specificity and sensitivity, 
and can therefore be used for routine monitoring of hydroxycinnamic acids in 
wort and the development of volatile phenolic flavour compounds during the beer 
production process and subsequent conservation.

Chestnut (Castanea sativa) is an important basic food in rural diets and a major 
starch crop used in a similar way to potatoes. Chestnuts are a fundamental 
economic resource in the ""chestnut regions"" not only for the fruit but also for 
the chestnut wood. Chestnuts have become increasingly important with respect to 
human health, for example, as an alternative gluten-free flour source. Chestnuts 
are also a rich source of other beneficial compounds, but there have been few 
studies on the composition during processing. In this study, we analyzed the 
chemical composition of three Portuguese cultivars at different stages of 
industrial processing. The chestnut cultivars were Longal, Judia, and Martaínha. 
All three cultivars had high moisture contents but were low in ash, crude fat, 
and crude protein contents, with high starch and low fiber contents. The free 
amino acid contents, including various essential amino acids, varied depending 
on the cultivar. All three cultivars also had a significant content of 
polyphenolics with gallic acid; ellagic acid was predominant among hydrolyzable 
and condensed tannins. Many of these compounds are known to exert significant 
positive effects on human health. The one-way analysis of variance for fresh 
chestnut shows significant differences among the three cultivars for most of the 
studied parameters. The same statistical analysis applied to each one of the two 
cultivars (Judia and Longal) sampled for the four processing steps analyzed 
indicates a significant effect of this factor in practically all of the 
constituents. On the other hand, the two-way analysis of variance shows that, 
besides the residual, the processing step and the interaction cultivar x 
processing step were the factors that more contributed for the total variation 
observed in the constituents analyzed, while the contribution of cultivar was 
much less significant.

Fruit coatings serve a dual purpose in preserving the quality of fruits. Not 
only do they act as a barrier against water evaporation and fungal infiltration, 
but they also enhance the fruit's visual appeal in the market. Yet, their 
influence on the fruit's quality components, which play a crucial role in 
determining its nutritional value, taste, and overall flavor, has remained 
relatively unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of carnauba wax 
coating on the quality of Moro oranges during storage. The selected fruits were 
meticulously chosen for uniformity in size. The experiment involved applying 
carnauba wax, a commonly used type among local producers, at four different 
concentrations: 0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5%. These treatments were applied during 
various storage periods, including immediately after fruits were harvested and 
after 40 and 80 days. Following the application of these treatments, the oranges 
were stored in a controlled environment (morgue) at a temperature of 4 ± 1 °C. 
Subsequently, several physicochemical parameters of both the fruit flesh and 
skin were examined. The results unveiled a decline in the overall ascorbic acid 
content of the fruits. In terms of phenol content, a general decreasing trend 
was observed after harvesting. At each sampling interval during storage, the 
phenol content in uncoated fruits consistently exceeded that of their waxed 
counterparts. Significant reduction in fruit weight was observed throughout the 
storage period. Both vitamin C and total acidity levels in the fruit exhibited 
decreases during the storage period. As time passed, fruit firmness gradually 
declined, while fruit decay increased during the 40- and 80-day storage periods 
for untreated Moro oranges. The anthocyanin content showed an increasing trend. 
The study also unveiled a decline in the antioxidant capacity of citrus fruits 
during storage. Strong significant positive correlations were observed between 
total phenol content and key parameters, such as antioxidant activity (0.941**), 
MDA (0.364*), vitamin C content, and total carbohydrate content (0.475**). Skin 
radiance showed a perfect correlation with chroma and hue (1.000**). Principal 
component analysis revealed that the first principal component accounted for 
34.27% of the total variance, out of a total of five principal components that 
explained 77.14% of the variance. Through cluster analysis, the variables were 
categorized into three distinct groups; one associated with weight loss and 
another with ion leakage. Considering these findings, carnauba wax-based coating 
emerges as a promising solution for preserving Moro oranges. It effectively 
mitigates fruit weight loss and helps maintain fruit firmness during storage, 
making it a valuable tool for fruit preservation.

Commercially important edible nut seeds were analyzed for chemical composition 
and moisture sorption. Moisture (1.47-9.51%), protein (7.50-21.56%), lipid 
(42.88-66.71%), ash (1.16-3.28%), total soluble sugars (0.55-3.96%), tannins 
(0.01-0.88%), and phytate (0.15-0.35%) contents varied considerably. Regardless 
of the seed type, lipids were mainly composed of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty 
acids (>75% of the total lipids). Fatty acid composition analysis indicated that 
oleic acid (C18:1) was the main constituent of monounsaturated lipids in all 
seed samples. With the exception of macadamia, linoleic acid (C18:2) was the 
major polyunsaturated fatty acid. In the case of walnuts, in addition to 
linoleic acid (59.79%) linolenic acid (C18:3) also significantly contributed 
toward the total polyunsaturated lipids. Amino acid composition analyses 
indicated lysine (Brazil nut, cashew nut, hazelnut, pine nut, and walnut), 
sulfur amino acids methionine and cysteine (almond), tryptophan (macadamia, 
pecan), and threonine (peanut) to be the first limiting amino acid as compared 
to human (2-5 year old) amino acid requirements. The amino acid composition of 
the seeds was characterized by the dominance of hydrophobic (range = 
37.16-44.54%) and acidic (27.95-33.17%) amino acids followed by basic 
(16.16-21.17%) and hydrophilic (8.48-11.74%) amino acids. Trypsin inhibitory 
activity, hemagglutinating activity, and proteolytic activity were not detected 
in the nut seed samples analyzed. Sorption isotherms (Aw range = 0.08-0.97) 
indicated a narrow range for monolayer water content (11-29 mg/g of dry matter). 
No visible mold growth was evident on any of the samples stored at Aw < 0.53 and 
25 degrees C for 6 months.

Recent research on animal nutrition focused on the use of plant-based lipid and 
protein sources as alternatives to fish oil and fishmeal, with a particular 
emphasis on by-products from oilseed processing. Several studies have been 
carried out on seed and derived products of Balanites aegyptiaca. Therefore, 
this paper aimed to review scientific knowledge on the nutritional value and 
antinutrients of B. aegyptiaca oils and cakes for animal feed. A literature 
search of articles using Google Scholar and Research4Life was conducted between 
May and November 2024, followed by the selection of relevant articles from the 
reference list of collected articles. Then, a content analysis was performed. 
Results showed that B. aegyptiaca seeds had high oil content (30%-60%) with both 
saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Among these, oleic, linoleic, and 
palmitic acids were the main ones. The remaining cakes after oil extraction had 
high contents of protein (30%-40%), lipids (4%-9%), and minerals (5%-15%). 
Common antinutritional factors in cakes were phytates, saponins, tannins, and 
oxalates, the contents of which ranged from 37 to 194, 1.6 to 18, 0.0043 to 
0.034, and 15 to 350 mg/100 g, respectively. This review found that these cakes 
have been used in feed for animals such as goats, sheep, and rats, but there is 
limited knowledge on that of aquatic animals. Concerning oil, it has been 
successfully used in feed for Clarias gariepinus and Clarias anguillaris. 
Considering its high nutrient content and low antinutrient levels, B. aegyptiaca 
cakes and oils could be used as feedstuffs in animal feed. However, future 
studies are required for their better valorisation in feed by investigating 
their effects on growth and nutrient digestibility for other important farmed 
animal species.

Platelet aggregation and inflammation play a crucial role in atherothrombosis. 
Wine contains micro-constituents of proper quality and quantity that exert 
cardioprotective actions, partly through inhibiting platelet-activating factor 
(PAF), a potent inflammatory and thrombotic lipid mediator. However, wine cannot 
be consumed extensively due to the presence of ethanol. Alternatively, winery 
by-products are abundant in similar-to-wine micro-constituents that could be 
used in food fortification and dietary supplements. Also, the vinification 
process produces millions of tons of by-products worldwide, posing an 
environmental matter of waste management. Therefore, the purpose of this 
literature review is to update the existing data concerning the in vitro 
anti-platelet and anti-inflammatory properties of winery by-product extracts and 
their possible health effects through controlled clinical trials in humans, 
specifically focused on their effects on PAF's actions. Data from in vitro 
studies report that winery by-product compounds are able to inhibit platelet 
aggregation against several aggregation factors, as well as to downregulate 
inflammatory markers. Among their actions, extracts or phenolic compounds 
present in winery by-products inhibit PAF's actions, a potent inflammatory and 
thrombotic mediator. Similar conclusions have been drawn from human 
supplementation studies, which suggest that winery by-product extracts may have 
beneficial biological effects on the cardiovascular system. Evidence from 
long-term studies shows that consumption may lower total and low density 
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, improve insulin sensitivity, decrease lipid and 
protein oxidative damage, enhance antioxidant capacity, and have mild 
anti-inflammatory action toward reducing cytokine expression and levels. Data 
from the limited postprandial studies report that the acute consumption of 
winery by-product extracts improves glycemic response and reduces platelet 
reactivity to aggregatory stimuli. Although wine extracts and phenolic compounds 
have been reported to inhibit PAF's actions and reduce the activity of its 
biosynthetic enzymes, no data exist concerning the influence of winery 
by-product extracts. In the future, additional long-term randomized controlled 
trials or postprandial studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions and 
establish a viable cardioprotective strategy that incorporates the sustainable 
use of winery by-products.

Wine and beer are nowadays the most popular alcoholic beverages, and the 
benefits of their moderate consumption have been extensively supported by the 
scientific community. The main source of wine and beer's antioxidant behavior 
are the phenolic substances. Phenolic compounds in wine and beer also influence 
final product quality, in terms of color, flavor, fragrance, stability, and 
clarity. Change in the quantity and quality of phenolic compounds in wine and 
beer depends on many parameters, beginning with the used raw material, its place 
of origin, environmental growing conditions, and on all the applied 
technological processes and the storage of the final product. This review 
represents current knowledge of phenolic compounds, comparing qualitative and 
quantitative profiles in wine and beer, changes of these compounds through all 
phases of wine and beer production are discussed, as well as the possibilities 
for increasing their content. Analytical methods and their importance for 
phenolic compound determination have also been pointed out. The observed data 
showed wine as the beverage with a more potent biological activity, due to a 
higher content of phenolic compounds. However, both of them contain, partly 
similar and different, phenolic compounds, and recommendations have to consider 
the drinking pattern, consumed quantity, and individual preferences. 
Furthermore, novel technologies have been developing rapidly in order to improve 
the polyphenolic content and antioxidant activity of these two beverages, 
particularly in the brewing industry.

Olive oil phenolic compounds are potent antioxidants in vitro, but evidence for 
antioxidant action in vivo is controversial. We examined the role of the 
phenolic compounds from olive oil on postprandial oxidative stress and LDL 
antioxidant content. Oral fat loads of 40 mL of similar olive oils, but with 
high (366 mg/kg), moderate (164 mg/kg), and low (2.7 mg/kg) phenolic content, 
were administered to 12 healthy male volunteers in a cross-over study design 
after a washout period in which a strict antioxidant diet was followed. Tyrosol 
and hydroxytyrosol, phenolic compounds of olive oil, were dose-dependently 
absorbed (p<0.001). Total phenolic compounds in LDL increased at postprandial 
state in a direct relationship with the phenolic compounds content of the olive 
oil ingested (p<0.05). Plasma concentrations of tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, and 
3-O-methyl-hydroxytyrosol directly correlated with changes in the total phenolic 
compounds content of the LDL after the high phenolic compounds content olive oil 
ingestion. A 40 mL dose of olive oil promoted a postprandial oxidative stress, 
the degree of LDL oxidation being lower as the phenolic content of the olive oil 
administered increases. In conclusion, olive oil phenolic content seems to 
modulate the LDL phenolic content and the postprandial oxidative stress promoted 
by 40 mL olive oil ingestion in humans.

Hydroxytyrosol is the most potent phenolic antioxidant of olive oil and olive 
mill waste water (OMWW) and its biological activities have stimulated research 
on its potential role in cardiovascular protection. However, evidence of the 
absorption of OMWW phenolics and on their possible in vivo activity has, until 
now, never been provided. Three groups male Sprague-Dawley rats were 
administered 1, 5, or 10 mg/Kg of the OMWW extract, respectively, providing 
41.4, 207, and 414 microg/Kg of hydroxytyrosol, respectively. Urine was 
collected for 24 h and the urinary levels of hydroxytyrosol were quantified by 
mass spectrometry. Hydroxytyrosol was dose-dependently (R(2) = 0.95) absorbed 
and excreted in the urines mostly as a glucuronide conjugate. Further, the 
administration of an hydroxytyrosol-rich OMWW extract (10 mg/kg) to the rats was 
also associated with an increase of their plasma antioxidant capacity. Future 
experiments will eventually further clarify its metabolic fate and its in vivo 
actions.

Interest in the in vivo biological activities of olive oil phenolics is rapidly 
growing, and different models and vehicles of administration are used worldwide. 
Matters of practicality determine the use of rats rather than humans as the 
model of choice. Also, growing interest in nutraceuticals is leading to the 
formulation of compounds containing olive oil phenols. In this study, we 
compared metabolism and urinary excretion of hydroxytyrosol [(HT), the most 
representative phenol of olive oil] between rats and humans by evaluating 
excretion of HT and its major metabolite, homovanillyl alcohol. Also, we 
compared human excretion of HT when consumed as a natural component of extra 
virgin olive oil, when added to refined olive oil, or when added to yogurt (as 
an approximation of functional food). Urinary excretion of HT was greater in 
humans than in rats, a species with a high basal excretion of HT and its 
metabolites. The high (234% of HT administered) excretion of free HT suggests 
that hydrolysis of oleuropein administered in humans (still an unresolved issue) 
occurs in vivo. Moreover, human HT excretion was much higher after its 
administration as a natural component of olive oil (44.2% of HT administered) 
than after its addition to refined olive oil (23% of HT administered) or yogurt 
(5.8% of dose or approximately 13% of that recorded after virgin olive oil 
intake). These data suggest that the rat is not the appropriate model for the 
study of HT metabolism and that HT-containing functional foods should be 
carefully formulated.

Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) represents the most prevalent form of skin cancer 
globally, with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) 
being the most common types. The search for effective chemopreventive and 
therapeutic agents has led to the exploration of natural compounds, among which 
resveratrol (RES), a polyphenolic phytoalexin found in grapes, berries, peanuts, 
and red wine, has garnered significant attention. This comprehensive review aims 
to elucidate the effects of RES on NMSC, focusing on its mechanisms of action, 
efficacy in preclinical studies, and potential as a chemopreventive and 
therapeutic agent. RES exhibits promising chemopreventive and antineoplastic 
capabilities against NMSC through various mechanisms, including the induction of 
apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation, modulation of oxidative stress, and 
anti-inflammatory activities. Studies have demonstrated that RES can 
significantly enhance the effectiveness of traditional chemotherapeutic agents, 
such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), by inhibiting cellular proliferation and inducing 
apoptosis in cancerous cells. Furthermore, resveratrol's antioxidant properties 
may mitigate the impact of reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggered by UV 
exposure, thus reducing DNA damage and mutations associated with skin cancer 
development. In vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that RES can 
effectively hinder the growth and spread of various tumor cell types, including 
human cutaneous SCC A431 cells, and induce apoptosis. The development of 
advanced delivery systems, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and liposomes, 
has been recognized for their potential to enhance the therapeutic effects of 
RES, particularly its anticancer properties. In conclusion, RES presents a 
viable candidate for the prevention and treatment of NMSC, owing to its 
multifaceted mechanisms of action, including its ability to regulate oxidative 
stress, trigger apoptosis, and inhibit proliferation. However, further clinical 
studies are required to fully understand its effectiveness and safety in humans, 
as well as to optimize delivery methods for improved bioavailability and 
therapeutic outcomes.

Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and 
development of atherosclerosis. Stilbenes have been shown to protect 
lipoproteins from oxidative damage and to have cancer chemopreventive activity. 
We describe a method for the direct determination of stilbenes in several red 
wines using high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. In a 
survey of 12 commercial wines from the south of Brazil (Rio Grande del Sul), 
levels of delta-viniferin are reported for the first time in different varieties 
of red wines. Brazilian red wine contains trans-astringin, trans-piceid, 
trans-resveratrol, cis-resveratrol (in high quantity: 5 times more than the 
trans form), epsilon-viniferin, and a compound isolated for the first time in 
wine, trans-delta-viniferin. Isolation and identification of delta-viniferin was 
achieved by NMR after extraction and fractionation of red wine phenolics. 
delta-Viniferin contributes, as well as cis-resveratrol and trans-piceid, to a 
significant proportion of stilbenes in wine dietary intake, particularly with 
Merlot varieties containing an average level of 10 mg/L for delta-viniferin, 15 
mg/L for cis-resveratrol, and 13 mg/L for trans-piceid. The total stilbene 
intake from wine origin was estimated for the Brazilian population as 5.3 mg/day 
per person (on the basis of a regular wine consumption of 160 mL/day). 
delta-Viniferin can contribute to around 20% of total stilbenes in wine (average 
of 6.4 mg/L in red Brazilian wines). It would be important in the future to 
investigate the origins of the differences in wine stilbene levels in relation 
to the vine varieties, and the bioavailability of the newly extracted stilbene 
delta-viniferin in plasma after consumption of different types of wines.

Apples are a rich source of polyphenols in the human diet. However, the 
distribution of polyphenols in different apple varieties and tissues is still 
largely unclear. In this study, a new liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) strategy was developed to reveal the spatial 
distribution of polyphenols in different apple tissues and varieties. A method 
based on multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-enhanced product ion (EPI) was 
established in the information-dependent acquisition (IDA) mode for 
pseudo-target screening of major apple polyphenols. A total of 39 apple 
polyphenolic metabolites were finally identified. Qualitative and quantitative 
results showed that the variety and content of polyphenols in apple peels were 
higher than those of other tissues. In apple roots, stems, and leaves, the 
highest polyphenol variety and content were found in wild species, followed by 
cultivars and elite varieties. Dihydrochalcone substances, one kind of major 
apple polyphenols, were more abundant in apple roots, stems, and leaves. This 
strategy can be applied as a model for other agricultural products, in addition 
to revealing the distribution of polyphenols in different tissues of apples, 
which provides a theoretical basis for the utilization of polyphenol resources 
and variety selection.

BACKGROUND: The quality of rapeseed oil depends to a considerable degree on raw 
material quality. Negli- gence in maintaining the appropriate conditions during 
long-term rapeseed storage (excessively high humid- ity and temperature) may 
contribute to a deterioration of seed quality, as a result of microbial growth 
and changes in native antioxidant contents. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the effect of inappropriate storage conditions on changes in sinapic 
acid derivative content, which is the main phenolic compound in rapeseeds.
METHODS: The material used for tests was canola cv. PR 46 W14. Seeds with a 
13.5% moisture content were stored for 21 days in a thermo-hygrostat chamber, 
ensuring rapeseed storage under constant humidity and temperature conditions. In 
this study, the level of mould fungi was analysed using the plate method, while 
those of sinapic acid derivatives were determined using the HPLC-DAD method.
RESULTS: Intensive growth of mould fungi in the rapeseeds was observed after 6 
days of storage. Changes were recorded in sinapic acid derivative contents, 
which are the main phenolic compounds in rapeseed. The level of phenolic 
compounds found in the bound form (sinapin; sinapic acid methyl ester; 
1,2-disinapoyl- dihexoside; 1,2-disinapoyl-hexoside and 
1,2,2&rsquo;-trisinapoyl-dihexoside) decreased. At the same time, an in- crease 
was recorded in trans-sinapic acid content (by 63%).
CONCLUSIONS: Both qualitative and quantitative changes in phenolic compounds may 
be connected with the development of fungal microflora in stored rapeseeds. Only 
adequate storage conditions for the oil raw mate- rial, such as rapeseeds, may 
ensure good quality in the final product, in this case, rapeseed oil.

The amounts of myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol were analyzed in 16 red and 
2 white berry and grape wines after acid hydrolysis using an RP-HPLC method with 
diode array detection. The red berry wines analyzed were made mainly from black 
currant, crowberry, and bog whortleberry, i.e., berries rich in flavonols. The 
red grape wines were made mainly from Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot grapes in 
several countries. The white wines studied were gooseberry and white currant 
wines and Chardonnay and Riesling wines. The amount of myricetin ranged from 3.8 
to 22.6 mg L(-1) in red berry wines and from 0 to 14.6 mg L(-1) in red grape 
wines. The amount of quercetin was from 2.2 to 24.3 mg L(-1) red berry wines and 
from <1.2 to 19.4 mg L(-1) in red grape wines. Low levels of kaempferol were 
found in all red berry wines and in 9 red grape wines. The total concentration 
of these flavonols was from 6 to 46 mg L(-1) (mean 20 mg L(-1)) in red berry 
wines and from 4 to 31 mg L(-1) (mean 15 mg L(-1)) in red grape wines. Small

SCOPE: Brassica vegetables contain unique compounds known as glucosinolates 
(GSLs), which, when hydrolyzed by plant or microbial myrosinase, form bioactive 
isothiocyanates (ITCs) that offer health benefits to the host. The present study 
evaluated the impact of cooked broccoli (broccoli myrosinase inactivated) 
consumption on cecal microbial metabolism of glucoraphanin (GRP) in lean and 
obese mice and characterized the changes in cecal microbiota following 
broccoli-containing diets.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty lean and 20 diet-induced obese (DIO) mice were 
randomized to consume control or cooked broccoli supplemented diets for 7 days. 
Cooked broccoli consumption increased ex vivo microbial GRP hydrolysis by cecal 
contents collected from lean and obese mice, led to increased production of 
sulforaphane (SF), sulforaphane-cysteine (SF-CYS), total ITC, and colonic 
NAD(P)H: Quinone Oxidoreductase (NQO1) activity. Further investigation revealed 
increased abundance of health-promoting gut microbiota, including 
Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group and Dubosiella newyorkensis, following 
broccoli-containing diets. The Peptococcaseae family, the Blautia genus, and an 
amplicon sequence variation (ASV) from the Oscillospiraceae family exhibited 
negative correlation with total ITC production.
CONCLUSION: These finding suggest that cooked broccoli consumption enhances 
microbial GRP hydrolysis to produce more bioactive ITCs and inform future 
strategies toward altering microbial GSL metabolism to promote gut health in 
both lean and obese individuals.

Five types of caneberries [evergreen blackberries (Rubus laciniatus), 
marionberries (Rubus ursinus), boysenberries (Rubus ursinus x idaeus), red 
raspberries (Rubus idaeus), and black raspberries (Rubus occidentalis)] were 
analyzed for antioxidant activity by measuring their oxygen radical absorbance 
capacity (ORAC). In addition, the berries were analyzed for total phenolics, 
anthocyanins, procyanidins, and ellagic acid content. All of the berries had 
high ORAC activity ranging from 24 to 77.2 micromol of Trolox equiv/g of fresh 
berries. Anthocyanin content ranged from 0.65 to 5.89 mg/g, and phenolics ranged 
from 4.95 to 9.8 mg/g. Black raspberries had the highest ORAC and anthocyanin 
and phenolic contents. Only red raspberries had detectable amounts of 
procyanidin oligomers (monomer, dimers, and trimers). All berries had high 
levels of ellagic acid (47-90 mg/g), but boysenberries had the highest level 
prior to hydrolysis. The results from this study indicate that these caneberries 
were high in antioxidant activity and were rich sources of anthocyanins and 
phenolics.

Resveratrol provides multiple physiologic benefits which promote healthspan in 
various model species and clinical trials support continued exploration of 
resveratrol treatment in humans. However, there remains concern regarding low 
bioavailability and wide inter-individual differences in absorption and 
metabolism in humans, which suggests a great need to develop novel methods for 
resveratrol delivery. We hypothesized that oral transmucosal delivery, using a 
lozenge composed of a resveratrol-excipient matrix, would allow resveratrol to 
be absorbed rapidly into the bloodstream. We pursued proof of concept through 
two experiments. In the first experiment, the solubility of trans-resveratrol 
(tRES) in water and 2.0 M solutions of dextrose, fructose, ribose, sucrose, and 
xylitol was determined using HPLC. Independent t-tests with a Bonferroni 
correction were used to compare the solubility of tRES in each of the solutions 
to that in water. tRES was significantly more soluble in the ribose solution 
(p = 0.0013) than in the other four solutions. Given the enhanced solubility of 
tRES in a ribose solution, a resveratrol-ribose matrix was developed into a 
lozenge suitable for human consumption. Lozenges were prepared, each containing 
146±5.5 mg tRES per 2000 mg of lozenge mass. Two healthy human participants 
consumed one of the prepared lozenges following an overnight fast. Venipuncture 
was performed immediately before and 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes following 
lozenge administration. Maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) for tRES alone 
(i.e., resveratrol metabolites not included) were 325 and 332 ng⋅mL(-1) for the 
two participants at 15 minute post-administration for both individuals. These 
results suggest a resveratrol-ribose matrix lozenge can achieve greater Cmax and 
enter the bloodstream faster than previously reported dosage forms for 
gastrointestinal absorption. While this study is limited by small sample size 
and only one method of resveratrol delivery, it does provide proof of concept to 
support further exploration of novel delivery methods for resveratrol 
administration.

Dietary factors affecting polyphenol bioavailability.

Agro-biotechnologies Department, Belvaux, Luxembourg.

While many epidemiological studies have associated the consumption of 
polyphenols within fruits and vegetables with a decreased risk of developing 
several chronic diseases, intervention studies have generally not confirmed 
these beneficial effects. The reasons for this discrepancy are not fully 
understood but include potential differences in dosing, interaction with the 
food matrix, and differences in polyphenol bioavailability. In addition to 
endogenous factors such as microbiota and digestive enzymes, the food matrix can 
also considerably affect bioaccessibility, uptake, and further metabolism of 
polyphenols. While dietary fiber (such as hemicellulose), divalent minerals, and 
viscous and protein-rich meals are likely to cause detrimental effects on 
polyphenol bioaccessibility, digestible carbohydrates, dietary lipids 
(especially for hydrophobic polyphenols, e.g., curcumin), and additional 
antioxidants may enhance polyphenol availability. Following epithelial uptake, 
polyphenols such as flavonoids may reduce phase II metabolism and excretion, 
enhancing polyphenol bioavailability. Furthermore, polyphenols may act 
synergistically due to their influence on efflux transporters such as 
p-glycoprotein. In order to understand polyphenol bioactivity, increased 
knowledge of the factors affecting polyphenol bioavailability, including dietary 
factors, is paramount.

Fruits and leaves from different cultivars of thornless blackberry (Rubus sp.), 
red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.), black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis L.), and 
strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa D.) plants were analyzed for total antioxidant 
capacity (oxygen radical absorbance capacity, ORAC) and total phenolic content. 
In addition, fruits were analyzed for total anthocyanin content. Blackberries 
and strawberries had the highest ORAC values during the green stages, whereas 
red raspberries had the highest ORAC activity at the ripe stage. Total 
anthocyanin content increased with maturity for all three species of fruits. 
Compared with fruits, leaves were found to have higher ORAC values. In fruits, 
ORAC values ranged from 7.8 to 33.7 micromol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g of 
fresh berries (35. 0-162.1 micromol of TE/g of dry matter), whereas in leaves, 
ORAC values ranged from 69.7 to 182.2 micromol of TE/g of fresh leaves 
(205.0-728.8 micromol of TE/g of dry matter). As the leaves become older, the 
ORAC values and total phenolic contents decreased. The results showed a linear 
correlation between total phenolic content and ORAC activity for fruits and 
leaves. For ripe berries, a linear relationship existed between ORAC values and 
anthocyanin content. Of the ripe fruits tested, on the basis of wet weight of 
fruit, cv. Jewel black raspberry and blackberries may be the richest source for 
antioxidants. On the basis of the dry weight of fruit, strawberries had the 
highest ORAC activity followed by black raspberries (cv. Jewel), blackberries, 
and red raspberries.

Tea is a popular beverage almost all over the world. Many studies show that tea 
consumption is closely associated with positive health impact. Most of the HPLC 
methods used for the determination of tea constituents include gradient elution 
systems which involve expensive instrumentation. The objective of this study was 
to develop a simple, rapid precise and low cost HPLC method for the separation 
and quantification of catechins and caffeine in tea (Camellia sinensis). The 
method utilizes a phenyl column (2.1 × 150 mm) with a UV-detector (280 nm) where 
excellent chromatographic separation of tea components i.e. gallic acid (GA), 
caffeine (Caf), epicatechin (EC) and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was 
achieved. The isocratic elution system of acetonitrile, glacial acetic acid and 
deionized water (8:1:91 v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min was involved. This 
method produced excellent accuracy and precision. Within run and between run 
precision was less than 7.5 %. The equations for calibration curves were 
y = 0.117 (±0.010)x + 0.173 (±0.024), y = 0.100 (±0.003)x + 0.045 (±0.019), 
y = 0.016 (±0.001)x + 0.006 (±0.004), y = 0.025 (±0.001)x-0.025 (±0.007) for GA, 
Caf, EC and EGCG respectively. The method validation parameters prove that the 
method is efficient, a simple and adequate for the quantitative determination of 
principal components in tea samples.

Flavonoids from green and black tea may benefit cardiovascular health. Brewed 
tea consumption and flavonoid intake in France have not been previously 
explored. This study assessed the dietary intake of flavonoids among French 
children and adults, using 3 days' dietary recall for 3896 persons aged >4 y in 
the Third French Individual and National Food Consumption Survey (INCA3). Foods 
consumed by INCA 3 participants were manually matched with the flavonoid content 
of foods from the French PhenolExplorer database and the US Department of 
Agriculture expanded flavonoid database (2018 version). The six subclasses of 
flavonoids were flavan-3-ols, flavanones, anthocyanidins, flavonols, flavones, 
and isoflavones. Flavonoid intake was stratified by age subgroups (children and 
adults separately) and examined using socio-demographics and tea consumption 
patterns. Mean flavonoid intake was 210 mg/d. Flavonoids in the French diet were 
predominantly flavan-3-ols (147 mg/d), of which tea is the main source. The 
effects of age, education, income, and socio-professional category (SPC) on 
flavonoid intake were all significant (p < 0.0001). Brewed tea consumers were 
31.88% of French adults and 3.79% of children. Brewed tea consumption and 
flavonoid intake were highly correlated. The highest brewed tea and flavonoid 
intakes were found among individuals with the highest SPC and education levels. 
Flavonoid intake in France was associated with brewed tea consumption and with 
higher education and income.

Water scarcity is an ecological issue affecting over 10% of Europe. It is 
intensified by rising temperatures, leading to greater evaporation and reduced 
precipitation. Agriculture has been confirmed as the sector accounting for the 
highest water consumption globally, and it faces significant challenges relating 
to drought, impacting crop yields and food security. Sustainable practices, 
precision irrigation, and the development of drought-resistant crops are 
essential for the mitigation of this threat. Effective, innovative solutions are 
crucial for optimizing water use for intensive crops such as cultivated 
strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa). This study emphasizes the importance of 
identifying the genotypes most resilient to low water availability. Experimental 
trials involving reduced irrigation levels were set up to identify genotypes 
with a greater capacity to increase fruit quality and maintain fruit yield. 
Reduced water conditions positively influenced strawberry fruit quality, 
exhibiting improved citric acid, soluble solids, and color brightness linked to 
decreased water use, while firmness remained stable. Notably, the total phenolic 
content was most affected by stress, indicating strong antioxidant responses. 
With these interesting variations in fruit quality came a different response in 
plant yield. Plants belonging to the Lauretta and AN15,07,53 cultivars 
maintained a 98% fruit yield when grown under WS1 conditions. While the yield 
for the Francesca cultivar increased by 10% under the stressed WS1 conditions in 
comparison to the control conditions, water stress in the WS2 treatment caused a 
strong reduction in yield in all three genotypes. Overall, the findings 
emphasize the importance of identifying for each new cultivar the most 
appropriate water regime in order to amplify the quality of the fruit, thus 
maintaining high production standards and saving water.

Cultural system [hill plasticulture (HC) versus matted row (MR)] and genotype 
interactions affected strawberry fruit quality. In general, fruit soluble solids 
content, total sugar, fructose, glucose, ascorbic acid, titratable acid, and 
citric acid contents were increased in the HC system. Fruit from HC also had 
higher flavonoid contents and antioxidant capacities. Strawberry fruit contains 
flavonols as well as other phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins and phenolic 
acids. Pelargonidin-based anthocyanins such as pelargonidin 3-glucoside, 
pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside-succinate were the 
predominant anthocyanins in strawberry fruit. The content of cyanidin-based 
anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, was much 
lower than that of pelargonidin-based anthocyanins in either system. Strawberry 
fruit from the HC system had significantly higher amounts of p-coumaroylglucose, 
dihydroflavonol, quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin 3-glucuronide, kaempferol 
3-glucoside, kaempferol 3-glucuronide, cyanidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 
3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, and 
pelargonidin 3-glucoside-succinate. Fruits from plants grown in the MR system 
generally had the lowest contents of phenolic acids, flavonols, and 
anthocyanins. Strawberry fruit grown under HC conditions had significantly 
higher peroxyl radicals (ROO*) absorbance capacity (ORAC).

The interaction of small molecule drugs with human serum albumin (HSA) after 
entering the human blood circulation system profoundly affects their 
distribution and absorption in the body, and further influences the activity. 
Thus, the in-depth investigation of drug interactions with HSA is of great 
significance for the optimization of drug candidates, the research and 
development of new drugs, and the risk assessment and control of drug 
combinations. Phenolic acids and flavonoids are valuable in antioxidant, 
antitumor, immunomodulatory studies, and many other fields, which is of great 
value in clinical medication. Here, the binding behaviors of 12 phenolic 
acids/flavonoids to HSA under physiological conditions were simultaneously 
investigated by affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE) method and fluorescence 
spectroscopy for the first time. Results showed the binding behaviors of 12 
substances were related directly to their structures. Even a little change, such 
as the amount of phenolic hydroxyl groups and an extra C=C bond, the binding 
would significantly change. Among them, rosmarinic acid (Ka = 3.880 × 105 M-1, 
n = 1.074, Sudlow site I) showed the best binding ability. Caffeic acid trended 
to bind with Sudlow site II, which meant it could cooperate with the other 
active phenolic acids/flavonoids (like dihydromyricetin and rosmarinic acid) in 
clinical medication to increase the curative effect. Fluorescence method 
verified the accuracy of the results determined by ACE. However, it showed some 
limitations such as fluorescence interference, indicating it was not suitable 
for some determinations. These provide a new reference for the screening of 
potential inhibitors for anticancer and antidiabetic agents.

To identify the major metabolites of resveratrol in rat, rat urine samples were 
pretreated by using solid-phase extraction technique (SPE) with polyamide 
cartridges. And a LC-MS/MS method with electrospray ionisation (ESI), negative 
ion mode and collision induced dissociation (CID), was used to elucidate the 
structures of the major metabolites of resveratrol. According to the results of 
our experiment, we found that the main metabolites of resveratrol were 
resveratrol monoglucuronide (M1), dihydroresveratrol monosulfate (M2), 
resveratrol monosulfate (M3) and dihydroresveratrol (M4).

PURPOSE: Polygonum cuspidatum extract as a traditional Chinese medicine is 
extracted from the dried rhizome and root of Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb.et Zucc. 
Resveratrol is one of its active components. Studies were performed in rats to 
define the tissue distribution and excretion of resveratrol in urine and bile, 
and to characterize (if possible) any metabolites of resveratrol observed in 
tissues after ig 20mg/kg Polygonum cuspidatum extract.
METHOD: For tissue distribution studies, tissues (300 mg) were homogenized and 
centrifuged with methanol, and metabolites found in selected tissue extract were 
identified by LC/MS/MS. For urinary and biliary excretion experiments, urine and 
bile samples were cleaned up by using solid-phase extraction (SPE) with 
polyamide cartridges. All the concentrations of resveratrol in these biological 
samples were determined by HPLC with UV detection.
RESULT: After a single oral dose of 20mg/kg PCE in rats, resveratrol was mainly 
distributed in stomach, duodenum, liver and kidney with detectable metabolites 
resveratrol monoglucuronide and resveratrol monosulfate. The majority of the 
resveratrol was excreted as metabolites, only 0.59% and 0.027% of the dosage 
were excreted in urine and bile respectively as unchanged drug within 24h.

To take advantage of the various pharmacologic activities of soy bean 
isoflavones, more detailed studies of the absorption and excretion rates of 
these compounds in humans and subsequent evaluation of their bioavailabilities 
are required. We conducted a pharmacokinetic study of soybean isoflavones in 
seven healthy male volunteers. After ingestion of 60 g of kinako (baked soybean 
powder, containing 103 micromol daidzein and 112 micromol genistein), changes of 
the isoflavone and metabolite concentrations in plasma, urine and feces were 
measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The plasma concentration of 
genistein increased after 2 h and reached its highest value of 2.44 +/- 0.65 
micromol/L 6 h later. The plasma concentration of daidzein peaked at 1.56 +/- 
0.34 micromol/L at the same time, but it was always lower than that of 
genistein. Peak plasma concentration of O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) and equol 
appeared after the daidzein peak in four and two subjects, respectively. In 
contrast with plasma, daidzein was the main component in urine. Urinary daidzein 
excretion started to increase shortly after the rise in its plasma concentration 
and reached 2.4 micromol/h 8 h after ingestion of kinako. Genistein excretion in 
urine paralleled that of daidzein, but the value at 6 h was about half (1.1 
micromol/h). The majority of ingested isoflavones after ingestion of kinako were 
recovered on d 2 or 3 in the feces. Total recovery of daidzein, O-DMA and equol 
from urine and feces was 54.7%, calculated from daidzein intake; 20.1% of 
administered genistein was recovered as genistein. The half-lives of plasma 
genistein and daidzein were 8.36 and 5.79 h, respectively. The individual plasma 
and urinary concentrations of equol and O-DMA were quite variable; subjects were 
classified as high and low metabolizers. The high plasma concentration of 
isoflavones for at least several hours after a single ingestion of soy protein 
suggests that these compounds may interact with macromolecules and have 
biological effects.

BACKGROUND: solid phase microextraction (SPME) was introduced to bioanalysis 
years ago, but still, it did not find its place in routine analysis, despite the 
many advantages it offers. The limited number of commercial devices and 
protocols ready to be adopted for multi-residue analysis, i.e. untargeted 
metabolomics, are among the most important reasons. In this study, 
HLB-PTFE-coated SPME fibers were optimized for in vitro cell line studies 
targeting the volatilome of cancer cells.
RESULTS: the HLB-PTFE SPME fibers with 10 mm coating length were prepared using 
dip coating approach with home-made HLB particles. The fiber sampling 
optimization and evaluation of its performance was performed in cell line media 
spiked with 18 representative compounds selected from the previous preliminary 
study on A549 lung cancer cell line. The results showed that headspace 
extraction for 20 min at 38 °C followed by 2 min desorption at 230 °C to GC-MS 
provides a reliable method with detection limits in a range of 2.2-43 ng/mL and 
repeatability better than 10% for determination of the volatiles in headspace of 
cell-line media. Moreover, the application of the developed method in B16F10 
melanoma and LL2 lung cell lines revealed successful differentiation based on 
volatilome profiling.
SIGNIFICANCE: the satisfactory results of optimization studies and accordance of 
results obtained here for cell line applications and literature indicate that 
the method developed with HLB-PTFE-coated SPME fibers and GC-MS approach suit 
future IVIVE study and meeting 3Rs rules requirements.

Melatonin is a potentially active signaling molecule and plays a crucial role in 
regulating the growth and development of plants under stress conditions, 
alleviating oxidative damage, enhancing antioxidant defence mechanisms and 
regulating ion homeostasis. This study examined the effects of exogenous 
melatonin application on leaf biomass, ion concentrations, betalains, phenolic 
acid and endogenous melatonin contents comparing red beet (Beta vulgaris L. 
'Ruby Queen' and 'Scarlet Supreme') and white beet ('Rodeo' and 'Ansa') 
cultivars under increasing salinity levels of 50, 150, and 250 mM NaCl. 
Exogenous melatonin increased salinity-induced reductions in fresh and dry 
weights and osmotic potential in leaves. Na+ concentrations rose significantly 
with increasing salinity, but cultivar-specific decreases were observed in K+ 
and Ca2+ concentrations. Additionally, melatonin application improved betalain, 
betanin and neobetanin contents induced by salt stress. Furthermore, melatonin 
application caused salt stress and cultivar-specific changes in phenolic acid 
contents e.g., ferulic acid, sinapic acid, or m-coumaric acid, in soluble free, 
ester- and glycoside-conjugated and cell wall-bound forms. In addition, 
antioxidant enzyme activities and compound contents increased significantly in 
the beets and were subsequently lowered in a cultivar-specific manner by salt 
stress + melatonin treatment. The current findings indicate that exogenous 
melatonin improved plant stress tolerance suppressing reactive oxygen species 
levels, increasing the antioxidant enzyme activities and compound contents and 
reducing the levels of Na+, maintaining an ionic homeostasis in the selected red 
and white sugar beet cultivars. It appears that melatonin application may help 
improve cultivar-specific salt tolerance by enhancing ion homeostasis and 
betalain and phenolic acid production levels in beets.

The antioxidant activity of roasted coffee residues was evaluated. Extraction 
with four solvents (water, methanol, ethanol, and n-hexane) showed that water 
extracts of roasted coffee residues (WERCR) produced higher yields and gave 
better protection for lipid peroxidation. WERCR showed a remarkable protective 
effect on oxidative damage of protein. In addition, WERCR showed scavenging of 
free radicals as well as the reducing ability and to bind ferrous ions, 
indicating that WERCR acts as both primary and secondary antioxidants. The HPLC 
analyses showed that phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid) and 
nonphenolic compounds [caffeine, trigonelline, nicotinic acid, and 
5-(hydroxymethyl)furfuraldehyde] remained in roasted coffee residues. These 
compounds showed a protective effect on a liposome model system. The 
concentrations of flavonoids and polyphenolic compounds in roasted coffee 
residues were 8,400 and 20,400 ppm, respectively. In addition, the Maillard 
reaction products (MRPs) remaining in roasted coffee residues were believed to 
show antioxidant activity. These data indicate that roasted coffee residues have 
excellent potential for use as a natural antioxidant source because the 
antioxidant compounds remained in roasted coffee residues.

The consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains rich in antioxidative 
phytochemicals is associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as 
cancer, coronary heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, cataract, and 
aged-related functional decline. For example, phenolic acids are among the main 
antioxidative phytochemicals in grains that have been shown to be beneficial to 
human health. Corn (Zea mays L.) is a major staple food in several parts of the 
world; thus, the antioxidant activity of several corn types was evaluated. The 
2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl free radical (DPPH*) scavenging activity, total 
phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant capacity of lipid-soluble substances (ACL), 
oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and phenolic acid compositions of 
typical and mutant genotypes (typical-1, waxy, typical-2, and high-amylose) were 
investigated. The DPPH* scavenging activity at 60 min was 34.39-44.51% in 
methanol extracts and 60.41-67.26% in HCl/methanol (1/99, v/v) extracts of corn. 
The DPPH* scavenging activity of alkaline hydrolysates of corn ranged from 48.63 
to 64.85%. The TPC ranged from 0.67 to 1.02 g and from 0.91 to 2.15 g of ferulic 
acid equiv/kg of corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. The 
TPC of alkaline hydrolysates ranged from 2.74 to 6.27 g of ferulic acid equiv/kg 
of corn. The ACL values were 0.41-0.80 and 0.84-1.59 g of Trolox equiv/kg of 
corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. The ORAC values were 
10.57-12.47 and 18.76-24.92 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn in methanol and 
HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. ORAC values of alkaline hydrolysates ranged 
from 42.85 to 68.31 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn. The composition of phenolic 
acids in alkaline hydrolysates of corn was p-hydroxybenzoic acid (5.08-10.6 
mg/kg), vanillic acid (3.25-14.71 mg/kg), caffeic acid (2.32-25.73 mg/kg), 
syringic acid (12.37-24.48 mg/kg), p-coumaric acid (97.87-211.03 mg/kg), ferulic 
acid (1552.48-2969.10 mg/kg), and o-coumaric acid (126.53-575.87 mg/kg). Levels 
of DPPH* scavenging activity, TPC, ACL, and ORAC in HCl/methanol extracts were 
obviously higher than those present in methanol extracts. There was no 
significant loss of antioxidant capacity when corn was dried at relatively high 
temperatures (65 and 93 degrees C) postharvest as compared to drying at ambient 
temperatures (27 degrees C). Alkaline hydrolysates showed very high TPC, ACL, 
and ORAC values when compared to methanol and HCl/methanol extracts. 
High-amylose corn had a better antioxidant capacity than did typical (nonmutant) 
corn genotypes.

Crude extracts of evening primrose meal were prepared in 56% (v/v) acetone and 
separated into six fractions (I-VI) using a Sephadex LH-20 column. Qualitative 
tests for phenolic and vanillin positive compounds produced positive results for 
all fractions. Silica gel thin-layer chromatography of fractions III and V 
allowed the location and isolation of two spots containing moderate to strong 
antioxidative compounds. High-performance liquid chromatography of the spot 
isolated from fraction III showed the resolution of two structurally related 
compounds, whereas that of the spot from fraction V showed the presence of one 
compound. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electron impact mass 
spectrometry produced sufficient evidence to identify the isolated compounds as 
(+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and gallic acid. These compounds accounted for 
about 10.5 and 1.7% of the dry mass of the crude extracts and meal, 
respectively.

The lipophilic character of quercetin suggests that it can cross enterocyte 
membranes via simple diffusion. Therefore, it should be more bioavailable than 
its glucosides, which require preliminary hydrolysis or active transport for 
absorption. However, the published human studies show that quercetin is less 
bioavailable than its glucosides. Assuming that low bioavailability of quercetin 
aglycone provided to humans as a pure substance is the result of its low 
solubility in the digestive tract, we studied its bioavailability from dietary 
sources in which quercetin was dispersed in the food matrix. In a randomized 
crossover study, 9 volunteers took a single dose of either shallot flesh (99.2% 
quercetin glucosides and 0.8% quercetin aglycone) or dry shallot skin (83.3% 
quercetin aglycone and 16.7% quercetin glucosides), providing 1.4 mg quercetin 
per kg of body weight. Blood samples were collected before and after consumption 
of shallot preparations. Plasma quercetin was measured on HPLC with 
electrochemical detection after plasma enzymatic treatment. The maximum plasma 
quercetin concentration of 1.02 +/- 0.13 micromol/L was reached at 2.33 +/- 0.50 
h after shallot flesh consumption compared with 3.95 +/- 0.62 micromol/L at 2.78 
+/- 0.15 h after dry skin consumption. The area under the concentration-time 
curve after dry skin consumption was 47.23 +/- 7.53 micromol x h(-1) x L(-1) and 
was significantly higher than that after shallot flesh intake (22.23 +/- 2.32 
micromol x h(-1) x L(-1)). When provided along with dietary sources, quercetin 
aglycone is more bioavailable than its glucosides in humans. Results point to 
the food matrix as a key factor.

BACKGROUND: Little information is currently available on the role of the gut 
microflora in modulating isoflavone bioavailability or on sex differences in 
isoflavone metabolism and bioavailability.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether chronic soy consumption influences 
isoflavone bioavailability as judged by plasma isoflavone concentrations and 
modified gut microflora activities [beta-glucoside hydrolysis and equol and 
O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) production]. We also examined whether sex 
differences in isoflavone metabolism exist.
DESIGN: A randomized, parallel, controlled study design was used to compare a 
high-soy diet (104 +/- 24 mg total isoflavones/d) with a low-soy diet (0.54 +/- 
0.58 mg total isoflavones/d) in 76 healthy young adults for 10 wk.
RESULTS: Concentrations of isoflavones and their gut microflora metabolites in 
the plasma, urine, and feces were significantly higher in the subjects who 
consumed the high-soy diet than in those who consumed the low-soy diet. 
Concentrations of O-DMA in plasma and urine were higher in the men than in the 
women. Fecal bacteria from subjects consuming both diets could convert daidzein 
to equol ex vivo. Fecal beta-glucosidase activity was significantly higher in 
the subjects who consumed the high-soy diet than in those who consumed the 
low-soy diet.
CONCLUSIONS: Although interindividual variation in isoflavone metabolism was 
high, intraindividual variation was low. Only concentrations of O-DMA in plasma 
and urine appeared to be influenced by sex. Chronic soy consumption does not 
appear to induce many significant changes to the gut metabolism of isoflavones 
other than higher beta-glucosidase activity.

A trend related to adding legume seeds to various products has been observed. 
This work aimed to use fermented red bean/broad bean seeds and their hulls to 
produce extruded snacks with more beneficial nutritional properties and good 
sensory quality. Extruded snacks containing fermented ground seeds (50%) or hull 
(10%) of red bean/broad bean and corn grits with the addition of selected 
herbs/spices (0.5%) were prepared. The chemical composition, phenolic profile, 
antioxidant activity, and sensory quality were analysed. The results showed that 
the protein content ranged from 9 to 22.9 g 100 g-1, phenolic compounds ranged 
from 3.97 to 12.80 mg 100 g-1 (with the addition of herbs/spices, even up to 
62.88 mg 100 g-1), and antioxidant activities ranged from 4.32 to 10.23 Trolox 
g-1 (ABTS assay), depending on the type of fermented materials. The addition of 
ground seeds/hull did not influence the consumer desirability, whereas the 
addition of selected herbs/spices, particularly lovage, increased it. The 
application of fermented red bean and broad bean seeds and their hulls, as part 
of the assumptions of the planetary diet, enabled enrichment of extruded corn 
products, which are often consumed by vegans and vegetarians, with nutritionally 
valuable ingredients.

Neurodegeneration in Huntington disease (HD) contributes to dopaminergic system 
dysfunction via the loss of striatal medium spiny neurons expressing dopamine 
receptors. Given the key role for ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in dopamine 
synthesis and neurotransmission, we investigated whether mild cellular ascorbate 
deficiency accelerates dopaminergic dysfunction in the development of HD 
pathology and behavioral deficits. YAC128 mice expressing mutant human 
huntingtin were crossed with SVCT2+/- mice, which carry a heterozygous knockout 
of the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter, to generate mice with 
approximately 30% decreased neuronal vitamin C as well as progressive changes in 
dopamine signaling. Behavioral and neurochemical outcomes were assessed at early 
disease stages. At 14 and 20 weeks, YAC128 and SVCT2+/- YAC128 mice showed 
similar deficits in grip strength, locomotor activity, and rotarod performance 
compared to controls, suggesting modest ascorbate deficiency did not accelerate 
motor phenotypes. Gene expression analysis revealed six significantly 
upregulated genes in the striatum of SVCT2+/- YAC128 mice, including those 
involved in dopamine synthesis, packaging, and transport. Notably, striatal 
dopamine and serotonin and their metabolites were decreased in both single 
mutant mouse lines (YAC128 and SVCT2+/-) but without a compounding effect of the 
double mutation (SVCT2+/- YAC128). These results indicate that while moderate 
ascorbate deficiency may not worsen early behavioral phenotypes in the YAC128 
model, it does impact dopamine system regulation at the molecular level. These 
findings highlight the potential importance of ascorbate in modifying disease 
progression and suggest that humans with HD, who cannot synthesize ascorbate, 
may be particularly vulnerable to vitamin C deficiency effects on dopamine 
dynamics.

OBJECTIVE: A new type of antibacterial and antioxidant carbon dots has been 
discovered.
METHODS: In this study, a facile one-step hydrothermal method was employed to 
synthesize carbon dots (CDs) using Yongchuan Xiuya as the precursor.
RESULTS: The morphology and chemical composition of the synthesized CDs were 
systematically characterized. The resulting doped carbon quantum dots (CDs) 
exhibited a spherical shape with an average particle size of 4.17 nm and a 
lattice spacing of 0.22 nm. The CDs demonstrated exceptional antioxidant and 
antibacterial properties, showing significant antimicrobial activity against 
both Gram-positive (S. aureus) and Gram-negative (E. coli) bacteria, with 
minimum inhibitory concentration values of 0.62 mg/mL and 0.85 mg/mL, 
respectively. Mechanistic studies revealed that bacterial cell death likely 
results from strong electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged 
bacterial surfaces and the positively charged CDs.
CONCLUSION: This work presents a cost-effective and eco-friendly approach to 
producing carbon dots with dual functionality as both antibacterial and 
antioxidant agents.

High perishability and strong seasonality of blueberries provide challenges for 
annual supply, and freezing is key to solving these issues. Conventional slow 
freezing (SF) often causes severe flavor quality loss, whereas in this study, 
quick freezing (QF) can alleviate this by maintaining cellular microstructure 
(fruit texture and cellular integrity via smaller ice crystal formation) and 
regulating fatty acid metabolism (inhibited LOX activity). Metabolomics based on 
GC-MS and UPLC-MS/MS showed that typical biomarkers in volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs) were fatty acid-VOCs hexanal (18.25-fold higher in QF than SF) 
and (E)-2-hexenal (5.71-fold higher in QF than SF) with 'green', 'sweet', and 
'grassy' odor and in non-VOCs was α-linolenic acid (1.34-fold higher in SF than 
QF). Moreover, fatty acid metabolism with VcFADs, VcLOXs, and VcADHs could 
integrate microstructure preservation with metabolic reprogramming. Hence, QF 
reduced blueberry flavor loss by virtue of this structural-metabolic coupling 
effect. This study provides a theoretical reference for regulating the flavor 
loss and enhancing the freeze-thaw stability of frozen blueberries during 
processing and storage.

Anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins were characterized by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS coupled 
with a diode array and/or fluorescent detector in seven cultivars of Ribes 
nigrum (black currant) and Ribes rubrum (red currant, Red Lake), six cultivars 
of Ribes grossularia (gooseberries), Aronia melanocarpa(chokeberry), and 
Sambucus nigra (elderberry). Thirty-one different anthocyanins were detected in 
these berries, but not every anthocyanin was observed in each berry. A number of 
minor anthocyanins were identified from these berries for the first time. The 
concentrations of individual anthocyanins in all of the berries were quantified 
using relevant anthocyanidin 3-glucoside standards. Among the berries studied in 
this paper and in berries in general, chokeberry has the highest total 
anthocyanin concentrations [1480 mg/100 g of fresh weight (FW)], whereas the 
lowest total anthocyanin concentration in the berries studied was found in the 
gooseberry cv. Careless, which contained only 0.07 mg/100 g of FW. Two cultivars 
of gooseberries (Marigold and Leveller) did not contain any anthocyanins. Total 
proanthocyanidin concentrations in the berries studied ranged from 23 to 664 
mg/100 g of FW in elderberry and chokeberry, respectively. Procyanidin or 
prodelphinidin polymers were the predominant components (>65% w/w) in most of 
the berries. The lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities were measured 
by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC(FL)) procedure. The total 
antioxidant capacity varied from 21 micromol of TE/g of FW in Careless 
gooseberry to 161 micromol of TE/g of FW in chokeberry. Total phenolics in the 
berries in general paralleled hydrophilic antioxidant capacity.

Weaning pigs (7.9 +/- 1.7 kg) were fed a freeze-dried powder of marionberry (MB) 
by stomach tube to study the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins. Four 
major anthocyanins (ACNs) were found in MB: cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-glc, 
78%), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (Cy-3-rutin, 20%), pelargonidin-3-glucoside 
(Pg-3-glc, 0.4%), and 1 unknown acylated cyanidin-based ACN (UACy, 1.5%). In the 
urine, the 4 original ACNs and 11 metabolites were identified and quantified. 
The main metabolites were glucuronidated and/or methylated forms of the original 
anthocyanins. Total recovery of the 4 original ACNs plus their related 
metabolites was 0.087 +/- 0.034% for Cy-3-glc, 0.084 +/- 0.026% for Cy-3-rutin, 
0.583 +/- 0.229% for Pg-3-glc and 0.036 +/- 0.011% for UACy (mean +/- SD, n = 
3), respectively. For the individual ACNs, the amount of metabolites recovered 
from Cy-3-rutin was lower than that of the original intact Cy-3-rutin, whereas 
the amounts of metabolites from Cy-3-glc and Pg-3-glc in the urine were much 
higher than their original forms. In pig plasma, the 2 original ACNs, Cy-3-glc 
and Cy-3-rutin, and a trace of 1 metabolite (cyanidin monoglucuronide) were 
detected. The plasma concentration:dose ratio of Cy-3-rutin was higher than that 
of Cy-3-glc. Different aglycones and/or sugar moieties may influence the 
absorption and metabolism of ACNs. Cy-3-glc and Cy-3-rutin had similar apparent 
excretion rates relative to dose, whereas Pg-3-glc had a much higher total 
urinary excretion than cyanidin-based anthocyanins. Most of Cy-3-glc and 
Pg-3-glc were excreted in the form of metabolites, whereas most of the 
Cy-3-rutin was excreted in its original unmetabolized form. Urinary recovery of 
the acylated anthocyanin was lower than that of nonacylated anthocyanins.

Both lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities were determined using the 
oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC(FL)) assay with fluorescein as the 
fluorescent probe and 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride as a peroxyl 
radical generator on over 100 different kinds of foods, including fruits, 
vegetables, nuts, dried fruits, spices, cereals, infant, and other foods. Most 
of the foods were collected from four different regions and during two different 
seasons in U.S. markets. Total phenolics of each sample were also measured using 
the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. Hydrophilic ORAC(FL) values (H-ORAC(FL)) ranged 
from 0.87 to 2641 micromol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g among all of the foods, 
whereas lipophilic ORAC(FL) values (L-ORAC(FL)) ranged from 0.07 to 1611 
micromol of TE/g. Generally, L-ORAC(FL) values were <10% of the H-ORAC(FL) 
values except for a very few samples. Total antioxidant capacity was calculated 
by combining L-ORAC(FL) and H-ORAC(FL). Differences of ORAC(FL) values in fruits 
and vegetables from different seasons and regions were relatively large for some 
foods but could not be analyzed in detail because of the sampling scheme. Two 
different processing methods, cooking and peeling, were used on selected foods 
to evaluate the impact of processing on ORAC(FL). The data demonstrated that 
processing can have significant effects on ORAC(FL). Considering all of the 
foods analyzed, the relationship between TP and H-ORAC(FL) showed a very weak 
correlation. Total hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant capacity intakes were 
calculated to be 5558 and 166 micromol of TE/day, respectively, on the basis of 
data from the USDA Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994-1996).

To investigate the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins (ACNs) with 
different aglycones and sugar moieties, weanling pigs (11.4 +/- 3.8 kg) were 
fed, in a single meal, a freeze-dried powder of chokeberry, black currant, or 
elderberry at a single dose of 229, 140, or 228 mumol total ACN/kg body weight 
(BW), respectively. These berries provided ACNs with differences in aglycone as 
well as some unique differences in the sugar moieties. The relative proportions 
of the different metabolites depended upon concentrations, quantities consumed, 
and types of glycoside of ACNs in the berry. Delphinidin ACNs were not 
metabolized to any measurable extent. Cyanidin ACNs were metabolized via 
methylation and glucuronidation as well as by formation of both derivatives on 
the same ACN molecule. ACNs with either a di- or trisaccharide attached to them 
were excreted in the urine primarily as the intact form. Over 80% of the ACN 
compounds containing rutinose or sambubiose, which were excreted in the urine 
from black currant, elderberry, or Marion blackberry, were excreted as the 
intact molecule. The limited metabolism of these ACNs that did occur was via 
methylation. ACN monoglycosides other than the glucoside were metabolized via 
methylation and/or glucuronide formation. The monoglucuronide that formed 
represented a small proportion of the metabolites relative to the methylated or 
the mixed methylated and glucuronide forms of ACNs. The data clearly demonstrate 
that the aglycone and the sugar moieties can alter the apparent absorption and 
metabolism of ACNs.

Breviscapine, is the total flavonoid components (the content of scutellarin > or 
=85%) extracted from the dried whole plant of Erigeron breviscapus (VANT.) 
HAND.-MAZZ, and its preparations are generally used in the clinic for the 
treatment of cerebral and cardio-vascular diseases in China. In this paper, the 
metabolites of breviscapine in the urine of rats after oral administration were 
investigated. The ten metabolites were isolated by open-column chromatography 
and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography, and their structures 
were elucidated by MS, NMR spectroscopy including (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, and NOESY 
(nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy), enzymatic hydrolysis and chemical 
evidence. The ten metabolites were identified as 
scutellarein-6,7-di-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-1), scutellarein (M-2), 
6-O-methyl-scutellarin (M-3), 6-O-methyl-scutellarein (M-4), 
scutellarein-6-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-5), scutellarein-5-O-beta-D-glucuronide 
(M-6), scutellarin (M-7), scutellarein-7-O-sulfate (M-8), 
apigenin-5-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-9), and apigenin-4'-O-beta-D-glucuronide 
(M-10) respectively. The results of this study indicated that the metabolites of 
brevisvapine were excreted in rats urine as glucuronidated, sulfated or 
methylated forms, as well as the aglycone of scutellarin-scutellarein after oral 
administration, and the metabolic pathways were also proposed.

Soy isoflavones are potentially beneficial phytoestrogens, but their 
tissue-selective effects in women are poorly understood. We tested the 
hypothesis that soy isoflavones affect bone mineral density (BMD), which may be 
influenced by individual differences in isoflavone metabolism and serum calcium 
levels. Ninety-nine healthy premenopausal women were randomized to isoflavones 
(136.6 mg aglycone equivalence) and 98 to placebo for 5 days per week for up to 
2 years. BMD, serum calcium, and urinary excretion of daidzein and genistein 
were measured before and during treatment. In 129 adherent subjects, we found 
that isoflavone exposure, determined by urinary excretion levels, but not by 
dose assignment, interacted with serum calcium in affecting whole body BMD, but 
not hip and spine BMD. The regression coefficient was -0.042 for genistein 
excretion (GE) and 0.091 for the interaction between GE and serum calcium (all 
P < .05). Daidzein excretion had similar but marginal effect. Genistein 
significantly decreased whole body BMD only at low normal serum calcium levels 
but increased whole body BMD at higher serum calcium levels. Comparing maximum 
to minimum GE, mean changes in whole body BMD were +0.033 and -0.113 g/cm2 at 
serum calcium levels of 10 and 8.15 mg/dL, respectively. These associations were 
not evident by intention-to-treat analysis, which could not model for 
inter-individual differences in isoflavone metabolism. In summary, soy 
isoflavones decrease whole body BMD only when serum calcium is low. Isoflavones 
are dietary substances that may influence calcium homeostasis by releasing 
calcium from bone while sparing the common fracture risk sites hip and spine.

Estrogen metabolism may play an important role in mammary carcinogenesis in 
postmenopausal women. We evaluated the effects of prior oral contraceptive (OC) 
treatment and current soy isoflavone consumption on endogenous estrogen 
metabolite concentration and biomarkers of tissue estrogen exposure in a monkey 
model. One hundred eighty-one female cynomolgus macaques were randomized to 
receive OC or placebo for 26 months premenopausally, then ovariectomized and 
randomized to one of three diets for 36 months: an isoflavone-depleted soy 
protein isolate (Soy-) diet, a diet containing soy protein isolate with a human 
equivalent of 129 mg isoflavone/d (Soy+), or a Soy- diet supplemented with 
conjugated equine estrogens (CEE+) at a human equivalent dose of 0.625 mg/d. 
Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography directly coupled with 
tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure the concentrations of estrogen 
species in urine samples. Generally, prior OC treatment was associated with 
significantly reduced urinary estrogen metabolites (25-55% reduction; P<0.05 for 
each versus OC-). Animals that consumed isoflavones postmenopausally had 
increased urinary 2-hydroxyestrone and 16alpha-hydroxyestrone (50% and 56% 
increases, respectively), but reduced levels of 2-hydroxyestradiol, 
2-methoxyestradiol, and 17-epiestriol (92%, 63%, and 66%, respectively), 
compared with animals fed a Soy- diet. Isoflavones did not have widespread 
effects on uterine or mammary proliferation biomarkers, whereas prior OC 
significantly reduced two of three proliferation end points in the endometrium. 
Premenopausal OCs may have long-term systemic effects on response to estrogen 
and its metabolism whereas postmenopausal dietary isoflavones may alter 
endogenous estrogen metabolism in a modest but selective manner.

their epimers.

Canned and bottled tea drinks contain not only green tea epicatechins (GTE), 
namely (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECG), 
(-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and (-)-epicatechin (EC), but also four GTE epimers, 
namely (-)-gallocatechin gallate (GCG), (-)-catechin gallate (CG), 
(-)-gallocatechin (GC) and (-)-catechin (C). In the present study we examined 
the antioxidant activity and bioavailability of these epimers compared with 
their corresponding precursors. The epimerisation reaction was induced by 
autoclaving GTE extract derived from longjing green tea at 120 degrees C for 20 
min. Isolation and purification of each GTE and epimer were accomplished by 
various column chromatographic and semi-preparative HPLC techniques. The 
antioxidant activity of each epimer with its corresponding GTE precursor was 
conducted in the three in vitro systems, namely human LDL oxidation, ferric 
reducing-antioxidant power (FRAP), and anti-2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) 
free radical assays. The results of all three assays demonstrated that CG had 
similar antioxidant activity with its precursor ECG, while GC was less potent as 
an antioxidant than its precursor EGC. Regarding EGCG and GCG, the antioxidant 
potency was similar for both LDL oxidation and DPPH free radical assays, but GCG 
was statistically less effective than EGCG in the FRAP assay. For EC and C, the 
latter had less anti-free radical activity in the DPPH assay, but in LDL 
oxidation and FRAP assays the antioxidant activity was similar. Oral and 
intravenous dosing of GTE-epimer mixture led to increase in total plasma 
antioxidant capacity in rats. In general, both epicatechins and epimers had low 
bioavailability (0.08-0.31) and most of the observed differences between 
epicatechins and their corresponding epimers were small, even if they were 
statistically significant in some cases. It was concluded that the epimerisation 
reaction occurring in manufacturing canned and bottled tea drinks would not 
significantly affect antioxidant activity and bioavailability of total tea 
polyphenols.

Wu-tou decoction has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine prescription 
for thousands of years. It comprises five herbs, namely Radix Aconiti Preparata, 
Ephedrae Herba, Astragali Radix, Glycyrrhiza Radix, and Paeoniae Radix Alba. In 
addition, the original prescription contains honey, but in modern research, the 
existence of honey is commonly ignored. The aim was to investigate the effect of 
absorption in rats after oral wu-tou decoction with or without honey. In this 
research, a rapid and sensitive UPLC-MS/MS method was investigated for the 
quantitative analysis of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, paeoniflorin, 
calycosin-7-glucoside, glycyrrhizic acid, liquiritin, and benzoylmesaconine in 
rat plasma after single and continuous oral decoctions. The results of the 
pharmacokinetic parameters showed that Cmax , CL/F, AUC0-t , and AUC0-∞ in the 
honey group were significantly increased than those in the non-honey group 
except for ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. The same trend was observed regardless 
of single or continuous oral administrations. Research studies showed that honey 
could promote the absorption of some effective components in wu-tou decoction in 
rats, enhance bioavailability, and provide a theoretical basis for the 
scientific and rational compatibility of the original prescription.

The effects of soaking, boiling and steaming processes on the total phenolic 
components and antioxidant activity in commonly consumed cool season food 
legumes (CSFL's), including green pea, yellow pea, chickpea and lentil were 
investigated. As compared to original unprocessed legumes, all processing steps 
caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH free 
radical scavenging activity (DPPH) in all tested CSFL's. All soaking and 
atmospheric boiling treatments caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in oxygen 
radical absorbing capacity (ORAC). However, pressure boiling and pressure 
steaming caused significant (p<0.05) increases in ORAC values. Steaming 
treatments resulted in a greater retention of TPC, DPPH, and ORAC values in all 
tested CSFL's as compared to boiling treatments. To obtain cooked legumes with 
similar palatability and firmness, pressure boiling shortened processing time as 
compared to atmospheric boiling, resulted in insignificant differences in TPC, 
DPPH for green and yellow pea. However, TPC and DPPH in cooked lentils differed 
significantly between atmospheric and pressure boiling. As compared to 
atmospheric processes, pressure processes significantly increased ORAC values in 
both boiled and steamed CSFL's. Greater TPC, DPPH and ORAC values were detected 
in boiling water than that in soaking and steaming water. Boiling also caused 
more solid loss than steaming. Steam processing exhibited several advantages in 
retaining the integrity of the legume appearance and texture of the cooked 
product, shortening process time, and greater retention of antioxidant 
components and activities.

The effects of soaking, boiling, and steaming processes on the phenolic 
components and antioxidant activity of black beans were investigated. All 
processed beans exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) lower antioxidant activities 
than raw beans in total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH free radical scavenging 
activity (DPPH), and oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC). Steaming 
processes resulted in a greater retention of TPC and ORAC values than the 
boiling processes. Pressure boiling shortened processing time compared to 
regular boiling, resulted in insignificant differences in TPC, but significantly 
increased in ORAC as compared to the regular boiling method. Pressure steaming 
resulted in significant decreases in TPC, DPPH, while significantly increased in 
ORAC compared to regular steaming. Greater TPC, DPPH, and ORAC values were 
detected in boiling water than in the soaking and steaming water. Mass balance 
analysis showed that boiling caused more dry solid loss than steaming. All of 
these results indicated that processing methods significantly changed contents 
and activities of antioxidant components of black beans. Steam processing 
exhibited several advantages in appearance and texture of the cooked product, 
shortening processing time, and in greater retention of TPC and antioxidant 
activities. Steam processing may be used to develop high-quality 
health-promoting black bean products.

Epidemiological studies have indicated that the consumption of fruits and 
vegetables is associated with a reduced risk for the development of chronic 
diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Phytochemicals, including 
phenolics and flavonoids, are suggested to be the major bioactive compounds 
contributing to the health benefits of fruits and vegetables. Onions are a major 
source of dietary flavonoids; however, there may exist varietal differences in 
composition, concentration, and beneficial activities. To characterize these 
differences, shallots and 10 onion (Allium cepa L.) varieties commonly available 
in the United States (Western Yellow, Northern Red, New York Bold, Western 
White, Peruvian Sweet, Empire Sweet, Mexico, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley Sweet, 
and Vidalia) were evaluated for total phenolic and flavonoid contents and 
antioxidant and antiproliferative activities. Shallots contained the highest 
total phenolic content (114.7 +/- 10.0 mg/100 g of sample) among the varieties 
tested, with a 6-fold difference observed when compared to the variety with the 
lowest phenolic content (Vidalia, p < 0.05). Western Yellow onion variety 
exhibited the highest total flavonoid content (69.2 +/- 3.7 mg/100 g of onion) 
of the varieties tested, with an 11-fold difference when compared to the variety 
with the lowest flavonoid content (Western White, p < 0.05). Shallots exhibited 
the highest total antioxidant activity (45.5 +/- 2.1 micromol of vitamin C 
equiv/g of onion), followed by Western Yellow, New York Bold, Northern Red, 
Mexico, Empire Sweet, Western White, Peruvian Sweet, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley 
Sweet, and Vidalia. For all varieties, both total phenolic and flavonoid 
contents were strongly correlated with total antioxidant activity (R (2) = 
0.9668, p < 0.05; and R (2) = 0.7033, p < 0.05, respectively). The proliferation 
of HepG(2) and Caco-2 cells was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent 
fashion after exposure to the Western Yellow, shallots, New York Bold, and 
Northern Red extracts, with Western Yellow, shallots, and New York Bold 
exhibiting the highest antiproliferative activity against HepG(2) cells and New 
York Bold and Western Yellow exhibiting the highest antiproliferative activity 
against Caco-2 cells. However, the varieties of Western White, Peruvian Sweet, 
Empire Sweet, Mexico, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley Sweet, and Vidalia 
demonstrated weak antiproliferative activity against both HepG(2) and Caco-2 
cells. These results may influence consumers toward purchasing onion varieties 
exhibiting greater potential health benefits and may significantly affect future 
breeding efforts to enhance onion nutritional qualities.

To explore the metabolism of 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (1,5-DCQA) in rats, 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in parallel to diode-array detection was 
used for the rapid detection/characterization of the metabolites formed in bile, 
urine, and plasma of rats following oral administration of 1,5-DCQA (160 mg/kg). 
The methylation and glucuronidation of 1,5-DCQA occurring in vitro using rat 
liver and small intestinal microsomes and cytosols were studied in comparison 
with those occurring in vivo, and the enzymes involved were also determined. In 
addition, the anti-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) activity of three 
important metabolites was preliminarily evaluated in MT-4 cells infected with 
HIV-1. A total of 22 metabolites in vivo and in vitro were identified, including 
four isomeric O-mono-methylated metabolites (M8-M11), nine isomeric 
O-di-methylated metabolites (M3, M6, M22, and M12-M17), four isomeric 
O-mono-methyl-glucuronidated metabolites (M2 and M19-M21), four isomeric 
O-di-methyl-glucuronidated metabolites (M1, M4, M5, and M7), and one 
glucuronidated metabolite (M18). The O-methylation positions of three important 
metabolites (M8, M9, and M12) were determined (3''-, 3'-, and 3',3''-) by 
comparing with synthesized standards. The efficacy experiments showed that M8, 
M9, and M12 could inhibit HIV replication with IC(50) values of about 25, 25, 
and 46 microM, respectively. These results suggest that O-methylation and 
glucuronidation are two important metabolic pathways of 1,5-DCQA, that both rat 
liver and small intestine can catalyze such reactions by 
catechol-O-methyltransferase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and that the 
HIV-1 inhibitory activity of M8, M9, and M12 is comparable to or slightly weaker 
than that of 1,5-DCQA.

Patatin-related phospholipase As (pPLAs) are major hydrolases acting on 
acyl-lipids and play important roles in various plant developmental processes. 
pPLAIII group members, which lack a canonical catalytic Ser motif, have been 
less studied than other pPLAs. We report here the characterization of pPLAIIIα 
in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) based on the biochemical and physiological 
characterization of pPLAIIIα knockouts, complementants, and overexpressors, as 
well as heterologous expression of the protein. In vitro activity assays on the 
purified recombinant protein showed that despite lack of canonical phospholipase 
motifs, pPLAIIIα had a phospholipase A activity on a wide variety of 
phospholipids. Overexpression of pPLAIIIα in Arabidopsis resulted in a decrease 
in many lipid molecular species, but the composition in major lipid classes was 
not affected. Fluorescence tagging indicated that pPLAIIIα localizes to the 
plasma membrane. Although Arabidopsis pplaIIIα knockout mutants showed some 
phenotypes comparable to other pPLAIIIs, such as reduced trichome length and 
increased hypocotyl length, control of seed size and germination were identified 
as distinctive pPLAIIIα-mediated functions. Expression of some PLD genes was 
strongly reduced in the pplaIIIα mutants. Overexpression of pPLAIIIα caused 
increased resistance to turnip crinkle virus, which associated with a 2-fold 
higher salicylic acid/jasmonic acid ratio and an increased expression of the 
defense gene pathogenesis-related protein1. These results therefore show that 
pPLAIIIα has functions that overlap with those of other pPLAIIIs but also 
distinctive functions, such as the control of seed germination. This study also 
provides new insights into the pathways downstream of pPLAIIIα.

In this study, some chemical components of hemp seed, which widely consumed as 
snack food in Middle East were determined. The effects of different roasting 
temperatures (140, 160 and 180 °C) and times (0-60 min) on the oxidative 
stability and antioxidant content of hemp seed oil were investigated. Hemp seed 
oil contained high levels of linoleic acid (54.85%), α-linolenic acid (18.13%) 
and γ-tocopherol (707.47 mg/kg oil). While tocopherol isomers decreased with 
increasing roasting time and temperature, total phenolic content and antioxidant 
activity showed increasing trend. The peroxide and p-anisidine values of roasted 
samples varied from 1.33 to 3.09 meq O2 /kg oil and 1.65 to 43.27, respectively. 
The peroxide and p-anisidine values of samples were simultaneously generated at 
the early stage of roasting. Kinetic evaluation of data showed that peroxides 
act as limiting factor in autocatalytic oxidation reactions. The order and rate 
constant regarding peroxide value were similar with those of p-anisidine value. 
The effects of roasting temperature and time on the oxidation parameters and 
antioxidant contents of samples were significant (p < 0.05). Based on peroxide 
and p-anisidine values, roasting at 140-160 °C for 35 min or at 180 °C for 
15 min are recommended to provide good quality roasted hemp seed.

Naringenin chalcone is the main active component of tomato skin extract, which 
has an antiallergic activity. In this study, naringenin chalcone was orally 
administered to rats, and the chemical structures and levels of the major 
metabolites in the plasma and urine of rats were determined. HPLC analysis 
indicated the presence of three major metabolites in the urine. LC-MS and NMR 
analyses tentatively identified these as naringenin 
chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide, naringenin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide, and 
naringenin-4'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Naringenin chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide 
was the only metabolite detected in the plasma, and its peak plasma level was 
observed 1 h after naringenin chalcone administration. Naringenin 
chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide also inhibited histamine release from rat 
peritoneal mast cells stimulated with compound 48/80. This activity might 
contribute to the antiallergic activity of naringenin chalcone in vivo. To the 
best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to report determination 
of naringenin chalcone metabolites in rat plasma and urine.

Fruit and vegetable intake is inversely correlated with risks for several 
chronic diseases in humans. Phytochemicals, and in particular, phenolic 
compounds, present in plant foods may be partly responsible for these health 
benefits through a variety of mechanisms. Since environmental factors play a 
role in a plant's production of secondary metabolites, it was hypothesized that 
an organic agricultural production system would increase phenolic levels. 
Cultivars of leaf lettuce, collards, and pac choi were grown either on 
organically certified plots or on adjacent conventional plots. Nine prominent 
phenolic agents were quantified by HPLC, including phenolic acids (e. g. caffeic 
acid and gallic acid) and aglycone or glycoside flavonoids (e. g. apigenin, 
kaempferol, luteolin, and quercetin). Statistically, we did not find significant 
higher levels of phenolic agents in lettuce and collard samples grown 
organically. The total phenolic content of organic pac choi samples as measured 
by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, however, was significantly higher than 
conventional samples (p < 0.01), and seemed to be associated with a greater 
attack the plants in organic plots by flea beetles. These results indicated that 
although organic production method alone did not enhance biosynthesis of 
phytochemicals in lettuce and collards, the organic system provided an increased 
opportunity for insect attack, resulting in a higher level of total phenolic 
agents in pac choi.

Various protein-rich foods are traditionally immersed in virgin olive oil (VOO), 
a medium rich in phenols, which are health-promoting and sensorially important 
compounds. Immersing tofu in VOO may modify the sensory properties and 
nutritional value of both due to the oil's hydrophilic phenol interactions with 
proteins and water. In this study, cubes of fresh tofu (T) (70% water) and 
freeze-dried tofu (FD-T) (5% water) were immersed in VOO for 7 days of cold 
storage. The changes in the phenolic compound content and standard quality 
parameters of the oil were noted after 1, 3, 5, and 7 days of contact with the 
tofu. The total phenols in the oil were determined using the Fast Blue BB assay, 
while single phenols were analyzed by HPLC-UV/VIS. During the 7 days, the total 
phenols in the oil decreased by up to 56% and 26% under the influence of fresh 
and freeze-dried tofu, respectively, including a significant decrease in 
hydroxytyrosol, oleacein, tyrosol, and oleocanthal. The water content and its 
release from fresh tofu significantly contributed to this decline. The 
degradation of the quality of the oil in contact with the fresh tofu was 
observed only in its sensory properties, with a marked reduction in the 
intensity of its fruitiness, bitterness and pungency.

In recent years the nutritional and bioactive properties of foods are being 
intensively investigated with a view to control, in addition to food quality, 
their possible influence on human health. Because of this, there is a growing 
demand for rapid, selective, sensitive, and validated methods for analysis and 
quantification. Bioactive plant compounds include those with weak estrogenic 
activity (phytoestrogens), among which are the isoflavones. Some of the 
beneficial activities that have been attributed to isoflavones are 
anticarcinogenic activity, the prevention of cardiovascular disease, the 
improvement of bone health, and antioxidant activity. The objective of this work 
is to provide an updated review of the methods used in sample preparation and 
subsequent analysis for the determination of isoflavones in food samples, 
including both soybean and soy products, as well as other foods with low 
isoflavone contents. The review focuses on the most common sample preparation 
techniques used during the last 10 years, including both conventional solvent 
extraction and other more recent extraction techniques. Separation and detection 
methods, including current trends in liquid chromatography analysis, such as the 
use of monolithic columns or ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography, are also 
discussed.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pregnant women across the globe, in the Eastern Mediterranean 
Region (EMR), face various dietary obstacles during their pregnancy. In this 
region, characterized by diverse cultural preferences and traditions, 
emergencies such as conflicts, natural disasters, epidemics, and displacement 
continue to exist. This influences food insecurity in the region, particularly 
among pregnant women. This review aims to enhance maternal and fetal health by 
analyzing these nutritional challenges and assessing women's nutrient 
consumption in accordance with the USDA's 2020-2025 Nutritional Guidelines for 
Pregnant Women, with particular attention to significant nutrient deficiencies. 
It provides a comprehensive examination of the existing literature and data 
regarding maternal nutrition in the EMR, highlights deficiencies in data 
collection and analysis, calls for national surveys, and emphasizes the 
necessity of raising awareness about the adequate nutrition to improve health 
outcomes for mothers and their infants in the region. The USDA guidelines were 
selected for comparisons as they are internationally recognized standards. To 
enhance the analysis, WHO regional standards were also used, offering 
context-specific insights that complement the USDA framework.
RECENT FINDINGS: Pregnant women in the EMR commonly experience nutrient 
inadequacies, particularly in carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables. A healthy 
nutritious diet during pregnancy contributes to optimal fetal growth and 
increases the potential for long-term health for mothers and their offspring. 
Many antioxidants (vitamin A, C, and E, carotenoids and flavonoids) are derived 
from the inclusion of vegetables and fruits in pregnant women's diets. 
Additionally, they also provide folates, potassium and fiber. Starchy 
carbohydrates and fiber containing whole grain cereals and vegetables are the 
fundamentals of a healthy diet allowing for good body's functioning and 
providing energy as a primary source. Whole grain cereal products are 
particularly rich in minerals, vitamins, and dietary fibers. The study 
highlights lack of intake in milk and dairy products, sources of iodine, 
essential for cognitive fetal growth, in addition to an insufficient amount of 
vitamin D, which is protective against gestational diabetes, as well as vitamin 
C, essential for immunity and antioxidant properties. The findings emphasize the 
importance of conducting national surveys among pregnant women in the EMR Region 
countries to gain a clearer understanding of their food intake and inform the 
development of targeted interventions. The study focuses on significant nutrient 
deficiencies and dietary challenges faced by pregnant women in EMR, emphasizing 
the need for targeted surveys and educational initiatives.

PURPOSE: Resveratrol, a phenolic phytoalexin occurring in grapes, wine, peanuts, 
and cranberries, has been reported to have anticarcinogenic, antioxidative, 
phytoestrogenic, and cardioprotective activities. Because little is known about 
the metabolism of this potentially important compound, the in vitro and in vivo 
metabolism of trans-resveratrol were investigated.
METHODS: The in vitro experiments included incubation with human liver 
microsomes, human hepatocytes, and rat hepatocytes and the in vivo studies 
included oral or intraperitoneal administration of resveratrol to rats and mice. 
Methanol extracts of rat urine, mouse serum, human hepatocytes, rat hepatocytes, 
and human liver microsomes were analyzed for resveratrol metabolites using 
reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with on-line 
ultraviolet-photodiode array detection and mass spectrometric detection 
(LC-DAD-MS and LC-UV-MS-MS). UV-photodiode array analysis facilitated the 
identification of cis- and trans-isomers of resveratrol and its metabolites. 
Negative ion electrospray mass spectrometric analysis provided molecular weight 
confirmation of resveratrol metabolites and tandem mass spectrometry allowed 
structural information to be obtained.
RESULTS: No resveratrol metabolites were detected in the microsomal incubations, 
and no phase I metabolites, such as oxidations, reductions, or hydrolyzes, were 
observed in any samples. However, abundant trans-resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide and 
trans-resveratrol-3-sulfate were identified in rat urine, mouse serum, and 
incubations with rat and human hepatocytes. Incubation with beta-glucuronidase 
and sulfatase to release free resveratrol was used to confirm the structures of 
these conjugates. Only trace amounts of cis-resveratrol were detected, 
indicating that isomerization was not an important factor in the metabolism and 
elimination of resveratrol.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that trans-resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide and 
trans-resveratrol-3-sulfate are the most abundant metabolites of resveratrol. 
Virtually no unconjugated resveratrol was detected in urine or serum samples, 
which might have implications regarding the significance of in vitro studies 
that used only unconjugated resveratrol.

The composition of phenolic acids in several small berries grown in Northeastern 
Poland, namely, low-bush blueberries, black mulberries, European juneberries, 
black currants, fruits of blue-berried honeysuckle, and blackberries, was 
determined by gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS). The total 
content of phenolic acids, identified by GC-MS, ranged from 2845.8 +/- 141.0 
(black mulberries) to 5418.2 +/- 228.0 (blue-berried honeysuckle). Twenty 
phenolic acids were identified in the berries. Of these, hydroxycaffeic, m- and 
p-coumaric, and 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acids were the major phenolic acids in 
blackberries and blueberries, m-coumaric acid was the major phenolic acid in 
blue-berried honeysuckle and black currant fruits, while salicylic, caffeic, and 
m- and p-coumaric acids were the predominant phenolic acids in European 
juneberries. Syringic and veratric acids were detected only in blueberries, 
while p-hydroxybenzoic and sinapic acids were present only in black currants and 
o-coumaric acid was present in blueberries and black mulberries. The phenolic 
acids liberated from esters and glycosidic bonds were the major fractions of 
phenolic acids in the berries.

From red raspberries, ellagic acid, its 4-arabinoside, its 4' (4' '-acetyl) 
arabinoside, and its 4' (4' '-acetyl)xyloside, as well as quercetin and 
kaempferol 3-glucosides, were identified. In addition, two unidentified ellagic 
acid derivatives were detected. The free radical scavenging activity of the 
ellagic acid derivatives was evaluated by using the DPPH method and compared to 
that of Trolox. All of the isolated compounds showed antioxidant activity. The 
effect of processing to obtain jams on raspberry phenolics was evaluated. The 
flavonol content decreased slightly with processing and more markedly during 
storage of the jams. The ellagic acid derivatives, with the exception of ellagic 
acid itself, remained quite stable with processing and during 6 months of jam 
storage. The content of free ellagic acid increased 3-fold during the storage 
period. The initial content (10 mg/kg of fresh weight of raspberries) increased 
2-fold with processing, and it continued increasing up to 35 mg/kg after 1 month 
of storage of the jam. Then a slight decrease was observed until 6 months of 
storage had elapsed. The increase observed in ellagic acid could be explained by 
a release of ellagic acid from ellagitannins with the thermal treatment.

Polyphenol content, free radical scavenging capacity, and changes during storage 
over 7 months in the dark were studied in ecological and conventional red and 
white wines. In red wines, the most changeable components during storage were 
the anthocyanins since during storage anthocyanins content decreased 88% in 
conventional wine and 91% in ecological wine. Initially, the total flavonol 
contents of the conventional and ecological red wines were 163.88 +/- 2.69 and 
153.58 +/- 1.71 mg/L, respectively, and no significant variations occurred 
during storage. No differences in hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives content 
between conventional and ecological red and white wines were observed. The 
flavonol level in white wines was very low, as expected since these compounds 
are found in grape skin. The initial antioxidant activity was 5.37 +/- 0.14 and 
5.82 +/- 0.31 mM equivalents Trolox for conventional and ecological red wines, 
respectively; no significant differences were observed (p = 0.2831), and these 
values were 7-8 times higher than the antioxidant activity observed in 
conventional and ecological white wine. In contrast with other studies, the 
total concentrations of phenolic compounds in conventional and ecological red 
and white wines were not related to antioxidant activity (p > 0.05). In red 
wines, no significant differences were observed in the antioxidant activity of 
ecological and conventional red wine (p = 0.28), while in white wine significant 
differences were observed in the antioxidant activity between conventional and 
ecological white wine (p = 0.006).

BACKGROUND: Nutritional biomarkers may be better measures of dietary exposure 
than self-reported dietary data. We evaluated resveratrol metabolites, potential 
biomarkers of wine consumption, in humans after moderate consumption of 
sparkling, white, or red wines.
METHODS: We performed 2 randomized, crossover trials and a cohort study. In the 
first study, 10 healthy men consumed 30 g of ethanol/day as sparkling wine or 
gin for 28 days. In the second trial, 10 healthy women consumed 20 g of 
ethanol/day as white or red wine for 28 days. We also evaluated 52 participants 
in a study on the effects of a Mediterranean diet on primary prevention of 
cardiovascular disease (the PREDIMED Study). We used liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to analyze urinary total resveratrol 
metabolites (TRMs) and predictive values and ROC curve analyses to assess the 
diagnostic accuracy.
RESULTS: We observed significant increases in TRMs [72.4 (95% confidence 
interval, 48.5-96.2; P = 0.005), 211.5 (166.6-256.3; P = 0.005), and 560.5 
nmol/g creatinine (244.9-876.1; P = 0.005)] after consumption of sparkling, 
white, or red wine, respectively, but no changes after the washout or gin 
periods. In the cohort study, the reported daily dose of wine consumption 
correlated directly with TRMs (r = 0.654; P < 0.001). Using a cutoff of 90 
nmol/g, we were able to use TRMs to differentiate wine consumers from abstainers 
with a sensitivity of 72% (60%-84%); and a specificity of 94% (87%-100%).
CONCLUSIONS: Resveratrol metabolites in urine may be useful biomarkers of wine 
intake in epidemiologic and intervention studies.

The study was aimed at verification of the following hypothesis: differences in 
antioxidant capacity of diets consisting of different cereals and byproducts 
affect the antioxidant status of the consumers of these diets. To validate that 
hypothesis this study investigated the contents of polyphenols and 
alpha-tocopherol as well as the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in vitro of 
cereals and their fractions (barley, husked and naked oat, oat bran, and 
triticale); the nutritional and antioxidant properties of diets containing these 
cereals, applied in a 4-week feeding experiment on rats, were also assessed. 
Among the cereals examined, the highest TAC was reported for barley (13.16 
micromol of Trolox/g) and the lowest for naked oat (3.84 micromol of Trolox/g). 
Compared with cereals, the TAC of buckwheat waste was 2-3 times higher (25.2 
micromol of Trolox/g). The antioxidant capacity of diets, calculated in vitro, 
ranged from 6.35 micromol of Trolox/g for naked oat type diet to 10.51 micromol 
of Trolox/g for barley type diet. Results of an in vitro study were confirmed in 
changes of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and the level of 
thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in the serum of rats fed diets 
with the highest and lowest antioxidant capacities in vitro; the barley diet 
increased the activity of GPx (37.63 units/mL) and decreased the level of TBARS 
(4.82 microg/g), whereas the naked oat diet had an opposite effect (31.16 
units/mL and 5.91 microg/g, respectively).

Anacardium humile, popularly known as cajuzinho-do-cerrado or cajuí, is a native 
fruit from the Brazilian Cerrado biome that shares similarities with Anacardium 
occidentale. This study aimed to characterize the nutritional elements, 
bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activity of yellow- and red-peeled A. 
humile pseudofruits grown in Bonito de Minas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The fruits 
were analyzed for centesimal composition, pH, titratable acidity, total soluble 
solids, color parameters, total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, 
carotenoids, vitamin C, phenolic acids, and antioxidant activity by DPPH, ABTS, 
FRAP, and phosphomolybdenum complex methods. The pseudofruits did not differ in 
moisture, ashes, carbohydrates, soluble solids, titratable acidity, total 
phenolic content, total flavonoid content, carotenoids, and vitamin C 
(p > 0.05). The fruits with red-peeled color exhibited higher protein content 
(3.40% ± 0.33) and lower pH (3.44 ± 0.02) (p < 0.05) than yellow-peeled fruits 
(2.16% ± 0.34 and 3.61 ± 0.06, respectively). Gallic acid was the most abundant 
phenolic acid, especially in the red-peeled fruits (111.0 ± 33.00 µg/g). 
Furthermore, the red-peeled pseudofruits showed higher antioxidant activity by 
DPPH and FRAP assays (41.97 ± 4.51 and 25.20 ± 1.70 mg TE/g, respectively), 
while the yellow-peeled pseudofruits had slightly higher total antioxidant 
capacity by phosphomolybdenum assay (57.47 ± 1.61 mg AAE/g) (p < 0.05). The 
results suggest that A. humile pseudofruits are rich in functional compounds, 
particularly phenolic compounds and vitamin C. These findings can enhance the 
understanding of this nutrient-rich species and encourage its potential 
applications in the development of agro-industrial products.

Fuzi is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. Clinical Fuzi poisoning 
cases have frequently been reported. Glycyrrhizae Radix is often used to 
alleviate Fuzi's toxicity. However, the poisoning mechanism of Fuzi and the 
detoxication mechanism of Glycyrrhizae Radix are still not clear. We identified 
the chemical components of Fuzi at different decoction times (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 
6 h) using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight 
mass spectrometry. A total of 35 compounds were detected in the Fuzi decoction, 
including diester alkaloids, monoester alkaloids, amino acids, phenolic acids, 
organic acids, glycosides, and sugars among others. The content of diester 
alkaloids (i.e., subaconitine, neoaconitine, and aconitine) in the Fuzi 
decoction decreased after 2 h of decoction time, while the content of monoester 
alkaloids (i.e., benzoyl aconitine and benzoyl subaconitine) reached a peak at 
2 h. A total of 32 rats were randomly divided into four groups, including 8 
cases in the low-dosage Fuzi decoction group A, 8 cases in the high-dosage Fuzi 
decoction group B, 8 cases in the Fuzi and glycyrrhizae decoction group C, and 8 
cases in the control group D. The decoction was administered orally for 7 days. 
Then, a serum was obtained. The metabolites' changes were analyzed in serum 
metabolomics using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). 
Statistical analysis and pathway analysis were used to assess the effects of 
glycyrrhizae on the metabolic changes induced by Fuzi. The behavioral and 
biochemical characteristics indicated that Fuzi exhibited toxic effects on rats 
and their metabolic profiles changed. However, the metabolic profiles of the 
glycyrrhizae group became similar to those of the control group. These profiles 
showed that glycyrrhizae can effectively improve Fuzi poisoning rats. Our study 
demonstrated that the established pseudotargeted metabolomics is a powerful 
approach for investigating the mechanisms of herbal toxicity.

This is a report about the identification of key metabolites of tectorigenin in 
rat urine using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization 
ion trap tandem mass spectrometric method (HPLC-ESI-MS(n)). Six healthy rats 
were administered a single dose (80 mg/kg) of tectorigenin by oral gavage. Urine 
was sampled for 0-24 h and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the 
supernatants, then the supernatants were purified by solid-phase extraction with 
a C(18) cartridge. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a 
reversed-phase C(18) column with a gradient elution program whereas 
acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid water was used as mobile phase. Mass spectra were 
acquired in negative ionization mode and a data-dependant scan was used for the 
identification of the key metabolites of tectorigenin in the urine samples. As a 
result, four phase II metabolites and the parent drug tectorigenin were found 
and identified in rat urine for the first time.

BACKGROUND: Cerasus humilis is an edible medicinal plant, rich in minerals, 
organic acids, proteins, and carbohydrates, with particularly high organic acid 
content. Its fruit contains high levels of antioxidants such as vitamins, amino 
acids, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, and anthocyanins, which provide strong 
free-radical scavenging activity and support its use in antioxidant-rich foods 
and for nutritional health. This study examined changes in organic acids, 
antioxidant compounds, antioxidant enzyme activity, and antioxidant capacity 
during fruit development.
RESULTS: During development and maturation, the composition of organic acids and 
antioxidant-related indices in C. humilis fruit changed. Malic acid reached 
15.61 g kg-1 FW at full ripeness, accounting for 95.01% of total organic acids. 
Correlation analysis indicated that organic acids, antioxidant compounds, and 
antioxidant enzymes were closely linked, collectively determining antioxidant 
capacity. Different acids had distinct effects: malic acid influenced the •O2- 
scavenging rate, whereas citric and oxalic acids increased both the antioxidant 
compounds and enzymes that contribute to primary antioxidant capacity.
CONCLUSION: The antioxidant capacity of C. humilis fruit is highest during early 
development and decreases in later stages, providing a theoretical basis for the 
development of antioxidant-rich products and determining optimal harvest time. ©

Phenolic acids (PAs) have been shown to be beneficial to human health and are 
found most abundantly in corn bran ( approximately 4%, w/w), one of the main 
dietary fibers. This study therefore evaluated the bioavailabilities of phenolic 
antioxidants ferulic acid (FA) and p-coumaric acid (PCA) in refined corn bran 
(RCB) by determining their recovery in the plasma, urine, and feces of rats fed 
a single meal of a RCB diet containing 5% RCB or adapted to the RCB diet for 10 
days. In both studies, 0.4-0.5% of ingested FA and 1.2-2.3% of ingested PCA were 
recovered in rat urine. By contrast, approximately 81% of FA and approximately 
64% of PCA ingested with the single meal were excreted through the rat feces 
within 3 days after the ingestion. On the other hand, after rats were fed the 
RCB diet, total FA (all forms of FA) was recovered in plasma at a concentration 
of 35.0 +/- 2.0 microg/L, total FA and total PCA were excreted through urine at 
levels of 155.4 +/- 5.8 and 50.9 +/- 6.6 microg/day, respectively. These 
parameters showed no significant change (P = 0.93, 0.09, and 0.66, respectively) 
after rats were fed the RCB diet continuously for up to 10 days. These results 
suggest that the PAs in RCB are bioavailable in rats. Their bioavailabilities, 
however, are relatively low compared with their high content in RCB and not 
improved by the adaptation for 10 days to the enriched RCB diet. Additionally, 
comparison with the results of other studies revealed that high contents of FA 
and, especially, diferulic acids in cereal bran, which act as cross-links 
between bran cell wall polysaccharides, may not improve but, rather, limit the 
bioavailabilities of PAs in vivo.

Sesamin is one of the major precursors of mammalian lignans in sesame seed

Plant lignans occur in many foods, with flaxseed presently recognized as the 
richest source. Some plant lignans can be converted by intestinal microbiota to 
the mammalian lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, which may have protective 
effects against hormone-related diseases such as breast cancer. This study 
determined whether plant lignans in sesame seed, particularly sesamin, could be 
metabolized to the mammalian lignans. The total plant lignan concentration in 
sesame seed (2180 micromol/100 g) was higher than that in flaxseed (820 
micromol/100 g). In vitro fermentation with human fecal inoculum showed 
conversion of sesamin to the mammalian lignans, although at a lower rate (1.1%) 
compared with that of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (57.2%). However, when 
fed to female Sprague-Dawley rats for 10 d, sesamin (15 mg/kg body weight) and a 
10% sesame seed diet resulted in greater (P < 0.05) urinary mammalian lignan 
excretion (3.2 and 11.2 micromol/d, respectively), than the control (< 0.05 
micromol/d). We conclude that sesame seed is a rich source of mammalian lignan 
precursors and sesamin is one of them. From intermediate metabolites of sesamin 
identified in rat urine by GC-MS, a tentative metabolic pathway of sesamin to 
mammalian lignans is suggested.

Herbs and spices are a rich source of bioactive compounds that exhibit 
multidirectional health-promoting effects. Their bioactivity is mainly related 
to the presence of phenolic acids, flavonoids, carotenoids, essential oils, 
alkaloids, tannins, saponins and other plant bioactive compounds. The potential 
of herbs and spices in preventing oxidative stress, inflammation, bacterial 
infections and metabolic disorders is increasingly highlighted in the scientific 
literature, making them a valuable addition to functional foods. Confectionery 
products belong to a group of food products characterised by high consumer 
acceptance due to their attractive sensory qualities. Unfortunately, despite 
high popularity, traditional confectionery mainly provides empty calories in the 
form of simple sugars and saturated fats while lacking valuable nutrients such 
as vitamins, minerals or bioactive compounds. This review focuses on the 
composition and bioactive properties of selected herbs and spices, presenting 
current knowledge on their potential use in the production of functional 
confectionery products.

The antioxidant activity of phenolics in fruits of blueberry (Vaccinium 
corymbosum cv. Sierra), cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon cv. Ben Lear), wild 
chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa), and lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea cv. 
Amberland) was determined in this study. The phenolic constituents and contents 
among the different berries varied considerably. Anthocyanins were found to be 
the main components in all these berries. Chlorogenic acid in blueberry, 
quercetin glycosides in cranberry and lingonberry, and caffeic acid and its 
derivative in chokeberry were also present in relatively high concentrations. 
Chlorogenic acid, peonidin 3-galactoside, cyanidin 3-galactoside, and cyanidin 
3-galactoside were the most important antioxidants in blueberry, cranberry, wild 
chokeberry, and lingonberry, respectively. The contribution of individual 
phenolics to the total antioxidant capacity was generally dependent on their 
structure and content in the berries. Phenolics such as quercetin and cyanidin, 
with 3',4'-dihydroxy substituents in the B ring and conjugation between the A 
and B rings, had highly effective radical scavenging structures in blueberries, 
cranberries, chokeberries, and lingonberries. Phenolic acids such as caffeic 
acid also showed high antioxidant activity, probably due to its dihydroxylation 
in the 3,4 positions as hydrogen donors.

Stilbenes from grapes and wines play a central role in the human diet because of 
their antioxidant, antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic properties. We describe a 
method for the direct determination of some stilbenes (cis- and 
trans-resveratrol, cis- and trans-resveratrol glucoside, cis- and 
trans-piceatannol, and cis- and trans-piceatannol glucoside) in wine by 
high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry using a triple 
quadrupole (QqQ) mass spectrometer, in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, 
acquiring two diagnostic product ions from the chosen precursor. All the target 
analytes were separated on a C-18 column using gradient elution, in a single 
run. Electrospray ionization (ESI) in negative ion mode gives higher sensitivity 
for all the target compounds than atmospheric pressure chemical ionization 
(APCI). For the identification of piceatannol glucoside (astringin), because of 
the lack of a suitable standard, an HPLC/TOFMS method was used. The method 
permits direct injection of samples and it is time-saving, removing the need for 
sample pre-treatment. The detection limits were 48.0 ng mL(-1) for cis- and 
trans-resveratrol and for cis- and trans-resveratrol glucoside, and 50.0 ng 
mL(-1) for cis- and trans-piceatannol. The procedure proved to be simple and 
suitable for routine and confirmatory purposes. A total of 19 red and 3 white 
Italian wines were analyzed and differences in the stilbene composition were 
found among these samples.

The purpose of this study was to examine the antioxidant properties of water and 
80% methanolic extracts of cereal grains and their different morphological 
fractions. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. Almari and cv. Henika, barley 
(Hordeum vulgare L.) cv. Gregor and cv. Mobek, rye (Secale cereale L.) cv. 
Dańkowskie Zlote, oat (Avena sativa L.) cv. Slawko and buckwheat (Fagopyrum 
esculentum Moench) cv. Kora were used. PC (L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine) liposome 
system and spectrophotometric assay of total antioxidant activity (TAA) were 
used to evaluate the antioxidative activity of extracts. Among the water 
extracts, only the one prepared from buckwheat exhibited antioxidant activity at 
the concentration analyzed. The following hierarchy of antioxidant activity was 
provided for 80% methanolic extracts originated from whole grain: buckwheat > 
barley > oat > wheat congruent with rye. The antioxidant activity was observed 
in extract prepared from separated parts of buckwheat and barley. In respect to 
hulls, the antioxidant hierarchy was as follows: buckwheat > oat > barley. The 
correlation coefficient between total phenolic compounds and total antioxidative 
activity of the extracts was -0.35 for water extracts and 0.96, 0.99, 0.80, and 
0.99 for 80% methanolic extracts originated from whole grains, hulls, pericarb 
with testa fractions and endosperm with embryo fractions, respectively.

Objective. Adiponectin is an internally produced bioactive compound with a 
protective role against the insulin resistance-related diseases. Finding an 
adiponectin modifier can play a beneficial role in preventing the progression of 
the diseases, particularly in the prediabetic patients, as a high-risk 
population. This study was undertaken to examine the effect of dietary sorghum 
grain for a week on the plasma adiponectin levels in prediabetic patients. 
Methods. The study involved 26 (13+13) participants in both control and 
intervention groups. The control group maintained their habitual diet of white 
rice, while the intervention group replaced their habitual diet of white rice 
with sorghum grain for seven consecutive days. In all participants, the 
adiponectin concentration was measured before and after the intervention period. 
Results. Most study subjects had central obesity and dyslipidemia. Adiponectin 
levels after the intervention period decreased from the baseline in the control 
and sorghum groups including in all BMI groups. The change of decreasing 
adiponectin level was greater in the control than the sorghum group and in line 
with greater BMI in the sorghum group, but statistically insignificant. No 
significant difference in adiponectin concentrations was found among BMI groups. 
Conclusion. Sorghum grain consumption for a week is insufficient to increase 
adiponectin levels in the prediabetic patients. Insulin resistance, central 
obesity, and dyslipidemia may be the confounding variables that alter the 
favorable effect of sorghum on adiponectin. Longer sorghum consumption or other 
interventions may be needed to increase the adiponectin levels in people under 
these conditions.

The seeds of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench L.) were dehulled and then, 
following milling, extruded on a counter rotating, twin-screw extruder with the 
different barrel temperature profiles: 120, 160, and 200 degrees C. After 
extrusion cooking process, the following compounds were analyzed: free and 
conjugated phenolic acids, total polyphenols (TPC), tocopherols (T) and 
tocotrienols (T3), inositol phosphates (IP), reduced glutathione (GSH), and 
melatonin (MLT). The antioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase-like activity 
(SOD-like activity) were determined in the groats and extrudates. Extrusion 
caused a significant decrease in all the compounds tested, except for phenolic 
acids. The content of IP decreased by 13%, that of GSH by 42%, and that of T + 
T3 by 62%. A three-fold lower level of MLT and TPC was noted whereas the 
SOD-like activity disappeared when compared to the nonextruded material. A 
two-fold higher content of phenolic acids (free and released from ester bonds) 
was observed. In spite of the clear decrease in the investigated antioxidants, 
the extruded dehulled buckwheat seeds contained still significant content of 
bioactive compounds, which resulted in as little as an average 10% decrease of 
the antioxidant capacity.

A GC-MS method is reported for separation and characterization of widely 
different amounts of benzoic and phenolic acids as their trimethylsilyl 
derivatives simultaneously in cranberry. Fifteen benzoic and phenolic acids 
(benzoic, o-hydroxybenzoic, cinnamic, m-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxybenzoic, 
p-hydroxyphenyl acetic, phthalic, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic, vanillic, 
o-hydroxycinnamic, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic, p-coumaric, ferulic, caffeic, and 
sinapic acid) were identified in cranberry fruit in their free and bound forms 
on the basis of GC retention times and simultaneously recorded mass spectra. 
Except for benzoic, p-coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, and sinapic acids, 10 other 
phenolic acids identified have not been reported in cranberry before. The 
quantitation of the identified components was based on total ion current (TIC). 
The experimental results indicated cranberry fruit contains a high content of 
benzoic and phenolic acids (5.7 g/kg fresh weight) with benzoic acid being the 
most abundant (4.7 g/kg fresh weight). The next most abundant are p-coumaric 
(0.25 g/kg fresh weight) and sinapic (0.21 g/kg fresh weight) acid. Benzoic and 
phenolic acids occur mainly in bound forms and only about 10% occurs as free 
acid.
