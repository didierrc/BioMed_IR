Cancer development is a complex process, initiated by the combination of 
epigenetic and genetic changes in normal cells. Selective microenvironmental 
pressure within the primary tumors prompts the microevolution of invasive cell 
lineages that efficiently penetrate circulation and lymphatic systems and 
extravasate in distant organs, initiating the formation of metastases. 
Extravasation (diapedesis), i.e., the multistep penetration of the endothelial 
layer by circulating cancer cells, is regarded as the decisive step and one of 
the bottlenecks of the metastatic cascade. It limits malignant cancer 
dissemination, while initiating the formation of metastases. The efficiency of 
extravasation depends equally on the properties of circulating cancer cells and 
the local functional status of the endothelium, which remains sensitive to 
paracrine, adhesive, and juxtacrine stimuli generated by cancer and immune 
cells. Here, we review the current state of knowledge on the significance of 
endothelial activation for the diapedesis of circulating cancer cells, with the 
emphasis on the intercellular communication pathways that mediate this process. 
We also address the potential and limitations of endothelial activation as the 
target for novel strategies of cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: It remains unclear whether achieving the physical activity 
guidelines through occupational activity alone, nonoccupational activity alone, 
or combined occupational and nonoccupational activity has different health 
consequences.
METHODS: Adults aged 18 years or older in the NHANES (National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey) from 2007 to 2018 were prospectively observed. 
Mortality data were acquired from the National Death Index through December 31, 
2019. Time of self-reported occupational and nonoccupational activity was 
calculated. All-cause mortality was the primary outcome, with cardiovascular and 
cancer mortality as secondary outcomes. Cox proportional hazards models were 
used to analyze the association of occupational and nonoccupational activity 
with mortality.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 6.92 years, 23 752 participants were 
included in our analysis, with 1367 deaths recorded, including 367 
cardiovascular and 328 cancer deaths. Compared with inactive participants, those 
achieving recommended activity levels through occupational activity alone 
(hazard ratio [HR], 0.75 [95% CI, 0.60-0.94]), nonoccupational activity alone 
(HR, 0.58, [95% CI, 0.47-0.71]), or combined activity (HR, 0.43 [95% CI, 
0.33-0.56]) had lower all-cause mortality. Additionally, those achieving 
recommended activity levels through nonoccupational activity alone (HR, 0.51 
[95% CI, 0.36-0.71]) or combined activity (HR, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.20-0.57]) had 
lower cardiovascular mortality. However, occupational activity alone (HR, 0.89 
[95% CI, 0.61-1.29]), nonoccupational activity alone (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 
0.66-1.46]), and combined activity (HR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.38-1.11]) were not 
associated with cancer mortality.
CONCLUSION: Achieving recommended activity levels through any domain was 
associated with lower all-cause mortality. Nonoccupational activity alone or 
combined activity was associated with lower cardiovascular mortality. 
Participants in occupational activity alone may benefit more if they also 
achieve recommended activity levels through nonoccupational activity.

The WNT signaling pathway, a fundamental molecular network regulating cell 
proliferation, differentiation, and stemness, plays a critical role in 
tumorigenesis, cancer progression, and therapeutic resistance. Given its crucial 
regulatory roles in tumors, WNT signaling pathway has been identified as 
effective targets for cancer treatment. However, the current clinical efficacy 
of WNT signaling pathway-targeted anti-tumor therapies remains suboptimal. Based 
on research investigating the role of WNT signaling pathway in cancer, we 
systematically discuss the molecular mechanisms of WNT signaling in cancer 
(including both canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways), the role of WNT 
signaling in different cancer types, highlighting distinct potential therapeutic 
approaches targeting WNT signaling. We also comprehensively review innovative 
strategies targeting WNT signaling, including Porcupine (PORCN) inhibitors, 
Tankyrase (TNKS) inhibitor, Frizzled (FZD)-targeted monoclonal antibodies, 
β-catenin/TCF transcriptional complex inhibitors, and natural bioactive 
compounds and drug repositioning etc., critically evaluating their preclinical 
efficacy and limitations. We emphasize the need for and challenges in developing 
WNT-targeted therapies including refining the specificity of WNT signaling 
pathway-targeted therapies, developing biomarkers for patient selection, and 
exploring synergies between WNT inhibitors and other therapeutic modalities such 
as immune checkpoint blockers. These advances aim to enable personalized 
precision therapy and revolutionize cancer treatment paradigms in the future.

PURPOSE: The provision of specialized palliative care (SPC) and the timely 
discontinuation of cancer-targeted treatments (CTT) are increasingly considered 
important in cancer care at the end of life (EoL). EoL cancer care decisions are 
often initiated in the hospital, and little is known about associated 
expenditure in other parts of the health system. Our primary objective was to 
examine the total healthcare and care setting-specific expenditure associated 
with either exposure to SPC or timely discontinuation of CTT for patients with 
cancer in the last 4 weeks of life. Our secondary objectives were to (1) examine 
how these expenditures evolved in the last 4 weeks of life and across care 
settings and (2) explore the relation between the associated expenditures of SPC 
and timely discontinuation of CTT. Exposure to SPC was defined by the first 
successful referral to SPC within the 6- to 1-month period (i.e., last 4 weeks) 
before death. Timely discontinuation of CTT was defined as receiving no CTT 
within the last 4 weeks of life.
METHODS: Using comprehensive linked Danish registry data, we conducted a 
nationwide matched cohort study (2011-2018), which analyzed care expenditure in 
various settings during the last 4 weeks of life for cancer patients, estimating 
costs with generalized linear model (GLM) and generalized estimating equation 
(GEE) models, and using logistic regression to assess SPC and timely 
discontinuation of CTT.
RESULTS: The total EoL care expenditure in the last 4 weeks of life was €3140 
(96% CI €-3433 to €-2848) lower for patients exposed to SPC compared with 
non-exposed, mainly due to reduced hospital expenditure. Individuals exposed to 
timely discontinuation of CTT had €3430 (95% CI €-3649 to €-3211) lower 
expenditure per patient despite higher community, home-based, hospice, and 
primary care expenditure.
CONCLUSION: Our findings show the development of EoL care expenditure during 
cancer patients' final 4 weeks of life and can inform policymakers about the 
potential implications across the health system of changes in EoL care patterns.

BACKGROUND: Making an optimal surgical procedure decision (lobar or sublobar 
resections) remains challenging for some early-stage non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of developing a 
personalized model exclusively for surgical decision-making in early-stage 
NSCLC.
METHODS: Propensity score matching was performed to diminish the influence of 
the surgeon's surgical procedure decision. Clinical and radiomic covariates were 
modified by the surgical procedure to reflect the interaction between the 
surgical procedure and covariates. The least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator, Cox regression, was used for model development. Patients were divided 
into positive-score and negative-score groups based on a predicted score 
threshold of 0.
RESULTS: After matching, 369 patients with clinical stage IA pure-solid NSCLC 
were included. Of the 248 modified covariates, 14 were selected, including four 
clinical and ten radiomic covariates. The surgical decision-making model 
generated a score for each patient (mean -0.43; standard deviation 0.97). In the 
positive-score group, sublobar resection was associated with significantly worse 
recurrence-free survival (RFS) than lobar resection (hazard ratio [HR], 4.15; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47, 11.7; P = 0.004). In contrast, sublobar 
resection was superior to lobar resection in terms of RFS (HR, 0.4; 95% CI, 
0.22, 0.73; P = 0.002) for the negative-score group patients. For overall 
survival, lobar resection was favored in the positive-score group (P < 0.001), 
while sublobar resection was favored in the negative-score group (P < 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The personalized surgical decision-making model potentially helps 
to decide the optimal surgical procedure for early-stage NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Despite limited research, cancer patients are opting for compounds 
found in cannabis, like tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), to 
improve their sleep. The purpose of this study was to examine the therapeutic 
value of cannabis for sleep.
METHODS: Patient-reported symptom responses were obtained from 1962 cancer 
patients enrolled in the Minnesota Medical Cannabis Program (MMCP) from 2015 to 
2023. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used to evaluate 
the associations between changes in reported sleep disturbance scores and the 
dose of THC, the dose of CBD, and the cannabinoid ratio (THC:CBD). Logistic and 
linear regression models were adjusted for sex, age, race, ethnicity, body mass 
index, and MMCP enrollment fee category. Linear regression models were 
additionally adjusted for baseline sleep disturbance score.
RESULTS: Compared to the highest quintile category of CBD dose, lower dose 
quintiles were 29-35% less likely to be associated with at least a 30% 
improvement in sleep disturbance scores. Sleep disturbance scores improved by 
1.87 points on a 0-10 ordinal scale for cancer patients with CBD doses in the 
top quintile, and approximately 1.5 points for doses in lower quintiles. THC and 
THC:CBD doses were not consistently related to changes in sleep disturbance 
scores.
CONCLUSION: Higher CBD doses may be associated with clinically meaningful 
improvements in sleep in cancer patients enrolled in a medical cannabis program.

Numerous cellular pathways are known to cause resistance in cancer cells. The 
unfolded protein response (UPR), a signaling pathway activated during 
proteostasis stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is an adaptive process to 
increase cancer cell fitness. However, the molecular mechanism between ER 
stress, UPR activation, and chemoresistance is insufficiently understood. Here, 
we report that ER stress induction and UPR activation are necessary for 
chemoresistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin. Mild ER stress is a sufficient 
precondition for cancer cells to evade cisplatin- and doxorubicin-associated 
cell death. Mechanistically, ER stress induction results in the redistribution 
of PDIA4 from the ER to the cytosol, facilitated by the c-tail-anchored proteins 
DNAJB12 and DNAJB14 and the cytosolic HSC70-cochaperone SGTA. In the cytosol, 
PDIA4 forms an inhibitory interaction with caspase-3 and wt-p53, leading to 
their attenuation and increased cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, we show 
that PDIA4 must originate from the ER to inhibit caspase-3 and wt-p53 in the 
cytosol. Silencing PDIA4, DNAJB12/14, or SGTA rescues wt-p53 and caspase-3 
activity. Finally, we found that in tumors isolated from colorectal cancer 
patients, PDIA4 and DNAJB12 are highly expressed compared to their healthy 
tissues; this expression is associated with the induction of the UPR. Our data 
show a novel non-genetic mechanism to inhibit apoptosis and suggest PDIA4, 
DNAJB12/14, and SGTA as novel therapeutic targets to rescue apoptosis and 
inhibit proliferation in cancer cells.

PARP inhibitors have been approved for treating a subset of breast cancer 
patients harboring BRCA1/2 mutations. However, TNBC patients with wildtype 
BRCA1/2 have limited targeted therapeutic options. Dysregulation of protein 
arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) has been implicated in the progression of 
various cancers, including breast cancer. This study investigates the effects of 
two classes of PRMT5 inhibitors, GSK3326595 and TNG908, on breast cancer cell 
lines with different BRCA1/2 statuses to evaluate their therapeutic potential 
and synergy with PARP inhibitors. A panel of seven breast cancer cell lines was 
treated with PRMT5 and PARP inhibitors, followed by cell viability measurements 
using an MTT assay. Drug interactions were analyzed using the Loewe method on 
the Combenefit Software. Additionally, RT-qPCR was conducted to measure the 
expression of known DNA damage response genes. Synergy was observed in all cell 
lines, with BRCA1/2 wildtype cell lines displaying higher synergy scores than 
BRCA1/2 mutant lines, while the synergy was independent of MTAP status. 
Mechanistically, PRMT5 inhibition did not alter the early gene expression of 
known DNA damage response genes as measured by RT-qPCR. Notably, short-term 
PRMT5 inhibition was sufficient to sensitize an isogenic pair of ovarian cancer 
cells to subsequent PARP inhibition. These findings highlight the potential of 
combining PRMT5 inhibitors with PARP inhibitors in a wide range of cancers 
beyond BRCA1/2 and MTAP mutants. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate 
the underlying mechanisms of sensitization and the timing of cellular responses 
to PRMT5 inhibition.

BACKGROUND: KRAS and NRAS mutations (mt) are drivers in metastatic colorectal 
cancer (mCRC). We studied frequencies, characteristics, treatments, and outcomes 
of different KRASmt and NRASmt in population-based and real-world settings.
METHODS: Three Nordic cohorts were combined and molecularly characterised for 
KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF-V600E hotspot mutations.
RESULTS: Of 2649 mCRC patients, 2118 were molecularly classified. KRASmt were 
seen in 49%, NRASmt in 4%, RAS&BRAFwt in 33%, and BRAF-V600Emt in 14%. No 
differences in clinical characteristics were observed between KRASmt and NRASmt. 
Median overall survival (OS) was longest among RAS&BRAFwt, intermediate among 
KRASmt and NRASmt, and shortest among BRAF-V600Emt (28.3 vs 21.4 vs 26.3 vs 9.2 
months, respectively). Among the eight most common KRASmt, the only clinical 
difference was that KRAS-G12S had more distant lymph node metastases (38% vs 
18-27%, p = 0.041). KRAS-G12S had shorter OS than KRAS-G12V, KRAS-G12C, 
KRAS-G12A, and KRAS-G13D. The differences were smaller in treatment groups but 
withstood in multivariable models. The three most common NRASmt did not differ 
clinically.
CONCLUSION: KRASmt and NRASmt are seen in 49% and 4% of mCRC, respectively. No 
clinically relevant differences were observed between different RASmt. KRASmt is 
a common subgroup for which the outcome hopefully can be improved with newly 
developed drugs.

Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is crucial for redox balance and 
biosynthesis via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), driving non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) proliferation. This study assessed the cytotoxic and 
enzymatic effects of five 1,2-naphthoquinone (NQ) derivatives, including SJ006 
derived from Usnea barbata, in NSCLC cell lines (A549 and NCI-H292) compared to 
traditional inhibitors (DHEA and 6AN). All 1,2-NQs demonstrated 
concentration-dependent cytotoxicity against NSCLC cells. Among them, NN02 
exhibited the highest cytotoxicity comparable to 6-AN, followed by NN01, NN04, 
SJ006, and SJ007, which showed moderate effects comparable to DHEA. SJ006 
uniquely inhibited G6PD activity without altering its mRNA or protein 
expression. Unlike DHEA and 6AN, SJ006 functioned as an uncompetitive inhibitor, 
decreasing both Km and Vmax, with molecular docking confirming strong G6PD 
binding. Additionally, SJ006 increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, 
induced G2/M cell cycle arrest, and triggered late apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Its 
effects were reversed by D-(-)-ribose, confirming PPP disruption as the 
mechanism. These results highlight SJ006 as a novel G6PD inhibitor that disrupts 
redox homeostasis and biosynthesis-driven cell proliferation, showing promise as 
an anticancer agent for NSCLC.

This study investigated the role of ubiquitin specific peptidase 42 (USP42) in 
breast cancer proliferation, focusing on its modulation of apoptosis via the 
JNK/p38 signaling pathway. USP42 expression levels in breast cancer cell lines 
were assessed using western blotting and RT-qPCR. In vitro, cell proliferation 
was evaluated using CCK-8 assay and clonogenic assay assessed, while apoptosis 
was measured by flow cytometry evaluated. Western blotting was used to analyze 
the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and those associated with the 
JNK/p38 pathway. The effect of USP42 knockdown on breast cancer cell 
proliferation was examined in vivo using a xenograft nude mice model. USP42 
protein levels were significantly higher in breast cancer tissues than in normal 
breast tissues. Moreover, USP42 expression was positively correlated with the 
advanced T stage, N stage, and pathological stage. USP42 knockdown in MCF7 and 
MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis 
rates. USP42 silencing upregulated caspase-3 and Bax expression, while 
downregulating Bcl-2. Phosphorylation of JNK and p38 increased significantly 
following USP42 silencing. Treatment with SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) or SB203580 
(p38 MAPK inhibitor) effectively recused JNK and p38 activation. Both inhibitors 
also reduced the apoptotic cell population, which was upregulated by USP42 
silencing. These findings highlight USP42 promotes breast cancer progression by 
reducing JNK and p38 activation and inhibiting apoptosis, suggesting its 
potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the interaction between PD1 
and PDL1 are effective for immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
However, only subgroups of patients respond to therapy, suggesting the existence 
of resistance mechanisms.
METHODS: In this study, we analyzed post-surgery lung tissues and peripheral 
blood cells from patients with Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and control 
subjects by using western blot, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, multiplex cytokine, 
and qPCR analysis.
RESULTS: Here, we found progressively increased Blimp1 expression in the tumoral 
region of NSCLC patients, where Slamf1 significantly decreased, and it inversely 
correlated with Blimp1. In PBMCs, Blimp1 was expressed in CD8+ T cells but 
predominantly in immunosuppressive Foxp3+ Treg cells or after targeting of the T 
cell activator Slamf1. Anti-CD3/CD28 induced IL-6 and IL-10, an 
immunosuppressive gene induced by Blimp1, in the supernatants of PBMCs from 
patients with NSCLC. Targeting PD1 in PBMCs reduced Blimp1.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, we identify a key role of the transcription factor Blimp1 for 
immune evasion in NSCLC. Thus, targeting Blimp1 emerges as a novel concept to 
improve current lung cancer immunotherapies and to suppress immune evasion in 
lung cancer.

BCSC-1 (breast cancer suppressor candidate-1), the official gene symbol VWA5A 
(von Willebrand factor A domain containing 5 A), is downregulated in a variety 
of cancer types including breast cancer. The role of BCSC-1 in tumorigenesis and 
the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. One of the ways to predict a 
spectrum of functions of an unknown protein is to identify the protein-protein 
interaction network involving it. Flag-pLV-Neo-BCSC1 or the empty vector were 
stably transfected into breast cancer cells MCF-7. The levels of BCSC1 
expression were identified by Western blotting. Co-immunoprecipitation assay 
coupled with liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (Co-IP-MS) and 
bioinformatic analysis were done to study protein-protein interactions. A subset 
of interacting proteins was validated by immunofluorescence (IF). IF was also 
conducted to determine the cell migration of BCSC-1. The pEGFP-C3 plasmids with 
full-length and truncated BCSC-1 were transiently transfected into breast cancer 
cells to identify domains of BCSC-1 guiding the subcellular location. 341 
interacting partners of BCSC-1 were significantly enriched in Flag-BCSC-1 
against negative control. These interactors included the lysosome and the 
proteasome related to proteostatic pathways, the peroxisome involved in lipid 
metabolism, endocytosis components in the vesicle transport pathway, and the 
regulation of actin cytoskeleton. STAT1, STAT3, and CDC42, identified among the 
interacting partners, co-localized with BCSC-1. In addition, BCSC-1 distributed 
to the leading edge of migrating breast cancer cells. VIT (vault protein 
inter-α-trypsin) domain of BCSC-1 is required in the regulation of cell 
migration. BCSC-1 might exert diverse functions through protein-protein 
interactions.

The current analysis aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of benmelstobart 
plus anlotinib and chemotherapy for patients with ES-SCLC from the Chinese 
health-care system perspective. A mathematical decision model that simulated 
patients' 3-week transition in 20-year time horizon was conducted to evaluate 
the economic value. Survival and safety data were gathered from ETER701 trial, 
cost and utility values were obtained from the local charges and previously 
published studies. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed to examine 
the robustness of the model results and to support the health-decision making. 
For intention-to-treat (ITT) patients, benmelstobart plus anlotinib and 
carboplatin/etoposide could bring additional 0.60 and 0.71 QALYs with marginal 
cost of $91,424.86 and $98,504.86 compared with anlotinib plus 
carboplatin/etoposide and carboplatin plus etoposide, respectively, resulting in 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were $153,444.29/QALY and 
$138,272.39/QALY, respectively, which were higher than the Chinese 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses 
confirmed the robustness of the model results when parameters changed. 
Benmelstobart plus anlotinib and carboplatin/etoposide was unlikely to be the 
cost-effective first-line strategy compared with anlotinib plus 
carboplatin/etoposide and carboplatin plus etoposide for ES-SCLC patients in 
China. Reducing the price of benmelstobart could increase its 
cost-effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: Work-related determinants of return to work (RTW) after breast 
cancer (BC) have been poorly studied.
METHODS: We analysed data from 2095 patients with primary BC enrolled in the 
French multi-center prospective cohort CANTO between 2012 and 2018. We 
investigated the association between administrative, physical and psychosocial 
working conditions and RTW two years after diagnosis using Poisson regression 
with robust variance. All models were adjusted for age, education, having a 
partner or children, and clinical variables at diagnosis. Analyses stratified by 
education (up to/higher than high school) and by chemotherapy were conducted. 
Multiple imputations were performed.
RESULTS: Having no weekly rest period of 48 consecutive hours (RR = 1.36 95% 
CI:1.09-1.81), strenuous work postures (RR = 1.48 95% CI:1.19-1.87) and shift 
work (RR = 1.40 95% CI:1.11-1.75) as well as low independence of decision making 
(RR = 1.33 95% CI:1.04-1.81) were associated with increased non-RTW. Not 
perceiving her own job as boring (RR = 0.61 95% CI:0.39-0.86) was associated 
with decreased non-RTW. Administrative working conditions did not impact RTW.
CONCLUSION: Working conditions emerged as potential levers to help women RTW. 
Our results underline the need for more targeted rehabilitation programs and 
personalized interventions to effectively help women in their RTW journey after 
BC.

Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women worldwide, causing 
nearly half of all diagnosed cases to result in death. Most of the cases, women 
are dying due to ignorance and lack of adequate knowledge, which is completely 
unacceptable. This study aimed to assess the effects of health educational 
intervention on knowledge and perception of cervical cancer and its screening 
among women in Tangail District of Bangladesh. This was a quasi-experimental 
(pre-post) study conducted in Tangail District, Bangladesh. Baseline data were 
collected using a pre-validated questionnaire from 400 rural women, followed by 
a health education intervention. After one month, a post-intervention survey 
using the same questionnaire was conducted to assess changes in knowledge and 
perception. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square test, 
McNemar's test, and Friedman test to evaluate pre-post differences and 
associations with socio-demographic variables. All statistical tests had been 
conducted using Microsoft Excel (Version 2024) and SPSS (version 27). Out of 400 
participants, the majority (44.8%) was aged between 25 and 34 years and most 
(96.8%) of the women were housewives. A significant improvement was observed in 
knowledge about cervical cancer and its screening after the health education 
intervention. Before the intervention, 69.5% of the participants were aware of 
cervical cancer but after the intervention it increased to 100% (p < 0.001). 
Additionally, the awareness about cervical cancer screening rises from 20.3% to 
100% (p < 0.001). Moreover, before the intervention, only 14.8% of participants 
were aware of the HPV vaccine, while this figure increased to 98.3% (p < 0.001). 
Furthermore, after the intervention the percentage of participants receiving 
cervical cancer screenings increased from 4.3% to 9.8% (p = 0.004). The study 
observed that health education intervention programs significantly increased 
women knowledge and perception regarding cervical cancer and its screening. 
Cervical cancer mortality rate can be highly reduced if it can be detected early 
and take proper measures.

PURPOSE: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression may decrease 
during the progression of prostate cancer (PCa), compromising the efficacy of 
PSMA-targeted imaging. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a key component of 
the tumor microenvironment, offers a complementary target. This study aimed to 
develop and evaluate PSMA/FAP bispecific tracers with a biphenyl scaffold for 
improved PET detection outcomes of PCa.
METHODS: The binding affinities of precursors and their corresponding 
non-radioactive standards were assessed using recombinant PSMA and FAP proteins. 
PET/CT imaging was performed in 22Rv1 (PSMA-positive) and U87MG (FAP-positive) 
xenograft models. Clinical evaluation of [18F]AlF-NOTA-PSFA-1 was conducted in 
two PCa patients, directly compared with [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11.
RESULTS: All precursors and their corresponding non-radioactive standards 
exhibited high affinity for both PSMA (Ki = 0.13-4.86 nM) and FAP (Ki = 
0.012-0.40 nM). Among them, [18F]AlF-NOTA-PSFA-1, demonstrated the highest tumor 
uptake in both 22RV1 (SUVmax = 4.64) and U87MG (SUVmax = 7.23) models, along 
with favorable tumor retention over time. Compared to [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11, 
[18F]AlF-NOTA-PSFA-1 showed higher lesion uptake, reduced background 
accumulation in off-target organs, and improved imaging quality in metastatic 
PCa patient.
CONCLUSIONS: The biphenyl-based bispecific tracers developed in this study 
achieved high tumor affinity, prolonged retention, and notably reduced renal 
uptake in mouse models. [18F]AlF-NOTA-PSFA-1 emerged as the most promising 
candidate, demonstrating superior imaging performance over [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 in 
both preclinical and first-in-human evaluation.

Plant-associated fungal endophytes hold great potential to synthesize 
metabolites similar to their host, with potential anticancer effects. The 
present study aims to identify lead compound in the ethyl acetate (EA) extract 
of fungal endophyte, Penicillium oxalicum, associated with a medicinal plant 
Amoora rohituka, responsible for the anti-breast cancer activity. The crude 
extract of P. oxalicum was subjected to High-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) analysis and further, bioactivity-guided fractionation was performed for 
HPLC fractions based on cell viability assay. The potential fraction further 
showed dose-dependent generation of nitric oxide in breast cancer cells that 
indicates their activity in the induction of oxidative stress. The 
characterization of potential fraction was done using different analytical 
techniques, such as liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time of flight 
mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS), high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), 
Fourier transform-infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and both 1H and 13C nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy that validates the mass, structure, and 
functional groups of the lead compound, identified as Phytosphingosine. Further, 
DAPI assay revealed Phytosphingosine induced alteration of nuclear morphology in 
breast cancer cells, indicating apoptotic events. The blood compatibility of 
Phytosphingosine was evidenced through hemolysis assay, thus suggesting its 
safety profile. This is the first report of the purification and 
characterization of Phytosphingosine from P. oxalicum, exhibiting anti-breast 
cancer activity. The cytotoxic potential of Phytosphingosine against MDA-MB-231 
and MCF-7 cells suggests further exploration to elucidate its molecular 
cross-talks and signalling pathways to develop targeted therapy against BC.

PACT (encoded by the PRKRA gene) is a double-stranded RNA binding protein with 
defined antiviral defense and cytoplasmic RNA-induced silencing actions in 
mammals. We previously described a further role for PACT as a modulator of 
nuclear receptor (NR)-regulated gene expression. Here, we investigated the role 
of PACT in prostate cancer (PCa) using a loss-of-function approach. Depletion of 
PACT in multiple PCa cell lines resulted in a reduction in cell proliferation, 
but viability was maintained. RNA-sequencing analysis of LNCaP PCa cells ± PACT 
revealed a depletion of biological processes involved in cell cycle, 
mitochondrial function, and NR-response pathways in the PACT knockout (KO) 
cells. In the PACT KO cells, downregulated genes included the androgen-regulated 
KLK3 (prostate specific antigen, PSA), together with H2AFJ, PSMD5, AQP3, 
TMEM45B, and SLC22A3, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of these genes reduced cell 
growth and proliferation in LNCaP cells. Further, reducing PACT or PSA induced 
cell cycle arrest at G0/G1. Additionally, the hormone-mediated upregulation and 
AR antagonist-driven downregulation of PSA gene expression were respectively 
attenuated and enhanced in PACT KO cells. Taken together, these data support a 
pro-proliferative role for PACT in PCa, and siRNA therapeutic targeting of PACT, 
or downregulated genes with PACT KO, could represent a new therapeutic approach.

BACKGROUND: Current treatment for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast 
is generic, due to lack of risk stratification tools. We investigate the 
correlation between expression of collagen IV in the breast and risk of dying of 
breast cancer. We also explore the effect of collagen IV in vitro.
METHODS: Tissue microarrays from a cohort of women treated for DCIS who later 
died from breast cancer (n = 43) or were still alive (n = 119), were analysed 
for collagen IV by immunohistochemistry. Oestrogen receptor positive (ER+), 
triple negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplified (HER2+) 
cell lines were cultured with and without collagen IV.
RESULTS: High expression of stromal collagen IV correlated with increased odds 
of dying of breast cancer (OR 2.50; 95% CI 1.16-5.39). This association remained 
when adjusting for tumour size, margin status, comedo necrosis and progesterone 
receptor negativity (PR-) (OR 4.27; 95% CI 1.64-11.1). Triple negative breast 
cancer cell lines migrated quicker on collagen IV-coated than on uncoated 
surfaces. By contrast, collagen IV coating did not affect ER+ and HER2+ cell 
lines.
CONCLUSIONS: Abundance of stromal collagen IV increases risk of dying in breast 
cancer after DCIS, and collagen IV can promote cell motility in vitro.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. However, individuals with a 
lower socioeconomic status (SES) tend to experience poorer prognosis. We aimed 
to study disparities in diagnosis, treatment, quality of care, and survival by 
SES in Iran. Data from breast cancer patients at the Cancer Institute of Iran 
between 2014 and 2016, registered in the clinical breast cancer registry of Iran 
(CBCR-IR), were used. Clinical data were obtained from CBCR-IR, while follow-up 
data and information on SES, including 10 household assets and education level, 
were gathered through telephone interviews. The primary outcome was survival, 
determined through active follow-up. Additionally, we studied delays in 
treatment and the quality of care based on European Society of Breast Cancer 
Specialists (EUSOMA) standards. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to 
investigate the association between SES and survival in women with breast 
cancer. The inequality in breast cancer survival was analyzed using the 
Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition model. The 5-year overall survival rates were 87.7% 
(95% CI: 83.9-90.7) for low SES patients, 90.2% (95% CI: 86.7-92.8) for mid SES, 
and 92.1% (95% CI: 89.0-94.3) for high SES patients (log-rank test 
P-value = 0.077). A 3.3% gap in breast cancer mortality was observed between 
high and low SES patients (95% CI: 1.3-5.5), with the model explaining 2.2% of 
this difference. Differences in delay in treatment and stage at diagnosis 
accounted for 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2-0.7) and 1.8% (95% CI: 1.2-2.3) of the 
disparity. Breast cancer mortality is higher in low SES patients, primarily due 
to late diagnosis and delays in treatment initiation.

Survival analysis plays a critical role in predicting patient outcomes and 
guiding personalized cancer therapies. Although multi-omics data provide rich 
biological insights, their high dimensionality poses significant challenges for 
robust analysis and clinical implementation. While many studies rely on the 
traditional Cox proportional hazards model, few have explored alternative 
survival algorithms combined with rigorous feature selection to identify 
low-dimensional, clinically feasible prognostic signatures that retain strong 
predictive power comparable to models using the full feature set. To address 
these gaps, we developed PRISM (PRognostic marker Identification and Survival 
Modelling through Multi-omics Integration), a comprehensive framework aimed at 
improving survival prediction and discovering minimal yet robust biomarker 
panels across multiple omics modalities. PRISM systematically evaluates various 
feature selection methods and survival models through a robust pipeline that 
selects features within single-omics datasets before integrating them via 
feature-level fusion and multi-stage refinement. Applied to TCGA cohorts of 
Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA), Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and 
Endocervical Adenocarcinoma (CESC), Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma (OV), and 
Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC), PRISM revealed that cancer types 
benefit from unique combinations of omics modalities reflecting their molecular 
heterogeneity. Notably, miRNA expression consistently provided complementary 
prognostic information across all cancers, enhancing integrated model 
performance (C-index: BRCA 0.698, CESC 0.754, UCEC 0.754, OV 0.618). PRISM 
advances cancer prognosis by delivering scalable, interpretable multi-omics 
integration and identifying concise biomarker signatures with performance 
comparable to full-feature models, promoting clinical feasibility and precision 
oncology.

In this study, we introduce a machine learning optimized graphene-based 
biosensor tailored for the early and accurate detection of breast cancer, aiming 
to elevate diagnostic reliability and clinical efficacy. The device employs a 
multilayer Ag-SiO₂-Ag architecture to amplify optical response, achieving a peak 
sensitivity of 1785 nm/RIU. Machine learning models are used to optimize 
structural parameters, enabling systematic refinement of detection accuracy and 
reproducibility. The optimized design demonstrates superior sensitivity compared 
with conventional biosensor configurations, underscoring its effectiveness in 
bioanalytical applications. The proposed platform offers a precise and robust 
solution for breast cancer screening and monitoring, with strong potential for 
clinical translation. To further refine sensor efficacy, a comprehensive 
parametric optimization approach is employed, strategically enhancing its 
sensitivity metrics. The sensor's heightened precision and responsiveness 
position it as a promising tool in biomedical diagnostics, particularly for 
early-stage breast cancer screening and monitoring.

Targeting cancer cell plasticity through chromatin organization is an emerging 
research area, yet the molecular mechanisms that govern chromatin loop formation 
remain unclear. Here, we develop a CRISPR screen based on our engineered 
live-cell CTCF-cohesin contact reporters to identify regulators of chromatin 
loops. Our findings reveal that tousled-like kinase 2 (TLK2) functions as a key 
regulator of chromatin loop formation during the cancer stemness transition. 
Mechanistically, TLK2 phosphorylates DYNLL1, enhancing its interaction with CTCF 
to promote CTCF-cohesin hub formation at the KLF4 locus. Suppressing TLK2 
impairs cancer stemness plasticity, sensitizes cancer cells to cytotoxic stress 
in vitro, and reduces lung metastases and enhances immunotherapy response in 
breast cancer mouse models. Clinically, elevated TLK2 expression correlates with 
poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Collectively, these findings identify 
TLK2 as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating cancer stemness 
plasticity, highlighting chromatin loop-targeting therapy as a promising 
strategy to eradicate cancer stem cells.

Curcumin, a pharmacological agent found in turmeric's rhizome, has been studied 
for its various therapeutic properties. However, its clinical development is 
hindered by its instability and low solubility in water, resulting in inadequate 
oral bioavailability. Two potential curcumin analogs, 
2,5-bis(4'-hydroxy-3',5'-dimethoxybenylidene)cyclopentanone (PGV-5) and 
2,6-bis(4'-hydroxy-3',5'-dimethoxybenylidene)cyclohexanone (HGV-5), are being 
developed to address this issue and enhance their therapeutic efficacy. The 
study aims to screen novel curcumin analog compounds by integrating in silico 
assessment of ADME properties, acute toxicity studies, and computational 
analysis. PGV-5 and HGV-5 are classified as Global Harmonized System of 
Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) class 4 and class 5, 
respectively, in acute toxicity assessment, as they cause histopathological 
changes in the heart and lungs. Their ADME profile indicates they serve as 
effective P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, making them potential candidates for 
development as anti-multidrug resistance agents, particularly in cancer cells. 
Molecular docking on P-gp revealed significant inhibitory capability relative to 
curcumin, exhibiting comparable binding characteristics to the native ligand, as 
evidenced by superior docking scores. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations 
confirmed the stable interaction of both compounds with P-gp, with HGV-5 showing 
the most favorable binding free energy. Target gene mapping revealed several 
pivotal targets including AKT1, STAT3, EGFR, and NF-κB1. These findings suggest 
that PGV-5 and HGV-5 merit further research as agents against 
multidrug-resistant in cancer, regardless of their toxicity profiles. Further 
confirmation of their effects requires more laboratory studies and clinical 
trials.

The regulatory mechanisms governing transcriptional programs in the cancer 
genome remain elusive, particularly those concerning cell-type specificity. We 
carefully curated single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin 
sequencing (scATAC-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 
eight distinct carcinoma tissues, including breast, skin, colon, endometrium, 
lung, ovary, liver, and kidney. Using single-cell multi-omics analysis, we 
identified extensive open chromatin regions and constructed peak-gene link 
networks, which can reveal distinct cancer gene regulation and genetic risks. We 
further explored conserved epigenetic regulation across cell types within cancer 
and elucidated their functional implications. Moreover, we identified 
cell-type-associated transcription factors (TFs) that regulate key cellular 
functions, such as the TEAD family of TFs, which widely control cancer-related 
signaling pathways in tumor cells. In colon cancer, we further identified 
tumor-specific TFs that are more highly activated in tumor cells than in normal 
epithelial cells, including CEBPG, LEF1, SOX4, TCF7, and TEAD4, which are 
pivotal in driving malignant transcriptional programs and represent potential 
therapeutic targets, as corroborated by single-cell sequencing data from 
multiple sources and in vitro experiments. Our findings provide a comprehensive 
understanding of the regulatory dynamics underlying carcinomas and offer 
valuable insights into potential therapeutic interventions.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is the predominant pathological subtype of renal 
cell carcinoma, characterized by abnormal lipid metabolism. This study aimed to 
investigate the role of nuclear receptor co-activator 7 (NCOA7)-mediated 
autophagy in lipid metabolism in renal cancer and its effects on renal cancer 
progression. To this end, bioinformatic analysis was performed to analyze the 
prognostic significance of NCOA7 in renal cancer. Immunohistochemical staining 
and protein blotting were used to assess NCOA7 expression levels in clinical 
samples. Various assays, including scratch, Transwell, colony formation, and Oil 
Red O staining, were used to observe the effects of NCOA7 on the biological 
behavior and lipid metabolism of renal cancer cells. The interaction between 
NCOA7 and V-ATPase was investigated using immunoprecipitation. Additionally, 
NCOA7 expression was modulated in renal cancer cell lines transfected with LC3 
dual-fluorescent virus to study its effects on lysosomal function, autophagy, 
and lipid metabolism. The effects of NCOA7 expression levels on subcutaneous 
tumors were investigated using a nude mouse xenograft model. Bioinformatics 
analysis showed that NCOA7 was expressed at low levels in renal cancer tissues 
and independently associated with the prognosis in patients with renal cancer. 
In vitro experiments showed that high NCOA7 expression inhibited the 
proliferation, migration, and invasion of renal cancer cells. NCOA7 promoted the 
fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes through its interaction with V-ATPase. 
High expression of NCOA7 enhanced autophagy and lipid metabolism and inhibited 
the growth of renal cancer cells. In vivo experiments showed that high NCOA7 
expression inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. Our study 
demonstrates that NCOA7 promotes autophagy and reduces lipid accumulation by 
binding to V-ATPase and ultimately inhibits the progression of renal cancer. 
These findings suggest that NCOA7 might be a potential target for drug 
intervention in clear cell renal carcinoma. The schematic illustrates that NCOA7 
upregulation interacts with V-ATPase to promote autophagosome-lysosome fusion, 
enhance autophagic degradation of lipid droplets, and thereby suppress 
proliferation, migration, and invasion of kidney cancer cells. Image created

The deubiquitinating enzyme USP14, which belongs to the ubiquitin-specific 
protease family, is highly expressed in various malignant tumors. The regulatory 
mechanisms in tumors are complex and diverse, encompassing a range of cellular 
processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation, autophagy, and drug 
resistance. However, the functional role of USP14 in gastric cancer remains 
unclear. In the current investigation, a significant upregulation of USP14 
expression was observed in gastric cancer, and its overexpression was associated 
with an unfavorable prognosis among patients. The involvement of USP14 is 
indispensable for promoting the growth, motility, and infiltration of gastric 
cancer cells, as revealed by our findings. Further investigations revealed that 
USP14 interacts with KPNA2 and is responsible for deubiquitinating it by 
removing ubiquitin. Moreover, the deubiquitylation process mediated by USP14 was 
found to be critically dependent on the K48 residue of ubiquitin. The knockdown 
of USP14 significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of 
gastric cancer cells. This effect was attributed to the regulation of c-MYC 
nuclear translocation through KPNA2 deubiquitination. The findings underscore 
the imperative for further evaluation of the potential therapeutic significance 
of USP14 in gastric cancer.

Chimeric antigen receptor cells as a tool for localized delivery of TNFα in 
solid cancer treatment.

Medical Center, Rocheter, NY, USA.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells are effective in treating blood cancers 
but not solid cancers and can cause severe side effects, including cytokine 
release syndrome (CRS). One strategy to enhance the efficacy of CAR-T cells 
while avoiding CRS in cancer treatment is to deliver a single tumoricidal 
factor. TNFα is well known for triggering apoptosis signaling; however, it alone 
is not effective in treating cancers because it significantly increases the 
levels of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), a family of E3 ubiquitin 
ligases that block caspase-induced apoptosis. Thus, localized delivery of TNFα 
by targeting the tumors using the adoptive cells combined with an IAP 
antagonist, which degrades IAP proteins, could lead to improved outcomes in 
cancer treatment. This article reviews TNFα-induced apoptosis signaling pathway, 
outlines the principles for designing CAR-T cells, CAR-macrophages and 
CAR-dendritic cells expressing TNFα, used alone or in combination with IAP 
antagonists, and discusses the potential contraindications of IAP antagonists 
with several clinical used drugs for cancer treatment.

Methods for detecting microRNA (miRNA) are well-established, yet strategies for 
identifying miRNA-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (miR-SNPs) remain 
limited. Despite their strong association with cancer development, the clinical 
application of miR-SNPs has been hindered by the lack of practical detection 
methods. To bridge this gap, we developed a method termed ligation-triggered 
hybridization chain reaction for miR-SNP testing (LIGHT). LIGHT utilizes 
SplintR-triggered ligation for SNP discrimination in miR-196a2, combined with 
hybridization chain reaction for signal amplification. This approach enables 
precise allele discrimination with a detection limit of 0.75 aM, offering 
specificity by distinguishing mutations in miR-196a2 when they constitute only 
0.0002% of the wild-type population. LIGHT-based miR-SNP genotyping revealed 
significantly elevated miR-196a2T expression in non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) samples, highlighting the potential of LIGHT for NSCLC diagnostics. 
Furthermore, by leveraging the isothermal workflow of LIGHT, we developed a 
3D-printed visualizer for portable miR-SNP genotyping and demonstrated its 
potential to facilitate cancer diagnosis in resource-limited settings.

BACKGROUND: Late-stage breast cancer contributes to a growing number of deaths 
in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) but few studies examine scalable early detection 
strategies. Following small-scale pilots, in 2020 Rwanda launched an adapted 
Women's Cancer Early Detection Programme (WCEDP), integrating clinical breast 
exam (CBE) for symptomatic patients with cervical cancer screening. A 
WCEDP-specific electronic health record (EHR) was developed to facilitate 
patient tracking.
METHODS: We used the RE-AIM implementation science framework to retrospectively 
evaluate implementation of breast cancer early detection within the WCEDP over 
12 months in the first three scale-up districts (population: 2 009 888), using 
routinely-collected electronic and paper data from 15 health centres and 3 
hospitals. We examined the WCEDP's Reach in the target population, Effectiveness 
linking patients to care, Adoption by facilities and fidelity to the 
Implementation protocol.
RESULTS: Regarding Reach, average weekly health centre visits for CBE increased 
from 18 to 33 post-WCEDP launch; of 1688 women receiving CBE through the WCEDP, 
12.0% were ≥50 years. Regarding effectiveness, among 383 women referred to 
district or referral hospitals, 157 (40.9%) had no documented referral facility 
visit. Of those seen at a referral facility, median days from health centre to 
district hospital visit and from district to referral hospital visit were 6 (IQR 
1.8-14.8) and 8 (IQR 5.0-40.5) respectively. Among the 36 patients receiving 
biopsy, 72.2% were biopsied within 60 days of initial presentation. In terms of 
adoption, 79 clinicians were trained in cancer early detection, with 69.6% 
remaining at WCEDP facilities after 3 years. Regarding implementation fidelity, 
WCEDP clinics were held 52.6% of weeks. EHR data quality was inconsistent, with 
half of patients seen at district hospitals for breast care lacking EHR 
documentation.
INTERPRETATION: Breast cancer early detection services can be implemented in 
resource-constrained SSA health facilities. Integration with cervical cancer 
screening may be a promising strategy. However, investing in data systems is 
critical to support programme evaluation and high-quality care.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer poses a significant threat to public health, as 
demonstrated by its high incidence rate. While postoperative radiotherapy 
remains an important adjuvant treatment for patients with breast cancer 
undergoing breast-conserving surgery, radiation-induced dermatitis (RID) is a 
prevalent side effect, for which no standardised prevention method currently 
exists. Our previous preclinical research demonstrated that ursodeoxycholic acid 
(UDCA) significantly reduced radiation-induced skin damage in mice. Therefore, 
this phase I/II clinical study aims to further evaluate the safety and efficacy 
of UDCA in preventing RID during adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with breast 
cancer after breast-conserving surgery.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This single-centre phase I/II clinical study, with a 
single-arm cohort design in phase II, will include female patients who have 
undergone adjuvant radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery for breast 
cancer. The sample size for the study is 40. Eligible patients will receive 
adjuvant radiotherapy at a prescribed dose of 50 Gy/25 F to the entire breast 
and lymphatic drainage area, where indicated, and 66 Gy/33 F to the tumour bed. 
After each irradiation, a 250 mg dose of UDCA will be topically administered to 
the irradiated area. Radiological dermatitis and skin temperature were assessed 
once a week after the initiation of radiotherapy, and haematological toxicity, 
radiation lung injury and quality of life were monitored and analysed on a 
regular basis until the second week after the conclusion of radiotherapy. The 
primary objectives of phase I and II studies are the safety profile and 
incidence of grade II or higher RID in patients, respectively.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the ethics committee of 
Mianyang Central Hospital, China (No: S20230211-02) and is registered in the 
Chinese Clinical Trial Register (registration number: ChiCTR2400085925). Results 
will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

OBJECTIVES: To project the future burden of cancer mortality in India by 
forecasting age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) for 23 major cancer types 
up to the year 2030, providing crucial evidence for long-term health planning 
and resource allocation.
DESIGN: A retrospective analysis and time-series forecasting study. Participants 
Aggregated, national-level cancer mortality data for the population of India 
from 2000 to 2019 were used.
PARTICIPANTS: Aggregated, national-level cancer mortality data for the 
population of India from 2000 to 2019 were used.
METHODS: Annual ASMR data for 23 cancer types were obtained from the Global 
Cancer Observatory. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average was employed to 
forecast ASMR until 2030. For each cancer site, the model with the minimum 
Bayesian Information Criterion was chosen for males, females and both sexes 
combined.
RESULTS: The projections reveal diverging mortality patterns across different 
cancer types. For both genders, the ASMR for mouth oropharynx had the highest 
estimation of 13.75 (95% CI: 12.69 to 14.81) per 100000 population by 2030 from 
a baseline of 10.21 in 2000. Breast and cervical cancer showed estimations of 
6.62 and 6.03 in 2030, respectively. Conversely, mortality rate projections for 
several cancers declined, most notably cervical cancer and stomach cancer 
CONCLUSIONS: Our projections indicate a rise linked lifestyle and metabolic 
factors and a decline in infection-related and tobacco-related cancers. These 
underscore the need for strengthening preventive and screening programmes for 
the former, while continuing to invest in successful interventions for the 
latter.

BACKGROUND: Patients with colon cancer liver metastases (CCLM) frequently 
exhibit poor responses to immunotherapy, a phenomenon attributed in part to an 
immune desert tumor microenvironment. This study aimed to comprehensively 
characterize the immune landscape in primary colon cancers and their matched 
liver metastases via single-cell transcriptome analysis, with the goal of 
identifying potential immunotherapeutic targets.
METHODS: Tumor specimens from patients with CCLM were subjected to single-cell 
RNA sequencing. Immune subpopulations were profiled with emphasis on exhausted T 
cells (Tex)-including both CD8+ and CD4+ ANK3+ subsets-as well as on a distinct 
stress response T-cell subset (TSTR) defined by high HSPA1A/HSPA1B expression. 
In parallel, we performed assessments of the phenotype and prognostic impact of 
SPP1high myeloid cells, along with in vitro assays to examine their role in 
modulating T-cell number and function.
RESULTS: Liver metastatic lesions exhibited a significantly elevated 
infiltration of Tex compared with primary tumors. Notably, Tex cells exhibited 
upregulated expression of exhaustion-related marker genes such as ANK3, ZBTB20, 
ETV6, and CAMK4, which were markedly downregulated in TSTR cells. TSTR was 
identified as an intermediate developmental state between effector and exhausted 
T cells in patients with CCLM, suggesting that TSTR cells represent a distinct 
state from exhausted T cells. Furthermore, myeloid cells expressing high levels 
of secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), along with apolipoprotein C-I and 
apolipoprotein E, were associated with poor prognosis in patients with CCLM. In 
vitro studies revealed that Macro_SPP1high cells diminished T-cell populations 
and triggered a stress response state in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells via the 
SPP1/CD44/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in a CD44-dependent manner. Importantly, 
combination treatment with anti-SPP1 and anti-programmed cell death protein-1 
antibodies significantly inhibited liver metastasis growth, enhanced dendritic 
cell maturation, decreased M2-polarized macrophages, and restored T-cell 
infiltration and function.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a previously unrecognized relationship 
between Macro_SPP1high cells and HSPA1Ahigh/HSPA1Bhigh T cells in driving CCLM 
progression, suggesting a potential synergistic therapeutic approach that could 
boost immune checkpoint treatment efficacy in patients with CCLM.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators in cancer biology, 
yet their functional mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here, we identify 
circCHD6-216aa, a protein encoded by the circRNA circCHD6, as a key driver of 
colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis. CircCHD6-216aa forms nuclear condensates 
through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to function the pro-metastatic 
roles in CRC. Mechanistically, circCHD6-216aa promotes DExD/H-box helicase 9 
(DHX9) phosphorylation to enhance upstream circCHD6 biogenesis, establishing a 
positive feedback loop. Additionally, circCHD6-216aa binds to nucleolin (NCL), 
stabilizing NCL's phase-separated condensates and promoting the transcription of 
CD44, a critical mediator of metastasis. These findings provide novel insights 
into the mechanistic roles of cancer-associated circRNA and reveal that a 
previously uncharacterized protein promotes cancer progression through LLPS.

ABCG2, a key ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, contributes significantly 
to multidrug resistance (MDR) by actively effluxing a wide range of 
chemotherapeutic agents from cancer cells, thereby lowering intracellular drug 
concentrations and reducing therapeutic efficacy. This mechanism poses a major 
challenge in treating cancers such as non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
Despite extensive research, no clinically approved agents specifically target 
ABCG2-mediated MDR. Given the success of combining tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(TKIs) with chemotherapy, we explored whether BLU-945, a fourth-generation 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) TKI with potent activity against 
resistant EGFR mutations, could modulate ABCG2 function to reverse MDR. Our 
findings reveal that BLU-945 stimulates the ATPase activity of ABCG2, indicating 
direct interaction as a potential substrate or modulator. However, 
ABCG2-overexpressing NSCLC cells did not display resistance to BLU-945, 
suggesting that its antitumor activity remains intact despite high ABCG2 
expression. Importantly, BLU-945 significantly resensitized these resistant 
cells to multiple cytotoxic agents in a concentration-dependent manner, with 
effects evident even at nanomolar levels. Mechanistic studies indicate that this 
chemosensitizing effect results from functional inhibition of ABCG2-mediated 
drug efflux, without affecting ABCG2 protein expression, thereby enhancing 
intracellular drug retention and cytotoxicity. These findings reveal a 
previously unrecognized pharmacological property of BLU-945 as an inhibitor of 
ABCG2-mediated drug efflux, supporting its potential role in combination 
therapies aimed at overcoming MDR in patients with ABCG2-overexpressing tumors. 
Further preclinical and clinical studies are warranted to validate the 
translational relevance of this approach and to identify patient populations 
that may benefit most from this combinatorial strategy.

BACKGROUND: Most clinicians have limited experience with rare diseases, making 
diagnosis and treatment challenging. Large real-world data sources, such as 
electronic health records (EHRs), provide a massive amount of information that 
can potentially be leveraged to determine the patterns of diagnoses and 
treatments for rare tumors that can serve as clinical decision aids.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to discover signature disease trajectories of 3 rare cancer 
types: pancreatic cancer, STS of the trunk and extremity (STS-TE), and STS of 
the abdomen and retroperitoneum (STS-AR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leveraging IQVIA Oncology Electronic Medical Record, we 
identified significant diagnosis pairs across 3 years in patients with these 
cancers through matched cohort sampling, statistical computation, right-tailed 
binomial hypothesis test, and then visualized trajectories up to 3 progressions. 
We further conducted systematic validation for the discovered trajectories with 
the UTHealth Electronic Health Records (EHR).
RESULTS: Results included 266 significant diagnosis pairs for pancreatic cancer, 
130 for STS-TE, and 118 for STS-AR. We further found 44 2-hop (i.e., 
2-progression) and 136 3-hop trajectories before pancreatic cancer, 36 2-hop and 
37 3-hop trajectories before STS-TE, and 17 2-hop and 5 3-hop trajectories 
before STS-AR. Meanwhile, we found 54 2-hop and 129 3-hop trajectories following 
pancreatic cancer, 11 2-hop and 17 3-hop trajectories following STS-TE, 5 2-hop 
and 0 3-hop trajectories following STS-AR. For example, pain in joint and 
gastro-oesophageal reflux disease occurred before pancreatic cancer in 64 (0.5%) 
patients, pain in joint and ""pain in limb, hand, foot, fingers and toes"" 
occurred before STS-TE in 40 (0.9%) patients, agranulocytosis secondary to 
cancer chemotherapy and neoplasm related pain occurred after pancreatic cancer 
in 256 (1.9%) patients. Systematic validation using the UTHealth EHR confirmed 
the validity of the discovered trajectories.
CONCLUSION: We identified signature disease trajectories for the studied rare 
cancers by leveraging large-scale EHR data and trajectory mining approaches. 
These disease trajectories could serve as potential resources for clinicians to 
deepen their understanding of the temporal progression of conditions preceding 
and following these rare cancers, further informing patient-care decisions.

BACKGROUND: Inconsistent pathological responses between primary tumors and lymph 
nodes are frequently observed in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer 
(LAGC) undergoing neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. However, limited studies have 
evaluated the prognostic significance of such discrepancies. This study aims to 
investigate the prognostic value of combined pathological responses in the 
primary tumor and lymph nodes among patients with LAGC treated with neoadjuvant 
chemoimmunotherapy.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 109 patients with LAGC who underwent 
radical surgery following neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. Demographic and 
pathological characteristics were collected. Patients were classified into four 
groups based on the pathological responses of the primary tumor and lymph nodes, 
and relevant clinicopathological features were compared. Overall survival (OS) 
was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: The rates of ypN0, pathological complete response (pCR), and primary 
tumor pathological complete response [ypT(pCR)] were 64.2% (46/109), 26.6% 
(29/109), and 28.4% (31/109), respectively. A significant correlation was 
observed between ypT(pCR) and ypN0 (p < 0.001), although discrepancies between 
the two persisted. Combined pathological responses of the primary tumor and 
lymph nodes were significantly associated with prognosis (p = 0.040). Notably, 
patients with signet ring cell carcinoma had a poorer pathological response and 
significantly worse prognosis (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: A significant correlation exists between primary tumor and lymph 
node responses in LAGC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. 
Combined assessment of both responses may serve as a reliable predictor of 
clinical outcomes.

Tumour progression is accompanied by metabolic reprogramming, enabling 
adaptation to the nutrient-deprived microenvironment. Amino acids, as key 
metabolic substrates, play a central role in metabolic reprogramming. Beyond 
their conventional metabolic roles, amino acids function as signalling 
molecules, activating specific (e.g., BAG2, RBM39, HDAC6, and NMDA receptor) or 
promiscuous (e.g., GCN2, mTORC1) sensor proteins and subsequently promoting 
tumour cell proliferation and survival through oncogenic signalling pathways or 
epigenetic modifications. This review aims to summarise the non-metabolic 
functions of amino acids, particularly focusing on their sensor-mediated 
cross-talk, to utilise their potential as novel therapeutic targets.

BACKGROUND: In metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), PTEN 
deficiency results in PI3K/AKT pathway activation, providing an independent 
proliferative drive, which cannot be suppressed by androgen receptor pathway 
inhibitors (ARPIs), resulting in worse outcomes. Dual inhibition of PI3K/AKT and 
AR pathways with capivasertib and abiraterone may delay progression and improve 
disease outcomes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In CAPItello-281 (NCT04493853), patients with 
PTEN-deficient mHSPC (diagnostic cut-off: ≥90% viable malignant cells with no 
specific cytoplasmic PTEN immunohistochemistry staining) received capivasertib 
or placebo (1:1) plus abiraterone, prednisone/prednisolone and androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT). Primary endpoint was investigator-assessed 
radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS); overall survival (OS) was a key 
secondary endpoint. Post-hoc exploratory subgroups at increasing PTEN cut-off 
thresholds were also assessed.
RESULTS: 25.3% (1519/6003) of patients with valid tumor test results had 
PTEN-deficient tumors. In the randomized PTEN-deficient population, a 
statistically significant improvement in rPFS was observed with capivasertib 
plus abiraterone (n=507, median 33.2 months) versus placebo plus abiraterone 
(n=505, 25.7 months; Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.66-0.98, P=0.034). 
Post-hoc rPFS analyses for loss of PTEN cut-offs of ≥95%, ≥99%, and 100% showed 
the capivasertib plus abiraterone arm performed consistently across cutoffs, but 
the placebo plus abiraterone arm performed progressively worse as the cut-off 
for the degree of PTEN loss was increased, resulting in a numerically improved 
treatment effect. In the overall population studied, the HR for OS (26.4% 
maturity) was 0.90, 95% CI 0.71-1.15, P=0.401. The most common adverse events 
(AEs) for capivasertib plus abiraterone were diarrhea (51.9%; 8.0% placebo plus 
abiraterone), hyperglycemia (38.0%; 12.9%) and rash (35.4%; 7.0%). Deaths 
associated with an AE were reported in 36 (7.2%) and 26 (5.2%) patients in the 
capivasertib plus abiraterone and placebo plus abiraterone arms, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Capivasertib plus abiraterone improves rPFS versus placebo plus 
abiraterone in PTEN-deficient mHSPC, on a background of ADT, with a 7.5-month 
improvement in median rPFS. AE profile was consistent with that of the 
individual agents. Patients with PTEN-deficient mHSPC benefit from dual blockade 
of the PI3K/AKT and AR pathways with capivasertib plus abiraterone.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) frequently develops resistance to 
radiotherapy, while its metabolic reliance on glucose and glutamine presents new 
therapeutic targets for radiotherapy sensitization. This study developed a 
targeted nanoliposome (G/B-Lip-R) co-delivering glucose oxidase (GOD) and 
buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) to enhance radiotherapy through dual metabolic 
intervention. GOD catalyzes glucose oxidation to generate hydrogen peroxide 
(H2O2) while depleting tumor energy supplies, whereas BSO inhibits glutathione 
(GSH) synthesis to disrupt redox homeostasis. Their synergistic action 
significantly elevates intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, 
thereby potentiating radiosensitivity. Both in vitro and in vivo studies 
demonstrated that G/B-Lip-R effectively targets tumors and significantly 
improves radiotherapy outcomes. This work innovatively combines nanocarriers 
with dual metabolic pathway modulation, offering a novel strategy to overcome 
TNBC radioresistance with important clinical translation potential.

BACKGROUND: Lutetium-177 [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T (177Lu-PSMA-I&T) and the 
bone-seeking α-emitter radium-223 (223Ra) are established life-extending 
therapies for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; 
however, resistance and progression are inevitable. We aimed to evaluate the 
safety and preliminary antitumour activity of 177Lu-PSMA-I&T combined with 223Ra 
in this patient group.
METHODS: We conducted an investigator-initiated, single-centre, single-arm, 
phase 1/2 trial (AlphaBet) at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, 
Australia. Adults (aged ≥18 years) with a diagnosis of progressive, metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status score of 0-2, at least two visible bone metastases not 
treated with radiotherapy, previous exposure to an androgen receptor pathway 
inhibitor, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive disease (defined 
by maximum standardised uptake value ≥20 at a site of disease), and no 
discordant sites (ie, avid on 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET-CT with 
minimal PSMA expression and no uptake on bone scintigraphy) were eligible for 
inclusion. Phase 1 dose-escalation assessed two dose levels of 223Ra (27·5 
kBq/kg and 55·0 kBq/kg) combined with 7·4 GBq 177Lu-PSMA-I&T, administered 
intravenously every 6 weeks for up to six cycles. Phase 2 dose expansion 
continued with the recommended phase 2 dose. Co-primary endpoints were the 
maximum tolerated or administered dose and the recommended phase 2 dose (phase 
1), and the PSA response rate (phase 2), analysed in all patients treated at the 
maximum tolerated or administered dose in either phase. Safety was assessed in 
all patients who received at least one dose of either protocol treatment in 
phase 1 or 2. Herein, we report the results of an interim analysis, which was 
added to the protocol following an amendment on May 30, 2024. This trial is 
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05383079) and follow-up is ongoing.
FINDINGS: Between Nov 3, 2022, and Nov 5, 2024, 37 patients were enrolled, of 
whom 36 (97%; median age 72·5 years [IQR 67·0-78·0]) were included in the safety 
analysis and 33 (89%) were included in the preliminary activity analysis. No 
dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The recommended phase 2 dose of 223Ra 
was 55·0 KBq/kg combined with 7·4 GBq 177Lu-PSMA-I&T, administered every 6 
weeks. With a median follow-up of 13·3 months (IQR 8·7-17·1), 11 (31%) patients 
completed all six cycles of both treatments. 18 (50%) patients discontinued 
treatment early, primarily due to unequivocal disease progression (11 [61%]) or 
adverse events (three [17%]). A reduction in PSA of at least 50% was observed in 
18 (55%; 95% CI 36-72) patients. Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse 
events occurred in five (14%) of 36 patients, including anaemia (four [11%]) and 
neutropenia (three [8%]), with no treatment-related deaths. Non-clinically 
significant grade 3 lymphopenia occurred in ten (28%) patients.
INTERPRETATION: The combination of 177Lu-PSMA-I&T and 223Ra is safe and feasible 
in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone 
metastases. These findings warrant further evaluation of combined α-emitting and 
β-emitting approaches.

Reactivating lineage commitment to differentiate, and hence eliminate, cancer 
stem cells (CSCs) remains a therapeutic challenge. Here, we present CANDiT 
(cancer-associated nodes for differentiation targeting), a machine learning 
framework that identifies transcriptomic vulnerabilities for differentiation 
therapy in colorectal cancer (CRC). Centering on CDX2-a master intestinal 
lineage factor lost in high-risk, poorly differentiated CRCs-we identify PRKAB1, 
a stress polarity sensor, as a top therapeutic target. A clinical-grade PRKAB1 
agonist reactivates lineage programs, dismantles Wnt/YAP-driven stemness, and 
selectively eliminates CDX2-low CSCs across CRC cell lines, xenografts, and 
patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Multivariate analysis reveals a strong 
therapeutic index tied to the CDX2-low state. A 50-gene response signature, 
derived from integrated modeling across all platforms, predicts ∼50% reduction 
in recurrence and mortality risk. Like immunotherapy, CANDiT resurrects a 
physiologic program-differentiation-to selectively eliminate CSCs, offering a 
scalable, precision framework for lineage restoration in solid tumors.

BACKGROUND: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a promising target for 
imaging and theranostics in prostate cancer (PCa). Current PSMA tracers face 
limitations due to short half-lives and logistics. We developed a PSMA-targeted 
PET radiotracer, [64Cu]Cu-NGUL and [67Cu]Cu-NGUL, and evaluated their 
preclinical feasibility.
METHODS: Radiolabeling parameters (ligand concentration, pH, temperature, 
incubation time) were optimized and stability was assessed in buffer and human 
serum at 37 °C for 60 h. In vitro uptake was measured in PSMA-positive (22Rv1) 
and PSMA-negative (PC-3) cells. Biodistribution, PET imaging, and 
dosimetry-based effective dose estimation were performed in 22Rv1 xenograft 
models.
RESULTS: [64Cu]Cu-NGUL was obtained with >99 % yield (n = 3) and excellent 
stability for 60 h. Uptake in 22Rv1 cells was approximately fivefold higher than 
in PC-3 (n = 3, p < 0.001). Biodistribution showed rapid renal clearance with 
tumor uptake of 16.3 %ID/g at 0.17 h, decreasing over 24 h (n = 4). PET 
confirmed clear, PSMA-specific tumor localization at all imaging time points 
(SUV 0.28 ± 0.04 at 2 h). The estimated effective dose was 0.01 mSv/MBq.
CONCLUSION: [64Cu]Cu-NGUL was efficiently radiolabeled and demonstrated 
PSMA-specific uptake in vitro and in vivo, supporting its potential for clinical 
translation as a PSMA-targeted tracer. Dosimetry findings indicate a favorable 
safety profile and warrant further evaluation of its 67Cu analogue for 
theranostic applications in PCa.

BACKGROUND: National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers (NCI-CCs) 
throughout the United States are mandated to translate state-of-the-art cancer 
research to communities and enhance clinical care for patients within their 
catchment areas. NCI-CCs play a vital role in national cancer initiatives 
focused on optimizing cancer care via personalized medicine in which improved 
risk assessment, screening, and genetic testing are foundational. In this era of 
targeted personalized care, although genetics has been incorporated into cancer 
centers, it is unknown how these innovations are being communicated to the 
public and communities served on cancer center websites. There is particularly 
limited knowledge surrounding how NCI-CCs publicly communicate their efforts to 
integrate patient-reported experiences with genomics to fulfill their overall 
mission and reduce the cancer burden in their catchment areas.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate how NCI-CCs publicly 
share information on their websites related to cancer center programming and 
activities to measure and incorporate patients' experiences with the use of 
genetics to guide cancer care.
METHODS: For all NCI-CCs providing clinical care (N=65), we conducted a review 
of publicly available and published information and assessed five domains 
relevant to patients' experiences with genomic medicine: whether NCI-CCs (1) 
provided genetic testing, (2) directly expressed a goal of delivering 
personalized care, (3) provided pharmacogenomic testing, (4) assessed 
patient-reported experience measures with genomic medicine (including 
patient-reported outcomes [PROs] and other patient experience measures [OPEMs]), 
and (5) indicated an established infrastructure or set of resources to evaluate 
patient experience. We conducted a content analysis of the publicly available 
websites of NCI-CCs using the validated directed approach to content analysis. 
We quantified the results of our content analysis using count measures based on 
a binary (yes or no) coding scheme.
RESULTS: While almost all the NCI-CCs (64/65, 98%) discussed providing 
personalized care and performing genetic testing on their websites, we found 
that 58% (38/65) indicated online that they assessed PROs or other patient 
experience measures with genomic medicine. Fewer centers (25/65, 38%) discussed 
on their websites having a mechanism for evaluating patients' experiences with 
genomic medicine that captured broader types of information beyond PROs, such as 
measures of patient education or care team communication. Finally, approximately 
1 in 3 NCI-CCs (23/65, 35%) indicated having an established infrastructure with 
departmental resources dedicated to monitoring patients' experiences. These 
centers reflecting a built-in infrastructure were 8% to 12% more likely to 
publicly communicate targeted activities to assess patients' experiences with 
genomic medicine.
CONCLUSIONS: With the burgeoning use of genomics in research and clinical care, 
comprehensive evaluation and incorporation of measures of patients' experiences 
with genomic medicine present a key opportunity to enhance cancer care at 
NCI-CCs.

With Metastatic Lung Cancer Using Real-World Data From the TriNetX Network: 
Retrospective Cohort Study.

BACKGROUND: Survivors of metastatic lung cancer (MLC) face a heightened risk of 
developing second primary cancers (SPCs), which significantly impact long-term 
outcomes. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer 
treatment, but their potential role in reducing SPC risk remains underexplored. 
This study investigates the association between ICI treatment and the incidence 
of SPCs in a large, real-world cohort of patients with MLC.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate whether treatment with ICIs is associated 
with a reduced risk of developing SPCs in patients with metastatic or locally 
advanced lung cancer, using real-world data from the TriNetX global health 
research network.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX Global 
Collaborative Network, which aggregates deidentified electronic health records 
from more than 135 million patients. Adults diagnosed with MLC between February 
2004 and February 2024 were included. Patients were divided into 2 cohorts based 
on ICI exposure. Propensity score matching was applied to balance baseline 
characteristics. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards 
models were used to assess the incidence of SPCs and the composite outcome of 
SPC or death.
RESULTS: Among 2844 eligible patients, 685 received ICIs and 2157 did not. After 
propensity score matching, both cohorts included 685 patients. The 5-year 
incidence of SPCs was lower in the ICI group (1.5%) compared to the non-ICI 
group (4.2%), with a hazard ratio of 0.49 (95% CI 0.24-1.01), suggesting a 
potential protective effect. Furthermore, ICI treatment was significantly 
associated with a reduced risk of the composite outcome of SPC or death (hazard 
ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.62-0.89). Median follow-up was 20.2 (IQR 60-not reached) 
months for the ICI group and 68.4 (IQR 36-not reached) months for the non-ICI 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large real-world cohort, ICI treatment was associated with 
a lower risk of developing SPCs and improved overall outcomes in patients with 
MLC. These findings support the hypothesis that ICIs may offer a preventive 
benefit beyond their primary oncologic indications. While the retrospective 
nature and data limitations warrant cautious interpretation, this study 
underscores the value of real-world evidence in identifying novel therapeutic 
benefits and guiding future prospective research.

BACKGROUND: Women with breast or gynecological cancer and their intimate 
partners often face sexual problems in their relationships. Accessing care for 
sexual health problems is challenging for several reasons (eg, limited trained 
health care providers and privacy concerns), making self-management approaches 
highly promising.
OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the feasibility of the Psychosexual Educational 
Partners Program (PEPP), a 6-week sexual health self-management intervention for 
women treated for breast or gynecological cancer and their intimate partners.
METHODS: A mixed methods single-arm, repeated measures design was used for this 
study. An attrition rate of ≤25% was considered feasible. Intervention 
experiences were assessed via interviews, and preliminary effects on the Dyadic 
Sexual Communication Scale, relationship quality measured by the Revised Dyadic 
Adjustment Scale, and sexual health measured by PROMIS Sexual Function and 
Satisfaction version 2.0 were explored quantitatively.
RESULTS: In total, 7 (77%) of the 9 couples completed the study through week 6 
and provided both pre- and poststudy data, resulting in an attrition rate of 22% 
(2/9), which met the feasibility benchmark for attrition of 25% or less. The 
following two themes emerged: (1) PEPP helped us start difficult conversations 
and impacted emotional and physical intimacy. The intervention adherence was 
85%. Dyadic Sexual Communication Scale scores improved with a mean change score 
of 6.64 (SD 9.65) and a Cohen d of 0.69. Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale scores 
declined slightly, with a mean change score of -0.93 (SD 3.41) and a Cohen d of 
0.27. PROMIS Sexual Function and Satisfaction version 2.0 scores showed small 
improvements for women on desire, with a mean change score of 2.36 (SD 6.24) and 
a Cohen d of 0.38. Similarly, for women, the satisfaction mean change score was 
2.20 (SD 8.22) and a Cohen d of 0.27. For intimate partners, a small effect was 
found for desire, but in this instance, desire decreased with a mean change 
score of -1.57 (SD 6.09) and a Cohen d of 0.26.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings support PEPP as a feasible intervention for improving 
sexual communication. If proven effective in a randomized controlled trial, it 
has the potential to address the critical gap in supportive care among female 
cancer survivors.

Department, Witten/Herdecke University, Witten, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Integrative nursing (IN) involves the application of external 
naturopathic nursing interventions, such as compresses, embrocations, and 
therapeutic baths and washes. As part of a university hospital project, patients 
receiving oncology care in participating wards receive IN interventions as 
supportive care during their hospital stay as part of a consultation service.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the acceptance, feasibility, and 
contextual conditions of implementing IN in inpatient care and to evaluate 
perceptions, experiences, and perceived impact of IN interventions from multiple 
stakeholder perspectives.
METHODS: We used a convergent parallel mixed methods approach guided by the 
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. The evaluation consists of 5 
substudies reflecting multiple perspectives on the project. Patients, relatives, 
and hospital staff will participate. Substudies include a single-arm pre-post 
questionnaire (substudy 1) and semistructured interviews (substudy 2) with 
patients, a cross-sectional survey of relatives (substudy 3), semistructured 
interviews with health care professionals (substudy 4), and analysis of 
project-related documentation (substudy 5). Qualitative data will be analyzed 
using qualitative content analysis, and quantitative data will be analyzed using 
descriptive and inferential statistical methods.
RESULTS: Following separate analyses of each substudy, the findings will be 
integrated and triangulated to generate overarching meta-inferences. The 
recruitment phase lasted from October 2023 to January 2025. Data collection was 
completed in March 2025. As of October 2025, after data verification and 
plausibility checks, data analysis is ongoing. The first results are expected to 
be published in 2026.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a mixed methods research protocol aimed at 
exploring the implementation of IN within a university hospital setting. It is 
expected to provide a theory-based contribution to IN implementation in 
inpatient care while also offering insights into its potential effects at the 
patient level. The study is anticipated to advance understanding of how IN can 
be sustainably embedded in hospital practice and to provide actionable insights 
for improving patient-centered supportive care.

PURPOSE: Post-treatment head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors experience multiple 
symptoms and behavioral health issues. We developed Head and Neck Survivorship 
Tool: Assessments and Recommendation (HN-STAR), a clinical decision support tool 
using electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) to improve follow-up of HNC 
survivors.
METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial of oncology 
practices in the Wake Forest National Cancer Institute Community Oncology 
Research Program Research Base comparing HN-STAR to usual care (UC) during a 
routine clinic visit. Eligible survivors completed treatment for HNC < 2 years 
before. Before the visit, survivors completed ePROs rating the burden of 26 
concerns (symptoms and health behaviors). During the visit, HN-STAR presented 
survivor's concerns and tailored clinician recommendations. After the visit, 
survivors reported which concerns were discussed. To evaluate differences in 
concerns discussed in clinic, concerns were characterized as absent or mild 
versus burdensome, with comparisons between arms for number of concerns 
discussed, number of burdensome concerns discussed, and proportion of burdensome 
concerns discussed, assessed by mixed models adjusted for within-practice 
correlation.
RESULTS: Three hundred forty-nine survivors at 28 practices reported a previsit 
mean of 7.5 burdensome concerns (standard deviation, 4.6), most commonly 
xerostomia (70%), taste changes (53%), and neck or shoulder stiffness (48%). In 
adjusted models, survivors in the HN-STAR arm had more burdensome concerns 
discussed (4.1 v 3.3 concerns, P = .042) and a greater proportion of burdensome 
concerns discussed (57% v 44%, P = .015) at the visit than survivors in the UC 
arm.
CONCLUSION: In a large, national, diverse, and symptomatic sample of HNC 
survivors at community oncology practices, using an ePRO-informed clinical 
decision support tool increased the likelihood that burdensome concerns were 
discussed in clinic. Alerting providers to burdensome concerns and presenting 
guideline-concordant management options at the point of care may improve 
provider-survivor interactions.

PURPOSE: Geriatric assessment and management (GAM) is a guideline-recommended 
strategy for optimizing cancer management among older adults. A recent 
cost-utility analysis of the Canadian 5C randomized controlled trial (RCT) found 
GAM to be cost effective for selected groups. This study aimed to assess the 
cost-utility of GAM plus usual care (UC) versus UC alone in older adults with 
cancer using a decision model and best available evidence from four 
international RCTs-GAIN, GAP70, INTEGERATE, and 5C.
METHODS: For the model, we used pooled data from four RCTs and peer-reviewed 
literature. Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were performed from the 
Canadian health care payer perspective, applying a 6-month time horizon. 
Sensitivity analyses included per-trial scenario analyses, 1-year time horizon, 
and US health care payer perspective. We reported costs per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) and incremental net monetary benefit (INMB).
RESULTS: The base-case analysis indicated that GAM had an INMB of $599 in 
Canadian dollars (CAD; 95% credibility interval, -$3,428 to $4,742) with 60.9% 
probability of being cost effective at a threshold of $50,000 (CAD) per QALY. 
Trial-specific results varied, with the GAP70 and INTEGERATE trials yielding 
positive INMB ($2,231 [CAD] and $2,104 [CAD], respectively), suggesting 
cost-effectiveness, whereas 5C and GAIN resulted in negative INMB (-$489 [CAD] 
and -$234 [CAD], respectively). Chemotherapy and hospitalization costs were the 
main driver of costs in both strategies.
CONCLUSION: GAM is overall cost effective, with results varying across trial 
scenarios due to differences in chemotherapy dose intensity, hospitalization 
rates, and associated costs. Future research should prioritize identifying 
optimal core GAM components, delivery mode, and patient selection criteria to 
enhance its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.

Metastasis is a major factor leading to an unfavorable prognosis in gastric 
cancer (GC). However, factors driving GC metastasis are not fully understood. 
Single-cell transcriptome analysis was done on three primary GC samples, one 
adjacent nontumor sample, and six GC metastasis samples (GSE163558) to clarify 
cellular composition characteristics, differential genes, and screen genes 
related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Effects of GPX3 on GC growth 
and metastasis were assessed through in vitro cell experiments, a GC liver 
metastasis model, a GC organoid model, and an organoid xenograft nude mouse 
model. The primary tumor samples showed a higher proportion of epithelial cells, 
and analysis revealed a significant reduction in GPX3 levels in GC metastasis 
samples within the subpopulation of epithelial cells undergoing EMT. Cell 
experiments demonstrated low expression of GPX3 in GC cells, and overexpression 
of GPX3 inhibited cell migration, invasion, and EMT in GC cells. Further 
validation in a nude mouse liver metastasis model confirmed the repressive role 
of GPX3 in GC metastasis. Additionally, GPX3 could inhibit the growth of 
patient-derived GC organoids and impede tumor growth and metastasis in an 
organoid xenograft nude mouse model. This study, based on single-cell 
transcriptome analysis, revealed the potential inhibitory factor GPX3 in 
metastatic GC and validated its effects on GC growth and metastasis using GC 
cells and organoids in vitro and in vivo experiments. These findings offer 
insights into understanding GC heterogeneity and targeting GPX3 in GC 
therapeutic strategies.

Chemotherapy continues to be the standard of care for metastatic malignancies, 
such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Although the treatment strategy 
increases survival rates marginally, it frequently leads to the development of 
resistant disease and side effects. It is imperative to develop an alternate 
chemotherapy formulation with better efficacy and lesser adverse effects in TNBC 
patients. Cell viability and cholesterol level were measured using 
spectrophotometer and fluorometric assays. The 4T1 syngeneic BALB/c female mice 
were used as an in vivo metastatic TNBC model. Simvastatin (Sim) and Metformin 
(Met) were administered in combination (3.5-7.0 and 175-350 μg/g body weight, 
respectively) and alone (Sim 7.0 μg/g/day, or Met 350 μg/g/day) orally over an 
8-week period, and the standard Anticancer drug docetaxel (Doc) was administered 
at a dose of 24 μg/g body weight through IP injection every 3 weeks. 
Phosphorylation levels of protein and histopathology of tumors were studied by 
immunoblot and H & E staining methods, respectively. We report that the 
viability of TNBC cells is significantly and synergistically reduced by Sim and 
Met co-treatment, with negligible adverse effects on normal breast cell line. 
Sim Met combination down regulates phosphorylation at specific sites of AKT 
(Ser-473/Thr-308) and AMPKα (Ser-485/491) and up regulates ACC phosphorylation 
(Ser-79), which in turn minimizes the cellular cholesterol synthesis in the TNBC 
model. Further study demonstrated that the combination significantly reduced 
tumor formation effectively than docetaxel. Study confirmed that the combination 
of Sim and Met is a promising chemotherapeutic approach for metastatic TNBC.

Alternative splicing of FOXM1 produces different isoforms, which have been 
proven to exist and have complex functions. One of the isoforms of FOXM1, 
isoform ENST00000535350, is a short noncoding RNA sequence, designated as FOXM1s 
here. We determined the function and mechanism of FOXM1s-encoded peptide, 
FOXM1s, in the development and progression of pancreatic cancer. The expression 
of FOXM1s as noncoding RNA in pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines was 
analyzed by RT-PCR. Gene expression and its association with clinicopathologic 
characteristics of patients with PDAC were analyzed using IF and bioinformatics. 
The effects on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, tumor stemness, and on 
PI3K/AKT signaling were evaluated through in vitro biology methods and 
functionally validated in mouse models by using overexpression and knockdown 
approaches. The expression of FOXM1s in human pancreatic cancer tissues and cell 
lines was significantly increased. The overexpression of FOXM1s had a promoting 
effect on pancreatic cancer, while the mutation of FOXM1s attenuated its effect, 
indicating that FOXM1s exerted its role potentially through ORF2-encoded a 
peptide. The specific antibody #FOXM1s was used to validate that FOXM1s 
expressed a predicted peptide, FOXM1s, and its expression was upregulated in 
pancreatic cancer. FOXM1s significantly promoted the proliferation, migration, 
and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells, facilitated liver metastasis, and 
upregulated the expression of stem-related genes in pancreatic cancer. 
Mechanistically, the FOXM1s peptide encoded by FOXM1s activated the PI3K/AKT 
signaling pathway. FOXM1s encodes a FOXM1s peptide and exhibits oncogenic 
function in the pancreatic cancer development progression at least in part 
through activating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This novel molecule could serve 
as a potential therapeutic target.

Curcumin is a natural polyphenolic compound extracted from the rhizomes of 
Curcuma longa, exhibiting a wide range of biological activities, including 
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, antibacterial, antiviral, and 
neuroprotective effects. However, its low oral absorption rate and poor 
bioavailability limit its clinical application. To address this issue, this 
study synthesized a novel curcumin derivative, AN02, which significantly 
improves the absorption rate and bioavailability while enhancing its antitumor 
activity. This study focused on the antitumor mechanism of AN02 in ovarian 
cancer, particularly its ability to inhibit ovarian cancer cell proliferation, 
invasion, and migration by regulating the APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli)-SMAD4 
(SMAD family member 4)-CTLA-4 (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein 4) 
molecular axis. Experimental results demonstrated that AN02 significantly 
inhibited ovarian cancer cell proliferation at very low concentrations, with its 
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) significantly lower than that of 
curcumin. Additionally, AN02 exerted its antitumor effects by activating the 
APC-SMAD4 molecular axis and inhibiting the CTLA-4 molecular axis. Silencing 
CTLA-4 inhibits the proliferation and immune escape of ovarian cancer. Further 
molecular mechanism studies revealed that APC directly regulates the 
SMAD4-CTLA-4 molecular axis, while SMAD4 forms a chaperone relationship with 
CTLA-4 and promotes CTLA-4 degradation through the K48-dependent ubiquitination 
pathway, thereby suppressing the malignant phenotype of ovarian cancer cells. 
These findings not only reveal the antitumor mechanism of AN02 but also provide 
new insights for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Animal experiments also 
demonstrated that AN02 significantly inhibits the proliferation of subcutaneous 
xenograft tumors in mice. As a novel curcumin derivative, AN02 exhibits 
significant antitumor activity and inhibits ovarian cancer progression by 
regulating the APC-SMAD4-CTLA-4 molecular axis. This study lays an important 
theoretical foundation for the development of novel antitumor drugs based on 
AN02, with significant clinical application potential. However, the long-term 
toxicity and safety of AN02 require further investigation to establish safe 
dosage standards for clinical use. Future studies will focus on exploring 
combination therapy strategies of AN02 in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer to 
provide new directions for precision treatment of ovarian cancer.

PurposeThis study assessed dosimetric effects of setup errors on boost target 
volume (PTVboost) coverage using simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) in 
early-stage left-sided breast cancer.Methods35 patients who received 
whole-breast radiotherapy (40.0 Gy/15 Fr) combined with a SIB to the tumor bed 
(48.0 Gy/15 Fr) were retrospectively analyzed. Translational-rotational coupled 
errors (1.0°rotation paired with 1.0 mm translation, 2.0° with 2.0 mm, 3.0° with 
3.0 mm) were simulated about all axes. The D95 (dose to 95% of the PTVboost) and 
V95 (volume covered by 95% of the prescribed dose) were assessed through 
multivariate analysis to explore the relationship between PTVboost coverage and 
various anatomy factors, including the volume of the PTVboost (V_boost), the 
distance from the PTVboost centroid to the isocentre (D_iso), the mean depth 
from the anterior edge of PTVboost to the body surface (S_Depth), and setup 
errors.ResultsUnder a combination of 1.0° rotation and 1.0 mm setup errors, the 
D95 values and V95 coverage of the PTVboost were ≥95% in all cases. However, 
when the error combination increased to 2.0°:2.0 mm, there was a significant 
decrease in coverage, with approximately 80% of the target areas exhibiting D95 
and V95 values <95%. When the setup errors further increased to 3.0°:3.0 mm, D95 
and V95 values were <95% in all cases. Multivariate analysis indicated that 
V_boost, D_iso, and S_Depth were significant predictors of target 
coverage.ConclusionPTVboost dose coverage risk were synergistically influenced 
by increasing D_iso, reduced V_boost, and shorter S_Depth. The multivariate 
model may stratify coverage risk categories using tumor anatomy and setup error 
magnitudes.

The transcriptional coactivator YAP1 regulates numerous biological processes, 
including organ size control and tissue homeostasis. Although its hyperactivity 
promotes tumor development and progression, YAP1 itself is not yet druggable. 
Here, we found that the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase PARP1 promoted the 
transcriptional activity of YAP1-TEAD4 complexes that mediate breast cancer cell 
stemness, metastatic behavior, and evasion of antitumor immunity. This 
PARP1-mediated mechanism was independent of its role in the DNA damage response. 
Specifically, PARP1 directly interacted with and promoted the formation of the 
YAP1-TEAD4 complex by PARylating TEAD4 at a conserved Arg-Lys sequence. This 
PARP1-enhanced YAP1-TEAD4 binding attenuated the interaction between YAP1 and 
the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4DCAF12, thus preventing its ubiquitylation and 
degradation. Furthermore, the abundance of PARP1 protein correlated with that of 
YAP1 and the immune checkpoint protein PD-L1 in breast cancer tissues and cell 
lines. In a mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer, pharmacological 
inhibition of PARP1 enhanced the ability of antibody blockade of PD-L1 to 
increase cytolytic and tumor-suppressive T cell infiltration and reduce tumor 
growth. The findings reveal a mechanism that promotes YAP1-TEAD4 transcriptional 
activity and immune escape in breast cancer cells and is targetable with 
clinically approved therapies.

Explicating miRNA-mediated regulation of inflammatory pathways in COPD, MS, and 
lung cancer using explainable artificial intelligence: insights from peripheral 
blood profiles.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple sclerosis 
(MS), and lung cancer are linked by shared inflammatory pathways and immune 
dysregulation. miRNAs regulate these processes by influencing gene expression, 
yet their roles in the molecular mechanisms across neurological and respiratory 
systems are not fully understood.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify miRNAs and their target genes regulating 
inflammatory pathways, advancing the understanding of molecular genetics 
underlying COPD, MS, and lung cancer.
METHODS: miRNA expression data (GSE61741) were analyzed using a Random Forest 
(RF) model optimized via Grid Search and validated with Stratified K-Fold 
cross-validation. Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE) addressed data 
imbalance, while SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) identified key miRNAs. 
Functional enrichment and pathway analyses explored miRNA-gene interactions. 
Single-cell level analysis further validated the cell-specific roles of these 
genes. An independent dataset (GSE31568) was used for validation.
RESULTS: Key miRNAs, including hsa-let-7c, hsa-miR-454, hsa-miR-92a, and 
hsa-miR-223, were identified as regulators of hallmark inflammatory genes such 
as CCL2, IL6, ITGB3, and MYC. These genes are critical for cytokine signaling, 
epithelial repair, and immune modulation. Single-cell analysis highlighted the 
role of inflammatory fibroblasts in localized inflammation and tissue 
remodeling. The RF model achieved an accuracy of 81.58%, validated at 82.55%. 
Pathway analysis emphasized cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions and shared 
pathways between neurological and respiratory diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies miRNAs and their target genes as critical 
regulators of inflammation in COPD, MS, and lung cancer. Single-cell insights 
and pathway enrichment provide a comprehensive view of shared molecular 
mechanisms, contributing to biomarker discovery and therapeutic strategies for 
precision medicine in inflammatory diseases.

Breast cancer remains the most common cancer among women worldwide, and 
recurrence rates stay high despite current treatments, especially for those with 
negative estrogen receptor status, where therapies are less effective, and 
prognosis is worse. Identifying molecules with predictive value for therapy 
response and prognosis is therefore crucial. In this context, FOXA1 could serve 
as a potential biomarker to predict the progression of ER-negative tumors. A 
search was conducted to answer the question, ""What is the prognostic value of 
FOXA1 expression in breast cancer, estrogen receptor negative?"" using various 
databases. Controlled vocabulary and Boolean operators were employed. Only 
studies reporting overall survival and disease-free survival, defined as the 
time from evaluation to death or relapse, were included. We identified seven 
articles evaluating FOXA1 and its relationship with disease-free survival (DFS) 
or overall survival (OS) in patients with ER-negative breast cancer. Our data 
indicate that higher FOXA1 expression is associated with improved overall 
survival (HR = 0.61, CI = 0.45-0.83, p < 0.002) and better disease-free survival 
(HR = 0.69, CI = 0.51-0.93, p < 0.02). These findings suggest that FOXA1 is 
linked to a favorable prognosis in terms of overall survival and disease-free 
survival. Further studies are needed to assess the role of FOXA1 in response to 
chemotherapy. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024453750.

BACKGROUND: Needs assessment tools may guide optimization of clinical services 
to be more patient-centered. As needs of patients living with and beyond 
colorectal cancer (CRC) may also be influenced by socio-cultural backgrounds and 
healthcare ecosystems, we developed and validated a needs assessment 
questionnaire for CRC in a multi-ethnic, low-and middle-income setting.
METHODS: The study methodology was guided by the COSMIN checklist. Items 
generation was based on findings from independent qualitative inquiries with 
patients, input from cancer stakeholders, and literature review. Following 
translation into Malay language, content and face validation were undertaken. 
The tool was administered to 300 individuals living with and beyond CRC. 
Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were 
performed. Criterion validity was assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR29 
questionnaires.
RESULTS: The 48-item bilingual needs assessment tool for colorectal cancer 
(NeAT-CC) encompassed six domains of needs, namely (i) diagnosis, (ii) 
psychosocial and information, (iii) healthcare, (iv) practical and living with 
cancer, (v) financial and (vi) employment. Cronbach's alpha was above 0.70 for 
all domains, indicating good internal consistency. CFA also demonstrated 
acceptable convergent and divergent validity with composite reliability >0.70 
and Heterotrait-Monotrait index <0.90 for all constructs. Criterion validity was 
established given the significant correlation with quality of life. The NeAT-CC 
was easily understandable, took 15-20 minutes for completion and may be 
self-administered.
CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of NeAT-CC may facilitate optimization of supportive 
and survivorship care services following CRC in local settings. The tool has 
wider potential for adaptation in other multi-ethnic and/or low and 
middle-income settings.

OBJECTIVE: Esophageal cancer is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide. 
Previous studies have shown that reduced skeletal and respiratory muscle 
strength is correlated with increased postoperative complications. This study 
investigated the relationship between hand grip strength (HGS) and respiratory 
muscle strength assessed as peak expiratory flow (PEF) rate. We also examined 
the association of these factors with long-term prognosis in patients who had 
undergone radical esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.
METHODS: We reviewed 392 patients who underwent radical subtotal esophagectomy 
from 2007 to 2023. HGS and PEF rate were measured preoperatively. Data analysis 
included univariable and multivariable Cox regression to identify prognostic 
factors for overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 36 months, 171 patients died, with 68.1% 
of deaths attributable to the primary disease. Because a weak correlation was 
observed between HGS and PEF rate (r = 0.353), separate multivariate analyses 
were performed for each factor to investigate their relationship to prognosis. 
Multivariable analysis identified PEF rate as an independent prognostic factor 
for OS (HR 0.991, 95% CI 0.984-0.999; P = .028), along with clinical stage (HR 
1.345, 95% CI 1.188-1.521; P < .001), age (HR 1.026, 95% CI 1.007-1.046; 
P = .008), and surgical approach (open vs. minimally invasive; HR 0.674, 95% CI 
0.490-0.928; P = .015). HGS was also identified as an independent prognostic 
factor for OS (HR 0.974, 95% CI 0.955-0.994; P = .012) along with clinical stage 
(HR 1.321, 95% CI 1.168-1.495; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: HGS and PEF rate are independent predictors of OS after 
esophagectomy.

Lipid metabolism in cancer cells: Its role in hepatocellular carcinoma 
progression and therapeutic resistance.

Liver cancer, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as its predominant form, 
remains among the deadliest malignancies worldwide. Despite the expanding array 
of treatment options, current therapies benefit only a limited subset of 
patients. Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, with lipid metabolism 
playing a pivotal role in tumor progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. 
HCC is profoundly influenced by alterations in lipid metabolic pathways, notably 
those involved in steatotic liver disease, a major risk factor. Key aspects such 
as de novo lipogenesis, lipid uptake, fatty acid oxidation, lipid peroxidation, 
biosynthesis of bioactive lipids, and cholesterol biosynthesis are all 
reprogrammed in liver cancer cells. These metabolic shifts modify the cancer 
cell lipidome-altering fatty acid unsaturation levels and other lipid 
profiles-to promote survival and resistance during therapy. Recent technological 
advances have deepened our understanding of dysregulated lipid metabolism in 
HCC. In this review, we examine how various facets of lipid metabolism 
contribute to HCC disease progression and resistance to standard treatments, 
including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and 
radiotherapy. We also explore the potential of targeting lipid metabolic 
pathways to enhance therapeutic efficacy and overcome resistance, highlighting 
dietary interventions as a promising, low-cost, low-side-effect strategy to 
resensitize resistant HCC cells.

In this study the authors aimed to identify factors affecting cervical cancer 
incidence and mortality across World Health Organization member countries. Out 
of 194 member states, 127 were included in the analysis due to data 
availability. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to examine how cervical 
cancer incidence and mortality relate to health system capacity and population 
characteristics. Our findings indicate that the adolescent birth rate 
significantly affects cervical cancer incidence (p < 0.05), while all variables 
except prevalence of tobacco use have a significant effect on mortality 
(p < 0.05). Health system factors had a greater impact on mortality, while 
population characteristics influenced incidence.

Intracellular Peptide N-Myristoylation for Cancer Cell Ferroptosis without 
Acquired Resistance.

N-Myristoylation, a well-known protein lipidation process, has yet to be 
explored for in situ peptide lipidation. Here, we report intracellular peptide 
N-myristoylation for potently inhibiting cancer cells. A self-assembling 
d-peptide, Gbb-NBD (1), comprising an N-terminal glycine, a d-dibiphenylalanine 
backbone, and a C-terminal nitrobenzofurazan, formed nanospheres in aqueous 
solution and exhibited strong cytotoxicity against cancer cells (GI50 = 500 nM) 
while sparing neuronal cells. Live-cell imaging showed that 1 traversed the 
plasma membrane to the ER, Golgi and mitochondria. NMT inhibition, LC-MS of cell 
lysates, and click chemistry confirmed the N-myristoylation of 1. Functional 
studies showed that blocking NMT activity or modifying the N-terminus suppressed 
cytotoxicity, establishing N-myristoylation as essential for activity. 
Mechanistically, immunoblotting, lipidomic profiling, and rescue assays 
demonstrated that myristoylated 1 disrupted lipid metabolism and induced 
ferroptotic cell death, notably without the emergence of acquired resistance. In 
contrast, premyristoylated 1 displayed poor uptake and weak activity, 
underscoring the importance of in situ lipidation for cellular entry and 
function. Together, these findings reveal intracellular N-myristoylation of a 
short peptide as a new approach to drive ferroptosis and highlight its potential 
for developing membrane-targeting supramolecular therapeutics.

Certain TP53 mutations can confer neomorphic gain of function (GOF) activities 
to the p53 protein that affect cancer progression. Yet the concept of mutant p53 
GOF has been challenged. Here, using various strategies to alter the status of 
mutant versions of p53 in different cell lines, we demonstrate that mutant p53 
stimulates cancer cell invasion in three-dimensional environments. 
Mechanistically, mutant p53 enhances RhoA/ROCK-dependent cell contractility and 
cell-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) reorganization via increasing 
mevalonate pathway-dependent RhoA localization to the membrane. In line with 
this, RhoA-dependent proinvasive activity is also mediated by IDI-1, a 
mevalonate pathway product. Further, the invasion-enhancing effect of mutant p53 
is dictated by the biomechanical properties of the surrounding ECM, thereby 
adding a cell-independent layer of regulation to mutant p53 GOF activity that is 
mediated by dynamic reciprocal cell-ECM interactions. Together our findings link 
mutant p53 metabolic GOF activity with a context-dependent invasive cellular 
phenotype.

IMPORTANCE: Receipt of anthracycline-based chemotherapy and statin therapy have 
been found to be associated with deterioration of cognitive function in patients 
with cancer.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of statins with attention, verbal fluency, 
and executive function in patients receiving doxorubicin treatment for cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This secondary analysis of the Preventing 
Anthracycline Cardiovascular Toxicity With Statins randomized clinical trial, 
conducted across 31 US community and academic sites from February 5, 2014, 
through September 24, 2020, involved participants with stage I to IV lymphoma or 
stage I to III breast cancer undergoing doxorubicin treatment. The data analysis 
was conducted between August 1, 2024, and April 4, 2025.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive a daily 40-mg dose 
of atorvastatin or placebo before initiating doxorubicin treatment and then 
continued for 24 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Attention, executive function, and verbal fluency 
were assessed using the Trail Making Test part A (TMT-A) and part B (TMT-B) and 
the Controlled Oral Word Association test, respectively. Time to complete the 
assessments were modeled using a linear mixed model, while errors (counts) were 
modeled using a generalized linear mixed model assuming a Poisson distribution.
RESULTS: A total of 238 participants (mean [SD] age, 49 [12] years; 217 female 
[91.2%]) were randomized to the statin (n = 118) or placebo (n = 120) groups. 
Values for TMT-A at 6 and 24 months were similar between the statin group (mean, 
32.5 seconds [95% CI, 29.4-35.7 seconds] and 29.8 seconds [95% CI, 26.4-33.2 
seconds], respectively) and the placebo group (mean, 28.4 seconds [95% CI, 
25.2-31.5 seconds] and 27.8 seconds [95% CI, 24.5-31.0 seconds], respectively). 
From before treatment to 24 months after treatment, statin recipients had a 
significant mean improvement of 10.2 seconds for TMT-B (95% CI, 1.9-18.5 
seconds), whereas placebo recipients had a nonsignificant improvement of only 
0.2 seconds for TMT-B (95% CI, -8.5 to 8.1 seconds). Analysis of the 
time-by-treatment interaction showed no significant difference between groups. 
For Controlled Oral Word Association scores in the same period, both the placebo 
and statin groups showed a mean improvement of 3.62 points (95% CI, 1.71-5.54 
points) and 4.74 points (95% CI, 2.69-6.79 points), respectively, with no 
difference between groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This secondary analysis of a randomized clinical 
trial suggests that the receipt of statins during doxorubicin therapy for 
lymphoma or breast cancer was not associated with worsening cognitive functions 
over 24 months. Within-group analyses suggested that statins may have 
contributed to better executive function on the TMT-B.

IMPORTANCE: Several colorectal cancer (CRC) screening modalities (eg, 
colonoscopy, stool-based tests) are currently available. Yet, recent national 
patterns in screening using these modalities and potential differences across 
sociodemographic groups remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate possible changes in the use of different CRC screening 
modalities among average-risk individuals aged 50 to 75 years in the US.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used 
deidentified claims data from 2017 to 2024. Participants included a dynamic 
cohort of commercially insured Blue Cross Blue Shield beneficiaries. Data were 
analyzed from May 1 to June 30, 2025.
EXPOSURES: Invasive and noninvasive CRC screening modalities.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in screening modality use were compared 
between the periods preceding the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (ie, preonset: 
January 1, 2017, to February 28, 2020) and following the onset of the pandemic 
(ie, postonset: July 1, 2020, to December 31, 2024). Changes in screening by 
modality were also evaluated using autoregressive integrated moving average 
models, adjusting for temporal autocorrelation and seasonality.
RESULTS: In this retrospective cohort study of 24 973 642 distinct beneficiaries 
(mean [SD] age, 57.36 [4.27] years; 12 789 413 female [51.21%]), the use of 
colonoscopy (mean [SD], 1.29% [0.09%] to 1.14% [0.07%]; P < .001) and fecal 
immunochemical test (FIT) decreased between the 2 periods (mean [SD], 0.54% 
[0.03%] to 0.38% [0.07%]; P < .001). However, stool DNA test use increased (mean 
[SD], 0.19% [0.13%] to 0.61% [0.16%]; P < .001). Males had higher use of 
colonoscopy than females (mean [SD], 1.21% [0.07%] vs 1.07% [0.07%]; P < .001), 
whereas females had higher use of stool DNA test than males (mean [SD], 0.68% 
[0.16%] vs 0.55% [0.15%]; P < .001) and FIT (mean [SD], 0.43% [0.08%] vs 0.33% 
[0.05%]; P < .001). Areas with socioeconomic status (SES) in the top 20% had 
higher use of colonoscopy compared with areas where a marker of SES was in the 
bottom 20% (mean [SD], 1.37% [0.09%] vs 0.91% [0.06%]; P < .001) and stool DNA 
test (mean [SD], 0.65% [0.17%] vs 0.48% [0.13%]; P < .001) and lower use of FIT 
(mean [SD], 0.36% [0.09%] vs 0.48% [0.06%]; P < .001). Metropolitan area 
residents, compared with nonmetropolitan area residents, more frequently 
underwent colonoscopy (mean [SD], 1.18% [0.08%] vs 0.97% [0.06%]; P < .001) and 
FIT (mean [SD], 0.41% [0.08%] vs 0.25% [0.04%]; P < .001); however, their use of 
stool DNA test were similar (mean [SD], 0.61% [0.16%] vs 0.64% [0.16%]; 
P = .51).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among privately insured individuals, the use of 
colonoscopy and FIT decreased after the COVID-19 pandemic while stool DNA test 
use increased, with differences by sex, area-level SES, and metropolitan area 
residence.

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has become a preferred approach for 
lung resection due to its ability to reduce thoracotomy-related complications 
and improve patient comfort. Nevertheless, significant morbidity and even 
mortality may still occur. Recent evidence suggests that inflammation-based 
indices, including the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII), 
and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), may serve as useful predictors of 
adverse outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive significance of 
these markers obtained during the preoperative and postoperative periods in 
patients undergoing VATS pulmonary resections. We retrospectively reviewed the 
records of patients who underwent VATS lobectomy or segmentectomy between 
January 2018 and December 2023. NLR, PLR, SII, and LMR were calculated from 
blood samples obtained preoperatively and on postoperative days 1 and 2. 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine optimal 
cut-off values, and patients were stratified into high and low groups 
accordingly. Associations between these groups and major complications were 
analyzed using Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Among 359 patients 
(32.0% female; mean age, 65.5 ± 10.5 years), major postoperative complications 
occurred in 75 (20.9%) patients. Significant predictors included elevated 
postoperative NLR (day 1: p < 0.001; day 2: p = 0.009), elevated postoperative 
PLR (day 1: p = 0.03), elevated postoperative SII (day 1: p = 0.002; day 2: 
p = 0.01), and reduced preoperative (p = 0.002) and postoperative day 2 LMR 
(p = 0.001). Inflammatory indices derived from routine hemograms are simple, 
cost-effective, and reliable predictors of postoperative complications in 
patients undergoing VATS pulmonary resection for lung cancer. These findings 
underscore the potential value of incorporating perioperative inflammatory 
markers into risk stratification and clinical decision-making.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer survivors (BCS) are at an increased risk of diabetes 
and frequently experience weight gain post-diagnosis. This study examined the 
association between post-diagnostic weight changes and diabetes risk in BCS.
METHODS: 40,850 BCS without a history of diabetes were identified. Changes in 
obesity status (body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2) and weight were assessed during 
general health examinations conducted before and after cancer diagnosis. The 
primary outcome was incident diabetes. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated after adjusting for traditional 
diabetes risk factors, cancer treatments, and sociodemographic variables.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 4.6 years, transitioning from non-obese to 
obese was associated with a 45% increased diabetes risk (aHR 1.45, 95% CI 
1.16-1.82). Persistent obesity was associated with an 87% increased diabetes 
risk (aHR 1.87, 95% CI 1.64-2.15). The strength of the association decreased in 
individuals who reverted from obese to non-obese (aHR 1.42, 95% CI 1.18-1.71). 
Substantial weight loss (> 10%) after diagnosis was associated with a 45% 
decreased risk of diabetes (aHR 0.55, 95% CI 0.43-0.70). In contrast, moderate 
weight gain (5-10%) was associated with an 18% increased risk (aHR 1.18, 95% CI 
1.02-1.38).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that transitioning to or maintaining an obese 
status post-diagnosis is associated with an increased diabetes risk, while 
substantial weight loss post-diagnosis is associated with a notable decrease in 
diabetes risk. Addressing obesity could significantly decrease the incidence of 
new-onset diabetes after breast cancer development.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Breast cancer survivors are advised to 
maintain a healthy body weight after their diagnosis to help reduce the risk of 
diabetes.

Modeling the mechanical behavior of human tissues, particularly tumor tissues, 
poses significant challenges due to the difficulty in acquiring samples. In this 
study, we performed a total of ten measurements on five freshly excised 
peritoneal metastasis samples, alongside ten measurements from two healthy colon 
samples, to develop mechanical models using the standard linear solid (SLS) 
model and its generalized forms. The peritoneal metastasis samples included 
colon cancer (2 samples), ovarian cancer (1 sample), and rectal cancer (2 
samples). An ex vivo static indentation test was conducted to assess the stress 
relaxation behavior of both tumor and healthy tissues using a step indentation 
protocol. A novel cross-validation approach was employed for model selection, 
based on mean square error (MSE) values. Due to the irregularity and complexity 
of tumor tissues, 80% of the tumor measurements required more complex models 
with additional parameters compared to the healthy colon tissues. The 
five-element double Maxwell-Wiechert (DMW) arm model was suitable for describing 
the mechanical behavior of all healthy colon tissue measurements. In contrast, 
the seven-element triple Maxwell-Wiechert (TMW) arm model best described 80% of 
the tumor tissue measurements, while the DMW model was adequate for the 
remaining 20%. Further histopathological analysis of the tissue samples may help 
elucidate the relationship between biological composition and mechanical 
properties.

causal relationship with lung cancer risk remains unclear. We aimed to 
investigate this association using Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses.
METHODS: We performed summary-data-based MR (SMR) using blood-derived expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and two sample-MR using single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) of antipsychotic drug target genes. Colocalization analysis 
was performed with cis-eQTLs, and sensitivity analyses included the 
Heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI) test and Multi-SNP-based SMR.
RESULTS: SMR showed that higher DRD4 expression was associated with lower lung 
cancer risk (PSMR = 0.009; PHEIDI >0.01; PSMR_multi = 0.0338). Two-sample MR 
further indicated inverse associations for KCNH2 (OR: 0.91; 95%CI: 0.83-0.99; 
P = 0.040) and DRD4 (OR: 0.89; 95%CI: 0.79-0.99; P = 0.040) with lung cancer 
risk. Additionally, elevated HTR6 and DRD4 expression was linked to decreased 
lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) risk (HTR6, OR: 0.89; 95%CI: 0.81-0.99; P = 0.014; 
DRD4, OR: 0.87; 95%CI: 0.76-0.98; P = 0.016). Colocalization analyses did not 
support shared causal variants (PP.H4 < 0.8).
CONCLUSION: These findings provide insights into the potential oncologic 
implications of antipsychotic drug use and may inform clinical management.

BACKGROUND: Third-generation EGFR-TKIs (TGETs) have demonstrated improved 
clinical outcomes compared to first-generation EGFR-TKIs (FGETs) in patients 
with EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nonetheless, the 
comparative safety and efficacy of TGETs as a first-line option for Asian 
patients with advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC remain unclear. This meta-analysis aims 
to compare the survival outcomes, response rates, and adverse events (AEs) of 
TGETs versus FGETs in this population.
METHODS: We systematically searched 6 databases for eligible phase 3 randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs). Eligible studies included those comparing TGETs with 
FGETs in previously untreated Asian patients with EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC. 
Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS), risk ratios (RRs) for response rates, and AEs were calculated and 
analyzed.
RESULTS: Seven phase 3 RCTs comprising 2434 Asian patients were included. TGETs 
significantly improved PFS (HR: 0.47 [0.42, 0.52], P < 0.00001) and central 
nervous system-PFS (HR: 0.57 [0.40, 0.80], P = 0.001) compared to FGETs. A trend 
toward improved OS was also observed with TGETs (HR: 0.88 [0.75, 1.03], 
P = 0.10). The advantages of PFS in the TGET group were confirmed in all 
subgroups. The objective response rate (ORR) (RR: 1.05 [1.01, 1.09], P = 0.03) 
and duration of response (DOR) (HR: 0.41 [0.34, 0.48], P < 0.00001) were also 
better in the TGET group. Total/grade 3-5 treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and 
Total/grade 3-5 treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were similar between the two 
groups. The top 3 TEAEs of TGET group were diarrhea (31.72%), rash (30.90%), and 
platelet count decreased (27.97%).
CONCLUSION: Compared with FGETs, TGETs significantly improve PFS, CNS control, 
response outcomes, and maintain a comparable safety profile for Asian patients 
with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC.

Finding effective drug combinations is a pivotal strategy for enhancing 
therapeutic efficacy and overcoming drug resistance in complex diseases like 
cancer. While computational methods have accelerated this discovery, most 
existing models are confined to predicting pairwise interactions, failing to 
capture the complex, higher-order synergies inherent in multi-drug regimens. To 
bridge this critical gap, we introduce an enhanced hypergraph random walk (EHRW) 
model uniquely designed to predict effective drug combinations. Our framework 
naturally represents multi-drug relationships using hypergraphs and leverages 
network topology to predict combination efficacy. Recognizing that network 
structure alone may not fully capture the intricate biological properties of 
drugs, we further propose a robust post-processing strategy that refines initial 
predictions by integrating auxiliary drug features. This method, which uses 
chemical similarity derived from SMILES fingerprints, serves as a powerful 
validation layer, significantly boosting the model's predictive accuracy. We 
demonstrate the superior performance of our enhanced EHRW model through rigorous 
validation on two major cancer datasets (lung and breast cancer). Our results 
show that the chemical similarity-based post-processing strategy outperforms the 
original model and several contemporary baselines. Importantly, our model 
extends beyond binary prediction by introducing a straightforward scoring method 
for three-drug combinations, which averages the predicted scores of their 
constituent binary pairs and provides a practical pathway for evaluating 
higher-order therapies. The enhanced EHRW model offers a flexible, accurate, and 
scalable computational tool, paving the way for more precise discovery of 
effective multi-drug regimens.

BACKGROUND: This study was designed to investigate the in vitro and in vivo 
killing effects of PD-1 antibody-secreting c-Met-targeted CAR-T cells on 
esophageal cancer cell line ECA109.
METHODS: We employed the TCGA and GTEx databases to analyze the expression 
levels of c-Met and PD-L1 in esophageal cancer tissues. Immunohistochemistry was 
employed to detect the expression of c-Met and PD-L1 in clinical esophageal 
cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Flow cytometry was employed to 
verify the expression of c-Met and PD-L1 in ECA109 cells. T cells from healthy 
volunteers were extracted and activated, and c-Met/PD-1 CAR-T cells were 
prepared utilizing lentivirus. Flow cytometry was employed to detect the 
positive rate, subtype, antibody secretion, and anti-apoptotic effects of 
c-Met/PD-1 CAR-T cells. The experimental group consisted of c-Met/PD-1 CAR-T 
cells, with c-Met CAR-T and CD19 CAR-T as control groups, and Active T cells as 
the blank control group. The proliferation, cytokine secretion, and killing 
ability of CAR-T cells co-cultured with ECA109 cells were assessed utilizing 
cell viability assays (CCK-8), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and 
lactate dehydrogenase release assays (LDH). In vivo experiments were conducted 
by subcutaneously injecting ECA109 cells into nude mice to establish 
tumor-bearing models. CAR-T cells were administered via in situ injection, and 
changes in body weight and tumor volume were measured. Hematoxylin and eosin 
(HE) staining was performed on heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney tissues 
from sacrificed mice.
RESULTS: c-Met and PD-L1 were highly expressed in esophageal cancer tissues but 
were low or not expressed in adjacent normal tissues. ECA109 cells expressed 
c-Met and PD-L1 on their surface. Successfully prepared c-Met/PD-1 CAR-T cells 
secreted PD-1 antibodies that blocked PD-1 on the surface of CAR-T cells. Under 
stimulation by c-Met antigens, c-Met/PD-1 CAR-T cells exhibited stronger 
proliferation, cytokine release, and killing ability. In vivo experiments 
demonstrated significant tumor inhibition in nude mice treated with c-Met/PD-1 
CAR-T cells without evident off-target effects.
CONCLUSION: The c-Met/PD-1 CAR-T cells were successfully constructed and 
demonstrated significant in vitro and in vivo killing effects on ECA109 
esophageal cancer cells.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of body mass index (BMI) on oncologic outcomes 
in patients with breast cancer stratified by menopausal status and histological 
subtype. Although studies have focused on the relationship between obesity and 
breast cancer risk, the association between BMI and breast cancer recurrence 
after surgery remains controversial.
METHODS: This retrospective study included patients who underwent curative 
surgery for breast cancer between June 2003 and November 2017. Normal weight and 
overweight groups were defined based on the World Health Organization 
classification. The primary outcome was recurrence-free survival, evaluated at 
1, 5, and 10 years after curative surgery. Patients were stratified by BMI 
category, histological subtype, and menopausal status. The main measures 
included tumor characteristics, recurrence events, and survival outcomes across 
groups.
RESULTS: Among 4506 patients included in the analysis, 3384 (75.1%) had 
luminal-type breast cancer. The overweight group (n = 1259) was associated with 
older age (normal weight (NW): 50.2 ±10.9 vs. overweight (OW): 56.5 ± 1.9, 
P < 0.001) and higher T stage (≥ T2: NW: 1226 (37.7%) vs. OW: 577 (45.8%), 
P < 0.001). In patients with luminal-type breast cancer, 10-year recurrence-free 
survival was significantly worse in the overweight group (NW 89.3% vs. OW 85.7%, 
P = 0.018). Subgroup analysis showed that premenopausal patients with 
luminal-type breast cancer who were overweight had an increased risk of 
recurrence (P = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is a significant, potentially modifiable risk factor for 
recurrence in premenopausal females with luminal-type breast cancer.

PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: In addition to diet quality, which influences the risk of 
colorectal cancer (CRC), temporal eating patterns, such as meal frequency, 
duration, regularity, and timing, may also play an important role. Recent 
studies have suggest that these eating patterns can influence CRC risk; however, 
dietary guidelines predominantly emphasise modifying the intake of specific food 
items to reduce risk and promote overall health. Additionally, comprehensive 
studies examining the relationship between temporal eating patterns and CRC risk 
are lacking. This review aimed to synthesise the available evidence on how 
temporal eating patterns may affect CRC risk and mortality. Following the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a 
systematic literature review was conducted using databases such as Medline, 
Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ProQuest, ultimately including 20 relevant 
articles.
RECENT FINDINGS: Higher eating frequency, particularly when involving unhealthy 
foods, along with skipping breakfast and increased snacking may elevate CRC 
risk. Furthermore, a short interval between the last meal and bedtime has been 
associated with an increased risk of CRC and related mortality. The findings 
suggest that a short interval between the last meal and bedtime may increase CRC 
risk, potentially through mechanisms such as circadian rhythm disruption, 
oxidative stress, and inflammation. In addtion, higher meal frequency, 
particularly when coupled with an unhealthy diet, appears to further elevate the 
risk. Future research should employ standardised definitions and detailed 
assessment of 24-hour eating patterns to better elucidate their relationship 
with CRC outcomes.

Up to 10% of patients with pancreatic cancer (PC) harbor a germline pathogenic 
variant (GPV) of the hereditary cancer-associated genes that lead to hereditary 
pancreatic cancer (HPC). These include BRCA1/2, which is responsible for 
hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC); mismatch repair genes (Lynch 
syndrome); STK11 (Peutz-Jeghers syndrome: PJS); PRSS1 (hereditary pancreatitis); 
and CDKN2A/p16 (familial atypical multiple mole melanoma: FAMMM). The majority 
of GPVs seen in PC patients are clinically actionable and associated with the 
dysfunction of homologous recombination (HR) (BRCA1/2 in approximately 5%) and 
mismatch repair (approximately 1%). In the era of cancer precision medicine 
(CPM), GPV can be detected via routine oncological practices, so clinicians must 
be literate in both oncology and genetic medicine. Today's clinical guidelines 
recommend/propose genetic testing for PC patients and the surveillance of the 
at-risk individual's pancreas and other associated organs. Pancreatic 
surveillance is recommended to be performed with endoscopic ultrasound and 
magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. This is also compatible with 
abdominal US and enhanced computed tomography, coupled with serum tests of 
pancreatic enzymes and tumor markers, at intervals of once every 6-12 months. A 
GPV of BRCA suggests the effectiveness of platinum agents and PARP inhibitors 
against PCs. The need for genetic counseling and testing is increasing to 
support at-risk individuals in making autonomous decisions based on sufficient 
information. As PC ranks as the second-most common target of CPM in Japan, we 
must treat these patients and manage at-risk individuals efficiently.

BACKGROUND: MRPL3, a member of the mitochondrial ribosomal family, is involved 
in the translation of mitochondria-related proteins. However, its role in tumors 
remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the oncogenic role and prognostic significance of MRPL3 
in cancer.
METHODS: We conducted a pan-cancer analysis of MRPL3 using various databases, 
bioinformatics and statistical tools, as well as tissue microarray analysis.
RESULTS: MRPL3 was generally upregulated in tumors compared to normal tissues. 
Its expression showed a negative correlation with immunogenic markers, immune 
cell infiltration, and immune checkpoint genes (ICGs) in most cancers, 
suggesting an immunosuppressive role in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Genes 
interacting with and similar to MRPL3 were involved in key signaling pathways 
across cancers. MRPL3 overexpression was frequently associated with poor 
prognosis and identified as an independent prognostic risk factor in KIRC, LUSC, 
LIHC, MESO, UCEC, and PAAD.
CONCLUSION: MRPL3 is overexpressed in multiple cancers and plays an 
immunosuppressive role, significantly correlating with poor prognosis, 
indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone malignancy with high metastatic 
potential and poor prognosis, primarily affecting children and adolescents. 
Although lysyl oxidase-like 4 (LOXL4) has been implicated in tumor progression, 
its functional role and mechanistic contributions in Osteosarcoma remain 
unclear.
METHODS: We performed integrated bioinformatics analysis using GTEx, TARGET, and 
TCGA datasets to evaluate LOXL4 expression and prognostic significance across 
cancers. Genetic alteration, immune infiltration, and RNA methylation analysis 
were carried to explore the different roles of LOXL4 in tumors. Functional 
assays, including Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation, and Matrigel 
transwell assays, were conducted in Osteosarcoma cell lines. Besides, western 
blotting and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were used to explore LOXL4's 
mechanistic roles.
RESULTS: LOXL4 was significantly upregulated in Osteosarcoma tissues and 
associated with poor patient survival. Pan-cancer analysis revealed LOXL4 is 
upregulated in multiple cancer types and exhibits tumor-type-specific genetic 
alteration patterns, most frequently mutated in melanoma and amplified in 
endometrial carcinoma. Besides, LOXL4 expression significantly correlated with 
immune infiltration levels, the expression of immune checkpoint molecules, and 
RNA methylation across multiple cancers. Functional experiments demonstrated 
that LOXL4 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation, invasion, and 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereas LOXL4 overexpression enhanced 
these malignant phenotypes. Mechanistically, LOXL4 activated the Wnt/β-catenin 
signaling pathway. Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling with XAV-939 reversed 
LOXL4-induced oncogenic effects.
CONCLUSION: LOXL4 promotes Osteosarcoma progression via Wnt/β-catenin-mediated 
EMT and cell proliferation. Its pan-overexpression and associations with the 
tumor immune microenvironment underscore its potential as a therapeutic target. 
Targeting LOXL4 or its downstream pathway may offer novel therapeutic strategies 
for Osteosarcoma.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer (LC) is the most prevalent form of malignant neoplasm 
globally, as well as the major cause of cancer-related death. Identifying 
effective pharmaceutical targets is paramount in advancing the development of 
treatment modalities for LC.
METHOD: Protein-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) was used in this study. The 
present study collated data on plasma proteins from a protein quantitative trait 
loci (pQTL) study with a total of 4907 individuals. Genetic associations with LC 
were obtained from GWAS, including 3791 cases and 489012 controls. Integration 
of pQTL and LC genome-wide association study (GWAS) data was employed to 
identify candidate proteins. MR used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as a 
genetic tool to estimate the causal effect of exposure on the outcome, while 
reverse Mendelian randomization was performed to assess the presence of false 
positives. The present study utilized these approaches to evaluate the causal 
relationship between plasma proteins and LC. Finally, protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) and functional enrichment analyses were performed to 
illustrate potential links between proteins and current LC drugs. Finally, drug 
prediction and molecular docking were performed to predict drugs and explored 
the expression distribution of key genes by single-cell sequencing.
RESULT: We identified 46 plasma proteins that are strongly associated with LC 
Fifteen of these proteins have protective effects. Among them, MMP8(OR = 0.87, 
95%CI:0.78-0.97, p = 0.013) had the most significant protective effect. In 
contrast, 31 proteins increased the risk of LC. IL36A༈OR = 1.20, 
95%CI:1.041-1.38, p = 0.012) exhibited the most significant MR result. Notably, 
COL2A1, MMP19 showed reverse causality. This was further verified by enrichment 
analysis, which confirmed the causal effect of these proteins. Additionally, the 
researchers utilized the DSigDB database to predict potentially effective 
intervening drugs, identifying nine possible candidates. Molecular docking 
showed that the drugs bind very much to the proteins. KDR and ANGPTL4 are 
abundantly expressed in lung tissue and are differentially expressed between 
cells.
CONCLUSION: The present study has revealed six potential drug targets for the 
treatment of LC. Drugs designed to target these proteins will be more likely to 
attain success in clinical trials and are expected to assist in the development 
of LC drugs and reduce drug development costs.

BACKGROUND: Immunophotothermal therapy (IPTT), combining immune checkpoint 
inhibitors and photothermal therapy, represents a promising synergistic 
anticancer strategy that enhances tumour-specific immunity alongside localised 
thermal ablation.
AIM: This review aims to summarise and critically analyse recent advancements in 
the development of photothermal agents for IPTT and their synergistic 
applications with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
METHODS: We focus specifically on the progress in innovative photothermal agent 
materials, the underlying mechanisms of immunophotothermal synergy, and the 
resulting antitumor efficacy evidenced by preclinical and clinical findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Furthermore, the key challenges hindering clinical translation and 
potential future directions are discussed. This comprehensive analysis 
highlights the current state and prospects of IPTT as an effective multimodal 
cancer treatment paradigm.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related 
death worldwide, with limited treatment options for patients with metastatic 
disease. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered natural killer (NK) cells 
represent a novel immunotherapeutic approach with potential advantages in safety 
and allogeneic applicability.
METHODS: This is a multi-arm phase I clinical trial (NCT05213195) evaluating the 
safety and feasibility of NKG2D-based CAR-NK cells expressing membrane-bound 
IL-15 (mbIL-15) in advanced CRC. Here, we report the results from the cohort 
expansion stage of this trial. Totally, six heavily pretreated patients were 
enrolled and received lymphodepletion chemotherapy followed by four infusions of 
CAR-NK cells in 2 weeks. Two cohorts were designed to assess extended infusion 
routes and combination with anti-PD-1 antibodies.
RESULTS: CAR-NK therapy was well tolerated, with no treatment-related death or 
serious non-hematologic toxicities. Common adverse events included reversible 
cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) and mild gastrointestinal symptoms. Notably, 
potential clinical benefits were observed in patients who received CAR-NK cells 
in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy, including one patient who achieved stable 
disease (SD) and two others who experienced prolonged overall survival exceeding 
700 days, suggesting a potential synergistic effect. Meanwhile, CAR-NK cells 
were detectable in peripheral blood within two weeks after infusion. And the 
combination with PD-1 blockade was associated with substantially increased peak 
CAR transgene levels compared to monotherapy (median CAR copies, 45,593 versus 
1001).
CONCLUSION: NKG2D CAR-NK cell therapy, alone or combined with PD-1 blockade, 
demonstrated a favorable safety profile and potential clinical benefit in 
advanced CRC, warranting further investigation in larger cohorts.

PURPOSE: While several countries reported an impact of the coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19) pandemic on cancer incidence in 2020, little is known about trends in 
the following years. This study examined changes in cancer incidence in 
Baden-Württemberg between 2015 and 2023.
METHODS: Data from the Baden-Württemberg Cancer Registry were used to calculate 
age-standardized and age-specific incidence rates for all cancers combined and 
for colorectal, lung, prostate, and breast cancer. Incidence rates for 2020 to 
2023 were compared with those from a pre-pandemic reference period (2017-2019) 
and with expected rates based on modeled trends between 2015 and 2019 using 
standardized incidence ratios (SIRs).
RESULTS: Among men, the age-standardized overall cancer incidence declined 
significantly from 734.0 per 100,000 in 2019 to 672.9-681.7 during 2020-2023. In 
women, incidence declined from 542.2 in 2019 to 504.3-524.4, with statistically 
significant reductions in 2022 and 2023. Compared to 2017-2019 levels, 14,214 
fewer cases (-5.5%) were diagnosed in 2020-2023; relative to model-based 
expectations, 19,525 fewer cases (-7.6%) were reported. Site-specific analyses 
showed significantly lower colorectal cancer incidence in both sexes from 2020 
onwards (SIRs: 0.81-0.90). For men, part of this decline may reflect a 
pre-existing downward trend. No significant deviations were found for lung and 
prostate cancer. Female breast cancer incidence was significantly lower only in 
2020 (SIR: 0.93).
CONCLUSION: Cancer incidence in Baden-Württemberg remained consistently below 
pre-pandemic and expected levels from 2020 through 2023. Further research is 
warranted to disentangle potential contributing factors, including post-pandemic 
effects, competing mortality risks, and migration-related population changes.

BACKGROUND: HER2-positive breast cancer is an aggressive molecular subtype 
characterized by high recurrence rates and poor prognosis. Identifying robust 
biomarkers for prognosis and therapeutic response is essential to improve 
individualized treatment strategies.
METHODS: Based on genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, summary data-based 
Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis was used to screen disease-related genes. 
The diagnostic model of HER2-positive breast cancer was constructed by combining 
LASSO, random forest and SVM-RFE and the characteristic genes were identified. 
The prognostic correlation was evaluated through Kaplan-Meier analysis. The SNP 
association, expression level, immune activity and drug sensitivity of ILF2 were 
analyzed emphatically. H&E staining and immunohistochemistry were used to verify 
the expression of ILF2 in tumor tissues.
RESULTS: A total of 14 genes associated with HER2-positive breast cancer were 
identified through SMR analysis, with the most significant SNPs enriched on 
chromosome 1. Integrating three machine learning algorithms (LASSO, Random 
Forest, and SVM-RFE), four robust diagnostic feature genes were identified: 
SLC16A3, ILF2, ARRDC3, and SNAPIN. Among them, ILF2 emerged as a key gene of 
interest. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that high expression of ILF2, 
NEK10, LAMTOR5, and APOBEC3A was significantly associated with poorer prognosis. 
The top ILF2-associated SNP (rs10908848) showed a strong negative regulatory 
effect on disease risk. Further functional analyses indicated that high ILF2 
expression was associated with suppressed antitumor immune activity and reduced 
sensitivity to multiple chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting its role in immune 
evasion and therapy resistance. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed 
significantly upregulated ILF2 protein expression in HER2-positive breast tumor 
tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues.
CONCLUSION: ILF2 is biologically and clinically important in HER2-positive 
breast cancer, and its high expression is linked with tumor immune escape and 
increased resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Future studies should further 
explore the mechanism and application of ILF2 as a potential therapeutic target.

PURPOSE: This study aims to explore the connection between rumination and 
posttraumatic growth (PTG) in cancer patients, while also investigating the 
underlying factors that may explain the mixed findings observed in prior 
research on this relationship.
METHODS: The PRISMA method for evidence synthesis was adopted in the study. 
Studies published from inception through August 2024 that reported a correlation 
between PTG and rumination (intrusive rumination and deliberate rumination) 
among people with cancer were identified through systematic searches in nine 
databases, including PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, etc. Stata 18.0 was used to 
analyze the overall effect size and conduct moderator analysis.
RESULTS: Thirty-five studies comprising 8, 398 people with cancer and 70 effect 
sizes were identified. There was no significant relationship between people with 
cancer's intrusive rumination and PTG, though factors like multiple cancers and 
disease stage played a notable role in influencing this relationship. A modest 
yet positive correlation emerged between deliberate rumination and PTG among 
those with cancer, with the stage of cancer acting as a key factor in shaping 
this association.
CONCLUSIONS: The study suggested that cancer patients with greater degrees of 
deliberate rumination have a higher likelihood of experiencing growth as a 
result of cancer. To determine whether the relationship between people with 
cancer's rumination and PTG changes causally over time, future longitudinal 
studies should be conducted.

Recently, many compounds of Cimicifuga sp. have been shown to exhibit 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic, anti-climacteric, antiviral, 
anti-tumor, and estrogenic properties. Some important phenylpropanoids 
identified from Cimicifuga sp. like cimicifugic acids and fukinolic acids have 
been shown to exhibit important biological activities like anti-inflammatory, 
anti-collagenase, antioxidant, antiviral, and anti-hyaluronidase activity in 
recent studies. Among these, cimicifugic acid B was found most active in terms 
of its cytotoxic and antiproliferative property. However, no individual study 
has been done regarding the anticancer potential of cimicifugic acid B till 
date. Owing to the traditional medicinal use of Cimicifuga rhizome in 
gynaecological problems of women, the aim of this study was to explore and 
delineate the potential of cimicifugic acid B against cervical cancer. Our 
findings demonstrated that cimicifugic acid B treatment drastically decreased 
the survival of HPV negative cervical cancer C33A cells evident by a 
dose-dependent increase in nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation. 
Cimicifugic acid B triggered ROS generation in a dose-dependent manner and also 
caused mitochondrial depolarization, which led to apoptosis. Moreover, 
Cimicifugic acid B was found to alter Bax/Bcl2 ratio, induce cell cycle arrest 
in G0/G1 phase, modulate the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins along 
with downregulation of Hedgehog pathway. As a result, our results showed the 
effectiveness of Cimicifugic acid B against cervical cancer cells, suggesting 
its potential as an adjuvant in the management of cervical cancer along with the 
current therapeutic regimen.

The limited immune response rate of conventional cancer monoimmunotherapy 
prompts the pursuit of new therapeutic modalities with improved antitumor 
efficacy. Here, we report a dual-immunomodulatory stapled peptide nanoassembly 
for amplified immunometabolic cancer therapy. This nanoprodrug platform features 
a biaryl-stapled proapoptotic peptide motif covalently conjugated to the 
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor NLG919 via an ester bond, enabling 
esterase-triggered payload release within the tumors. Upon activation, the 
stapled peptide potently induces immunogenic cell death (ICD), while NLG919 
selectively inhibits IDO, thereby reversing kynurenine-mediated 
immunosuppression. Notably, the stapled peptide nanoprodrug achieves prolonged 
local drug exposure by leveraging the enhanced proteolytic stability and 
cellular association conferred by the biaryl-stapling architecture. In vivo 
studies demonstrate that this dual-immunomodulatory strategy significantly 
improves the efficacy of immunotherapy when combined with PD-L1 blockade. This 
work paves the way to advance the development of stapled peptide-based 
nanoplatforms as next-generation cancer immunotherapies.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent and aggressive malignancy 
within head and neck cancers, often associated with risk factors such as tobacco 
use, alcohol consumption, and HPV infection. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small 
non-coding RNAs that inhibit target genes, are a promising new focus as 
biomarkers or therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. miR-155 has emerged as a 
significant regulator in various cancers, including OSCC, where its altered 
expression is linked to tumor initiation, progression, and resistance to 
treatment. miR-155 is a well-studied miRNA that has an oncogenic role in several 
solid tumors, including oral cancer. Studies suggest that miR-155 modulates key 
cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and immune response, making 
it a promising biomarker and potential therapeutic target. Investigating the 
mechanisms through which miR-155 drives OSCC progression could pave the way for 
enhanced diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, addressing essential needs in 
managing this aggressive cancer type. The present paper highlights the oncogenic 
role of miR-155 in oral cancers, summarizing recent advancements in 
therapeutically targeting this transcript, including preclinical testing of 
miR-155 inhibitors. This approach offers a promising new avenue for treating 
drug-resistant oral cancer.

PURPOSE: In 2021, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force lowered the 
recommended start age for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening to 45 years. In this 
study, we examined sociodemographic and health-related factors associated with 
U.S. adults being told about different CRC screening tests by health 
professionals.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, secondary analysis of the 2022 Health 
Information National Trends Survey. The main outcome was, ""Has a doctor or other 
health professional ever told you there are a few different tests to detect 
colorectal cancer?"" We compared ""yes"" responses (n = 1945) to ""no"" or ""never"" 
discussed responses combined (n = 878).
RESULTS: In the multivariable logistic regression model, adults aged 45-49 years 
and females had lower odds of being told about CRC screening tests compared to 
adults aged 50-75 years and males, respectively. Conversely, participants in 
excellent/very good health compared to those in fair/poor health, those with a 
history of diabetes compared to no diabetes, and those with higher household 
income ranges compared with 0 to $19,999 had higher odds of being told about CRC 
screening tests.
CONCLUSION: Increasing CRC screening test awareness, particularly among females 
and adults aged 45 to 49, may strengthen patient-clinician communication and 
promote earlier CRC detection.

BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health 
concern, contributing to both hepatic and extrahepatic complications, including 
cancer. While its association with liver cancer is well established, the role of 
HBV in extrahepatic malignancies remains less clear. This study aimed to 
investigate the potential causal relationship between chronic HBV infection and 
common extrahepatic cancers.
METHODS: We applied Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) data to assess causal links between chronic HBV 
infection and extrahepatic cancer risk. Transcriptomic data from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were analyzed to identify 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and explore potential mechanisms.
RESULTS: MR analysis revealed a significant causal association between chronic 
HBV infection and increased risks of breast and lung cancers. Key DEGs, 
including SPP1 and PDK4, were identified, implicating molecular pathways 
involved in tumor progression.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate a modest but significant link between chronic 
HBV infection and elevated extrahepatic cancer risk, highlighting potential 
therapeutic targets for HBV-infected individuals. These results support the need 
for personalized monitoring and treatment strategies in precision oncology.

BACKGROUND: The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has significantly 
advanced cancer therapy, improving survival rates and prognosis for many 
patients. This study employs bibliometric methods to explore the current state 
and future trends in the field of immunosuppressants and cancer treatment.
METHODS: Data were retrieved from the Science Citation Index Expanded for 
articles and reviews published between 2014 and 2024 in the Web of Science 
database. 2,352 records were analyzed using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, R software, 
and Microsoft Excel. The focus was on publication trends, citations, co-citation 
networks, keyword co-occurrence, and collaborative networks.
RESULTS: The study identified a steady increase in publications and citations, 
with an average annual growth rate of 3.93%. The United States and China were 
the leading countries in research output, while the University of Texas MD 
Anderson Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School were key institutions. 
Research hotspots included ICIs, tumor microenvironment, and immune-related 
adverse events. Interdisciplinary collaboration was highlighted as crucial for 
advancing the field.
CONCLUSIONS: The growing body of research on cancer and immunosuppressants 
highlights the need for optimizing immunotherapy protocols, managing drug 
resistance, and exploring the potential of immunosuppressants in cancer 
treatment. Strengthening international collaboration is vital for translating 
research findings into clinical practice and improving patient outcomes. Despite 
the comprehensive analysis, the study's reliance on the WoSCC database and 
English-language publications may limit the generalizability of findings.

BACKGROUND: Although allergic predisposition may modulate antitumor immunity, 
its influence on immune checkpoint blockade remains unclear. We investigated 
whether a documented drug allergy history affects the outcomes of PD-(L)1 
inhibitors in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 246 patients with stage III-IV NSCLC 
treated with PD-(L)1 inhibitors at West China Hospital from October 2019 to 
October 2024, with follow-up through May 2025. Patients were grouped according 
to drug allergy history. Baseline imbalances were corrected using 1:2 propensity 
score matching (caliper 0.2) and inverse probability of treatment weighting. The 
primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints 
included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and 
immune-related adverse events (irAEs).
RESULTS: Before adjustment, allergy-positive patients (n = 49) showed higher 
1-year PFS than controls (54.4% vs. 35.7%, p = 0.019). After matching, median 
PFS remained longer (13.6 vs. 6.6 months; hazard ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.91, 
p = 0.017), and 1-year PFS improved (57.0% vs. 33.4%, p = 0.009), whereas 3-year 
PFS, OS, and ORR were comparable. Weighted analyses and multiple sensitivity 
tests corroborated these findings. Overall incidences of Grade ≥ 2 or ≥ 3 irAEs 
were similar; although Grade ≥ 2 gastrointestinal irAEs trended higher in the 
allergy cohort (6.1% vs. 1.0%, p = 0.054).
CONCLUSIONS: A history of drug allergy predicts early clinical benefits, 
particularly superior 1-year PFS, from PD-(L)1 blockade in advanced NSCLC 
without increasing severe irAEs. Prospective multicenter studies are needed to 
confirm these findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

PURPOSE: We report long-term survival and comprehensive molecular biomarker 
analyses of a phase II trial evaluating the combination of cetuximab and 
nivolumab in R/M HNSCC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The long-term follow up data were obtained from a phase II 
trial (NCT03370276). Archived tumors and serially collected plasma cell-free DNA 
were characterized by comprehensive genomic analyses. Immune markers were 
measured in tumor core and margins by multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC).
RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 47.4 months, median overall survival (OS) and 
2-year OS rate were 12.7 months and 32% in all evaluable patients (n=88) and 
17.5 months and 35% in patients who had no prior therapy for R/M HNSCC (n=43), 
respectively. The survival efficacy was similar between patients with 
p16-negative and p16-positive tumors, but the response rate was significantly 
higher in patients with p16-negative tumors. The clonal tumor mutation burden, 
hypoxia score, and EGFR pathway score were significantly higher in p16-negative 
compared to p16-positive tumors. Loss of heterozygosity of MHC-I was 
significantly more frequent in non-responders, and APOBEC-associated mutagenesis 
was elevated in responders. Gene expression profiling and mIHC analyses revealed 
a more inflamed tumor microenvironment in responders regardless of the p16 
status.
CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term follow-up study indicates that the combination of 
cetuximab and nivolumab is efficacious and tolerable, and that p16-negative R/M 
HNSCC patients may have greater benefit from this combination.

The FAT atypical cadherin (FAT) gene family comprises FAT atypical cadherin 1 
(FAT1), 2 (FAT2), 3 (FAT3), and 4 (FAT4). These transmembrane adhesion proteins 
are essential for regulating cell polarity, adhesion, and migration, and are 
involved in multiple signaling transduction pathways. With the advancement of 
tumor genomics research, the mutation, expression, and functional regulation of 
FAT in various cancer types have been elucidated, particularly in non-small cell 
lung cancer, where FAT has significant biological implications and promising 
clinical applications. FAT1, a frequently mutated member of the family, 
participates in remodeling the immune microenvironment via the Wnt/β-catenin, 
Hippo, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) pathways. It also influences 
immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint expression, and tumor mutational 
burden, thereby affecting the efficacy of immunotherapy. FAT2 influences cell 
migration and immune response by modulating cytoskeletal dynamics and the 
expression of immunochemokines. The non-coding RNA circular RNA FAT3 (circFAT3) 
may contribute to tumor growth and metastasis. FAT4, a major upstream regulator 
of the Hippo signaling pathway, inhibits Yes-associated protein/transcriptional 
coactivator with PDZ-binding motif, maintains cell polarity, and plays multiple 
roles by regulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and 
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/ protein kinase B (AKT) pathways and promoting 
anti-immune escape. This study comprehensively integrated and analyzed research 
results on the characteristics of the FAT gene family in lung cancer, focusing 
on its mutations, signaling pathways, and immunological roles, as well as its 
clinical significance in terms of prognosis. This study provides theoretical 
support and references for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND: The role of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) remains unclear in 
hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, particularly in 
young patients, whose immune microenvironment could be altered by age-related 
host and tumor differences.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage I-III HR-positive/HER2-negative tumors 
were identified from a prospective cohort study of breast cancer patients 
diagnosed at age ≤ 40 years. Multiplexed immunofluorescence and semiautomated 
quantitative software measured cytotoxic T, non-CD8 T, T regulatory, exhausted 
T, and PDL1+ cells in stroma and tumor. Univariate analyses assessed differences 
in clinicopathologic characteristics by high versus low immune infiltration, 
divided based on median. TIL subtypes were evaluated as a continuous variable 
per 10% increase in Cox regression analyses for invasive breast cancer-free 
survival (iBCFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and overall survival 
(OS), adjusted for clinicopathologic parameters.
RESULTS: Among 390 patients, high immune infiltration was associated with 
increasing age, Black race, grade 3 tumors, and metaplastic or micropapillary 
histological subtypes. Over a median follow-up of 8 years, higher stromal and 
intratumoral non-CD8 T cell infiltration, T regulatory cell infiltration, and 
PDL1 expression was associated with improved iBCFS. Higher intratumoral non-CD8 
T cell infiltration, T regulatory cell infiltration, and PDL1 expression was 
associated with improved DDFS; higher stromal PDL1 expression was also 
associated with improved DDFS. Higher intratumoral cytotoxic T cell infiltration 
and PDL1 expression was associated with improved OS.
CONCLUSIONS: Characterization of immune subpopulations could help refine the 
prognostic value of TILs in young patients with HR-positive breast cancer, who 
may benefit from risk stratification for treatment individualization.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal malignancies. 
Although surgical resection is the only potentially curative option, recurrence 
from microscopic residual disease develops in more than half of these patients, 
underscoring the importance of adjuvant chemotherapy. Over the past two decades, 
multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that adjuvant 
chemotherapy can improve the disease-free and overall survival of patients with 
resected PDAC significantly. Although S-1 monotherapy became the standard of 
care in Japan following the JASPAC-01 trial, gemcitabine-based regimens are 
still used widely in Western countries. This review provides an overview of key 
clinical trials supporting adjuvant chemotherapy, including an introduction of 
the 2022 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pancreatic Cancer in Japan and the 
current NCCN Guidelines for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma. We also discuss some of 
the problems that remain unresolved, such as for how long and when adjuvant 
therapy should be given. Moreover, there is still insufficient evidence for 
certain subgroups of patients, such as those with borderline resectable or 
initially unresectable PDAC. Thus, new treatments, such as immune checkpoint 
inhibitors, may be useful in future. More clinical studies are needed to 
establish the most appropriate regimens, as adjuvant chemotherapy should be 
selected based on patient age, tumor stage, and prior treatment.

OBJECTIVES: Annual whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is recommended for early cancer 
detection in individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). However, there is no 
agreement on a standardized MRI protocol. This study evaluated the diagnostic 
performance of different MRI sequences to suggest an optimized protocol for LFS 
surveillance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective bicentric study, 113 participants 
with LFS underwent annual WB-MRI and were included in the analysis. The protocol 
comprised turbo-spin echo (TSE) T1-weighted and inversion-recovery T2-weighted 
(TIRM) images of the whole body in coronal orientation, and T2-weighted (HASTE), 
diffusion-weighted (DWI), and T1-weighted DIXON images (pre- and post-contrast 
agent administration) from head to thighs in axial orientation. An additional 
fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence imaged the skull only. 
Initial clinical interpretation was conducted by staff radiologists. The 
visibility of reported mass lesions was independently graded in all sequences by 
three experienced radiologists using a Likert scale. Sequence combinations were 
compared to inform the design of an optimal MRI protocol.
RESULTS: Over 30 months, 189 WB-MRI examinations were performed in 113 
participants (mean age 40 years, ±12.7 years [standard deviation], 91 women). 
188 mass lesions were detected and confirmed as malignant (n = 38), benign 
(n = 120) or ambiguous (n = 30). In the multi-reader analysis, all new malignant 
lesions could have been detected by a combination of cranial FLAIR, whole-body 
DWI, and whole-body HASTE in the axial direction.
CONCLUSION: A shortened, contrast-agent-free WB-MRI protocol combining cranial 
FLAIR, WB-HASTE, and WB-DWI promises to be an effective and patient-friendly 
approach for annual cancer surveillance in LFS.
KEY POINTS: Question Annual whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is recommended for early 
cancer detection for individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), but a 
standardized sequence protocol has yet to be established. Findings The 
combination of cranial FLAIR, whole-body HASTE, and whole-body DWI in the axial 
plane enabled visualization of all newly developed malignant lesions in our 
study cohort. Clinical relevance A shortened, standardized WB-MRI protocol 
enables efficient, sensitive early cancer detection in individuals with LFS, 
minimizing patient burden by reducing examination time and contrast agent use. 
This approach may improve surveillance participation while enhancing 
comparability across centers.

PURPOSE: The increasing use of Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) raises concerns 
regarding radiation exposure and its associated cancer risks. This study aims to 
evaluate the effectiveness of the Siemens CARE kV algorithm in reducing 
radiation doses and cancer incidence risk compared to the Automatic Exposure 
Control (AEC) algorithm in adult patients undergoing CCTA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study involved a cohort of 101 
patients, comprising 55 women and 46 men, who underwent Siemens single-source 
1 × 64-slice Multi-Detector CT (Somatom Definition AS) for CCTA. Demographic 
data and radiation dose parameters, including Computed Tomography Dose Index 
(CTDIvol) and Dose-Length Product (DLP) were recorded. Effective and organ doses 
were calculated using ImPACT software, and Lifetime Attributable Risk (LAR) was 
estimated based on BEIR VII data.
RESULTS: The Effective Doses (EDs) for AEC and CARE kV algorithms were 
9.59 ± 3.84 mSv and 8.04 ± 3.99 mSv, respectively. The cancer incidence risk was 
significantly lower for the CARE kV algorithm, with LAR estimates of 7.27 ± 4.01 
per 100,000 populations compared to 13.88 ± 10.76 for AEC. The CARE kV algorithm 
demonstrated a 27.07% reduction in LAR.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the CARE kV algorithm provides a 
significant reduction in radiation exposure and associated cancer risks compared 
to the AEC algorithm. These results support the optimization of CT protocols to 
enhance patient safety while maintaining diagnostic efficacy.

Plain Language Summary: The study compares CARE kV and AEC dose reduction modes 
for CCTA patients.Statistically significant differences were found in radiation 
doses between two algorithms.CARE kV shows a 27.07% reduction in Lifetime 
Attributable Risk (LAR) vs. AEC.Effective doses were significantly lower with 
the CARE kV option.Findings support optimizing CT protocols to balance diagnosis 
and patient safety.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal neoplasia contributes substantially to morbidity and 
mortality worldwide. While fecal immunochemical test (FIT) has been adopted as a 
screening method, its limitations (suboptimal adherence to follow-up colonoscopy 
among FIT-positive population and missed diagnosis in FIT-negative population) 
hamper its effectiveness in reducing colorectal cancer (CRC). To address these 
issues, a combination of FIT with circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration for 
colorectal neoplasia prediction and CRC risk evaluation was proposed.
METHODS: Participants (n=113) underwent FIT, colonoscopy examination, and CTC 
enumeration. For the latter, CD45neg EpCAMpos CTC and CD45neg EpCAMneg cell 
counts were assayed. For statistical analysis, multivariable logistic regression 
and area under the ROC curve (AUROC) analysis were used.
RESULTS: For colorectal neoplasia prediction, a better performance (AUROC 
0.8371) was achieved when the variables (FIT results and CTC enumeration) were 
combined, which was significantly improved compared to that of the FIT 
result-only model (AUROC 0.7555). For its further use for CRC risk assessment, 
among FIT-positive individuals, those with either ≥5 CD45negEpCAMpos CTCs or 
≥300 CD45negEpCAMneg cells had significantly increased CRC risk. For the 
FIT-negative population, 80% of the FIT-negative CRC cases in this study could 
be detected if the thresholds were set at ≥2 CD45negEpCAMpos CTCs and ≥500 
CD45negEpCAMneg cells. Its application could thus rescue missed diagnoses due to 
false-negative FIT results.
CONCLUSIONS: The method was able to enhance the prediction of colorectal 
neoplasia. The assessment of CRC risk was also successfully demonstrated.
IMPACT: The method is promising as a supportive method tackling the problems 
encountered in current FIT-based screening.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer survivors (BCSs) are at increased risk of late 
effects. While research has reported positive effects of exercise therapy on 
fatigue and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among short-term BCSs, 
evidence in long-term survivors remains scarce.
METHODS: The CAUSE (CArdiovascUlar Survivors Exercise) trial was a two-armed 
randomized controlled trial. Long-term BCSs were assigned to five months of 
thrice-weekly supervised aerobic exercise or usual care. Late effects and HRQoL 
were assessed by Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire, European Organization for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-BR23 and QLQ-C30 questionnaires, and Scale 
for Chemotherapy-Induced Long-term Neurotoxicity at baseline (T0), 
post-intervention (T1) and one-year follow-up (T2).
RESULTS: In total, 140 BCSs (mean age 59.0 ± 6.4 years, 11 ± 1 years 
post-treatment) were included. Loss to follow-up at T1 was 6% and 19% in the 
exercise- and usual care group, respectively. From T0 to T1, the exercise group 
significantly improved total fatigue (between groups mean difference (MD) -3.0, 
p < .001), body image (MD 6.7, p = .043), physical- (MD 3.2, p = <0.001), role- 
(MD 9.6, p = .019), and cognitive function (MD 3.4, p = .038), insomnia (MD 
-9.0, p = .017), and global health/QoL (MD 5.3, p = <0.001) compared to usual 
care. The exercise benefits were more pronounced in BCSs experiencing versus not 
experiencing late effects at baseline. At one-year follow-up, most improvements 
regressed toward baseline values.
CONCLUSION: Aerobic exercise significantly improves fatigue, body image, 
physical-, role-, and cognitive function, insomnia, and HRQoL in long-term BCSs. 
These findings suggest that exercise therapy should be a core component of 
managing late effects and enhancing HRQoL in long-term BCSs.

BACKGROUND: Evidence comparing patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL) 
pre- and post-breast cancer diagnosis, and factors influencing these 
trajectories, is limited due to unpredictable onset. We analyzed predictors of 
HRQOL change in elderly breast cancer patients across two transitions: pre- to 
post-diagnosis, and at diagnosis versus two years later.
METHODS: Using SEER-MHOS linkage, we analyzed breast cancer patients >65 years 
who completed two HRQOL surveys. Two cohorts were examined: patients with 
surveys pre- and within one-year post-diagnosis (cohort 1) and those with 
surveys within one year of diagnosis and two years post-diagnosis (cohort 2). 
Bayesian regression identified predictors of physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) 
score changes.
RESULTS: In cohort 1 (n=1,546), advanced stage was associated with greater HRQOL 
decline, with mean PCS changes ranging from -2.1 to -6.5 and MCS from -2.0 to 
-5.1. Baseline activities of daily living (ADL) limitations were associated with 
mean PCS declines ranging from -2.0 to -2.6 and mean MCS decline of -2.0. Better 
baseline health perception was protective with mean PCS increases ranging from 
+1.4 to +3.4. In cohort 2 (n=891), baseline ADL limitations were associated with 
mean PCS declines ranging from -1.6 to -5.5 and mean MCS decline of -2.5, while 
poor health perception was associated with mean PCS decline of -3.2. Excellent 
health perception was protective (mean MCS:+4.1). Surgery, chemotherapy, and 
radiation had no HRQOL impact.
CONCLUSION: Baseline health perception and ADL limitations are critical 
determinants of HRQOL trajectories, outweighing treatments.
IMPACT: Early intervention strategies based on baseline assessments may improve 
survivorship.

BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue is a common and significant symptom 
experienced by patients with cancer and survivors across all age groups, 
profoundly impacting their quality of life. Adolescents and young adults often 
encounter substantial academic, career, and personal demands, which pose unique 
challenges in managing this symptom and may have a more profound overall impact 
on their lives. While digital health interventions show considerable promise in 
managing cancer-related fatigue, few reviews have specifically addressed their 
use among adolescents and young adults.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to identify and assess the types and 
effectiveness of digital health interventions in managing cancer-related fatigue 
among adolescents and young adults.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the keywords 
""digital health,"" ""adolescent,"" ""young adult,"" ""fatigue,"" and ""neoplasms"" across 
6 databases: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of 
Science. The search included English-language publications from the inception of 
each database to August 2024. Two researchers independently screened the studies 
based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria.
RESULTS: A total of 2965 articles were retrieved during the initial search, of 
which 10 (0.34%) satisfied the inclusion criteria of this review. The 10 
included studies comprised 5 (50%) randomized controlled trials, 2 (20%) 
quasi-experimental studies, 2 (20%) mixed methods studies, and 1 (10%) cohort 
study. On the basis of the functions and forms of digital health interventions, 
the interventions included in this review were categorized into the following 5 
types: dynamic health monitoring and feedback, automated online guidance and 
feedback, live remote coaching and instruction, gamified interventions, and 
robot-assisted interventions. Multiple studies (7/10, 70%) demonstrated that 
digital health interventions are effective in reducing cancer-related fatigue in 
adolescents and young adults and show potential in improving physical function 
and emotional well-being in this population.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital health interventions overcome the time and spatial 
limitations of traditional treatments and provide holistic support across 
physical, psychological, and social domains. They hold significant potential to 
alleviate cancer-related fatigue in adolescents and young adults. Future 
research should integrate various fatigue measurement scales and conduct 
large-scale studies and long-term follow-ups to capture a more comprehensive 
range of fatigue experiences, validate these findings, and enhance the 
effectiveness of digital health interventions.

BACKGROUND: Kidney cancer remains a significant challenge in oncology, with 
accurate prognostic assessment being crucial for postoperative management. While 
radiomics has shown promise in cancer prognosis, there is limited research on 
comprehensive models that effectively integrate radiomic features with clinical 
parameters for kidney cancer survival prediction.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate a comprehensive computed 
tomography (CT) radiomics-based nomogram for predicting overall survival in 
postoperative patients with kidney cancer by integrating radiomic features with 
clinical parameters.
METHODS: Radiomic features were extracted from regions of interest in CT images 
of 207 postoperative patients with kidney cancer. The eigenvalue data of all 
radiomic features were processed using z score standardization and the R 
software package GLMNet. We integrated survival time, survival status, and 
radiomic features and screened these features using the least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator-Cox regression method. We conducted 10-fold 
cross-validation to obtain an optimal model of 5 radiomic features. Multivariate 
Cox regression hazard models were established to analyze patients' overall 
survival. The predictive ability of the nomogram (receiver operating 
characteristic curve and calibration curve) was evaluated using bootstrap 
resampling validation. Patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups 
based on the radiomic risk score cutoff value, and the Kaplan-Meier method was 
conducted to identify established models' forecasting ability. Five radiomic 
features were screened for predictive model construction.
RESULTS: This retrospective analysis was conducted from April 2024 to July 2024 
using data from The Cancer Imaging Archive public database. The final cohort 
included 207 patients (3 excluded from the initial 210) who underwent 
nephrectomy for kidney cancer. The median follow-up time was 33 (IQR 11-47) 
months. The receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve 
showed that the predictive model performed well. The calibration curve of 
nomogram and radiomic features in the cohort study set indicated an overall net 
benefit. Kaplan-Meier curves indicated that overall survival time was 
dramatically shorter in the high-risk group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our radiomics nomogram successfully integrates CT-derived radiomic 
features with clinical variables for kidney cancer survival prediction, 
demonstrating good prognostic capability and offering a noninvasive, 
quantitative tool for personalized postoperative management and clinical 
decision-making.

INTRODUCTION: Anemia presents a significant challenge in gastrointestinal cancer 
patients undergoing chemotherapy, adversely affecting qualityof life and 
treatment continuity. Conventional treatments such as red bloodcell 
transfusions, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and oral iron have limitations, 
including thrombosis risk, supply constraints,and poor tolerability.
AREAS COVERED:  Ferriccarboxymaltose (FCM) IFON_A_2569574 forcontrolled uptake, 
enabling safe administration of large doses. Thisprospective multicenter study 
evaluates FCM for managing iron deficiency anemiain patients with unresectable 
or recurrent gastric or colorectal cancerreceiving chemotherapy. The protocol 
involves administering 1500 mg of FCM inthree 500 mg doses, each given at least 
7 days apart and all within 29 daysfrom the first dose (Day 1). The primary 
endpoint is the rate of hemoglobinimprovement at 8 weeks. A sample size of 50 
patients was calculated to detect a33% improvement rate against a 15% threshold 
with 80% power.Secondary endpoints include hemoglobin improvement rates at 4 and 
12 weeks, andQoL assessment at 4, 8, and 12 weeks.
EXPERT OPINION/COMMENTARY:  We anticipate thatour findings will support anemia 
management in this patient population.
CLINICALTRIAL REGISTRATION: jRCTs051240288.

Plain Language Summary: Many people with gastric or colorectal cancer who 
receive chemotherapy develop a condition called iron deficiency anemia (IDA). 
This can cause fatigue and affect their quality of life and ability to continue 
treatment. Existing treatments such as blood transfusions, 
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and iron pills have limitations. This study 
investigates whether a newer type of intravenous iron, called ferric 
carboxymaltose (FCM), can effectively and safely treat IDA in these patients. We 
are enrolling approximately 50 patients with advanced gastric or colorectal 
cancer with IDA while receiving chemotherapy. Participants will receive FCM 
intravenously. A total dose of 1500 mg of FCM will be administered as three 
separate doses of 500 mg each. Each dose must be given at intervals of at least 
7 days, and all three doses must be completed by Day 29, considering the day of 
first administration as Day 1. The main goal is to evaluate the extent of 
improvement in anemia after 8 weeks without the need for a blood transfusion. We 
will also evaluate changes in their quality of life using standardized 
questionnaires for people with advanced gastric or colorectal cancer.

Cancer cells can acquire a reversible, dormant drug-tolerant persister state 
mimicking embryonic diapause to evade therapy pressure. Deciphering the precise 
mechanisms driving cancer cells into or out of a diapause-like persister 
cell-state could provide strategies to overcome resistance. Here, we showed that 
following chemotherapy, diverse therapeutic agents converge on WNT pathway 
activation to induce a de novo diapause-like cell state across various 
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, xenograft, and patient-derived 
organoid models. Among early persister cells, only transcriptionally WNT-active 
persisters exhibited the transcriptional and functional characteristics typical 
of diapause-like cells, including a negative correlation with MYC 
transcriptional activity and reversible restricted proliferation. The WNT 
signaling pathway functioned as both an inducer and biomarker of the 
diapause-like early persister cell state in both parental (chemo-naïve) and 
chemotherapy-treated cells. Entry into and exit from the diapause-like early 
persister cell state was triggered by the transcriptional upregulation of 
components essential for canonical WNT ligand secretion. A combinatorial 
treatment strategy inhibiting WNT ligand secretion alongside chemotherapy 
effectively targeted the early mechanisms underlying the acquisition and 
enrichment of a diapause-like cell phenotype. These findings reveal WNT pathway 
activation as an early event that leads to a reversible diapause-like persister 
state and highlight the potential of targeting this axis to prevent the 
development of drug-resistant populations before they are firmly established.

Background Data on the impact of preoperative MRI on long-term outcomes in young 
patients with breast cancer are insufficient. Purpose To investigate the 
associations of preoperative MRI with recurrence and survival outcomes in 
patients 50 years or younger with newly diagnosed breast cancer, and the impact 
of hormone receptor status on these associations. Materials and Methods This 
retrospective study included patients aged 50 years or younger with newly 
diagnosed unilateral breast cancer who underwent surgery at one of two tertiary 
hospitals between January 2011 and December 2017. Patients who underwent 
preoperative MRI (MRI group) were balanced with patients who did not (no-MRI 
group) using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Recurrence and 
death were compared between the MRI and no-MRI groups using hazard ratios (HRs) 
with 95% CIs. P values were obtained using Fine and Gray models for recurrence 
and Cox proportional hazards models for death, both adjusted with IPTW. Patients 
were followed up for a median of 7.7 years. Results Of the 4414 women included 
(mean age, 43.2 years ± 5.2 [SD]), 4118 (93.3%) underwent preoperative MRI, and 
296 (6.7%) did not. A total of 342 patients (7.7%) experienced recurrence. The 
5-year cumulative incidence of ipsilateral in-breast recurrence was lower in the 
MRI group than in the no-MRI group (1.6% vs 3.3%; subdistribution hazard ratio 
[sHR], 0.49; P = .04). However, there was no evidence of a difference in total 
recurrence between the MRI and no-MRI groups (sHR, 0.70 [95% CI: 0.43, 1.13]; P 
= .15). In patients with hormone receptor-negative cancer, the 5-year cumulative 
incidence of recurrence was lower in the MRI group than the no-MRI group (8.2% 
vs 20.7%; sHR, 0.40 [95% CI: 0.19, 0.82]; P = .04), as was the incidence of 
ipsilateral in-breast recurrence (sHR, 0.28 [95% CI: 0.10, 0.76]). There was no 
evidence of a difference in overall survival (HR, 0.62 [95% CI: 0.26, 1.50]; P = 
.58). Conclusion Preoperative MRI was associated with reduced risk of 
ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence in patients 50 years or younger, with the 
greatest benefit in those with hormone receptor-negative cancers. © RSNA, 2025

Background Lung cancer screening with low-dose CT (LDCT) primarily relies on 
identifying nodules, disregarding global lung features, and may underestimate 
long-term cancer risk. Purpose To determine whether considering global lung 
features alongside nodules could improve long-term lung cancer risk prediction. 
Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, ScreenLungNet, a 3-year lung 
cancer risk prediction model, was developed using LDCT data from the Wenling 
2019-2020 screening cohort (Zhejiang Province, China) and clinical CT data from 
Zhejiang Cancer Hospital (2017-2023). Features from multiple nodules derived 
from malignancy scores and global lung features were extracted via a vision 
transformer and integrated into the model. To assess the added value of global 
lung features, single-nodule (based on the highest-risk nodule), multiple-nodule 
(based on multiple-nodule features), and global (based on global lung features) 
lung models were constructed for comparison. Model performance was assessed with 
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, 
specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative 
predictive value (NPV). Results Model training included 19 869 participants from 
the Wenling 2019-2020 screening cohort (mean age, 60.93 years ± 6.30 [SD]; 
13 123 male; 343 patients with lung cancer) and 1802 patients from Zhejiang 
Cancer Hospital. Finally, independent internal and external tests were conducted 
on the Wenling 2021 (n = 9932) and National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) (n = 
14 966) cohorts, respectively. ScreenLungNet outperformed other models for 
3-year lung cancer risk prediction (AUC range, 0.93-0.94; P < .001). In the NLST 
cohort, ScreenLungNet performed well (AUC, 0.93 [95% CI: 0.92, 0.94]; accuracy, 
94.8%; sensitivity, 84.9%; specificity, 95.2%; PPV, 44.0%; NPV, 99.3%; all P < 
.02). Its performance remained strong in the NLST baseline-negative subset (AUC, 
0.87; accuracy, 97.0%; sensitivity, 72.1%; specificity, 97.5%). Conclusion A 
model integrating multiple nodules and global lung features outperformed 
nodule-only models for long-term lung cancer risk prediction and enabled risk 
prediction in screening-negative participants. © The Author(s) 2025. Published

Physical activity plays a crucial role in cancer prevention and management, 
reducing the risk of colorectal, breast, lung, bladder, and gastric cancers by 
10-20%. In patients with cancer, regular exercise not only alleviates 
treatment-related side effects such as fatigue, nausea, and muscle loss but also 
enhances overall survival, with studies showing a 40-50% reduction in 
cancer-specific mortality, particularly in breast, colorectal, and prostate 
cancers. These benefits are achieved through multiple biological mechanisms. 
Exercise modulates inflammation by reducing proinflammatory cytokines and 
inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B signaling, enhances antitumor immunity via 
activation of natural killer cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and improves 
metabolic regulation by increasing insulin sensitivity and lowering circulating 
insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels. It also inhibits key oncogenic 
pathways, such as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian 
target of rapamycin axis, which is crucial for tumor growth and survival. 
Additionally, exercise supports genomic stability by upregulating DNA repair 
enzymes and further strengthens antitumor immunity, potentially promoting M1 
macrophage polarization and limiting immune evasion by tumors. These mechanisms 
may also synergize with immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, 
to improve treatment responses. Despite strong evidence supporting the 
beneficial effects of exercise in oncology, further research is needed to 
determine optimal exercise types, intensities, and timing, as well as their 
interactions with emerging therapies. This review will explore the role of 
exercise in cancer prevention and treatment, emphasizing its molecular 
mechanisms to improve clinical outcomes based on current evidence.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is among the most common malignancies worldwide, with 
Black men experiencing significantly higher incidence, earlier onset, and more 
aggressive disease. These disparities reflect a complex interplay of factors. 
Adiposity, particularly visceral and periprostatic adipose tissue (PPAT), has 
emerged as a potential contributor to PCa progression, though its role in 
modifying racial disparities remains unclear. We conducted a narrative review to 
evaluate the relationship between obesity, visceral adiposity, PPAT, and PCa 
risk and aggressiveness, with attention to racial differences. A directed 
acyclic graph was developed to illustrate hypothesized pathways. Strong evidence 
supports associations between obesity, visceral fat, and aggressive PCa. Black 
men tend to have lower visceral and PPAT volumes than White men. However, these 
depots may exert greater biological effects in Black men, possibly due to 
differences in inflammatory signaling or fat composition. PPAT and waist-hip 
ratio may amplify aggressive PCa features in Black men while downplaying them in 
non-Black men. Adiposity may serve as a biomarker and modifier of racial 
disparities in PCa. An improved study design is needed to clarify mechanisms and 
inform targeted interventions. Understanding these interactions is essential to 
reducing PCa disparities in high-risk populations.

Colorectal cancer is a prevalent condition among the elderly population. We 
sought to examine the clinical and endoscopic characteristics of patients over 
age 75 diagnosed with late-onset colorectal cancer (LOCRC). We included patients 
with confirmed colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis in a national cohort from a 
large health service provider (Clalit), and a local cohort in a single tertiary 
center (years 2000-2023). We collected data regarding demographics, indications, 
comorbidities, endoscopic data, and laboratory values. A total of 27 465 
patients in the LOCRC group were compared with 40 594 younger patients. The mean 
age of each group was 82.7 ± 5 vs. 61.5 ± 10.8 years P < 0.001. Comorbidities 
were more common among the LOCRC group (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and 
iron deficiency anemia respectively). In the local cohort, rectal bleeding was a 
less common indication in patients with LOCRC (15.4 vs. 21%), while constipation 
(18.2 vs.8.4%), anemia (28.3 vs 13.4%), and weight loss (13.8 vs. 7.4%) were 
more prevalent. Patients with LOCRC had more right-sided colon cancer (43.9 vs. 
33.7%; P < 0.001). Disease staging showed a higher proportion of younger 
patients in stage IV (22.4 vs. 17.8%; P = 0.005), whereas older patients were 
more frequently classified as stage II (31.3 vs. 27.6%; P = 0.036). Surgical 
intervention was more frequent among older patients (86.2 vs. 71.2%; P < 0.001). 
The study highlights the differences in clinical and endoscopic characteristics 
of late-onset CRC. The findings underscore the need to refine diagnostic 
pathways and screening strategies tailored to elderly patients.

BACKGROUND: The non-medical economic consequences of cancer on individuals and 
families in low- and middle-income countries, including Bangladesh, remain 
poorly quantified. This study measures the non-medical economic consequences of 
cancer survivors and their families, including sacrifices in essential family 
consumption, social participation and family members' schooling.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey between January and May 2022, 
involving 607 adult patients receiving cancer treatment at two tertiary 
specialised cancer hospitals in Bangladesh. Participants reported any occurrence 
of non-medical economic consequences: reduction in essential goods (REG) 
consumption, avoidance of social events (ASE) and cessation of schooling (CS) of 
family members. We used a multivariable logistic regression model to assess the 
associations between each non-medical economic consequence and clinical and 
socioeconomic factors. Additionally, we fitted a Poisson regression to model the 
count of non-medical economic consequence events as a function of disease stage 
and relevant covariates.
RESULTS: Overall, 39% of patients reported REG, 36% ASE, and 38% CS. After 
adjusting for co-variates, advanced cancer (stage IV) was a significant 
predictor of non-medical economic consequence (REG: OR = 5.58, 95% CI 
0.99-31.44, p = 0.051; ASE: 11.35, 1.81-71.07, p = 0.009; SS: 101.56, 
2.47-4173.90, p = 0.015) compared with early cancer (stage I). Compared with the 
highest-income families, patients from low- and lower-middle-income families had 
significantly higher odds of experiencing all outcomes (REG: OR = 7.57, 
3.01-19.06, p < 0.001 and 7.23, 1.81-28.89, p = 0.005; ASE: 10.21, 3.81-27.36, p 
< 0.001 and 17.99, 4.26-75.96, p < 0.001; CS: 11.37, 3.23-40.00, p < 0.001 and 
12.58, 1.90-83.19, p = 0.009). Employed patients were also at markedly higher 
risk, with substantially increased odds of REG (18.27 times), ASE (41.01 times) 
and CS (72.34 times) compared with non-employed patients (all p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Cancer treatment in Bangladesh imposes substantial and inequitable 
non-medical economic consequences, disproportionately affecting patients with 
advanced-stage cancer, lower-income families and those in active employment. 
Policymakers may prioritise strengthening early cancer detection programs, 
expanding targeted financial protection schemes and introducing workplace and 
educational support mechanisms to safeguard family welfare and promote more 
equitable outcomes during cancer treatment.

PURPOSE: To cross-culturally adapt the Cancer Dyspnea Scale for individuals with 
cancer diagnosis to Brazilian Portuguese.
METHODS: This methodological study followed the COSMIN and Beaton et al. 
recommendations. The expert committee evaluation was performed by six 
individuals with different expertise. The pretest included 30 subjects with 
cancer diagnosis of both sexes, aged ≥18 years with or without a history of 
dyspnea. Those with hearing or cognitive impairments or difficulty understanding 
and responding to questionnaires were excluded. Content validity was assessed 
using the content validity index (CVI).
RESULTS: The expert committee included four healthcare professionals, one expert 
in linguistics and one expert in methodological studies. During the expert 
committee evaluation, the understanding and clarity of the instrument reached a 
CVI > 0.80 after four rounds. Pretest mean age was 53.86 ± 14.31 and 66.6% 
(n = 20) were females. The mean time of cancer diagnosis was 17.50 months (7.5 
to 60.0 months) and 34.88% (n = 13) presented breast cancer diagnosis. In the 
pretest, a CVI ≥ 0.90 was reached in the first round.
CONCLUSION: The Cancer Dyspnea Scale was satisfactorily adapted for Brazilian 
Portuguese. Further studies are needed to assess the psychometric properties of 
the adapted scale.

Plain Language Summary: The Cancer Dyspnea Scale (CDS)-Brazil instrument was 
translated and cross-culturally adapted into Brazilian Portuguese to make it 
feasible for assessing individuals with cancer diagnosis;The CDS-Brazil is a 
specific and valuable tool for dyspnea evaluation in cancer;Rehabilitation 
professionals should consider incorporating the CDS-Brazil instrument into their 
clinical practice for the assessment of dyspnea in individuals with cancer.

It is of great importance to study the biological effects of terahertz (THz) 
waves on human cancer cells for their potential future applications in cancer 
therapy. However, only a few examples of distinct biological effects have been 
reported due to the lack of strong THz radiation sources. Here, we report our 
preliminary investigation using a strong THz source at 1.56 THz with an average 
power of ~ 10 W and an average intensity of ~129.1 mW/cm2 working at a 
repetition rate of 10 Hz for its macro pulses with duration of ~1 ms and micro 
pulse duration of ~ 1 ps at a repetition rate of 54.17 MHz from a THz 
free-electron laser to investigate its biological effects on breast cancer cells 
in vitro. We observed significant morphological changes in breast cancer cells 
after 2 hours irradiation and apoptosis after 3 hours irradiation. Most notably, 
after 4 hours irradiation, we observed obvious cytolysis and the disappearance 
of most breast cancer cells in the center of the THz beam spot. It is suggested 
that these biological effects could be attributed mainly to the non-thermal 
effect of the strong THz waves according to our separate experimental results on 
the morphological changes of the breast cancer cells induced solely by heat. Our 
results indicate the potential to leverage the apoptosis and cytolysis of cancer 
cells induced by strong THz waves for future cancer treatment applications.

Plain Language Summary: THz wave refers to electromagnetic waves with 
frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 10 THz, which can incite the resonance with 
biomolecules in biological tissues or cells. Therefore, strong THz waves may 
induce some biological effects on biological tissues or cells. Among those 
biological effects, THz-induced cell death would have potential applications in 
future cancer treatment. However, only weak effects of the death including 
apoptosis and necrosis of human cancer cells have been reported in a few cases, 
probably due to the low average power of most of the current THz sources. This 
research investigates the biological effects on breast cancer cells induced by 
strong THz waves from the CTFEL, a current state-of-the-art intense THz source 
based on free-electron laser in China. This study indicated that sufficient 
doses of intense THz radiation at 1.56 THz can induce significant biological 
effects including not only obvious morphological changes but also apoptosis or 
even cytolyses on breast cancer cells. The findings suggest a possible novel 
strategy to treat the cancers with intense THz waves.

Electromagnetic fields and oxidative stress: The link to the development of 
cancer, neurological diseases, and behavioral disorders.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies suggest an association between exposure to 
electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and an increased incidence of malignant, 
cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases. This study aims to elucidate the 
fundamental principles and plausible mechanisms by which EMFs may influence 
physiological and pathological processes that lead to disease development.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published reports of oxidative stress, DNA damage, and 
disease risk related to EMF exposure were examined. The literature review 
provided the foundation for building a new conceptual model called the 
Electromagnetic Pathogenesis (EMP) model.
MECHANISMS: The EMP model proposes an increase in the probability of electron 
tunneling through the mitochondrial electron transport chain as the primary 
pathophysiological mechanism triggered by non-ionizing EMFs. Induced electric 
fields and quantum tunneling may enhance electron leakage during mitochondrial 
respiration, which is a major source of free radicals.
FINDINGS: There is a deep connection between quantum tunneling, entropy, and 
Heisenberg's principle. As a direct consequence of Heisenberg's principle, 
еlectron tunneling is essentially involved in free radical production and 
entropy generation in cells. Both normal aging and chronic diseases may be 
considered as the biologic manifestations of increasing entropy. Heisenberg's 
principle underlies normal aging and sets the limit to life expectancy.
SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: The human brain, particularly the structural and functional 
networks that support social communication, is highly vulnerable to oxidative 
stress associated with EMF exposure. Long-term exposure may negatively affect 
social and reproductive behaviors in both men and women, potentially 
contributing to a decline in fertility rates and the acceleration of population 
aging.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) expresses epidermal growth factor 
receptors (EGFR) in 90% of cases. Here we studied PET/CT imaging of three 
clinically relevant HNSCC patient derived xenografts (PDX) with low (#61531), 
moderate (#73191) or high (#88955) EGFR expression in NRG mice using anti-EGFR 
[64Cu]Cu-DOTA-panitumumab F(ab')2. We further assessed the effectiveness of 
β-particle-emitting [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-panitumumab F(ab')2 for radioimmunotherapy 
(RIT) of these PDX. All PDX were visualized by PET/CT at 24 h postinjection 
(p.i.) of [64Cu]Cu-DOTA-panitumumab F(ab')2. In addition, in mice with PDX 
#88955, an axillary lymph node metastasis was imaged by PET and lung metastases 
were imaged by SPECT/CT at 3 to 12 d p.i. of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-panitumumab F(ab')2. 
Tumor uptake of [64Cu]Cu-DOTA-panitumumab F(ab')2 at 24 h p.i. was directly 
correlated with EGFR expression (6.7 ± 3.5%, 13.5 ± 2.5% and 16.7 ± 1.0% ID/g 
for PDX #61531, #73191 and #88955, respectively). Intravenous administration of 
5.0 MBq (50 μg) of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-panitumumab F(ab')2 to healthy NRG mice caused 
no hematologic, liver or kidney toxicity or decrease in body weight. RIT with 
4.0-5.0 MBq (50 μg) of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-panitumumab F(ab')2 decreased the tumor 
growth rate vs 0.9% NaCl by 2, 9 and 3.2-fold, respectively in mice with PDX 
#61531, #73191 and #88955 (P = 0.014, P < 0.001, P = 0.004). Treatment of mice 
with unlabeled DOTA-panitumumab F(ab')2 did not decrease the tumor growth rate 
of PDX#61531 (P = 0.457) but modestly decreased the tumor growth rate of PDX 
#73191 by 1.3-fold (P = 0.024) and PDX #88955 by 1.4-fold (P = 0.027). RIT was 
EGFR-specific as irrelevant anti-HER2 [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-trastuzumab F(ab')2 was not 
effective for treatment of PDX #73191 vs 0.9% NaCl (P = 0.282). RIT with 
[177Lu]Lu-DOTA-panitumumab F(ab')2 was 3-fold more effective for treating 
moderately EGFR-expressing PDX #73191 than PDX #88955 with high EGFR expression. 
This may be explained by the human papilloma virus (HPV) positivity of PDX 
#73191 since HPV-positive HNSCC is more responsive to external radiation beam 
treatment. We conclude that [64Cu]Cu-DOTA-panitumumab F(ab')2 and 
[177Lu]Lu-DOTA-panitumumab F(ab')2 are a promising theranostic pair for PET/CT 
imaging and RIT of HNSCC.

STUDY AIM: Treatment of stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has evolved 
rapidly in recent years. To improve our understanding of real-world outcomes in 
Switzerland, we report on our institutional experience at an academic lung 
cancer centre and describe treatment patterns and clinical outcomes over a 
multi-year period.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with stage III NSCLC between 2013 and 2023 were 
included in an ethics-approved institutional database. Based on tumour board 
decisions, the initial treatment strategy was defined for each patient. Overall 
and progression-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A 
multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to study the impact of 
different factors on clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 315 patients with stage III NSCLC were included. Patients 
were a median of 68 years old, and two-thirds were male. The most common stage 
at diagnosis was IIIA (56%), followed by stage IIIB (36%) and IIIC (8%). A 
curative treatment approach was pursued in 88% of patients, and over 90% of 
these received definitive local treatment (surgery and/or radiotherapy). Rates 
of 1-year overall and progression-free survival improved from 64% and 47%, 
respectively, in 2013-2016, to 82% and 70% in 2020-2023. However, 49% of 
patients developed locoregional and/or distant recurrence. Results of the 
multivariate analysis are presented in the manuscript.
CONCLUSIONS: Almost 90% of patients with stage III NSCLC underwent treatment 
with curative intent, with rates of treatment adherence that compared favourably 
to the literature. Although survival outcomes appear to have improved in recent 
years, the rates of disease recurrence remain high, reflecting a need for 
further improvements.

BACKGROUND: Culture is important as it influences how survivors navigate micro 
(e.g. interpersonal relationships, social networks) and macro systems (e.g. 
healthcare system, society) in their everyday lives. This study applied a 
sociocultural lens, using the PEN-3 cultural model, to explore experiences of 
Black and Latinx cancer survivors and their families with the aim of identifying 
recommendations to improve cancer survivorship experience.
METHODS: We used qualitative descriptive design. A total of 17 (4 men and 13 
women) cancer survivors 50 years or older (Mean age = 63.9 years) were 
interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. Afterwards, we conducted 
six focus group discussions (three Latinx and three Black groups) with a total 
of 33 caregivers of cancer survivors (Mean age = 63 years). All interviews were 
audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using a hybrid of 
inductive-deductive thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Three themes were identified from the analysis: Two of the themes were 
labeled using the PEN-3 cultural model categories; (1) relationships and 
expectations influencing survivorship experience, (2) cultural empowerment and 
cancer survivorship. The third theme represents the improvement recommendations 
provided by the participants; (3) recommendations for improving survivorship.
DISCUSSION: The findings of this study will add to a body of knowledge on using 
a cultural lens to deepen our understanding cancer survivorship inequities and 
may inform culturally tailored cancer survivorship interventions in Black and 
Latinx communities.

Stimuli-responsive nanomaterials with multivalent ligands have attracted 
significant attention in the context of cancer chemotherapy and imaging. 
However, challenges remain such as nonselective stimuli response and/or 
existence of triggers in healthy regions in addition to the intrinsic 
heterogeneity of cancer that causes insufficient target recognition. Inspired by 
the expression of precise and diverse functions of biological machineries 
triggered by specific protein-protein complexation and conformational change, we 
report an artificial system where a bio-orthogonal click reaction between hetero 
nanoassemblies triggers their complexation and conformational changes, resulting 
in the emergence of multivalent ligands for cancer-associated enzymes, namely, 
carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX). We also demonstrated that the multivalent ligands 
selectively inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells overexpressing CAIX 
under hypoxic conditions. Additionally, the click reaction between 
nanoassemblies in the presence of target cells provided higher efficacy of the 
emerged multivalent ligands than that pre-formed in the absence of cells. Our 
study provides a basis for the development of multivalent ligands displaying 
adaptive binding interfaces for target cancer cells with high selectivity and 
affinity to thus potentially overcome tumor heterogeneity.

Chemo-sonodynamic synergistic therapy (CSDT) integrates the advantages of both 
chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and sonodynamic therapy (SDT), including specificity, 
non-invasiveness, high penetration, and controllability, and it is especially 
suitable for deep-seated tumors. However, there is still a lack of effective 
CSDT agents with long-term stability, excellent water solubility, 
biocompatibility, and highly efficient catalytic activities. To address these 
challenges, we report a rare sonosensitive polyoxometalate (POM), 
H11[Er2Sb2W7O23(OH)(DMF)2(SbW9O33)2]·17H2O (ErSbW), featuring an atomically 
precise capsule-like structure with good solubility, molecular stability, and 
biosafety under physiological conditions. In vitro studies reveal ErSbW's 
remarkable CDT efficiency in catalyzing the generation of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS). More importantly, the efficiency can be further distinctly 
augmented by three times with the presence of ultrasound irradiation, suggesting 
a pronounced synergistic enhancement effect in ErSbW. Most notably, 
ErSbW-mediated CSDT achieved complete eradication of deep-seated tumors in a 
melanoma model at the dose of 35 µg kg-1. This work not only provides a unique 
POM-based molecular agent for CSDT but also demonstrates the great potential of 
POM materials in synergistic cancer therapies.

Short-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are increasingly being 
used as substitutes for long-chain PFAS due to their lower bioaccumulation 
potential. However, their persistence and mobility can lead to toxicity and pose 
significant long-term health risks. Hence, the present study aims to investigate 
the toxicity and the molecular mechanisms associated with cancer and 
reproductive toxicity linked to short-chain PFAS based on network toxicology and 
molecular docking. The short-chain PFAS representatives used in this study 
include PFBA, PFBS, PFHxA, and PFHpA. The predicted biological targets for PFBA, 
PFBS, PFHxA, and PFHpA are 6, 2, 20, and 34, respectively. Potential targets 
from the disease library were identified and analyzed for protein-protein 
interactions and pathway enrichment. The top five targets were selected for 
molecular docking studies to examine interactions. Molecular docking indicated 
strong interactions between biological targets and pollutants, mainly through 
hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. Short-chain PFAS representatives have shown 
strong interaction with proteins such as HDAC3 (-6.133 kcal/mol), SHBG 
(-6.176 kcal/mol), PPARD (-6.355 kcal/mol and -6.205 kcal/mol), and FABP4 
(-6.091 kcal/mol). This study also used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to 
validate interactions, revealing significant dynamic behavior between proteins 
and ligands. Fourteen proteins linked to short-chain PFAS were associated with 
cancer and reproductive toxicity, with many targets common across diseases. 
Notably, PFHxA and PFHpA share several target proteins, suggesting similar 
effects in the body. Overall, the study provides an overview of the biological 
targets of short-chain PFAS and their potential health impacts.

In cancer cells, ATR signaling is crucial to tolerate the intrinsically high 
damage levels that normally block replication fork progression. Assembly of 
TopBP1, a multifunctional scaffolding protein, into condensates is required to 
amplify ATR kinase activity to the levels needed to coordinate the DNA damage 
response and manage DNA replication stress. Many ATR inhibitors are tested for 
cancer treatment in clinical trials, but their overall effectiveness is often 
compromised by the emergence of resistance and toxicities. In this 
proof-of-concept study, we propose to disrupt the ATR pathway by targeting 
TopBP1 condensation. First, we screened a molecule-based library using a 
previously developed optogenetic approach and identified several TopBP1 
condensation inhibitors. Among them, AZD2858 disrupted TopBP1 assembly induced 
by the clinically relevant topoisomerase I inhibitor SN-38, thereby inhibiting 
the ATR/Chk1 signaling pathway. We found that AZD2858 exerted its effects by 
disrupting TopBP1 self-interaction and binding to ATR in mammalian cells, and by 
increasing its chromatin recruitment in cell-free Xenopus laevis egg extracts. 
Moreover, AZD2858 prevented S-phase checkpoint induction by SN-38, leading to 
increased DNA damage and apoptosis in a colorectal cancer cell line. Lastly, 
AZD2858 showed a synergistic effect in combination with the FOLFIRI chemotherapy 
regimen in a spheroid model of colorectal cancer.

Pericytes are intrinsic components of vessels that regulate vascular stability 
and permeability. Aberrant vascularization is a hallmark of cancer, although the 
contribution of pericytes to this process is poorly understood. Here, we 
undertook a combined computational and experimental approach to identify the 
molecular reprogramming of prostate pericytes during cancer pathogenesis and 
progression. Analysis of human prostate cancer and murine models showed that 
prostate tumors exhibit a disequilibrium between endothelial and pericyte 
content with prognostic potential. Deeper molecular analysis revealed that there 
is no overt loss of pericytes in prostate tumors but rather a dysfunction that 
is concomitant with altered expression of a subset of cellular markers. We 
translate this finding into a simplified signature that discriminates pericyte 
abundance versus function. Leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing data, we find 
that TGF-β governs the molecular changes that underlie pericyte dysfunction in 
tumors. This mechanism is associated with reduced expression of contractility 
markers, enlargement of the vascular lumen, and increased permeability in 
prostate cancer. This study revisits the paradigm of the reduced number of 
pericytes in favor of their dysfunction in tumors and the importance of 
paracrine signaling in this process.

Zinc(II) complexes have emerged as promising antitumor agents due to their 
favorable biosafety and biocompatibility, and demonstrated effectiveness in 
photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, their therapeutic potential is limited by 
the poor tissue penetration of PDT agents. Herein, a novel zinc(II) complex 
designed for sonodynamic therapy (SDT), capable of producing substantial amounts 
of singlet oxygen upon ultrasonic activation, is introduced. This sonosensitizer 
effectively induces pyroptosis in breast cancer cells, significantly promoting 
the antitumor immune response. This work represents the first exploration of 
zinc(II) complexes in SDT, establishing a new avenue for enhanced therapeutic 
outcomes against breast cancer.

The three-prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1), an intracellular double-stranded 
DNA (dsDNA) degrader that inhibits the stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes 
(STING) pathway, is turned over by E3 ligase TRIM24-mediated proteasomal 
degradation. To uncover TREX1-stabilizers in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 
mass spectrometry is conducted, and 374 candidates are identified, with the RING 
Finger and WD Repeat Domain 3 (RFWD3) as a TREX1 protector that sequesters it 
from TRIM24. Overexpression of RFWD3 promotes tumor growth with increased 
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), while inhibition of RFWD3 increases 
intracellular dsDNA levels, activates the STING-IFN signaling, decreases MDSCs, 
and enhances the efficacy of PD-L1 blockade in murine NSCLC models. Furthermore, 
smoker patients have higher RFWD3 levels than non-smoker patients, and cigarette 
smoke extract, PM2.5, and benzo(a)pyrene upregulatesRFWD3 via transcription 
factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor. These results indicate a role of RFWD3 in 
tobacco smoke and haze (smohaze)-promoted immune evasion, inhibition of which 
activates STING-IFN signaling and synergizes with immune checkpoint inhibitors 
in NSCLC.

Early diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) cancer is crucial for patient 
prognosis, yet conventional methods suffer from invasiveness and insufficient 
molecular sensitivity. While Raman spectroscopy offers non-invasive molecular 
fingerprinting, spectral overlap in complex biological samples poses a 
challenge. To address this, this study introduces a diagnostic framework that 
synergizes Raman spectroscopy with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to 
quantitatively resolve spectral components for improved GI cancer detection. 
Based on Raman spectra from 829 GI tissues and five pure components (DNA, 
triolein, histone, collagen, and actin), an improved CNN regression model was 
trained on 100 000 simulated spectra. The model accurately quantified the 
relative proportions of these five biochemicals (R2: 0.91-0.98), revealing 
significantly higher coefficients for DNA, collagen, and actin, and lower 
coefficients for triolein and histone in malignant tissues (P < 0.01). Utilizing 
these quantitative molecular features, a subsequent LightGBM classification 
model achieved an accuracy of 97.2%, a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 
98.1%, and an AUC of 0.973 on an independent test set. This work therefore 
demonstrates a powerful approach for discriminating benign and malignant GI 
tissues by quantitatively modeling key molecular alterations. The high 
classification accuracy validates the clinical translational potential of this 
non-invasive method for GI cancer screening and offers a generalizable strategy 
for other complex biological analyses and diagnostics.

Mechano-chemo cancer treatment is an emerging therapeutic strategy that enhances 
chemotherapy efficacy by combining chemical agents with mechanical forces to 
improve drug uptake and overcome resistance. However, current approaches for 
delivering mechanical forces, including magnetic stress, hydrodynamic shear, and 
ultrasonic cavitation, suffer from limited tunability, poor spatial precision, 
and off-target effects, restricting their clinical potential. Here, we introduce 
ChemoTAP (chemotherapy-enhanced tunable acoustofluidic permeabilization), an 
acoustofluidic system that utilizes standing surface acoustic waves (SAWs) to 
achieve highly localized, tunable mechanical stimulation, enhancing tumor cell 
permeability and improving chemotherapeutic efficiency. By fine-tuning SAW 
parameters, ChemoTAP transiently modulates membrane permeability by activating 
mechanosensitive ion channels, leading to cytoskeletal remodeling and a 
2.73-fold increase in intracellular calcium ion flux in HeLa cells. This 
SAW-induced mechanotransduction response synergistically enhances the cytotoxic 
effects of cisplatin, increasing tumor cell apoptosis by 1.78-fold through 
mitochondrial membrane depolarization, reactive oxygen species generation, and 
endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways. Unlike conventional ultrasound-based 
cavitation methods, ChemoTAP enables precise, non-invasive mechanical 
stimulation without requiring microbubbles, offering a controllable and scalable 
alternative for mechano-chemo cancer treatment. ChemoTAP establishes a 
foundation for further studies in mechanotherapy treatment pathways and promotes 
the broader integration of acoustics in oncology.

Accurate in vitro modeling of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is essential for 
advancing our understanding of cancer biology and for developing effective 
anti-cancer therapeutics. Context-dependent and patient-specific, the dynamic 
interactions between cancer cells and stromal elements significantly affect 
tumor progression and treatment response. Recent advances in biomaterials, 
microdevices, and molecular analysis techniques have facilitated the development 
of in vitro tumor models that better replicate these cancer-stromal 
interactions. In turn, these models have deepened the understanding of cancer 
biology, leading to the discovery of new prognostic markers and establishing 
preclinical platforms that more reliably predict clinical outcomes. However, 
challenges persist in fully capturing the immense complexity of the TME and 
translating these models for real clinical impact. In this review, key design 
principles for creating physiologically relevant tumor models are first 
described, then the latest advances in tumor modeling that have contributed to 
new biological insights and progress in drug development are discussed.

INTRODUCTION: Cancers of the central nervous system (CNS) include primary and 
metastatic tumors of varying cells of origin. These tumors may be benign or 
malignant, with incidence rates varying based on age, gender, and tumor type. 
While heterogeneous, all CNS tumors harbor risk of neurocognitive impairment, 
impairing patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
METHOD: This narrative review was informed by a targeted literature search in 
PubMed and Scopus, focusing on studies reporting neurocognitive deficits in 
patients with gliomas, primary CNS lymphomas, and metastatic CNS tumors. 
Articles were selected based on clinical relevance, methodological quality, and 
their contribution to key themes in neurocognitive outcomes among patients with 
CNS tumor: impact of tumor type, location, and treatment modalities, including 
surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. The 
influence of adjunctive treatments such as corticosteroids and antiepileptics on 
neurocognitive function was also examined. Data synthesis included 
neurocognitive assessment measures, patient demographics, and potential 
modifiers such as brain plasticity and psychological distress. This approach was 
designed to support an integrative, expert-informed synthesis rather than a 
systematic or exhaustive review.
RESULTS: Findings indicate that neurocognitive deficits are prevalent among CNS 
tumor patients, with impairments in memory, attention, processing speed, and 
executive function. Tumor location significantly influences the type and 
severity of deficits, with frontal and temporal lobe involvement being 
particularly detrimental. Treatment modalities contribute to neurocognitive 
decline, with radiotherapy having cumulative negative effects. Psychological 
distress and individual brain resilience further modulate outcomes, highlighting 
the need for individualized treatment strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: Neurocognitive impairment in CNS tumor patients results from both 
disease pathology and treatment effects. Understanding these mechanisms is 
crucial for developing targeted interventions, including cognitive 
rehabilitation and tailored treatment plans, to optimize patient outcomes. 
Improved management strategies incorporating neuroprotective approaches and 
psychological support are essential for enhancing long-term HRQoL in CNS tumor 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Malnutrition worsens gastrointestinal (GI) cancer outcomes in older 
adults; long-term US mortality trends and disparities remain insufficiently 
understood. This study analyzed demographic/geographic mortality trends related 
to malnutrition and GI cancer among older adults in the United States.
METHODS: Mortality data from 1999 to 2020 were obtained via CDC WONDER for 
adults aged ≥65 years, in which malnutrition and GI cancer were listed as 
underlying or contributing causes of death. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) 
per 100,000 population and annual percentage changes (APCs) were calculated and 
stratified by year, sex, race/ethnicity, and region.
RESULTS: A total of 31,806 deaths were recorded. AAMRs declined from 4.4 in 1999 
to 2.6 in 2013 (APC: -7.7 to -1.4), then rose to 5.5 in 2020 (APC: 11.6, 95% CI: 
10.7-12.8). Men had higher AAMRs (4.3) than women (2.7). Among men, AAMRs 
dropped from 5.4 in 1999 to 3.3 in 2006, then increased to 7.2 in 2020 (APC: 
11.9, 95% CI: 10.5-14.1). Women's rates declined from 3.8 in 1999 to 2.0 in 
2013, before rising to 4.2 in 2020 (APC: 11.8, 95% CI: 10.2-14.0). Black or 
African American individuals (5.3), Alaska (7.1), and the Western United States 
(7.0) had the highest mortality. Nonmetropolitan areas consistently had higher 
AAMRs (4.0) than metropolitan areas (3.3).
CONCLUSIONS: After years of decline, mortality from malnutrition and GI cancers 
has sharply increased among older adults, with notable sex, racial, and regional 
disparities. These findings underscore the need for focused public health 
strategies to address these growing inequalities.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in the occurrence and development of 
various carcinomas. However, the biogenesis, function and underlying mechanism 
of hypoxia-induced circRNA in gastric cancer (GC) are poorly understood. Here, a 
novel circRNA, circPRELID2, which is upregulated by HIF1A under hypoxic 
conditions, is identified. circPRELID2 is highly expressed in GC tissues, and 
positively correlates with lymph node invasion, vascular invasion in GC 
patients. Elevated circPRELID2 promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT) and metastasis of GC cells both in vitro and in vivo under hypoxic 
conditions. Mechanistically, HIF1A directly binds to the PRELID2 promoter to 
transcriptionally increase the expression of PRELID2 pre-mRNA in response to 
hypoxia. Moreover, protein kinase DYRK1A mediates SFPQ phosphorylation to 
promote the interaction between SFPQ and SAM68, further forming a 
DYRK1A-SFPQ-SAM68 ternary complex. Subsequently, the DYRK1A-SFPQ-SAM68 complex 
binds to Alu-containing introns flanking the circPRELID2-forming exons in the 
PRELID2 pre-mRNA to promote circPRELID2 circularization. Furthermore, 
circPRELID2 interacts with PCBP1 and promotes the cytoplasmic retention of 
PCBP1. CircPRELID2 enhances OGT-mediated PCBP1 O-GlcNAcylation at Threonine 99 
site in the cytoplasm, which disrupts the binding of PCBP1 to the 3'-UTR of 
ZEB2, resulting in the reversal of ZEB2 translation silencing, and ultimately 
promoting the EMT and metastasis of GC cells. These findings reveal a new 
regulatory mechanism of circRNA biogenesis, and also uncover that circPRELID2 
participates in the translation of ZEB2 during GC metastasis via the modulation 
of PCBP1 O-GlcNAcylation, which provides a promising prognostic biomarker and 
therapeutic target for GC metastasis.

Single or combined ROS therapy will induce cancer resistance after long-term 
medication cure. Although currently concurrent H2/ROS therapy is a promising 
method, the mutual reaction between H2 and ROS dampens their efficiency. To 
address this issue, g-C3N4-based dual-heterojunctions, i.e., N-doped carbon 
nanoribbons (N-CNB)/g-C3N4 and core-shell-structured Au@Pd nanoparticles/g-C3N4, 
respectively, are constructed to decode alternate H2/ROS therapy. Therein, 
N-CNB/g-C3N4 heterojunctions enhance near-infrared (NIR) photoabsorption to 
unlock photocatalytic H2 evolution, and Au@Pd/g-C3N4 heterojunctions unlock the 
inherent and newly-emerging bioenzymes-like catalytic ROS birth. In this 
alternate H2/ROS therapy, photocatalytic H2 evolution and 
multienzymically-catalytic ROS birth are alternately decoded under NIR ""on"" and 
""off"", respectively, because the photoirradiation-triggered structural shift 
insensitive to photothermal effects is reversible in response to NIR ""on"" and 
""off"", displaying a temporal controllability. The alternate H2/ROS therapy 
expedites the infiltrations and intratumoral proliferation of anti-tumor immune 
cells including CTLs and Th17, hampers the infiltrations of exhausted CD8+ T 
cells and Tregs, and downregulates resistance-associated proteins (PARP, EpCAM, 
and CD133). These actions cooperatively activate robust immune responses, 
attenuate anti-tumor immunity confinements, and cancer resistance to suppress 
common and Sorafenib-induced resistant liver cancer. This work offers 
distinctive insights into cancer resistance removal.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Effective implementation of population-based 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) screening requires careful evaluation of its 
diagnostic performance and potential harms. This study aimed to assess the 
diagnostic performance and potential harms of EGD for gastric cancer screening 
under the National Cancer Screening Program.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, asymptomatic individuals aged ≥40 years 
who underwent screening EGD between 2017 and 2023 were included. Diagnostic 
yield and potential harms were compared between middle-aged and older adults. 
Univariable and multivariable Poisson regression analyses were used to identify 
factors associated with detection of high-risk gastric lesions.
RESULTS: Among 12,413 participants, a mean of 35.4 endoscopic images per 
examination was obtained, with a mean procedure time of 4.2 minutes. 
Precancerous conditions and high-risk gastric lesions were identified in 64.3% 
and 0.7% of participants, respectively, both of which were more prevalent in 
older adults (p<0.001 and p=0.043, respectively). Procedure-related adverse 
events (1.1%) and false-positive findings (2.8%) were comparable between age 
groups. However, false-negative results were significantly higher among older 
adults than middle-aged individuals (3.4% vs 1.1%, p<0.001). In multivariable 
analysis, older age (≥65 years), male sex, more EGD images, and longer procedure 
time were independently associated with the detection of high-risk lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: In population-based EGD screening, older age, male sex, and 
high-quality procedural metrics (e.g., more images and longer examination time) 
were independently associated with the detection of high-risk gastric lesions. 
These findings may inform risk-stratified screening strategies and quality 
benchmarks for EGD screening programs.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk is approximately 0.1% according to 
registry data, and fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) identify approximately 5% 
of screened individuals as positive. We evaluated whether a negative FIT result 
is reassuring regarding CRC risk.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 141,982 Taiwanese individuals aged 
≥50 who underwent self-paid medical screening from 1994 to 2008 were enrolled. 
CRC cases and all-cause deaths were identified through the National Cancer 
Registry and National Death File. A negative FIT was defined as <20 μg Hb/g.
RESULTS: There were 987 CRC patients with a negative FIT and 713 with a positive 
FIT. Among the 133,369 individuals with one negative FIT, 113 CRC patients were 
registered within 2 years and 803 within 10 years; only 15% of the CRC cases 
were identified within the first 2 years after testing. The overall incidence 
was 1.27/1,000 person-years, decreasing by 63% to 0.80/1,000 person-years after 
one negative FIT. With repeated biennial negative FITs, CRC risk declined to 
63%, 53%, 33%, 23%, and 10% over 10 years. All-cause mortality decreased from 
1,106/100,000 person-years to 511/100,000 person-years. Notably, 84% of the 
cohort had consistently negative FIT results across all five rounds.
CONCLUSIONS: Two-thirds of the 10-year CRC risk remained in individuals 
following one negative FIT. The risk after a negative FIT result reemerged 2 
years after testing, highlighting the importance of continuing biennial FIT 
screening. Consistently negative FITs were associated with reduced CRC risk and 
a lower all-cause mortality. This study is limited by the lack of confirmatory 
colonoscopy in FIT-negative individuals, which may lead to an underestimation of 
CRC incidence.

Irinotecan (CPT-11), a first-line chemotherapeutic agent for colorectal cancer, 
faces challenges like tumor drug resistance and severe toxicities such as 
neutropenia and diarrhea. Current nanocarriers for CPT-11 have limitations in 
achieving high drug loading and stimuli-responsive drug release. In this study, 
we developed a novel nanosystem (ICP@PDA-PP@HA NPs) by first coordinating CPT-11 
and curcumin (Cur) with Fe3+ to form infinite coordination polymer nanoparticles 
(CPT11-Fe(III)-Cur ICPs), which were subsequently surface-modified with 
polydopamine (PDA) to yield ICP@PDA NPs. These NPs were then encapsulated in 
micelles composed of aldehyde-modified poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and 
poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI), followed by further modification with hyaluronic 
acid. The resulting nanosystem achieves efficient tumor targeting and 
ultra-sensitive pH-responsive drug release. CPT-11 induces immunogenic cell 
death (ICD) in tumor cells, while Cur enhances CPT-11 intracellular accumulation 
and reduces resistance. PDA-mediated photothermal therapy, when combined with 
dual-drug chemotherapy, synergistically induces ICD through non-repetitive 
multiple pathways, thereby enhancing the antitumor immune response. In vivo 
experiments showed that low-dose ICP@PDA-PP@HA NPs achieved a tumor inhibition 
rate of 95.8% after 21 days, and when combined with anti-PD-L1, the tumor 
inhibition rate reached 100% with no recurrence within 90 days.

IntroductionBreast cancer survivors have a higher risk of interval cancers 
relative to the screening population. Patient characteristics including features 
of the primary cancer and its treatment can help predict interval second breast 
cancer risk, but patient and physician perspectives on how risk prediction tools 
might enhance surveillance decision making are not well characterized.DesignWe 
conducted a qualitative study of women with breast cancer who had completed 
primary treatment and multispecialty physicians recruited through Breast Cancer 
Surveillance Consortium registries. We conducted semi-structured focus groups 
with 5 to 7 breast cancer survivors and individual physician interviews. All 
participants were presented with information about an interval cancer risk 
prediction tool. We elicited participant perspectives on aspects of the tool's 
design, relevance, and use for surveillance decision making. Data coding, 
thematic analysis, and interpretation were guided by the principles of 
theoretical thematic analysis.ResultsForty physician interviews and 4 focus 
groups involving 23 breast cancer survivors were analyzed. Two prominent areas 
of focus emerged: 1) perspectives on how a risk prediction tool would enhance 
and add value to patient-centered care and 2) risk prediction tools can be a 
means to improve communication about risk of in-breast recurrence or new breast 
cancer.ConclusionsThis study provides data on breast cancer survivor and 
physician perceptions of a new risk prediction tool to support surveillance 
imaging decisions among breast cancer survivors.ImplicationsAn interval second 
breast cancer risk prediction tool may promote evidence-based care across an 
array of physicians and different clinical settings. Future research should 
identify care delivery settings and features that promote adoption and support 
use in ways that improve shared decision making and patient 
outcomes.HighlightsThis qualitative study of breast cancer survivors and 
physicians found that risk prediction tools to support surveillance decisions 
were perceived positively when positioned as a supplement to the 
patient-physician relationship.Both patients and physicians said that a tool 
supported by strong evidence and accessible outputs would be valuable for shared 
decision making.

BACKGROUND: Afatinib's efficacy and dose-adjustment strategies have been 
validated in clinical trials and increasingly supported by real-world evidence.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to provide additional real-world insights into 
afatinib use and to assess the impact of initial dosing and subsequent dose 
modifications on treatment outcomes and tolerability in patients with advanced 
epidermal-growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC).
DESIGN: We conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis of patients with 
advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC who received first-line afatinib between April 2018 
and June 2022.
METHODS: Patients were categorized into four subgroups based on their starting 
and optimal afatinib doses. The primary endpoints were to analyze the 
association between afatinib dosing and time-to-treatment failure (TTF), overall 
survival (OS), and toxicity.
RESULTS: A total of 343 patients were included. The most common starting 
afatinib dose was 30 mg (58.6%), followed by 40 mg (39.9%). The optimal dose 
maintained during treatment was 30 mg in 62.1% of patients, 40 mg in 33.2%, and 
20 mg in 4.7%. Dose reductions due to toxicity occurred in 23.6% of cases. 
Regarding four subgroups: 53.1% of patients started and remained on <40 mg, 
25.4% started and maintained 40 mg, 14.6% started at 40 mg but de-escalated to 
<40 mg, and 7.0% started <40 mg and escalated to 40 mg. After a median follow-up 
of 36.8 months, the median OS for all patients was 31.3 months (95% confidence 
interval: 29.3-33.1). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified smoking 
status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and EGFR mutation 
subtype as independent prognostic factors for OS. Notably, patients who 
initiated treatment at 40 mg but de-escalated to <40 mg had the longest median 
TTF and OS. In terms of safety, the highest incidence of adverse events was 
observed in this group, followed by those who started and remained at <40 mg.
CONCLUSION: In this real-world cohort, flexible afatinib dosing-either by 
initiating at 40 mg followed by dose reduction or starting at <40 mg with later 
escalation-was associated with favorable survival outcomes and manageable 
tolerability. These findings support the use of individualized afatinib dosing 
strategies to optimize both efficacy and safety in patients with EGFR-mutant 
NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is rare but aggressive, 
characterized by the rapid onset of diffuse skin erythema, edema, tenderness, 
induration, and fast metastasis. Both hormone receptor positive (HR+) and human 
epidermal receptor 2 positive (HER2+) are associated with inferior response 
after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) compared to non-IBC. Despite 
multimodal treatment approaches, the 3-year overall survival rate for stage III 
IBC remains low at approximately 74%, around 10% lower than the 83% for non-IBC.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether the addition of neratinib, an irreversible 
pan-ErbB receptor small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, improves the rate of 
pathological complete response in both HER2+ and HR+/HER2- IBC in neoadjuvant 
therapy, and to assess safety and explore biomarkers associated with response.
DESIGN: This is a phase I/II (HER2+; cohort 1) and II (HR+/HER2-; cohort II 
trial conducted at a single center.
METHODS: Pathological response was assessed using the pathological complete 
response (pCR) and residual cancer burden (RCB) criteria as the primary efficacy 
endpoint. Safety and biomarkers were assessed.
RESULTS: In cohort 1, dose-limiting toxicities were Grade 2/3 diarrhea. Among 
the 10 evaluable patients from cohort 1 who underwent surgery, 5 achieved pCR 
(50%); in the intention-to-treat population of all 14 patients (counting 
drop-outs as nonresponders), the pCR rate was 36%. In cohort 2, 16 patients were 
enrolled, and 1 (6%) achieved pCR. Common adverse events (AEs) included Grade 2 
alopecia, Grade 2/3 diarrhea, anemia, nausea, and neutropenia. High toxicity led 
to early closure of accrual. The median event-free survival in cohort 2 was 27.5 
months, and was not reached for cohort 1 by data cutoff. Biomarker analysis 
showed that good responders (pCR + RCB-I) in both cohorts exhibited upregulation 
of immune-activating pathways, including interferon signaling and cytotoxic 
T-cell markers. By contrast, poor responders (RCB-II + RCB-III) showed 
immune-suppressive features, increased angiogenesis, proliferation, and 
anti-apoptotic gene expression.
CONCLUSION: The addition of neratinib to neoadjuvant therapy showed potential in 
improving the pCR rate in HER2+ IBC (36% in this study) but not in HR+/HER2- 
(6%), though high toxicity was a major limiting factor. Further research is 
needed to optimize the balance between efficacy and safety. Biomarker analysis 
uncovered interesting new hypothesis-generating data warranting future study in 
IBC.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03101748.

Plain Language Summary: Neratinib for inflammatory breast cancer patients 
Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive type of breast cancer. 
It spreads quickly, causing redness, swelling, and a pitted appearance of the 
skin on more than two-thirds of the breast. IBC is hard to treat, and even with 
combined treatments like chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, the survival rate 
is much lower than for other breast cancers. This study aimed to find out if 
adding a drug called neratinib to the usual treatment could improve outcomes for 
IBC patients. Neratinib inhibits specific proteins like HER2 and EGFR that help 
cancer grow, potentially making it a valuable addition to the treatment plan. We 
tested the safety and efficacy of neratinib combined with standard IBC 
treatment. We monitored side effects and measured how well the cancer responded 
using pCR and RCB criteria. In one group (Cohort 1), the main side effects were 
moderate to severe diarrhea, hair loss, nausea, anemia, fatigue, low potassium, 
and low white blood cell counts. Once the dose of neratinib was determined, 14 
participants were enrolled in phase II and 5 (36%) achieved pCR. If we only 
count participants who went through surgery, the pCR was 50%. In another group 
(Cohort 2), out of 16 participants, only 1 (6%) had pCR. The addition of 
neratinib to standard treatment showed some promise in helping patients with 
IBC, especially in the HER2-positive subgroup, yet due to the high number of 
side effects we stopped adding new patients. More research is needed to find a 
balance between benefits and risks, and future studies may be warranted to 
improve the response while mitigating side effects.

Prostate cancer (PC) continues to represent a significant contributor to male 
cancer mortality worldwide, necessitating the discovery of innovative diagnostic 
indicators and molecular targets. Our investigation utilized computational 
biology approaches combining multi-omics analysis with machine intelligence to 
elucidate the role of palmitoylation-related genes (PRGs) in PC pathogenesis and 
prognosis. By harmonizing transcriptomic datasets from TCGA and GEO 
repositories, we identified dysregulated PRGs and stratified PC into two 
molecularly distinct subtypes via unsupervised clustering. These subtypes 
exhibited divergent clinical outcomes, immune microenvironment heterogeneity 
(e.g., Dendritic cells, CD8+ T cells, and Macrophages infiltration), and 
distinct drug sensitivity profiles. Single-cell RNA sequencing further localized 
key PRGs-ZDHHC2, ZDHHC5, ZDHHC15, ZDHHC9, and LYPLA1-within tumor cell 
populations, linking their expression to immune evasion and metabolic 
reprogramming. A robust diagnostic model, integrating 101 machine learning 
algorithms, demonstrated high predictive accuracy for survival and immunotherapy 
response. Functional validation in DU145 cells confirmed that modulating these 
PRGs significantly suppressed proliferation and colony formation, highlighting 
their pathobiological relevance. Collectively, this multidimensional analysis 
delineates a comprehensive framework for understanding palmitoylation-driven 
oncogenesis and establishes a precision medicine toolkit for risk stratification 
and treatment optimization in PC.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in cancer progression, 
metastasis, immune evasion, and treatment resistance. However, the current 
literature often studies its components separately. This review offers an 
integrated view of the dynamic interactions among fibroblasts, immune and 
vascular cells, the extracellular matrix, cytokines, exosomes, and microbiota 
within the TME. It discusses classical mechanisms such as epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition, stromal remodeling, and metabolic rewiring alongside emerging 
paradigms like microbiome-driven immunomodulation and exosome-mediated therapy 
resistance. Spatial heterogeneity and the temporal evolution of the tumor niche 
are examined using recent advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, 
3D bioprinting, and patient-derived organoid models. Key findings emphasize the 
microbiome's influence on immune responses and the role of exosomes in 
transferring resistance traits and regulating intercellular signaling. By 
connecting molecular insights with clinical perspectives, the review explores 
translational strategies targeting the TME, including checkpoint inhibitors, 
stromal modulators, anti-angiogenic agents, and engineered CAR-T therapies. This 
comprehensive view highlights the importance of considering cancer as a complex, 
evolving ecosystem rather than just a cell-autonomous disease and provides a 
foundational framework for precision oncology approaches aimed at disrupting 
harmful TME interactions to improve therapeutic effectiveness and patient 
outcomes.

In this study, zirconium oxide nanoparticles (ZrO2 NPs) were synthesized using 
astaxanthin (AST) rich extract (AZ) and subsequently conjugated with multiwalled 
carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (AZM) and functionalized with folic acid (FA) (FAZM) 
to develop a cancer-targeting nanocomposite with enhanced anticancer efficacy. 
The physicochemical properties of the synthesized materials were characterized 
using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), 
electrophoretic light scattering (ELS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier 
transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). FAZM exhibited the highest antioxidant 
activity, with IC50 values of 822.78 μg/mL against ABTS and 320.70 μg/mL against 
DPPH free radicals. Biocompatibility assessments revealed that FAZM exhibited 
little cytotoxicity in normal human skin cells and demonstrated improved 
hemocompatibility, as confirmed by a hemolysis assay. Furthermore, FAZM 
significantly inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, 
inducing apoptosis and exhibiting potent cytotoxic effects (IC50: 115.84 μg/mL). 
These findings suggest that FA and MWCNTs enhance the cancer-targeting 
capability of AZ while maximizing its selective cytotoxicity against cancer 
cells. This study highlights that FA-functionalized MWCNT-conjugated ZrO2 NPs 
are a promising nanoplatform as an AST delivery system for targeted cancer 
therapy.

AIM: The aim of this study was to develop a simple and reliable scoring system 
for colorectal cancer risk assessment considering the effectiveness of different 
screening options.
BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of 
cancer-related mortality worldwide. As a preventable disease, accurate risk 
assessment plays a critical role in early detection and prevention strategies.
METHODS: This study analyzed data from 3,465 individuals, including patients, 
first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree relatives of patients, and 
volunteers participating in a national CRC screening program. The dataset 
reflects nine years of prevention efforts targeting at-risk populations. Machine 
learning algorithms-Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Neural Networks, Random 
Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)-were applied to the data. Model 
performance was evaluated using cross-validation, ROC curves, F1 score, 
classification accuracy (CA), and overall accuracy metrics.
RESULTS: Of the 3,465 participants, 2,240 were diagnosed with colorectal cancer, 
60 were relatives of affected patients, and 1,086 were non-patient relatives. 
Among CRC patients, 1,979 were over the age of 40. Logistic Regression and Naïve 
Bayes achieved the highest AUC values (0.910 and 0.907, respectively), with 
corresponding accuracies of 84.5% and 82.8%. Logistic Regression demonstrated 
the highest overall accuracy. The proposed scoring system incorporated variables 
such as age, sex, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), smoking, alcohol 
consumption, tobacco use, BMI, family history, and five key symptoms: rectal 
bleeding, abdominal pain, unintended weight loss, changes in bowel habits, and 
anemia. The highest score was assigned to individuals over 60 years of age, 
while a score of 2 was allocated for a family history involving more than two 
affected relatives.
CONCLUSION: A scoring system based on easily measurable variables offers a 
practical and efficient tool for widespread clinical use. Such systems can 
assist healthcare professionals in streamlining risk assessment and improving 
early identification of high-risk individuals.

Psycho-Socio-Behavioural Substrates of Non-Cancer Chronic Pain: A Twin Study in 
Italian Adults.

BACKGROUND: Chronic pain (CP) is a debilitating condition characterized by pain 
lasting longer than three months, significantly impairing physical, emotional, 
and social functioning. Comorbidities such as depression can exacerbate the 
severity and persistence of CP, leading to greater functional impairment and 
diminished quality of life. Characterizing the psycho-socio-behavioural 
substrates of CP is crucial for improving treatment and prevention strategies 
based on multidisciplinary approaches.
METHODS: The study sample included 750 monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin 
pairs aged 18-82 years, enrolled in the Italian Twin Registry. Non-cancer 
CP-related characteristics (ie, CP occurrence, intensity and body location) as 
well as depressive symptomatology, sleep quality and perceived social support 
were assessed by validated self-report questionnaires. The twin study 
methodology was applied to control for genetic and shared environmental 
confounding while estimating the association of CP with psycho-socio-behavioural 
variables.
DATA ANALYSIS: Individual-level and intrapair-level regression were used to 
estimate the association of CP with psycho-socio-behavioural variables. 
Biometrical structural equation modelling and mediation analysis were performed 
to shed light on the etiological mechanisms underlying this association.
RESULTS: As regards CP and depressive symptomatology, individual-level 
association in the total sample of twins and intrapair-level associations in MZ 
and DZ pairs discordant for CP were all significant and of similar magnitudes, 
possibly consistent with a quasi-causal relationship. Under the best-fitting 
biometrical structural equation model, unique environmental factors explained 
73% (95% CI: 19-100%) of phenotypic correlation between CP and depressive 
symptoms. Life satisfaction and sleep quality resulted to mediate the 
association between CP and depression, with a global indirect effect from CP to 
depression of 0.32 (0.22-0.44).
CONCLUSION: This study provides insights into the relationship of CP with 
depression, suggesting a quasi-causal connection between them, an important 
contribution of unique environmental factors in this connection, and a mediating 
role of sleep quality and subjective wellbeing.

BACKGROUND: Rising cancer incidence in reproductive-aged individuals, coupled 
with improved long-term survival, indicates an increasing need for fertility 
preservation (FP) in this population. However, limited evidence exists on the 
decision-making of FP from the perspectives of cancer patients in a Chinese 
context. This qualitative study aimed to examine the patient perceptions of the 
FP decision and to identify barriers and unmet needs, addressing a significant 
gap within evolving precision oncology and fertility care contexts.
METHODS: Face-to-face, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 cancer 
patients from a tertiary hospital in Hunan Province, China, from March 2024 to 
June 2024. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and 
analyzed thematically using Colaizzi's seven-step analysis.
RESULTS: Three themes and nine subthemes were identified: insufficient 
information support (lack of information sources, inappropriate timing of 
information disclosure, and poor doctor-patient communication); personal and 
family concerns (impact on cancer treatment, impact on offspring health, marital 
and reproductive status, financial constraints); ethical dilemmas (conflicts 
with survival needs, and emotional challenges).
CONCLUSION: Young cancer patients predominantly aspire to preserve fertility but 
face multiple decision-making challenges. To address these challenges, 
healthcare professionals should fully understand the patients' needs, provide 
accurate and timely information tailored to their needs, and enhance 
communication skills to facilitate informed decision-making regarding FP, with 
important implications for clinical practice and public health.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and prognostic factors of GEMOX 
(gemcitabine and oxaliplatin) combined with Tislelizumab in patients with 
advanced Gallbladder cancer (GBC). 150 patients with stage III-IV GBC were 
divided into two groups: 88 received GEMOX alone, and 62 received GEMOX combined 
with Tislelizumab. Clinical characteristics, treatment responses, 
progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and adverse events were 
analysed. The combination group showed improved median OS (13.35 vs. 
10.26 months, HR = 0.530, 95% CI: 0.357-0.786) and PFS (7.28 vs. 5.18 months, HR 
= 0.393, 95% CI: 0.278-0.555). The disease control rate (DCR) and objective 
response rate (ORR) were significantly higher in the combination group (DCR: 
83.87% vs. 67.05%, P = 0.021; ORR: 40.32% vs. 20.45%, P = 0.008). Multivariate 
analysis identified TNM stage, CA19-9 status, CPS score, tumour diameter, and 
lesion multiplicity as independent prognostic factors for OS. GEMOX combined 
with Tislelizumab may improve survival outcomes in patients with advanced GBC.

Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a novel anti-tumor approach that offers the 
advantages of deep penetration, high therapeutic efficacy, and minimal damage to 
normal tissues. However, the organic sonosensitizers tetraphenylporphyrin can 
inhibit the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to the 
intermolecular π-π stacking effect, resulting in a poor SDT effect. SDT 
utilizing oxygen-dependent sonosensitizers are frequently limited by the hypoxic 
microenvironment characteristic of solid tumors. Herein, we have successfully 
developed an enhanced SDT self oxygen supplying delivery system based on 
cyclodextrin polyrotaxane to inhibit the π-π stacking effect between 
tetraphenylporphyrin molecules and improve the hypoxic microenvironment. A 
""one-stone-two-birds"" strategy was proposed. On one hand, the spatial effect of 
cyclodextrin and polyrotaxane was utilized to enhance the yield of ROS from the 
sonosensitizers agent porphyrin. On the other hand, the GOx and manganese 
dioxide nanozyme were loaded onto polyrotaxane through electrostatic adsorption, 
enabling the reversal of hypoxic environment at the tumor site through a cascade 
reaction. Ultimately, the prepared polyrotaxane nanoparticles, combined with 
targeted accumulation to enhance SDT efficacy and starvation therapy, resulted 
in a 76 % suppression of tumor growth. This study develops an innovative 
approach to enhance SDT performance of tetraphenylporphyrin via cyclodextrin 
polyrotaxane spatial effects, while offering a novel strategy to alleviate tumor 
hypoxia.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical outcomes and patterns of failure in patients 
with paranasal sinus cancer treated by proton therapy during 2013-2022.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective study included 88 patients with newly 
diagnosed nonmetastatic paranasal sinus cancer treated by proton therapy at a 
tertiary academic cancer center from August 2013 to November 2022. Fifteen 
patients were treated by three-dimensional conformal proton technique (3DCPT) 
and 73 patients were treated by intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT). The 
main outcomes were the long-term toxicity, patterns of failure and survival 
outcomes, including cumulative incidence of local or regional failures (LRF) and 
overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: The median (interquartile range [IQR]) follow-up time for the overall 
group was 57.3 (38.5-82.6) months. Acute grade 3 radiation dermatitis and late 
grade 3 nasal congestion occurred significantly more frequently in the 3DCPT 
group compared to the IMPT group (20.0% vs. 4.1%, p = 0.008; 33.3% vs. 5.6%, 
p = 0.004, respectively). By the last follow-up, 33 patients had developed 
treatment failures. A total of 21 patients (23.9%) developed local failures, 14 
were considered in-field failure; 4 were marginal; 3 were out-of-field failure. 
The 5y-cumulative incidence of LRF and OS rate of the overall group were 25% 
[95% confidence interval (CI), 16-35] and 79.4% (70.2-89.8), respectively. There 
were no statistically significant differences following 3DCPT and IMPT in 
cumulative incidence of LRF and OS.
CONCLUSIONS: Proton therapy yielded excellent therapeutic outcomes in the 
management of paranasal sinus cancer. IMPT holds significant potential in 
enhancing the therapeutic ratio in paranasal sinus cancer and warrants further 
exploration in clinical settings.

Cuproptosis, characterized by the accumulation of copper (Cu) ions and 
mitochondrial respiration modulation, holds great potential in cancer therapy. 
As a newly defined mode of cell death regulation, the mechanisms of copper 
efflux and high intracellular levels of reducing substances may impair 
cuproptosis efficacy. To address this, a nanocomposite designated POM/Cu-SS@HA 
was constructed, comprising sandwich-type polyoxometalate (POM) 
Na[(CH3)2NH2]13H[Sc3(H2O)2Te2W24O90]·92H2O (Sc3Te2W24), disulfide-bridged 
copper-based complexes (Cu-SS), and hyaluronic acid (HA) for targeted delivery. 
This system induces cuproptosis through copper accumulation, leading to 
lipoylated protein aggregation and iron-sulfur cluster protein depletion, while 
concurrently facilitating photothermal therapy (PTT) and apoptosis. The POM 
(Sc3Te2W24) cluster exhibited potent antitumor effects via p53-dependent 
apoptotic pathway reactivation. In vitro studies demonstrated over 85.6% 
inhibition rate against 4T1 breast cancer cells when combining POM/Cu-SS@HA with 
808 nm NIR irradiation. In vivo results showed 92.8% tumor growth suppression 
compared to the controls. Transcriptome analysis further identified altered 
expression profiles in glutathione (GSH) metabolism and mitochondrial 
function-related genes, confirming the dual induction of cuproptosis and 
apoptosis. These findings establish a synergistic nanotherapeutic strategy with 
enhanced efficacy for breast cancer treatment.

Breast cancer progression is closely associated with hypoxia, which severely 
limits the efficacy of conventional therapy. In addition, the lack of real-time 
imaging hampers accurate monitoring of therapeutic processes, further reducing 
treatment precision and efficacy. Here, the rational design of a multifunctional 
nanoplatform that integrates hypoxia relief, dual-modality imaging, and 
synergistic therapy to overcome these barriers is reported. Mesoporous 
polydopamine nanoparticles are engineered and sequentially functionalized with 
the sonosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6), oxygen-generating manganese dioxide, and 
the targeting antibody cetuximab, yielding MPDA-Ce6@MnO2-C225 (MCMC NPs). This 
construct exhibits a uniform nanoflower-like architecture, high Ce6 
encapsulation efficiency, and robust oxygen supply capacity. By simultaneously 
enhancing reactive oxygen species generation and chemodynamic activity, MCMC NPs 
achieve potent SDT/CDT synergy under ultrasound activation. Importantly, they 
provide sensitive dual-modality fluorescence and magnetic resonance (MR) 
imaging, enabling real-time monitoring of nanoparticle distribution and 
therapeutic response. In vitro studies confirm excellent biocompatibility, 
targeted uptake by 4T1 breast cancer cells, and significant MRI signal 
enhancement. In vivo, MCMC NPs effectively alleviate tumor hypoxia, markedly 
suppress tumor growth, and prolong therapeutic response. This study establishes 
MCMC NPs as a versatile nanotheranostic platform that integrates imaging with 
oxygen-augmented SDT/CDT, offering a promising strategy for precise and 
effective breast cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: Caregivers of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survivors 
face high risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but lack psychosocial 
support. Digital health tools may offer scalable solutions to address caregiver 
distress. This pilot study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and 
preliminary efficacy of Cancer Distress Coach-Caregiver (CaDC-C), an app 
designed to reduce PTSD symptoms in cancer caregivers.
METHOD: This report focuses on the first-stage intervention of a larger 
Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART). Participants were 
initially randomized to receive CaDC-C or Usual Care (i.e., offered psychosocial 
services available at their respective institutions). Assessments were conducted 
at baseline and Week 4, and those with no meaningful symptom improvement at Week 
4 were re-randomized to higher-intensity interventions. While details about the 
second-stage randomization will be reported separately, here we report on 
acceptability of CaDC-C use at Week 14.
RESULTS: Forty-four caregivers consented to participate, N = 36 completed Week 4 
surveys (82% retention) and N = 31 completed Week 14 surveys (70% retention). 
Our post-intervention acceptability benchmark was achieved at Week 14 with 78.9% 
(n = 15) endorsing at least moderate satisfaction. Additionally, most reported 
CaDC-C enhanced their knowledge of PTSD and caregiving (84.2%, n = 16), 
explained their symptoms (78.9%, n = 15), and provided practical solutions to 
their problems (68.4%, n = 13). At Week 4, 81% (n = 13) reported a clinically 
meaningful reduction in PTSD symptoms (≥ 5 decrease in PCL-5 score). CaDC-C 
participants also demonstrated a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms at 
Week 4 (p = 0.02).
DISCUSSION: This pilot demonstrates the feasibility, acceptability, and 
preliminary efficacy of CaDC-C as a first-line intervention for PTSD symptoms in 
cancer caregivers. Future research should evaluate outcomes from 
higher-intensity interventions and determine the efficacy of CaDC-C in larger, 
more diverse samples.

Arginine, a critical amino acid for protein structure and function, is involved 
in enzyme catalysis and macromolecular interactions. However, selectively 
targeting its reactive guanidine group has been challenging. Here, we utilized a 
probe, AP-1, based on phenylglyoxal, which demonstrated remarkable chemical 
selectivity and reactivity toward arginine residues. Using activity-based 
protein profiling (ABPP), we explored the human proteome across four cancer cell 
lines, obtaining quantitative data for approximately 17 000 arginine residues. 
This analysis led to the identification of several previously unreported 
hyperreactive arginine residues, including R43 of PKM, R171 of LDHA, R172 of 
LDHB, R341 of CKB, R168 of EIF4A1, and R118 of FUBP1, which are crucial for 
protein function. Notably, the mutation of CKB's R341 inhibited cell 
proliferation and migration by downregulating energy supply. We also introduced 
ArGO-LDHA-1, a covalent inhibitor targeting LDHA's hyperreactive arginine 
residues, showing potential to enhance chemotherapy efficacy. This work 
highlights the biological significance of arginine residues and provides a 
platform for large-scale profiling of arginine reactivity.

Bacterial infections have been implicated in shaping the tumor microenvironment 
(TME), but their effects on cancer cell proteomes remain unexplored. In this 
study, we analyzed proteomic changes in melanoma (A375) and ovarian cancer 
(OVCAR3) cell line models following infection with Staphylococcus aureus strain 
USA300 or Salmonella enterica strain SL1344 using mass spectrometry-based 
label-free quantitative proteomics. Bacterial infection leads to widespread 
changes in host protein expression in the cancer cells, with levels of proteins 
involved in mitochondrial metabolism, RNA processing, and cellular stress 
response all increasing in relative abundance. In contrast, proteins involved in 
DNA repair, cytoskeletal structure, vesicle trafficking, and cell cycle 
regulation were consistently downregulated. The magnitude of the observed 
changes varied by the cancer cell type. Understanding these interactions may 
provide new directions for the role of bacteria in tumor progression and 
therapeutic resistance.

Cancer metastasis and postoperative recurrence continue to pose significant 
challenges in the treatment of advanced-stage cancer, highlighting the urgent 
necessity for early diagnosis and precise intraoperative identification of 
lesions. In this study, we synthesized a series of molecules derived from the 
traditional nucleic acid probe thiazole orange (TO), by incorporating alkyl 
chains of varying lengths and hydrophilic functional groups. Among them, the 
specific lipophilicity of TO-Ac (a derivative of TO) enables its penetration 
into cancer cells, where it binds to nucleic acids and generates intense 
fluorescence, while being effectively excluded by normal cell membranes. The 
differential cholesterol content in cell plasma membranes was confirmed to 
influence the selective uptake of molecules in cancer cells. Accordingly, we 
established a quantitative design criterion (LogP = 1.48-1.62) that predicts 
cancer cell specificity based on oil-water partition coefficients. Finally, 
TO-Ac was successfully applied for detection of early-stage colon cancer, 
enabling complete tumor resection via fluorescence imaging while identifying 
lesions that would otherwise remain undetected. This passive targeting strategy 
fundamentally challenges the conventional paradigm of ligand-modified probes, 
offering a transformative approach for the development of universal tumor 
identification systems.

Multimodal imaging-guided precision therapy has emerged as a cutting-edge 
theranostic strategy that integrates real-time diagnostic feedback with 
precision therapeutic intervention in a single platform, significantly enhancing 
treatment efficacy and minimizing off-target effects. Herein, Ir(III)-Gd(III) 
heterometallic complexes (Ir2Gd1) that exhibit exceptional mitochondrial 
targeting capabilities and magneto-optical bifunctional properties are designed 
and synthesized. As a single-molecule theranostic agent, Ir2Gd1 serves as a 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent with high relaxivity (9.42 mM-1 
s-1), while its intrinsic phosphorescence facilitates both optical imaging and 
phototherapy. Notably, Ir2Gd1 can selectively accumulate within cancer cell 
mitochondria. Upon light irradiation, it generates singlet oxygen, which 
disrupts mitochondrial integrity by inducing cytochrome c release, thereby 
activating apoptosis or pyroptosis pathways. Additionally, Ir2Gd1 
photocatalytically oxidizes NADH, disrupting the mitochondrial electron 
transport chain and depleting ATP, further impairing cellular energy metabolism. 
Mechanistic investigations further reveal that Ir2Gd1 activates the 
caspase-3/GSDME signaling axis to induce pyroptosis, a mechanism crucial for 
overcoming apoptosis resistance and triggering anti-tumor immune responses. 
Collectively, Ir2Gd1 functions as a ""Mito-Bomb"" that targets cancer cells' 
central powerhouse, executing focused detonation to achieve potent antitumor 
efficacy. This study presents a novel single-molecule theranostic tool for tumor 
phototherapy and pyroptosis guided by magneto-optical dual-modal imaging.

The association between mycotoxins and esophageal cancer (EC) risk remains 
poorly understood, highlighting the need for evidence from population-based 
prospective studies. We conducted a case-cohort study nested within the Taizhou 
Longitudinal Study to investigate this relationship, analyzing baseline urinary 
mycotoxins in 866 randomly selected subcohort members and 240 incident EC cases 
(including seven cases from the subcohort). Using ultra-high performance liquid 
chromatography-triple quadrupole-tandem mass spectrometry, we measured three 
mycotoxins: ochratoxin A (OTA), T-2 toxin (T-2), and fumonisin B1 (FB1). While 
FB1 was detectable in over 88% of urine samples, OTA and T-2 were detected in 
less than 30% of samples. EC cases showed slightly higher detection rates for 
all three mycotoxins compared to the subcohort subjects. Weighted Cox 
proportional hazards regression analyses for case-cohort studies revealed that, 
after adjusting for potential confounders, the urinary levels of three 
mycotoxins-OTA (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.73-1.56), T-2 (HR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.51-2.00), and FB1 (HR = 0.94, 95% CI: 
0.53-1.64)-as well as co-exposure to these three mycotoxins (HR = 1.33, 95% CI: 
0.34-5.28), showed no significant association with EC risk. These results 
remained consistent even after excluding the first 2 years of follow-up to 
minimize the influence of potential reverse causation. Our case-cohort study 
found no clear associations between urinary mycotoxins-OTA, T-2, or FB1-and EC 
risk in the studied population.

The circadian clock is a highly conserved timekeeping system in organisms, which 
maintains physiological homeostasis by precisely regulating periodic 
fluctuations in gene expression. Substantial clinical and experimental evidence 
has established a close association between circadian rhythm disruption and the 
development of various malignancies. Research has revealed characteristic 
alterations in the circadian gene expression profiles in tumor tissues, 
primarily manifested as a dysfunction of core clock components (particularly 
circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) and brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 
(BMAL1)) and the widespread dysregulation of their downstream target genes. 
Notably, CLOCK demonstrates non-canonical oncogenic functions, including 
epigenetic regulation via histone acetyltransferase activity and the 
circadian-independent modulation of cancer pathways. This review systematically 
elaborates on the oncogenic mechanisms mediated by CLOCK/BMAL1, encompassing 
multidimensional effects such as cell cycle control, DNA damage response, 
metabolic reprogramming, and tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling. Regarding 
the therapeutic strategies, we focus on cutting-edge approaches such as 
chrononutritional interventions, chronopharmacological modulation, and treatment 
regimen optimization, along with a discussion of future perspectives. The 
research breakthroughs highlighted in this work not only deepen our 
understanding of the crucial role of circadian regulation in cancer biology but 
also provide novel insights for the development of chronotherapeutic oncology, 
particularly through targeting the non-canonical functions of circadian proteins 
to develop innovative anti-cancer strategies.

BACKGROUND: Hepatic metastases from epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) represent an 
advanced disease stage, yet national guidelines provide no standardized 
recommendations for liver resection. This study aimed to describe the national 
trends and patterns of hepatic resections in EOC patients based on German 
hospital billing data (DRG system) from 2020 to 2024.
METHODS: A retrospective epidemiological analysis was conducted using InEK 
(Institute for Hospital Remuneration Systems) datasets from 2020 to 2024. We 
extracted data related to diagnosis ICD code C56 (malignant neoplasm of the 
ovary) and OPS codes for hepatic resections (5-501.0, 5-502.0, 5-502.2, 5-502.3, 
5-502.4, 5-502.5, 5-502.6). Case numbers, procedure frequency, hospital 
characteristics, and DRG classifications were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 1,273 hepatic resections were performed in patients with 
ovarian cancer between 2020 and 2024. Annual case numbers ranged from 225 to 
283, indicating stable surgical practice over time. Local excisions / atypical 
resections accounted for the majority (n = 1,165; 91%), while segmentectomies 
(n = 85; 6.7%) and major resections (n = 23; 1.8%) were less frequent but 
consistently performed. Age group analysis showed that the largest proportion of 
patients undergoing hepatic resection were aged 65-74 years (range 23%-27% 
yearly). followed by the 60-64 and 55-59 age groups. Younger patients (< 40 
years) represented less than 5%. Most procedures (54.6%) were conducted in 
public hospitals with ≥ 1000 beds, with additional contributions from private 
non-profit (20.9%) and private for-profit (10.5%) institutions. A gradual 
increase in the share of private institutions was observed over time. The mean 
hospital stay varied by resection type: 16.7 days for local excisions, 17.1 days 
for segmentectomies, and 20.1 days for major resections.
CONCLUSION: Hepatic resection for ovarian cancer is performed regularly in 
Germany, primarily at high-volume centers, suggesting a growing clinical 
acceptance of aggressive cytoreduction strategies despite the absence of formal 
recommendations. Our findings underline the need for prospective, multicenter 
studies and guideline updates addressing hepatic metastases in ovarian cancer.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC) remains a significant global health challenge 
for women, especially in advanced stages where effective treatments are limited. 
Current immunotherapies, including PD-1/PD-L1 blockades and adoptive T cell 
therapies, show limited response rates and durability. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), 
an FDA-approved drug for autoimmune diseases, has demonstrated direct antitumor 
activity in several cancers. However, its influence on anti-tumor immunity and 
its function in CC remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the 
therapeutic potential of DMF in CC models and elucidate its underlying 
mechanisms of action.
METHODS: CC cell lines and mouse models were treated with DMF. Transcriptomics 
profiling of cervical cancer cells following DMF treatment were analyzed by 
RNA-seq and bioinformatic methods. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release, and 
cGAS-STING activation were assessed via qPCR, immunofluorescence, immunoblotting 
and ELISA. CD8+ T cell recruitment was analyzed by flow cytometry. Combinatorial 
therapies (DMF + anti-PD-1/TILs) were tested in syngeneic or patient-derived 
xenografts (PDX) models.
RESULTS: DMF treatment induces mitochondrial dysfunction in tumor cells, 
resulting in the release of mtDNA into the cytosol. The cytosolic mtDNA in turn 
activates the cGAS-STING-TBK1 pathway and type I interferon response, leading to 
the secretion of CCL5 and CXCL10, thereby enhancing CD8⁺ T cell infiltration. 
Additionally, DMF exhibits synergistic effect with PD-1 blockade in murine CC 
model, and can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of adoptively transferred T 
cells toward CC in patient-derived xenografts model.
CONCLUSION: This work elucidated that DMF reprograms CC cells to activate the 
mtDNA-cGAS-STING pathway, fostering a chemokine-rich microenvironment that 
recruits CD8+ T cells. The synergistic effect of DMF and PD-1 blockade or TIL 
therapy underscores its potential as an immunostimulatory adjuvant. These 
findings suggest that DMF holds promise as a novel immunotherapeutic strategy 
for improving clinical outcomes in CC.

BACKGROUND: Aberrant upregulation of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription and 
its dedicated machinery plays a pivotal role in tumor progression and 
chemoresistance. RRN3, a Pol I-specific transcription initiation factor, is 
frequently overexpressed in malignancies contributing to oncogenic processes. 
Despite the therapeutic potential of Pol I transcription inhibition, existing 
inhibitors lack specificity and are associated with DNA damage, mutagenicity, 
and toxicity, limiting their clinical utility. To fully realize the potential of 
Pol I-targeted cancer therapies, selective Pol I transcription inhibitors with 
minimal off-target effects are essential.
METHODS: Molecular docking and virtual screening were conducted to identify 
ligands targeting RRN3. Biochemical and spectroscopic analyses validated the 
direct ligand-RRN3 binding. The mechanism of action of the ligand was 
investigated through biochemical, cellular and molecular assays. Functional 
studies assessed the effects of the ligand on cancer cell viability, 
clonogenicity, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis, in comparison to 
non-cancerous cells. The ligand efficacy was further evaluated in chemoresistant 
cancer cell lines and 3D tumor spheroid models. Genotoxicity and mutagenicity 
were assessed using DNA damage and mutagenicity assays.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that 
(N-(1-amidino-2-thiourea-alkyl-7-chloroquinoline-4-amine)) (NSH76) selectively 
inhibits Pol I transcription by disrupting the Pol I pre-initiation complex at 
the rDNA promoter through direct RRN3 binding. Notably, NSH76 does not affect 
cMyc expression, a Pol II-driven transcript, confirming its specificity. NSH76 
preferentially inhibits Pol I transcription in cancer cells with high RRN3 
expression, while sparing non-cancerous cells with low RRN3 levels. 
Functionally, NSH76 exhibits potent antiproliferative activity against cancer 
cells, with minimal impact on non-cancerous cells. NSH76 induces cell cycle 
arrest, suppresses clonogenicity, and significantly enhances apoptosis in cancer 
cells, including cisplatin- and doxorubicin-resistant cell lines. These effects 
are recapitulated in 3D tumor spheroid assays. Furthermore, NSH76 triggers 
nucleolar stress, leading to the activation of tumor suppressors p53 and p21. 
Notably, NSH76 does not induce DNA damage or mutagenicity.
CONCLUSION: These findings establish NSH76 as a potent and selective Pol I 
inhibitor with significant therapeutic potential in cancer and possible 
implications for overcoming chemoresistance.

BACKGROUND: The Telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2) binds to TTAGGG repeats 
located at chromosomes ends and ensures telomere protection together with the 
other members of shelterin. In addition to its well-known role in telomere 
maintenance, TRF2 can also bind to interstitial telomeric sequences and regulate 
the expression of specific genes with a consequent impact on tumor formation and 
progression. However, a comprehensive analysis of the impact of TRF2 on global 
gene expression of human cancer cells and of the underlying mechanisms is still 
lacking.
METHODS: The integration of omics technologies (RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), 
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq), interactomics, and microRNA (miRNA) 
profiling) was used to deeply investigate the extra-telomeric role of TRF2. 
Differential gene expression and binding sites of TRF2 were confirmed by qRT-PCR 
while the interaction of TRF2 with TATA-box binding protein associated factor 15 
(TAF15) was validated by immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay. 
Finally, target specificity was assessed by luciferase assay and western 
blotting while biological effects were investigated by cell migration analysis 
(unpaired t tests was used to calculate statistical significance).
RESULTS: We found that TRF2 impinges on the expression of 717 genes involved in 
various cancer-related pathways. Unexpectedly, just a small portion of 
Differentially Regulated genes are directly bound by TRF2, suggesting the 
existence of alternative mechanisms of TRF2-mediated gene regulation. In 
particular, we found that TRF2 binds to various noncoding RNA regions and 
interacts with many RNA binding proteins, supporting TRF2's involvement in 
noncoding RNA-mediated mechanisms. Through the intersection of omics-analyses, 
we provided here experimental evidence of a multilayered mechanism of regulation 
where TRF2, interacting with TAF15, regulates miR-181A1 host gene and mature 
miR-181a-5p expression, which in turn targets S100A10, a known plasma membrane 
protein with oncogenic role.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work shows, for the first time, a broad overview on the 
extra-telomeric role of TRF2 in human cancer, further revealing a new axis 
through which TRF2 contributes to cancer progression.

While mammography screening programmes improve early detection and reduce 
mortality for individuals aged 50-74, its extension to those aged 40-49 remains 
debated. In Canada, breast screening eligibility varies between 
provinces/territories, with Ontario lowering its eligibility age from 50 to 40 
in 2024. This commentary examines recent evidence, including observational 
studies and simulation models, suggesting that mammography screening from age 40 
may offer net benefits. Additionally, using data from Ontario Health (Cancer 
Care Ontario), we compared stage at diagnosis and 5-year survival rates among 
18,639 women aged 40-51 diagnosed with breast cancer (2009-2017). Individuals 
aged 40-49 had comparable stage at diagnosis and 5-year survival rates to 
unscreened individuals aged 50-51. Meanwhile, screened individuals aged 50-51 
demonstrated the earliest stage at diagnosis and highest 5-year survival rate. 
Our analysis illustrates the arbitrary nature of an age-based screening 
threshold at 50. We demonstrate that outcomes for women aged 40-49 resemble 
those of unscreened women aged 50-51, who were just above the eligibility 
cutoff. While expanding screening may increase upfront costs, these could be 
offset by avoiding late-stage treatments and integrating risk-stratified 
approaches. Overall, women in their 40s may benefit from organized screening 
programs through earlier detection and improved survival.

Publisher: RéSUMé: Bien que les programmes de dépistage par mammographie 
améliorent la détection précoce et réduisent la mortalité chez les personnes 
âgées de 50 à 74 ans, leur extension aux femmes de 40 à 49 ans fait encore 
l’objet de débats. Au Canada, l’admissibilité au dépistage du cancer du sein 
varie selon les provinces et territoires, et l’Ontario a abaissé l’âge 
d’admissibilité de 50 à 40 ans en 2024. Ce commentaire examine des données 
récentes, incluant des études observationnelles et des modèles de simulation, 
suggérant que le dépistage dès 40 ans pourrait offrir des bénéfices nets. De 
plus, à partir des données d’Ontario Santé (Action Cancer Ontario), nous avons 
comparé le stade au diagnostic et les taux de survie à cinq ans chez 18 639 
femmes âgées de 40 à 51 ans ayant reçu un diagnostic de cancer du sein entre 
2009 et 2017. Les femmes de 40 à 49 ans présentaient des stades de diagnostic et 
des taux de survie similaires à ceux des femmes de 50 à 51 ans non dépistées. En 
revanche, les femmes de 50 à 51 ans dépistées présentaient les stades les plus 
précoces au diagnostic et les meilleurs taux de survie à cinq ans. Notre analyse 
illustre le caractère arbitraire du seuil d’âge de 50 ans pour l’admissibilité 
au dépistage. Nous avons montré que les résultats des femmes de 40 à 49 ans 
ressemblent à ceux des femmes non dépistées de 50 à 51 ans, juste au-dessus du 
seuil. Bien que l’élargissement du dépistage puisse entraîner des coûts initiaux 
plus élevés, ceux-ci pourraient être compensés par une réduction des traitements 
à un stade avancé et l’intégration d’approches fondées sur le risque. 
Globalement, les femmes dans la quarantaine pourraient bénéficier de programmes 
de dépistage organisés grâce à une détection plus précoce et une survie 
améliorée.

INTRODUCTION: Subcutaneous (SC) formulations of oncology therapies could provide 
time-saving benefits for both patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) 
compared with intravenous (IV) delivery. This prospective observational study, 
conducted alongside the MK-3475A-D77 phase 3, open-label randomized clinical 
trial, quantifies HCP and patient time with pembrolizumab SC versus 
pembrolizumab IV among patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
METHODS: Seventeen sites across eight countries in Europe (n = 4), South America 
(n = 3), and Asia (n = 1) were enrolled. Primary endpoints were active HCP time; 
patient time in the treatment chair, treatment room, and healthcare facility; 
and consumables usage. Descriptive statistics included weighted mean (WM), and a 
linear mixed model (LMM) was employed to explore differences in time measures 
between pembrolizumab SC and pembrolizumab IV per visit.
RESULTS: Overall, 212 observations were analyzed (153 SC and 59 IV). Total 
active HCP time was reduced by 45.6% with SC versus IV (WM, 14.0 vs 25.8 min); 
HCPs spent 44.3% less time on the drug preparation process with SC versus IV 
(WM, 5.1 vs 9.1 min) and 46.3% less time on the drug administration process with 
SC versus IV (WM, 8.9 vs 16.7 min). Patient chair time was reduced by 49.6% with 
SC versus IV (WM, 59.0 vs 117.2 min). Patients receiving SC spent less time in 
the treatment room than those receiving IV (WM, 66.7 vs 126.9 min; difference 
- 47.4%). Exploratory LMM showed considerable between-group differences for 
active HCP time and patient time in the treatment chair and treatment room.
CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab SC substantially reduces active HCP time and patient 
chair time versus pembrolizumab IV. Time liberated for HCPs could be reallocated 
toward additional patient care activities, while optimized chair utilization 
could improve overall healthcare efficiency.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an innovative and minimally invasive approach that 
has attracted considerable attention and interest in the medical community in 
recent years. The technique is primarily used to treat tumors and has received 
official approval for the management of several types of cancer. The process 
involves the injection of specialized light-sensitive materials into the body. 
Subsequently, when light of an optimal wavelength (the wavelength at which the 
photosensitizer is best absorbed and penetrates the tissue) is directed at these 
materials, it causes the production of reactive oxygen species. These reactive 
oxygen species play an important role in inducing cellular damage that 
ultimately leads to the death of cancer cells. Therefore, this treatment 
modality is based on three fundamental principles. This review comprehensively 
examines the fundamental principles governing PDT, with a specific focus on 
photosensitizer design, irradiation parameters, and tumor microenvironment 
oxygenation. A critical analysis of each component is provided, underscoring 
their collective importance in optimizing PDT efficacy for oncological 
applications.

Colon cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality, with 
liver metastasis commonly complicating its progression and significantly 
worsening patient prognosis. This study aims to explore the relationship between 
liver metastasis in colon cancer and various clinicopathological factors, as 
well as to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. The clinical data 
and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were used to identify 
key genes associated with liver metastasis. The results revealed significant 
alterations in lipid metabolism associated with colon cancer progression. 
Notably, WGCNA and machine learning algorithms identified cardiolipin synthase 1 
(CRLS1) as a hub gene robustly associated with liver metastasis in colon cancer. 
The expression of CRLS1 was assessed via scRNA-seq and the collection of 
clinical samples from colon cancer patients. CRLS1 knockdown significantly 
inhibited the proliferation and migration of colon cancer cells and suppressed 
lipid metabolism. Finally, several candidate drugs have been identified that may 
effectively target CRLS1. Moreover, it has been confirmed that the mTOR 
signaling pathway regulates CRLS1 expression, offering a promising avenue for 
future therapeutic strategies. In conclusion, this study highlights the pivotal 
role of CRLS1 in colon cancer and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic 
target through lipid metabolism in managing this aggressive disease.

Addressing the clinical challenges of lacking effective therapeutic targets and 
the high recurrence rate in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), this study 
innovatively constructed a targeted nanoplatform (CM@DOX-GO NPs) based on the 
synergistic combination of photothermal therapy (PTT) and chemotherapy. This 
platform achieves a breakthrough integration of spatiotemporally coordinated 
PTT-chemotherapy and precise targeting by co-loading the highly efficient 
photothermal agent, monolayer graphene oxide (GO), and the chemotherapeutic drug 
doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) into core-shell structured liposomes, followed 
by biomimetic modification with tumor cell membranes (derived from MDA-MB-231 
cells). Serving as a novel near-infrared (NIR) photosensitizer, GO exhibits a 
unique photothermal effect that not only directly induces tumor cell death but 
also enhances cellular membrane permeability through hyperthermia, thereby 
promoting the intertumoral penetration and targeted release of DOX. Experimental 
results confirmed that the tumor cell membrane-camouflaged nanoparticles exhibit 
significantly enhanced homologous targeting capability compared to conventional 
formulations. Their optimized systemic circulation characteristics and specific 
fluorescence enrichment within the tumor region collectively validate the 
effectiveness of the biomimetic strategy. Under NIR irradiation, this system 
leverages the spatiotemporally coordinated mechanism of PTT-chemotherapy, 
substantially improving tumor cell eradication efficiency while simultaneously 
reducing systemic toxicity through precise energy control. This innovative 
design successfully overcomes the limitations inherent in conventional PTT, such 
as uneven energy distribution and low bioavailability of photosensitizers, 
offering a promising new strategy for highly efficient and low-toxicity TNBC 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: Immigrants comprise roughly 14% of the U.S. population, and studies 
indicate that breast cancer increases among some immigrant groups after 
relocating to the U.S.
OBJECTIVE: We characterized exposures to breast cancer-relevant chemicals in 
jobs commonly occupied by U.S. immigrant women, aged 18-65.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the American Community Survey Public Use 
Microdata Sample to profile which occupations are most prevalent for immigrant 
women and integrated these results with data on occupational chemical exposures 
from the Women's Occupations and Risk from Chemicals tool, which identifies 
occupations with probable and possible chemical exposures of relevance for 
breast cancer.
RESULTS: Immigrant women most commonly work as house cleaners, nurses, cashiers, 
janitors, and care aides, and comprise 71% of manicurists. We prioritize the 
occupations house cleaners and nurses for their combination of high potential 
exposures and the large number of immigrant women employed in these occupations. 
Chemicals of interest are those found in fragrances, and cleaning and 
maintenance products, including phthalates, antimicrobials, and alkylphenols. 
Many of these compounds are mammary gland carcinogens and developmental 
toxicants, and/or endocrine disruptors.
IMPACT: There are few studies of breast cancer-relevant chemical exposures for 
most occupations, including those heavily represented by immigrant women. By 
identifying jobs that employ large numbers of immigrant women and are associated 
with a high likelihood of exposure to potential breast carcinogens, we inform 
future research on breast cancer-relevant exposures and opportunities for 
preventative exposure reduction. We also show that immigrant women with lower 
levels of education and English fluency work in occupations with more potential 
for harmful chemical exposures.

Protein lysine succinylation is a crucial post-translational modification that 
regulates nearly all aspects of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell, including gene 
transcription, cell metabolism and redox homeostasis. Among them, metabolic 
disorders caused by dysfunctional post-translational modifications induce aging 
and aged-related diseases, including cancer. This study quantified the dynamic 
changes in protein succinylation in response to DNA damage stress induced by 
etoposide (ETOP) in tumor cells. A total of 4354 lysine succinylation sites on 
1259 proteins were identified, many of which have not been previously reported. 
Bioinformatics analysis revealed that many proteins are involved in the 
metabolism of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) in 
mitochondria (including MTHFD2). We further found that low activity or depletion 
of MTHFD2 enhances the degree of TIS in breast cancer cells and decreases their 
resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Interestingly, we also found that 
SIRT5-mediated desuccinylation of MTHFD2 was able to reduce the senescence of 
breast cancer cells, thereby enhancing their resistance to chemotherapeutic 
drugs. This effect may explain the poorer prognosis observed in breast cancer 
patients with high expression levels of SIRT5 or MTHFD2. These systematic 
analyses provide new insights into targeting succinylation-modified metabolic 
proteins to enhance TIS, and their combination with senolytics for breast cancer 
therapy.

BACKGROUND: The benefits of physical activity are widely recognized in primary 
and tertiary breast cancer prevention. Most women do not meet the international 
physical activity recommendations for breast cancer prevention despite public 
health policies. The aim of this study is to better understand barriers, 
facilitators, and preferences for physical activity among adult women in France.
METHODS: A web-based observational study was conducted between February and 
March 2021 through a Seintinelles French collaborative research platform. Women 
with and without a history of breast cancer were asked to complete an online 
questionnaire measuring sociodemographic and health characteristics, physical 
activity behaviors, physical activity barriers and facilitators, and physical 
activity preferences.
RESULTS: A total of 2,306 women participated in this study, including women 
without breast cancer (n = 1,245), women with localized breast cancer undergoing 
treatment (n = 530), or post-treatment (n = 396), and women with metastatic 
breast cancer (n = 135). The mean age was 48.7 years (SD = 13.2) and 63.8% of 
the population were classified as insufficiently active. Lack of motivation was 
the most common physical activity barrier in all groups while the main physical 
activity facilitators were women's desire to improve their abilities and quality 
of life, to feel better about their bodies and to experience pleasure. Walking 
remains the preferred physical activity for all women in the study, as they 
particularly like to be active outdoors, under supervision, on any day of the 
week, at a moderate intensity, for 30-60 min per session. Some differences of 
physical activity barriers, facilitators and preferences were observed between 
women who are still undergoing treatment compared to women who have completed 
the treatment or without breast cancer history. Women with metastatic breast 
cancer emphasized their need for physical activity counselling. Overall, 
physically inactive women reported more barriers to exercise (17 out of 22 
items), whereas physically active women reported more facilitators (20 out of 22 
items).
CONCLUSIONS: Women across the breast cancer spectrum identified similar and 
unique determinants and preferences for physical activity. These determinants 
and preferences may contribute to targeted activity guideline development to 
promote physical activity for women before, during, and after treatment for 
breast cancer.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Women who had completed treatment for 
localized breast cancer share both common and specific determinants and 
preferences for physical activity compared with women without breast cancer, 
those undergoing treatment, and those with metastatic disease, highlighting the 
need for tailored physical activity counselling and programs.

PURPOSE: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) significantly impacts 
patients' quality of life (QoL). This study investigated long-term QoL outcomes 
among 619 patients with newly diagnosed HNSCC over five years.
METHODS: QoL was assessed annually using the SF-36, covering physical 
functioning, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, and general health. 
Patients were stratified by tumor subsite and smoking status.
RESULTS: Significant improvements in QoL were observed at the 1-year follow-up, 
particularly among patients with pharyngeal [adjusted β: 3.56 (95% CI: 1.69, 
5.43)] and oral cavity cancers [adjusted β: 2.56 (95% CI: 0.52, 4.60)]. However, 
patients with laryngeal cancer showed no significant change at any follow-up 
[e.g., 1-year adjusted β: 0.93 (95% CI: -2.36, 4.24)]. Overall, QoL improved 
most notably in the early years post-treatment [adjusted β: 2.86 (95% CI: 1.56, 
4.16)]. Smoking status significantly influenced QoL trajectories. Never-smokers 
showed the greatest improvement (from 53.11 at baseline to 59.29 at year 2, 
P < 0.0001), followed by quitters (48.09 to 51.42, P = 0.04). Continued and 
intermittent smokers demonstrated no significant gains.
CONCLUSIONS: In this longitudinal study of HNSCC patients, quality of life 
significantly improved over time, particularly among those with pharyngeal and 
oral cavity tumors and those who never smoked or quit smoking after diagnosis.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: These findings highlight the importance of 
smoking cessation in survivorship care. Personalized care strategies addressing 
both physical and psychosocial challenges, particularly for continued smokers 
and those with laryngeal tumors, are essential to improving long-term QoL in 
HNSCC survivors.

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter (H.) pylori is the major risk factor of gastric cancer 
(GC). We aimed to estimate the population attributable fraction (PAF) of GC and 
the number of new GC cases and deaths for GC attributable to H. pylori in 
different countries worldwide in 2022.
METHODS: The PAF was estimated using country-specific pooled prevalence of H. 
pylori in the period 2000-2010 obtained through a systematic review and 
meta-analysis and a risk ratio of 5.9 for the association between H. pylori and 
GC. The absolute number of new GC cases and deaths for GC attributable to H. 
pylori was calculated using PAF and GC incidence and mortality reported by 
GLOBOCAN 2022.
RESULTS: The PAF of GC due to H. pylori was calculated for 27 countries. The 
average PAF was 69.7% ranging from 40.7% in Malaysia to 82.3% in South Africa. 
The PAF was > 70% in all countries in the analysis in Africa, East Mediterranean 
region and Latin America, apart from Mexico, and in some countries in Western 
Pacific region (China, Japan and Korea) and Europe (Poland, Spain and Albania). 
The largest number of GC cases and deaths for GC attributable to H. pylori was 
estimated in China (GC: 252,850, deaths:184,666) and Japan (GC: 92,166, deaths: 
31,809).
CONCLUSIONS: More than two-thirds of new GC cases in the countries in the 
analysis were attributable to H. pylori in 2022. Our estimates may contribute to 
better investigate cost-effectiveness of H. pylori screening strategies for GC 
prevention in different countries worldwide.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a 12-week programme, 
including moderate strength training with and without whole-body vibration 
(WBV), on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) associated symptoms 
in breast cancer patients undergoing paclitaxel-containing therapy. The goal was 
to assess the effects on sensory, motor, and autonomic symptoms and on balance, 
depth sensitivity, and the vibration sensation.
METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 66 patients were allocated to one 
of three groups: (i) strength training only (SG), (ii) strength training with 
WBV (VG), and (iii) a control group (CG) with standard activity advices. 
Supervised training sessions occurred twice a week during chemotherapy. 
Outcomes, including balance (Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale, Berg Balance 
Scale), vibration sensation (tuning fork test), and CIPN symptoms (EORTC 
QLQ-CIPN20), were assessed at baseline (T0), 6 weeks (T1), and 12 weeks (T2).
RESULTS: No adverse events were recorded, and adherence was high (68.18%). 
Positive trends indicated stabilized vibration sensation in the SG and VG 
compared to the control group, but no significant differences were observed. 
Vibration perception decreased less in the intervention groups, and motor 
symptoms worsened only in the control group. Balance remained stable across all 
groups.
CONCLUSION: Both strength training alone and combined with WBV are feasible and 
safe during chemotherapy. Although WBV did not provide additional benefits over 
strength training alone, both interventions showed potential protective effects 
against CIPN symptoms.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Moderate strength training, with or without 
WBV, may help prevent or alleviate CIPN symptoms, supporting better physical 
function during chemotherapy. Early implementation of such programmes could 
reduce treatment-related side effects.

Adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer provides uncertain benefit at 
the individual level. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) may help refine 
risk-adjusted treatment selection. In this multicenter, randomized, phase 2/3 
trial, patients with stage III colon cancer underwent ctDNA testing 5-6 weeks 
after surgery and were assigned (1:1) to ctDNA-guided or standard management. In 
the ctDNA-guided arm, patients negative for ctDNA received de-escalated therapy, 
whereas ctDNA-positive patients received escalated therapy. Clinicians 
prespecified the standard regimen. Primary endpoints were 3-year recurrence-free 
survival (RFS) for ctDNA-negative patients and 2-year RFS for ctDNA-positive 
patients. Secondary endpoints included treatment-related hospitalization and 
ctDNA clearance. Among 968 evaluable patients, 702 (72.5%) were ctDNA negative. 
With a median follow-up of 47 months, ctDNA-negative patients experienced 
significantly fewer recurrences than ctDNA-positive patients (3-year RFS 87% 
versus 49%; P < 0.001). In ctDNA-negative patients, de-escalation reduced 
oxaliplatin use (34.8% versus 88.6%) and hospitalizations (8.5% versus 13.2%) 
but yielded slightly lower RFS than standard management (85.3% versus 88.1%), 
not meeting the non-inferiority margin. In ctDNA-positive patients, higher ctDNA 
burden correlated with recurrence risk (3-year RFS 77% to 23% across quartiles; 
P < 0.001). Escalated therapy did not improve outcomes over standard management 
(2-year RFS 51% versus 61%). There was no unexpected toxicity. Persistent ctDNA 
after treatment predicted markedly worse prognosis (3-year RFS 14% versus 79%). 
ctDNA is validated as a strong prognostic classifier. ctDNA-guided de-escalation 
reduced oxaliplatin exposure and adverse events with outcomes approaching 
standard of care, whereas exploratory chemotherapy intensification conferred no 
RFS benefit, suggesting a need for novel strategies in ctDNA-positive 
disease.Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry Identifier:

Over the last few years diagnostic and therapeutic advances have contributed to 
the significant relevance of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron 
emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and PSMA radioligand therapy in 
patients with advanced prostate cancer (PCa). The PSMA-PET/CT has a higher 
accuracy for the detection of PCa metastases than the combination of CT and bone 
scintigraphy. Based on the theranostic approach, PSMA radioligand therapy can be 
performed in the castration-resistant stage in patients with sufficient PSMA 
expression of the tumor lesions in PSMA PET/CT and progression of PCa after 
chemotherapy and therapy with abiraterone or an androgen receptor signalling 
pathway inhibitor. Over the next few years, a large number of studies on the 
effectiveness of PSMA radioligand therapy in earlier stages of PCa and as part 
of combination therapies with other drugs will be conducted.

Publisher: Diagnostische und therapeutische Fortschritte haben zu einer 
signifikanten Relevanz der PSMA(prostataspezifisches 
Membranantigen)-PET(Positronenemissionstomographie)/CT (Computertomographie) und 
der PSMA-Radioligandentherapie beim fortgeschrittenen Prostatakarzinom (PCa) 
beigetragen. Die PSMA-PET/CT verfügt über eine höhere Genauigkeit für den 
Nachweis von Metastasen des PCa als die Kombination aus CT und 
Knochenszintigraphie. Auf Grundlage des theranostischen Ansatzes kann bei 
Patienten mit ausreichender PSMA-Expression der Tumorläsionen in der PSMA-PET/CT 
und Progress des PCa nach Chemotherapie und Therapie mit Abirateron oder einem 
Androgenrezeptorsignalweginhibitor eine PSMA-Radioligandentherapie im 
kastrationsresistenten Stadium durchgeführt werden. Im Verlauf der nächsten 
Jahre wird eine Vielzahl an Studien zur Effektivität der 
PSMA-Radioligandentherapie in früheren Stadien des PCa sowie im Rahmen von 
Kombinationstherapien mit anderen Medikamenten erwartet.

Long-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies have revolutionized 
transcriptomic research by enabling the sequencing of full-length RNA molecules, 
thus providing a more accurate characterization of complex transcript isoforms 
than traditional short-read approaches. In this study, we present a 
high-coverage long-read transcriptome dataset generated using Oxford Nanopore 
Technologies' PromethION platform from ten human pancreatic cancer cell lines, 
with two biological replicates per line. The dataset comprises approximately 
189.8 million reads across 20 samples, providing a valuable resource for 
studying transcript structures in pancreatic cancer. We perform systematic 
quality assessments, including read length, base quality, and gene body 
coverage, and report high reproducibility between replicates. Processed files, 
including transcript annotations in GTF, FASTA, and BED formats, are publicly 
available to facilitate reuse. This resource supports a wide range of downstream 
applications such as isoform discovery, transcriptome annotation, and 
integration with other omics data, offering a foundation for further exploration 
of transcriptomic complexity in cancer biology.

Resistance to cell death remains a critical challenge in the therapy of 
colorectal cancer (CRC). Smac mimetics (SM) are cytotoxic agents specifically 
designed to maximize tumor cell killing mediated via endogenous tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF). In CRC, however, SM lacked clinical activity for reasons that 
remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that the clinically approved 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor Cabozantinib potently sensitizes to SM by targeting a 
Met-RIPK1 signaling axis in CRC. Aberrant Met hampers the activation of RIPK1, 
which renders CRC cells resistant to TNF/SM-mediated apoptosis and necroptosis. 
In turn, Cabozantinib potently inhibits Met, thereby stabilizing RIPK1 
expression and converting TNF into a robust pro-death signal. 
SM/Cabozantinib-based regimens demonstrated anti-tumor activity in vivo, and 
were effective in a heterogeneous panel of patient-derived CRC of diverse 
molecular subtypes. In addition, we show that it is feasible to modulate between 
apoptosis and necroptosis to overcome therapy resistance and foster anti-tumor 
immunity. In summary, this work provides novel biological insight into the 
mechanisms of SM resistance and warrants the combinatory use of SM and 
Cabozantinib to enhance apoptotic and necroptotic cell death in CRC.

INTRODUCTION: Exertional dyspnoea is highly debilitating. Previous single-dose 
studies found that prophylactic administration of fentanyl buccal tablet (FBT) 
improved exertional dyspnoea. In this randomised trial, we compared daily use of 
prophylactic FBT, oral morphine and placebo on exertional dyspnoea over 14 days.
METHODS: This parallel, double-blind, randomised clinical trial enrolled 
opioid-tolerant patients with cancer and exertional dyspnoea. After a 5-day 
observation period, patients were randomised (1:1:1) to receive FBT, morphine or 
placebo 30 min before daily structured activity for 14 days. Shuttle walk tests 
(SWTs) were conducted on days 1/5/8/12/15/19. The primary outcome was change in 
modified Borg Scale dyspnoea intensity during SWTs from day 5 to day 19, 
analysed using a mixed effects model with treatment, time and treatment×time 
interaction. SWT distance was a key secondary outcome.
RESULTS: 67 patients were enrolled and 56 (84%) were randomised. Over the 14-day 
blinded phase, we observed a significant decrease in the magnitude of dyspnoea 
intensity change during the SWTs in all three groups, with no significant 
difference by treatment group (slope change from day 5 to day 19: FBT -2.2 (95% 
CI -2.9 to -1.6); morphine -1.9 (95% CI -2.7 to -1.2); placebo -2.2 (95% CI -3 
to -1.4); time effect p<0.001, treatment×time effect p=0.79). SWT distance 
increased significantly over time (FBT +93 m; morphine +84 m; placebo +76 m) but 
did not differ by treatment (p=0.71). Few adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSION: All three groups reported less dyspnoea while walking farther; 
however, no difference was detected between opioids and placebo. These findings 
should be considered preliminary given the underpowered sample.

BACKGROUND: In 2014, a bushfire ignited the Hazelwood coalmine in regional 
Victoria, Australia, shrouding nearby communities in smoke for 6 weeks. In this 
study, we examined whether survival decreased among people with cancer in 
smoke-exposed areas.
METHODS: We identified cancers diagnosed between January 2009 and February 2014, 
the start of the coalmine fire, from the Victorian Cancer Registry. Tumours were 
grouped by location as well as subtypes for breast and lung cancers. Smoke 
exposure was determined by the daily average of PM2.5 per 10 µg/m3 attributable 
to the mine fire at Statistical Area level 2. Survival effects were analysed 
using a Cox proportional hazards frailty model.
RESULTS: There was no detectable effect of fire-related PM2.5 on overall cancer 
survival. There was weak evidence that fire-related PM2.5 exposure reduced 
survival among women with breast cancer (HR: 1.18, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.38 per 10 
µg/m3 of PM2.5). No other effects were detectable.
CONCLUSION: We found limited evidence that smoke from the Hazelwood coal mine 
fire reduced survival among people living with cancer. The association with 
reduced survival among women with breast cancer may be a chance finding. 
However, this does not rule out an effect and further analyses should follow 
when more data become available or following other similar disasters.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) ranks among the most prevalent lethal tumours 
globally. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are pivotal in creating an 
immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME) in GC.
OBJECTIVE: Identifying a critical subpopulation of CAFs in promoting an 
immunosuppressive TME and enabling immune evasion, which may influence 
therapeutic effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for GC.
DESIGN: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 24 patients with GC and 
spatial transcriptomic profiling on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue 
sections from patients and controls. Integrating these data, we mapped cell 
types and gene signatures and identified distinct CAF subpopulations in the TME 
that influenced immunotherapy response in patients with GC. In vitro and in vivo 
studies further elucidated the molecular mechanisms, enhancing therapeutic 
implications.
RESULTS: In patients with GC, phosphodiesterase type 5A (PDE5A) expression was 
associated with shorter overall survival and the formation of immunosuppressive 
TME. We identified PDE5A+ CAFs that were associated with TME alterations, 
including T cell exclusion and reduced CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration, 
potentially impairing the efficacy of immunotherapy in GC. PDE5A+ CAFs were 
observed to promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of GC cells through 
remodelling extracellular matrix. Furthermore, PDE5A+ CAFs, via triggering of 
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway, released CXCL12, which engaged the CXCR4 
receptor, consequently recruiting CD8+ TEX+ LAG3 T cells to facilitate the 
development of immunosuppressive TME. The combined treatment of LAG3 blockade 
and PDE5A inhibitor vardenafil effectively enhanced immunotherapy responses, 
significantly curbing GC progression in mouse models.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study elucidates the intricate role of PDE5A+ CAFs in shaping 
the immunosuppressive TME in GC, providing mechanistic insights and therapeutic 
potential for combating this aggressive malignancy.

BACKGROUND: Substantial cancer underdiagnosis, especially early-stage cancers, 
occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Medicaid expansion 
under the Affordable Care Act could facilitate access to timely detection of 
cancer during pandemic-related financial and employment instability. This study 
examines the association of Medicaid expansion and changes in cancer stage at 
diagnosis during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: We compared changes in proportions of early-stage (stage I/II) cancer 
diagnosis in Medicaid expansion states versus non-expansion states among 
1 844 515 individuals aged 18-64 years newly diagnosed with cancer in 2018-2022 
from the National Cancer Database using a difference-in-differences (DD) 
approach. Adjusted DD estimates were calculated with linear probability models 
and stratified by key sociodemographic factors and cancer type.
RESULTS: We found that Medicaid expansion was statistically significantly 
associated with smaller decreases in proportions of early-stage cancer diagnosis 
among individuals aged 18-44 years (DD = 1.26; 95% CI = 0.54 to 1.98), men 
(DD = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.08 to 1.14), and those with high comorbidity burden 
(Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score ≥ 2; DD = 1.51; 95% CI = 0.24 to 2.78), treated 
in academic facilities (DD = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.03 to 1.06), or diagnosed with 
prostate cancer (DD = 1.52; 95% CI = 0.56 to 2.47).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a protective effect of Medicaid expansion on 
early-stage cancer diagnoses during the COVID-19 pandemic and public health 
emergency in the United States, informing policy makers and the public in the 10 
states that have yet to expand Medicaid eligibility. Findings can also inform 
policy makers and the public in all states about the public health implications 
of upcoming large federal cuts to Medicaid programs and coverage.

Treatment strategies focusing on the induction of multiple programmed cell death 
(PCD) have gained attention in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PCD 
represented by apoptosis and ferroptosis is closely linked to oxidative stress. 
This study aimed to investigate whether icariside II (ICS II) induces dual PCD 
and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The current study showed that ICS II 
inhibited cell progression and metastasis and was more selective towards NSCLC 
cells. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that ICS II induced ferroptosis, 
characterized by excessive levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), depletion of 
reductive compounds, and mitochondrial impairment. Functional analysis revealed 
that ICS II suppressed Nrf2-mediated SLC7A11/GPX4/HO-1 transcription and 
activated ACSL4-mediated lipid peroxidation, which were rescued by ferrostatin-1 
and Nrf2 overexpression. Simultaneously, ICS II activated caspase family 
proteins and reduced PARP activity, thereby triggering apoptosis. 
N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) abolished the effects of ICS II on NSCLC cells and 
restored cell viability, confirming the functional contribution of ROS in ICS 
II-induced PCD. Finally, a mouse subcutaneous tumor model was established to 
assess the drug efficacy and toxicity. As expected, ICS II inhibited tumor 
development in a mouse subcutaneous tumor model with minimal toxicity. Taken 
together, ICS II exerts anti-NSCLC efficacy by weakening cellular antioxidative 
capacity (inhibition of Nrf2 activity) and promoting the accumulation of 
substrates for lipid peroxidation (ACSL4 activation), triggering oxidative 
stress, and exhibiting dual PCD induction. Our findings demonstrate the 
potential of ICS II for use in clinical NSCLC therapy.

OBJECTIVES: This cross-sectional study was carried out to explore the care 
preparedness level of family caregivers of laryngeal cancer patients and its 
influencing factors, so as to provide guidance for the development of targeted 
care interventions.
METHODS: A total of 162 family caregivers of laryngeal cancer patients were 
recruited from a tertiary hospital in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, using the 
convenience sampling method. They were surveyed by the general data 
questionnaire, the Care Preparedness Scale, the Caregiver Reaction Assessment 
(CRA), the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS), the Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS), and the Optimism and Pessimism Scale (OPS).
RESULTS: The care preparedness scores of family caregivers of laryngeal cancer 
patients were 19.07 ± 5.76. The care preparedness level of family caregivers was 
significantly positively correlated with the score of the Perceived Social 
Support Scale and the score of the depression subscale in the Hospital Anxiety 
and Depression Scale (P < 0.05). The results of multiple linear regression 
analysis showed that the closeness of the caregiver's relationship with the 
patient, whether family caregivers had care experience, how the patient eats, 
the level of the Perceived Social Support Scale and the score of the anxiety 
subscale in the HADS were the main factors influencing their care preparedness 
(P < 0.05). These five factors accounted for 30.0 % of the variance.
CONCLUSIONS: The care preparedness of family caregivers of laryngeal cancer 
patients remains to be continuously improved. To achieve this end, medical staff 
can provide targeted support and guidance for caregivers according to the 
influencing factors, such as encouraging caregivers who have no experience in 
caring to learn more from their peers and helping caregivers become proficient 
in the use of gastric tubes, strengthening the training, offering social 
support, and remote intervention (including family caregivers' education through 
the media).

Checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionised cancer treatment, yet only 20-30% of 
patients achieve durable responses, highlighting the critical need for 
predictive models. This review focuses on PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibitors as 
monotherapy, examining current prediction frameworks spanning biomarker-based 
approaches, multi-omics integration, mathematical modelling, and artificial 
intelligence applications. Recent advances include SCORPIO and LORIS machine 
learning systems demonstrating superior statistical performance compared to 
traditional biomarkers, with area under curve values of 0.763. However, critical 
analysis reveals significant limitations in external validation across diverse 
healthcare settings, with many promising models failing to maintain performance 
outside their development institutions. Traditional pathological assessment by 
expert pathologists, including standardised PD-L1 scoring and 
tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte quantification, continues to form the foundation 
of clinical decision-making and provides essential validation for emerging AI 
approaches. Despite extensive research, established biomarkers show limited 
predictive accuracy, with PD-L1 demonstrating predictive value in only 28.9% of 
FDA approvals. Multi-feature models incorporating genomic and clinical data show 
improved accuracy but face substantial validation challenges. Integration of 
spatial biomarkers and digital pathology has enhanced capabilities, achieving 
area under curve values of 0.84 in select studies. The most critical challenge 
is the ""validation gap"", many models show excellent single-institution 
performance but fail external validation, limiting clinical translation. Current 
obstacles include inadequate standardisation, interpretability concerns, and 
healthcare system integration difficulties. Future directions must prioritise 
rigorous multi-institutional validation studies, development of clinically 
implementable frameworks, and addressing practical deployment challenges to 
realise precision immunotherapy's potential.

The forest cobra (Naja melanoleuca) species represents one of the most 
widespread medically important elapid snakes across Africa. The immense 
tissue-damaging effect of cobra venoms is attributed to the cytotoxins (CTX), 
which predominate in virtually all cobra venoms. In this study a bottom-up 
venomic approach was followed for deciphering the composition of the N. 
melanoleuca, N. subfulva, and N. savannula venom proteomes. The results revealed 
complex venoms that constituted predominantly of proteins belonging to the 
three-finger toxins (3FTxs) followed by phospholipase A2 (PLA2s) and snake venom 
metalloproteinases (SVMPs). The cytotoxicity and selectivity of the crude venoms 
and fractions were evaluated against cancer and normal cell lines. The crude N. 
melanoleuca venom sample demonstrated weak/low cytotoxic activity across the 
different cell lines as corroborated by SI values of less than 2, thus 
highlighting its limited application against these cancer cells, while the N. 
subfulva venom demonstrated its highest cytotoxic activity against the HeLa 
cancer cell line with a moderate selectivity index of 2.04. It is crucial to 
emphasize that these findings are still in the preliminary stages, primarily 
based on in vitro studies, and there remains a significant gap to bridge before 
any therapeutic applications can be considered. SIGNIFICANCE: Biological 
significance: African forest cobra venom is a rich source of bioactive compounds 
such as cytotoxins, which cause tissue necrosis and descending paralysis. 
However, the venom has also been identified as a potential source of therapeutic 
agents, including anticancer agents. In this study, we evaluate the anticancer 
effects of the N. melanoleuca, N. subfulva, and N. savannula venoms and their 
fractions against the selected cell lines. The 3FTxs and PLA2s, which are the 
most abundant protein families in the venoms, are predominantly responsible for 
the cytotoxic effects. In conclusion, this research study highlights the 
important role of forest cobra venoms as potential resources that researchers 
can further exploit to investigate the molecules responsible for the anticancer 
effect and investigate their mechanisms of action.

INTRODUCTION: High-dose rate brachytherapy (HDRB) monotherapy has proven 
effective in managing low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer (IRPC). This 
study aims to evaluate patterns of relapse, treatment-related toxicity, and 
tumor control in patients with IRPC treated with a single fraction of HDRB 
monotherapy.
METHODOLOGY: We reviewed IRPC patients treated with HDRB monotherapy delivered 
as a single 21 Gy fraction between January 2015 and December 2021. Clinical 
data, treatment parameters, and outcomes were extracted from medical records. 
Radiological local recurrences diagnosed by a blinded genitourinary radiologist 
were confirmed by biopsy. We performed dosimetric analysis of recurrent 
intraprostatic nodules. Toxicities were graded using CTCAE v4. We report 3- and 
5-year biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS), locoregional relapse-free 
survival (LRRFS), and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: 87 patients were included (median follow-up: 51.1 months). Biochemical 
failure occurred in 24.1 % of patients, including local relapse in 16.1 %. Using 
Cox proportional-hazards model, higher baseline PSA and unfavorable 
intermediate-risk (UIR) category were associated with an increased local relapse 
risk (HR 1.2 [95 % CI 1.0-1.42], p = 0.013; HR 4.52 [95 % CI 1.4-14.1], 
p = 0.01, respectively), whereas a greater prostatic volume receiving 100 % of 
the prescription dose was protective (HR 0.85 [95 % CI 0.75-0.96]). Dosimetric 
analyses of recurrences (D98% = 21.6 Gy, D90% = 23.7 Gy, Dmean = 30.6 Gy) showed 
no association with failure. The 5-year bRFS rate for favorable 
intermediate-risk (FIR) patients was 83.4 %, and for UIR patients 59.3 %. The 
5-year LRRFS rate was 82.6 % for FIR and 76.9 % for UIR patients. The 5-year OS 
was 96.6 %. Acute grade ≥ 3 genitourinary toxicities occurred in 5.7 % of 
patients, and late grade ≥ 3 toxicity in 1.1 %. No grade ≥ 2 gastrointestinal 
toxicity was observed.
CONCLUSION: A single 21 Gy fraction of HDR brachytherapy monotherapy for IRPC 
appears feasible and safe, yielding a 5-year bRFS of 83.4 % for FIR and 59.3 % 
for UIR patients. Patterns of failure were not attributable to inadequate 
dosimetric coverage. Higher baseline PSA levels and UIR classification were 
associated with an increased risk of local failure.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis, particularly to the liver, is a primary 
contributor to cancer-related deaths, yet the underlying molecular drivers 
remain insufficiently defined. This study identifies Rho-associated coiled-coil 
kinase 1 (ROCK1) as a central regulator of CRC metastatic progression. Analysis 
of patient samples revealed significantly elevated ROCK1 expression in liver 
metastases relative to primary tumors. Functional assays demonstrated that ROCK1 
depletion impaired CRC cell migration and inhibited hepatic colonization in 
vivo, while ROCK1 overexpression promoted a metastatic phenotype. 
Mechanistically, ROCK1 loss led to downregulation of EMT markers, including 
N-cadherin and β-catenin. Transcriptomic profiling uncovered protein kinase C 
eta (PRKCH) as a downstream effector of ROCK1, with PRKCH expression markedly 
reduced following ROCK1 knockdown. Functional silencing of PRKCH suppressed CRC 
cell motility and disrupted metabolic homeostasis by reducing glycolytic flux 
and mitochondrial respiration. Conversely, PRKCH overexpression partially 
restored migration and bioenergetic function in ROCK1-deficient cells. Further 
investigation identified the ERK2-CREB1 signaling axis as critical for 
ROCK1-driven PRKCH transcription, with pharmacological or genetic inhibition of 
ERK2 or CREB1 reducing PRKCH expression. CREB1 binding to the PRKCH promoter was 
validated using luciferase reporter assays. Collectively, these findings reveal 
a novel ROCK1-ERK2-CREB1-PRKCH signaling pathway that coordinates EMT and 
metabolic reprogramming to drive CRC liver metastasis, highlighting PRKCH as a 
promising therapeutic target in advanced CRC.

Breast cancer poses a significant threat to women's health as one of the primary 
malignant tumors. It is a cancer that occurs in breast tissue. Surgical 
treatment and drug-assisted treatment can cause multiple side effects in human 
body in clinical application, while bioactive polysaccharides have basically no 
side effects on human body, so polysaccharides are the hotspot in the field of 
anti-tumor drug research at present. In this paper, we reviewed dozens of 
bioactive polysaccharides with obvious anti-breast cancer effects discovered in 
the last decade, and summarized their anti-breast cancer effects and mechanisms, 
which involve induction of apoptosis, inhibition of metastasis and invasion, and 
Regulating the immune system, and conduct a preliminary discussion on the 
relationship between the structure of polysaccharides and their anti-breast 
cancer activity. This paper also incorporates a categorization of the molecular 
typing of breast cancer cells on which the bioactive polysaccharides act, and 
the challenges and development direction of polysaccharide active ingredients in 
the treatment of breast cancer are also prospected.

BACKGROUND: We report long-term efficacy and safety from the multicenter, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III 
ATHENA-MONO/GOG-3020/ENGOT-ov45 (NCT03522246) study of first-line rucaparib 
maintenance for advanced ovarian cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 4:1 to oral rucaparib + 
intravenous (IV) placebo or oral + IV placebo. Stratification factors were 
homologous recombination deficiency (HRD; BRCA mutation and loss of 
heterozygosity status) classification, residual disease post-chemotherapy and 
surgical timing. Primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free 
survival (invPFS) in HRD and intent-to-treat (ITT) populations. Overall survival 
(OS) and safety were secondary endpoints. Second event of progression (PFS2) and 
time to first subsequent treatment (TFST) were exploratory. Interim OS and final 
safety analyses data cutoff was March 9, 2023. Updated invPFS, PFS2, and TFST 
analyses data cutoff was May 5, 2025.
RESULTS: Median invPFS follow-up was approximately 59 months for both rucaparib 
(HRD, n = 185; ITT, n = 427) and placebo (HRD, n = 49; ITT, n = 111). invPFS was 
significantly longer with rucaparib versus placebo in the HRD (31.4 versus 12.0 
months; HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.35-0.76) and ITT (20.2 versus 9.2 months; HR 0.53, 95% 
CI 0.42-0.69) populations. Interim OS was immature (OS maturity: ITT, 35%) with 
the median (95% CI) OS not reached with rucaparib and 46.2 (34.6-NR) months with 
placebo for the ITT population (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.58-1.17). ITT TFST (median, 
23.6 versus 12.1 months) and PFS2 (35.1 versus 26.9 months) were longer with 
rucaparib versus placebo. Overall, 34.6% of patients receiving rucaparib 
completed the 24-month treatment cap versus 17.3% receiving placebo. As of May 
5, 2025, 40.0% of patients on rucaparib were still on study and in long-term 
follow-up. Safety remained consistent with the primary analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Rucaparib monotherapy provides significant and durable long-term 
benefit as first-line maintenance for patients with advanced ovarian cancer with 
and without HRD.

BACKGROUND: Re-treatment with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies offers a promising 
approach to extend the continuum of care of patients with RAS and BRAF wild-type 
(wt) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with no mutations of resistance in 
their circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) at the time of treatment re-exposure.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: PARERE (NCT04787341) is an open-label, multicenter, 
randomized phase II trial investigating the optimal sequencing of panitumumab 
and regorafenib in chemorefractory RAS and BRAF wt mCRC patients, who previously 
derived benefit from first-line anti-EGFR-containing regimens, then received at 
least one intervening anti-EGFR-free line of treatment, and were prospectively 
selected for the absence of RAS and BRAF mutations in their ctDNA. Eligible 
patients were randomized 1:1 to receive anti-EGFR re-treatment with panitumumab 
followed by regorafenib after progression (arm A) versus (vs) the reverse 
sequence (arm B). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Between December 2020 and December 2024, 428 patients underwent 
molecular screening, and 213 with RAS/BRAF ctDNA wt were randomized (arm A/B = 
106/107). At a median follow-up of 31.9 months, no difference in terms of OS was 
observed between treatment arms, with a median OS of 11.7 and 11.6 months in arm 
B and A, respectively (HR: 1.13, 85% CI: 0.90-1.41, P=0.441). However, 
re-treatment with panitumumab was associated with higher objective response rate 
(1st-ORR: 16% vs 2%, P=0.003; 2nd-ORR: 18% vs 0%, P=0.013), disease control rate 
(1st-DCR: 61% vs 36%, P<0.001; 2nd-DCR 62% vs 38%, P=0.003) and longer 
progression-free survival (1st-PFS: 4.2 vs 2.4 months, P=0.103; 2nd-PFS: 3.9 vs 
2.7 months, P=0.019) than regorafenib, regardless of the sequence of the study 
treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-EGFR re-treatment should be regarded as an option in the 
continuum-of-care of chemorefractory mCRC patients with RAS and BRAF wt tumours, 
with no alterations of acquired resistance in their ctDNA.

Targeting C1 domains is a promising strategy for modulating the activity of 
signaling proteins driving tumor growth and progression. While most small 
molecules developed to date have focused on typical C1 domains, the development 
of regulators targeting atypical C1 domains remains under-explored. Herein, we 
describe the design and synthesis of novel cationic diacylglycerol DAG-lactones 
to efficiently interact with the negatively charged residues present in the 
atypical C1 domain of Vav1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor playing a 
critical role in tumor development, including pancreatic cancer. We evaluated 
the therapeutic potential of this new family of compounds using models from this 
dismal condition where Vav1 is aberrantly expressed. Treatment of cultured 
pancreatic tumor cells with sn-1 cationic DAG-lactones inhibited proliferation 
of Vav1-expressing cells while Vav1-negative cells showed no response. 
Additionally, we demonstrated that these compounds inhibited growth of 
patient-derived organoids models of pancreatic cancer. These findings underscore 
the translational value of these cationic DAG-lactones for pancreatic cancer 
patients expressing Vav1 and serve as foundation for future approaches targeting 
atypical C1 domain-containing signaling proteins.

Parity and breastfeeding reduce the risk of breast cancer, particularly 
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)1,2, yet the immunological mechanisms 
underlying this protection remain unclear. Here, we show that parity induces an 
accumulation of CD8+ T cells, including cells with a tissue-resident memory 
(TRM)-like phenotype within human normal breast tissue. In murine models, 
pregnancy followed by lactation and involution drove the accumulation of CD8⁺ T 
cells in the mammary gland, coinciding with reduced tumour growth and increased 
intratumoural immune cell infiltration, effects that were abrogated by CD8⁺ T 
cell depletion. Importantly, this CD8+ T cell dependent tumour control was only 
observed following a complete cycle of lactation and involution. Consistent with 
this, primary TNBCs from parous women exhibited greater T cell infiltration and 
improved clinical outcomes. Together these findings, spanning preclinical models 
and over 1000 patient samples, provide new insight into how reproductive history 
shapes breast immunity, positioning CD8⁺ T cells as key mediators of 
parity-associated protection and informing novel strategies for both prevention 
and treatment of breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) 
often have recurrence or progression after transurethral resection of bladder 
tumour (TURBT) and subsequent BCG therapy. We aimed to evaluate whether 1 year 
of durvalumab with BCG could improve outcomes versus BCG alone for these 
patients.
METHODS: This randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial enrolled patients aged 18 
years or older with BCG-naive, high-risk NMIBC who underwent TURBT. Patients 
were randomly allocated (1:1:1) to receive intravenous durvalumab (every 4 weeks 
for 13 cycles) plus intravesical BCG induction (weekly for 6 weeks) and 
maintenance (three doses at weekly intervals at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months), 
durvalumab plus BCG induction, or BCG induction and maintenance (comparison 
group). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed disease-free survival in 
the durvalumab plus BCG induction and maintenance group versus the comparison 
group in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03528694) and EudraCT (2017-002979-26) and is ongoing but 
is no longer enrolling patients.
FINDINGS: Between June 18, 2018, and Oct 2, 2020, 1350 patients were assessed 
for eligibility, among whom 1018 patients were randomly allocated: 339 to the 
durvalumab plus BCG induction and maintenance group (of whom 336 [99%] initiated 
and 180 [53%] completed treatment), 339 to the durvalumab plus BCG induction 
group (337 [99%] initiated and 239 [71%] completed treatment), and 340 to the 
comparison group (339 [>99%] initiated and 182 [54%] completed treatment). At a 
median follow-up of 60·7 months (IQR 51·5-66·5), there were 67 (20%) 
disease-free survival events in the durvalumab plus BCG induction and 
maintenance group and 98 (29%) events in the comparison group, resulting in a 
32% reduction in the risk of recurrence of high-risk disease or death by any 
cause with durvalumab plus BCG induction and maintenance versus the comparison 
group (hazard ratio 0·68 [95% CI 0·50-0·93]; log-rank p=0·015). Among patients 
who received at least one dose of study treatment, grade 3 or 4 
treatment-related adverse events occurred in 71 (21%) of 336 patients in the 
durvalumab plus BCG induction and maintenance group, 52 (15%) in the durvalumab 
plus BCG induction only group, and 13 (4%) of 339 patients in the comparison 
group. No treatment-related adverse events led to death.
INTERPRETATION: Among patients with BCG-naive, high-risk NMIBC, 1 year of 
durvalumab combined with BCG induction and maintenance therapy showed a 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in disease-free 
survival versus BCG induction and maintenance alone. The combination had a 
manageable safety profile, consistent with that of the individual therapies. 
These results support 1 year of durvalumab in combination with BCG induction and 
maintenance therapy as a potential new treatment for this patient population.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with gastrointestinal cancer have a high risk of 
sarcopenia, which worsens prognosis. Despite evidence suggesting multiple 
contributing factors, the exact causes remain debated, with inconsistent 
findings. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review and synthesize the 
risk factors associated with sarcopenia in patients with gastrointestinal 
cancers based on existing literature.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search of six databases identified cohort, 
case-control, and cross-sectional studies. This review was registered with 
PROSPERO (CRD42023477999). Meta-analyses using R software estimated pooled 
incidence rates and effect sizes.
RESULTS: 52 studies (16,468 participants, <40 % female) were analyzed. The 
overall prevalence of sarcopenia was 33 % (95 % CI: 28 %-38 %), with regional 
variations. Key risk factors included older age (OR 2.38, 95 % CI 1.79-3.17), 
low physical activity (OR 8.72, 95 % CI 3.15-24.11), and dependence on daily 
activities (OR 5.51, 95 % CI 2.20-13.83). Disease-related factors encompassed 
tumor staging, diabetes (OR 2.41, 95 % CI 1.35-4.29), anemia (OR 2.19, 95 % CI 
1.17-4.07), and comorbidity burden (OR 1.14, 95 % CI 1.00-1.30). Nutritional 
risks included low BMI (OR 4.03, 95 % CI 2.71-6.00), poor nutrition (OR 4.19, 
95 % CI 2.48-7.05), low albumin (OR 1.96, 95 % CI 1.20-3.21), and elevated 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (OR 1.63, 95 % CI 1.31-2.03).
DISCUSSION: Sarcopenia is highly prevalent in patients with gastrointestinal 
cancer, with diverse contributing factors. Early screening, personalized 
exercise programs, comorbidity management, and timely nutritional interventions 
are crucial for prevention and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Pediatric head CT is a common diagnostic tool that exposes 
radiosensitive organs to ionizing radiation. Children's developing tissues are 
more vulnerable to radiation-induced harm, making accurate dose and cancer risk 
estimation essential.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify organ-specific radiation doses and lifetime attributable 
cancer risk (LAR) in pediatric head CT, with a focus on the impact of 
over-scanning.
METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed 102 pediatric head CT scans performed 
at three hospitals. Organ doses were estimated using size-specific dose 
estimates and Monte Carlo simulations. LARs were calculated based on age- and 
sex-specific risk models. The prevalence and extent of over-scanning were 
assessed, and their effects on organ doses and cancer risk were analyzed.
RESULTS: The highest doses were delivered to the brain, eye lenses, oral mucosa, 
salivary glands, red bone marrow, and thyroid. LARs were highest for thyroid 
cancer, leukemia, lung, and breast cancer. Risk estimates were inversely 
associated with age and consistently higher in females. Over-scanning was 
observed in 77.5 % of cases. Importantly, it occurred exclusively in the caudal 
direction and significantly increased radiation to non-target organs, especially 
the lungs, thyroid, salivary glands, and oral mucosa. This led to substantial 
rises in cancer risk, particularly for thyroid cancer in females (254 %) and in 
children aged 5-10 years (824 %).
CONCLUSION: Over-scanning is a prevalent and preventable source of excess 
radiation in pediatric head CT. It significantly elevates organ doses and cancer 
risks, especially in young children, underscoring the need for optimized scan 
protocols and technologist training.

METHODS: Sixty-two patients with LARC were enrolled in this prospective study. 
Magnetic resonance (MR) examinations including APTw, DWI, and T2-weighted 
imaging (T2WI) were performed before NCRT. Based on histologic assessment, 
patients were divided into a pCR group or a non-pCR group. APTw and apparent 
diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram features were compared between the two 
groups. Correlations between histogram parameters and tumor regression grading 
(TRG) categories were assessed using Spearman's correlation analysis. The 
predictive performances of six models (ADC alone, APTw alone, clincal factors, 
APTw + ADC, clinical + APTw, APTw + ADC + clinical) were evaluated using the 
areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).
RESULTS: The pCR group demonstrated significantly lower APTw histogram 
parameters (including the 85th, 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles, standard 
deviation, variance, et al) and higher APTw-1st percentile, skewness, and 
minimum values vs. non-pCR group(all P < 0.05). Adding APTw imaging to DWI using 
histogram analysis significantly improved diagnostic performance for predicting 
pCR (AUC: 0.909) compared to DWI alone(AUC: 0.722, P < 0.05). The combined model 
(APTw + ADC + clinical) achieved the highest AUC of 0.963. Multiple APTw 
histogram parameters (e.g., higher percentiles) showed positive correlations 
with TRG categories (Spearman's ρ range: 0.43-0.65; all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Adding APTw imaging to DWI using histogram analysis significantly 
improves diagnostic accuracy for identifying pCR to NCRT in LARC patients 
compared to DWI alone.

Increasing evidence links childhood cancers to environmental pollutants, 
especially air pollutants. This systematic review examined the relationship 
between various environmental pollutants and the risk of childhood cancers 
during the prenatal and pediatric periods. A systematic search of Scopus, Web of 
Science, PubMed, Embase, Medline, Epistemonikos, and Cochrane databases using 
standard keywords identified 41,858 studies, of which 89 were ultimately 
included in the final analysis. The trend in studies from 1984 to 2025 indicates 
a growing focus on specific pollutants, including PM2.5, volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs), and benzene. Some studies reported statistically significant 
odds ratios (ORs) linking exposure to VOCs with the development of leukemia and 
other childhood cancers. Traffic sources were identified as the primary 
contributors to pollution associated with pediatric cancers, followed by 
industrial and indoor sources. Although data on prenatal exposures were 
sometimes sparse and inconclusive, there is more substantial evidence linking 
childhood exposures, particularly in urban and industrial areas, to the 
development of childhood cancers; however, the strength of this association 
varies depending on the type of pollutant and cancer. Geographically, the 
majority of studies have been conducted in high-income countries, which limits 
the generalizability of the findings to low- and middle-income regions. These 
findings underscore the need for targeted public health policies to mitigate 
pollutant emissions and safeguard children, particularly in urban and industrial 
areas. Future studies should prioritize precise individual exposure assessments 
and robust methodologies to elucidate causal pathways and enhance prevention 
strategies.

Nuclear paraspeckles play critical roles in orchestrating gene transcription to 
support tumor development and progression. Elucidating regulators of their 
dynamic compositions and formation could provide potential targets for treating 
cancer. Here, we discovered that the short isoform of WTX (WTX-S) specifically 
disrupted paraspeckle stability. WTX-S selectively interacted with and 
sequestered NONO (also as p54nrb) from paraspeckles. Mechanistically, 
interaction between WTX-S and NONO induced formation of nuclear bodies via 
liquid-liquid phase separation (WTX-NBs). The coiled-coil domain 2 (WTX-CCD2) 
directly interacted with NONO-CCD to compartmentalize paraspeckle proteins and 
subsequently disrupt paraspeckle stability. Functionally, the paraspeckle 
disintegration induced by WTX-NBs resulted in enhanced chemotherapy sensitivity 
and favorable prognosis in gastric cancer (GC). Importantly, the 
cell-penetrating synthetic peptide WTXAP, based on the WTX-NONO interface, 
mimicked WTX-NB-mediated paraspeckle disintegration and exhibited potent 
antitumor activity. Likewise, treatment with KPT-330, an FDA-approved XPO1 
inhibitor, significantly increased the extent of WTX-S-mediated paraspeckle 
disintegration, sensitizing WTXhigh GC to chemotherapy. Collectively, these 
findings characterized the function and potential clinical significance of 
WTX-NBs, offering a strategy for sensitizing GC to chemotherapy.

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths for both 
men and women. Screening for colorectal cancer is an effective strategy to 
reduce morbidity and mortality, but uptake remains suboptimal. Several 
performance measures for colorectal cancer screening and surveillance are 
currently used in pay-for-performance, public reporting, and/or accountability 
programs. The American College of Physicians (ACP) embraces performance 
measurement as a means to improve quality of care. The ACP believes that a 
performance measure must be methodologically sound and evidence-based to be 
considered for inclusion in payment, accountability, or reporting programs. 
These principles are critical given the potential effect to physician 
administrative work and reputation and reimbursement and to prevent unintended 
consequences on patient care. The ACP's Performance Measurement Committee (PMC) 
reviews performance measures using a validated process to recognize high-quality 
performance measures, address gaps and areas for improvement in performance 
measures, and help reduce reporting burden. This article aims to present a 
review of current performance measures for colorectal cancer screening and 
surveillance to inform physicians, payers, and policymakers in their selection 
and use of performance measures and make recommendations for measures that could 
be developed. The PMC appreciates the importance of colorectal cancer screening 
in the prevention and early detection of colorectal cancer and supports 
performance measures based on strong recommendations. The PMC reviewed 5 
performance measures for colorectal cancer screening relevant to internal 
medicine and supports 1 performance measure (""Facility 7-Day Risk-Standardized 
Hospital Visit Rate after Outpatient Colonoscopy"") for use.

BACKGROUND: There is concern about widespread increases in cancer incidence 
rates in younger adults.
OBJECTIVE: To compare international cancer incidence trends in younger adults 
(aged 20 to 49 years) and older adults (aged ≥50 years).
DESIGN: Surveillance study.
SETTING: Forty-two countries in Asia (n = 11), Europe (n = 22), Africa (n = 1), 
North and South America (n = 6), and Australasia (n = 2) with annual cancer 
incidence data from 2003 to 2017 in the International Agency for Research on 
Cancer's GLOBOCAN database.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 20 years or older.
MEASUREMENTS: Joinpoint regression to estimate the average annual percentage 
change (AAPC) in cancer incidence rates for 13 cancer types previously reported 
to be increasing in multiple countries in younger adults (leukemia and breast, 
endometrial, colorectal, oral, kidney, liver, pancreatic, gallbladder, prostate, 
stomach, esophageal, and thyroid cancer).
RESULTS: Incidence rates increased in younger adults in most (>75%) countries 
between 2003 and 2017 for 6 of the 13 cancer types: thyroid cancer (median AAPC, 
3.57%), breast cancer (median AAPC, 0.89%), colorectal cancer (median AAPC, 
1.45%), kidney cancer (median AAPC, 2.21%), endometrial cancer (median AAPC, 
1.66%), and leukemia (median AAPC, 0.78%). Incidence rates for these cancer 
types also increased in older adults in most countries (median AAPCs, 3% for 
thyroid cancer, 0.86% for breast cancer, 1.65% for kidney cancer, 1.20% for 
endometrial cancer, and 0.61% for leukemia). The exception was colorectal 
cancer, which only increased in older adults in about half the countries (median 
AAPC, 0.37%), and the AAPC was greater in younger than older adults in 69% of 
countries. For liver, oral, esophageal, and stomach cancer, rates decreased in 
younger adults in more than half the countries.
LIMITATION: Most countries with available data were high-middle-income 
countries, and the results might not be generalizable.
CONCLUSION: Cancer incidence rates increased for several cancer types in many of 
the countries studied; however, other than colorectal cancer, these increases 
occurred in both younger and older adults. These findings can help inform future 
research and clinical and public health guidelines.

PURPOSE: We evaluated the survival impact of adding platinum to standard 
taxane-anthracycline neoadjuvant chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer 
(TNBC).
METHODS: In this phase III trial, patients with TNBC were randomly assigned, 
after stratification by stage and menopausal status, to receive neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy comprising once-per-week carboplatin (AUC-2) plus paclitaxel (100 
mg/m2) for 8 weeks, followed by four cycles of anthracycline plus 
cyclophosphamide, or same chemotherapy without carboplatin. The primary end 
point was event-free survival (EFS), and secondary end points were overall 
survival (OS) and pathologic complete response. This is the prespecified primary 
analysis of this study.
RESULTS: Of 720 patients randomly assigned between April 2010 and January 2020, 
717 (platinum 361, control 356) were included in modified intention-to-treat 
analysis. At median follow-up of 67.6 months, in platinum and control arms, 
there were 111/361 and 131/356 EFS events (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.62 
to 1.03]; two-sided unstratified P = .081), with 5-year EFS of 70.7% (95% CI, 
65.8% to 75.6%) and 64.1% (95% CI, 59.0% to 69.2%), respectively, and 94/361 and 
121/356 deaths (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.97]; nominal P = .029), with 5-year 
OS of 74.4% and 66.8%, respectively. In premenopausal patients, EFS (HR, 0.61 
[95% CI, 0.43 to 0.84]; nominal P = .003; 5-year EFS 75.0% v 59.6%) and OS (HR, 
0.57 [95% CI, 0.40 to 0.82]; nominal P = .002; 5-year OS 78.2% v 64.6%) were 
significantly higher, while in postmenopausal patients, EFS (HR, 1.19 [95% CI, 
0.80 to 1.78]; nominal P = .386) and OS (HR, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.70 to 1.61]; 
nominal P = .772) were not significantly different, in platinum versus control 
arm. There was statistically significant interaction between study intervention 
and menopausal status for EFS and OS, with a benefit of adding platinum in 
premenopausal but not in postmenopausal patients. There was more grade ≥3 
myelosuppression in carboplatin arm, but there was no difference in 
nonhematologic toxicities.
CONCLUSION: Carboplatin did not significantly increase EFS but significantly 
increased the OS in patients with TNBC, with benefits confined to premenopausal 
patients.

Pharmacological restoration of p53 tumor suppressor function is a conceptually 
appealing therapeutic strategy for the many deadly cancers with compromised p53 
activity, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, the p53 pathway has 
remained undruggable, partly because of insufficient understanding of how to 
drive effective therapeutic responses without toxicity. Here, we use mouse and 
human models to deconstruct the transcriptional programs and sequelae underlying 
robust therapeutic responses in LUAD. We show that p53 drives potent tumor 
regression by direct Tsc2 transactivation, leading to mTORC1 inhibition and TFEB 
nuclear accumulation, which in turn triggers lysosomal gene expression programs, 
autophagy, and cellular senescence. Senescent LUAD cells secrete factors to 
recruit macrophages, precipitating cancer cell phagocytosis and tumor 
regression. Collectively, our analyses reveal a surprisingly complex cascade of 
events underlying a p53 therapeutic response in LUAD and illuminate targetable 
nodes for p53 combination therapies, thus establishing a critical framework for 
optimizing p53-based therapeutics.

Multi-omics Correlation Reconstruction of Complete Graph Forms Based on the 
Self-expressive Learning Network for Cancer Subtype Prediction.

Zhao J, Cai Y, Wang S.

Multi-omics cancer subtype prediction can identify cancer subtypes effectively 
and has the advantage of correlating genotype and phenotype. However, 
insufficient exploration of the correlation of information among different omics 
levels may lead to poor prediction of cancer subtypes. To address this issue, we 
propose a novel framework, termed Multi-Omics correlation reconstruction (MOCR), 
which performs reconstruction of complete graph forms based on a self-expressive 
learning network. Specifically, MOCR first employs autoencoders to unify the 
dimensions across different omics types. It then leverages parallel query and 
key networks (QKNets) to learn representations for each omics. These 
representations are passed into a correlation reconstruction module (CRModule), 
which computes self-expressive coefficients that jointly capture omics-self 
characteristics and inter-omics relationships. QKNets and CRModule form a 
correlative self-expressive learning network, enabling better utilization of the 
advantages of multi-omics. Importantly, the CRModule's complete graph 
reconstruction of omics correlations models each omics pair exactly once, 
thereby avoiding redundancy. Finally, spectral clustering is applied to derive 
cancer subtypes. We have evaluated our method on nine TCGA cancer datasets and 
three simulation datasets. The results showed that the MOCR had significant 
advantages in cancer subtype identification. The complete code is available at 
https://github.com/JerryZ09/MOCR.

IMPORTANCE: Lung cancer in nonsmoking individuals (defined as people who have 
smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime) accounts for 15% to 20% of 
all lung cancer cases worldwide. In the US, the annual incidence of lung cancer 
in nonsmoking individuals is 14.4 to 20.8 per 100 000 person-years in females 
and 4.8 to 12.7 per 100 000 person-years in males.
OBSERVATIONS: Most lung cancers in nonsmoking individuals are histologically 
adenocarcinomas (60%-80%) with the remainder being squamous or adenosquamous 
(10%-20%) and rarely small cell lung cancer (<10%). Risk factors include 
exposure to passive smoking, radon exposure, air pollution, asbestos, and 
history of lung cancer in a first-degree family member. Therapeutically 
targetable genomic variants, such as EGFR mutations or ALK gene rearrangements, 
are more common in tumors from nonsmoking individuals compared with those with a 
smoking history (defined as people who currently or formerly smoked) (43% vs 11% 
for EGFR and 12% vs 2% for ALK). In contrast, tumor mutation burden, the number 
of somatic mutations in a tumor cell, is lower in lung cancer among nonsmoking 
individuals (0-3 mutations/megabase [Mb] vs 0-30 mutations/Mb). Similar to 
individuals with a history of smoking, nonsmoking individuals with lung cancer 
may present with wheeze, chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, or symptoms 
attributable to metastatic disease (eg, bone pain and headache) or be diagnosed 
with incidentally detected disease. The US Preventive Services Task Force does 
not currently recommend lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomographic 
scans for nonsmoking individuals, although screening guidelines vary globally. 
Treatment typically involves a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and 
systemic therapies depending on stage, performance status, and molecular 
features of the tumor. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing should be 
performed on stage Ib to IIIa lung cancer tumor tissue from nonsmoking 
individuals because actionable genomic alterations, such as EGFR mutations or 
ALK gene rearrangements, are treated with targeted therapy such as the tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors osimertinib or lorlatinib, respectively. Median survival among 
nonsmoking individuals with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (stage IIIb or 
higher) and actionable genomic alterations can exceed 3 to 5 years, while 
survival without these genomic alterations is similar to lung cancer in people 
with a history of smoking (1-2 years).
CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer in nonsmoking individuals accounts for 15% to 20% of 
lung cancer cases worldwide. Among patients with lung cancer, nonsmoking 
individuals are more likely to have genomic alterations such as EGFR mutations 
or ALK gene rearrangements, and these patients have improved survival when 
treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors compared with chemotherapy.

IMPORTANCE: Screening chest computed tomography (CT) scans reduce lung cancer 
mortality in high-risk individuals, but less than 20% of eligible individuals 
are screened in the US.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a direct-to-patient digital health program 
increases lung cancer screening.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial enrolling 
individuals aged 50 to 77 years who met Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
criteria for lung cancer screening between April 18, 2022, and May 30, 2023, at 
2 academic health systems in the southeastern US. The date of last follow-up was 
September 30, 2024.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized 1:1 to the mPATH-Lung program, a 
digital health program delivered outside a clinical visit that included a brief 
decision aid and option to request a screening appointment (n = 669) or enhanced 
usual care, in which patients were notified of their lung cancer screening 
eligibility and advised to speak with their primary care clinician (n = 664).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was completion of any chest CT 
within 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes included screening decisions, process 
measures (screening visits, CT scans ordered), clinical outcomes (lung cancer 
screening results, lung cancers diagnosed), screening harms, and implementation 
outcomes.
RESULTS: Electronic invitations were sent to 26 909 individuals with a smoking 
history in their electronic health record; 3267 completed website eligibility 
questions and 1333 were deemed eligible and enrolled. The mean age was 60.7 
years (SD, 6.8 years); 864 (65%) were female; 232 (17%) were Black and 1054 
(79%) were non-Hispanic White; and 621 (47%) had commercial insurance and 595 
(45%) had public insurance. Chest CT completion was higher in the mPATH-Lung 
group than in controls (24.5% [164/669] vs 17.0% [113/664]; odds ratio, 1.6; 95% 
CI, 1.2-2.1). Among patients who completed screening CT, false-positive results 
occurred in 12.7% (19/150) of mPATH-Lung participants and 8.4% (8/95) of 
controls. Invasive procedures were performed in 2.0% (3/150) in the intervention 
group and 1.1% (1/95) in the control group, with no complications.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with enhanced usual care, a 
direct-to-patient digital health intervention increased rates of lung cancer 
screening. Future research should assess the reach and effectiveness of digital 
lung cancer screening interventions across diverse populations and health care 
settings.

OBJECTIVES: This trial served as a proof-of-concept for whether inhibition of 
protein kinase C iota (PKCι) with auranofin and sirolimus provide antineoplastic 
effects in patients with recurrent high-grade serous ovarian cancer.
METHODS: This drug combination was administered to patients with recurrent 
high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Dosing was based on unpublished phase 1 data 
and consisted of auranofin 6 mg and sirolimus 5 mg both orally per day of a 
28-day cycle. The primary endpoint was tumor response. Available tumor tissue 
was assessed for PKCι protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PRKCI 
copy number by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) after the start of 
cancer therapy.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were enrolled, and 21 were evaluable for all 
clinical trial endpoints. One patient was unevaluable because she did not 
receive a full chemotherapy cycle. No tumor responses were seen in the first 21 
patients, resulting in early trial termination per a priori trial design. The 
median progression-free survival was 2.1 months (95% CI: 1.8-3.7). The median 
overall survival was 4.4 months (95% CI: 2.6-12.5). Fourteen (67%) patients had 
at least one grade 3 or worse adverse event. Nineteen of 21 evaluable patients 
had available tumor tissue, which showed the median PKCι copy number averaged 
per cell of 3 (range: 2 to 7), and PKCι expression (at least 1+) in all.
CONCLUSIONS: As prescribed here, auranofin and sirolimus manifested no 
antineoplastic activity in patients with recurrent high-grade serous ovarian 
cancer that expressed PKCι.

Metabolic dysregulation plays a significant role in the development of gastric 
cancer (GC). However, the mechanisms that control this change and its impact on 
GC progression remain poorly understood. In this study, it is demonstrated that 
methyltransferase-like 10 (METTL10) is a key regulator of gastric tumor 
formation by enhancing purine metabolism in GC cells. It is discovered that 
METTL10 methylates the protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) at the 
lysine 442 (K442) residue, which interferes with the interaction of PIAS3 with 
microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). As a result, the 
sumoylation and ubiquitination of MITF by PIAS3 are reduced, leading to MITF 
stabilization and activation of purine metabolism. Importantly, both the 
accumulation of MITF and the methylation of K442 in PIAS3 are required for the 
oncogenic effects of METTL10, and both factors are closely linked to poor 
clinical outcomes in GC. Furthermore, this study identified a compound, 
LZQ-02-023-01, which effectively induces the METTL10-mediated ubiquitination and 
degradation of MITF, thereby reducing the oncogenic activity of METTL10. The 
findings suggest that METTL10 plays an important role in reprogramming purine 
metabolism, which promotes GC, highlighting it as a potential therapeutic target 
for GC treatment.

Breast cancer (BC) remains the most prevalent malignancy among women and a 
leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite significant 
advances in recent decades, the molecular mechanisms underlying BC pathogenesis 
are not yet fully elucidated. Emerging evidence indicates that more than half of 
the members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein superfamily, the majority of 
which exhibit E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, contribute to BC initiation, 
progression, and metastasis by exerting functions as either oncoproteins or 
tumor suppressors. TRIM proteins participate in diverse cellular processes and 
signaling pathways. In this review, we discuss the specific molecular mechanisms 
by which TRIM proteins influence BC development, including post-transcriptional 
modifications, regulation of apoptosis and autophagy, cell cycle control, and 
metabolic reprogramming of glucose and lipid pathways. A notable feature of TRIM 
proteins is their engagement in diverse cellular processes and signaling 
pathways, coupled with their ability to play opposing roles - either promoting 
or inhibiting BC development - thus reflecting a 'yin and yang' paradigm. 
Collectively, current data suggest that TRIM genes and their protein products 
represent promising targets for therapeutic intervention and potential 
biomarkers for BC prognosis and disease progression.

Modulating the signaling axis between tumors and their environment is one of the 
key strategies to slow down the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
In this study, we aimed to design a polyethylene glycolated liposome loaded with 
thymoquinone (PEG-TQ-LP) as a delivery system to investigate its effect on HCC 
progression and the underlying mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. The study 
revealed the inhibitory effects of PEG-TQ-LP on the proliferation of HCC cells 
and facilitated apoptosis. The observed effect can be explained by the increased 
expression of BAX and the decreased expression of BCL2. The activation of 
p38-MAPK has been implicated in the anti-oncogenic impact of PEG-TQ-LP. This 
activation was correlated with the dephosphorylation of MEK and ERK. The in vivo 
study confirmed that PEG-TQ-LP reduces the detrimental effects of free TQ on 
liver tissue, suppresses tumor growth, and reestablishes the oxidative state 
equilibrium. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated that TQ docked well with 
three key targets. The findings from current investigations may represent a 
novel strategy for the treatment of liver cancer, as PEG-TQ-LP potently promotes 
apoptosis. This is achieved via thymoquinone's ability to bind to cancer protein 
targets' active sites, which indicates that it functions similarly to anticancer 
medications.

Cervical cancer (CC) is a major malignancy and a serious threat to women's 
health worldwide. The role of FAM72A in CC remains poorly defined. This study 
aimed to investigate its function in CC progression and its impact on the 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. FAM72A expression in CC was examined using TCGA-CESC and 
GEO (GSE63514) datasets, and then validated in CC tissues and cell lines. 
Functional assays assessed cell proliferation (CCK-8, EdU), invasion 
(Transwell), apoptosis (flow cytometry), and epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT; Western blot for E-cadherin/N-cadherin). The role of FAM72A in the 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was further evaluated by Western blot and pharmacological 
modulation with the activator 740 Y-P and the inhibitor LY294002. In vivo, a 
xenograft model with BALB/c nude mice was used to assess tumor growth, apoptosis 
(TUNEL staining), proliferation (Ki-67 IHC), and pathway activation (p-PI3K, 
p-AKT, and p-mTOR). FAM72A expression was upregulated in CC tissues and 
correlated with poor survival. Subgroup analysis showed that high FAM72A 
expression was associated with advanced FIGO stage, lymph node metastasis, and 
deep stromal invasion, indicating a link with aggressive clinical features. 
FAM72A silencing suppressed proliferation and invasion but promoted apoptosis, 
mainly through inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Conversely, FAM72A 
overexpression enhanced these malignant traits. In vivo, FAM72A knockdown 
reduced tumor burden and altered EMT markers and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway 
activity. FAM72A promotes CC progression, at least in part, through activation 
of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, supporting its value as a potential therapeutic 
target.

BACKGROUND: Desmoglein-2 (DSG2), a calcium-dependent transmembrane glycoprotein, 
serves as a critical mediator of intercellular adhesion by functioning as an 
integral component of desmosomal junctions. Aberrant expression of DSG2 has been 
implicated in the pathogenesis of a diverse array of malignancies. However, the 
expression patterns and functional significance of DSG2 in the context of colon 
cancer (CC) remain inadequately characterized. Consequently, this study was 
designed to comprehensively elucidate DSG2 expression and evaluate its potential 
prognostic utility in CC.
METHODS: Tumor specimens from 104 CC patients and 77 samples of adjacent 
paraneoplastic tissue were procured, accompanied by the corresponding 
clinicopathological data from the contributing patients. Immunohistochemical 
analyses were performed on all samples using tissue microarrays. Variations in 
DSG2 expression between CC tissues and adjacent paraneoplastic tissues, along 
with the association between DSG2 expression and clinicopathological parameters 
of CC, were evaluated using the χ2 test. The Cox proportional hazards regression 
model was utilized for both univariate and multivariate analyses, while survival 
curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method. All statistical 
computations and graph plotting were executed using R software (version 4.2.0).
RESULTS: DSG2 expression was significantly lower in CC tissues compared to 
peri-cancerous tissues (P < 0.05). DSG2 expression exhibited significant 
correlations with tumor differentiation (P = 0.041) and distant metastasis 
(P < 0.05). Univariate Cox regression analysis indicated that overall survival 
(OS) in CC patients was significantly associated with tumor size (HR = 1.649, 
95% CI: 1.007-2.700, P = 0.047), lymph node metastasis (HR = 2.102, 95% CI: 
1.284-3.440, P = 0.003), distant metastasis (HR = 2.459, 95% CI: 1.502-4.026, 
P < 0.001), and DSG2 expression (HR = 0.399, 95% CI: 0.237-0.672, P = 0.001). 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that lymph node metastasis 
(HR = 1.872, 95% CI: 1.136-3.085, P = 0.014), distant metastasis (HR = 1.756, 
95% CI: 1.024-3.011, P = 0.041), and low DSG2 expression (HR = 0.529, 95% CI: 
0.305-0.916, P = 0.023) are independent prognostic factors for overall survival 
(OS).
CONCLUSION: Diminished DSG2 expression is correlated with reduced survival rates 
in CC patients, suggesting that DSG2 could serve as a potential prognostic 
biomarker for CC.

Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKis) are highly effective drugs for treating 
inflammatory rheumatic diseases. The randomized ORAL surveillance trial showed 
that patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) aged 50 years and older with at 
least 1 more cardiovascular risk factor had an increased risk of malignant 
diseases with the JAKi tofacitinib compared to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors; 
however, this result has not been replicated in subsequent studies. An analysis 
of the German RABBIT register now revealed an overall slightly increased cancer 
risk in RA patients ever treated with JAKi compared to those ever treated with 
biological (b) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). During or after 
2285 JAKi treatment episodes and 4259 bDMARD treatment episodes, 88 and 135 
malignant diseases occurred, respectively, resulting in a rate of 11.6 (95% 
confidence interval, CI: 9.3-14.3) events for JAKis and 8.9 (95% CI: 7.4-10.5) 
events for bDMARDs per 1000 patient years. The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.40 
(95% CI: 1.09-1.80), which is comparable to the results from the ORAL 
surveillance study. Particularly affected by the observed risk increase were 
patients aged 60 years and older, those with high disease activity and those who 
had already received ≥ 3 treatments with conventional synthetic DMARDs. Other 
above-average affected groups included smokers, male patients and patients with 
an RA duration of > 10 years. When treating patients with an increased risk, 
clinicians should carefully consider together with them whether this observed 
risk outweighs the potential risks of discontinuing or withholding a highly 
effective treatment such as JAKis, bearing in mind that inadequate disease 
control is also associated with an increased risk of cancer. When in doubt, the 
results from RABBIT should not discourage physicians from prescribing a JAKi 
treatment to patients who need it. It could be a way forward to ensure that a 
close cancer screening is carried out for risk patients treated with JAKis.

Publisher: Januskinaseinhibitoren (JAKis) sind sehr wirksame Medikamente zur 
Behandlung entzündlich rheumatischer Erkrankungen. In der randomisierten Studie 
ORAL Surveillance wurde gezeigt, dass es bei Patient:innen mit rheumatoider 
Arthritis (RA) im Alter ab 50 Jahren mit mindestens einem weiteren 
kardiovaskulären Risikofaktor zu einem erhöhten Auftreten bösartiger 
Erkrankungen bei dem JAKi Tofacitinib im Vergleich zu 
Tumornekrosefaktorinhibitoren kommt. Dieses Ergebnis wurde in anderen Studien 
seither jedoch nicht bestätigt. In einer Auswertung des deutschen 
RABBIT-Registers wurde nun ein insgesamt leicht erhöhtes Krebsrisiko bei jemals 
mit JAKi behandelten gegenüber jemals mit biologischen (b) 
krankheitsmodifizierenden Antirheumatika (DMARDs) behandelten RA-Patient:innen 
beobachtet. Während oder nach 2285 JAKi- und 4259 bDMARD-Behandlungsepisoden 
traten 88 bzw. 135 bösartige Erkrankungen auf, pro 1000 Patient:innenjahre waren 
das 11,6 (95 %-Konfidenzintervall (KI): 9,3–14,3) Ereignisse bei JAKis und 8,9 
(95%-KI: 7,4–10,5) Ereignisse bei bDMARDs. Das adjustierte Hazard Ratio betrug 
1,40 (95%-KI: 1,09–1,80) und war damit jener aus der ORAL Surveillance-Studie 
vergleichbar. Besonders von der beobachteten Risikoerhöhung betroffen waren 
Patient:innen ab 60 Jahren, mit einer hohen Krankheitsaktivität oder ≥ 3 
früheren Behandlungen mit konventionellen synthetischen DMARDs. Weitere 
überdurchschnittlich betroffene Gruppen waren Raucher:innen, Männer sowie 
Patient:innen mit über 10 Jahren RA-Krankheitsdauer. Behandelnde sollten mit 
Risikopatient:innen sorgfältig gemeinsam abwägen, ob die beobachtete 
Risikoerhöhung die potenziellen Risiken des Absetzens oder des Vorenthaltens 
einer hochwirksamen Therapie mit einem JAKi überwiegt – denn auch eine 
unzureichende Krankheitskontrolle führt zu einem erhöhten Krebsrisiko. Die 
Ergebnisse aus RABBIT sollten Ärzt:innen im Zweifel nicht davon abhalten, 
Patient:innen, die eine JAKi-Therapie benötigen, mit dieser zu behandeln. Ein 
Ausweg könnte vielmehr sein, bei JAKi-Therapie von Risikopatient:innen auf eine 
engmaschige Krebsvorsorge zu achten.

BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dysfunction affects the development of ovarian cancer 
(OC). ETV4 is involved in mitochondrial fusion. The regulatory pathways of ETV4 
in OC cells have not been further investigated. In this study, we aimed to 
explore the effects of ETV4 on OC development and analyze the downstream 
regulatory pathways of ETV4.
METHODS: The expression of ETV4 in OC cell lines (SK-OV-3, HEY, A2780, and 
OVCAR-3) was verified. After silencing ETV4, indicators related to mitochondrial 
function, including ATP level, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial 
DNA (mtDNA), and mitochondrial ROS (mtROS), were analyzed. The expression of 
mitochondrial fission/fusion-related markers (Mfn1, Mfn2, OPA1, DRP1, MFF, and 
FIS1) was detected. In vivo experiments were used to verify the effect of ETV4 
on OC development.
RESULTS: The TCGA-OV data indicated that ETV4 was highly expressed in OC. 
Silencing ETV4 inhibited the proliferation of OC cells. Mitochondrial membrane 
potential and ATP levels increased after ETV4 silencing, while mtDNA and mtROS 
levels decreased. ETV4 silencing promoted Mfn2 protein expression but did not 
affect Mfn2 mRNA level. Mfn2-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH9 was targeted 
and regulated by ETV4. MARCH9 overexpression alleviated the regulation of ETV4 
silencing on mitochondrial function in OC cells. Lysosomal inhibitor CQ blocked 
the degradation of ubiquitinated Mfn2 protein. MARCH9 was found to mediate 
robust ubiquitination of Mfn2 via the K63-linked ubiquitination.
CONCLUSIONS: ETV4 was highly expressed in OC and involved in the regulation of 
mitochondrial function. ETV4 regulated Mfn2 ubiquitination linked by K63 by 
regulating MARCH9.

PURPOSE: Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (AANHPI) are 
the fastest-growing racial and ethnic group in the U.S., yet they face 
significant, poorly characterized disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) care. 
Disaggregated data is crucial for understanding and addressing these disparities 
within the community.
METHODS: Using the 2020 National Cancer Database (NCDB), we conducted a 
retrospective cohort study to examine treatment patterns and overall survival 
(OS) among AANHPI and non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients diagnosed with Stage I 
to IV CRC. We employed multivariable-adjusted logistic regression and Cox 
proportional hazard models to assess the risk of delayed cancer treatment and 
mortality across five geographic AANHPI subpopulations.
RESULTS: Among 873,622 patients with CRC, 42,026 were AANHPI patients (mean age, 
63.2 years [SD: 14.1], 48% female), of whom 31.3% were East Asian. Compared to 
NHW patients, patients identified as East Asian, Southeast Asian, and Other 
Asian were significantly more likely to experience delayed cancer-related 
treatment (adjusted Odds Ratio [95% confidence interval],1.26 [1.19-1.33], 1.31 
[1.22-1.40], and 1.29 [1.21-1.39], respectively). Meanwhile, AANHPI 
subpopulations demonstrated significantly better OS across cancer stages I-IV 
(adjusted Hazard Ratio range: 0.55 [Other Asian with stage I] - 0.90 [Southeast 
Asian with stage IV]). Patients who received surgery, chemotherapy or 
immunotherapy as their first-line treatment had significant risk reduction 
compared to those who did not undergo systemic treatment, particularly among 
individuals diagnosed with stage III or IV CRC.
CONCLUSION: Despite experiencing significant delays in cancer-related care, 
AANHPI patients demonstrated superior OS compared to NHW patients across all CRC 
stages. This paradoxical finding of treatment delays coupled with improved 
survival outcomes warrants further investigation into potential protective 
factors and underscores the importance of disaggregated approaches to 
understanding disparities within the diverse AANHPI populations.

In this study, we discussed the impact of CIITA on the occurrence and 
development of gastric cancer, as well as its potential mechanisms. In this 
study, N87-C and AGS were used as in vitro research subjects. After knocking 
down and overexpressing CIITA, CCK8, ELISA, reactive oxygen species (ROS), JC-1, 
immunofluorescence and western blot were used to assess the effect of CIITA on 
ferroptosis. To further validate the potential mechanism of CIITA, we continued 
to transfect lentiviruses cloned with ACSL4 knockdown into cells and repeated 
the above experiment. In addition, we constructed a subcutaneous transplant 
tumor model to validate the results of in vitro experiments. In vitro 
experiments showed that overexpressed CIITA promoted ferroptosis in gastric 
cancer cells, manifested as the decreased cell viability, increased ROS 
production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and changes in the 
expression of ferroptosis-related proteins and secreted factors. After knocking 
down CIITA, the above results were reversed, inhibiting ferroptosis. In 
addition, we confirmed that the effect of CIITA on ferroptosis was related to 
ACSL4. In vitro experiments also confirmed that CIITA overexpression promoted 
ferroptosis and inhibited tumor growth, while low CIITA had the opposite effect. 
Overexpressed CIITA promoted ferroptosis and inhibited gastric cancer growth by 
upregulating ACSL4. CIITA may be a potential therapeutic target for gastric 
cancer and may have certain predictive value in future clinical applications.

BACKGROUND: Surgery with systematic lymph node (LN) dissection remains the 
primary treatment for early-stage and locally advanced operable non-small-cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the effect of the log odds of negative lymph 
nodes/T stage (LONT) in NSCLC remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the 
correlation between LONT and prognosis of stage I-III NSCLC patients who 
underwent resection.
METHODS: Clinical data from patients who underwent NSCLC resection were 
extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. 
The log odds of negative LONT, defined as log(NLNs + 1)/T stage, was calculated 
for each patient. The nonlinear relationship between LONT and overall survival 
(OS) and lung cancer-specific survival (LCSS) was evaluated using the cubic 
spline smoothing technique and Cox regression. The optimal LONT cut-off point 
was determined using X-tile plots, and propensity score matching (PSM) was 
performed to minimize inter-group differences.
RESULTS: LONT demonstrated a nonlinear positive relationship with both OS and 
LCSS. Based on X-tile plot-determined cut-off point of 0.60, participants were 
categorized into low (< 0.60) and high (≥ 0.60) LONT subgroups. Both before and 
after PSM, the high LONT group exhibited significantly better OS and LCSS 
compared to the low LONT group (both P < 0.001). Similar survival differences 
were observed in subgroup analyses based on lymph node status and TNM stage. 
LONT was an independent predictor of OS (HR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.74-0.81, P < 0.001) 
and LCSS (HR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.71-0.78, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: LONT is a novel robust prognostic factor that could complement TNM 
staging system. A higher LONT is associated with better survival in stage I-III 
NSCLC patients who received resection.

Observation of the impact of applying the fast track surgery concept during the 
perioperative period of breast-conserving surgery for breast cancer on the 
effectiveness of patient care and complications.

OBJECTIVE: To observe the impact of applying the fast track surgery (FTS) 
concept during the perioperative period of breast-conserving surgery for breast 
cancer on the effectiveness of patient care and the occurrence of complications.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of clinical data was conducted for 92 cases of 
breast cancer patients admitted to our hospital from January 2022 to January 
2023. All patients underwent breast-conserving surgery at our hospital and met 
the inclusion criteria. Patients were divided into two groups based on the 
different nursing interventions during the perioperative period: the control 
group (n = 46) received conventional nursing interventions, while the 
observation group (n = 46) received nursing interventions based on the fast 
track surgery concept. The nursing effectiveness, postoperative recovery, serum 
inflammatory factor levels, psychological negative emotions, and complication 
occurrence were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: The overall nursing effectiveness rate in the control group was 80.43%, 
while it was 95.65% in the observation group, which was significantly higher 
than that in the control group (P<0.05). The observation group showed 
significantly shorter times for getting out of bed, drainage removal, initiation 
of oral intake, wound healing, and hospital stay, as well as lower levels of 
pain compared to the control group (P<0.05). Before intervention, there were no 
significant differences in IL-6, TNF-α, and NF-κB levels between the two groups 
(P>0.05). However, after intervention, the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and NF-κB in 
the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group 
(P<0.05). Before intervention, there were no significant differences in SAS and 
SDS scores between the two groups (P>0.05). However, after intervention, the SAS 
and SDS scores in the observation group were significantly lower than those in 
the control group (P<0.05). The complication rate in the control group was 
23.91%, while it was 8.70% in the observation group, and the observation group 
had a significantly lower complication rate than the control group (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The application of the fast track surgery concept during the 
perioperative period of breast-conserving surgery for breast cancer yields 
favorable results. Compared to conventional nursing interventions, fast track 
surgery concept-based nursing further enhances patient outcomes, improves the 
body's inflammatory response, and mitigates adverse emotions, thereby 
accelerating patient recovery and reducing the risk of surgery-related 
complications. This approach is worthy of clinical promotion.

Advancements in pediatric cancer treatment protocols have significantly improved 
long-term survival. This has been accompanied by a growing recognition of 
morbidity and mortality associated with late effects of treatment, including 
kidney disease. Surviving cancer in childhood implies exposure to multiple 
nephrotoxic insults, some of which carry a greater risk for the development of 
chronic kidney disease and progression to kidney failure than others. In 
childhood cancer survivors who develop kidney failure, a kidney transplant is a 
potential life-prolonging treatment option. However, the optimal timing of 
transplant in relation to remission, particularly when weighing morbidity 
associated with increased time on dialysis against the risk of cancer recurrence 
associated with transplant immunosuppression, remains controversial. This review 
explores nephrotoxicity and kidney-related complications of cancer treatment, 
kidney disease screening guidelines, and considerations for kidney transplant in 
childhood cancer survivors including timing from remission to transplant, cancer 
recurrence in the setting of post-transplant immunosuppression, and transplant 
outcomes.

We developed DHX-Biotin-V, an NIR fluorescent probe that selectively detects 
viscosity with minimal interference from polarity or pH. It targets biotin 
receptors to enter tumor cells, where its fluorescence activates specifically in 
high-viscosity microenvironments. This probe enables real-time monitoring of 
intracellular viscosity, distinguishes between cancerous and normal cells, and 
provides specific tumor imaging in vivo, demonstrating significant promise for 
tumor diagnosis.

The discovery of novel targeted therapies for esophageal cancer represents an 
urgent clinical need. Herein, we reported the rational design and synthesis of 
novel PI3K/BRD4 dual inhibitors for the treatment of esophageal cancer. 
Systematic structure-activity relationship studies identified compound 23 as a 
potent dual-targeting inhibitor that effectively suppresses PI3K and BRD4 
signaling. In vitro, 23 inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony 
formation of esophageal cancer cells. In vivo, 23 demonstrated anticancer 
efficacy comparable to that of the BKM120/JQ1 combination treatment in a KYSE450 
xenograft mouse model. Mechanistically, 23 induces cellular senescence via the 
AMPK-p27 pathway. Significantly, the senolytic agent ABT737 enhanced the 
efficacy of compound 23 through the selective clearance of senescent cancer 
cells. Collectively, this work establishes 23 as a promising PI3K/BRD4 
dual-targeting lead and supports senescence induction combined with senolytics 
as a novel strategy for esophageal cancer treatment.

DESCRIPTION: T1 colorectal cancer (CRC), defined as tumor invasion confined to 
the submucosa, has traditionally been managed by surgery. Advances in endoscopic 
resection techniques, coupled with an improved understanding of tumor biology 
and risk of lymph node metastasis and recurrence, have expanded our treatment 
armamentarium for these lesions. The purpose of this American 
Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update Expert Commentary 
is to review the definition of T1 CRC, discuss the role of endoscopic resection 
for these lesions, review factors associated with risk of recurrence and 
metastasis, and discuss post-resection management, including surveillance or 
adjuvant surgery. The target audience for this commentary includes primary care, 
gastroenterology, pathology, and surgical health care professionals.
METHODS: This expert commentary was commissioned and approved by the AGA 
Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board 
to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA 
membership and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer 
review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology.

University (Sechenov University), Moscow, Russia.

BACKGROUND: The retroperitoneal approach is an innovative, minimally invasive 
technique that may benefit patients with colorectal cancer who have significant 
comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, or extensive 
intra-abdominal adhesions.
IMPACT OF INNOVATION: We present a novel retroperitoneal approach for the 
minimally invasive surgical treatment of synchronous multiple colon cancers.
TECHNOLOGY MATERIALS AND METHODS: An interfascial dissection through the 
retroperitoneal space was performed on the left side in the medial direction. 
The left ureter and gonadal vessels served as the primary landmarks. The 
inferior mesenteric vessels were identified, clipped, and cut. The horizontal 
portion of the duodenum served as the cranial landmark for dissection. 
Dissection continued medially through the embryonic layers to identify the roots 
of the ileocolic artery and vein. The vessels were exposed to the surrounding 
tissue, clipped, and cut. Laparoscopic mobilization of the entire colon was 
performed.
PRELIMINARY RESULTS: The operation lasted 510 min, with the retroperitoneal step 
requiring 205 min. Total blood loss was 200 mL. The postoperative pain intensity 
was low, and recovery was uneventful. The patient was discharged on 
postoperative day 7.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The retroperitoneal approach appears to be a 
feasible and minimally invasive option for total colectomy in selected patients 
with multiple synchronous colon cancers. Further studies are warranted to assess 
the safety, reproducibility, and long-term oncologic outcomes. See New 
Technology Report Video.

BACKGROUND: Pelvic exenteration is the treatment of choice for selected patients 
with locally advanced primary and recurrent rectal cancer. Involvement of major 
pelvic neurovascular structures and bone were historically considered 
contraindications due to unacceptably high rates of morbidity and low R0 
resection rates.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of these ""high-complexity"" exenterative 
resections to those of ""conventional"" pelvic exenteration.
DESIGN: International multicenter retrospective cohort study.
SETTINGS: Sixteen specialized exenteration centers.
PATIENTS: Those who underwent total pelvic exenteration for locally advanced 
primary and recurrent rectal cancer between 2018 and 2023 at participating 
centers.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perioperative resource utilization, morbidity, mortality 
and R0 resection rates were reported.
RESULTS: 763 patients underwent total pelvic exenteration, of which 478 (63%) 
and 285 patients (37%) required conventional and high-complexity procedures, 
respectively. High-complexity pelvic exenteration was associated with longer 
operating time (600 vs 480 mins, p < 0.001 for locally advanced primary rectal 
cancer, 623 vs 480 mins, p < 0.001 for locally recurrent rectal cancer), 
intensive care stay (2 vs 1 day, p < 0.001 and 3 vs 1 day, p < 0.001), hospital 
stay (19 vs 15 days, p = 0.008 and 23 vs 15 days, p < 0.001) and higher blood 
loss (2000 vs 1236 mL, p < 0.001 and 3000 vs 1600 mL, p < 0.001). Morbidity and 
mortality outcomes, and R0 resection rates were similar between the groups.
LIMITATIONS: Generalizability of findings outside of expert units.
CONCLUSIONS: High-complexity pelvic exenteration for the treatment of rectal 
cancer is associated with similar morbidity, mortality, and R0 resection rates, 
but significantly higher operative time, blood loss, and hospital resource 
utilization compared to conventional pelvic exenteration. In high volume, 
specialized centers, these techniques are considered the standard of care for 
appropriately selected patients with tumors that involve major pelvic bone or 
neurovascular structures. See Video Abstract.

Aberrant expression of the oncogene SALL4 is associated with stemness, more 
aggressive cancer phenotype, and reduced patient survival in various tumor types 
making SALL4 a potential target for cancer immunotherapy. We conducted a 
transcriptional analysis of SALL4 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues 
and demonstrated that SALL4 was overexpressed in primary tumor and paired liver 
metastasis. Then, we identified the SALL4-derived S9V peptide as a naturally 
processed peptide that induced specific CD8+ T-cell responses from the 
peripheral blood of gastrointestinal cancer patients whereas no responses were 
observed for the peripheral blood of healthy donors. Thereafter, we isolated a 
SALL4-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) that recognized this peptide in the most 
common HLA molecule in the Caucasian population, HLA-A2, and used this to 
develop TCR-engineered T cells. In vitro analysis showed that SALL4 
TCR-redirected primary CD8+ T cells exhibited cytotoxic effects against 
SALL4-expressing tumor cells and produced effector cytokines. In vivo, SALL4-TCR 
T cells significantly reduced tumor growth and improved survival of 
tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, SALL4-TCR T cells displayed no toxicity against 
hematopoietic stem cells. Thus, we conclude that T cells engineered to express a 
SALL4-specific TCR have the potential to be effective as immunotherapy for solid 
cancers and pave the way for further clinical development.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has transformed colorectal cancers (CRCs) 
therapy, yet the majority of microsatellite-stable (MSS) CRCs remain refractory 
due to insufficient tumor-immune cell crosstalk. Identifying molecular 
regulators that modulate the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is crucial for 
expanding ICB efficacy. Here, we identified HNRNPA2B1, an RNA-binding protein 
prominently upregulated in CRC, as a key driver of immune evasion. Despite low 
cytotoxicity to normal cells, HNRNPA2B1 rewired the TIME by suppressing 
Cxcl9/Cxcl10-Cxcr3 signaling, CD8+ T-cell infiltration, and MHC class I antigen 
presentation, resulting in a non-inflamed (""cold"") tumor state. HNRNPA2B1 
deletion reprogramed the TIME, enhanced CD8+ T cell-mediated tumor clearance, 
and sensitized MSS CRCs to ICB. A computational A2B1 score was developed to 
quantify HNRNPA2B1'simpact on tumor-immune interactions, and showed that it 
strongly correlated with immune infiltration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
status, and patient prognosis, supporting its potential role as a biomarker for 
ICB responsiveness in CRC.

INTRODUCTION: The ethyl acetate extract of Wenxia Formula (WFEA) is the most 
effective antitumor component of the Wenxia formula. Its key active components, 
emodin and quercetin, exhibit unique advantages in targeting TGF-β1 and 
regulating the function of Tregs. This study explored the mechanism of WFEA in 
enhancing the immune environment in lung cancer by influencing immune cell 
balance and the level of cytokines.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lewis lung cancer xenograft mouse models were 
established. WFEA was administered at low (100 mg/kg), medium (200 mg/kg), and 
high (400 mg/kg) doses, while a cisplatin (DDP) group served as the positive 
control. Tumor weight, spleen index, and serum cytokine levels (IL-10, TGF-β1) 
were measured. Flow cytometry, qPCR, and immunohistochemistry were employed to 
analyze the proportion of CD4⁺CD25⁺Foxp3⁺ Treg cells and Foxp3 expression in 
tumor and spleen tissues. The regulatory mechanism of WFEA on the TGF-β/Smads 
signaling pathway was investigated via combined intervention with the TGF-β1 
inhibitor halofuginone (HF), cell differentiation assays, and molecular docking 
analyses.
RESULTS: WFEA inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner, with the 400 
mg/kg group exhibiting a 60% tumor inhibition rate comparable to that of DDP. 
The agent significantly increased the spleen index by 106.42% and reduced serum 
levels of IL-10 and TGF-β1. Mechanistically, WFEA downregulated Foxp3 mRNA and 
protein expression in both tumor and spleen tissues, leading to a decrease in 
the proportion of Treg cells. It blocked the TGF-β/Smads pathway by 
downregulating TGF-β1, upregulating Smad4/Smad7, and inhibiting Smad2/3 
phosphorylation. Cell-based experiments confirmed that WFEA-containing serum 
inhibited the differentiation of CD4⁺ T cells into Tregs, an effect enhanced by 
TGF-β1 interference. Molecular docking analyses revealed that the active 
components emodin and quercetin directly bound to TGF-β1 with binding energies 
of -5.4 kcal/mol and -5.1 kcal/mol, respectively.
DISCUSSION: WFEA could serve as a new adjunct treatment for lung cancer; 
however, further clinical trials are required to evaluate its long-term safety 
and effectiveness across various treatment stages.
CONCLUSION: WFEA may regulate the growth of Tregs to modulate the immune 
microenvironment of the LLC model mice, indicating its potential as an anti-LLC 
agent.

INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is among the most prominent malignant tumors in 
the male population, characterized by growing morbidity, a high fatality rate, 
and currently limited therapeutic options, necessitating the urgent development 
of novel clinical medications. The objective of the current study was to examine 
the therapeutic potential of zingerone in prostate cancer cells.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanism by which 
zingerone exerts its anticancer effects in prostate cancer cells. We conducted 
various in vitro and in silico experiments to determine the therapeutic efficacy 
and mechanism of action of zingerone.
RESULTS: Cytotoxicity analysis of zingerone revealed its substantial cytotoxic 
impact and ability to elevate lactose dehydrogenase levels in DU145 cells. Using 
the MTT assay, we determined that a concentration of 24.84 μM zingerone in DU145 
cells grown for 24 h resulted in an IC50 value. Zingerone effectively induced 
apoptosis by increasing the levels of cytochrome c and caspase in DU145 cells. 
Regarding the identification of signs of ferroptosis, evidence has been shown 
for the presence of heightened mitochondrial ROS, disrupted mitochondrial 
membrane potential, increased levels of glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde 
(MDA), and reduced expression of SCL7A11 and GPX4.
DISCUSSION: Importantly, our study confirms that zingerone triggered both 
apoptosis and ferroptosis in DU145 cells by downregulating SLC7A11 and GPX4 
expression.
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that makes zingerone a potent 
therapeutic agent for prostate cancer.

Accurate localization of early gastric cancer (EGC) remains challenging due to 
its morphological resemblance to gastritis. This study presents an artificial 
intelligence (AI)-assisted bedside diagnostic system to enhance EGC detection by 
visualizing gastric mucosal acidity. The ATPase H+/K+ transport β subunit 
(ATP4B), a key regulator of acid secretion, is progressively downregulated in 
gastric mucosal atrophy and intestinal metaplasia, and significantly reduced in 
EGC. A surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) microarray is developed to map 
mucosal pH in 50 patient specimens (1,516 points), with founding compared to 
pathological images. A multi-model neural network is trained and validated 
internally on data from 40 patients (1,127 points) and externally validated on 
10 patients (389 points). Using an optimal pH threshold of 6.845, the system 
achieved a strong correlation (R2 = 0.79) and low error (SSE = 71.83). External 
validation demonstrated 87.79% sensitivity, 85.04% specificity, 86.89% accuracy, 
and a κ score of 0.71. This system detected mild pH shifts in atrophic gastritis 
with intestinal metaplasia, but marked increases with EGC onset, and is able to 
predict inflammation prior to pathology confirmation. By integrating pH mapping 
with morphological features, this approach enables precise EGC localization, 
improves guidance for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), and reduces 
false-positive diagnoses.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a fatal cancer with poor prognosis. 
COP9 signalosome subunit 6 (CSN6), a key regulator of different E3 ubiquitin 
ligases, plays oncogenic roles in various cancers. However, its function in PDAC 
remains elusive. Here, this demonstrates that human PDAC tumors expressing high 
levels of CSN6 present with poor prognosis and gemcitabine resistance. 
Conditional knockout (KO) of CSN6 hinders tumor formation in a KPP spontaneous 
PDAC mouse model. Proteomic analysis indicates that CSN6 promotes ribosome 
biogenesis by activating rDNA transcription and protein synthesis. 
Mechanistically, CSN6 antagonizes DDB1-CUL4 associated factor 1 (DCAF1)-mediated 
ubiquitination of Nucleophosmin (NPM1), thereby promoting NPM1-orchestrated 
ribosome biogenesis. In line with CSN6-mediated gemcitabine resistance, 
CSN6-NPM1 axis enhances ribosome biogenesis, thereby promoting translation of 
gemcitabine resistance genes, including Cytidine deaminase (CDA), Ribonucleotide 
reductase subunit M1/2 (RRM1/2). Significantly, combining gemcitabine with NPM1 
inhibitor NSC348884 synergistically suppresses CSN6-high pancreatic cancer 
xenografts. Clinically, CSN6 expression positively correlates with NPM1 in PDAC 
tissues, and their concurrent high expression is significantly associated with 
poor clinical outcomes. This study characterizes CSN6 as an oncogenic protein 
that promotes NPM1 stabilization by interacting with DCAF1, thereby enhancing 
ribosome biogenesis and cellular resistance to gemcitabine in PDAC. NPM1 may 
serve as a therapeutic target for CSN6 high PDAC that exhibits gemcitabine drug 
resistance.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the 
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
Questionnaire for Colorectal Cancer for Serbian patients.
METHODS: The prospective cohort study was conducted at the Clinic for Digestive 
Surgery, University Clinical Center of Serbia, and included 150 Serbian-speaking 
colorectal adenocarcinoma patients undergoing colorectal surgery. The 
translation process involved rigorous forward and backward translations, pilot 
testing with patients, and statistical analysis for psychometric validation, 
including internal consistency, reliability, convergent and discriminant 
validity, concurrent validity, and known-groups validity.
RESULTS: Results showed good internal consistency across most scales (Cronbach's 
alpha values ranging from 0.769 to 0.855), with excellent split-half reliability 
(0.872). Convergent and discriminant validity analyses confirmed the 
questionnaire's capacity to measure constructs it was theoretically related. The 
significant correlations were observed between corresponding scales and items of 
EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-CR29 questionnaires. Known-groups analysis 
demonstrated the tool's ability to distinguish between patient groups based on 
tumor location, stoma presence, and neoadjuvant therapy.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The Serbian version of the EORTC QLQ-CR29 is a reliable 
and valid instrument for assessing the quality of life in Serbian colorectal 
cancer patients, reflecting its potential for widespread clinical application.

Gastric cancer (GC) prognosis remains suboptimally defined by conventional 
clinicopathological parameters, necessitating integrative multi-omics approaches 
to unravel molecular heterogeneity. This study established a robust multi-omics 
prognostic framework through synergistic analysis of transcriptomic, epigenomic, 
and clinical data from 108 GC patients. Genome-wide expression profiling and 
methylation array analysis identified 1,243 survival-associated transcripts and 
8,742 prognostic CpG sites, with cross-omics integration via similarity network 
fusion revealing three molecular subtypes exhibiting distinct clinical 
trajectories. The aggressive Subtype 3 demonstrated a 2.87-fold increased 
mortality risk compared to the favorable Subtype 1, independent of age and tumor 
stage. A LASSO-derived prognostic signature integrating eight gene expression 
markers, nine methylation loci, and three clinical parameters achieved superior 
discrimination (C-index: 0.786 [95% CI: 0.748-0.824], compared to 0.687-0.752 in 
unimodal models) and 19-28% improvement in time-dependent AUC metrics. The 
multi-optimized nomogram incorporating molecular risk scores with conventional 
predictors demonstrated strong calibration (slope 0.967) and clinical utility 
across validation cohorts (C-index 0.742), significantly outperforming existing 
stratification systems. Functional characterization revealed subtype-specific 
enrichment in cell cycle dysregulation and immune evasion pathways, obtaining 
CDK/PI3K inhibitors as potential therapeutic targets. These findings establish 
multi-omics integration as a novel strategy for prognostic refinement and 
precision therapy guidance in GC.

The direct and indirect effects of socioeconomic status (SES) on colorectal 
cancer (CRC) were examined using structural equation modeling in a case-control 
study with 488 CRCs and 651 controls. SES was measured by education, income and 
resident region. SES (odds ratio (OR)=0.89), age (OR = 1.03), processed meat 
intake (OR = 1.08), lack of CRC screening (OR = 2.67), smoking (OR = 1.85) and 
family history (OR = 1.06) were significantly associated with CRC risk. SES had 
a direct effect on CRC risk (β = -0.05). An indirect effect of SES on CRC also 
existed which was mediated by processed meat intake (β = -0.02), vegetable 
intake (β = -0.01), CRC screening uptake (β = -0.02), and smoking (β = -0.02).

INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer (BC), the most prevalent cancer amongst women 
globally, exhibits a complex relationship with obesity and its associated 
factors. Chemerin, an adipokine linked to both inflammatory and metabolic 
processes, has emerged as a potential player in tumor development and 
progression. This study delves into the potential role of chemerin in breast 
cancer by analyzing its expression patterns in tumor cells, fibroblasts, and 
adipocytes alongside corresponding clinico-pathological parameters.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Encompassing 77 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma, 
the study revealed an interesting interplay between chemerin and disease 
characteristics.
RESULTS: While chemerin expression itself did not associate with established 
markers like BC stage, oestrogen receptor, or progesterone receptor status, its 
presence is elevated in patients with lymph node metastasis. Despite these 
insightful findings, the study acknowledges limitations inherent to its design. 
The absence of a healthy control group necessitates further controlled studies 
to solidify the observed associations. Additionally, external factors like diet 
and exercise, known to influence chemerin levels, were not accounted for, 
requiring more comprehensive patient history and examination data in future 
investigations.
CONCLUSIONS: While chemerin expression did not correlate with traditional BC 
markers, its apparent associations with lymph node metastasis, c-ERB2 
expression, and involvement within the tumour microenvironment warrant further 
exploration. This study paves the way for future research to elucidate the 
precise role of chemerin in BC development and progression, potentially paving 
the path for the development of novel diagnostic and prognostic tools.

The aim of the study was to review publications on the early, most accurate 
diagnosis of pathological changes in the endometrium, which occur during and 
after tamoxifen (TAM) therapy for breast cancer (BC). Accurate diagnosis of 
potential endometrial lesions is essential to make correct decisions regarding 
the necessity of adjuvant therapy with TAM. MEDLINE 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), EMBASE (http://www.embase.com) and Scopus 
(http://www.scopus.com) databases were searched using the following MeSH terms 
in titles and abstracts: (""tamoxifen endometrial hyperplasia"" OR ""tamoxifen 
endometrial pathology"" OR ""endometrial pathology tamoxifen""). No language 
restriction was used in the literature search. The search was limited to studies 
in humans. The results of an ultrasound investigation of the endometrium in 
asymptomatic BC patients receiving TAM should be interpreted with caution. An 
overdiagnosis of endometrial abnormalities, and the consequent unnecessary 
invasive diagnostic procedures could discourage some patients from continuing 
the adjuvant treatment with TAM, putting them at increased risk of recurrent BC. 
There is no evidence that patients receiving adjuvant TAM therapy could benefit 
from a screening program based on the ultrasound examination alone. Asymptomatic 
BC patients on adjuvant TAM-treatment should not be submitted routinely to 
ultrasound examination or biopsy, but encouraged to report any abnormal vaginal 
bleeding promptly.

Triple-negative breast cancer accounts for approximately 15% of all diagnosed 
breast cancers and is characterized by an aggressive clinical course resulting 
from rapid proliferation of tumor cells poses a huge therapeutic challenge. The 
shortened, in comparison with other subtypes of breast cancer, progression free 
survival or the limited influence of the chemotherapy used on the overall 
survival imply the necessity of searching for new therapies. The use of 
monoclonal antibodies conjugated with a cytostatic initially allowed selective 
introduction of the drug into tumor cells showing expression of strictly defined 
receptor proteins on the cell membrane surface. Modification of the linkers 
binding the cytostatic to the antibody, on the other hand, allowed activation of 
the by-stander effect, allowing effective destruction of tumor cells lacking 
expression of specific antigens on their surface. Sacituzumab govitecan 
(anti-TROP2 antibody conjugated with inhibitor of topoisomerase I) improve 
median progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with advanced, 
metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Similarly, a beneficial effect from 
the use of ADCs (trastuzumab deruxtecan) was observed in patients with low HER2 
expression. These therapeutic advances are reflected in clinical guidelines from 
leading organizations such as ASCO and ESMO, and have become the basis for 
ongoing clinical trials evaluating new ADCs with different molecular targets and 
cytotoxic mechanisms. This paper reviews the most important studies evaluating 
the clinical effect of ADCs in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.

Characterizing chlorotriazine effects in cancer-relevant high-throughput 
screening assays.

Karmaus AL(1), Charlton A(1).

Author information:
(1)Syngenta Crop Protection, LLC, Greensboro, NC, United States.

INTRODUCTION: High-throughput screening (HTS) in vitro testing can be a powerful 
tool for evaluating chemicals across an abundance of mechanistic, targeted assay 
systems. This study reviewed HTS in vitro data for the systematic evaluation of 
endpoints relevant to carcinogenesis. To these means, we focused on assay 
endpoints from the ToxCast/Tox21 HTS program that have been mapped to Key 
Characteristics of Carcinogens (KCCs) to help focus our review on the ∼750 assay 
endpoints that have been previously identified as potentially informative for 
evaluating modes of action relevant to carcinogenesis.
METHODS: Data for ToxCast/Tox21 HTS assay endpoints were retrieved from the 
publicly accessible invitrodb v4.2 and reviewed for five chlorotriazine 
herbicides (atrazine, cyanazine, propazine, simazine, and terbuthylazine) to 
evaluate any indication of cancer-relevant bioactivity. More specifically, we 
present a workflow comprising the use of a focused assay endpoint inventory 
based on KCC attribution, integration of assay flags to identify robust 
bioactivity, and putting in vitro mechanistic insights into context with 
literature-based context for toxicokinetic considerations and in vivo evidence.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: There were common targets consistently identified as 
bioactive across the chemical class including induction of estrone levels and 
potential CAR/PXR activation. These findings were put in context by utilizing in 
vivo data and knowledge about atrazine to weigh the evidence. Though the 
ToxCast/Tox21 HTS mechanistic assays did not yield novel insights into 
chlorotriazine carcinogenicity, our workflow exemplifies how starting from 
mechanistic screening data and integrating apical endpoints can be conducted. By 
providing context to in vitro ToxCast/Tox21 data with toxicokinetics information 
and available in vivo study outcomes demonstrates how the HTS data and KCC 
framework can be applied to review a chemical class for carcinogenicity 
potential.

Jiashan, Zhejiang, China.

OBJECTIVES: To provide a meta-analysis evaluating the predictive value of 
lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) in the efficacy and prognosis of bladder 
cancer patients.
METHODS: Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, and PubMed for literature searching 
up to November 2024 to identify research assessing the prognostic significance 
of LMR in bladder cancer patients. Outcomes included overall survival (OS), 
relapse-free survival (RFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and 
cancer-specific survival (CSS). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) were used for data pooling of survival variables. In addition, for 
investigating potential heterogeneity sources and assessing the stability of the 
findings, sensitivity and subgroup analysis were performed. Review Manger 5.4 
and STATA 15.1 were used to analyze.
RESULTS: Seventeen studies with 7,968 patients with bladder cancer included. The 
results indicated a notably shorter OS (HR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.29, 1.89; P 
<0.00001), RFS (HR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.27, 2.36; P = 0.0005), PFS (HR: 2.04; 95% 
CI: 1.58, 2.64; P<0.00001) and CSS (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.52; P = 0.04) in 
patients with low LMR compared to those with high LMR. Furthermore, subgroup 
analysis of OS found that study design, region, and age were the main factors 
affecting the correlation between LMR and OS.
CONCLUSIONS: LMR can effectively predict the survival and recurrence risk of 
bladder cancer patients, helpingin the improvement of their prognosis. Future 
research should focus on large-scale, multicenter prospective cohort studies are 
still required in the future to evaluate the predictive value of LMR bladder 
cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: To develop and validate a predictive model for cancer-related 
fatigue (CRF) in patients with esophageal cancer.
METHODS: A convenience sample comprising patients diagnosed with esophageal 
cancer and admitted to the Department of Thoracic Surgery at a tertiary hospital 
in Henan Province, China, between June 2024 and May 2025, was enrolled. Data 
were collected using a general information questionnaire, the Chinese version of 
the revised Piper Fatigue Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Nutrition Risk Screening 2002, and a visual 
analogue scale. Then, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses 
were conducted to identify risk factors and construct the predictive model. 
Lastly, a nomogram was developed, and its performance was evaluated through 
internal and external validation.
RESULTS: The incidence of CRF among patients with esophageal cancer was 70.67%. 
Multivariate logistic regression identified preoperative hemoglobin 
concentration, postoperative day-1 serum potassium level, neutrophil ratio, 
nutritional impairment, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance as 
independent risk factors (all p < 0.05). The model demonstrated satisfactory 
discriminatory power, with a sensitivity of 90.60% and specificity of 
93.44%.Additionally, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated favorable calibration 
(χ² = 7.048; p = 0.531). In the validation cohort, the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve was 0.887 (95% CI 0.802-0.944), with an optimal 
cut-off value of 0.797, yielding a sensitivity of 82.54% and specificity of 
81.48%. Finally, calibration plots revealed excelling agreement between 
predicted and observed outcomes, and decision curve analysis suggested favorable 
clinical utility.
CONCLUSION: The proposed model reliably predicts the risk of cancer-related 
fatigue in patients with esophageal cancer and may assist in the early 
identification of high-risk individuals, thereby enabling timely and targeted 
interventions.

INTRODUCTION: Cancer survivors are often insufficiently physically active, have 
overweight or obesity, and suboptimal cardiorespiratory fitness. The Small Steps 
study evaluated a multimodal intervention to address these modifiable risk 
factors.
METHODS: The study randomized 33 cancer survivors to a 10-week multimodal 
lifestyle intervention (MLI) of exercise training and nutritional counseling or 
waitlist control (WLC). The co-primary endpoints included body weight and 
cardiorespiratory fitness capacity; secondary and exploratory endpoints included 
cardiometabolic and patient-reported measures. Endpoints were analyzed using 
analysis of covariance.
RESULTS: Participants had a mean (SD) age of 60.3 (14.0) years, 26 (79%) were 
White, and 18 (55%) were survivors of breast cancer. At baseline, the mean body 
weight was 94.9 (18.3) kg, and the submaximal cardiopulmonary fitness was 16.4 
(5.0) mL/kg/min. As compared with WLC, MLI reduced body weight [-2.3 kg (95% CI: 
-3.6, -0.9); P = 0.0013; -2.8% (95% CI: -4.3, -1.3)] and increased 
cardiopulmonary fitness [2.0 mL/kg/min (95% CI: 0.3, 3.8); P = 0.022]. MLI 
reduced waist circumference [-2.9 cm (95% CI: -5.5, -0.3); P = 0.029], fat mass 
[-1.7 kg (95% CI: -2.9, -0.5); P = 0.005], visceral adipose tissue [-168.0 cm3 
(95% CI: -380.4, -27.7); P = 0.019], and improved self-reported vitality [12.2 
points (95% CI: 1.6, 22.8); P = 0.024] and social functioning [14.2 points (95% 
CI: 1.1, 27.4); P = 0.034]. MLI did not reduce lean mass [-0.2 kg (95% CI: -0.8, 
0.4); P = 0.52] or bone mineral density [0.004 g/cm3 (95% CI: -0.012, 0.020); P 
= 0.63]. There were no serious adverse events.
DISCUSSION: The Small Steps program reduced body weight and improved 
cardiopulmonary fitness in survivors of various types of cancer. This program 
may contribute to improved health span after cancer.

radiotherapy.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Moderate hypofractionated radiotherapy (MHRT) is an 
important treatment modality for lung cancer, offering shorter courses and 
improved local control, yet it also markedly increases the risk of severe 
radiation-induced esophagitis (RIE; grade ≥3). Severe RIE compromises quality of 
life and adherence to therapy and may necessitate interruption of radiotherapy. 
This study aimed to develop a prediction model based on clinical and dosimetric 
factors to identify high-risk patients receiving MHRT and to facilitate 
individualized treatment strategies.
METHODS: Lung cancer patients receiving moderate hypofractionated radiotherapy 
were included, with the endpoint defined as grade ≥3 radiation-induced 
esophagitis. Baseline characteristics were summarized using non-missing data 
only. During model development, in each outer bootstrap training set, candidate 
variables underwent single-rule imputation (median for continuous variables, 
mode for categorical variables) and standardization, followed by variable 
selection via elastic-net regression and model building with Firth-penalized 
logistic regression; the outcome itself was not imputed. Fully nested bootstrap 
validation (B=1000) was performed to assess internal robustness, with 
optimism-corrected performance metrics and 95% confidence intervals reported. 
Discrimination was evaluated using ROC curves and AUC, calibration by 
calibration plots and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and clinical utility through 
decision curve analysis (DCA). The optimal threshold was determined by the 
Youden index, with the corresponding confusion matrix presented. Finally, a 
nomogram was constructed to facilitate clinical visualization and application.
RESULTS: A total of 105 patients were included; the incidence of grade ≥3 RIE 
was 16.2% (17/105). Five predictors entered the final model via elastic-net 
selection: mean gross tumor volume (mean GTV), V5, D2cc, circumferential 2.6-Gy 
irradiated length, and circumferential 3.0-Gy irradiated length. The 
Firth-penalized logistic model showed good apparent performance: AUC=0.771, 
Brier score = 0.114, calibration slope = 1.16, and calibration intercept = 0.13. 
After optimism correction by fully nested bootstrap (B=1,000), discrimination 
decreased to AUC=0.608 (95% CI, 0.464-0.761) with a corresponding Brier score of 
0.176 (95% CI, 0.114-0.247). The Hosmer-Lemeshow test yielded χ² = 7.84, p = 
0.449, indicating acceptable overall fit. The Youden-index-derived optimal 
cutoff was 0.130, stratifying patients into high-risk (predicted probability ≥ 
0.13) and lower-risk (< 0.13) groups. DCA demonstrated positive net benefit over 
""treat-all"" and ""treat-none"" strategies across threshold probabilities of 0-0.8. 
Optimism-corrected calibration parameters were unstable, likely reflecting the 
limited number of events; these results should be interpreted with caution.
CONCLUSION: Using elastic-net feature selection and Firth logistic regression, 
we developed a model to predict severe (grade ≥3) RIE in lung cancer patients 
undergoing MHRT. The model exhibited moderate discriminatory ability with 
generally acceptable calibration, enables risk stratification and identification 
of high-risk patients, and is presented as a nomogram to support clinical 
application. It holds promise for guiding individualized radiotherapy decisions 
and the prevention of treatment-related complications.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe how the use of diagnostic 
imaging for prostate cancer (PCa) has evolved over time and to determine whether 
there are any differences in access to diagnostic imaging, type of cancers 
detected, and mortality based on the education level of patients.
METHODS: 11,063 men were recruited between 1991 and 1996 and then prospectively 
followed until 2020. All new cases of PCa were recorded. At baseline, data on 
education level, heredity for cancer, and health status were collected. Incident 
PCa diagnoses during the study period were ascertained through record matching 
with national healthcare registers. The registers provided more detailed data on 
the cancer type and imaging performed.
RESULTS: 1,816 men with diagnosed were PCa during the study period were 
included. No differences were seen between education levels in regard to access 
to diagnostic methods or tumour aggressiveness at diagnosis. Furthermore, no 
differences were seen in PCa-specific mortality, but there was higher overall 
mortality among individuals with a lower education level. During the study 
period, the use of plain radiographic examinations decreased, while the use of 
computed tomography (CT), prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 
positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) increased.
CONCLUSION: Early detection and diagnostic methods for PCa have evolved over the 
last 30 years. In a healthcare system where men diagnosed with PCa had equal 
access to diagnostic pathways, no differences are seen in PCa specific 
mortality. Nevertheless, men with lower education level still had higher overall 
mortality.

Apelin is widely expressed in the body. Apelin is secreted as a propeptide and 
is proteolytically cleaved into six main isoforms. As an adipokine, apelin has a 
cardio- and neuroprotective role and is involved in angiogenesis in healthy 
tissue. Recently, numerous roles of endothelial cell-derived apelin on cancer 
cells have been uncovered, including angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and 
cellular invasion. Studies have reported elevated apelin levels in tumor tissue 
of patients with cancer compared to healthy controls, highlighting its role in 
determining prognosis. Research suggests that inhibiting apelin reduces tumor 
invasiveness and angiogenesis and further mechanistic studies are required to 
realize the full potential of therapeutics targeting apelin in malignancy.

INTRODUCTION: Machine learning (ML) has shown significant potential in improving 
prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. Despite 
rapid advancements, a comprehensive quantitative synthesis of global research 
trends and the knowledge structure of ML applications in PCa remains lacking. 
This study aimed to systematically map the evolution, research hotspots, and 
collaborative landscape of ML-PCa research.
METHODS: A systematic bibliometric review was performed on English-language 
articles and reviews published between January 2005 and December 2024. 
Publications were retrieved from the Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus databases. 
Analytical tools including CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and the R-bibliometrix package 
were employed to assess publication growth trends, country and institutional 
contributions, collaboration networks, author productivity, journal outlets, and 
keyword co-occurrence patterns.
RESULTS: A total of 2,632 publications were identified. Annual output increased 
from fewer than 20 papers during 2005-2014 to 661 in 2024, with 82% of all 
studies published since 2021. Emerging frontiers included deep learning, 
radiomics, and multimodal data fusion. China (649 publications) and the United 
States (492 publications) led in research volume, while Germany demonstrated the 
highest proportion of multinational collaboration (39.29%). Leading institutions 
by output were the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the University of British 
Columbia, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. In terms of citation impact, the 
University of Toronto, Case Western Reserve University, and the University of 
Pennsylvania ranked highest. The journals Cancers, Frontiers in Oncology, and 
Scientific Reports published the most ML-PCa studies, highlighting the 
cross-disciplinary nature of the field. Madabhushi Anant emerged as the most 
central author hub in global collaboration networks.
DISCUSSION: ML applications in PCa research have experienced exponential growth, 
with methodological innovations driving interest in deep learning and radiomics. 
However, a persistent translational gap exists between algorithmic development 
and clinical implementation. Future directions should focus on fostering 
interdisciplinary collaboration, conducting prospective multicenter validation 
studies, and aligning with regulatory standards to accelerate the integration of 
ML models into clinical PCa workflows.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is an independent risk factor for endometrial cancer (EC). 
Bibliometrics allows for the analysis of multiple data from published 
publications to identify the current state of research and future trends and to 
construct a knowledge framework. There is a lack of high-quality bibliometric 
analyses of obesity and EC.
METHODS: This study retrieved publications related to obesity and EC from the 
Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) from 2003 to 2024. Publication trends 
were analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2019, while CiteSpace (v.6.4.R1 Advanced) 
was employed to analyze institutional co-occurrence, cited journals, journal 
co-citation mapping, co-cited references, and keywords. VOSviewer (v.1.6.20) was 
used to analyze the journals in which the publications appeared. SCImago 
Graphica (v.1.0.39) was utilized to investigate the distribution and 
collaboration of countries/regions, institutional collaborations, and author 
collaborations.
RESULTS: 681 publications from 2003 to 2024 were included in the final analysis. 
The volume of publications showed an upward trend, peaking in 2021. The United 
States was the country with the highest number of publications, with the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) being the leading institution. Scholars Emma J. 
Crosbie and Faina Linkov had the highest publication counts, while CALLE EE was 
the most cited scholar. The journal Gynecologic Oncology (Q1/4.5) published the 
most relevant articles and was also the most frequently cited journal. The most 
common keywords were ""endometrial cancer,"" ""body mass index,"" and ""risk."" 
Current research focuses on exploring the mechanisms linking obesity and EC and 
analyzing the impact of obesity on clinical treatment strategies for EC. Future 
research directions include: (1) expanding the scope to related diseases of EC; 
(2) emphasizing typical indicators and diagnostic techniques for EC; (3) 
developing new treatment methods and technologies to enhance clinical efficacy; 
and (4) further strengthening the exploration of the pathological mechanisms 
related to obesity and EC.
CONCLUSION: This study comprehensively summarizes the knowledge structure of 
obesity and EC and identifies key research hotspots and trends. Based on our 
findings, the formation of a multidisciplinary team, the rational application of 
diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, the further enhancement of the 
exploration of the pathological mechanisms associated with obesity and EC as 
well as the improvement of clinical diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are 
powerful measures to promote the development of this field.

PURPOSE: We compared the impact of tamoxifen alone or with ovarian function 
suppression (OFS) on bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal patients after 
chemotherapy.
METHODS: Of 1483 premenopausal women enrolled in the ASTRRA study, we included 
522 who underwent BMD examinations at diagnosis and 3 and 5 years after 
diagnosis. All BMD measurements were performed using the same scanner in each 
center across different time points. Patients were stratified into three groups: 
within the expected range for age (A, Z-score>-1.0), below the expected range 
(B,-2.0≤ Z-score ≤-1.0), and low bone mineral density for chronological age (C, 
Z-score< -2.0) groups. We examined changes in groups from baseline to >3-year 
and 5-year periods to identify any deterioration in BMD. We conducted a subset 
analysis using the Asan Medical Center (AMC; n=141) data, focusing on the 
absolute value of bone density (in g/cm2 unit).
RESULTS: The 522 included patients (median age, 41.1 years) had a higher bone 
loss incidence in the OFS addition group at baseline (p=0.028). The 
tamoxifen-only and tamoxifen+OFS groups did not differ significantly in terms of 
changes in BMD categories from baseline to 3 (p=0.567) or 5 years (p=0.600). The 
OFS addition group had a significantly increased risk of BMD deterioration when 
randomized at the first visit (odds ratio=2.970, p=0.008). Within the AMC 
subset, the OFS addition group exhibited significantly decreased BMD in the 
spine (p=0.023) and femur (p=0.040) from the baseline to 3-year period. A 
non-significantly decreased BMD occurred from the baseline to 5 years in the 
spine and femur.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlighted the deleterious impact on BMD following OFS 
addition, compared with tamoxifen only treatment. Early OFS exerted an even more 
detrimental influence on bone health in premenopausal patients with estrogen 
receptor-positive breast cancer and recovered ovarian function.

Patients with brain metastases from lung cancer exhibit rapid disease 
progression and a poor prognosis, underscoring an urgent need for effective 
therapeutic strategies. Drug sensitivity testing using patient-derived organoids 
(PDOs) has emerged as a promising tool for guiding clinical treatment decisions. 
Here, we report two cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain 
metastases where treatment guided by PDO-based drug sensitivity screening aided 
in disease control. Case 1 involved a patient with an EGFR exon 19 deletion. The 
corresponding PDO model demonstrated sensitivity to a combination of pemetrexed, 
carboplatin, and osimertinib, but insensitivity to osimertinib monotherapy. 
Following this guidance, the patient achieved a partial response (PR) to the 
triplet regimen and was subsequently de-escalated to maintenance therapy. The 
patient's disease remained stable at the time of this report. Case 2 involved a 
patient with a complex EML4-ALK fusion variant 3 (E6:A20) and a novel NRXN1-ALK 
fusion (N19:A20). The patient had progressed on multiple lines of therapy, 
including alectinib and lorlatinib. The PDO model showed sensitivity to 
brigatinib but insensitivity to ensartinib. Subsequent treatment with brigatinib 
induced a PR that was sustained for 5.8 months; the patient survived for a total 
of 9 months following the initiation of this PDO-guided therapy. These two cases 
suggests that PDOs derived from primary and metastatic lesions may help optimize 
treatment regimens for patients with lung cancer brain metastases, thereby 
enabling personalized therapy and potentially improving survival outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with 
one of the highest incidence rates reported in Chile. Despite its clinical 
impact, molecular characterization of GBC in Latin American populations remains 
limited, and the absence of effective targeted therapies underscores the urgent 
need for new therapeutic strategies.
METHODS: We collected 118 tumor samples, of which 56 passed sequencing quality 
control using the Oncomine™ Comprehensive Assay v1. Somatic variants were 
identified with ANNOVAR and Cancer Genome Interpreter, and ancestry was inferred 
using ADMIXTURE and PCA with ancestry-informative markers. Comparative analyses 
were performed with Japanese, Singaporean, and U.S. cohorts.
RESULTS: A total of 535 somatic mutations were detected in 43 genes, with TP53 
(30%), TSC2 (29%), and NOTCH1 (27%) being the most frequently mutated. We 
identified 121 clinically actionable variants in ATM, BRCA1/2, EGFR, ERBB2, and 
other genes. Exploratory analysis suggested an association between higher 
Mapuche ancestry and TP53 mutations. Comparative analyses revealed distinct 
mutational patterns in the Chilean cohort relative to Asian and U.S. datasets.
CONCLUSION: This ancestry-informed genomic analysis provides the first 
comprehensive landscape of Chilean GBC, identifying actionable alterations with 
potential therapeutic relevance and supporting the development of 
population-specific precision oncology strategies.

Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) jets are ionized gases with a rich combination of 
reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, charged particles, and photons. It has 
been demonstrated the CAP is capable of eliminating cancer cells without 
damaging normal cells both in vitro and in vivo. However, obtaining a safe and 
reliable CAP treatment is challenging since the therapeutic effectiveness of the 
CAP treatment is affected not only by the CAP-generating parameters, such as 
discharge voltage and excited gas composition, but also by the surrounding 
environmental conditions, such as ambient temperature and humidity. Furthermore, 
even under the same treatment conditions, cancer cells may respond differently 
due to their stochastic nature. To address these challenges, this paper presents 
an adaptive CAP cancer treatment framework with real-time electrochemical 
impedance spectroscopy in situ diagnostics. Particularly, the EIS-based in situ 
diagnostics is studied with the canonical correlation analysis, where the 
correlation between impedance measurements and CAP treatment effectiveness, 
i.e., cell viability, is investigated. With an established correlation, 
real-time cell viability can be predicted with given impedance measurements. The 
capability of the proposed in situ diagnostics and adaptive plasma cancer 
treatment framework is evaluated with in vitro experiments under both nominal 
and perturbed treatment conditions.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most fatal subtype of breast cancer 
owing to its aggressive nature and limited treatment strategies. Despite 
significant advancements in cancer research, targeted therapeutic interventions 
to mitigate TNBC remain limited. Paclitaxel is heavily relied on as a frontline 
chemotherapy drug for managing breast cancer, but its treatment is often 
associated with emerging resistance and the onset of severe adverse effects. In 
the quest to identify an appropriate combination therapy with a low dose of 
paclitaxel, we explored crocetin using a highly aggressive mouse carcinoma model 
of breast cancer. The findings demonstrate that crocetin enhanced the 
therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel by reducing the tumor burden and limiting the 
metastatic lung nodule count. Crocetin, in combination with paclitaxel, markedly 
altered the expression of key epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers 
and substantially upregulated the pro-apoptotic markers. Concurrent treatment of 
crocetin and paclitaxel suppressed CYP2J2 expression and decreased 
epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) levels in the tumor tissue. Dysregulated proteins 
from untargeted proteomics data indicate that crocetin boosted the 
antimetastatic efficacy of paclitaxel, possibly via modulating extracellular 
matrix organization. In combination with paclitaxel, crocetin exerted preventive 
effects by normalizing the cancer-linked WBC count. Devoid of any observed 
pharmacokinetic effect of crocetin on paclitaxel, overall results dictate that 
crocetin has significant potential to boost the efficacy of paclitaxel with a 
possibly crucial contribution from the CYP2J2/EET axis, leading to restricting 
tumorigenesis. Thus, elucidating the putative molecular signaling pathway is 
suggested for this promising combination therapy under the frame of targeted 
therapeutics to combat TNBC.

WD Repeat-containing protein 5 (WDR5) is a critical companion for the mixed 
lineage leukemia (MLL) complex, essential for epigenetic regulation and 
implicated in various cancers, particularly leukemia. Overexpression of WDR5 in 
malignant tissues is linked to poor clinical outcomes and enhanced cancer cell 
proliferation. Its interaction with the MLL1 protein occurs via the WDR5 
protein, which is vital for the MLL complex's methyltransferase activity. Recent 
studies highlight the WIN site as a promising therapeutic target, especially for 
MLL-rearranged leukemia. In this study, we investigated the structural dynamics 
of the WDR5-MLL1 complex and aimed to identify potential small-molecule 
inhibitors targeting the WIN site, to develop novel therapeutic strategies for 
leukemia and other WDR5 protein-dysregulated cancers. Utilizing the crystal 
structures of the WDR5 and MLL1, we screened around one million synthetically 
available compounds from ChemDiv, Enamine, and Specs small molecule libraries. 
The computational analysis was conducted through comprehensive all-atom 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to evaluate ligand-receptor interaction 
affinities and involved binding residues. The simulations revealed key 
participating amino acid residues while quantifying binding affinities using the 
Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) approach. Steered 
molecular dynamics (sMD) simulations were further conducted to assess the 
stability of ligand-receptor interactions of the selected top-compounds. 
Additionally, novel potential compounds were generated using BRICS fragmentation 
and Monte Carlo tree search algorithms. Our analysis revealed diverse 
interaction patterns and potential inhibitory mechanism among the screened 
compounds. Several compounds, such as Z88418521 and Z116334910, displayed 
stronger predicted binding affinities than the reference molecule IA9, 
exhibiting competitive and allosteric modulation of the WDR5-MLL1 complex 
interaction. A thorough analysis of WDR5 protein and WDR5-MLL1 interactions and 
their conformational changes offered valuable perspectives on targeting the 
WDR5-MLL1 complex interaction. Thus, this study profiles the molecular 
alterations that occur during WDR5-MLL1 complex inhibition, offering crucial 
mechanistic insights that establish a solid framework for developing targeted 
treatments for MLL-rearranged leukemia. The distinctive binding characteristics 
and conformational dynamics exhibited by the identified compounds provide a 
compelling foundation for future experimental approaches to leukemia 
intervention.

DNA tetrahedra (DTN) could enhance the circulation and targeting capabilities of 
aptamers. This study constructs a gallium-68 (68Ga) radiolabeled DTN-SYL3C 
aptamer conjugate to evaluate their imaging potential for detecting epithelial 
cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-positive colorectal cancer (CRC). 
[68Ga]-Ga-DTN-SYL3C was prepared by hybridizing T20-DTN-SYL3C with 
[68Ga]-Ga-NOTA-ssDNA (A20) through base complementary pairing. Dynamic PET 
imaging was conducted in EpCAM-positive HT-29 tumor-bearing BALB/c nude mice 
using [68Ga]-Ga-DTN and [68Ga]-Ga-SYL3C as controls. T20-DTN-SYL3C was 
synthesized and characterized by agarose gel electrophoresis, while 
[68Ga]-Ga-DTN-SYL3C was verified by high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC). The radiolabeling yield of [68Ga]-Ga-DTN-SYL3C was approximately 90%. 
Biodistribution studies indicated metabolism by the kidneys and liver. The blood 
half-life of [68Ga]-Ga-DTN-SYL3C was 11.39 ± 2.66 min, longer than that of 
[68Ga]-Ga-SYL3C (7.26 ± 0.17 min) in pharmacokinetic studies. Dynamic PET 
results showed tumor uptake of 0.89 ± 0.30%ID/g for [68Ga]-Ga-DTN-SYL3C, 0.27 ± 
0.22%ID/g for [68Ga]-Ga-DTN, and 0.32 ± 0.16%ID/g for [68Ga]-Ga-SYL3C at 1 h (n 
= 3). In conclusion, the [68Ga]-Ga-labeled DTN-SYL3C aptamer conjugate 
effectively targets EpCAM-positive CRC and may serve as a promising imaging tool 
for detection and monitoring.

Because of resistance and the absence of effective targeted therapies, breast 
cancer, particularly the hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and triple-negative 
breast cancer (TNBC) types, presents significant therapeutic problems. One 
promising therapeutic approach is to target the redox vulnerabilities of cancer 
cells. In this work, new epoxy-functionalized phenanthridine-triazole conjugates 
(RM58, RM60, RM61, and RM75) are evaluated as dual redox modulators in models of 
breast cancer. Using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations (100 
ns) against a panel of 14 potential protein targets linked to breast cancer, 
these compounds are shown to have high affinity and stable binding to important 
redox-regulatory proteins, such as glutathione S-transferase and thioredoxin. 
Dose-dependent cytotoxicity was demonstrated in vitro in MCF-7 (HR+) and 
MDA-MB-231 (TNBC) cell lines, with RM75 and RM60 showing the strongest effects. 
According to mechanistic research, these substances cause oxidative stress 
overload by causing a considerable buildup of intracellular reactive oxygen 
species and the depletion of glutathione and thioredoxin. Specifically in the 
TNBC model, this redox imbalance led to robust caspase-3/7-mediated apoptosis, 
loss of membrane potential, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Untargeted LC-MS/MS 
metabolomic profiling revealed clear metabolic reprogramming, with significant 
changes found in the pathways. These findings show that a sequence of metabolic 
alterations and cellular apoptosis is induced by the dual disruption of 
antioxidant defenses. These integrative results suggest that antioxidant 
disruption by epoxy-phenanthridine conjugates leads to metabolic collapse and 
apoptosis, highlighting RM75 as a promising redox-active lead. However, in vivo 
efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety studies are needed to advance this 
scaffold toward clinical evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Distant metastasis causes most colorectal cancer (CRC) deaths. Gut 
microbiota (GM) dysbiosis and altered metabolites drive metastasis progression, 
serving as potential diagnostic biomarkers.
AIM: To investigate alterations in GM and metabolites between patients with 
non-metastatic and distant metastatic CRC.
METHODS: According to the inclusion criteria, fresh fecal samples were collected 
from 14 non-metastatic CRC patients and 15 distant metastatic CRC patients. We 
performed 16S rRNA sequencing to analyze the composition, diversity, and 
differential abundance of GM, along with predictive functional profiling of 
microbial communities. Additionally, all samples underwent liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomic sequencing 
to identify metabolic changes and predict their biological functions.
RESULTS: The cohort comprised 16 non-metastatic CRC patients (designated as the 
S group) and 16 distant metastatic CRC patients (designated as the DZ group). 
Sequence analysis (16S rRNA) identified a total of 35016 operational taxonomic 
units (OTUs) across both groups (16886 OTUs in the S group; 16270 in the DZ 
group; 1860 shared between groups). Inter-group microbial diversity analysis 
revealed notable differences in the β-diversity group (P < 0.05). Comparative 
analysis of GM revealed significant taxonomic composition differences between 
groups (P < 0.05), with higher relative abundances of Butyricicoccus, 
Ruminococcus_1, Coprococcus_2 in the S group, Pyramidobacter, 
Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, and Romboutsia in the DZ group (all P < 0.05). 
Functional analysis of differential microbiota revealed predominant enrichment 
in metabolic pathways. LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics detected 91 
differential metabolites in both positive and negative ionization modes. 
GM-derived metabolites showed significant alterations in the DZ group. Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Human Metabolome Database analyses 
revealed associated pathways involving nucleic acids, organic heterocyclic 
compounds, alkaloids, lipids/lipid-like molecules, and nucleotides. These 
metabolites may function synergistically, as evidenced by positive correlations 
between diazoxide, hydroquinidine, aurapten, and triptophenolide. Differential 
metabolites were primarily involved in aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, central 
carbon metabolism in cancer, phenylalanine metabolism, vitamin B6 metabolism, 
and protein digestion and absorption pathways.
CONCLUSION: GM and microbial metabolites differ significantly between CRC 
patients with distant metastasis and those without metastasis. Metabolites 
involved in nucleic acid, alkaloid, and lipid metabolism pathways potentially 
contribute to distant metastasis in CRC.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibits profound lipid metabolic reprogramming, a 
hallmark of malignant transformation that supports tumorigenesis, immune 
evasion, and therapeutic resistance. Dysregulated lipid metabolism in CRC 
involves altered fatty acid synthesis, uptake, oxidation, and cholesterol 
metabolism, which collectively drive cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, and 
interactions with the tumor microenvironment (TME). This review synthesizes 
current insights into lipid metabolic rewiring in CRC, its role in shaping 
immunosuppressive TME dynamics, and emerging therapeutic strategies targeting 
lipid pathways.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant tumor characterized by high 
global incidence and mortality rates. Contemporary therapeutic modalities remain 
limited by suboptimal efficacy and adverse effects, thereby necessitating the 
pursuit of more efficacious treatment strategies. Within traditional Chinese 
medicine, spleen deficiency is regarded as a central pathogenic mechanism in 
CRC, persisting throughout the entire disease course.
AIM: To elucidate the mechanism by which modified Yigong San confers therapeutic 
efficacy against CRC, potentially exerting its effects through apoptosis 
regulation mediated by the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 
(EZH2)/methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)/SRY-box transcription factor 4 (SOX4) 
axis.
METHODS: In the clinical study, CRC tissues and corresponding adjacent normal 
samples that fulfilled inclusion criteria were procured. Quantitative reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction was employed to determine the 
transcriptional expression of EZH2 and METTL3 mRNA. For in vitro 
experimentation, SW-480 cells were allocated into five experimental conditions: 
Control, control + serum, control + negative control, control + 
overexpressing-EZH2, and control + overexpressing-EZH2 + serum. The mRNA 
expression levels of EZH2, METTL3, SOX4, B-cell lymphoma 2, and Bax across 
groups were quantified via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction, while protein levels were assessed using western blot analysis. The 
presence of EZH2 binding sites within the METTL3 promoter region was verified 
through chromatin immunoprecipitation polymerase chain reaction. The optimal 
concentration of drug-containing serum (5%, 10%, 15%) was determined using the 
Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Cell migratory ability was evaluated via scratch 
assays, and apoptotic activity was quantified by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: The clinical findings demonstrated significantly elevated 
transcriptional levels of METTL3 and EZH2 mRNA in tumor tissues compared to 
their adjacent normal counterparts (P < 0.05). In vitro, cells treated with 
modified Yigong San exhibited a substantial downregulation of EZH2, METTL3, 
SOX4, B-cell lymphoma 2, and Bax mRNA and protein levels (P < 0.05), relative to 
the control group. Apoptotic rates were markedly increased, while migratory 
capacity was significantly attenuated. Furthermore, in EZH2-overexpressing cells 
treated with modified Yigong San, similar reductions in both mRNA and protein 
levels of the aforementioned targets were observed (P < 0.05), concomitant with 
enhanced apoptosis and reduced migration. Chromatin immunoprecipitation 
polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed EZH2 occupancy at specific loci 
within the METTL3 promoter.
CONCLUSION: Modified Yigong San exhibits both preventive and therapeutic 
potential against CRC, likely mediated through the regulation of apoptosis via 
the EZH2/METTL3/SOX4 signaling pathway.

BACKGROUND: Predicting the pathological response of esophageal cancer (EC) to 
neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is of significant clinical importance.
AIM: To evaluate the pathological response of NAT in EC patients using multiple 
machine learning algorithms based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 132 patients with pathologically 
confirmed EC, were randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 92) and a 
validation cohort (n = 40) in a 7:3 ratio. All patients underwent a preoperative 
MRI scan from the neck to the abdomen. High-throughput and quantitative 
radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging (T2WI). Radiomics 
signatures were selected using minimal redundancy maximal relevance and the 
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Nine classification algorithms 
were used to build the models, and the diagnostic performance of each model was 
evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity (SEN), and 
specificity (SPE).
RESULTS: A total of 1834 features were extracted. Following feature dimension 
reduction, ten radiomics features were selected to construct radiomics 
signatures. Among the nine classification algorithms, the ExtraTrees algorithm 
demonstrated the best diagnostic performance in both the training (AUC: 0.932; 
SEN: 0.906; SPE: 0.817) and validation cohorts (AUC: 0.900; SEN: 0.667; SPE: 
0.700). The Delong test proved no significance in the diagnostic efficiency 
within these models (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: T2WI radiomics may aid in determining the pathological response to 
NAT in EC patients, serving as a noninvasive and quantitative tool to assist 
personalized treatment planning.

BACKGROUND: Delayed wound healing is a common clinical complication following 
gastric cancer radical surgery, adversely affecting patient prognosis. With 
advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning offers a promising 
approach for developing predictive models that can identify high-risk patients 
and support early clinical intervention.
AIM: To construct machine learning-based risk prediction models for delayed 
wound healing after gastric cancer surgery to support clinical decision-making.
METHODS: We reviewed a total of 514 patients who underwent gastric cancer 
radical surgery under general anesthesia from January 1, 2014 to December 30, 
2023. Seventy percent of the dataset was selected as the training set and 30% as 
the validation set. Decision trees, support vector machines, and logistic 
regression were used to construct a risk prediction model. The performance of 
the model was evaluated using accuracy, recall, precision, F1 index, and area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve and decision curve.
RESULTS: This study included five variables: Sex, elderly, duration of abdominal 
drainage, preoperative white blood cell (WBC) count, and absolute value of 
neutrophils. These variables were selected based on their clinical relevance and 
statistical significance in predicting delayed wound healing. The results showed 
that the decision tree model outperformed the logistic regression and support 
vector machine models in both the training and validation sets. Specifically, 
the decision tree model achieved higher accuracy, F1 index, recall, and area 
under the curve (AUC) values. The support vector machine model also demonstrated 
better performance than logistic regression, with higher accuracy, recall, and 
F1 index, but a slightly lower AUC. The key variables of sex, elderly, duration 
of abdominal drainage, preoperative WBC count, and absolute value of neutrophils 
were found to be strong predictors of delayed wound healing. Patients with 
longer duration of abdominal drainage had a significantly higher risk of delayed 
wound healing, with a risk ratio of 1.579 compared to those with shorter 
duration of abdominal drainage. Similarly, preoperative WBC count, sex, elderly, 
and absolute value of neutrophils were associated with a higher risk of delayed 
wound healing, highlighting the importance of these variables in the model.
CONCLUSION: The model is able to identify high-risk patients based on sex, 
elderly, duration of abdominal drainage, preoperative WBC count, and absolute 
value of neutrophils can provide valuable insights for clinical decision-making.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers and CRC 
patients are among the most common intensive care unit (ICU) admitted cancer 
patients. However, their prognosis and evaluation methods are rarely studied.
AIM: To determine the short-term mortality outcome and identify the potential 
prognostic factors of CRC cancer patients admitted to the ICU.
METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional study was performed from May 10, 2021 to 
July 10, 2021 at the ICU departments of 37 cancer specialized hospitals in 
China, and included patients aged ≥ 14 years with ICU duration ≥ 24 hours. 
Clinical records of patients with a primary CRC diagnosis were reviewed. 
Patients were separated into groups according to 90-day survival. 
Characteristics between groups were compared. Univariate and multivariate 
regression tests were used to analyze the correlated factors of ICU outcomes. 
Predictive values of disease severity scores were assessed using receiver 
operating characteristic curve analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 189 CRC patients were included in the study. The 90-day 
mortality was 12.2%. Patients who died showed differences compared to patients 
who survived mostly in terms of disease severity and ICU complications. It 
appears that patients admitted to the ICU from a clinical ward due to 
emergencies may have a higher risk of mortality while surgical management was 
associated with better survival. In multivariate analysis, only chemotherapy, 
elective surgery and conventional oxygen therapy were identified as 
independently correlated with 90-day mortality. Sequential organ failure 
assessment and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II scores had 
moderate accuracy in predicting short-term mortality.
CONCLUSION: ICU admitted CRC patients appear to have low short-term mortality 
which requires further confirmation in prospective studies. The prognostic tools 
for these patients need further optimization.

BACKGROUND: The gastric microbiome is closely associated with gastric cancer, 
and single-region 16S rRNA sequencing has limitations in analyzing its 
characteristics, necessitating the search for a better sequencing method.
AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of multi-region 16S rRNA gene sequencing in 
studying the microbiome of gastric cancer tissues.
METHODS: Patients with gastric cancer (n = 118) who underwent surgery at Liyang 
People's Hospital from January 2022 to December 2024 were enrolled. Fifty-nine 
paraffin-embedded and 59 fresh tissue samples were obtained. The ZymoBIOMICSTM 
microbial community standard and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 were used as 
positive controls. Multi-region and single-region 16S rRNA gene sequencing were 
performed. Species identification, detection rates at varying microbial 
abundances, operational taxonomic unit (OTU) counts, and alpha diversity indices 
in gastric cancer tissues were compared between the two methods.
RESULTS: Multi-region 16S rRNA sequencing identified more species (eight species 
and eight genera) in the positive controls compared with single-region 
sequencing (one species and six genera). Detection rates at concentrations of 
103, 102, and 10 CFU/mg were significantly higher using multi-region sequencing 
(P < 0.05). Multi-region sequencing also revealed significantly higher OTU 
counts and alpha diversity indices (Shannon, Simpson, and Chao1) in gastric 
cancer tissues (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Compared with single-region sequencing, multi-region 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing demonstrates superior species resolution and detection sensitivity, 
providing a more comprehensive profile of microbial diversity in gastric cancer 
tissues.

Treatment of locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer remains a major 
clinical challenge due to pronounced heterogeneity and resistance to standard 
regimens. Increasing evidence highlights the critical role of the tumor 
microenvironment (TME) in shaping therapeutic response and driving drug 
resistance. In this minireview, we summarize recent advances in TME phenotyping 
and its potential to guide precision therapy. A four-dimensional framework 
integrating stromal, immune, genomic, and metabolic features has been proposed 
to better characterize TME heterogeneity. Preclinical and clinical studies 
indicate that strategies targeting the stroma, modulating immunity, or 
exploiting genomic vulnerabilities such as homologous recombination deficiency 
may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted agents. 
Dynamic biomarkers, including circulating tumor DNA and carbohydrate antigen 
19-9, also show promise for real-time therapy adaptation, although their 
clinical application remains limited. By synthesizing current evidence, we 
emphasize the importance of individualized treatment strategies that account for 
TME complexity. While encouraging, the translation of multiomics phenotyping and 
biomarker monitoring into routine clinical practice requires standardization, 
prospective validation, and integration of novel technologies. Future research 
should focus on establishing reproducible TME-guided models to enable dynamic 
and personalized therapy for patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.

BACKGROUND: Well-differentiated rectal neuroendocrine tumors (rNETs) represent 
approximately 28% of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors, with a rising 
incidence over recent decades. However, data from Perú remains limited.
AIM: To assess overall survival (OS) in patients with rNETs and describe the 
clinical and pathological characteristics of the study population.
METHODS: This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with rNETs at the 
Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas between 2009 and 2024. 
Qualitative variables were evaluated using the χ 2 test through contingency 
tables. OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences between 
groups were assessed with the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards models 
were used to evaluate variables associated with OS. All statistical analyses 
were conducted using R software.
RESULTS: A total of 52 patients were included, with a mean age of 51.9 years 
(range: 27-74 years) and composed of 65.4% females. The most common stage at 
diagnosis was stage I (48.1%), followed by stage IV (36.5%). The median OS 
within the study population was 76 months. The 5-year OS for grade 1 tumors was 
92.9% compared to 32.6% for grade 2 tumors (P = 0.00032). The median OS was 48 
months for tumors exceeding 20 mm in size, whereas it was not reached for tumors 
measuring 20 mm or less (P = 0.0056). Similarly, the median OS for patients 
classified as lymph node involvement 1 was 46 months, while it was estimated at 
112 months for those classified as lymph node involvement 0 (P = 0.0063).
CONCLUSION: rNETs exceeding 2 cm in size, classified as grade 2, or presenting 
with lymph node involvement 1 status were correlated with advanced disease 
stages and diminished survival outcomes.

BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs play an important role in gastric cancer (GC) development 
following Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Yet the exact mechanism is 
still not fully understood. Herein, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of 
miR-136 during this process.
AIM: To investigate the role of miR-136 in H. pylori-induced GC progression.
METHODS: GC and gastric epithelial cells were infected with H. pylori and 
transfected with miR-136 mimic, inhibitor, mimic plus PDCD11 (identified as 
miR-136 target), or miR-NC (control). Cell proliferation, migration, and 
invasion were assessed via cell counting kit-8 assay, colony formation, wound 
healing, and Transwell assays. Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB)/miR-136/PDCD11 
interactions were confirmed by luciferase and inhibition assays. For in vivo 
studies H. pylori-infected BGC-823 cells were injected into nude mice. Reverse 
transcription PCR, western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescent 
staining assay were used to assess mRNA and protein expression.
RESULTS: miR-136 expression was significantly upregulated while PDCD11 
expression was significantly downregulated in early GC tissues and GC cells 
infected with H. pylori compared with non-infected tissues or cells (all P < 
0.01). miR-136 overexpression induced by H. pylori could promote the 
proliferation and migration of infected GC cells and induce the growth of H. 
pylori-positive GC tumors in mice while its inhibition could reverse this 
effect. Mechanistically, upregulation of miR-136 suppressed PDCD11 through NF-κB 
activation induced by H. pylori infection.
CONCLUSION: miR-136 is a novel diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target in H. 
pylori-associated early-stage gastric carcinogenesis and acts through the 
NF-κB-miR-136-PDCD11 pathway.

The initiation and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) are profoundly 
influenced by the complex interplay between the gut microbiota and the immune 
system, underscoring the clinical importance of exploring the bidirectional 
regulatory mechanisms of the microbiota-immune axis within the CRC immune 
microenvironment. Emerging evidence indicates that the composition and 
functional capacity of the gut microbiota play a vital role in modulating the 
host's immune responses, while the immune system, in turn, can reciprocally 
regulate the structure and function of the microbiota. Despite significant 
insights into the role of the microbiota-immune axis in CRC progression, several 
critical questions remain unanswered-including how microbial heterogeneity 
affects therapeutic outcomes and the specific consequences of dysregulated 
regulatory mechanisms on the immune microenvironment. This review aims to 
provide a comprehensive analysis of the compositional features of the CRC immune 
microenvironment, examine the bidirectional molecular mechanisms underpinning 
the microbiota-immune axis, and evaluate the potential of targeted therapeutic 
strategies, thereby offering novel research perspectives and clinical 
applications for CRC treatment.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with an increased risk of developing 
colitis-associated colorectal cancer (caCRC), a major complication of 
long-standing disease. In this review, we examined the pathogenic association 
between UC and caCRC, highlighting the risk factors, molecular mechanisms, and 
current strategies for prevention and management. Compared to sporadic 
colorectal cancer, caCRC tends to occur at a younger age and is more frequently 
characterized by mucinous or signet-ring cell histology, proximal colonic 
involvement, and a higher incidence of synchronous lesions. The risk of caCRC 
increases 8-10 years after UC diagnosis and is influenced by disease duration, 
extent of colonic involvement, inflammatory burden, family history of colorectal 
cancer, and coexisting primary sclerosing cholangitis. The 
inflammation-to-cancer progression follows a multistep pathway of genetic 
alterations, advancing from low-grade to high-grade dysplasia, and ultimately to 
carcinoma. While chemopreventive agents such as 5-aminosalicylates may offer 
some benefit, surveillance colonoscopy remains the primary strategy for risk 
reduction. Early detection and individualized prevention strategies are critical 
for improving long-term outcomes in patients with UC.

Esophageal cancer is a highly aggressive malignancy often diagnosed at an 
advanced stage, with poor prognosis and high recurrence rates despite curative 
treatment. Accurate prognostic tools are urgently needed to guide personalized 
management strategies. Recent research has demonstrated significant potential of 
integrating quantitative imaging biomarkers, specifically radiomics and 
sarcopenia, with machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance outcome prediction. 
This review systematically summarizes six recent studies (2022-2024) exploring 
integrated ML models combining sarcopenia and radiomics biomarkers with clinical 
parameters to predict survival in patients with esophageal and gastroesophageal 
cancers. Sample sizes ranged from 83 to 243 patients, with studies utilizing 
various imaging modalities (positron emission tomography/computed tomography and 
computed tomography) and model analysis approaches, including Cox regression, 
random forest, and light gradient boosting machine. These models incorporated 
features such as skeletal muscle indices, tumor texture, and shape descriptors. 
Models that combined clinical data, radiomics, and sarcopenia outperformed those 
using single modalities. These findings support the utility of multimodal 
imaging biomarkers in developing robust, individualized prognostic models. 
However, the retrospective nature of most studies highlights the need for 
standardization and external validation. This review underscores the potential 
of multimodal ML-based models in enhancing personalized risk stratification and 
treatment planning for esophageal cancer.

As a common malignant tumor, the heterogeneity of colorectal cancer plays an 
important role in tumor progression and treatment response. In recent years, the 
rapid development of single-cell transcriptomics and spatial transcriptomics 
technologies has provided new perspectives for resolving the heterogeneity of 
colorectal cancer. These techniques can reveal the complexity of cellular 
composition and their interactions in the tumor microenvironment, and thus 
facilitate a deeper understanding of tumor biology. However, in practical 
applications, researchers still face technical challenges such as data 
processing and result interpretation. The aim of this paper is to explore how to 
use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to enhance the research efficiency 
of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, analyze the current research 
progress and its limitations, and explore how combining AI approaches can 
provide new ideas for decoding the heterogeneity of colorectal cancer, and 
ultimately provide theoretical basis and practical guidance for the clinical 
precision treatment.

BACKGROUND: Implementing nursing interventions in patients undergoing endoscopic 
treatment for intestinal polyps and early stage cancer can serve as a reference 
for reducing the incidence of complications, accelerating the recovery process, 
and improving the quality of life.
AIM: To impact of systematic nursing intervention on recovery, complications 
prevention, and quality of life after endoscopic surgery for intestinal polyps.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 157 patients who underwent endoscopic 
mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection at our hospital. The 
patients were divided into intervention and conventional groups, with no 
significant differences in age, sex, or surgical methods. The intervention group 
received multidimensional nursing interventions, including preoperative 
evaluation, intraoperative cooperation, postoperative rehabilitation, 
psychological support and nutritional management. The conventional group 
received standardized care. Clinical efficacy, inflammation and infection 
indicators, complication rates, rehabilitation indicators, and visual analog 
scale (VAS) scores were compared.
RESULTS: On the 7th day after surgery, C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood 
cell levels were lower in the intervention group than in the conventional group. 
Complications occurred in 9.33% of the patients in the intervention group and 
23.17% in the conventional group, with significant differences in fever and 
abdominal distension. The intervention group had shorter first exhaust and 
hospitalization durations than the control group. By day 3 post-surgery, the 
intervention group showed lower VAS scores and reduced anxiety and depression. 
High-risk factors included diabetes [relative risk (RR) = 2.43, 95%CI: 
1.21-4.86], laparotomy (RR = 2.86, 95%CI: 1.22-6.71), CRP > 15 mg/L (RR = 3.12, 
95%CI: 1.54-6.33), and procalcitonin > 0.5 ng/mL 1 day after surgery (RR = 2.91. 
95%CI: 1.31-6.44), while systematic nursing interventions (OR = 0.40, 95%CI: 
0.18-0.89) reduced the complication risk by 60%.
CONCLUSION: Multidimensional nursing interventions have clinical value in 
endoscopic treatment of intestinal polyps and early stage cancer, reducing 
complications and hospital stay. This study provides a basis for establishing 
patient-centered guidelines.

Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a rare disease with few available treatment 
options. Tumor malignancy and surgical invasiveness vary depending on the site 
of the lesion. Perioperative mortality remains high, particularly in patients 
with hilar cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer. Benchmark cases from 
high-volume centers have reported high surgical complications (87%) and 3-month 
mortality rates (13%). Japanese studies of hepatopancreatoduodenectomy have 
reported that although the complication rate is higher in high-volume centers 
than in other institutions, the mortality rate is low; operative safety depends 
on adequate liver volume after resection by portal vein embolization, 
cholangitis reduction, and comprehensive management of postoperative 
complications. Robot-assisted surgery is increasingly common in patients treated 
with pancreaticoduodenectomy even after distal pancreatectomy. However, many 
challenges exist due to device and visibility issues. Recently, adjuvant 
chemotherapies have been developed for the treatment of BTC. The introduction of 
immune checkpoint inhibitors and discovery of oncogenic driver genes have 
increased the number of promising treatment options. Innovations in targeted 
drug therapy, including fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitors and immune 
checkpoint inhibitors, have shown efficacy and broadened the treatment options 
for unresectable BTC. Therefore, a multidisciplinary treatment strategy based on 
surgical intervention is desirable.

Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers exact a staggering global toll through high 
incidence, mortality, and treatment costs, yet clinical research continues to be 
hampered by inadequate patient stratification, challenging recruitment, 
suboptimal adherence, and time-consuming endpoint confirmations. Against this 
backdrop, artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a powerful game-changer, 
offering streamlined trial design, predictive enrollment matching, dynamic 
endpoint assessment, and real-world data integration. This review synthesizes 
AI-driven advancements across the GI cancer research continuum. It covers 
precise patient stratification, automated efficacy evaluations, and remote 
compliance management. The analysis also addresses persistent challenges in data 
standardization, privacy protection, and regulatory oversight. We underscore the 
need for synergistic clinician-AI collaboration, alongside robust frameworks 
that ensure interpretability and ethical deployment. By illuminating the 
potential of AI to accelerate trial timelines, refine patient selection, and 
enhance outcome measurement, we aim to inspire new strategies that can 
significantly reduce the global burden of GI malignancies. Ultimately, this work 
provides a blueprint for stakeholders seeking to harness AI's transformative 
capabilities, fostering a future in which GI cancer clinical research becomes 
more agile, personalized, and impactful for patients and healthcare systems 
alike.

BACKGROUND: Patients harboring gene mutations like KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF 
demonstrate highly variable responses to chemotherapy, posing challenges for 
treatment optimization. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with 
its non-invasive capability to assess tumor characteristics in detail, has shown 
promise in evaluating treatment response and predicting therapeutic outcomes. 
This technology holds potential for guiding personalized treatment strategies 
tailored to individual patient profiles, enhancing the precision and 
effectiveness of colorectal cancer care.
AIM: To create a multiparametric MRI-based predictive model for assessing 
chemotherapy efficacy in colorectal cancer patients with gene mutations.
METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in a tertiary hospital, 
analyzing 157 colorectal cancer patients with gene mutations treated between 
August 2022 and December 2023. Based on chemotherapy outcomes, the patients were 
categorized into favorable (n = 60) and unfavorable (n = 50) response groups. 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to 
identify independent predictors of chemotherapy efficacy. A predictive nomogram 
was constructed using significant variables, and its performance was assessed 
using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in both 
training and validation sets.
RESULTS: Univariate analysis identified that tumor differentiation, T2 signal 
intensity ratio, tumor-to-anal margin distance, and MRI-detected lymph node 
metastasis as significantly associated with chemotherapy response (P < 0.05). 
Multivariate Logistics regression confirmed these four parameters as independent 
predictors. The predictive model demonstrated strong discrimination, with an AUC 
of 0.938 (sensitivity: 86%; specificity: 92%) in the training set, and 0.942 
(sensitivity: 100%; specificity: 83%) in the validation set.
CONCLUSION: We established and validated a multiparametric MRI-based model for 
predicting chemotherapy response in colorectal cancer patients with gene 
mutations. This model holds promise for guiding individualized treatment 
strategies.

Mechanisms and current advances in treating KRAS-mutated lung cancer.

Chao CH(1), Di YP(1).

Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with the highest 
mortality among all cancers. Despite the significant advances in cancer 
treatments in recent years, especially with the development of checkpoint 
inhibitor immunotherapy, a definitive treatment has yet to be discovered to cure 
lung cancer. Lung tumorigenesis involves genetic alterations in a multi-step 
process with heterogeneity and diversity, such that even though cigarette smoke 
has been widely acknowledged as a major associated risk factor, many non-smokers 
still develop lung cancer. Among lung cancers, 85 % are non-small cell lung 
carcinoma (NSCLC), with adenocarcinoma as the most prevalent NSCLC subtype, 
making up around 40 % of all lung cancers. The major genetic mutation drivers 
include the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase 
(ALK), and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS). While the 
advancement of newer-generation anti-cancer drugs has successfully treated EGFR- 
and ALK-associated lung cancers, KRAS mutation-associated lung cancer remains 
extremely challenging and has limited therapeutic options. This review outlines 
the etiology, epidemiology, and categorization of lung cancer, describing the 
current therapeutic options and limitations, with a focus on the most 
challenging-to-treat KRAS-mutated lung cancer. Furthermore, this paper 
highlights the current state and development of KRAS-mutated cancer treatment by 
describing the mechanisms and utilities of various KRAS-targeted therapies 
entering clinical trials, and it underlines the most promising treatment 
options.

BACKGROUND: The disease burden, treatment patterns, and financial costs 
associated with chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression (CIM) in Chinese patients 
with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) remain poorly 
characterized, particularly in terms of real-world evidence derived from large 
populations. This study aimed to describe the incidence, treatment patterns, 
costs, and healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) in Chinese patients with 
ES-SCLC who develop CIM.
METHODS: Adults diagnosed with ES-SCLC who started etoposide-platinum (EP) 
chemotherapy for the first time between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2022 
were retrospectively identified in the Chinese National Cancer Information 
Database. Baseline demographic and clinical data were collected. Information on 
CIM-related events, treatment, costs, and HCRU during EP chemotherapy and during 
follow-up was assessed. Costs and HCRU were compared among patients with grade 
3-4 CIM, grade 1-2 CIM, and no CIM using the Kruskal-Wallis test.
RESULTS: In total, 7505 patients with ES-SCLC (mean age 61.2 years; 17.7 % 
[1332/7505] female; body mass index 23.2±3.3 kg/m2) were enrolled. After 
initiation of EP-based chemotherapy, 6901 patients (92.0 %) experienced at least 
one CIM-related event. At least one grade 3-4 CIM event occurred in 1883 
patients (25.1 %) and consisted of single-lineage (neutropenia [n=609, 8.1 %], 
thrombocytopenia [n=85, 1.1 %], anemia [n=797, 10.6 %]), two-lineage (n=318, 
4.2 %), and three-lineage (n=74, 1.0 %) events. Patients receiving immune 
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) plus EP (n=1674) had a significantly higher 
incidence of at least one CIM during the ICI combination therapy (87.8 % 
[1469/1674] vs. 82.8 % [4827/5831]; χ²=23.43, P<0.0001) and grade 3-4 CIM 
(25.7 % [430/1674] vs. 20.6 % [1201/5831]; χ²=19.51, P<0.0001) compared to those 
receiving other EP-based therapies during EP chemotherapy (n=5831). Rates of use 
of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, thrombopoietin, interleukin-11, 
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and blood transfusion were 81.1 % (n=6087), 
9.2 % (n=691), 12.4 % (n=927), 9.0 % (n=678), and 12.1 % (n=907), respectively. 
HCRU and total costs per patient were higher for those with grade 3-4 CIM than 
for those without CIM or grade 1-2 CIM, and significant differences in the total 
cost were observed across groups (H=195.54, P <0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Despite the availability of supportive care for CIM in patients with 
ES-SCLC in China, a considerable clinical and financial burden persists. 
Strategies that protect bone marrow from progressing to high-grade 
myelosuppression could reduce the burden on patients and healthcare 
organizations.

Suzhou, Jiangsu, China.

BACKGROUND: Earlier research studies employing observational methods have 
suggested a possible relationship between the activity of cathepsin Z and 
thyroid cancer (TC). However, the causal relationship linking the cathepsin Z to 
TC has yet to be fully established, especially for different subtypes of TC.
METHODS: The study employed accessible genomewide association study (GWAS) 
datasets to conduct bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. The 
primary approach for conducting MR analysis was the application of inverse 
variance weighting (IVW).
RESULTS: The MR analysis indicated that elevated cathepsin Z levels are 
positively linked to an elevated risk of papillary TC (PTC) development. In 
contrast, reverse MR indicated that PTC cannot contribute to increasing 
cathepsin Z levels.
CONCLUSION: Our MR analysis suggests a causal role of cathepsin Z in the 
development of PTC, offering valuable insights for future mechanistic studies 
and potential clinical applications targeting cathepsin-mediated pathways in 
cancer.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In current clinical practice, invasive methods such 
as biopsy are commonly used to obtain tumor tissues for epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) mutation detection in patients with non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). This study aimed to explore the underlying association between various 
quantitative parameters of CT perfusion imaging (CTPI) and EGFR mutation, thus 
providing a new auxiliary diagnosis basis for non-invasive prediction of EGFR 
mutation status in patients with NSCLC.
METHODS: Patients with a confirmed NSCLC diagnosis by surgery or biopsy were 
prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent pulmonary CTPI within 1 week 
before biopsy, as well as EGFR gene detection after biopsy, and were then 
divided into the EGFR mutation group and the wild-type group. Differences in 
quantitative parameters between the two groups were analyzed, and significant 
variables were identified for further construction of the predictive model. The 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed, and the area 
under curve (AUC) was calculated to assess the predictive performance.
RESULTS: A total of 86 patients were included, including 45 women and 41 men. 
There were 47 cases in the mutation group and 39 cases in the wild-type group. A 
univariate analysis showed that compared with the wild-type group, blood volume 
(BV) (5.56 ± 1.51 vs. 3.04 ± 1.07, p < 0.001), time to peak (TTP) (29.31 ± 5.12 
vs. 25.99 ± 5.68, p = 0.006), and permeability surface (PS) (18.98 ± 6.79 vs. 
11.77 ± 5.56, p < 0.001) were all higher in the mutation group. No statistical 
differences were found in the other five quantitative parameters (p > 0.05). A 
multivariate logistic regression analysis identified BV (p < 0.001), TTP 
(p = 0.029), and PS (p = 0.014) as independent predictors of EGFR mutation. 
According to the ROC, the AUC of BV, TTP, and PS were 0.916, 0.739, and 0.788, 
respectively, and the corresponding cut-off values were 4.69, 23.84, and 12.11, 
respectively. The AUC of the combined predictive model (BV + TTP + PS) reached 
0.956, which was superior to that of any single parameter (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: BV, TTP, and PS were independent predictors of EGFR mutation in 
patients with NSCLC. The combined CTPI parameter model (BV + TTP + PS) had the 
highest predictive performance and could be more reliable than any single 
parameter in clinical auxiliary diagnosis.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are an emerging treatment strategy for 
cancer, working by activating T cells to suppress tumor growth. However, they 
can cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including psoriasis. We report 
a case of a patient with esophageal cancer who developed psoriasis 6 weeks after 
starting camrelizumab. The condition improved following the discontinuation of 
camrelizumab and treatment with a topical glucocorticoid and a vitamin D3 
derivative ointment. At 6-month follow-up, the patient showed no recurrence of 
psoriatic lesions or tumor progression.

BACKGROUND: Microsatellite instability (MSI) serves as a crucial biomarker for 
immune checkpoint blockade therapy in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, only 
around 40% of MSI CRC patients benefit from ICB. Investigating the mechanisms 
underlying MSI CRC, particularly its association with cell death and the immune 
microenvironment, can provide insights to improve immunotherapy efficacy.
METHODS: Transcriptomic and clinical data of MSI CRC patients were collected 
from TCGA and GEO databases. Differential expression analysis, weighted gene 
coexpression network analysis, and Cox regression models were employed to 
identify five cell death-related prognostic genes (POU4F1, AIF1L, SLC18A1, 
INSL4, and HOXC6). Single-cell analysis, immune infiltration analysis, and in 
vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to validate their roles in MSI CRC.
RESULTS: The five-gene risk model effectively stratified high- and low-risk 
groups and predicted survival differences (AUC > 0.6). AIF1L exhibited elevated 
expression in MSI-H groups and demonstrated a significant correlation with 
ferroptosis and immune cell infiltration. In vitro experiments showed that AIF1L 
boosted cell proliferation and migration via modulating ferroptosis, showing 
correspondence with in vivo experiments. Moreover, enrichment analysis revealed 
that AIF1L participated in immune-related signaling pathways, potentially 
impacting the tumor microenvironment and patient prognosis.
CONCLUSION: AIF1L may regulate MSI CRC progression by promoting ferroptosis, 
serving as a prospective biomarker for prognosis and a therapeutic target for 
personalized therapy. This study uncovers new mechanisms in MSI CRC and provides 
a foundation for optimizing immunotherapy, though further investigation into its 
specific roles is needed.

This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of CRIS and 
potential laboratory indicators. Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients were 
retrospectively enrolled and categorized into two groups: a cancer-related 
ischemic stroke (CRIS) group (n = 41) and a non-cancer ischemic stroke group 
(NC-IS) (n = 213). Baseline characteristics were balanced using 1:1 propensity 
score matching, adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, resulting in 41 
patients per group. Serum levels of 13-(S)-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid 
[13-(S)-HODE] and nine routine laboratory indicators were measured. Univariate 
and multivariate logistic regression identified CRIS-associated indicators. 
Independently associated indicators were evaluated using ROC curve analysis. 
Additionally, cancer patients without stroke (CNSP, n = 40) and healthy controls 
(NC, n = 41) were matched to compare routine indicators. Respiratory (34.1%) and 
digestive (29.3%) cancers were the most common in CRIS patients. Stroke occurred 
within six months of cancer diagnosis in 36.6% of patients, and 75.6% had 
multifocal cortical-subcortical infarctions. Multivariate regression confirmed 
that decreased red blood cells (RBCs) (OR = 0.444, 95% CI: 0.205-0.961), 
elevated D-dimer (OR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.67-3.48), and decreased 13-(S)-HODE (OR = 
3.20, 95% CI: 1.92-5.33) were independent risk factors for CRIS. The AUCs for 
the three indicators and the combined model were: RBC, 0.642; D-dimer, 0.739; 
13-(S)-HODE, 0.722; combined model, 0.819 (95% CI: 0.729-0.908). CRIS patients 
had significantly higher D-dimer than CNSP patients (P = 0.001), and lower RBC, 
lower creatinine, and higher D-dimer than NCs (all P < 0.01). A combined model 
incorporating decreased RBC, elevated D-dimer, and decreased 13-(S)-HODE 
demonstrated a significant association with CRIS, showing potential for aiding 
the distinction of CRIS from NC-IS.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality 
worldwide. Recent evidence suggests a potential role for the neuropeptide 
nesfatin-1, encoded by the NUCB2 gene, in cancer development. This study aimed 
to analyze the association between the rs1330 and rs757081 variants of NUCB2 and 
CRC in a Mexican population. A total of 780 individuals were included in a 
cross-sectional study: 397 patients with CRC and 383 healthy controls. The CT 
and TT genotypes of rs1330 were significantly associated with CRC (odds ratio 
[OR] = 0.6127, P = 0.0029; OR = 2.6574, P = 0.000, respectively), as were the CG 
and GG genotypes of rs707581 (OR = 0.6825, P = 0.019; OR = 2.6975, P = 0.000, 
respectively). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was not met for either variant (P = 
0.000). Haplotype analysis indicated that the T/G haplotype conferred increased 
risk, while C/C had a protective effect. These findings support a potential role 
for NUCB2 variants as biomarkers for CRC susceptibility in the Mexican 
population.

Recently, the family with sequence similarity 49 member B (FAM49B, also called 
CYRI-B) has garnered attention as a new target in cancer development. FAM49B is 
upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues; however, its role and mechanism in 
ovarian cancer progression remain unknown. Herein, we demonstrated that FAM49B 
knockdown significantly increases ovarian cancer cell viability, EdU 
incorporation, and clonogenic growth. In contrast, the forced expression of 
FAM49B achieved opposite effects. Furthermore, an ovo model was used to assess 
the in vitro effects of FAM49B depletion or overexpression on the growth of 
ovarian cancer. In a xenograft model, we observed that FAM49B overexpression 
alleviated tumor formation. Transcriptomic analysis of FAM49B-depleted and 
control cells revealed that FAM49B silencing upregulated the MAPK pathway. 
Consistent with the transcriptomic analysis results, we noted that FAM49B 
knockdown enhanced EGFR activation and downstream MEK-ERK signaling; in 
contrast, FAM49B overexpression exhibited opposite trends. In addition, FAM49B 
played a role in EGF-induced sphere growth of ovarian cancer cells. Notably, 
treatment with the MEK inhibitor trametinib considerably impaired the increased 
cell growth by FAM49B knockdown in cell culture and ovo models. Collectively, 
our results suggest that FAM49B can suppress the growth of ovarian cancer cells 
by regulating the MAPK signaling pathway.

HER2 overexpression is associated with aggressive and poor patient outcome. HER2 
has become a crucial target in cancer treatment, and the discovery of effective 
HER2-targeted therapies marked a significant milestone in treating HER2-positive 
cancers. This led to the approval of trastuzumab, the first HER2-targeted 
monoclonal antibody. Later, trastuzumab was used to develop antibody-drug 
conjugates (ADCs) for breast cancer, which have shown promising results. ADCs 
are combined trastuzumab with a cytotoxic drug to improve effectiveness while 
reducing side effects. Two ADCs, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and trastuzumab 
deruxtecan (T-DXd), have been approved by the FDA for treating HER2-positive 
breast cancer. However, drug resistance has become a serious issue, reducing the 
long-term success of these treatments. This review explores key mechanisms of 
ADCs resistance including alteration in HER2 expression, antibody and 
payload-related resistance, altered cell signaling, impaired lysosomal and 
intracellular activity, and tumor microenvironment. By analyzing recent studies 
in ADCs resistance, this review provides an insight into ADC resistance 
mechanisms and potential strategies for improving therapeutic outcomes HER2

Training and Research Hospital Istanbul, Turkey.

Obesity is a risk factor for the development of breast cancer, like many other 
cancers, and we aimed to evaluate the association between abdominal fat 
distribution and muscle mass measured on computed tomography (CT) and 
triple-negative breast cancer subtype in women. We studied 421 patients with 
breast cancer diagnosed at our hospital who had an abdominal CT scan. Abdominal 
fat distribution, including visceral, subcutaneous, and total fat amounts in 
mm2, and paraspinal muscle density (psoas, erector spinae multifidus, and total 
muscle density) were measured using CT scans. Analysis was performed to assess 
the association between participants' medical information obtained from 
electronic medical records (EMR), abdominal fat tissue distributions, paraspinal 
muscle tissue densities, and triple-negative and non-triple-negative breast 
cancer. Visceral obesity and the ratio of visceral to subcutaneous fat tissue 
were found to increase the risk of triple-negative breast cancer in women (OR = 
1.89 [95% CI = 1.23-2.94]) and (OR = 9.09 [95% CI = 5.55-14.28]), respectively. 
Regression analysis based on body composition also revealed an association 
between low fat and low muscle mass and triple-negative breast cancer (OR = 10 
[95% CI = 5.55-20]). Our findings demonstrate a clear association between 
triple-negative breast cancer and abdominal fat distribution and 
visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio, suggesting that abdominal fat distribution 
is a useful indicator of triple-negative breast cancer risk factors.

AIMS: To develop a prognostic model for cervical cancer by integrating 
inflammation-related gene signatures and clinical factors, aimed at improving 
patient outcome prediction and exploring the role of immune microenvironment 
regulation in tumor progression.
METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed 150 cervical cancer patients from 
Taiyuan Maternal and Child Health Hospital, diagnosed between January 2019 and 
January 2022. Patients were categorized into a poor prognosis (n=60) and a good 
prognosis group (n=90) based on prognosis. The study evaluated the prognostic 
value of inflammation-related gene expression on overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS). MMP-9, IL-6, and COX-2 expression levels were 
stratified as high or low based on median values.
RESULTS: Pro-inflammatory genes (TNF-alpha, IL-6, MMP-9, and COX-2) were 
significantly higher in the poor prognosis group, while IL-10 levels were lower 
(all P<0.001). Multivariate analysis identified independent risk factors for 
poor prognosis, including HPV infection status, MMP-9, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and 
lymph node involvement. A nomogram incorporating these factors demonstrated 
strong discrimination (AUC 0.83) and effective poor outcome prediction. Elevated 
levels of MMP-9, IL-6, and COX-2 correlated with poor OS and PFS, highlighting 
their potential as prognostic markers and therapeutic targets. These gene 
expression alterations were also associated with immune microenvironment 
dysregulation, suggesting their role in immune evasion and chronic inflammation 
in tumors.
CONCLUSION: A prognostic model for cervical cancer was developed integrating 
inflammation-related gene signatures and clinical factors. Elevated MMP-9, IL-6, 
and COX-2 expression are linked to poor prognosis and immune microenvironment 
disruption, offering a promising approach for personalized treatment.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) rarely responds to immune checkpoint 
inhibitors. We conducted a pilot study to investigate chemotherapy followed by 
the addition of nivolumab in metastatic PDAC with limited tumor burden. A single 
cycle of gemcitabine (850 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8) and S-1 (60-100 mg/day on days 
1-12) was administered. Patients who had achieved control of carbohydrate 
antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) (a decreased level of CA 19-9 or <10% increased level of 
CA 19-9 comparing to baseline) were provided adding-on nivolumab (3 mg/kg on 
days 1, 15, and 29) with the same doses of gemcitabine (on days 1, 8, 22, and 
29) and S-1 (on days 1-12 and 22-33). The primary endpoint was response rate 
(RR). After enrolling seven patients, the study was terminated owing to slow 
recruitment. Five of the seven patients who completed one cycle of gemcitabine 
plus S-1 (GS) fulfilled the criteria for CA 19-9 and proceeded to receive 
nivolumab in addition to GS. One patient demonstrated a partial response, and 
the other four patients had stable disease (SD). The RR and disease control rate 
(DCR) for gemcitabine and S-1 plus nivolumab (GSN) were 20% and 100%, 
respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.3 (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0-16.4) months. The median overall survival (OS) was 20.8 (95% 
CI, 16.4-25.2) months. Two patients who did not receive nivolumab continued the 
GS regimen; one SD and one progressive disease (PD) were observed with a PFS of 
3.5 and 3.0 months, respectively. The most common adverse events (AEs) during 
the GS phase (n = 7) were grade 1-2 neutropenia (n = 5), skin rashes (n = 4), 
and fever (n = 3). During the nivolumab adding-on phase (n = 5), one grade 3 and 
one grade 4 neutropenia were observed. Grade 1-2 mucositis (n = 3) was the most 
common nonhematological AE. In conclusion, adding nivolumab to chemotherapy in 
patients who had achieved control of CA 19-9 in metastatic PDAC was feasible.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a unique group of RNAs that lack both a 5'-cap and 
a 3'-polyadenylated tail structure. Current studies have revealed that 
dysregulated circRNA expression is intricately related to the onset and 
advancement of multiple malignancies. Here, the function and associated 
mechanism of hsa_circ_0002669 in gastric cancer (GC) was investigated. Results 
revealed a significant reduction of hsa_circ_0002669 in GC tissue samples, 
relative to adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, Helicobacter pylori infection was 
identified as a factor contributing to the decreased levels of hsa_circ_0002669 
in GC. Functional experiments indicated that overexpression of hsa_circ_0002669 
greatly suppressed GC cell growth, migration, and invasion, whereas its 
knockdown produced the opposite effects. Studies using subcutaneous tumor 
implantation and intravenous tail vein injection models in immunodeficient mice 
demonstrated that elevated hsa_circ_0002669 levels significantly attenuated 
tumor growth and lung metastasis. Mechanistic studies showed that 
hsa_circ_0002669 functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), sequestering 
miR-223-3p, thus upregulating ARID1A, a key target of miR-223-3p. Furthermore, 
the tumor-promoting effects of hsa_circ_0002669 knockdown were partially 
counteracted by inhibiting miR-223-3p. These findings demonstrate the potential 
of hsa_circ_0002669 as a novel diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for GC.

Left- and Right-sided colon cancers (LCC and RCC) are increasingly recognized as 
distinct clinicopathological and molecular subtypes with divergent prognoses and 
therapeutic responses. Leveraging a large, multi-institutional cohort from the 
AACR Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) Biopharma 
Collaborative (BPC) (n = 750; LCC: 363 vs. RCC: 387), we conducted a 
comprehensive analysis of mutational profiles, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and 
survival outcomes. Our findings revealed a markedly higher TMB in RCC compared 
to LCC (6.65 ± 11.3 vs. 3.17 ± 4.35; adjusted P = 3.12×10-32), suggesting 
greater genomic instability in RCC. After applying functional annotation filters 
(PolyPhen > 0.85, SIFT < 0.05), RCC tumors were significantly enriched for 
mutations in BRAF (23.1% vs. 6.7%), KMT2D (8.6% vs. 3.2%), and SMAD4 (13.1% vs. 
7.3%), while TP53 mutations predominated in LCC (40.6% vs. 31.8%). Multivariate 
Cox regression analysis identified RCC as an independent predictor of poorer 
overall survival (OS) relative to LCC (HR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.02-1.66, P = 0.033). 
Notably, KRAS mutations were associated with significantly worse OS in LCC (HR: 
1.68, 95% CI: 1.06-2.70, P = 0.027), while BRAF mutations predicted adverse 
outcomes in RCC (HR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.05-2.37, P = 0.028). These results 
underscore the prognostic value of tumor sidedness and specific genetic 
alterations in colon adenocarcinoma. Our study highlights the need for 
sidedness-specific molecular profiling to inform precision oncology strategies 
in colon cancer management.

The neurotrophin receptor TrkB has been increasingly implicated in the 
progression, metastasis, and drug resistance of breast cancer. While its natural 
ligand, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), activates TrkB signaling to 
promote tumor cell proliferation and survival. In this study, we identified that 
certain patient-derived antibodies can function similarly as agonists, we 
investigated their binding region and functional activities using a reporter 
cell assay and a combination of epitope mapping. Our results reveal distinct 
binding patterns associated with agonistic activity and identify a key 
activation site targeted by these antibodies. These findings suggest that TrkB 
agonist autoantibody mediated modulation of this region may influence cancer 
cell signaling and providing a potential basis for further investigation into 
immune-related mechanisms in breast cancer.

Aberrant production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause DNA damage which led 
to the chronic diseases and cancer. During glycolysis, the enzyme pyruvate 
kinase M2 (PKM2) is responsible for energy metabolism and its overexpression can 
be found in various malignancies. To investigate the impact of PKM2 and ROS, 
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and cisplatin were used. This study showed that H2O2 
and cisplatin induced ROS production and apoptosis in these four tumor cells: 
pancreatic cancer, oral cancer, gastric cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In 
addition, H2O2- and cisplatin-increased apoptosis was partially reduced by 
pre-treatment with an antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in SC-M1 gastric cancer 
and HSC-3 oral cancer cells. Interestingly, the levels of p-PKM2 in the nucleus 
were downregulated after treatment with H2O2 and cisplatin. This phenomenon was 
reversed with the combination of NAC. These findings provide PKM2 may be a 
potential target for anticancer therapy.

SIGNIFICANCE: Cancer is one of the leading diseases worldwide, continuing to 
pose a significant financial burden to national health systems and taking lives. 
These drive the development of early-stage cancer diagnostics, which is believed 
to be a crucial step in improving patients' life expectancy and long-term 
outcomes of cancer treatments.
AIM: In this review, we explore the potential of a label-free technique known as 
Brillouin microscopy, a type of optical elastography, emerging as a promising 
candidate for early-stage cancer screening.
APPROACH: We discuss the main principles of this advanced imaging technology and 
provide a thorough analysis of all known Brillouin microscopy reports in 
application to cancer research and diagnostics. In our analysis, we focus on the 
mechanobiological aspect of the disease and draw conclusions based on four main 
sample types: cell cultures, cells in microfluidic environments, organoids, and 
excised tissues.
RESULTS: We review recent advancements in cancer detection, finding that the 
technique can consistently biomechanically delineate between healthy and 
unhealthy cells, and organoids and tissues across multiple cancer types. We also 
present strides made in imaging mechanical changes in cancer during varying 
stages of progression, treatment, and regression.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude this review with our perspective on the key 
developments required for technology's translation into the clinical realm, 
including measurement standardization, inclusion of statistical and artificial 
intelligence methods into data analysis and automated diagnosis, and further 
hardware developments needed for in situ and in vivo micromechanical 
measurements.

Cervical cancer (CC), a leading cause of death in women, is a preventable 
disease prevalent in low- or middle-income countries due to fewer vaccination 
strategies against human papillomavirus (HPV). Our review highlights the roles 
of key signaling cascades in HPV-driven cervical carcinogenesis, including the 
phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), 
Wnt/β-catenin, Janus kinase/ Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 
(JAK/STAT), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12/ C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4, 
ferroptosis, and Activator Protein-1 pathways. The relationship between HPV E7 
and Histone Deacetylases (HDAC) contributes to immune evasion and oncogenesis in 
CC, underscoring the potential of HDAC inhibitors, including synthetic and 
natural ones, as targeted treatment alternatives. We further summarize the 
therapeutic potential and translational obstacles of small-molecule inhibitors 
(SMIs) that target diverse oncogenic drivers in CC, such as Lysyl oxidase-like 
2, HPV oncoproteins, Murine Double Minute X, DNA Methyltransferases, Glutathione 
Peroxidase 4, JAK/STAT, topoisomerases, etc. There have been promising advances 
in targeting these molecules, demonstrating their potential to improve tumor 
growth, apoptosis, and resistance mechanisms. The potential of SMIs to change 
therapy tactics for advanced CC is highlighted by their inclusion into clinical 
trials, particularly those targeting B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 
homolog, Nuclear receptor-binding SET domain protein 2, and angiogenesis. 
Proteomic signatures, circRNAs, p16, HPV DNA, and DNA methylation patterns are 
among the emerging molecular biomarkers that are shaping targeted therapy and 
early detection methods for CC. In addition, this review also discusses 
bioinformatics and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, including deep 
learning algorithms and omics-based analyses, which offer powerful tools for 
identifying CC biomarkers, facilitating rapid detection, and informing 
personalized treatment plans. Although resistance and heterogeneity are still 
problems, emerging precision medicine approaches are reshaping the way CC is 
controlled. These include the use of SMIs and innovative biomarkers.

Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical imaging 
diagnostics, offering new possibilities for automated pancreatic tumor detection 
in computed tomography scans. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma continues to be 
one of the most lethal malignancies, with early detection being critical for 
improving survival rates. Deep learning models can learn hierarchical feature 
representations directly from imaging data, enhancing tumor detection accuracy. 
However, variations in model performance, impaired generalizability, and limited 
interpretability remain critical barriers to clinical adoption. This article 
provides a comprehensive overview of deep learning-based pancreatic tumor 
detection, discussing fundamental concepts, recent advancements, and challenges 
for clinical adoption. Implementation of deep learning tumor detection models 
into imaging workflows holds promise for improving early detection rates of 
pancreatic tumors. Addressing issues of standardization, external validation, 
and model transparency will be essential to enable the integration of AI into 
pancreatic cancer screening and diagnostics, ultimately improving early 
detection and patient outcomes.

Background Nodal involvement in cervical cancer is associated with poor 
prognosis. Although modern radiotherapy techniques (intensity-modulated 
radiotherapy (IMRT)/volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT)) enable safe nodal 
dose escalation, clinical data, particularly from Indian settings and 
node-positive subgroups, remain limited. This study evaluated outcomes and 
toxicity using a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to radiologically involved 
nodes. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 56 patients with node-positive, 
locally advanced cervical cancer treated between 2018 and 2023. All patients 
received pelvic external-beam radiotherapy (45-50 Gy) with nodal SIB (median, 55 
Gy in 25 fractions), followed by intracavitary brachytherapy (24 Gy in 3 
fractions or 28 Gy in 4 fractions). Weekly cisplatin was administered when 
feasible. Tumor and nodal responses were assessed at 3 months, and survival was 
estimated using Kaplan-Meier and compared with log-rank tests. Results After a 
median follow-up period of 35 months, complete response was observed in 46 
(81.8%) and 51 (91%) patients with primary and nodal diseases, respectively. 
Initial failures were categorized as local in seven cases (12.5%), regional in 
six (10.7%), and distant in 15 (27.3%). The five-year local and regional control 
rates were 86% and 85%, respectively; the distant recurrence-free survival rate 
was 64%, and the overall survival rate was 68%. Patients with para-aortic nodal 
disease (IIIC2) exhibited inferior distant control compared to those with IIIC1 
(median, 29 months vs. not reached; p = 0.047). Late grade ≥3 gastrointestinal 
and genitourinary toxicities were observed in two (3.6%) and one (1.8%) 
patients, respectively. Vaginal stenosis was reported in 14 (25.0%) patients, 
with grade 3 stenosis occurring in 2 (3.6%) patients. Conclusions Definitive 
chemoradiation with IMRT/VMAT using a simultaneous integrated nodal boost 
achieved high complete response rates, excellent pelvic control, and low rates 
of severe late toxicity in node-positive cervical cancer. Distant relapse 
remained the main pattern of failure, particularly in patients with para-aortic 
involvement. These findings support nodal dose escalation as a safe, practical 
strategy and highlight the need for systemic intensification in high-risk 
patients.

Background Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women worldwide and 
the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. While survival rates have 
improved, the impact of breast cancer and its treatments on female sexual health 
remains underexplored, particularly in North African populations. Objective The 
objective of this study is to assess the prevalence and determinants of sexual 
dysfunction among women in remission after treatment for non-metastatic breast 
cancer in Tunisia. Methods We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional 
multicenter study (November-December 2024) including 200 sexually active women 
in remission from non-metastatic breast cancer recruited from three tertiary 
hospitals in Tunisia. Sexual function was assessed using the validated Arabic 
version of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI-19). Sociodemographic, 
clinical, and treatment variables were collected and analyzed with standard 
statistical tests; sexual dysfunction was defined as a total FSFI score ≤26.55. 
Results The mean age was 50.3 ± 23.2 years; 74% were aged 41-67 years. Most 
women (83%) underwent surgery, 92% chemotherapy, 80% radiotherapy, and 55% 
hormonotherapy; only 10% had breast reconstruction. The mean FSFI score was 18.3 
± 11.6, with 87% of participants meeting criteria for sexual dysfunction. Desire 
(59%) and arousal (59.5%) were the most impaired domains, while 43% reported 
lubrication difficulties, 50% had orgasmic dysfunction, and 56.5% had 
dyspareunia. Overall, 74.5% of participants reported sexual dissatisfaction. 
Analytically, sexual dysfunction was more frequent after radical surgery 
compared to conservative surgery (91% vs. 78%, p=0.04), and among women 
receiving radiotherapy (92% vs. 76%, p=0.02) or hormonotherapy (94% vs. 78%, 
p=0.01). Radiotherapy was associated with more lubrication difficulties and 
sexual pain, while hormonotherapy mainly impaired desire and lubrication. No 
significant differences were observed for chemotherapy. Conclusion Sexual 
dysfunction is highly prevalent among Tunisian breast cancer survivors, 
particularly affecting desire and arousal. Specific treatments, especially 
radical surgery, radiotherapy, and hormonotherapy, exacerbate sexual 
impairments. Systematic assessment of sexual health using validated instruments 
such as the FSFI should be integrated into routine oncology follow-up. 
Multidisciplinary, culturally adapted interventions are urgently needed to 
address the physical, psychological, and relational dimensions of survivorship 
care.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine severe bone marrow suppression risk 
factors during radiotherapy in patients with cervical cancer and to develop and 
validate a visual evaluation tool for predicting the risk of severe bone marrow 
suppression during radiotherapy in these patients.
METHODS: A total of 300 patients with cervical cancer who underwent radiotherapy 
were retrospectively included in this cohort study. Patients were randomly 
divided into a model group (n = 240) and a validation group (n = 60) at a ratio 
of 8:2. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed 
to explore and establish a nomogram prediction model. The feasibility of this 
nomogram model in predicting the risk of severe bone marrow suppression during 
radiotherapy in patients with cervical cancer was assessed in the validation 
cohort. The discrimination ability, accuracy, and clinical utility of the model 
were evaluated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration 
curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: Menopausal status, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), clinical stage, 
concurrent chemotherapy status, and pre-radiotherapy creatinine level were 
identified as independent risk factors for severe bone marrow suppression during 
radiotherapy in patients (P < .05). DCA revealed that the nomogram model had a 
greater net benefit in predicting the risk of severe bone marrow suppression 
during radiotherapy in patients with cervical cancer when the patient's 
threshold probability was between 0.20 and 0.93.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram model based on these independent risk factors exhibited 
good predictive performance, assisting in individualized risk assessment and 
facilitating early intervention to benefit patients during radiotherapy.

OBJECTIVES: Cancer can lead to social isolation as patients and families may 
withdraw from social activities due to physical symptoms or the emotional 
distress of the disease. The purpose of the study was to assess the social 
issues and emotional distress amongst palliative care patients with cancer, to 
identify the correlation between social issues and emotional distress and to 
find the association between emotional distress and sociodemographic variables 
amongst palliative care patients with cancer attending the Department of Cancer 
Palliative Medicine, Tertiary Cancer Centre.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study used a descriptive survey design with a 
consecutive sampling technique. Social issues were assessed using a five-point 
Likert scale that the researcher developed and validated, and emotional distress 
was measured using the standardised National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
Distress thermometer scale. The validity and reliability of the rating scale 
were assessed, and the content validity index is 0.8, and Cronbach's alpha is 
>0.07, respectively. Between October and December 2023, data were collected from 
68 patients with cancer who satisfied the inclusion criteria after obtaining 
Institutional Ethical Clearance and informed consent from study participants. 
The data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics.
RESULTS: Majority (54.4%) of them were under the age of 60-75 years, 60.3% were 
men, and 83.3% belonged to a low socioeconomic position. About 2.9% of them had 
distant metastases, and about 27.9% of them had a primary tumour site in the 
pulmonary region. Ninety-one percent of survey participants reported 
experiencing moderate-to-severe emotional distress due to cancer, and around 50% 
of them felt that cancer was a manageable social issue. On further subanalysis 
of moderate-to-severe emotional distress, the majority of them faced moderate 
emotional distress (69.1%), while 25% faced severe emotional distress. In 
addition, social difficulties and emotional distress amongst cancer patients 
were found to be significantly correlated (P < 0.01; r = 0.47).
CONCLUSION: The study reiterates the fact that social issues have a relationship 
with emotional distress amongst patients with cancer. Nurses and healthcare 
workers should take timely efforts to address the underlying issues which result 
in enhanced patient well-being.

OBJECTIVES: Cancer patients endure a significant burden, both physically and 
psychologically. This burden encompasses the symptoms of the disease itself, 
treatment toxicity, alterations in body image, diminished performance status, 
pain, lack of a supportive environment and existential distress. These factors 
contribute to a reduced quality of life and may ultimately erode the patient's 
dignity. This study aims to assess the overall quality of life and dignity 
experienced by patients with cancer, utilising established inventories in the 
Greek context. In addition, the study seeks to investigate the potential impact 
of quality of life on patients' sense of dignity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study sample comprises 100 cancer patients undergoing 
definitive or palliative radiotherapy, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) performance status ranging from 0 to 3. Among the participants, 46% were 
male and 54% were female, with a median age of 63 years (range: 32-87 years). 
Assessment tools included the Greek versions of three inventories: The MD 
Anderson symptom inventory, the patient dignity inventory and the Functional 
Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Palliative, version 4.
RESULTS: Demographic analysis revealed that ECOG performance status emerged as 
the sole characteristic significantly impacting patients' dignity. Regarding 
quality of life, factors such as FACIT-emotional well-being, FACIT-physical 
well-being and additional concerns demonstrated a discernible influence on 
patients' sense of dignity.
CONCLUSION: This study underscores the significance of dignity preservation as a 
pertinent concern among cancer patients. Furthermore, it identifies quality of 
life-related factors as prognostic indicators for the erosion of patient 
dignity.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the relationship between spiritual care 
needs, psychological distress (depression, anxiety and stress) and quality of 
life in Turkish women diagnosed with gynaecological cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with 
111 women receiving treatment at a university hospital in Ankara, Turkey, 
between April and October 2023. Data were collected using the Personal 
Information Form, spiritual needs assessment scale of patients with cancer 
(SNASPC), depression anxiety stress scales-21 (DASS-21) and functional 
assessment of cancer therapy-general (FACT-G). Statistical analyses were 
performed using IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Statistics 
version 20.0 (Chicago, IL, USA). Frequencies, percentages, mean values, standard 
deviations (SDs) and Pearson Correlation Analysis were used to evaluate the 
data. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The mean SNASPC score was 233.70 (SD = 30.02). The DASS-21 scores were 
8.28 (SD = 5.02) for depression, 8.50 (SD = 5.91) for anxiety and 8.62 (SD = 
5.04) for stress. The mean total FACT-G score was 65.67 (SD = 20.18). 
Significant positive correlations were found between unmet spiritual needs and 
depression (r = 0.283, P = 0.004), anxiety (r = 0.271, P = 0.006) and stress (r 
= 0.280, P = 0.005). In addition, spiritual needs were negatively correlated 
with quality of life (r = -0.584, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The study revealed that higher unmet spiritual needs are associated 
with increased psychological distress and decreased quality of life in women 
with gynaecological cancer. Integrating spiritual care into treatment plans 
could improve both mental health outcomes and overall quality of life for this 
population.

OBJECTIVE: Globally adopted as a contemporary hospital management methodology, 
DRG payment systems aim to improve cost-efficiency, advance clinical service 
quality, and maintain treatment safety. Through empirical analysis of lung 
cancer inpatient data, this study quantifies the policy's effects on medical 
expenditure patterns and efficiency metrics, offering evidence-based insights 
for optimizing healthcare resource management.
METHODS: Using ITS analysis, we developed a segmented regression model to 
evaluate the longitudinal effects of DRG-based payment reform on healthcare 
expenditure and LOS for lung cancer patients at a regional tertiary hospital in 
Northwest China.
RESULTS: The analytical cohort comprised 1,076 consecutively admitted lung 
cancer patients. ITS analysis revealed: (1) No significant immediate changes in 
total hospitalization costs (β 2 = -1,365.532, P = 0.684), treatment expenses 
[(β 2 = +147.512, P = 0.524)], or LOS [(β 2 = -0.104 days, P = 0.944)], with 
stable longitudinal trends post-implementation; (2) Material expenses showed no 
reduction [(β 2 = -1,433.072, P = 0.426)]; (3) Diagnosis expenses exhibited a 
significant immediate increase [(β 2 = +1,953.740, P < 0.001)] and progressive 
monthly escalation [(β 3 = +72.184, P = 0.035)], while drug costs showed a 
pronounced policy-induced surge [(β 2 = +4,963.668, P < 0.001)] with accelerated 
growth [(β 3 =+147.378 per month, P = 0.001)].
CONCLUSION: While DRG reform serves as an essential resource allocation 
mechanism, our findings reveal paradoxical outcomes. The implementation showed 
limited efficacy in reducing aggregate costs and LOS while provoking structural 
cost shifts marked by escalated diagnostic and pharmaceutical expenditures. 
These unintended economic consequences may distort clinical practices, 
potentially compromising both pharmacoeconomic efficiency and service quality.

BACKGROUND: Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) are precancerous 
conditions that may eventually turn into oral cancer (OC). The aim of this 
present study was to reassess the data associated with OPMDs and their malignant 
transformation rate into oral cancer.
METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web 
of Science (WoS) to locate studies on OPMDs risk of OC up to July 10, 2025. A 
summary odds ratio (SOR) was used for the analysis of data. To explore the 
heterogeneity, subgroup analyses and meta-regression analyses were used. The 
certainty of evidence was rated using the GRADE protocol.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis 
showed an elevated risk of OC by overall OPMDs (SOR = 2.5 (95% CI 2.43-2.58). 
The highest risk of OC in OPMDs were leukoplakia (SOR = 3.35 (95% CI 3.21-3.50), 
erythroplakia (SOR = 3.3 (95% CI 3.21-3.50), oral epithelial dysplasia 
(SOR = 1.41 (95% CI 1.20-1.73), and oral submucosa fibrosis (SOR = 2.9 (95% CI 
2.70-3.12). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses demonstrated a significant 
positive association between the development risk of OC with age and duration of 
follow up.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a significant association between OPMDs and OC. 
Age and duration of follow up may modify this association. This study provides 
insight into the malignant transformation rate to oral cancer to aid 
researchers, dentists, and clinicians in efficiently controlling this disease in 
the general population.

A 68-year-old female patient, diagnosed with stage Ib left upper lobe lung 
cancer, underwent surgery in June 2021. The patient underwent both 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography 
(CT) and PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations on December 19. In 
our study, we found that PET/MRI identified more pleural and bone metastases and 
provided accurate total metabolic tumor volume, which might have significant 
value for the treatment options and prognosis assessment of certain patients, 
while PET/CT clearly underestimated this aspect. In conclusion, we believed that 
although there was no significant difference between PET/CT and PET/MRI in the 
clinical staging of patients with advanced lung cancer, PET/MRI provided richer 
and more accurate lesion information. The predictive models constructed from 
these parameter data held important value for changes in treatment methods, 
survival time, and prognosis for some patients also in the advanced stage of 
lung cancer.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the relationship between multiparametric 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features - including T2-weighted imaging 
(T2WI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and dynamic contrast enhancement 
(DCE) - and molecular subtypes of breast cancer, to enhance non-invasive 
diagnostic stratification.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 134 consecutive patients 
with pathologically confirmed breast cancer. A comparative analysis was 
performed to evaluate intergroup variations in clinicopathological 
characteristics, morphological features, and multiparametric MRI parameters 
(including T2WI signal intensity, ADC value, early-phase enhancement rate, and 
time-intensity curve pattern) across the four molecular subtypes.
RESULTS: The cohort comprised 134 breast cancer patients stratified into 
molecular subtypes as follows: Luminal A (n = 22, 16.4%), Luminal B (n = 82, 
61.2%), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) (+) (n = 13, 9.7%), and 
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (n = 17, 12.7%). Among the subtypes, there 
were statistically significant differences in terms of age, Ki-67 index, mass 
shape, margin, internal enhancement characteristic, T2WI signal, ADC value, 
early enhancement rate, and time intensity curve (TIC) pattern (P = 0.025; P < 
0.001; P = 0.039; P < 0.001; P = 0.043; P = 0.014; P < 0.001; P = 0.009; and P = 
0.020, respectively). Luminal subtypes predominantly exhibited irregular shapes, 
unclear/spiculated margins, heterogeneous enhancement, and uneven hypointense or 
isointense signal on T2WI. TNBC displayed regular shapes with smooth margins, 
ring enhancement, and uneven high signal on T2WI. The mean ADC value was 
significantly higher in HER-2 (+). Luminal A exhibited the highest early 
enhancement rate, while HER-2 (+) demonstrated the lowest. Analysis of TIC 
pattern revealed that type III curves were predominant across all subtypes, with 
a higher proportion observed in Luminal A and TNBC compared to Luminal B and 
HER-2 (+). Notably, no significant differences were observed between molecular 
subtypes in terms of menopausal status, axillary node metastasis, lesion type, 
number, size, and distribution, internal characteristics of non-mass enhancement 
lesions (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Multiparametric MRI features, particularly ADC values, DCE kinetics, 
and T2WI signals, demonstrate significant associations with breast cancer 
molecular subtypes. These imaging biomarkers offer potential for non-invasive 
subtype prediction, supporting more tailored diagnostic and treatment 
strategies.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, with 
progress limited by tumor heterogeneity, drug resistance, and conventional 
therapy limitations. Nanotechnology-enabled drug delivery offers a 
transformative approach, enabling the precise engineering of nanocarriers for 
selective targeting, controlled release, and reduced toxicity. Recent 
innovations include inhalable systems that achieve localized pulmonary 
deposition, stimuli-responsive nanocarriers that release drugs in response to 
tumor microenvironment cues, and nano-immunotherapies that synergize with immune 
checkpoint blockade. Exosome-based vesicles further offer biomimetic advantages 
of low immunogenicity and natural tissue tropism. In parallel, theranostic 
platforms integrate treatment with imaging to enable real-time monitoring of 
drug delivery and tumor response. This review synthesizes mechanistic advances 
and translational developments in lung cancer nanomedicine, with emphasis on 
strategies that overcome biological barriers such as hypoxia, extracellular 
matrix density, and efflux pump activity. Clinical progress between 2020 and 
2025 highlights next-generation antibody-drug conjugates, nanoparticle vaccines, 
and gene-loaded systems, several of which have reached regulatory approval or 
advanced trial stages. Together, these advances highlight the potential of 
nanocarriers to transform lung cancer therapy into more precise, personalized, 
and less toxic interventions.

BACKGROUND: The main determinant of skeletal fragility in postmenopausal 
patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and osteopenia is 
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppressive therapy. Evidence for the use of 
bisphosphonates, including technetium-99 methylene diphosphonate (99Tc-MDP), in 
this clinical setting remains limited.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of 99Tc-MDP on osteopenia (T-score 
<-1.0≥-2.5 SD for the lumbar spine by DXA) in postmenopausal women with DTC 
under TSH suppression therapy compared with routine calcium/vitamin D 
supplementation.
METHODS: A total of 102 postmenopausal patients with DTC and osteopenia under 
TSH suppression therapy were enrolled in this open-label, prospective study. 
Patients were divided into two groups: calcium/vitamin D supplements (groupCa) 
and calcium/vitamin D plus 99Tc-MDP (groupmdp) groups. Lumbar spine bone mineral 
density (BMD) by DXA was measured before and 12 months after treatment. Bone 
turnover markers were evaluated at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.
RESULTS: The combined 99Tc-MDP treatment significantly increased the mean 
percentage change of lumbar BMD at month 12 compared with groupCa (t=2.156, 
p=0.035). A significant decrease in BMD of the lumber spine from 0.9148 ± 0.08 
to 0.8726 ± 0.08 (t=3.81, p=0.001) at month 12 was observed in groupCa. The mean 
percentage change from baseline in the levels of serum β-isomer of C-terminal 
telopeptide of type I collagen (β-CTX), procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide 
(P1NP) showed that 99Tc-MDP combined treatment significantly increased PINP at 
month 6 (t=2.37, p = 0.02) and 12 (t=2.224, p = 0.029), and significantly 
decreased β-CTX at month 12 (t=-2.746, p = 0.008) compared with groupCa. No 
severe adverse events were reported in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: 99Tc-MDP is safe and could maintain lumbar BMD in postmenopausal 
women with DTC and osteopenia under TSH suppression therapy during a 1-year 
follow-up. Calcium/vitamin D supplementation alone did not effectively prevent 
bone loss in these patients.

BACKGROUND: Fecal and salivary microbiota dysbiosis play a crucial role in the 
pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). We investigated whether the fecal and 
salivary microbiota were altered during colorectal tumorigenesis and evaluated 
their diagnostic performance.
METHODS: We enrolled 30 metastatic CRC patients, 30 nonmetastatic CRC patients, 
and 30 healthy controls between October 2023 and September 2024. Fecal and 
salivary samples were collected for microbial profiling via 16S rDNA sequencing 
and bioinformatics analysis.
RESULTS: Fecal and salivary microbiota composition differed during CRC 
progression, with salivary microbiota progressively enriched in the gut. In 
addition, fecal and salivary microbial co-occurrence networks dynamically 
altered during CRC progression. The natural connectivity of fecal microbial 
community networks exhibited decreased stability, whereas salivary microbial 
community networks showed increased stability as CRC progressed. Finally, 
specific fecal microbial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) associated with 
colorectal carcinogenesis enabled precise stage-specific diagnosis of CRC, 
outperforming salivary ASVs classifiers.
CONCLUSION: This study elucidates stage-specific microbial dynamics in CRC, 
providing novel insights into clinical diagnostic strategies.

Cervical cancer is a one of the leading causes of mortality in women, and WHO's 
initiative to eliminate cervical cancer by 2030 needs to explore several 
emerging research areas for its elimination such as epigenetics which could play 
a crucial important role in the cervical cancer pathogenesis driven by 
persistent high-risk-human papillomavirus infection. Understanding the molecular 
and epigenetic mechanisms underlying HPV infection and its progression to cancer 
is critical for advancing prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies, which 
may play a crucial role in eliminating cervical cancer. Persistent infection of 
human Papillomavirus is intricately linked to the initiation and progression of 
cervical cancer with different molecular mechanisms, pathways, viral genes, and 
proteins. HPV-mediated alterations in the host epigenome play a pivotal role in 
driving oncogenic transformation by modulating gene expression, chromatin 
dynamics, and DNA methylation patterns, ultimately disrupting normal cellular 
functions. The relationship between HPV-induced epigenetic changes and cancer 
progression underscores the virus's ability to bypass conventional 
gene-silencing mechanisms. By altering critical regulatory pathways, HPV not 
only fosters cancerous growth but also influences patient responses to existing 
treatments, posing challenges to effective disease management. In this current 
review, we have discussed the role of epigenetic disruptions caused by HPV, 
which provided a unique opportunity to identify novel therapeutic targets and 
biomarkers. Epigenetic factors, being reversible and independent of direct 
genetic manipulation, offer promising avenues for innovative drug delivery 
strategies. Such approaches could enhance disease management by advancing 
therapeutic strategies and diagnostics for improving patient outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer-related lymphedema, a chronic condition affecting 
approximately 30% of breast cancer survivors, leads to significant physical and 
psychosocial challenges. This study explored the lived experiences of women with 
breast cancer-related lymphedema, focusing on occupational engagement and 
healthcare system interactions.
METHOD: A phenomenological study was conducted with 18 female participants 
diagnosed with breast cancer-related lymphedema. Semistructured interviews were 
used to gather participant experiences, and reflexive thematic analysis to 
develop key themes.
FINDINGS: Five main themes emerged: Navigating the Psychosocial Challenges, 
Enduring Physical Constraints and Dependence on Others, Inconsistencies and 
Barriers in the Healthcare Journey, The Quest for Knowledge and Accessible 
Support, and Insights and Recommendations for Comprehensive Care. Findings 
revealed a significant mental health impact, physical limitations, inconsistent 
healthcare, and the need for additional supports. Participants emphasized 
improved mental health support, accessible lymphedema therapy, and increased 
societal awareness.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the mental, physical, and social challenges 
faced by women with breast cancer-related lymphedema, emphasizing the need for a 
comprehensive approach to care. Occupational therapists are well-positioned to 
provide holistic care, including mental and physical health interventions and 
advocacy for improved healthcare access and resources. Future research is needed 
on care standardization and comprehensive interventions to address the 
occupational needs of individuals with breast cancer-related lymphedema.

BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests that commonly used antidiabetic drugs have 
varying effects on cancer risk. Some antidiabetics offer protective effects 
against cancer, whereas others may increase risk in specific populations.
AIM: To comprehensively compare the effects of different antidiabetic drugs on 
the risk of various cancers in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
through a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS: Four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) 
were searched from their inception until April 11, 2025. Published randomized 
controlled trials that enrolled at least 100 participants and had an 
intervention duration of at least 1 year were included. The inclusion criteria 
were studies involving adult patients with T2DM and interventions that compared 
different classes of antidiabetic drugs with a placebo or another antidiabetic 
drug. Network meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 17.0 software. Confidence 
in network meta-analysis was used to assess the quality of evidence regarding 
the risk of cancer associated with different antidiabetic drugs.
RESULTS: A total of 13535 articles were identified. After applying the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria, 87 high-quality studies involving 216106 patients and 26 
different drugs across seven classes were included in this study. Indirect 
evidence from network meta-analysis revealed some heterogeneity; however, this 
did not affect the reliability of the results. The results indicated that 
antidiabetic drugs did not increase the overall risk of cancer compared with 
placebo. In contrast, some antidiabetic medications demonstrated a more 
pronounced advantage in reducing cancer risk, such as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
inhibitors for thyroid and rectal cancers; sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 
inhibitors for lung and bronchial cancers; sulfonylureas for gastric and colon 
cancers; biguanides for pancreatic cancer; insulin for bladder cancer; 
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for prostate, uterine, hepatocellular, 
renal, and hematologic cancers; and thiazolidinediones for breast cancer.
CONCLUSION: Antidiabetic drugs reduce cancer risk in patients with T2DM. 
However, given the limitations in the number and quality of the included 
studies, our conclusions should be interpreted with caution. More large-scale, 
high-quality clinical trials are required to validate our findings towards the 
optimization of comprehensive cancer management strategies for patients with 
T2DM.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a significant cause of mortality in women 
globally, and radioresistance limits the effectiveness of standard radiotherapy 
treatment. Exploring the molecular mechanisms that contribute to radioresistance 
is vital for improving therapies. This study focuses on the role of lncRNA in 
influencing the radioresistance of cervical cancer.
METHODS: We identified lncRNA-EME1 as a candidate regulator of cervical cancer 
radioresistance through transcriptomic sequencing and RT-qPCR. Its function was 
explored by silencing or overexpressing lncRNA-EME1, followed by proliferation 
(MTT), clonogenic survival, apoptosis, and ROS assays. Effects on BRCA1 
expression and DNA damage response were examined by WB, γ-H2AX focus analysis, 
and the I-SceI-mediated homologous recombination assay. Mechanistic insights 
were obtained using RNA pull-down and RIP assays. Finally, a xenograft model 
with subsequent TUNEL and immunohistochemical analyses was used to validate the 
role of lncRNA-EME1 in regulating BRCA1 and mediating radioresistance in vivo.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate that lncRNA-EME1 is overexpressed in 
radioresistant cervical cancer cells. Silencing lncRNA-EME1 enhances 
radiosensitivity in HeLa-IR and SiHa-IR cells, suppresses malignant phenotypes, 
and increases apoptosis and ROS levels. This effects corresponds with reduced 
BRCA1 expression and alterations in DNA damage repair markers, highlighting its 
role in the radiation response. The positive association between lncRNA-EME1 and 
BRCA1 further supports its involvement in DNA damage repair, thereby regulating 
cervical cancer cells' sensitivity to radiation therapy. In vivo xenograft 
experiments further confirmed that lncRNA-EME1 promotes BRCA1 expression and 
contributes to cervical cancer radioresistance.
CONCLUSION: This study sheds light on the role of lncRNA-EME1 in regulating 
BRCA1 activity and contributing to cervical cancer radioresistance. Our data 
reveals that decreasing lncRNA-EME1 expression could potentially boost 
radiosensitivity in cervical cancer cells.

Cervical cancer poses a major threat to the health of females and is the leading 
cause of mortality in females. Despite advancements in treatment, most cervical 
cancer patients have a poor prognosis due to late diagnosis and resistance to 
treatment. Investigating microRNAs introduces a new path for developing cancer 
prevention and treatment. miR-155, one of many microRNAs, plays an essential 
role in tumor development by regulating gene expression processes, such as 
transcription, translation, and splicing. In cervical cancer, a number of 
studies have been conducted to exploring the role and mechanisms of miR-155. 
Therefore, a comprehensive review summarizing all available findings is 
necessary to clarify the role of miR-155 in cervical cancer development and 
progression. This review presents an overview of the state-of-the-art research 
in miR-155 for cervical cancer, including cell apoptosis, migration, invasion, 
and drug resistance, and highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic 
target for cervical cancer treatment and prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular mechanism by which salidroside inhibits 
the proliferation of gastric cancer (GC) cells through upregulation of 
miR-1343-3p.
METHODS: RNA databases were used to screen for mRNAs associated with tumor 
proliferation and with miR-1343-3p, and exhibiting significant changes in their 
expression levels after salidroside treatment of human GC cells. Gene matching 
and immunoprecipitation of RNA-binding proteins were conducted to analyze the 
association between miR-1343-3p and SOX18. Immunocytochemistry was performed to 
determine the localization of SOX18 protein. The effect of salidroside on the 
proliferation of human GC cells (MGC-803 and AGS) was determined by CCK-8 assay. 
Human GC cells were divided into a blank control group and low- and high-dose 
salidroside groups. The expression of miR-1343-3p and SOX18 mRNA was measured by 
real-time quantitative fluorescence PCR (qPCR). The protein expression of SOX18 
was measured by Western blot. GC cells were co-transfected with miR-1343-3p 
mimic and miR-1343-3p inhibitor, respectively, via LipofectamineTM 2000 
liposomes. The expression of miR-1343-3p and SOX18 mRNA was measured by qPCR, 
and the protein expression of SOX18 was measured by Western blot.
RESULTS: Through bioinformatic analysis, SOX18 was identified as a downstream 
target of miR-1343-3p. Gene alignment confirmed the presence of specific binding 
sites between the two genes, and immunoprecipitation of RNA-binding proteins 
validated the targeting relationship between them (P < 0.05). 
Immunocytochemistry demonstrated the nuclear localization of SOX18 protein. 
CCK-8 assay findings demonstrated that salidroside significantly inhibited the 
proliferation of GC cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Compared with 
the blank control group, salidroside-treated GC cells showed decreased 
expression of both SOX18 mRNA and protein (P < 0.05) and an increased 
miR-1343-3p expression (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, GC cells in 
the miR-1343-3p mimic group exhibited increased expression of miR-1343-3p and 
decreased expression of SOX18 mRNA and protein. In contrast, GC cells in the 
miR-1343-3p inhibitor group showed decreased expression of miR-1343-3p and 
increased expression of SOX18 mRNA and protein (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Salidroside may inhibit the proliferation of GC cells by regulating 
the miR-1343-3p/SOX18 signaling axis and these regulators may present new 
potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for gastric cancer.

[Advances in Surgical Treatment Following Conversion Therapy for Pancreatic 
Cancer].

Pancreatic cancer is characterized by an insidious onset, high invasiveness, and 
poor response to treatment. Radical resection remains the only potentially 
curative approach currently available. However, approximately 80% of patients 
are already in the locally advanced or metastatic stage at initial diagnosis and 
have missed the opportunity for radical surgery. In recent years, with the 
development of novel drugs and updates to chemotherapy regimens, significant 
progress has been made in improving the efficacy of conversion therapy. 
Conversion therapy aims to transform initially unresectable tumors, such as 
locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer, into a resectable state 
through systemic therapies (including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, 
immunotherapy, etc.) combined with localized treatments (such as radiotherapy, 
interventional therapy, etc.). This approach reduces tumor volume and eliminates 
micrometastases, thereby improving surgical resection rates and patient survival 
outcomes. However, considerable controversy remains regarding surgical treatment 
after conversion therapy for pancreatic cancer. This article provides an 
overview of conversion therapy regimens and treatment cycles, methods for 
evaluating therapeutic efficacy post-conversion therapy, the resection rates, 
and treatment outcomes of surgery following conversion therapy. The key 
technical points of post-conversion therapy surgery, including R0 resection, 
venous management, arterial resection and reconstruction, and the management of 
periarterial divestment, are highlighted. The learning curve for arterial 
resection and reconstruction is also discussed. Additionally, the potential 
applications of minimally invasive techniques (such as laparoscopy and robotics) 
are highlighted. The integration of biomarkers, imaging, and artificial 
intelligence holds promise for optimizing individualized decision-making. 
Multidisciplinary collaboration, the comprehensive competence of the surgical 
team, and the mastery and refinement of surgical skills are also critical 
factors that influence resectability and therapeutic outcomes after conversion 
therapy.

胰腺癌具有起病隐匿、侵袭性强和治疗反应差等特点，根治性切除仍是目前唯一可能治愈的方式，但约80%的患者初诊时已处于局部进展期或转移阶段，失去根治性手术机会。近年来，随着新型药物的研发和化疗方案的不断更新，转化治疗的效果取得显著进展。转化治疗旨在通过系统性治疗（包括化疗、靶向治疗、免疫治疗等）联合局部治疗（放疗、介入治疗等），通过缩小肿瘤体积、消除微转移灶，将局部进展期或转移性胰腺癌等初始不可切除的肿瘤转化为可切除的状态，从而提高手术切除率，使患者生存获益。胰腺癌转化治疗后手术治疗目前仍存在诸多争议，本文介绍了转化治疗方案和治疗周期，转化治疗后疗效评估手段，转化治疗后手术的切除率、治疗效果，重点总结了转化治疗后手术的技术要点（包括R0切除、静脉处理、动脉切除处理、动脉鞘剥离处理要点），动脉切除重建的学习曲线，并指出微创技术（如腹腔镜/机器人）的应用潜力，生物标志物、影像学与人工智能的整合前景有望优化个体化决策，多学科协作、手术团队的综合实力、手术技巧的掌握和提升也是影响转化治疗后的可切除性和疗效的关键因素。

[Emphasizing Principles of Surgical Oncology in Minimally Invasive Surgery for 
Pancreatic Cancer].

Surgical resection remains the only potentially curative treatment for 
pancreatic cancer to date. However, pancreatic cancer surgery is also one of 
procedures carrying the highest risks among all malignant tumor surgeries, in 
terms of perioperative complications and long-term prognosis, posing a 
significant challenge to surgeons. In recent years, the centralization of 
pancreatic surgery in high-volume centers, advancements in surgical techniques, 
and improvements in perioperative management of pancreatic cancer resection have 
significantly reduced the incidence of perioperative complications and 
mortality. In addition, surgeons have begun exploring minimally invasive 
approaches, such as laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgeries, for radical 
resection of pancreatic cancer, aiming to reduce surgical trauma, accelerate 
patient recovery, and improve quality of life. The technical feasibility of 
minimally invasive approaches has been validated in multiple studies through 
comparisons of the perioperative safety of minimally invasive pancreatic 
resection with that of conventional open surgery. However, research on the 
long-term oncologic prognosis of minimally invasive surgery for pancreatic 
cancer remains limited, and controversy persists regarding the suitability of 
minimally invasive methods for radical resection of pancreatic cancer. 
Therefore, surgeons should adhere to the fundamental principles of surgical 
oncology, including en bloc resection and the no-touch isolation technique, when 
they perform minimally invasive pancreatic cancer surgery. Additionally, more 
comparative studies are warranted to determine whether minimally invasive 
pancreatic cancer surgery offers survival benefits in the long term. This review 
aims to provide an objective evaluation of the role of minimally invasive 
techniques in radical resection of pancreatic cancer, while cautioning against 
compromising the principles of surgical oncology in the pursuit of minimally 
invasive approaches.

手术切除迄今为止仍是胰腺癌唯一的潜在根治手段，但胰腺癌手术也是所有恶性肿瘤手术中围手术期风险最高、远期预后最差的手术之一，这对外科医生形成了巨大挑战。近年来，胰腺手术在高流量中心的集中化、手术技术的进步以及围手术期管理水平的提高等显著降低了胰腺手术的围手术期并发症发生率与死亡率，同时外科医生也开始尝试将腹腔镜以及机器人辅助手术等微创手段应用于胰腺癌根治术，以期降低手术对患者造成的创伤，进一步加速患者康复，提高患者的生活质量。已有多项研究对比了微创胰腺切除手术与传统开放手术的围手术期安全性，证实了微创胰腺切除手术的技术可行性，但微创手术对胰腺癌患者远期预后影响的研究仍然较少，胰腺癌根治术是否适合以微创的方式完成也仍存争议。因此，外科医生在对胰腺癌实施微创手术时应遵循整块切除与非接触等肿瘤学原则，并且应开展更多的对照研究来明确胰腺癌微创手术是否能使患者在长期生存方面获益。通过本综述，一方面希望能客观评价微创技术在胰腺癌根治术中的价值，另一方面也希望能尽量避免为了微创而微创、为了微创而违反肿瘤学原则现象的发生。

Small-Molecule Inhibitor in Prostate Cancer].

[Article in Chinese]

University, Chengdu 610041, China.

OBJECTIVE: To design a novel bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) and histone 
deacetylase (HDAC) dual-target inhibitor (11b), and to elucidate its therapeutic 
efficacy and mechanisms in suppressing prostate cancer through epigenetic 
regulation.
METHODS: BRD4 and HDAC expression levels were assessed via immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) using prostate cancer tissue microarrays. The inhibitory activity of 11b 
was screened across three prostate cancer cell lines, with the half-maximal 
inhibitory concentration (IC50) determined by CCK-8 assay. Western blot was 
employed to analyze changes in the expression of target proteins, including 
BRD4, c-Myc proto-oncogene protein (c-Myc), and Ac-H3K27, with parallel 
comparisons to single-target agents, including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid 
(SAHA), a HDAC inhibitor, and JQ-1, a BRD4 inhibitor. Cell invasion and 
proliferation were evaluated using Transwell and colony formation assays, and 
the autophagy mechanism was validated using 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an autophagy 
inhibitor. A PC-3 xenograft model was established in nude mice. Then, 11b (7.5 
mg/kg or 15 mg/kg), normal saline, SAHA, and JQ-1 were administered via 
intraperitoneal injection, and their tumor growth inhibition effects were 
observed. The percentage of target protein-positive cells and the expression 
levels of target genes were quantified via IHC and RT-PCR, respectively.
RESULTS: BRD4 and HDAC expression levels were both higher in tumor tissues than 
those in normal tissues (P < 0.01). 11b exhibited the strongest inhibitory 
activity against PC-3 cells (IC50 = 8.28 μmol/L), outperforming SAHA (22.61 
μmol/L) and JQ-1 (22.09 μmol/L). Treatment with 11b reduced BRD4 and c-Myc 
expression by (41.58 ± 3.28)% and (63.21 ± 6.91)%, respectively (P < 0.01), and 
increased the Ac-H3K27 level to 6.52-fold that of the negative control (NC) 
group (P < 0.01), demonstrating greater modulation than either SAHA or JQ-1 did. 
The in vitro experiment showed that 8 μmol/L 11b treatment reduced PC-3 colony 
formation and migration by 97.5% and 96.3%, respectively (P < 0.001), and 
co-treatment with 3-MA reversed its cytotoxic effects. The in vivo experiment 
showed that 11b at both 7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg significantly reduced tumor 
volume and weight compared with the control, SAHA, and JQ-1 groups (all P < 
0.01), with the proportion of percentage of target protein-positive cells and 
the expression of target genes showing trends consistent with in vitro findings.
CONCLUSION: The dual-target inhibitor 11b exerts potent antitumor effects in 
prostate cancer by synergistically modulating the BRD4/HDAC pathways. 11b 
demonstrates therapeutic efficacy superior to that of the single-target agents 
SAHA and JQ-1 in suppressing prostate cancer progression, highlighting its 
potential for clinical translation.

目的: 设计新型含溴结构域蛋白4/组蛋白去乙酰化酶（bromodomain-containing protein 4/histone deacetylase, 
BRD4/HDAC）双靶点抑制剂11b，阐明其通过表观遗传调控抑制前列腺癌的药效及机制。
方法: 采用前列腺癌组织芯片免疫组化（immunohistochemistry, 
IHC）检测BRD4和HDAC表达。在三种前列腺癌细胞中筛选11b敏感细胞系，通过CCK-8法测定11b的半抑制浓度（IC50）值，Western 
blot分析目的蛋白〔BRD4、Myc原癌基因蛋白（Myc proto-oncogene protein, 
c-Myc）和Ac-H3K27〕变化，并与单靶点药物〔HDAC抑制剂suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid 
（SAHA）、BRD4抑制剂JQ-1〕平行比较。Transwell和克隆形成实验评估细胞侵袭增殖能力，联合自噬抑制剂3-甲基腺嘌呤（3-MA）验证自噬机制。构建PC-3细胞裸鼠移植瘤模型，分别给予11b（7.5 
mg/kg或15 
mg/kg）、生理盐水、SAHA和JQ-1腹腔注射，观察其对肿瘤生长的抑制作用，免疫组化染色观察目的蛋白的阳性细胞百分比，RT-PCR检测目的蛋白的基因表达水平。
结果: 癌组织中BRD4和HDAC表达均高于正常组织（P<0.01）。11b对PC-3细胞抑制活性最强（IC50=8.28 
μmol/L），优于SAHA（22.61 μmol/L）和JQ-1（22.09 μmol/L）。11b处理可使BRD4〔（41.58±3.28）%〕和 
c-Myc表达量〔（63.21±6.91）%〕较NC组分别降低（P<0.01），并使Ac-H3K27水平升高至NC组的6.52倍（P<0.01），其调控幅度大于SAHA和JQ-1。体外实验证实，8 
μmol/L 
11b处理后PC-3细胞的克隆形成数和迁移细胞数较处理前分别减少97.5%和96.3%（P<0.001），且3-MA共处理可逆转其细胞毒性效应。体内实验显示，7.5 
mg/kg 11b干预组和15 mg/kg 
11b干预组小鼠的肿瘤体积与质量低于对照组、SAHA组及JQ-1组（P均<0.01），目的蛋白的阳性细胞百分比和基因表达变化趋势与体外一致。
结论: 新型双靶点抑制剂11b通过协同调控BRD4/HDAC通路显著抑制前列腺癌进展，其疗效显著优于单靶点药物SAHA和JQ-1，具有临床转化潜力。

Enhancing Rectal Cancer Staging: Integrating Abbreviated Liver MRI into Standard 
Rectal MRI Protocols for Improved Diagnostic Utility.

Lee H, Kim MJ, Yi J, Paek JH, Baek SK, Jeong WK, Kim BJ.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of an abbreviated MRI protocol for 
distinguishing hepatic lesions during the initial staging of rectal cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 255 abbreviated 
liver MRI (axial T2 weighted fat-suppressed, diffusion-weighted image [using 
three b-values: 50, 400, and 800], apparent diffusion coefficient) in the 3T 
unit. Two radiologists reviewed the images by consensus interpretation. We 
calculated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the diagnostic yield, prevalence, 
specificity, and sensitivity of abbreviated MRI for hepatic metastasis.
RESULTS: Among the patients with too small to characterize (TSTC)-liver-on-CT, 
the specificity of abbreviated MRI for hepatic metastasis was 100% (20 of 20 
patients; 95% CI: 0.8316-1.0000). Among patients suspected to have 
metastasis-liver-on-CT, the diagnostic yield of abbreviated MRI for hepatic 
metastasis was 90% (9 of 10 patients; 95% CI: 0.5550-0.9975), and the 
specificity of abbreviated MRI was 100% (1 of 1 patient; 95% CI: 0.0250-1.0000). 
None of the patients with TSTC-liver-on-CT-or suspected metastasis-liver-on-CT 
images showed unexpected hepatic metastasis at the 6-month follow-up CT.
CONCLUSION: Abbreviated liver MRI is useful for diagnosing the benignity of 
TSTC-liver-on-CT without full-protocol MRI in patients with newly diagnosed 
rectal cancer.

Publisher: 목적: 초기 병기 평가에서 간 병변을 구별하기 위한 단축 간 MRI의 타당성을 평가하는 것이다.

결과: CT에서 너무 작아 평가하기 어려운(too small to characterize; 이하 TSTC) 환자 중 간 전이에 대한 단축 
MRI의 특이도는 100% (20명 중 20명; 95% CI: 0.8316–1.00)였다. 전이가 의심되는 환자 중 간 전이에 대한 단축 
MRI의 진단율은 90% (10명 중 9명; 95% CI: 0.5550–0.9975), 단축 MRI의 특이도는 100% (1명 중 1명; 95% 
CI: 0.0250–1.0000)였다. CT상 TSTC와 전이 의심 소견을 보인 환자 중 6개월 추적 CT에서 예기치 못한 간 전이는 보이지 
않았다.
결론: 단축 간 MRI는 새로 진단된 직장암 환자에서 전체 프로토콜 MRI 없이 CT에서 발견된 TSTC 간 병변의 양성여부를 진단하는 데 
유용하다.

Role of Ultrafast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI in Breast Cancer 
Prognostication: Correlation Between Early Kinetic Parameters and Tumor 
Aggressiveness and Histopathologic Characteristics.

Choe SY, Kim KW, Kim YJ, Seo JY.

PURPOSE: To evaluate whether early kinetic parameters from ultrafast dynamic 
contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI correlate with the histopathological and 
morphological features of tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively included 101 women with breast cancer 
(103 lesions; 85 invasive and 18 in situ) who underwent preoperative ultrafast 
DCE-MRI using compressed sensing between January 2020 and July 2022. Two 
radiologists assessed early kinetic parameters, time to enhancement (TTE) and 
maximum slope (MS), from the time-intensity curves. These were compared with 
prognostic factors.
RESULTS: TTE was significantly shorter in tumors ≥2 cm (p = 0.001), invasive 
carcinomas (vs. carcinoma in situ; p = 0.003), estrogen receptor-negative tumors 
(p = 0.044), tumors with axillary lymph node metastasis (p = 0.021), and 
histological grade 3 tumors (vs. grade 1/2; p = 0.029). Higher MS was associated 
with tumors ≥2 cm (p = 0.008) and invasive carcinomas (p = 0.007). Multivariate 
regression confirmed tumor size ≥2 cm (p = 0.004 for TTE, p = 0.010 for MS) and 
invasive carcinoma (p = 0.012 for TTE, p = 0.015 for MS) as independent 
predictors of shorter TTE and higher MS. Inter-reader agreement for TTE and MS 
measurements was excellent, with intraclass correlation coefficient values of 
0.951 and 0.879, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Early kinetic parameters from ultrafast DCE-MRI strongly correlated 
with certain clinicopathological prognostic factors of breast cancer.

Publisher: 목적: 이 연구의 목적은 초고속 역동적 조영증강 자기공명영상(dynamic contrast-enhanced [이하 
DCE]-MRI)에서 유도된 초기 동역학적 매개변수들이 유방암의 조직병리학적 특성과 형태학적 특성과 상관관계가 있는지를 평가하는 것이다.
대상과 방법: 본 연구는 2020년 1월부터 2022년 7월까지 압축센싱기법을 이용한 수술 전 초고속 DCE-MRI를 촬영한 유방암 환자 
101명(총 103개의 병변, 침습성 85, 상피내암 18)을 대상으로 진행되었다. 두 명의 영상의학과 의사는 시간-신호 강도 곡선을 기반으로 
초기 동역학적 매개변수인 조영증강 시간(time to enhancement; 이하 TTE)과 최대 기울기(maximum slope; 이하 
MS)를 측정하였다. 이후, 이 매개변수들과 유방암의 예후 인자들과의 상관관계를 분석하였다.
결과: TTE는 종양 크기 ≥2 cm (p = 0.001), 침습성 암(p = 0.003, 상피내암과 비교), 에스트로겐 수용체 음성(p = 
0.044), 양성 겨드랑이 림프절 전이(p = 0.021), 그리고 핵 등급 3 (p = 0.029, grade 1과 grade 2와 
비교)에서 유의미하게 짧았다. MS는 종양 크기 ≥2 cm (p = 0.008) 및 침습성 암(p = 0.007, 상피내암과 비교)에서 
유의미하게 높았다. 다변량 회귀 분석 결과, 종양 크기 ≥2 cm (p = 0.004 - TTE, p = 0.010 - MS)와 침습성 암(p 
= 0.012 - TTE, p = 0.015 - MS)이 더 짧은 TTE와 더 높은 MS와 유의미한 연관이 있음을 보였다. TTE와 MS 측정에 
대한 두 판독자 간의 일치도는 우수했으며, intraclass correlation coefficient 값은 각각 0.951과 0.879였다.
결론: 초고속 DCE-MRI를 통해 얻을 수 있는 초기 동역학적 매개변수는 유방암의 특정 예후 인자들과 강한 상관관계를 보인다.

AIMS: The incidental dose to the internal mammary nodes (IMN) is understudied in 
patients treated with newer radiation therapy (RT) techniques. The aim of this 
study was to quantify the incidental IMN dose in a series of breast cancer (BC) 
patients receiving post-operative RT to the chest wall/breast and regional nodes 
(level III-IV).
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 95 high-risk BC patients treated 
between 2015 and 2022. Patients received RT (50 Gy/25fr or 40.05 Gy/15fr) to the 
breast/chest wall and nodal levels III-IV after mastectomy or breast conserving 
surgery (BCS). Exclusion criteria were IMN irradiation and pre-operative 
systemic therapy. One radiation oncologist contoured the CTV_IMN according to 
ESTRO guidelines and divided it into four sub-regions based on intercostal 
spaces (ICS): IMNupper, ICS1, ICS2, ICS3. Dosimetric parameters collected were 
Dmean, V90, V95, D90, and D95. The Dmean was correlated to tumor laterality and 
location, type of surgery and reconstruction, RT technique (3D-CRT, IMRT, 
helical RT) and boost.
RESULTS: Mean Dmean to IMN was 71.4 % (range 19.6-118.6) of the prescription 
dose. Among sub-region, ICS2 and ICS3 received significantly higher doses than 
ICS1 and IMN upper (p = 0.04). V90 of over 90 % was achieved in only 4/95 
patients, 3 were treated with helical RT, and the other with IMRT. The mean V95 
and V90 were 15.4 % and 26.2 % respectively. Univariate analysis showed that 
mastectomy (p = 0.002), omission of boost (p = 0.001), and helical RT 
(p < 0.0001) were associated with significantly higher IMN Dmean. No significant 
correlation emerged with laterality, tumor location and type of reconstruction.
CONCLUSIONS: In our series, incidental IMN doses were highest after mastectomy 
and with helical RT delivery, possibly due to more medial margin in chest wall 
delineation and the helical dose distribution. Nevertheless, incidental doses to 
the IMN were below recommended doses, thus highlighting the need for IMN 
contouring when identified as targets.

Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in women. It has metastasis as 
the primary cause of death and chemotherapy failure among patients. Terpenoids 
possess significant anti-tumor compounds found in natural products. In the 
present study, a terpenoid ingredient with anti-breast cancer from quinoa was 
extracted, and named QBT (Quinoa bran terpenoids). The analysis of western blot 
indicated that QBT inhibited breast cancer cell migration by reversing 
Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). RT-PCR results showed that miR-21-5p 
expression was significantly down-regulated after QBT treatment. Further studies 
demonstrated that miR-21-5p was involved in inhibiting the metastasis of breast 
cancer by regulating PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In conclusion, the study 
reveals the inhibitory mechanism of QBT and provides insights into the key role 
of the miR-21-5p/PTEN/PI3K/Akt on breast cancer migration.

In this study, we investigated the beneficial effect of solasodine, a steroidal 
alkaloid from Solanaceae plants, on suppressing the proliferation of gastric 
cancer cells by targeting Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Solasodine inhibited the 
proliferation of AGS and MKN74 gastric cancer cells and regulated cell cycle 
(Cyclin D1 and p27) and apoptosis (Bax and Bcl-2) markers in a dose-dependent 
manner, consistent with the Gli1/2 inhibitor Gant61 but not the Smo inhibitor 
vismodegib. As an upstream regulator, solasodine inhibited Hh signaling by 
down-regulating Gli1 expression and blocking its nuclear localization without 
affecting Smo levels. Molecular docking revealed stable binding of solasodine to 
Gli1, with a binding affinity of -7.4 kcal/mol. Moreover, solasodine inhibited 
Gli1 rather than Smo expression in Hh signaling overexpressed Ptch (-/-) MEF 
cells. Our findings demonstrate that solasodine inhibits gastric cancer 
proliferation by targeting Hh/Gli1 signaling, underscoring its potential as a 
potent agent for prevention and/or inhibition of gastric cancer.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an important risk 
factor for the development of, and death from, lung cancer.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the risk 
of lung cancer incidence and mortality among adults with a COPD diagnosis in the 
United States (US) and exploring differences by subgroups. We searched MEDLINE, 
Embase, and PubMed from inception to July 2024 for observational studies that 
investigated the association between COPD and lung cancer incidence and 
mortality risk. We conducted a meta-analysis for overall risk and COPD 
assessment methods, and a systematic review for analyses within sex, 
race/ethnicity, smoking status.
RESULTS: Twenty observational studies (n=638,610) were included in the 
systematic review and meta-analysis. US adults with COPD were found to have 
higher odds of developing (OR, 1.76; [1.53 to 1.99]) and higher hazards of dying 
(HR, 1.48; [1.06 to 1.89]) from lung cancer compared to those without COPD. 
Mixed results were observed when stratifying the impact of COPD on lung cancer 
risk by subgroups (ie, sex, race and ethnicity and smoking status). Generally, 
the same trend was observed where people in each subgroup with COPD were at 
higher risk of lung cancer incidence and mortality compared to those in the same 
subgroups without the disease. Individuals assessed by self-reported COPD and 
spirometry showed greater incidence risk but not mortality risk.
CONCLUSION: US adults with COPD, including those with a smoking history, are at 
an increased risk for lung cancer incidence and mortality compared to those 
without COPD regardless of sex and race and ethnicity.

Breast cancer remains one of the most prevalent malignancies in women worldwide, 
with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) posing considerable therapeutic 
challenges due to its poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Aberrant 
activation of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase (MEK), a pivotal kinase 
within the MAPK signaling pathway, has been implicated in TNBC progression, 
rendering it a compelling therapeutic target. In this study, the FDA-approved 
MEK inhibitor Selumetinib was utilized as a lead compound to generate a 
ligand-based pharmacophore model, which guided systematic virtual screening 
across ChemSpider, ChEBI, and TCMDB databases. Thirty-three potential candidates 
were identified, and subsequent assessment based on Lipinski's rule, ADMET 
prediction, and molecular docking resulted in the selection of a single compound 
with favorable pharmacokinetic and bioactivity profiles. Molecular docking, 
molecular dynamics simulations, and binding free energy calculations further 
corroborated the compound's stable binding conformation and high affinity toward 
MEK. Collectively, these findings substantiate the potential of the identified 
compound as a promising TNBC therapeutic and provide a theoretical framework for 
subsequent structure optimization and experimental validation, underscoring the 
value of integrating computational strategies in rational drug design.

The Association Between Radiation-Induced miR-208a, Cancer Recurrence and Death 
Risk in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

Province, 213000, People's Republic of China.

BACKGROUND: Existing experimental evidence suggested that the miR-208a 
expression in tumor tissue from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was 
significantly high after radiotherapy in vitro and in vivo, indicating a 
potential role for predicting NSCLC progression or recurrence. However, its 
prognostic value has not been fully confirmed among patients with NSCLC.
AIM: We explored the association of serum miR-208a level with adverse events 
including cancer recurrence and/or metastasis and cancer death during a 
follow-up for 36 months after radiotherapy.
METHODS: We identified the serum level of miR-208a from 46 patients before and 
after surgical treatment combined with radiotherapy in NSCLC patients. The 
association between serum miR-208a and risk for the cancer recurrence and/or 
metastasis and cancer death among these patients were examined by Kaplan-Meier 
and multivariable Cox analysis.
RESULTS: The comprehensive outcomes during the follow-up period for 3 years 
including cancer recurrence and/or cancer metastasis and cancer death were 13 
(28.3%) and 8 (17.4%), respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that a high 
serum miR-208a level after radiotherapy tended to have a higher rate of cancer 
recurrence and/or cancer metastasis and a higher risk of cancer death than those 
with a low level of serum miR-208a. Furthermore, our multivariable Cox analysis 
suggested that elevated serum miR-208a levels were associated with an increased 
risk for cancer recurrence and/or cancer metastasis (HR=7.5, 95% CI: 2.5-24.9, 
P<0.01) and cancer death risk (HR=5.3, 95% CI: 1.7-18.5, P<0.05) after age, 
gender, smoking, drinking and tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage were controlled 
for.
CONCLUSION: This study further provided evidence that elevated serum miR-208a 
levels after radiotherapy were associated with a high risk for cancer recurrence 
and/or metastasis and death among NSCLC patients.

Fluorescent dihydropyridine-dihydropyrimidinone (DHP-DHPM) hybrids were easily 
synthesized through the combination of Hantzsch and Biginelli multicomponent 
reactions followed by a copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction 
(CuAAC, click chemistry) protocol. Nine hybrids showed promising antitumor 
activity for the PC3 prostate cancer cell line, notably compounds 9d and 9g. 
Both hybrids exhibited high selectivity for tumor cells, with significant 
selectivity indices (SI), particularly 9g (SI >68.8). Selectivity was 
qualitatively observed by the internalization of the fluorescent hybrids through 
high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In silico 
investigations and western blotting analysis showed a selective inhibition of 
the isoform C of Aurora kinase by hybrid 9d. A mechanism of action including 
cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, inhibition of cell migration and invasion, 
and modulation of key signaling pathways such as MAPK, AKT, and mTOR are 
discussed.

BACKGROUND: High microsatellite instability (MSI-H) colorectal cancer (CRC), 
caused by deficient mismatch repair, accounts for about 15% of all CRC cases and 
is more common in right-sided tumors. While early-stage MSI-H CRC has a 
relatively good prognosis, advanced cases often respond poorly to standard 
chemotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, have shown 
strong and lasting effects in MSI-H CRC. Pembrolizumab is now approved as a 
first-line treatment for metastatic MSI-H CRC due to its superior outcomes 
compared to traditional chemotherapy.
CASE SUMMARY: A 44-year-old male with MSI-H transverse colon cancer presented 
with hematochezia, abdominal pain, and significant weight loss. Imaging revealed 
a bulky tumor with invasion of adjacent structures and multiple liver lesions. A 
diverting ileostomy was performed followed by 36 cycles of pembrolizumab. The 
patient achieved a clinical and radiologic complete response. One month after 
completing the treatment, the patient underwent laparoscopic right 
hemicolectomy. A spontaneous transection of the colon at the original tumor site 
was unexpectedly identified. Final pathology confirmed pathological complete 
response (ypT0N0) with fibrosis. The patient recovered well after surgery, and 
follow-up showed no evidence of recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Immune checkpoint inhibitors may cause delayed structural damage to 
bowel tissue even after apparent complete tumor regression.

OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for visceral pleural invasion (VPI) in 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using preoperative CT characteristics and 
develop a nomogram for VPI prediction.
METHODS: We collected clinical data from 282 NSCLC patients (July 2020-June 
2022) who underwent CT scans. Patients were categorized into VPI (n=70) and 
non-VPI (n=212) groups. Demographic, pathologic, and CT characteristics were 
analyzed. Logistic regression was applied to identify VPI-related determinants, 
and a nomogram was developed. Diagnostic performance was assessed using receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and 
calibration curves.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between the groups for gender, 
age, BMI, disease duration, KPS score, smoking/alcohol history, tumor location, 
pathologic type, or CT features (all P>0.05). The VPI group had higher 
proportions of moderately/poorly differentiated tumors, advanced N-stage, 
M1-stage, larger tumor size, pleural retraction, pleura-adherence, and irregular 
morphology (all P<0.05). Multivariate analysis identified significant 
predictors: moderate/poor differentiation (OR=2.41), N2-N3 stage (OR=3.17), M1 
stage (OR=2.89), pleural retraction (OR=4.02), pleura adherence (OR=3.55), 
irregular morphology (OR=3.21), and larger tumor diameter (OR=1.98) (all 
P<0.05). The model exhibited AUCs of 0.933 (training) and 0.959 (validation). 
Bootstrap validation (B=1000) indicated good calibration. The VPI group had a 
lower 3-year survival rate (69.57%) compared to the non-VPI group (80.66%) 
(P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: VPI in NSCLC is associated with worse prognosis. The CT features, 
including pleural indentation and irregular morphology, may be used to predict 
VPI. The nomogram developed will be a valuable tool for clinical decision-making 
and improving patient outcomes.

China.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of Aidi injection combined with 
megestrol acetate (MA) in patients with endometrial cancer (EC) and to 
investigate its effects on serum biomarkers, including human epididymis protein 
4 (HE4), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and cancer antigen 125 (CA125).
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 120 EC patients treated at 
Luoyang Central Hospital between January 2023 and January 2024. Patients were 
categorized into two groups based on their treatment regimen: the MA group 
(n=60) that received chemotherapy combined with oral MA, and the Aidi group 
(n=60) that received additional Aidi injection alongside the regimen used in the 
MA group. Clinical outcomes assessed included overall treatment efficacy, 
maximum lesion size, survival status, tumor marker levels, serological 
indicators, and adverse reaction rates (ARR).
RESULTS: The Aidi group demonstrated superior outcomes compared to the MA group, 
with significantly higher objective response rates (ORR) and disease control 
rates (DCR) (P<0.05). Additionally, the Aidi group demonstrated a greater 
reduction of maximum lesion diameter (P<0.001), improved quality of life 
(P<0.001), and lower serum concentrations of HE4, CEA, and CA125 (P<0.001). In 
addition, levels of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), angiopoietin-2 
(Ang-2), prolactin (PRL), and ARR were significantly reduced (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Aidi injection combined with MA provided a promising therapeutic 
strategy for EC. This regimen effectively inhibited tumor progression, improveed 
quality of life, and decreased serum tumor marker levels (HE4, CEA, and CA125), 
supporting its potential for broader clinical application.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of quadratus lumborum block (QLB) combined with 
butorphanol-based patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) on 
intraoperative opioid use, postoperative analgesia, and recovery indicators in 
patients undergoing colorectal tumor surgery.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 78 patients who underwent 
radical resection of colorectal tumors. Based on postoperative analgesia 
strategies, patients were divided into two groups: the QLB combined with 
butorphanol PCIA group (QB group, n = 38) and the butorphanol PCIA group (B 
group, n = 40). Parameters compared between groups included intraoperative 
sufentanil consumption, postoperative Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores, 
hemodynamic and respiratory indicators, recovery time, Mini-Cognitive Evaluation 
Scale (MESS) scores, incidence of adverse reactions, and lower limb motor 
function.
RESULTS: The QB group had significantly lower total and hourly intraoperative 
sufentanil consumption than the B group (P = 0.014). VAS scores were 
significantly lower in the QB group from 30 minutes to 6 hours postoperatively 
(P < 0.05). Additionally, the QB group showed more stable intraoperative heart 
rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), along with higher partial pressure 
of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2) levels. Cognitive function, as measured by 
MESS scores at 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively, was significantly better in 
the QB group (P < 0.05). However, the B group experienced shorter times to 
orientation recovery, extubation, spontaneous breathing, and overall awakening. 
Lower limb muscle strength scores were comparable between groups, with no 
observed impairments in ambulation. The overall incidence of adverse reactions 
did not differ significantly between groups (QB group: 5.26% vs. B group: 7.5%; 
P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: QLB combined with butorphanol-based PCIA effectively enhances early 
postoperative analgesia and promotes hemodynamic and respiratory stability in 
patients undergoing colorectal tumor surgery, supporting its broader application 
for postoperative analgesia in this patient population.

OBJECTIVES: To establish and validate a patient-derived organoid (PDO) model of 
colorectal cancer (CRC) for drug sensitivity testing and assess its correlation 
with clinical treatment outcomes.
METHODS: Tumor tissues were collected from 16 CRC patients undergoing surgery. 
PDOs were successfully generated from 9 cases and exposed to five 
chemotherapeutic agents (5-FU, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, raltitrexed, 
trifluridine) and one targeted therapy (cetuximab). IC50 values (half-maximal 
inhibitory concentration) and inhibition rates were determined and compared with 
patients' clinical responses.
RESULTS: PDOs displayed heterogeneity in drug sensitivity. RAS-mutant organoids 
were consistently resistant to cetuximab, whereas RAS wild-type organoids showed 
variable responses. In most cases, PDO drug responses correlated with clinical 
treatment outcomes, suggesting that the PDO model can accurately reflect 
individual therapeutic sensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS: CRC PDOs can be efficiently established and serve as reliable in 
vitro models for predicting responses to chemotherapy and targeted therapies. 
This approach may guide personalized treatment strategies and improve clinical 
decision-making in CRC.

OBJECTIVE: Musculoskeletal injuries, a global public health concern, are among 
the most significant causes of long-lasting disability and meager performance in 
activities of daily living (ADLs).
METHODS: Mangiferin (5%) was used to formulate a gel, extracted from 
aqueous-methanolic (30:70) extracts of M. indica leaf. Participants (n = 200) 
diagnosed with musculoskeletal injuries were separated into four groups (n = 
50/group). Group I and II received phonophoresis with 5% mangiferin gel and 1% 
diclofenac gel, respectively, while Group III and IV received superficial 
massage with the same gels. Color, stability test, pH, spreadability test, pain, 
onset of pain relief, stiffness, ADLs were evaluated through the Numeric Pain 
Rating Scale (NPRS), Global Pain Relief Scale (GPRS), and Western Ontario and 
McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) Scale.
RESULTS: NPRS was relieved in Group-I, while WOMAC was also reduced in Group-I, 
along with ADLs and stiffness measures; this improvement was greater than that 
in Group-II for all measures. Also, the NPRS of Group III was reduced along with 
WOMAC and ADLs scores and stiffness, more effectively that the same measures in 
Group IV.
CONCLUSION: Mangiferin gel 5% has been proven more effective than diclofenac 
diethyl-ammonium gel 1% in treating human musculoskeletal injuries. 
Phonophoresis enhanced the effect of both gels, strongly suggesting that the 
topical application of mangiferin gel combined with phonophoresis could be a 
valuable therapeutic alternative to reduce inflammation and relieve pain 
significantly. The formulation of mangiferin gel is nature-based, 
cost-effective, eco-friendly, and prepared easily.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of standard 
lymphadenectomy (D2) versus extended lymphadenectomy (D2+) in gastric cancer 
surgery. Additionally, we explored the relationship between the number of 
dissected lymph nodes, the magnitude of postoperative inflammatory response, and 
long-term survival outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort was conducted on clinical data from 421 patients 
diagnosed with gastric cancer and treated between April 2019 and January 2022. 
Among them, 189 underwent standard D2 dissection and 232 received extended D2+ 
lymph node dissection. All patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed 
by radical gastrectomy. Baseline characteristics, intraoperative and 
postoperative outcomes, inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP), 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), complication 
rates, and survival metrics (3-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free 
survival (PFS)) were compared between groups. Univariate and multivariate Cox 
proportional hazards models were applied to identify survival-associated 
factors. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed for subgroup analysis by 
TNM (tumor-node-metastasis) stage.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics 
between the D2 and D2+ groups (P > 0.05). Compared to the D2 group, the D2+ 
group exhibited significantly longer operative times, greater intraoperative 
blood loss, and more lymph nodes dissected (all P < 0.001), while the length of 
hospital stay remained similar between the two groups (P = 0.708). Postoperative 
levels of CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6 were significantly elevated in the D2+ group (all 
P < 0.001), correlating positively with the number of lymph nodes removed (all P 
< 0.001). The incidence of postoperative complications did not differ between 
groups (P > 0.05). Notably, the D2+ group demonstrated a superior 2-year OS rate 
(P = 0.002) and significantly improved 3-year OS in patients with stage II 
disease (P = 0.018). However, no significant differences were observed in 1-year 
OS (P = 0.067), 3-year OS (P = 0.699), or 3-year OS for stage III patients (P = 
0.428). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified extended D2+ dissection, 
younger age, lower TNM stage, and higher tumor differentiation as independent 
protective factors for PFS (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Extended D2+ lymph node dissection improves survival outcomes, 
particularly in stage II gastric cancer patients, without increasing 
postoperative complication risk. However, it induces a more robust inflammatory 
response. These findings suggest that D2+ dissection should be selectively 
considered, weighing the oncological benefits against the potential inflammatory 
burden, particularly in stage II patients.

University Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, China.

OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in the treatment of recurrent cervical cancer (RCC) and 
its effect on patient prognosis.
METHODS: A total of 106 RCC patients, treated at Nanfang Hospital and Southern 
Medical University from January 2015 to January 2019, were retrospectively 
analyzed. Of these, 56 patients who received CCRT served as the research group, 
while 50 patients treated with radiotherapy alone formed the control group. 
Outcomes compared between groups included treatment efficacy, tumor-free 
survival (TFS), 5-year overall survival (OS) rate, incidence of adverse 
reactions, serum tumor marker levels (carbohydrate antigen 15-3 [CA15-3], 
squamous cell carcinoma antigen [SCCA], and carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA]) and 
quality of life at 6 months post-treatment. Prognostic factors for poor outcomes 
were also analyzed.
RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the CCRT group exhibited significantly 
higher total response rate, prolonged TFS, improved 5-year OS rate, and better 
quality of life at 6 months post-treatment (all P<0.05). Serum levels of CA15-3, 
SCCA, and CEA decreased significantly post-treatment in the CCRT group and were 
lower than those in the control group (all P<0.05). Although the incidence of 
adverse reactions in the research group was slightly higher, the difference was 
not significant (P>0.05), and all side effects were alleviated after treatment. 
Multivariate analysis identified age, pathologic stage, treatment response, and 
treatment modality as independent prognostic risk factors (all P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: CCRT demonstrated superior efficacy, favorable prognosis, and low 
complication rate in the treatment of RCC. It effectively suppressed serum tumor 
markers and improves patient quality of life, supporting its broader clinical 
application.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients 
across different age groups and their impact on prognosis.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted from January 2022 to December 2023, 
including 105 breast cancer patients. These patients were stratified into three 
groups: young (<40 years), middle-aged (40-59 years), and elderly (≥60 years).
RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 52.74 years, with the highest incidence 
observed in the middle-aged group. Significant differences were found across age 
groups in histological grade, tumor size, molecular subtype, Ki67, 
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and carbohydrate antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) (all 
P<0.05). Disease-free survival (DFS) rates varied significantly across age 
groups, with differences in histological grade, tumor size, molecular subtype, 
Ki67, CEA, and CA15-3 levels (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that age 
(both young and elderly), pathological stage (stage III), and molecular subtype 
(triple-negative) are independent risk factors for adverse prognostic events in 
breast cancer patients (P<0.05). Additionally, there was an interaction between 
age and molecular subtype, with significantly increased prognostic risks for the 
triple-negative type in the young (HR=21.418, P<0.05), human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 overexpression in the young (HR=11.216, P<0.05), and luminal B 
in the elderly (HR=8.190, P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The clinical characteristics and prognosis of breast cancer patients 
vary significantly by age group. Combining age with molecular subtype can 
optimize risk stratification and provide a valuable reference for individualized 
treatment and prognosis management.

General Hospital Beijing, China.

OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for moderate-to-severe pain after CyberKnife 
treatment in patients with hepatitis B virus - related liver cancer and to 
develop a predictive nomogram.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 169 patients treated between April 
2021 and August 2022 as the derivation cohort, and 132 patients treated between 
September 2022 and October 2024 as the validation cohort, all at the Fifth 
Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital. Univariate and multivariate 
logistic regression analyses were conducted in the derivation cohort to identify 
independent predictors, which were then incorporated into a nomogram. Predictive 
performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves 
in both cohorts.
RESULTS: Moderate-to-severe postoperative pain occurred in 57/169 patients 
(33.73%) in the derivation cohort and 45/132 (34.09%) in the validation cohort. 
Multivariate analysis identified four independent risk factors: tumor invasion 
of the liver capsule, Child-Pugh class B, cirrhosis, and tumor size ≥5 cm (all 
P<0.05). The nomogram achieved an AUC of 0.700 in the derivation cohort and 
0.685 in the validation cohort, indicating acceptable discrimination.
CONCLUSIONS: Tumor proximity to the liver capsule, impaired baseline liver 
function, cirrhosis, and large tumor size were significant predictors of 
moderate-to-severe postoperative pain after CyberKnife treatment. The developed 
nomogram demonstrated robust internal and external validity, offering a 
practical tool for preoperative risk stratification and individualized analgesic 
planning.

China.

BACKGROUND: Bone cancer pain is a common complication of advanced malignant 
tumors.Chemotherapeutic drugs, regardless of their origin or type, are often 
associated with various adverse effects such as gastrointestinal toxicity, 
immune suppression, and acquired drug resistance, which can compromise patients' 
quality of life and treatment compliance. Electroacupuncture, known for its 
safety and analgesic effects, has been increasingly studied in bone cancer pain 
but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of electroacupuncture in rats with bone 
cancer pain.
METHODS: Forty-eight SD rats were divided into four groups: blank control, sham 
electroacupuncture, electroacupuncture-1, and electroacupuncture-2, with 12 rats 
in each group. Except the control group, rats were inoculated with cancer cells 
in the left tibia to induce bone cancer pain. The electroacupuncture groups 
received interventions starting on the 6th day after modeling. Mechanical pain 
sensitivity (PWT) and thermal pain sensitivity (PWL) were assessed, and the 
expression of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 (p-GSK-3) and glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the spinal cord were analyzed. HE staining 
was used to observe tibial pathological changes.
RESULTS: From the 6th day, PWT and PWL were significantly reduced in the control 
group compared to the sham group (P < 0.05). Electroacupuncture-1 significantly 
increased PWT and PWL compared to the sham group (P < 0.05), while no 
significant changes were observed in electroacupuncture-2 compared to the 
control. On day 12, spinal p-GSK-3 levels were significantly lower and GFAP 
levels significantly higher in the model and control groups compared to the 
electroacupuncture-1 group (P < 0.05). The electroacupuncture-2 group showed no 
significant changes. Inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α were 
significantly elevated in the model group compared to the control (P < 0.05), 
but significantly reduced in the electroacupuncture-1 group (P < 0.05). HE 
staining showed cancer cell infiltration and bone tissue damage in the sham and 
electroacupuncture groups.
CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture significantly reduced the pain threshold in rats 
with bone cancer pain. This effect is likely due to the down-regulation of GSK-3 
activity, inhibition of astrocyte activation, and reduction in inflammatory 
responses.

BACKGROUND: The urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) plays a crucial 
role in cancer development and progression, making it an attractive target for 
immunotherapeutic strategies. This study aimed to develop a multiepitope vaccine 
targeting uPAR by incorporating T cell epitopes and a toll-like receptor 4 
(TLR4) agonist as an adjuvant.
METHODS: Immunoinformatics approaches were employed to predict and select 
immunogenic epitopes from the uPAR protein sequence. The selected epitopes were 
assembled into a multiepitope vaccine construct, including a TLR4 agonist 
derived from Mycobacterium tuberculosis as an adjuvant. The vaccine candidate 
underwent comprehensive in silico analyses, including antigenicity, 
allergenicity, physicochemical properties, and structural modeling. Molecular 
docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to evaluate the 
vaccine's interaction with the TLR4 receptor and assess its structural 
stability. Also, vector design was performed using the SnapGene software, while 
immune response simulations were conducted with the C-ImmSim server.
RESULTS: The multiepitope vaccine construct comprised five cytotoxic T 
lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes, five helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes, and the TLR4 
agonist adjuvant. The vaccine was predicted to be nonallergenic, antigenic, and 
soluble, with favorable physicochemical properties. Molecular docking analysis 
revealed a strong binding affinity between the vaccine and TLR4, with a docking 
score of -334.37kcal/mol. MD simulations demonstrated the structural stability 
and rigidity of the vaccine-TLR4 complex. The computational immune simulation 
predicted a strong vaccine response with lasting antibody production, robust 
cellular immunity, and immunological memory formation.
CONCLUSION: The proposed multiepitope vaccine construct, consisting of carefully 
selected uPAR epitopes and a potent adjuvant, exhibits promising characteristics 
for inducing a robust immune response against cancer cells expressing uPAR. The 
favorable in silico results warrant further experimental validation and 
preclinical studies to assess the vaccine's efficacy and potential as a cancer 
immunotherapeutic agent.

University, Hefei, Anhui Province, China.

Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome (MALS), involving celiac artery compression by 
the median arcuate ligament, predominantly affects young women. Symptoms include 
postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss. Diagnosis requires imaging; 
surgical decompression is reserved for refractory cases. Management remains 
controversial. A 60-year-old man (body mass index: 21.7 kg/m2) presented with 6 
months of epigastric bloating, regurgitation, and heartburn. Endoscopic biopsy 
confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma. Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) 
revealed gastric wall thickening, splenomegaly with infarction, and severe 
celiac artery origin stenosis. Vascular computed tomography angiography 
confirmed MALS, showing aortic-origin celiac stenosis, dilated hepatic artery, 
and Superior Mesenteric Artery-gastroduodenal collateralization. Endoscopic 
ultrasound was not performed. He underwent radical total gastrectomy with D2 
lymph node dissection, MALS release, and splenectomy, with intraoperative MALS 
confirmation. This is the first reported case of MALS coexisting with gastric 
cancer. While the coexistence may be coincidental given the rarity of both 
conditions, it raises a hypothesis regarding a potential pathophysiological 
link.

Postoperative infectious complications (PICs) are major adverse events following 
gastrectomy for gastric cancer. The present study investigated whether 
preoperative programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)+CD4+ lymphocytes reflect 
immunological and physical frailty and predict PICs. A total of 85 patients who 
underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer were retrospectively enrolled. Blood 
samples were collected preoperatively, and PD-1+CD4+ cells were analyzed using 
flow cytometry. Patients were divided into PD-1high (N=43) and PD-1low (N=42) 
groups based on the median value of preoperative PD-1+CD4+/CD4+ cells (cutoff, 
22.3%). Preoperative immune-inflammatory markers and nutritional indices 
included the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio 
(PLR), C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR), prognostic nutrition index 
(PNI) and controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score. Physical vulnerability 
was assessed using the fall risk assessment score (FRAS) and Charlson 
comorbidity index (CCI). The PD-1high group was older than the PD-1low group, 
with no significant differences in sex, comorbidities, or surgical and 
pathological factors. The PD-1high group had a significantly higher incidence of 
the PICs (42 vs. 19%; P<0.05). In addition, the PD-1high group exhibited higher 
C-reactive protein levels, and lower total lymphocyte counts and albumin levels 
compared with the PD-1low group (P<0.05, respectively). The two groups had 
significant differences in preoperative NLR, CAR, PNI, CONUT score and FRAS. 
Notably, there were significant associations between PD-1+CD4+/CD4+ cells and 
NLR, PLR, CONUT score, PNI, FRAS and CCI (all P<0.05). Preoperative 
PD-1+CD4+/CD4+ cells were significantly associated with increased PIC risk and 
markers of immunological and physical frailty. This biomarker may be useful for 
identifying vulnerable patients requiring tailored perioperative care.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most lethal malignancy, and the 
optimal selection of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) remains a critical clinical 
challenge. Tumor blood flow (TBF) is associated with chemotherapeutic response. 
However, the role of TBF in regimen-specific outcomes remains unclear. Thus, 
this association was investigated in the present study. A total of 58 patients 
with PDAC who underwent pancreatectomy after NAC between 2011 and 2023 were 
retrospectively analyzed. TBF was quantified using contrast-enhanced computed 
tomography. Patients were stratified into high and low pre-treatment TBF groups, 
and the associations between TBF, chemotherapy regimen [gemcitabine plus S-1 
(GS), gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GnP) and modified FOLFIRINOX 
(mFOLFIRINOX)] and therapeutic pathological response were evaluated. Changes in 
TBF after treatment and intra-tumoral vascular characteristics were also 
assessed. A total of 35 (60.3%) and 23 (39.7%) patients were categorized into 
the low and high TBF groups, respectively. The prevalence of a therapeutic 
pathological response of at least grade II was greater in the high TBF group 
(P=0.027). A higher pre-treatment TBF was associated with an improved 
therapeutic pathological response in patients receiving mFOLFIRINOX (P=0.010) 
but not in those receiving GnP or GS. In patients with low pre-treatment TBF, 
GnP therapy increased TBF post-treatment (P=0.004), whereas mFOLFIRINOX and GS 
did not. Furthermore, post-treatment TBF was correlated with the number of 
intra-tumoral patent vessels (r=0.486; P<0.001). In conclusion, TBF may serve as 
a predictive biomarker for selecting neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens for PDAC. 
High pre-treatment TBF was associated with improved efficacy of mFOLFIRINOX, 
whereas GnP may be beneficial for tumors with initially low TBF by improving 
tumor perfusion during therapy.

F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 22 (FBXL22) has been implicated in breast 
and prostate cancer types; however, comprehensive pan-cancer analyses and 
detailed investigations of its role in cancer development are still needed. To 
address this, the present study used The Cancer Genome Atlas, Genotype-Tissue 
Expression, University of ALabama at Birmingham CANcer data analysis Portal, 
Kaplan-Meier-Plotter and cBioPortal databases to analyze the correlation between 
FBXL22 expression and prognosis, gene mutations, DNA methylation, immune cell 
infiltration and immune-related gene regulation in several types of cancer. The 
findings of the present study demonstrated that FBXL22 was predominantly 
downregulated in several cancer types and may serve as a prognostic and 
diagnostic marker in certain cancer types, particularly prostate cancer. Strong 
correlations between FBXL22 expression and immune checkpoint genes were 
observed, which suggests a role in the tumor immune microenvironment. 
Additionally, FBXL22 expression was associated with infiltration of 
cancer-associated fibroblasts and endothelial cells, which may affect 
immunotherapy outcomes. Mechanistically, FBXL22 was involved in circadian rhythm 
regulation, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, focal adhesion signaling and 
cGMP-protein kinase G signaling. In prostate cancer, FBXL22 upregulation 
suppressed cell viability, invasion and metastasis, while promoting apoptosis, 
potentially through modulation of the polo-like kinase 1 pathway. To the best of 
our knowledge, the present study provides the first comprehensive pan-cancer 
analysis of FBXL22, which highlights its potential as an immune biomarker and 
therapeutic target for multiple cancer types with implications for precision 
medicine.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Evidence on postoperative nutritional dynamics in Chinese 
gastric cancer (GC) patients is currently limited. This study employs 
Group-Based Trajectory Modeling (GBTM) to identify Prognostic Nutritional Index 
(PNI) trajectory patterns and their factors among GC patients under early oral 
feeding (EOF) management.
METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed 124 GC patients undergoing total 
gastrectomy (2019-2024). PNI trajectories were identified using GBTM, and their 
associated factors were analyzed via multinomial logistic regression.
RESULTS: Three distinct trajectories emerged: ""High nutritional status"" (41.9%), 
""Rapidly declining"" (7.3%), and ""Decline-Recovery"" (50.8%). Compared with the 
high nutritional status (49.99 ± 4.50), the baseline PNI of the decline-recovery 
group was lower (44.34 ± 3.57). High Morse Fall Scale (MFS) score (β = 0.092, p 
= 0.010), low activities of daily living (ADL) (β = -0.655, p = 0.009), AJCC 
Cancer Stage (β = 2.238, p = 0.002) and vascular and nerve invasion (β = 3.540, 
p < 0.001) influence unfavorable trajectories.
CONCLUSION: Postoperative nutritional trajectories in GC patients managed with 
EOF are different. Functional impairment (e.g., low ADL, high MFS) and advanced 
pathological conditions were key determinants of unfavorable nutritional 
trajectories highlighting the need for targeted monitoring and individualized 
nutritional interventions for high-risk sub-groups.

Immune checkpoint blockade has become an effective strategy for inhibiting tumor 
growth, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors that target the programmed death 
1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway, which have shown significant 
effects in tumor immunotherapy. In this study, we found that naturally sourced 
Cordyceps militaris extract can effectively downregulate the protein expression 
level of PD-L1 in human colorectal cancer cell lines. Further systematic 
isolation, purification, and analysis of its active components revealed that 
cordycepin (COR) is the key active molecule mediating PD-L1 degradation. 
Mechanistically, COR specifically and selectively targets the ubiquitin E3 
ligase HMG-CoA reductase degradation protein 1, thus promoting the degradation 
of PD-L1 protein through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This process 
significantly enhances the cytotoxic killing effect of effector T lymphocytes 
against colorectal cancer cells, ultimately achieving robust antitumor effects. 
Furthermore, this study also revealed that COR exhibits potential synergistic 
therapeutic effects when combined with anti-CTLA4 antibodies in preclinical 
tumor treatment. In summary, COR, as the primary bioactive component of 
Cordyceps militaris, demonstrates considerable potential to act as a 
small-molecule immune checkpoint modulator and inhibitor, thereby providing a 
novel therapeutic strategy for the immunotherapy of colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: The hospice care system of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) 
provides a reference for relieving depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders in 
patients with advanced cancer.
AIM: To explore the effects of TCM hospice care on depression, anxiety, and 
sleep disorders in patients with advanced cancer.
METHODS: This prospective study was conducted between July 2023 and June 2024. 
Patients with advanced cancer were selected and divided into observation and 
control groups (n = 34 per group). The observation group received TCM hospice 
care, with a 4-week treatment cycle. The control group received routine hospice 
care. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, 
and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used to assess depression, anxiety, and 
sleep quality changes, and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 26.0 was 
used for data analysis.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found in age, sex, cancer type, disease 
course, or baseline mental symptom scores between the groups (P > 0.05). After 
treatment, the observation group showed significantly greater improvements in 
depression, anxiety, and sleep quality (P < 0.05). The depression, anxiety, and 
sleep scores in the observation group decreased to 7.21 ± 2.48, 6.12 ± 2.39, and 
4.53 ± 1.89, respectively. In the control group, these scores decreased to 11.42 
± 3.12, 10.14 ± 3.21, and 6.21 ± 1.79. The observation group demonstrated 
superior efficacy (P < 0.05). Depression, anxiety, and sleep quality were 
significantly positively correlated (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis 
identified the TCM hospice care system as an independent factor improving 
patients' health.
CONCLUSION: The TCM hospice care system effectively improves depression, 
anxiety, and sleep disorders in patients with advanced cancer, offering 
comprehensive care suitable for clinical promotion and application.

Low resilience levels in patients with cancer have been associated with anxiety, 
depression, and reduced quality-of-life (QoL), resilience serves as a crucial 
mediating variable in these pathways, constituting one of the most actively 
investigated research domains. Recent studies on the correlation between 
resilience, coping styles, and QoL have offered important insights into the 
potential psychological mechanisms through which resilience could affect 
emotional well-being and overall QoL in patients with cancer. These findings 
suggest that low resilience constitutes a significant risk factor for cancer 
prognosis. This study reviews the negative impact of low resilience on cancer 
prognosis and highlights resilience-enhancing interventions. Promoting 
resilience-focused interventions may represent a promising approach to 
ameliorate anxiety and depression, thus improving QoL and potentially improving 
clinical prognosis for patients with cancer.

INTRODUCTION: This study aims to identify potential barriers to children's 
proper understanding of informed assent forms and to evaluate alignment with 
existing guidelines.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The KIDS Madrid Young People Advisory Group (YPAG) 
reviewed six pediatric oncology trial assent forms using a structured 
questionnaire. Investigators provided item-specific weightings. Quantitative and 
qualitative data were integrated.
RESULTS: The analysis showed moderate satisfaction overall. Strengths included 
clarity in describing the trial purpose and risks/benefits. Key deficiencies 
were found in accessibility features such as audiovisual aids, and simplified 
language. Investigators prioritized technical accuracy, while KIDS emphasized 
clarity, structure, and engagement. Gaps were identified in adherence to 
existing guidelines, especially regarding document length, readability, and 
support resources.
DISCUSSION: There is a clear mismatch between investigators' focus and young 
patients' needs. While technical content was generally adequate, critical 
elements for child comprehension were lacking. These findings support the need 
to involve YPAGs to improve pediatric assent documents.

The standard of care for metastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) 
involves the use of doublet therapies, which prolong survival and delay disease 
progression. Doublet therapies include the addition of second-generation 
androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) to androgen deprivation therapy 
(ADT). ADT monotherapy has been associated with adverse effects on skeletal 
muscle morphology, muscle strength, and physical function. Our findings suggest 
that the addition of ARPIs to ADT may further exacerbate these adverse effects. 
This review provides an overview of the current evidence to initiate exercise 
during treatment as an intervention to mitigate these adverse effects. Despite 
growing research in exercise oncology, research on the effects of exercise in 
men with mCSPC treated with doublet therapy is lacking. Much of the current 
supporting evidence is based on men with metastatic castrate resistant prostate 
cancer. Nonetheless, this review examines the available research on the efficacy 
and benefits of participating in a regimented exercise program in men with 
metastatic prostate cancer. We highlight the emerging evidence that exercising 
during treatment has the potential to protect against the adverse effects of 
doublet therapy. Future research to uncover the effects of different doublet 
therapies on muscle health in mCSPC is needed. Moreover, an improved 
understanding of the optimal training dose and timing that would elicit the most 
optimal benefits on muscle health in men with mCSPC is required.

We present an extremely rare case of lung cancer that metastasized to a 
gonadotroph pituitary neuroendocrine tumor, along with other organs. A 
73-year-old man presented with dysarthria and bitemporal hemianopia. Head 
magnetic resonance imaging revealed cerebellar infarction and a pituitary tumor. 
Endoscopic transnasal pituitary tumor resection was performed. Pathologically, 
the tumor consisted of a well-differentiated neuroendocrine component, 
suggestive of a pituitary neuroendocrine tumor, alongside a poorly 
differentiated, highly malignant tumor with invasive growth. One month 
postoperatively, gadolinium-enhanced head magnetic resonance imaging revealed 
rapid growth of the residual tumor. Whole-body computed tomography and positron 
emission tomography revealed a 10-mm lung tumor and multiple muscle and bone 
metastases. Pathological examination of the pituitary tumor revealed poorly 
differentiated malignant cells. It was initially hypothesized that the pituitary 
neuroendocrine tumor had undergone malignant transformation with systemic 
metastases. However, further pathological examinations revealed steroidogenic 
factor 1-positive differentiated cells and steroidogenic factor 1-negative, 
synaptophysin-negative, cytokeratin-7-positive, and thyroid transcription 
factor-1-positive poorly differentiated malignant cells. The final diagnosis 
classified the tumor as a poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma that had 
metastasized to a gonadotroph pituitary neuroendocrine tumor, which showed rapid 
growth. Radiation and chemotherapy were administered; however, the patient died 
6 months after surgery. Tumor metastasis to a pituitary neuroendocrine tumor is 
typically seen in older adults with non-functioning pituitary neuroendocrine 
tumors and no diabetes insipidus. Hence, clinicians should consider both 
metastatic pituitary neuroendocrine tumors and tumor metastasis to a pituitary 
neuroendocrine tumor when diagnosing a rapidly growing pituitary tumor in 
patients with signs of systemic metastasis.

Cancer survivors may exhibit biological and metabolic changes linked to both 
cancer and its treatment. This systematic review aimed to compare metabolic and 
biological aging-related biomarkers between cancer survivors and healthy 
individuals. The primary electronic databases utilized to search papers from 
2019 to 2024 were PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Boolean operators were 
combined with specific keywords and MESH terms in searching the articles. After 
excluding protocol papers, studies with incorrect designs or populations, and 
animal studies, 27 articles were selected for data extraction, synthesis, and 
quality evaluation. The articles were checked for quality by using the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) checklist for observational cohort and 
cross-sectional studies. Cancer survivors had significant differences in 
aging-related metabolic and biological biomarkers compared to a healthy 
population. These include aberrant DNA methylation (hypermethylation, 
hypomethylation, and epigenetic modification), abnormal expression levels of 
lipid profiles (high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein level, 
malondialdehyde, and apolipoprotein C-1), inflammatory markers (interleukins, 
C-reactive protein, and TNF-α), immune-senescence (Cellular Communication 
Network Factor 3 protein), energy regulation (leptin, adiponectin, and 
mitochondria function profiles), and poor oral and bone health. These findings 
reflect the accelerated biological age and increased vulnerability to 
age-related diseases among cancer survivors, as compared to healthy populations. 
However, considering the cross-sectional design limitations, causal 
relationships between cancer diagnosis and alterations in biological aging 
cannot be confirmed. To establish whether cancer itself contributes to 
accelerated aging, future longitudinal studies are needed that assess metabolic 
and biological biomarkers in individuals from the time of diagnosis onward.

PURPOSE: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) contributes significantly to the mortality 
and morbidity of patients with and without cancer. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral 
anticoagulants (NOACs) and endovascular interventions have been included in the 
guidelines for special populations, such as those with cancer-associated DVT. 
This study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of pharmacomechanical 
thrombectomy (PMT) compared to NOAC therapy in patients with iliofemoral DVT, 
and to perform an exploratory subgroup analysis of cancer-associated cases.
METHODS: This study included 126 patients who received only medical therapy (n = 
66) and PMT (n = 60) for iliofemoral DVT. Of the patients who underwent PMT, 13 
had cancer-associated DVT; 10 of them were in the NOAC group. All patients 
included in this study were retrospectively analyzed after 6 months and 1 year. 
The Villalta scale was used to measure the severity of post-thrombotic syndrome.
RESULTS: Villalta scores 1 year after DVT onset showed a strong positive 
correlation with those 6 months after DVT onset (ρ = 0.803, P < 0.001). 
Cancer-associated DVT patients (n = 13) who underwent PMT showed superior 1-year 
Villalta scores than did cancer patients (n = 10) who received NOAC treatment 
(Villalta score,12 vs. 8). This difference was similar to that observed in the 
non-cancer-associated population who underwent PMT (Villalta score,11 vs. 8).
CONCLUSION: Acute proximal DVT, regardless of malignancy induction, can be 
treated with endovascular interventions along with medical therapies. The 
evolution and development of endovascular treatments for DVT can improve the 
declining quality of life among patients with cancer-associated DVT.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose was to highlight the co-design process of intervention 
materials as part of a multi-site research collaborative designed to address the 
burden of cervical cancer incidence and mortality in the Appalachian region.
METHODS: Program documentation and research staff interviews were used to detail 
the six-step co-design process along with the eight-step community feedback loop 
used to develop intervention materials.
RESULTS: Feedback was received via key informant interviews and focus groups 
from healthcare providers (n = 27), community members (n = 164), and Community 
Advisory Board members (n = 8) for a total of 172 individuals engaged in the 
co-design process. Staff received 179 unique pieces of community feedback on 
intervention materials (n = 14) which were divided between the coding categories 
of wording (32 %), visual (36 %), and content (31 %).
CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that community co-design can be effectively 
integrated within a large, multi-state research collaborative to ensure 
intervention materials are reflective of the populations they are intended to 
reach.
INNOVATION: A practical approach to co-design is described which can be adapted 
by other large, multi-site research studies. The types of community feedback 
that researchers can expect during this process are elucidated.

BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is a common side effect of cancer treatment and is 
frequently cited as a top concern and unmet need for cancer survivors. This 
paper outlines the development of clinical recommendations to better support 
people with chronic pain as a long-term or late side effect of cancer and its 
treatment.
METHOD: Evidence was identified from empirical research, and new insights from 
cancer survivors (n = 19) and healthcare professionals (n = 135), with findings 
informing draft clinical recommendations. These recommendations were reviewed 
and refined within online stakeholder engagement events, which comprised Phase 1 
researcher review (n = 5) and Phase 2 Expert Review Panels (four groups and two 
one-to-one discussions). Membership of expert panels included cancer survivors 
living with chronic pain after cancer, and clinical, research, and education 
experts (n = 16). Data generated from Expert Review Panels were analysed using 
inductive qualitative content analysis.
RESULTS: There was shared opinion among stakeholders that the recommendations 
would be beneficial in this setting, the recommendations reflected the evidence 
and the complexity of implementation was acknowledged. Validating cancer 
survivors' experiences of chronic pain was seen as essential to best practice 
and the importance of informed patients and healthcare professionals making good 
decisions together was recognised.
CONCLUSIONS: Resultant clinical recommendations are summarised as: PAINS: 
Prepare and inform, Acknowledge and listen, Increase healthcare professional 
knowledge, Name and diagnose, and Services and supported self-management 
interventions. Implementation strategies and future research are proposed.

INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) continues to exhibit 
resistance to immunotherapy. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of 
combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced 
pancreatic cancer. Additionally, we employed a multimodal analytical approach to 
elucidate the immune landscape and conduct transcriptomic profiling in PDAC.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 52 
patients diagnosed with advanced PDAC who underwent a combined treatment regimen 
of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. The study evaluated the objective response 
rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and progression-free survival (PFS). To 
characterize the immune landscape in treatment-naive pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors and in the systemic circulation, flow cytometry, 
multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC), and whole transcriptome sequencing were 
employed.
RESULTS: The study reported an ORR of 32.7%, a DCR of 67.3%, and a 6-month PFS 
rate of 38.5%, with a median PFS of 5.5 months. Patients treated with a 
combination of immunotherapy and gemcitabine achieved the longest PFS. The 
first-line treatment cohort exhibited a significantly higher DCR (79.3% vs. 
52.2%, P = 0.038) and a longer median PFS (6.6 vs. 3.5 months, P = 0.032) 
compared to the second-line treatment cohort. The efficacy of treatment varied 
depending on the drug combinations used. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a 
greater frequency of CD45- CD64+ cells in the peripheral blood of patients with 
progressive disease (PD) compared to those with a partial response (PR). 
Multiplex immunofluorescence (MIF) analysis indicated an increased intratumoral 
infiltration of CD8+ T cells and CD137+ CD8+ T cells in patients with PR. Whole 
transcriptome sequencing (WTSS) identified key genes involved in immune 
regulation, signal transduction, and digestive function. Hemopexin (HPX) and 
regulatory factor X-associated protein (RFXAP) were upregulated in PR patients 
and showed a positive correlation with survival, whereas Interleukin-6 (IL-6) 
expression was linked to poor prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that immunochemotherapy shows potential for 
the treatment of advanced PDAC. Our study elucidates the immune landscape 
associated with PDAC and provides critical insights for the identification of 
prospective therapeutic targets, which could guide the development of innovative 
combination immunotherapy strategies.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the relationship between tumor cell 
glutamine metabolism and CD8 T cells, with the goal of providing new insights to 
improve immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: Using the The Cancer Genome Atlas - Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma 
(TCGA-PAAD) cohort, we computed gene expression scores related to glutamine 
metabolism and stratified patients into high- and low-score groups. Prognosis 
and differences in immune cell anti-tumor activity were compared between these 
groups. We further utilized single-cell RNA sequencing data to quantitatively 
assess the expression of glutamine metabolism-related pathways in tumor cells. 
Based on tumor-specific glutamine metabolism gene expression, patients were 
again classified into high- and low-score groups. The immune remodeling effects 
exerted by tumor cell glutamine metabolism on CD8 T cells were subsequently 
investigated. To examine the impact of perturbing glutamine metabolism within 
the tumor microenvironment on CD8 T cell phenotype and the efficacy of PD-1 
inhibitors, we conducted in vivo animal experiments.
RESULTS: we analyzed the pancreatic cancer dataset in the cancer gene atlas 
database. We found that tumor glutamine metabolism was negatively correlated 
with patient prognosis and anti-tumor activity. Next, we defined two types of 
CD8 effector T cells in single-cell RNA sequencing data, namely, effector memory 
T cells (CD8-Tem) and terminally differentiated effector memory T cells 
(CD8-Temra). Under the pressure of high glutamine metabolism in tumor cells, the 
cytotoxicity of the CD8-Tem subset was reduced, and its immaturity score 
increased, while the exhaustion score of the CD8-Temra subset increased. 
Pseudotime analysis showed that CD8-Tn in the low-scoring group mainly developed 
into CD8-Tem subset, and its immune activation pathway was significantly 
upregulated. In addition, we found that the glutamine metabolism inhibitor 
JHU083 promoted the infiltration of CD4 and CD8 T cells and T lymphocyte 
differentiation, and increased the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors. Glutamine 
inhibitors can inhibit the apoptosis of immune cells in the tumor 
microenvironment, while promoting CD8 T cells activation and cytotoxicity 
increase.
CONCLUSION: Inhibition of glutamine metabolism within the pancreatic cancer 
microenvironment results in reduced apoptosis of immune cells, heightened 
activation and cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells, and a substantial enhancement in the 
therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy.

INTRODUCTION: Fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma (FH-deficient 
RCC) is a rare, aggressive malignancy with limited therapeutic options and poor 
prognosis. Despite immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) showing efficacy in other 
cancers, responses in FH-deficient RCC remain suboptimal. Metabolic remodeling, 
particularly the Warburg effect-driven glycolysis, is implicated in immune 
evasion and tumor progression, highlighting the need for predictive biomarkers 
and combinatorial strategies.
METHODS: We integrated 41 single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) datasets (19 
malignancies, 405 patients, 1,220,365 cells) to develop a glycolytic signature 
(Glyc.Sig). Validation included pan-cancer transcriptomic analysis (30 cancer 
types, n=10,154), CRISPR screening data (4 cancers), and clinical immunotherapy 
cohorts (5 cancers, n=921). LDHA was identified as a top-ranked immune-resistant 
candidate through CRISPR screening analysis, validated via immunoblotting and 
immunohistochemistry in Renji Hospital cohorts.
RESULTS: Glyc.Sig exhibited a robust inverse correlation between glycolytic 
activity and ICI efficacy across malignancies. It outperformed conventional 
biomarkers in predicting immunotherapy outcomes. CRISPR screening prioritized 
LDHA, a key glycolytic enzyme, as a target to enhance ICI response. Clinical 
validation confirmed elevated LDHA expression in FH-deficient RCC tumor tissues, 
which may correlate with immunosuppressive microenvironments and resistance to 
ICIs. Combinatorial LDHA inhibition and ICI treatment may demonstrate 
synergistic antitumor effects.
DISCUSSION: This study establishes Glyc.Sig as a dual diagnostic-predictive 
biomarker system, linking glycolytic reprogramming to immune evasion. 
Comparative validation revealed its enhanced predictive capacity for ICI 
responsiveness relative to existing molecular signatures. LDHA inhibition 
emerges as a promising strategy to overcome ICI resistance in FH-deficient RCC 
and other glycolytic tumors. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential 
of targeting cancer metabolism to optimize immunotherapy efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BRCA) is the most common malignancy and leading cause 
of mortality among women, with rising incidence in younger patients. Although 
treatments have advanced, outcomes for advanced BRCA remain poor. Synthetic 
lethality (SL) offers promise in precision oncology, but resistance limits its 
benefit.
METHODS: We integrated TCGA-BRCA and GEO datasets with SL gene sets to identify 
candidate genes. Differential expression analysis and WGCNA were performed, with 
key modules defined by clinical subgroups (≤40 vs. >40 years). Candidate genes 
were further validated by machine learning, Mendelian randomization (MR), and 
single-cell transcriptomic analysis. Functional experiments were conducted for 
confirmation.
RESULTS: Sixteen age-associated SL genes were identified. NEK2, IBSP, and PYCR1 
showed strong diagnostic value (AUC > 0.90), enriched in cell cycle, DNA repair, 
and drug resistance pathways. MR consistently confirmed SLC7A5 as a robust 
candidate gene, linking metabolic regulation to BRCA risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Age-associated SL genes play critical roles in BRCA, with SLC7A5 
highlighted as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target. These findings 
provide insights for early diagnosis and metabolism-based precision therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer stands is a leading prevalent and potential fatal 
infection affecting women worldwide, posing the requirement of a reliable and 
interpretable diagnostic system. The Deep Learning (DL) methods highly 
contribute towards medical imagery analysis but due to the black-box nature, its 
clinical adoption is limited due to lack of interpretability.
METHODS: This proposed work introduces a hybrid Deep Learning (DL) framework for 
that integrates three distinct convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained 
architectures: DENSENET121, Xception and VGG16. The proposed fusion strategy 
enhances feature representation and classification performance through model 
integration. To address the DL's black-box nature and promote clinical 
acceptance, the proposed framework incorporates an explainable artificial 
intelligence (XAI) component utilizing GradCAM++.
RESULTS: Experimental evaluation on benchmark breast cancer datasets 
demonstrates improved classification accuracy by approximately 13\% compared to 
individual models, demonstrating high performance of the fusion method with an 
accuracy of 97\%.
DISCUSSION: The use of fused DL model enhances the performance of the 
classification system offering higher accuracy and robust feature extraction. 
With the introduction of XAI, the cancer classification system presents 
interpretable results making it applicable in clinical contexts. GRADCAM++ 
method highlights the multiple lesions with finer edges from the ultrasound 
images that leads towards the model's predictions, offering transparency and 
aiding medical professionals in diagnostic validation.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent malignancy of the digestive system, with 
metastatic CRC (mCRC) exhibiting persistently poor overall survival rates. 
Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop more effective and safer 
therapeutic strategies. In recent years, immunotherapy has emerged as a 
groundbreaking approach in CRC treatment. This review highlights the 
advancements in immune checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs), cancer vaccines, oncolytic 
virotherapy, adoptive cell therapy(ACT), and matrix-depletion therapy. 
Additionally, we explore potential combinatorial immunotherapy strategies for 
CRC, emphasizing their clinical applications and addressing the challenges 
associated with CRC immunotherapy. By proposing strategies to overcome these 
limitations, this review aims to provide novel insights into the evolving 
landscape of CRC immunotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are fibrous, web like 
chromatin structures released by activated neutrophils that entrap and 
immobilize pathogens through histones, granule derived proteolytic enzymes, and 
myeloperoxidase (MPO) dependent mechanisms. Beyond host defense, NETs have been 
implicated in tumor progression; yet anticancer activity also has been reported, 
and findings vary across specimen types (tumor tissue versus blood) and 
detection methods, antibody panels, leaving their role in oncogenesis uncertain. 
We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to define the prognostic 
significance of NETs in cancer, stratified by specimen type, detection 
technique, and antibody panels.
METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the 
Cochrane Library for studies published through August 10, 2023, that reported 
quantitative NET measurements linked to oncologic outcomes.
RESULTS: Fifteen studies (5,202 patients; publication years 2016-2023) reporting 
hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) 
relative to NET levels met inclusion criteria. Six studies evaluated tumor 
derived NETs in tissue and nine assessed circulating NETs in blood. Among tissue 
studies, two used immunohistochemistry for citrullinated histone H3 (H3Cit) 
alone, and four applied multiplex immunofluorescence for MPO/H3Cit or neutrophil 
elastase (NE)/H3Cit. Among blood studies, enzyme linked immunosorbent assays 
targeting MPO/DNA predominated, followed by H3Cit assays. Higher NET levels were 
significantly associated with worse OS (HR 1.80; 95% CI 1.35-2.41) and DFS (HR 
2.26; 95% CI 1.82-2.82), irrespective of tissue or blood based measurement. 
Prognostic associations were robust for MPO/DNA, H3Cit, and NE, but not for cell 
free DNA.
CONCLUSION: Elevated NET levels predict poorer outcomes in patients with cancer 
independent of specimen source and most analytic modalities (except cell free 
DNA), supporting NETs as a promising biomarker for risk stratification and 
precision oncologic decision making.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification of 
eukaryotic mRNA and has emerged as a pivotal regulator of gene expression at the 
post-transcriptional level. In the tumor immune microenvironment, 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) represent a highly plastic and heterogeneous 
population that profoundly influences cancer progression, immune evasion, and 
therapeutic response. Recent studies have uncovered that m6A modification, 
mediated by dynamic ""writers,"" ""erasers,"" and ""readers,"" exerts critical 
regulatory effects on TAM differentiation, polarization, and functional 
reprogramming. By modulating the stability, translation, and decay of 
transcripts involved in inflammatory signaling, metabolic adaptation, and immune 
checkpoints, m6A shapes the balance between tumor-promoting (M2-like) and 
tumor-suppressive (M1-like) macrophage phenotypes. Moreover, dysregulation of 
m6A machinery in TAMs has been linked to the suppression of anti-tumor immunity 
and resistance to immunotherapy, highlighting its translational potential as a 
therapeutic target. This review summarizes current advances in understanding the 
roles and mechanisms of m6A modification in TAM biology, discusses its 
implications in tumor immunity, and outlines the challenges and opportunities of 
targeting the m6A-TAM axis for cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: This study investigates the influence of glycolytic activity on the 
efficacy of radiotherapy in breast cancer (BRCA) patients, aiming to develop a 
glycolysis-related radiosensitivity signature to predict radiotherapy efficacy.
METHODS: We categorized BRCA patients into low and high glycolysis groups using 
ssGSEA analysis based on 200 glycolysis-related genes. Univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression analyses, were used to construct a radiosensitivity 
signature. Immune cell infiltration and pathway enrichment analyses were 
conducted using ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT methods. The TIDE algorithm and 
pRRophetic algorithm were employed to predict responses to radiotherapy. 
Radioresistant BRCA cells were examined using CCK-8 assay. Key genes identified 
in the radiosensitivity signature were validated in vitro by qRT-PCR. Seahorse 
assay was used to evaluate cellular glycolytic capacity.
RESULTS: Our analyses revealed that patients in the low-glycolysis group 
exhibited enhanced sensitivity to radiotherapy, suggesting that glycolytic 
activity is a critical determinant of radiotherapy. Subsequently, we developed a 
four-gene radiosensitivity signature that effectively stratified patients into 
radiosensitive (RS) and radioresistant (RR) groups. Survival analysis revealed 
that radiotherapy significantly improves outcomes in the RS group but not in the 
RR group. Immune infiltration analysis indicated that the RS group correlates 
with an active immune landscape, as evidenced by lower TIDE scores and higher 
responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Notably, patients in the RS 
group with high PD-L1 expression showed significantly better outcomes, 
associated with increased immune cell infiltration. In vitro validation using 
MCF-7 and radioresistant MCF-7/IR cell lines confirmed that radioresistant 
MCF-7/IR cells exhibit increased glycolytic activity.
CONCLUSION: Our study establishes glycolytic activity as a promising predictor 
of radiotherapy efficacy in BRCA patients and develops a novel radiosensitivity 
signature with potential clinical utility in guiding personalized treatment 
strategies.

Macrophages, the most abundant immune cells in many solid tumors, are no longer 
viewed solely as accomplices of cancer but as powerful therapeutic allies. This 
review charts the rapid rise of macrophage-based immunotherapies, from 
CD47/SIRPα checkpoint blockade and CAR-macrophages to macrophage-drug conjugates 
(MDCs). We emphasize emerging frontiers - RNA-based reprogramming, epigenetic 
modulation, small activating RNA and circRNA approaches, and macrophage-derived 
extracellular vesicles - that are redefining how tumor-associated macrophages 
can be targeted or harnessed. Distinct from earlier TAM reviews, we integrate 
outcomes from ongoing and completed clinical trials, highlight therapeutic 
platforms beyond classical depletion and polarization, and frame macrophages not 
only as targets but also as delivery vehicles. By spotlighting both innovative 
strategies and the challenges of moving them into the clinic, we aim to provide 
a forward-looking guide for researchers and clinicians shaping the next 
generation of cancer immunotherapy.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform cancer therapeutic 
decision-making by improving diagnostics and personalizing treatments. This 
review explores the current and future impact of AI in oncology, focusing on its 
applications in radiology, pathology, and the potential of Large Language Models 
(LLMs) in treatment selection. Despite significant advancements, AI integration 
into clinical workflows is limited due to challenges like data quality, model 
accuracy, and lack of validation through clinical trials. We propose key 
strategies to address these challenges, including developing robust multi-center 
datasets, promoting practical AI model development, researching workflow 
integration and human-AI collaboration, leveraging lessons from AI in medical 
imaging, establishing evaluation guidelines, and incentivizing prospective 
clinical trials. By implementing these strategies, AI can significantly enhance 
cancer care and patient outcomes, paving the way for its effective integration 
into oncology practice.

Gemcitabine resistance drives bladder cancer recurrence and progression. Using 
high-throughput drug screening in bladder cancer cells, we identified 
Bavachalcone (Bava) as a potent gemcitabine sensitizer. Mechanistically, Bava 
simultaneously targets transferrin receptor (TFRC) and epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR). It competes with transferrin (Tf) for TFRC binding, reducing 
cellular iron influx, and inhibits EGFR-mediated phosphorylation of TFRC at 
tyrosine 20 (Y20). These actions disrupt mitochondria iron utilization and 
impairs respiration. The combination of Bava and gemcitabine synergistically 
inhibits the repair of gemcitabine-induced DNA damage, while suppressing the 
iron-dependent ATR-CHEK1-E2F1 pathway and downregulating RRM1 expression. 
Patient-derived xenograft models confirmed the superior antitumor efficacy of 
the Bava-gemcitabine co-treatment compared to monotherapies. Clinically, 
elevated TFRC and RRM1 expression correlates with poor prognosis, supporting 
their utility as biomarkers of bladder cancer. Our study identified Bava as the 
first small-molecule TFRC inhibitor that overcomes gemcitabine resistance 
through iron modulation, providing both mechanistic insights and a promising 
therapeutic strategy for bladder cancer.

The human microbiome is now recognized as a central regulator of cancer biology, 
intricately shaping tumor development, immune dynamics, and therapeutic 
response. This comprehensive review delineates the multifaceted roles of 
bacteria, viruses, and fungi in modulating the tumor microenvironment and 
systemic immunity across diverse cancer types. We synthesize current evidence on 
how microbial dysbiosis promotes carcinogenesis via chronic inflammation, 
metabolic reprogramming, genotoxic stress, immune evasion, and epigenetic 
remodeling. This review emphasizes organ-specific microbiome signatures and 
highlights their potential as non-invasive biomarkers for early detection, 
treatment stratification, and prognosis. Furthermore, we explore the impact of 
intratumoral microbiota on cancer therapies, uncovering how microbial 
metabolites and host-microbe interactions shape therapeutic efficacy and 
resistance. Finally, advances in microbiome-targeted strategies, such as 
probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and engineered microbes offer new 
avenues for adjunctive cancer therapy. This review provides a roadmap for future 
investigation and underscores the transformative promise of microbiome 
modulation in cancer prevention and treatment.

PURPOSE: Mapping the colorectal cancer (CRC) patient pathway is needed to 
identify knowledge gaps and improve patient care. We aimed to understand the 
medical journey of patients and the role of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) in 
managing CRC in Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: A nationwide survey was administered to healthcare professionals (HCPs) 
in Saudi Arabia during August 1-September 15, 2024, to characterize typical 
patient profiles and CRC management.
RESULTS: Out of 33 responses, 28 were eligible, mostly were medical oncologists 
(96.4%) in tertiary healthcare settings (>85%) with 5-20 years of experience 
(78.6%). Most HCPs reported that patients had no or limited awareness of CRC 
(89.3%) and lacked access to support groups (71.4%). The guideline-recommended 
screening of individuals aged 45-75 years with no symptoms or a family history 
of CRC or polyps was only reported by 67.9% of respondents. Common screening 
methods were colonoscopy (89.3%) and fecal immunochemical test (53.6%). Major 
barriers to optimal CRC screening were patients' lack of awareness (92.9%) and 
challenges in accessing screening programs (75.0%). Gastroenterologists were the 
primary referrers to specialized centers and were responsible for diagnosing CRC 
(reported by 92.9% and 85.7%, respectively); 53.6% and 17.9% of respondents 
reported that surgical oncologists and an MDT also made the definitive 
diagnosis, respectively. Respondents identified the key MDT members taking care 
of patients with CRC as surgical (100.0%), medical (100.0%), radiation 
oncologists (92.9%), and pathologists (92.9%). Some MDTs involved other 
professionals, including radiologists (85.7%), clinical gastroenterologists 
(64.3%), dieticians (64.3%) and pharmacists (60.7%). The most common barrier to 
effective CRC treatment was delays in patient presentation (67.9%).
CONCLUSION: The results give clinicians and public bodies the opportunity to 
address critical factors for improving the outcomes for CRC patients in Saudi 
Arabia.

OBJECTIVES: To study the impact of the new MRI pathway and conventional 
transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic biopsies (TRUSGB) on anxiety and HRQoL 
in men with suspected PCa.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed of a randomized 
clinical trial including 626 biopsy-naïve patients. All patients underwent mpMRI 
and TRUSGB. Men with suspicious lesions on mpMRI underwent MRGB prior to TRUSGB. 
Anxiety was measured by State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Scale (STAI-6), 
completed at baseline, directly after mpMRI, MRGB, TRUSGB, after two/three 
weeks, and six months. HRQoL was measured by EuroQol (EQ-5D-5L), European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 
Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and Prostate Cancer Module (QLQ-PR25). Outcomes were compared 
between patients that underwent mpMRI and TRUSGB and patients that underwent 
mpMRI, MRGB and TRUSGB. Differences were considered relevant if the 95% 
confidence interval exceeded the minimal important clinical difference.
RESULTS: No relevant differences were seen in anxiety scores and generic HRQoL 
at different time points in patients that underwent mpMRI, TRUSGB and MRGB 
compared to patients that underwent mpMRI and TRUSGB. Patients that underwent 
mpMRI, MRGB and TRUSGB reported lower incontinence aid and hormonal 
treatment-related symptom scores after 6 months compared to patients that 
underwent mpMRI and TRUSGB.
CONCLUSIONS: In men suspected of PCa, no differences were observed in anxiety 
levels or generic HRQoL scores across different diagnostic pathways. However, 
lower PCa-specific HRQoL subscores were noted in patients who underwent mpMRI, 
MRGB and TRUSGB.

OBJECTIVES: To characterize patients diagnosed with prostate cancer (PC) in 
Finland in 2015-2019 and to follow-up the treatment patterns and healthcare 
resource use for patients with nonmetastatic PC (nmPC) and metastatic PC (mPC) 
until the end of 2020.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: PC cases were identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry 
and the Care Register for Health Care. Data on inpatient and outpatient 
diagnoses, outpatient medicine use and sociodemographics were sourced from 
nationwide registers. Data on Gleason scores and in-hospital medication were 
available for a subset of the patients.
RESULTS: In total, 25 045 men were diagnosed with PC in 2015-2019. The median 
age was 71 years, and 28% of these cases were considered as de novo mPC or 
progressed to mPC within one year from diagnosis. Of the whole cohort with PC, 
1368 (5.5%) died within one year (2.3% from PC). Altogether, 70% received active 
treatment within one year from diagnosis (nmPC cohort: 59%; mPC cohort: 97%). In 
the nmPC cohort, the most common treatments within the first year were 
radiotherapy (31%), androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (25%) and radical 
prostatectomy (25%). In the mPC cohort, ADT (92%), radiotherapy (38%) and 
first-generation antiandrogens bicalutamide or flutamide (22%) were the most 
common first-year treatments. The use of first-generation antiandrogens 
declined, and the use of second-generation antiandrogens increased towards the 
end of the study period. The total number of all-cause healthcare contacts per 
patient year was higher for mPC than for nmPC (61 vs. 29 contacts).
CONCLUSIONS: This large nationwide cohort study suggests that, in Finland, PC is 
generally diagnosed in the localized phase. As expected, the disease burden 
seems to be higher among men with metastatic disease. The estimated high 
proportion of patients with mPC at or soon after diagnosis should be interpreted 
with caution.

Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic modifiers such as lysine acetyltransferase 2A (KAT2A) 
have been reported to be the key regulators of gene expression in various 
cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). The transcriptomic effect of KAT2A 
deficiency in CRC and its implication on cancer-related pathways remains poorly 
elucidated.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this research was to investigate genome-wide 
transcriptional alterations induced by KAT2A knockout in colorectal cancer cells 
with an eye toward the recognition of putative molecular targets for diagnosis 
or therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: KAT2A-knockout HCT116 cell high-throughput RNA sequencing 
data (GSE246881) were analyzed. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
defined by DESeq2. Functional enrichment analysis, including Gene Ontology (GO) 
and KEGG pathways, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network building were 
performed using integrated bioinformatics tools.
RESULTS: KAT2A knockout resulted in 626 DEGs, predominantly downregulated, and 
indicated a potential role of KAT2A as a transcriptional activator. Enrichment 
analyses revealed significant involvement of cancer-related pathways such as 
MAPK and mTOR. PPI network analysis revealed key hub genes such as AKT1, VEGFA, 
and PLEC that are involved in tumor growth and may be future biomarkers or 
therapeutic targets.
CONCLUSION: KAT2A plays a pivotal role in oncogenic signaling pathways in CRC. 
The identified genes and pathways here present promising prospects for 
biotechnological application in cancer biomarker identification and targeted 
therapy, demonstrating the potential of KAT2A-centered regulatory networks in 
guiding CRC management strategies.

MiR-27a-3p Enhances Endometrial Cancer Growth and EMT by Targeting LIFR and 
Activating the p38/MAPK Pathways.

Zhumadian 463000, Henan, China.

BACKGROUND: MiR-27a-3p was linked to the growth, progression, and metastasis of 
many cancers; however, its role in endometrial cancer (EC) and the related 
mechanisms has not received as much research. Leukemia inhibitory factor 
receptor (LIFR) has been considered a prognostic and immune biomarker for EC. 
This work sought to determine if miR-27a-3p regulates LIFR in the malignant 
development of EC cells and to investigate the signaling pathways involved.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the function and 
mechanism of miR-27a-3p in the growth and EMT of EC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The TCGA database predicted the expression levels of 
miR-27a-3p and LIFR in the EC. The target Scan database, along with the dual 
luciferase experiment, confirmed the targeting link between miR-27a-3p and LIFR. 
The levels of miR-27a-3p and LIFR in normal human endometrial cells EEC and EC 
cells were identified using RT-qPCR and Western blot tests. After interfering 
with miR-27a-3p or LIFR level, EC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion 
capacities, as well as the expression levels of proteins involved in EMT and the 
p38/MAPK signaling pathways were examined to investigate the intrinsic mechanism 
of miR-27a-3p regulation of EC.
RESULTS: In EC cells, miR-27a-3p and LIFR were dramatically increased and 
decreased, respectively. miR-27a-3p targeting inhibited LIFR, further 
interfering with the p38/MAPK signaling pathway. Knocking down miR-27a-3p or 
overexpressing LIFR were efficient in suppressing the malignant biological 
characteristics and EMT of EC cells. Adding a p38/MAPK signaling pathway 
inhibitor partially decreases the influence of miR-27a-3p or LIFR on EC cells.
CONCLUSION: MiR-27a-3p activates the p38/MAPK signaling pathway by targeting 
LIFR down-regulation, promoting malignant biological behavior and EC cell EMT. 
This pathway may give ideas for EC clinical treatment.

DAPL1 Identified as a Novel Prognostic Biomarker in Breast Cancer: Insights from 
Comprehensive in Silico Analysis.

BACKGROUND: Characterizing tumor-associated gene expression variations in breast 
cancer is crucial for identifying molecular drivers and therapeutic targets, 
thereby advancing precision strategies for early detection, prognosis, and 
treatment optimization.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the oncogenic role of 
death-associated protein-like 1 (DAPL1) in breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed a bioinformatics approach to conduct a 
comprehensive analysis of DAPL1, including DNA methylation, genetic alterations, 
kinase analysis, immune cell infiltration, and signaling pathways. The breast 
cancer datasets from TCGA (the cancer genome atlas) and GEO (gene expression 
omnibus) were utilized.
RESULTS: DAPL1 is lowly expressed in breast cancer tissues compared to normal 
tissues. In the TCGA-BRCA (breast invasive carcinoma) cohort, we observed a 
correlation between low expression of DAPL1 and poor clinical prognosis 
regarding overall survival. Based on the survival data of GEO, the low DAPL1 
expression was associated with a poor prognosis of distant metastasis-free and 
relapse-free survival. Furthermore, DAPL1 expression was linked to the mutation 
status or copy number variation of several genes, such as MAP3K1 
(mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1), NUP98 (nucleoporin 98), and 
CCDC59 (coiled-coil domain containing 59). The infiltration level of immune 
cells (e.g., M1 macrophage, B cells, etc.) may be involved in the etiology of 
breast cancer. Based on the DAPL1-correlated genes, enrichment analysis data 
indicated the association between DAPL1 expression and a series of biological 
issues, such as ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Additionally, there were several 
potential DAPL1-associated phosphorylation kinases, including CDC2 (cell 
division cycle 2), MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases), and PKA (protein 
kinase A).
CONCLUSION: DAPL1 has been recognized as a prognostic biomarker in breast 
cancer. The molecular mechanisms may involve protein phosphorylation, immune 
cell infiltration, and several biological issues, especially protein 
ubiquitination.

Medical image foundation models have shown the ability to segment organs and 
tumors with minimal fine-tuning. These models are typically evaluated on 
task-specific in-distribution (ID) datasets. However, reliable performance on ID 
datasets does not guarantee robust generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) 
datasets. Importantly, once deployed for clinical use, it is impractical to have 
'ground truth' delineations to assess ongoing performance drifts, especially 
when images fall into the OOD category due to different imaging protocols. 
Hence, we introduced a comprehensive set of computationally fast metrics to 
evaluate the performance of multiple foundation models (Swin UNETR, SimMIM, 
iBOT, SMIT) trained with self-supervised learning (SSL). All models were 
fine-tuned on identical datasets for lung tumor segmentation from computed 
tomography (CT) scans. SimMIM, iBOT, and SMIT used identical architecture, 
pretraining, and fine-tuning datasets to assess performance variations with the 
choice of pretext tasks used in SSL. The evaluation was performed on two public 
lung cancer datasets (LRAD: n = 140, 5Rater: n = 21) with different image 
acquisitions and tumor stages compared to training data (n = 317 public resource 
with stage III-IV lung cancers) and a public non-cancer dataset containing 
volumetric CT scans of patients with pulmonary embolism (n = 120). All models 
produced similarly accurate tumor segmentation on the lung cancer testing 
datasets. SMIT produced the highest F1-score (LRAD: 0.60, 5Rater: 0.64) and 
lowest entropy (LRAD: 0.06, 5Rater: 0.12), indicating higher tumor detection 
rate and confident segmentations. In the OOD dataset, SMIT misdetected the least 
number of tumors, marked by a median volume occupancy of 5.67 cc compared to the 
best method SimMIM of 9.97 cc. Our analysis shows that additional metrics such 
as entropy and volume occupancy may help better understand model performance on 
mixed domain datasets.

INTRODUCTION: Travel distance is a key barrier for patients to participate in 
clinical trials or receive cancer care. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is a 
major funder of cancer research infrastructure through grant programs like the 
NCI Cancer Center (NCICC) and NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP); 
however, the majority of US sites that care for people with cancer do not 
directly receive this funding.
METHODS: Through geospatial analysis we examined patient distance to NCI-funded 
sites and evaluated demographic subgroups to identify potential disparities in 
access to research opportunities. We assessed whether new NCI support to 
previously unfunded sites could address identified barriers in access.
RESULTS: NCI-funded sites tend to be in urban centers and are less accessible to 
low-income or rural patients. Nearly 17% of the US population over 35 years old 
would have to drive over 100 miles to obtain care at an NCI-funded site; only 
1.6% would be beyond that distance when non-funded sites are added. For those 
below poverty level, the proportions are 20.2% and 1.9%, respectively. Several 
US regions, including the South and Appalachia, have particularly limited access 
to NCI-funded sites despite high cancer incidence, and much of the West and 
Great Plains are distant from any cancer facilities.
CONCLUSIONS: NCI could address travel distance as a major barrier to research 
participation by expanding the geographical footprint of its infrastructure 
funding using existing institutions in areas with identified gaps. Geospatial 
analysis at the census tract level is recommended and geospatial visualization 
can help identify strategic areas for interventions.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and cellular immunotherapy have 
revolutionized cancer treatment. Although these therapies have significantly 
improved cancer patients' survival, they are associated with a range of 
immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that can affect patients' quality of life. 
Neuromuscular complications related to cancer immunotherapy are rare (<5 % with 
monotherapy and up to 14 % with combination therapy), but they can be fatal if 
not addressed promptly. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial to 
improving the quality of life and survival of cancer patients affected by 
neuromuscular complications associated with immunotherapy. However, symptoms can 
be diverse and nonspecific, including weakness, numbness, imbalance, dysarthria, 
dysphagia, and even difficulty in breathing, which presents significant 
challenges for diagnosis and management. This review summarizes the current 
understanding of the mechanisms, clinical features, diagnostic challenges, and 
management strategies for neuromuscular complications related to cancer 
immunotherapy. Understanding the complex interplay between T cells, B cells, and 
cytokines in the pathogenesis of neuromuscular irAEs is essential for guiding 
their management. It is important for healthcare providers, including 
oncologists, neurologists, primary care physicians, and other practitioners, to 
be familiar with the multidisciplinary clinical management of neuromuscular 
irAEs. This knowledge will help reduce the mortality and morbidity associated 
with these complications.

BACKGROUND: Tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS), ectopic lymphoid aggregates 
formed in response to chronic inflammation, have emerged as potential prognostic 
biomarkers and mediators of anti-tumor immunity in various cancers. However, the 
heterogeneity of TLS spatial distribution, maturity, and their prognostic and 
immunological significance in prostate cancer (PCa) remain poorly characterized.
METHODS: We utilized immunohistochemistry, multispectral fluorescence 
immunohistochemistry (mIHC) and spatial multi-omics analyses to evaluate the 
heterogeneity of TLS and its relationship with immune components in the tumor 
microenvironment (TME). Prognostic implications were assessed in 701 PCa 
patients from the TCGA and Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center cohorts. The 
association between TLS heterogeneity and immunoreactivity was assessed through 
the quantification of immune cell infiltration. CellTreck and robust cell type 
decomposition deconvolution algorithms were used to decipher the colocalization 
features of each cell, cell-cell communication and ligand-receptor features 
within TLS regions.
RESULTS: In PCa, TLSs were detected in approximately 20 % of patients across 
both cohorts, with intratumoral TLS (intra-TLS) being twice as prevalent as 
peritumoral TLS (peri‑TLS). Patients harboring intra-TLS exhibited significantly 
longer disease-free and progression-free survival. Compared to peri‑TLS, 
intra-TLS were more mature, characterized by increased T-effector cell 
infiltration, activation of interferon pathways, and the presence of follicular 
dendritic cell centers and B cell aggregates. Notably, compared with immature 
TLS, mature TLS were markedly associated with reduced PD-L1 expression, lower 
regulatory T cells (Tregs) infiltration, and increased high endothelial venules 
(HEVs) density, indicative of an immunologically active microenvironment. 
Spatial multi-omics analysis revealed that mature TLS exhibited enriched immune 
cell diversity and HEVs density, suggesting enhanced anti-tumor immunity. 
Furthermore, cell-cell communication analysis identified significant 
interactions between CCL5+ dendritic cells and ACKR1+ activated B cells within 
mature TLS, reflecting the enhanced capacity of mature TLS to orchestrate robust 
antigen presentation and B-cell-driven immune responses.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study highlights the prognostic and 
immunological implications of TLS heterogeneity in PCa, demonstrating that the 
spatial distribution and maturity of TLSs are closely linked to TME activation 
and improved clinical outcomes. These findings provide novel insights into the 
immune landscape of PCa and establish a foundation for immune-based precision 
stratification and therapeutic development.

Prostate cancer in China: epidemiological trends, genomic insights, and future 
directions for optimized management.

The incidence and mortality of prostate cancer (PCa) in China have risen sharply 
in recent years, posing an escalating public health concern. In contrast to 
Western populations, Chinese patients are more frequently diagnosed at advanced 
stages, often with metastatic disease and suboptimal survival outcomes. These 
disparities reflect intrinsic differences in epidemiological patterns, molecular 
landscapes, and healthcare delivery systems unique to the Chinese context. 
Nevertheless, prevailing PCa management paradigms, largely derived from 
Western-centric evidence, remain inadequately calibrated to the biological and 
clinical realities of Chinese patients. This review provides a comprehensive 
synthesis of the epidemiology, genomic alterations, clinical presentations, and 
treatment disparities of PCa in China, highlighting the urgent need for 
population-specific strategies. Priority areas include the development of 
ethnically optimized screening protocols, the integration of precision medicine 
approaches, and the implementation of regionally adapted prevention and early 
detection programs. Furthermore, expanding participation in clinical trials and 
accelerating translational research efforts, particularly in multi-omics and 
biomarker discovery, will be critical to bridging current gaps. By aligning 
emerging scientific innovations with localized healthcare needs, China holds the 
potential to reshape its prostate cancer care paradigm, improving outcomes, 
reducing disparities, and contributing to the global advancement of precision 
oncology.

OBJECTIVE: Focal therapy (FT) is a potential treatment option for limited-volume 
clinically-significant prostate cancer (csPCa). However, despite rigorous 
selection, approximately 20% of patients experience early failure. We 
investigated the association of transcriptomic profiles and csPCa recurrence 
post-FT.
METHODS: 52 men from a phase II trial (NCT04138914) and a prospective 
observational cohort underwent focal cryotherapy for csPCa. Patients underwent 
multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, and targeted and 
systematic-saturation biopsy before- and 1-year post-FT. Recurrence was defined 
as grade-group (GG) ≥2 cancer in the 1-year post-FT biopsy. Pre-treatment 
lesions were profiled using the Decipher genomic classifier (GC). GC scores, 
luminal-basal status, tumor microenvironment and cancer hallmark pathways were 
correlated with csPCa recurrence.
RESULTS: Median PSA was 7.0 ng/dl; 37/52 (71.1%) men had GG2, 12/52 (23.1%) GG3, 
and 3/52 (5.8%) GG4 cancer. Recurrence was observed in 9/52 (17.3%) men. Median 
GC score was higher in patients with recurrence (0.60 vs 0.38, P = 0.014) and 
remained significantly associated with recurrence after adjustment for GG 
(adjusted OR: 1.37 [95% CI: 1.01-1.93], P = 0.04). Luminal-proliferative tumors 
based on the prostate cancer-specific subtyping classifier (PSC) had more csPCa 
recurrence compared with luminal-differentiated (LD) and basal subtypes (30.4% 
vs 0% [LD] vs 15.4% [basal-neuroendocrine] and 14.3% [basal-immune], P = 0.027). 
Higher expression of DNA repair pathway was also associated with recurrence (OR: 
2.12 [95% CI: 1.09-4.57], P = 0.025).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher GC score is associated with risk of csPCa recurrence 
post-FT. Patients with GC low-risk and PSC-LD csPCa may represent the ideal 
subgroup for FT. Prospective validation in a large cohort is warranted.

With the rapid progression of chemotherapies, the occurrence of chemoresistance 
is becoming a major obstacle in contemporary cancer treatment. As essential 
organelles, mitochondria perform diverse functions to provide ATP and various 
intermediates to modulate biosynthetic and bioenergetic processes, which are 
indispensable to cell survival. Recently, mitochondria have increasingly 
intrigued researchers for their unique influence on chemoresistance. This review 
explores the intricate relationship between mitochondria and chemoresistance. We 
delve into the complex roles that mitochondria play in chemoresistance, focusing 
on the aberrant alterations in mitochondrial behaviors and interactions with 
other organelles. We also review the subsequent impact of mitochondrial changes 
on cellular functions, such as metabolic reprogramming and the dysregulation of 
cell death. By presenting a retrospective analysis of previous research and 
elucidating the underlying mechanisms, we aim to reveal the potential of 
enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapies and overcoming cancer chemoresistance 
by targeting mitochondria. Hopefully, this review will provide directions for 
future research and the development of more viable drugs, ultimately improving 
the prognosis of cancer patients.

OBJECTIVE: Ozone (O3) is recognized as a predominant and increasingly prevalent 
gaseous pollutant contributing to the Global Burden of Disease. However, its 
effect on the development of lung cancer has not been adequately acknowledged.
METHODS: Based on Health Evaluation And risk Reduction through nationwide 
Teamwork (ChinaHEART), a nationwide, population-based cohort study, 2,006,878 
participants living in 20,159 communities or villages were passively followed 
for the incidence of lung cancer through a linkage of data with the National 
Central Cancer Registry. The average O3 levels over ten years from the year of 
enrolment in their respective localities were determined based on geographic 
coordinates. We conducted Cox proportional-hazards regression models to assess 
the independent hazard ratios (HRs) associated with O3 exposure and the 
development of lung cancer.
RESULTS: During the follow-up of 4.93 million person-years, 4555 new cases of 
lung cancer were identified. After adjusting for participant characteristics and 
other environmental factors, we observed a significant positive association 
between ambient O3 exposure and lung cancer. Compared with participants in the 
quartile 1 of O3, HRs and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the other three 
quartiles were 1.09 (95 % CI: 1.00-1.17), 1.17 (95 % CI: 1.06-1.29) and 1.42 (95 
% CI: 1.26-1.59), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term exposure to ambient O3 is associated with a substantially 
higher risk of lung cancer. Further studies are needed to explore its pathogenic 
mechanisms, as well as to evaluate measures for exposure protection or harm 
mitigation at the individual or population level.

BACKGROUND: Circadian disruption has emerged as a significant risk factor for 
cancer, driven by mechanisms such as hormonal imbalances, impaired DNA repair, 
immune suppression, and metabolic dysregulation. Modern societal patterns-shift 
work, artificial light at night, and irregular sleep schedules-have exacerbated 
these risks.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, screening over 500 
studies published between 2003 and 2023 from PubMed, Scopus, Embase, 
ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria focused on peer-reviewed 
epidemiological and mechanistic studies linking circadian disruption with cancer 
risk. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for methodological quality assessment.
RESULTS: A total of 75 high-quality studies were included. Strong evidence 
supports associations between circadian disruption and breast, prostate, and 
colorectal cancers, with limited but emerging evidence for melanoma and bladder 
cancer. Mechanistic pathways involve melatonin suppression, dysregulation of 
CLOCK and BMAL1 genes, reduced natural killer cell activity, and chronic 
inflammation due to metabolic imbalance. Light-at-night (LAN) exposure and 
prolonged night shift work were consistently identified as major risk factors. 
Furthermore, economic analyses reveal a substantial burden due to increased 
healthcare costs and productivity losses, particularly in shift work-dominated 
sectors.
CONCLUSIONS: Circadian misalignment is a critical, yet often overlooked, 
contributor to cancer incidence and associated economic burdens. Public health 
strategies-such as regulating shift schedules, reducing LAN exposure, and 
promoting chronotherapy-are essential to mitigate these risks. Further research 
should address sex-based differences, improve exposure measurement, and extend 
investigations to low- and middle-income countries.

Breast cancer cell lines are indispensable tools for unraveling disease 
mechanisms, enabling drug discovery, and developing personalized treatments, yet 
their heterogeneity and inconsistent classification pose significant challenges 
in model selection and data reproducibility. This review aims at providing a 
comprehensive and user-friendly framework for broadly mapping the features of 
breast cancer types and commercially available human breast cancer cell lines, 
defining absolute criteria, i.e., objective features such as origin (e.g., 
MDA-MB, MCF), histological subtype (ductal, lobular), hormone receptor status 
(ER/PR/HER2), and genetic mutations (BRCA1, TP53), and relative criteria, which 
contextualize functional behaviors such as metastatic potential, drug 
sensitivity, and genomic instability. It then examines how the proposed 
framework could be applied to cell line screening in advanced and emerging 
disease models. By supporting better informed choices, this work aims to improve 
experimental design and strengthen the connection between in vitro breast cancer 
studies and their clinical translation.

Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease with diverse clinical outcomes 
and treatment responses. While traditional molecular subtypes have improved 
patient stratification, they fail to fully capture the immune heterogeneity that 
influences tumor progression and therapy efficacy. Cytokines play a central role 
in regulating immune responses within the tumor microenvironment, yet their 
systematic profiling in breast cancer remains unexplored. Here we conducted a 
comprehensive analysis of cytokine expression across breast cancer patients 
using transcriptomic and clinical data. Prognostic cytokines were identified via 
survival analysis, and a cytokine-based molecular classification was established 
through consensus clustering. We identified three cytokine-driven breast cancer 
subtypes with distinct transcriptional profiles, immune infiltration patterns, 
and clinical outcomes. A cytokine-derived risk score was then developed using 
lasso regression and validated in external datasets to assess its predictive 
power for patient survival and treatment response. We then characterized the 
immune microenvironment of patients with different risk scores using immune 
infiltration analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. The risk 
score effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups, with 
significant differences in survival outcomes. The low-risk subtype exhibited 
enhanced immune cell infiltration and stronger immune cell interactions, while 
the high-risk subtype was associated with an immunosuppressive microenvironment 
and a worse prognosis. Notably, patients with low-risk scores demonstrated 
superior responses to both immunotherapy and chemotherapy, highlighting the 
clinical relevance of cytokine-based classification. Our study provides the 
first comprehensive cytokine-based molecular subtyping of breast cancer, 
revealing distinct immune landscapes and prognostic implications. The 
cytokine-derived risk score offers a powerful tool for predicting patient 
survival and treatment response, with potential applications in personalized 
medicine and immunotherapy strategies. These findings underscore the critical 
role of cytokines in shaping breast cancer heterogeneity and highlight their 
value as biomarkers for therapeutic decision-making.

After focal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for prostate cancer, 
evidence on the safety of hydrogel spacer placement remains limited. A 
65-year-old man who had undergone focal HIFU for low-risk localized prostate 
cancer two years earlier presented with local recurrence (prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) 6.5 ng/mL, rT1cN0M0, Gleason scores 4+3 and 3+4) and was referred 
for salvage radiation therapy. Hydrogel spacer placement was planned before 
radiation therapy. The patient was placed in the lithotomy position under sacral 
block and local anesthesia, and the procedure was performed under transrectal 
ultrasound guidance. Using a transperineal approach, saline was injected into 
the dorsal aspect of Denonvilliers' fascia for hydrodissection, during which 
moderate tissue resistance was noted. However, no significant adhesions were 
identified, and adequate separation between the prostate and rectum was 
achieved. The hydrogel spacer was then successfully inserted without 
procedure-related complications. External beam radiation therapy (60 Gy in 20 
fractions) was completed without early adverse events. This case demonstrates 
that salvage radiation therapy with hydrogel spacer placement can be safely 
performed in patients with prostate cancer previously treated with focal HIFU.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as a promising treatment for 
metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), particularly in programmed 
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive tumors. However, their use is associated with 
immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including hepatotoxicity, which, although 
rare, can be severe and challenging to diagnose. We present the case of a 
59-year-old woman with metastatic TNBC who developed immune-related liver 
toxicity following 14 cycles of atezolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel. 
The patient presented with jaundice, pruritus, and transaminitis. Liver biopsy 
revealed nonspecific findings, including interface hepatitis and early fibrosis, 
without features definitive for sclerosing cholangitis. A comprehensive workup 
excluded viral, autoimmune, and other drug-induced causes. Based on clinical 
timing, exclusion of alternative etiologies, and histopathologic correlation, a 
diagnosis of ICI-induced hepatitis was made. The patient responded well to 
corticosteroid therapy with budesonide, showing gradual improvement in liver 
enzyme levels. This case underscores the importance of maintaining a high index 
of suspicion for immune-related hepatotoxicity in patients receiving ICIs, 
especially those with underlying liver conditions, and highlights the need for 
timely diagnosis and individualized immunosuppressive treatment.

BACKGROUND: Breast density significantly reduces the sensitivity of mammography, 
complicating early cancer detection. Ultrasound has emerged as a supplemental 
imaging modality, especially valuable in women with dense breasts.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate and compare the diagnostic performance, 
including sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy, of ultrasound and 
mammography in detecting breast cancer among women with radiographically dense 
breast tissue (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories C 
and D).
METHODS:  This prospective, comparative observational study was conducted at 
Family Health Hospital, Islamabad, Pakistan, from June 2023 to January 2024. A 
total of 240 female patients (mean age 48.6 ± 9.2 years; range 30-70) were 
enrolled. Of these, 142 (59.2%) had heterogeneously dense breasts (BI-RADS C) 
and 98 (40.8%) had extremely dense breasts (BI-RADS D). Mammography included 
standard two-view digital imaging (craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique), 
interpreted by radiologists using the BI-RADS classification system.
RESULTS:  Out of 240 patients, 68 (28.3%) were histologically confirmed to have 
breast cancer. Ultrasound showed a sensitivity of 85.3% (58/68) and specificity 
of 88.4% (152/172), while mammography demonstrated a sensitivity of 61.8% 
(42/68) and specificity of 91.9% (158/172). Sensitivity analysis by breast 
density revealed that mammography performed better in heterogeneously dense 
breasts (77.8% (14/18)) but dropped markedly in extremely dense breasts (43.8% 
(28/64)). Ultrasound maintained high sensitivity across both groups (86.1% 
(31/36) in BI-RADS C and 84.4% (27/32) in BI-RADS D). The area under the 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.89 for ultrasound and 
0.78 for mammography.
CONCLUSION: It is concluded that ultrasound significantly improves breast cancer 
detection in women with dense breasts compared to mammography alone.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers globally and a leading 
cause of cancer-related deaths. Over the past decade, our understanding of CRC 
has significantly evolved, particularly in the areas of genomic prognostication 
and targeted therapies. However, surgical management beyond the initial 
resection of the primary tumor remains an area of ongoing discussion and 
research. We report a case of a 51-year-old man with metastatic CRC and liver 
metastases, treated with right hemicolectomy and chemotherapy, achieving 
complete remission. Two years later, he developed an isolated subcutaneous 
recurrence at the prior surgical drain site. Microsatellite instability status 
changed from primary to recurrent lesions. Surgical resection achieved negative 
margins, and the patient has since remained disease-free without additional 
therapy. This rare presentation challenges traditional models of CRC metastasis 
and highlights the potential role of lymphatic dissemination, tumor dormancy, or 
surgical seeding.

BACKGROUND: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is a 
pivotal transcription factor that plays a dual role in cancer biology. It 
behaves as a tumor suppressor and, under certain conditions, as a promoter. Few 
studies have analyzed STAT1 in pan-cancers and explored its role in cancer 
biology. This study aimed to investigate the expression of STAT1 across various 
cancers at different stages. Additionally, we examined the promoter methylation 
of STAT1 and its impact on STAT1 expression, evaluated the functional states of 
STAT1 in different cancer types, analyzed the correlation between STAT1 
expression and survival prognosis, and studied the tumor immune infiltration. 
Furthermore, we analyzed STAT1 expression across diverse immune subsets in 
cancer. Subsequently, we conducted an analysis of STAT1-protein interactions and 
studied the cancer hallmarks of STAT1 and its related proteins.
METHODS: Various bioinformatics tools (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive 
Analysis (GEPIA), Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), University of 
Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Data Analysis Portal (UALCAN), Kaplan-Meier 
Plotter, StarBase, Enrichr, and Tumor and Immune System Interaction 
Database (TISIDB)) and databases (Cancer Single-cell State Atlas (CancerSEA) and 
Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING)) were used 
in this study. We comprehensively investigated STAT1 protein expression across 
various types of cancer and the correlation between its expression and different 
tumor stages, DNA methylation, survival outcomes, and immune cell infiltration. 
Additionally, we examined the correlation between STAT1 expression and various 
immune subtypes of cancer, as well as the functional states of STAT1 in 
different cancer types. Moreover, we investigated the STAT1 protein interactions 
and cancer hallmarks of STAT1 and its related proteins.
RESULTS: High STAT1 expression was found in 21 cancers and was differentially 
expressed across different clinical tumor stages and promoter methylation 
levels. In addition, we found that high expression correlated with better 
overall survival in some tumors, whereas it correlated with worse overall 
survival in other tumor types. Furthermore, the expression of STAT1 was 
associated with the level of immune infiltration in multiple tumors and 
different immune subtypes. We found that STAT1 expression had dual correlations 
(positive and negative) with different functional states in tumors, including 
angiogenesis and apoptosis. STAT1 protein interaction and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses revealed that 10 STAT1-interacting 
proteins were significantly enriched in cancer-related pathways.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that STAT1 may serve as a potential diagnostic 
and prognostic marker for several cancer types.

Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy is increasingly used in early-stage non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and has demonstrated improved pathological response 
rates. However, radiological progression following treatment may result in 
potentially curative surgery being withheld. We report the case of a 75-year-old 
male with a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the right lower lobe lung 
adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant carboplatin, paclitaxel, and nivolumab. 
Post-treatment CT scan showed radiological progression. The patient underwent 
video-assisted thoracoscopic right lower lobectomy with posterior segmentectomy. 
Histopathological examination revealed a complete pathological response with no 
viable tumor and no nodal involvement. This case highlights the importance of 
recognizing pseudoprogression in the neoadjuvant setting.

Stroke-like migraine attacks after radiation therapy (SMART) syndrome is a rare 
and delayed side effect of cranial irradiation. It can appear after many years 
following radiation therapy and is characterised by temporary, stroke-like 
neurological deficits such as hemiparesis, seizures, aphasia, sensory 
abnormalities, and headaches. Although the condition is self-limiting, it can 
pose a difficulty in diagnosis due to its symptoms coinciding with other 
neurological disorders. We report a case of a 63-year-old male with a diagnosis 
of oligodendroglioma for which he had previously received cranial irradiation in 
2015. He presented to the emergency room in 2025, 10 years later, with an 
abrupt-onset weakness in his left upper and lower limbs. Acute causes like 
infection, stroke, and seizures were ruled out through investigations. The 
patient's history, clinical presentation, and radiological exclusion of other 
pathologies led to the diagnosis of SMART syndrome. Verapamil was prescribed as 
migraine prophylaxis, and neurology follow-up was part of the treatment plan. At 
the subsequent follow-up, it was reported that the clinical condition was 
showing gradual improvement. Patients with a history of cranial irradiation and 
temporary focal neurological symptoms should be evaluated for SMART syndrome, 
especially when other acute pathologies are excluded, as early detection can 
help avoid needless interventions and guide appropriate management.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks among the most common 
cancers worldwide. One of the most severe postoperative complications is an 
anastomotic leakage (AL). The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of 
AL on the long-term oncologic outcome.
METHODS: All patients who underwent curative surgery for CRC at the Department 
of Surgery at the University Hospital in Mannheim between January 2011 and June 
2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoint was the overall 
survival (OS).
RESULTS: Between January 2011 and June 2016, a total of 504 patients were 
included in the study. The median follow-up was 42 months. We found an AL 
incidence of 11.1% (n = 56) with the following risk factors: age ≤ 65 (p = 0.03) 
and location of the tumor in the rectum, especially mid-rectum (p = 0.012). 
Patients with AL were less likely to have adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.002). AL 
had no significant impact on the OS (p = 0.09). Patients with AL had a 
significantly higher 90-day mortality (p = 0.002), whereas there was no 
significant impact on local or distant recurrence.
CONCLUSION: In our cohort, age ≤ 65 and a cancer location in the mid-rectum were 
risk factors for AL. However, our results did not demonstrate a significant 
influence of AL on the oncological long-term outcome.

Postoperative Outcomes in Esophageal Cancer Patients After Esophagectomy: A 
Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.

Esophageal cancer is a major global health issue, with high incidence, 
morbidity, and mortality rates. Esophagectomy is a common treatment option; 
however, it may lead to multiple postoperative complications, which carry 
significant risks for patients' nutritional and immunological status. While 
adequate nutritional support has been postulated to play a significant role in 
reducing postoperative morbidity and mortality in esophageal cancer patients, no 
consensus has been reached regarding the optimal approach. We have conducted 
this meta-analysis in an attempt to bridge this gap by assessing the effects of 
enteral nutrition (EN) versus parenteral nutrition (PN) on postoperative 
recovery and outcomes in these esophageal cancer patients following 
esophagectomy. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Scholar, 
and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted from inception 
till March 12, 2025. Our inclusion criteria were: (i) randomized controlled 
trials; (ii) esophageal cancer patients post-esophagectomy; (iii) EN only 
compared to PN only; (iv) nutrition started on the first postoperative day with 
no preoperative EN or PN; and (v) outcomes should include at least one of the 
following: postoperative nutritional status, immunological status, total 
postoperative complications, pulmonary complications, anastomotic leakage, 
postoperative hospital stay, and mortality. The meta-analysis included six 
studies with a total of 276 patients. Patients who received EN experienced a 
greater decrease in albumin levels at POD 7 from baseline (MD 0.12, 95% CI 
[0.00, 0.25], P = 0.05) compared to patients who received PN. EN was linked to a 
more pronounced decrease in bilirubin levels at POD 7 from baseline compared to 
PN (MD -0.69, 95% CI [-1.12, -0.26], P = 0.002). Patients who received PN also 
had a higher incidence of pulmonary complications (RR 0.46, 95% CI [0.21, 1.00], 
P = 0.05), total postoperative complications (RR 0.73, 95% CI [0.54, 0.98], P = 
0.04) and longer hospital stays (MD -3.91, 95% CI [-4.72, -3.09], P<0.00001). No 
significant differences were found in prealbumin level changes (MD 0, 95% CI 
[-0.27, 0.27], CRP levels (MD -1.35, 95% CI [-3.34, 0.64], P = 0.18), total 
protein levels (MD 0.10, 95% CI [-0.04, 0.24], P = 0.15) anastomotic leakage 
incidence (RR 1.17, 95% CI [0.39, 3.46], P = 0.78) or mortality (RR 1.59, 95% CI 
[0.22, 11.60], P = 0.64). EN and PN appear to have distinct effects on 
esophageal cancer patients after esophagectomy. While EN could result in a 
significant decrease in albumin levels postoperatively when compared to PN, it 
is associated with better control of bilirubin levels, a lower incidence of 
pulmonary and total postoperative complications, and shorter hospital stays. The 
potential benefits of EN may outweigh its risks. The use of EN compared to PN 
must be evaluated on an individual basis for each patient. Finally, further 
research is recommended to explore the reasons behind some outcomes such as the 
lack of significant differences in pre-albumin levels, total protein levels, CRP 
levels, anastomotic leakage, and mortality.

Graft rejection is the major challenge that solid organ transplant recipients 
face. As a consequence, lung cancer patients of this population have been 
consistently excluded from clinical trials involving the use of immunotherapy 
agents due to the increased risk of graft rejection. Tarlatamab is a novel 
bi-specific T-cell recruiter monoclonal antibody targeting delta-like ligand 3 
(DLL3) on cancer cells and CD3 on T-cells; hence, it is theoretically much safer 
than other checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy agents that boost T-cells 
non-specifically. Tarlatamab received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approval in 2024 for the treatment of adults with extensive-stage small-cell 
lung cancer (ES-SCLC) that has progressed on or after platinum-based 
chemotherapy. Here, we report safe treatment of an extensive-stage small-cell 
lung cancer patient with an orthotopic heart transplant with tarlatamab. The 
patient received four doses between April and June 2025 without evidence of 
graft rejection or dysfunction. As of August 2025, the patient continues 
treatment without any adverse events.

Zinc transporter 8 antibody (ZnT8A) is a key serological marker of type 1 
diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Cases of ZnT8A single positivity are relatively rare. 
This study aimed to investigate a case of ZnT8A single-positive T1DM in a 
51-year-old woman who developed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) during chemotherapy 
for colorectal cancer. She had normoglycemia 15 months prior to the 
presentation. During chemotherapy with intermittent corticosteroid 
administration, she developed DKA, which required intensive insulin therapy. 
Although she was negative for glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA), 
insulinoma-associated antigen-2 antibody (IA-2A), and insulin autoantibody 
(IAA), she was positive for ZnT8A. The HLA typing results revealed homozygosity 
for DRB1*04:06 and DQB1*03:02. At the 6-month follow-up after the initial 
diagnosis, endogenous insulin secretion remained partially preserved, suggesting 
an atypical course; the differential diagnosis between acute-onset T1DM with a 
honeymoon phase and an acute exacerbation of slowly progressive type 1 diabetes 
mellitus (SPIDDM) remained challenging. Although ZnT8A single-positive T1DM is a 
relatively uncommon clinical subtype, it should be considered in clinical 
practice. Previous studies indicated a predominance of acute-onset T1DM in such 
cases, and even in patients with SPIDDM or an uncertain subtype, there appears 
to be a potential risk of developing DKA as demonstrated in the present case. 
Furthermore, given the potential association between ZnT8A positivity and a more 
rapid deterioration of endogenous insulin secretion, an early assessment of the 
ZnT8A levels is important when T1DM is suspected.

Hyperglycemia is a well-recognized adverse event associated with capivasertib, 
an oral AKT inhibitor, and may occasionally progress to serious conditions such 
as diabetic ketoacidosis. We report the case of a 73-year-old woman with hormone 
receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic 
breast cancer who developed marked hyperglycemia shortly after initiating 
capivasertib therapy. Marked hyperglycemia was observed on day 11 of treatment, 
despite normal baseline levels. Capivasertib was temporarily discontinued, and 
insulin therapy was initiated. Continuous glucose monitoring revealed transient 
hyperglycemic episodes occurring exclusively on dosing days, which resolved 
within approximately 12 h. This pattern suggests a pharmacodynamic correlation 
and reversible effect of capivasertib on glucose metabolism. Rapid-acting 
insulin was required only on days when capivasertib was administered. Notably, 
standard hemoglobin A1c monitoring failed to capture these fluctuations. This 
case underscores the importance of real-time glucose monitoring and 
individualized glycemic management during capivasertib therapy, particularly in 
patients with metabolic risk factors. Early detection and tailored intervention 
may help prevent severe hyperglycemic complications and facilitate the safe 
continuation of treatment.

cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of comparative safety and 
efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) poses a major threat to human health. Since the 
beginning of the 21st century, numerous clinical studies conducted in China have 
reported the therapeutic advantages of combining Chinese herbal injections 
(CHIs) with chemotherapy; however, comparative evaluations of different CHIs 
remain scarce. This multidimensional network meta-analysis was designed to 
compare the efficacy of various CHIs and to identify the optimal combination 
regimen of CHI plus chemotherapy for breast cancer treatment.
METHODS: By searching multiple databases, we screened randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) on Chinese herbal injections (CHIs) combined with chemotherapy 
interventions for breast cancer (BC) from database inception to 25 October 2024. 
Studies meeting inclusion criteria with methodologically sound quality were 
included. Data analysis was performed using Stata 17.0 and R 4.2.1 software, 
with odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) as effect size 
measures. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) method was 
applied to rank the evaluated treatment regimens.
RESULTS: This network meta-analysis included 44 eligible RCTs, involving 3,982 
patients and 8 CHIs. Shenqifuzheng Injection (SQFZ) combined with chemotherapy 
was most effective in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy, improving the 
quality of life of breast cancer patients, ameliorating the CD4+/CD8+ T-cell 
ratio, and inhibiting the decrease in white blood cell (WBC) count after 
chemotherapy. Compound Sophora Injection (FFKS) combined with chemotherapy 
performed best in increasing post - chemotherapy CD4+ and CD8+, lowering tumor 
marker CA125, and reducing post-chemotherapy platelet (PLT) and hemoglobin (HGB) 
declines. Kangai Injection (KA) combined with chemotherapy was most effective 
for CD3+ improvement. Kanglaite Injection (KLT) combined with chemotherapy had 
the best effect on reducing tumor markers CEA and CA153. Although a 2021 network 
meta-analysis (Comparative Efficacy and Safety of Chinese Herbal Injections 
Combined With Cyclophosphamide and 5-Fluorouracil Chemotherapies in Treatment of 
Breast Cancer: A Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis) examined chemotherapy combined 
with Chinese medicine injections for breast cancer, it was limited to the CF 
regimen and assessed few outcomes, with some lower-quality studies included 
(excluded herein). Our study improves methodology by incorporating high-quality 
RCTs across all chemotherapy regimens and evaluating multiple outcomes. This 
provides more comprehensive results, identifying SQFZ as most effective for 
improving response rate and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), thereby 
enhancing clinical utility.

INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer, the third most common cancer worldwide, is 
primarily caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. This study aimed to 
develop natural extracts from the seeds of Carica papaya L. using the 
hydrodistillation method to evaluate their anticancer effects against HeLa 
cells.
METHODS: The phytochemical composition of Carica papaya seeds' essential oil was 
identified using gas chromatography mass spectrometry, and their cytotoxicity on 
proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle phases, migration, and colony formation of 
HeLa cancer cell lines was examined. Moreover, the effects of essential oil on 
the protein expression levels related to apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and 
migration in the treated HeLa cells were examined.
RESULT AND DISCUSSION: The essential oil's phytochemical composition was 
analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), revealing benzyl 
isothiocyanate as the dominant compound (99.49%). Results demonstrated that the 
essential oil had a high cytotoxic effect, with an IC50 value of 16.78 µg/mL in 
the MTT assay. Apoptosis analysis indicated a significant increase in early and 
late apoptotic HeLa cells (23.45%). Flow cytometry revealed a G2/M phase arrest, 
which impeded cell division. The oil also exhibited a stronger inhibition of 
cancer cell migration (38.7%) than methotrexate (45.9%). Additionally, the 
clonogenic assay revealed a drastic reduction in colony formation (0.004% 
surviving fraction, 0.25% plating efficiency). ELISA results showed a profound 
effect on apoptosis-related proteins, reducing BCL-2, MMP-2, and CDK1/cyclin B1 
expression, supported by molecular docking studies comparing its efficacy to 
methotrexate (-5.52, -6.29, and -5.75 vs -5.49, -5.44, and 5.18 kcal mol-, 
respectively). The findings suggest that Carica papaya seed essential oil may 
serve as a potential anticancer treatment for cervical cancer; however, further 
in vivo studies are required for validation in animal models.

OBJECTIVES: This study used a combination of in silico and in-vitro 
methodologies to evaluate the breast cancer (BC) fighting efficacy of 
Chamazulene.
METHODS: In silico analyses utilized Protox-3.0 for toxicity prediction, 
SuperPred and GeneCards for target identification, and Jvenn for intersection. 
Protein-protein interactions were mapped with STRING and visualised in 
Cytoscape, followed by Cytohubba to pinpoint hub genes. Gene-ontology and 
KEGG-pathway enrichment were performed via DAVID and visualized with SRplot. 
Immune infiltration was assessed using TIMER, while UALCAN evaluated expression, 
promoter methylation, survival, and correlation. The MTT, clonogenic, EdU, 
Annexin-V/PI, cell cycle, wound healing, and Western-blotting were used to 
measure cytotoxicity and the mechanism of chamazulene in MDA-MB-231 cells.
RESULTS: In silico analyses indicated a safe toxicity profile and identified 
53-overlapping target genes, resulting in a highly enriched PPI network. The 
network identified the three main hub genes: NFKB1, MAPK14, and GRB2. Enrichment 
analysis indicated participation in different pathways, including MAPK and HIF-1 
signalling pathways. The TIMER and UALCAN investigations on BC revealed 
significant immune infiltration, altered gene expression, hypomethylation, and 
survival trends. MTT studies demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in cancer 
cell viability, exceeding 50% at elevated doses. Clonogenic and EdU assays 
indicated reduced proliferation and DNA-synthesis, whereas apoptosis and cell 
cycle analyses revealed elevated cell mortality and G2/M-phase arrest. Western 
blotting revealed a downregulation of NFKB1, GRB2 and MAPK14, while wound 
healing assays suggested reduced migration.
CONCLUSION: Chamazulene exhibits multifaceted and potent anticancer effects by 
specifically modifying crucial signalling-pathways and processes in aggressive 
BC, warranting preclinical studies to validate its therapeutic potential.

BACKGROUND: Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) is essential for bone 
development and repair in vertebrates. Its role in tumorigenesis and progression 
remains incompletely characterized.
METHOD: Using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and bioinformatic tools, we 
analyzed BMP2 expression, prognostic relevance, genetic alterations, immune 
infiltration, and signaling pathways across 33 tumor types.
RESULTS: BMP2 exhibited elevated expression in tumor tissues of 
cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), glioblastoma (GBM), head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma (HNSC), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), and liver 
hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) patients, but reduced expression in 10 other 
cancers. High BMP2 expression correlated with reduced overall survival (OS) in 
esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), LIHC, lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), and thyroid carcinoma (THCA) patients, and 
shorter disease-free survival (DFS) in uveal melanoma (UVM) patients. BMP2 
mutations and amplifications were frequent in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBC), skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma 
(UCEC). BMP2 expression positively correlated with cancer-associated fibroblast 
(CAF) infiltration and interacts physically with ACVR2A, BMP4, BMPR1A/B, BMPR2, 
CALR, and HSPA5. Pathway analysis implicated transforming growth factor-beta 
(TGF-β) signaling pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: BMP2 expressions and alterations have tissue-specific prognostic 
implications. BMP2 may serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target in specific 
tumors via TGF-β signaling modulation.

Sphingolipids are bioactive lipids that are essential for cellular functions 
like signaling, apoptosis, and proliferation. They are also important in the 
biology of cancer. The complex dynamics of sphingolipid metabolism and its 
consequences for the advancement of cancer are examined in this review. It 
highlights the regulatory functions of important enzymes such as ceramide kinase 
(CERK) and sphingosine kinases (SPHKs) in preserving the equilibrium between 
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a pro-survival chemical, and ceramides, which 
encourage cell death. Tumour growth, metastasis, and treatment resistance are 
all significantly affected by disturbances in this equilibrium. The review 
emphasizes the potential of sphingolipids as biomarkers for cancer prognosis and 
stratification, providing information on the course of the disease and the 
effectiveness of treatment. Their crucial functions in cellular signalling 
pathways that affect angiogenesis, immunological evasion, and drug resistance, 
all of which are linked to cancer, are also reviewed. Their role in the tumor 
microenvironment further highlights sphingolipids' significance as targets for 
novel therapeutic approaches. Improved clinical results and personalized cancer 
treatments are made possible by developments in sphingolipid biology and their 
potential as biomarkers. This thorough synthesis provides the groundwork for 
further studies that will use sphingolipid metabolism and signalling to create 
potent cancer treatments. In the fight against cancer, we can improve 
therapeutic efficacy and diagnostic accuracy by understanding these intricate 
relationships.

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the crucial molecule that stores and transmits 
genetic information in living organisms. DNA can incur damage from various 
sources, necessitating efficient DNA repair mechanisms to maintain genomic 
stability. Cells employ multiple repair pathways, including single-strand repair 
and double-strand break repair, each involving specific proteins and enzymes. 
PARPs play a fundamental role in the repair of DNA to detect damage to DNA and 
facilitate the repair process. PARPi are drugs that inhibit PARP activity, 
leading to DNA damage accumulation and cell death, particularly in cancer cells 
with impairments in DNA repair pathways, such as BRCA1/2 mutations. 
Additionally, PARPi is promising in treating cancer, offering a targeted 
therapeutic approach. Resistance to PARP inhibitors continues to be an issue in 
a major clinical challenge. Mechanisms of resistance include homologous 
recombination repair restoration, increased drug efflux, and mutations in the 
PARP1 enzyme. Moreover, to overcome this resistance, researchers are 
investigating combination therapies, targeted therapies that inhibit 
complementary DNA repair pathways, and novel agents that can counteract 
resistance mechanisms. Future perspectives focus on enhancing our understanding 
of resistance mechanisms, developing more effective and selective PARP 
inhibitors, and identifying predictive biomarkers for therapy response. These 
advancements aim to improve the efficacy and durability of PARP inhibitor-based 
treatments, ultimately leading to better outcomes for cancer patients. This 
review article focuses on the reasons for the evolution of PARP inhibitors, the 
mechanisms behind resistance, and new strategies to overcome this resistance.

Recently, polymeric systems have emerged as the most practical and adaptable 
delivery method for targeted cancer therapy. Surface functionalization of 
polymers is one of the delivery methods of targeted drugs. For instance, to 
increase the selectivity and affinity of polymers for cancer cells, targeting 
moieties are covalently bonded on their surface. The surface decoration of 
polymers with a particular tumor-homing ligand, such as an antibody, an antibody 
fragment, a peptide, an aptamer, a polysaccharide, a saccharide, folic acid, 
etc. may also increase drug retention and accumulation in the tumor vasculature 
as well as promote efficient internalization by target tumor cells. This study 
discusses the recent development of polymeric systems coupled with particular 
targeting ligands for cancer cell targeting. Additionally, attention is given to 
the various polymers utilized in cancer therapy and how their surface decoration 
contributes to cancer cell targeting. We conclude that the surface- modified 
polymeric system in cancer cell targeting has emerged as a promising platform 
for safe and effective cancer therapy with the potential to maximize therapeutic 
efficacy while minimizing systemic side effects.

Cancer is a disease with heterogenous molecular signatures that ought to be 
unpacked to achieve the overarching aim of precision oncology. A pan-cancer 
omics approach provides a systems science framework to explore shared and 
distinct mechanisms across cancers. We report here pan-cancer analyses of gene 
expression data from 17 cancers, for example, adrenocortical cancer, lung 
cancer, kidney cancer, and colorectal cancer, and 26 tissue types, using public 
datasets to construct disease-specific transcriptional networks. Using the 
hypergeometric test, 1005 microRNAs (miRNAs), 314 transcription factors (TFs), 
and 332 receptors were identified as regulatory molecules interacting with 
differentially expressed genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway 
analysis was performed to explore their functional roles. Accordingly, we found 
miR-124-3p, miR-6799-5p, and miR-7106-5p as common miRNAs; Specificity Protein 1 
(SP1), RELA Proto-Oncogene, NF-κB Subunit (RELA), and Nuclear Factor Kappa B 
Subunit 1 (NFKB1) as shared TFs; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2 (CDK2), Histone 
Deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and ABL Proto-Oncogene 1, Non-Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 
(ABL1) as common receptors; and pathways in cancer, PI3K-Akt signaling, and p53 
signaling as commonly enriched. Survival analysis in an independent dataset 
confirmed these findings: SP1 and NFKB1 were significant in 9 cancers, RELA in 
6, whereas CDK2, HDAC1, and ABL1 were significant in 11, 10, and 10 cancers, 
respectively, out of the 17 cancers researched herein. In conclusion, these 
findings provide system-level insights on tumor heterogeneity and inform future 
cancer classification, for example, according to shared and distinct molecular 
signatures and development of therapies that might prove effective across 
several cancers. We underline that unpacking molecular signatures across 
multiple cancers also offers new prospects to move beyond the ""One Drug, One 
Disease"" paradigm of pharmaceutical innovation.

Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common malignancy and one of the leading 
causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Its histological and molecular 
heterogeneity make it particularly challenging to manage. The Cancer Genome 
Atlas classifies GC into four molecular subtypes: Epstein-Barr virus-associated 
GC (EBVaGC), microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), chromosomal instability 
(CIN), and genomic stability (GS), each of which has distinct genetic and 
epigenetic characteristics. Among this biomarker diversity, non-coding RNAs 
(ncRNAs) such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs play a key role in 
diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted therapy. For instance, the EBVaGC subtype 
features PIK3CA mutations and hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes such as 
CDKN2A, alongside ncRNAs such as EBV-encoded RNAs and H19 that enhance 
immunogenicity and response to programmed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 
inhibitors. MSI-H-GC is characterized by high mutational load and DNA mismatch 
repair defects, and ncRNAs such as MIR99AHG serve as prognostic and 
immunomodulatory markers. CIN-GC, the most common subtype, is associated with 
amplification of genes such as ERBB2/HER2 (human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2) and ncRNAs such as miR-22 and TERRA, which exacerbate CIN and are 
linked to a poor prognosis may be amenable to HER2-targeted therapies. GS-GC is 
characterized by RHOA and CDH1 mutations and epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) features, where ncRNAs such as HOX antisense intergenic RNA, 
ZFAS1, and Linc00152 affect invasion and metastasis by regulating EMT. Through 
interactions with miRNAs and signaling pathways, these ncRNAs not only influence 
prognosis but also represent novel therapeutic targets. Integrating multiomics 
approaches and developing ncRNA-based biomarker panels are essential for 
advancing precision medicine in GC.

Introduction: Few studies have compared conventional Roux-en-Y (RNY) 
reconstruction with oncometabolic surgical techniques for postoperative glycemic 
control in patients with gastric cancer and type 2 diabetes. This study 
evaluates the impact of long-limb (oncometabolic) RNY reconstruction on type 2 
diabetes remission and glycemic control compared with the conventional method in 
patients undergoing laparoscopic radical gastrectomy. Materials and Methods: 
Between 2020 and 2024, 44 patients with gastric cancer and type 2 diabetes were 
enrolled at our institution. Of these, 19 patients underwent laparoscopic 
radical gastrectomy with oncometabolic RNY reconstruction, and 25 patients 
received conventional RNY reconstruction. Demographic data (age, gender, and 
BMI), preoperative glycemic parameters (fasting blood sugar and HbA1c), and 
tumor characteristics were recorded. Comparative analysis assessed diabetes 
treatment outcomes in the first postoperative year, including antidiabetic 
medication use, insulin requirements, and diabetes remission rates. Results: 
Diabetes remission occurred in 52.6% of the oncometabolic surgery group compared 
with 20% in the conventional RNY group (P = .024). Multivariate logistic 
regression showed that oncometabolic surgery increased remission likelihood by 
5.75 times (OR = 5.75; 95% CI: 1.17 to 28.21; P = .03). Antidiabetic medication 
use decreased by 78.9% in the oncometabolic group versus 24% in the conventional 
group (P = .001). Insulin requirements dropped from 36.8% to 5.3% in the 
oncometabolic group (P = .031). Conclusions: Oncometabolic surgery provides 
significant advantages in gastric cancer patients not only from an oncological 
perspective but also from a metabolic perspective.

Breath analysis by direct mass spectrometry faces significant challenges due to 
the inherent complexities in sample collection, low analyte concentrations, and 
accurate compound identification. While current breath analysis primarily 
focuses on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for disease research, non-volatile 
organic compounds (nVOCs) remain largely unexplored despite their diagnostic 
potential. Here, we present a novel breath analysis method for lung cancer 
diagnosis based on nVOCs, integrating non-invasive breath analysis with machine 
learning algorithms for comprehensive characterization of 98 clinical breath 
samples. This study leverages a machine learning-driven database docking 
methodology to overcome the bottleneck of metabolite direct mass spectrometry 
conventional identification. This approach enables rapid and precise screening 
of non-volatile differential metabolites while effectively excluding exogenous 
confounders (e.g., pharmacological or environmental interference), enhancing 
nVOC detection in breath. The approach identified 29 statistically significant 
nVOC biomarkers, including fatty acids and amino acids, achieving a 0.9878 
prediction accuracy for lung cancer detection. For distinguishing between NSCLC 
and SCLC, the area under the curve (AUC) value can reach 0.9, and the out-of-bag 
error of random forest is 0.00402. Notably, specific nVOCs including fatty acids 
and amino acids have high diagnostic potential, with an AUC of up to 0.67 of 
individual metabolites for the differentiation of SCLC from NSCLC. Finally, 
significantly altered metabolic pathways were explored by metabolite pathway and 
transcriptome analysis, showing that the fatty acid metabolism is a potentially 
regulatable pathway. Our approach facilitates rapid, non-invasive discrimination 
of NSCLC and SCLC in metabolic analysis, showing promise as an efficient, 
low-cost clinical test.

BACKGROUND: While enzalutamide has demonstrated reliable therapeutic efficacy in 
the management of prostate cancer (PC), a substantial proportion of patients 
eventually develop resistance to this medication after prolonged therapy. 
Despite this, the identification of biomarkers to effectively predict clinical 
outcomes in PC patients who exhibit resistance to enzalutamide remains 
uncertain. The aim of this study was to identify a specific gene associated with 
acquired resistance to enzalutamide in PC and to investigate the potential 
prognostic value of this gene.
METHODS: The GSE183100, GSE147541, and GSE16560 datasets were obtained from the 
Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differential gene expression analysis was 
conducted using the DESeq2 R package and Wilcoxon's rank-sum test. Subsequently, 
biological process enrichment analysis and gene set variation analysis were 
performed to identify a promising candidate gene. Additionally, the correlation 
between the proportions of immune cell infiltration and the expression of 
candidate genes was evaluated. Finally, the potential implications of these 
candidate genes on survival outcomes were investigated.
RESULTS: A comprehensive analysis identified a total of 975 differentially 
expressed genes, predominantly involved in biological processes related to 
angiogenesis, inflammatory response, positive regulation of cell division, and 
membrane potential. Notably, secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) 
expression demonstrated strong, favorable correlations with both angiogenesis 
and the infiltration of Regulatory T cells. Moreover, the overexpression of 
SFRP1 was found to be closely associated with improved prognosis in patients 
with PC.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the downregulation of SFRP1 in 
enzalutamide-resistance PC is associated with angiogenesis and cellular 
infiltration. This study identified SFRP1 as a diagnostic biomarker for patients 
with PC who have developed acquired enzalutamide resistance. These findings 
provide an important theoretical foundation for the development of novel and 
complementary therapeutic approaches for PC management.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial cells (ECs) are key drivers of prostate cancer (PCa) 
initiation and progression. Our study aimed to identify EC-related immune genes 
as prognostic biomarkers and explore their clinical significance to guide 
therapy.
METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing data from prostate adenocarcinoma samples 
were analysed to identify EC-specific markers. Prognosis-related immune genes 
were screened using univariate Cox regression analysis, and a predictive gene 
signature model was established by employing least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the 
performance of the gene signature model. Immunohistochemical staining of 
clinical specimens was conducted to validate key findings.
RESULTS: A five-gene prognostic signature (opioid receptor κ1 (OPRK1), early 
growth response 1 (EGR1), arrestin β2 (ARRB2), high mobility group box 2 
(HMGB2), and tripartite motif-containing 27 (TRIM27)) model was derived from the 
differential expression profiles of EC-associated immune genes in PCa. Patients 
with PCa placed in the high-risk group exhibited significantly poorer survival 
outcomes. Our prognostic gene signature model demonstrated strong predictive 
accuracy and clinical applicability. Patients in the high-risk group showed a 
higher infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2 macrophages, whereas 
resting memory cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) T cells were more abundant in 
the low-risk group. Among the signature genes, OPRK1 was markedly overexpressed 
in PCa tumour tissues, and its expression was positively associated with a 
favourable prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the prognostic value of EC-derived immune 
genes in PCa and establishes a reliable gene signature model for PCa risk 
stratification. Notably, OPRK1 may serve as a novel therapeutic target, offering 
new insights into precision oncology and improving outcome prediction for 
patients with PCa.

BACKGROUND: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) contribute to bladder cancer (BCa) 
progression and treatment resistance. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death, 
influences CSC maintenance, but its post-translational regulation remains 
unclear. This study investigated how the deubiquitinase OTUB1 regulated 
ferroptosis and CSC-like traits in BCa through interaction with SLC7A11.
METHODS: OTUB1 expression was assessed in clinical BCa tissue pairs (tumour vs 
adjacent normal) collected from patients undergoing surgical resection and in 
cell lines. Gain- and loss-of-function models were established in BCa cells. 
Cell viability, stemness capacity and ferroptosis markers were evaluated using 
Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, Western blot, sphere formation assay, 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence, 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) and co-immunoprecipitation.
RESULTS: OTUB1 was significantly upregulated in BCa cells and tissues relative 
to normal controls (p < 0.01). OTUB1 overexpression significantly enhanced BCa 
cell viability, self-renewal capacity and stemness marker expression but reduced 
ferroptosisassociated indicators (ROS, malondialdehyde (MDA) and ferrous iron 
(Fe2+)) (p < 0.01). Conversely, OTUB1 knockdown impaired stem-like traits (p < 
0.01) and triggered ferroptosis (p < 0.01). Mechanistically, OTUB1 directly 
interacted with SLC7A11, decreased its ubiquitination and stabilised its protein 
expression (p < 0.01). Notably, ectopic SLC7A11 expression rescued the impaired 
stemness and ferroptosis induction caused by OTUB1 knockdown (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: OTUB1 inhibits ferroptosis and sustains CSC-like features in BCa by 
deubiquitinating and stabilising SLC7A11. The OTUB1-SLC7A11 axis represents a 
novel regulatory mechanism of CSC maintenance and may serve as an intervention 
point in BCa.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to investigate the potential use of qualitative 
interferon-γ release assay, specifically T-spot testing focusing on culture 
filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10) positivity, in predicting the response of patients 
with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) to intracavitary 
Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine instillation.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with high-risk NMIBC were retrospectively identified 
from an institutional database and subsequently underwent prospective T-spot 
testing. Following the completion of an adequate course of BCG instillation, 
patients who were unresponsive to BCG were assigned to the study group. By 
contrast, those who remained recurrence free for at least one year 
post-treatment were assigned to the control group.
RESULTS: In this cohort of 42 patients with high-risk NMIBC, the median age was 
67, and 40.0% were unresponsive to BCG. The distribution comprised 50.0% pTa and 
81% high-grade cases. Over a median follow-up of 18 months, the positive BCG 
response varied between pTa (81%) and pT1 (38%; p = 0.005), and T-spot testing 
revealed positivity in 75.0% of the control group and 92% in BCG-unresponsive 
patients (p = 0.235). Notably, CFP-10 positivity was significantly more 
prevalent in the BCG-unresponsive group, observed in 91.7% of the patients, in 
contrast to 35.7% in the control group (p = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: T-spot test or more specifically CFP-10 positivity is a potential 
marker for predicting response to BCG instillation in patients with NMIBC.

BACKGROUND: Radical prostatectomy is a common treatment option for patients with 
prostate cancer (PCa). In patients with a high-risk disease, the association of 
pelvic lymphadenectomy is recommended. This review aimed to address the main 
aspects of performing pelvic lymphadenectomy, including extension and anatomical 
aspects, number of lymph nodes (LNs) dissected, staging and presurgical 
planning, nomograms, benefits, and complications, in patients with high-risk 
PCa.
METHODS: We conducted a narrative review using English articles from the 
MEDLINE/PubMed database. The articles were selected because of their high level 
of evidence and importance, and we utilized the following expressions and 
combinations of terms: ""high-risk prostate cancer"", ""pelvic lymph node 
dissection"", ""lymphadenectomy"" and ""radical prostatectomy"".
RESULTS: LN involvement in patients with PCa is an independent risk factor for 
poor prognosis, and this procedure increases the risk of perioperative 
morbidity. Extended pelvic LN dissection is indicated in high-risk patients, and 
nomograms are useful in determining whether LN dissection should be performed 
because of the risk of LN involvement. Determining whether the rate of 
complications increases during the procedure is important.
CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk PCa, extended pelvic LN dissection promotes local 
staging better than that achieved through limited pelvic LN dissection and new 
imaging methods at the expense of increased risk of complications.

BACKGROUND: There are suspected disparities in clinical research (CR) 
development among low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study 
investigated differences in number and complexity of clinical trials (CTs) and 
how economic growth (EG) might contribute to these disparities.
METHODS: For countries classified as LMICs in 2000, number, proportion of phase 
1-2/3 and independent/pharma-sponsored CTs were documented. For correlations 
with EG, correlation coefficients (CC) were produced, indicating very weak, 
weak, moderate, strong, and very strong correlation.
RESULTS: A total of 16,977 CTs were identified. Asian countries China and South 
Korea experienced strong EG and increases in CTs (very strong CC). 
South/Southeast Asian countries had strong EG but modest increases in CTs 
(variable CC). Most East European countries and West Asian/Southeast European 
Turkey experienced robust EG and increases in CTs (moderate to strong and very 
strong CC, respectively). South/North American Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico had 
inconsistent EG but increases in CTs (weak to moderate CC). Among African 
countries, Egypt showed strong EG with a corresponding increase in CTs (strong 
CC), whereas South Africa had a weak CC. Most LMICs, except for China and South 
Korea, relied heavily on pharma-sponsored CTs, with a persistently low 
proportion of early-phase (1-2) compared to late-phase (3) CTs.
CONCLUSION: CR development has been unequal among LMICs. Strong EG could be a 
contributing factor but only to some extent. Only China and South Korea 
meaningfully developed independent and high-complexity CR. These data reinforce 
the need for initiatives to support cancer research in LMICs.

[Guidelines on clinical practice of molecular tests in breast cancer in China 
(2025 edition)].

[Article in Chinese; Abstract available in Chinese from the publisher]

Expert Committee of National Cancer Quality Control Center; Tumor Gene Diagnosis 
Committee of China Anti-Cancer Association.

Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies among women globally and 
ranks second in the incidence of malignant tumors among Chinese women. It has 
become a significant public health issue that seriously threatens women's 
health, highlighting the urgent need to establish a precision prevention and 
treatment system. Currently, the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer have 
transitioned from traditional histological classification to a precision 
medicine phase centered on molecular characteristics, significantly enhancing 
the specificity and effectiveness of clinical treatments. With the rapid 
development of molecular biology techniques, the continuous discovery and 
application of new biomarkers have fueled the growing demand for molecular 
pathological testing in clinical settings. The widespread use of various 
molecular testing platforms has driven clinical decision-making from 
population-based and standardized approaches to individualized and refined 
strategies. This shift enables clinicians to more accurately assess patient 
prognosis and predict treatment responses, thereby formulating more appropriate 
treatment plans. However, the emergence of new technologies and biomarkers has 
also increased the requirements for standardization, normalization of testing 
procedures, and the establishment of quality control. While this trend brings 
new opportunities for precision diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, it 
also poses higher demands on clinical and pathological practices, necessitating 
the establishment of unified precision diagnosis and treatment pathways and 
consensus. The ""Guidelines on clinical practice of molecular tests in breast 
cancer in China (2025 edition)"" was developed through a multidisciplinary 
collaboration among experts in molecular pathology and breast oncology, 
integrating domestic clinical realities with international advancements. We 
systematically evaluated evidence quality (GRADE criteria) and recommendation 
strength based on global clinical studies and practical experiences. The 
guideline aims to harmonize localized molecular diagnostic expertise with global 
insights, addressing critical needs in precision therapeutics, hereditary 
susceptibility assessment, and prognostic recurrence risk stratification. It 
proposes optimized clinical testing algorithms, emphasizes multidisciplinary 
integration, and establishes standardized protocols to ensure robust 
implementation of molecular diagnostics in China. This document serves as an 
authoritative reference for clinicians and pathologists to refine individualized 
patient management and jointly promotes the realization of the ""Healthy China 
2030"" strategic goal.

[Expert consensus on tiered diagnosis and treatment of single disease of breast 
cancer (2025 edition)].

[Article in Chinese; Abstract available in Chinese from the publisher]

Expert Consensus Writing Group on Tiered Diagnosis and Treatment for Breast 
Cancer (Single Disease Entity).

Breast cancer is the most prevalent female malignancy worldwide. In 2022, China 
recorded approximately 357,000 new breast cancer cases and 75,000 deaths, posing 
a serious threat to female health. Given the ""inverted pyramid"" structure of 
China's healthcare system in service provision and resource distribution, there 
is an urgent need to establish a rational medical service framework that can 
optimize resource allocation, ensure patients receive appropriate diagnosis and 
treatment at different stages, and strengthen patient-centered continuity of 
care, thereby enhancing overall therapeutic outcomes. Under the tiered diagnosis 
and treatment framework, the Breast Cancer Expert Committee of the National 
Cancer Quality Control Center and the National Health Development Research 
Center of the National Health Commission have jointly drafted and formulated 
this ""Expert consensus on tiered diagnosis and treatment of single breast cancer 
(2025 edition)"" to clarify the functional roles of different tiers of medical 
institutions, rationally allocate medical resources, and establish an integrated 
healthcare service system. This system emphasizes primary care, two-way 
referrals, differentiated management of acute and chronic conditions, and 
coordinated multi-level collaboration. The goal is to optimize comprehensive 
breast cancer management, spanning prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, 
and rehabilitation, ultimately improving patient survival and quality of life.

The high mortality rate associated with esophageal cancer highlights the 
critical need for innovative therapeutic approaches. This study aimed to 
evaluate the cytotoxic effects of Curcumin@β-CD-MGO/CS nanoparticles on YM1 and 
KYSE-30 esophageal cancer cells. YM1, KYSE-30, and normal HFF-1 cell lines were 
treated with varying concentrations of Curcumin@β-CD-MGO/CS nanoparticles. Cell 
viability was evaluated using the Resazurin assay, while reactive oxygen species 
levels and total antioxidant capacity were measured in both cancer cell lines. 
The expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax, and P53 genes were quantified using 
real-time PCR. The Curcumin@β-CD-MGO/CS were synthesized with impressive 
entrapment efficiency. This formulation exhibited selective toxicity, as it did 
not inhibit the viability of the normal cell line at concentrations that were 
cytotoxic to cancer cells. Curcumin@β-CD-MGO/CS induced apoptosis in cancer 
cells in a dose-dependent manner by upregulating pro-apoptotic genes (Bax and 
P53) and downregulating the antiapoptotic gene (Bcl-2). Additionally, the 
nanoparticles increased the production of reactive oxygen species while reducing 
the antioxidant capacity within the cancerous cells, further contributing to 
their antitumor effects. The significant cytotoxic and lethal effects of 
Curcumin nanoparticles on human esophageal cancer cells are likely due to their 
ability to induce oxidative stress and promote apoptosis.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the prevalence and incidence of chronic 
pain with neuropathic characteristics and to explore its association with 
psychological disorders and sleep disturbances in Brazilian patients with head 
and neck cancer.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted with 82 patients 
undergoing treatment for head and neck cancer at two cancer centers. Patients 
were categorized based on the presence of chronic pain and assessed for pain 
type using the Visual Analog Scale and the Portuguese validated version of the 
Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4) questionnaire. Psychological and sleep parameters 
were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the 
Mini-Sleep Questionnaire. Patients without baseline chronic pain were followed 
up at 3 and 6 months to assess incident cases.
RESULTS: Chronic pain prevalence was 20.2%, with neuropathic features present in 
47.1% of cases. Incidence of chronic pain at follow-up was 27.7%, with 11% 
showing neuropathic characteristics. Patients with metastasis (p = 0.014) and 
tumors in the oral cavity or neck (p = 0.006) had higher rates of chronic pain. 
Among patients without chronic pain, 27.7% developed it during follow-up, with 
11% presenting neuropathic characteristics. Incident pain was significantly 
associated with elevated anxiety scores (p < 0.001). Worse sleep quality 
correlated positively with anxiety and depression levels (rs = 0.39; p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Pain with neuropathic characteristics was present in 47.1% of the 
patients with chronic pain and developed in 11% during follow-up. Chronic pain 
was also associated with poorer sleep quality and elevated anxiety levels.

PURPOSE: Despite the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered 
automated segmentation tools for PET/CT imaging, their prognostic value in 
predicting survival outcomes remains inadequately assessed. Our objective was to 
explore the prognostic significance of tumor burden quantification derived from 
PSMA PET/CT using AI for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) 
patients receiving Lutetium-177 (¹⁷⁷Lu) PSMA therapy.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 107 consecutive patients with mCRPC treated 
with ¹⁷⁷Lu-PSMA therapy were analyzed. Utilizing a deep learning algorithm, 
PSMA-positive lesions were automatically delineated on baseline 68Ga-PSMA-11 
PET/CT scans. Key metrics were derived from the segmented lesions: total tumor 
volume (PSMATV), total tumor load (PSMATU = PSMATV × SUVmean), and total tumor 
quotient (PSMATQ = PSMATV / SUVmean). A prognostic nomogram was developed 
through Cox regression analysis, incorporating LASSO regularization for variable 
selection.
RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that higher PSMATV (HR 1.26), PSMATU (HR 
1.18), and PSMATQ (HR 1.29) were significantly associated with shorter overall 
survival (OS). A prognostic nomogram that integrated PSMATQ alongside 
chemotherapy history, hemoglobin levels, alkaline phosphatase, and 
prostate-specific antigen demonstrated a bootstrap-corrected C-index of 0.71 
(95% CI 0.64-0.78). Risk stratification using the nomogram showed significantly 
prolonged OS in low-risk vs. high-risk groups (median OS 30.9 vs. 7.9 months; HR 
0.25, 95% CI 0.13-0.45, P < 0.001). The retrospective design is a study 
limitation.
CONCLUSION: AI-based volumetric analysis of tumor burden on PSMA PET has 
prognostic significance for survival in ¹⁷⁷Lu-PSMA-treated mCRPC patients. The 
nomogram integrating PSMATQ with clinical factors might help in personalized 
risk stratification, facilitating AI-aided therapeutic decision-making.

PURPOSE: While prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission 
tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is a highly sensitive modality for 
staging prostate cancer, a notable subset of patients presents with negative 
findings, leading to potential under-diagnosis. The incremental diagnostic value 
of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in this specific cohort 
remains poorly defined. This study aimed to evaluate the added value of mpMRI in 
newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients with negative PSMA PET/CT results and 
to identify patient characteristics that predict this benefit.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 200 patients with newly diagnosed, 
treatment-naïve prostate cancer who underwent both 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 
pelvic mpMRI between June 2018 and September 2021. We identified patients with 
negative 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT findings but positive mpMRI results (PSMA-/MRI +). 
The clinicopathological characteristics, including Prostate-Specific Antigen 
(PSA) levels and Gleason scores, of the PSMA-/MRI + group were compared with the 
rest of the cohort. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses 
were performed to identify independent predictors of PSMA-/MRI + status.
RESULTS: Of the 200 patients, 18 presented with negative 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT 
findings. Among 18 patients with negative 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans, mpMRI 
successfully detected lesions in 17 (94.4%). These PSMA-/MRI + findings were 
validated as true positives by histopathology, follow-up imaging, or PSA 
response to therapy. Patients in the PSMA-/MRI + group exhibited significantly 
lower PSA levels (mean, 22.6 vs. 60.0 ng/mL; P = 0.002) and lower Gleason scores 
(median, 7 [6, 9] vs. 7 [7, 9]; P = 0.013). Multivariate analysis confirmed that 
both a lower PSA level (OR, 0.117; 95% CI, 0.024-0.566; P = 0.008) and a lower 
Gleason score (OR, 0.218; 95% CI, 0.060-0.787; P = 0.020) were independent 
predictors of PSMA-/MRI + findings. Patients with both low PSA (< 24.05 ng/mL) 
and low Gleason score (< 7) had the highest detection rate of 
PSMA-/MRI + lesions (37.5%, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Multiparametric MRI provides significant added diagnostic value in 
detecting prostate cancer in newly diagnosed patients with negative 
68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT results. This complementary role is particularly pronounced 
in patients with lower PSA levels and Gleason scores. Integrating mpMRI into the 
diagnostic pathway for this subgroup can mitigate the risk of under-staging and 
improve clinical decision-making.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the anti-colorectal cancer (CRC) activity and its 
potential molecular mechanism of euscaphic acid (EA), a triterpene component 
from Rosa roxburghii Tratt (RRT), in vitro and in vivo.
METHODS: EA in RRT was isolated and analyzed for pharmacophore-based virtual 
screening, and enrichment analysis was performed. HCT116 and CT26 cells were 
used for in vitro experiments. Meanwhile, we constructed a CT26 syngeneic tumor 
BALB/c mice model and performed in vivo experiments. Finally, the mitochondrial 
apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS)/mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK) signaling pathway-related proteins were detected by Western blot.
RESULTS: EA could inhibit the viability of HCT116 and CT26 cell lines, suppress 
the biological behaviors including proliferation, migration, and invasion, and 
induce apoptosis in vitro (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Meanwhile, in vivo experiments 
showed that EA significantly inhibited the growth of CRC graft tumors (P<0.05 or 
P<0.01). EA could decrease mitochondrial membrane potential and increase 
caspase-3/9 activities (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Furthermore, EA promoted the cellular 
ROS accumulation accompanied by activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, and 
interestingly, the phosphorylation level of extracellular regulated protein 
kinases (ERK) was higher (P<0.05 or P<0.01). In addition, the above process 
could be reversed by the free radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine (P<0.05 or 
P<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: EA could inhibit the growth of CRC cell lines both in vitro and in 
vivo, and activate the mitochondrial pathway through the ROS/MAPK signaling 
pathway to induce apoptosis in CRC cell lines. This supports the antitumor 
potential of triterpene acids from RRT.

BACKGROUND: The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment reduces immune response 
effectiveness in stromal-rich tumors, including consensus molecular subtype 4 
colorectal cancer (CRC). Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), precursors to 
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), promote cancer progression by suppressing 
anti-tumor immune responses. Hypersialylation of glycans on tumors engages 
Siglec receptors on immune cells, driving immune dysfunction, but its role in 
stromal-mediated suppression of innate immunity remains unclear.
METHODS: Sialylation, Sialic acids and Siglec ligands were measured on CRC 
tissue, primary human normal-associated fibroblasts (NAFs), CAFs, and 
tumor-conditioned MSCs (MSCTCS) using transcriptional profiles, 
immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, respectively. The effect of stromal 
cell sialylation on macrophages and NK cells was assessed in ex vivo human 
primary stromal and immune cell co-cultures, and expression of Siglec-10 and 
immune cell phenotype markers and function was measured by flow cytometry and 
real-time imaging. Using an immunocompetent Balb/c CT26 mouse model, we induced 
tumors with/without conditioned stromal cells, with/without pretreatment of 
stromal cells with sialyltransferase inhibitor (3FAX) or sialidase (E610). We 
assessed the effect of stromal cell sialylation on macrophages and NK cells in 
the tumor and secondary lymphoid tissues by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Stromal cells, including CAFs, in CRC tumors are highly sialylated 
compared with epithelial cancer cells and are associated with high expression of 
the sialyltransferase ST6GALNAC6. Genetic knockdown of ST6GALNAC6 reduced the 
expression of stromal cell Siglec-10 ligands in MSCs. CAFs and MSCTCS induced 
Siglec-10 on macrophages and NK cells and impaired macrophage phagocytosis and 
NK cell cytotoxicity. Sialidase treatment reduced Siglec-10 expression, 
restoring macrophage and NK cell antitumor functions. In vivo and ex vivo, 
desialylation of stromal cells increased macrophage activation (CD11b+CD80+) and 
reduced immunosuppressive marker expression (CD206, PD-L1, Siglec-G) in lymphoid 
tissues, indicating sustained systemic anti-tumor immunity. Intratumoral NK 
cells exhibited high Siglec-G expression and impaired cytotoxicity, and granzyme 
B expression significantly increased with sialidase treatment of stromal cells. 
In an inflammatory tumor model, inflammatory tumor-conditioned MSCs (MSCiTCS) 
promoted metastasis and Siglec-G induction on NK cells and macrophages, both 
reversed by sialyltransferase inhibition, underscoring the effects of stromal 
modulation of innate immune cell function in inflammatory tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: Stromal cell sialylation modulates innate immune suppression in CRC 
via the sialic acid/Siglec axis. Targeting stromal sialylation restores NK 
cytotoxicity and macrophage activation, offering novel insights that may shape 
therapeutic strategies for reversing immunosuppression in stromal-rich tumors.

Estrogen-Related Receptor Alpha (ESRRA) is an orphan nuclear receptor that plays 
a pivotal role in regulating cellular metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and 
energy homeostasis through transcriptional control. It has been implicated in 
diverse physiological processes and diseases, including cancer. However, the 
transcriptional programs governed by ESRRA and the underlying molecular 
mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that ESRRA 
serves as a central regulator in orchestrating the transcriptional activation of 
estrogen receptor α(ERα)-occupied super enhancers (ERSEs) and cognate ERα 
-target genes. In parallel, ESRRA represses the expression of cytosolic RNA 
sensors RIG1 and MDA5, thereby attenuating type I interferon (IFN) signaling and 
type I IFN-stimulated genes. In terms of mechanism, ESRRA is recruited to ERSEs 
together with ERα in response to estrogen and their binding to ERSEs occurs in a 
mutually dependent manner. In contrast, ESRRA directly binds to the promoter 
regions of RIG1 and MDA5 to suppress their expression. Consistent with these 
findings, pharmacological inhibition of ESRRA using its inverse agonist XCT790 
suppressed estrogen/ERα-induced gene transcription while enhancing type I IFN 
pathway and antitumor immunity, thereby restraining ERα-positive breast cancer 
cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Combination treatment with XCT790 and 
endocrine therapies, including the ERα antagonist Tamoxifen or degrader 
Fulvestrant, produced synergistic antitumor effects. Furthermore, co-treatment 
with XCT790 and tamoxifen re-sensitized Tamoxifen-resistant ERα-positive breast 
cancer cells to Tamoxifen treatment. In addition, XCT790 treatment augmented the 
therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents such as Doxorubicin in 
suppressing ERα-positive breast cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. In 
summary, our findings reveal that ESRRA is a pivotal regulator of ERSEs and 
estrogen/ERα-target gene activation, as well as the type I IFN signaling 
pathway, highlighting its potential as a promising therapeutic target in 
ERα-positive breast cancer in the clinic.

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE: To compare demographic characteristics, stage at diagnosis, 
treatment patterns, and survival outcomes of breast cancer patients treated in 
Brazil's public and private healthcare systems.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the 
Fundação Oncocentro de São Paulo, including women diagnosed with invasive breast 
cancer between January 2000 and June 2020. Overall survival (OS) was estimated 
using Kaplan-Meier methods and log-rank tests. Prognostic factors were evaluated 
using Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: A total of 65,543 patients were included. Age distribution was similar 
between the public and private sectors. However, early-stage diagnoses (stages I 
and II) were significantly more frequent in the private sector (77.8%), whereas 
the public system had a higher proportion of patients diagnosed at advanced 
stages (67.8% in stages II and III) and with metastatic disease (11.1% vs. 
5.3%). The proportion of patients receiving surgery and at least 2 adjuvant 
therapies (trimodal therapy) was comparable between sectors (46.6% private vs. 
46.2% public). Survival analysis demonstrated consistently higher 5- and 10-year 
OS across all stages in the private sector. Ten-year OS by stage was: I-81.6% 
(private) versus 77.5% (public), P < .001; II-74.0% vs. 63.3%, P < .001; 
III-55.6% versus 39.6%, P < .001; IV-7.6% versus 6.4%, P = .306. Multivariate 
analysis identified treatment in the private sector, younger age at diagnosis, 
higher education level, receipt of trimodal therapy, and earlier stage as 
independent predictors of improved OS.
CONCLUSION: Breast cancer patients treated in the public healthcare system in 
Brazil more often present with advanced disease, which is associated with 
inferior survival outcomes.

BACKGROUND: In early triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), surgery following 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is standard. Adjuvant capecitabine has shown 
survival benefits in patients with residual disease; however, data remain 
limited regarding the subgroups that benefit most, particularly when stratified 
by residual cancer burden (RCB), a key prognostic indicator post-NAC.
METHODS: Patients with early TNBC and residual disease following NAC (Feb 
2008-Dec 2021) were retrospectively included. After propensity score matching to 
balance baseline characteristics, recurrence-free survival (RFS) was compared 
between patients who received adjuvant capecitabine and those who did not.
RESULTS: Of 828 eligible patients, 631 were included in the final propensity 
score matched analysis (222 capecitabine; 409 observation). Median ages were 48 
years (range, 40-56) and 50 years (range, 41-56) in the observation and 
capecitabine groups. RCB distribution was comparable between groups: RCB-I (10% 
vs. 11%), RCB-II (68% in both), and RCB-III (22% vs. 21%). RCB was prognostic 
across the cohort, with 3-year RFS rates of 92.2%, 73.6%, and 43.3% for RCB-I, 
-II, and -III, respectively. Adjuvant capecitabine improved RFS in RCB-III (HR, 
0.6; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9; P = .02), but not in RCB-I (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.2-6.5; P = 
.93) or RCB-II (HR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.7-1.4; P = .84). In RCB-III, distant 
metastasis occurred less frequently in the capecitabine group compared with the 
observation group (34.0% vs. 62.9%).
CONCLUSION: Adjuvant capecitabine was most beneficial in patients with RCB-III 
disease, primarily through a reduction in distant metastasis. These findings 
support its selective use in high-risk TNBC populations.

INTRODUCTION: National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk stratification 
was updated in 2025. We compared oncologic outcomes between high-risk (HR) and 
very high-risk (VHR) prostate cancer following robot-assisted radical 
prostatectomy (RARP).
METHODS: Among 14,878 men who underwent RARP from 2008 to 2023, 2,871 and 100 
met the 2025 NCCN HR and VHR criteria. Cumulative incidences of biochemical 
recurrence (BCR), cancer-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality were 
compared between two groups using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. 
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) persistence was also compared. Multivariable 
logistic and Cox regression models were used to adjust for potential 
confounders: age, race, ethnicity, comorbidity, neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, 
and surgery year. Further, we conducted multivariable analyses to identify VHR 
features (cT3-4, grade group 4-5, and PSA > 40 ng/ml) associated with PSA 
persistence and BCR.
RESULTS: VHR patients were 4.25 and 3.37 times more likely to have pT4 and pN1 
disease, respectively; 35% exhibited PSA persistence. After adjustment, VHR 
patients continued to exhibit higher risks of PSA persistence (odds ratio: 3.67, 
95% CI: 2.38-5.58) and BCR (hazard ratio: 2.36, 95% CI: 1.65-3.38). 
Cancer-specific and all-cause mortality were comparable; however, the short 
follow-up (median 48 months, interquartile range: 24-72) limited mortality 
analyses. All VHR features were independent predictors of PSA persistence and 
BCR.
CONCLUSIONS: The 2025 NCCN VHR stratification is associated with adverse 
pathology, PSA persistence, and BCR. Preoperative counseling-including 
discussion of the potential need for neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and salvage 
therapy-and meticulous patient selection are essential when considering RARP as 
an initial treatment for patients with HR, particularly VHR disease, within a 
multidisciplinary framework.

BACKGROUND: Medical crowdfunding (MCF) seeks to mitigate the financial harm to 
families with a child with cancer.
AIMS: We sought to describe the illness phases, campaign creators, and the main 
topics discussed on MCF pages.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using publicly available campaigns on GoFundMe.com, we 
randomly selected 100 campaigns to extract information on stressors, appraisals, 
and additional attributes. We conducted descriptive statistics to describe the 
distributions of illness phases, creators, and topics, and Fisher's exact test 
to explore patterns in topics by illness phase and topics by creators. Primary 
therapy was the most common illness phase (75%), and friend or family of the 
child with cancer was the most common campaign creator (76%). In 30/76 friend or 
family creators, a parent posted updates. The most common financial stressors 
were deductibles/co-pay costs (60%), employment disruptions (58%), and 
treatment-related travel (47%). Nearly all campaigns mentioned non-financial 
stressors including describing the illness (88%) and the path to diagnosis 
(86%). Most campaigns included a tertiary appraisal of worthiness to explain why 
their child (75%) or the family (49%) was worthy of donations. Most campaigns 
provided emotional support (84%), few provided peer support (22%), and even 
fewer provided informational support (10%). There were many significant 
differences in topics by type of creator and few by illness phase.
CONCLUSIONS: Friends and family are most active in creating campaigns near the 
beginning of a child's cancer journey. Campaigners share information both to 
update and to convince donors to support them. Future work should explore the 
consequences of parents engaging in MCF.

OBJECTIVE: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is being investigated 
to treat individuals with autoimmune diseases. Data regarding the safety of CAR 
T cell therapy in this population are limited. We aimed to assess whether 
pre-existing autoimmune disease was associated with an increase in major 
toxicity or hospital length of stay (LOS) among patients receiving CAR T cell 
therapy for the treatment of hematologic cancer.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the National Inpatient 
Sample (2021-2022) to investigate in-hospital outcomes in adult patients 
receiving CAR T cell therapy. Comparisons were drawn between patients with and 
without pre-existing autoimmune disease. Multivariable regression models with 
adjustment for age, sex, race, cancer type, and comorbidities assessed 
associations with hospital LOS, major toxicity, and inpatient mortality.
RESULTS: Among 1,321 patients receiving CAR T cell therapy, 62 (4.7%) had 
diagnosed autoimmune disease. Patients with pre-existing autoimmunity had a 
significantly shorter hospital stay compared with patients without, with a mean 
reduction of 2.1 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5-3.6). Major toxicity was 
less frequent in patients with pre-existing autoimmunity than patients without 
(67.7% vs 78.6%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio 0.55; 95% CI 0.31-0.99). 
Inpatient mortality did not differ significantly between groups.
CONCLUSION: Patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease had shorter hospital 
stays and lower risk of major toxicity following CAR T cell therapy for cancer 
treatment, offering reassurance as to its safety in this population while 
providing additional data for research studies of CAR T cell therapy to treat 
autoimmune diseases.

γδ T cells are a distinct subset of T lymphocytes that recognize and attack 
cancer cells without needing major histocompatibility complex molecules, making 
them particularly useful against tumors that evade conventional immune 
detection. This chapter examines the role of γδ T cells in prostate cancer, 
especially their potential application in treating metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer. γδ T cells exert cytotoxic effects through 
the recognition of stress-induced ligands and metabolic byproducts like 
phosphoantigens and the secretion of critical cytokines, including interferon-γ 
and tumor necrosis factor-α. Recent advances in γδ T cell-based immunotherapies, 
particularly in combination with agents such as zoledronate bisphosphonate that 
enhances tumor recognition, show promising preclinical results. However, 
obstacles such as the suppressive tumor microenvironment and immune evasion 
mechanisms remain significant. This chapter highlights the therapeutic potential 
of γδ T cells in prostate cancer and the need for further research to optimize 
these approaches.

Epidemiologic data have significantly influenced lung cancer surgery, guiding 
clinical decisions from screening to multimodality treatment options to 
perioperative care. This article highlights the role of epidemiologic studies in 
lung cancer treatment with a specific focus on thoracic surgery. We explore 
thoracic surgical practices, the impact of epidemiology on public health and 
policy, disparities and inequities faced by the community, and future directions 
and emerging trends. By providing a population health perspective, epidemiology 
enables thoracic surgeons to make objective, evidence-based decisions in their 
clinical practice.

Lung cancer significantly affects patients' physical health and emotional 
well-being, with survival rates remaining low despite advancements in treatment. 
While traditional clinical trials often overlook patient experiences, the focus 
is shifting toward patient-centered care, emphasizing patient-reported outcomes. 
This article highlights the growing importance of these groups and the need for 
integrating innovative technologies to improve patient support and communication 
especially in the surgical setting, where still the concept of advocacy has not 
yet been widely adopted.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with increased 
incidental nodules and a higher incidence in young female individuals. Effective 
screening and evaluation are vital for early lung cancer detection, while 
advancing imaging with radiomics and PET/computed tomography help assess the 
risk of malignancy. Nonsurgical diagnostic procedures include bronchoscopic and 
image-guided biopsy, while surgical biopsies for diagnosis can be aided by 
multiple intraoperative colocalization techniques. Accurate staging, 
particularly of lymph nodes, and molecular testing are essential for treatment 
planning and prognostication.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide with an 
overall 5 year survival rate of 27%. Global lung cancer cases are forecasted to 
increase 86.2% from 2.48 million in 2022 to 4.62 million in 2050. This rise 
reflects an aging population and persistent risk factors including smoking, air 
pollution and occupational exposures. In this context, optimizing surgical 
outcomes is critical, as pulmonary resection remains the primary curative 
treatment of early stage disease. Quality in lung cancer surgery hinges on 
preoperative staging and surgical technique. The global burden of lung cancer 
demands that these quality gaps are addressed.

Preoperative evaluation is crucial for ensuring optimal patient selection and 
minimizing surgical risk. Advances in surgical techniques, including minimally 
invasive procedures and sublobar resection, have broadened the pool of patients 
eligible for resection. Incorporating modern technologies and thorough risk 
assessment is essential for enhancing preoperative optimization and improving 
patient outcomes. Staying current with these evolving approaches allows for 
better management of comorbidities, physical status, and surgical readiness, 
ultimately contributing to more successful surgery and recovery. By integrating 
the latest tools and strategies, health care providers can improve both 
short-term and long-term outcomes for patients with lung cancer.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer worldwide. Nonsmall cell lung cancer 
is the most common histologic subtype, and only 20% to 25% of patients have 
surgically resectable tumors at the time of diagnosis. Surgical resection is 
considered standard of care for locally advanced disease when seeking curative 
treatment. However, surgery alone is often not sufficient. The addition of 
systemic therapy to surgical therapy is imperative to optimize patient survival. 
Landmark trials, particularly those investigating immunotherapy, continue to 
expand existing treatment options in the management of lung cancer.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the 
United States. However, around the world, the incidence and mortality rates from 
lung cancer in men have been decreasing, whereas they have been rising in women. 
Additionally, there are clinical, pathologic, and survival differences between 
men and women who have lung cancer. Despite these well-documented differences, 
women remain significantly underrepresented in both surgical and non-surgical 
prospective clinical trials.

As many as 80 % of pancreatic cancer patients might suffer from cancer cachexia, 
a distressing condition characterized by involuntary weight loss and muscle 
wasting. Regrettably, there remains an insufficiency of efficacious 
pharmacological interventions for the management of cancer cachexia. The 
effectiveness of corylifol A (CYA) in treating pancreatic cancer-associated 
cachexia was assessed, and its underlying mechanisms were examined in the 
present study. Cultured C2C12 myotubes induced with conditioned medium from 
MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells (MIA CM) were utilized as an in vitro model to 
investigate the impact of CYA on muscle atrophy associated with cancer cachexia. 
The MIA cachexia mice model was utilized to evaluate the in vivo impact of CYA 
on cancer cachexia. CYA (2.5, 5, and 10 μM) dose-dependently mitigated MIA 
CM-induced myotube atrophy through targeting the thousand and one amino acid 
protein kinase 1 (TAOK1) and blocking protein degradation via the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagic-lysosomal pathway (ALP). 
Importantly, CYA (10 mg/kg/d, i.p.) not only significantly ameliorated weight 
loss and muscle atrophy but also inhibited the tumor growth in MIA cancer 
cachexia mice. In pancreatic cancer cells, CYA directly targets the thousand and 
one amino acid kinase 3 (TAOK3). Both knockdown and overexpression of TAOK3 
could alleviate the cytotoxicity of CYA on pancreatic cancer cells. 
Collectively, CYA ameliorated pancreatic cancer-associated cachexia by targeting 
TAOK1 in skeletal muscle cells as well as targeting TAOK3 in pancreatic cancer 
cells.

In this study, we developed an inhalable Nano-in-Micro (NiM) system for 
localized delivery of Sorafenib (Sor) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
therapy. Sor was encapsulated into mucus-penetrating and folate-targeted 
polymeric nanoparticles (FA-PPP-NPs@Sor), produced starting from the 
α,β-poly(N-2-hydroxyethyl)-D,L-aspartamide (PHEA), functionalised with 
poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and folate-conjugated polyethylene glycol 
(PEG-FA) FA (DDPLGA = 3.3  mol %, DDPEG-FA ≈ 8 chains/molecule). 
Nanoprecipitation produced 109  nm particles, easy to redisperse, with a DL of 
10 wt%, which showed a controlled release of the drug, about 8.4 wt% (pH 7.4) 
vs. 21.7 wt% (pH 5.5) in 24  h. A selective cytotoxicity towards A549 lung 
cancer cells via folate receptor-mediated internalization was found, being IC50 
= 18 ± 3.2  µM, significantly lower than those found both in 16HBE cells (IC50 = 
69 ± 3.1  µM and free Sor (IC50 = 17.7 ± 2.3  µM). The receptor involvement was 
confirmed by competitive folate blocking, which raised IC50 >100  µM. Wound 
healing assay performed to evaluate the ability of Sor-loaded nanoparticles to 
inhibit or reduce cell migration showed 27 % vs. 40 % wound closure at 48  h 
(NiM vs Sor). The nanoparticles were further incorporated into inhalable 
microparticles via spray drying (SD), using mannitol, leucine, N-acetylcysteine, 
and ammonium bicarbonate as functional excipients (yield 63 wt%, EE = 100 wt%, 
DL = 0.35 wt%). The spray dried NiMSor microparticles exhibited a MMAD and a 
FPF, respectively, of 2.2  µm and 76 %, suitable for deep lung delivery. 
Furthermore, their storage at r.t. and dissolution in water reconstitutes the 
nanoparticle dispersion. Rheology tests demonstrated time- and 
concentration-dependent mucus thinning. Overall, this study presents a promising 
inhalable platform for targeted lung cancer therapy, combining targeted 
cytotoxicity, mucus penetration, controlled release, and favourable aerosol 
properties.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CT online adaptive (COA) radiotherapy allows for daily 
personalization of radiotherapy plans based on cone-beam CT imaging. Presently, 
the impact of COA on prostate cancer outcomes remains unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records of 158 prostate cancer patients treated to 
60 Gy/20 fractions in a single department with either COA with daily plan 
adaptation (n = 81) or non-adaptive radiotherapy (n = 77) were analyzed. 
Dosimetric changes resulting from COA were assessed. Short-term gastrointestinal 
(GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicities were graded and logistic regression 
analyses with inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) were performed to 
assess the effect of COA on toxicities. The length of seminal vesicle tissue 
treated (LSV) was assessed as a predictor of COA outcomes.
RESULTS: On multivariate analysis, COA was significantly associated with reduced 
GI toxicity (OR 0.45 95 %CI 0.27-0.73, p = 0.001) but not GU toxicity (OR 0.65 
95 %CI 0.40-1.03, p = 0.07). Of 1620 COA fractions, 48.4 % demonstrated a 
clinically beneficial dosimetric change (63.7 %, 20.0 %, 15.1 % and 2.3 % for 
target coverage, rectum, small bowel and bladder, respectively) and 79/81 
(97.5 %) of COA patients experienced at least one fraction exceeding a 
pre-defined threshold for clinical benefit. LSV was positively correlated with 
dosimetric benefit from COA (r = 0.42, p < 0.001). In non-adaptive patients, the 
LSV was associated with short-term GI toxicity (r = 0.30, p = 0.009) whereas 
this association was abolished with COA.
CONCLUSIONS: COA is associated with dosimetric improvements and decreased 
short-term GI toxicity. Accounting for daily variation in seminal vesicle 
position is a primary mechanism by which COA improves outcomes.

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate long-term outcomes and tolerability of 
ablative 5-fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) administering a 
biologically effective dose (BED10, α/β = 10) ≥ 100 Gy in patients with 
inoperable, non-metastatic pancreatic cancer (PC).
MATERIALS/METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a prospective registry of 88 
patients with inoperable non-metastatic PC who underwent ablative 5-fraction 
SBRT using a CyberKnife with fiducial-based respiratory tracking between 2016 
and 2020. The outcomes included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival 
(PFS), and treatment-related toxicity.
RESULTS: The cohort included 55 men and 33 women (median age, 65 years; range, 
36-84 years). At diagnosis, 29 patients were medically inoperable, and 59 had 
locally advanced PC (LAPC). SBRT was administered at 50 Gy/5 fractions in 82 
patients and 55 Gy/5 fractions in 6 patients. The median gross tumor volume was 
33.6  cm3 (range, 3.7-167.8). With a median follow-up of 64.0 months, the median 
OS (mOS) was 18.1 months (95 % confidence interval [CI], 16.6-27.1) from the 
time at diagnosis and 15.6 months (95 % CI, 14.1-23.4) from the start of SBRT. 
The 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 73.9 %, 39.8 %, and 26.1 % from diagnosis, 
and 64.0 %, 36.0 %, and 22.1 % from SBRT, respectively. The mOS from the time at 
diagnosis was 18.2 months (95 % CI, 17.0-37.1) for medically inoperable patients 
and 17.1 months (95 % CI, 15.9-28.9) for those with LAPC, with corresponding 1-, 
2-, and 3-year OS rates of 86.2 %, 41.4 %, and 31.0 % vs. 67.8 %, 39.0 %, and 
23.7 %, respectively. From the start of SBRT, corresponding mOS was 16.2 months 
(95 % CI, 15.0-35.9) for medically inoperable patients and 14.4 months (95 % CI, 
11.0-23.7) for LAPC, with 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates of 75.9 %, 37.9 %, and 
27.6 % vs. 57.6 %, 33.9 %, and 18.6 %, respectively. Grade 3 gastrointestinal 
bleeding occurred in four patients (4.5 %), with no grade ≥ 4 toxicities 
observed.
CONCLUSION: Ablative 5-fraction SBRT with BED10 ≥ 100  Gy results in favorable 
survival and acceptable toxicity in inoperable, non-metastatic PC.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents approximately 15% of all lung cancer 
cases and is characterized by rapid proliferation and a high metastatic 
potential. In the search for new treatments, drug repurposing has gained 
increasing attention, particularly with FDA-approved agents such as palbociclib 
(PB). Other compounds with reported antitumor activity, including siramesine 
(SR) and β-Lapachone (LP), are also under investigation, although they remain 
unapproved for clinical use. In this study, we evaluated the antitumor activity 
and underlying mechanisms of SR, LP, and PB in the H69 cell line. 
Antiproliferative effects, apoptosis (via PARP1 and Bcl-2), autophagy (via LC3β 
and p62), and senescence (via p21) were analyzed. Antitumor activity was further 
investigated using the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay in ovo. 
Additionally, in vivo therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in subcutaneous murine 
models bearing H69 tumors, both as monotherapy and as maintenance treatment. All 
three compounds reduced cell proliferation and colony formation. PB increased 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and induced cellular senescence. In the CAM 
assay, tumors appeared less dense and showed reduced expression of the 
proliferation marker Ki-67. Interestingly, SR, LP, and PB significantly reduced 
tumor volume when administered as monotherapies in murine models of SCLC. 
Furthermore, when they were used as maintenance therapy following chemotherapy, 
these drugs enhanced the antitumor response. Therefore, our findings highlight 
SR, LP, and PB as promising therapeutic candidates for the treatment of SCLC.

Purpose of this document: The Oncology Committee of the French Urology 
Association (CCAFU) is proposing a 2025 summary of recommendations' changes for 
the management of bladder cancer (BCa).
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature from July 2024 to September 2025 
was conducted by the CCAFU on the evolutions of diagnostic and therapeutic 
management of BCa evaluating the newly published references with their level of 
evidence.
RESULTS: On NMIBC BCa guidelines: the addition of a new recommendation to the 
section 4.3. High-risk tumours and 5.2. BCG-endovesical therapy related to the 
association BCG+ systemic immunotherapy. On MIBC guidelines: A new 
recommendations to the section 3.1.1. Neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy 
and 3.2.2. Adjuvant immunotherapy treatment related to the perioperative 
combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
CONCLUSION: This 2025 summary of changes of French recommendations should help 
physicians to stay up-to-date with recent evolutions and aim to improve the 
management of BCa patients.

BACKGROUND: In the phase III PALLAS trial, the addition of two years of 
palbociclib to adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) did not improve short-term 
invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) compared with ET alone in high-risk 
early-stage hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancer. 
Here we report five-year efficacy outcomes, including updated iDFS and overall 
survival (OS).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: PALLAS is an international, open-label, randomized phase 
III trial evaluating the addition of two years of palbociclib to adjuvant ET in 
patients with stage II-III HR+/HER2- breast cancer. The primary endpoint was 
iDFS.
RESULTS: The trial enrolled 5,753 patients, with 2,883 randomized to receive 
palbociclib plus ET and 2,870 to receive ET alone. With a median follow-up of 
59.8 months, the 5-year iDFS was 84.2% (95% CI: 82.7%-85.6%) in the palbociclib 
plus ET arm and 82.4% (95% CI: 80.8%-83.9%) in the ET alone arm (HR: 0.88, 95% 
CI: 0.77-1.01; log-rank p = 0.0614). No significant iDFS benefit of palbociclib 
was observed in any subgroup, including analyses by anatomic stage, T-stage, 
N-stage, tumor grade, prior neo/adjuvant chemotherapy, age, or clinical risk. 
The 5-year OS was 92.6% (95% CI: 91.5%-93.6%) in the palbociclib plus ET arm and 
93.2% (95% CI: 92.1%-94.1%) in the ET alone arm (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.89-1.33; 
log-rank p = 0.4051). More patients in the ET alone arm (65.7%) than in the 
palbociclib plus ET arm (33.0%) received CDK4/6 inhibitors post-recurrence. 
Conversely, more patients in the palbociclib plus ET arm (52.5%) than in the ET 
alone arm (41.0%) received chemotherapy post-recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, five-year follow-up from the PALLAS trial confirms 
initially reported results. These long-term findings will provide investigators 
with important benchmarks for clinical outcomes in the contemporary management 
of HR+/HER2- breast cancer, and may be further used to guide adjuvant therapy 
for patients with high-risk early-stage HR+/HER2- breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Six cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy followed by avelumab 
continues to be used in some circumstances in advanced/metastatic urothelial 
cancer (mUC). To investigate whether shorter chemotherapy duration improves 
quality of life (QoL) without worsening efficacy, this study compared 3 vs 6 
cycles followed by avelumab.
METHODS: This randomized phase II trial compared 3 vs 6 cycles (3C arm vs 6C 
arm) of chemotherapy followed by avelumab in patients receiving 1st line 
treatment for mUC. This trial had co-primary endpoints of patient-reported 
outcomes (PROs) defined as change from baseline to cycle6 on the Global Health 
Status QoL Score, and superior overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints 
included progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), and 
safety. Here we report the final PRO analysis and interim OS.
RESULTS: 267 patients were randomised (133 to 3C, 134 to 6C). 42% received 
gemcitabine/cisplatin and 58% gemcitabine/carboplatin. 78% and 40% of patients 
completed 3 and 6 cycles as allocated. 74% of patients received avelumab in 3C 
arm, vs 56% in 6C arm. The mean QoL change between baseline and cycle6 was 0 
(95%CI: -5.9, 5.2) in 3C vs -8.5 (95%CI: -14.1, -2.9) in 6C, with a significant 
difference favouring 3C (+8.5 points, 95%CI: 0.7,16.3; p=0.016). Improvement in 
PRO scores was observed in 41% (3C) vs 24% (6C) of pts. OS was not significant 
(18.9 months in both arms (HR=1.15, 95% CI: 0.72,1.86; p=0.56)). Median PFS was 
8.0 months (95% CI: 6.7,11.9) in 3C vs 9.0 months (95% CI: 6.9, 12.7) in 6C, 
HR=1.05 (95% CI: 0.73,1.53). Median Grade 3-4 TRAEs occurred in 11.9% (3C) vs 
15.7% (6C).
CONCLUSION: 3 cycles of chemotherapy followed by maintenance avelumab is 
associated with better QoL than 6 cycles. Randomized trials with patients 
focused outcomes exploring shorter duration of therapy are feasible.

BACKGROUND: Adjuvant abemaciclib combined with endocrine therapy (ET) 
significantly improved invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) in patients with 
hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor 2-negative 
(HER2-), node-positive, high-risk early breast cancer (EBC). The impact on 
overall survival (OS) remained unknown.
METHODS: In the Phase 3 monarchE trial (NCT03155997), patients received ET for 
at least 5 years with or without abemaciclib for 2 years. Here, we report the 
primary OS results, a key secondary endpoint, and updated estimates of IDFS and 
distant relapse-free survival (DRFS).
RESULTS: Overall, 5637 patients underwent randomisation, with 2808 assigned to 
abemaciclib-ET, and 2829 to ET. In the intent-to-treat population, with a median 
follow-up of 76.2 months, abemaciclib-ET resulted in a 15.8% lower risk of death 
than ET (661 deaths; hazard ratio [HR], 0.842; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.722-0.981; P=0.027), meeting the prespecified boundary for significance. The 
7-year OS was 86.8% with abemaciclib-ET and 85.0% with ET (absolute difference, 
1.8%). OS benefit was consistent across prespecified subgroups. In addition to 
patients who had already died from metastatic disease, fewer patients in the 
abemaciclib-ET arm were living with metastatic disease compared to the ET arm 
(6.4% vs 9.4%). Sustained improvement was demonstrated in IDFS and DRFS (HR, 
0.734; 95% CI, 0.657-0.820 and HR, 0.746; 95% CI, 0.662-0.840, respectively). 
Seven-year IDFS was 77.4% with abemaciclib-ET and 70.9% with ET (absolute 
difference, 6.5%) and 7-year DRFS were 80.0% and 74.9% (absolute difference, 
5.1%). The long-term safety data compiled did not support any concerns of 
delayed toxicities.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant abemaciclib-ET resulted in a statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful improvement in OS compared to ET in patients with HR+, 
HER2-, node-positive, high-risk EBC. At 7 years, abemaciclib-ET continued to 
demonstrate a sustained IDFS and DRFS benefit.

PURPOSE: Adjuvant abemaciclib with endocrine therapy (ET) improves clinical 
outcomes in patients with high-risk node-positive early-stage hormone 
receptor-positive/HER2-negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancer, based on the monarchE 
trial. Patients may experience tolerability issues at the standard abemaciclib 
dose (150 mg twice daily [BID]), potentially leading to early treatment 
discontinuation, particularly within the initial weeks of therapy. TRADE is a 
prospective, single-arm, phase 2 study evaluating whether dose escalation of 
adjuvant abemaciclib improves drug tolerability.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had node-positive HR+/HER2- breast 
cancer and were candidates for adjuvant abemaciclib with ET. Participants 
initiated abemaciclib at 50 mg BID for two weeks, then escalated to 100 mg BID 
for two weeks, then escalated to the final dose level (150 mg BID). Dose 
escalation required the absence of ongoing grade 3-4 or persistent grade 2 
toxicity. The primary endpoint, measured at 12 weeks, was a composite rate of 
abemaciclib discontinuation for any reason or inability to reach or maintain the 
target dose.
RESULTS: In 89 evaluable patients, the initial dose escalation strategy 
significantly reduced the composite rate at 12 weeks versus a historical value 
of 40% from monarchE. In total, 26/89 participants (29.2%; 90% CI [21.3% - 
38.2%]; p=0.023) met the endpoint: 6 (6.7%) for early discontinuation, 8 (9.0%) 
for inability to reach 150 mg, and 12 (13.5%) for dose reduction from 150 mg. 
The majority (70.8%) reached and maintained 150 mg BID dosing.
CONCLUSION: Use of an adjuvant abemaciclib dose escalation strategy allowed more 
patients to reach and maintain target dosing at 12 weeks than observed in 
monarchE. Early discontinuation was infrequent, and 93.3% were continuing 
therapy at 12 weeks. This dosing strategy could be considered when initiating 
adjuvant abemaciclib.

BACKGROUND: ALEX, a global, randomized, phase III trial evaluated alectinib 
versus crizotinib in patients with advanced ALK-positive non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC). This final analysis provides mature overall survival (OS), 
duration of response (DOR) and long-term safety data.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatment-naïve patients with stage III/IV ALK-positive 
NSCLC were randomly assigned to receive alectinib (600 mg twice daily [BID]) or 
crizotinib (250 mg BID) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, 
withdrawal, or death. Primary endpoint was investigator-assessed 
progression-free survival (previously reported). Key secondary endpoints 
included OS, DOR and safety.
RESULTS: A total of 303 patients (alectinib, n=152; crizotinib, n=151) were 
enrolled. At the updated data cutoff (28 April 2025), after a median follow-up 
of 53.5 (alectinib) and 23.3 (crizotinib) months, median OS was 81.1 (95% CI 
62.3-not estimable) versus 54.2 (95% CI 34.6-75.6) months, respectively (hazard 
ratio [HR] 0.78; 95% CI 0.56-1.08). Improvement in median OS was observed with 
alectinib in patients with and without CNS metastases at baseline (with CNS 
metastases: 63.4 [n=59] versus 30.9 [n=53] months with alectinib versus 
crizotinib, respectively [HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.40-1.15]; without CNS metastases: 
94.0 [n=93] versus 69.8 [n=98] months [HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.58-1.32]). Median DOR 
in confirmed responders was longer with alectinib (42.3 months, 95% CI 
31.3-51.3) versus crizotinib (11.1 months, 95% CI 7.9-13.0 [HR 0.41; 95% CI 
0.30-0.56]). Long-term safety (median duration of alectinib treatment, 28.1 
months) remained consistent with earlier reports, with no new or unexpected 
safety concerns identified.
CONCLUSIONS: These final OS data show the sustained long-term systemic and 
intracranial efficacy of alectinib in the first-line treatment of ALK-positive 
NSCLC and confirm alectinib as a standard of care in this setting.

BACKGROUND: Standard treatment for high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer 
(NMIBC) after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is intravesical 
instillation with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) (induction and maintenance 
regimens); however, BCG therapy still fails in 30 to 40% of patients. Prior 
studies suggest that programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and 
alterations in immune infiltration might be associated with BCG failure.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The ALBAN trial is an international, 1:1 randomized, 
open-label phase 3 trial, comparing the combination of atezolizumab (an 
anti-PD-L1 antibody) and BCG (Arm B) versus BCG alone (Arm A) for BCG-naive 
patients with high-risk NMIBC. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed 
event-free survival (EFS). Key secondary endpoints included high-grade 
recurrence-free survival (RFS), complete response (CR) rate and duration of 
response (DOR) in patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) disease, as well as 
overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: In total, 255 patients were randomized in Arm A and 262 in Arm B. The 
trial did not meet its primary endpoint; there was no significant difference in 
EFS between both arms with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 0.71-1.36); P = 0.9106. EFS results were consistent across all 
prespecified subgroups. The safety profile of the treatment combination was 
consistent with that of the individual agents but showed higher rates of 
treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and grade ≥3 TRAEs than BCG alone.
CONCLUSION: This phase 3 trial in BCG-naive patients with high-risk NMIBC did 
not demonstrate an EFS benefit from the addition of atezolizumab to 1-year BCG 
therapy in contrast to positive EFS results reported with another PD-(L)1 agent, 
suggesting that any benefit from checkpoint-BCG therapy may be context- and 
agent-specific rather than class effect. Future research should focus on 
biomarker-driven patient selection and optimization of the timing, duration, and 
route of checkpoint delivery relative to BCG.

PURPOSE: Cardiotoxicity is a major concern for patients undergoing thoracic 
radiotherapy. This study compared the predictive power of radiation dose-volume 
histogram (DVH) parameters and radiomic/dosiomic features of the whole heart 
(WH) and cardiac substructures for elevated circulating high-sensitivity cardiac 
troponin T (hs-cTnT), a biomarker for early detection of cardiac adverse events.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective cohort of 160 patients with non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from a completed prospective trial and a prospective 
cohort of 57 patients with NSCLC enrolled in an ongoing trial were analyzed. The 
endpoint was hs-cTnT elevation, indicated by increase of ≥5 ng/L from baseline. 
An in-house auto-segmentation model delineated 19 cardiac substructures. DVH 
parameters, radiomic, and dosiomic features were extracted from each patient. A 
100-iteration Monte Carlo cross-validation (75%/25% split) was conducted within 
the retrospective cohort to mitigate random split bias. Logistic regression 
models using different input combinations were compared, with a model using only 
clinical factors served as the baseline. Key predictive features were identified 
using permutation importance during training. Models were validated by hold-out 
in the prospective cohort to evaluate robustness. Model performance was assessed 
by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).
RESULTS: Incidence of hs-cTnT elevation was 31.9% in the retrospective and 29.8% 
in the prospective cohort. The substructure DVH model achieved the highest 
predictive performance in cross-validation (mean AUROC 0.71, 95% CI [0.70, 
0.73]) and demonstrated greater robustness in hold-out validation compared to 
WH-based models (AUROC 0.60 vs. ≤0.51). Feature analysis identified the left 
anterior descending coronary artery V20Gy as the most dominant predictor, with 
cut-off values ranging from 0.2%-5% using various indices.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac substructure DVH parameters have superior predictive power 
and robustness over WH variables for predicting hs-cTnT elevation in NSCLC 
radiotherapy, emphasizing the need of using cardiac substructures for 
cardiotoxicity risk assessment.

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and 
CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) gene editing systems are among the most 
prevalent tools in modern genetic research and have been extensively studied in 
the context of cancer therapy. CRISPR/Cas9 systems can be categorized into three 
main delivery forms: plasmid DNA (pDNA) containing both Cas9 and guide RNA 
(sgRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA) of Cas9 along with sgRNA, and ribonucleoprotein 
(RNP) complexes consisting of Cas9 protein bound to sgRNA. This article will 
review the various CRISPR/Cas9 systems, focusing on the non-viral especially 
nanocarrier delivery strategies and common protocols used for their delivery and 
the challenges encountered during this process. This review will offer guidance 
on the potential applications of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology for the 
treatment of malignant tumors in the future.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: High dietary cholesterol is a known risk factor for Metabolic 
Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) and its associated 
hepatic carcinogenesis; however, its effect on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC) is yet to be investigated. The current study explored the mechanistic 
association between high dietary cholesterol, MASLD, and PDAC. Importantly, we 
aimed to evaluate the effect of a multi-strain probiotic formulation on 
hypercholesterolemia-driven MASLD and PDAC.
METHODS: In this study, wild-type (C57BL/6) and KC (Pdx-1 Cre; KrasLSL-G12D) 
mice were fed either with regular diet (RD) or high cholesterol and cholic acid 
diet (HCCD), and received an oral probiotic consortium LR+F15 (Lactobacillus 
rhamnosus GG and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum ILSF15). Additionally, we also 
used a syngeneic orthotopic murine PDAC model to evaluate the efficacy of this 
probiotic consortium. For mechanistic studies, pancreas, liver, intestine, 
peri-pancreatic fats, peritoneal cells/lavage, and blood were evaluated for 
metabolic, inflammatory, and malignant changes through histology, ELISA, flow 
cytometry, and qRT-PCR.
RESULTS: HCCD induced non-obese MASLD and PDAC progression, which was eased upon 
probiotics intervention. Importantly, it also increased the survival of the 
HCCD-fed KC mice. The probiotic intervention protected against HCCD-induced 
leaky gut, gut microbiota translocation, and inflammatory milieu in different 
tissues. Interestingly, HCCD significantly increased the population of 
pro-inflammatory/pro-tumorigenic peritoneal macrophages (PM), which got 
normalized upon probiotic administration.
CONCLUSIONS: The probiotic formulation LR+F15 significantly suppressed 
HCCD-induced MASLD and PDAC progression partly through suppressing leaky gut and 
normalizing PMs' inflammatory properties. These findings encourage evaluation of 
the potential benefits of this probiotic consortium in combination with the 
existing therapies against PDAC in the future.

MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and play 
crucial roles in cancer development and progression. Among them, microRNA-744 
(miR-744) has attracted increasing attention due to its complex, 
context-dependent functions across various cancer types. Evidence indicates that 
miR-744 can serve either as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, depending on the 
tumor type and cellular environment. This dual role is mediated through 
regulation of multiple target genes involved in key cellular processes, 
including proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion and drug resistance. 
This review explores the expression patterns of miR-744 in different cancers 
such as breast, prostate, colorectal, gastric, lung, and brain tumors. It also 
examines the molecular mechanisms by which it influences tumor biology. 
Particular emphasis is placed on the clinical significance of miR-744 in tumor 
progression, including its prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic potential as 
a biomarker. These insights will have supported by recent clinical and 
preclinical studies, while also considering its interactions with key signaling 
pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/AKT, and MAPK. Understanding the intricate, 
context-dependent functions of miR-744 is essential for developing effective 
miRNA-based interventions and improving patient outcomes. Continued research is 
necessary to clarify its tumor-specific roles and translate these insights into 
clinical applications.

Metastasis represents the major cause of colorectal cancer (CRC)-related 
mortality. Here, we sought to examine the mechanism of WD repeat and SOCS 
box-containing protein 1 (WSB1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in CRC liver metastasis 
(LM). An orthotopic implantation CRC model was constructed to analyze the 
differences in gene expression within cecum xenograft tumors (CXTs) and LMs. 
WSB1 was significantly higher expressed within the LM of nude mice than CXT, 
whereas type II iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO2) was higher in CXT. WSB1 
knockdown hampered LM in CRC with orthotopic tumors, which was reversed by DIO2 
knockdown. WSB1 degraded DIO2 by ubiquitination modification. The roles of the 
WSB1/DIO2/T3/TRβ1 axis in CRC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and 
stemness were also probed. Treatment of SW620 cells with knockdown of DIO2 in 
combination with T3 reversed the malignant progression of CRC in vitro and in 
vivo caused by knockdown of DIO2, but the intervention of sh-TRβ1 in turn 
reversed the therapeutic benefit of T3 on malignant progression of CRC. Taken 
together, our results identify the DIO2 degradation by WSB1 and subsequent 
impairment of T3/TRβ1 signaling as mechanisms leading to LM in CRC. These 
findings can inform therapeutic interventions for this event.

INTRODUCTION: Women ≥70 years with low-risk breast cancer face nuanced therapy 
decisions. Using qualitative analysis, we aimed to determine how oncologists and 
patients integrate geriatric considerations into complex treatment 
conversations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited women aged ≥70, newly diagnosed with 
clinical T1-2N0 hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative disease between October 
2020 and March 2023 from a large cancer center and audio-recorded and 
transcribed their consults with surgical, medical, and radiation oncologists. We 
identified geriatric issues included in conversational content and the dynamics 
of patient/oncologist communication. Data collection and analysis were 
simultaneously performed. We also assessed participant decision-making 
preferences, frailty, and life expectancy.
RESULTS: Of 48 eligible patients approached, 27 (56 %) participated with eight 
surgical oncologists, 17 with 11 medical oncologists, and four with three 
radiation oncologists (n = 48 consultations recorded). Fourteen patients (48 %) 
were ≥ 75 years, 23 were non-Hispanic White (76 %). Patients preferred to share 
(n = 15, 58 %) or make their own treatment decisions (n = 10, 39 %), rather than 
defer to the oncologist. Oncologists presented an explicit treatment choice in 
16 conversations (35 %). Chronological age was discussed in 27 (56 %) 
conversations, comorbidities in 44 (92 %), and multimorbidity in two (4 %). 
Other geriatric considerations were discussed in the minority of conversations 
[physiologic age: 20 (42 %); function: 20 (42 %); quality-of-life: 5 (10 %); 
life expectancy: 5 (10 %); polypharmacy: 2 (4 %)].
DISCUSSION: Despite numerous treatment options, oncologists neither commonly 
offer older women with low-risk breast cancer explicit treatment choices, nor 
discuss geriatric issues besides comorbidity. Training oncologists in 
communication around geriatric issues may lead to more person-centered breast 
cancer care.

Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are recognized as a critical subpopulation 
involved in cancer recurrence and metastasis, as they are capable of 
self-renewal and differentiate into various cell types. BCSCs play significant 
roles in tumor progression, being regulated by key signaling pathways such as 
Notch, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and Hedgehog, and their interactions with the tumor 
microenvironment, which affect tumor growth and resistance to therapeutics. This 
review focuses on the surface markers of BCSCs, their roles in recurrence and 
metastasis, and the key signaling pathways. It also discusses the recent 
progress in understanding how BCSCs contribute to drug resistance and explores 
potential therapeutic strategies targeting these cells and their 
microenvironment to improve clinical outcomes and prevent relapse.

BACKGROUND: Zoledronic acid (ZA) and denosumab (Dmab) are the standard of care 
for bone metastases, but there is no consensus on their long-term use. This 
study was conducted to evaluate treatment patterns (persistence, compliance, 
modification, and reintroduction of drug therapy), analgesic efficacy, clinical 
outcomes, and survival in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer 
treated beyond 24 months.
METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, patients who had received at 
least 24 months of regular q3-4w therapy with ZA or Dmab were analyzed for an 
additional two years. The primary outcomes were the analgesic effect, evaluated 
in terms of week average pain intensity (WAPI)), analgesic drug use (Word Health 
Organization analgesic scale WHO), and daily opioid doses (oral morphine 
equivalent, OMED) assessed at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, analyzed by Bayesian 
longitudinal mixed-effects models. Secondary outcomes included overall 
survival(OS) and adverse events. OS was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves, 
complemented by multivariable Cox models.
RESULTS: Among 355 patients analyzed, Dmab provided significantly superior pain 
relief compared with ZA, demonstrated by lower WAPI scores, reduced analgesic 
WHO escalation (OR: 0.07, 95 % CI 0.02-0.30), and lower opioid requirements 
(median OMED: 25 mg vs 67.3 mg). Incidence rates of SREs were similar between 
treatments. Dmab therapy improved OS (median: 35.8 vs. 29.9 months).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the importance for clinicians to carefully 
consider these differences when selecting bone-modifying agents for patients 
with cancer-induced bone pain. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the 
survival benefit of Dmab.

Bladder cancer (BCa), the most prevalent malignancy of the urinary system, is 
strongly associated with environmental factors including smoking and industrial 
chemical exposure. Although previous studies have explored the relationship 
between various environmental pollutants and BCa mechanisms, there is still a 
need for an in-depth analysis of the specific effects and particular roles of 
these pollutants. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms linking 
environmental pollutant exposure to bladder carcinogenesis through a multi-omics 
integrative analysis that systematically elucidates the environment-gene 
interaction network. By integrating transcriptomic data from multiple BCa 
cohorts with the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) gene-chemical-disease 
network, we identified 168 environment-responsive differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs). Subsequent Mendelian Randomization (MR), Summary-data-based MR (SMR), 
and colocalization analyses revealed three causal hub genes (CTSK, GSTM5, and 
PAFAH1B3; PP4 > 0.70) and associated them with 34 high-risk environmental 
pollutants. Molecular docking demonstrated strong binding affinities between 
these hub genes and more than ten pollutants, with bisphenol A, sodium arsenite, 
and tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) differentially regulating distinct targets: 
significantly suppressing tumor-suppressor genes CTSK (OR = 0.91, p = 0.004) and 
GSTM5 (OR = 0.77, p < 0.001) while upregulating the oncogenic factor PAFAH1B3 
(OR = 2.11, p < 0.001). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis and 
Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database validation confirmed tissue-specific 
expression patterns of these hub genes in bladder tissues. Our findings 
establish a comprehensive evidence chain connecting ""environmental pollutant 
exposure - gene interaction - bladder carcinogenesis,"" providing novel 
biomarkers and preventive targets for molecular subtyping and precision 
prevention of environmentally associated BCa.

Due to tumour heterogeneity, cellular metabolic activities and tumour 
proliferation rates can vary across patients, limiting the predictive and 
prognostic power of population-based metabolic biomarkers. Genome-scale 
metabolic models have been developed to address this challenge. These models can 
simulate patient-specific metabolic reaction rates and mechanistically elucidate 
cellular metabolic alterations. Simultaneously, phenotypes and other omics data 
can be integrated to provide valuable insights into specific tumour behaviour 
and molecular mechanisms underlying cancer biology. However, integrative 
approaches that combine multiple data modalities with metabolic modelling remain 
largely undeveloped. We propose a unified framework based on interpretable 
multi-modal machine learning, integrating different data modalities, including 
transcriptomics, clinical data, and genome-scale metabolic modelling, to 
stratify breast cancer patients. By integrating validation analysis across data 
scales, from bulk to single-cell and spatial data, our framework combines 
mechanistic knowledge from metabolic modelling with machine learning to 
characterise molecular and metabolic dysregulations across breast cancer risk 
groups. This unique mechanistic interpretation approach, combining data-driven 
and biologically-driven knowledge, provides a comprehensive understanding of 
breast cancer biology to improve personalised cancer therapy and reveal key 
biomarkers across multiple scales, including patient-specific, cell-specific, 
and spot-specific prognostic signatures.

BACKGROUND: Targeted alpha therapy (TAT) is recognized as a promising approach 
for eradicating tumor micro-metastases, owing to its high linear energy 
transfer. These micro-metastases are often associated with elevated recurrence 
across various cancer types, including high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). 
In HGSOC, overexpression of the protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) has been 
correlated to a worse prognosis. Consequently, the objective of this study was 
to preclinically evaluate the 212Pb-radiolabeled PTK7-targeting chOI-1 antibody 
([212Pb]Pb-TCMC-chOI-1) for intraperitoneal (IP) TAT in HGSOC.
METHODS: Binding and internalization of the chOI-1 antibody was evaluated using 
respectively flow cytometry and live cell imaging in A2780 human ovarian cancer 
cells. A two-step column generator was used for on-site 212Pb production. 
Following quality control, [212Pb]Pb-TCMC-chOI-1 was evaluated in vitro for 
cytotoxicity and in vivo for biodistribution and efficacy in IP A2780 
tumor-bearing mice, after IP administration.
RESULTS: Anti-PTK7 chOI-1 antibodies demonstrated specific binding and 
internalization in A2780 cells. Lead-212 production was successfully achieved 
using the 224Ra-based two-step column generator. Subsequent radiolabeling 
resulted in a radiochemical yield of >85 %. In vitro, [212Pb]Pb-TCMC-chOI-1 
enhanced cytotoxicity in A2780 cells. In vivo, tumor uptake was observed 24 h 
after IP administration (17.98 ± 7.85 %ID/g). Additionally, 
[212Pb]Pb-TCMC-chOI-1 significantly improved the median survival of A2780 
tumor-bearing mice (42 days) compared to vehicle-treated controls (25.5 days).
CONCLUSIONS: [212Pb]Pb-TCMC-chOI-1 was efficiently produced and demonstrated 
PTK7 specificity and potent cytotoxic efficacy, confirmed through both in vitro 
and in vivo studies. This highlights the therapeutic potential of 
[212Pb]Pb-TCMC-chOI-1 for the treatment of metastatic HGSOC following IP 
administration.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a leading cause of 
cancer-related mortality, projected to become the second by 2030. Liver 
metastases from PDAC (LMPC) are typically deemed inoperable, with dismal 
prognosis and limited surgical roles. However, emerging evidence suggests that 
liver resection may benefit selected patients. This study evaluates overall 
survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and prognostic factors following 
hepatic resection for synchronous and metachronous LMPC.
METHODS: A retrospective, multicenter cohort study from the REMENOCOR Project 
included 66 patients who underwent liver resection for LMPC in Spain between 
2010 and 2022. Eligible patients were ≥18 years with histologically confirmed 
PDAC and liver metastases. Survival outcomes, postoperative morbidity 
(Clavien-Dindo, CCI), and prognostic indicators were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier 
and univariate and multivariate methods.
RESULTS: R0 resection was achieved in 72.7 % of the patients, and major 
complications occurred in 19.6 %, with 1.5 % mortality. The 5-year OS and DFS 
were 26.6 % and 12.7 %, respectively. LMPC were metachronic in 65.2 % of 
patients. Synchronous resection correlated with significantly poorer OS (5 % vs. 
38 %, p < 0.05). Synchronous surgery and advanced pancreatic T-stage emerged as 
independent negative prognostic factors.
CONCLUSION: Liver resection for metachronous LMPC may offer meaningful survival 
in selected patients, underscoring the importance of individualized surgical 
strategies and the need for prospective trials.

Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer, and 
epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are its 
standard treatment. A bibenzyl compound mainly, erianin, derived from 
Dendrobium, which can directly bind to the colchicine site of β-tubulin, inhibit 
tubulin polymerization, and induce intracellular ferroptosis. However, the 
accelerated metabolic clearance and acquired drug resistance of erianin result 
in inadequate therapeutic availability, and structural modification is urgently 
needed to achieve better therapeutic effects. Studies have shown that the drug 
resistance of microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) is notably correlated with the 
overactivation of the EGFR signaling pathway in NSCLC. Moreover, the combination 
therapy of MTAs and other anti-tumor drugs represented by EGFR inhibitors has 
also achieved remarkable success in preclinical and clinical studies. In this 
research, a series of erianin derivatives as EGFR/tubulin dual-target inhibitors 
were designed and synthesized based on the structures of the known EGFR 
inhibitors and erianin. The optimal compound was identified through screening 
based on cytotoxic activity. Further studies revealed that it can induce 
ferroptosis by activating autophagy, demonstrating excellent antitumor activity 
and tumor metastasis inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. This research is 
expected to provide the new candidate drugs for the treatment of NSCLC through 
the design of erianin derivatives.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)is a highly heterogeneous and treatment-resistant 
malignancy, where conventional treatments are largely hindered by tumor 
microenvironment (TME) barriers. Ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of regulated 
cell death driven by Fenton reaction-mediated hydroxyl radical (•OH) generation 
and lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a promising strategy to overcome tumor 
resistance. However, ferroptosis efficiency in HCC is severely restricted by 
insufficient hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), elevated glutathione (GSH), and 
temperature-dependent reaction kinetics.To address these limitations, we 
developed pH-responsive nanoparticles (NPs) via Fe²⁺-coordinated indocyanine 
green (ICG) self-assembly, loaded with doxorubicin (DOX). This nanoplatform 
enhances ferroptosis through multiple mechanisms: DOX upregulates NADPH oxidase 
4 (NOX4) expression, thereby increasing intracellular H₂O₂ levels; ICG, upon 
near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, synergistically induces photodynamic therapy 
(PDT)-mediated GSH depletion and photothermal therapy (PTT)-driven acceleration 
of the Fenton reaction, ultimately amplifying ferroptosis. This study 
demonstrates tumor microenvironment-responsive and synergistic drug delivery, 
effectively enhancing ferroptotic cancer therapy while reducing DOX- and 
Fe2⁺-induced toxicity in healthy tissues. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments 
confirm that this nanoplatform significantly enhances ferroptosis efficiency, 
overcomes tumor microenvironment limitations, and offers a promising strategy 
for HCC treatment.

Precise targeting of the tumor micro-environment (TME) through nanotherapeutic 
innovations offers a transformative approach to cancer treatment. In order to 
increase the treatment efficacy, this review delves into the complex tactics for 
targeting different parts of the TME. Targeting the extracellular matrix, 
controlling acidosis and hypoxia, and preventing neovascularization by 
concentrating on pericytes and endothelial cells are important areas covered in 
this article. Strategies to stimulate anti-tumor immunity, regulate chronic 
inflammation, and restrict macrophage recruitment emphasize the immune system's 
participation. We have also highlighted the role of fibroblasts and exosomes 
linked to the cancer progression. The EPR effect, which is vital for cancer 
nanotherapeutics to work, and vascular pathophysiology are also included in the 
review. We examine how changes to the dynamics of pH inside the TME affect by 
nano-therapeutics. Additionally, the possibility of prodrug therapy within the 
TME, the use of controlled release mechanisms in nanocarriers to imitate 
metronomic therapy has been discussed. Lastly, the paper examines nanoparticle 
preference targeting as a potential strategy to improve treatment specificity 
and therapeutic efficacy in cancer management.

Metastasis remains a formidable challenge in the treatment of non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC), necessitating novel therapeutic strategies targeting 
anchorage-independent growth (AIG). This study investigates the inhibitory 
effects of LZ-106, a quinolone analog and potential therapeutic candidate for 
NSCLC, on AIG and metastasis. Through a series of in vitro and in vivo 
experiments, LZ-106 is demonstrated to induce anoikis in NSCLC cells, inhibiting 
their AIG ability. Mechanistically, LZ-106 disrupts autophagic flux, leading to 
the accumulation of autophagosomes and the promotion of anoikis. Additionally, 
LZ-106 elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, further enhancing anoikis 
in NSCLC cells under AIG conditions. Notably, a positive feedback loop between 
ROS induction and autophagy flux blockage is identified, reinforcing LZ-106's 
inhibitory effects on AIG and metastasis. In vivo studies corroborate LZ-106's 
antimetastatic efficacy, highlighting its potential as a promising therapeutic 
agent for NSCLC. Together, these findings nominate LZ-106 as a promising 
antimetastatic candidate and underscore a targetable ROS-autophagy axis for 
therapeutic development in NSCLC. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: LZ-106 inhibits 
anchorage-independent growth and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer by 
triggering a positive feedback loop between reactive oxygen species 
overproduction and autophagic flux blockade, causing autophagosome accumulation 
and anoikis. In vitro and in vivo data nominate LZ-106 and the reactive oxygen 
species-autophagy axis as therapeutic targets.

The key difficulty lies in accurately classifying the relevant genes through 
analysis and selection. A variety of methods are used to classify the genes. 
However, in the selection of numerous genes in the huge dimensional microarray 
data, only a limited amount of success has been achieved. Thus, this study 
focuses on designing a new cancer classification framework. In the initial 
stage, the microarray and seq expression information is attained from the 
standard datasets. Next, the pre-processing is performed using NAN removal and 
the missing value removal from the samples to convert it into a numeric feature 
matrix for making the data suitable for further levels of processing. Then, the 
Modified Sandpiper Optimization Algorithm (MSOA) is suggested for confirming the 
optimal gene from the pre-processed information. Finally, the chosen optimal 
gene is fed to the cancer classification stage, where the Hybrid Deep Learning 
Framework (HDLF) is suggested by incorporating the Graph Convolutional Neural 
Network (GCNN) with One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN). The 
parameters of both Graph CNN and 1D-CNN are tuned via the same MSOA. Finally, 
the experimental results confirm that the developed model performs well compared 
to existing machine learning and currently utilized deep learning methods for 
cancer classification. The precision of the proposed model is 91.78 %.

BACKGROUND: Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a major determinant of patient 
outcomes in early gastric cancer (EGC) patients. This study aimed to identify 
risk factors for LNM and compare outcomes between patients with ulcerative EGC 
(UEGC) and with nonulcerative EGC (NUEGC).
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 1262 patients with 
pathologically confirmed EGC who underwent curative gastrectomy. The risk 
factors for LNM and overall survival (OS) were assessed. OS was estimated with 
Kaplan‒Meier analysis, and prognostic factors were identified via Cox regression 
analysis.
RESULTS: LNM was significantly more common in the UEGC group (16.6 %) than in 
the NUEGC group (11.6 %) (P = 0.013). According to the multivariable analysis, 
lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (OR = 17.609, P < 0.001 for NUEGC; OR = 14.587, 
P < 0.001 for UEGC), superficial submucosal (SM1) invasion (OR = 2.622, 
P = 0.045 for NUEGC; OR = 2.276, P = 0.022 for UEGC), and deep submucosal (SM2) 
invasion (OR = 3.276, P = 0.004 for NUEGC; OR = 3.132, P = 0.001 for UEGC) were 
independent predictors of LNM in both groups, whereas a tumor size>30 mm 
(OR = 2.644, P = 0.009) was a significant factor only for NUEGC patients. The 
5-year OS rate was 89.9 % in the NUEGC group and 87.2 % in the UEGC group 
(P = 0.028, log-rank test). LNM was an independent predictor of OS in both 
subtypes of EGC, whereas elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels and SM2 
invasion were significant predictors only for UEGC patients.
CONCLUSION: Compared with NUEGC, UEGC presents more aggressive pathological 
features and is characterized by a significantly higher rate of LNM and worse 
long-term patient survival, while undifferentiated UEGC <2 cm potentially 
supports ESD expansion.

BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy is associated with pulmonary fibrosis in 5-15% of 
cases, potentially impacting lung function and thus the quality of life of 
patients with breast cancer. This study aimed to assess short, middle, and 
long-term effects of radiotherapy on lung function in women treated for breast 
cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A thorough literature search of databases (Medline, Web 
of Science, Scopus, and CENTRAL) up to October 2024 was conducted. Included were 
observational, experimental, and quasi-experimental studies assessing 
radiotherapy effects on lung function in women treated for breast cancer. A 
meta-analysis summarised findings, and risk of bias (Cochrane ROBINS-E) and 
quality of evidence (GRADE framework) were assessed.
RESULTS: Twenty-two studies totalled 1042 women, of median age 51 years [range 
44-56]. Radiotherapy administered conventionally (46-58 Gy, 1.8-2.2 Gy/fraction, 
23-28 sessions, 5 days/week, 5 weeks) or hypo-fractionated (40-43.2 Gy, 
2.7-2.8 Gy/fraction, 15-16 sessions, 5 days/week, 3 weeks), resulted in 
significant declines in FEV1%predicted, FVC%predicted, and DLCO%predicted at 
one-, three-, six-, and 12-months post-radiotherapy. Clinically relevant 
reductions (≥5%) were noted for FEV1%predicted at one and 12 months 
(MD[95 %CI) = -7.94[-13.94; -1.93], -5.10[-8.81; -1.39], respectively), 
FVC%predicted at one, six, and 12 months (-5.98[-11.78; -0.17], -5.90[-9.01; 
-2.79], -5.58[-9.32;-1.83], respectively), and DLCO%predicted at one, three, and 
12 months (-8.00[-15.66; -0.34], -5.51[-7.91; -3.11], -6.76 [-10.27; -3.25], 
respectively). Risk of bias was low in 64 %, moderate in 14 %, and high in 23 % 
of studies. GRADE assessment indicated moderate level of evidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy may affect lung function in women treated for breast 
cancer, especially in the absence of lung-sparing techniques, resulting in 
declines persisting up to 12 months post-radiation. However, heterogeneity in 
patient characteristics and treatment protocols among studies warrants cautious 
interpretation of these findings. This highlights the need for enhanced 
monitoring and supportive pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions 
in this patient group.

Most immunotherapies work through activating new effector tumor antigen-specific 
T cells (ETASTs) or re-activating pre-existing ETASTs repertoire. Increasing 
ETASTs can treat cancer. Expanding autologous ETASTs is an ideal source to 
increase ETASTs. However, to get better therapeutic efficacy, isolating 
polyclonal ETASTs is needed and unachievable currently. No distinct structure 
characteristics exist between ETASTs and other T cells. Therefore, nanoparticles 
loading whole-tumor antigens are utilized to activate pre-existing pan-clones 
ETASTs to transform the differences between ETASTs and other T cells to the 
differences between activated and non-activated status, followed by isolating 
ETASTs by using proper activation markers. Herein, by optimizing 15 activation 
markers, CD137, CD134 and CD39 were identified to be ideal markers to isolate 
ETASTs simultaneously possessing both activation and cytotoxic properties. 
CD137+, CD134+ and CD39+ ETASTs are better than CD25+ and CD95L+ ETASTs, due to 
Treg exist in CD25+ETASTs and the overlapping of surface markers with IFN-γ is 
more important than that with granzyme B. In melanoma and lung cancer mouse 
model, ETASTs activated by nanoparticles loading whole-tumor antigens and sorted 
by selected markers can cure ≥75 % tumor-bearing mice, either ETASTs are from 
blood, lymph node, or splenocytes. Furthermore, ETASTs isolated from PBMC of 
lung cancer patients can efficiently kill autologous cancer cells. In summary, 
herein provides a new method to isolate pan-clones pre-existing ETASTs in 
tumor-bearing bodies using nanoparticles and proves that CD137/CD134/CD39 are 
ideal biomarkers to isolate activated ETASTs. Such isolated pan-clones ETASTs 
are more efficient, highly specific, more diverse, autologous, low cost and 
gene-editing free etc.

The Oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) has been demonstrated to play a key regulatory 
role in multiple cancer types; however, the functional role of OSMR in gastric 
cancer (GC) remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate OSMR 
expression in GC, its association with clinical and histopathological features, 
its prognostic significance, and its potential involvement in the tumor 
immunological microenvironment. OSMR expression levels were assessed through 
immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Our findings revealed that OSMR was 
significantly upregulated in most tumor types. Experimental and database 
analyses demonstrated that OSMR expression was elevated in GC and correlated 
with poor prognosis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Set 
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) indicated that high OSMR expression may activate the 
JAK-STAT, PI3K-AKT, and Focal Adhesion signaling pathways. Moreover, an 
OSMR-derived genomic model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting clinical 
outcomes among gastric cancer patients. A nomogram incorporating age and the 
OSMR-derived risk score was employed to more precisely estimate an individual's 
probability of survival. Additionally, elevated OSMR levels were correlated with 
increased immune cell infiltration and diminished response to immunotherapy. 
Finally, silencing OSMR significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation, 
invasion, and migration, while markedly reducing the phosphorylation of JAK3 and 
STAT3, as well as the expression of HIF-1α, VEGFA, and PD-L1. In summary, our 
findings indicate that OSMR plays a pivotal role in regulating tumor progression 
and the immune microenvironment in gastric cancer through the JAK/STAT3/HIF-1α 
signaling pathway.

RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL signalling and its activation can lead to a regulated form of 
inflammatory cell death characterised by the release of intracellular contents 
into the extracellular space, contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor 
microenvironment (TME). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), 
approximately half of cell death involves necrosis. Targeting RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL 
signalling represents a promising therapeutic strategy for oral squamous cell 
carcinoma (OSCC). In this study, we evaluated the impact of histone 
deacetylase-6 (HDAC6) inhibition on this pathway and TME using Tubastatin A 
(TSA), a highly selective HDAC6 inhibitor. Our findings revealed that HDAC6 
expression was significantly upregulated during necrotic cell death in MOC2-OSCC 
cells. Treatment with TSA suppressed the translocation of phosphorylated MLKL 
(p-MLKL) to the cell membrane, thereby effectively inhibiting cell death. Using 
an MOC2-induced syngeneic OSCC mouse model, we observed that administration of 
TSA significantly reduced tumor volume and weight. TSA also decreased 
RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL expression in tumor-bearing mice and modulated the 
immunosuppressive TME by altering immune cell populations. Specifically, TSA 
increased CD45+ immune cells and M1 macrophages while reducing myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells (MDSCs). Additionally, TSA enhanced T-cell-mediated anti-tumor 
immunity, as indicated by lower levels of CD8a+PD1+ and CD4+PD1+ regulatory T 
cells and higher levels of CD8a+Granzyme+, CD4+Granzyme+, CD8a+IFNγ+, and 
CD4+IFNγ+ cells in the spleen and tumor. In conclusion, TSA attenuates 
RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL-signalling and reprograms the immunosuppressive TME, inhibiting 
OSCC progression and highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent in 
clinical conditions.

Trispecific T cell engagers (Tri-TCEs) hold significant promise for tumor 
immunotherapy but face challenges from complex manufacturing and low production 
yields. Herein, a nanobody-based trispecific T cell nanoengagers platform, 
termed Tri-Nb@FNP is introduced, which leverages the modular and programmable 
assembly of nanobodies on ferritin nanoparticles (FNP) via SpyTag/SpyCatcher 
bioconjugation technology. These nanoengagers are designed to target 
EGFR-positive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) or HER2 positive breast 
cancer, alongside CD3 and CD28 on T cells, thereby facilitating precise immune 
synapse formation. This synergistic interaction robustly enhances T cell 
activation, proliferation and cytotoxicity, promotes cytotoxic CD8+ T cell 
infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and achieves significant tumor 
suppression both in vitro and in vivo. Tri-Nb@FNP is thus established as a novel 
class of Tri-TCEs, offering a simple and efficient self-assembly platform to 
integrate multispecific targeting molecules for advancing cancer immunotherapy.

The efficacy of radiation therapy is limited by low oxygen tension within solid 
tumors. Papaverine and some derivatives were previously shown to inhibit 
mitochondrial complex 1 and decrease oxygen consumption, reversing hypoxia and 
radiosensitizing model tumors. Papaverine is typically used as a vasorelaxant 
due to its ability to inhibit phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A), which can lead to 
unwanted side effects when used clinically as a radiosensitizer. We have 
therefore generated additional derivatives which have improved mitochondrial 
complex 1 inhibition and reduced PDE10A inhibition. Two of these compounds were 
tested in vivo for radiosensitization of murine EO771 mammary gland tumors and 
found to be as effective as papaverine with an improved safety profile.

BACKGROUND: Androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSIs) have become the 
standard treatment for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). 
While visceral metastases, including lung metastases (LMs), are considered poor 
prognostic factors, their impact on clinical outcomes in mCSPC remains unclear. 
This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of LM in mCSPC patients 
treated with ARSI-based doublet therapy.
METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed a multi-institutional cohort of 453 
mCSPC patients treated with ARSIa-based doublet therapy.
RESULTS: The median overall survival (OS) and time to castration resistance 
(TTCR) were 80 and 41 months, respectively, with a median follow-up of 
20 months. The total cohort included 117 patients (25.8%) with LM and 336 
patients (74.2%) without LM. LATITUDE high-risk and CHAARTED high-volume 
criteria classified 380 patients (83.9%) and 356 patients (78.6%), respectively. 
Although not statistically significant, OS and TTCR showed a trend toward better 
outcomes in the LM group compared to the non-LM group in LATITUDE high-risk 
(n = 380: P = .097 for OS and P = .104 for TTCR) and CHAARTED high-volume 
(n = 356: P = .064 for OS and P = .086 for TTCR). In the propensity score 
matching cohort (n = 218 and n = 206 for LATITUDE and CHAARTED criteria, 
respectively), OS and TTCR remained comparable between the LM and non-LM groups.
CONCLUSIONS: LM does not appear to be related to OS or TTCR in mCSPC patients 
treated with ARSI-based doublet therapy, indicating that its prognostic value 
may need to be reevaluated.

We present a protocol for predicting γ-tocotrienol (γT3) and δ-tocotrienol (δT3) 
binding to colorectal cancer-related proteins using Schrödinger's Maestro and 
Glide. The protocol describes protein preparation, ligand processing, and 
receptor grid generation, followed by docking simulations. It outputs binding 
affinities (kcal/mol) and interaction maps, with δT3 expected to bind slightly 
more strongly. This workflow includes checkpoints and troubleshooting, providing 
a reproducible framework suitable for users with intermediate to advanced 
molecular modeling experience.

BACKGROUND: Cellulitis, resulting from impaired lymphatic function, is a 
debilitating complication of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) that 
contributes to lymphedema progression. However, the clinical presentation and 
microbiologic profile of BCRL-associated cellulitis remain poorly defined. This 
study investigated the prevalence, clinical features, and treatment outcomes of 
cellulitis in BCRL, aiming to identify risk factors for recurrence and inform 
evidence-based treatment strategies.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of cellulitis episodes among 2920 
patients with BCRL treated at a single institution between 2000 and 2024. 
Demographic, clinical, microbiologic, and treatment data were analyzed. 
Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to 
evaluate risk factors associated with recurrent cellulitis.
RESULTS: A total of 418 cellulitis episodes were documented among 231 patients 
with BCRL, indicating a prevalence of 7.9% (231/2920) and a recurrence rate of 
39.0% (90/231). Blood cultures were obtained in 255 (61.7%) episodes, of which 
33 (12.9%) were positive. Streptococcus agalactiae was the most frequently 
isolated pathogen (8/33; 24.2%). Risk factors independently associated with 
recurrence included any radiotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 2.15; 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.24-3.72; P < 0.01), axillary lymph node dissection (HR 1.96; 95% 
CI 1.05-3.68; P < 0.05), and shorter time from BCRL diagnosis to the initial 
cellulitis episode (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.99-0.99; P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Cellulitis is a significant complication of BCRL with a high 
recurrence rate. Radiotherapy, axillary lymph node dissection, and early 
cellulitis onset are associated with recurrence. These findings support 
proactive surveillance and risk-stratified prevention strategies to reduce 
infection burden and improve outcomes in this high-risk population.

BACKGROUND: Several gemcitabine-based regimens are effective as first-line 
treatments for advanced biliary tract carcinoma (BTC), while fluorouracil, 
folinic acid, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is commonly used as second-line therapy 
in Western countries. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of 
FOLFOX in Japanese patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed cases of BTC patients who were refractory 
to or intolerant of at least one gemcitabine-based regimen and subsequently 
received FOLFOX. Data on clinical characteristics, adverse events, treatment 
responses, and patient outcomes were collected. Because the FOLFOX regimen have 
not been approved in Japan, we have followed the appropriate procedures for the 
off-label use of FOLFOX in accordance with each institution's regulations and 
relevant laws and regulations.
RESULTS: A total of 50 patients were included. Grade 3 or higher adverse events 
occurred in 30 patients (60%), 21 patients (42%) requiring dose reduction, and 
24 patients (48%) requiring treatment delays. No treatment-related deaths 
occurred. The objective response rate (ORR) was 6%, with a disease control rate 
of 56%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) 
were 3.4 months and 6.8 months, respectively. Among 14 patients who received 
FOLFOX as second-line treatment after gemcitabine and cisplatin, the ORR, median 
PFS, and median OS were 14%, 4.6 months, and 7.5 months, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study suggested the efficacy and safety of FOLFOX as a 
second-line or later treatment option also for Japanese patients with advanced 
BTC.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), derived from 
diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), is commonly calculated using a monoexponential 
model. However, there is no consensus on optimal b-value selection for ADC 
quantification in rectal cancer. This prospective observational study evaluated 
how varying b-value combinations influence ADC values. Patient/material and 
methods: DWI with seven b-values (b = 0, 25, 50, 100, 500, 1,000, and 1,300 
s/mm2) was acquired from 23 rectal cancer patients in the OxyTarget study 
(NCT01816607) using a 1.5T Philips Achieva scanner. Two radiologists 
independently delineated whole-tumour volumes of interest. ADC values were 
calculated using 18 different b-value combinations and compared with a 
biexponential reference.
RESULTS: Tumour ADCs varied significantly across b-value combinations. Excluding 
low b-values (b ≤ 100 s/mm²) led to reduced ADCs. Although b = 0 s/mm² is 
commonly included in ADC calculations, this study demonstrates that its 
inclusion leads to substantial overestimation. The use of two or three b-values 
from b = 500, 1,000, and 1,300 s/mm² yielded the smallest deviations from the 
biexponential reference.
INTERPRETATION: In rectal cancer, tumour ADC calculated using the 
monoexponential model is strongly influenced by the choice of b-values. By 
eliminating the contribution from perfusion (b ≤ 100 s/mm2) the uncertainty in 
the calculations is significantly reduced. Our findings support the use of 
b-values exceeding 100 s/mm², ideally in combination with a high b-value of at 
least 1,000 s/mm², when assessing diffusion using the monoexponential model. 
Consistent b-value combinations across studies are recommended for reliable 
quantitative comparisons of ADC values.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in 
defense against cancer. Low NK cell activity (NKA) has been linked to prostate 
cancer (PCa) detection, and effective NKA may be associated with better 
prognosis in metastatic PCa. Radiotherapy (RT) could affect the immune response, 
but data on NKA in patients with PCa receiving RT ± androgen deprivation therapy 
(ADT) remain limited. Hence, this study investigated NKA in such patients. 
Patient/material and methods: Peripheral blood from 150 patients with PCa 
receiving curatively intended RT was collected into NK Vue® tubes prior to RT 
(baseline, BL), after end of RT (EOT), and during follow-up. Patients received 
0- (n = 15), 6- (n = 23), or 36-months of ADT (n = 112), starting 3 months 
before RT. Interferon-γ was a surrogate marker for NKA in NK Vue® tubes. Data 
were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between patients with normal (≥ 
250 pg/mL) (n = 46) and low (< 250 pg/mL) (n = 104) NKA; however, smoking was 
more prevalent in the low NKA group (28% vs. 11%). The distribution of NKA 
levels differed between groups and time points, notably showing a decreased 
interquartile range (IQR) for all groups at EOT (BL median 832 pg/mL, IQR 2901; 
EOT median 312 pg/mL, IQR 708). NKA fluctuated during follow-up and did not 
mirror prostate-specific antigen dynamics.
INTERPRETATION: Patients with localized PCa treated with RT ± ADT displayed 
marked variation in NKA, including treatment-related dynamics. The overall 
complexity and heterogeneity of NKA raise questions about its clinical utility 
as a biomarker in this setting.

Gastric cancer remains the primary cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, 
where gastric cancer stem cells play an essential role in tumor growth and 
resistance to various gastric cancer therapies. Emerging evidence suggests that 
the interaction between Epstein-Barr virus and Helicobacter pylori may affect 
the regulation of gastric cancer stem cells, although the exact mechanism 
remains to be explored. This mini-review aims to explore the potential 
interaction between Epstein-Barr virus and Helicobacter pylori in modifying the 
characteristics of gastric cancer stem cells, emphasizing their respective roles 
in the inflammatory tumor microenvironment and the synergistic effects on 
gastric carcinogenesis. This review article presents the impact of Epstein-Barr 
virus-induced immune evasion and Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric 
inflammation on the maintenance and differentiation of gastric cancer stem 
cells. We seek alterations in numerous signaling pathways related to stemness 
induced by microbial factors. Based on current understanding, several crucial 
signaling pathways, including the Notch, Hippo pathway, Nuclear factor-κB, 
wingless-related integration site, and autophagy pathways, have been found to be 
implicated in Epstein-Barr virus- and Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric cancer 
stem cells. Understanding this interplay may reveal novel treatment targets for 
gastric cancer, particularly in patients with chronic infection by these two 
pathogens. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanistic interactions 
driving the synergy between Epstein-Barr virus and Helicobacter pylori, which 
alters the biology of gastric cancer stem cells. This may provide further 
insights into early diagnosis and treatment approaches for gastric cancer.

The phase 2 PHAROS study previously showed that encorafenib plus binimetinib has 
antitumor activity in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic non-small cell 
lung cancer (mNSCLC). In PHAROS, 98 patients (59 treatment naïve; 39 previously 
treated) received encorafenib 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice 
daily. We report updated results from data cutoff of March 14, 2025. The median 
duration of treatment with both encorafenib and binimetinib was 16.3 months in 
treatment-naïve and 5.5 months in previously treated patients. After median 
follow-up for OS of 52.3 months in treatment-naïve patients, mOS was 47.6 months 
(95% CI, 31.3 to not estimable); 4-year OS probability was 49% (95% CI, 35 to 
62). After median follow-up for OS of 48.2 months in previously treated 
patients, mOS was 22.7 months (95% CI, 14.1 to 32.6); 4-year OS probability was 
31% (95% CI, 16 to 47). In treatment-naïve and previously treated groups, 58% 
and 26% received ≥1 subsequent systemic anticancer treatment, respectively. 
Safety profile remained consistent with that in prior analyses. While 
comparisons across trials should be done cautiously, encorafenib plus 
binimetinib was associated with the the longest mOS reported to date with 
targeted treatment in patients with treatment-naïve BRAF V600E-mutant mNSCLC.

The sodium iodide symporter (NIS) mediates iodine uptake into thyroid follicular 
cells providing the basis for radioiodine imaging and therapy of differentiated 
thyroid cancer. Loss of functional NIS expression leads to 
radioiodine-refractory disease. Restoration of radioiodine uptake via NIS 
delivery into tumors using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represents a 
therapeutic strategy for radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. 
This study exploits transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) biology in 
radioiodine-refractory BRAFV600E-mutant papillary thyroid cancer to selectively 
drive NIS transgene expression in engineered MSCs using a synthetic 
TGF-β1-inducible SMAD-responsive promoter (SMAD-NIS-MSCs) to reestablish 
radioiodine accumulation. 125I uptake assay confirmed stimulation of functional 
NIS expression in SMAD-NIS-MSCs through TGF-β1 released from BRAFV600E-mutant 
papillary thyroid cancer cell lines (BCPAP, K1) from co-culture or by incubation 
with tumor-conditioned medium. Chemotaxis assays showed directed chemotaxis of 
MSCs towards BCPAP- and K1-tumor-conditioned medium. SMAD-NIS-MSCs applied 
intravenously to mice harboring BCPAP or K1 xenografts followed by 
123I-scintigraphy demonstrated tumor-specific MSC recruitment and radioiodine 
accumulation. Application of SMAD-NIS-MSCs followed by 131I demonstrated a 
significant delay in tumor growth with prolonged survival. We demonstrate 
re-establishment of NIS-mediated radioiodine therapy in radioiodine-refractory 
BRAFV600E-mutant papillary thyroid cancer tumors using MSC-mediated NIS gene 
delivery driven by their TGF-β1 biology.

BACKGROUND Accurate spatial correlation between preoperative prostate MRI and 
post-prostatectomy histopathology is critical for improving prostate cancer 
diagnosis, treatment planning, and MRI interpretation. Current manual 
registration methods are time-consuming and subjective, creating a need for 
robust, automated solutions. MATERIAL AND METHODS We developed an unsupervised 
deep learning model, Squeeze-and-Excitation ResNet with Thin-Plate Spline 
Transformation (SE-ResNet-TPS), for deformable registration of in vivo prostate 
MRI and ex vivo whole-mount histopathology images. The model learns feature 
correspondence directly from unlabeled image pairs, eliminating dependency on 
large annotated datasets. It integrates multi-scale convolutional kernels within 
a ResNet architecture and incorporates a channel attention mechanism 
(Squeeze-and-Excitation) to enhance sensitivity to diagnostically relevant 
features. A thin-plate spline (TPS) transformation module is employed to model 
complex global and local deformations between the inherently different 
modalities. RESULTS The SE-ResNet-TPS model was rigorously evaluated. It 
achieved an overall Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.964 and a Hausdorff 
distance (HD) of 2.91, indicating excellent anatomical alignment between the 
registered MRI and histopathology images. For cancer-specific regions of 
interest, where registration is most challenging, the model yielded a DSC of 
0.578 and an HD of 4.97, demonstrating significant capability in aligning 
clinically critical areas despite modality differences and tissue processing 
artifacts. CONCLUSIONS The proposed SE-ResNet-TPS framework provides highly 
accurate, unsupervised registration of prostate MRI and histopathology images. 
Its performance, particularly in aligning overall anatomy, confirms its 
effectiveness for multimodal prostate image fusion. While cancer-specific 
alignment presents greater challenges, the results are promising. This model has 
strong potential to enhance the precision of prostate cancer localization on 
MRI, ultimately supporting radiologists in diagnosis and targeted biopsy 
guidance.

BACKGROUND: Multimodal care, including nutritional support, physical exercise, 
and pain management, is essential to address complex therapeutic challenges in 
advanced pancreatic cancer. There is an increasing prevalence worldwide in 
pancreatic cancer and the disease is often diagnosed late leading to limited 
treatment options and poor prognosis. Advanced pancreatic cancer patients 
experience a wide range of adverse symptoms that affect their quality of life 
and require comprehensive and interdisciplinary patient care early in treatment. 
Integrating digital health, particularly through remote monitoring, plays a 
vital role in addressing the therapeutic challenges and improving data-driven 
clinical decision-making. Therefore, the European project RELEVIUM examines the 
effect of a personalized, digitally assisted multimodal supportive care 
intervention on health-related quality of life in patients with pancreatic 
cancer aiming to improve early access to multidisciplinary, cost-effective 
palliative care.
METHODS: In cancer centers in Estonia, Israel, and Germany, 132 patients will be 
randomly assigned in the prospective randomized controlled trial RELEVIUM-RCT 
into two groups. Both groups receive standard chemotherapy. The control group 
follows usual care, while the intervention group receives personalized, 
digitally assisted multimodal support integrated into usual care. The 
intervention includes guidance and monitoring on pain, nutrition, fatigue, 
sarcopenia, and physical activity. Patients track their physical activities, 
nutritional behavior and rate pain and fatigue daily via a smartwatch and mobile 
app. The physician analyses these longitudinal data on a dashboard and counsels 
the patients every two weeks during clinical visits, assisted by an 
interdisciplinary team and digital support system. The primary endpoint of the 
study is health-related quality of life including factors such as time until a 
definitive deterioration in selected dimensions (physical functioning and/or 
appetite loss) assessed at 8 weeks. Secondary endpoints include longitudinal 
analyses of efficacy related to pain, physical function, nutrition, sarcopenia, 
and socioeconomic factors.
DISCUSSION: The RELEVIUM-RCT investigates the efficacy of digital health support 
for individuals with advanced pancreatic cancer in conjunction with conventional 
treatments in three European countries. Longitudinal data on the interplay of 
chemotherapy toxicity, fatigue, pain, physical activity, and nutrition will 
provide valuable extended insights on multimodal pancreatic cancer care. 
Moreover, this data can help demonstrate the benefits of digital health in 
clinical decision-making, ultimately contributing to improved quality of care in 
Europe.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent malignancies in 
men, often progressing to castration-resistant forms and resisting conventional 
therapies. Curcumin, a polyphenol from Curcuma longa, has emerged as a potent 
anti-cancer agent by modulating several molecular pathways.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review seeks to synthesize current preclinical 
evidence on the molecular mechanisms underlying curcumin's effects in PCa and to 
evaluate nanoformulation strategies developed to enhance its pharmacokinetics 
and therapeutic efficacy.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of five major databases up to March 1, 2025 
identified 22 eligible studies on curcumin and PCa. Data on molecular pathways, 
therapeutic outcomes, and delivery systems were extracted and assessed using 
ToxRTool and SYRCLE guidelines.
RESULTS: Curcumin modulated key pathways including PI3K/Akt/mTOR (8 studies), 
NF-κB (7), AR signaling (6), and apoptosis-related regulators (13). Therapeutic 
outcomes included apoptosis, necroptosis, cell cycle arrest, and suppression of 
migration and angiogenesis. Nanoformulations (e.g., Theracurmin®, PLGA-curcumin) 
demonstrated improved bioavailability and tumor-targeted delivery. Synergistic 
combinations with docetaxel, quercetin, or phototherapy enhanced its anti-cancer 
effects.
CONCLUSION: Curcumin exerts multi-targeted anticancer effects in PCa models, but 
clinical translation is hindered by poor bioavailability. Advanced 
nanoformulations and rational combination therapies offer promising strategies 
to overcome these limitations. Clinical trials evaluating optimized curcumin 
delivery systems in well-defined PCa populations are strongly recommended.

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M (hnRNPM) is an RNA-binding protein 
that is aberrantly expressed in tumorigenesis. However, the alternative splicing 
regulation by hnRNPM in human colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. Herein, we 
observed that hnRNPM was highly expressed in CRC tissues. The knockdown of 
hnRNPM inhibited the proliferation of colon cancer cells both in vivo and in 
vitro. Using RNA-seq, we screened and identified several alternative splicing 
events regulated by hnRNPM. Knockdown of PLEKHB2-S splice isoform could reduce 
the growth of colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, predicting its role in 
malignant proliferation of colon cancer cells. Mechanically, the minigene 
reporter assay indicated the predominant regulatory roles of hnRNPM in PLEKHB2 
splicing. The in vivo crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) assay demonstrated 
the direct binding of the RNA recognition motif RRM2 of hnRNPM protein to exon 9 
of PLEKHB2 pre-mRNA. HnRNPM facilitated the skipping of alternative exon 8 in 
PLEKHB2 by binding to the constitutive exon 9. Furthermore, we developed 
cationic microbubbles shRNA/CMBs and transferred to colon cancer cells via 
ultrasound-targeted microbubble disruption (UTMD). The size and zeta potentials 
of CMBs and shRNA-CMBs were measured and the optimal concentration range of 
shRNA/CMBs were screened with low cytotoxicity. The introduction of 
sh-hnRNPM/CMBs or sh-PLEKHB2-S/CMBs suppressed the proliferation of colon cancer 
cells in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings identify that hnRNPM 
dysregulates colorectal carcinoma proliferation at the molecular level of 
splicing regulation and predicate sh-hnRNPM/CMBs and its splicing target 
sh-PLEKHB2-S/CMBs as promising therapeutic drugs and innovative strategies for 
treating colorectal cancer. Schematic diagram of the functions of UTMD mediated 
sh-hnRNPM/CMBs in colorectal cancer and emerging mechanism by which hnRNPM 
promotes the malignant proliferation of CRC by regulating the alternative 
splicing of PLEKHB2 pre-mRNA. The picture was created with BioRender.com.

BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence in cancer neuroscience indicates that the nervous 
system interacts directly or indirectly with cancer cells, promoting tumor 
progression. The prostate gland contains an extensive neural network essential 
for regulating key physiological functions of prostate cells, and the 
significant neural distribution observed in prostate cancer highlights its 
critical role in driving cancer pathogenesis. Unfortunately, Comprehensive 
reviews systematically summarizing progress in cancer neuroscience for prostate 
cancer are currently lacking.
METHOD: We synthesize existing research on interactions between the nervous 
system and prostate cancer cells, explore the neural distribution within the 
prostate, and evaluate the impact of neural innervation on prostate cancer 
development and progression. Additionally, we also assess the potential neural 
regulation mechanisms in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC).
RESULT: We found that neural interactions significantly influence prostate 
cancer development. Neural circuitry within the tumor microenvironment drives 
progression and contributes to the aggressiveness of lethal subtypes like NEPC. 
Targeting neuromodulation emerges as a promising therapeutic approach, 
potentially allowing the repurposing of established medications for treating 
advanced tumors.
CONCLUSION: Neuromodulation offers a promising therapeutic option for advanced 
prostate cancer, particularly NEPC, which faces limited treatment options. 
However, further research is necessary to fully understand the neural regulatory 
mechanisms involved in prostate cancer development and to identify new 
therapeutic targets and strategies for advanced stages.

Dual inhibition of T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domain 
(TIGIT) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) may enhance antitumor 
immunity in advanced gastroesophageal cancers. Here we report the EDGE-Gastric 
study, an ongoing, multicenter, international, phase 2 study with three cohorts, 
one in the first-line setting (cohort A) and two in the second-line or greater 
setting (cohorts B and C). Cohort A comprises four arms: two nonrandomized (A1 
and A2) and two randomized (A3 and A4). In arm A1, presented here, dual blockade 
of TIGIT and PD-1 with domvanalimab (Fc-silent anti-TIGIT) and zimberelimab 
(anti-PD-1) plus oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil (FOLFOX) was evaluated in 
patients with previously untreated advanced HER2-negative gastric, 
gastroesophageal junction or esophageal adenocarcinoma. Among 41 treated 
patients, the confirmed objective response rate was 59% (90% confidence interval 
(CI) 44.5-71.6%), median progression-free survival was 12.9 months (90% CI 
9.8-14.6 months) and median overall survival was 26.7 months (90% CI 18.4 months 
to not estimable (NE)). In patients with tumor area positivity ≥1% (PD-L1 
positive) and tumor area positivity ≥5% (PD-L1 high), respectively, the 
objective response rate was 62% (90% CI 45.1-77.1%) and 69% (90% CI 45.2-86.8%), 
median progression-free survival was 13.2 months (90% CI 11.3-15.2 months) and 
14.5 months (90% CI 11.3 months-NE), and median overall survival was 26.7 months 
(90% CI 19.5 months-NE) and not reached (90% CI 17.4 months-NE). Immune-related 
adverse events were reported in 27% of patients; the safety profile was 
consistent with that reported for anti-PD-1 plus platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Dual TIGIT and PD-1 blockade with domvanalimab and zimberelimab plus 
chemotherapy demonstrated encouraging efficacy, and the regimen is being 
evaluated in the phase 3 STAR-221 trial. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: 
NCT05329766 .

The optimal cut-off values of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor 
(PgR) expression to define the positivity of ER and PgR have been under 
discussion for over a decade but remain controversial. The American Society of 
Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) and the St. Gallen 
International Expert Consensus recommended that breast cancers with ≥1% of ER or 
PgR expression should be considered hormone receptor (HR)-positive tumors but 
ER/PR expression of 1% to 10% should be reported as HR-low positive; however, 
among HER2-negative disease, data on the overall benefit of adjuvant endocrine 
therapies for patients with HR-low positive disease is limited, resulting in the 
revisiting of the definition of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Defining 
HR-low positive disease by better understanding the biology is essential because 
of the recent advancement of neoadjuvant and adjuvant systemic therapy 
strategies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for TNBC. 
Additionally, identifying who should be treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy, 
particularly those who have HR-low HER2-negative disease, which is currently 
treated as TNBC without adjuvant endocrine therapy, is a clinical unmet need. In 
clinical practice, treating physicians have tailored systemic treatment 
strategies using other clinical and pathological factors (i.e., age, grade, 
Ki-67, tumor size, lymph node involvement). There is no universal practice to 
treat patients with HR-low HER2-negative breast cancer. This review summarized 
the currently available data to define the clinically relevant optimal cut-off 
values of ER/PgR in neoadjuvant- and adjuvant-setting. We recommend considering 
creating a novel category of triple-negative like breast cancer (TN-like BC), 
which will require a therapeutic strategy different from conventional TNBC.

Cancer represents a significant global health concern, profoundly affecting 
morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Due to cancer-associated genetic 
changes, cancer cells harbor neoantigens (Tumor-Specific Antigens). They are 
attractive targets for personalized and generalized cancer therapeutics, 
including cancer vaccines, T cell adoptive therapy, and immunomonitoring. Such 
antigens can arise at genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic levels. The host 
immune system recognizes neoantigens through their presentation on Major 
Histocompatibility Complexes (MHC), leading to T cell activation and antitumor 
response, provided sufficient co-stimulatory signals are provided by 
antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic cells. Computational tools for 
neoantigen analysis are rapidly advancing, improving prediction accuracy. 
Bioinformatics tools aid in identifying somatic mutations and selecting 
neoantigens based on MHC binding and immunogenicity scores. Cost-efficient 
computational Human Leukocyte Antigen haplotyping uses sequencing data, while 
proteogenomic strategies, integrating immunopeptidomics, validate neoantigens by 
detecting peptides naturally presented by tumor cells. Integrating 
proteome-based validation provides experimental confirmation, strengthening 
confidence in predictions. Ongoing developments in bioinformatics and 
multi-omics integration contribute to neoantigen identification, enabling 
personalized cancer immunotherapies. This review discusses various computational 
tools/pipelines, their implementation, clinical trials on neoantigenic vaccines, 
and the limitations/prospects of neoantigen prediction.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the performance of a deep learning model 
using multimodal imaging for detecting lymph node metastasis in esophageal 
cancer in comparison to expert assessments.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for 521 lymph nodes from 167 
patients with esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy. Deep learning 
models were developed based on multimodal imaging, including 
non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography, contrast-enhanced computed 
tomography, and positron emission tomography imaging. The diagnostic performance 
was evaluated and compared with expert assessments using a receiver operating 
characteristic curve analysis.
RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values for 
the deep learning model were 0.81 with multimodal imaging, 0.73 with 
non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography, 0.72 with contrast-enhanced computed 
tomography, and 0.75 with positron emission tomography were calculated. The area 
under the curve of the deep learning model (0.81) demonstrated diagnostic 
performance comparable to that of experienced experts (area under the curve, 
0.84; P = 0.62, DeLong's test).
CONCLUSION: The multimodal deep learning model using computed tomography and 
positron emission tomography demonstrated performance comparable to that of 
experts in diagnosing the presence of lymph node metastasis, a key prognostic 
factor in esophageal cancer, suggesting its potential clinical utility.

BACKGROUND: The survival impact of open esophagectomy (OE) versus thoracoscopic 
esophagectomy (TE) in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) 
based on tumor location remains debated. This study employs energy balancing 
weights (EBW) to compare long-term survival between OE and TE across tumor 
locations.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This ambispective cohort study analyzed 1778 patients with 
ESCC undergoing OE or TE at a tertiary hospital between January 2015 and 
December 2016. Primary endpoints were 5-year overall survival (OS) and 
disease-free survival (DFS); secondary endpoints included operative safety. 
EBW-adjusted Cox regression was used to compare long-term survival, with 
sensitivity analyses via inverse probability of treatment weighting and matching 
weight methods.
RESULTS: The median survival times for upper, middle, and lower tumor locations 
were 60.06, 60.48, and 64.35 months, respectively. Compared with OE, the Cox 
regression analysis of TE showed that in the upper group, the HR was 0.45 (95% 
CI 0.27-0.75) for OS and the HR was 0.55 (0.34-0.89) for DFS. In the middle 
group, theHR was 0.64 (0.48-0.85) for OS and the HR was 0.70 (0.53-0.91) for 
DFS. And in the lower group, the HR was 0.70 (0.44-1.11) for OS and the HR was 
0.67 (0.43-1.04) for DFS. Additionally, TE was associated with reduced blood 
loss and increased lymph node yield but had longer operative times and higher 
costs (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: TE improved survival and safety in upper/middle ESCC, while lower 
tumor locations require individualized approaches. EBW enhanced confounder 
control, supporting reliable clinical decisions.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the characteristics, causes, and risk factors of 
perioperative mortality (POM) in patients undergoing surgery for head and neck 
cancer (HNC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of HNC patients treated between 1999 and 
2024 were reviewed. Sixty-six patients who experienced POM were identified and 
compared with 132 matched controls (matched for tumor site, stage, and type of 
surgery). Data included demographics, comorbidities, tumor features, treatment 
history, perioperative management, and causes of death. POM causes were 
categorized as surgical, medical, mixed, or personal. Risk factors were assessed 
using univariate and multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: Among 198 patients (66 POM, 132 controls), those with POM were older, 
had more comorbidities, advanced disease, and prior radiotherapy. They also 
showed higher ASA grades, longer operations, greater blood loss, and more 
frequent tracheotomy (all p < 0.05). Most deaths occurred postoperatively, with 
medical complications predominating. Independent predictors of POM were 
comorbidities, advanced stage, ASA grade <III, blood loss >600 ml, and 
tracheotomy.
CONCLUSION: Perioperative mortality in HNC surgery results from multifactorial 
causes, with both surgical and medical complications contributing significantly. 
Identifying high-risk patients based on preoperative status and operative 
parameters may help optimize perioperative care and reduce mortality.

Colonoscopy screening effectively identifies and removes polyps before they 
progress to colorectal cancer (CRC), but current follow-up guidelines rely 
primarily on histopathological features, overlooking other important CRC risk 
factors. Variability in polyp characterization among pathologists also hinders 
consistent surveillance decisions. Advances in digital pathology and deep 
learning enable the integration of pathology slides and medical records for more 
accurate progression risk prediction. Using data from the New Hampshire 
Colonoscopy Registry, including longitudinal follow-up, a transformer-based 
model for histopathology image analysis was adapted to predict 5-year 
progression risk. Multi-modal fusion strategies were further explored to combine 
clinical records with deep learning-derived image features. Training the model 
to predict intermediate clinical variables improved 5-year progression risk 
prediction (AUC = 0.630) compared to direct prediction (AUC = 0.615, p = 0.013). 
Integrating WSI-based model predictions with non-imaging features further 
improved performance (AUC = 0.672), significantly outperforming the 
non-imaging-only approach (AUC = 0.666, p = 0.002). These results highlight the 
value of integrating diverse data modalities with computational methods to 
enhance progression risk stratification.

The TET family of enzymes is essential for the dynamic regulation of DNA 
methylation and the epigenetic landscape of human genomes. Their ability to 
oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into various hydroxymethylated derivatives 
facilitates active DNA demethylation and serves as a critical regulatory 
mechanism in normal cellular processes. Dysregulation of TET proteins has been 
implicated in multiple types of cancer, highlighting their significance in 
tumorigenesis and their potential for therapeutic targeting. The functionality 
of TET proteins continues to be widely studied across various tissues and 
contexts. Their role as novel drug targets in cancer therapy is attracting 
increasing attention. Understanding how TET enzymes contribute to epigenetic 
alterations could provide new insights into cancer prevention and treatment, 
potentially extending the window of effective therapeutic intervention. This 
review aims to explore the diverse roles and regulatory mechanisms of TET 
proteins, examine how their dysregulation promotes cancer progression, and 
underscore the potential of TET enzymes as druggable targets for anticancer 
therapy.

Cancer cells are often exposed to a hypoxic environment due to indiscriminate 
proliferation and incomplete vasculature formation. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 
(HIF-1), which is induced by a hypoxic environment, promotes tumor malignancy by 
regulating cancer cell metabolism, metastasis, angiogenesis, and cancer stem 
cell formation. Previous studies have demonstrated increased activation of 
HIF-1-induced signaling pathways in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). 
Therefore, a hypoxic environment or hypoxia-induced genes are considered as 
attractive therapeutic targets for TNBC. We have previously identified CCN3 as a 
novel player in the cancer progression of TNBC. In this study, using public 
databases and cell lines with altered CCN3 expression, we found that CCN3 
expression and hypoxia gene expression signatures were positively correlated, 
and that HIF1α and HIF1α target gene expression were regulated by CCN3. 
Furthermore, the induction of HIF1α by CCN3 was regulated at the 
post-transcriptional level, mainly by IMP3-mediated modulation of mRNA stability 
and translation of HIF1α. Additionally, we found that HIF1α directly regulates 
expression of CCN3 by binding to the promoter region of CCN3. This CCN3-HIF1α 
positive feedback loop may play an important role in HIF1α-induced tumorigenesis 
in TNBC and be involved in the metastasis of TNBC cells.

Purpose of this document. The Oncology Committee of the French Urology 
Association (CCAFU) is proposing a 2025 summary of recommendations' changes for 
the management of prostate cancer (PCa).
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature from July 2024 to September 2025 
was conducted by the CCAFU on the evolutions of diagnostic and therapeutic 
management of PCa evaluating the newly published references with their level of 
evidence.
RESULTS: Biparametric MRI is an alternative to multiparametric MRI imaging to 
guide biopsy decision making provided that a high-quality imaging and radiology 
expertise is achieved. Transperineal biopsy is the recommended approach when 
technically feasible. Whole-gland HIFU in patients fulfilling the HIFI trial 
criteria is a treatment option for intermediate-risk PCa patients. In case of 
metastasis-directed therapy outside the context of symptoms for oligometastatic 
hormone-sensitive PCa (mHSPC) disease, at least 6 months of androgen deprivation 
therapy (ADT) should be given. In patients with high-risk BCR treated according 
to the EMBARK criteria, systemic treatment with monotherapy enzalutamide may be 
considered. The ARPI used in addition to ADT alone can be: abiraterone, 
apalutamide, darolutamide, enzalutamide. In the case of HRR alterations, the 
combination of niraparib and abiraterone may be proposed as first-line mHSPC. In 
the case of a positive radiolabelled PSMA ligand PET/CT scan in a patient 
progressing after at least one ARPI, internal radiotherapy using [177 
Lu]LuPSMA-617 may be proposed. In patients with no or mildly symptomatic bone 
metastatic castration-resistant PCa without visceral metastases, the combination 
of enzalutamide + 6 cycles of Radium-223 may be proposed.
CONCLUSION: This 2025 summary of changes of French recommendations on PCa should 
help physicians to stay up-to-date with recent evolutions and aim to improve the 
management of PCa patients.

INTRODUCTION: Non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) 
progresses despite androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) however metastases remain 
undetectable on conventional imaging. PSMA PET/CT may enable earlier metastasis 
detection, but its clinical use remains limited. This study assessed the 
alignment of French clinical practices with nmCRPC management guidelines.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A two-part survey was conducted among 61 healthcare 
professionals, including urologists, oncologists, and radiation oncologists, to 
assess their imaging and treatment approaches for nmCRPC. The survey explored 
diagnostic imaging strategies, treatment decisions, and responses to two 
clinical case scenarios reflecting different PSA doubling times.
RESULTS: Results showed variation, with 65% of respondents initiating 
enzalutamide only after conventional imaging confirmed metastases, while 57% 
would do so after molecular imaging detection. PSMA PET/CT was used by 41% for 
patients with a 6-month PSA doubling time. Treatment decisions were influenced 
by both imaging modality and PSA kinetics. In clinical case 1 (6-month PSA 
doubling time), 41% chose TAP CT or bone scan as initial imaging, 35% used [18 
F] fluorocholine/[18 F] fluciclovine PET/CT, and 24% used PSMA PET/CT. In 
clinical case 2 (12-month PSA doubling time), 66% ordered imaging, while 29% 
favored monitoring without imaging. Imaging delays varied from 3 to 4 weeks, 
reflecting regional disparities in access.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: This study highlights variability between guideline 
recommendations and clinical practice in nmCRPC management in France. Although 
PSMA PET/CT is crucial for detecting metastases, its cost and accessibility 
remain suboptimal and require further improvement, despite recent advancements. 
Clearer guidelines and improved training are needed to reduce inconsistencies 
and avoid loss of therapeutic opportunity for patients.

In this case‒control study conducted at Cairo's National Cancer Institute, the 
associations between bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC), 
and ovarian cancer were investigated. BPA levels in the urine, oxidative stress 
markers (reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity), 
and KRT4 gene expression were analyzed in 30 patients and 30 controls. 
Significant risk factors for BPA exposure included consuming microwave meals, 
consuming canned beverages, using PVC food storage, eating fast food, handling 
thermal paper, exposure to dust, and recurrent hospitalizations (all p < 0.001). 
Compared with normal controls, ovarian cancer patients presented increased BPA 
levels, ROS, and KRT4 expression, along with reduced SOD activity (p < 0.001). A 
strong positive correlation was found between BPA and KRT4, suggesting that KRT4 
is a potential biomarker. The cutoff values for urinary BPA and KRT4 achieved 
100% sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing patients from controls. These 
findings suggest that BPA plays a role in ovarian cancer pathogenesis, likely 
through oxidative stress and gene dysregulation. This study emphasizes the 
importance of minimizing BPA exposure (e.g., by reducing the use of canned or 
packaged foods) and calls for larger studies to further investigate the role of 
EDCs in hormone-dependent cancers.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the application of fertility preservation counseling and 
sperm cryopreservation amongst reproductive-aged males diagnosed with testicular 
cancer using a population-level analysis.
METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 16-49-year-olds diagnosed with testicular 
cancer and treated with orchiectomy between 2015-2025 using a large claims 
database, TriNetX. Primary outcomes were rates of fertility preservation 
counseling and sperm cryopreservation within 180 days of testicular cancer 
diagnosis (90 days before - 90 days after). We secondarily assessed rates of 
utilization within 90 days prior to orchiectomy, demographic differences in 
utilization, and whether receiving care at an academic center is associated with 
utilization. Academic and non-academic cohorts were propensity score matched for 
age, race, ethnicity, and compared using risk ratios. Z-testing and T-testing 
were used to compare categorical and continuous baseline characteristics, 
respectively.
RESULTS: Between 2015-2025, of 5,907 16-49-year-olds diagnosed with testicular 
cancer and treated with orchiectomy, 563 (9.53%) underwent fertility 
preservation counseling and 498 (8.43%) underwent sperm cryopreservation within 
180 days of diagnosis. 247 (4.18%) patients underwent FP and 286 (4.84%) 
underwent SC within 90 days prior to orchiectomy. Significantly more white 
patients and significantly younger patients underwent these services compared to 
those who did not. Those from academic centers were significantly more likely to 
undergo fertility preservation counseling (5.82% vs. 0.98%, RR=5.91, 95% 
CI=[3.14, 11.14]) and sperm cryopreservation (5.64% vs. 0%).
CONCLUSIONS: We found low utilization of fertility preservation counseling and 
sperm cryopreservation in a large, national cohort of reproductive-aged 
testicular cancer patients, with differences in utilization regarding patient 
demographics and practice setting.
DATA STATEMENT: The data that support the findings in this study are available

BACKGROUND: Primary liver cancer (PLC) remains a major public health concern, 
particularly in China where the incidence is high. Existing prediction models 
often focus on high-risk populations and depend heavily on laboratory data, 
which limits their utility in general population screening.
METHODS: We developed and validated a 15-year PLC risk prediction model using 
data from two large prospective cohort studies in Shanghai (n = 132,360), 
including 618 incident PLC cases. Candidate variables encompassed 
sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviors, medical history, and 
dietary factors. Predictor selection was performed using LASSO regression and 
the Boruta algorithm. Five machine learning models and logistic regression were 
compared. Model performance was evaluated using AUC, calibration plots and net 
reclassification improvement (NRI). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were 
used to interpret model predictions. Web-based tools, including a simplified 
risk calculator, were developed to facilitate practical application.
RESULTS: LightGBM achieved the best discrimination (AUC = 0.766) and excellent 
calibration. Net reclassification analysis indicated an improved ability to 
correctly classify low-risk individuals. The model effectively stratified the 
population: the high-risk group had a 15-year PLC risk that was 39.56 times that 
of the low-risk group. SHAP analysis revealed biologically meaningful 
associations. A simplified logistic model with fewer variables also performed 
well (AUC = 0.762), supporting effective risk stratification.
CONCLUSION: We developed a questionnaire-based 15-year PLC risk prediction model 
applicable to the general Chinese population. Both the full and simplified 
models demonstrated strong performance and interpretability, making them 
valuable tools for large-scale screening and targeted prevention, especially in 
resource-limited settings.

BACKGROUND: HR+/HER2+ breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease with low 
pathological complete response (pCR) to standard neoadjuvant treatment. CDK4/6 
inhibitors with endocrine and anti-HER2 therapy have shown a potential for 
chemotherapy omission in this context.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: TOUCH is an international, open-label, phase II trial for 
postmenopausal patients with cT>1 cm, cN0 or cN1, HR+/HER2+ BC, randomized to 16 
weeks of neoadjuvant weekly paclitaxel or palbociclib and letrozole, both with 
trastuzumab+pertuzumab (HP). The primary objective investigated the interaction 
between a gene-signature of E2F-pathway-activity (RBsig) and pCR (ypT0N0 or 
ypTisN0), hypothesizing higher pCR for RBsig high tumors in the paclitaxel+HP 
group, and for RBsig low tumors in the palbociclib+letrozole+HP group. RBsig was 
assessed by RNA-sequencing from pre-treatment biopsies; intrinsic subtypes were 
estimated by AIMS. Treatment-by-biomarker interaction was estimated using 
logistic regression in 115 assessable patients.
RESULTS: 147 patients were randomized (74 paclitaxel+HP, 73 
palbociclib+letrozole+HP) and 145 constituted the treated population, with a 
median age of 69 years (IQR 63,73). More patients completed palbociclib vs 
paclitaxel (94.4% vs 79.5%). The most frequent grade 3-4 adverse events were 
neutropenia and diarrhea (6.9% vs 43.1% and 11% vs 8.3% in the paclitaxel+HP vs 
the palbociclib+letrozole+HP groups, respectively). pCR rate was: 32.9% (95% CI: 
22.3%-44.9%) in the paclitaxel+HP group and 33.3% (95% CI: 22.7%-45.4%) in the 
palbociclib+letrozole+HP group. No significant treatment-by-RBsig interaction 
was observed (p=0.18): pCR in RBsig high vs low was 31.3% (95% CI: 16.1%-50.0%) 
vs 42.3% (95% CI: 23.4%-63.1%) in the paclitaxel+HP group, and 38.5% (95% CI: 
20.2%-59.4%) vs 25.8% (95% CI: 11.9%-44.6%) in the palbociclib group. pCR was 
higher in non-luminal vs luminal subtypes (45.5% vs 18.4%), with no interaction 
with treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary hypothesis was not supported, TOUCH shows that 
dual anti-HER2 blockade with a chemotherapy-free backbone of 
palbociclib+letrozole yields pCR rates similar to paclitaxel, representing an 
attractive alternative treatment strategy.

Colorectal cancer ranks as the third most prevalent cancer globally, with its 
incidence increasing in many developed countries. While chemotherapy 
demonstrates efficacy for certain patients, it is associated with significant 
side effects, and prolonged treatment may result in drug resistance. 
Consequently, this study synthesized Bi2S3 nanosheets via the solution-based 
method and integrated them with mesoporous silica exhibiting excellent pore 
channel properties to develop the Bi2S3@mSiO2-PEG/5-FU nanomaterials. 
Photothermal testing revealed that Bi2S3@mSiO2-PEG/5-FU exhibited superior 
photothermal heating performance, remarkable photothermal stability, and a 
photothermal conversion efficiency of 28.3%, enabling effective photothermal 
therapy. The drug loading capacity of Bi2S3@mSiO2-PEG/5-FU was determined to be 
24.8%, with enhanced drug release under acidic conditions and laser irradiation, 
thereby improving chemotherapeutic efficacy and achieving synergistic effects 
between chemotherapy and photothermal therapy. Furthermore, Bi2S3@mSiO2-PEG 
demonstrated robust CT imaging capabilities (14.95 HU mg/mL), establishing the 
Bi2S3@mSiO2-PEG/5-FU nanomaterials as a platform with integrated diagnostic and 
therapeutic functionalities.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Local recurrence (LR) after surgery for metastatic spine 
cancer (MSC) is a challenging complication, and evidence guiding optimal 
retreatment strategies remains limited.
PURPOSE: To evaluate prognosis following retreatment for LR after surgery for 
MSC, compare treatment outcomes based on retreatment modality, and identify risk 
factors associated with retreatment failure.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A multicenter retrospective cohort study.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Ninety-nine patients from four tertiary hospitals who developed 
symptomatic LR after surgery for MSC and underwent reoperation or radiation 
therapy (RT).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Motor grade, pain visual analog scale (VAS) score, ambulatory 
function, retreatment failure rate, and overall survival after LR diagnosis were 
assessed.
METHODS: Patients were grouped based on retreatment modality into reoperation 
(n=36), RT (n=38), and conservative management (n=25) groups. Conservative 
management included symptomatic care for LR without surgery or RT, with or 
without systemic treatments such as chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. 
Retreatment failure was defined as symptom progression despite treatment or 
recurrence after initial improvement. Clinical outcomes were compared among the 
groups, and logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated 
with retreatment failure.
RESULTS: Reoperation significantly improved motor grade (p=0.041) and pain VAS 
score (p=0.002), whereas RT and conservative treatment showed no significant 
improvement. Ambulatory status decreased significantly in the RT group (p=0.031) 
but was preserved in the reoperation group. Retreatment failure occurred in 
41.9% of patients (15/36 after reoperation, 16/38 after RT; p=0.414) and was 
associated with increased pain (p=0.042) and reduced ambulation (p=0.012). The 
only significant predictor of retreatment failure was a shorter interval between 
initial surgery and LR (odds ratio, 0.953; p=0.045). A cutoff of 12.5 months was 
predictive of retreatment failure (area under the curve, 0.713; p=0.056).
CONCLUSIONS: Only reoperation resulted in significant functional improvement 
after retreatment for LR. RT was associated with decreased ambulatory function 
and did not provide significant symptom relief. Retreatment failure was common 
and associated with increased pain and diminished function. A significant 
predictor of retreatment failure was a shorter interval-less than 12.5 
months-between the initial surgery and LR. These findings highlight the 
importance of patient selection and the limited utility of retreatment in 
aggressive or early-recurrent cases.

Gastric cancer remains a formidable global health challenge, with drug 
resistance being a primary contributor to its high mortality rates. Therefore, 
understanding the mechanisms driving drug resistance is crucial for developing 
more effective therapeutic interventions. Utilizing high content screening 
technology, we identified let-7e-5p and miR-125a-5p as the key regulators of 
drug resistance in GC, both being members of the miR-99b cluster. Findings from 
GC cells, organoids and PDX models demonstrated that overexpression of the 
miR-99b cluster sensitized GC to cisplatin, likely through its inhibitory 
effects on mitochondrial respiratory function, particularly OXPHOS. We further 
demonstrated that multiple components, especially SDHC subunit of respiratory 
complex II, was regulated by miR-99b cluster and played critical role in GC 
chemoresistance. Then, through a comprehensive screen of epigenetic compounds, 
weidentified KMT5A as a key upstream repressor of the miR-99b cluster in GC, 
which reinforces the H4K20me1 modification within the miR-99b cluster region. 
Moreover, elevated KMT5A expression and decreased miR-125a-5p expression 
indicated both poorer prognosis and chemo-resistance in patients with GC. This 
study highlights the multifaceted roles of the miR-99b cluster in GC and offers 
novel perspectives for the development of innovative therapeutics aimed at 
overcoming chemoresistance and enhancing treatment efficacy for GC patients.

INTRODUCTION: In breast cancer, recommendations for axillary surgery are 
currently shifting toward omitting SLNB. Studies have shown that not performing 
axillary staging has no impact on regional control or survival and translates 
into improved quality of life. We sought to determine whether certain clinical 
factors such as tumor size or type, immunohistochemical characteristics, tumor 
grade or Ki 67 value are predictive of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted of patients who 
underwent breast cancer surgery during the years 2019-2024. Inclusion criteria 
were: tumor size equal to or less than 2 cm as measured by ultrasound, and 
axilla that was clinically and ultrasound-negative.
RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-six breasts were operated on, with a mean age of 
64.5 years. Regarding immunohistochemistry, tumor grade, and age, no differences 
were observed. However, patients with tumors >2 cm and lobular tumors did have 
greater lymph node involvement (P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: There are no variables that predict lymph node involvement before 
surgery. Today, we are not prepared to lose the information provided by SLNB, 
and part of the postoperative treatment is determined by its results.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has emerged as a pivotal gaseous signaling molecule in 
cancer therapy, demonstrating unique dose-dependent therapeutic effects that 
have established new paradigms for gas-mediated treatments. To enable precise 
H2S delivery in cancer therapy, various H2S donor compounds have been developed, 
and a range of intelligent delivery systems have been subsequently designed. 
These systems are capable of specifically accumulating at tumor sites and can 
release H2S in a controlled and responsive manner within the tumor 
microenvironment (TME). This comprehensive review systematically examines the 
fundamental physicochemical properties and multifaceted biological functions of 
H2S while providing a detailed classification of H2S donors into inorganic and 
organic categories. We further classify existing H2S delivery strategies into 
endogenous-responsive systems (e.g., pH-, GSH-, and enzyme-triggered systems) 
and exogenous-responsive approaches (e.g., light-, ultrasound-, and electric 
field-activated methods), supported by representative case studies. Above all, 
this review highlights the remarkable potential of H2S in enhancing various 
therapeutic modalities, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, thermotherapy, 
catalytic therapy, and immunotherapy, primarily through its regulatory effects 
on heat shock protein expression, catalase activity modulation, and profound TME 
remodeling, which provides valuable insights for designing next-generation H2S 
delivery systems and their combinatorial applications in cancer treatments.

We investigated the correlation between bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) 
and HPV16 viral load in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and non-cancerous 
tissues, as well as the effects of BRD4 degradation regent MZ1 on the viral 
load, proliferation and migration of cervical cancer cells. Real-time 
fluorescence quantitative PCR showed that the viral load of cervical cancer 
specimens was significantly higher than that of non-cancer specimens. 
Immunohistochemical assay showed that BRD4 expression was elevated in cervical 
cancer specimens (P<0.001) and in specimens with high viral load (P<0.0001). 
Treatment of cervical cancer cells of SiHa, HeLa and CaSki with BRD4 degradation 
regent MZ1 significantly reduced viral load and inhibited cell proliferation and 
migration. Nude mouse xenograft tumor confirmed that the tumor volume, and tumor 
weight of the MZ1-treated mice were significantly lower than those of the 
control group. Expression of BRD4 and cell proliferation molecule Ki67 in the 
tumor sections of MZ1-treated mice was significantly decreased, while apoptosis 
molecule cleaved caspase-3 expression was significantly increased. Moreover, the 
viral load in the MZ1-treated group was significantly lower than that in the 
control group. These findings suggest that BRD4 has a potential role in HPV16 
viral replication, and MZ1 has a favorable effect in inhibiting viral 
replication, increasing apoptosis and suppressing the proliferation and

Telomerase, an enzyme responsible for maintaining telomere length, plays a 
pivotal role in cellular immortality and is frequently activated in cancer 
cells. The detection of telomerase activity has emerged as a critical biomarker 
for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. This paper explores the development and 
application of advanced biosensors designed for the sensitive and specific 
detection of telomerase activity. We discuss various biosensor platforms, 
including electrochemical, optical, and nanomaterial-based systems, highlighting 
their mechanisms, advantages, and limitations. In addition, we review 
conventional methods for telomerase detection, such as the Telomeric Repeat 
Amplification Protocol (TRAP), quantitative PCR (qPCR), and Southern blotting. 
While these methods have been widely used, they present several limitations, 
including low sensitivity, time-consuming procedures, and the requirement for 
specialized equipment and expertise. The integration of nanotechnology and 
molecular recognition elements enhances the sensitivity and specificity of 
biosensors, enabling early cancer detection and monitoring of therapeutic 
responses. Furthermore, we address the challenges in translating these 
technologies from the laboratory to clinical settings and propose future 
directions for research in telomerase biosensing. This innovative approach holds 
significant promise for improving cancer diagnostics and personalized treatment 
strategies.

Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are critical regulators of stemness maintenance 
in germline cells and have emerging roles in tumorigenesis. Our previous study 
identified piR-19521 as up-regulated in colorectal cancer (CRC), with higher 
levels correlating with poorer differentiation, implicating a potential role in 
colorectal cancer stem cells (CR-CSCs). Here, we explored piR-19521's function 
in CR-CSC-like properties. In CRC tissues, piR-19521 expression positively 
correlated with CR-CSC markers and was enriched in CR-CSCs. Over-expression of 
piR-19521 enhanced CR-CSC markers expression, promoted clonogenicity, migration, 
invasion, oxaliplatin resistance in vitro, and increased tumorigenicity and 
liver metastasis in vivo. Conversely, piR-19521 inhibition suppressed CR-CSC 
markers expression and reduced tumor initiation and self-renewal. 
Mechanistically, piR-19521 up-regulated ALX4, which rescued the effects of 
piR-19521 inhibition. Notably, piR-19521 was transcribed from an active enhancer 
in HCT116 cells, and its inhibition reduced H3K27ac signals and disrupted the 
chromatin loop between the ALX4 promoter and the piR-19521-transcribing 
enhancer. piR-19521 over-expression enhanced enhancer activity and ALX4 
transcription. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that piR-19521 
reinforces CR-CSC-like properties by functioning as an enhancer RNA to promote 
ALX4 expression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in CRC.

SK (SK), a secondary plant metabolite from Lithospermum erythrorhizon, is an 
inducer of oxidative stress and a DNA Topoisomerase inhibitor with promising 
anticancer properties. However, the underlying mechanisms, especially the 
involvement of autophagy in cancer cell death, are poorly understood. Here, we 
report a novel mechanism of action that activates a noncanonical, 
Beclin1-independent but ATG5-dependent autophagy pathway triggered by oxidative 
stress in two distinct subtypes of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell 
lines: mesenchymal stem cell-like MDA-MB-231 and basal-like-1 MDA-MB-468. We 
observed that this noncanonical autophagy pathway specifically targets and 
degrades nuclear material by nucleophagy. Electron microscopy analysis of both 
cell lines revealed distinct nuclear alterations, including envelope-limited 
chromatin sheets (ELCS), nuclear buds, and micronuclei after SK treatment. 
Furthermore, numerous autophagosomes and lysosomes were found in close proximity 
to the nuclear membrane, suggesting the occurrence of nucleophagy. The 
localization of γ-H2AX in nuclear buds and micronuclei observed by confocal 
microscopy indicated cytosolic leakage of damaged DNA. Additionally, western 
blot analysis confirmed the role of the cGAS-STING pathway, which is essential 
for detecting damaged DNA in the cytosol. Inner nuclear membrane protein Lamin 
B1 was found to interact with LC3II and was subsequently degraded through the 
nucleophagy pathway. Knockout of ATG5 using CRISPR-Cas9 reduced autophagy, while 
Beclin1 knockdown did not reduce LC3II conversion, indicating that the process 
follows a noncanonical autophagy pathway that is dependent on ATG5 and 
independent of Beclin1. SK induces oxidative stress, leading to mitochondrial 
depolarization and DNA damage accumulation, which subsequently triggers 
autophagy and ultimately causes apoptotic cell death. Treatment with the ROS 
scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reduced nuclear stress, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, autophagy, and cell death, emphasizing the role of oxidative stress 
in SK-induced cell death. MDA-MB-468 cells exhibited greater sensitivity to 
SK-induced nuclear stress and cell death compared to MDA-MB-231 cells. Taken 
together, we demonstrate that SK exerts its anticancer effects in TNBC cells 
through the generation of oxidative stress and noncanonical autophagy, thus 
highlighting SK's potential for targeted anticancer therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) are 
at high risk of recurrent thrombosis and bleeding during prolonged 
anticoagulation. While full-dose direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are widely 
used, the safety and efficacy of reduced-dose regimens for extended treatment 
remain uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the safety and efficacy of reduced-dose versus full-dose 
DOACs in the extended treatment of cancer-associated VTE.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) comparing reduced- and full-dose DOACs in adults with 
active cancer and VTE. Searches were performed in PubMed, Embase, and the 
Cochrane Library. The primary outcomes were a composite of VTE recurrence, major 
bleeding, or clinically relevant non-major bleeding, and the combined risk of 
major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding.
RESULTS: Three RCTs comprising 2,361 patients were included. Two trials 
evaluated apixaban 2.5 mg versus 5 mg twice daily, and one evaluated rivaroxaban 
10 mg versus 20 mg once daily. Reduced-dose DOACs were associated with a lower 
risk of the composite outcome (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.64-0.93; p=0.006) and reduced 
bleeding (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62-0.93; p=0.008) compared to full-dose DOACs. No 
significant differences were observed in major bleeding, clinically relevant 
non-major bleeding, VTE recurrence, or all-cause mortality when analyzed 
individually.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced-dose DOACs appear as effective as full-dose regimens for 
extended treatment of cancer-associated VTE, with a lower risk of bleeding. 
These findings support their use as a safer long-term anticoagulation strategy 
in selected patients.

Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) represents a significant global public 
health challenge. The identification of biomarkers such as microsatellite 
instability (MSI) and the status of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, among 
others, provides crucial information for guiding therapeutic decisions and 
predicting prognosis. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are the treatment of 
choice for patients with deficient MMR (dMMR) or high microsatellite instability 
(MSI-H). The assessment of treatment response using iRECIST highlights two new 
patterns: pseudoprogression and hyperprogression (HP). The latter is 
characterized by rapid clinical deterioration and a doubling of tumor burden 
within less than two months. In this article, we present, which, to our 
knowledge, is the first reported case in the literature of a patient with mCRC 
who developed HP after receiving nivolumab/ipilimumab treatment. Although 
various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, no clear 
predictive factors have been identified to date. Prospective studies are needed 
to anticipate the development of this entity and thereby optimize patient 
selection.

Publisher: El cáncer colorrectal metastásico (CCRm) es un importante problema de 
salud pública global. La identificación de biomarcadores como inestabilidad de 
microsatélites (MSI) y el estado de las proteínas de reparación (MMR), entre 
otros, proporcionan información crucial para guiar las decisiones terapéuticas y 
predecir el pronóstico. Los inhibidores del punto de control inmunitario (ICI) 
son el tratamiento de elección en aquellos pacientes con déficit en MMR (dMMR) o 
inestabilidad de microsatélites alta (MSI-H). La evaluación de la respuesta al 
tratamiento por iRECIST pone de manifiesto dos nuevos patrones: la 
pseudoprogresión y la hiperprogresión (HP). Esta última se caracteriza por un 
rápido deterioro clínico y duplicación de la carga tumoral en menos de dos 
meses. En este artículo presentamos el que, hasta nuestro conocimiento, es el 
primer caso reportado en la literatura de una paciente con CCRm que tras recibir 
tratamiento nivolumab/ipilimumab presentó HP. Aunque se han propuesto diversas 
hipótesis para explicar este fenómeno, hasta ahora no se han podido identificar 
factores predictivos claros. Se requiere de estudios prospectivos que permitan 
anticipar el desarrollo de esta entidad y así poder optimizar la selección de 
pacientes.

BACKGROUND: Countries must implement and scale up effective programmes to 
achieve the WHO 2030 cervical cancer elimination targets; however, systemic 
challenges exist. This study aimed to determine key economic, political, 
sociocultural, and health-system determinants associated with achieving target 
coverage of human papillomavirus vaccination and screening, cancer treatment, 
and areas of opportunity for policy reform and health system strengthening.
METHODS: In this ecological study, we developed a policy determinant model (PDM) 
to assess key policy determinants of interest using the following conceptual 
frameworks: social determinants of health, WHO building blocks, and universal 
health coverage. Core framework domains were operationalised within the PDM 
through identification of direct or proxy variables located in publicly 
available global datasets. The PDM was applied with cervical cancer as the 
disease focus, using an ecological approach. Kendall's and Pearson's correlation 
coefficients measured the strength of associations between policy indicators and 
indicators measuring WHO elimination target coverage for vaccination, screening, 
and treatment.
FINDINGS: Data from 155 countries across 39 policy determinant indicators were 
analysed. Indicators measuring equity-focused economic, social, and public 
policies had large positive associations, with higher values reported for 
country-level screening and treatment coverage, per WHO targets. Assessment of 
indicators measuring health system performance likewise showed core health 
system capability and availability to be associated with progress in cervical 
cancer elimination. National cancer control planning had low or no associations 
with achieving target coverage, indicating ineffective implementation.
INTERPRETATION: Social, economic, cultural, and environmental policies, in 
conjunction with health system performance and equitable access to care play 
integral roles in country capacity to achieve the 2030 elimination targets. In 
harnessing the cervical cancer elimination agenda, nations have the opportunity 
to leverage global momentum and funding to drive broader health system 
strengthening, investment, and policy reform.

Over the years, significant progress has been made in treating fatal diseases, 
but cancer treatment is still a challenge. Photodynamic therapy, is a treatment 
that relies on photosensitization to target and destroy neoplastic cells. It has 
gained recognition as an effective treatment approach because of its precision, 
minimally invasive nature, and ability to stimulate the immune system, with 
applications spanning various medical fields such as oncology, dermatology, 
immunology, and ophthalmology. It works by activating a photosensitizing agent 
with a particular wavelength in the presence of oxygen, generating reactive 
oxygen species that trigger cell death. This oxygen-dependent treatment 
selectively targets cancer cells while minimizing adverse effects on healthy 
tissues, making it a promising approach in modern medicine. However, despite its 
therapeutic potential, PDT has limitations such as restricted light penetration 
and insufficient cellular uptake of photosensitizers by cancer cells. These 
challenges can be addressed through nanotechnology by optimizing photosensitizer 
formulations and modifying therapeutic strategies to enhance treatment efficacy. 
The incorporation of nanotechnology into photodynamic therapy has been 
particularly impactful, with nanomaterials serving as efficient carriers as well 
as photosensitizers. Engineered nanoparticles enable the direct delivery of 
therapeutic agents to tumors, enhancing specificity while minimizing side 
effects. This combined approach of photodynamic therapy-nanotechnology allows 
for effective treatment of different types of cancers, including resistant 
tumors and one's which are hard-to-reach, by targeting specific cell markers and 
improving drug accumulation in various tumor environments. This review aims to 
highlight the importance of the use of nanotechnology in photodynamic therapy to 
treat various types of cancer in achieving desirable therapeutic effects.

BACKGROUND: Psilocybin-assisted therapy (PAT) shows promise for cancer-related 
depression, yet little research has examined how therapeutic context shapes 
patient experiences. While set (mindset) and setting (environment) are 
considered central to psychedelic treatment, empirical evidence on their role in 
PAT acceptability remains limited. This study explores factors influencing the 
acceptability of PAT from the perspective of patients with cancer and 
depression.
METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with participants in a clinical 
trial of psilocybin-assisted therapy. Using template analysis, we examined 
themes related to the acceptability of the experience and the surrounding 
therapeutic environment.
RESULTS: Participants (n = 28) described the psilocybin experience as intense 
and demanding, with therapeutic benefits closely tied to their ability to 
""surrender""-a term used to describe accepting and remaining open to the 
experience's intensity and unpredictability. A safe, supportive, and ethical 
environment was critical in fostering trust and engagement. Preparation and 
integration were key to maximizing benefit. Music played a significant but 
variable role, sometimes enhancing and other times distracting. While the 
clinical setting provided safety, ceremonial elements added meaning for many.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight how therapeutic structure, preparation, and 
setting shape PAT acceptability, supporting the need for patient-centered 
approaches to optimize care and outcomes.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Auriculotherapy for cancer-related fatigue has been 
investigated in various clinical trials; nonetheless, their conclusions remain 
inconsistent. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the efficacy and 
safety of auriculotherapy for cancer-related fatigue were investigated.
METHODS: Randomized controlled trials were identified by searching seven English 
databases (PubMed, Embase, AMED, Web of Science, CINAHL, CENTRAL, PsycINFO) and 
four Chinese databases (CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, CBMdisc), covering records from 
their inception to August 1, 2024. The version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias 
tool for randomized trials was used to assess the risk of bias. Evidence 
certainty was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, 
Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach with the GRADEprofiler software 
(version 3.6.1). Meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.3.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies involving 1033 patients were included. These studies 
had some methodological limitations. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes 
was graded as ""very low"". Meta-analysis revealed that auriculotherapy 
significantly improved cancer-related fatigue (standardized mean difference 
[SMD] -1.26; 95 % confidence interval [CI] [-1.69, -0.82]; P < 0.00001) and 
quality of life (SMD 1.01; 95 % CI [0.55, 1.47]; P < 0.0001). Auriculotherapy 
was associated with a favorable safety profile and a low incidence of adverse 
events.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that auriculotherapy is a promising, effective, 
and safe intervention for managing cancer-related fatigue, although 
higher-quality trials are needed to strengthen this conclusion owing to 
limitations in the current evidence base.

Chelator-free radiolabeling of nanoparticles (NPs) has attracted a great 
interest in design of targeted contrast agents for multimodal imaging. Herein, 
we present a new dual-modality contrast agent based on the efficient 
radiolabeling of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with 99mTc for targeted 
MRI-SPECT cancer imaging. Methionine (Met) was conjugated to maleic 
anhydride-alt-1-octadecene (PMAO) and employed as a coating agent, endowing 
Fe3O4 MNPs with appropriate colloidal stability, biocompatibility, binding 
affinity to 99mTc, and targeting ability. The morphology, size, surface charge, 
crystallinity and functionality of the targeted contrast agent (Fe3O4@PMAO-Met) 
were fully characterized. The MTT assay confirmed high biocompatibility of 
Fe3O4@PMAO-Met MNPs (∼35 nm) in MCF-10A normal mammary epithelial cells, and 
enhanced uptake in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, supporting their targeting 
capability. The 99mTc-labeled MNPs with reproducible high yield (>98 %) at room 
temperature remained permanent in vitro for 24 h in saline and for 6 h in human 
serum. Fe3O4@PMAO-Met MNPs was also evaluated in vivo in mice models, exhibiting 
acceptable tumor visualization as well as noticeable hepatobiliary uptake with 
low accumulation in non-target organs. In vivo MR imaging of Balb/c mice 
revealed a negative T2 enhanced contrast on tumor cells. All assessments 
demonstrated high potential of Fe3O4@PMAO-Met-99mTc for further analyses as a 
promising targeted contrast agent in MRI-SPECT cancer imaging.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Prostate cancer causes >400,000 deaths annually 
worldwide, being the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in men. 
However, accurate prediction of prostate cancer metastasis based on mutations 
remains a challenge.
METHODS: We proposed a novel neural network constructed with phenotype-related 
core pathways, called NN-PCP, to accurately predict prostate cancer metastasis. 
NN-PCP comprises three main modules: IORA-driven modules, IGSEA-driven modules, 
and a hierarchy with two differential layers. IORA-driven modules are 
constructed using highly variable genes and core pathways that are gained with 
an improved over-representation analysis. They are applied to extract pathway 
features from each type of mutation data. IGSEA-driven modules are constructed 
using the phenotype-related core pathways that are obtained with an improved 
gene set enrichment analysis. They are used to transform pathway features from 
each type of mutation data into differential features. Finally, the hierarchy 
with two differential layers is employed to mimic the synergy effect of 
differential features from different types of mutation data to gain deeply 
differential features.
RESULTS: NN-PCP outperformed four state-of-the-art methods, with improvements of 
5.7 %, 7.8 %, 1.2 %, 0.058, 0.031, and 0.047 in accuracy, precision, recall, 
F1-score, AUC, and AUPR, respectively. Furthermore, NN-PCP identified some 
important genes and pathways in prostate cancer metastatic prediction, such as 
PIK3R1, PIK3CA, and the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method outperforms other pathway-based deep learning 
methods, which can be used as an auxiliary tool for doctors to improve the 
accuracy of disease diagnosis.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related 
mortality worldwide. Current treatments are often limited by multidrug 
resistance and significant side effects, underscoring the urgent need for novel 
therapeutic strategies. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), including 
montelukast, zafirlukast, and pranlukast, have shown promising anticancer 
potential; however, their underlying molecular mechanisms remain insufficiently 
understood. In this study, the antiproliferative effects of montelukast, 
zafirlukast, and pranlukast on CRC cell lines (HCT-116 and Caco-2) were 
evaluated using cell viability and proliferation assays. Montelukast and 
zafirlukast were further examined using a liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics to assess any possible metabolic 
alterations in HCT-116 cells, along with flow cytometry to determine their 
effects on cell death. Montelukast and zafirlukast were found to significantly 
inhibit the cell proliferation of HCT-116 in a dose-dependent manner, with IC₅₀ 
values of 57.4 μM and 73.28 μM, respectively. Flow cytometry demonstrated that 
apoptosis was the predominant mode of cell death with both drugs. Neither 
montelukast nor zafirlukast showed any significant in vitro antioxidant effects. 
LC-MS Metabolomics revealed that montelukast and zafirlukast induced distinct 
metabolic changes with 47 and 34 significantly altered metabolites, 
respectively. Montelukast notably affected mannosamine, 5-oxo-L-proline, 
acetyl-phenylalanine, acetoin, and taurine, implicating pathways related to 
amino acid metabolism, redox homeostasis, and mitochondrial function. In 
contrast, zafirlukast impacted nucleotide-related metabolites, including 
inosine, adenine, cytidine, deoxyguanosine, and itaconate, highlighting 
nucleotide biosynthesis and immunometabolism disruptions. These findings 
demonstrate the antiproliferative potential of montelukast and zafirlukast in 
CRC and provide new insights into their distinct molecular mechanisms of action. 
This supports their potential repurposing as adjunctive therapies in CRC 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: Pleurodesis is a palliative treatment for malignant pleural effusion 
(MPE). Guidelines recommend pleurodesis for patients with a better prognosis. 
However, accurately predicting survival is challenging. The 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has emerged as a prognostic biomarker in 
various cancers. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of 
NLR in patients with lung cancer who underwent pleurodesis and subsequently 
received best supportive care (BSC) without further antitumor therapy.
METHODS: In this retrospective observational study conducted at two Japanese 
hospitals, we reviewed the medical records of 47 consecutive patients diagnosed 
with both lung cancer and MPE who underwent pleurodesis between April 2011 and 
2024. The primary analysis involved evaluating the predictive value of NLR for 
in-hospital mortality using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
analysis.
RESULTS: Among the 47 patients included, 25 were non-survivors with 
significantly elevated NLR and C-reactive protein levels compared with the 
survivors. ROC curve analysis revealed that NLR was predictive of in-hospital 
mortality, with an area under the curve of 0.744 (p = 0.0187). The optimal 
cutoff value for NLR, determined by the Youden index, was 8.252. Furthermore, an 
NLR >9 was independently associated with increased mortality during 
hospitalization and at 60 days after adjusting for the LENT score (in-hospital 
adjusted odds ratio: 18.52; 95 % confidence interval, 2.210-405.0; p = 0.0049; 
60-day p = 0.0157).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with lung cancer who underwent pleurodesis during 
BSC, an NLR >9 was associated with significantly higher mortality at both 
in-hospital and 60 days.

INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) is an aggressive presentation of 
BC present in 1-5 % of all patients with BC. While obesity has been consistently 
associated with worse prognosis in patients with BC, it is understudied in 
patients with IBC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the association of body mass 
index (BMI) at diagnosis with clinicopathological characteristics, pathological 
complete response (pCR) to chemotherapy and survival in a multicentric cohort of 
patients with IBC treated with pre-operative chemotherapy.
RESULTS: Of the 542 patients, 6 were underweight (1.1 %, excluded in further 
analysis), 190 were normal-weight (35.1 %), 187 had overweight (34.5 %), and 159 
had obesity (29.3 %). Of the 536 included patients, 463 had non-metastatic and 
73 metastatic IBC at diagnosis. Higher BMI was associated with older age at 
diagnosis, increased stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (sTIL), and 
particularly in the ER-/HER2+ subgroup, a greater likelihood of metastasis at 
diagnosis. Tumor emboli were less frequently detected in peritumoral samples of 
patients with obesity as compared to patients with normal weight. Among 
non-metastatic patients, those with obesity in the ER-/HER2+ and 
ER+/HER2-subgroups showed numerically, but not statistically significantly, 
lower rates of pCR following neoadjuvant chemotherapy than normal-weight 
patients (38.5 % vs 42.5 %, and 6.6 % vs 16.7 %, respectively). BMI was not 
associated with any survival endpoint.
CONCLUSION: We observed a limited association of BMI with clinicopathological 
variables and pCR in patients with IBC without evidence of its relationship with 
survival outcomes. Future studies should investigate the biological impact of 
obesity on IBC and its tumor microenvironment.

BACKGROUND: While neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) shows suboptimal pathological 
responses in advanced gastric cancer (GC), Yiqi Huayu Jiedu decoction (YHJD) 
demonstrates potential as a synergistic agent.
METHODS: This study represents an interim analysis of a prospective, double-arm, 
single-center, randomized controlled clinical trial (ChiCTR2300072742) conducted 
at Jiangsu Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. A total of 122 
patients with locally advanced GC were enrolled between June 2023 and December 
2024. The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of YHJD in enhancing 
the neoadjuvant FLOT regimen. The primary endpoint was tumor pathological 
regression (TRG).
RESULTS: The YHJD group demonstrated superior pathological responses (TRG 1-3: 
YHJD group vs CON group: 44/68 [68.8%] vs 29/58 [50.0%], p = 0.043) while 
maintaining a safety profile comparable to chemotherapy alone. Gut microbiota 
analysis revealed that YHJD significantly reduced the abundance of Lactobacillus 
salivarius (L.salivarius) during NAC, with lower levels correlating with 
improved treatment response. Notably, depletion of intratumoral L.salivarius in 
the YHJD paralleled enhanced NAC efficacy. Further analysis revealed that 
enrichment of L. salivarius was associated with immunosuppressive 
microenvironment, it showed positive correlations with T regulatory cells 
(Tregs; r = 0.512, p < 0.0001) and M2 macrophages (r = 0.411, p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: YHJD enhanced the pathological response rates in GC patients 
receiving FLOT-based NAC, possibly through modulation of the 
immuno-oncology-microbiome axis, potentially by downregulating L. 
salivarius-mediated immunosuppression.

BACKGROUND: The benefit of local control on the overall survival of patients 
with metastatic breast cancer remains controversial. This study aimed to 
evaluate the impact of locoregional treatment of the primary tumor (surgery 
and/or radiotherapy) in Mexican patients diagnosed with de novo metastatic 
breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated 671 patients with de 
novo metastatic breast cancer, diagnosed between the years 2007-2015, using data 
from a local database of breast cancer patients. The decision for locoregional 
treatment was made by the attending physician.
RESULTS: Among 671 patients, the median follow-up was 26.83 months. Patients who 
underwent locoregional control (surgery and/or radiotherapy) had a median 
survival of 41.57 months compared to 21.3 months in those without locoregional 
control (p < 0.001). Median survival was 51.5 months in patients treated with 
surgery versus 25,53 months in those without surgery (p < 0.001) and 40.1 months 
versus 25.23 months in patients receiving chemoradiotherapy (p < 0.001). 
Multivariate analysis confirmed that surgery significantly improved overall 
survival (HR 0.50; 95 % CI:0.32-0.77; p = 0.002). However, after adjusting for 
potential confounders using propensity score matching, the survival benefit 
associated with surgery did not reach statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective analysis shows no survival benefit from 
locoregional control after adjustment for potential confounders. However, given 
the observed survival differences, it is important to identify which patient 
subgroups may derive benefit in prospective studies.

AIMS: The integration of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors into 
the treatment regimen for advanced breast cancer (BC), specifically oestrogen 
receptor-positive (ER+) subtypes, marks a significant stride in oncological 
therapy. These inhibitors have demonstrated substantial clinical benefits and 
are generally well tolerated compared to other targeted therapies. Our study 
evaluated the effects of dosage reductions on progression-free survival (PFS) 
and overall survival (OS) in patients undergoing CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an exhaustive literature review across 
several databases, including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane, considering studies 
published up to September 30, 2023. The selection criteria were based on the 
Patients Interventions Comparisons Outcomes (PICOS) framework, focussing on 
studies involving ER+ BC patients treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination 
with endocrine therapy. Both retrospective and prospective studies were included 
involving adult patients treated with standard doses of CDK4/6 inhibitors for 
approved indications.
RESULTS: The systematic review included 33 retrospective studies and one phase 2 
study, encompassing 7,767 patients. Analysis revealed significant improvements 
in both OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.61-0.93; P 
< .01) and PFS (HR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.76-0.98; P = .02) among patients who 
underwent dosage reduction. The data exhibited low heterogeneity across studies, 
strengthening the reliability of our findings.
CONCLUSION: Our research provides valuable insights into the dosage optimisation 
of CDK4/6 inhibitors and its impact on patient outcomes. The findings suggest 
that when clinically indicated, dose reductions do not compromise treatment 
efficacy and may even improve survival outcomes. These results offer a promising 
direction for future clinical practices and research in oncology, particularly 
in personalising treatment approaches for patients with ER+ advanced BC.

Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a non-destructive and highly 
sensitive technique widely used for analyzing complex biological samples. 
However, conventional SERS approaches for living cell analysis face significant 
challenges. In particular, nanoparticle-based intracellular probes can induce 
cytotoxicity, and attempts to use 3D protruding nanostructures to interrogate 
cells externally have shown limited success so far. Furthermore, existing 
cell-interfacing SERS substrates typically capture only a small fraction of 
cellular biomolecular signals, producing sparse data that often limits 
classification tasks to simple binary outcomes. To address these limitations, we 
developed a 3D multilayer nanolaminate SERS substrate composed of gold and 
silica (Au/SiO₂) that interfaces directly with the cell membrane. Using this 
platform, we achieved high-speed, high-throughput, label-free SERS mapping of 
living breast cancer cells, obtaining large and information-rich spectral 
datasets. In contrast to prior methods, our approach enabled the classification 
of four breast cancer subtypes with 92.5 % accuracy using conventional machine 
learning algorithms. This label-free SERS platform demonstrates potential for 
more complex cellular analyses via advanced machine learning, including studies 
of cellular responses to external stimuli such as drug treatments.

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful tool in cancer research, 
significantly expanding our capacity to study the complexity of tumour 
ecosystems. Together with the diversity of ST platforms, a plethora of analysis 
approaches and tools have been developed with the goal of extracting distinct 
aspects of biological information contained in the data. From visualizing gene 
expression in the context of tissue structure and cell morphology, to the 
exploitation of machine learning and spatial statistics to identify cell 
neighbourhoods, quantify tumour heterogeneity and map cell-cell signalling 
networks, there is a current explosion of novel analyses techniques. 
Unfortunately, this makes it challenging to develop workflows and strategies for 
data analysis, especially for those new to the field. This review serves to 
offer a path to cancer researchers who recognise the potential of ST and would 
like to start their data analysis journey. We cover the main analysis approaches 
used to address common research questions associated with ST data in cancer, 
highlighting commonly used tools, as well as discuss emerging analysis 
techniques that hold the potential to leverage the richness of the data at an 
unprecedented scale. Finally, we end by highlighting considerations when 
designing ST projects, from experimental design, to assembling teams and 
managing the rapid flux of ST technologies. We anticipate this review will be 
useful resource for researchers to not just seek analysis strategies to answer 
their current research questions, but also provide inspiration to further take 
advantage of the wealth of information provided by ST data.

INTRODUCTION: Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous 
disease, leading to ambiguity in resectability criteria. This has prompted the 
EORTC Lung Cancer Group to establish a standardized definition of resectability 
for clinical trials. A Delphi consensus process was initiated, including a 
systematic review, survey, and clinical cases review. Here, we report 
exclusively the results of the clinical cases review, aimed to categorize cases 
based on tumor and lymph node factors, to identify those deemed surgically 
resectable upfront.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with clinical stage III NSCLC (8th TNM edition) 
treated at Institut Jules Bordet between 2016-2021 were identified. These cases 
underwent evaluation by multidisciplinary panels (MDT), comprising thoracic 
surgeons, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists/pulmonologists and imaging 
specialists. The MDT determined the resectability of each tumor, and 
non-consensual cases underwent a second and a third discussion rounds. A 
TNM-subset was classified as ""resectable"" if ≥75 % of cases within that category 
were deemed ""resectable"" following multiple rounds of review.
RESULTS: Among 105 cases, 52 % of tumors were stage IIIA, 36 % stage IIIB and 
11 % stage IIIC. After the first two review rounds, 13 % of cases were 
classified as ""no consensus"" and moved to a third round. The main reasons were 
suboptimal imaging (n = 8), incomplete invasive mediastinal staging to assess 
the N factor (n = 3), and disagreement on the resectability of T4 tumors 
invading thoracic structures or with multi-station/bulky N2 disease (n = 3). 
After the third review round, T3-T4 tumors based on size/satellite nodules 
and/or with N1-N2 single-station involvement were considered resectable. In 
contrast, many invasive T4-tumors were considered unresectable, especially if 
combined with N2-N3 disease. N2-multi-station, N2-bulky or N3 involvement were 
generally considered unresectable (100 %/95 %/95 % respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: After a multiple-round multidisciplinary review of real-world 
cases, consensus was reached for most TNM-subsets, except for invasive T4N0 
tumors. This case review informed the Consensual Definition of Resectable stage 
III NSCLC in clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Disruptions to cancer diagnoses were widely reported in the US 
during the early COVID-19 pandemic. Whether any cases remained unaccounted-for 
by the end of the pandemic has not been fully assessed.
METHODS: We collected data on invasive cancer diagnoses occurring among 
individuals aged 20-89 years between January 2020 and December 2022 from the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Expected cancer case 
counts and incidence rates with 95 % credibility intervals (95 %CrIs) were 
estimated for 2020-2022 from pre-pandemic trends (2005-2019) using Bayesian 
Age-Period-Cohort models. We compared observed rates with expected rates, and 
estimated unaccounted-for cases. Additional site-, stage-, and subgroup-specific 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Among 2260,704 cancer cases diagnosed in 2020-2022, the observed 
incidence rate was 595.5 per 100,000 persons (95 %CI, 594.7-596.2), which was 
6.7 % lower than the expected rate of 638.1 (95 %CrI, 620.1-656.1) and 
corresponded to 160,475 fewer-than-expected cases (95 %CrI, 99,777-221,174). 
Annual observed rates were significantly lower than expected in 2020 (565.8 vs. 
630.7), with recovery in 2021 and 2022, though not enough to overcome the 
existing case deficit. Incidence rates for persons aged ≥ 65 years, 
nonmetropolitan residents, and non-Hispanic White individuals, as well as 
site-specific rates for lung and kidney cancers and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 
remained below expected levels beyond 2020. Early-stage colorectal cancer 
diagnoses were 14.2 % lower than expected over the period.
CONCLUSION: While annual cancer incidence rates returned to expected levels by 
the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, substantial numbers of unaccounted-for cases 
remained, raising concerns for future increases in cancer morbidity and 
mortality.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with metastatic lung cancer often experience significant 
symptom burden. This study aimed to describe baseline symptoms in adults with 
metastatic lung cancer at diagnosis, identify age-related differences, and 
examine symptom clusters and intercorrelations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed Edmonton Symptom 
Assessment System scores from patients with newly diagnosed stage IV lung cancer 
(2015-2016). Patients were stratified by age (<65 vs ≥65 years). Descriptive 
statistics, generalized linear regression analysis, principal component 
analysis, and network analysis were used to examine symptom profiles and 
clustering.
RESULTS: Of the 359 included patients, 213 (58.3%) were ≥ 65 years old. Median 
(interquartiles) total symptom distress score was 22 (11, 39). Two main symptom 
clusters emerged: physical (pain, tiredness, drowsiness, nausea, lack of 
appetite, shortness of breath) and psychological (depression, anxiety, 
wellbeing). No significant differences in overall symptom burden were found 
between age groups, except older patients reported worse lack of appetite 
(p = 0.04). Network analysis identified wellbeing, tiredness, and depression as 
central, highly interconnected symptoms across age groups.
DISCUSSION: Older and younger patients with metastatic lung cancer experience a 
similar high symptom burden at diagnosis. Routine comprehensive symptom 
assessment is important for all age groups. The identified symptom clusters and 
central symptoms may help guide targeted supportive care interventions to 
improve quality of life in this population.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer patients face treatment-related challenges such as 
malnutrition and muscle wasting associated with cancer cachexia. If left 
untreated, these complications can severely impact quality of life and autonomy. 
The BENITA study aims to develop and evaluate a tailored exercise and nutrition 
program during and after first-line chemotherapy. Phase I focused on program 
development and optimization; Phase II will test its effectiveness in a 
randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients, survivors, 
physicians, nutrition and physiotherapy experts, and a health insurance 
representative. Thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke was used to 
identify key insights for program design and implementation.
RESULTS: Patients' motivation to engage in exercise and nutrition was driven by 
enjoyment and external encouragement. Barriers included chemotherapy-induced 
fatigue, physical weakness, and psychological strain. Uncertainty about safe 
training post-surgery was common. Regular support from healthcare professionals 
was seen as essential for confidence and adherence.
DISCUSSION: Findings highlight the need for a personalized, flexible program 
tailored to ovarian cancer patients' needs. A blended digital approach combining 
self-guided elements with professional support could improve implementation, 
offering customized exercise routines, nutrition plans, and regular check-ins to 
facilitate patient-centered participation.

BACKGROUND: We examined the prognostic value of positive peritoneal cytology 
(PPC) in International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2009 stage 
IA grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancer.
METHODS: This single-institution retrospective cohort study included patients 
who underwent surgical staging with peritoneal cytology sampling and bilateral 
pathologic pelvic lymph node evaluation between 1/1/2008 and 8/1/2021. Exclusion 
criteria included suspicious/atypical cytology, lymphovascular space invasion, 
lymph node involvement (including isolated tumor cells), synchronous 
malignancies, no nodal evaluation, or receipt of adjuvant therapy. Patients were 
stratified by PPC or negative peritoneal cytology (NPC) status. Molecular 
classification and mutational profiling were available for some tumors.
RESULTS: Of 1151 eligible patients, 50 (4 %) had PPC. Median age at surgery was 
58 years and was similar between groups (P = 0.59). Depth of myometrial 
invasion, vaginal tears, age, prior secondary malignancies, and PPC were 
associated with progression-free survival (PFS) on univariable analysis. 
Five-year PFS rates were 95.2 % (NPC) and 88.8 % (PPC) (P = 0.02). PPC remained 
independently associated with worse PFS on multivariable analysis (adjusted HR: 
2.63, 95 % CI: 1.19-5.80; P = 0.02), though recurrence was limited in number, 
with 31 events observed across the entire cohort. Molecular profiling of 216 
tumors confirmed all four subtypes; subtype distribution did not correlate with 
outcomes. Tumors in the PPC group were enriched in ARID1A (82 % vs. 44 %, 
P = 0.001) mutations.
CONCLUSION: PPC appears to be independently associated with worse PFS in 
low-grade, early-stage endometrial cancer despite excellent overall outcomes and 
absence of adjuvant therapy. ARID1A mutations may promote peritoneal 
dissemination in these otherwise low-risk tumors.

BACKGROUND: Targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) directed at fibroblast 
activation protein (FAP), highly expressed on cancer-associated fibroblasts 
(CAFs), is a promising approach for treating stroma-rich tumors such as 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and breast cancer (BC). To better assess 
the efficacy of FAP-TRT and to get more insight into the potential of crossfire 
effects from target expressing CAFs to neighboring cancer cells, more 
representative preclinical models are needed. Therefore, we established a direct 
2D co-culture model consisting of both CAFs and cancer cells.
MATERIALS & METHODS: We developed a clinically representative PDAC and BC 2D 
co-culture model by co-seeding human CAFs and matching cancer cells. First, the 
CAFs and cancer cells were transduced with distinct fluorescent and 
bioluminescent reporter genes (RFP-CBG99 and GFP-CBR2, respectively). 
Fluorescent microscopy enabled the optimization of the seeding densities. 
Patient tumor samples were analyzed to guide the co-culture design, ensuring 
realistic representation of the patient situation. Co-cultures were optimized 
and subsequently treated with external beam radiation therapy and radionuclide 
therapy (i.e. lutetium-177). The luciferase expressed by the reporter gene 
enabled monitoring of CAF and cancer cell viability. Cell survival was assessed 
using dual-color bioluminescence imaging (BLI) at 540SP, 600LP, and open filter 
settings.
RESULTS: The established PDAC and BC co-culture models closely mimicked patient 
tumors with regard to CAF localization, stroma density, and FAP expression. The 
dual-color BLI allowed for reliable discrimination of CAF and cancer cell 
viability. We observed a drastic decrease in cell viability after EBRT in all 
four cell lines, whereas only three out of four cell lines responded to 
lutetium-177 therapy. In addition, all cell lines exhibited similar treatment 
responses in the co-culture and monoculture settings.
CONCLUSIONS: We successfully established 2D co-culture models of PDAC and BC 
that include CAFs neighboring the cancer cells, as is the case in the patient 
tumor microenvironment. The use of dual-color reporter genes enabled efficient, 
cell-type-specific analysis of radionuclide therapy efficacy via BLI. The 
developed models provide a user-friendly platform for evaluating therapeutic 
responses and can be further refined into 3D systems for even higher patient 
resemblance.

In this study, a novel bidentate imidazolyl acylhydrazone ligand containing an 
imidazolyl group was designed, and two novel complexes [ZnL(CH3OH)]·NO3 (1) and 
[EuL(NO3)2DMF] (2) with a 1D chain structure were synthesized as expected, which 
shows significantly stronger anti-lung cancer activity than cisplatin. Complexes 
1 and 2 effectively inhibit A549 cell proliferation by up-regulating the 
expression of cytochrome C, cleaved-caspase 3, and Bax, while down-regulating 
Pro-caspase 3 and Bcl-2 expression, thereby suppressing cell cycle progression 
and inducing the classical apoptotic pathway. Additionally, these complexes 
significantly inhibit A549 cell migration. Furthermore, they further elevate 
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and reduce mitochondrial 
membrane potential in A549 cells. In vivo anti-tumor evaluations show that 
complexes 1 and 2 significantly outperform cisplatin in inhibiting the growth of 
A549 subcutaneous tumors in nude mice, with no apparent damage to major organs. 
The results of histological examination show that complexes 1 and 2 do not cause 
obviously pathological damage to the main organs, which further verify their 
good biosafety in vivo. This study provides a research basis for the research 
and development of new metal-based drugs with chain structures which show high 
efficiency and low toxicity.

The solute carrier protein SLC5A6 is associated with multiple malignant tumors, 
while its role in cervical cancer (CC) remains unexplored. This study aimed to 
investigate the expression pattern, biological functions, and underlying 
mechanisms of SLC5A6 in cervical cancer. It was found that the expression of 
SLC5A6 was significantly upregulated in cervical cancer tissues, and its high 
expression was associated with poorer overall survival of patients. In vitro 
functional experiments conducted in HeLa and SiHa cell lines demonstrated that 
overexpression of SLC5A6 enhanced cell proliferation, colony formation, and 
migration abilities, while inhibiting cell apoptosis; conversely, knockdown of 
SLC5A6 suppressed these oncogenic phenotypes. Further in vivo experiments 
confirmed that knockdown of SLC5A6 could inhibit the growth of xenograft tumors. 
Through transcriptomic analysis and pathway enrichment analysis, this study 
identified lipid metabolism as a key downstream pathway of SLC5A6, in which 
fatty acid synthase (FASN) serves as a crucial effector molecule. 
Mechanistically, SLC5A6 is responsible for the transmembrane transport of 
biotin. Reduced expression of SLC5A6 leads to a decrease in the expression of 
biotin-dependent acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which in turn downregulates its 
downstream target gene FASN. Importantly, knockdown of FASN could reverse the 
promotional effect of SLC5A6 overexpression on the growth of cervical cancer 
cells, indicating that SLC5A6 promotes cervical cancer progression through 
FASN-mediated reprogramming of lipid metabolism. In conclusion, this study 
identified SLC5A6 as a novel oncogenic factor in cervical cancer and reveals its 
mechanism of regulating lipid metabolism via FASN, suggesting that targeting the 
SLC5A6-FASN axis may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for cervical 
cancer.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused major disruptions in healthcare 
services, especially affecting routine monitoring of patients with head and neck 
cancer (HNC) and oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs). Its disruption 
during the pandemic may have led to delayed diagnoses and worse outcomes.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included patients previously under follow-up at 
a referral center. All were invited for reassessment involving clinical 
examination and comparison with pre-pandemic records. Cases were categorized as 
stable, progressive, regressive (for OPMDs), or deceased. A biopsy was performed 
on any suspicious changes. Statistical analyses included chi-square, Fisher's 
exact test, odds ratios, and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates.
RESULTS: A total of 246 patients were evaluated, including 103 patients with HNC 
and 143 with OPMDs. Patients were re-assessed post-pandemic and again during the 
latest follow-up. Among HNC, progression was more frequent in the post-pandemic 
period (26.9%) compared to the later appointment (24%), which was statistically 
significant (p=0.0011). Stability after the pandemic was linked to better 
prognosis (OR=4.667; p=0.0051). Survival analysis revealed significantly lower 
survival rates for the post-pandemic group compared to those followed during 
subsequent follow-up (HR=0.26; p<0.0001). For OPMDs, progression was observed in 
27.28% post-pandemic and 19.14% in the other group (p=0.0214). However, 
prognosis in the latest follow-up was not significantly associated with 
post-pandemic status (p=0.1292). Outcome distribution by lesion subtype was 
significant over time (p=0.0046) and at the latest follow-up (p=0.0088). 
Patients with proliferative verrucous leukoplakia exhibited a higher rate of 
progression. Survival analysis also revealed a significantly lower survival rate 
in the first period (HR=0.52; p=0.037).
CONCLUSIONS: These results underscore the lasting consequences of follow-up 
interruption. Delays in monitoring may lead to progression or delayed diagnosis, 
especially in high-risk patients.

RNA molecules play critical roles in various diseases by regulating 
transcription, translation, and protein expression at the genetic level, 
positioning RNA-targeted therapeutics as a transformative frontier in precision 
medicine. Ribonuclease-targeting chimeras (RiboTAC) have emerged as a promising 
modality by leveraging endogenous RNases (e.g., RNase L) for RNA degradation, 
offering superior pharmacokinetics, enhanced specificity, and sustained 
therapeutic effects compared to conventional approaches. Despite their 
potential, conventional RiboTAC development remains constrained by laborious 
screening processes and structural complexity, limiting its clinical 
translation. In this study, we first proposed split-and-mix-RiboTAC based on 
liposome self-assembly (LipoSM-RiboTAC) to achieve RNA degradation for cancer 
therapy. This self-adjustable platform possesses self-optimized biomolecule 
spatial recognition for facile screening, with rapid cellular internalization, 
robust activation of endogenous RNase L, and precise degradation of oncogenic 
RNAs. Collectively, we have established an efficient and low-toxicity platform 
for targeted RNA degradation, which holds promise for cancer therapy and offers 
novel insights into precision gene therapy.

Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have the potential to revolutionize 
cancer treatment by specifically targeting and degrading oncogenic proteins. 
Using the ubiquitin-proteasome system, PROTACs allow the selective degradation 
of disease-causing proteins, including those traditionally deemed ""undruggable"" 
by conventional small-molecule inhibitors. By catalytically eliminating rather 
than inhibiting proteins, PROTACs provide sustained target suppression with 
lower doses and reduced toxicity. Their bifunctional design linking a protein of 
interest to an E3 ligase drives targeted ubiquitination and subsequent 
proteasomal degradation. Recent progress demonstrates promise in treating solid 
and hematologic malignancies, with several candidates advancing to clinical 
trials. This review provides a comprehensive overview of developing PROTACs, 
from understanding their mechanism to clinical applications, and highlights 
their emerging role in overcoming drug resistance and advancing the limits of 
cancer treatment. In addition, the authors discuss the challenges of optimizing 
PROTACs, including issues related to pharmacokinetics, E3 ligase compatibility, 
and the delivery of PROTACs to tumors. With their modularity, adaptability, and 
precision, PROTACs represent a next-generation platform for personalized cancer 
therapy across various patient groups.

BACKGROUND: Prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission 
tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT) is affecting the management of 
patients with prostate cancer with biochemical recurrence after radical 
prostatectomy. The long-term outcomes of tailoring salvage treatment on the 
basis of PSMA-PET/CT status remain to be determined.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to project incremental 
life-years of strategies that allocate treatments at biochemical recurrence 
after radical prostatectomy on the basis of PSMA-PET/CT status (PSMA-metastatic 
vs. PSMA-nonmetastatic). Modeled treatments are local/regional (radiation) or 
systemic (hormone therapy and doublet therapy), administered immediately or 
delayed. PSMA-metastatic status was assumed to lead to treatment 
intensification, whereas PSMA-nonmetastatic status would lead to 
deintensification. To project survival, data on progression to metastasis from a 
clinical cohort were combined with registry data on postmetastasis survival. 
Because of the lack of data on long-term treatment benefits by PSMA status, 
survival was projected by varying the hazard ratio (HR) for disease-specific 
death among PSMA-metastatic versus PSMA-nonmetastatic patients under delayed or 
local/regional regimens (HR1) and under immediate systemic regimens (HR2).
RESULTS: Mean life-years are projected to be 15.5 under the non-PSMA-tailored 
strategy, and mean incremental life-years range from 0.38 to 0.81 depending on 
HR1 and HR2. A greater benefit is projected when PSMA-metastatic status is more 
adverse under salvage regimens that do not include systemic agents.
CONCLUSIONS: This decision-analytic modeling study projects that 
PSMA-PET/CT-guided management at biochemical recurrence after radical 
prostatectomy yields a modest survival benefit under the specified model inputs 
and assumptions regarding treatment distributions. These findings may complement 
emerging data on the corresponding economic costs and health-related quality of 
life.

AIM: To investigate the impact of preoperative exercise and nutritional 
interventions on postoperative complications, physical function, and activities 
of daily living (ADL) 1 year postoperatively in frail older patients with 
gastrointestinal cancer.
METHODS: This single-center, randomized controlled trial enrolled 62 patients 
aged ≥ 70 years scheduled to undergo elective surgery for gastrointestinal 
cancer with decreased grip strength or walking speed between October 2017 and 
December 2022. Participants were randomly assigned to control (n = 33) and 
intervention (n = 29) groups; the latter performed resistance exercises and 
consumed amino acid-containing jelly daily at home for 14 days. All participants 
were followed-up for 1 year.
RESULTS: After exclusion, 27 and 18 patients were enrolled in the control and 
intervention groups, respectively. The average age was 80.4 years, and 37.8% 
were male. Postoperative complications were observed in 51.9% and 44.4% of the 
control and intervention groups, respectively (95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.62-2.19), with postoperative delirium observed in 25.9% and 33.3%, 
respectively (95% CI 0.31-1.94). There were no significant inter-group 
differences in grip strength, walking speed, or skeletal muscle index. However, 
the intervention group showed superior knee extension strength maintenance 
(preoperatively: 100.2% ± 18.3% vs. 119.1% ± 68.8%, p = 0.19; discharge: 
86.7% ± 22.0% vs. 119.3% ± 72.0%, p = 0.044), and lower rates of decreased ADLs 
or death 1 year postoperatively (42.3% vs. 23.5%; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.08-1.92).
CONCLUSIONS: This 14-day preoperative exercise and nutritional intervention 
program did not significantly reduce postoperative complications in frail older 
patients with gastrointestinal cancer; however, it aided in maintaining knee 
extension strength at discharge.

OBJECTIVE: Lung cancer stigma remains a significant yet underexplored challenge, 
particularly in non-Western contexts. Our study aimed to explore how 
sociocultural factors shape the experiences of Malaysian lung cancer patients, 
with particular attention to stigma.
METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 
15 lung cancer patients at a local public hospital in Malaysia, which were 
analysed using coding reliability thematic analysis in conjunction with 
consensual qualitative research.
RESULTS: Our analysis showed that participants' narratives centred on the 
challenges they faced and the coping strategies they employed, which we mapped 
to the socio-ecological model to illustrate the sociocultural influences 
spanning individual, familial, social and systemic levels. At the individual 
level, smokers felt guilt, while non-smokers experienced confusion and distress 
about their diagnosis. Participants reported physical and emotional challenges, 
finding solace in faith, acceptance and cultural resilience. Within families, 
feelings of guilt and fear of burdening others constrained disclosure, yet 
collectivist norms of obligation and care meant that family members still 
provided crucial emotional and financial support. At the societal level, stigma 
associating lung cancer with smoking led to blame and isolation for both smokers 
and non-smokers. Systemic issues such as diagnostic delays, poor health care 
communication and financial burdens compounded these challenges.
CONCLUSION: Our study highlights how sociocultural values, stigma and systemic 
barriers are deeply intertwined in shaping lung cancer experiences in Malaysia. 
Interventions should be designed with sensitivity to religious beliefs, filial 
obligations and norms of emotional restraint while addressing stigma alongside 
health care barriers.

This study investigates methods of specimen extraction, pertinent clinical data 
and pathologic findings associated with minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for 
adnexal masses. This retrospective cohort study includes patients with an 
adnexal mass who underwent MIS removal. The association of categorical variables 
with adverse outcomes was investigated using Pearson chi-square or Fisher's 
exact test. Four hundred and thirty-eight patients met inclusion criteria. 
Surgical modalities included laparoscopic (n = 235, 53.7%), robotic (n = 165, 
37.7%), and vaginal (n = 1, 0.2%). MIS was converted to laparotomy in 37 cases 
(8.4%). 203 (46.3%) specimens were removed vaginally, and 235 (53.7%) 
abdominally. Three hundred and nineteen (72.8%) specimens were removed intact 
whereas 119 (27.2%) were morcellated or drained 113 contained). Of the 6 
uncontained morcellation cases, one was ovarian cancer, and one was a borderline 
tumor. For malignant histologies, receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy was not 
associated with specimen integrity (455 intact vs 12 morcellated, p = 0.207), 
route of specimen removal (31 vaginal vs 36 abdominal, p = 0.217), or use of a 
specimen bag (46 bag vs 21 no bag, p = 0.105). This study demonstrated that MIS 
is feasible in the majority of patients referred to our cancer center for an 
adnexal mass. Perioperative complications were uncommon. Management of the 
ovarian malignancies encountered in this cohort was not compromised by 
utilization of MIS.

BACKGROUND: Cardiotoxicity has emerged as a major clinical concern associated 
with targeted cancer therapies. While these agents, including tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs), HER2 inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors, and immune 
checkpoint inhibitors, revolutionize cancer treatment by selectively modulating 
tumor-associated molecular pathways, they inadvertently disrupt cardiovascular 
homeostasis due to the overlap of signaling mechanisms between tumorigenesis and 
cardiac physiology.
OBJECTIVES: This review aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying 
cardiotoxicity induced by targeted cancer therapies, outline diagnostic and 
preventive strategies, and highlight emerging approaches in cardio-oncology for 
optimizing patient outcomes.
METHODS: An integrative review of preclinical and clinical studies was conducted 
to analyze the cardiovascular effects of major targeted therapeutic classes. 
Mechanistic insights, diagnostic modalities, monitoring protocols, and ongoing 
clinical trials were critically examined to establish a translational 
perspective.
RESULTS: Targeted therapies induce cardiotoxicity through multiple pathways, 
including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, endothelial injury, and 
immune-mediated inflammation. Clinically, these effects manifest as 
hypertension, arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial ischemia. Diagnostic 
evaluation relies on echocardiography, cardiac biomarkers (e.g., troponin, BNP), 
and electrocardiography. Preventive and management strategies encompass baseline 
cardiovascular assessment, dose adjustment, use of cardioprotective agents, and 
continuous cardiac monitoring. Advances in cardio-oncology have promoted 
multidisciplinary management and integration of cardiovascular surveillance into 
cancer care protocols.
CONCLUSION: The growing prevalence of cardiotoxicity among cancer survivors 
underscores the need for collaborative, multidisciplinary care involving 
oncologists, cardiologists, and researchers. Individualized therapy guided by 
predictive biomarkers and novel imaging tools holds promise for balancing 
therapeutic efficacy with cardiovascular safety, thereby improving long-term 
survivorship and quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Undifferentiated-type gastric cancer (UGC) is more pathologically 
aggressive and progresses faster than differentiated-type gastric cancer (DGC). 
However, the impact of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) status on survival outcomes and 
clinicopathological features of UGC remains unclear.
METHODS: This multi-center retrospective study analyzed 571 patients 
pathologically confirmed UGC from January 2011 to December 2021. Clinical and 
histopathological features and survival outcomes were compared between Hp-naïve 
undifferentiated-type gastric cancer (HpNUGC) and Hp-infected 
undifferentiated-type gastric cancer (HpIUGC).
RESULTS: 571 patients including 283 HpNUGC (49.6%) and 288 HpIUGC (50.4%) were 
enrolled in survival analysis. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and 5-year 
overall survival (OS) rates were significantly lower in the HpNUGC group 
compared to the HpIUGC group (EFS: 46.3% vs. 64.3%, P < 0.001; OS: 54.3% vs. 
67.7%, P < 0.001). Hp-naïve status was associated with a 57% higher risk of 
disease progression, recurrence, or death, collectively termed ""events"" in this 
study (HR 1.57; 95% CI 1.20-2.04), and a 50% higher risk of all-cause mortality 
(HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.12-2.00). The HpNUGC lesions demonstrated larger tumor 
diameters (P < 0.001), deeper invasion depths (P < 0.001), more frequent 
lymphatic metastasis (P = 0.003), more advanced disease stages (P = 0.002), and 
higher rates of positive incision margins (P = 0.049).
CONCLUSION: HpNUGC is associated with worse survival outcomes and exhibits more 
malignant pathological features compared to HpIUGC. Future prospective studies 
are needed to clarify the relationship between Hp status and the development and 
progression of UGC.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) affects 22-88% of older adults and 
is associated with a lower quality of life and polypharmacy. It thus puts these 
already very vulnerable patients at a greater risk of medication-related harm.
AIM: This feasibility study aimed to implement a multimodal clinical pharmacy 
intervention to improve CNCP-related care for older adult inpatients on hospital 
geriatrics wards.
METHOD: We conducted a single-arm feasibility study from January to May 2025, 
including patients aged 65 or older, hospitalised on the geriatrics ward of a 
tertiary hospital in Switzerland and previously diagnosed with CNCP. Feasibility 
was defined as the ability to perform the intervention as planned and 
approximated by recruitment and dropout rates. The intervention included 
semi-structured interviews about patients' pain histories, collected 
patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and recorded therapy goals. 
Pharmacists then conducted medication reviews using a previously developed and 
validated trigger tool. The trigger tool was used as a standardised approach for 
identifying medication-related issues, comprising a set of previously validated 
quality indicators. Findings were discussed during interprofessional ward 
rounds. Final treatment decisions were made jointly with patients. We followed 
up with patients by telephone one month after hospital discharge.
RESULTS: Of 253 screened patients, we included 48 patients: 28 (58%) were 
interviewed, and 18 (38%) had a follow-up telephone call. Pharmacists suggested 
56 therapy changes, with 29 identified by the trigger tool and 27 identified by 
regular medication review. Therapy change acceptance rates by the care team were 
78% and 41%, respectively. Pain frequency and the highest and lowest pain levels 
over the last seven days all decreased after hospital discharge, although these 
changes cannot be causally attributed to the intervention. Other pain-related 
PROMs showed no change or just a slight improvement or deterioration.
CONCLUSION: The present feasibility study showed that implementing a clinical 
pharmacy intervention for older adult inpatients was indeed feasible. However, 
the recruitment rates were relatively low, and dropout rates were relatively 
high. Using a standardised approach involving a trigger tool showed promising 
results for detecting medication-related problems. These are important first 
indicators that including pharmacists more closely in standard care could be 
beneficial to CNCP patients.

BACKGROUND: Rural cancer survivors living with poverty and their partners have 
poorer health outcomes than their urban-dwelling counterparts and encounter 
barriers to implementing health behaviors that can improve quality of life. We 
investigated the readiness of geographically underserved (rural with high or 
persistent poverty) counties in Oregon to engage in health-related research to 
inform the subsequent conduct of a pilot study to assess the feasibility, 
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a live-remote, supervised dyadic 
exercise program (Exercising Together© (ET)) in couples coping with cancer in 
those counties.
METHODS: We conducted a community readiness assessment in five geographically 
underserved Oregon counties and calculated their readiness scores on a scale 
from 1 (no awareness) to 9 (professionalization). The pilot study recruited 
breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors and their intimate partners 
living in these five counties. Participants were assigned to one of two 
resistance training programs (ET or unsupervised, home-based exercise) for 
6 months. Feasibility was assessed by study accrual and retention, completion of 
surveys and testing visits, intervention adherence, and safety. Participants 
completed a post-intervention acceptability survey, performance testing, and 
patient-reported outcomes at 0, 6, and 12 months.
RESULTS: Readiness for health-related research varied but was low overall (2.7, 
denial/resistance, to 5.2, preparation). The pilot study enrolled 11 couples 
(31% accrual), with 73% residing in the highest readiness county. The study had 
high retention in the ET arm (93%) and high data completeness (surveys, 98%; 
performance testing visits, 96%), intervention adherence (ET, 93%; unsupervised, 
home-based exercise, 83%), and safety in both the ET and unsupervised, 
home-based exercise arms. ET received higher overall experience ratings than 
unsupervised, home-based exercise, and both survivors and partners in ET 
experienced large effect-size improvements in physical performance and smaller 
improvements in some patient-reported outcomes after the exercise program.
CONCLUSION: Delivering exercise via live-remote classes could address health 
disparities for rural cancer survivors by increasing access to supervised, 
evidence-based programs. Since readiness scores were aligned with pilot study 
enrollment, future studies should prioritize activating low-readiness counties 
to increase participation in exercise interventions for couples coping with 
cancer.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Live-remote exercise classes may increase 
access to supervised, evidence-based programs for rural cancer survivors.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between dyadic coping, intimate 
relationship, and reproductive concerns of breast cancer women of reproductive 
age and identify the mediational role of the intimate relationship in linking 
dyadic coping and reproductive concerns.
METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study enrolled only breast cancer 
patients aged 18-44 years. Finally, 296 participants aged 24-44 (38.38 ± 4.14) 
years were recruited. They completed the general information questionnaire, the 
Dyadic Coping Inventory, the Marriage Adjustment Test, and the Reproductive 
Concerns After Cancer Scale. Spearman correlation analysis was conducted to 
validate the association between study variables. The structural equation model 
was performed to confirm the hypothesized mediation model.
RESULTS: This study revealed that both dyadic coping (r = - 0.579, P < 0.001) 
and intimate relationship (r = - 0.670, P < 0.001) reported significantly 
negative concerning reproductive concerns. In contrast, dyadic coping was 
positively related to intimate relationship (r = 0.818, P < 0.001). 
Additionally, our results confirmed that intimate relationship was a mediator of 
the relation between dyadic coping and reproductive concerns (indirect 
effect = - 0.543, 95% confidence interval, - 0.719 to - 0.382).
CONCLUSION: Dyadic coping can impact patients' reproductive concerns through the 
intimate relationship, which should be considered a target for intervention. 
Health professionals should concentrate on implementing couple-based 
interventions to increase the level of dyadic coping and improve the intimate 
relationship between couples, which will reduce the level of reproductive 
concerns in patients.

Cancer continues to pose a significant global health challenge, with traditional 
therapies often limited by toxicity and resistance, underscoring the need for 
alternative strategies. Microorganisms and their bioactive products have emerged 
as valuable sources of novel anticancer agents. In this study, we isolated a 
wild-type bacterium from soil and performed a comprehensive taxonomic 
characterization. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, along 
with genome-based comparisons using average nucleotide identity (ANI), digital 
DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), average amino acid identity (AAI), and 
phylogenomic analysis, supported by detailed phenotypic profiling, confirmed the 
bacterium as a novel member of the genus Bacillus. Functional screening revealed 
that an intracellular protein fraction (~ 67 kDa) derived from this isolate 
exhibited potent anticancer activity against cervical and triple-negative breast 
cancer cells in vitro. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the protein 
fraction suppresses cancer cell growth by inducing apoptosis, arresting cell 
cycle progression, and inhibiting colony formation and migration. Additionally, 
it modulated the expression of key cancer-associated proteins involved in 
survival, proliferation, and metastasis. Taken together, this work not only 
establishes the taxonomic and microbiological identity of a novel Bacillus 
isolate but also underscores its therapeutic promise as a source of anticancer 
proteins.

PURPOSE: Physical activity is associated with a lower mortality and recurrence 
risk in cancer, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed 
to evaluate the effects of running sessions on the tumorigenic potential of 
prostate cancer cells using a 3D in vitro model.
METHODS: Fifteen healthy males completed two outdoor running sessions (5 km and 
10 km), interspersed by 1 month of wash-out time. Blood samples were collected 
before (PRE), immediately after (POST), and 3 h after (POST-3 h) sessions. Human 
serum (HS) samples were used to stimulate LNCaP and PC3 cell lines in 3D in 
vitro culture technique. The spheroid formation ability was quantified after 
21 days of incubation, using GelCount.
RESULTS: In both prostate cancer cell lines, a reduction in spheroid number was 
shown, by both running sessions and in all timepoints considered (LNCaP cells: 
5 km: - 23.8%; 10 km: - 5.6% POST HS; 5 km: - 37.8%; 10 km: - 34.8% POST-3 h HS; 
PC3 cells: 5 km: - 14%; 10 km: - 15.9% POST HS; 5 km: - 14.2%; 10 km: - 13% 
POST-3 h HS). The spheroid volume was reduced by 42.6% (5 km) and 51.1% (10 km) 
with POST-3 h HS, in LNCaP cells; no significant reduction was observed in PC3 
cells. No differences were found between the running sessions, while higher 
muscle mass, cardiorespiratory fitness and age were associated with greater 
reductions in spheroid number and volume, especially in LNCaP cells.
CONCLUSION: Running sessions reduce prostate cancer cell spheroid formation, 
especially in participants with higher physical fitness. Shorter running 
distances showed comparable effects to longer ones, highlighting practical 
implications for real-world exercise prescriptions in oncology.

Although gemcitabine (GEM) is the standard of care for most patients with 
pancreatic cancer (PC), its efficacy is limited by resistance development. 
Furthermore, p21-activated kinase-1 (PAK1) has been demonstrated to be involved 
in regulating the development of PC with GEM resistance. This study is designed 
to explore the role and mechanism of PAK1 in the GEM resistance of PC cells. 
PAK1, ubiquitin-specific peptidase 33 (USP33), methyltransferase-like 3 
(METTL3), and insulin-like growth factor-2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) mRNA 
levels were detected using RT-qPCR. PAK1, MDR1, MRP1, USP33, METTL3, and IGF2BP3 
protein levels were examined by western blot. GEM resistance, cell viability, 
proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration were assessed using MTT, EdU, 
flow cytometry, transwell, and wound healing assays. After ubibrowser database 
analysis, the interaction between USP33 and PAK1 was verified using 
co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay. Meanwhile, the interaction between METTL3 
and USP33 m6A was analyzed using methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP)-qPCR 
and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. A xenograft model analyzed the effects 
of PAK1 on GEM resistance of PC in vivo. PAK1 was upregulated in GEM-resistant 
PC tissues and cells. PAK1 knockdown enhanced cell sensitivity to GEM; repressed 
cell proliferation, invasion, and migration; and induced cell apoptosis in 
vitro. Mechanistically, USP33 triggered the deubiquitination of PAK1 and 
prevented its degradation. METTL3 stabilized USP33 mRNA through the 
m6A-IGF2BP3-dependent mechanism and naturally increased USP33 expression. USP33 
silencing increased the drug sensitivity of PC in vivo. METTL3 supports GEM 
resistance of PC cells partly by regulating USP33-mediated PAK1 
deubiquitination, providing a promising therapeutic target for GEM-resistant PC 
cells.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review provides an overview of the relationship among 
nutritional, environmental, and genetic factors in the development of the 
chronic inflammatory state, starting from the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
up to the onset of Colorectal Cancer (CRC). Finally, it also examines potential 
prospects and future topics of research taking into account the relation between 
nutrition and epigenetic factors.
RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence indicates that genetic and lifestyle-related factors 
play a crucial role in CRC etiology. Dietary intake may induce epigenetic 
alterations which in turn, result in carcinogenesis. Several bioactive 
components can modify epigenetic mechanisms, required for gene activation or 
silencing, thus, representing a potential way of preventing CRC. The gene-diet 
interaction analysis suggested some functions and pathways that may affect the 
CRC development. In this view, personalized nutrition, which is an approach that 
combines with new omics technologies, could represent a new possible key for 
personalized prevention and treatment in association with other cancer 
prevention and chemotherapeutic therapies.

β3-adrenergic receptors (β3-ARs) are increasingly recognized as modulators of 
tumor progression and treatment resistance across multiple cancer types. 
SR59230A, a β3-AR antagonist, has shown preclinical antitumor activity through 
mechanisms involving mitochondrial reactivation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
production, and antiangiogenic effects. Based on this premise, this study aimed 
to investigate the in vitro synergistic effects of SR59230A combined with 
standard chemotherapeutics or targeted therapies in various human cancer cell 
lines (glioblastoma, melanoma, triple-negative breast cancer, and anaplastic 
thyroid carcinoma) and endothelial cells (HUVECs). Cells were treated with 
SR59230A alone or in fixed-ratio combinations with temozolomide, paclitaxel, 
vemurafenib, lenvatinib, or sorafenib. Drug interactions were quantified using 
the Chou-Talalay method and validated with the Loewe additivity model. SR59230A 
exhibited dose-dependent antiproliferative activity, particularly in HUVECs and 
thyroid carcinoma cells. Synergistic effects were observed in all models, with 
the strongest synergy in A-2058 melanoma cells (SR59230A + vemurafenib), 
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and 8505C thyroid carcinoma cells 
(SR59230A + paclitaxel), U-87 glioblastoma cells (SR59230A + temozolomide), and 
HUVECs (SR59230A + lenvatinib or sorafenib). Dose reduction index (DRI) values 
confirmed the potential to lower cytotoxic drug doses while preserving efficacy. 
These findings suggest that SR59230A may enhance the efficacy of conventional 
and targeted anticancer agents through multimodal mechanisms. The consistent 
synergistic effects across diverse tumor types support further investigation 
into the role of SR59230A, including its effects on β3-AR, as a promising 
strategy to overcome resistance and optimize cancer therapy.

This study aimed to systematically synthesize the available evidence on 
prognostic factors affecting mortality in these patients. This review included 
cohort studies of adult patients with cancer diagnosed with Coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19). We searched MEDLINE and Embase for data from December 2019 to 
June 2025, and Cochrane Central Libraries and other databases for data to July 
2023. Two independent reviewers screened references, extracted data, and 
assessed bias risk. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and 
Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to evaluate the certainty of the evidence 
and present the relative and absolute effect sizes. Fifty-two prognostic factors 
were identified from 92 included studies. These included sociodemographic 
variables, comorbidities, cancer-related characteristics, COVID-19-related 
clinical features, and laboratory results. We found high certainty associations 
between an increased risk of death and male sex (absolute risk [AR] = 3.7%, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 2.1% to 5.8%), high Charlson Comorbidity Index 
(AR = 8.8%, 95% CI = 7.2%-10.6%), low performance status (AR = 14.7%, 95% 
CI = 11.2%-18.7%), immunosuppression (AR = 14.5%, 95% CI = 7.3%-24.6%), kidney 
disease (AR = 9.2%, 95% CI = 4.9%-14.7%), and lung cancer (AR = 7.2%, 95% 
CI = 3.5%-12.0%). Hypoxia, high creatinine, high C-reactive protein, high 
D-dimer, low hemoglobin, low lymphocytes, high procalcitonin, and high white 
blood cell counts were also associated with increased mortality with high 
certainty. This comprehensive GRADE-based systematic review provides healthcare 
providers with evidence-based prognostic factors to predict outcomes, counsel 
patients, and guide treatment decisions for cancer patients with COVID-19. The 
findings offer crucial insights for managing this vulnerable population during 
the pandemic.

Social Support and Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms Among Chinese Women With 
Breast Cancer.

BACKGROUND: Research confirmed that social support has an important impact on 
mental health, especially in traumatized individuals. Breast cancer patients who 
have experienced diagnosis, surgery and adjuvant treatment have distinct social 
support. They endured more posttraumatic stress symptoms in the course of their 
diseases. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether support was 
correlated with posttraumatic stress symptoms among breast cancer patients in 
China, explore the role of emotion status (including anxious and depressive 
symptoms) in this relationship, and further compare the magnitude of the two 
mediation effects.
METHODS: A total of 612 breast cancer patients who had completed surgery and 
were on chemotherapy (radiotherapy) participated in this study by completing a 
set of questionnaires derived from a combination of the Chinese Version of 
Furman and Buhrmester's Network of Relationships Inventory, the Chinese version 
of General Anxiety Symptoms Scale, the Chinese version of Patient Health 
Questionnaire, and the Chinese version of Posttraumatic Stress SymptomsScale.
RESULTS: The results revealed that social support was significantly negatively 
correlated with posttraumatic stress symptoms. Structural equation modeling 
showed that emotion status (including anxious and depressive symptoms) mediated 
the relationship between social support and posttraumatic stress symptoms. The 
two indirect effects do not differ significantly.
CONCLUSION: Negative emotion was one of the core responses of traumatized 
individuals. Improving emotion status (including anxious and depressive 
symptoms) in breast cancer patients may be one of the cruxes in the recovery of 
their posttraumatic stress symptoms. This prompts that providing more social 
support to breast cancer patients during treatment will relieve their anxious 
and depressive symptoms and thus alleviate their posttraumatic stress symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate adverse events in testicular cancer survivors using the 
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
Questionnaire-Testicular Cancer 26 (EORTC QLQ-TC26).
METHODS: Testicular cancer survivors at eight high-volume institutions in Japan 
were surveyed regarding age, International Germ Cell Consensus Classification, 
number of chemotherapy cycles, paclitaxel use, follow-up period after treatment, 
and adverse events scores of EORTC QLQ-TC26. Adverse events scores were assessed 
by the number of chemotherapy cycles and the follow-up period.
RESULTS: A total of 551 testicular cancer survivors responded to the adverse 
events questionnaires of EORTC QLQ-TC26. Median age at response was 43 years and 
median follow-up was 61 months. Chemotherapy was administered to 393 (71%) 
survivors, and paclitaxel was used in 91 (17%) survivors. Testicular cancer 
survivors who received three or more cycles of chemotherapy showed significantly 
worse adverse events scores than those without chemotherapy. Scores for tingling 
or numbness in the fingers or toes, pale/cold fingers or toes, and problems with 
hearing were affected by chemotherapy. Tingling or numbness tended to improve 
over time, whereas problems with hearing showed no evidence of improvement. In 
addition, scores for tingling or numbness were worse when paclitaxel was used.
CONCLUSIONS: Testicular cancer survivors suffered from adverse events with three 
or more cycles of chemotherapy, and problems with hearing did not improve after 
treatment. We should provide testicular cancer survivors with adequate 
information about long-lasting adverse events, particularly problems with 
hearing.

BACKGROUND: consideRATE is a patient- and care-partner-reported measure of care 
experience during serious illness. We used consideRATE with patients and care 
partners at the Dartmouth Cancer Center to assess patient experience, evaluate 
psychometric properties, and explore scoring approaches.
METHODS: Patients and care partners who are aged 18+ and English proficient 
participated in a cross-sectional survey. Participants completed consideRATE (8 
items), CANHELP Lite (21 items), and demographic questions. Reliability was 
assessed using Cronbach's α, and validity was evaluated with Pearson's 
correlations. Continuous and top-box scoring approaches were used. Psychometric 
properties were analyzed for patients, care partners, and subgroups with lower 
educational attainment or income.
RESULTS: 244 participants (114 patients, 128 care-partners, 2 unspecified) 
completed the survey. consideRATE has internal reliability (α = 0.86); the 
correlation (r) between consideRATE continuous scoring and CANHELP Lite scores 
for all participants was 0.5; p < 0.001, for patients 0.5; p < 0.001, for 
care-partners 0.5; p < 0.001, for patients (n = 71) with lower educational 
attainment 0.5, p < 0.001, and for patients (n = 50) with lower income 0.7, 
p < 0.001. We also found correlations between consideRATE top-box scoring and 
CANHELP Lite scores for all participants (rpb = 0.4, p < 0.001), with stronger 
associations among the patient (rpb = 0.5, p < 0.001) and lower income 
(rpb = 0.6, p = 0.005) subgroups. We found discriminant validity between 
consideRATE and Single-item Health Literacy (SIL) measures for continuous 
scoring (r = -0.05 to 0.09, p > 0.05) and top-box scoring (r = -0.02 to 0.09, 
p > 0.05). We found no significant difference in overall experience between 
patients with solid and hematologic malignancy cancer categories.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated in this sample of patients attending a cancer center 
that consideRATE has good internal reliability and is well correlated with 
CANHELP Lite.

INTRODUCTION: Cancer is one of the predominant causes of mortality globally. 
Radiation, surgery, and chemotherapy are currently available methods for 
treating cancer. Each of these approaches has known adverse effects. Due to 
their better efficacy and safety over traditional chemotherapy drugs, targeted 
therapeutic medicines are quickly becoming standard cancer treatments.
AREAS COVERED: Small molecules have several advantages, such as being able to be 
given orally and having the capacity to pass through cell membranes and enter 
intracellular spaces. This review is going to focus on small molecules as 
anticancer scaffolds and researchers will be able to design new antineoplastic 
compounds in the future on the basis of the thoroughly discussed SAR 
investigation, preclinical data, clinical outcomes, and FDA approved molecules.
EXPERT OPINION: Since there is currently no cure for most forms of disseminated 
cancer, the development of novel active chemotherapeutic drugs is essential. 
Small molecules are interesting drug candidates as they are able to target 
important molecular pathways with selectivity. An in-depth analysis of the SAR 
study and the available preclinical and clinical data can greatly assist in the 
development of the next generation of anticancer drugs that would be more 
potent, selective, and would interfere with fewer side effects.

Inflammation is an enabling characteristic that contributes to the acquisition 
of hallmarks of cancer. Epidemiological studies have suggested a potential 
connection between periodontitis and increased risk of cancer. However, the 
underlying mechanisms of this connection remain insufficiently studied. Here, we 
found that periodontitis promoted the progression of oral squamous cell 
carcinoma and prostate cancer and fostered an immunosuppressive tumor 
microenvironment (iTME) characterized by expanded myeloid-derived suppressor 
cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages, and regulatory T cells in mouse 
models. Periodontitis also enhanced the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs and 
decreased the infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Moreover, periodontitis-induced 
systemic inflammation remodeled the bone marrow (BM) ecosystem, resulting in 
myeloid-biased hematopoiesis, which was accompanied by expansion of 
hematopoietic progenitors (LSK), multipotent progenitor 3 (MPP3), and 
granulocyte-monocyte precursors, followed by the subsequent augmentation of 
myeloid cell production. Mechanistically, interleukin (IL)-1 signaling, 
triggered by periodontitis, induced alterations in the myelopoiesis program. The 
conditional inhibition of IL-1R1 in the BM attenuated the tumor-promoting effect 
of periodontitis, diminished abnormal myeloid overproduction, and improved the 
TME. Thus, these findings reveal that periodontitis remotely induces a myeloid 
bias in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and that the IL-1-mediated 
periodontitis-BM axis serves as a critical mechanism for 
periodontitis-facilitated tumor development and iTME establishment.

Functioning as a critical regulatory enzyme within the mitogen-activated protein 
kinase (MAPK) cascade, BRAF kinase orchestrates fundamental biological 
mechanisms while exhibiting high mutation prevalence in malignant pathologies, 
including cutaneous melanoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma. While selective BRAF 
inhibitors show efficacy, their use is hampered by drug resistance and 
compensatory pathway activation. Dual-target inhibitors, which simultaneously 
block BRAF and another oncogenic target, offer a promising strategy to enhance 
therapeutic effects, reduce resistance, and minimize off-target toxicity. These 
drugs synergistically disrupt compensatory mechanisms, demonstrating robust 
antitumor activity in preclinical models. This review highlights the structural 
characteristics and functional roles of BRAF kinase, elucidating its 
significance in disease pathogenesis and therapeutic targeting. Furthermore, it 
investigates emerging trends in pharmacological intervention strategies, 
particularly focusing on the advancement and clinical potential of dual-target 
therapeutic approaches within the framework of modern drug discovery. Through 
critical analysis of recent developments, the discussion extends to evaluating 
challenges and opportunities in designing multi-target agents from a molecular 
design standpoint.

Gemcitabine (GEM) serves as a first-line chemotherapeutic agent for pancreatic 
cancer (PC), but its clinical efficacy is significantly limited by the emergence 
of drug resistance, necessitating in-depth exploration of the underlying 
molecular mechanisms. This study employed the TCGA database to analyze ST8SIA4 
expression, revealing consistent downregulation in PC tumor tissues compared to 
matched normal adjacent tissues. A GEM-resistant cell model (SW1990/GEM) was 
generated from SW1990 cells through incremental dose induction to further 
investigate resistance pathways. Experimental analyses included qPCR and Western 
blotting for gene and protein expression, CHX chase assays for protein 
stability, CO-IP for protein-protein interactions, CCK-8 tests for cellular 
proliferation, and flow cytometry for apoptotic rates. Results demonstrated that 
ST8SIA4 downregulation was prevalent in both PC tissues and the SW1990/GEM 
model. Overexpression of ST8SIA4 suppressed GEM resistance in SW1990/GEM cells 
and upregulated hENT1 protein expression; however, this effect was attenuated by 
an N-linked glycosylation inhibitor. Crucially, silencing hENT1 counteracted the 
resistance inhibition induced by ST8SIA4 overexpression. Collectively, these 
findings indicate that ST8SIA4 regulates N-linked glycosylation of hENT1, 
thereby stabilizing hENT1 protein expression and reversing GEM resistance in PC, 
offering a potential therapeutic target for overcoming chemotherapy resistance.

Oral cancer often develops from oral potentially malignant disorders. Oral 
leukoplakia (OL) is the most common oral potentially malignant disorder. 
However, not all patients with OL develop oral cancer in their lifetimes, and 
cancer risk assessment is challenging. This study developed a time-to-event 
artificial intelligence-based model (termed OralCancerPredict) that integrated 
patient characteristics, histologic features, and immunohistochemical indicators 
for precise prediction of cancer progression in OL. We performed a retrospective 
analysis of patient data (n = 456) and tissue samples (n = 1,312) obtained 
before cancer progression or at last follow-up for patients with OL. KRT13 and 
p53 immunohistochemistry and quantitative analyses were performed for tissue 
samples, while independent prognostic features, including demographic 
characteristics, clinical information, and histopathologic findings, were 
obtained for patients in the cohort. KRT13 and p53 expression was combined with 
histologic and patient data for model training, testing, and external 
validation. Performance evaluation for OralCancerPredict included model 
discriminative ability, calibration, explainability, and net benefit analysis 
via decision curves. External validation was also performed to ensure model 
generalizability based on patient data (n = 119) and tissue samples (n = 322) 
unused for training and testing. Our findings showed that OralCancerPredict 
trained on multidimensional data had good concordance indices (0.855 to 0.867), 
areas under the curve (0.877 to 0.882), and integrated Brier scores (0.046 to 
0.069) at testing and external validation. Explainability analysis confirmed the 
importance of KRT13 and p53 deregulated expression and World Health Organization 
dysplasia grading to OralCancerPredict in predicting the risk of cancerization 
and cancer progression-free survival. Moreover, the model had a better net 
benefit than the World Health Organization and binary dysplasia grading systems 
alone, which represent the current risk stratification methods in OL management. 
Overall, OralCancerPredict can predict the risk of cancer development and cancer 
progression-free survival for patients with OL, with good discrimination, 
calibration, and net benefit. The explainable artificial intelligence model has 
the potential to streamline intervention and close monitoring in the clinical 
management of OL.

OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates fall short of national goals. 
This study aimed to understand eligible individuals' preferences regarding CRC 
screening modalities to improve screening adherence.
METHODS: Two cohorts took a discrete choice experiment survey: adults aged 45-75 
years at average risk for CRC, and physicians who recommend CRC screening. Five 
attributes (test type, test frequency, true positive rate, true negative rate, 
adenoma true positive rate) from four different CRC screening modalities 
(cell-free DNA blood test [cf-DNA-BT], colonoscopy, fecal immunochemistry test 
[FIT], multi-target stool DNA [mt-sDNA] test) were assessed. Test-specific 
performance was derived from clinical data. Predicted choice probability (PrCP) 
of each modality was calculated from the results of a mixed logit model. 
Subgroup analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Among 1,249 adult respondents, mt-sDNA was the preferred modality (PrCP 
39.4%) versus colonoscopy (24.8%), cf-DNA-BT (21.1%), and FIT (14.7%). In all 
subgroups, respondents preferred mt-sDNA. Respondents with previous noninvasive 
CRC screening experience (PrCP 53.5%) and with no prior CRC screening (42.1%) 
preferred mt-sDNA. PrCP for colonoscopy was lower for populations historically 
less likely to be adequately screened for CRC (such as 45-49-year-old 
respondents [PrCP 21.1%] and non-White respondents [23.1%]). PrCP among 400 
physicians was highest for colonoscopy (PrCP 95.0%) versus mt-sDNA (4.3%), 
cf-DNA-BT (0.4%), and FIT (0.3%). No significant difference in preferences was 
found between primary care providers and gastroenterologists.
CONCLUSION: US adults eligible for CRC screening preferred mt-sDNA testing over 
other screening modalities, while physicians highly preferred colonoscopy. 
Offering CRC screening options that align with patient preferences may result in 
higher screening adherence.

Glycans found on the ErbB family of receptors (HER1, HER2, and HER3) represent 
promising targets for cancer treatment. Characterization and full quantification 
of the bivalent kinetic interactions of therapeutic antibodies against the ErbB 
family of receptors directly in their native cancer cellular environment 
represent a unique strategy to help overcome cancer drug resistance and to the 
development of more effective therapeutic drugs. In this study, surface plasmon 
resonance microscopy (SPRM) was implemented in a unique and innovative manner to 
quantify the bivalent kinetic interactions of monoclonal antibodies targeting 
HER1 (EFGR), HER2 and HER3 directly on whole BXPC3 pancreatic cancer cells under 
a glycosylated (native) and deglycosylated cellular environment. Results 
revealed in unprecedented detail that both the single-arm affinity and 
double-arm stronger avidity modes of binding interaction could be observed. For 
bivalent Cetuximab (anti-HER1) KDs of 151 nM and 4.6 nM were observed, for 
bivalent Herceptin (anti-HER2) KDs of 2 nM and 0.1 nM were observed, and for 
bivalent anti-HER3 KDs of 13 nM and 1.3 nM were observed. However, upon 
enzymatic N-deglycosylation of BXPC3 cells, HER1 and HER3 demonstrated 
significant increase in affinity of 1000-fold and 21-fold, respectively. In 
contrast, HER2 kinetic interactions were negligibly influenced by cellular 
N-deglycosylation of BXPC3 cells. This study highlights for the first time 
SPRM's unique ability to characterize the bivalent heterogeneous kinetic 
interactions of monoclonal antibodies with ErbB receptors on whole cancer cells, 
and to quantify the shielding influence of pancreatic cancer cell surface 
N-glycosylation on these interactions.

PurposeThis project aimed to describe variability of local evaluations of 
off-label cancer drug requests by submitting a list of identical requests to 
different Italian centers.MethodsIn October 2024, oncology unit directors listed 
in the AIOM Libro Bianco were invited to participate, evaluating 11 clinical 
cases with solid tumors through their internal approval process. Supporting 
evidence was retrospective in two cases, based on phase II trials in seven, and 
phase III trials in two. Inter-rater agreement was measured using Fleiss' 
kappa.ResultsSeven centers completed evaluations. Two cases were approved by all 
centers, both with a rare cancer with scant alternatives. The mean number of 
centers approving the individual requests was 5.36/7 (76.6%) with a poor 
inter-rater agreement (kappa 0.009, 95% CI -0.120 to 0.138). Single centers 
approved a mean of 8.4 requests (76.6%). The mean number of centers that 
approved requests was 5.5 for requests based on retrospective studies, 5.3 for 
those based on phase II trials, and 5.5 for those based on phase III trials. 
There was no correlation between estimated cost and chance of 
approval.ConclusionsThere is a significant inter-hospital variability in 
off-label oncology drug evaluations, leading to potential disparities in 
patient's access to care.

PURPOSE: Hospital admission is frequently required in the cancer trajectory. In 
a context of bed shortage, pressure on Emergency Departments and increasing 
healthcare costs, promoting actions that contain hospital stay is a priority. We 
studied the variables able to predict longer hospital stays.
METHODS: We retrospectively retrieved data on consecutive admissions in our 
cancer inpatient unit in a 6-month period and assessed individual and clinical 
variables potentially related with duration of hospital stay through univariate 
and multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: Among the 147 included admissions, mean overall duration of hospital 
stay was 8.46 days (95% I.C. 8.36 to 8.55). Significant differences were shown 
for two clusters of variables: 1) the clinical condition causing admission: 
non-controlled disease vs responding disease (10.0 vs 6.8 days, p: 0.006); 
cancer-related symptoms vs acute events (not directly cancer-related) or 
toxicity (9.8 - 6.0 - 7.2 days, respectively; p: 0.05). 2) The discharge 
modality: discharge at home (6.2 days) vs assisted discharge either at home or 
in a long-term structure or in hospice (11.0 and 12.5 days, respectively; p: 
0.0001). Disease control and discharge modality retained statistical 
significance also in the multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Admissions for which a long hospital stay is advisable can be 
anticipated from patients' entry. Actions on faster symptom control and 
discharge preparedness may have a strong impact on duration of stay and on bed 
availability.

Breast cancer (BC) is identified as a significant cause of cancer mortality in 
the female population. The recurrence of initial tumors and the metastasis to 
remote areas of the body are significant factors leading to the mortality linked 
with BC. Despite the advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, a 
comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying metastasis is 
still unclear, particularly regarding the regulatory role of non-coding RNAs 
(ncRNAs) in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Different categories of 
ncRNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), and long ncRNAs 
(lncRNAs), can manage the complex regulatory frameworks of EMT at various 
levels. Since dysregulation of ncRNAs is associated with key processes in EMT, 
investigating them as valuable tools for identifying the metastatic potential of 
tumors at an early stage could significantly increase diagnostic accuracy and 
improve patient outcomes, particularly in BC. This review aims to bridge this 
gap by systematically summarizing current insights into the interplay between 
EMT and various classes of ncRNAs in the context of BC progression. We discuss 
the molecular pathways through which ncRNAs regulate EMT, their impact on 
metastasis and explore their potential as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic 
targets. By providing an integrative overview of recent findings, this article 
highlights unresolved questions and proposes directions for future research, 
offering a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians involved in breast 
cancer biology and treatment development.

Plain Language Summary: Breast cancer metastasis is largely driven by a process 
called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which helps tumor cells spread 
to distant organs.Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including miRNAs, lncRNAs, and 
circRNAs, play a major role in regulating EMT at various molecular 
levels.Dysregulation of these ncRNAs can promote tumor progression and may have 
potential as early indicators of metastatic potential in breast 
cancer.Understanding the interaction between EMT and ncRNAs could lead to better 
diagnostic biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies for breast cancer patients.

KMT5C-mediated histone H4 lysine 20 trimethylation (H4K20me3) has traditionally 
been linked to heterochromatin formation and maintenance, playing a crucial role 
in maintaining genome integrity. Emerging evidence, however, indicates that 
perturbations of KMT5C-H4K20me3 are also implicated in various cancers, 
positioning KMT5C-H4K20me3 as a promising target for anti-cancer therapies. 
Despite this, the precise mechanisms underlying KMT5C recruitment to its genomic 
targets and the specific genes it regulates remain poorly understood. In this 
review, we explore the dysregulation of KMT5C-mediated H4K20me3 in cancer, 
providing a comprehensive overview of its known functions. We also highlight 
recent findings that suggest a novel, non-canonical pathway for H4K20me3 
deposition by KMT5C, and, while early on, insight into future opportunities for 
therapeutic intervention.

BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) was the sixth most 
common cancer worldwide. Given the evidence that adipocytes are related to the 
progression of various cancers, this study explored the internal connection and 
mechanism between HNSCC and adipocytes.
METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to examine the 
transfection efficiency of integrin subunit α5 (ITGA5) overexpression plasmid 
and small interfering RNA of ITGA5 (si-ITGA5). Colony formation assay was 
employed to detect the colony formation rate of FaDu and SAS cells, while flow 
cytometry was used to measure cell apoptosis rate. The protein levels of 
cleaved-caspase-3 (apoptosis marker) and cell adhesion markers (ITGA5, integrin 
subunit β1 (ITGB1) and cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44)) were analyzed by 
western blotting. After HNSCC cells and adipocytes were co-cultured, the last 
three experiments above-mentioned were repeated and Calcein AM/EthD-1 double 
stain assay was performed to examine anoikis.
RESULTS: Overexpressed ITGA5 enhanced colony formation and inhibited anoikis in 
HNSCC cells (p < 0 p < .001), while reducing the expression of the 
apoptosis-related protein and increasing those of adherence-related proteins 
(p < 0.05). However, si-ITGA5 had the opposite effect. After co-culture of HNSCC 
cells with adipocytes, cell colony formation was increased, anoikis was 
inhibited and the expressions of ITGA5 and cell adhesion markers were 
upregulated (p < 0.05). The effects of HNSCC cells co-cultured with adipocytes 
on colony formation, anoikis and cell adhesion markers were reversed by ITGA5 
silencing (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Adipocytes promote anoikis resistance of head and neck cancer cells 
via overexpressed ITGA5.

Auxin-derived carbon dots (Aux-CDs) were synthesized and evaluated for their 
dual functionality in biomedical and agricultural contexts. One-step 
hydrothermal synthesis was employed for the first time to produce eco-friendly 
and cost-effective Aux-CDs. The approach involves introducing a mixture of Auxin 
and water into the reactor. The fluorescence in the Aux-CDs was initially 
confirmed using a UV transilluminator. Physicochemical characterizations were 
evaluated via UV-Vis spectrophotometry (absorbance at 470 nm), zeta potential 
measurement (-37.8 mV), photoluminescence, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 
and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR). The total quantum yield exhibited was 
43%, and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed a size range of 
approximately 10 nm. In cancer cells, the MTT assay revealed that Aux-CDs 
demonstrated low cytotoxicity in 4T1 cells up to 10 µg/mL. The fluorescence 
accumulation indicates the internalization of the Aux-CDs by 4T1 cells. In seed 
performance, we examined the effects of Aux-CDs on through nanopriming. The 
wheat seeds (the Drum and Ehsan varieties) were incubated with CDs to check the 
absorption of Aux-CDs by them. The fluorescence was observed under a 
UV-transilluminator in the growing parts of seeds, indicating the absorption of 
Aux-CDs during wheat growth. Cancer cell and wheat imaging showed that 
fluorescent Aux-CDs could be used as a bioimaging agent. Additionally, Aux-CDs 
significantly improved seed germination percentage and the performance index in 
the Drum and Ehsan varieties in low concentration (1 µg/mL) compared to high 
concentration (10 µg/mL). Consequently, Aux-CDs synthesized via a one-step 
hydrothermal method exhibit high quantum yield and biocompatibility, and can act 
as multifunctional nanomaterials for bioimaging and plant growth enhancement in 
biomedical and agricultural research.

Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in 
pyrimidine de novo synthesis and represents a promising target for cancer 
therapy. However, current inhibitors of DHODH have limited clinical 
effectiveness and adverse effects. Herein, we report NK-A 17E-233I, a novel 
small-molecule inhibitor of the human DHODH enzyme, identified through a 
prospective virtual screening methodology. Molecular docking and biochemical 
assays show NK-A 17E-233I functions as a pure or partial competitive inhibitor 
with respect to the natural substrate, dihydroorotate (DHO). It adopts a 
distinct binding mode from classical inhibitors that target the flavin 
mononucleotide (FMN) binding cavity of the hydrophobic tunnel. NK-A 17E-233I 
exhibits selective cytotoxicity in both human cancer cell lines and 
patient-derived intestinal organoids, inducing DNA damage, S-phase arrest, and 
cell death. Unlike Brequinar, NK-A 17E-233I preserves mitochondrial respiration 
via complexes I and II and maintains ATP-linked basal respiration, avoiding the 
impairment of the electron transport chain (ETC). Our findings imply the 
aptitude of NK-A 17E-233I as a novel competitive inhibitor of human DHODH, 
representing a significant advancement in this field since the 1990s.

Neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis), previously described as an 
effector host defense mechanism, is more frequently associated with 
cancer-driven inflammation and tumor development. In the case of breast cancer, 
NETosis assists with several oncogenic processes, including 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition, immune evasion, organotropic metastasis, 
angiogenesis, and resistance to therapy. The current study summarizes the 
evidence of the mechanistic role of NETs in breast cancer and their potential to 
act as a diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic biomarker. Like many other 
promising candidates for novel prognostic or diagnostic biomarkers, 
citrullinated histone H3 (citH3), myeloperoxidase-DNA (MPO-DNA) complexes, and 
circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) need further validation to be functional. 
However, there is some evidence suggesting clinical relevance. Like many 
candidate therapeutic indices, several therapies are exploring targeting 
NETosis, including deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) and peptidyl arginine deiminase 
4 (PAD4) inhibitors, as a clinical intervention. However, methodological 
differences across studies and a lack of standardized detection of NETs are 
likely impeding future findings. Future insight into the efficiency of detection 
methods and consistency of experimental design will be beneficial for 
transferring NETosis to the clinic.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer treatment efficacy remains a challenge due to limited 
therapeutic targets. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme, a crucial enzyme 
linking the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain, is implicated in 
cancer metabolism. While existing compounds target metabolic diseases in vitro, 
SDH-targeted therapy for lung cancer remains elusive.
METHODS: We assessed SDH expression levels in non-small cell lung (NSCLC) 
tissues and cell lines. Leveraging AtomNet® technology for compound 
identification, coupled with mitochondria- and cell-based enzyme activity 
assays, we discovered new SDH inhibitors. Using 2D monolayer, 3D organoid 
culture, and assays for cell viability, migration, mitochondrial reactive oxygen 
species, oxygen consumption rate, succinate accumulation, and apoptosis, we 
elucidated their mechanism targeting lung malignancy.
RESULTS: SDH subunits were found to be overexpressed in NSCLC tissues compared 
to tumor-adjacent normal tissues. Two new SDH inhibitors were identified from 96 
predicted candidates. Cellular thermal shift assay confirmed direct binding of 
these small molecules to SDH subunits in lung cancer cells. Mechanistically, 
treatment increased cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, 
succinate accumulation, and induced apoptosis by damaging mitochondria and DNA, 
while modulating SDH protein expression. Functionally, these molecules reduced 
growth, migration, and 3D organoid formation in lung cancer cell lines in vitro, 
both short and long term.
CONCLUSIONS: Our SDH inhibitors halt tumor growth and migration by targeting key 
substrate binding sites, showing superior efficacy over existing small molecule 
antagonists. They also modulate SDH protein expression, suggesting a promising 
dual-targeting strategy for cancer therapy. This study sheds light on SDH 
function in cancer-related metabolic dysfunction and underscores the potential 
of SDH modulation as a therapeutic strategy for lung cancer and beyond.

OBJECTIVE: To develop new DALY-based indices for measuring productivity loss, 
health system resilience, and resource allocation efficiency for liver cancer 
across eight MENA countries. These will be combined into the Integrated 
Health-Adjusted Productivity Index (IHAPI) to aid health policy development.
SETTING: The final analysis utilized 289,067 data entries from a total of 
394,944, including information from Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Turkey, Saudi 
Arabia, Oman, and the UAE from 2000 to 2021.
DESIGN: This study adopted a cross-country approach, employing secondary data to 
develop six composite measures: the Health-Adjusted Productivity Loss Index 
(HAPLI), the Economic Vulnerability to Health Impact Index (EVHI), the Relative 
Resilience to Liver Cancer Loss Index (RLCL), the Resource Allocation Efficiency 
Index (RAEI), the Health System Response Index (HSRI), and the Sustainable 
Development Health Equity Index (SD-HEI). These measures were aggregated into 
the IHAPI score.
RESULTS: The analysis revealed that the most significant factor influencing the 
IHAPI score was the EVHI (feature importance = 0.73). Egypt exhibited the 
highest growth in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY), leading to substantial 
productivity loss (HAPLI), while Saudi Arabia and Jordan demonstrated greater 
resilience (as indicated by higher RLCL scores and less variability in the 
IHAPI). The UAE and Turkey reported strong HSRI and Productivity Performance 
Index (PPI) rates, suggesting better-coordinated preventive investments. 
Conversely, the highest variability in the indices was observed in Iran and 
Oman, particularly in the SD-HEI and Total Productivity Loss and Inequality 
Index (TPLTI), indicating unstable equity and trends. Kuwait exhibited moderate 
performance in burden and resource allocation indices.
CONCLUSION: This paper presents an integrative model for evaluating both

BACKGROUND: Preoperative assessment of lymph node status is crucial in guiding 
treatment decisions for gastric cancer (GC) patients. However, it may not always 
accurately detect occult lymph node metastasis (OLNM). Identifying patients at 
high risk for OLNM despite negative preoperative imaging (cN0) is critical for 
optimizing treatment strategies, particularly the consideration of neoadjuvant 
therapy or the extent of lymphadenectomy.
METHODS: GC patients with cTanyN0M0 who underwent upfront surgery at the Sixth 
Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 2008 to May 2023 were 
analyzed. Patients were stratified by postoperative pathological nodal 
involvement, and clinicopathological characteristics were compared, and a 
nomogram was constructed.
RESULTS: A total of 722 patients were reviewed, 261 (36.15%) patients had 
postoperative pathologic lymph node involvement (pN+). The 5-year overall 
survival in the pN0 group and pN + group was 97.8% and 84.85% (p < 0.01), 
respectively. Multivariate analysis identified several variables associated with 
pN+, including body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m2 (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.02–3.93, 
p < 0.01), serum carbohydrate antigen (CA)-199 (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.31–4.95, 
p < 0.01), T2 staging (OR 4.71, 95% CI 2.70–8.54, p < 0.01), T3 staging (OR 8.0, 
95% CI 4.71–13.99, p < 0.01), T4 staging (OR 15.81, 95% CI 6.39–41.45, 
p < 0.01), and poorly differentiated tumor (OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.46–6.79, 
p < 0.01). A nomogram constructed using those variables showed good 
discriminatory performance (AUC = 0.729) in predicting OLNM in GC.
CONCLUSION: BMI, CA-199, T stage, and differentiation are associated with OLNM 
in GC. A nomogram predicting OLNM could help physicians in selecting optimal 
treatment strategies for GC patients. However, the model has not undergone 
external validation, and its clinical use should await confirmation in 
multicenter, prospective cohorts.

BACKGROUND: Children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer (referred to as 
CAYAs) are at risk of long-term health complications, with cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) being a major concern. In addition, sociodemographic 
characteristics and traditional cardiovascular risk factors may also contribute 
to disparities in outcomes compared with those of the general population. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the timing, patterns, and combinations of 
CVDs, as well as associated morbidity, mortality, and sociodemographic factors, 
in CAYAs with CVD compared with matched controls with CVD.
METHODS: A register-based cohort study consisting of all Swedish cancer patients 
under 25 years old and during a 63-year observation time was used. CAYAs and 
controls with CVD (n = 58,981) were included and compared in terms of the timing 
and combinations of CVD, and mortality.
RESULTS: The median age at first CVD was 41.8 years in CAYAs and 49.6 years in 
controls (p < 0.0001), with male CAYAs being the youngest at 25.0 years. During 
a median follow-up of 34.6 years, most CAYAs (65.2%) developed one CVD, while 
two or three coexisting CVDs occurred in 20.2% and 8.2%, respectively. Mostly 
hypertension in combination with cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease 
and arrhythmias. More than three CVDs were more common in CAYAs than in controls 
(6.4% vs. 5.9%). A total of 21.8% of the CAYAs died, and the risk of all-cause 
mortality after the first CVD was 2.43-fold greater (hazard ratio (HR) 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 2.31-2.54, p < 0.0001), and for cardiovascular 
mortality, the risk was 2.17-fold greater (HR 95% CI 2.02-2.33, p < 0.0001) than 
that of the controls. In CAYAs with CVD, older age, male sex, and living in the 
central part of Sweden were associated with higher mortality, whereas higher 
education and marriage were protective (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with controls CAYAs develop advanced CVD and combinations 
of multiple CVDs earlier in life, and they have a greater risk of all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality. Factors associated with increased mortality risk 
include male sex and geographic variation, whereas marriage and higher education 
appear to be protective.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the fourth most frequently diagnosed cancer in 
women globally. Ghana, West of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), is reported to have a 
high crude cervical cancer incidence of 18.3 per 100,000 women. Cervical cancer 
screening (CCS) uptake in Ghana has been reported to be between 0.8% and 12%. 
Ghana, like many developing countries worldwide, are yet to experience the 
benefits of organised screening. This study sought to understand the direct and 
indirect actions of key stakeholders in Ghana that contributed to the promotion 
of CCS in a country without a population-based screening programme.
METHODOLOGY: Primary qualitative data was obtained from 16 stakeholders using 
in-depth interviews via ZOOM virtual platform. Stakeholders were those involved 
in the delivery of CCS activities and were identified through purposive and 
snowball sampling. Transcripts were manually created from verbatim accounts of 
interviews. Data was managed in NVivo software and analysed using an inductive 
approach to qualitative data evaluation. Emerging themes were drawn out by 
thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Key findings identified were intra-health facility-based factors that 
promoted CCS including cost control measures, screening methods, opportunistic 
CCS, promotion linked activities and innovative health practices. Additionally, 
sponsored mass CCS, staff training, policy advocacy and proactive health 
promotion and education were extra-health facility-based factors that 
stakeholders felt led to CCS uptake at the facility and community levels. 
Stakeholders played an active role in promoting CCS using health education 
through health promotional measures such as mass media advertisements, 
electronic fliers, creating social media content especially during the Cervical 
Cancer Awareness Month (CCAM) in January. CCS costs were often reduced during in 
January because of negotiations with non-governmental organisations and 
corporate bodies, ultimately resulting in sponsored mass cervical cancer 
screening which improved cervical cancer screening uptake.
CONCLUSION: In the absence of a national cervical cancer screening programme, 
the study found out that it is the contributions of committed stakeholders that 
may be ensuring the continued existence of CCS services in Ghana. The goodwill 
that is shown by society during the CCAM in January should be harnessed to 
broaden the scope and reach of cervical screening activities beyond January.

BACKGROUND: The prognosis prediction of breast cancer is a challenging problem 
in the clinic. Identifying reliable biomarkers and revealing the regulatory 
mechanism underlying the progression of breast cancer cells would benefit the 
treatment and outcomes of breast cancer patients.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to explore a novel biomarker related with tumor 
progression and clinical prognosis, focusing on miR-4793-3p and its targets.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study enrolled 133 patients with breast cancer, and 
tissue samples were obtained. Expression of miR-4793-3p and its clinical 
significance were evaluated from the perspective of molecular subtypes, disease 
development, and prognosis. The regulatory effect and mechanism of miR-4793-3p 
in the biological function of breast cancer cells were assessed.
RESULTS: Significant downregulation of miR-4793-3p was observed in tumor tissues 
of patients with breast cancer, and lower miR-4793-3p levels were found in 
patients with more malignant subtypes. miR-4793-3p was closely associated with 
the differentiation, TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, subtypes, and poor 
prognosis of patients and was identified as an independent prognostic factor. 
miR-4793-3p significantly suppressed cell growth, metastatic potential, and 
promoted ferroptosis of breast cancer, and the negative regulation of RNF169 was 
revealed to mediate the function of miR-4793-3p. JAK2/STAT3 signaling was 
suppressed by miR-4793-3p, which suppressed cell growth and metastatic potential 
and promoted ferroptosis.
CONCLUSION: miR-4793-3p could act as a biomarker for breast cancer, indicating 
cancer development and predicting patients' outcomes. miR-4793-3p modulated 
ferroptosis and therefore regulated tumor progression via suppressing JAK2/STAT3 
signaling by targeting RNF169.

Pancreatic cancer, specifically pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), is 
notorious for its aggressive nature and dismal prognosis, ranking as a leading 
cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite advancements in surgical 
techniques, chemotherapies, and novel therapeutic approaches, the overall 
survival rates remain bleak, primarily due to the complex and dynamic tumor 
microenvironment (TME) which fosters cancer progression and therapeutic 
resistance. Central to the TME are cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which 
exhibit significant heterogeneity and play multifaceted roles in tumor 
progression, ranging from remodeling the extracellular matrix to modulating 
immune responses. Recent breakthroughs in single-cell sequencing and spatial 
omics have unraveled the diverse functional states and spatial organization of 
various cell types within the TME, including distinct subtypes of CAFs which 
differ vastly in their influence on pancreatic cancer pathophysiology. This 
review delves into the intricate interactions between CAFs and pancreatic cancer 
cells, highlighting how metabolic reprogramming and immune regulation by CAFs 
contribute to the high malignancy of PDAC. By integrating single-cell and 
spatial resolution data, we offer new insights into the metabolic crosstalk and 
immune landscape remodeling driven by CAFs, establishing a foundation for 
targeting these stromal interactions in therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND: Metachronous liver metastasis (MLM) after primary resection of 
colorectal cancer (CRC) substantially worsens patient prognosis. Vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a highly bioactive proangiogenic protein. 
However, few studies have used serum VEGF to predict CRC liver metastasis, 
particularly MLM. This study investigated the predictive value of preoperative 
serum VEGF levels for the development of MLM in patients with CRC and developed 
a novel nomogram.
METHODS: Data from 229 patients with CRC who underwent radical resection of the 
primary tumor at the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University between June 
2019 and June 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into 
training (n = 153) and validation (n = 76) cohorts. Independent risk factors for 
MLM were identified in the training cohort and were used to develop and validate 
the nomogram.
RESULTS: Preoperative VEGF levels > 436.81 pg/mL, preoperative carcinoembryonic 
antigen levels > 5.0 ng/mL, T stage, N stage, and mismatch repair proficiency 
were independent risk factors for MLM and were used to develop the nomogram. The 
concordance index of the training cohort was 0.849 (95% confidence interval: 
0.765–0.933). Calibration curve analysis revealed that the standard curve fit 
well with the predicted curve. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis 
demonstrated the nomogram’s high efficiency. Decision curve analysis confirmed 
the nomogram’s significant clinical value.
CONCLUSION: We developed a novel nomogram including VEGF and mismatch repair 
proficiency in this study which were rarely reported in previous studies and the 
novel nomogram exhibits good discriminative ability and high accuracy in 
predicting MLM in patients with CRC. The identification of patients at a high 
risk of MLM would enable closer monitoring and timely interventions.

BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated that interleukin-33 (IL33) plays a key 
role in treatment resistance through tumor polyploidization and the consequent 
immune dysfunction by recruiting and expanding various immunosuppressive cells 
that express its receptor ST2, and that anti-IL33 blockade therapy induces 
potent anti-tumor effect in mouse tumor models resistant to anti-PD1 therapy. 
These suggest that IL33 and ST2 are potentially promising targets that could 
contribute to anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy. Recently, an increasing number of clinical 
studies have shown a significant correlation between IL33 expression in tumor 
tissues and poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer (GC). However, the 
clinical significance of targeting the IL33-ST2 axis in anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy 
for GC remains unclear.
METHODS: Tumor tissues and peripheral blood were collected from patients with 
advanced GC before and after nivolumab monotherapy in the WJOG10417GTR study. 
Gene expression of il33 in tumor tissues, IL33 in plasma, and ST2+ cell subsets 
in four cell populations (IL17RB+GATA3+ ILC2s, CD117+FceRIa+ mast cells, 
CD11b+HLA-DR-PDL1+ MDSCs, and CD3+CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs) in peripheral blood cells 
were analyzed by RNA-sequencing, IHC, ELISA, or flow cytometry, and the 
relationship between their levels and patient prognosis was statistically 
analyzed.
RESULTS: The levels of tumor il33 gene expression and peripheral IL33 and ST2+ 
cells were higher in patients who showed progressive disease (PD) than in non-PD 
patients. High levels of tumor il33 gene expression at post-treatment, and high 
levels of peripheral ST2+ cells at both pre- and post-treatment were 
significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival and overall 
survival. Patients with low post-treatment levels of both tumor il33 and 
peripheral ST2+ cells, especially the mast cell subset, had long-term survival 
without PD, indicating durable responders.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest high IL33/ST2 levels are significant poor 
prognostic factors for nivolumab therapy for advanced GC. The IL33/ST2 axis may 
be useful as a biomarker for predicting and pre-selecting possible 
responders/nonresponders to anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy for GC, and hopefully as a 
druggable target for developing new drugs for treating GC. The 
IL33/ST2-targeting strategy will contribute to improving clinical outcomes in 
the treatment of GC.

BACKGROUND: Chamomile essential oil (CEO) can be beneficial in cancer therapy. 
The aim of the current research is to explore the underlying mechanism of CEO 
for breast cancer treatment by network pharmacology approach and evaluate its 
anti-breast cancer capacity in vitro.
METHODS: We extracted CEO from chamomile flowers and analyzed its chemical 
components by using GC-MS/MS. Network pharmacology method was employed to screen 
the active components, potential targets and possible mechanism of CEO for 
breast cancer treatment. The molecular docking was used to validate the results 
of network pharmacology. Cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle assay were 
used to assess anti-breast cancer effect of CEO.
RESULTS: In network pharmacology analysis, we found the 12 effective components 
and 265 drug-disease common targets of CEO and among them, five active 
components and 19 targets were determined as the therapeutic targets of breast 
cancer. GO results demonstrated that the potential targets of CEO were primarily 
participated in positive regulation of MAPK cascade, distributed in membrane 
raft and the molecular functions were associated with protein 
serine-threonine-tyrosine kinase activity. KEGG pathway analysis suggested that 
the potential targets mainly involved in several signaling pathways such as 
PI3K-AKT, cAMP, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, MAPK and calcium 
signaling pathway. Molecular docking analysis revealed that LYN, LCK, VGFR, 
MAPK11, MAPK14, PTK2, JAK1, NR3C1 and ESR1 have shown higher affinity with three 
components from CEO and suggesting that these compounds might be the most 
effective ingredients against breast cancer. Besides, we found that CEO 
treatment suppressed cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest in breast 
cancer cell lines.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggest that CEO inhibit proliferation of breast 
cancer cell lines through modulating those multi-pathways and multi-targets. The 
present study not only indicate the therapeutic potential of CEO for breast 
cancer, but also provide valuable insight into its underlying mechanism.

PURPOSE: Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is a key node in tumor growth, 
metabolism, and invasion and is upregulated across multiple cancers. However, 
the molecular mechanisms by which LDHA influences breast cancer (BC) remain 
unclear. We analyzed public datasets and an institutional cohort to clarify the 
relationship between LDHA and BC, with the aim of informing future therapeutic 
strategies.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we assessed LDHA 
expression in BC and examined its associations with tumor mutational burden 
(TMB), immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint molecules, and drug 
sensitivity. We integrated multiple databases and used Kaplan-Meier analyses to 
evaluate prognostic value. To explore biological functions of LDHA, we performed 
Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Gene Set 
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). We then analyzed BC patients receiving neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy (NAC) at Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital to test the 
relationship between serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and pathological complete 
response (pCR). Finally, we used National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES) data to examine the association between serum LDH and mortality.
RESULTS: LDHA was upregulated in BC tissues, and higher expression was 
significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS), recurrence-free 
survival (RFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Functional analyses 
indicated enrichment of metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis. LDHA expression 
correlated with multiple immune cell populations, suggesting involvement in the 
tumor immune microenvironment. Lower LDHA expression was associated with greater 
sensitivity to several chemotherapeutic agents. In our institutional cohort, 
patients with lower serum LDH were more likely to achieve pCR, and LDH was an 
independent predictor of pCR. In NHANES, elevated serum LDH was linked to 
increased mortality risk.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that LDHA expression and serum LDH levels are 
promising prognostic biomarkers for survival and may predict chemotherapy 
response in BC patients. These results highlight the clinical relevance of 
LDHA-mediated metabolic pathways. However, as a correlational study, our 
findings warrant further validation through functional experiments to confirm 
LDHA's role as a potential therapeutic target.

BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a critical role in the 
tumor microenvironment (TME) of breast cancer (BC), influencing immune evasion 
and treatment resistance. This study aims to explore the heterogeneity of CAFs 
and their impact on prognosis and radiotherapy resistance.
METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to analyze CAF subsets in BC. Three 
major CAF subpopulations were identified, including inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) 
and matrix-modulating CAFs (mmCAFs), which were enriched in Scissor⁺ cells 
associated with prognosis. A CAF-derived gene signature was constructed to 
stratify BC patients into transcriptome clusters with varying TME compositions. 
Survival analysis and multivariate regression were employed to assess the 
prognostic value of the gene signature and predict radiotherapy resistance. 
Validation was conducted using METABRIC and GEO cohorts.
RESULTS: The iCAF and mmCAF subsets exhibited high stemness potential and 
facilitated immune rejection through interactions with epithelial and immune 
cells. The CAF gene signature identified high-risk clusters with increased 
stromal infiltration, suppressed CD8⁺ T-cell responses, and activation of 
immune-suppressive pathways, including VEGF. These high-risk clusters were 
significantly associated with radiotherapy resistance. A five-gene CAF risk 
model was developed, which robustly predicted radiotherapy resistance and poor 
prognosis in multiple cohorts. Validation confirmed the expression of risk 
genes, such as ENO1, which correlates with poor survival, TP53 mutation, and 
resistance to radiotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: CAFs play a pivotal role in TME remodeling, immune evasion, and 
treatment resistance in BC. The CAF-derived gene signature offers a clinically 
applicable tool for risk stratification, predicting prognosis and radiotherapy 
resistance. Targeting CAFs may provide new therapeutic opportunities for 
improving breast cancer treatment outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy has achieved 
remarkable success in esophagus cancer. However, identifying the patients who 
may benefit from the neoadjuvant treatment remains a great challenge. The aim of 
this study was to investigate peripheral blood biomarkers and explore their 
underlying mechanism.
METHODS: Baseline blood samples were collected and analyzed from esophagus 
cancer patients (discovery cohort n = 46, validation cohort n = 28) treated with 
neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade combined with chemotherapy. To explore the underlying 
mechanism of the identified biomarker, pre- and post-treatment transcriptome 
sequencing and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry data were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 55 features, including complete blood count and serum 
proteins were quantified from blood samples. In the discovery cohort, CD80-high 
patients were found to be associated with a higher response rate (AUC = 0.686). 
The predictive value of serum CD80 in evaluating treatment efficacy was further 
confirmed in the validation cohort (AUC = 0.778). Moreover, we found that 
patients with CD80-high were associated with higher CD8 T cells and lower 
neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment. During neoadjuvant treatment, iTreg 
infiltration and PD-L1 expression levels were significantly increased, while the 
MHC class I signature score was significantly decreased in patients with 
CD80-low.
CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral blood circulating soluble CD80 protein may serve as a 
potential non-invasive biomarker to predict clinical benefit for esophagus 
cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade combined with 
chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND: The influence of thyroid dysfunction on the clinical outcomes of 
head and neck cancer (HNC) patients remains an area of ongoing investigation, 
with previous studies yielding variable results. Treatments for HNC, 
particularly radiotherapy, frequently impact thyroid function. This 
meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the available evidence on the association 
between thyroid status (dysfunction vs. euthyroid) and survival outcomes in HNC 
patients.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
guidelines. Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase and Scopus were 
searched (January 2000-October 2024) for studies comparing survival outcomes 
(primarily Overall Survival) in adult HNC patients with thyroid dysfunction 
versus euthyroid patients. Two reviewers independently selected studies and 
extracted relevant data. The risk of bias for included studies was assessed 
using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies and the Cochrane Risk 
of Bias 2 (RoB2) tool for randomized controlled trials. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing survival were pooled using both 
fixed-effect (common-effect) and random-effects (REML) models. Heterogeneity 
across studies was assessed using the I² statistic and Cochran's Q test. 
Statistical analyses were performed using R with the meta package.
RESULTS: Six studies met the inclusion criteria for systematic review. Four of 
these studies, encompassing 671 participants, reported sufficient data (Hazard 
Ratios for Overall Survival) for meta-analysis. The fixed-effect model yielded a 
pooled HR of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.00; p = 0.0013). However, significant 
heterogeneity was observed (I² = 81.5%, p = 0.0010). Consequently, the 
random-effects model, deemed more appropriate, yielded a pooled HR of 1.45 (95% 
CI: 0.66, 3.19; p = 0.3601), indicating no statistically significant association 
between thyroid status and overall survival in HNC patients. The estimated 
between-study variance (τ²) was 0.53.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis revealed substantial heterogeneity among studies 
investigating the impact of thyroid status on HNC survival. When accounting for 
this heterogeneity using a random-effects model, no significant association was 
found. The findings highlight the need for further research with larger sample 
sizes, standardized definitions of thyroid dysfunction, consistent reporting of 
adjusted effect estimates, and exploration of heterogeneity sources.

INTRODUCTION: Gastric cancer (GC) remains a formidable global health issue with 
limited therapeutic options. ShenXia KuanZhong Decoction (SXKZD), a classical 
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, is used to manage GC; however, its 
anti-tumor mechanisms remain poorly understood.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The anti-GC effects of SXKZD were investigated in a GC 
model using dose-weighted network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular 
dynamics (MD) simulations, and pharmacokinetic profiling. Its impacts on tumor 
metabolism, immunity, and gut microbiota were assessed. A gut 
microbiota-substrate-metabolite (GM-S-M) network was constructed, and key 
targets and pathways were analyzed using computational and experimental methods.
RESULTS: SXKZD treatment significantly alleviated tumor progression in GC 
models. Network analysis revealed upregulated TNF and IL6 expression in GC, 
which SXKZD reduced, alongside enrichment in IL-17 and TNF signaling pathways. 
Molecular docking and MD simulations confirmed stable binding of Ginsenoside Rh2 
and 3-Indolepropionic acid to TNF, with binding energies of -147.63 kJ/mol and 
- 98.63 kJ/mol, respectively. Pharmacokinetic profiling showed 3-Indolepropionic 
acid's high bioavailability, while GM-S-M analysis identified key microbial taxa 
(e.g., Lactobacillus plantarum, Akkermansia muciniphila) modulated by SXKZD, 
enhancing anti-tumor immunity and metabolism.To further confirm these 
computational predictions, in vitro CCK-8 assays revealed that GRh2 and IPA 
inhibited AGS cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values 
of 68.74 ± 1.27 µg/mL and 780.60 ± 24.40 µg/mL at 24 hours, respectively. 
Western blot analysis demonstrated that GRh2 more effectively suppressed TNFα 
expression, whereas CETSA showed that IPA provided superior thermal 
stabilization of TNFα.
CONCLUSIONS: SXKZD mitigates GC by modulating gut microbiota and inhibiting TNF 
signaling, offering a mechanistic basis for its therapeutic potential in GC 
management.

BACKGROUND: Childhood cancers pose a significant public health challenge in 
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) due to complex interlinked socioeconomic factors that 
contribute to delayed diagnoses, limited treatment options, and unacceptable 
survival rates. This systematic review aims to present insights into the 
barriers to receiving timely diagnosis and treatment of childhood cancers in 
SSA.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted for published full-text 
articles from January 2000 to June 2024 in SSA across three databases: PubMed, 
Google Scholar, and Web of Science. We used a qualitative synthesis approach to 
examine the barriers and reasons for delays in seeking, reaching, or receiving 
quality care.
RESULTS: We identified 12 studies, of which 10 focused on all types of childhood 
cancer, retinoblastoma, and leukemia. When exploring barriers contributing to 
delays, eight key themes emerged from the data. The first theme was health 
service barriers, which included: poor cancer care and health system delays; 
lack of diagnostic and therapeutic services; and lack of childhood cancer 
policy. The second theme was healthcare provider-related barriers, which 
included inadequate knowledge of diagnosis and characterization; service burden 
and lack of training in cancer screening and diagnosis. The third to eighth 
themes were limited understanding of childhood cancer among the population 
(theme 3), financial challenges/household poverty (theme 4), emotional and 
psychological challenges (theme 5), poor healthcare-seeking behavior (theme 6), 
stigma and discrimination (theme 7), and limited social support and cultural 
beliefs (theme 8).
CONCLUSIONS: Barriers that contributed to the delay in the timely diagnosis and 
treatment of childhood cancer were healthcare provider-related barriers, limited 
understanding of childhood cancer, financial challenges/household poverty, 
emotional and psychological challenges, poor healthcare-seeking behavior, stigma 
and discrimination, and limited social support and cultural beliefs. Therefore, 
targeted education campaigns, community outreach programs, and policy changes to 
mitigate these barriers and improve outcomes for children with cancer are 
important.

tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) in lower middle-income countries (LMICs) is scarce.
METHODS: A comprehensive assessment of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-directed 
TKIs and treatment sequences was done for 249 patients (145 male, 104 female) 
with advanced NSCLC at a referral cancer hospital in New Delhi, India. The 
primary endpoints were overall survival (OS); progression-free survival on 
1st-line (PFS1) therapy, 2nd-line (PFS2) therapy, and PFS1 + 2. Multivariable 
Cox proportional hazards and joint frailty modelling were used for progression 
events and OS, respectively.
RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 48 months, median OS, PFS1, and PFS1 + 2 
were 46.6 (95% CI 36.9-67.0), 18.2 (95% CI 14.5-26.8), and 33.1 months (95% CI 
28.6-41.6), respectively. Third-generation TKIs significantly improved PFS and 
OS over 1st-generation TKIs, whether used 1st-line or later (HR PFS1 0.08, 
95% CI 0.02-0.32, p < 0.001; HR OS 0.13, 95% CI 0.02-0.94, p = 0.043; HR PFS2 
0.36, 95% CI 0.19-0.71, p = 0.003). Joint frailty modelling confirmed the 
correlation between repeated progression events and mortality (shared frailty 
parameter theta = 1.78, p < 0.001). Alectinib (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33-0.84, 
p = 0.007) and lorlatinib (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.31-0.77, p = 0.002) reduced 
progression risk. Temporal trend analyses showed fewer treatment lines and 
significantly improved outcomes in patients with brain metastases with 
3rd-generation TKIs.
CONCLUSIONS: This relatively large LMIC real-world study shows similar outcomes 
to Western data, and improved survival and lower risk of intracranial 
progression with 2nd- and 3rd-generation ALK-directed TKIs.

BACKGROUND: Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA), a form of circular DNA located outside 
chromosomes, is a common driver of oncogene amplification. Recent pan-cancer 
studies have associated ecDNA with cancer progression and poor prognosis. 
Moreover, its relationship with specific genomic features is becoming 
increasingly evident. However, the clinicopathological characteristics and 
underlying genomic mechanisms of ecDNA in gastric cancer remain poorly 
understood.
METHODS: We analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 81 Japanese gastric 
cancer samples to identify ecDNA using AmpliconArchitect and AmpliconClassifier. 
Gene expression profiles were obtained through whole-transcriptome RNA 
sequencing (RNA-seq).
RESULTS: We found that the frequency of ecDNA occurrence was comparable across 
cancer stages and had a modest impact on prognosis, suggesting that ecDNA is 
present in early-stage disease and has a limited role in gastric cancer 
progression. Several immunomodulatory genes were amplified on ecDNA, and the 
presence of ecDNA harboring these genes was associated with the suppression of 
cytotoxic T cell responses, indicating a functional link between ecDNA and 
immune evasion. ecDNA-positive cases more frequently harbored TP53 mutations and 
were microsatellite stable compared to ecDNA-negative cases. Finally, 
ecDNA-positive tumors exhibited a high prevalence of single-base substitution 
signature 17, implicating that oxidative stress, potentially induced by gastric 
acid, plays a role in the generation of ecDNA in gastric cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide insights into the clinicogenomic features of 
ecDNA in gastric cancer and highlight its potential impact on disease 
progression and immune modulation.

Despite an overall decline in cancer incidence and mortality in the USA, cancer 
health disparities are on the rise, and the demographic profile of the 
healthcare workforce remains unreflective of the population at large. One way to 
reduce such disparities is to increase diversity in the cancer and healthcare 
workforce. The Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative (ChicagoCHEC), through 
its summer research fellows program, embodies this goal by intentionally 
recruiting, retaining, and advancing a pipeline of diverse students in cancer 
research careers. During summers 2016 to 2024, nine cohorts, for a total of 178 
undergraduate and post-baccalaureate students at Northeastern Illinois 
University, University of Illinois Chicago, Northwestern University, and Chicago 
community colleges, enrolled in an 8-week didactic and mixed curricular program 
focused on the development of academic, technical, and professional skills in 
preparation for careers in social, behavioral, and biomedical research in 
healthcare. We describe the recruitment and selection processes of the summer 
cohorts and provide an overview of the program activities and overall structure. 
We report on the resulting changes in students' performance, academic and 
professional abilities, cancer and equity awareness, interests, and confidence 
in careers related to cancer and health disparities research. We also report on 
the educational transitions and career outcomes of the ChicagoCHEC fellows from 
the program's inception in 2016 to the most recent cohort in 2024. The 
evaluation of the program and the lessons learned during the pandemic serve as a 
model for future replication and implementation at other institutions.

BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer (EC) is the sixth most common female cancer and 
may rank fourth in cancer mortality by 2040. TP53 mutations and aberrant p53 
expression are associated to aggressive tumor subtypes and poor prognosis, 
reducing overall survival (OS), disease-free survival, recurrence rates (RcR) 
and Mortality Risk (MR). The prognostic impact of TP53 mutations in EC remains 
unclear.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane 
Library. Hazard ratios (HR) and Risk Ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) were combined using random-effects models. Analyses were conducted in 
RStudio (v4.4.1), and heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 statistic, with 
p < 0.05 considered significant.
RESULTS: Twenty-four studies comprising 5462 EC patients were included. TP53 
mutations and aberrant p53 expression were associated with poorer outcomes. For 
OS, TP53 mutations had an HR of 2.27 (95% CI 1.47-3.49) and aberrant p53 had an 
HR of 5.01 (95% CI 2.44-10.30). For DFS, TP53 mutations had an HR of 4.20 (95% 
CI 1.79-9.86), while aberrant p53 had an HR of 2.17 (95% CI 1.27-3.72). TP53 
mutations also increased RcR (RR: 2.88; 95% CI 2.18-3.80) and MR (RR: 2.33; 95% 
CI 1.11-4.88). Aberrant p53 showed a non-significant trend for recurrence (RR: 
3.54; 95% CI 0.95-13.10).
CONCLUSIONS: TP53 mutations and abnormal p53 expression in EC patients predict a 
poorer prognosis, characterized by increased RcR and MR, as well as lower DFS 
and OS.

PURPOSE: Colorectal carcinoma constitutes a predominant etiology of oncological 
mortality globally. This systematic review and meta-analysis elucidated the 
prognostic utility of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a predictive biomarker 
for postsurgical recurrence in colorectal cancer patients.
METHODS: Two independent investigators conducted systematic literature search 
across PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and clinical trial registries. 
Studies investigating ctDNA prognostic significance for colorectal cancer 
recurrence were incorporated. Random-effects models were implemented utilizing 
restricted maximum likelihood methodology. The study quality was assessed using 
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
RESULTS: Following screening of 2259 records, 11 studies were incorporated. 
ctDNA-positive patients exhibited significantly elevated recurrence risk as 
compared to ctDNA-negative counterparts (pooled HR: 2.34; 95% CI: 1.90-2.79; 
p < 0.001). Moderate heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 66.40%), attributable to 
patient stage distribution, sampling timing, detection platforms, and mutational 
panel variations. Stage I-III patients demonstrated exceptional consistency (HR: 
2.04, I2 = 0.00%). Detection platforms showed robust performance: droplet 
digital PCR (HR: 3.63), next-generation sequencing (HR: 2.67), and Safe-SeqS 
(HR: 2.16), with no significant differences (p = 0.10). Adjuvant chemotherapy 
analysis revealed differential performance: treated patients (HR: 2.50; 95% CI: 
2.08-2.93) versus untreated (HR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.07-2.34; p = 0.04). Extended 
analysis confirmed prognostic utility for overall survival (HR: 2.24) and 
surveillance recurrence-free survival (HR: 3.54).
CONCLUSIONS: ctDNA represents a robust prognostic biomarker for postsurgical 
colorectal cancer recurrence with consistent cross-platform performance. 
Enhanced prognostic value in adjuvant chemotherapy patients supports 
personalized surveillance implementation, though methodological standardization 
remains warranted.

BACKGROUND: Socioeconomically vulnerable patients experience significant breast 
cancer care treatment disparities. Our aim was to examine how multidisciplinary 
breast cancer clinic (MBCC) implementation affected time to treatment at a 
safety net hospital.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of female patients (≥18 years) 
with new breast cancer diagnoses from January 2019-September 2022. Time to 
treatment from biopsy-confirmed diagnosis was compared between patients seen in 
MBCC and those in a traditional discipline-based serial episodic clinic model.
RESULTS: Among 734 patients (mean age 58.5 years), 45.8% identified as Black and 
48.4% were insured by Medicaid. MBCC patients (28.9%) were younger (55.7 vs. 
59.6 years, P<0.001), less likely to be Hispanic (18.4% vs. 27.6%, P=0.01), more 
likely to have invasive cancer (86.8% vs. 60.3%, P<0.001), had shorter time to 
treatment (35.0 vs. 46.9 days, P<0.001), and were more likely to receive 
chemotherapy first (48.6% vs. 11.5%, P<0.001) compared to non-MBCC patients. In 
patients who received chemotherapy first, MBCC was associated with reduced time 
to initial appointment (10.2 vs. 18.1 days, P=0.011) and treatment initiation 
(27.1 vs. 42.6 days, P<0.001). Multivariable analysis showed invasive histology 
was associated with MBCC participation (OR 4.29, P<0.0001), while Hispanic 
ethnicity (OR 0.55, P=0.014) and older age (OR 0.98, P=0.021) were less 
associated with MBCC.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a MBCC in a safety net hospital improved time to 
initial breast cancer treatment for vulnerable patients. Moving forward, MBCC 
can serve as a model to reduce disparities in vulnerable patient populations.

BACKGROUND: Radiographically occult peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) is a major 
concern in gastric cancer; hence staging laparoscopy (SL) is recommended prior 
to initiating treatment, particularly neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST). 
However, compliance may vary and could result in understaging. We sought to 
evaluate the utilization of SL in patients with gastric cancer referred to 
academic institutions.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a multi-institution retrospective study of 
patients with a diagnosis of gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) Siewert 3 
adenocarcinoma who received treatment between 2010 and 2022. Demographics, tumor 
characteristics, treatment, and recurrence data were collected. Descriptive 
statistics and multivariate analysis were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 280 patients with gastric/GEJ cancer were identified, of 
which 75 (26.8%) had clinical stage IV disease and were excluded. Of the 
remaining 205 patients, 74 (36.1%) underwent upfront surgery and 131 (63.1%) 
underwent NST. Only 39 (29.8%) patients in the NST group underwent SL, of whom 
15(38.4%) were found to have peritoneal metastases; 12 (80%) had gross PC and 3 
(20%) had positive cytology. Among patients who underwent surgical resection 
after NST (n = 77), 26 (33.7%) experienced disease recurrence with a median time 
to recurrence of 11.6 months. The peritoneum (n = 10/26, 38.5%) was the most 
common site of recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Compliance with SL prior to NST is poor (29.8%), and in the group 
that underwent SL, 38% of patients were upstaged due to presence of peritoneal 
metastases. These findings are significant, as the management and prognosis of 
peritoneal metastases are drastically different. Various factors could lead to 
poor compliance with SL, hence better compliance and alternate approaches to 
reliably detect PC are needed.

Cervical cancer, the fourth most prevalent malignancy among women globally, is 
predominantly caused by persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus 
(HPV). Traditional methods such as surgery and chemotherapy are often associated 
with high incidence of adverse effects and may impact future pregnancies and 
childbirth especially for young female patient. Given that high-risk HPV 
primarily targets epithelial cells and cervical lesions are mainly localized in 
the cervix, local administration in the cervicovaginal area emerges as one of 
the most direct and effective methods for treating cervical cancer and its 
precursors. Topical vaginal administration not only minimizes systemic drug 
exposure but also simplifies application, reduces treatment costs, and supports 
fertility preservation. Nevertheless, there are currently no official 
recommendations for local therapies targeting HPV eradication or tumor lesion 
treatment. This review focuses on clinical trials and preclinical studies 
related to local pharmacotherapy for cervical tumors, with an emphasis on 
evaluating the efficacy of local treatments aimed at preventing the progression 
of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. It encompasses therapeutic agents, 
clinical efficacy and adverse effects, treatment strategies, and innovations in 
formulations while also addressing the inherent challenges of vaginal 
administration and predicting future trends in this therapeutic field. Clinical 
studies have shown that trichloroacetic acid offers the best patient compliance 
and therapeutic response, although concerns remain regarding its uncontrolled 
depth of tissue penetration. In parallel, formulation optimization strategies 
such as prolonging vaginal residence time and employing nanotechnology to 
enhance drug loading and targeted delivery have shown promise in improving 
therapeutic outcomes.

PURPOSE: As the concept of time toxicity has gained traction in the oncology 
community, work has largely focused on mapping and measuring time burdens. This 
qualitative study sought to elicit perspectives from people with lived or 
professional experience with cancer care on strategies to decrease the time 
burden of oncology care.
METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 47 participants (16 
patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer, 15 of informal care partners, 
and 16 oncology clinicians with diverse roles) from a single academic cancer 
center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Interviews were conducted between February 
2023 and October 2023 and transcribed and analyzed using a hybrid approach.
RESULTS: Five key themes emerged as solutions to address time toxicity: (1) 
tailored ambulatory scheduling based on patient and care partner needs; (2) 
improved administrative and logistical support; (3) home-based care when safe, 
feasible, and preferred; (4) transparent and empathetic communication of time 
demands, and (5) innovative care models and delivery. Participants emphasized 
that the threshold between helpful and burdensome care in the context of a 
cancer diagnosis differs for each person, requiring individualized solutions.
CONCLUSION: Findings from this study will aid the oncology community in 
considering and designing interventions to decrease the time burdens of cancer 
care on patients and their care partners. Implementing changes to meet the need 
for individualized, person-centered interventions, focusing on individuals' 
preferences and unique circumstances, will require health system will and 
motivation .

BACKGROUND: Tissue architecture of cancer deviates from that of normal tissue 
and is closely linked to various features of cancer, including invasion and 
tumor immunity. However, pan-cancer analyses of cancer tissue architecture (CTA) 
remain limited.
METHODS: We applied non-negative matrix factorization to the expression data of 
593 CTA-related genes from 28 cancer types in the Cancer Genome Atlas Project 
dataset, identifying seven distinct CTA signatures.
RESULTS: A fibrous collagen-related signature, which is related to fibroblasts 
and the extracellular matrix, was relatively ubiquitous and represents a 
universal feature of cancer. In contrast, those associated with cell-cell 
adhesion or cell-stroma adhesion exhibited high tissue specificity. These 
findings were validated using Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes data, spatial 
transcriptomics, and in vivo and in vitro models. In renal cell carcinoma, we 
found a strong correlation between network-forming collagen and patient 
survival, supported by mouse experiments showing that perturbation of this 
collagen promotes tumor growth. Additionally, several gene mutations and copy 
number alterations were found to correlate with changes in CTA.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that CTA can be understood as a combination of 
components that influence the pathological features of cancer.

Therapeutic vaccines for cancer have been pursued for decades but historically 
have a low rate of clinical efficacy. However, recent advances in vaccine 
technologies alongside new vaccination regimens and clinical trial designs are 
showing promise in early-stage trials, demonstrating substantial benefits in 
recurrence-free and overall survival in cancer patients. Nanotechnologies are 
playing an important role in these advances through the introduction of lipid 
nanoparticles and lipoplexes that can effectively deliver mRNA vaccines, 
improved adjuvants, and the development of technologies that efficiently target 
peptide vaccines to secondary lymphoid tissues. Here we review these advances in 
the context of parallel progress in cancer antigen discovery, nucleic acid 
vaccine engineering and clinical trial designs that may enable therapeutic 
vaccines to effectively enhance patient survival. We also discuss outstanding 
challenges still to be solved to maximize the efficacy of cancer vaccines.

Accurate assessment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status is 
crucial for effective breast cancer treatment planning and improved patient 
outcomes. Traditional needle biopsies, limited in tissue sampling, often lead to 
inaccurate assessments due to intratumoural heterogeneity. Here, to address 
this, we introduce the deep-learning-based HER2 multimodal alignment and 
prediction (MAP) model, which leverages pretreatment multimodal breast cancer 
images for a more comprehensive reflection of tumour characteristics and 
provides more accurate HER2 status prediction. We develop patient response MAP 
models to demonstrate the HER2 prediction performance of our model compared with 
needle biopsies from patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy. A large-scale 
multimodal breast cancer dataset from 4 centres, consisting of 14,472 images 
from 6,991 cases, is adopted in this study, and the results consistently 
demonstrate the superiority of our HER2 MAP model in predicting patient 
response. These findings highlight the substantial advantages of our HER2 
predictions. Our study provides physicians with a crucial tool for informed 
clinical decisions and treatment plans, aiming to improve outcomes in patients 
with breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Male breast cancer (BC) is a rare entity and represents a 
significant clinical challenge due to its late diagnosis and resulting poorer 
prognosis compared to female BC. As shown by prior studies, approximately 99% of 
male BC patients are hormone receptor-positive (HR +). This study aimed to 
evaluate the utilization and impact of adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) in male 
early BC patients using a large German real-world claims dataset.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were collected from a major German statutory health 
insurance provider (AOK Baden-Wuerttemberg) covering the period between January 
1, 2010, and December 31, 2020. Male patients diagnosed with early BC who 
underwent breast surgery were included. ET use was determined by prescription 
records. The impact of ET on overall survival (OS) was assessed using 
univariable (log-rank) and multivariable (cox regression) analysis.
RESULTS: Among 128 male early BC patients, 16% (n = 21) did not utilize adjuvant 
ET. On univariable analysis, ET was significantly associated with 5-year OS (74% 
with ET vs. 37% without ET; p < 0.0001). Multivariable analysis revealed ET use 
(Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.31, 95% CI 0.14-0.69, p = 0.004) having a positive effect 
on OS, whereas age (HR: 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.09) and comorbidities (HR: 1.18, 95% 
CI 1.05-1.34, p = 0.007) were identified as negative predictive factors for OS.
CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of male patients with early BC does not use 
ET. However, the use of ET plays a key role in improving survival outcomes for 
male patients with early BC. Efforts to improve the use of ET, including patient 
education and management of side effects, are essential to optimize treatment 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The 4K Score is a blood-based test that estimates the risk of 
clinically significant prostate cancer (Grade Group ≥2, GG2 + ) by combining 
four kallikrein markers with clinical variables. However, benign prostatic 
hyperplasia (BPH) can elevate PSA levels, potentially leading to risk 
overestimation in men with large prostates. We developed a novel metric, 4K 
Density (4K Score divided by prostate volume), to adjust for prostate size and 
improve risk stratification.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 3150 men who underwent 4K Score testing at 
the University of Miami Desai Sethi Urology Institute from 2014 to 2024. After 
excluding those without a prostate biopsy or MRI within six months of the 4K 
Score, 1983 men remained. Statistical analysis using SAS v9.4 included logistic 
regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and Youden's Index 
to determine optimal cutoffs for GG2+ detection. The performance of 4K Density 
was compared to the 4Kscore and PSA Density in predicting GG2+ cancer.
RESULTS: Among the 1983 men, 661 (33%) had GG2+ cancer. 4K Density was 
significantly higher in men with GG2+ cancer compared to those without (median 
0.93 vs. 0.25, p < .0001). In multivariable analysis, 4K Density was the 
strongest independent predictor (OR 3.51, 95% CI 3.64-4.66), outperforming 
4Kscore and PSA density. 4K Density also had the highest AUC (0.81, (95%CI)), 
compared to 4Kscore (0.76, 95 %CI, <0.0001) and PSA density (0.76, 95% CI, 
<0.0001). At an optimized cutoff of 0.56, 4K Density achieved 89.9% NPV and 
48.5% PPV for detecting GG2+ cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: 4K Density is a novel, volume-adjusted biomarker that improves 
detection of clinically significant prostate cancer and outperforms PSA density 
and the 4Kscore test. It may be helpful in larger prostates, where confounding 
from BPH is present. Prospective validation is warranted to confirm its clinical 
utility.

Metabolic reprogramming is one of the hallmark events in colorectal cancer. 
Tumor cells adapt to microenvironmental changes by regulating energy and 
biomaterial metabolism. This study identifys abnormal lipid accumulation and 
significant downregulation of fatty acid metabolism in colorectal cancer. The 
core gene of this pathway, CPT2, critically impacts colorectal cancer patient 
survival and regulates tumor cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. 
Metabolite analysis demonstrates that CPT2 knockdown induced accumulation of 
glycerophospholipids, primarily phosphatidylcholine and 
phosphatidylethanolamine, driven by enhanced long-chain fatty acid-dependent 
glycerophospholipid biosynthesis mediated by GPAT4. Transcriptomic analysis and 
subsequent experiments reveal that glycerophospholipid accumulation, as key 
components of vesicles and autophagosomes, promoted autophagosome maturation and 
elongation, thereby activating selective autophagy (lipophagy) in colorectal 
cancer cells and accelerating tumor progression. These findings enhance 
understanding of tumor metabolic characteristics and identify novel diagnostic 
and therapeutic targets for colorectal cancer.

Diagnosis of stage 1 breast cancer is challenging as small tumors are often left 
undetected by conventional imaging techniques. In addition, ~80% of detected 
breast masses are classified as benign, which means that a large proportion of 
diagnostic needle biopsies lead to unnecessary psychological stress and medical 
costs. We investigated circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) as potential 
carriers of unique cancer-associated proteins capable of reporting on a breast 
cancer diagnosis. We isolated EVs from healthy (19), benign (19), and stage 1 
breast cancer patient (86) plasma samples using size exclusion chromatography. 
Mass spectrometry identified 94 significantly changed proteins in the plasma EVs 
from breast cancer patients. Analysis of a subset of these proteins using a 
cohort of pre- and post-operative breast cancer patient plasma EVs identified 
enolase 1 as a promising biomarker. We further validated enolase 1 in a larger 
patient cohort by high-throughput ELISA of plasma. Enolase 1 was found to be 
significantly elevated in plasma from stage 1 breast cancer patients compared to 
healthy and benign individuals, and decreased in post-operative plasma upon 
tumor removal. Our findings suggest that an enolase 1 liquid blood biopsy could 
be used to support the detection of breast cancer at the earliest, most 
treatable, stage.

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC01354 is involved in the progression of some 
cancer types, but the expression profile and prognostic value of this lncRNA in 
most tumor types, as well as its role and mechanism in esophageal cancer (ESCA), 
remain poorly characterized. Here, we identify LINC01354 as a tumor-suppressive 
lncRNA that inhibits ESCA progression by disrupting cell division signaling. 
Clinically, a pan-cancer analysis revealed widespread downregulation of 
LINC01354 in tumors compared to normal specimens, including ESCA and breast 
cancer (BRCA). Low tumor LINC01354 expression correlated with poor overall 
survival (OS) in ESCA and BRCA patients. In addition, the low expression of 
LINC01354 in tumors was validated again by two ESCA cohorts, and LINC01354 
showed promising diagnostic potential. Moreover, tissue microarray (TMA) 
staining based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) once again confirmed 
the down-regulation of LINC01354 expression in ESCA. Functionally, enrichment 
analysis of LINC01354's co-expressed genes indicated its critical role in ESCA 
cell cycle regulation, and its tumor suppressive effect was verified by an in 
vivo tumor-bearing mouse model. The inhibition of OE-LINC01354 on ESCA 
cell-cycle progression was further demonstrated by flow cytometry. 
Mechanistically, high-depth proteomic profiling revealed that overexpression of 
LINC01354 alters key cell division regulators, including AURKA, AURKB, BRCA2, 
CCND1, CDC20, and SOX9, etc. Thus, these findings establish the LINC01354-cell 
division axis as a novel tumor-suppressive mechanism in ESCA and highlight its 
therapeutic potential.

The paradoxical impact of T-cell-derived circulating DNA (T-cirDNA) and 
prognostication in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been 
reported. Further exploration was conducted in 158 EGFR-mutated NSCLC 
participants who received EGFR inhibitors, correlated with tumor PD-L1 score, 
CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and bulk RNA sequencing. We 
categorized T-cirDNA levels into three groups based on a previous study: 
undetectable (26.8%), low (≤ 1% ratio; 36.6%), and high (> 1% ratio; 36.6%). 
Undetectable and high T-cirDNA groups were independent factors correlated with 
favorable outcomes. The presence of intra-tumoral CD8 TILs (≥ 1%) was also an 
independent unfavorable prognostic factor; however, it had the lowest proportion 
in the low T-cirDNA group (16%). Tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME)-related 
gene set enrichment analysis revealed an overlapped significant heme 
biosynthesis signature correlated with poor outcome and diverse T-cirDNA group. 
Despite a high heme biosynthesis signature score in the undetectable T-cirDNA 
group, inverse correlation with CIBERSORT-activated CD4 memory T-cells was found 
(R - 0.79, p-value 0.019). Those findings were contrary to the low and high 
T-cirDNA groups. The significant contribution of heme biosynthesis was the 
overexpression of CPOX. Crosstalk of EGFR and COPX function prohibits the 
activation of CD4 + memory T-cells or the spatial intra-tumoral CD8 + T-cells. 
Undetectable T-cirDNA represents inactivated naïve T-cells and solely active 
downstream EGFR signaling.

The aim of this study was to identify biomarkers associated with breast cancer 
prognosis and to explore the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Interferon 
alpha-inducible protein 6 (IFI6), known as a proliferative and anti-apoptotic 
factor, has been implicated in various malignant diseases. However, its 
biological roles in breast cancer remain poorly understood. To address this, we 
employed bioinformatics analyses to investigate the expression and prognostic 
significance of IFI6 in breast cancer. Our findings revealed that IFI6 was 
upregulated in breast cancer and was associated with histological subtypes and 
lymph node metastasis status. Kaplan-Meier plotter analysis demonstrated that 
high IFI6 expression correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients 
with ER-positive, PR-positive, HER2-positive, and lymph node-positive subtypes. 
To further enhance clinical applicability, we constructed a prognostic nomogram 
incorporating IFI6 expression and clinicopathological factors, which showed 
favorable predictive performance for overall survival. Additionally, IFI6 
expression showed significant correlations with infiltrating immune cells, 
including regulatory T cells (Tregs), M1 macrophages, naïve B cells, and plasma 
cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that IFI6 was predominantly 
expressed in epithelial tumor cells and was associated with altered immune cell 
composition, suggesting the potential role in shaping the immune 
microenvironment. Moreover, IFI6 expression was closely associated with several 
immunomodulators. In conclusion, IFI6 serves as a potential biomarker for immune 
infiltration and poor prognosis in breast cancer and may offer novel insights 
into risk stratification and immunotherapeutic strategies.

Due to cervical cancer poor prognosis, discovering prognostic biomarkers is 
urgently needed. Numerous publications indicated the presence of stable 
microRNAs (miRNAs) in human serum. This study aimed to identify a specific panel 
of serum miRNAs that could be used as reliable biomarkers for cervical cancer 
prognosis evaluation. The candidate miRNAs were measured using quantitative 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in serum and tissue samples from 
patients with either favorable (n = 62) or unfavorable (n = 65) prognosis. These 
miRNAs were correlated with clinical parameters and patients' survival. 
Functional assays assessed the role of candidate miRNAs in cervical cancer 
cells. Receiver operating characteristic curves assessed the candidate miRNAs 
prediction value for cervical cancer prognosis. Compared to the good prognosis 
group, plasma miR-378 and miR-20a were upregulated, and miR-520a-3p was 
downregulated in the poor prognosis group. miR-378 and miR-20a were identified 
as independent risk factors (P = 0.044 and 0.018), both of which promoted C33a 
cell proliferation, invasion, and migration while suppressing apoptosis. In 
contrast, miR-520a-3p acted as a protective factor for cervical cancer prognosis 
(P = 0.018), exhibiting opposing effects on malignant behaviors. The combination 
of the three miRNAs showed the best prognostic predictive potential for cervical 
cancer, with an area under curve of 0.907. The serum miRNA biomarker panel 
(miR-378, miR-20a, and miR-520a-3p) could be used as a non-invasive and accurate 
prognostic predictor of cervical cancer. This panel could be a promising tool in 
clinical therapeutic strategies to aid in the timely prediction and management 
of cervical cancer.

Gastric cancer (GC) is a common and life-threatening malignancy. It is often 
diagnosed at advanced stages. A major challenge in treatment is the development 
of radiotherapy resistance. This resistance significantly reduces the 
effectiveness of therapy. Therefore, our objective is to pinpoint genes linked 
to the resistance against radiotherapy in gastric cancer. The NR4A1 expression 
exhibited abnormalities in radioresistant gastric cancer cells, specifically 
MKN45-R and AGS-R cells, in comparison to their respective parental cells. 
Through high-throughput sequencing, we screened these cells and utilized 
quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis (qRT-PCR) 
to quantify NR4A1 expression. Functional analyses of NR4A1 in GC radioresistance 
were conducted by overexpressing NR4A1 in both MKN45-R and AGS-R cells, as well 
as their parental counterparts. Finally, the clinical relevance of NR4A1 in GC 
was confirmed through animal experiments. The expression of NR4A1 was 
significantly reduced in radioresistant cells, namely MKN45-R and AGS-R, as 
opposed to their parental counterparts. Overexpressing NR4A1 in MKN45-R and 
AGS-R cells resulted in heightened sensitivity to radiation. Additionally, NR4A1 
overexpression exerted inhibitory effects on the growth and metastasis of GC 
tissues in animal models following irradiation (IR). Our observations indicate 
that NR4A1 plays a crucial role in enhancing the radiation sensitivity of 
gastric cancer cells, underscoring the therapeutic potential of NR4A1 in GC 
treatment.

The metastasis and chemotherapy resistance of gastric cancer significantly 
contribute to treatment failure and mortality. Based on previous studies, we 
hypothesized that Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90) interacts with and upregulates 
Pseudouridine Synthase 7 (PUS7), which in turn promotes THUMP Domain Containing 
1 (THUMPD1) expression, driving gastric cancer progression and drug resistance. 
Differential gene expression analysis revealed that HSP90, PUS7, and THUMPD1 are 
overexpressed in multiple tumor types and positively correlate with tumor 
mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI). Mechanistically, 
HSP90 interacts with PUS7 to regulate THUMPD1 expression, enhancing tumor cell 
proliferation, migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, 
and cisplatin resistance. Functional inhibition of HSP90 and THUMPD1 suppressed 
these oncogenic processes, while PUS7 overexpression exacerbated them. These 
findings highlight the HSP90/PUS7/THUMPD1 axis as a critical regulator of 
gastric cancer progression and a potential therapeutic target.

Gastric cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality and highlights the 
need for early detection of gastric cancer and Helicobacter pylori (HP) 
infection, which is a major risk factor. Early non-invasive and convenient 
diagnostic tools capable of capturing the dynamic molecular alterations during 
carcinogenesis and HP infection is needed. In this study, we use Raman 
spectroscopy and machine learning algorithms to detect different gastric lesions 
and HP infection condition with gastric juice samples. 133 patients from Peking 
University Third Hospital were involved and categorized into groups based on 
histopathological diagnosis: early gastric cancer (EGC), dysplasia (DYS), 
intestinal metaplasia (IM), and chronic superficial gastritis (CSG), with 
further classification based on HP infection. The stacked machine learning model 
demonstrated high diagnostic performance, achieving 90% accuracy, 90% 
sensitivity, and 97% specificity in distinguishing pathological stages, along 
with 96% accuracy, 96% sensitivity, and 96% specificity in HP detection. The 
multilayer perceptron (MLP) model based on gastric juice Raman spectroscopy 
showed excellent discrimination capability, with an AUC of 0.98 for 
differentiating controls from patients with DYS and EGC. Additionally, Raman 
spectroscopy achieved an AUC of 0.95 in distinguishing control gastric mucosa 
from precancerous lesions (IM, DYS) and EGC. The approach offers a rapid, 
accurate, and minimally invasive diagnostic tool, demonstrating significant 
potential for clinical application in rapid and accurate detection of 
precancerous lesions, early gastric cancer, and HP infection.

Cisplatin (Cis) is the first-line chemotherapy for treating the non-small-cell 
lung cancer. However, its low solubility, low bioavailability, and potential 
side effects limit its use. To overcome these drawbacks, novel pH-sensitive 
liposomal Cis formulations have been developed using a rapid and practical 
ethanol injection technique. In this study, two different liposome types were 
prepared, one based on phosphatidylcholine and cholesteryl hemisuccinate 
(CHEMS), the other containing 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine 
(DOPE) in combination with CHEMS. Their homogeneity, smaller particle sizes 
(< 200 nm) and drug integration were confirmed using the DLS method and FT-IR 
and SEM-EDS, respectively. The loading efficiency was changed from 35 to 50% 
depending on the composition. In vitro drug release studies showed a minimum 
release at physiological pH (7.4) and a significantly increased release at 
acidic pH (5.5), in particularly for DOPE liposomes, indicating the higher 
pH-sensitivity. Cytotoxicity analyses performed in A549 lung cancer cell line 
showed that both liposomal formulations exhibited stronger antitumour effects 
compared to free Cis. This effect was supported by increased apoptotic activity 
confirmed by Annexin-V/PI staining method. These findings suggest that the 
pH-sensitive liposomes developed in this study offer a promising and scalable 
approach to enhance the selective delivery and therapeutic efficacy of Cis.

Through targeted next-generation sequencing of 83 non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) patients with first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) resistance, we detected 11% TET2 mutations in the 
T790M-negative subgroup. To explore the molecular mechanism of TET2 in EGFR TKI 
resistance, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) was adopted to 
analyze the global genomic methylation profiles and detect the differentially 
methylated genes in the TET2-knockdown (KD) PC9 and control PC9 cell lines, 
following bioinformatics analysis of gene ontology (GO) functions and kyoto 
encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) signaling to screen for genes 
associated with drug resistance. TET2 KD attenuated gefitinib-induced apoptosis 
and decreased the sensitivity of EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells to gefitinib. 
Forty-three drug resistance genes with hypermethylated promoter regions were 
identified via RRBS and bioinformatic analysis in PC9TET2 KD cells. Then, 10 
candidate genes were screened for further validation. RT‒PCR demonstrated that 
the expression of AXIN2 and CSK was significantly lower in PC9TET2 KD cells than 
in control cells. Furthermore, AXIN2 KD attenuated gefitinib-induced apoptosis 
and decreased the sensitivity of PC9 cells to gefitinib. Importantly, we found 
that the demethylation drug decitabine (DCA) could reverse gefitinib resistance 
in PC9TET2 KD cells and mouse models. These results indicate that the 
methylation of AXIN2 induced by TET2 repression is a novel resistance mechanism 
of EGFR TKIs in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Demethylation drugs have the potential to 
overcome EGFR TKI resistance induced by loss-of-function TET2 mutations.

CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells are the primary defenses against 
tumor cells. The tumor microenvironment impairs their antitumor capabilities, 
including the ability to infiltrate the tumor. Our laboratory has shown that 
tumors suppress T cells by inhibiting KCa3.1 K+ channel activity that controls 
cytokine release, cytotoxicity, and chemotaxis. However, little is known about 
the role of K+ channels in the anti-tumor activity of NK cells. Here, we 
investigated KCa3.1 channels' role in human NK cell function in head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Selective blockade of KCa3.1 using TRAM-34 
inhibited chemotaxis of NK cells from both healthy donors and patients with 
HNSCC, while KCa3.1pharmacological activation increased chemotaxis and 
cytotoxicity. SKA-31, a selective KCa3.1 activator, enhanced antitumor immune 
responses in a humanized HNSCC mouse model generated by implanting Cal27 cells 
and healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells into immunodeficient mice. 
SKA-31 treatment resulted in a 7-fold increase in total NK cells and a 23-fold 
increase in functionally active (granzyme B-positive) NK cells in these tumors. 
These data highlight the critical role of KCa3.1 channels in antitumor immunity 
and open the possibility of targeting KCa3.1 to develop new immunotherapies for 
HNSCC.

We present and discuss trends in cancer incidence from 1990 to 2023 and in 
cancer mortality from 1990 to 2022 in France. In the male population, cancer 
incidence is more or less stable in the recent years and decreases when one 
excludes prostate cancer. In the female population, cancer incidence is 
increasing, but is stable in recent years when one excludes lung cancer. Cancer 
mortality is decreasing both among men and women. The different cancer sites 
show different trends, which require simultaneous consideration of their 
incidence and mortality.

Lung cancer is a severe and life-threatening type of cancer that originates in 
the lung tissues. Computed Tomography (CT) image emerges as the primary 
diagnostic tool for identifying lung cancer. However, manual interpretation of 
CT images necessitates the development of automated techniques. Hence, this 
article proposes a hybrid model, Convolutional Shuffle Attention Xtreme Gradient 
Boost Network (SA-XGBNet) for detecting lung cancer through CT images. The 
SA-XGBNet is the integration of Shuffle Attention Network (SA-Net), 
Convolutional Xtreme Gradient Boost (ConvXGB) and Fractional Calculus (FC). 
Initially, CT input images are composed from a database and filtered by 
Kolmogorov-Wiener Filter. Next, the pre-processed images undergo segmentation, 
performed using a Dual Attention Network (DA-Net) to isolate the lung nodule 
region. The image augmentation models, such as shearing, color jittering, 
resizing, flipping, and rotating, are applied. Following that, different 
features, including shape-based, intensity-based, Histogram of Oriented Local 
Binary Pattern Descriptor (HOLBP) with entropy and texture-based features are 
extracted. Finally, lung cancer is detected by SA-XGBNet. At 90 % training data, 
SA-XGBNet acquired 92.975 % accuracy, 94.977 % True Positive Rate (TPR), and 
90.866 % True Negative Rate (TNR) using the Lung Image Database Consortium Image 
Collection and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI).

BACKGROUND: Pelvic exenteration (PE) is a major procedure typically performed 
for patients with locally advanced or recurrent pelvic malignancy. Appropriate 
patient selection is crucial to achieving good outcomes and obviating futile 
resections. The objective of this study was to establish the incidence and 
predictors of futile PE in patients with locally advanced or recurrent pelvic 
malignancy.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospective database of patients 
undergoing PE for advanced or recurrent pelvic malignancy between 2008 and 2025 
was performed. Patients with benign disease or less than 6 months' follow-up 
were excluded, except those who died or recurred within 6 months, who were 
classified as futile PE. Futility in planned R0 (curative) resections was 
defined as death from any cause or recurrence (local or distant) within 6 
months. Futility in planned R1/R2 (palliative) resections was defined as death 
from any cause within 6 months. Multivariable logistic regression was performed 
to identify predictors of futile PE.
RESULTS: Of 224 patients identified, 172 were eligible for inclusion in the 
study and 25 (14.5 %) patients had a futile resection criteria. Multivariable 
analysis demonstrated Systemic Inflammation Response Index (SIRI ≥1.92) (OR, 
7.06; 95 % CI, 1.58-31.57; P = 0.011) and cancer site (non-colorectal cancer) 
(OR, 4.68; 95 % CI, 1.81-12.10; P = 0.001) as independent risk factors for 
futile surgery.
CONCLUSION: Futile PE was observed in 14.5 % of patients. Key predictors of 
futility included non-colorectal cancers and elevated preoperative SIRI levels.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) thresholds (≥3 or 
4 ng/ml) are used to balance prostate cancer (PCa) detection against false 
positives; yet, aggressive PCa can occur at a low PSA and indolent tumors at a 
high PSA level. Long-term data clarifying aggressiveness across PSA thresholds 
are limited.
METHODS: The STHLM3 screening trial enrolled 59 088 men. All received PSA 
testing; those with PSA ≥1 ng/ml underwent the multianalyte Stockholm3 blood 
test. We analyzed men treated with radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy 
(n = 968). Outcomes were any biochemical recurrence (BCR), high-risk BCR, and 
PCa-specific mortality. Incidence across four baseline groups-(1) elevated PSA 
(≥3 ng/ml) and Stockholm3 (≥11), (2) elevated Stockholm3 alone (≥11), (3) 
elevated PSA alone (≥3 ng/ml), and (4) neither elevated PSA (<3 ng/ml) nor 
elevated Stockholm3 (<11)-was compared using Gray's test and competing-risk 
regression.
KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Follow-up was 8.9 yr. The 5-yr cumulative rates of 
any/high-risk BCR were as follows: 13%/9.0% for both elevated Stockholm3 (≥11) 
and elevated PSA (≥3 ng/ml), 9.4%/5.3% for elevated Stockholm3 alone, 1.5%/0% 
for elevated PSA alone, and 0%/0% for nonelevated results on both tests 
(p < 0.001). Compared with PSA-only elevation, Stockholm3-only elevation showed 
a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.8 (95% confidence interval 0.8-3.9; p = 0.2) for any 
BCR and an HR of 8.8 (1.06-72; p = 0.044) for high-risk BCR.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Some men with PSA <3 ng/ml harbor 
aggressive PCa with a substantial risk of recurrence after upfront curative 
treatment. Risk predictive blood tests, such as Stockholm3, used at lower PSA 
thresholds, can identify these men, while few clinically important cancers are 
missed when biopsy is deferred with PSA ≥3 ng/ml but low Stockholm3 scores.

BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive malignancy 
with limited therapeutic options. Opioids are commonly used for perioperative 
and chronic pain management in patients with cancer. Notably, the κ-opioid 
receptor (KOR) has shown antitumour potential, but its therapeutic impact in 
TNBC is unknown.
METHODS: We analysed KOR expression in TNBC patient cohorts and tissue 
microarrays. The effects of the KOR agonist U69593 were assessed on key 
malignant phenotypes in vitro, including apoptosis and mitochondrial integrity. 
We then validated its impact on tumour growth and metastasis using subcutaneous 
and haematogenous mouse models.
RESULTS: KOR expression was downregulated in TNBC tissue (n=60, P=0.0004), and 
higher KOR levels were associated with more favourable patient prognosis (n=45 
low vs 15 high, P=0.03). The KOR agonist U69593 suppressed TNBC progression both 
in vitro, by inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while 
inducing apoptosis, and in vivo, by suppressing tumour growth and metastasis. 
U69593 induced severe mitochondrial damage, evidenced by loss of mitochondrial 
membrane potential and depleted intracellular adenosine triphosphate. 
Metabolomic profiling revealed that this was linked to disruption of the urea 
cycle, leading to the accumulation of toxic ammonia. Restoring urea cycle 
function by overexpression of the key enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase rescued 
TNBC cells from U69593-induced apoptosis and abrogated its antitumour effects.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that the KOR agonist U69593 restrains 
TNBC progression by disrupting urea cycle function and compromising 
mitochondrial integrity, highlighting the potential of dual-action therapeutics 
that combine effective analgesia with direct antitumour activity.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is a gender imbalance regarding incidence and 
mortality in bladder cancer (BC), while gender-specific differences in 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL) following radical cystectomy (RC) remain 
unknown. We aimed to assess gender-specific differences in HRQOL after RC in a 
large prospective propensity score (PS)-matched cohort with follow-up of up to 
10 yr.
METHODS: A total of 1498 BC patients who underwent RC were included. PS matching 
of 794 patients (n = 397 female, n = 397 male) was conducted. HRQOL was assessed 
systematically by applying the European Organisation for Research and Treatment 
of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire QLQ)-C30, QLQ-BLM30, and 
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bladder questionnaires. Separate 
modelling of longitudinal HRQOL for females versus males was performed. 
Generalised estimating equations (GEEs) were employed to account for repeated 
measures. Spearman's rank correlation was applied to identify gender-specific 
factors influencing HRQOL.
KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Baseline general HRQOL did not differ between 
female and male patients (p = 0.162). GEE modelling revealed females to report 
significantly worse global health status over time (β = 1.7, standard error 
[SE] = 0.4, p = 0.02). Among patients with disease recurrence, females reported 
worse general HRQOL than males in long-term follow-up (β = -3.8, SE = 1.7, 
p = 0.03). For patients without disease recurrence, we did not find a 
significant difference in general HRQOL between females and males (β = -0.83, 
SE = 1.2, p = 0.5). A significant correlation between general HRQOL, and urinary 
continence and physical-, functional-, or emotional well-being was observed for 
both genders (p range = 0.001-0.02). A strong correlation between social/family 
well-being and increased HRQOL was found for female (p = 0.001), but not for 
male (p = 0.1) patients.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Female patients report worse general 
HRQOL in long-term follow-up after RC, with different gender-specific factors 
influencing HRQOL.

PURPOSE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the 
diagnostic performance of MRI-based deep learning (DL) algorithms versus 
radiologists in detecting lymph node metastasis (LNM) in colorectal cancer 
(CRC).
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and 
Web of Science up to June 30, 2025 for studies evaluating MRI-based DL 
algorithms for LNM diagnosis, using histopathology as the reference standard. 
Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated 
using a bivariate random-effects model. Risk of bias and applicability were 
assessed using the PROBAST+AI tool. Certainty of evidence was rated with the 
GRADE approach.
RESULTS: A total of 10 studies met inclusion criteria. Internal validation 
cohorts (9 studies, n=1850) showed pooled sensitivity of 0.89 (95% CI: 
0.80-0.94), specificity of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.77-0.91), and AUC of 0.93 (95% CI: 
0.91-0.95). Radiologists achieved lower pooled sensitivity of 0.65 (95% CI: 
0.60-0.71) and specificity of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.71-0.77), with an AUC of 0.76 (95% 
CI: 0.73-0.80). DL algorithms in internal validation cohorts consistently 
outperformed junior radiologists in all metrics, and demonstrated higher 
sensitivity and AUC than senior radiologists(all P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: MRI-based DL algorithms show promising diagnostic performance in 
detecting LNM in CRC, with performance generally higher than those reported for 
radiologists in internal validation cohorts, particularly junior-experienced 
readers. However, most included studies were retrospective and originated from 
China, limiting generalizability. Prospective, multicenter studies are warranted 
to validate these findings across diverse populations.

Social media can benefit prostate cancer care through education and empowerment, 
but also have the potential for exposure to misinformation, leading to adverse 
health and/or economic impacts for patients and damaging the patient-physician 
relationship. Clinicians should promote digital health literacy and provide 
recommended sources of reliable online content for additional information.

Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, necessitating 
innovative approaches to improve treatment strategies. Molecular dynamics and 
molecular docking simulations have emerged as powerful computational tools in 
understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer progression and 
therapeutic resistance. These simulations provide atomic-level insights into 
protein behavior, drug-target interactions, and cellular processes, aiding in 
the identification of novel inhibitors and drug candidates. This review 
highlights recent advancements in molecular dynamics and docking studies applied 
to breast cancer research, with a focus on understanding receptor dynamics, 
protein-ligand interactions, and biomolecular pathways. Additionally, we discuss 
the role of these simulations in exploring cancer cell signaling, 
microenvironment interactions, and treatment optimization. By addressing current 
challenges and emerging opportunities, this review underscores the potential of 
molecular simulations in driving personalized and targeted breast cancer 
therapies.

INTRODUCTION: Brachytherapy is a critical component of curative treatment in 
locally advanced cervical cancer. NRG GY-017 is a randomized Phase I trial of 
the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab administered neoadjuvantly and concurrently 
with chemoradiation (Arm A) or only concurrently with chemoradiation (Arm B) in 
patients with node positive locally advanced cervical cancer. Image guided 
brachytherapy (IGBT) was mandated in the protocol with a quality assurance (QA) 
workflow. Herein, we report the BT quality data on NRG GY-017 trial and practice 
patterns from the participating centers in this trial as a guide for future 
protocol brachytherapy QA.
METHODS: The participating sites were to submit brachytherapy plans online after 
BT was completed. IROC QA center compiled the BT fractions for each patient 
using the trial specific dosimetry evaluation template. An expert physician 
reviewer scored the contours and plans as per protocol, variation acceptable or 
major deviation as prespecified in the protocol dose metrics.
RESULTS: The BT dosimetry results were available for 32 patients. Seventeen 
patients (53%) had intracavitary applicator, and 15 patients (47%) had hybrid or 
interstitial applicators. Point A directed planning was performed for 4 patients 
(12.5%) and 28 patients had volume directed plans (87.5%). For imaging use, 2 
patients had MRI based plans, and 30 had CT based planning (94%). For the dose 
constraints compliance per protocol, 7 patients had 9 events scored as major 
deviations (22%).
CONCLUSION: BT trial specific QA has the potential to enhance BT quality for 
clinical trials. This report will help guide future gynecologic BT trial data 
collection and QA process.

INTRODUCTION: Managing locally recurrent gynecologic cancer with pelvic wall 
invasion, particularly after prior pelvic radiotherapy, presents a significant 
clinical challenge. Combined operative and radiotherapeutic treatment (CORT) is 
a potential curative approach. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and 
morbidity of this technique in this patient population as implemented within a 
single institution.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A comprehensive, retrospective analysis was conducted on 
patients treated with CORT for recurrent gynecologic cancer with pelvic wall 
invasion after prior pelvic radiotherapy at the University Hospitals of Leuven 
between January 2000 and December 2023.
RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were eligible for analysis. All patients 
underwent open surgical macroscopic tumor resection with intraoperative 
implantation of brachytherapy guiding tubes. The average radiation dose to 90% 
of the treatment volume (D90) was 45.6 Gy EQD2 (range 16.0 to 66.2 Gy). The 
median follow-up period was 37.8 months (range 3-230 months). Local control at 2 
and 5 years was 87,4% and 77,8%; overall-survival at 2 and 5 years was 57,1% and 
52,4%, respectively. Seventeen of the 21 patients experienced some form of 
adverse event, with 15 patients needing surgical re-intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective analysis demonstrates high local control and 
favorable overall-survival outcomes in patients with recurrent gynecologic 
cancer involving the pelvic wall. However, the treatment is associated with a 
substantial risk of severe adverse events. Given the complexity and potential 
morbidity of this approach, CORT should be performed in specialized centers with 
experience in managing such cases.

BACKGROUND: Despite numerous randomized controlled trials finding that albumin 
is not associated with improved patient outcomes, transfusion practice is highly 
variable. We examined the variability and impact of albumin transfusion on 
outcomes in cancer surgery.
METHODS: We included consecutive adults undergoing cancer surgery between 2018 
and 2021 in Ontario, Canada. The primary exposure was the proportion of patients 
who received perioperative albumin. The secondary outcomes were hospital length 
of stay and the incidence of infection, anemia, venous thromboembolism, and 
mortality in albumin-treated versus non-albumin-treated patients in a 
case-control analysis.
RESULTS: Of 155 166 cancer surgeries (66.8% female patients, median age 62.9 
yr), 2.5% received perioperative albumin. The cancer surgery types with the 
highest proportion of patients receiving albumin were hepato-pancreato-biliary 
(24.8%) and colorectal (18.6%). Of 104 facilities, 12.5% had nonrandom outliers 
for albumin use in at least 1 cancer type (p = 0.0004). Patient outcomes were 
different in case-control matched cohorts for colorectal and 
hepato-pancreato-biliary surgeries, including a higher rate of infection, venous 
thromboembolism, and mortality in patients treated with albumin (cases) than 
those who were not (controls).
CONCLUSION: Albumin transfusion rates were highly variable among hospitals for 
the same cancer type. Quality improvement initiatives are warranted to curtail 
unnecessary albumin transfusions in the perioperative period.

CONTEXTE: Bien que de nombreux essais randomisés et contrôlés aient révélé que 
l’albumine n’était pas associée à une amélioration des résultats cliniques, les 
pratiques en matière de transfusion sont très variables. Nous avons évalué la 
variabilité et l’influence de la transfusion d’albumine sur l’issue 
d’interventions chirurgicales en oncologie.
MÉTHODES: Nous avons inclus des adultes ayant subi une chirurgie oncologique en 
Ontario, au Canada, consécutivement entre 2018 et 2021. Le paramètre principal 
d’exposition correspondait à la proportion de cette patientèle ayant reçu de 
l’albumine en période périopératoire. Les paramètres secondaires étaient la 
durée du séjour à l’hôpital et l’incidence d’infection, d’anémie, de 
thromboembolie veineuse et de mortalité chez la patientèle traitée par 
l’albumine comparativement à celle non traitée par l’albumine dans une analyse 
cas–témoins.
RÉSULTATS: Des 155 166 personnes ayant subi une chirurgie en oncologie (66,8 % 
de femmes, âge médian 62,9 ans), 2,5 % ont reçu de l’albumine en période 
périopératoire. Les types de chirurgies oncologiques où la proportion de la 
patientèle recevant de l’albumine était la plus élevée étaient les chirurgies 
hépatopancréatobiliaires (24,8 %) et les chirurgies colorectales (18,6 %). Sur 
104 établissements, 12,5 % présentaient des valeurs aberrantes non aléatoires 
pour la transfusion d’albumine dans le traitement d’au moins 1 type de cancer (p 
= 0,0004). On observait un écart entre les résultats cliniques dans les cohortes 
cas–témoins appariées sur le plan des chirurgies colorectales et 
hépatopancréatobiliaires, notamment des taux d’infection, de thromboembolie 
veineuse et de mortalité plus élevés chez la patientèle traitée par l’albumine 
(cas) que chez celle qui ne l’était pas (témoins).
CONCLUSION: Les taux de transfusion d’albumine étaient très variables entre 
hôpitaux pour un même type de cancer. Il y aurait lieu de mettre en œuvre des 
initiatives d’amélioration de la qualité visant à réduire les transfusions 
d’albumine inutiles en période périopératoire.

BACKGROUND: Recurrence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) affects 
nearly half of patients and greatly reduces survival. There are currently no 
well-established mechanisms to predict which HNSCC patients will experience 
disease recurrence. We have previously shown that an elevated proportion of 
highly differentiated, CD57+ effector memory T (HD TEMRA) cells in circulation 
is associated with early recurrence and poor locoregional disease control in 
HNSCC patients.
METHODS: Here, we present refined flow cytometry panels utilizing fewer 
fluorescent antibodies that retain the prognostic value of HD TEMRA cells in 
predicting HNSCC recurrence.
RESULTS: In our cohort of surgically treated HNSCC patients, identifying HD 
TEMRA cells via flow cytometry as live CD8+ CD28- CD57+ cells effectively 
predicted disease recurrence. When assessing this cohort by disease subsite, we 
found that for patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma, identifying HD TEMRA 
cells by CD8+ CD57+ alone was sufficient for predicting locoregional disease 
recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: These refined panels enhance the clinical utility of HD TEMRA 
proportion as a biomarker due to their technical and analytic ease. 
Implementation of HD TEMRA cell proportion as a clinical biomarker could aid in 
personalized HNSCC treatment planning.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa) frequently coexist, 
posing unique challenges for the clinician. This article explores how various 
surgical and minimally invasive therapies for BPH can be utilized in patients 
with PCa, including those managing with active surveillance or pursuing 
radiation treatment. The discussion herein highlights the efficacy, 
complications, and oncological implications of these treatments. Ultimately, 
treatment selection requires shared decision-making and a multidisciplinary 
approach to achieving symptom relief while maintaining cancer control. Future 
research will be critical to refine best practices and assess long-term outcomes 
in these clinical situations.

Eosinophils are a rare immune cell subset with important roles in Th2 immunity 
and cancer. Interleukin IL-33 (IL-33) plays important functions in the survival 
and activation of eosinophils. Recent evidence unraveled the role of IL-33 in 
activating the anti-tumor activities of eosinophils enhancing their 
degranulation and tumor cell killing in a contact-dependent manner. We propose a 
dual approach methodology to extrapolate the physical interactions of 
eosinophils with tumor cells as a result of eosinophil stimulation. Human 
eosinophils isolated from the blood of healthy donors by dextran sedimentation 
followed by magnetic sorting are exposed to either IL-33 (Eos33) or IL-5 (Eos5) 
for 18 h. These pre-conditioned cells are then co-cultured with A375P melanoma 
cells to monitor cell-cell interactions. Acoustic focusing flow cytometry 
analysis is employed to evaluate the presence of eosinophil-tumor cell 
conjugates after 1 h incubation of human eosinophils and A375P melanoma cells. 
Moreover, a 24 h time-lapse video recording approach is employed to obtain 
single cell tracking eosinophil profiles. This allows to quantitatively 
determine the interaction extent of Eos33, as opposed to Eos5, with tumor cells. 
In conclusion, our protocols easily and quickly allow the extrapolation of 
relevant kinematic and biologically relevant parameters for tumor reactive 
eosinophils. Furthermore, these methods are adaptable to various models with 
other types of immune cell subsets and cancer cells and can be implemented on 
different video microscopy platforms and advanced flow cytometry systems.

INTRODUCTION: Therapeutic exercise has been used to improve cancer-related 
dysfunction. Recent studies suggest that exercise after chemotherapy can improve 
cancer-related cognitive impairment. However, the effect of exercise during 
chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer remains unclear. Aerobic dance is a 
comprehensive form of aerobic exercise which may be more easily accepted by 
female patients. The Aerobic Dance Against NeuroCognitive decline (ADANC) trial 
is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of aerobic dance during chemotherapy 
on breast cancer-related cognitive impairment. It aims to determine if aerobic 
dance offers better cognitive improvement compared with brisk walking of equal 
training intensity.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Participants will be recruited from the First Affiliated 
Hospital of Nanjing Medical University and randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 
either the aerobic dance group, the fast walking group or the usual care group. 
The aerobic dance and brisk walking groups will participate in supervised 
sessions lasting 50 min, three times a week for 12 weeks. The exercise intensity 
will be adjusted based on the rating of perceived exertion and heart rate before 
and after each session. Assessments will be conducted at baseline (T0), midway 
through the intervention (T1), at the end of the intervention (T2) and 12 weeks 
post-intervention (T3). The assessment will cover cognitive function, 
cancer-related fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, quality of life and 
anthropometric measurements, including arm volume. The main hypotheses are to 
assess the effectiveness of aerobic dance on chemotherapy-related cognitive 
impairment in patients with breast cancer and to determine if aerobic dance 
offers greater cognitive improvement compared with brisk walking of equivalent 
training intensity.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial was prospectively registered in the Clinical 
Trials Registry and received approval from the Ethics Committee of the First 
Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (reference number: 
2023-SR-732). The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed 
publications and presentations at conferences. Only the principal investigators 
will have access to the final trial dataset, and the full protocol and 
anonymised participant-level dataset will be available on reasonable request.
TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT06234150.

Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common cancer worldwide. Solar 
ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is the primary risk factor. Consequently, outdoor 
workers face a potential long-term occupational hazard, but little is known 
about the extent to which occupational UVR exposure affects the risk of NMSC. We 
aimed to quantify the exposure-response relation between occupational solar UVR 
exposure and NMSC incidence in a nationwide cohort. We conducted a 
register-based cohort study of the entire Danish workforce 1977-2015 assessing 
the association between occupational UVR exposure and the incidence of basal 
cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) as recorded in the Danish 
Cancer Register. Exposure was measured in standardised erythema dose (SED) based 
on a newly developed European UVR job exposure matrix. We analysed 
confounder-adjusted incidence rate ratios of NMSC with a discrete-time hazard 
model and modelled the shape of the exposure-response relation with restricted 
cubic splines. Of the 2,943,463 workers followed for a median of 20 years, 
26,958 were diagnosed with BCC and 1,132 with SCC. Median cumulative exposure 
was 5.99 SED-years. We observed a positive exposure-response relation between 
occupational solar UVR and BCC, with an adjusted incidence rate ratio of 1.58 
(95% CI: 1.47-1.70) in the highest exposure quartile compared with the lowest. 
Results for SCC suggested a similar exposure-response pattern, although not 
reaching statistical significance. We observed a strong exposure-response 
relation between occupational solar UVR exposure and the risk of NMSC in Danish 
workers. These findings underscore the need for implementing preventive 
strategies. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: j.no.: 1-16-02-196-17.

Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are intracellular transporter proteins that 
regulate lipid transport, signalling, and homeostasis. In this review, we assess 
whether upregulation of FABP3 is oncogenic. Cancers where overexpression of 
FABP3 was shown to be oncogenic included breast, brain, nonsmall cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), gastric, melanomas, and leiomyosarcoma. FABP3 knockdown in 
brain, oesophageal, and melanoma cell lines reduced proliferation, migration, 
invasion, and colony formation in vitro, and attenuated glioma tumour burden in 
vivo. In tumours and the tumour immune microenvironment, the protumoral 
mechanisms of FABP3 are associated with hypoxia, ferroptosis, endothelial growth 
factor receptor resistance, and lipid metabolism. Emerging mechanisms primarily 
relate to its role as a chaperone of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). 
Overall, FABPs appear to be promising targets for novel cancer treatments.

BACKGROUND: Mitochondria and ferroptosis are crucial in tumorigenesis. However, 
their specific role in cervical cancer (CC) remains unclear. This study aimed to 
identify and validate prognostic genes linked to mitochondrial function and 
ferroptosis in CC.
METHODS: Publicly available datasets were analyzed, including 306 CC tumor 
samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas-Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and 
Endocervical Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-CESC), with survival data for 293 samples, a 
training set of 24 normal and 33 tumor tissues (GSE9750), and a validation set 
of 300 tumor tissues (GSE44001). Prognostic genes associated with 
mitochondria-related genes (MRGs) and ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) were 
identified through machine learning, univariate Cox regression, Weighted Gene 
Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), Mendelian randomization (MR), 
differential expression analysis, and multivariate Cox analysis. A risk model 
was constructed and validated, with the High-Risk Group (HRG) and Low-Risk Group 
(LRG) defined by optimal risk score thresholds. Independent prognostic analysis, 
functional enrichment, immune infiltration profiling, and single-cell resolution 
studies were conducted to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. 
Additionally, gene expression was validated in five paired clinical samples (5 
tumor/5 normal tissues) using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-qPCR).
RESULTS: HSDL2, AMACR, and CBR3 were identified as prognostic genes. The risk 
model indicated significantly poorer survival rates in HRG patients (P < 0.05). 
It demonstrated strong predictive performance, with area under the curve (AUC) 
values exceeding 0.7 in both the training and validation sets. The risk score, 
tumor (T) stage, and lymph node (N) stage were identified as independent 
prognostic factors for a nomogram model (hazard ratio (HR ≠ 1, P < 0.5). 
Pathways co-enriched by these markers, such as allograft rejection, were 
investigated. Immune infiltration analysis revealed significant differences 
between HRG and LRG in M0 macrophages and resting myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) 
(P < 0.5). Macrophages and epithelial/cancer cells were identified as key 
contributors to CC progression, exhibiting 13 and 7 distinct differentiation 
states, respectively, in pseudo-time analysis. Notably, HSDL2 and CBR3 
expression levels were significantly different between normal and CC samples (P 
< 0.05).
CONCLUSION: HSDL2, AMACR, and CBR3 were established as prognostic biomarkers for 
CC. The risk model demonstrated robust predictive accuracy, offering a 
scientific foundation for clinical prognosis prediction in CC.

The biomechanics of clinical cancer stem cells (CSCs) and tumor cells (TCs) play 
a crucial role in cancer progression. We compared the biomechanical profiles of 
clinical CSCs and TCs from untreated patients with lung benign (LB) and 
malignant (LM) tumors, including lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) and lung squamous 
cell carcinoma (LSCC). The results showed that TCs were mechanically stiffer 
than CSCs, with a greater stiffness increase in LB tumors compared to LM 
tumors., indicating that LB tumors have softer CSCs and stiffer TCs than those 
of LM tumors. The mechanical properties of TCs and CSCs from individual patients 
were linearly correlated for each tumor type and may be related to the tumor 
stage and grade. These findings align with cytoskeletal and morphological 
analyses of CSCs and TCs. Furthermore, we identified genes and proteins, such as 
BCL9L, that regulate cellular mechanical properties and explain the changes in 
these characteristics during differentiation from CSCs to TCs. Finally, the 
joint mechanical properties of CSCs and TCs serve as better biomarkers than the 
mechanical properties of either CSCs or TCs for tumor classification. STATEMENT 
OF SIGNIFICANCE: The biomechanics of clinical cancer stem cells (CSCs) and tumor 
cells (TCs) play a pivotal role in cancer progression. This study demonstrates 
that TCs exhibit greater stiffness compared to CSCs, with notable distinctions 
observed between benign and malignant lung tumors. The mechanical properties of 
CSCs and TCs are strongly correlated with tumor type, stage, and grade, while 
regulatory genes such as BCL9L contribute to these biomechanical variations. 
Importantly, the combined biomechanical profiles of CSCs and TCs outperform the 
individual properties of either cell type as biomarkers for tumor 
classification.

In colorectal cancer (CRC), dysregulated Hedgehog (Hh) and fibroblast growth 
factor receptor 3 (FGFR3)-related pathways drive tumor progression, but their 
molecular crosstalk remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the 
scaffold protein PDZ domain-containing1 (PDZK1) is significantly upregulated in 
CRC and associated with poor patient prognosis. Functionally, PDZK1 promotes CRC 
cell proliferation by serving as a direct transcriptional target of Gli family 
zinc finger 2 (Gli2), the key effector of Hh signaling. Knockdown of PDZK1 
markedly attenuated Gli2-driven oncogenic effects, whereas enforced PDZK1 
expression rescued the growth inhibition induced by Gli2 silencing, confirming 
its essential role in Hh signaling-mediated malignancy. Mechanistically, PDZK1 
physically interacts with FGFR3 and facilitates its membrane trafficking, 
thereby enhancing receptor availability and downstream activation of AKT and 
STAT3 signaling. Our findings reveal PDZK1 as a critical oncogenic scaffold 
bridging Hh and FGFR3-related pathways in CRC, offering a potential therapeutic 
target for intervention.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality 
worldwide, yet the precise mechanistic role of M2 macrophages in the tumor 
microenvironment during CRC progression remains poorly characterized. In this 
study, we elucidate a novel molecular pathway whereby glutathione peroxidase 2 
(GPX2) orchestrates M2 macrophage polarization via macrophage migration 
inhibitory factor (MIF) signaling to drive CRC progression. Integrated analysis 
of single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics 
revealed that high expression of GPX2 was significantly associated with advanced 
CRC stages and unfavorable clinical outcomes. Furthermore, tumor cells with 
elevated expression of GPX2 showed notable spatial colocalization with activated 
MIF pathway and M2 macrophages. Functional assays demonstrated that GPX2 
upregulation enhanced CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. 
Mechanistically, we established that GPX2 stabilizes MIF expression through 
USP7-mediated deubiquitination, thereby promoting macrophage M2 polarization. In 
vivo animal studies demonstrated accelerated tumor growth associated with GPX2 
overexpression, correlating strongly with increased MIF signaling and M2 
macrophage. Collectively, our results delineate a previously unrecognized 
GPX2-MIF-M2 macrophage axis that critically promotes CRC progression, 
positioning GPX2 as a potential therapeutic target for CRC intervention.

CECR2 is a bromodomain-containing epigenetic regulator essential for maintaining 
chromatin architecture and is implicated in diverse biological processes, 
including cellular development, spermatogenesis, neurulation, and DNA damage 
response. Acting as a histone acetyl-lysine reader, CECR2 participates in 
chromatin remodeling through the formation of tissue-specific complexes with 
ISWI proteins. With its well-established roles in somatic cell reprogramming, 
CECR2 has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic target in breast cancer 
metastasis. In this review, we discuss its origin, structural features, 
regulatory mechanisms, and assembly into multiple protein complexes that mediate 
its tissue-specific functions in coordination with various transcription 
factors. Furthermore, we emphasize its significance in pathological conditions 
such as developmental disorders and cancer, aiming to elucidate the molecular 
connections that underlie its role in tumor progression and potential as a drug 
target.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has an extremely poor clinical prognosis 
due to the lack of effective therapeutic targets and high heterogeneity. In this 
study, we developed a synergistic chemoimmunotherapy based on tumor-derived 
extracellular vesicles (TEVs), which induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) and 
remodels the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) by delivering 
pirarubicin (THP). 4T1 TNBC cell derived TEVs were loaded with THP via overnight 
co-incubation at room temperature (THP@TEVs), which exhibited excellent tumor 
targeting and biocompatibility. In vitro experiments demonstrated that THP@TEVs 
was efficiently internalized by tumor cells, and compared to the free THP group, 
THP@TEVs significantly increased the apoptosis rate (70.25% vs. 25.61%, p<0.001, 
n=3)"". In vivo studies showed that THP@TEVs significantly activated the ICD 
effect and promoted CD8⁺ T-cell infiltration by enhancing calreticulin (CRT) 
membrane translocation and high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) release (CRT 
increased≈3 fold; HMGB1 increased≈3.1 fold). In addition, compared with the 
control group, the tumor volume in the THP@TEVs group was reduced by 
approximately 62.1% (p<0.001, n=5) and no histopathological changes were 
observed in major organs (such as heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys) upon 
H&E staining. This study provides a precise, low-toxicity chemotherapy and 
immune synergistic strategy for TNBC and expands the potential of TEVs in tumor 
therapy.

BACKGROUND: The HYpofractionated irradiation for PROstate cancer (HYPRO) trial 
was a multicenter, randomized, phase 3, superiority trial comparing dose 
escalated hypofractionation (HF) with conventional fractionation (CF) for the 
treatment of localized intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer. This trial 
aimed to demonstrate equivalent toxicity of HF. In prior publications, 
non-inferiority of acute and late toxicity could not be established. Here we 
report the long-term survival outcomes.
METHODS: We randomly assigned patients (1:1) with intermediate- to high-risk 
T1b-T4NX-N0MX-M0 localized prostate cancer to receive either HF (64.4 Gy in 19 
fractions of 3.4 Gy, 3 fractions per week) or CF (78.0 Gy in 39 fractions of 2 
Gy, 5 fractions per week) radiation therapy. The HF schedule was a dose 
escalation compared with CF, based on a α/β ratio of prostate cancer of 
approximately 1.5 Gy, the equivalent total dose in fractions of 2 Gy is 90.4 Gy 
for HF versus 78.0 Gy for CF. The primary endpoint of this paper was 
relapse-free survival at 10 years and secondary outcome was overall survival.
RESULTS: Of the 820 patients, 804 were included in the current evaluation, 407 
patients received HF and 397 CF radiation therapy. The 10-year relapse-free 
survival was 64.5% (95% CI, 58.6 - 69.7) in the HF arm compared with 60.1% (95% 
CI, 53.9 - 65.8) in the CF arm (HR:0.89, 95% CI, 0.69 - 1.14; P = 0.35). The 
10-year overall survival in the HF arm was 69.2% (95% CI, 64.1 - 73.7) versus 
61.2% (95% CI, 55.7 - 66.2) in the CF arm (HR: 0.82, 95% CI, 0.65 - 1.05; 
P=0.11).
CONCLUSION: In the updated findings, we could not demonstrate a statistically 
significant improvement in 10-year relapse-free survival following dose 
escalated HF compared to CF. Although patients in the HF arm showed favorable 
10-year overall survival, this difference did not remain statistically 
significant in the multivariable analysis.

PURPOSE: To clarify the predictive significance of several preoperative 
nutritional indexes including the prognostic nutritional index (PNI), geriatric 
nutritional risk index (GNRI), modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS) and 
controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score for the occurrence of anastomotic 
leakage after esophagectomy among esophageal cancer patients.
METHODS: Several databases were searched up to September 28, 2024. Relative 
risks (RRs) with 95% confidence interval (CIs) were combined and subgroup 
analysis based on pathological type, type of surgery and source of RR was 
performed.
RESULTS: Thirteen retrospective studies with 3333 cases were included and the 
incidence rate of anastomotic leakage was 9.12% (304/3333). Eleven, three and 
one studies explored the predictive role of PNI, GNRI and mGPS for postoperative 
anastomotic leakage, respectively. Pooled results indicated that decreased 
preoperative PNI was related to significantly increased risk of anastomotic 
leakage (RR=2.90, 95% CI: 1.75-4.82, P＜0.001). Subgroup analysis stratified by 
the pathological type (squamous cell carcinoma), type of surgery (minimally 
invasive surgery) and source of RR (univariate and multivariate analysis) 
manifested similar results. However, no significant association of GNRI 
(RR=1.37, 95% CI: 0.69-2.74, P=0.368) or mGPS (RR=1.41, 95% CI: 0.70-2.86, 
P=0.345) with the risk of anastomotic leakage was observed.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative PNI might serve as predictor for postoperative 
anastomotic leakage among patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between a stress urinary incontinence 
(SUI) diagnosis, patient-reported urinary symptoms, and physical, role, 
emotional, cognitive, and social functioning among 2 to 12-year survivors of 
prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study based on the Danish SEQUEL cohort that 
comprises validated patient-reported outcomes and data from national health 
registers, including information on cancer treatment within the first year after 
diagnosis. Information on SUI diagnosis was obtained from the National Patient 
Register. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the association 
between an SUI diagnosis, patient-reported urinary symptoms, and functioning 
domains.
RESULTS: A total of 27,507 survivors of prostate cancer were invited to SEQUEL, 
of whom 9,619 responded. Within a year of diagnosis, 3,855 survivors underwent 
radical prostatectomy and were included in the study. Survivors diagnosed with 
SUI (N=308, 8%) reported a lower role functioning score (-5.8 points, 95% CI: 
-8.1 to -3.4), a lower social functioning score (-7.1 points, 95% CI: -9.4 to 
-4.7), and a higher level on the urinary symptom score (9.9 points, 95% CI: 7.7 
to 12.1) compared to survivors without an SUI diagnosis, indicating 
statistically significant differences of small to moderate clinical relevance.
CONCLUSION: Two to 12 years after radical prostatectomy, survivors with an SUI 
diagnosis reported lower role and social functioning scores and higher urinary 
symptom scores than survivors without an SUI diagnosis. The long-term effect of 
an SUI diagnosis on role and social functioning is important to consider when 
choosing the primary treatment.

OBJECTIVES: Cancer imposes an enormous burden. In China, research on cancer 
economic burden have primarily focused on the direct economic burden while the 
indirect economic burden of cancer (IEBC) has been overlooked. Therefore, we 
aimed to conduct a systematic quantification of IEBC in China in 2021.
METHODS: A human capital approach was used to estimate IEBC. The loss of 
productivity time was approximated based on disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) from the GBD 2021. The labour force participation rate and per capita 
economic parameters were sourced from various datasets, and subgroup and 
sensitivity analyses were conducted. The indirect-to-direct economic burden 
ratio was estimated partially based on results from a literature review.
RESULTS: The overall IEBC in populations in China was estimated to be CNY1014.4 
billion in 2021, representing 0.89% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Among 
this total, CNY990.3 billion (97.6%) was attributed to premature death and 
CNY24.1 billion to disability; CNY822.3 billion (81.1%) to males and CNY853.8 
billion (84.2%) to populations under the age of 60 years. Region heterogeneity 
was observed to be CNY26.5 billion for the Northwest and CNY263.7 billion for 
the East. Of the overall IEBC, 58.8% (CNY596.9 billion) could be attributed to a 
range of modifiable risk factors (tobacco was the leading risk at CNY304.6 
billion); 76.0% (CNY770.8 billion) was attributed to screening-targeted cancers, 
mainly gastrointestinal cancers (CNY458.2 billion), lung cancer (CNY232.9 
billion), breast and cervical cancer (CNY57.2 billion). The by-cancer median 
value of the indirect-to-direct economic burden ratio was 2.56 (range 0.83 to 
4.76).
CONCLUSIONS: The previously underestimated IEBC was roughly 3 times the reported 
direct economic burden in populations in China. Systematic quantification of the 
IEBC from ""preventable"" and ""screenable"" cancer types suggests there to be a 
potential extent of future economic benefit of implementing more effective and 
scaled-up population-based primary and secondary interventions.

Clinical research in oncology is essential for improving patient outcomes; 
however, cancer care provision and access to novel therapies remains highly 
heterogeneous across Europe, particularly between Western and Eastern EU27 
regions. This has been further compounded by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 
severely disrupting regional cancer treatment, research infrastructures and 
clinical trials activity. Challenges to clinical research in the Central and 
Eastern regions of the European Union (EU27-CEE) are multifactorial, relating to 
patient access, local implementation and conduct of trials, education, 
infrastructure and regulatory procedures. Nevertheless, EU27-CEE comprises a 
very active clinical trial landscape with its specialist workforce, high 
productivity and quality of data, empowering a growing regional pharmaceutical 
industry and establishing itself as an important clinical cancer research hub 
for conducting global trials. Consequently, patients recruited in EU27-CEE 
exercise an important impact on global cancer drug development. Poland has 
proven to be a model for biomedical innovation, serving as the region's 
blueprint for a productive clinical trials ecosystem. Multi-stakeholder 
collaboration and patient-centric approaches are required to streamline 
procedures for quicker trial initiation, simpler trial conduct, and better 
cross-border access. Recognizing these challenges and opportunities, we have 
developed, through a consultative approach, a Call to Action that, if 
implemented, would enhance the cancer clinical trials landscape in EU27-CEE 
countries and empower patient access to the latest advances and therapies in 
cancer drug development.

High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with anal high-grade 
intraepithelial lesion (aHSIL) and anal squamous cell carcinoma (aSCC). The 
prognostic significance of PD-L1 expression in aSCC and its impact on overall 
survival (OS) is controversial. ASCC can evade immune surveillance by co-opting 
the PD-L1/PD-1 immune checkpoint pathway, enhancing tumorigenesis. To assess the 
potential role of the PD-L1/PD-1 axis on tumor progression, we assessed PD-L1 
and PD-1 expression on epithelial cells and immune cells by immunohistochemistry 
in non-lesional anal tissue (n=22), aHSIL (n=22), and aSCC (n=52) from 
HIV-negative participants and people living with HIV. PD-L1 expression on 
epithelial cells was restricted to tumor cells with no expression in 
non-lesional and HSIL tissues, while PD-L1-positive immune cells were present 
across all three diagnostic stages. PD-1 expression was absent on epithelial 
cells whereas PD-1-positive immune cells increased along the disease continuum 
from non-lesional to aSCC. The overall PD-L1 expression on epithelial cells and 
immune cells measured by the combined positive score (CPS) in aSCC and the 
aggregate PD-L1 score in non-lesional and HSIL showed a substantial increase 
from non-lesional to aHSIL to aSCC. In aSCC, PD-L1 expression on immune cells 
was more prominent than in tumor cells and correlated with increased immune cell 
infiltration and interferon-gamma secretion. 92% of aSCC exhibited an adaptive 
PD-L1 expression pattern characterized by PD-L1 expression on tumors cells, 
immune cells or both. HIV status did not affect PD-L1/PD-1 expression in 
non-lesional, aHSIL or aSCC. PD-L1 expression in treatment naïve aSCC was 
associated with improved OS. Those with CPS of 0 had a higher risk of death 
[Hazard ratio 15.2 (95% CI: 3.3-69, p=0.0004; log-rank p<0.0001)] compared to 
those with CPS > 0. CPS may indicate the presence of immune activation and serve 
as a potential prognostic marker.

Chemokine signaling plays a pivotal role in cancer progression, shaping the 
tumor microenvironment and influencing disease outcomes. Among these, 
interactions between the chemokine CCR2 receptor and its ligand CCL2 has been 
shown to be a key driver of cancer progression by recruiting immune-suppressive 
cells to the tumor microenvironment. Most CCR2-targeting antibodies block the 
N-terminal domain (NTD) of the receptor as this is the primary binding site of 
its ligand CCL2. However, CCR2 contains three additional extracellular loops 
that also participate in binding interactions, thus mediating downstream 
signaling. Here, we developed a biparatopic antibody that targets two distinct, 
non-overlapping epitopes on CCR2: the NTD and the extracellular loop 3 (ECL3). 
We hypothesized that simultaneously blocking two distinct epitopes on CCR2 would 
more effectively inhibit the CCR2/CCL2 signaling axis, thus curtailing tumor 
progression. Binding interactions were modeled using AlphaFold and HADDOCK and 
validated by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance assays. When compared to 
monospecific constructs, the biparatopic antibody demonstrated stronger binding 
affinity to a CCR2-mimicking peptide. Functional studies showed that treatment 
with the biparatopic antibody enhanced macrophage polarization to a 
pro-inflammatory (anti-tumor) state, with up to 70-fold improvement in M1/M2 
ratios in bone marrow-derived macrophages relative to single-epitope blockers. 
In a murine model of triple-negative breast cancer, the biparatopic antibody 
demonstrated a significant reduction in tumor growth. These findings highlight 
its potential as a therapeutic agent for reshaping macrophage polarization and 
inhibiting tumor progression.

Tumor-infiltrating bacteria are increasingly recognized as modulators of cancer 
progression and therapy resistance. We describe a mechanism by which 
extracellular intratumoral bacteria, including Fusobacterium, modulate cancer 
epithelial cell behavior. Spatial imaging and single-cell spatial 
transcriptomics show that these bacteria predominantly localize extracellularly 
within tumor microniches of colorectal and oral cancers, characterized by 
reduced cell density, transcriptional activity, and proliferation. In vitro, 
Fusobacterium nucleatum disrupts epithelial contacts, inducing G0-G1 arrest and 
transcriptional quiescence. This state confers 5-fluorouracil resistance and 
remodels the tumor microenvironment. Findings were validated by live-cell 
imaging, spatial profiling, mouse models, and a 52-patient colorectal cancer 
cohort. Transcriptomics reveals downregulation of cell cycle, transcription, and 
antigen presentation genes in bacteria-enriched regions, consistent with a 
quiescent, immune-evasive phenotype. In an independent rectal cancer cohort, 
high Fusobacterium burden correlates with reduced therapy response. These 
results link extracellular bacteria to cancer cell quiescence and 
chemoresistance, highlighting microbial-tumor interactions as therapeutic 
targets.

Genomic instability is a defining feature of cancer that fuels transformation, 
tumor evolution, and therapeutic resistance. However, genomic instability also 
incurs an immunological liability by generating cytosolic DNA, a potent trigger 
of cGAS-STING signaling. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our 
understanding of the sources of immunostimulatory cytosolic DNA in genomically 
unstable cancer cells. We examine how newly identified regulatory mechanisms, 
including chromatin-mediated cGAS suppression, influence the immune-activating 
potential of cytosolic DNA generated by genomic instability. We also highlight 
how key regulators, such as the exonuclease TREX1, may be co-opted to shield 
genomically unstable cancer cells from immune surveillance. By synthesizing 
these recent advances in our understanding of cGAS-STING activation and 
regulation in cancer, we aim to highlight emerging therapeutic strategies that 
leverage cGAS signaling to bolster antitumor immunity.

Nitrate and trihalomethanes (THMs) in drinking water are widespread and 
potential human carcinogens. We evaluated the association between time-varying 
exposure to nitrate and THMs in drinking water and female breast cancer (BC) 
among adults from CONSTANCES, a large French population-based prospective 
cohort. Our analysis included 26,669 women (18.5-72.5 years old) enrolled in 
2012-2020, followed until 2021, with information on residential history, type of 
water consumed, type of filter used, and bathing and showering frequency. We 
used water quality data for 2004-2020 from the drinking surveillance national 
database (SISE-Eaux). Annual median concentrations of nitrate, chloroform, 
chlorodibromomethane, bromodichloromethane, and bromoform at the participants' 
residential addresses were estimated. Waterborne ingested exposure was estimated 
considering type of water, filter used, and liters/day consumed. Estimated 
exposure in showers and baths combined residential concentrations with 
showers/baths duration and frequency. Incident BC cases were ascertained in the 
French national health data system (SNDS) for 2012-2021. Extended Cox models 
with attained age as time-scale and time-varying weighted average exposures, 
adjusted for individual and area-level covariables, were used to estimate hazard 
ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CI) by exposure tertiles. Average age at 
enrolment was 49.3 years, and median exposure window was 13 years. Median 
follow-up was 5 years (153,742 person-years), resulting in 437 new BC diagnoses. 
Median residential nitrate, brominated (Br)-THMs and chloroform concentrations 
were, respectively, 15.8 mg/L, 14.2 μg/L, and 2.7 μg/L. HR (95 %CI) of BC 
associated with waterborne ingested nitrate (mg/day) for the second (>4.8-15.1) 
and third tertile (>15.1) compared to the first (≤4.8) were 1.35 (1.01-1.81) and 
1.51 (1.10-2.07), respectively. Residential THM concentrations were not 
associated with BC, however HR (95 %CI) of BC for showering and bathing Br-THMs 
exposure (μg/L × min/day) was 1.18 (0.84-1.64) for the third (>125) vs. first 
tertile (≤51.5). Findings suggest that ingested nitrate could be a risk factor 
of BC.

Since the infiltration of intratumoral microbiota is associated with aggressive 
phenotypes of cancer, eliminating bacteria within tumors has become an 
attractive approach to cancer treatment. By self-assembly of PEGylated 
metronidazole (MTI-PEG), we developed a nanosized antibiotic that effectively 
eliminates intratumoral bacteria without causing gut microbiome dysbiosis. In 
Fusobacterium nucleatum spp (Fn) colonized tumor models, we observed significant 
adjuvant effects of MTI-PEG on chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy 
through reversing drug resistance through the modulation of autophagy, the human 
T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) and the 
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT) signaling pathway, 
respectively, while reshaping immune landscape of tumor microenvironment. The 
encouraging results indicate a promising future for MTI-PEG in 
microbiome-infiltrated tumors, with potential to improve the overall therapeutic 
efficacy of current cancer treatments.

Breast cancer progression involves extensive remodeling of the extracellular 
matrix (ECM), including increased stiffness, altered viscoelasticity (stress 
relaxation), and elevated collagen levels. While in vitro experiments have 
revealed a role for each of these factors in individually promoting malignant 
behavior, their combined effects remain unclear. Here, we engineered 
alginate-collagen hydrogels with independently tunable stiffness, stress 
relaxation, and collagen density to dissect how the complex ECM environment 
regulates cancer cell phenotype. We show that high stiffness, fast stress 
relaxation, and high collagen density led to changes in cell morphology, marked 
by decreased roundness, and promoted spheroid invasion in both breast cancer and 
non-transformed mammary epithelial cells. Single cell migration speed and 
displacement were greatest in matrices of high stiffness, low collagen density, 
and slow stress relaxation. RNA-seq and Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation 
(CUT&Tag)-seq revealed that high stiffness and fast stress relaxing groups were 
enriched for Sp1 target gene expression as well as increased Sp1 binding at 
genomic loci. Notably, analysis of publicly available claudin-low breast cancer 
data showed that high expression of the Sp1-regulated genes in fast stress 
relaxing groups was correlated with significantly reduced patient survival. 
Mechanistically, we found that phosphorylated Sp1 (T453) exhibited increased 
nuclear localization in matrices with high stiffness and fast stress relaxation. 
Furthermore, Sp1 phosphorylation was regulated by PI3K and ERK1/2 activity, as 
well as actomyosin contractility. Our tunable hydrogel platform reveals that 
multiple tumor-mimicking cues within complex viscoelastic microenvironments 
reinforce malignant traits, with Sp1 acting as a mechanoresponsive transcription 
factor that transduces these signals.

In a previous commentary, ""An apparent quandary: adoption of polygenics and gene 
panels for personalized breast cancer risk stratification,"" we highlighted the 
exceptional progress that had been made uncovering the polygenic risk component 
underpinning breast cancer susceptibility and drew attention to the critical 
challenges inherent in translating these advancements into measurable 
improvements in clinical care. Among the barriers to adoption discussed were the 
inherent biases in polygenic risk scores (PRS) developed in populations of 
largely European descent, the unpreparedness of professional societies for 
adoption, and the lack of education of current healthcare professionals and the 
cadres of those emerging from training. In this update, we focus on the 
substantial research advances that have been made and the cultural and practical 
transitions that have begun to position the field for delivering personalized 
preventive breast cancer services to all women. It is our perception that the 
discussion has moved from questions of establishing scientific validity to a 
focus on the development and application of practical operational solutions to 
better stratify risk. Additional issues raised are concerns over misuse, the 
composition of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) panels used and 
adjustment for non-European populations. High-risk breast clinics will benefit 
dramatically from models that incorporate genome-wide susceptibility genetics. 
Improved risk estimation may aid in patients' decisions about preventive 
medication and in clinical decisions concerning the need for and frequency of 
MRI screening, and, in exceptional cases, may even help patients at hereditary 
risk with surgical decision-making.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of exosome-mediated miR-199b-5p on lung cancer 
cells behavior, intrapulmonary metastasis, and its underlying mechanism.
METHODS: Exosomes from SK-LU-1 cells overexpressing has-miR-199b-5p 
(miR-199b-5p) were used to treat A549 or H299 cells. Cell motility was evaluated 
using wound scratch healing and transwell assays. Gene and protein expression 
were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) and Western blot. Target 
genes of miR-199b-5p were predicted through multiple-database analysis and 
validated.
RESULTS: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated isolated exosomes 
had a typical bilayer membrane (30-100 nm). miR-199b-5p was highly expressed in 
lung cancer cells and detectable in the serum of lung cancer patients, with the 
highest levels observed in SK-LU-1 cells and their derived exosomes. Exosomal 
miR-199b-5p significantly enhanced the motility of A549 and H1299 cells and 
upregulated the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related 
proteins. Exosomes promoted lung metastasis of H1299 cells and inhibited the 
expression of Cyclin L1 (CCNL1). Either CCNL1 inhibition or miR-199b-5p 
overexpression significantly promoted H1299 cell proliferation and reduced 
apoptosis, while CCNL1 overexpression inhibited cell motility. Protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network, Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses indicated involvement of the Wnt/β-catenin 
signaling pathway in the downstream mechanism. Mechanistically, miR-199b-5p 
inhibited cyclin-dependent kinase 11 (CDK11) and upregulated the expression of 
transcription factor 4 (TCF-4) and β-catenin.
CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of miR-199b-5p promotes proliferation, migration, 
and EMT in lung cancer cells by targeting CCNL1, with its downstream regulatory 
effects mediated through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Malignant ascites is a defining and clinically challenging feature of advanced 
ovarian cancer, driving peritoneal dissemination, therapeutic resistance, and 
poor clinical outcomes. Beyond its traditional description as a protein-rich 
fluid, high-resolution profiling now reveals ascites as an active ecosystem that 
enforces vascular leakage, creates dynamic interactions among cellular, 
acellular, and environmental components, fuels cellular reprograms, and builds 
profound immune suppression. In this review, we first synthesize established 
knowledge on ascites formation and composition, and then delineate how this 
milieu reshapes tumor, stromal, and immune compartments, altering their fate and 
function. We also integrate current diagnostics and map the therapeutic 
landscape spanning vascular permeability control, effective locoregional 
chemotherapy, cellular reprogramming, and stress/metabolic interventions, 
alongside palliative drainage devices. A deeper understanding of the dynamic 
interactions and regulatory mechanisms within malignant ascites provides a 
foundation for developing new therapeutic strategies to overcome its clinical 
challenges and improve outcomes for ovarian cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related 
mortality worldwide. Despite advances in treatment, the prognosis for advanced 
GC remains poor, highlighting the need for new therapeutic targets. Ferroptosis, 
a form of programmed cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid 
peroxidation, has emerged as a potential pathway for cancer therapy. This study 
aims to identify ferroptosis-related genes in GC using transcriptomics and 
machine learning, and to validate the role of one key gene, Glutamic-Oxaloacetic 
Transaminase 1 (GOT1), in GC progression.
METHODS: The Sangerbox platform was employed to analyze differentially expressed 
genes between GC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues in the GSE184336 
dataset. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was used to 
identify co-expressed gene modules from the GSE184336 dataset and their 
associations with phenotypes. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest 
(RF) regression algorithms were applied to screen for core target genes. 
Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze mRNA expression, while 
western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays were used to determine 
protein expression. Cell proliferation was assessed using a 
5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay, and cell migration was analyzed using a 
Transwell assay. Flow cytometry was used to quantify cell death. Fluorometric 
and colorimetric assays were performed to analyze Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) 
and Fe2 + levels, respectively. A xenograft mouse model was used to evaluate the 
impact of GOT1 overexpression on tumor formation in vivo. Haematoxylin and eosin 
(HE) staining was used to analyze the pathological conditions of tumors.
RESULTS: The analysis of the GSE184336 dataset identified 2297 dysregulated 
genes in GC tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. WGCNA revealed 
strong correlations between gene significance and module membership in the 
""green,"" ""ivory,"" and ""lightsteelblue1"" modules, encompassing 350 genes. 
Subsequent analysis identified 14 intersection genes among the 2297 dysregulated 
genes in GC tissues, the 350 genes from WGCNA, and the 1467 genes related to 
ferroptosis. Machine learning algorithms and protein-protein interaction 
analysis identified IDH2, BGN, IGFBP7, and GOT1 as key genes. GOT1 expression 
was downregulated in GC tissues with the lowest error value. Overexpression of 
GOT1 inhibited GC cell proliferation, migration, and induced ferroptosis, 
whereas these effects were reversed by treatment with Fer-1. Further, GOT1 
overexpression suppressed the malignant phenotype of GC cells in vivo.
CONCLUSION: This study identified several ferroptosis-related genes in GC, with 
GOT1 being a critical regulator. Overexpression of GOT1 significantly inhibited 
GC cell proliferation and migration, and induced ferroptosis. These findings 
suggest that GOT1 could serve as a potential therapeutic target for GC 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: The convergence of climate change and cancer is an emerging research 
area with significant implications for public health. This bibliometric analysis 
aimed to map the growth, trends, contributors, collaboration networks, and 
thematic areas related to this field.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and Scopus databases for 
peer-reviewed literature published between 2000 and 2024 using predefined 
keywords. One-hundred and nineteen eligible articles were analyzed for metrics 
like co-authorship networks and keywords co-occurrence.
RESULTS: The volume of research has seen a significant rise since the 2010s. The 
United States, China, and the United Kingdom were leading contributors, while 
the Low- and Middle-Income Countries were underrepresented. Dominant research 
themes included climate change and cancer, pollution and cancer, sun exposure, 
temperature and skin cancer, and air pollution and climate change. Air pollution 
and particulate matter were identified as high-density and centrality motor 
themes.
CONCLUSION: This analysis provides a first-of-its-kind mapping of 2 decades of 
global research at the intersection of climate change and cancer. Future 
research should prioritize global South perspectives, context-specific 
investigations, and longitudinal studies integrating registry data for in-depth 
studies to elucidate the causal relationships between climate change and cancer 
types. The oncology community should engage in climate action through mitigation 
and adaptation strategies.

The molecular classification of endometrial cancer has revolutionized risk 
stratification, with POLE-mutated tumors recognized for their excellent 
prognosis. However, the optimal management of patients with nodal involvement 
remains unclear. This multi-center retrospective study evaluates the outcomes of 
patients with stage IIIC endometrial cancer with positive sentinel lymph nodes 
harboring POLE mutations. Of 164 POLE-mutated cases undergoing sentinel node 
mapping, 11 (6.7%) had nodal metastases (classified as isolated tumor cells [n = 
6; 54.5%], micro-metastases [n = 3; 27.3%], or macro-metastases [n = 2; 18.2%]). 
All patients except 1 received adjuvant therapy, tailored according to molecular 
and pathologic risk factors. After a median follow-up of 7.6 months, no 
recurrences were observed. These findings suggest excellent short-term outcomes, 
even in node-positive POLE-mutated endometrial cancer. Nevertheless, the study 
does not support omitting adjuvant therapy in this setting. Larger studies and 
long-term data, such as those expected from the ongoing Refining Adjuvant 
treatment IN endometrial cancer Based On molecular features (RAINBO)/ Blue trial 
are needed to guide safe de-escalation strategies.

OBJECTIVE: Ovarian Cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Central to 
treatment is a correct initial assessment and the probability of complete 
resection of visible cancer. The predictive index value (PIV) is a validated 
tool for laparoscopic procedures, assessing the chance of complete resection by 
evaluating 7 intra-abdominal areas. The final PIV determines the type of 
treatment to which women with ovarian cancer are referred. Gynecologic 
oncologists perform the procedure and assessment, and agreement and correct 
staging are essential. This study examines the agreement among gynecologists 
when assessing videos using the PIV.
METHODS: Laparoscopic videos were collected from October 2021 to January 2024, 
comprising 20 videos, of which 5 were duplicated. Each video was edited by a 
gynecologic oncologist, representing the seven intra-abdominal areas according 
to the PIV model. Eight gynecologic oncologists, eight gynecologists specialized 
in benign conditions, and eight residents in gynecology were invited to assess 
the videos using the PIV. The ratings from the participants were examined 
according to laparoscopic real-time scores. Inter-rater and intra-rater 
agreement were quantified using kappa statistics.
RESULTS: Twenty-one individuals participated in the study. Correct assessment of 
intra-abdominal areas, that is, agreement with laparoscopic real-time scores, 
ranged from 58.4% to 81.7%. The probability of correct scores among groups of 
gynecologists ranged from 34% (95% CI 14.9 to 60.2) to 98.9% (95% CI 95.9 to 
99.7), with the highest scores among gynecologic oncologists. The inter-rater 
agreement of all participants ranged from moderate to substantial agreement 
(Light κ = 0.436-0.624). For specific intra-abdominal sites, it ranged from fair 
to perfect agreement (Light κ = 0.181-0.829).
CONCLUSIONS: Assessing ovarian cancer based on videoclips was challenging, even 
for specialists in gynecologic oncology, indicating that edited videos reduce 
accuracy in evaluating disease burden. Gynecologic oncologists achieved the 
highest scores among all groups, suggesting that specialized training and 
knowledge improve consistency and that the assessment should remain an expert 
task.

Breast cancer is the most common non cutaneous cancer in Irish women. Diagnosis 
offers a key opportunity to promote lifestyle change. This study assessed 
awareness of modifiable lifestyle risk factors and acceptability of secondary 
risk reduction services amongst breast cancer survivors and healthcare 
professionals. A cross-sectional study was conducted between September and 
December 2021. Surveys were developed using previously validated questionnaires: 
the Mitchelstown Cohort Survey and the International Physical Activity 
Questionnaire. A survey was offered to healthcare professionals working in and 
patients attending the early breast cancer outpatient clinic at the South 
Infirmary Victoria and Cork University Hospitals', Ireland. 322 patients and 29 
healthcare professionals participated. Many patients met at-risk lifestyle 
factors; body mass index >25kg/m2 (66 % [n = 203/313]), low physical activity 
(19 % [n = 60/322]), frequent consumption of high fat, sugar and salt containing 
foods (42 % [n = 135/320]), increased alcohol consumption (39 % [n = 125/322]) 
and current smoker (5 % [n = 17/322]). 83 % of patients and HCPs agreed that 
modifiable lifestyle risk factors are important in cancer prevention. Only 17 % 
(n=5/29) of HCPs had training in secondary risk reduction; however, 90 % were 
willing to refer to services. Patients who had increased alcohol intake or 
weight gain since diagnosis were more likely to engage with services (44 %, 
n = 15/34 [p=<0.008]) and (74 %, n = 99/134, [p = <0.001]). A large proportion 
of patients met at-risk lifestyle criteria. Gaps in knowledge of at-risk 
lifestyle behaviours exist. Patients intended engagement with some secondary 
risk reduction services was associated with their lifestyle behaviours. Our 
study highlights the challenges of implementing survivorship health promotion 
programs.

Mounting evidence identifies cancer as the leading cause of death in diabetic 
patients, necessitating therapies that disrupt this pathological nexus. We 
demonstrate that the flavonoid breviscapine inhibits diabetes-accelerated 
gastric cancer through a novel 'contextual programmed lethality' mechanism 
targeting the lactylation-ferroptosis axis. Employing network pharmacology, 
molecular dynamics simulations, and in vitro experiments, we revealed EGFR and 
SRC as core breviscapine targets within AGEs-RAGE-glycolytic networks, with 
molecular dynamics confirming stable high-affinity binding (ΔG < -4.39 kcal/mol; 
RMSF < 0.15 nm). Crucially, we identified a diabetes-specific vulnerability: 
AGEs-induced lactylation stabilizes GPX4 (half-life >24 h), conferring 
ferroptosis resistance. Breviscapine reverses this by: 1) dismantling 
lactylation-dependent GPX4 stabilization (half-life reduced to 5.1 ± 0.4 h), and 
2) co-opting restored cholesterol synthesis (+2.3-fold) to fuel lethal lipid 
peroxidation (LPO increased 3.2-fold). This dual action selectively suppressed 
AGEs-driven malignancy-reducing proliferation by 63 ± 5.2 % and migration by 58 
± 4.3 %-while reversing Warburg metabolism (lactate decreased to 82 ± 7 % 
baseline). Efficacy was abrogated by LDHA overexpression or HMGCR inhibition, 
confirming mechanistic specificity. By exploiting metabolic rewiring to induce 
iron-dependent death exclusively in diabetic microenvironments, breviscapine 
emerges as a novel therapeutic strategy against diabetes-aggravated cancers.

Ovarian cancer is a significant clinical problem with late diagnosis, high 
recurrence, and resistance to therapy. Greater reliance on ubiquitin to induce 
the degradation of oncogenic proteins instead of inhibiting their activity is 
provided by proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs). This review outlines the 
molecular architecture of PROTACs, their use against important ovarian 
cancer-driven molecular targets, including BRD4, NAMPT, FAK, FER, and TG2, and 
the benefits over traditional inhibitors, which include enhanced selectivity, 
longer efficacy, and ability to target undruggable targets. We also talk about 
the key obstacles to clinical translation, such as off-target effects, 
unfavorable pharmacokinetics, and tumor microenvironment concerns, and emerging 
technologies, including nanoparticle delivery and light-responsive or reversible 
PROTACs. As PROTACs progress from preclinical research to clinical 
implementation, their incorporation into ovarian cancer treatment presents a new 
model for precision oncology. This review highlights the therapeutic potential 
of PROTACs by linking preclinical progress to translational options to expand 
precision oncology to treat ovarian cancer.

Steroid hormones play an important role in the maintenance and progression of 
cancer. This study explored the biotransformation of nandrolone and testosterone 
by human intestinal fungal strains (Syncephalastrum monosporum PYS2703, 
Aspergillus japonicus Y4009A, Rhizopus microsporus PT2906, Aspergillus niger 
RG13B1) in vitro. A total of twenty-two metabolites were identified, including 
eight novel compounds (1-7, 13) and fourteen known analogs (8-12, 14-22). The 
structures of all metabolites were determined via NMR and HRESIMS spectroscopic 
techniques. The structural analysis revealed that hydroxylation and oxidation 
were the primary biotransformation reactions. In addition, metabolites (1-29), 
including those derived from norethisterone biotransformation by Rhizopus 
microsporus PT2906 in a previous study (metabolites 23-29), displayed special 
cytotoxicity on cervical cancer HeLa cells. Among these, 
6,7-didehydronorethisterone (26), exhibited the most remarkable anti-tumor 
activity, which was achieved by inducing apoptosis through modulating the p53 
signaling pathway. Additionally, the study results suggested that compound 26 
may interact with the THR-256 and GLU-258 residues of p53 via hydrogen bonds. In 
conclusion, intestinal fungi play an important role in the metabolism of steroid 
hormones: they can biotransform nandrolone and testosterone into various 
derivatives, which can serve as crucial resources for cancer treatment.

During the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients, 
the emergence of various resistance mechanisms compromises the efficacy of 
second-generation antiandrogens. Recently, the targeted protein degradation 
(TPD) strategy has been harnessed for the development of novel AR inhibitors, 
aiming to overcome current resistance mechanisms. Our previous studies 
identified Z15 as a selective androgen receptor degrader (SARD). Here, we 
optimized the structure of Z15 and identified ZA5 as a potent dual degrader of 
both AR and ARV7. ZA5 directly interacts with the ligand-binding domain (LBD) 
and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of AR, promoting the degradation of AR/ARV7. 
Moreover, ZA5 effectively suppresses the transcriptional activity of wild-type 
AR (AR-WT), AR mutants, and ARV7, while downregulating the mRNA and protein 
levels of downstream AR target genes, thereby overcoming antiandrogen resistance 
mediated by ARV7 and AR point mutations. This study provides a potential lead 
compound with dual AR/ARV7 inhibitory activity, offering a novel therapeutic 
strategy to combat drug resistance in CRPC.

Our preliminary studies indicate that cevipabulin concurrently binds to both the 
vinca site and the gatorbulin site, and promotes tubulin degradation. To improve 
its antiproliferative activity and investigate the structure-activity 
relationships (SARs), thirty-eight cevipabulin derivatives were designed and 
synthesized based on the cevipabulin-tubulin cocrystal structure. Among them, 
compound 8g exerted optimal antiproliferative activity, with IC50 values ranging 
from 0.016 to 0.035 μM against three tested tumor cell lines. The cocrystal 
structure of the 8g-tubulin complex revealed that it simultaneously occupies 
both the vinca site and the gatorbulin site, while maintaining a binding mode 
similar to that of cevipabulin. Furthermore, 8g promoted αβ-tubulin degradation 
and displayed good oral bioavailability. In an HT29 xenograft model, oral 
administration of 8g at doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg every 3 days resulted in potent 
in vivo antitumor activity, with tumor growth inhibition (TGI) rates of 41.0 % 
and 49.5 %, respectively. Moreover, 8g exhibited significantly reduced toxicity 
and fewer adverse effects compared to cevipabulin, supporting its potential as a 
promising therapeutic agent for cancer treatment.

Activating mutations in the NRF2 pathway characterize an aggressive, molecularly 
distinct subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) associated with poor 
prognosis and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). In this study, 
we used a validated NRF2 transcriptional signature along with a 
literature-curated, immune-related 47-gene set associated with favorable 
responses to ICI (the ""ICI-Immune"" signature) to demonstrate the heterogeneous 
expression of ICI response markers and tumor-infiltrating immune cells in lung 
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) with hyperactive 
NRF2. Protein association network and gene expression correlation analyses 
revealed that NRF2 and ICI-Immune gene sets operate as independent, loosely 
connected transcriptional modules, wherein the ICI-Immune genes show no 
significant correlation with NRF2 activity. Dichotomous categorization of NSCLC 
into NRF2-low and NRF2-high signature groups indicated an overall 
immune-depleted tumor microenvironment in NRF2-high cases, as well as identified 
a tumor subset exhibiting the NRF2-high phenotype without documented 
NFE2L2/KEAP1 mutations. Interestingly, clustering of NSCLC based on NRF2 and 
ICI-Immune scores showed that while most NRF2-high cases express low levels of 
ICI-Immune genes and tumor-immune infiltrates, a subset termed 
""NRF2-high/ICI-Immune-high"", which makes up approximately one-third of NRF2-high 
cases, exhibits molecular features characteristic of ICI-responsive cancers. 
This encompasses CD274/PD-L1 and ICI-Immune signature upregulation, an increased 
leukocyte fraction, augmented immune scores and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, 
as well as a greater frequency of the C2/IFNγ-dominant tumor-immune subtype. 
Histopathological analysis of n = 103 NSCLC cases identified a subgroup of 
NRF2-high/PD-L1+ tumors with increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), 
which may histologically represent the NRF2-high/ICI-Immune-high subset. 
Experiments in KEAP1-mutated cells and omics data from a panel of cell lines 
indicated that PD-L1 mRNA/protein levels are not dictated by constitutive NRF2 
activation in vitro. These results advance our understanding of the tumor 
microenvironment diversity in NSCLC with hyperactive NRF2 and offer a potential 
histology-based method to identify ICI responders within this subset.

BACKGROUND: Early decrease in Ki67 after a short preoperative course of 
endocrine therapy (ET) has shown prognostic and predictive value in clinical 
research, but its applicability and reproducibility in routine clinical practice 
remain largely unknown. We therefore assessed on-treatment Ki67 changes 
following a short preoperative ET and its association with biological variables, 
such as intrinsic subtype and risk of recurrence (ROR), plus long-term outcomes, 
in a real-world cohort of patients with early estrogen receptor-positive, human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-negative) breast cancer.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, registry-based analysis of 230 
consecutive patients with early ER+/HER2- breast cancer treated as per standard 
clinical care at the Breast Unit of the Clinic Barcelona Comprehensive Cancer 
Center between 2014 and 2023. All patients received preoperative ET, tamoxifen, 
or an aromatase inhibitor (AI), for 2-12 weeks before surgery. Clinical and 
pathological variables were collected and stratified by Ki67 response: 
""responders"" (post-treatment Ki67 0% to 10%) and ""complete cell cycle arrest 
(CCCA) responders"" (Ki67 ≤2.7%). PAM50/Prosigna was used to determine intrinsic 
subtypes and ROR-score. Event-free survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier 
curves, and associations were tested using Cox proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS: The median duration of preoperative ET was 5 weeks (min-max range, 2-12 
weeks). Overall, 196 patients (85.2%) met the Ki67 response criterion and 111 
(48.3%) achieved CCCA. Response rates were significantly higher in 
postmenopausal compared with premenopausal women (P = 0.004). Notably, 95.6% of 
postmenopausal patients received an AI, whereas all premenopausal women were 
treated with tamoxifen. Additionally, response varied by intrinsic subtype, 
favoring Luminal A tumors (P = 0.047). In multivariable models, postmenopausal 
status and higher baseline ER expression were independently associated with both 
Ki67 response and CCCA, whereas a lower baseline ROR-score predicted CCCA. After 
a median follow-up of 47 months, CCCA was associated with significantly improved 
event-free survival [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.19; 95% CI (confidence interval) 
0.05-0.72; P value = 0.012].
CONCLUSION: In routine practice, a short course of preoperative ET yields 
substantial reductions in tumor proliferation. Early assessment of Ki67 
suppression offers a readily accessible indicator of endocrine sensitivity, and 
achieving CCCA identifies patients who have a more favorable prognosis and thus 
are potentially eligible to de-escalate in treatment strategies.

INTRODUCTION: Previous evidence suggests that probiotics might play a prognostic 
role in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing immune 
checkpoint blockade, with their impact being influenced by the use of 
antibiotics.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a patient-level cross-trial analysis of five 
randomized controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy of first-line 
atezolizumab therapy in NSCLC. Using forest plot analysis, we examined whether 
exposure to probiotic supplement affected progression-free survival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS) in both atezolizumab-treated and non-atezolizumab-treated 
cohorts. Analyses were performed on the overall population as well as stratified 
by antibiotic use, aiming to validate the differential prognostic role of 
probiotic supplement in patients with and without antibiotic exposure emerged 
from earlier observational studies. Probiotic supplement and antibiotic use 
within 42 days before and after treatment initiation was examined. To avoid the 
immortal time bias, patients with a survival follow-up ≤ 42 days were excluded.
RESULTS: Among 3,600 patients, 2.2% (80/3,600) were exposed to probiotic 
supplement, while 30.2% (1,086/3,600) were exposed to antibiotics. Probiotic 
supplement use was not associated with significant differences in PFS or OS in 
either the atezolizumab or non-atezolizumab groups, across the overall 
population as well as subgroups stratified by antibiotic exposure. Moreover, the 
interaction terms between probiotic supplement use and treatment modality 
(atezolizumab vs. non-atezolizumab) were not statistically significant in 
analyses of patients with and without antibiotic exposure.
CONCLUSION: No significant association between probiotic supplement exposure and 
outcomes of patients receiving immunotherapy was observed, but further study is 
warranted.

IntroductionThere is large inter- and intra-country variability in ovarian 
cancer outcomes. Individuals diagnosed with advanced stage cancer in Nova Scotia 
have a 3-year net survival of 31.9%, the lowest in the country. This study aimed 
to identify factors impacting survival, and to investigate evidence of 
inequities in survival from the point of diagnosis moving forward.MethodsThis 
population-based retrospective study included all women diagnosed with ovarian 
cancer in Nova Scotia from Jan 1, 2007, to Dec 31, 2016. Administrative health 
data were linked to gather individual, tumor, and health system characteristics. 
Both prognostic and equity factors potentially contributing to variations and 
inequities in survival were assessed using descriptive and time to event 
techniques.ResultsThis study found no regional differences in survival across 
Nova Scotia. It revealed that disparities in equity factors do not appear to be 
significantly associated with survival at the time of diagnosis moving forward. 
Instead, survival variations were attributed to legitimate prognostic factors, 
such as cancer stage, subtype, comorbidities, and frailty. However, notable 
inequities were identified between socioeconomic status and prognostic factors 
that may contribute to poor survival upstream, rather than at the time of 
diagnosis.ConclusionThough inequities do not appear to directly contribute to 
differences in ovarian cancer survival at the time of diagnosis, they may 
influence outcomes by increasing the development of prognostic factors that lead 
to poorer survival. Future research should capture equity factors not found in 
administrative data and begin making comparisons between other jurisdictions to 
determine why survival rates vary worldwide.

Plain Language Summary: Survival rates for ovarian cancer have been found to 
vary between and within countries, as identified by past research efforts. 
However, it is unclear what causes these differences in survival or whether 
issues of fairness (ie, inequities) and access to care might play a role. As 
such, this study explored why ovarian cancer survival is lower in Nova Scotia, 
which is the province with the lowest 3-year survival rate for advanced ovarian 
cancer in Canada. We found that inequities may indeed impact survival, but in 
relation to the development of factors that affect people’s health and 
circumstances before they are diagnosed (ie, having other health issues). These 
findings highlight the need to address broader social and economic inequities 
that can lead to worse cancer outcomes. They also show that future research 
should go beyond routinely collected health data to understand what is driving 
survival differences.

BACKGROUND: Black individuals are more likely to die from colorectal cancer 
(CRC) and experience more treatment-related side effects compared to White 
individuals. Physical activity (PA) has been associated with decreased side 
effects, improved CRC treatment completion rates and responses, and survival. 
However, Black survivors of CRC are 60% less likely to engage in PA than White 
survivors. The Physical Activity Centers Empowerment (PACE) study is testing an 
intervention specifically designed to increase PA among Black individuals 
diagnosed with CRC.
OBJECTIVE: This study outlines the protocol for a randomized controlled trial. 
The study aims to test the feasibility of PACE and will use the reach, 
effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) framework.
METHODS: The PACE study was developed in partnership with a community advisory 
board consisting of Black cancer advocates and survivors of cancer. The study 
aims to recruit 72 participants aged >18 years from North Carolina who have been 
diagnosed with CRC. These participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an 
intervention or control group. During the 12-week intervention, all participants 
will receive a wearable activity tracker and informational materials from the 
American College of Sports Medicine's ""Moving through Cancer"" program. The 
intervention group will also receive additional PACE theory-guided intervention 
components, including personalized daily adaptive step goals, access to the PACE 
video library, and optional video chat meetings for PA support. Data will be 
collected at 3 time points: baseline, after the intervention (3 months), and 6 
months after the intervention (9 months). Using the RE-AIM framework, the study 
aims to evaluate the intervention's reach, effectiveness, acceptability, 
implementation, and maintenance.
RESULTS: The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities funded 
this study in 2021. Study enrollment began in August 2024 and is anticipated to 
conclude in December 2024.
CONCLUSIONS: This study will advance our understanding of effective behavioral 
strategies to increase PA and help advance the use of PA as a form of 
complementary cancer treatment, with the aim of improving health outcomes for 
Black survivors of CRC.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify tumor lesion-related factors associated 
with possible missed gastric cancer (PMGC) during screening endoscopy, with 
particular focus on cases following Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication.
METHODS: We analyzed consecutive gastric cancer (GC) cases detected at 11 health 
check-up institutions in Akita prefecture, Japan. The study focused on 171 GC 
cases with at least one negative endoscopy within the preceding 2 years. Based 
on histological assessment, GCs with pT1b or deeper invasion were classified as 
PMGCs. Their clinical characteristics were compared with those of the remaining 
pT1a GCs. A backward stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed to 
identify tumor lesion-related factors associated with PMGC.
RESULTS: Among 171 GC cases, 39 (22.8%) were classified as PMGC, while the 
remaining 132 served as controls. Overall, 108 cases (63.2%) occurred in 
individuals with prior HP eradication, and eradication status was not 
statistically associated with PMGC. Multivariable regression analysis limited to 
post-eradication cases revealed that upper third location and undifferentiated 
histology were significantly associated with PMGC, with odds ratios (95% 
confidence intervals) of 5.65 (1.88-16.90) and 8.35 (2.22-31.40), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Undifferentiated histology and upper third location were associated 
with missed diagnoses of GC during screening endoscopy in individuals with prior 
HP eradication. These findings are clinically relevant for improving the quality 
of endoscopic examinations in health check-up settings, especially given the 
increasing prevalence of post-eradication GC.

IntroductionAs cancer care increasingly shifts to outpatient settings, patients 
with incurable cancer and their caregivers face growing challenges in addressing 
supportive oncology needs across five domains: informational, physical, 
emotional, social, and spiritual. Integration of supportive care in routine 
oncology practice-or primary palliative care-remains limited. Oncology 
encounters prioritize clinical agendas, leaving little time for supportive care 
and setting the stage for adverse outcomes. This study pilot tested a primary 
palliative care communication intervention, PRECURSOR (NCT05995860), using a 
nonrandomized (10 usual care control, 10 intervention) approach in a gynecology 
oncology clinic.MethodsPRECURSOR combines a brief Freelisting activity-used to 
elicit communication intentions about supportive oncology needs among patients, 
caregivers, and providers-with an educational handout on the five domains of 
supportive oncology needs. Primary outcomes were feasibility (≥25% enrollment 
rate; ≥4 enrollments/month) and acceptability (overall and by component). 
Exploratory outcomes were communication behaviors (qualitatively coded from 
audio-recorded encounters) and post-encounter outcomes (via surveys).ResultsOf 
1356 screened, 78 were eligible, and 20 enrolled (26%) in 38 weeks (2 
enrollments/month). Most (70-78%) patients, caregivers, and providers rated 
PRECURSOR as acceptable overall. Patients and caregivers found both components 
acceptable, but providers favored the educational handout. Among exploratory 
outcomes, a greater proportion of the supportive oncology needs discussed during 
encounters were initiated by patients in the intervention group (46%), compared 
to control (37%). Average distress and anxiety scores were lower in the 
intervention group. No other patterns were observed among the exploratory 
outcomes. Qualitative findings indicated PRECURSOR was valuable, but refinements 
were suggested to increase impact.ConclusionsPRECURSOR was a feasible and 
acceptable primary palliative care communication intervention in the outpatient 
oncology setting. PRECURSOR holds potential to foster more patient-centered 
communication about supportive oncology needs and improve the psychological 
well-being of patients and caregivers facing incurable cancer, though 
refinements are needed.

Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop2) has been extensively characterized as 
a clinically relevant pan-cancer biomarker that is overexpressed in multiple 
malignancies, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In this study, we 
employed computational simulation strategies to develop peptide WP8 derived from 
midkine (MDK), a particular ligand of Trop2, and designed a Trop2-targeting 
radiotracer [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-PEG2-WP8 for positron emission tomography (PET) 
imaging of Trop2 expression. This radiotracer exhibits nanomolar affinity for 
Trop2, along with favorable stability and pharmacokinetic properties. Dynamic 
PET imaging revealed that [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-PEG2-WP8 displays significant and 
specific uptake in Trop2-positive TNBC tissues, enabling rapid and precise 
identification of Trop2 expression. Notably, this radiotracer demonstrated high 
sensitivity in detecting the response of TNBC tumor to Trop2-targeting 
antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Collectively, these findings indicate that the 
peptide-based radiotracer [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-PEG2-WP8 holds considerable potential as 
a noninvasive tool for accurately monitoring of Trop2 expression before, during, 
and after ADC-based therapies.

BACKGROUND: Asian American patients have reported unique needs and barriers 
related to cancer care. While patient navigation can facilitate care 
coordination and help address barriers to care, in-person navigation is time and 
resource intensive. Virtual patient navigation can extend the benefits of 
patient navigation to more patients, especially those with non-English language 
needs.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop, implement, and test an online portal 
providing virtual navigation, including access to resources in English, Chinese, 
and Vietnamese, for Asian American patients with newly diagnosed colorectal, 
lung, or liver cancer.
METHODS: The online portal was built on a secure, cloud-based platform. We 
recruited adults aged 21 years or older with a recent diagnosis of stage I-IV 
colorectal, lung, or liver cancer; who identified as Asian American; spoke 
English, Cantonese, Mandarin, or Vietnamese; and resided in the Greater San 
Francisco Bay Area, California. Participants were assigned a language-concordant 
navigator who assessed their needs and provided tailored resources and support 
over 6 months through the online portal. Participants completed baseline, 
3-month, 6-month, and user experience surveys. We report descriptive statistics 
on sociodemographic characteristics, quality of life (Functional Assessment of 
Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G]), and user experiences. We used generalized 
estimating equations (GEE) to analyze repeated measures of quality of life.
RESULTS: The online portal included (1) a public-facing landing page, (2) a 
navigator interface, and (3) a participant interface, which were all available 
in English, Chinese, and Vietnamese. Among 51 participants, 47 (92%) and 49 
(96%) completed the 3- and 6-month surveys, respectively. The mean age was 58 
(SD 13) years, with 37 (73%) men, 33 (65%) speaking English, and 20 (39%) having 
less than a college education. Twenty-six participants (51%) had colorectal 
cancer, 21 (41%) had lung cancer, and 4 (8%) had liver cancer. The average total 
FACT-G score was 73.0 (SD 17) at baseline, 73.2 (SD 17) at 3 months, and 75.1 
(SD 19) at 6 months. In GEE models, participants reported an increase in 
emotional well-being at 6 months compared to baseline (coefficient 0.99, 95% CI 
0.01-1.97). Among the 47 participants who completed the user experience survey, 
some reported issues with registering and logging into the portal, but 44 (94%) 
reported that the program was culturally appropriate, 35 (74%) found calls from 
the navigators helpful, and 35 (74%) would recommend the program to others.
CONCLUSIONS: This multilingual virtual patient navigation program for Asian 
American patients with cancer was deemed culturally appropriate and helpful in 
our pilot study. Emotional well-being improved among users of the portal. Some 
participants reported technical challenges, but most were satisfied with the 
program. Language-concordant virtual patient navigation and online supportive 
care tools can extend the reach and benefits of patient navigation.

PURPOSE: Little is known about whether Medicaid expansion under the Affordable 
Care Act affects insurance coverage among adult survivors of childhood cancer, a 
high-risk population requiring lifetime follow-up care. We examined the 
association of Medicaid expansion with Medicaid enrollment among participants in 
the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.
METHODS: We identified 13,355 adult survivors (age 18-64 years) diagnosed with 
cancer at age <21 years between 1970 and 1999 and linked these survivors to 
Medicaid administrative data from 2010 to 2019. Outcomes included the percentage 
of survivors with any Medicaid enrollment and Medicaid-covered days (total 
number of days when a survivor was enrolled in Medicaid) each year. 
Multivariable difference-in-differences (DD) models were used to examine outcome 
changes (post- v pre-expansion) in expansion versus nonexpansion states.
RESULTS: Medicaid enrollment rates among survivors increased in expansion states 
(17.1% pre-expansion to 22.8% postexpansion) but decreased in nonexpansion 
states (16.6%-15.7%), leading to a net increase of 7.1 percentage points (ppts; 
95% CI, 6.1 to 8.1). The DD model also showed a net mean increase of 18.7 
days/year (95% CI, 15.0 to 22.4) in Medicaid-covered days in expansion relative 
to nonexpansion states. The expansion-associated increase in enrollment was 
greatest among survivors who were age 18-29 years (11.2 ppts; 95% CI, 8.3 to 
14.1), non-Hispanic Black (13.6 ppts, 95% CI, 8.8 to 18.4) or Hispanic (13.4 
ppts, 95% CI, 7.0 to 19.8), with <$20K in US dollars (USD) self-reported 
household income (13.5 ppts, 95% CI, 10.7 to 16.3), and noncollege graduates 
(9.3 ppts, 95% CI, 7.7 to 10.9). Similar patterns were observed when examining 
Medicaid-covered days.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, we provide the first evidence of increased 
Medicaid enrollment and longer coverage duration among adult survivors of 
childhood cancer after Medicaid expansion. Greater increases were seen among 
survivors from underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds, young adult 
survivors, and those with lower socioeconomic status, providing a mechanism to 
reduce disparities and ensure long-term medical care for childhood cancer 
survivors.

PURPOSE: Clinical guidelines recommend offering individualized physical activity 
prescriptions to cancer survivors. However, there are limited tools to support 
individualized physical activity discussions and prescriptions. We developed and 
validated a simulation model-based tool to estimate individualized survival 
outcomes for postdiagnosis physical activity among postmenopausal breast cancer 
survivors.
METHODS: We adapted an established simulation modeling approach developed within 
the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network to estimate breast 
cancer-specific and all-cause survival associated with postdiagnosis physical 
activity for 50- to 75-year-old (postmenopausal) women with stage I to III 
invasive breast cancer. Model estimates were generated for 60,480 subgroups 
based on age, weight status (BMI), stage, tumor subtype, treatment, aerobic (<30 
min/wk [no/minimal], ≥30 to <150 min/wk [insufficient], ≥150 to <300 min/wk 
[active], ≥300 min/wk [highly active]), and muscle-strengthening (<2 or ≥2 d/wk) 
activity. The outcomes were 10-year survival and absolute survival benefits for 
different levels of physical activity by individual characteristics and 
treatment. Model inputs were derived from trials, cohort studies, registry, and 
surveillance data. External validation used independent data.
RESULTS: Survival rates and absolute benefits for physical activity varied by 
age, weight status, stage, tumor subtype, and amount and type of activity. For 
example, the 10-year breast cancer-specific and all-cause survival for 
no/minimal activity in a 65- to 69-year-old-woman with stage II, hormone 
receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast 
cancer with obesity was 79.2% and 72.2%, respectively. Increasing aerobic 
activity from no/minimal to insufficient activity with <2 d/wk of 
muscle-strengthening was associated with absolute increases in 10-year breast 
cancer-specific and all-cause survival by 2.8 and 3.4 percentage points, 
respectively. The model closely replicated survival rates in independent data.
CONCLUSION: Simulation model-based estimates could support clinical tools for 
guideline-recommended individualized discussions and physical activity 
prescriptions for breast cancer survivors.

Platelets (PLTs) have a significant impact on tumor development and progression, 
particularly in breast cancer, and contribute to cancer-associated thrombosis 
(CAT). Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), which is abundantly secreted by 
PLTs, is known to promote cancer aggressiveness. Nevertheless, the role of TGFβ 
in the PLT-cancer-cell interaction is largely unexplored. This study 
investigates how TGFβ stimulation of MCF7 breast cancer cells affects their 
capacity to interact with PLTs and induce PLT aggregation. MCF7, pre-treated 
with TGFβ and then exposed to PLTs, exhibited enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) and a significantly increased ability to bind PLTs in 
suspension, as well as to stimulate PLT activation and aggregation. Gene 
expression and surface protein analyses revealed that TGFβ induced the 
upregulation of MCF7 adhesion molecules such as integrin-αv/CD51 and galectin-3. 
Intriguingly, these effects were abolished when cells were plated at high 
density, suggesting that TGFβ signaling may be influenced by cell junction 
regulation. Furthermore, we selected specific inhibitors of integrin-αv 
(cilengitide) and galectin-3 (GB1107) that did not interfere with PLT 
aggregation itself. Cilengitide, but not GB1107, effectively reduced the 
increased PLT-MCF7 interaction induced by TGFβ. Both inhibitors, however, 
significantly diminished PLT aggregation triggered by TGFβ-treated MCF7 cells. 
Complementary analyses of proteomic datasets from breast cancer tissues 
demonstrated a significant positive correlation between TGFβ1 and the platelet 
marker integrin alpha-IIb (ITGA2B; also known as CD41), particularly in luminal 
A subtypes and in cancers with lymph node involvement. These findings suggest 
that TGFβ stimulation enhances PLT-breast-cancer cell interactions and promotes 
PLT aggregation through the upregulation of specific adhesion proteins, thereby 
potentially contributing to CAT and metastatic progression.

BACKGROUND: Accurate staging of esophageal cancer is crucial for determining 
prognosis and guiding treatment strategies, but manual interpretation of 
radiology reports by clinicians is prone to variability and limited accuracy, 
resulting in reduced staging accuracy. Recent advances in large language models 
(LLMs) have shown promise in medical applications, but their utility in 
esophageal cancer staging remains underexplored.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the performance of 3 locally deployed LLMs 
(INF-72B, Qwen2.5-72B, and LLaMA3.1-70B) and clinicians in preoperative 
esophageal cancer staging using free-text radiology reports.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 200 patients from Shanghai Chest 
Hospital who underwent esophageal cancer surgery from May to December 2024. The 
dataset consisted of 1134 Chinese free-text radiology reports. The reference 
standard was derived from postoperative pathological staging. A total of 3 LLMs 
determined tumor classification (T1-T4), node classification (N0-N3), and 
overall staging (I-IV) using 3 prompting strategies (zero-shot, 
chain-of-thought, and a proposed interpretable reasoning [IR] method). The 
McNemar test and Pearson chi-square test were used for comparisons.
RESULTS: INF-72B+IR achieved a superior overall staging accuracy of 61.5% and an 
F1-score of 0.60, substantially higher than the clinicians' accuracy of 39.5% 
and F1-score of 0.39 (all P<.001). Qwen2.5-72B+IR also demonstrated an 
advantage, achieving an overall staging accuracy of 46% and an F1-score of 0.51, 
which was better than the clinicians' performance (P<.001). LLaMA3.1-70B showed 
no statistically significant difference in overall staging performance compared 
to clinicians (all P>0.5).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that LLMs, particularly when guided by the 
proposed IR strategy, can accurately and reliably perform esophageal cancer 
staging from free-text radiology reports. This approach not only provides 
high-performance predictions but also offers a transparent and verifiable 
reasoning process, highlighting its potential as a valuable decision-support 
tool to augment human expertise in complex clinical diagnostic tasks.

BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery after surgery guidelines aim to optimize 
perioperative care and improve recovery outcomes. The guidelines contain 
clinician- and patient-led recommendations for pre- and postoperative care, with 
patient-led recommendations, including smoking cessation, early mobilization, 
and early resumption of eating and drinking. While adherence to these 
recommendations can improve recovery outcomes, it is typically low, and many 
patients require support. Digital health interventions (DHIs) are increasingly 
accepted as useful tools in delivering individualized health care and have the 
potential to support adherence to enhanced recovery after surgery guidelines. 
Evidence suggests that intervention use is optimized when DHIs are considered 
acceptable to end users. RecoverEsupport is a DHI designed to support patient 
adherence to surgical recovery guidelines, following breast cancer surgery, 
intended as part of a blended approach with standard care.
OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to explore the surgical experiences and perceived 
acceptability of the RecoverEsupport DHI among former patients undergoing breast 
cancer surgery.
METHODS: This qualitative study, underpinned by a constructivist paradigm, 
explored the recovery experiences and acceptability of RecoverEsupport among 
women who had undergone mastectomy for breast cancer at a tertiary hospital in 
New South Wales (NSW), Australia. In total, 57 eligible patients were identified 
from medical records and invited to participate. Among them, 15 consented and 
were given access to the RecoverEsupport DHI for approximately 2 weeks. Around 
11 participants then participated in a semistructured interview exploring their 
recovery experiences and feedback on the DHI. Interviews were transcribed and 
double coded prior to analysis using an inductive thematic approach.
RESULTS: Participants reported varied experiences of breast cancer surgery and 
expressed a consistent need for support, with many reporting uncertainty, 
anxiety, and limited information and physiotherapy support. RecoverEsupport was 
perceived as acceptable, with strong potential to reduce anxiety, address gaps 
in care, and provide reassurance. Participants valued the practical content, 
particularly physiotherapy exercise videos, which reinforced clinician advice 
and promoted confidence, autonomy, and self-efficacy. The intervention was seen 
as empowering patients to manage recovery and support their physical and 
emotional needs. All participants reported that they would recommend 
RecoverEsupport to others undergoing breast cancer surgery, highlighting its 
potential as a valuable adjunct to usual care.
CONCLUSIONS: RecoverEsupport was perceived as a valuable adjunct to standard 
perioperative care. Four key themes were identified. Participants reported that 
the program addressed key gaps in information, physiotherapy access, and 
emotional support, while complementing clinical care. The intervention was seen 
to empower patients by enhancing knowledge, confidence, and self-efficacy, 
enabling a more active role in their recovery. It also provided reassurance 
during a vulnerable period. These findings highlight the potential of DHIs to 
support patients within constrained health care systems and enhance recovery 
outcomes.

PurposeUpper limb dysfunction and inability to carry out everyday tasks are 
important consequences of disease process in breast cancer survivors. The aim of 
this study was to compare upper extremity functional exercise capacity and arm 
functionality between patients with breast cancer and healthy 
controls.MethodsNinety individuals participated in this analytical 
cross-sectional study. The study included 45 patients with breast cancer (mean 
age = 56.69 ± 9.37 years) and 45 healthy controls (mean age = 54.71 ± 6.54 
years). The unsupported functional arm exercise capacity was evaluated using the 
6-min Pegboard and Ring Test (6PBRT). The Quick Disabilities of the Arm, 
Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire (Q-DASH) was used for arm functions.ResultsThe 
6PBRT score of patients with breast cancer was significantly lower than those of 
healthy controls with medium effect size (194.16 ± 34.91 rings and 
218.87 ± 43.87 rings, respectively; p = 0.004, η2 = 0.065). The mean Q-DASH 
score of the patients was 22.12 ± 15.70. According to the Q-DASH score, 35.6% 
(n = 16) of the participants' arm functions were classified as normal, 51.1% 
(n = 23) having problems but working, and 13.3% (n = 6) being unable to work. 
There was a significant moderate negative correlation between 6PBRT performance 
and Q-DASH score in patients' with breast cancer (r = -0.453, 
p = 0.002).ConclusionUpper extremity exercise capacity and functionality are 
negatively affected in breast cancer survivors. Therefore, cardio-oncological 
rehabilitation approaches should incorporate arm aerobic exercise training to 
improve arm functionality during long-term follow-up after breast cancer medical 
treatments.

Analyses of patient-derived cell lines have greatly enhanced discovery of 
molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets. However, characterization of 
cellular morphological properties is limited. We studied cell morphologies of 
human pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines and their associations with 
drug sensitivity, gene expression, and functional properties. By integrating 
live cell and spatial messenger RNA imaging, we identified KRAS 
inhibitor-induced morphological changes specific for drug-resistant cells that 
correlated with gene expression changes. We then categorized a large panel of 
patient-derived PDAC cell lines into morphological and organizational subtypes 
and found differences in gene expression, therapeutic targeting potential, and 
metastatic proclivity. Patterns of cancer cell organization in human PDAC 
tissues stratified distinct gene expression signatures with clinical 
significance. In summary, we highlight the potential of cell morphological 
information in rapid, cost-effective assays to aid precision oncology efforts 
leveraging patient-derived in vitro models and tissues.

This study evaluates the differences in application of the RayStation Monte 
Carlo algorithm (RMC) compared to Acuros XB (AXB) and the Anisotropic Analytical 
Algorithm (AAA) in Eclipse for conventional radiotherapy planning of lung cancer 
using the novel ring-shaped Halcyon accelerator. A total of 63 non-small-cell 
lung cancer patients were retrospectively included, with a prescription dose of 
60 Gy delivered in 30 fractions. Radiotherapy plans were initially designed and 
optimized in RayStation, then recalculated in Eclipse using AXB and AAA to 
assess algorithmic differences in dose distributions. Analysis of data from 63 
patients, combined with simulations using square fields and cylindrical water 
phantoms, revealed that RMC and AXB achieved high consistency in target dose 
coverage and conformity. High-dose indicators, such as D2% and D0.03cc, showed 
close agreement between RMC and AAA, while AXB tended to slightly underestimate 
peak doses. For prescription dose coverage metrics like D95% and D98%, the 
difference between RMC and AXB was less than 1%, whereas AAA exhibited minor 
degradation. In organ-at-risk dose evaluations, RMC delivered higher doses 
compared to AXB and AAA, with AAA doses exceeding those of AXB. These findings 
confirm the dose consistency of RayStation and Eclipse algorithms for use with 
the Halcyon accelerator. The RayStation Monte Carlo algorithm (RMC) is a viable 
alternative to AXB, especially in lung cancer cases with high tissue 
heterogeneity, as target coverage and conformity discrepancies remain within 
0.5%. Additionally, recalculation of RMC-optimized plans in Eclipse using AXB 
resulted in lower organ-at-risk doses. Therefore, recalculations performed 
before treatment do not compromise the clinical adequacy of volumetric dose 
evaluations.

Small-molecule inhibitors have become a major therapeutic class for cancer 
treatment. A growing body of evidence sheds light on HuR in cancer progression. 
HuR is an RNA-binding protein involved in all post-transcriptional regulation 
mechanisms dictating the transcript's fate in the cell. This prompted scientists 
to develop HuR-targeted small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs). Due to its advantages, 
targeted therapy using SMIs has entered an era where it accelerates the 
potential of cancer treatment. This account summarizes the role of HuR in cancer 
progression and the effect of known SMIs targeting HuR in numerous cancers, 
emphasizing the perspectives in this field.

Understanding dormancy in prostate cancer (PCa) is challenging due to model 
availability. Here, using murine and human PCa cell lines, we generated a 
stress-induced model of dormancy in vitro and demonstrated that the phenotype 
could be sustained upon intrailiac artery delivery into the bone marrow 
microenvironment. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that the transcription factor PR 
domain containing 16 (PRDM16) was commonly upregulated in dormant PCa cells 
compared to controls. Further, bone marrow disseminated tumor PCa cells from 
primary orthotopic tumors were largely positive for PRDM16. Genetic ablation and 
forced ectopic expression supported a role for PRDM16 in maintaining PCa 
dormancy in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, PRDM16 negatively correlated with 
disease recurrence, and PRDM16 negatively correlated with the E2F cell cycle 
program in disseminated tumor cells derived from PCa patient bone marrow. Gene 
enrichment and characterization studies implicated PRDM16 as a regulator of 
metabolic and cell cycle pathways. ChIP-qPCR further revealed that PRDM16 binds 
upstream of the promoter of RB1, a potent repressor of E2F activity. Overall, 
this study developed a straightforward method for inducing cancer cell dormancy 
and applied this approach to find that PRDM16 governs an intrinsic dormancy 
program in PCa.

INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is the leading cancer among women globally, and its 
management typically involves surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. This 
combination of complex treatment increases the risk of drug-related problems 
(DRPs), which can negatively impact the quality of life as it prolongs the 
hospital stays, increases healthcare costs, and leads to morbidity and 
mortality. Research on DRPs in the context of breast cancer patients in Nepal is 
limited; therefore, this study aimed to identify DRPs, assess their prevalence, 
and examine their associated factors, while emphasizing the importance of 
pharmaceutical care.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Bhaktapur Cancer Hospital, 
Nepal, from February to May 2024. The medical records of 92 patients were 
reviewed to identify DRPs using the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe V9.1 
tool, along with related scientific literatures and evidence-based guidelines, 
and verified by two independent medical oncologists. Descriptive statistics were 
used to summarize the patient characteristics, while the chi-square test was 
used to evaluate the associations between socio-demographic and clinical 
characteristics with the presence of DRPs, with a p-value <0.05 considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS: DRPs were identified in 91 of 92 patients (98.9%), totaling 104 events. 
Most DRPs (87.5%) concerned treatment safety, while 12.5% involved treatment 
effectiveness. Patient-related factors (43.4%) and drug selection (33.3%) were 
primary causes. Common adverse effects included alopecia (88.0%) and anorexia 
(84.8%). A significant association was observed between adverse drug reactions 
(ADRs) and DRPs (Fisher's exact p-value = 0.011).
CONCLUSION: DRPs were highly prevalent among breast cancer patients, mainly due 
to safety issues, with ADRs significantly contributing to it. Findings highlight 
the need for larger multicentric and cohort studies, and integration of oncology 
pharmacy services to optimize pharmaceutical care and minimize DRPs.

Aggressive metastatic cancer remains a major clinical challenge due to the 
unclear underlying mechanisms and the limited treatment options available. 
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a reversible modification of RNA that is frequently 
altered in cancer, and inhibitors targeting regulators of this process have been 
shown to block tumorigenesis. A better understanding of the role of m6A 
modifications in driving metastatic properties could help reveal potential 
strategies to prevent and treat metastasis. In this study, we discovered loss of 
the m6A writer complex component ZC3H13 as a key regulator of metastatic 
progression. Co-loss of ZC3H13 together with RB1 and BRCA2 occurred in patients 
with metastatic prostate cancer. Functional in vitro and in vivo assays 
demonstrated that ZC3H13 loss changes m6A writer complex activity and target 
specificity, leading to decreased m6A methylation and increased stability of 
transcripts that promote migration and invasion. Treatment with FDA-approved m6A 
demethylase inhibitors effectively reduced the metastatic capabilities of 
ZC3H13-deficient cells. Together, these findings provide insights into how the 
m6A writer complex selectively methylates mRNAs, highlight the pathological 
consequences of altered writer complex composition in cancer, and reveal 
therapeutic avenues for patients with metastatic cancer. .

Luminal A is the most common subtype of breast cancer and has the best prognosis 
comparing to the others. The association between air pollution and survival of 
breast cancer have been reported but not specific to this subtype. We examined 
pollutant distributions over a decade in upper Northern Thailand, the area of 
high average annual particulate matter levels, and their impact on the mortality 
and recurrence risks of patients with luminal A breast cancer. Retrospective 
data of 1,305 luminal A breast cancer patients diagnosed from 2003 to 2018 were 
enrolled to this study. Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify 
factors associated with mortality and recurrence risks including all known risk 
factors and the annually averaged concentrations of pollutants. On multivariable 
analysis; metastatic stage (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) =10.50; 95% confidence 
interval (95%CI): 7.23-15.25), smoking history (aHR = 1.72; 95% CI: 1.14-2.60), 
and age ≥ 50 years old (aHR = 1.46; 95% CI: 1.13-1.90) were significant factors 
influencing mortality risk. Factors contributing to recurrence risk included 
metastatic stage (aHR) 4.96 (95% CI: 2.78-8.83) and exposure to the time-updated 
local concentration of PM10 > 55 µg/m3 (aHR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.16-2.45). Exposure 
to air pollutants is one of the detrimental factors affected to recurrence and 
mortality in luminal A subtype breast cancer.

Visceral pleural invasion (VPI) is a critical prognostic factor in early-stage 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), significantly affecting patient outcomes. 
Conventional computed tomography (CT) often fails to diagnose VPI accurately. 
This retrospective case-control study evaluated the efficacy of artificial 
intelligence (AI)-assisted three-dimensional (3D) CT imaging for predicting VPI 
in 556 patients with clinical stage 0-I NSCLC who underwent complete surgical 
resection. Patients with tumors > 4 cm, those not adjacent to the pleural 
surface, or with unsuitable CT scans were excluded. Radiological features were 
analyzed using AI software capable of 3D imaging and characterization of 
pulmonary nodules (Synapse Vincent System, Fujifilm Corporation, Japan). The 
dataset was divided into training (n = 408) and test (n = 148) cohorts. 
Stability selection identified ""Solid nodule"" and ""Pleural contact"" as key 
predictors. Logistic regression analysis using these features developed 
prediction models for VPI. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed 
that the area under the curve of the derived model was 0.831 and 0.782 in the 
training and test cohorts, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were 
0.739 and 0.657 in the test cohorts. These findings suggest that AI-enhanced 3D 
CT imaging significantly improved the preoperative prediction of VPI in NSCLC, 
supporting AI's integration into diagnostic processes.

Anti-HER2/Neu Antibody Therapy Inhibits HER2+ Breast Cancer by Blocking 
Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cell Activity.

Choi JH, Park S, Quan X, Park JH, Kang MJ, Lee YJ, Lee SS, Lim SN, Lee J, No TH, 
Jung SY, Kim KH, Lee JY, Lee WS, Bak B, Jeong CH, Kim IH.

BACKGROUND: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous 
population playing a key role in tumor-related immune suppression. MDSCs are 
immature cells with myeloid markers CD11b and Gr1 in mice and accumulate in 
tumor-bearing mice, including HER2/neu+ breast cancers. We previously reported 
that tumor regression by anti-neu antibody requires both innate and adaptive 
immunity. MDSCs inhibit both immunity types and are immunosuppressive, 
particularly for T cells. However, the effect of anti-neu antibody on MDSCs 
remains unclear.
METHODS: HER2+ TUBO tumor-bearing mice were treated with anti-neu antibody or 
control. MDSC populations were analyzed via flow cytometry, and 
immunosuppressive function by suppression assay. Tumors were analyzed using 
RT2-PCR array and RT-PCR for gene expression related to MDSC activation, 
migration, and function. Additional mice received combination therapy with 5-FU 
or Zoledronic acid to assess enhanced MDSC inhibition and changes in MDSC and 
TAM (tumor-associated macrophage) populations.
RESULTS: MDSCs decreased within 3 days after anti-neu antibody treatment in 
tumor and spleen, with tumor MDSCs declining one day earlier. Monocytic MDSCs 
were significantly reduced in both tissues (p>0.05). Anti-neu antibody also 
reduced MDSC immunosuppressive activity. Gene expression analysis showed 
decreased IL-1β, VEGF, and CX3CL1, linked to MDSC activation and migration. The 
immunosuppressive factor IDO (Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase) was also reduced. 
Combination therapy with 5-FU further suppressed MDSCs and TAMs, resulting in 
better tumor suppression than antibody alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Tumor suppression by anti-neu antibody is associated with MDSC 
reduction via inhibition of key MDSC-related factors. MDSCs may be a therapeutic 
target to enhance Herceptin efficacy in breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Most T1 gastric cancer (GC) harbor lymph node metastasis (LNM) at a 
rate of < 20%; however, owing to the difficulty in accurately diagnosing LNM 
preoperatively, many patients with T1 GC undergo unnecessary invasive radical 
gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy. In the present study, we established an 
epigenetic liquid biopsy assay for the preoperative diagnosis of LNM in T1 GC.
METHODS: A comprehensive biomarker discovery was performed by analyzing 
genome-wide DNA methylation profiling. We obtained 277 clinical specimens, 
including 177 surgical tissues and 100 pre-operative plasmas. DNA methylation 
biomarkers were trained and validated using quantitative methylation-specific 
polymerase chain reaction (qMSP) assays.
RESULTS: We identified six novel differentially methylated regions, including at 
least two differentially methylated CpG probes (|Delta-beta| > 0.12 and 
p < 0.05) within 100 bp, through genome-wide biomarker discovery. A DNA 
methylation panel was generated using qMSP assays in clinical tissue specimens, 
with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80. This panel was validated in an 
independent clinical cohort, and a combined model, which integrated the DNA 
methylation model with preoperative computed tomography -based findings, was 
established through multivariate logistic regression analyses (AUC: 0.84). 
Finally, we translated this model into a liquid biopsy, and this cell-free DNA 
(cfDNA) methylation model exhibited robust performance for LNM identification in 
T1 GC (AUC: 0.86) and allowed 44% of patients to avoid unnecessary invasive 
operations, without missing any LNM-positive patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully developed a cfDNA methylation signature-based 
liquid biopsy diagnostic assay that allows for robust and less-invasive LNM 
detection in patients with T1 GC.

PURPOSE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of 
cancer-related death and is characterized by poor survival rates and high 
recurrence after surgery. Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a proteoglycan highly expressed 
in HCC but absent in most normal tissue, making it an attractive diagnostic and 
therapeutic target. Here, we introduce a second-generation GPC3-targeted single 
domain antibody probe (ssHN3) bearing a positron emitting isotope fluorine-18 
(18F), ssHN3-Al[18F]F-RESCA (Al[18F]F-ssHN3), for HCC-selective positron 
emission tomography (PET) imaging. In addition, we show its use as a functional 
imaging agent following focal tumor thermal ablation.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Site-specific conjugation was used to synthesize the 
nanobody-based PET (immunoPET) probe, ssHN3-Al[18F]F-RESCA. Binding affinity was 
determined by biolayer interferometry, and in vivo PET/CT imaging and 
biodistribution studies were performed in three liver cancer models with varying 
GPC3 expression (HepG2 > Hep3B > Huh7). Mice inoculated with HepG2 orthotopic 
liver tumors were also imaged prior to and 1-week following thermal tumor 
ablation to assess response.
RESULTS: Our agent exhibited high purity (>98%), nanomolar affinity for GPC3, 
and tumor uptake corresponding to GPC3 expression on PET/CT and biodistribution 
studies. In orthotopic murine models of liver cancer, Al[18F]F-ssHN3 
successfully distinguished between total vs. subtotal thermal ablation, 
accurately identifying residual, viable disease.
CONCLUSION: We successfully designed, engineered, and tested a GPC3-targeted 
18F-labeled nanobody immunoPET agent, Al[18F]F-ssHN3, demonstrating that it can 
be used for same-day diagnostic imaging in murine models of liver cancer. 
Importantly, this agent could address the limitations of current imaging methods 
by detecting residual disease after thermal ablation and other locoregional 
therapies.

BACKGROUND: There are numerous controversies surrounding the diagnosis of matrix 
metalloproteinases (MMPs) in pancreatic cancer (PC). Consequently, this study 
conducts the first comprehensive meta-analysis evaluating the diagnostic 
performance of MMP family members in PC, highlight potential biomarkers, and 
investigate sources of heterogeneity.
METHOD: Articles on the MMP family and PC diagnosis were retrieved from PubMed 
and Web of Science. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed using sensitivity (SEN) and 
specificity (SPE). Threshold effects, heterogeneity (via meta-regression and 
subgroup analyses), and result robustness (via sensitivity analysis) were 
evaluated. Publication bias was examined using Deeks' funnel plot.
RESULT: This meta-analysis included 48 studies from 23 articles, covering 12 
types of MMP. The aggregated SEN, SPE, and area under the curve (AUC) for MMPs 
in diagnosing PC ranged from 0.61 to 0.76, 0.66 to 0.78, and 0.7273 to 0.8840, 
respectively. Meta-regression identified sample type as a major contributor to 
heterogeneity, with tissue-based MMPs showing markedly superior diagnostic 
performance compared to serum or plasma-based assays. Overall, MMPs showed 
potential diagnostic value, but their accuracy remains moderate and requires 
further validation in larger, well-designed studies.
CONCLUSION: MMPs represent potential candidates for PC diagnosis, but current 
evidence is insufficient for clinical application, requiring further prospective 
studies.

OBJECTIVES: Enhanced Recovery After Surgery aims to accelerate recovery, with 
length of stay as a key metric. This study assessed temporal trends in 
short-term outcomes within a maturing programme and identified factors 
associated with increased hospital stay.
METHODS: Data were prospectively collected for consecutive patients undergoing 
lung cancer resection following a 14-step protocol between 2013 and 2023. 
Primary outcome was length of stay. Secondary outcomes included 30-day 
mortality, morbidity, re-admission, and reoperation rates. Predictors of length 
of stay were analysed using linear regression.
RESULTS: We included 2192 patients; procedures included lobectomy (61%), wedge 
resection (23%), segmentectomy (10%), pneumonectomy (3.5%), and bi-lobectomy 
(2.7%), Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was used in 80% of cases. Median 
length of stay decreased from 5 to 4 days (p < 0.001), while protocol adherence 
increased from 10/14 to 12/14 (p = 0.01). In-hospital mortality (2.9% to 1.0%, 
p < 0.001) and major-morbidity (12.2% to 5.6%, p < 0.001) both declined. In 
multivariable linear regression, factors associated with longer stay included 
age (β = 0.17, CI 0.13-0.20, p < 0.001), higher American Society of 
Anesthesiologists score (β = 1.12, CI 1.04-2.2, p = 0.02), open surgery 
(β = 1.0, CI 0.17-2.2, p = 0.043), thoracoscopic-to-open converted surgery 
(β = 1.49, CI 0.96-1.9, p = 0.03) and intensive care (β = 3.4, CI 2.5-4.3, 
p < 0.001). Protective factors were early mobilisation (β=-0.90, CI -1.9-0.33, 
p = 0.005) and opioid avoidance (β=-0.72, CI -2.4-0.99, p = 0.038).
CONCLUSIONS: Sustained use of an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery programme was 
associated with shorter hospitalisation and reduced morbidity. Factors 
associated with length of stay can identify patients at risk of delayed recovery 
and prioritise elements for optimisation within recovery pathways.

Prostate cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men, with 
androgen receptor (AR) signaling playing a critical role in disease progression. 
Although CYP17A1 inhibitors effectively suppress androgen biosynthesis, 
treatment resistance frequently emerges through alternative AR activation 
pathways. Additionally, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is implicated in AR 
hypersensitivity and stabilization, further contributing to castration-resistant 
prostate cancer. Thus, targeting both CYP17A1 and HDAC6 presents a promising 
therapeutic approach. We developed MPT1A160, a dual CYP17A1/HDAC6 inhibitor, and 
evaluated its efficacy on prostate cancer cells and a xenograft model. CCK-8 
viability, wound healing, transwell migration, colony formation assays, and cell 
cycle analysis were performed. Immunoblotting quantified AR splice variant ARv7, 
AKR1C3, and KLK3 protein abundance, whereas Ki-67 and TUNEL staining assessed 
proliferation and apoptosis in tumor sections. Mice received DMSO, abiraterone, 
or MPT1A160 intraperitoneal injections twice per week. In silico analysis was 
used to assess oncogene expression and mutation frequencies in prostate cancer 
patient cohorts. MPT1A160 significantly suppressed prostate cancer cell 
viability with lower IC50 values and demonstrated superior tumor growth 
suppression in the 22Rv1 xenograft model compared to abiraterone. RNA-seq 
analysis revealed that MPT1A160 downregulated key oncogenic pathways and 
metabolic processes. Furthermore, several MPT1A160-suppressed genes exhibited 
high mutation frequencies in prostate cancer, suggesting their potential role in 
therapy resistance. MPT1A160 exhibits potent anti-tumor effects by targeting 
both androgen biosynthesis and epigenetic regulation, offering a novel dual 
inhibition strategy for overcoming treatment resistance in prostate cancer.

IMPORTANCE: Pain is a prevalent cancer-related symptom, but limited research 
investigates whether cannabis is an effective analgesic for cancer pain.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of medical and recreational cannabis 
dispensary availability on prescription opioid dispensing among commercially 
insured patients with cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used synthetic 
control to investigate the association of cannabis dispensary openings with pain 
medication dispensing among patients with cancer. Data were extracted from 
Optum's deidentified Clinformatics Data Mart database from January 1, 2007, to 
December 31, 2020. The study population included patients aged 18 to 64 years 
with a cancer diagnosis and at least 6 months of continuous enrollment. 
Associations were estimated by age, race and ethnicity, and sex. Data were 
analyzed between December 2024 and February 2025.
EXPOSURES: Exposures included indicators for whether a medical or recreational 
cannabis dispensary was open in each state-quarter.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The outcome measures for opioids prescriptions were 
(1) the rate of patients with a prescription per 10 000 patients, (2) the 
quarterly mean days' supply per prescription, and (3) the quarterly mean number 
of prescriptions per patient.
RESULTS: The study included a mean (SD) of 3.05 (0.86) million patients annually 
across the US (mean [SD] age, 43.7 [9.6] years; mean [SD] 59.0% [0.32%] female). 
Medical cannabis dispensary openings were associated with significant reductions 
in all opioid outcomes. The rate of patients with cancer with opioid 
prescriptions changed by -41.07 per 10 000 (95% CI, -54.78 to -27.36 per 10 000; 
P < .001), the quarterly mean days' supply by -2.54 days (95% CI, -3.16 to -1.92 
days; P < .001), and the mean number of prescriptions per patient by -0.099 (95% 
CI, -0.121 to -0.077; P < .001). Recreational dispensary openings were also 
associated with reductions in opioid outcomes, though estimated treatment 
effects were smaller. The rate of prescriptions changed by -20.63 per 10 000 
(95% CI, -35.35 to -5.91 per 10 000; P = .049), the mean daily supply by -1.09 
days supplied per prescription (95% CI, -1.72 to -0.46 days; P = .04), and the 
mean number of prescriptions per patient by -0.097 (95% CI, -0.134 to -0.060; 
P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study's findings indicate cannabis may be a 
substitute for opioids in the management of cancer-related pain. However, 
further research directly observing cannabis use is needed to evaluate the 
efficacy of cannabis as a treatment for cancer-related pain.

IMPORTANCE: Despite guidelines and recommendations, cancer screening remains low 
and variable across geographic and sociodemographic groups, contributing to 
persisting disparities.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze geographic and temporal patterns of county-level cancer 
screening prevalence for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer over a 22-year 
period in the US and examine sociodemographic factors associated with screening 
clusters.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used an ecological 
panel design using county-level screening prevalence as the unit of analysis. 
Data were collected from US mainland counties (ie, excluding Alaska, Hawaii, and 
Puerto Rico) from 1997 to 2019, with prevalence estimated over 3- to 5-year 
periods. Data were analyzed from 2024 to 2025.
EXPOSURES: County-level screening prevalence was estimated from the Behavioral 
Risk Factor Surveillance System and the National Health Interview Survey from 
1997 to 2019. Socioeconomic and demographic characteristics were estimated from 
the 2000 US Census and linked with county and geographic clusters of screening.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Spatial autocorrelation analyses, including Global 
Moran I and bivariate local indicator of spatial autocorrelation, were conducted 
to assess geographic clustering of county-level cancer screening prevalence over 
time. A queen contiguity matrix defined neighboring counties, and permutation 
tests evaluated statistical significance.
RESULTS: Data from 3142 counties were assessed. Spatial analyses of mammography, 
Papanicolaou test, and colorectal cancer screening in the contiguous US from 
1997 to 2019 revealed consistent geographic clustering, with high screening 
prevalence in the Northeast and lower prevalence in the Southwest. Spatial 
autocorrelation, measured by Global Moran I, declined over time. For example, 
the distribution of mammography screening became 83% more uniform in more recent 
years (eg, Moran I = 0.57 in 1997-1999 vs Moran I = 0.10 in 2017-2019). 
Similarly, Papanicolaou test screening became more uniform in more recent years 
(eg, Moran I = 0.44 in 1997-1999 vs Moran I = 0.07 in 2017-2019). Bivariate 
local indicator of spatial autocorrelation analyses identified clusters of 
persistently high and low screening, with sociodemographic characteristics 
associated with clusters that changed from low to high. For example, for both 
Papanicolaou test and mammography, areas that changed from low to high were more 
likely to be low socioeconomic status, suggesting improvements in disadvantaged 
areas in 2017 to 2019 vs 1997 to 1999. Disadvantaged areas were most likely to 
experienced persistently low screening, particularly for breast or colorectal 
cancer.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that despite increasing 
screening overall, which led to reduced geographic variation in screening, local 
clusters of high and low screening persisted in the Northeast and Southwest US, 
respectively. Future studies could incorporate county-level health care access 
characteristics to explain why areas of low screening did not catch up to 
optimize cancer screening practices.

IMPORTANCE: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is often diagnosed late, 
resulting in a dismal survival. Only 1 in 5 patients is eligible for potentially 
curative surgery. Although earlier detection of PDAC could significantly improve 
prognosis, population-wide screening is not currently feasible. Individuals at 
high risk, such as those with new-onset diabetes, among whom approximately 10% 
have type 3c diabetes (T3cD) and 1% have undiagnosed PDAC, could represent a 
target population for PDAC screening.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of 3 PDAC screening strategies in 
new-onset diabetes with the standard of care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: For this economic evaluation, a Markov 
state-transition decision model was developed to assess the downstaging benefits 
associated with screening policies over a 5-year period. The model allowed for 
diagnosis of resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced, or metastatic 
disease. Model parameters were subject to 1-way and multiway sensitivity 
analyses. Mean treatment costs were extracted from the UK National Healthcare 
Service cost-collection data (2021-2022), and the screening strategies were 
applied to a simulated cohort of individuals aged 50 years or older with 
new-onset diabetes in the UK. Analyses were performed from August 2024 to 
January 2025.
EXPOSURES: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma screening strategies included the 
use of a T3cD biomarker, a cancer-specific biomarker, or a combination of a T3cD 
biomarker followed by a cancer-specific test in the population with new-onset 
diabetes. Biomarker cohorts were compared with the standard-of-care cohort 
undergoing diagnostic investigations on the development of clinical symptoms.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Per-person incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) and net benefits were calculated, allowing for a willingness-to-pay 
threshold per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of £30 000 (US $40 156), as 
accepted by the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.
RESULTS: Among individuals aged 50 years or older with new-onset diabetes, 
neither the cancer-specific nor T3cD biomarker strategy was cost-effective 
compared with the standard of care, with an ICER per QALY of £71 906 (US 
$96 249) for the cancer-specific biomarker test and an ICER per QALY of £46 371 
(US $62 070) for the T3cD biomarker strategy. Sequential use of a T3cD biomarker 
and a cancer-specific biomarker approached cost-effectiveness (ICER per QALY, 
£34 223 [US $45 809]), with 2.4 scans performed to detect 1 PDAC case among 
200 000 people with new-onset diabetes. Sensitivity analyses highlighted 
biomarker specificity as a critical determinant of cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this economic evaluation of early PDAC detection 
among individuals with new-onset diabetes, the application of a primary T3cD 
biomarker followed by a secondary PDAC-specific test was more cost-effective 
than the sole use of either biomarker, although no strategy was cost-effective 
compared with standard of care. These findings can be used to inform 
biomarker-associated early detection strategies for PDAC.

Androgen receptor (AR) antagonists play a pivotal role in the treatment of 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, the reactivation of AR 
signaling during antiandrogen therapy remains a major factor contributing to 
resistance against currently used clinical antagonists. As a result, strategies 
aimed at degrading the AR protein have garnered substantial attention for CRPC 
therapy. In this study, we first established a high-throughput screening (HTS) 
model for AR degraders based on Cell-ELISA technology. Using this model to 
screen our in-house chemical database, we identified a novel AR degrader, ZC9. 
Functional evaluations demonstrated that ZC9 exhibits significant inhibitory 
activity against CRPC cell proliferation and effectively downregulates AR 
protein levels. Mechanistic studies revealed that ZC9 directly binds to AR and 
inhibits dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced nuclear translocation of AR. 
Furthermore, ZC9 promotes AR degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system 
(UPS) and suppresses AR transcriptional activity. Collectively, these findings 
highlight ZC9 as a promising lead compound for the treatment of CRPC.

Bone Metastatic Progression of Prostate Cancer is Regulated by TRIM28-LDHA 
Mediated Metabolism.

Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), an advanced stage of prostate 
cancer (PCa), often leads to fatal bone metastasis. The vast majority of PCa 
patients who present with bone metastases suffer from bone lesions and other 
complications. Androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors, while improved, lack curative 
efficacy, necessitating an urgent demand for the development of innovative 
therapeutic strategies. TRIM28, also known as KAP1, is a transcription factor 
regulated by site-specific phosphorylation. Our recent study demonstrated that 
RSK1 is the protein kinase that directly phosphorylates TRIM28 at S473; as such, 
pS473-TRIM28 promotes the transcriptional activation of its gene targets. In 
this study, we reveal that TRIM28 S473 phosphorylation is readily detected in 
CRPC bone metastases, which is consistent with the previous report that RSK 
kinase is activated in PCa bone metastases. Using bioinformatic and genomic 
analysis, we uncovered that lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is a novel 
TRIM28-induced gene in bone metastatic PCa. TRIM28 promotes the transcriptional 
activation of LDHA in a pS473-TRIM28 dependent manner. As such, TRIM28 is 
involved in LDH-related activities including lactate production and glycolysis. 
We also demonstrate that the TRIM28-LDHA axis is required for prostate tumor 
progression using an orthotopic bone injection model. Lastly, the application of 
an LDH inhibitor mitigates PCa development in bone. In summary, our study 
reveals an important role of the TRIM28-LDHA axis in PCa progression in bone, 
which may be targeted to mitigate the disease in the metastasis stage. 
Implications: TRIM28 upregulates LDHA and glycolysis, propelling prostate tumors 
in bone; pharmacologic LDH blockade mitigates disease.

Autophagy plays a dual role in cancer, supporting tumor cell survival while 
influencing immune escape, which can limit the efficacy of current 
immunotherapies. Modulating autophagy in tumor or immune cells offers a 
promising strategy to overcome resistance and enhance antitumor immunity. 
However, a deeper mechanistic understanding of how autophagy shapes the tumor 
immune landscape is essential to identify selective therapeutic targets, as 
reviewed here. In this review, we also present the emerging approaches, 
including tumor-specific inhibitors, nanoparticles, and genetic tools, that aim 
to precisely modulate autophagy while preserving immune function. Integrating 
insights from immuno-oncology and cellular metabolism may accelerate the 
development of combinatorial strategies and facilitate clinical translation of 
autophagy-targeted immunotherapies.

Prostate cancer remains a major global health challenge, driving the need for 
innovative therapies. Nisin, an antimicrobial peptide from Lactobacillus lactis, 
has shown anticancer effects in various malignancies, yet its impact on prostate 
cancer and the prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) 
remains unstudied. This research aimed to investigate nisin's anticancer 
properties in prostate cancer cells, focusing on PCA3 lncRNA, apoptosis, and 
cell cycle pathways. Human prostate adenocarcinoma (LNCaP) and normal human 
foreskin fibroblast (HFF2) cells were treated with nisin. Cell viability was 
measured using MTT assays, while apoptosis and cell cycle progression were 
assessed via flow cytometry. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) evaluated gene expression 
of PCA3 lncRNA, apoptosis-related genes, cell cycle regulators, and 
PCA3-associated microRNAs and mRNAs. In-silico analysis of TCGA-PRAD data 
explored PCA3's regulatory network. Nisin selectively reduced LNCaP cell 
viability (IC₅₀: 370.7 μM at 24 h, 177.2 μM at 48 h) compared to HFF2 cells 
(IC₅₀: 887.8 μM at 24 h, 406.5 μM at 48 h). It induced time-dependent apoptosis 
and G1 phase cell cycle arrest in LNCaP cells. Nisin downregulated PCA3 lncRNA 
expression, upregulated miR-132-3p and miR-1261, and altered SREBP1 and PRKD3 
gene expression, modulating the PCA3 regulatory network. This study is the first 
to explore nisin's anticancer effects in prostate cancer, uniquely targeting 
PCA3 lncRNA and its downstream regulatory pathways. Nisin demonstrates potent 
anticancer effects in prostate cancer cells by inducing apoptosis, arresting 
cell cycle progression, and modulating the PCA3 lncRNA network, suggesting its 
potential as a novel therapeutic agent.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have validated the oncologic safety of minimally 
invasive surgery (MIS) for advanced gastric cancer, but the feasibility of 
applying MIS to treat Borrmann type IV gastric cancer remains unclear. Given its 
distinct clinicopathological features, poor prognosis, and technical 
complexities in surgery, further investigation is needed. This study aimed to 
compare the surgical and oncological outcomes between open surgery and MIS in 
patients with Borrmann type IV gastric cancer.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 1025 patients who underwent open 
(n = 888) or minimally invasive (n = 137) gastrectomy for Borrmann type IV 
gastric cancer between 2003 and 2021. Propensity score matching was performed to 
balance baseline characteristics, and short- and long-term outcomes were 
compared between the matched groups.
RESULTS: After propensity score matching, each group included 112 matched 
patients. The MIS group had longer operative times (p < 0.001) but shorter 
hospital stays (p < 0.001) than the open surgery group. Other perioperative 
outcomes showed no significant differences. Overall and recurrence-free survival 
were comparable between the two groups (p = 0.741 and p = 0.707, respectively). 
Adjusted hazard ratios for death and recurrence following MIS compared with open 
surgery were 1.20 (95% confidence interval 0.78-1.85, p = 0.396) and 1.22 (95% 
confidence interval 0.83-1.79, p = 0.308), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that MIS for Borrmann type IV gastric cancer 
may offer long-term oncologic outcomes comparable to those with open surgery 
while preserving the inherent benefits of MIS.

BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Epidemiological evidence demonstrates associations 
between gut microbial dysbiosis and cervical cancer, though causal inference 
remains limited by potential confounding.
STUDY DESIGN: A meta-analysis of the largest available genome-wide association 
study (GWAS) meta-analysis using the MiBioGen consortium (n = 14,306 
individuals; 8,107,040 SNPs analyzed) was conducted for the summary statistics 
of the gut microbiome. A two-sample Mendelian randomization study was performed 
using the statistics of cervical cancer from BioBank Japan (BBJ) and the 
European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) GWAS Catalog. The causal relationship 
between the gut microbiome and cervical cancer was examined using inverse 
variance weighting, maximum likelihood, MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted 
model, and MR-PRESSO methods. The Cochran Q statistic was used to quantify the 
heterogeneity of the instrumental variables.
STUDY RESULTS: The odds ratio (OR) values obtained by the IVW method indicate 
that the consistent microbial communities in the validation results from two 
different cervical cancer datasets are: Actinomyces (BBJ OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 
0.29-0.92, P < 0.05), (EBI OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.29-0.87, P < 0.05) It has a 
protective effect on the occurrence of cervical cancer, Lachnospiraceae UCG001 
(BBJ OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.11-3.58, P < 0.05), ( EBI OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 
1.16-3.13, P < 0.05) It has a promoting risk effect on the occurrence of 
cervical cancer, and there is no significant heterogeneity or horizontal 
pleiotropy.
CONCLUSIONS: Both datasets consistently showed that Actinomyces was protective 
against cervical cancer (BBJ OR = 0.52; EBI OR = 0.55), while Lachnospiraceae 
UCG001 increased risk (BBJ OR = 2.00; EBI OR = 1.91), with no evidence of 
heterogeneity or pleiotropy in these robust MR analyses.

BACKGROUND: Laryngeal cancer is a leading global cause of cancer-related 
mortality. The regulatory interplay between dysregulated microRNA-761 (miR-761) 
and oncogenic signaling pathways in laryngeal carcinogenesis has not been fully 
elucidated‌.
METHODS: This study explored the interaction between miR-761 and programmed cell 
death protein 4 (PDCD4) through dual-luciferase assay, cell proliferation and 
migration assays, and xenograft models.
RESULTS: MiR-761 was significantly upregulated in laryngeal cancer tissues and 
cell lines, inversely correlating with PDCD4 downregulation. Computational 
predictions and dual-luciferase assays confirmed that miR-761 targets the 3'-UTR 
of PDCD4, inhibiting its transcription. Functional studies showed that miR-761 
knockdown restored PDCD4 expression, increasing apoptosis and reducing 
proliferation and migration. Conversely, miR-761 overexpression enhanced these 
capacities in PDCD4-low cancer cells, effects reversed by PDCD4 upregulation. In 
vivo xenograft models demonstrated that miR-761 inhibition reduced tumor growth, 
with increased PDCD4 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: MiR-761 is a critical regulator of PDCD4, modulating laryngeal 
cancer progression through apoptosis inhibition and pro-metastatic signaling. 
Targeting the miR-761/PDCD4 axis offers a promising therapeutic strategy for 
laryngeal cancer management.

Angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and is 
closely intertwined with the tumor microenvironment (TME) and immune 
infiltration. This study aimed to identify key angiogenesis-related genes (ARGs) 
with prognostic significance in colorectal cancer using integrative 
bioinformatics and single-cell transcriptomic analysis. 526 common 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were extracted from three Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) datasets and intersected with ARGs from MSigDB, resulting in 
identification of 18 candidate genes. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network was constructed using the STRING database, followed by the extraction of 
10 hub genes using the Cytoscape software. Five hub genes (MMP14, CXCL12, SPP1, 
TIMP1, and VCAN) showed significant association with poor overall survival. 
Expression analysis using UALCAN revealed significant upregulation of these 
genes, and their correlation with tumor-stage-specific expression. Utilizing the 
Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) database immune infiltration analysis 
was carried out to explore the immune landscape. Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub2 
(TISCH2), Tumor Immunotherapy Gene Expression Resource (TIGER), IMMUcan scDB and 
single-cell TIME (scTIME) databases revealed the expression of these hub genes 
in key TME components including fibroblasts, macrophages, and endothelial cells, 
and their link to immunosuppressive landscapes. Additionally, we discovered a 
substantial positive correlation between the expression of these hub genes and 
immune infiltration cells, such as macrophages, myofibroblasts and regulatory T 
cells (Treg). Notably, CXCL12 and SPP1 were implicated in immune cell 
recruitment, while TIMP1 and MMP14 were associated with ECM remodeling and 
myeloid cell differentiation. This study highlights the relevance of ARGs in 
tumor progression, prognosis and immune infiltration in CRC, offering potential 
targets for novel therapeutic interventions.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer pathogenesis involves complex metabolic dysregulation, 
yet causal biomarkers remain elusive. This study aimed to assess causal effects 
of 1,400 human plasma metabolites on breast cancer (BC) risk using a two-sample 
Mendelian randomization (MR) framework.
METHODS: We employed a rigorous two-sample Mendelian randomization framework 
with tiered quality control (Bonferroni correction, sensitivity analyses, 
meta-analyses) to investigate causal metabolite-BC associations. Colocalization 
(PPH4 > 0.80) and phenome-wide MR (2,099 FinnGen phenotypes) validated 
mechanistic specificity and clinical safety profiles.
RESULTS: Five genetically determined plasma metabolites were identified as the 
potential causal biomarkers for BC risk: 3,5-dichloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid 
(odds ratio [OR]: 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-0.94; p < 0.001), 
carnitine C14 (OR: 0.72; 95% CI 0.64-0.83; p < 0.001) and epiandrosterone 
sulfate (OR: 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.06; p < 0.001), Glyco-beta-muricholate (OR: 
0.95; 95% CI 0.93-0.97; p < 0.001), N4-acetylcytidine (OR: 0.93; 95% CI 
0.91-0.96; p < 0.001). Colocalization analysis showed strong evidence for 
Glyco - beta - muricholate and Epiandrosterone sulfate with BC risk (PPH4 = 1). 
PheWAS-MR revealed metabolite-specific safety profiles, with carnitine C14 
showing broadest phenotypic associations (96 outcomes).
CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes carnitine C14 as a novel protective 
biomarker and epiandrosterone sulfate as a risk biomarker for breast cancer, 
with colocalization evidence supporting their therapeutic targeting. The 
metabolic risk profile provides a foundation for precision prevention 
strategies.

Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan and is essential 
in biomedical research due to its distinct properties, compatibility with 
biological tissues, and functions in preserving tissue hydration, lubrication, 
and the integrity of the extracellular matrix, a significance recognized since 
1934. Its capability to develop hydrogels and react to environmental factors has 
provided it a strong factor for drug delivery, tissue engineering, and wound 
healing uses. This review emphasizes the various biomedical uses of HA-based 
materials, focusing on their functions in cancer treatment, wound healing, 
inflammation control, antibacterial properties, and antioxidant functions. In 
cancer treatment, HA-functionalized nanoparticles improve the targeted drug 
delivery by using the additional presence of CD44 receptors in cancer cells. 
HA-based hydrogels have demonstrated significant potential in advancing wound 
healing by regulating inflammatory responses, enhancing angiogenesis, and 
participating in the extracellular matrix remodeling. Moreover, HA's 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant characteristics have been utilized in the 
treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions including osteoarthritis and 
inflammatory bowel disease. The recent developments in HA-based materials have 
also demonstrated their promise in antibacterial applications, diabetes control, 
and in treating cardiovascular and neurological conditions. The advancement of 
HA-based intelligent drug delivery systems and bioactive scaffolds is ongoing, 
presenting new treatment options for tissue repair and disease management. This 
review emphasizes the diverse functions of HA in both health and disease, 
showcasing its capacity to tackle various medical issues through cutting-edge 
biomedical applications.

The c-Met (mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor) receptor tyrosine kinase, 
upon activation by its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), plays an 
important role in regulating cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, 
and metastasis. Dysregulation of c-Met signaling, including overexpression, gene 
amplification, and mutations, is associated with the development and progression 
of various cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric cancer, 
and hepatocellular carcinoma. This review explores the oncogenic mechanisms 
involving c-Met altered cancers, highlighting how dysregulated c-Met signaling 
promotes tumor growth and metastasis. This work offers a detailed analysis of 
c-Met expression patterns in different tissues and examines the frequency of 
c-Met alterations across various cancer types. Advancements in molecular 
diagnostics have significantly improved the clinical detection of c-Met 
alterations, facilitating the precise identification of patients eligible for 
c-Met-targeted therapies. While initial clinical trials of c-Met inhibitors 
demonstrated promising outcomes, the emergence of resistance remains a major 
hurdle. This review also covers the mechanisms contributing to resistance, such 
as secondary mutations, activation of alternative signaling pathways, and tumor 
cell phenotypic changes. Additionally, it examines current therapeutic 
approaches targeting c-Met, including small molecule inhibitors, monoclonal 
antibodies, and combination therapies designed to overcome resistance. The 
discussion extends to future challenges in c-Met inhibition, highlighting the 
need for innovative therapeutic strategies and combination regimens to enhance 
efficacy and mitigate resistance and thus the review emphasizes the 
transformative potential of c-Met-targeted therapies in advancing cancer 
treatment.

Differentiation grade of colorectal cancers (CRC) is histologically defined by 
the proportion of the tumour which retains the glandular architecture of the 
normal colon. Poorly differentiated CRCs display loss of glandular architecture 
and canonical markers of colonic differentiation and are associated with 
increased metastatic capacity and poorer prognosis. It is currently unclear 
whether poorly differentiated cells within a heterogeneous primary tumour are 
more likely to establish metastases and if this cellular trait is conserved in 
the secondary tumours, or whether metastasis is largely stochastic, with most 
cells in the primary tumour harboring metastatic potential. To explore this, we 
examined the concordance in histological grade, expression of markers of colonic 
differentiation, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in 67 matched 
primary and metastatic CRCs. Tumour differentiation grade was scored 
categorically, and expression of differentiation and EMT markers were scored as 
continuous variables. In matched primary-metastatic pairs, tumour grade was 
concordant in 88% of cases (59/67 pairs), irrespective of the site of 
metastasis. In tumour pairs with discordant grade (n = 8), tumour grade was 
higher in the metastatic lesion in 6/8 (75%) cases. Consistent with the 
histological concordance, expression of the key driver of colonic 
differentiation (CDX2); colonic lineage-specific markers (VIL1, MUC2, SYN and 
CHG); and the markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (E-Cadherin and 
Vimentin) were highly concordant between matched primary and metastatic lesions. 
Finally, no staining of the squamous lineage marker Cytokeratin5/6 was observed 
in either primary or metastatic tumours. Tumour grade assessed histologically or 
using expression of markers of colonic differentiation or epithelial to 
mesenchymal transition was largely concordant between primary and metastatic 
CRC. These findings complement previously reported genomic similarities between 
primary and metastatic lesions and demonstrate that the histological grade of a 
primary tumour can in most cases inform the differentiation grade of associated 
metastatic lesions.

The sialylated Lewis antigens sLea and sLex are terminal glycans that are 
crucial for adhesive and signalling functions during cancer metastasis. As high 
affinity ligands for E-, P-, and L-selectins, these epitopes allow tumor cells 
to arrest, evade immune cells and extravasate in the vascular microenvironment, 
mimicking leukocyte trafficking. This review provides a detailed analysis of 
sLea/x biosynthesis, structure, function and their role in metastatic 
progression. We focus on the differential roles of glycoprotein versus 
glycolipid associated sLea/x, their glycosyltransferase mediated synthesis and 
the spatial trafficking mechanisms that govern their surface expression. We also 
highlight the carrier scaffolds and glyco-enzyme hierarchies that present the 
ligand across different cancers, mucins, integrins and glycosphingolipids. A 
section is dedicated to how exosome bound sLea/x primes pre-metastatic niche and 
immune modulation, a new perspective on glycan mediated systemic signaling. We 
also compile validated tumor specific profiles of sLea/x across several cancer 
types, linking structural expression to metastatic phenotypes. Additionally, we 
discuss emerging strategies targeting sLea/x pathways from glycosylation 
inhibitors to selectin blocking therapeutics and the translational challenges 
and opportunities. Overall, this synthesis shows the importance of sLea and sLex 
in metastasis and lays the foundation for their use as biomarkers and 
therapeutic targets in precision oncology.

BACKGROUND: Head and neck cancer (HNC) caused substantial morbidity and 
mortality. Despite advances in treatment modalities, the evolving burden and 
risk factor profiles of head and neck cancer may contribute to escalating health 
inequalities. The primary objective of this study is to quantitatively evaluate 
the degree of SDI-related health inequalities in head and neck cancer and to 
analyze the evolution of these health inequality trends between 1992 and 2021.
METHODS: Using Global Burden of Disease 2021 data, we extracted 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), DALY rates and age-standardized DALY 
rates (ASDR) for HNC and its five subtypes across 204 countries/territories 
(1992-2021). Temporal trends stratified by sex and Sociodemographic Index (SDI) 
levels were assessed using estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) modeling. 
Socioeconomic health inequalities were further measured through complementary 
metrics: the Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and Concentration Index (CIX).
RESULTS: From 1992 to 2021, the global ASDR for HNC declined from 228.1 to 
179.37 per 100,000 (EAPC: -0.95, 95% CI: -1.05 to -0.84). The low-middle SDI 
region exhibited the highest ASDR (294.46 per 100,000), while the high SDI 
region recorded the lowest ASDR (107.97 per 100,000). The CIX indicated a 
progressive deterioration, decreasing from - 0.11 (95% CI: -0.15 to -0.08). in 
1992 to -0.16 (95% CI: -0.22 to -0.11) in 2021. The inequality was particularly 
pronounced among females, where CIX values decreased from - 0.21 (95% CI: -0.25 
to -0.17) to -0.24 (95% CI: -0.30 to -0.17) during the same period, consistently 
remaining at a relatively high level.
CONCLUSION: The persistent and widening inequalities in HNC, particularly those 
affecting females and low SDI regions, call for equitable global governance. 
particularly affecting females and low-SDI regions, necessitate equitable global 
governance. Addressing this issue necessitates the establishment of robust data 
systems, the implementation of gender- and region-specific interventions, the 
bridging of technological and resource gaps, and enhanced cross-sectoral 
collaboration. This integrated approach is essential for disrupting the 
low-SDI/high-burden cycle and promoting health equity as a fundamental right.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer (OC) remains among the deadliest cancers in women 
worldwide. Anoikis, a critical process that prevents the establishment of 
detached cells in non-native sites, is closely associated with cancer cell 
aggressiveness and poor patient outcomes. Despite its significance, research 
into the prognostic impact of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in OC remains scant.
METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was adopted to analyze anoikis 
activity. We used 41 ARGs across distinct cell types for this analysis. The 
genomic and clinicopathological data was sourced from GSE26712 project (training 
cohort) and TCGA-OV project (independent validation set), respectively. Cox 
regression and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
technique were utilized to develop an anoikis-related risk score (ANRS) for 
prognosis evaluation. Additionally, the correlation between ANRS and tumor 
microenvironment (TME) characteristics was explored. Functional experiments were 
conducted to elucidate the molecular role of the key gene AP1S2 in OC.
RESULTS: Survival analyses in both cohorts categorized OC patients into two 
groups based on the median ANRS. The high-ANRS category exhibited evidently 
worse survival outcomes. Our findings highlighted a strong link between ARGs and 
TME characteristics, particularly the stromal components, at both bulk and 
single-cell transcriptomic levels. This underscores the complex interplay 
between cancer progression and the tumor-promoting stroma. Additionally, AP1S2 
knockdown markedly reduced the proliferative and aggressive capabilities of OC 
cells.
CONCLUSION: The ANRS-derived prognostic tool offers substantial promise for 
advancing our understanding of OC progression and assisting gynecologists in 
developing effective treatment strategies for women suffering from this 
malignancy.

PURPOSE: Pleural lavage cytology (PLC) is a recognized prognostic marker in 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, the impact of serial intraoperative 
changes remains unclear.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 439 patients who underwent curative NSCLC 
resection. PLC was performed at three intraoperative points: after thoracotomy 
(pre-PLC), after lung resection, and after lavage at chest closure (post-PLC). 
Associations between recurrence-free survival (RFS) and pleural dissemination 
were evaluated by a Kaplan-Meier analysis and Fine and Gray competing risks 
regression.
RESULTS: Forty-one patients had at least one positive PLC result. RFS was the 
lowest in pre-PLC( +)/post-PLC( +) (n = 10), intermediate in 
pre-PLC(-)/post-PLC( +) (n = 11), and best in post-PLC( -) (n = 20). 
Importantly, post-PLC( -) patients included 13 patients with pre-PLC positivity, 
yet their RFS matched that of consistently negative cases (n = 398). The 
cumulative incidence of pleural dissemination exhibited a similar pattern. In a 
multivariate analysis, post-PLC positivity, but not pre-PLC positivity, 
independently predicted poor RFS (hazard ratio, 3.06; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Post-PLC, but not pre-PLC, provides decisive prognostic information 
for recurrence and pleural dissemination, likely reflecting residual 
lavage-resistant tumor clusters. Importantly, combining pre- and post-PLC 
results refines risk stratification and identifies the poorest-outcome subgroup 
that may benefit from adjuvant therapy.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (tCAFs) promote non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
progression through cargo exchange with cancer cells. Mucin 1 (MUC1) initiates 
actin-mediated cytoskeleton protrusion movement to promote mitochondrial 
transfer. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether MUC1 regulates 
mitochondrial transfer from tCAFs to NSCLC cells. The results showed that lung 
cancer patients with high MUC1 expression had a poor prognosis, and MUC1 protein 
was significantly enriched in exosomes (EXOs) derived from tCAFs. A549 cells 
were treated with conditioned medium (CM) or EXOs derived from tCAFs or 
co-cultured with tCAFs in contact or non-contact ways. Both CM and EXOs promoted 
the proliferation and invasion and inhibited apoptosis in A549 cells, while 
MUC1-interfered EXOs inhibited A549 cell proliferation and invasion and induced 
apoptosis. Meanwhile, non-contact co-culture of tCAFs and A549 cells promoted 
proliferation, invasion, and colony formation of A549 cells, and contact 
co-culture further promoted malignant phenotype of A549 cells and enhanced 
mitochondrial function in A549 cells. Mechanism studies revealed that MUC1 
promotes mitochondrial transfer from tCAFs to A549 cells by interacting with 
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1), promoting malignant phenotype of A549 
cells. ICAM1 interference counteracted the effect of EXO protein MUC1 on A549 
cells. Finally, lung cancer xenograft tumor models were constructed and found 
that EXO protein MUC1 promoted lung cancer tumor growth in vivo, while ICAM1 
interference inhibited tumor growth. In conclusion, MUC1 is enriched in EXOs 
derived from tCAFs and promotes NSCLC progression by regulating ICAM1-mediated 
mitochondria transfer from tCAFs to cancer cells.

[Treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer].

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is among the most common and lethal 
malignancies worldwide, representing a particular oncological challenge due to 
its frequent diagnosis at an advanced, metastatic stage. Histopathologically, 
NSCLC is broadly classified into adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. 
This distinction-along with programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression 
and molecular pathology-guides therapeutic decision-making. At advanced stages, 
treatment options include not only traditional platinum-based chemotherapy but 
also immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors. Over the past decade, the rapid 
identification of actionable driver mutations has firmly established targeted 
therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors as a cornerstone of treatment, 
significantly improving the historically poor overall survival.

Publisher: Das nichtkleinzellige Lungenkarzinom („non-small cell lung cancer“ 
[NSCLC]) stellt eine der häufigsten und tödlichsten Krebserkrankungen weltweit 
dar und ist insbesondere durch die oftmals späte Diagnosestellung im bereits 
metastasierten Stadium eine onkologische Herausforderung. Histopathologisch 
unterscheidet man vor allem Adeno- und Plattenepithelkarzinome, deren 
Differenzierung neben der PD-L1-Expression (programmed cell death-ligand 1 
[PD-L1]) und den molekularpathologischen Eigenschaften den Therapiepfad 
bestimmt. Für die Behandlung im fortgeschrittenen Stadium steht neben der 
klassischen platinbasierten Chemotherapie die Immuntherapie mit 
Checkpointinhibitoren zur Verfügung. Im letzten Jahrzehnt hat sich durch die 
rasante Entwicklung hinsichtlich behandelbarer Treiberalterationen zudem die 
zielgerichtete Therapie mit Tyrosinkinaseinhibitoren als fester Bestandteil der 
Therapie etabliert und das historisch schlechte Gesamtüberleben verbessert.

Mutation analyses are increasingly performed on tumor specimens to determine 
treatment eligibility and screen for genetic cancer predisposition. Sufficient 
tumor cell percentages and DNA concentrations are required to perform reliable 
mutation analyses, but even when these requirements are met, results do not 
always meet reliability standards. This study investigated potential factors 
associated with successful mutation analyses using single-molecule molecular 
inversion probe (smMIP)-based next generation sequencing (NGS) technology for 
the detection of BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants (PVs) in epithelial ovarian cancer. 
Data of a consecutive series of smMIP analyses performed between 2018 and 2022 
in clinical practice were collected from hospital databases, including data of 
Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) analyses if performed 
alongside the smMIP analysis. Data included analysis outcome (successful/not 
successful), storage time, histotype, FIGO stage, center of block preparation, 
material type, tumor cell percentage, and receival of chemotherapy. Successful 
analyses were defined as analyses providing test results deemed adequate for 
clinical decision-making, based on the judgement of a clinical scientist in 
molecular pathology. A minimum threshold of 100 × coverage for at least 97% of 
the regions of interest was applied. In total, 88.3% (401/454) of smMIP analyses 
and 78.4% (356/453) of MLPA analyses were successful. A time interval 
of ≤ 48 days between tumor specimen collection and analysis was significantly 
associated with successful smMIP and MLPA analyses (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.07-3.93, 
p = 0.030; OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.19-2.98, p = 0.007; respectively). Based on these 
observations, we recommend performing the analyses directly after specimen 
collection to enhance efficiency and reduce costs.

PURPOSE: Digital self-management interventions can aid cancer survivors with 
psychosocial, emotional, physical, and lifestyle support needs, but usage is 
relatively low due to a lack of awareness and reimbursement. Additionally, there 
are concerns about e-health exacerbating existing health disparities. To enhance 
the uptake of digital self-management interventions, the OncoAppstore was 
launched-a landing page on a well-known Dutch platform that offers cancer 
survivors credits to purchase these interventions. It is unknown to what extent 
the nature of the OncoAppstore will influence uptake and appeal to a diverse 
group of cancer survivors. The current study therefore aimed to explore 
sociodemographic, clinical, income, and healthcare usage factors associated with 
its early uptake among survivors.
METHODS: OncoAppstore usage data were combined with nationwide registry data 
from Statistics Netherlands, the Netherlands Cancer Registry, and Dutch Hospital 
Data. Data were analysed descriptively, and differences between OncoAppstore 
users and non-users were statistically tested using chi-square tests, Fisher's 
exact tests, and Mann-Whitney U tests.
RESULTS: OncoAppstore users tended to have higher educational levels and incomes 
and were more likely to be female, younger on average, and more often of Dutch 
origin compared to non-users. Users had higher primary and specialist mental 
healthcare expenditures and lower expenditures on total healthcare, general 
practitioner, hospital, and pharmaceutical care.
CONCLUSION: The early users of the OncoAppstore appear to be a selective group 
of cancer survivors as they are primarily individuals with high socioeconomic 
status. Thus, consistent with other e-health research, the same user patterns 
are observed. Future research should investigate whether this trend persists 
after a longer period and what is needed to better reach underrepresented 
groups.

The success of cancer care delivery must be evaluated not only by efficacy 
outcomes such as overall survival, but also by the experiences of patients and 
their informal caregivers throughout the course of care. Financial, time, and 
administrative burdens constitute a triad of non-physical ""toxicities'' that 
greatly affect patient and caregiver experiences-and outcomes- and should be 
routinely considered and addressed in oncology practice. While all these burdens 
have been ever-prevalent, the increasing complexity of cancer care has made 
these issues more relevant over time. Financial and time burdens started 
receiving mainstream attention in the oncology community circa 2010 and 2020 
respectively. Administrative burdens are currently less well defined but are 
increasingly recognized and consequential. Each component of the triad does not 
exist in isolation-financial, time, and administrative burdens can overlap with, 
interact with, and compound each other. Attempting to address one may worsen 
another-for example, transferring a medicine prescription and driving to another 
pharmacy 20 miles away where the co-pay is $50 lower may reduce direct 
medication out-of-pocket costs, but increase both time and administrative 
burden. The current piece summarizes the current status of the field with the 
hope it galvanizes the oncology community to understand and manage these 
burdens, so patients and caregivers can live their fullest lives.

Bone disorders frequently manifest as long-term outcomes of breast cancer. 
Consequently, the relationship between breast cancer and bone metabolism is 
often studied at advanced stages of the disease. Emerging evidence suggests that 
bidirectional communication between mammary and bone tissues begins much 
earlier. In this context, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been recognized as 
key mediators of intercellular communication, with emerging evidence supporting 
their role in breast cancer progression and the regulation of bone metabolism. 
This review examines bone imbalances occurring throughout the course of breast 
cancer, the pathophysiological mechanisms behind them, and the role of EVs in 
their development. From this integrated perspective, we propose the concept of 
Tumor-Bone Axis, a continuous and dynamic crosstalk between breast cancer and 
bone cells that supports tumor progression and bone complications. This axis 
regulates distinct metabolic states governing the activity of breast cancer 
cells and the balance in bone remodeling, enabling cellular reprogramming events 
during malignant transformation, immunoediting, tumor growth, and metastasis 
formation. Additionally, the impact of antineoplastic treatments on this axis 
may underlie chemoresistance, relapse, or therapy-induced metastasis. While 
multiple mediators are involved-including cell-to-cell contact, cell migration, 
osteoimmune interactions, hormones, soluble factors, and nutrients-EVs appear to 
be critical, especially through their role in exchanging epigenetic regulators 
of central signaling pathways in these cellular reprogramming events. 
Understanding the temporal and functional dynamics of the Tumor-Bone Axis and 
the extracellular vesicular traffic within it could reveal novel diagnostic 
biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for both breast cancer and its 
bone-related manifestations.

PURPOSE: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with a wide spectrum of 
subtypes, each with distinct biological features. Data on tumor subtypes in East 
Africa is sparse despite the rising incidence of breast cancer in this region. 
We aimed to determine the prevalence of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and 
to compare clinicopathological features, overall survival (OS), and factors 
affecting OS of patients with TNBC and non-TNBC in Tanzania.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective nested case-control study included 
patients with histologically proven breast cancer treated at Ocean Road Cancer 
Institute (ORCI) in Tanzania from January 2018 to December 2019. Logistic 
regression was used to determine factors associated with TNBC, and Cox 
proportional hazards regression was used to determine the factors independently 
associated with overall survival.
RESULTS: TNBC constituted 23.3% of all breast cancer diagnoses. Patients in the 
TNBC group were younger (median age 46 vs 53 years p < 0.001) and more often 
presented with stage IV disease (12% vs 4%, p = 0.001). Three-year overall 
survival (OS) was significantly lower in the TNBC group (36%) compared to the 
non-TNBC group (57%) (p = 0.004) and remained lower for the TNBC group across 
every tumor stage. Brain metastasis was higher in the TNBC group (34% vs 7%, 
p < 0.001). Factors associated with improved survival included shorter symptom 
duration (0.53, (0.36-0.78), earlier stage (0.23, (0.12-0.46)), use of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (0.59 (0.40-0.86)), and surgery with clean margins 
(0.34 (0.19-0.60)).
CONCLUSIONS: TNBC accounted for nearly a quarter of the breast cancers at ORCI. 
TNBC was associated with younger age, more aggressive clinicopathologic 
features, and worse survival. Efforts toward earlier diagnosis and optimized 
therapies will be critical to improving TNBC outcomes in Tanzania.

PURPOSE: The biology of locally radiorecurrent prostate cancer (LRR-PCa) is 
poorly understood.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We sought to explore the genomic and transcriptomic 
landscape of LRR-PCa with targeted DNA sequencing and RNA expression analysis 
from 41 biopsy-proven LRR-PCa tumors from 36 unique patients who had a 
recurrence at a median interval of 84 months (IQR, 70-124 months). Genomic 
alteration frequencies and transcriptomic data were compared between the LRR-PCa 
cohort and treatment-naïve patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (genomic; n = 
496) and Gleason grade-at-recurrence-matched patients from the Decipher Genomics 
Resource for Intelligent Discovery (transcriptomic; n = 22,320).
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (69%) had pathologic upgrading at recurrence (17% 
vs 64% with Gleason grade 4-5 disease; P < .001). The LRR-PCa cohort 
demonstrated significantly greater single-nucleotide variations in 29 genes 
known to be associated with prostate cancer, including several associated with 
increased aggressiveness and DNA repair: FAT1 (58.5% vs 1.0%), RAD51B (36.6% vs 
0.4%), POLQ (34.1% vs 1.4%), KMT2C (34.1% vs 4.9%), BRCA2 (29.3% vs 1.8%), ATRX 
(26.8% vs 0.8%), and BRCA1 (24.4% vs 0.4%) (Pvalues < .001 for all). The LRR-PCa 
cohort had a significantly higher Decipher score (median, 0.80 vs 0.66; P = .05) 
and demonstrated significantly greater basal subtype based on PAM50 (56% vs 20%; 
P < .001) and lower androgen receptor activity (61% for LRR vs 9%; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that LRR-PCa has a distinct genomic 
and transcriptomic landscape from de novo prostate cancer. Specifically, LRR-PCa 
has an enrichment in SNVs in genes associated with tumor aggressiveness and/or 
DNA repair, has higher Decipher scores, a more basal subtype, and has 
transcriptomic evidence of lower androgen receptor activity and loss of tumor 
suppressor genes.

Oxidative Assault: How Pyrogallol's Pro-Oxidant Chemistry Drives Cell Cycle 
Arrest and Apoptosis in Cancer.

Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation and the evasion of 
programmed cell death. The dysregulation of the cell cycle is a fundamental 
hallmark of nearly all human cancers, making its core machinery an attractive 
target for therapeutic intervention. Concurrently, the ability of cancer cells 
to resist apoptotic signals is a primary mechanism of tumorigenesis and therapy 
resistance. This has spurred the search for agents that can simultaneously 
reinstate cell cycle control and trigger robust cell death pathways. Natural 
products, particularly polyphenols, have emerged as a promising source. 
Pyrogallol (1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene), a simple phenolic compound found in 
numerous plants, has demonstrated potent anticancer activities across a wide 
range of malignancies. This review synthesizes the current understanding of 
pyrogallol's mechanism of action, rooted in its pro-oxidant nature. Pyrogallol 
autoxidation generates a massive burst of intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species 
(ROS) and causes a concomitant depletion of Glutathione (GSH), creating severe 
oxidative stress. This oxidative assault is particularly effective against 
cancer cells, which often have a compromised redox balance, rendering them more 
vulnerable than their normal counterparts. This ROS/GSH imbalance acts as a 
master signal to initiate a multifaceted attack on cancer cells by 
comprehensively rewiring cellular signaling, leading to the inhibition of 
critical pro-survival pathways (e.g., PI3K/Akt) and the activation of 
stress-responsive kinase pathways (e.g., JNK, p38). These signaling alterations 
converge to induce robust cell cycle arrest, primarily at the G2/M transition, 
and trigger the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, marked by 
mitochondrial membrane depolarization, modulation of Bcl-2 family proteins, and 
caspase activation. This review provides a cohesive model of pyrogallol's 
action, highlighting its potential as a lead compound for developing novel 
oxidative therapies that exploit the inherent redox vulnerabilities of cancer 
cells.

Purpose To determine whether bimodal US improves prediction of pathologic 
complete response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) compared with MRI, as 
well as to assess the diagnostic value of a combined imaging model. Materials 
and Methods In this prospective two-center study, participants with primary 
breast cancer undergoing NAC between January 2020 and January 2024 were 
enrolled. Preoperative bimodal US (grayscale and shear wave) and MRI data were 
collected. Complete response on US (uCR) and MR images (mCR) were defined by 
radiologists. Diagnostic models based on uCR, mCR, and their combination were 
evaluated using postsurgical pathology as the reference standard. Pathologic 
complete response was defined as no residual tumor (ypT0) or no invasive cancer 
with possible ductal carcinoma in situ (ypT0/Tis). Model performance was 
evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), with 
sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and 
comparisons by the DeLong test. All tests were two-sided (P < .05). Results A 
total of 224 female participants (median age, 46 years; IQR, 38.75-56) with 
breast cancer undergoing NAC were included. Overall, 82 of 224 (37%) achieved 
ypT0/Tis, and 62 of 224 (28%) achieved ypT0. Using ypT0/Tis as the pathologic 
complete response standard, the uCR model achieved an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.67, 
0.83), while the mCR model achieved an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.87). Using 
ypT0, the uCR model achieved an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.86), and the mCR 
model an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.82) in the test set. The combined imaging 
model (ypT0/Tis, AUC = 0.87; ypT0, AUC = 0.87) outperformed both the uCR 
(ypT0/Tis, P = .002; ypT0, P = .002) and mCR models (ypT0/Tis, P = .04; ypT0, P 
= .004). Conclusion Bimodal US effectively predicted pathologic response to NAC 
in breast cancer with accuracy comparable to MRI. A combined US/MRI model 
demonstrated higher diagnostic performance than either modality alone. Keywords:

BACKGROUND: Poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid 
cancer (ATC) are both rare and aggressive thyroid cancers. Advances in targeted 
therapy and immunotherapy have changed the treatment strategies and improved 
prognosis in these patients.
METHODS: This single center cohort study included patients diagnosed with 
locally advanced or metastatic PDTC/ATC in Fudan University Shanghai Cancer 
Center (FUSCC) between 2019 and2023. Patients were either enrolled in clinical 
trials or received treatment based on clinical guidelines and expert consensus. 
Gene testing was conducted using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of clinical 
samples.
RESULTS: 95 patients were analyzed (PDTC=34, ATC=61). Median overall survival 
(OS) was 19.7 months for PDTC and 9.5 months for ATC (P=0.478). Among 82 
patients who underwent gene testing, the most frequent gene alterations in PDTC 
were BRAF (50.0%), TERT promoter (39.3%) and TP53 (25.0%) mutations; in ATC, 
they were TERT promoter (55.6%), BRAF (42.6%) and TP53 (25.9%) mutations. 
Compared with ATC patients, PDTC patients were more likely to receive best 
supportive care and less likely to be enrolled in clinical trials or treated 
with PD-1 inhibitors. The one-year OS rates for PDTC/ATC patients receiving 
neoadjuvant therapy + surgery, systemic treatment, and supportive care only were 
83.3%, 51.2% and 5.7%, respectively (P<0.001). After adjusting for covariates, 
neoadjuvant therapy + surgery (hazard ration [HR]=0.216, 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 0.647-0.718, P=0.012) was an independent predictor for superior OS.
CONCLUSION: Despite the generally poor prognosis, aggressive treatment, 
particularly neoadjuvant therapy, has been shown to improve survival. 
Personalized treatment is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies for 
PDTC/ATC.

BACKGROUND: HER2 gene mutations occur in 2 to 4% of patients with non-small-cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC). Sevabertinib is an oral, reversible tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor that has shown anti-HER2 activity in preclinical models.
METHODS: We conducted an open-label, multicenter, multicohort, phase 1-2 study 
to evaluate sevabertinib at a twice-daily dose of 20 mg in patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic HER2-mutant NSCLC. Three cohorts were defined according 
to previous therapy: cohort D comprised previously treated patients who had not 
received HER2-targeted therapy; cohort E, patients who had previously received 
HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugates; and cohort F, patients who had not 
previously received treatment. The primary end point was an objective response, 
as assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary end points were 
duration of response and progression-free survival.
RESULTS: A total of 209 patients received sevabertinib (as of June 27, 2025, the 
data-cutoff date); the median duration of follow-up was 13.8 months in cohort D, 
11.7 months in cohort E, and 9.9 months in cohort F. Among 81 patients in cohort 
D, an objective response was observed in 64% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53 
to 75); the median duration of response was 9.2 months (95% CI, 6.3 to 13.5), 
and the median progression-free survival was 8.3 months (95% CI, 6.9 to 12.3). 
Among 55 patients in cohort E, an objective response was observed in 38% (95% 
CI, 25 to 52); the median duration of response was 8.5 months, and the median 
progression-free survival was 5.5 months. Among 73 patients in cohort F, an 
objective response was observed in 71% (95% CI, 59 to 81), and the median 
duration of response was 11.0 months; data on progression-free survival were 
immature. Grade 3 or higher drug-related adverse events occurred in 31% of the 
patients. The most common adverse event was diarrhea (in 84 to 91%), with 
diarrhea of grade 3 or higher occurring in 5 to 23%. Treatment was discontinued 
by 3% of the patients owing to drug-related adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Sevabertinib showed antitumor activity in patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic HER2-mutant NSCLC. Diarrhea was the most common adverse 
event. (Funded by Bayer; SOHO-01 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05099172.).

Cholesterol and its metabolites exert multifaceted and profound effects on 
cancer initiation, progression and therapeutic response as well as patient 
prognosis. The present review systematically summarizes the oncogenic role of 
cholesterol metabolism in malignancies. Cancer cells extensively remodel 
cholesterol homeostasis through enhanced synthesis, increased uptake and 
impaired efflux, thereby sustaining proliferative signaling, suppressing 
ferroptotic cell death, promoting autophagic survival and facilitating 
epithelial‑mesenchymal transition, collectively fueling tumor invasion and 
metastasis. Within the tumor immune microenvironment, cholesterol exhibits dual 
immunoregulatory roles; it potentiates T‑cell antitumor function while its 
oxidized derivatives contribute to T‑cell exhaustion. Therapeutic targeting of 
cholesterol metabolism represents a promising strategy to trigger ferroptosis, 
reverse chemoresistance and reinvigorate antitumor immunity. Nevertheless, 
epidemiological evidence regarding the correlation between cholesterol levels 
and cancer risk remains contentious, underscoring the context‑dependent and 
complex nature of cholesterol in oncology. Targeting cholesterol metabolism may 
thus offer a novel integrative approach for cancer therapy, meriting further 
mechanistic and clinical investigation.

Following the publication of the above paper, it was drawn to the Editor's 
attention by a concerned reader that, for the cell invasion assay experiments 
shown in Fig. 4B, the 'Con' and 'LPA+HF' data panels contained an overlapping

Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a major malignancy within the digestive 
tract, with its incidence and mortality rates steadily increasing annually, 
posing a severe threat to human health. Despite the extensive clinical 
utilization of diverse chemotherapeutic agents, their propensity for deleterious 
side effects and the emergence of drug resistance can impede patient compliance, 
consequently culminating in chemotherapy failure. Consequently, the quest for 
novel therapeutic agents with high efficacy and minimal toxicity has become 
increasingly urgent. To address this critical clinical dilemma, there is an 
imperative need to develop effective and well‑tolerated anti‑CRC drugs. 
Plant‑based antioxidants (PBAs) are now understood to possess diverse biological 
activities, thereby offering significant advantages with respect to clinical 
anti‑CRC applications. Compared with synthetic chemical agents, they are 
ubiquitous in natural sources, possess high safety profiles and can act as 
detoxifying or sensitizing agents when combined with conventional therapies in 
CRC, such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Hence, the present review 
systematically reviewed current research on PBAs for CRC treatment from the 
perspective of bioactive compounds, with the aim of offering theoretical 
foundations and reference values for future studies and clinical applications of 
PBAs in CRC therapies.

Wuweizisu B (WSB), a bioactive lignan derived from Schisandra chinensis, has 
shown promise as a multi‑target anticancer agent with unique therapeutic 
advantages over conventional therapies. The present review systematically 
examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of WSB, 
including induction of cell cycle arrest, promotion of apoptosis through 
mitochondrial and death receptor pathways, inhibition of epithelial‑mesenchymal 
transition and remodeling of the tumor immune microenvironment. WSB exhibits 
synergistic potential with chemotherapy and immunotherapy and can reverse 
multidrug resistance (MDR) by modulating key pathways such as STAT3, 
P‑glycoprotein (P‑gp), and survivin. To address pharmacokinetic limitations, 
particularly low oral bioavailability, the present review discussed innovative 
delivery strategies such as nanotechnology‑based formulations to enhance tumor 
targeting. Thus, with its pleiotropic mechanisms, low toxicity profile, and 
broad‑spectrum efficacy across multiple cancers, the WSB merits further 
investigation as a complementary oncology therapeutic. However, its clinical 
translation faces challenges, including potential hepatotoxicity and lack of 
clinical validation. The present review consolidated current knowledge of WSB's 
anticancer potential while providing a roadmap for clinical development, 
emphasizing the need for biomarker‑driven trials and precision delivery systems 
to fully realize its therapeutic value in personalized medicine.

Platelets, while essential for hemostasis, have been recognized as critical 
mediators in cancer metastasis. The crosstalk between platelets and circulating 
tumor cells (CTCs) constitutes a key driver of metastasis, emerging as a focal 
point in oncology research. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms provides novel 
insights into tumor dissemination. The present review systematically traces the 
evolution of platelet‑CTC crosstalk, from receptor‑mediated adhesion to 
bidirectional molecular exchange, and its implications for metastatic 
progression. Additionally, the diagnostic significance of platelet‑CTC complexes 
as potential biomarkers for cancer detection and prognosis is highlighted. 
Finally, promising therapeutic strategies targeting the platelet‑CTC crosstalk 
are discussed. By integrating current knowledge, it was demonstrated that 
targeting platelet‑CTC crosstalk holds potential for improving cancer diagnosis 
and therapy, while also identifying avenues for future translational research.

BACKGROUND: Paediatric palliative care (PPC) addresses the unmet needs of 
children with life-limiting conditions and their families. In France, PPC for 
children with cancer is regularly offered in hospital or the home setting, with 
families often stating a preference for home care. However, hospitalisation at 
home (HaH) poses significant parenting challenges for mothers, particularly in 
terms of emotional support, decision-making, and day-to-day care management.
AIM: To describe maternal perceptions and experiences regarding parenting styles 
during the home hospitalisation of a child with cancer in PPC.
DESIGN AND METHODS: The study employed a qualitative research approach based on 
reflexive thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Three mothers (n = 3) were included in the study. The central theme and 
sub-themes, which are rooted in a causal and hierarchical logic, were identified 
through reflexive thematic analysis. The main theme-the process of parenting in 
PPC-has three distinct stages. The first encompasses the different forms of 
parenting, which vary according to circumstances. The second is the foundation 
or cornerstone of parenting, namely the continuous presence that remains stable 
over time. The third stage-and the driving force behind parenting-is the guilt 
that fuels the process.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the complex nature of parenting in PPC, which 
is characterised by constant adjustments in response to the child's suffering. 
PPC should be flexible, responsive, and tailored to the needs of children and 
their families.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among 
women worldwide. Delays in medical care, particularly among elderly patients, 
significantly contribute to late-stage diagnoses and poor outcomes. This study 
investigates the interplay between health literacy, coping mechanisms, 
psychological factors, and delays in breast cancer care, focusing on structural 
barriers and subgroup analyses.
METHODS: This descriptive-correlational study recruited 300 elderly breast 
cancer patients (aged 65+) from urban and rural clinics using purposive 
sampling. Data were collected through validated questionnaires, including the 
Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ), Brief COPE Inventory, Health Anxiety 
Inventory (HAI), and medical record reviews. Structural equation modeling (SEM) 
was employed to examine the direct, indirect, and moderating effects of health 
literacy and coping mechanisms on care delays. Subgroup comparisons were 
performed based on geographic location, socioeconomic status (SES), and age.
RESULTS: Higher health literacy was associated with shorter delays (β = -0.47, 
p < 0.01), with problem-focused coping mediating this relationship (β = -0.36, 
p < 0.01). Health anxiety and social stigma were significant predictors of 
diagnostic and patient delays, respectively (p < 0.01). Rural patients and those 
with lower SES experienced the most extended delays across all stages of care. 
The SEM model demonstrated a good fit (CFI = 0.92, RMSEA = 0.06).
CONCLUSION: Health literacy, coping mechanisms, and psychological factors 
significantly influence delays in breast cancer care. Individualized 
interventions to increase health literacy, reduce stigma, and remove systemic 
barriers are necessary for early treatment. These findings provide a model for 
focused, equitable healthcare strategies in underserved populations.

BACKGROUND: Cultural beliefs shape how oral cancer patients perceive their 
illness, seek support, and manage psychological distress, particularly amid 
tobacco-related stigma. This study examines the role of cultural context in 
stigma, help-seeking behaviors, and mental health outcomes in oral squamous cell 
carcinoma (OSCC) patients, comparing rural and urban subcultures in India and 
referencing global literature.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study at H.P. Government 
Dental College and Hospital, Shimla, enrolling 56 OSCC patients from rural and 
urban backgrounds. We assessed psychological burden and quality of life using 
the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and EORTC QLQ-H&N43 at 
diagnosis, two weeks, one month, and six months post-treatment. We analyzed data 
to identify correlations between stigma, subcultural context, mental health, and 
help-seeking behavior.
RESULTS: Rural patients reported significantly higher stigma and delayed 
help-seeking, associated with increased depression and stress over time. Urban 
patients exhibited proactive coping and better quality of life, despite similar 
tobacco-related stigma. Cross-cultural comparisons indicate that shame and 
stigma in tobacco-prevalent societies delay care and worsen psychological 
morbidity.
CONCLUSION: Stigma rooted in cultural beliefs hinders timely diagnosis and 
psychological resilience in OSCC patients, especially in rural settings. 
Culturally sensitive psycho-oncology frameworks are needed to address stigma, 
promote mental health, and enhance help-seeking to improve oncologic and 
psychosocial outcomes.

PURPOSE: The ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) kinase inhibitor 
elimusertib synergizes with cisplatin preclinically. We evaluated the clinical 
feasibility of combining elimusertib with cisplatin.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumors who had <300 mg/m2 
prior cisplatin, and for whom cisplatin-based treatment was deemed appropriate, 
were enrolled according to a standard 3+3 design, starting elimusertib at 20 mg 
orally (PO) twice daily on Days 2 and 9 with cisplatin 60 mg/m2 intravenously 
(IV) on D1 of a 21-day cycle. Primary objectives were determination of maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) and safety. Secondary objectives included assessment of 
elimusertib pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary efficacy.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients were enrolled. Dose level -2 (elimusertib 20 mg once 
on Day 2 and cisplatin 30 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8) was deemed the MTD; 
Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) including creatinine increase, hypokalemia, 
febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, syncope, and thrombocytopenia required dose 
de-escalation. While the four highest elimusertib exposure patients all 
experienced hematologic DLTs within 1 week, they also received higher day 1 
cisplatin dose, precluding definitive association of elimusertib exposure with 
DLT occurrence. Of ten evaluable patients: one (10%) with clear cell ovarian 
cancer had a partial response, while five (50%) had stable disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Cisplatin combined with elimusertib was associated with hematologic 
toxicity requiring significant dose de-escalation. Elimusertib PK was consistent 
with prior studies. Only modest activity was observed. Further clinical 
evaluation of elimusertib plus cisplatin is not warranted.

BACKGROUND: Limited data are available regarding the comparison of low-dose 
immunotherapy when added to oral metronomic chemotherapy with conventional 
induction chemotherapy regimens in recurrent/metastatic Head and Neck Squamous 
Cell Carcinoma (R/M HNSCC).
METHODS: This real-world phase IV superiority trial recruited adult patients 
with R/M HNSCC being treated with palliative intent. Patients were assigned to 
TMC-I or PC. The primary endpoints were median OS, PFS, ORR, and ICER, and the 
safety assessment was the secondary endpoint.
RESULTS: A total of 154 patients were recruited: 78 in the TMC-I arm and 76 in 
the PC arm. The median OS was 15.13 months (95% CI, 11.05-19.20) versus 
9.8 months (95% CI, 7.50-12.09) (p < 0.01), and the median PFS was 11.20 months 
(95% CI, 5.43-16.96) versus 7.41 months (95% CI, 6.73-8.08) (p < 0.01) for the 
TMC-I and PC arms, respectively. The ORR was 69.23% for TMC-I and 31.57% for the 
PC arm, respectively. The ICER between both arms was 68 947.
CONCLUSION: A significant improvement in survival, tolerability, and reasonable 
cost-effectiveness was observed with low-dose immunotherapy when added to oral 
metronomic chemotherapy compared to conventional chemotherapy regimens.

(1)Sarah Cannon Research Institute, Nashville, Tennessee.

Tumor-agnostic therapies represent a revolutionary shift from century-old 
anatomic classifications to molecular-driven cancer treatment, in which 
therapeutic decisions are based on what drives the tumor rather than where it 
arises. This perspective calls for a transformative acceleration of 
tissue-agnostic drug development from today's 10 approvals to 50 to 100 within 
25 years to eliminate therapeutic inequities and ensure every patient receives 
the right therapy based on their tumor's molecular identity, not anatomic 
accident.

INTRODUCTION: Recent advancements in oncology have significantly improved cancer 
treatment outcomes and patient survival rates. Nonetheless, the therapeutic 
effects of cancer treatment often impair the patients' quality of life (QoL). 
The most common symptoms include fatigue, pain, sleep disturbances, depression, 
and anxiety. This study aims to assess the impact of a structured mind-body 
medicine (MBM) group intervention on these specific symptom domains in patients 
with cancer.
METHODS: A cohort of patients with cancer engaged in an 11-week MBM program 
(6 hours weekly, March 2016-August 2017), combining psycho-oncology, lifestyle 
medicine, and integrative approaches including mindfulness, nutrition 
counseling, and movement therapies. Participants' outcomes were evaluated for 
within-person (pre-post) changes using standardized questionnaires, including 
the Multidimensional Fatigue Index (MFI), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy (FACT-G), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
RESULTS: Assessments from 113 participants (94.7% female, 58.9% with breast 
cancer) revealed significant improvements (all P < .001) across all outcome 
measures. Effect sizes were medium to large: fatigue (Cohen's d = 0.707), stress 
(d = 0.708), quality of life (d = 0.981), anxiety (d = 0.635), depression 
(d = 0.526), and sleep quality (d = 0.635). Clinical significance analysis 
showed that 50% to 70% of participants achieved minimal clinically important 
differences, with FACT-G showing the highest clinical relevance (70.1% improved 
≥5 points). Wild bootstrap regression analysis with multiple testing correction 
identified baseline sleep quality as the strongest predictor: worse pre-program 
sleep was associated with greater improvements in depression (β = -.282 [95% CI: 
-0.467 to -0.099], P = .002) and sleep quality (β = -.432 [95% CI: -0.620 to 
-0.244], P < .001), surviving Bonferroni correction.).
CONCLUSION: MBM programs may be a valuable addition to oncology care and they 
could improve patients' quality of life. Incorporating these programs into 
standard cancer treatment protocols could provide a more holistic approach that 
addresses both the physical and psychological facets of cancer therapy.

BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) is important for improving life expectancy 
and is suggested as a prognostic factor for various diseases. However, the 
association between PA and mortality outcomes in survivors of lung cancer 
remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the association of PA 
levels, including changes before and after diagnosis, with mortality outcomes 
among survivors of lung cancer.
METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cohort study involving 23 257 individuals 
diagnosed with lung cancer between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2016, who 
attended the National Health Screening Program within 2 years before and after 
diagnosis. Pre- and postdiagnosis leisure-time PA levels and changes in PA were 
assessed using self-administered questionnaires. Individuals who reported 
engaging in moderate-intensity exercise ≥ 5 days/week or vigorous-intensity 
exercise ≥ 3 days/week were classified as physically active. The amount of PA 
was calculated as the metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-min/week for each 
individual. All participants were followed from the date of diagnosis to 31 
December 2022, for the outcome of mortality.
RESULTS: During the follow-up period of 165 344.0 person-years, 9094 deaths 
occurred (6633 lung cancer-specific and 2461 non-lung cancer deaths). 
Multivariable analyses revealed that both pre- and postdiagnosis PA were 
associated with significantly reduced risk of all-cause (aHR = 0.92, 95% 
CI = 0.88-0.97 for prediagnosis and aHR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.81-0.89 for 
postdiagnosis) and lung cancer-specific (aHR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.88-0.99 for 
prediagnosis and aHR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.84-0.94 for postdiagnosis) mortality 
compared with inactivity. Significant dose-response relationships were observed 
between PA levels and mortality risk reduction. Compared with individuals who 
were consistently inactive before and after diagnosis, significant mortality 
risk reduction was seen in those who maintained PA (aHR = 0.77, 95% 
CI = 0.71-0.83 for all-cause and aHR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.75-0.89 for lung 
cancer-specific mortality) and those who promoted PA after lung cancer diagnosis 
(aHR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.85-0.96 for all-cause and aHR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.88-1.00 
for lung cancer-specific mortality). However, individuals who were active before 
diagnosis but became inactive after diagnosis showed no significant difference 
in survival outcomes compared with those who were consistently inactive.
CONCLUSIONS: Both pre- and postdiagnosis PA are associated with reduced 
mortality in survivors of lung cancer in a dose-response manner. Maintenance and 
promotion of PA after diagnosis are key to achieving optimal benefits in overall 
survival.

BACKGROUND: Endocrine science remains underrepresented in European Union 
research programmes despite the fundamental role of hormone health in human 
wellbeing. Analysis of the CORDIS database reveals a persistent gap between the 
societal impact of endocrine disorders and their research prioritisation. At 
national funding level, endocrine societies report limited or little attention 
of national research funding towards endocrinology. The EndoCompass project-a 
joint initiative between the European Society of Endocrinology and the European 
Society of Paediatric Endocrinology-aimed to identify and promote strategic 
research priorities in endocrine science to address critical hormone-related 
health challenges.
METHODS: Research priorities were established through comprehensive analysis of 
the EU CORDIS database covering the Horizon 2020 framework period (2014-2020). 
Expert consultation was conducted to identify key research priorities, followed 
by broader stakeholder engagement including society members and patient advocacy 
groups.
RESULTS: Research priorities encompass re-evaluation of progestins in breast 
cancer treatment; strategies to disrupt AR signalling in prostate cancer; 
surveillance for endocrine sequelae in childhood cancer survivors; understanding 
genotoxic effects on fertility; and management of checkpoint inhibitor 
endocrinopathies and familial cancer syndromes. Emphasis is placed on precision 
medicine and metabolic factors in cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: This component of the EndoCompass project provides an 
evidence-based roadmap for strategic research investment. This framework 
identifies crucial investigation areas into cancer-endocrine pathophysiology, 
prevention, and treatment strategies, ultimately aimed at reducing the burden of 
these disorders on individuals and society. The findings support the broader 
EndoCompass objective of aligning research funding with areas of highest 
potential impact in endocrine health.

Cancer patients benefit from significantly higher survival rates if tumors are 
detected at early stages and prior to metastasis. Positron emission tomography 
(PET), computed tomography (CT), Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography 
(SPECT), and other imaging techniques allow for noninvasive diagnosis of various 
tumors in relatively short periods. Targeted delivery of radiation is also an 
important approach in cancer therapy. Due to the dynamic nature of RNA, RNA 
nanoparticles demonstrate spontaneous tumor targeting, resulting in rapid 
accumulation in tumors without the use of targeting ligands. Incorporating 
tumor-targeting ligands on RNA nanoparticles generates enhanced tumor 
accumulation and targeting. Here a unique technology to specifically label 
three-way junction (3WJ) RNA nanoparticles is reported to carry radioisotopes or 
other imaging markers for cancer imaging. Two RNA nanoparticles were constructed 
to target prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) via a PSMA RNA aptamer or 
conjugated tert-Butyl-DCL (DCL). The spontaneous cancer homing of the RNA 
complex resulted in the detection of tumors with high sensitivity in mouse 
models, which can be applied to any cancer subtype at an early stage. Tumor 
accumulation occurred due to the motile and deformable nature of RNA 
nanoparticles, allowing for the high tumor accumulation of the imaging reagent 
via passing rapidly growing and leaky capillaries in the tumor vasculature. 
Furthermore, RNA nanoparticles conjugated with a NOTA radioisotope chelator were 
incubated with 68Ga in a pH- and temperature-controlled environment to prevent 
68Ga non-specific interactions with the negatively charged phosphodiester 
backbone of RNA. The low pH during 68Ga3+ conjugation neutralized the negative 
charge of the phosphate backbone on the RNA, ensuring only specific radioisotope 
chelation to NOTA. To prove the concept of the proposed system, 68Ga-labeled 3WJ 
was tested in a prostate cancer animal model by PET/CT. The 68Ga-SF5 3WJ 
accumulated in and identified prostate cancer tumors with high sensitivity, 
resolution, specificity, and reliability. The proof-of-concept study reported in 
this paper is an important step in the direction of developing novel 
radiotherapeutic agents for various cancers. The radioisotope- or 
fluorophore-labelled nanoparticles were excreted from the body quickly due to 
the motile and deformable nature of the RNA complex, thus reducing the chance of 
toxicity and side effects. This molecular imaging platform, based on RNA 
nanoparticles, shows great promise in early diagnosis, staging, and precise 
treatment of any tumor subtype.

OBJECTIVES: To study the characteristics of penile cancer in French Guiana (FG)- 
a French overseas department in South America. Indeed, penile cancer is a rare 
malignancy with significant geographic and socioeconomic disparities. While its 
epidemiology is well-documented in mainland France, data from FG remain limited.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 22 cases of 
primary penile cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2024 at the Centre Hospitalier 
de Kourou. Demographic, clinical, histopathological, and risk factor data were 
collected and reviewed.
RESULTS: The average incidence was 1.07 cases per year, with a mean age at 
diagnosis of 54.9 years. Notably, 19% of patients were under 40 years. The 
Bushinengue population (descendants of escaped African slaves) accounted for 
54.5% of cases. The most common risk factor was lack of circumcision (100%), 
followed by HPV-16 infection (40.9%). Most tumours were exophytic (68.2%), 
distal (72.7%), with a median size of 3.5 cm. Squamous cell carcinoma was the 
predominant histological type (90.9%), with 56.3% being well differentiated. 
Lymph node involvement was present in 68.2% of patients.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of penile cancer in FG appears higher than in 
neighbouring regions, potentially due to regional underreporting and 
cross-border healthcare access. The disproportionate impact on the Bushinengue 
population, younger age at diagnosis and advanced disease at presentation likely 
reflect cultural practices, low circumcision rates and barriers to early care. 
This first study on penile cancer in FG highlights the role of non-circumcision 
and HPV-16 infection as major risk factors. Public health efforts should 
prioritize HPV vaccination and early diagnostic access in vulnerable 
populations.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to develop and validate a predictive model using 
radiomics features from automatic breast volume scanner (ABVS) and 2D ultrasound 
images to preoperatively assess Ki-67 expression in breast cancer (BC), thereby 
supporting personalized clinical treatment planning.
METHODS: Data from 426 BC patients who met the inclusion criteria were 
retrospectively analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
analyses were performed on the clinical ultrasound characteristics to construct 
a clinical model. Radiomics features were extracted from both the tumor and the 
sub-regions based on ABVS and 2D images. The silhouette coefficient was used to 
evaluate clustering performance and determine the optimal number of clusters. 
Radiomics-based prediction models were developed using four machine learning 
classifiers: Logistic Regression, ExtraTree, XGBoost, and LightGBM. A combined 
model was further constructed by integrating radiomics and habitat radiomics 
features from ABVS and 2D images with relevant clinical factors. Model 
performance was evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) 
curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: In the validation set, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of the 
radiomics model (Rad ABVS + 2D ), the habitat radiomics model (Hab ABVS + 2D ), 
and the combined radiomics model (Rad-Hab ABVS + 2D ) were 0.603, 0.664, and 
0.850, respectively. By integrating independent clinical factors (US-ALNs, 
T-stage) with the Rad-Hab ABVS + 2D model, a comprehensive model (CM Clinical + 
Rad-Hab ) was constructed using LightGBM. According to the DeLong test, this 
model significantly outperformed others in terms of AUC (P < 0.05). The AUC 
values for the training and validation sets were 0.951 (95% CI: 0.928-0.973) and 
0.884 (95% CI: 0.832-0.949), respectively. The calibration curves and DCA of CM 
Clinical + Rad-Hab demonstrated excellent model calibration and clinical 
utility.
CONCLUSION: The CM Clinical + Rad-Hab model developed in this study enables 
accurate preoperative prediction of Ki-67 expression in BC patients, 
facilitating personalized and precise treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Yukgunja-tang (YGJT), also known as Liujunzi Decoction or 
Rikkunshito, is a traditional East Asian herbal formula widely used to manage 
symptoms associated with cancer and chemotherapy. This study aimed to 
systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of modified YGJT combined with 
standard antitumor therapy in patients with lung cancer.
METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in 10 databases through March 
2025. Randomized controlled trials comparing modified YGJT plus antitumor 
therapy versus antitumor therapy alone or placebo were included. Studies 
involving other herbal combinations or East Asian therapies were excluded. Risk 
of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. A random-effects 
model was used for meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Thirty-one trials involving 2,496 participants were included. Modified 
YGJT significantly improved the objective response rate (ORR; RR 1.69, 95% CI 
1.41-2.04), disease control rate (DCR; RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.11-1.31), and Karnofsky 
Performance Status (KPS; RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.23-2.60; MD 8.62, 95% CI 3.86-13.38). 
Symptom relief was observed (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.25-1.85; MD -10.87, 95% CI -12.51 
to -9.22), along with improvements in immune markers (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, 
CD4+/CD8+ ratio) and reductions in tumor markers (CEA, CYFRA 21-1, NSE, SCC, 
CA19-9) and adverse events (myelosuppression, leukopenia, gastrointestinal 
reactions).
CONCLUSION: Modified YGJT may offer clinical benefits as an adjuvant to standard 
lung cancer therapy by improving treatment outcomes and reducing toxicity. 
Large-scale, high-quality trials are needed to confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND: Parents caring for a child with cancer face substantial burdens that 
can diminish parental quality of life (QoL). Social support is often protective, 
yet the independent contribution of father involvement remains uncertain, 
particularly in Jordan. This study evaluated how perceived social support and 
father involvement relate to parental QoL.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 547 parents of children receiving cancer 
care at any setting for cancer in Jordan completed validated measures of 
parental QoL [SF-36], perceived social support, and father involvement [IFI]. 
Data were collected between March 2022 and March 2023.
RESULTS: Mean QoL (SF-36 total) was 63.36 (SD = 6.48), indicating a moderate 
level on the 0-100 scale. Family/social support averaged 11.5 (SD = 4.9); 
endorsement of moral support (77%) and advice availability (72%) was common. 
Family/social support was positively associated with QoL (r =0.152, p =0.01; 
small effect). Father involvement showed no association with QoL (r =0.031, p 
=0.452). The overall regression model was significant (F = 18.3, p =0.01). 
Independent predictors of higher QoL were higher monthly income (B = 4.417, p 
<0.001), marital status (being single vs married associated with lower QoL; B = 
-6.325, p =0.002), place of residence (urban vs village associated with lower 
QoL; B = -3.387, p =0.004), and health insurance (B = 2.594, p =0.037).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In Jordan, perceived social support was a 
significant predictor of better QoL, whereas father involvement was not 
independently associated. Strengthening accessible, multi-source social support 
should be prioritized in caregiver interventions. Routine screening for social 
support in pediatric oncology and embedding support navigation, peer groups, and 
linkage to community resources may yield greater QoL gains than interventions 
focused primarily on increasing father involvement.

Esophageal Cancer in a Mid-esophageal Diverticulum: A Case Report on Diagnostic 
Challenges and Treatment Outcomes.

Esophageal diverticula are rare pouches that form in the esophageal lining. They 
occur infrequently in the general population and are more often seen in 
individuals with dysphagia. Among the types, mid-esophageal (parabronchial) 
diverticula are especially uncommon. These diverticula are usually asymptomatic 
and are often found incidentally during diagnostic procedures. Unlike distal 
esophageal diverticula, which may be linked to acid reflux, mid-esophageal types 
are thought to result from long-standing inflammation or mechanical forces 
acting on the esophagus. Although cancer arising in esophageal diverticula is 
uncommon, when it does occur, it may progress more rapidly due to structural 
weaknesses in the diverticular wall. We present the case of a middle-aged man 
with progressive difficulty swallowing and a persistent dry cough. Endoscopy 
identified a large mid-esophageal diverticulum approximately 25 cm from the 
incisors, with irregular mucosal changes. Initial biopsies were non-diagnostic, 
showing granulation tissue. A contrast-enhanced CT scan later revealed a mass in 
the lower esophagus with signs of spread to the lungs. Bronchoscopy confirmed 
the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. The patient underwent six cycles of 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy with a positive response. This case illustrates 
the challenges in diagnosing malignancy within an esophageal diverticulum and 
underscores the importance of thorough evaluation in symptomatic patients, as 
early detection can significantly influence treatment and outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the cytotoxic activities of the methanolic 
extract of Allium colchicifolium bulbs and its purified flavonoids. It also 
assessed the anti-angiogenic activities, a key mechanism of anti-cancer agents.
METHODS: The methanolic extract was fractionated using column chromatography 
(CC) on silica gel RP-18 and polyamide SC-6, then purified with Sephadex LH-20. 
The compounds were identified through spectroscopic methods such as nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) and liquid chromatography-electrospray 
ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Cytotoxicity and 
anti-angiogenic activities were evaluated using the MTT assay and the chick 
chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, respectively. Computational modeling 
explored the potential anti-angiogenic mechanisms of the purified compounds. 
Additionally, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity 
(ADMET) profiling predicted drug-likeness features.
RESULTS: Three flavonoids - quercetin 3-O-rutinoside (1), isorhamnetin 
3-O-glucoside (2), and quercetin (3) - were isolated and identified. Compounds 2 
and 3 showed the highest cytotoxicity against PC3 (prostate cancer, IC50 = 1.72 
± 0.11 µg/mL) and MCF-7 (breast cancer, IC50 = 1.64 ± 0.11 µg/mL) cell lines. 
The methanolic extract and compound 3 also had potent anti-angiogenic effects 
with IC50 values of 4.2 ± 0.25 and 5.3 ± 0.3 µg/mL, respectively. Molecular 
docking indicated that compounds 1 and 3 had the strongest interactions with the 
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1, consistent with their 
anti-angiogenic activity. The ADMET profiling showed that compound 3 had the 
highest similarity to drug-like molecules.
CONCLUSIONS: This was the first phytochemical study of flavonoids in A. 
colchicifolium bulbs. The results suggest that these bulbs could serve as a 
natural source for cancer prevention and treatment, owing to their cytotoxic and 
anti-angiogenic properties. Further research is needed to confirm these 
findings, and in vivo studies are essential to validate their therapeutic 
potential.

BACKGROUND: At present, regarding the optimal potential for prevention and 
treatment of cancer, medicinal plants have received more attention than before. 
Stachys lavandulifolia is one of the 34 Stachys species found in various regions 
such as Iran. Although effective secondary metabolites have been identified in 
several species of the Stachys genus, research on the anticancer effects of 
extracts of S. lavandulifolia is limited.
METHODS: In the present study, different extracts of S. lavandulifolia 
(n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, ethanol, hydroethanol, and water) were 
acquired, and three human cancer cell lines (H1299, MCF-7, and A2780) were used 
to analyze their anticancer effects.
RESULTS: The chloroform and ethyl acetate extracts provided the highest toxicity 
against A2780 and were fractioned into A-E and F-J, respectively. Fractions C 
and F resulted in reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), while 
fractions C, E, F, and I led to an increase in the activity of the caspase-3 
enzyme. Fractions B, C, and I increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the 
A2780 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the reduction in MMP and the increase in caspase-9 by 
fraction C, it can be said that apoptosis is induced by the intrinsic pathway.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer remains a significant global health concern, 
necessitating the development of more effective treatment strategies.
METHODS: This study investigated the therapeutic potential of valproic acid (VA) 
and retinoic acid (RA), both as single agents and in combination with 
conventional chemotherapeutics etoposide (Et) and epirubicin (Ep), using in 
vitro models of thyroid cancer. The research employed two representative cell 
lines: B-CPAP (poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma) and SW-1736 (anaplastic 
thyroid carcinoma). Through comprehensive experimental approaches, including MTT 
viability assays, flow cytometry-based apoptosis and cell cycle analysis, and 
scratch wound migration assays, we systematically evaluated the compounds' 
effects.
RESULTS: The results revealed distinct pharmacological profiles: The RA 
demonstrated superior cytotoxicity with significantly lower IC50 values (3.01 
µg/mL for B-CPAP and 1.83 µg/mL for SW) compared to VA (407.29 µg/mL and 584.32 
µg/mL, respectively). Importantly, RA exhibited strong synergistic effects when 
combined with Et/Ep [Combination Index (CI) < 1], while VA showed primarily 
additive or antagonistic interactions (CI ≥ 1). Mechanistically, RA combined 
with low-dose Et/Ep (1/5 IC50) significantly enhanced early apoptosis rates (P < 
0.05) and induced S-phase cell cycle arrest, effects not observed with VA 
combinations. In migration assays, RA completely inhibited cancer cell movement 
(100% inhibition), outperforming VA's partial inhibition (40 - 70%).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings collectively demonstrate RA's potent anticancer 
activity and its ability to synergize with conventional chemotherapeutics, 
highlighting its potential as a promising candidate for combination therapy in 
thyroid cancer treatment. The study provides compelling preclinical evidence 
supporting further investigation of RA-based therapeutic strategies through 
advanced preclinical studies and clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) offer a comprehensive approach 
to managing malignant tumors.
OBJECTIVES: The present study aims to predict the high-frequency herbs, core 
components, and core targets for liver cancer treatment through data mining and 
network pharmacology.
METHODS: The ""traditional Chinese Medicine - active components - target - 
disease"" network was established using Cytoscape to identify core components. A 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING 
database, and Cytoscape was used for network topological analysis to identify 
the core targets. Subsequently, molecular docking was performed using AutoDock 
Vina and PyMOL to calculate binding energies of core components with core 
targets. Furthermore, in vitro experiments explored quercetin's impact on liver 
cancer cell migration, apoptosis, and protein expression.
RESULTS: A total of 50 high-frequency drugs were selected. Among these, 
Atractylodes macrocephala koidz, Astragalus membranaceus, Scutellaria barbata, 
and Cremastra appendiculata were high-frequency drugs for invigorating qi and 
heat-clearing in liver cancer treatment. There were 226 common targets of herbal 
medicine for liver cancer treatment. Based on the degree value, beta-sitosterol, 
kaempferol, stigmasterol, and luteolin potentially represented core components. 
Eight key targets, including JUN, MAPK1, RELA, TNF, ESR1, IL-6, TP53, and FOS, 
were screened out, which were involved in 417 entries and 159 pathways. 
Molecular docking verified a strong binding affinity of the key compounds to the 
core targets. In vitro experiments showed that quercetin induced apoptosis and 
inhibited migration activity of HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner by 
affecting the expression levels of p-c-Jun/c-Jun and c-Fos proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a foundational basis for future clinical 
application of TCMs in liver cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is among the most prevalent malignancies affecting 
women globally. This study examines the anti-tumor effects and mechanisms of 
Hedyotis diffusa Willd (HDW), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, on cervical 
cancer.
METHODS: The effects of HDW on the proliferation and migration of SiHa and CaSki 
cells were evaluated through in vitro assays. Additionally, the anti-tumor 
activity of HDW was assessed in vivo using a xenograft mouse model. To further 
explore its potential mechanisms, the effects of HDW on apoptosis, the cell 
cycle, and the IL-17/NF-κB signaling pathway were analyzed.
RESULTS: In vitro, HDW dose-dependently reduced the proliferation, colony 
formation, and migration of SiHa and CaSki cervical cancer cells (P < 0.01). It 
induced apoptosis by modulating the expression of BCL2, BAX, caspase 3, and 
cleaved-caspase 3, and caused S-phase cell cycle arrest through suppression of 
CDK2 and cyclin A (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Hedyotis diffusa Willd also inhibited 
the IL-17/NF-κB signaling pathway by reducing IL-17A and phosphorylated NF-κB 
p65 expression (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). In vivo, HDW significantly inhibited 
tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model (n = 5), with no signs of systemic 
toxicity, as demonstrated by stable body weight.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that HDW exerts its anti-tumor effects by 
inducing apoptosis, causing cell cycle arrest, and inhibiting the IL-17/NF-κB 
signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a promising therapeutic 
candidate for cervical cancer.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor of pancreatic cancer (PC). We 
aimed to develop risk models to predict PC within 1- and 3-year in new onset 
diabetes mellitus (NODM).
METHODS: We utilized territory-wide electronic healthcare database to identify 
NODM patients [fasting glucose ≥7 mmol/L and/or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥6.5%] 
between 2008 and 2017, and observed for three years until PC development, 
pancreatectomy or death. Outcome of interest was PC at 1- and 3-year. Clinical 
variables included age, sex, acute pancreatitis history, body mass index (BMI), 
blood glucose, lipid profile, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 
alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), hemoglobin and baseline 
medication use {metformin, insulin and other anti-diabetic drugs, aspirin, 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, gastroprotective agents [proton 
pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs)]}. The 
cohort was randomly split (7:3 ratio) into training and testing sets. Logistic 
regression was conducted to identify predictors of PC at 1 and 3 years.
RESULTS: Among 117,121 NODM patients (mean age: 61.63±12.45 years; male: 51.3%), 
189 (0.16%) developed PC within 3-year, with 82 (43.4%) in first year. 
Predictors in 1- and 3-year risk models included age, sex, acute pancreatitis 
history, insulin, aspirin, gastroprotective agents, baseline glucose, eGFR, ALT, 
ALP, and BMI (baseline and change from 1 year prior to baseline). The 1- and 
3-year models had area under receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.90 
and 0.81, respectively. If specificity was set as 99.9%, number-needed-to-screen 
(NNS) for one PC case within 1-year was 27.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated new risk models with high accuracy to 
predict 1- and 3-year PC risk among NODM patients for targeted screening.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of 
cancer-related morbidity and mortality globally. This study aimed to develop and 
validate predictive models for ALN pCR following NAC in breast cancer patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis involving 189 
patients who were diagnosed with primary breast cancer at the Affiliated 
Hospital of Qingdao University. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance 
imaging (DCE-MRI) was utilized to assess the characteristics of the tumors. 
Tumor segmentation was performed using itk-SNAP software, followed by voxel 
clustering to identify distinct habitat-derived regions. Logistic regression 
(LR) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) models were constructed using these 
features.
RESULTS: The classification model incorporating with habitat-based radiomic 
features demonstrating superior predictive performance (AUC of 0.88 in training 
and 0.81 in test for LR). A clinicopathologic signature that includes factors 
such as age, hormone receptor status, the Ki-67 index, and clinical stage was 
established, achieving in an AUC of 0.81. To construct a nomogram, we integrated 
habitat-derived radiomic signature with clinicopathologic signature. This 
nomogram attained an AUC of 0.92 for the training cohort and 0.89 for the test 
cohort. Furthermore, calibration and decision curve analyses confirmed the 
nomogram's reliability and practical applicability in clinical settings.
CONCLUSION: In summary, our results indicate that radiomic features extracted 
from pre-NAC DCE-MRI can improve the predictive accuracy for ALN pCR following 
NAC in individuals diagnosed with breast cancer. This finding highlights the 
promise of personalized treatment strategies for individual patients.

INTRODUCTION: Gastric cancer is a malignant tumor with high incidence and 
mortality rates worldwide, and effective therapeutic strategies targeting its 
complex pathological processes are limited. Caffeic acid is a phenolic compound 
derived from natural plants and has attracted attention for its potential 
anticancer properties; however, its mechanism of action in gastric cancer has 
not been fully elucidated.
METHODS: In this study, a multimodal computational framework integrating 
multiomics, machine learning, and molecular dynamics simulations, combined with 
in vitro experiments, was used to systematically investigate the molecular 
mechanism of caffeic acid against gastric cancer.
RESULTS: Among the predicted targets, FZD2-a major receptor that mediates 
noncanonical WNT/Ca2+ signaling-was identified as a core regulatory hub 
associated with tumor progression and metastasis. Molecular dynamics simulations 
further revealed a stable binding interaction between caffeic acid and FZD2. An 
in vitro EMT model was established by treating human gastric cancer cells with 
TGF-β1. The results showed that caffeic acid intervention inhibited cell 
migration, invasion, and EMT progression while reducing FZD2 protein expression.
DISCUSSION: This study confirmed that caffeic acid regulates FZD2 expression and 
inhibits the activation of the noncanonical Wnt5a/Ca2+/NFAT signaling pathway, 
thereby interfering with gastric cancer-related pathological processes. These 
findings reveal the molecular mechanism of caffeic acid in gastric cancer and 
reflect the value of natural products in cancer research.

Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There exists a 
correlation between certain cancers and dietary factors. Several known 
carcinogens are present in the standard American diet, also known as the Western 
Diet. Additionally, food preparation methods can initiate carcinogenesis. 
Various dietary components, particularly plant-based foods, contain bioactive 
phytochemicals, have demonstrated potential anticancer effects through various 
molecular mechanisms. Consuming a wide variety of these so-called 
""cancer-fighting"" foods may lead to synergism in preventing and slowing cancer 
progression. The nutritional intervention is also beneficial in cancer therapy, 
including avoiding malnutrition and cachexia and alleviating cancer 
therapy-induced symptoms as well as the use of specific diets that may augment 
concomitant therapies. This review aims to explore these concepts and highlight 
the need for their integration into medical school curriculum, particularly 
osteopathic medical education, as nutrition is closely interrelated to the 
whole-person patient care approach. These are fundamental concepts that do not 
gain the recognition they deserve in the typical medical school curriculum, and 
this may be reflected in clinical outcomes if not appropriately addressed. 
Addressing this gap in clinical medicine may reduce the risk of cancer, improve 
patient outcomes, build trust, and decrease the burden of cancer-related 
healthcare costs.

Disparities in cancer outcomes persist among systemically marginalized patients. 
A new racially, ethnically, or linguistically concordant (RELC) model of patient 
navigation (PN) was piloted at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in 2019. An 
explanatory mixed-methods observational study assessed patient-centered outcomes 
of RELC PN, traditional PN, and no PN. Patients from these models completed 
surveys at baseline and follow-up to measure changes in satisfaction, 
discrimination, resilience, stress, trust, and discussion of clinical trials. 
Interviews with patients receiving RELC PN were analyzed using thematic 
analysis. A total of 118 participants completed surveys. Satisfaction with care 
improved by 4.2 points (SD 7.0) on an 18-item 5-point Likert scale for those 
receiving RELC navigation, with no change in traditional or no PN groups. 
Discrimination based on race dropped from 40% (n = 2) to 20% (n = 1) in the RELC 
model. A higher proportion of RELC PN patients (80%; n = 4) discussed clinical 
trials compared to traditional PN (17%; n = 3) and no PN (20% n = 19). Thematic 
analysis of 29 interviews indicated the model was crucial in overcoming racism, 
improving trust, and empowering patients. This study highlights the potential of 
RELC PN to improve patient satisfaction, increase participation in clinical 
trials, and reduce experiences of discrimination.

Lifestyle medicine interventions are well established for the prevention and 
treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and are increasingly applied to people 
with cancer, who face elevated cardiovascular risk from both the disease and its 
treatments. Cardio-oncology, an emerging subspecialty, focuses on prevention, 
management, and treatment of CVD in patients with cancer and survivors. 
Incorporating lifestyle medicine principles-such as physical activity, healthy 
diet, stress management, and social connections-can help mitigate CVD risk in 
this population. This article reviews the impact of cancer and its therapies on 
cardiovascular health, current guideline recommendations, and the importance of 
an interprofessional, holistic approach to individualized care.

BACKGROUND: Stereotactic needle biopsy is frequently indicated for the diagnosis 
of malignant gliomas in initial management and at tumor recurrence. Current 
techniques have a sampling error of 24% and diagnostic errors of 10%-30%. 
Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) distinguishes among types of brain tissue 
according to their intrinsic fluorescence properties. Intraprocedural FLIm has 
been implemented for biopsy guidance.
METHODS: A FLIm imaging system (fiber-optic probe; pulsed excitation: 355 nm; 
avalanche photodiode (APD)-based detection: 470/28 nm, 540/50 nm) linked to a 
stereotactic navigation platform was used to image tissue through the 10-mm side 
opening of a 1-mm-diameter needle during MRI-directed stereotactic biopsy of 5 
suspected malignant gliomas. As the biopsy needle advanced to its targets, FLIm 
data were continuously acquired and displayed in real time. The data were 
analyzed by a classification model (trained with an independent dataset from 364 
specimens from resection margins of 61 malignant gliomas), and displayed as the 
probability of the needle's tip lying within the targeted lesion. Predictions 
from FLIm were compared with biopsy histopathology.
RESULTS: Differences in FLIm-derived parameters (intensity, lifetime, Laguerre 
coefficient) permitted distinguishing lesion (biopsy-confirmed) from uninvolved 
brain (not biopsy-confirmed) with 81% accuracy and an area under the curve of 
88%. Differentiation was better for oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma than for 
nonenhancing glioblastoma and necrosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating FLIm with standard stereotactic biopsy needle and 
workflow could provide real-time guidance in selecting biopsy targets along the 
needle's trajectory, potentially improving diagnostic yield and safety. This 
approach may also aid biopsy of other body tissues and the placement of brain 
probes treating functional disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer represents a heterogeneous group of tumors 
characterized by diverse molecular and clinical features, driven by both genetic 
alterations and epigenetic regulation. Among these mechanisms, the Hedgehog (Hh) 
developmental pathway, particularly elevated levels of its ligand Sonic Hedgehog 
(SHH), has been implicated in breast cancer progression. Methyltransferase-like 
3 (METTL3), the core catalytic component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, 
responsible for N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of mRNA, has shown a 
stronger prognostic relevance in regulating mRNA stability and cancer 
development than other m6A writers, erasers, or readers. Despite evidence 
suggesting that both SHH and METTL3 contribute to tumor growth in breast tissue, 
the functional relationship between these factors remains unclear. In this 
study, we investigated the potential of the METTL3-SHH axis in breast cancer 
progression to address this gap.
METHODS: We have performed bioinformatic analyses by utilizing data from UALCAN, 
cBioPortal, and GEPIA platforms to comprehensively investigate the methylation 
patterns, gene expression levels, and mutation profiles of specific genes of 
interest. Expressions of METTL3 and components of the SHH signaling pathway were 
analyzed by qRT-PCR. Statistical analyses were performed by using Student's 
t-test, Spearman and Pearson coefficient (r) test, ANOVA test, and log-rank 
test.
RESULTS: Analysis of 35 breast cancer patients of Bangladesh and gene expression 
data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 1,021) database revealed METTL3 is 
overexpressed in breast cancer, and upregulation of METTL3 and downstream key 
components of the SHH signaling pathway (p < 0.05 vs. control) correlates 
significantly with worse patient outcomes (HR = 1.3). These findings suggest a 
possible regulatory mechanism linking METTL3-mediated m6A modification to SHH 
signaling in breast cancer progression. Elucidating this axis could provide 
novel insights into tumor biology and identify promising targets for epigenetic 
therapies.

Despite the improved clinical outcomes resulting from the use of sorafenib, the 
development of resistance mechanisms continues to undermine its treatment 
efficacy. Recent studies have implicated the role of a phospholipid mediator, 
platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) pathway, and extracellular vesicles 
known as microvesicle particles (MVP) in influencing cellular behavior and the 
efficacy of therapeutic agents. In this study, we determined the impact of the 
PAFR pathway and the acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase), which is required for the 
biogenesis of MVP, on sorafenib-induced effects on lung cancer growth and MVP 
release. Using A549 and H1299 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, we 
showed that sorafenib treatment reduced cell viability in a dose and 
time-dependent manner. Notably, sorafenib also enhanced MVP formation in both 
NSCLC cell lines. This MVP release was significantly attenuated by pharmacologic 
inhibition of the PAFR pathway through the WEB2086 compound and the aSMase 
inhibitor, imipramine, indicating the involvement of the PAFR and aSMase in 
sorafenib-induced MVP biogenesis. Moreover, co-treatment with imipramine 
enhanced the cytotoxic effects of sorafenib, suggesting that targeting 
MVP-associated pathways may improve sorafenib response. Collectively, these 
findings offer mechanistic insight into how sorafenib modulates MVP release and 
supports the therapeutic potential of combining tyrosine kinase inhibitors with 
agents that disrupt MVP biogenesis in NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION: Metastasis remains the primary cause of mortality in breast 
cancer, particularly in aggressive triple-negative (TNBC) subtypes. A crucial 
yet understudied aspect of this process involves cancer cell survival in a 
detached state and subsequent reattachment at distant sites. While in vitro 
models can capture early detachment events like tumor budding, the subsequent 
reattachment phase is often overlooked. To address this, we developed a TNBC 
cell model that effectively mimics metastatic behavior following re-attachment 
at secondary locations.
METHODS: We generated clones of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells through consecutive 
selection for enhanced anchorage-independent survival. This was achieved using 
2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) alone, 2DG combined with metformin, or 
Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (polyHEMA)-coated surfaces. The resulting 
adapted clones were characterized by RNA transcriptomics, comparing them to 
one-time treated non-selected cells. Real-time cellular energy metabolism was 
assessed via Seahorse analysis, while mitochondrial mass and intracellular 
localization were determined by flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy, 
respectively.
RESULTS: Transcriptomic analysis of the MDA-MB-231 clones adapted to 
anchorage-independent growth revealed distinct alterations in gene expression, 
confirmed by principal component analysis showing clear separation from control 
clusters. These adapted clones exhibited increased mesenchymal and stemness 
markers, downregulated cell cycle genes, and a senescent-like phenotype. 
Interestingly, while nuclear-encoded oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) genes 
were downregulated, mitochondrial-encoded OxPhos genes were upregulated, with no 
significant shift in overall ATP production as measured by Seahorse analysis. 
Paradoxically, despite increased CD274 (PD-L1) transcription, surface PD-L1 
expression was consistently reduced, likely due to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
stress and impaired N-glycosylation.
DISCUSSION: Our adapted clones provide a novel in vitro model of early 
metastatic behavior, unveiling a cancer cell survival strategy that balances 
energy metabolism with adaptation to stress. These clones also demonstrated 
enhanced detachment properties and upregulation of proto-oncogenes, in addition 
to their senescent-like phenotype. Critically, the uncoupling of CD274 
transcription from surface PD-L1 expression suggests a potential therapeutic 
vulnerability that could be exploited in TNBC.

Nanjing Medical University, Huai'an, China.

BACKGROUND: Patients with endometrial cancer bone metastases (ECBM) are 
clinically rare and have a poor prognosis, including a higher incidence of early 
death (survival ≤ 3 months). Currently, no practical tools exist to predict 
early mortality in these patients. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop 
clinically applicable predictive models, such as nomograms, for individualized 
assessment of early death risk in ECBM.
METHODS: Relevant clinical and pathological data for ECBM patients from the SEER 
database (2010-2021). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses 
were performed to identify risk factors associated with early death in ECBM 
patients and to construct prognostic nomograms. ROC analysis, calibration 
curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to assess the predictive 
accuracy and clinical utility of the nomogram model.
RESULTS: A total of 1,201 ECBM patients were found in the SEER database. After 
applying strict exclusion criteria, 769 patients were finally included in this 
study. Patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts in a 
7:3 ratio. The results of univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
analyses revealed several independent predictive factors for early death. For 
both overall early death (OED) and cancer-specific early death (CSED), 
protective factors included surgery (OED: OR = 0.22, 95%CI: 0.12-0.41, p<0.001; 
CSED: OR = 0.33, 95%CI: 0.18-0.61, p<0.001) and chemotherapy (OED: OR = 0.11, 
95%CI: 0.06-0.18, p<0.001; CSED: OR = 0.14, 95%CI: 0.09-0.24, p<0.001). Brain 
metastases increased risk (OED: OR = 2.98, 95%CI: 1.29-6.87, p=0.01; CSED: 
OR = 2.20, 95%CI: 1.04-4.79, p=0.047). Compared to 0-9 days, longer time from 
diagnosis to treatment showed protective associations: 10-27 days (OED: 
OR = 0.51, 95%CI: 0.27-0.98, p=0.042) and ≥28 days (OED: OR = 0.23, 95%CI: 
0.12-0.44, p<0.001; CSED: OR = 0.30, 95%CI: 0.16-0.56, p<0.001). Regarding 
histological type, compared to endometrioid subtype, sarcomatous subtype 
significantly increased OED risk (OR = 3.04, 95%CI: 1.40-6.57, p=0.005), while 
radiotherapy reduced CSED risk (OR = 0.55, 95%CI: 0.33-0.92, p=0.022). Based on 
these variables, nomograms were developed to predict the risk of early death. 
The ROC curve confirmed the model's high predictive accuracy, while the 
calibration curve showed strong alignment between predicted and actual survival. 
DCA further demonstrated its clinical utility.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we developed robust nomogram models to predict the 
probability of early death in ECBM patients.

BACKGROUND: For breast cancer, developing non-invasive methods to accurately 
predict axillary lymph node (ALN) status before surgery has become a general 
trend. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a nomogram to predict the 
probability of ALN metastasis (ALNM) preoperatively based on clinicopathological 
and ultrasonography (US) features.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with breast cancer by preoperative histopathologic 
biopsy in West China Hospital from 1 August, 2022 to 31 January, 2024 and 
undergoing surgical treatment with preoperative US in West China Hospital were 
prospectively included. Preoperative clinicopathological and US features, along 
with postoperative pathological ALN status, were collected. Patients included 
were randomly divided into a training set and a test set (7:3). In the training 
cohort, the independent predictors of ALNM were obtained by univariate and 
multivariate binary logistic regression analyses and were used to develop a 
binary logistic regression model presented as a nomogram. Model performance was 
evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, 
and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: A total of 610 patients were included for analysis: 427 in the training 
set and 183 in the test set. Molecular subtypes, tumor infiltration of the 
subcutaneous layer, tumor infiltration of the retromammary space, lymph node 
(LN) short axis, LN long/short (L/S) axis ratio, LN corticomedullary 
demarcation, and LN cortical thickness evenness were independent predictors of 
ALNM. The nomogram showed good discrimination with an area under the ROC curve 
(AUC) of 0.854 for the training set and 0.822 for the test set, presented good 
agreement between predicted and observed probabilities, and acquired net benefit 
across a wide threshold range.
CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram demonstrated strong discrimination, calibration, and 
clinical net benefit to assist clinical decisions.

BACKGROUND: Rezvilutamide combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has 
become a first-line standard regimen for high-volume metastatic 
hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), but real-world evidence from China 
remains limited.
METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective real-world cohort study enrolling 
high-volume mHSPC patients diagnosed and treated with rezvilutamide plus ADT at 
multiple tertiary hospitals in China from August 2023 to March 2025. Baseline 
demographics, tumor burden, treatment regimen, and follow-up data were 
collected. The primary endpoints were 3-month PSA responses (PSA50, PSA90, PSA 
≤0.2 ng/mL), subgroup efficacy, and adverse event rates. Multivariable logistic 
regression was used to identify independent predictors for achieving PSA ≤0.2 
ng/mL at 3 months. Efficacy and safety outcomes were compared with major 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and other real-world studies.
RESULTS: A total of 236 patients with high-volume mHSPC were enrolled, with a 
median age of 74.9 years. The rates of achieving PSA50, PSA90, and PSA ≤0.2 
ng/mL at 3 months were 99.15%, 88.98%, and 39.41%, respectively. Subgroup 
analysis showed consistent efficacy across age, ECOG, and Gleason strata, with 
only lower baseline PSA predicting higher likelihood of undetectable PSA. 
Multivariable analysis further indicated that baseline PSA showed a trend toward 
being an independent predictor for achieving PSA ≤0.2 ng/mL (P=0.063). The 
incidence of any-grade and grade 3-4 adverse events was 65% and 23%, 
respectively, with no new severe safety signals observed. All results were 
highly consistent with RCTs such as CHART.
CONCLUSION: Rezvilutamide plus ADT provides rapid and profound PSA responses 
with a favorable safety profile in real-world Chinese patients with high-volume 
mHSPC. Baseline PSA serves as an important predictor for short-term biochemical 
response, supporting its clinical value as a standard first-line therapy.

Cancer is a growing public health concern in low- and middle-income countries 
(LMICs), influenced by cultural practices, environmental exposures, and 
dependence on traditional medicine in addition to biological risk factors. 
Evidence from peer-reviewed publications published between 2010 and 2025 was 
combined in this narrative review. According to studies, traditional and 
complementary medicine (T&CM) is used by 35% to 79% of cancer patients in LMICs, 
which frequently delays biomedical treatment and complicates care. Over 2.4 
billion people use biomass fuels for household air pollution (HAP), which has 
been associated with a two- to three-fold increased risk of lung cancer, 
especially in women. Furthermore, tobacco smoking contributes to about 2.7 
million new cases of cancer in less developed areas each year, highlighting 
ongoing exposure to avoidable dangers. Findings show that the cancer burden in 
LMICs is further exacerbated by poor food storage, alcohol use, pesticide 
exposure, unregulated consumer chemicals, and stigma. These cultural and 
environmental factors must be addressed in preventative initiatives in addition 
to biological therapy. Strengthening T&CM regulations, enhancing food safety, 
upholding alcohol and tobacco legislation, lowering exposures at work and in the 
home, and introducing culturally-based education to dispel stigma and myths are 
among the top priorities. This is a narrative review rather than a systematic 
one; the goal is to map thematic evidence throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin 
America, providing insights for policy design. Integrated, context-specific, and 
community-driven approaches are required to eliminate inequities and promote 
equitable cancer control in LMICs.

Super-enhancer DNA methylation in cancer: the mechanism of action and 
therapeutic directions.

Shandong, China.

The interplay between DNA methylation and super-enhancer activity is emerging as 
a key focus in cancer research. Super-enhancers, a specialized class of 
enhancers, strongly activate transcription of their target genes due to their 
dense clustering with essential transcription factors (TFs) and cofactors. In 
cancer, especially, these super-enhancers control key oncogenic drivers and 
often display abnormal DNA methylation patterns that can repress or overexpress 
target genes in both solid and blood cancers. Furthermore, DNA methylation in 
the super-enhancer region has been found to influence their regulatory capacity. 
Although enhancers are typically characterized by low DNA methylation, 
dysregulated methylation at super-enhancers is seen in most malignancies, 
affecting TF and chromatin regulator recruitment. Hypomethylation at these sites 
often accompanies oncogene hyperactivation, while hypermethylation can repress 
tumor suppressor mechanisms. Recent research highlights DNA methylation as a 
promising source of cancer biomarkers. This review examines the intricate 
relationship between DNA methylation and super-enhancer activity in cancer, 
concentrating on how methylation regulates super-enhancers, modulates oncogene 
expression, promotes oncogenesis, and serves as a target for novel oncology 
therapies.

Trimodality therapy (TMT), including transurethral resection (TUR), chemotherapy 
(CT), and radiotherapy (RT), offers the bladder-preserving treatment option for 
patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). TMT, once indicated, has 
demonstrated effective and favorable local tumor control in MIBC, with complete 
response rates ranging between 50% and 80%. However, residual tumor is 
identified on follow-up TUR in approximately 20-30% of patients, and tumor 
recurrence occurs in a similar proportion. In both situations, the prognosis 
becomes unfavorable. This manuscript reviews the current evidence regarding 
recurrence patterns after TMT, differentiating between non-muscle-invasive 
(NMIBC) and muscle-invasive (MIBC) relapses. NMIBC recurrences after TMT are 
often manageable with conservative treatments like repeat TURBT and intravesical 
BCG, without negatively impacting survival. In contrast, MIBC recurrences 
typically require salvage cystectomy in fit patients, offering outcomes similar 
to primary surgery. For those unfit for or who continue to decline cystectomy, 
treatment remains uncertain due to the absence of clear guidelines, and systemic 
therapies used in metastatic urothelial carcinoma seem commonly applied by 
extrapolation.

Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer death in people living with HIV 
(PLWH) and disproportionately affects this group regardless of CD4 count. At the 
Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) at Jefferson Health, we treat 
an underserved PLWH population with LC and aim to study their clinical course, 
as they are often excluded from LC trials. We retrospectively reviewed 36 PLWH 
diagnosed with LC at Jefferson Health from 2016 to 2023. We found that 24 
patients were male, 20 patients were Black, and that the median age of LC 
diagnosis is 66 years (range 38-83 years). 27 patients had non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) (20 adenocarcinoma, 7 squamous), 3 had small cell lung cancer 
(SCLC). 24 patients had undetectable viral loads, and 35 patients were on 
antiviral therapy. Advanced-stage disease was seen in 32 patients, with a 
1.3-year OS (95% CI: 0.8-3.8 years). Of 18 patients with molecular testing 
available, 4 had KRAS mutations, and 1 had targetable EGFR mutations. Of 16 
tested for PD-L1, 8 patients had 1-49% expression, and 1 patient had >50%. Our 
cohort showed more advanced disease at presentation, younger age at diagnosis, 
and poor OS despite most patients having undetectable HIV viral loads on 
antiviral therapy, suggesting a link between well-controlled HIV and aggressive 
LC that warrants further study.

BACKGROUND: Outcomes of non-metastatic non-inflammatory breast cancer (non-IBC) 
and inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) in Moroccan women remain poorly defined. 
The aim of this study was to compare patient demographics, tumor 
characteristics, and survival outcomes between women with operable non-IBC and 
those with non-metastatic IBC in Morocco.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 472 patients diagnosed with 
non-metastatic non-IBC (n=400) or non-metastatic IBC (n=72) and treated at the 
National Institute of Oncology, Rabat. Non-IBC patients were included between 
January 2001 and December 2003, whereas IBC patients were included between 
January 2007 and December 2008.
RESULTS: The median age of patients was 45.8 years (range, 22-91 years). The 
majority of patients were diagnosed at AJCC stage III or higher (61%), and 72.7% 
presented with lymph node involvement. Approximately 95% of patients completed 
multimodal therapy including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Mastectomy 
and breast-conserving surgery were performed in 82% and 12.9% of cases, 
respectively. Radiotherapy was delivered to 95.1% of patients. After a mean 
follow-up of 54.6 months (range, 1-101 months), 5-year disease-free survival 
(DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 75.3% and 80.5%, respectively. At 
3-years, OS was significantly lower in the IBC cohort (59.2%) compared with the 
non-IBC cohort (91.4%) (p<0.0001). Moreover, OS at 3 years was significantly 
lower in IBC patients compared with stage III non-IBC patients (p<0.001). 
However, when treated with multimodal therapy, survival outcomes were similar 
between IBC and stage III non-IBC patients. In the overall population, 
prognostic analysis showed that positive lymph node status (OS and DFS: 
p<0.001), advanced T stage (pT4 vs. pT1-pT3, OS: p=0.078, DFS: p<0.001), and 
AJCC stage (stage III-IBC vs. stage III non-IBC vs. stage I-II, OS and DFS: 
p<0.0001) were predictive of poorer OS and DFS.
CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer in Moroccan women exhibited more aggressive behavior, 
with diagnosis often occurring at younger ages and more advanced stages. IBC 
patients had significantly worse outcomes compared with stage III non-IBC 
patients. Our findings underscore the importance of multimodal treatment, 
surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, in improving survival, particularly for 
stage III and IBC patients. Early-stage (I-II) disease was associated with 
favorable outcomes.

Jiangsu, China.

PURPOSE: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality, especially among 
immunocompromised patients with lung cancer. We aimed to establish machine 
learning (ML) based model to accurately forecast ICU mortality in patients with 
sepsis combined lung cancer.
METHODS: We incorporated patients with sepsis combined lung cancer from Medical 
Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) database. Univariate and 
multivariate logistic analysis were employed to select variables. Recursive 
Feature Elimination (RFE) method based on 6 ML algorithms was used for feature 
selection. We harnessed 13 ML algorithms to construct prediction model, which 
were assessed by area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, 
precision, cross-entropy and Brier scores. The best ML model was constructed to 
predict ICU mortality, and the predictive results were interpretated by SHapley 
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework.
RESULTS: A sum of 1096 lung cancer patients combined sepsis from MIMIC IV 
database and 251 patients from the external validation set were included. We 
utilized 13 clinical variables to establish prediction model for ICU mortality. 
CatBoost model was identified as the prime prediction model with the highest AUC 
in the training (0.931 [0.921, 0.945]), internal validation (0.698 [0.673, 
0.724]) and external validation (0.794 [0.725, 0.879]) cohorts. Oxford Acute 
Severity of Illness Score (OASIS) had the greatest influence on ICU mortality 
according to SHAP interpretation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our ML models demonstrate excellent accuracy and reliability, 
facilitating more rigorous personalized prognostic forecast to lung cancer 
patients combined sepsis.

The coexistence of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and primary gastrointestinal 
(GI) malignancies is an exceptionally rare phenomenon that complicates diagnosis 
and treatment. We conducted a systematic review of published case reports to 
better understand the clinical characteristics, therapeutic approaches, and 
outcomes of these patients. A comprehensive search of major databases up to 
April 2025 identified six eligible reports describing patients diagnosed with 
both SCLC and distinct GI cancers, including gastric, duodenal, rectal, and 
jejunal tumors, as well as one patient with multiple primary malignancies 
involving rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate 
adenocarcinoma in addition to SCLC. The patients were predominantly older males 
with heavy smoking histories, and most cases were extensive-stage SCLC at 
presentation. Treatment varied widely and included platinum-based chemotherapy, 
immune checkpoint inhibitors, EGFR-targeted therapy, surgery, and supportive 
care, with clinical outcomes ranging from a few months to more than one year of 
survival. Several patients showed partial or complete responses to systemic 
therapy, and in one case, the GI malignancy regressed following chemotherapy 
given for SCLC, suggesting overlapping chemosensitivity. However, other patients 
experienced delayed diagnosis of the second malignancy or limited survival due 
to disease progression or comorbidities. This synthesis demonstrates that 
distinguishing dual primaries from metastatic disease is a critical challenge in 
clinical practice and highlights the need for thorough evaluation in patients 
with atypical or persistent symptoms. Although data remain limited, awareness of 
this rare coexistence may help clinicians avoid misclassification and tailor 
multidisciplinary treatment strategies to improve outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The detection of tumor markers for predicting the therapeutic 
efficacy is relatively rare at present. The combined elevation of 
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA19-9, CA72-4, and CA125 and others may predict 
the efficacy of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy, which is helpful for 
the precise screening of patients. This study aimed to investigate the 
correlation between serum tumor marker expression and clinical features, 
including stage, differentiation, primary site, and metastatic diameter. It also 
examined the relationship between tumor marker levels and the therapeutic 
efficacy in advanced gastric cancer patients.
METHODS: We analyzed 327 patients with gastric or esophagogastric junction 
adenocarcinoma at Henan Provincial People's Hospital. CEA, CA19-9, CA125, and 
CA72-4 levels were categorized as negative, single-marker elevated, or 
multiple-marker (≥2) elevated. Clinical features and survival outcomes were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: Elevated marker numbers correlated significantly with advanced clinical 
stage, lower differentiation, Lauren classification type, and larger metastatic 
diameter. Patients with stage IV disease exhibited higher marker elevations than 
those with earlier stages. No significant association was observed between the 
number of tumor elevated markers and T/N stage, primary/metastatic site, or 
PD-L1 combined positive score >5. After first-line chemotherapy, the objective 
response rate was positively correlated with elevated tumor marker numbers, 
single- rather than multiple-marker elevation showed better progression-free 
survival. In immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy, any increase in a tumor 
marker ≥5 times with a total metastasis diameter <6 cm, indicating better 
short-term efficacy.
CONCLUSION: Elevated serum tumor markers are associated with higher tumor 
burden, advanced stage, and poorer differentiation in gastric cancer, 
potentially serving as disease severity and treatment response predictors.

INTRODUCTION: Accurate lymph node (LN) retrieval is vital for colorectal cancer 
(CRC) staging and determining adjuvant therapy.
METHODS: In this prospective study of 122 CRC specimens, we evaluated LN 
retrieval times, discrepancies between gross and microscopic LN counts, and the 
impact of neoadjuvant therapy.
RESULTS: On average, dissecting each specimen took 50 min (range 15-295 min), 
with rectal and descending/sigmoid colon specimens often requiring multiple 
passes. Macroscopic dissection yielded an average of 45.1 LNs per specimen, 
whereas microscopic examination confirmed only 35.7 LNs on average. Neoadjuvant 
therapy did not alter macroscopic yields (p = 0.105), yet significantly reduced 
microscopic LN counts (p = 2.676 × 105). T-stage correlated with total 
microscopic LN counts (p = 0.018) but not the number of cancer-positive nodes (p 
= 0.140). Rectal specimens showed the largest discrepancy between macroscopic 
and microscopic LN counts; in contrast, 8 specimens had higher microscopic than 
macroscopic counts, suggesting that some LNs were missed during manual palpation 
but detected microscopically in the extra submitted sections of mesenteric 
tissue. Overall, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was 50.18%, rising to 
97.87% for neoadjuvant-treated cases. The average pathology report turnaround 
time (TAT) was 3.3 business days, meeting the recommended 4-days threshold, with 
no significant delay due to cancer location or additional LN searches. A 
preliminary cost analysis indicates that missed or misidentified LNs can 
increase histology processing and pathologist review expenses, emphasizing the 
need for more efficient LN search protocols.
DISCUSSION: Taken together, these findings emphasize the multifactorial nature 
of LN retrieval challenges, particularly in neoadjuvant-treated and anatomically 
complex cases. Refining dissection protocols, leveraging new technologies, and 
allocating adequate resources may help reduce retrieval errors, potentially 
improving staging accuracy and clinical decision-making.

BACKGROUND: Preoperative prehabilitation represents a viable approach to improve 
postoperative recovery and quality of life in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, 
though debates persist regarding the efficacy of specific prehabilitation 
modalities.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare and rank prehabilitation strategies for 
enhancing postoperative outcomes in CRC patients through a network 
meta-analysis, identifying the optimal preoperative prehabilitation method.
METHODS: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing four 
prehabilitation strategies in CRC patients. Outcome measures focused on 
postoperative complications, hospital stay duration, 6-min walk test, and states 
of anxiety and depression. The effect sizes for dichotomous outcomes were 
measured by odds ratios (OR), and for continuous outcomes by mean differences 
(MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD), with 95% credible intervals (CrIs).
RESULTS: Our analysis included 27 RCTs involving 2,946 CRC patients. NMA results 
indicated that, compared to the control group (CON), only the multimodal (Mul) 
approach significantly reduced postoperative complications (OR: 0.47, 95%CrI: 
0.26-0.85) and hospitalization time (MD: -1.17, 95CrI: -1.77 to -0.57). 
Moreover, Mul was the only strategy that improved pre-surgical 6-min walk test 
results (MD: 27.22, 95CrI: 12.71-41.73) and anxiety levels (SMD: -0.69, 95CrI: 
-1.34 to -0.04), with sustained improvements in the 6-min walk test observed up 
to 4 weeks post-surgery (MD: 19.22, 95CrI: 5.94-32.50).
CONCLUSION: The Mul prehabilitation program is the effective strategy for 
improving surgical outcomes in CRC patients. This comprehensive approach not 
only aids in reducing postoperative complications and shortening hospital stays 
but also enhances physical and psychological readiness before surgery.

INTRODUCTION: Hepcidin (Hep), a key regulatory hormone of iron (Fe) homeostasis, 
governs its absorption and storage, and is influenced by inflammation and Fe 
status. This study investigated serum Hep concentrations and their associations 
with Fe markers and inflammation in patients with sporadic colorectal cancer 
(CRC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared serum concentrations of Hep, Fe, unsaturated 
and total iron binding capacity, transferrin, transferrin saturation, ferritin, 
C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor markers in 82 CRC 
patients and 58 controls. Statistically significant differences were tested 
using the Mann-Whitney U test and Student's t test. Additionally, Hep were 
analyzed according to tumor stage. Colorectal cancer was confirmed 
histopathologically after colonoscopy with biopsy (TNM staging).
RESULTS: Colorectal cancer patients exhibited significantly lower Hep 
concentrations than controls (8.1 vs. 19.7 ng/mL, P = 0.020). Ferritin was also 
lower in CRC (109 vs. 250 µg/L, P = 0.002). Hepcidin showed the strongest 
positive correlation with ferritin in CRC. Inflammatory markers (CRP and IL-6) 
correlated moderately to weakly with hepcidin in both groups (controls: rho = 
0.52 (P < 0.001); CRC: rho = 0.26 (P = 0.022) for CRP and CRC: rho = 0.30 (P = 
0.033) for IL-6). Notably, Hep concentrations were lower in patients with 
advanced tumor stage (T0 vs. T3, P = 0.043).
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that CRC is associated with lower hepcidin 
and ferritin concentrations, potentially reflecting complex and cancer-specific 
dysregulation in Fe metabolism beyond inflammation alone.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the correlation between the minimum 
testosterone (T) level achieved during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for 
advanced prostate cancer and progression and prognosis. And to establish the new 
recommended threshold for defining castration-level testosterone.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 425 patients with advanced 
prostate cancer undergoing ADT. Patients were stratified into three groups based 
on their lowest testosterone level: castration low<10 ng/dL, castration 10-50 
ng/dL, Non-castrated >50 ng/dL. To further explore subgroup progression and 
survival differences in low castrated testosterone levels, those castrated low 
testosterone levels were divided into two groups, castration ultra-low 5-10 
ng/dL and castration extreme low<5ng/dL. Additionally, a small cohort (N = 29) 
of surgically castrated patients was included for subgroup analysis. 
Correlations between the minimum testosterone level and outcomes, time to 
progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Significant differences in TTP were observed among the three groups 
(P<0.001), and both two groups (P<0.001). The castration low T level group had 
TTP of 24.62 ± 13.62 months and the lowest percentage of TTP<18 months (33.88%), 
the castration T level group had TTP of 15.65 ± 9.16 months with the second 
highest percentage of TTP<18 months (64.34%), the non-castrated T level group 
had TTP of 10.93 ± 7.89 months with the highest percentage of TTP<18 months 
(83.33%). There was a significant difference in survival rates between the three 
groups (P<0.001). Differences were found between the both two groups (P<0.01), 
with the castration low T level group demonstrating superior 3- and 5-year 
survival rates compared to the other groups. The non-castrated T level group had 
the worst prognosis. No significant differences in TTP or survival rates were 
observed between the castration ultra-low and extreme-low T subgroups. However, 
surgically castrated patients exhibited the poorest prognosis. Minimum 
testosterone level was weakly negatively correlated with TTP (r = -0.32, P< 
0.001), but not significantly correlated with OS.
CONCLUSION: Challenging the traditional castration standard, this study 
identifies 10 ng/dL (versus 50 ng/dL) as the critical testosterone threshold for 
evaluating tumor progression and prognosis in advanced prostate cancer patients 
on ADT.

Center, College of Medicine, Eulji University, Republic of Korea.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative analgesia after oral cancer surgery with free-flap 
reconstruction is complex because pain arises at both donor and recipient sites 
and likely varies by flap type. Evidence of flap-specific, time-resolved pain 
and related patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) behaviors is limited.
METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort included 127 adults who 
underwent no flap (n = 53), latissimus dorsi(LD; n = 12), fibula (n = 18), 
forearm (n = 30), or other flaps (n = 14). Visual analog scale (VAS) scores were 
recorded for overall pain (0-72 h), recipient-site pain (0-72 h), and donor-site 
pain (12-72 h). Intravenous PCA consisted of fentanyl (700 or 1400 mcg) plus 
ketorolac (150 mg). PCA logs provided demand counts, effective deliveries, and 
infused volumes. Group comparisons were performed using repeated-measures 
analyses with post hoc tests.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. Overall VAS 
scores differed at most time points from 0 to 72 h (all P ≤ 0.013); the fibula 
group started higher and declined thereafter. Recipient-site pain showed no 
between-group difference at 60 h but diverged at 72 h (P = 0.026). Donor site 
pain showed no overall difference, although the fibula tended to remain higher 
at 12-24 h. In the LD subgroup, recipient-site VAS scores increased again after 
48 h. Total anesthesia time differed markedly and was longest in LD cases (P < 
0.001). Among flap patients, fentanyl concentration (700 vs. 1400 mcg) did not 
differ by flap type. Seventy-two-hour cumulative PCA metrics did not differ 
between groups; however, effective deliveries were higher during the early 12-24 
h window (12 h, P = 0.043; 24 h, P = 0.010). At 12 h, endotracheal tube 
discomfort exceeded recipient- and donor-site pain (Friedman χ2 = 42.71, P < 
0.001).
CONCLUSION: Flap-specific, time-dependent pain trajectories were 
identified-early higher pain in fibula and later recipient- or donor-persistence 
in LD flaps. Early differences in PCA deliveries were not reflected in 72-h 
totals, indicating a partial dissociation between VAS intensity and 
analgesic-seeking behavior. These findings support flap-tailored multimodal 
analgesia and time-resolved PCA adjustments, with attention to airway-related 
discomfort early after surgery.

Progression through the mammalian cell cycle is a highly regulated process to 
maintain tissue homeostasis. The key regulators of cell cycle transitions are 
cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)/Cyclin complexes that phosphorylate substrates 
such as the RB tumor suppressor to facilitate cellular division. The regulation 
of G1/S is of particular significance in cancer and is affected by numerous 
tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Historically, the cell cycle was viewed as a 
rigidly regulated process, but recent evidence has revealed significant 
flexibility and differential CDK/Cyclin dependencies across tumor types. These 
heterogeneous features of cell cycle control have implications for the etiology 
of different tumor types as well as the response to multiple therapeutic 
modalities. Most notably, adaptive responses in cell cycle regulatory circuits 
can contribute to acquired resistance in a variety of contexts, underscoring the 
importance for tumor biology and disease treatment.

Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is widely used for early esophageal 
cancer, even in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC). Corticosteroids, 
administered orally or by local injection, are often used to prevent post-ESD 
esophageal stricture. However, their safety in patients with decompensated LC 
and refractory ascites remains unclear. A man in his 70s with alcohol-related 
decompensated LC and refractory ascites underwent ESD for subcircumferential 
superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma located on esophageal varices. To 
prevent post-ESD stricture, both oral prednisolone and local triamcinolone were 
administered. Ascites worsened significantly, and large-volume paracentesis was 
performed. Subsequently, the patient developed a mural thrombus in the superior 
mesenteric vein and non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia, leading to bowel 
perforation and death on day 51 post-ESD. In LC patients with refractory 
ascites, oral corticosteroids may exacerbate ascites and increase thrombotic 
risk, potentially leading to fatal complications. This case highlights the need 
for careful risk-benefit assessment of subcircumferential ESD in vulnerable 
cirrhotic patients.

A 49-year-old male developed liver dysfunction during chemotherapy for rectal 
cancer located in the rectosigmoid region. Although magnetic resonance 
cholangiopancreatography initially indicated sclerosing cholangitis, endoscopic 
retrograde cholangiopancreatography and intraductal ultrasonography revealed 
multiple non-contiguous intraductal masses. Histopathological analysis confirmed 
distal bile duct metastasis from rectal cancer, characterized by papillary 
intraductal lesions. The distribution and morphology of the tumors suggested 
implantation via bile flow or hematogenous dissemination through the peribiliary 
capillary plexus. Extrahepatic bile duct metastasis from colorectal cancer is 
exceptionally rare and poses significant diagnostic challenges. This report 
presents a rare case of distal bile duct metastasis detected during chemotherapy 
for rectal cancer, where endoscopic imaging was instrumental in establishing the 
diagnosis.

Kochi Oxydol-Radiation Therapy for Unresectable Carcinomas (KORTUC) is a novel 
radiosensitizing treatment developed in Japan that involves intratumoral 
injections of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hyaluronate (HA). KORTUC II, 
an evolved form of the therapy, aims to enhance radiotherapy efficacy by locally 
increasing oxygen tension and inhibiting antioxidant enzymes in the tumor 
microenvironment. This study retrospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy 
of KORTUC-based breast-conserving therapy (KORTUC-BCT) in patients with stage 
0-IIIC primary breast cancer who refused standard treatment protocols. A total 
of 50 patients who underwent KORTUC-BCT between February 2013 and April 2022 and 
had at least 1 year of follow-up were included. Radiotherapy consisted of 
short-course tangential irradiation at a dose of 44 Gy in 16 fractions. For 
patients with lymph node metastases, the supraclavicular region was included in 
the radiation field. A boost dose of 9-12 Gy was subsequently delivered to the 
tumor using electron-beam radiation therapy. The H2O2/HA sensitizer was 
intratumorally injected twice weekly under ultrasound guidance. All patients 
achieved a clinical complete response within a median evaluation time of 12 
months. The 3-year local control rate for all cases was 89.3%; by stage, it was 
100% for 0-I, 100% for IIA, 53.3% for IIB, 75% for IIIA, 75.0% for IIIB and 100% 
for stage IIIC. The 3-year disease-free survival rate was 75% overall; by stage, 
it was 100% for 0-I, 91.7% for IIA, 53.3% for IIB, 60.0% for IIIA, 75.0% for 
IIIB and 20.0% for IIIC. Lymph node metastasis sites had a 100% 3-year control 
rate. No grade ≥3 adverse events or cosmetic complications were observed. These 
findings suggest that KORTUC-BCT is a minimally invasive and well-tolerated 
therapy with promising outcomes, particularly for patients with early-stage 
breast cancer who decline surgery. This clinical study was registered in the 
UMIN clinical trials registry (UMIN000003734; June 10, 2010).

The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway not only exerts a notable role 
in inflammation and immune modulation but is also considered a key driver in the 
initiation and progression of cancer. NF-κB is closely associated with tumor 
cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, invasion and metastasis, 
indicating its notable role in cancer pathogenesis. Based on research into the 
NF-κB pathway, the present article studied the biochemical processes involved in 
the NF-κB pathway, analyzed potential drug targets and inhibitors and clarified 
therapeutic strategies for targeting NF-κB in cancer treatment. The NF-κB 
signaling pathway consists of both classical and non-classical pathways and 
plays a fundamental role in multiple cancer processes, including cancer cell 
proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, inflammation, tumor microenvironment 
interactions, therapy resistance, ion channel modulation, tumor heterogeneity, 
and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-mediated migration, invasion and 
metastasis. Current therapeutic development has yielded diverse pharmacological 
agents targeting this pathway, including phytochemical-derived NF-κB inhibitors 
and synthetic molecules for cancer therapy.

Cancer cachexia (CC) is a prevalent metabolic disorder in patients with advanced 
cancer, characterized by persistent skeletal muscle mass loss and irreversible 
body weight reduction, which significantly diminishes quality of living, 
therapeutic effectiveness. At present, the specific pathogenesis of CC is only 
defined as skeletal muscle loss induced by signaling pathways. In the clinical 
treatment of tumor cachexia, it has been clearly defined that there are multiple 
methods available for treating this disease, including nutritional therapy and 
exercise, but all of them have very little therapeutic effect. Surprisingly, 
traditional Chinese medicine has achieved initial success in treating malignant 
tumors, and the combined treatment of traditional Chinese and Western medicine 
has yielded remarkable results. Therefore, it is an urgent need to elucidate the 
more specific pathogenesis of CC to develop effective treatment approaches, 
which enhance patients' nutritional health status as well as their overall 
quality of life and survival ratings. This article aims to review the 
pathogenesis of CC along with clinical treatment strategies and drug 
utilization.

Tumor Markers in Predicting Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis of Endometrial 
Cancer.

Medical University, Bengbu, Anhui, 233004, People's Republic of China.

PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical value of vascular cancer thrombus and 
myometrial invasion combined with tumor markers (epididymal protein 4 (HE4), 
carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125), carbohydrate antigen 153 (CA153), carbohydrate 
antigen 199 (CA199)) in predicting sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis of 
Endometrial Cancer (EC).
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 150 patients with EC during 
January 2022 to December 2024. Patients were divided into a metastatic group of 
32 cases and a non-metastatic group of 118 cases. The clinical data and tumor 
markers [HE4, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA125, CA153, CA199 and alpha 
fetoprotein (AFP)] levels were collected. Logistic regression analysis was used 
to identify the influencing factors of metastasis. The predictive value was 
evaluated by Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). Principal component 
analysis (PCA) was performed to analyze the distribution characteristics.
RESULTS: The incidence of vascular cancer thrombus (62.50%), the proportion of 
myometrial invasion ≥1/2 (90.63%) and serum levels of HE4, CA125, CA153 and 
CA199 in the metastatic group were significantly higher than those in the 
non-metastatic group (P<0.05). Vascular cancer thrombus, myometrial invasion ≥ 
1/2, HE4, CA153, CA125 and CA199 were all influencing factors of SLN metastasis 
of EC (P<0.05). The AUC of the combined detection of vascular cancer thrombus, 
myometrial invasion, HE4, CA153, CA125 and CA199 was 0.904, with sensitivity and 
specificity of 85.59% and 84.38%, respectively. The combined detection has a 
high predictive value for SLN metastasis of EC. When the first principal 
component (PC1) was plotted against the second principal component (PC2), 
patients with SLN metastasis had significant disturbances in vascular cancer 
thrombus, myometrial invasion, HE4, CA153, CA125 and CA199. There were 
significant individual differences and dispersed distribution among EC groups, 
while patients without SLN metastasis could cluster well.
CONCLUSION: The combined detection of vascular cancer thrombus, myometrial 
invasion combined with HE4, CA153, CA125 and CA199 can effectively predict SLN 
metastasis of EC. But these influencing factors had great fluctuation and 
uncertainty in patients with SLN metastasis of EC, which may be related to the 
complexity and heterogeneity of the disease.

This study investigated the therapeutic impact of dual immune checkpoint 
inhibition targeting TIGIT and VISTA in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
Current monotherapies have failed to produce consistent and durable responses 
owing to tumor heterogeneity and immune evasion. By evaluating the biological 
and immunomodulatory roles of TIGIT and VISTA, this study provides a rationale 
for their simultaneous blockade. Preclinical models have shown that this dual 
strategy not only revitalizes T-cell function but also alters the suppressive 
tumor microenvironment, leading to improved antitumor immunity in mice. 
Preliminary clinical data suggest potential survival benefits; however, the 
long-term outcomes and resistance dynamics remain uncertain. These findings 
suggest a paradigm shift toward precision-designed, multi-target 
immunotherapies. Future studies should integrate molecular profiling, adaptive 
clinical trial designs, and follow-up models to optimize patient selection and 
sustain therapeutic benefits. See also the graphical abstract(Fig. 1).

Cancer is a multifactorial disease with cellular proliferative molecular 
networks and immune evasion properties. The well-known cancer intra- and 
inter-tumoral heterogeneity presents a notable limitation of the current 
histological and diagnostic techniques. Thus, biasing the risk of invasiveness 
and restricting its broader application in oncology in prognostic, survival, and 
treatment response differences between patients. Monolayer cell cultures have 
been a consistent in vitro model in cancer research throughout time. However, 
this system fails to replicate the complex pathogenesis of this disease, as key 
mechanisms underlying initiation, metastasis, drug resistance, and recurrence 
remain poorly understood. 3D culture models are presented as the most suitable 
model to better reflect the patient's tumor development. Some methods to 
introduce the third dimension into cell cultures is by promoting cell-cell 
interactions to give 3D cell structures, using scaffolds to promote growth 
beyond monolayers and introducing microfluidic platforms to the system. The 
present review provides an overview of different techniques to develop 3D 
culture models in oncology, the advantages compared between monolayer cell 
cultures, their applications, limitations, and applicability in oncology 
research. See also the graphical abstract(Fig. 1).

Esophageal cancer (EC) is a common malignant tumor of the digestive tract with 
poor prognosis and high mortality. The early diagnosis of EC mainly depends on 
endoscopic diagnosis, which not only needs to bear certain economic pressure, 
but also needs patients to recognize the high risk factors of EC. Most EC 
patients are diagnosed at intermediate or late stages, often due to a lack of 
awareness regarding early symptoms and lifestyle-related risk factors. However, 
the discovery of aptamers and the development of nanocarriers bring great 
benefits to the diagnosis, treatment, and targeted drug delivery of EC. Aptamers 
or peptide aptamers as biosensors or therapeutic agents for the diagnosis or 
treatment of EC, aptamer-drug conjugates and aptamer-functionalized drug 
nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery in esophageal cancer are reviewed in 
this paper. In addition, we expect investigators to pay special attention to 
improving aptamer permeability and stability to accelerate aptamer clinical 
transformation. In conclusion, leveraging the high target specificity of 
well-selected aptamers may bring new breakthroughs in the diagnosis, treatment 
and drug delivery of EC.

INTRODUCTION: Carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for pelvic recurrent rectal cancer 
has recently attracted attention due to its excellent therapeutic outcomes. A 
spacer is often inserted before CIRT to ensure a certain distance between the 
recurrent lesion and the adjacent intestine. We report a case of hydronephrosis 
due to ureteral stenosis after laparoscopic insertion of a polyglycolic acid 
(PGA) spacer.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old man underwent laparoscopic abdominoperineal 
resection and right lateral lymph node dissection after neoadjuvant 
chemoradiotherapy. He had been free of recurrence for 4 years. PET-CT 4.5 years 
after surgery revealed a 9-mm lymph node enlargement with an SUVmax = 2.88 in 
the left lateral region. Laparoscopic left lateral lymph node dissection was 
performed due to suspicion of recurrence, but removal was difficult due to 
severe fibrosis after previous radiation therapy. Definitive diagnosis of 
recurrence had not been made, so the patient was observed without treatment, but 
PET-CT 7 years after the initial surgery showed that the lymph node had enlarged 
to 25 mm with uptake of SUVmax = 8.06. Recurrence was strongly suspected, so we 
planned CIRT, and PGA spacer insertion was performed laparoscopically in 
advance. CT 3 days after insertion of the PGA spacer revealed hydronephrosis due 
to ureteral stenosis, which was thought to be caused by compression from the PGA 
spacer. Follow-up CT taken 7 days after surgery showed no improvement, so a 
ureteral stent was placed. Ureteral stenosis has persisted, so the ureteral 
stent has been replaced every 3 months. Regarding the recurrent lesions after 
CIRT, a tendency for them to shrink was observed on CT taken 1.5 years after the 
procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: In this case, a PGA spacer was inserted laparoscopically and 
hydronephrosis occurred early due to ureteral stenosis. Although the ureteral 
stenosis in the early postoperative period was thought to be caused by the PGA 
spacer, the persistence of ureteral stenosis was thought to be a late adverse 
event of CIRT. In cases where the ureter is exposed, such as after lateral lymph 
node dissection with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, prophylactic ureteral 
stenting before inserting a PGA spacer may be considered.

BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation plays a critical role in the initiation and 
progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), establishing a close link between the 
inflammatory microenvironment with tumor invasion and metastasis. However, the 
regulatory mechanisms by which inflammation-related factors promote CRC 
progression remain largely unclear.
METHODS: The biological significance of PLAC8 in colorectal cancer was 
investigated through clinical data analysis, mouse models of colitis-associated 
colorectal cancer, gene knockdown and overexpression, as well as cell migration 
and invasion assays. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis, activation and 
inhibition of PI3K/Akt and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways, along with techniques 
including CUT&Tag, Western blotting, and qPCR, were employed to comprehensively 
analyze the detailed molecular mechanisms of PLAC8.
RESULTS: Analysis of PLAC8 expression in 78 paired clinical samples revealed 
significantly elevated PLAC8 expression in CRC and was identified as an 
independent prognostic factor. Increased expression of PLAC8 was further 
validated in the mouse inflammation-cancer transition model. Genetic 
manipulation of PLAC8 through overexpression and knockdown unequivocally 
established its prometastatic function in CRC, with no significant effects on 
proliferation, oxaliplatin resistance, or colony formation. Pharmacological 
modulation of AKT signaling using specific activators (SC79) and inhibitors 
(Capivasertib) confirmed that PLAC8 drives EMT through AKT pathway activation, 
resulting in increased expression of EMT-related proteins, such as N-cadherin 
and Snail, thereby enhancing cell migration and invasion. Further correlation 
analysis, CUT&Tag, and STAT3 inhibition studies revealed that CCL28 activated 
the STAT3 signaling pathway, promoting PLAC8 expression, and ultimately 
enhancing CRC invasion and metastasis.
CONCLUSION: CCL28-mediated promotion of PLAC8 via the JAK/STAT3 signaling 
pathway, led to EMT in colorectal cancer cells, which played a key role in the 
transition from inflammation to cancer. PLAC8 served as an independent risk 
factor for colorectal cancer prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Despite advances in immunotherapy, durable responses in lung cancer 
remain limited to a subset of patients, underscoring the need for biomarkers 
capturing spatial immune-tumor interactions. Current methods, such as PD-L1 
immunohistochemistry, suffer from sampling bias and fail to decode dynamic 
immune evasion mechanisms non-invasively.
METHODS: We developed a radiomics framework integrating longitudinal tumor 
growth kinetics (log volume change rate, LVCR) with deep learning to: (1) 
delineate tumors via medical knowledge-guided segmentation; and (2) derive an 
Immune Evasion Score (IES) predicting immunosuppressive niches. The model 
employs immune-aware attention gates (IAAG) to prioritize regions associated 
with aggressive growth (high LVCR) and immune evasion.
RESULTS: Validated on 420 CT scans, our approach achieved superior segmentation 
accuracy (Dice=0.7728 ± 0.03; HD95 = 9.8 ± 1.5 mm) over existing models. 
Critically, the IES predicted PD-L1 expression (AUC = 0.85; *p*<0.001) and CD8+ 
T-cell exclusion (*p*<0.01). High IES correlated with rapid immunotherapy 
progression (HR = 2.3, *p*=0.004), and spatial analysis confirmed 72.3% 
concordance between IAAG-prioritized regions and pathological PD-L1+ niches.
CONCLUSION: This work establishes a non-invasive paradigm for mapping 
immunosuppressive microenvironments, bridging precision radiotherapy with 
immunotherapy personalization. The IES provides a dynamic biomarker of immune 
evasion, potentially guiding patient stratification for checkpoint inhibitors.

OBJECTIVE: Ovarian cancer is a common malignant tumor of the female reproductive 
system, and traditional treatments are unsatisfactory due to its intraperitoneal 
spreading mechanism and its biologic characteristic of being prone to drug 
resistance. Pembrolizumab has demonstrated high objective remission and overall 
survival rates in a variety of solid tumors, and clinical trials are now 
available to explore its efficacy in the treatment of ovarian cancer. The 
objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the 
findings of multiple clinical studies in order to evaluate the effectiveness and 
safety of the immunotherapeutic agent Pembrolizumab in patients diagnosed with 
advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of literature published up to 19 November 2024 
was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web 
of Science, Ovid_medline, Scopus, and ProQuest. The outcomes related to the 
administration of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or recurrent ovarian 
cancer were extracted, including objective remission rate (ORR), disease control 
rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and 
treatment-related adverse events (AEs). A further meta-analysis was then 
performed.
RESULTS: This meta-analysis comprised 625 patients across nine studies. A total 
of 617 patients were involved in the efficacy assessment, while 592 patients 
were included in the safety assessment. The pooled analysis indicated an ORR of 
24% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-0.35), a DCR of 63% (95% CI, 0.49-0.77), 
a median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 4.82 months (95% CI, 3.29-6.35), 
and a median overall survival (mOS) of 13.54 months (95% CI, 10.35-16.73). 
Subgroup analysis indicated that the ORR in the PD-L1-positive group was 24% 
(95% CI, 0.12-0.36), while the ORR in the PD-L1-negative group was 18% (95% CI, 
0.09-0.27). No statistically significant difference was observed between the two 
groups. The ORR was 26% (95% CI, 0.13-0.33) for patients administered a 200 mg 
dose every three weeks (q3w), while it was 12% (95% CI, 0.02-0.30) for those 
receiving a 10 mg/kg dose every two weeks (q2w). The overall incidence of 
adverse reactions of any grade was 81% (95% CI, 0.71-0.91), whereas the 
incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse reactions was 32% (95% CI, 0.09-0.54).
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicates that pembrolizumab treatment for 
patients with advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer exhibits significant efficacy 
and an acceptable safety profile.

Primary brain and CNS tumors comprise the most common tumors in children and are 
the most common cause of cancer deaths in this population. Pediatric primary 
malignant brain tumors including high-grade glioma and medulloblastoma account 
for a significant proportion of these cancer deaths. Advances in the surgical 
management and adjuvant treatment paradigms have improved the prognosis of many 
patients with these tumors, but there remains a subset of treatment-resistant 
tumors or tumors with unique genetics aberrations and aggressive phenotypes that 
confer a poor prognosis. Immunotherapeutic strategies have demonstrated promise 
in pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials. However, high-fidelity 
evaluation of these novel therapeutics and subsequent clinical translation has 
faced challenges due to the limitations of conventional preclinical models that 
have been used to study the pathophysiology and treatment response of these 
tumors. Recent efforts have been directed towards more accurate modeling of the 
molecular and histological heterogeneity observed in these tumors as well as 
creating immunocompetent animal models that resemble the tumor immune milieu. In 
this review, we provide an overview of contemporary and emerging preclinical 
modeling strategies with a focus on those that strive to recapitulate the immune 
and microenvironment features of malignant pediatric brain tumors.

INTRODUCTION: Necrosis induced by sodium overload has recently been identified 
as a novel form of regulated cell death. However, the specific genes associated 
with sodium overload in breast cancer (BC) remain uncharacterized.
METHODS: We identified 753 differentially expressed sodium-overload-related 
genes (DESORGs) in BC. We performed pathway enrichment analyses, then used 
univariate Cox regression to select 67 prognostic DESORGs. To build prognostic 
models, we tested 101 combinations of ten machine learning algorithms. SHAP 
analysis was used to determine feature importance. Mendelian randomization (MR) 
was applied to assess causal effects. Experimental validation (in vitro) 
included overexpression and knockdown studies. GSEA/GSVA and molecular docking 
were conducted to explore downstream pathways and potential drug candidates.
RESULTS: The ridge regression model showed optimal prognostic power. IFNG was 
identified as the key feature. The computed risk score was an independent 
prognostic factor, outperforming traditional clinical variables (AUC = 0.845), 
and a nomogram built with it yielded good calibration (C-index = 0.815). MR 
suggested a protective causal effect of NR1H3 in BC, and patients with high 
NR1H3 expression had significantly better overall survival (p = 0.02). In vitro, 
NR1H3 overexpression suppressed proliferation, colony formation, migration, and 
invasion, whereas its knockdown had opposite effects. GSEA and GSVA showed that 
high NR1H3 expression is enriched in immune activation-related pathways. 
Molecular docking identified Cephaeline and Emetine as potential drugs that 
upregulate NR1H3 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight NR1H3 as a novel DESORG and a promising 
therapeutic target in breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Protein quantity's link to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk is known, 
but protein quality's impact on US populations remains unclear. This study fills 
the gap via a population - based prospective study of 101,709 American adults 
from the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial.
METHODS: From 154,887 adults aged 55-74 years at 10 US screening centers, we 
formed the study group. HPPQI was calculated from the DHQ. Cox regression 
analysis determined HRs and 95% CIs for HPPQI - CRC associations. Subgroup and 
sensitivity analyses identified modifiers and ensured robustness.
RESULTS: During the study period, 1100 CRC cases and 314 CRC-related deaths were 
documented. In our result, HPPQI was significantly negatively associated with 
incidence of CRC (HR Q4 vs. Q1: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.93; P = 0.009 for trend), 
as well as mortality rate (HR Q4 vs. Q1: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.91; P = 0.024 for 
trend). The relationships between HPPQI and the incidence and mortality of CRC 
were robustly supported by sensitivity analyses. Nevertheless, upon separate 
examination of the relationships between HPPQI and proximal colon cancer, distal 
colon cancer, and rectal cancer, none of these associations attained statistical 
significance (all P-values > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest focusing on higher quality of protein 
consumption may be an effective approach to reduce the risk of CRC in the US 
population.

Carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infections cause the majority of 
cervical cancers (CC). While vaccination represents primary prevention, 
screening remains essential. HPV testing, more sensitive than cytology, is 
recommended as the primary method in some European countries. Among women aged ≥ 
30 years, HPV selfsampling improves access to screening and can increase 
coverage of underscreened populations by up to 2.5-fold; several countries have 
adopted this approach. In Switzerland, where screening is opportunistic and only 
cytology is reimbursed, 30 % of women remain under-or unscreened. Introducing 
HPV self-sampling for underscreened women could contribute to the goals set by 
the World Health Organization. This review provides an overview of the situation 
in Switzerland and Europe regarding CC screening.

Esquerra (CAPSBE), Barcelona, Spain.

AIMS: Research on missed opportunities for cancer diagnosis through emergency 
presentation is limited. We investigated missed opportunities and associated key 
intervals in cancer patients at a single high-volume academic hospital in 
Barcelona.
METHODS: Two pathways were defined: emergency referral from primary care (PC) 
and self-referral as emergencies following PC consultations. We used reliable 
data gathering methods and a rigorous validation procedure through independent 
reviews.
RESULTS: Missed opportunities were identified in 43% of PC-referred patients and 
79% of those who self-referred. Patients with missed opportunities were more 
likely than those without to belong to underserved and ethnic communities. 
Intervals were invariably longer in patients with missed opportunities and 
self-referred patients. For pancreatic cancer in emergency referral patients 
with missed opportunities, the interval between diagnostic clue documentation 
and workup initiation was 28 (95% CI 24-32) days longer than in those without. 
For all cancers, the diagnostic interval in emergency referral patients with 
missed opportunities was 79 (95% CI 75-83) days longer than in those without 
and, among emergency self-referral patients, it was 119 (95% CI 112-128) days 
longer.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings may guide PC physicians in decision-making, 
decreasing delays, and suggest opportunities to promote timely help-seeking for 
underrepresented populations.

Philippines.

OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the relationship between 
spirituality and the quality of life among women with breast cancer.
METHODS: This study utilized descriptive correlational research and a purposive 
sampling technique that involved women with breast cancer. Patients with breast 
cancer from particular breast cancer societies and organizations in Manila made 
up the sample. A total of 123 participants were included in the study. The 
Spiritual Index of Well-Being (SIWB) and the European Organization for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire were used to collect the 
needed data. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to determine the 
relationship between spirituality and quality of life among women with breast 
cancer.
RESULTS: A high level of spirituality and quality of life were found among the 
participants. Overall, the mean score of the SIWB among the participants was 
4.48 (±0.670), while the quality of life score was 62.6 (±10.9). A significant 
negative correlation was found between spirituality and quality of life 
(r = -0.127, p = 0.031), while significant positive correlations were noted 
between quality of life and self-efficacy (r = 0.683, p < 0.001) and life 
schemes or meaning in life (r = 0.704, p < 0.001).
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Although spirituality and quality of life had a 
negative correlation, the subscales of self-efficacy and life scheme had high 
positive correlations, indicating the complex dimensions of spirituality. In 
addition to providing coping strategies, spirituality offers patients the 
emotional, social, and existential support they need to deal with the unknowns 
of illness.

BACKGROUND: Fatigue negatively affects quality of life. We aimed to compare the 
prevalence of fatigue in survivors of childhood cancer with the Swiss general 
population, describe longitudinal patterns of fatigue, and identify 
characteristics associated with persistent fatigue in survivors.
PROCEDURE: In this cohort study, we used data from the Swiss Childhood Cancer 
Registry and the Swiss Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, including survivors 
(≥5 years since diagnosis; diagnosed between 1976 and 2015 at <20 years of age) 
aged ≥20 years at study entry, using data from the baseline and follow-up 
survey. A representative sample of the general population was used as a 
comparison group. Fatigue prevalence and fatigue severity were measured using 
the SF-36 vitality scale, from which we derived longitudinal patterns (no/low 
fatigue, late onset, improving, persistent). We used multivariable logistic 
regression to identify clinical, psychosocial and demographic characteristics 
associated with persistent fatigue.
RESULTS: Overall, 1846 survivors participated at baseline (52% male), and 684 
survivors also participated at follow-up (median 9 years from baseline; 52% 
male). From the general population, 863 persons participated (42% male). 
Survivors had similar fatigue prevalence at baseline/follow-up (26%/29%) as the 
general population (26%). No/Low fatigue was experienced by 64%, late onset by 
14%, improving by 7%, and persistent fatigue by 15% of survivors. More late 
effects, psychological distress, pain, and less time spent on moderate-intensity 
physical activity were associated with persistent fatigue.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides data on longitudinal patterns of fatigue in 
survivors and identifies factors associated with persistent fatigue that can be 
used to identify survivors at risk and as a target for interventions aimed at 
improving fatigue.

Traditional risk factor screening for breast cancer focuses on reproductive and 
family history. However, an increasing number of young patients without these 
risk factors have been diagnosed with breast cancer. This study employed an 
exploratory design to investigate the relationship between environmental 
hormone-related lifestyle habits and breast cancer, as well as to develop a 
dietary and health program. In the first phase, laboratory data were analyzed 
using logistic regression to identify environmental hormone-related risk 
factors. Breast cancer was significantly associated with elevated blood lead 
(OR = 3.433, 95%CI: 1.090-10.809), chloramphenicol exposure (OR = 4.335, 95%CI: 
1.196-15.716), and the phthalate metabolite MEP (OR = 3.238, 95%CI: 
1.039-10.094). In the second phase, lifestyle habits of patients with breast 
cancer were collected and matched with these environmental hormone-related risk 
factors to construct an association model and a dietary and health program. The 
findings suggest that environmental hormones contributing to breast cancer 
include heavy metals (e.g. lead, copper, zinc, mercury and chromium) and 
plasticizers, which are related to patients' lifestyles and dietary 
habits.Clinical trial registration: NCT06765395 on 3 January 2025.

Sixteen novel selenoderivatives of flutamide, which is used for treating 
androgen receptor (AR)-dependent prostate cancer, were developed. All the Se 
derivatives displayed promising activity against the NCI-60 human cancer cell 
line panel, which also includes two AR-independent prostate cancer cell lines, 
DU-145 and PC-3. Conversely to flutamide, compounds a2, a5, and b4 exhibited a 
potent antiproliferative effect toward AR-dependent LNCaP cells. Several cell 
death inhibitors were used to determine the underlying regulated cell death 
processes of a5. Regarding its mechanism of action in these cells, this compound 
promoted apoptosis by activating both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic 
pathways, without generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Besides, it induced 
the G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Altogether, it could be concluded that this 
Se-flutamide analog could be a feasible and promising candidate for further 
development for the treatment of both AR-dependent and -independent prostate 
cancers.

OBJECTIVE: Ovarian tissue (OT) cryopreservation is a useful technique for 
preserving fertility potential in women with cancer. Vitrification is a 
relatively new method. Several devices were discussed. Among these methods, 
cryo-support and needle-immersion vitrification (NIV) stand out as particularly 
popular. The aim of this study is the comparison of these devices in terms of 
follicle quality and DNA status.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The OT from 20 cancer patients was transferred with 
Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline supplemented with 5% serum and maintained 
at 4 °C for 1 hour. After preparation of OT vitrified by two freezing solutions 
with different concentrations of cryoprotectant, small fragments of OT (~5×1×1 
mm) were attached to an insulin needle, and in another group, the tissue 
fragments (~5×5×1 mm) were loaded onto the Ova Cryo Device Type M, also called 
cryo-support, and placed in liquid nitrogen. After warming, small tissue pieces 
were prepared to assess the quality of primordial, primary, and secondary 
follicles using eosin-hematoxylin staining. An immune-histochemical 
investigation, including anti-p53 and anti-Caspase 3, was conducted to examine 
the apoptosis pathway.
RESULTS: The data showed a larger number of high-quality follicles in the 
cryo-support group (p<0.05). Also, the level of apoptosis (p53) molecules is 
higher in the NIV method (p<0.05). However, the levels of caspase 3 were not 
significantly different between the NIV approach and the cryo-support 
vitrification group.
CONCLUSION: A recent study revealed that the cryo-support device is more 
effective in increasing high-quality follicles and reducing p53, which is 
associated with early stages of apoptosis. This device may improve clinical 
outcomes and may be recommended for cryopreservation programs.

Publisher: AMAÇ: Over dokusu (OD) kriyoprezervasyonu, kanserli kadınlarda 
doğurganlık potansiyelini korumak için yararlı bir tekniktir. Vitrifikasyon, son 
zamanlarda kullanıma sunulan nispeten yeni bir yöntemdir. Cryo-support ve 
needle-immersion vitrifikasyon (NIV) yöntemlerinin özellikle popüler olduğu 
çeşitli cihazlar tartışılmıştır. Bu çalışmanın amacı, bu cihazların folikül 
kalitesi ve DNA durumu açısından karşılaştırılmasıdır.
GEREÇ VE YÖNTEMLER: Yirmi kanser hastasından alınan OD, %5 serum eklenmiş 
Dulbecco Fosfat Tamponlu Salin ile transfer edildi ve 1 saat boyunca 4 °C’de 
tutuldu. Farklı kriyoprotektan konsantrasyonları içeren iki dondurma 
solüsyonuyla vitrifiye edilen OD’nin hazırlanmasının ardından, küçük OD 
parçaları (~5×1×1 mm) bir insülin iğnesine tutturuldu ve diğer bir grupta, doku 
parçaları (~5×5×1 mm), cryo-support olarak da adlandırılan Ova Cryo Device Type 
M’ye yüklenerek sıvı nitrojene yerleştirildi. Isıtma işleminden sonra, 
eozin-hematoksilen boyama kullanılarak primordial, primer ve sekonder 
foliküllerin kalitesini değerlendirmek için küçük doku parçaları hazırlandı. 
Apoptoz yolunu incelemek için anti-P53 ve anti-Kaspaz 3’ü içeren bir 
immünohistokimyasal inceleme gerçekleştirildi.
BULGULAR: Veriler, cryo-support grubunda daha fazla sayıda yüksek kaliteli 
folikül olduğunu gösterdi (p<0,05). Ayrıca, apoptoz (p53) moleküllerinin sayısı 
NIV yönteminde daha yüksekti (p<0,05). Ancak, kaspaz 3, NIV yaklaşımı ile 
cryo-support vitrifikasyon grubu arasında anlamlı bir fark göstermedi.
SONUÇ: Yakın zamanda yapılan bir çalışma, cryo-support cihazının yüksek kaliteli 
folikülleri artırmada ve apoptozun erken evreleriyle ilişkili olan p53’ü 
azaltmada daha etkili olduğunu ortaya koymuştur. Bu cihazın kullanımı klinik 
sonuçları iyileştirebilir ve kriyoprezervasyon programları için önerilebilir.

PURPOSE: Cancer cells often overexpressed specific receptors to support their 
proliferation and promote immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Tropomyosin 
receptor kinase C (TrkC) is known to be overexpressed in cancer, and implicated 
in promoting tumor progression and metastasis. This study investigates 
synergistic efficacy and immunomodulatory effect of a peptidomimetic 
TrkC-targeted ligand (IYIY) conjugated with dinitrophenol (DNP) hapten 
(IYIY-DNP), in combination with cyclophosphamide (CTX), an alkylating 
chemotherapeutic with immune-modulating properties.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Female BALB/c mice were first immunized with DNP-KLH 
(Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin) to elicit anti-DNP antibodies and subsequently 
implanted with TrkC-expressing murine 4T1 breast carcinoma cells. Tumor-bearing 
mice received 10 mg/kg IYIY-DNP, 25 mg/kg CTX, or their combination 
(IYIY-DNP+CTX), on alternating days for five cycles. Tumor growth was monitored 
for 21 days. On day 10, blood was collected for cytokine profiling, and tumor 
and lymphoid organs were collected postmortem for immune cells phenotyping.
RESULTS: IYIY-DNP+CTX reduced tumor size by 71.11%, while IYIY-DNP and CTX 
monotherapy reduced it by 52.97% and 47.23%, respectively. Elevated levels of 
IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-10, IFN- γ, and TNF-α while reducing TGF-β, were 
correlated with regulatory T cells (Tregs) inhibition as observed in 
IYIY-DNP+CTX. Immune cells phenotyping in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), 
tumor tissues and spleen showed increased antitumor immune cells Th1, Th17 and 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes, correlating with the inhibition of tumor growth through 
IYIY-DNP+CTX administration.
CONCLUSION: IYIY-DNP+CTX significantly reduced TrkC+ tumor growth by suppressing 
immunosuppressive factors and enhancing immune-stimulating responses, helping 
the immune system fight cancer more effectively.

Targeting organelles in cancer cells through enzyme-instructed self-assembly 
(EISA) enhances cancer cell death more efficiently than intracellular EISA, 
thereby improving the modulation of cancer cell fate. In this study, we 
developed a peptide for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) targeting by conjugating 
p-toluenesulfonamide, an ER-targeting moiety, to one capable of undergoing 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-instructed self-assembly, enabling precise 
accumulation of peptide assemblies on the ER. In cancer cells with elevated ALP 
expression, the peptide assemblies selectively accumulated on the ER, unlike in 
normal cells with low ALP levels, inducing ER stress and leading to ER 
dysfunction. Consequently, apoptosis and necroptosis were induced selectively in 
cancer cells. EISA with ER-targeting peptides lowered the IC50 value by more 
than 2-fold compared to intracellular EISA lacking ER-targeting, effectively 
overcoming its concentration-dependent challenges.

INTRODUCTION: Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, however, its 
effectiveness remains limited by weak tumor immunogenicity and immunosuppressive 
microenvironments. Mitochondria have emerged as a strategic therapeutic target, 
given their central role in regulating immune cell activation, proliferation, 
and function through metabolic reprogramming and signaling pathway modulation. 
Mitochondria-targeted nanoformulations offer a promising approach to amplify 
anti-tumor immunity by enhancing immune responses at the cellular and molecular 
levels.
METHODS: We searched the PubMed and Web of Science databases using keywords and 
combinations related to mitochondrial targeting, cancer, immunotherapy, and 
nanoformulations. The primary search timeframe focused on the last five years. 
The literature screening process mainly involved an initial screening based on 
titles and abstracts, followed by a full-text screening.
RESULTS: Mitochondria critically govern anti-tumor immunity by controlling the 
activation and function of immune cells, modulating immune signaling pathways, 
and adjusting mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism. Recent advancements in 
mitochondria-targeted nanoformulations have shown potential to enhance immunity 
by inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD), regulating mitochondrial dynamics and 
metabolism, and activating key immune pathways.
DISCUSSION: Mitochondrial-targeted is a novel strategy for activating anti-tumor 
immunity. Despite promising preclinical results, clinical translation remains 
unrealized. Future research must prioritize integrating basic and clinical 
studies to advance mitochondrial immunomodulation from bench to bedside.
CONCLUSION: Although preclinical studies demonstrate the promise of 
mitochondria-targeted nanoformulations, clinical translation remains unrealized. 
Advances in nanotechnology, immunometabolism, and AI-driven drug design hold 
immense potential to overcome current barriers, particularly in solid tumors. 
Future efforts may establish mitochondrial immunomodulation as a transformative 
strategy in oncology.

INTRODUCTION: Cancer is a prevalent public health issue and a significant global 
problem. Patients receive different treatments, including Western Medicine (WM) 
and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). This review article aims to discuss a 
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), ""Celastrol,"" its traditional design, 
modification, and nano-drug delivery systems for the treatment of cancer.
METHODS: Nine electronic databases, such as WanFang Data, PubMed, ScienceDirect, 
Scopus, Web of Science, SpringerLink, SciFinder, and China National Knowledge 
Infrastructure (CNKI), were used to find relevant information from the past 
twenty years, with searched keywords including ""celastrol,"" ""cancer,"" and 
""nano-drug delivery system,"" etc., without language restrictions.
RESULTS: Celastrol is a therapeutic agent with anticancer properties against 
liver and breast cancers, ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma, and glioma. 
PI3K/Akt/mTOR, Bcl-2/Bax-caspases, EGFR, ROS/JNK, NF-κB, STAT3, JNK/Nrf2/HO-1, 
VEGF, AR/miR-101, HSF1-LKB1-AMPKα-YAP, Wnt/β-catenin, and CIP2A/c-MYC signaling 
pathways are the possible mechanisms by which celastrol acts against cancer.
CONCLUSION: A naturally occurring bioactive substance, ""celastrol,"" is extracted 
from the root of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. Its effectiveness can be 
enhanced with the support of nanotechnology to overcome its limitations in 
cancer treatment. However, the toxicity, dosage, and safety assessments of 
celastrol and nanocelastrol in cancer applications must be further investigated.

BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the absence 
of HER2 expression, progesterone receptor (PR), and estrogen receptor (ER). TNBC 
has a poor prognosis and limited therapy options due to its lack of specific 
targets and aggressive behavior.
AIM: This review demonstrates the therapeutic efficacy and mechanisms of natural 
compounds in targeting key molecular pathways involved in the development and 
progression of TNBC, investigating their interaction with oncogenic signaling 
pathways.
METHODS: A thorough literature review was conducted using databases such as 
PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science to identify studies assessing the anti-TNBC 
properties of natural compounds.
RESULTS: Natural bioactive compounds like curcumin, resveratrol, quercetin, 
EGCG, berberine, and thymoquinone have demonstrated promising anticancer 
properties in TNBC models. These limit metastasis, induce apoptosis, inhibit 
proliferation, and reverse chemoresistance by altering vital pathways like 
PI3K/AKT/ mTOR, MAPK/ERK, NF-κB, JAK/STAT, and Wnt/β-catenin. For example, 
quercetin inhibits NF-κB signalling and increases the cytotoxicity of 
doxorubicin, but curcumin decreases AKT phosphorylation. Furthermore, natural 
compounds may enhance immune response in BRCA-mutated TNBC by modifying 
immunological checkpoints, including PD-L1, when combined with PARP inhibitors.
CONCLUSION: Natural compounds are a promising supplementary method for TNBC 
therapy due to their ability to target unregulated pathways and overcome 
therapeutic resistance. Nevertheless, challenges such as pharmacokinetics, 
limited bioavailability, and a lack of clinical validation persist. Future 
research should focus on combinatorial regimens, nanocarrier-based delivery 
technologies, and biomarker-guided clinical trials to develop successful TNBC 
treatments.

Korea.

BACKGROUND: Newly diagnosed advanced gynaecological cancer patients may have 
different palliative care needs than those diagnosed earlier. Identifying unmet 
palliative care needs and the kind of support they want should be prioritised to 
provide appropriate support for them.
AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the unmet palliative care needs of 
Korean patients with newly diagnosed advanced gynaecological cancer and to 
explore the support they desire from family, medical staff, hospitals and 
government.
METHODS: A mixed-method study included quantitative approaches with a 
cross-sectional design and inductive qualitative approaches with individual 
written narratives. Among the original data obtained from 115 patients with 
advanced gynaecological cancer through an online survey, this study included 
only quantitative and qualitative data from 75 patients diagnosed with 
gynaecological cancer within the past year. Regarding quantitative data, the 
Problems and Needs in Palliative Care Questionnaire was used, and palliative 
care needs were analysed using the range in percentages of subscales. Through 
qualitative content analysis, qualitative data were newly analysed regarding the 
palliative care participants wanted from various support providers.
RESULTS: The palliative care needs were divided into two aspects: 'problem' and 
'need for care'. For both aspects, psychological issues, physical symptoms and 
financial problems were the three most prevalent domains. Participants wanted 
their families to provide physical and emotional support. They desired 
information, emotional support, trustworthy partnerships and professionalism 
from medical staff; healthcare-related and emotional palliative care programs 
from hospitals; and policies for financial and service-related assistance from 
the government.
CONCLUSIONS: As newly diagnosed advanced gynaecological cancer patients have 
various palliative care needs, they need to form a multidisciplinary team of 
experts to provide complicated and integrated support. We recommended that an 
early palliative care program be created to meet the patients' palliative care 
needs shown in our findings in future studies.

BACKGROUND: The University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center Affiliate Network 
(MCCAN) is a complex, multilevel evidence-based intervention (EBI) aimed at 
enhancing access to high-quality cancer services for under-served patients. 
MCCAN is promising but has not been scaled beyond its original context. We aimed 
to adapt MCCAN, originally developed in Kentucky, to address systematic 
differences that threatened its implementation and effectiveness in a new 
context, Iowa, yielding the Iowa Cancer Affiliate Network (I-CAN).
METHODS: We report our adaptation of MCCAN using the Making Optimal Decisions 
for Intervention Flexibility during Implementation (MODIFI) approach: (1) 
identify key information about MCCAN, learning about Kentucky and Iowa contexts 
and users; (2) adapt MCCAN's forms while leaving its core functions intact to 
produce I-CAN; and (3) evaluate I-CAN. Specifically, we conducted studies to 
identify MCCAN's forms and core functions, gathered extensive knowledge of the 
original and new contexts, and identified systematic differences between the 
two. We created a matrix to map MCCAN's core functions to its original forms, 
contextual differences between Kentucky and Iowa, and proposed adapted forms to 
produce I-CAN. We interviewed I-CAN affiliates to assess perceptions of 
acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy.
RESULTS: MCCAN forms were mapped to eight intervention and 10 implementation 
core functions. Adaptation was required for 11 core functions, as contextual 
differences impacted the ability of the original forms of those core functions 
to be carried out in the new context. Contextual differences reflected existing 
relationships and referral patterns, as well as available resources (e.g., 
personnel and infrastructure). Lack of familiarity with the intervention process 
and outcomes limited the ability of I-CAN affiliates to evaluate potential 
adapted forms. Forms evolved as I-CAN affiliates gained practical experience in 
applying them and/or experienced changes in organizational structure, personnel, 
etc. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully adapted MCCAN, a complex, multilevel EBI 
designed to support community hospitals and enhance access to high-quality 
cancer services and programs in Kentucky to improve care for patients in Iowa 
affected by cancer-nearly half of whom reside in rural areas. Our application of 
MODIFI suggests several opportunities for refinement to advance successful EBI 
adaptation.

BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is aggressive and has limited 
therapeutic options due to the absence of targeted therapies, highlighting the 
urgent need for prognostic biomarkers linked to cancer stemness and 
chemoresistance. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), a key regulator of stem cell 
properties, remains incompletely characterized in TNBC clinical cohorts.
METHODS: ALDH1 mRNA expression levels were analyzed using the GEO2R online 
database, and its prognostic significance was assessed via the Kaplan‒Meier 
plotter tool. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed on a tissue 
microarray comprising 96 TNBC samples and paired adjacent normal tissues from 
patients treated at Binzhou People's Hospital between 2016 and 2022. The 
associations between ALDH1 expression and clinicopathological parameters were 
evaluated using the chi-square test.
RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis revealed significantly higher ALDH1 mRNA 
expression in TNBC tissues compared to adjacent benign tissues. Kaplan‒Meier 
survival analysis demonstrated that elevated ALDH1 mRNA expression was 
associated with poor prognosis in TNBC patients. IHC staining further 
confirmed elevated ALDH1 protein expression in TNBC tissues compared with normal 
adjacent tissues. However, there was no significant correlation between ALDH1 
expression and conventional clinicopathological parameters, including age, 
menopausal status, tumor size, TNM stage, histological grade, histological 
subtype, axillary lymph node metastasis and the Ki-67 index (p > 0.05). High 
ALDH1 expression was significantly associated with poorer overall survival ( 
χ2 = 16.836, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that ALDH1 expression is not significantly 
associated with conventional clinicopathological parameters (such as age, TNM 
stage, or histological grade). Instead, it is associated with poorer survival on 
univariate analysis in TNBC patients. Its lack of association with 
clinicopathological factors suggests its potential utility as a supplementary 
prognostic indicator.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is characterized by a 5-year survival rate of less 
than 12%, primarily because of challenges in early diagnosis, which has resulted 
in a generally poor prognosis for patients. With ongoing advancements in 
diagnostic and surgical technologies, there is an increasing focus on enhancing 
the postoperative quality of life for individuals with pancreatic cancer. 
Although existing research suggests that exercise interventions are safe for 
this patient population, definitive evidence regarding their efficacy remains 
insufficient. Consequently, this study aims to conduct a randomized controlled 
trial to assess the safety and efficacy of exercise interventions in enhancing 
muscle mass, physical function, and quality of life among patients who have 
undergone surgery for pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: A total of 168 eligible postoperative pancreatic cancer patients will 
be enrolled and randomly allocated in a 1:2 ratio to either the intervention 
group or the control group. Participants in the intervention group will receive 
a personalized exercise prescription for a duration of 16 weeks, whereas 
participants in the control group will not receive any specific exercise 
prescription or intervention. The primary outcomes of this study include Changes 
in muscle mass, specifically the skeletal muscle index and density, from 
baseline to week 16, as well as assessments of physical function using the 
6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and evaluations of quality of life through 
standardized scale scores. Secondary outcomes comprise assessments using the 
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Fatigue Scale (FACT-F), the Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index 
(PSQI). Measurements of outcome indicators other than muscle mass will be 
conducted at weeks 0, 4, and 12, respectively.
DISCUSSION: The impact of the personalized exercise prescription intervention 
will be evaluated through alterations in primary and secondary outcome 
indicators at both the 4-week intervention mark and the 12-week follow-up 
period. This trial aims to offer novel clinical insights into the efficacy of 
personalized exercise prescriptions in enhancing muscle mass, physical function, 
and quality of life among postoperative pancreatic cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the long-term anorectal function and rectal 
toxicity in rectal cancer patients who achieved a clinical complete response 
(cCR) to total neoadjuvant treatment (TNT) and were managed with a 
watch-and-wait (W&W) approach. While oncological outcomes have been favorable, 
functional outcomes warrant further investigation. Additionally, this research 
identifies clinical risk factors of anorectal dysfunction post-treatment.
METHODS: This was a single-center, cross-sectional study. Rectal cancer patients 
who underwent TNT followed by W&W between December 2014 and November 2020 were 
recruited. A minimum 2-year follow-up with no disease progression was required. 
The study took the form of semi-structured interviews. Multiple scales for 
evaluation were used, including the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) scale, the Late 
Effects of Normal Tissues/Subjective Objective Management Analytic (LENT/SOMA) 
system, the Wexner score, the Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) score and 
the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Bowel Function Instrument (MSKCC 
BFI). Univariate analysis and multi-factor Logistic regression were used to 
identify the risk factors for anorectal dysfunction.
RESULTS: Out of 70 patients with a median follow-up of 43 months, less than half 
experienced grade I (28/70, 40.0%) or II (1/70, 1.4%) late rectal toxicity 
according to the RTOG/EORTC criteria, with no cases of more severe toxicity. The 
prevalence of fecal urgency was the most significant symptom reported (42/70, 
60.0%). The median LARS score was 16 [interquartile ranges (IQR) 4-25]; 17.1% 
(12/70) of patients had minor LARS and 15.7% (11/70) had major LARS. The median 
Wexner score was 2 (IQR 0-3). The median MSKCC BFI total score was 82.5 (IQR 
77-86). Smoking history was an independent risk factor for long-term anorectal 
dysfunction [odds ratio (OR) 6.562, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.561-27.590].
CONCLUSION: Most rectal cancer patients under a W&W strategy after TNT sustain 
acceptable anorectal function, though fecal urgency remains a common issue. 
Smoking history emerged as a significant risk factor for anorectal dysfunction. 
Larger prospective studies focusing on bowel function are needed.

Zoonotic viruses, which are pathogens naturally transmitted from animals to 
humans, pose a significant and evolving challenge to public health. Although 
most known zoonotic viruses do not exhibit the persistence typically necessary 
for viral oncogenesis, the potential cancer-causing effects of these infections 
remain unclear. Persistent infection, latency, or abortive replication within 
susceptible but non-permissive human cells may allow some animal-origin viruses 
to evade immune clearance, disrupt host cell signaling, and induce genomic 
instability-key features of cancer development. Evidence from both in vitro and 
in vivo studies indicates that certain animal viruses can enter human cells, 
integrate their genetic material, or express oncogenic proteins, even without 
completing full replication. These mechanisms resemble those of established 
human oncoviruses and suggest that, under specific host and environmental 
conditions, zoonotic viruses could contribute to neoplastic transformation. 
Given the increasing frequency of human-animal interactions through 
companionship, agriculture, wildlife trade, and food production, 
multidisciplinary research combining virology, oncology, and epidemiology is 
essential. Such efforts should focus on sensitive molecular detection, 
mechanistic studies, and population-based investigations to better understand 
the long-term cancer risks associated with zoonotic viral infections and to 
guide effective prevention strategies.

BACKGROUND: This study's goal was to investigate the long-term association 
between cancer risk and depression symptom trajectories, highlighting the need 
for dynamic evaluation of depressive symptoms across time.
METHODS: Data from 42,911 participants were drawn from two population-based 
cohorts: the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) from US and the English 
Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). The study period covered HRS Rounds 4-12 
(1998-2014) and ELSA Rounds 1-9 (2002-2018), with the first six years as the 
exposure period and the following ten years as the follow-up. The assessment of 
depressive symptoms was conducted employing the 8-item CES-D scale, with 
trajectories constructed over repeated assessments. Cancer diagnoses were 
determined based on self-reported physician confirmations. Cox regression models 
were used to compute the risk ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), 
taking into consideration variables linked to health and demographics.
RESULTS: Using those with consistently low depressive symptoms as a reference 
standard, other depressive symptom trajectories were linked to an elevated 
cancer risk. Patients with symptoms that fluctuate were at the highest risk 
(HR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.70-1.90), followed by those with consistently high 
symptoms and increasing symptoms (HR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.39-1.50; HR = 1.21, 95% 
CI: 1.18-1.25, respectively). However, no significant association was found for 
the decreasing symptom trajectory (HR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.35-1.21). The total 
depressive symptom trajectory was a slightly stronger risk factor for cancer 
than the somatic and cognitive-emotional components.
CONCLUSIONS: The results support the idea that depressive symptoms are a 
significant risk factor for the onset of cancer. The fluctuating symptom 
trajectory exhibited the highest risk, underscoring the importance of 
considering temporal variations in depressive symptoms for cancer prevention and 
intervention. Integrating mental health assessments into cancer care may enhance 
early risk identification and improve patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Ferroptosis therapy has emerged as a promising antitumor strategy by 
utilizing the Fenton reaction to destroy cancer cells, where Fe2+ catalyzes the 
decomposition of H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals (•OH). Despite the great potential 
of ferroptosis therapy in suppressing tumor growth, inadequate catalysts and 
reactants within tumors remains a major challenge before its clinical 
translation. Herein, we developed glucose oxidase (GOx)-loaded phase-transition 
nanodroplets (PND) modified with Fe-tannic acid (TA) networks (PND@GOx@Fe-TA) 
for enhanced antitumor efficacy of ferroptosis therapy via synergistic 
photothermal and starvation therapy.
RESULTS: PND@GOx@Fe-TA can convert glucose into H2O2, which not only provides 
sufficient H2O2 for Fenton reaction, but also consumes glucose to exert 
starvation therapy. In addition, the Fe-TA networks of PND@GOx@Fe-TA can be 
degraded upon reaching the tumor site, thus generating Fe2+ from Fe3+ via 
reduction by the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in the tumor microenvironment. 
The Fe2+ then reacts with the in situ-generated H2O2 for enhanced Fenton 
reaction and induces ferroptosis of cancer cells. Additionally, the 
PND@GOx@Fe-TA exhibits photothermal effects under 808 nm laser irradiation, 
which not only accelerates the Fe2+-mediated Fenton reaction but also gasifies 
the liquid core of the PND, enabling its use as a contrast agent for 
contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI).
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the PND@GOx@Fe-TA represents a promising approach for 
multimodal imaging-guided antitumor therapy by synergistic starvation, 
photothermal and enhanced ferroptosis therapy.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 50% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients exhibit high 
levels of Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), which is associated with chemotherapy 
resistance. As Fn itself cannot be directly targeted for therapy in vivo, 
elucidating the mechanism underlying Fn-induced chemotherapy resistance is 
crucial, though it remains unclear.
METHODS: qPCR was used to analyze the correlation between Fn abundance and 
clinical parameters in 80 human colon cancer samples. The effect of Fn on the 
sensitivity of colon cancer cells to oxaliplatin was evaluated by clone 
formation, EdU proliferation and apoptosis assays. RNA sequencing was performed 
on Fn-infected colon cancer cells to identify differentially expressed genes. 
Mechanistic studies explored the interaction between PVT1 and ATAD3A, and the 
role of TLR4/NF-κB pathway in regulating PVT1 expression.
RESULTS: qPCR experiments showed that Fn abundance was associated with later 
clinical stage and shorter RFS. Clone formation, EdU proliferation assay and 
apoptosis assay showed that Fn could change the sensitivity of colon cancer 
cells to oxaliplatin. Further RNA sequencing showed that Fn infection could 
upregulate the expression of long noncoding RNA plasmacytoma variant 
translocation 1 (PVT1) in colon cancer cells. The abundance of Fn in colon 
cancer tissues was positively correlated with the level of PVT1, and the 
mechanism was that PVT1 binds to AAA domain protein 3 (ATAD3A) and prevents its 
ubiquitination. Fn upregulates ATAD3A expression through PVT1 and inhibits ER 
stress-mediated cell death. In addition, in colon cancer cells co-cultured with 
Fn, PVT1 expression is regulated by the TLR4/NF-κB pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: This study delineates a pathway where Fn infection promotes 
oxaliplatin resistancein colon cancer cells by upregulating PVT1 via the 
TLR4/NF-κB pathway. PVT1 subsequently stabilizes ATAD3A, suppressing cell death. 
PVT1 is a potential target to overcome the high abundance of Fusobacterium 
nucleatum leading to oxaliplatin resistance in colon cancer.

BACKGROUND: The exploration of natural sources for novel anticancer agents has 
garnered significant attention in recent years, driven by the need for effective 
and safe anticancer medications, considering the escalating global burden of 
cervical cancer. Vitex doniana Sweet (Verbenaceae), a plant with diverse 
traditional medicinal uses, especially in Africa, has shown promise in this 
regard due to its rich phytochemical composition.
METHODS: This study investigated the cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects of 
V. doniana extracts on normal mammalian (Vero-CCL-81) and cervical cancer (HeLa) 
cells, including cancer-associated gene expression profiles, according to 
standard procedures. Phytochemical analysis was performed using gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
RESULTS: The findings revealed significant (P < 0.0001) concentration-dependent 
increases in cytotoxicity and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, by the 
aqueous, methanolic, ethyl acetate, and dichloromethane leaf extracts of V. 
doniana. Notably, differential cytotoxicity profiles were observed among 
different extracts. The median cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) of the studied 
extracts were: 1025.12 µg/ml (Aqueous leaf extract), 10.67 µg/ml (methanolic 
leaf extract), 964.81 µg/ml (ethyl acetate extract), and 1238.85 µg/ml 
(dichloromethane leaf extract. Furthermore, high selectivity indices of the 
ethyl acetate (26.55) and dichloromethane (103.67) leaf extracts of V. doniana 
against HeLa cells were observed, underscoring their potential as targeted 
chemotherapeutic agents against cervical cancer. Mechanistic insights into the 
observed effects revealed significant modulation of key genes involved in cancer 
progression, including the androgen receptor (AR), B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2), 
caspase-3 (CASP3), cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), and tumour protein 53 
(TP53/P53). GC-MS analysis revealed 10 bioactive compounds in the 
dichloromethane leaf extract of V. doniana, with γ-sitosterol and 
stigmasta-3,5-dien-7-one being the most abundant. Besides, the ethyl acetate 
leaf extract showed presence of 27 phytochemicals, whereby pentatriacontane and 
tetratetracontane were more common while α-calacorene and spiro (2.5) octane 
5,5-dimethyl-4-(3-oxobutyl)- were less abundant.
CONCLUSION: These findings provide valuable insights into the potential 
and molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-cervical cancer effects of V. 
doniana extracts, their attributable phytocompounds, and highlight their 
putative value as sources of lead compounds for the development of novel 
anticancer drugs.

BACKGROUND: The growing knowledge of long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) has suggested 
the role and predictive potential of LncRNA in cancer, but has not been 
translated into effective practical tools. The morbidity of colorectal cancer 
(CRC) has been declining because of effective screening tools. However, the 
mechanism of the disease is not well understood.
METHODS: The LncRNAs that extracted using univariable Cox analysis were explored 
for the potential functions and applied for classification of LncRNA-derived 
subtypes of CRC. Multi-modal data involving microscope to macroscope levels were 
applied to evaluate the molecular, cell, and medical image characteristics of 
LncRNA-derived subtypes. Radiomic signature calculated by LASSO regression 
analysis was utilized for distinguishing the CRC subtypes. The performance of 
LncRNA and radiomic signature were assessed with respect to its calibration, 
discrimination, and clinical usefulness.
RESULTS: The LncRNA signature composed of 8 LncRNAs significantly associated 
with prognosis, metabolism, and organismal system showed good performance in 
patients’ prognosis assessment (AUC, 0.717; time-dependent ROC > 0.71). Patients 
separated into two subtypes (HRG vs. LRG) based on the LncRNA signature 
displayed notable prognostic differences (Kaplan-Meier, p < 0.001). Multi-modal 
analysis indicated obvious heterogeneity between HRG and LRG subgroups, mainly 
focused on the abnormal enrichment of glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway, 
different cellular differentiation, and density level characteristics in the 
tumor region. In addition, the radiomic signature showed good accuracy (AUC, 
0.919), discrimination (p < 0.05), and generalization ability (external 
independent test cohort, p < 0.05) for LncRNA-derived subgroups assessment.
CONCLUSION: This study described the multi-modal characteristics landscape of 
LncRNA-derived subtypes in CRC and strengthened the connection from microscope 
to macroscope levels.

BACKGROUND: The MiLES intervention is a digital employer-based tool aimed at 
enhancing return to work (RTW) of employees with cancer through interactive 
videos, conversation checklists and tips and information. In a previous study, 
the MiLES intervention proved to be a useful intervention that aligns with 
employers' daily practice. The hypothesis is that the MiLES intervention will 
enhance the employers' willingness, ability and self-efficacy in providing RTW 
support, which in turn will enhance the RTW of employees with cancer. This paper 
describes the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), aimed at evaluating 
the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and return on investment of the MiLES 
intervention. Parallel to the RCT, a process evaluation of the delivery of the 
MiLES intervention in a real-world setting will be conducted.
METHODS: An RCT with a 12-month follow-up period will be conducted involving 140 
employer-employee dyads. The employees are diagnosed with cancer (< 2 years 
earlier), aged 18-67 years, in paid employment with an employer, and currently 
fully or partly sick-listed (< 2 years). The employer provides RTW support to 
the included employee. All dyads will either be allocated to the intervention 
group, of which the employer will get access to the MiLES intervention, or to 
the control group in which care as usual will be provided. The primary outcome 
will be successful RTW (encompassing the employee's perspectives on RTW) at the 
level of the employee; secondary outcomes will include the following: time to 
RTW, quality of life and quality of working life, received work-related support, 
and satisfaction with work-related support. At the level of the employer, the 
secondary outcomes will include the following: self-efficacy in providing RTW 
support and satisfaction with the RTW process. All outcomes will be assessed 
using questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months of follow-up. Both 
the cost-effectiveness and the return on investment analysis will be conducted 
from the employers perspective. For the process evaluation, the UK MRC framework 
will be used.
DISCUSSION: This RCT will study the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and return 
on investment of the MiLES intervention. This knowledge is needed to formulate 
recommendations regarding the implementation of the MiLES intervention beyond 
the research setting.

Neurodegenerative disorders, notably Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, are 
unified by progressive neuronal loss and aberrant protein aggregation. Growing 
evidence indicates that these conditions are linked to cancer, infectious 
diseases, and type 2 diabetes through convergent molecular processes. In this 
review, we examine the mechanistic foundations of these links, focusing on 
shared features such as protein misfolding and aggregation, chronic 
inflammation, and dysregulated signalling pathways. We integrate cellular, 
animal, and human data to illustrate how pathogenic proteins may influence one 
another through cross-seeding and co-aggregation, and assess the implications of 
such interactions for disease susceptibility, progression, and treatment 
response. Understanding these underlying mechanisms may provide a conceptual 
framework for developing therapeutic approaches that target the molecular basis 
of multiple complex disorders.

BACKGROUND: Real-world data on patients with locally advanced non-small cell 
lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) treated with chemoradiotherapy have been reported; 
however, prognostic factors in patients with negative or low programmed cell 
death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression are unclear. Therefore, we aimed to explore 
prognostic factors in patients with LA-NSCLC with negative or low PD-L1 
expression using real-world data obtained after the PACIFIC trial.
METHODS: Patients with LA-NSCLC with negative or low PD-L1 expression who 
received definitive radiotherapy at our institution between March 2017 and May 
2022 were included. Competing risk analyses were used to evaluate cumulative 
incidence of cancer-specific death (CI-CSD), cumulative incidence of recurrence 
(CI-R), cumulative incidence of distant metastasis (CI-DM), and cumulative 
incidence of in-field recurrence (CI-IFR).
RESULTS: The study included the data of 130 patients. Median follow-up was 37 
(range, 2–72) months after radiotherapy initiation; 54 (41.5%) patients died, 
among whom 49 died of lung cancer, and 75 (57.7%) received durvalumab. 
Multivariate analyses revealed that interstitial lung abnormality (ILA) 
score ≥ 1 was a significant factor of shorter OS and higher CI-IFR, and a mean 
heart dose ≥ 7.5 Gy showed a trend toward significance for shorter OS., Internal 
high-dose volumetric modulated arc therapy was associated with lower CI-R, 
whereas poor baseline performance status correlated with higher CI-DM. Notably, 
durvalumab administration was marginally associated with lower CI-R.
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-treatment ILA and high mean heart doses negatively impacted OS 
in patients with LA-NSCLC with negative or low PD-L1 expression according to 
real-world data obtained after the PACIFIC trial.

BACKGROUND: Enhanced metabolic and mitochondrial activity inherent in actively 
proliferating cancer cells is associated with intracellular redox imbalance that 
impacts cellular viability. To restore redox homeostasis cancer cells evolve to 
activate redox protective mechanisms. This differential activation of redox 
defense pathways compared to normal cells provides a therapeutic window for 
novel targeted therapies in cancer. Although heme metabolism emerges as a 
crucial regulator of redox homeostasis and iron metabolism in cancer cells with 
frequent alteration in breast cancer, it remains largely unexplored, and no 
targeted translational approaches have been developed. Heme-regulated redox 
homeostasis is coordinately maintained through biosynthetic and degradation 
pathways. As a byproduct of TCA cycle, cytotoxic heme is initially derivatized 
by heme oxygenases and progressively metabolized to the potent antioxidant 
bilirubin by two non-redundant biliverdin reductases, BLVRA and BLVRB. BLVRB 
overexpression has been observed in breast cancers, although its function in 
breast cancer pathogenesis remains unknown.
METHODS: CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of BLVRB in multiple breast cancer cell lines 
demonstrated its profound effect on intracellular redox state and cell 
proliferation in vitro and in xenograft models. Integrated proteomic, 
metabolomic, and lipidomic studies identified and validated BLVRB-mediated 
adaptive metabolic responses required for breast cancer cell cytoprotection.
RESULTS: We have established BLVRB as a requisite component of the pro-survival 
redox defense mechanism in breast cancer cells. Targeted deletion of BLVRB 
induces reductive stress, leading to alterations in endoplasmic reticulum 
proteostasis and lipid composition. These defects impact plasma membrane 
functionality and endosomal recycling of multiple oncogenic receptors, such as 
HER2 and transferrin receptors.
CONCLUSIONS: These data collectively identify BLVRB as a novel metabolic target 
in breast cancer, distinct from other redox-regulating pathways. This study, 
along with our recent progress in developing novel specific BLVRB inhibitors, 
offers a unique translational opportunity for targeted therapies in personalized 
breast cancer medicine.

OBJECTIVES: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype 
of breast cancer (BC), characterized by poor clinical behaviors and outcomes. 
TMOD1 was reported as a downstream target of NF-κB contributing to the growth of 
cancer cells. However, it's impacts on TNBC patients' prognosis and treatment 
response remain unclear.
METHODS: The prognostic value of TMOD1 was analyzed by data from the 
Kaplan-Meier database and verified through immunohistochemical evaluation from 
190 TNBC patients in West China Hospital (WCH). Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, 
Transwell cell migration assay and Matrigel invasion assay were used for in 
vitro study. TNBC cells treated with gradient dosage of doxorubicin (Dox), 
paclitaxel (PTX), and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for chemotherapy sensitivity assay. 
The chemotherapy sensitivity of Dox in vivo was further confirmed by cell 
line-derived xenograft (CDX) model.
RESULTS: TNBC patients with high TMOD1 expression had longer overall survival 
(OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in both Kaplan-Meier plotter database 
and in cohort from WCH. In cellular functional study, overexpression of TMOD1 
promoted TNBC cells' proliferation, migration and invasion. It also enhanced 
TNBC sensitivity to Dox treatment both in vivo and in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: High TMOD1 expression in TNBC patients is associated with better 
prognosis. Although TMOD1 expression promotes TNBC cell proliferation, 
migration, and invasion, TMOD1 enhances the sensitivity to Dox therapy both in 
vivo and in vitro, which might contribute to improve the prognosis for TNBC 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Metastasis is a major contributor of cancer-related mortality and 
involves complex crosstalk between cancer cells and stromal cells modulated by 
various cytokines and growth factors. While the endothelium is essential for 
supplying nutrients and oxygen, little is known about its role in metastasis 
initiation. Determining the effect of endothelial-derived angiocrine factors on 
cancer cells may explain the mechanisms regulating metastasis initiation.
RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the role of normal endothelial cells 
(NEC) and tumor endothelial cells (TEC) in regulating the rate-limiting steps of 
metastasis initiation. First, we demonstrated that TEC have a higher 
proliferation, migration, and angiogenic potential than NEC. TEC-conditioned 
media significantly promoted chemotaxis, invasion, and proliferation of cancer 
cells relative to NEC-conditioned media. Additionally, TEC facilitated faster 
cell-cell adhesion to tumor cells than NEC. Mass spectrometry analysis of 
endothelial cell secretome revealed higher levels of PDGF-AA, PDGF-C, and VEGFA 
in TEC-conditioned medium, which were associated with enriched PI3K-AKT, MAPK, 
and RAS signaling pathways, as well as regulation of actin cytoskeleton and 
focal adhesion. In vitro functional studies using recombinant proteins showed 
that PDGF-AA and PDGF-C significantly promoted cancer cell chemotaxis and 
invasion without affecting proliferation. However, unlike VEGFA, PDGF-AA and 
PDGF-C did not affect endothelial cell tube formation or vascular permeability. 
Interestingly, neutralization of TEC-derived PDGF-C signficantly inhibited tumor 
cell chemotaxis and invasion, and attenuated EphA2/AKT/P38/ERK signaling in 
vitro. In vivo, the co-injection of TEC and 4T1 cells resulted in significantly 
higher primary breast tumor growth and liver metastasis in an orthotopic mouse 
model.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that crosstalk between cancer cells and TEC, 
partly through angiocrine factors in the TME, induces the rate-limiting steps of 
metastasis initiation.

BACKGROUND: Fibronectin type III domain containing 1 (FNDC1) is a member of 
fibronectin type III domain protein family, which is known to play an important 
role in the metastasis of some cancers. However, it has not been reported about 
the relationship between FNDC1 and ovarian serous cancer.
METHODS: Firstly, we investigated the expression of FNDC1 in various cancer 
types, and analyzed its diagnostic value and potential role in ovarian serous 
cancer using TCGA database. Subsequently, a series of bioinformatics methods 
were used to explore the potential oncogenic effects of FNDC1, including the 
relationship between FNDC1 expression and immune cell infiltration and immune 
checkpoint molecules, protein-protein interaction network, gene ontology and 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, 
and toxicity analysis. Finally, the results were further verified by cell 
function experiments.
RESULTS: FNDC1 was highly expressed in ovarian serous cancer, which was further 
verified in cell line, indicating that it might be as a diagnostic marker of 
ovarian serous cancer. In addition, the expression of FNDC1 and TNFSF4, an 
immune checkpoint molecule, showed a strong positive correlation, and both them 
were involved in the same signaling pathway, indicating that they might jointly 
affect T-cell responses in ovarian serous cancer. Moreover, this effect might be 
inhibited by austocystin D.
CONCLUSION: FNDC1 was a potential diagnostic marker, prognostic indicator, and 
target for the treatment of ovarian serous cancer.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the role of causal genes of prostate cancer (PrCa) can 
reveal key biological pathways and identify potential targets for treatment.
METHODS: We investigated associations between genetically predicted gene 
expression levels and PrCa risk using cis-eQTL summary-based Mendelian 
randomization (SMR) and colocalization analysis. Findings were replicated using 
two independent PrCa GWAS. We then intersected the identified genes with 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified from TCGA-PRAD dataset to 
obtain key genes. Furthermore, enrichment, protein-molecule network, immune 
infiltration, and epigenetic analyses were conducted to explore their biological 
pathways. Lastly, phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), drug prediction, and 
molecular docking simulation analysis were utilized to identify potential drugs.
RESULTS: We identified 15 genes in blood whose expression levels are putatively 
associated with PrCa, validated in at least one replication GWAS dataset. Using 
open-access mRNA-sequencing data, we found that ZNF217 and BNIP2 were key genes 
potentially important in PrCa pathogenesis. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis 
revealed that BNIP2 was predominantly expressed in a subset of endothelial 
cells, whereas ZNF217 was mainly enriched in epithelial cells. Downstream 
analysis revealed their involvement in epigenetic modulation-related pathways, 
while upstream analysis showed that upregulation of ZNF217 notably correlated 
with increased CpG methylation. Molecular docking simulation suggested 
doxorubicin, alsterpaullone, and camptothecin as potential drugs targeting these 
key genes.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide robust leads for understanding pathogenic 
mechanisms and developing therapeutic interventions for PrCa.

BACKGROUND: To overcome the limitations of existing health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL) instruments, the HRQoL Instrument with 8 Items (HINT-8) was 
developed for the Korean population. We aimed to evaluate the validity, 
interrater reliability, and agreement of the HINT-8 compared to the EQ-5D-5 L 
among patients with oropharyngeal cancer (OPC).
METHODS: A total of 327 patients with OPC aged ≥ 19 years who received treatment 
at 14 hospitals in South Korea were recruited between August 2023 and February 
2024. HRQoL was assessed using the two instruments. The psychometric evaluation 
included analyses of validity (convergent and known-group validity), agreement 
(intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis), and reliability 
(internal consistency measured by Cronbach's alpha). The ceiling effects and 
score distributions were also examined.
RESULTS: In total, 299 respondents were included in the final analysis. Both 
instruments demonstrated high internal consistency (HINT-8: α = 0.872; 
EQ-5D-5 L: α = 0.845) and good agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient 
[ICC] = 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76-0.84). The convergent validity 
was supported by strong correlations between the HINT-8 index and both the 
EQ-5D-5 L index (r = 0.805) and EQ VAS (r = 0.715). The ceiling effect of HINT-8 
(12.7%) was substantially lower than the EQ-5D-5 L (32.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: The HINT-8 is a valid, reliable, and responsive instrument for 
measuring HRQoL in patients with oropharyngeal cancer. These findings suggest 
that HINT-8 can serve as a valuable complementary instrument to the EQ-5D-5 L.

BACKGROUND: CAPN-1 and CAPN-2, two ubiquitously expressed calpains, have been 
implicated in cancer progression, but their distinct roles in breast cancer 
remain poorly defined. This study aims to define the opposing roles of CAPN-1 
and CAPN-2 in breast cancer progression, with a focus on their regulatory impact 
on cell proliferation. Since these calpains may have different functions in the 
mammary gland, we aimed to investigate the possible antagonistic roles of CAPN-1 
and CAPN-2 in breast cancer progression, focusing on their expression patterns 
and functional impact on cell proliferation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed breast cancer cell lines using immunoblotting 
and real-time cellular assays, showing that HCC1937 cells exhibit an opposite 
expression pattern of CAPN-1 and CAPN-2 compared to non-cancerous breast cells. 
CAPN-1 promoted cancer cell survival and negatively regulated CAPN-2 at both the 
protein and mRNA levels, whereas CAPN-2 suppressed proliferation. Additionally, 
the calpain activator AG-08 triggered cell death through CAPN-2 but not CAPN-1. 
In silico analysis confirmed higher CAPN-1 and lower CAPN-2 expression levels in 
breast cancer samples compared to normal tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that CAPN-1 and CAPN-2 may exert 
antagonistic roles in breast cancer, but importantly, this effect was restricted 
to HCC1937 cells, representing a basal A TNBC subtype. Validation in additional 
basal A models and patient-derived samples will be essential to confirm these 
results. Our study, therefore, provides preliminary, model-specific insights 
into calpain regulation in TNBC and suggests that future therapeutic strategies 
should carefully account for subtype heterogeneity.

INTRODUCTION: With breast cancer survivorship steadily increasing, attention is 
now shifting from mere survival to quality of life. Among the most neglected 
dimensions is sexual health, a domain deeply affected by cancer and its 
treatment, yet rarely addressed in clinical practice, especially in conservative 
cultural contexts like India. We aimed to evaluate the sexual quality of life 
(SQL) among Indian breast cancer survivors.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, mixed-methods study was conducted at a tertiary 
teaching center in Central India. Fifty-five women who had undergone breast 
cancer treatment were assessed using the sexual activity questionnaire (SAQ). 
Quantitative data were supplemented with in-depth interviews among sexually 
inactive participants. Chi-square analysis was used to identify factors 
associated with sexual activity status.
RESULTS: Only 12 of 55 women (21.8%) reported being sexually active. Among them, 
over 90% experienced moderate to high satisfaction despite reduced frequency. 
The mean SAQ pleasure and discomfort scores were 0.92 and 0.54, respectively, 
with habit scores uniformly zero. Among the 43 sexually inactive women, key 
reasons for celibacy included body image issues, myths about cancer 
transmission, partner abandonment, and cultural silence. Age group was the only 
statistically significant factor associated with sexual activity (p = 0.011); 
menopausal status, education, surgery type, and hormonal therapy were not 
significant.
CONCLUSION: Although sexual dysfunction post-breast cancer is globally 
prevalent, it is uniquely exacerbated in Indian patients by cultural silence, 
stigma, and systemic neglect. There is an urgent need for culturally sensitive 
communication training, patient education, and the inclusion of sexual 
rehabilitation in standard survivorship protocols.

BACKGROUND: Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is prevalent among patients with 
breast cancer, yet those at high risk are not well characterized.
AIMS: This study aimed to identify the patient characteristics associated with 
FCR after diagnosis.
METHODS: Between July and September 2023, participants in the Chicago 
Multiethnic Epidemiologic Breast Cancer Cohort completed the 9-item FCR-Short 
Form Inventory. A score of 22 or higher indicated clinically significant FCR 
(csFCR). Logistic and linear regression estimated associations between different 
risk factors and csFCR and FCR scores, respectively. Missing data were addressed 
using multiple imputation.
RESULTS: Among 1390 stage I-III patients (mean age 63.1 years and 9.1 [mean] 
years since diagnosis), 262 (18.8%) reported csFCR. In adjusted models, csFCR 
was associated with having another cancer excluding non-melanoma skin (adjusted 
odds ratio [aOR], 2.64; 95% CI, 1.66-4.21), greater levels of stress (aOR, 2.40 
per 1-SD increment; 95% CI, 1.98-2.91), having a prior recurrence (aOR, 2.26; 
95% CI, 1.14-4.47), and having estrogen receptor-positive tumors (aOR, 1.60; 95% 
CI, 1.06-2.40). Older age at diagnosis (aOR, 0.64 per 10-year increment; 95% CI, 
0.56-0.73) was associated with lower odds of csFCR. Similar associations were 
observed with continuous FCR scores, along with advanced stage at diagnosis 
associated with higher FCR scores (p-trend = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 1 in 5 breast cancer patients reported csFCR. Key risk 
factors included younger age at diagnosis, history of recurrence or other 
malignancies, greater levels of stress, and estrogen receptor-positive breast 
cancer, which can inform targeted interventions to support survivorship.

Exercise has emerged as an effective therapeutic strategy in cancer management. 
Long-term supervised exercise programs, including resistance training and 
aerobic training, can improve body composition and physical fitness, modulate 
circulating factors (e.g., hormones, cytokines), enhance treatment tolerance, 
and reduce side effects, potentially influencing cancer progression and reducing 
mortality risk. Despite advancements in exercise oncology, opportunities remain 
to refine exercise prescription through the integration of advanced 
methodologies such as periodization and autoregulatory programming strategies. 
Periodization, a systematic approach to organizing training over time, has 
demonstrated benefits in general fitness and clinical populations but is 
underexplored in cancer care. Emerging evidence suggests periodized exercise 
programs may enhance physical fitness (e.g., muscle strength and 
cardiorespiratory fitness) while mitigating treatment-related side effects 
(e.g., fatigue, loss of bone mineral density). Here, we examine the mechanisms 
underlying the benefits of periodization in exercise oncology and propose an 
updated framework for its implementation across the cancer continuum (e.g., 
neo-adjuvant, adjuvant, survivorship). Incorporating parallel or emphasis 
periodized models tailored to individual needs may optimize outcomes. These 
models of periodization and the use of autoregulatory programming strategies 
allow exercise intensity and volume to be modulated in response to patients' 
symptoms and fatigue, ensuring safety and adherence, while aligning with the 
goals established by the periodized training plan. Ultimately, future research 
should explore complementary strategies such as nutrition and psychological 
periodization. By adopting a holistic and individualized approach, clinicians 
can improve the effectiveness of exercise interventions and ultimately enhance 
the quality of life for patients with cancer.

AIM: Cancer imposes a significant financial burden on patients. This study 
evaluates the role of health cards in reducing financial toxicity (FT) and 
improving health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and psychological distress 
among cancer patients in Pakistan.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Bahawalpur, Pakistan, 
between March and June 2024. A total of 672 cancer patients (336 with and 336 
without health cards) were recruited using non-probability purposive sampling. 
FT was assessed using the Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST), 
while HRQOL was measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy-General (FACT-G). The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) 
evaluated psychological distress.
RESULTS: Independent t-tests showed significant differences between patients 
with and without health card coverage: FT significantly decrease from 7.21 to 
13.24, HRQOL improve from 28.60 to 47.56, and psychological distress declined, 
all p < 0.001. FT correlated positively with HRQOL (r = 0.814) and negatively 
with depression (r = -0.222), anxiety (r = -0.475), and stress (r = -0.675), 
indicating strong links between financial relief and well-being (p < 0.001). 
MANOVA results indicated that health cards had a strong multivariate effect 
across all outcomes (Wilks' Lambda = 0.060, F(5,666) = 2071.97, p < 0.001, 
η2 = 0.940).
CONCLUSION: Health cards play a crucial role in reducing FT while improving 
HRQOL and psychological well-being among cancer patients in Pakistan. The 
findings underscore the need to expand health coverage to ensure financial 
protection and enhance successful treatment outcomes for vulnerable populations.

End-of-life events related to carcinoma lethality are poorly characterized. 
Herein we conducted an observational, prospective, case-control study enrolling 
21 patients with solid tumors and 10 patients without known malignancy, 
complemented by a retrospective validation cohort of 1,250 patients with cancer. 
In our prospective cohort, we observed spikes in circulating tumor cell (CTC) 
counts, particularly clusters, immediately before death (P < 0.0001), as well as 
pathological evidence of macrovascular infiltration and large-vessel occlusion 
obtained through rapid autopsy. In the validation cohort, radiological evidence 
of macrovascular infiltration emerged as the strongest predictor of poor 
survival-independent of metastasis-in treatment-homogeneous patients with 
colorectal, lung, ovarian, hepatocellular or pancreatic cancer (hazard 
ratios = 4.0-22.4). Collectively, these findings suggest that macrovascular 
infiltration and spikes in CTC clusters with consequent vascular failure could 
be pivotal end-of-life events associated with cancer lethality, providing a 
rationale for future trials aimed at curbing infiltration into large vessels.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, 
necessitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies. In the present 
study, we identified TP53-regulating kinase (TP53RK) as a critical regulator of 
CRC cell survival and proliferation using a custom clustered regularly 
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 
library screen targeting serine/threonine kinase-related genes. TP53RK was 
significantly overexpressed in CRC tissues and was correlated with copy number 
amplification. Functional validation revealed that TP53RK depletion induced DNA 
replication stress, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest, independent from p53 
status. Mechanistically, TP53RK stabilized cell division cycle 7 (CDC7), a key 
kinase regulating DNA replication origin activation, ensuring robust 
minichromosome maintenance complex protein (MCM) phosphorylation and replication 
fork progression. Disruption of the TP53RK-CDC7 axis led to reduced MCM2 
enrichment at replication origins and impaired DNA replication dynamics. 
Moreover, TP53RK overexpression sensitized cells to DNA replication stress 
(aphidicolin) and CDC7 inhibition (XL413), highlighting its potential as a 
therapeutic strategy. These findings establish TP53RK as a pivotal regulator of 
DNA replication fidelity and genomic stability, thereby providing a promising 
therapeutic target for CRC.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the expression of Chitinase-3-like 
protein-1 (CHI3L1) in gastric cancer (GC) tissues and serum from patients, 
analyze the correlation between CHI3L1 expression and GC patients' 
clinicopathological parameters, evaluate its impact on patient prognosis and the 
tumor immune microenvironment, and explore the potential of CHI3L1 as a 
diagnostic biomarker in GC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of CHI3L1 in GC was investigated using 
data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and TIMER databases. The association 
between CHI3L1 expression and prognosis in GC patients was analyzed through the 
TCGA database. Serum samples were collected from 87 patients with GC, 38 
patients with gastric precancerous lesions, and 42 healthy volunteers. The 
levels of CHI3L1 in serum specimens were measured via chemiluminescent 
immunoassay (CLIA), and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 
employed to further evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of CHI3L1. Gene Set 
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using gene sets from the Molecular 
Signatures Database (MsigDB). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted on correlated genes 
obtained from the LinkedOmics database. Additionally, the CIBERSORT algorithm 
was applied to investigate the correlation between CHI3L1 and gastric cancer 
immune infiltration, aiming to explore the potential mechanisms of CHI3L1 in GC.
RESULTS: CHI3L1 expression was significantly upregulated in GC (P < 0.05) and 
exhibited strong correlations with GC subtypes, tumor differentiation grade, 
primary tumor status, regional lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, 
clinical stage, Borrmann classification, and tumor size (all P < 0.05). 
Prognostic analysis revealed correlations between patient survival and age, 
primary tumor status, regional lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, 
clinical stage, new tumor events, and residual tumor (all P < 0.05). Notably, 
CHI3L1 demonstrated high diagnostic efficacy for GC (In the TCGA database: 
AUC = 0.861, P < 0.0001; For the serum samples: AUC = 0.932, P < 0.0001). Gene 
Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) suggested that CHI3L1 is involved in multiple 
oncogenic signaling pathways, including the NF-κB, IL-17, and ECM-receptor 
interaction pathways. Functional enrichment analysis further linked CHI3L1 to 
inflammatory response and immune regulation, while immune infiltration analysis 
via CIBERSORT indicated significant correlations between CHI3L1 expression and 
infiltration levels of multiple immune cell types.
CONCLUSIONS: CHI3L1, an oncogenic glycoprotein, is highly expressed in GC and 
involved in immune infiltration, holding promise as a diagnostic biomarker for 
GC.

Recent evidence from the CHALLENGE trial confirms that structured exercise can 
significantly improve survival outcomes in colon cancer survivors, reinforcing 
the principle that exercise is medicine. However, implementing personalized and 
scalable rehabilitation programs remains challenging. This paper explores how 
artificial intelligence (AI), when integrated with the International 
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework, can 
transform cancer rehabilitation through personalized exercise prescriptions, 
real-time monitoring, virtual coaching, and data-driven decision-making. We also 
discuss the role of emerging technologies such as virtual reality, wearables, 
and telehealth in expanding access to care. While limitations regarding data 
bias, equity, and regulation persist, strategic research and implementation 
efforts are essential. A multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach is needed 
to harness AI's potential in the era of digital health.

BACKGROUND: Adipocytes are engaged in the development and progression of breast 
cancer (BC). Cancer-associated adipocytes (CAAs) are specific adipocytes located 
at the invasive front of BC that modulate tumor behaviors. This study aimed to 
investigate the effect of CAA-derived IL-6 in regulating BC progression.
METHODS: Human BC specimens and adipocytes co-cultured with BC cells were used 
to explore the characteristics of CAAs. Adipocytes and 4T1 cells co-implanted in 
mouse model and tail vein metastasis model were used to explore the effect of 
CAAs on malignant progression and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) 
of BC in vivo. The functional assays, flow cytometry, ELISA, miRNAs sequencing 
and dual-luciferase reporter assay were implemented to investigate the role of 
CAA-derived IL-6 in regulating programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) 
expression.
RESULTS: CAAs were present at the invasive front of BC with a de-differentiated 
fibroblast phenotype. CAAs enhanced the malignant behaviors of 4T1 BC cells in 
vitro, and promoted 4T1 tumor growth and lung metastasis with decreased CD8+T 
cells and upregulated Tregs. The IHC results of both human BC specimens and 
xenografts showed that CAAs could upregulate PD-L1 expression in BC. Besides, 
CAAs could secrete abundant IL-6 and thus enhanced PD-L1 expression in 4T1 cells 
and tumors. More importantly, CAA-derived IL-6 could activate STAT3, while STAT3 
blockade in CAA-cultured 4T1 cells upregulated miRNA-497a-5p expression and 
downregulated PD-L1 expression. Dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that 
PD-L1 was a direct target of miRNA-497a-5p.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that CAAs promoted the malignant behaviors 
of BC and enhanced immunosuppression in TME. Specifically, CAA-derived IL-6 
promoted the PD-L1 expression of BC via STAT3/miR-497a-5p signaling, thereby 
contributing to BC progression.

PD-1 (Programmed cell death protein 1) located on T cells, binds to PD-L1 
(Programmed cell death ligand 1) on cancer cells, to suppress T cell activation 
and enable immune evasion. Hitherto, reviews have mainly highlighted the role of 
PD-1/PD-L1 in anti-cancer immunomodulation, anti-cancer therapy resistance, and 
immune-related adverse events. However, there are critical modes of enhancement 
of therapeutic efficacy, which remain underappreciated. This review provides a 
holistic perspective on: (a) a comprehensive analysis of recent clinical trials 
targeting PD-1/PD-L1, specifically on the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors 
(ICIs); (b) the underlying molecular mechanisms of immune surveillance; (c) the 
role of ubiquitin-mediated post-translational modifications (PTMs, viz the 
ubiquitin machinery); and (d) the gut microbiome crosstalk with the PD-1/PD-L1 
axis, which influences the tumor microenvironment (TME). Clarity gained from 
opinions exerted from these four factors, in this review, will provide insights 
on improving cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, thus bridging 
translational research to the clinic. These standpoints will be presented with a 
view to advocating the integration of precision medicine with AI, to accelerate 
the discovery of more effective ICIs and enhance mono-/combinatorial drug 
strategies for PD-1/PD-L1-targeted therapy. Altogether, this review opines that 
AI-driven analytics will provoke an innovative impact on promoting clinical 
outcomes beneficial for cancer patients.

While CDK4/6 inhibitors improved clinical outcomes in HR+HER2- metastatic breast 
cancer (MBC), resistance invariably occurs. The underlying molecular mechanisms 
are not actionable, leaving limited therapeutic options for progressing 
patients. Recent data highlight a role for IL-6 in the resistance of HR+HER2- 
MBC to CDK4/6 inhibition, potentially opening novel avenues forward.

Immunotherapy has transformed cancer care, but most patients do not respond and 
ultimately develop resistance. A central barrier to durable efficacy is the 
absence of robust, tumor-specific T cell responses, particularly in tumors 
characterized by low antigenicity and an immunosuppressive tumor 
microenvironment. Cancer vaccines, long explored with limited clinical success 
as monotherapies, are emerging as enablers of immunotherapy by restoring T cell 
priming, broadening neoantigen-specific repertoires and converting tumors from 
'cold' to 'hot'. Advances in genomics and computational neoantigen prediction 
have reinvigorated the field. In this Review, we synthesize current knowledge on 
the immunobiology of T cell priming in cancer, define how cancer vaccines can 
address the multifaceted mechanisms of immune evasion, and outline principles 
for designing next-generation vaccine-based combinations. We also propose that 
integration of vaccines into immunotherapy regimens, guided by tumor-specific 
immune contexture, antigen selection and treatment sequencing, might expand the 
benefit of immunotherapy to a broader patient population.

INTRODUCTION: The standard first-line management of advanced ovarian cancer (OC) 
comprises cytoreductive (debulking) surgery followed by platinum-based 
chemotherapy, most commonly a combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel (PTX). 
However, the development of resistance to PTX frequently compromises treatment 
efficacy, resulting in disease recurrence and poorer clinical outcomes. Although 
the metabolic mechanisms underlying carboplatin resistance have been extensively 
characterised, the specific metabolic alterations contributing to PTX resistance 
remain poorly understood.
OBJECTIVES: We applied untargeted metabolomics to systematically characterise 
PTX resistance-associated metabolic reprogramming in OC, aiming to identify 
targetable vulnerabilities to enhance the platinum-taxane efficacy.
METHODS: Using an isogenic in vitro model of acquired PTX-resistance (OVCAR8 
PTX) and its parental counterpart (OVCAR8 PAR), we analysed intracellular 
(endometabolome) and extracellular (exometabolome) metabolites via gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
RESULTS: Multivariate and univariate analyses (│effect size│ ≥ 1.4, 
p-value ≤ 0.01) revealed a distinct metabolic signature in the endometabolome of 
PTX-resistant cells. These cells exhibited significantly elevated levels of 
glycine, myo-inositol, pyroglutamate, proline and taurine, alongside reduced 
levels of glycerol, glucose and glutamate. Pathway analysis identified putative 
alterations in redox regulation (glutathione metabolism), energy metabolism 
(galactose and glyoxylate/dicarboxylate metabolism), amino acid metabolism 
(arginine and proline), and osmotic stress pathways (taurine and hypotaurine 
metabolism).
CONCLUSIONS: The identified metabolic signature highlights dysregulated pathways 
(e.g., glutathione metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism) that may be 
actionable targets for reversing PTX resistance. Pharmacological modulation of 
these pathways could restore chemosensitivity, providing a rational strategy to 
improve platinum-taxane efficacy in advanced OC.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer remains a major global health challenge, with the 
highest incidence and mortality rates observed in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite 
progress in prevention and treatment, the management of advanced and recurrent 
disease remains difficult.
AIM: This review explores the potential role of cannabinoids in cervical cancer 
therapy, with a focus on their integration into existing treatment strategies, 
combination therapies, and nanotechnology-based delivery systems.
METHODS: A critical synthesis of preclinical studies and emerging therapeutic 
approaches was conducted, examining the anticancer properties of cannabinoids, 
their mechanisms of action, and their application within combination and 
nanotechnology-based treatment modalities.
RESULTS: Cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) 
demonstrate anticancer effects by inducing apoptosis, inhibiting cell 
proliferation, and suppressing metastasis. Mechanistic studies highlight their 
ability to promote oxidative stress, modulate key signalling pathways, and 
influence immune responses in cervical cancer cells. Combination therapies 
involving cannabinoids with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy show 
enhanced efficacy and reduced drug resistance. Furthermore, nanotechnology-based 
delivery systems offer advantages including targeted drug release, improved 
solubility, controlled dosing, and decreased systemic toxicity.
CONCLUSION: Cannabinoids represent a promising adjunct in cervical cancer 
management. However, successful clinical translation requires optimisation of 
formulations, establishment of dosing protocols, and comprehensive safety 
evaluation. Future research should also explore biomarker-driven personalised 
medicine approaches. Standardisation, along with addressing regulatory and 
ethical challenges, will be crucial for the integration of cannabinoid-based 
therapies into mainstream cervical cancer treatment.

The necessity of total thyroidectomy for Graves' disease (GD) remains a subject 
of debate due to lifelong thyroxine replacement therapy. However, total 
thyroidectomy is a definitive treatment and allows for the detection of 
incidental thyroid cancer (ITC), which may necessitate further surgical 
intervention if not initially treated. This study aimed to investigate the 
prevalence, clinicopathological characteristics, and risk factors associated 
with ITC in GD patients undergoing total thyroidectomy. We conducted a 
retrospective cohort study of 86 GD patients who underwent total thyroidectomy 
from January 2016 to December 2022. Clinical and pathological characteristics 
were analyzed to determine potential risk factors associated with ITC. The 
incidence of ITC was 15.1% (13/86), predominantly papillary thyroid 
microcarcinoma (PTMC) at 9.3% (8/86). Patients with ITC were significantly older 
(mean age 45.2 years vs. 36 years, p = 0.017) and more frequently presented 
thyroid nodules on ultrasound (84.6% vs. 45.2%, p = 0.014). Multivariate 
analysis identified thyroid volume as a significant protective factor, with each 
1 mL increase reducing ITC risk by approximately 6% (p = 0.009). Older age, 
smaller thyroid volume, and the presence of thyroid nodules on ultrasound were 
significantly associated with increased ITC risk. A larger thyroid volume may be 
associated with a lower risk of ITC. Careful preoperative evaluation, including 
assessment of thyroid nodules on ultrasound, is advised in older patients and 
those with smaller glands. Surgical decisions should be guided by individual 
risk factors and shared decision-making.

Although generally unknown, the age of a newly diagnosed tumor encodes valuable 
etiologic and prognostic information. Here, we estimate the age of breast 
cancers, defined as the time from the start of growth to detection, using a 
measure of epigenetic entropy derived from genome-wide methylation arrays. Based 
on an ensemble of neutrally fluctuating CpG (fCpG) sites, this stochastic 
epigenetic clock differs from conventional clocks that measure age-related 
increases in methylation. We show that younger tumors exhibit hallmarks of 
aggressiveness, such as increased proliferation and genomic instability, whereas 
older tumors are characterized by elevated immune infiltration, indicative of 
enhanced immune surveillance. These findings suggest that the clock captures a 
tumor's effective growth rate resulting from the evolutionary-ecological 
competition between intrinsic growth potential and external systemic pressures. 
Because of the clock's ability to differentiate old and stable from young and 
aggressive tumors, it has potential applications in risk stratification of 
early-stage breast cancers and guiding early detection efforts.

Accurate ovarian cancer screening and diagnosis are critical for patient 
survival. We present UMORSS, an AI-assisted diagnostic system integrating 
ultrasound (US) imaging and clinical data with uncertainty quantification for 
precise ovarian cancer risk assessment. Developed and evaluated using a 
multicentre dataset (7352 patients, 7594 lesions, 9281 US images), UMORSS 
employs a two-phase approach: Phase I rapidly triages low-risk lesions via 
initial US analysis, and Phase II provides uncertainty-aware multimodal analysis 
for complex cases. Phase I accurately identified 68.7% of physiological cysts 
and 13.8% of benign tumours as low-risk, with zero false negatives, and Phase II 
achieved an AUC of 0.955 (internal testing) and 0.926 (external validation). 
Furthermore, a prospective reader study (n = 284 cases, six radiologists) 
demonstrated that UMORSS as a human-AI collaborative tool increased 
radiologists' average AUC by 10.58% and sensitivity by 22.48%. UMORSS shows 
strong potential to streamline clinical workflow, optimize resource allocation, 
and standardize ovarian cancer diagnosis.

Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (METAP2), one of the two enzymes responsible for 
removing the N-terminal methionine from nascent proteins, has emerged as a 
potential drug target for cancer therapy. Yet, its role in ovarian cancer 
remains largely elusive. Here, we demonstrated that METAP2 is upregulated in 
ovarian cancer tissues and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. 
Consistently, METAP2 knockdown significantly suppresses the proliferation and 
migration of ovarian cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, 
co-immunoprecipitation analysis identified YTHDF2 as a key interactor of METAP2. 
METAP2 interacts with YTHDF2 and attenuates its K48-linked ubiquitination at 
lysine 245, thereby preventing proteasomal degradation. Importantly, using 
AlphaFold3 algorithm, we elucidated and then experimentally validated that the 
Gln342 to Phe361 region of YTHDF2 interacts with the Thr240 to Gly358 region of 
METAP2. Furthermore, we identified BMF, LXRA, and HIVEP2 as functionally 
critical downstream targets of the METAP2-YTHDF2 axis, which are essential for 
ovarian cancer cells proliferation, migration and invasion. Additionally, we 
validated the therapeutic potential of the METAP2 inhibitor ZGN-1061 in ovarian 
cancer models. In conclusion, our findings reveal that METAP2 drives ovarian 
cancer progression by promoting YTHDF2-mediated mRNA decay of BMF/LXRA/HIVEP2, 
highlighting METAP2 as a potential therapeutic target for ovarian cancer.

Recent efforts by numerous organizations and societies have found limited 
scientific evidence to support oncology nutrition guideline development. This 
project was undertaken to describe oncology nutrition studies that are underway 
or recently completed and to evaluate factors related to the completion and 
publication of study findings. Searches of ClinicalTrials.gov and the Australian 
New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry were performed in January 2025 using 
combinations of the terms: cancer, nutrition, diet, and oncology. Search results 
were merged and duplicates were removed using R/RStudio, and then, each entry 
was manually reviewed for eligibility in REDCap. Eligibility criteria were as 
follows: a study start date between January 2015 and December 2024, participants 
who were actively receiving cancer treatment, and a measure of diet/nutritional 
status and/or a nutrition intervention. Descriptive statistics, including 
stratified analyses, were conducted in R/RStudio. The database searches 
identified 1866 unique study listings. After exclusion criteria were applied, 
444 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies (n = 352, 79.3%) were 
intervention studies. The vast majority of studies (n = 380, 85.6%) were funded 
by sources other than government (n = 48, 10.8%) or industry (n = 16, 3.6%) 
grants. Nine broad categories of study topics were identified, with the most 
common being intake of specific nutrients/supplements (n = 173), 
prehabilitation/perioperative nutrition (n = 153), quality of life, 
symptom/toxicity management (n = 136), and nutrition assessment, counseling, and 
education (n = 100). Median target enrollment for the included studies was 80 
participants (range: 1-10,000). Less than a third of completed studies had 
published findings as of January 1, 2025. Larger, rigorously designed trials are 
needed for inclusion in future evidence-based guideline development efforts.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. To evaluate the 
real-world effectiveness of Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and adjuvant 
chemotherapy (ACT), we conducted a retrospective study comparing their impact on 
breast cancer prognosis. We retrieved data from the SEER database. We applied 
propensity score matching (PSM) to minimize confounding factors. Breast-cancer 
specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between the two 
groups. We also developed a nomogram prognostic model using clinicopathological 
parameters to predict survival rates. We identified 46,447 eligible patients in 
the SEER database. After PSM, 9,025 patients were included in each group, with 
11,762 patients receiving NACT and 34,685 undergoing ACT before PSM. In the PSM 
cohort, the 5-year BCSS and OS were 88.3% (95% CI: 87.6-89.0%) and 85.7% (95% 
CI: 84.9-86.5%) for the NACT group, respectively. Notably, patients in the ACT 
group showed significantly better survival prognosis compared to those in the 
NACT group. We also developed nomograms to predict the 3-year, 5-year, and 
8-year OS and BCSS rates for patients receiving NACT or ACT. Breast cancer 
patients who undergo surgery followed by ACT have a more favorable prognosis 
compared to those receiving NACT before surgery.

Cervical cancer is a major global health issue, particularly in developing 
countries. Pap smear-based cervical cancer screening (CCS) is crucial for 
prevention. The Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) aids in understanding 
psychological factors influencing CCS behaviors. This study investigated CCS 
determinants among Iranian women using Rogers' PMT. This cross-sectional study 
involved 254 women visiting health centers in Kermanshah and Tehran in 2024. A 
modified PMT was used with a validated questionnaire measuring fear, perceived 
vulnerability, perceived intensity, response efficacy, self-efficacy, response 
cost, demographics, and CCS-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Path 
analysis was conducted using AMOS. Participants exhibited a mean CCS behavior 
score of 3.62 (SD = 2.07). Path analysis revealed significant negative total 
effects on CCS behavior for fear (Standardized Estimate = -0.238, p = 0.009), 
response cost (Standardized Estimate = -0.111, p = 0.006), and perceived 
vulnerability (Standardized Estimate = -0.064, p = 0.021). Conversely, positive 
total effects on CCS behavior were observed for response efficacy (Standardized 
Estimate = 0.049, p = 0.003), protection motivation (Standardized 
Estimate = 0.155, p = 0.01), self-efficacy (Standardized Estimate = 0.106, 
p = 0.007), knowledge (Standardized Estimate = 0.011, p = 0.002), and attitude 
(Standardized Estimate = 0.052, p = 0.007). Fear, response costs and perceived 
vulnerability negatively impact CCS behavior among Iranian women, while 
perceived intensity, response efficacy, protection motivation, knowledge, 
attitude, and self-efficacy are positive factors. The PMT-based model can guide 
educational programs to promote CCS behavior, informing targeted counseling and 
program development to enhance CCS uptake.

We aimed to conduct a systematic analysis of the multi-target regulatory 
mechanisms of Ziyu glycoside I (Ziyu I) in cervical cancer progression using 
network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques. Additionally, we 
validated our findings using cellular experiments and animal models. The 
PhamMapper database was used to identify drug targets for Ziyu I, while cervical 
cancer-related disease targets were obtained from the DisGeNET, DrugBank, 
GeneCards, and OMIM databases. In vitro, the effects of Ziyu I on the 
proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and cell cycle were assessed using cultured 
HeLa and SiHa cervical cancer cells. Network pharmacology analysis identified 68 
potential targets of Ziyu I in cervical cancer. Molecular docking findings 
revealed that Ziyu I had a stable binding ability to MAPK1, MAPK8, and MAPK14, 
which are key targets in the MAPK signaling pathway. Cellular experiments 
revealed that Ziyu I significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of 
cervical cancer cells and promoted apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Finally, a 
nude mice-loaded tumor assay revealed that Ziyu I had significant anti-cervical 
cancer activity in vivo. Ziyu I inhibits cervical cancer progression through a 
multitarget regulatory network involving MAPK signaling pathway-mediated 
inhibition of cell proliferation and migration, apoptosis activation, and cell 
cycle arrest.

This study was conducted to examine the relationship between the spiritual care 
needs and religious tendencies of cancer patients. The sample of the study 
consists of 245 patients treated in the oncology department of a state hospital 
in eastern Türkiye. Data were collected via face‒to-face meetings technique with 
inpatients between April and September 2024. The ""Socio-demographic and Clinical 
Characteristics Form"", ""Spiritual care needs Assessment Scale of Patients with 
Cancer"" and ""Religious Tendency Scale"" were used for data collection. 51% of the 
participants were female, 76.7% were married, 38% were university graduates, 
62.4% had a medium income level and 84.5% received help with their care. The 
correlation analysis revealed a positive and moderately significant relationship 
between patients' religious tendencies and their spiritual care needs (r: 0.463, 
p < 0.001), meaning that as the patients' spiritual care needs increased so did 
their religious tendencies. In this study, it was revealed as a result of the 
Wald statistical value that the spiritual care needs of the patients had a great 
impact on their religious tendencies.

well as immunohistochemistry staining of CD68[Formula: see text], CD3[Formula: 
see text], and [Formula: see text] cells, was completed for biopsies collected 
before and 2 weeks following the first fraction of HDR-BT. Regression 
techniques, constructed using GBR-NMF scores, that produced the most accurate 
predictions of immune cell density by metrics of root mean-squared error (RMSE) 
and R[Formula: see text] were the gradient-boosted trees model of [Formula: see 
text] density (RMSE: 163 counts[Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]: 0.65) 
and the elastic net model of [Formula: see text]/ [Formula: see text] (RMSE: 
0.25, [Formula: see text]: 0.82). The accuracy of these models, herein defined 
as the fraction of patient predictions within [Formula: see text] standard 
deviation of their measured values was 11/16 and 12/16, for CD68[Formula: see 
text] CD3[Formula: see text] and CD68[Formula: see text]/ CD8[Formula: see text] 
models, respectively. To further delineate which metabolites were most important 
in the CD68[Formula: see text]/ CD8[Formula: see text] model, this ratio was 
further predicted in stromal and epithelial tissues within the biopsies, and 
resulting models utilized the GBR-NMF scores of glutathione, collagen, palmitic 
acid, and the pre- or post-HDR-BT label to produce an optimal performance level 
according to RMSE and R[Formula: see text]. In summary, this study illustrates a 
novel methodology in which supervised machine learning techniques are used to 
model immune cells, which are prognostic indicators of disease progression.

There is a Limited number of studies on THO Complex Subunit 3 (THOC3) in tumors. 
The purpose of this study is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of various 
types of tumors to determine the role of THOC3 in tumor progression and to 
investigate its impact on immunity. Retrieved THOC3 expression data from various 
cancers in the TCGA database and analyzed it using R software (version 3.6.4) 
and its related packages; explored the differential expression of THOC3 in 
tumors, its correlation with prognosis, functional enrichment, and its 
relationship with tumor heterogeneity. The study also aimed to uncover the 
correlation between THOC3 and tumor immunity. THOC3 is differentially expressed 
in various tumors and normal samples, and is correlated with overall survival 
and progression-free time. The study found that THOC3 expression is strongly 
associated with tumor mutational burden, microsatellite deletion, and immune 
response. The expression of THOC3 is significantly correlated with immune cell 
infiltration, and THOC3 can regulate transcription output and mRNA splicing. 
Therefore, we speculate that THOC3 could serve as a therapeutic target for 
future anticancer therapies. THOC3 can serve as a novel specific biomarker for 
diagnosis and prognosis in pan cancer.

Despite significant advances in early detection and therapeutic interventions, 
breast cancer persists as the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the 
leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally. Although multiple 
prognostic signatures have been proposed, their predictive power and clinical 
applicability remain limited. In this study, we utilized an integrated approach 
combining single-cell multi-omics analysis with machine learning to 
comprehensively examine the clinical relevance of mitochondrial-related gene 
sets in TCGA-BRCA and developed a mitochondrial gene set scoring system, termed 
MitoScore. Based on the median of MitoScore, BRCA patients were classified into 
high-risk and low-risk groups. Our multi-omics analysis revealed that BRCA 
patients with higher Mitoscore exhibited poorer prognoses compared to those with 
lower MitoScore. The predictive ability of the model was successfully validated 
using an external GEO dataset. Immune infiltration analysis further indicated 
that high-risk group contributed to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, 
marked by a decrease in CD8+ T cells. This finding was corroborated by cell-cell 
communication analysis, which revealed abnormal activation of the MIF-CXCR4 
signaling axis. Notably, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) emerged as the 
most critical factor in the MitoScore model. CPS1 was significantly upregulated 
in malignant BRCA cells and was closely associated with tumor aggressiveness and 
poor prognosis. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed the role of CPS1 
in BRCA. In this study, CPS1 was identified as a metabolism-related oncogene, 
suggesting its involvement in enhancing glycolysis and mediating immune evasion 
in breast cancer cells. Knockdown of CPS1 markedly improved the efficacy of 
anti-PD-1 therapy in immunocompetent mice, prolonged survival, and ameliorated 
the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In summary, this study underscores 
the clinical significance of mitochondrial genes in BRCA, proposes Mitoscore for 
precise patient stratification and personalized treatment, and highlights the 
therapeutic potential of targeting CPS1 to simultaneously modulate glycolysis 
and immune evasion mechanisms.

Despite the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer, many patients do 
not respond or relapse following treatment. Therefore, new approaches to augment 
existing immunotherapies are needed. CRISPR screens have revealed the importance 
of TNF-α signal transduction mediators, such as TAK1, in facilitating tumor 
susceptibility to cytotoxic T cells. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of 
TAK1 in tumor cells lowers the threshold for TNF-α-induced cytotoxicity. Upon 
TNF-α signaling, pharmacologic inhibition of TAK1 sensitized tumor cells to 
RIPK1-dependent apoptosis. However, RIPK1-independent apoptosis occurred upon 
genetic deletion of Tak1, suggesting a novel scaffolding function of TAK1 is 
required to induce RIPK1 kinase activity during cell death. Deleting Tak1 
impaired in vivo tumor growth, enhanced α-PD-1 immunotherapy, and lead to 
durable anti-tumor memory, dependent on CD8 T cells and intact TNF-α signaling. 
Our results collectively demonstrate that compromising TAK1 function within 
tumor cells leverages the cytotoxic capacity of TNF to enhance anti-tumor 
immunity and generate deeper and more durable anti-tumor immune responses in 
preclinical models of cancer.

Neutrophils are integral components of the bone marrow and stromal cell network. 
They express the immune checkpoint molecule PD-L1 and can induce T cell 
exhaustion, thereby promoting immunosuppression. In this study, we investigated 
whether tumor-derived Cldn7 deficiency could recruit polymorphonuclear 
neutrophils (PMNs), induce their metabolic reprogramming, and consequently drive 
their transition toward a pro-tumor phenotype, leading to the establishment of 
an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Using single-cell RNA 
sequencing, clinical sample validation, and both in vivo and in vitro 
experiments, we found that Cldn7 deficiency in colorectal cancer (CRC) results 
in a tumor microenvironment characterized by significantly increased 
infiltration of CD11b⁺ Ly6G⁺ neutrophils. This is accompanied by neutrophil 
metabolic reprogramming that facilitates their phenotypic shift toward a 
tumor-promoting state, which in turn suppresses the cytotoxic function of CD8⁺ T 
cells and contributes to the formation of an immunosuppressive TME, thereby 
accelerating CRC progression. Mechanistically, Cldn7 deficiency indirectly 
activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to elevated secretion of 
chemokines such as CXCL1 that are responsible for PMN recruitment. Inhibition of 
the NF-κB/CXCL1 axis reduces PMN infiltration, decreases PD-L1 expression on 
neutrophils, suppresses neutrophil glycolysis and histone lactylation, reverses 
the exhausted phenotype of CD8⁺ T cells, thereby mitigating the 
immunosuppressive microenvironment. Furthermore, overexpression of Cldn7 
enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy.Collectively, 
our findings indicate that Cldn7 deficiency not only contributes to immune 
evasion and malignant progression in CRC but also plays a critical role in 
immune modulation. Targeting PMN metabolic reprogramming and immunosuppressive 
function associated with Cldn7 loss may offer a promising strategy to improve 
the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy in CRC.

Primary prostate cancer presents with multifocal lesions and unpredictable 
clinical behavior, posing significant challenges for effective prognosis. To 
address this, we investigate the epigenomic landscape of prostate tumor biopsies 
from 25 treatment-naïve male patients by analyzing chromatin 
compartmentalization patterns. Our analysis reveals two distinct molecular 
subtypes: one with a Low Degree of Decompartmentalization (LDD) and another with 
a High Degree of Decompartmentalization (HDD). Here we show that the HDD 
subgroup exhibits extensive chromatin reorganization associated with diminished 
oncogenic potential. This subtype shows repression of molecular pathways 
involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and cellular plasticity. From this 
distinction, we derive an 18-gene transcriptional signature capable of 
differentiating HDD from LDD cases. Importantly, we validate the prognostic 
relevance of this signature in multiple independent cohorts totaling over 900 
patients. Our findings suggest that epigenetic-derived signature at the time of 
diagnostic biopsy can offer a powerful tool for risk stratification in prostate 
cancer.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a significant global health burden, 
contributing significantly to cancer-related mortality. The underlying genetic 
and metabolic underpinnings of CRC remain incompletely understood. In this 
study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into metabolic perturbations 
in 29 CRC patients utilizing targeted omics approaches, compared to public 
databases. Additionally, we examined serum and tissue samples from 12 patients, 
with and without preoperative glucose challenge, using targeted metabolomics to 
investigate glucose and fructose metabolism. Notably, elevated levels of serum 
D-Fructose and L-Lactic acid following glucose administration indicate augmented 
glycolytic activity and polyol pathway-mediated glucose conversion (to 
fructose). Despite variations in tumor responses, our results underscore the 
potential significance of fructose metabolism in CRC progression, shedding light 
on therapeutic avenues targeting the Warburg effect. This research lays a solid 
foundation for future translational research into metabolic interventions in CRC 
treatment and enhances our understanding of cancer-related metabolic 
reprogramming.

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) serves as the rate-limiting enzyme in 
gluconeogenesis and can be categorized into two subtypes: FBP1 and FBP2. FBP1 
has been reported to exhibit reduced expression and impaired function in various 
malignant tumors. However, there is limited research investigating the role of 
FBP2 in tumorigenesis. Our results showed that the expression level of FBP2 in 
gastric cancer (GC) tissues was reduced compared to that in adjacent non-tumor 
tissues. Low FBP2 expression was correlated with adverse clinicopathological 
characteristics and unfavorable prognosis. Overexpression of FBP2 in GC cells 
resulted in a decreased expression level of hypoxia inducible factor-1α 
(HIF-1α), enhanced oxidative phosphorylation, and a modest reduction in 
glycolytic activity. Notably, the FBP2 has been shown to elevate the expression 
level of hexokinase domain-containing protein-1 (HKDC1). Both cellular and 
animal studies demonstrated that the overexpression of FBP2 or the knockdown of 
HKDC1 could attenuate the malignant biological behavior of GC. Moreover, the 
synergistic effect of these two approaches exerted a more potent anti-tumor 
response. Overall, the synergistic effect of FBP2 and HKDC1 can suppress the 
progression of GC through the promotion of oxidative phosphorylation and 
inhibition of glycolysis. FBP2 and HKDC1 are anticipated to serve as novel 
molecular markers for the diagnosis, targeted therapy, and prognosis of GC.

NK cell-based immunotherapy of solid tumors has been shown to be increasingly 
successful, but much effort is still needed to optimize its efficacy. This study 
explores the effects of treatment with low, non-toxic doses of IFN-γ and TNF-α 
on the susceptibility of breast cancer (BC) cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and 
MDA-MB-468) cultured in 2D and 3D as spheroids, to NK cell-mediated antitumor 
function. We evaluated the expression of (i) ligands for NK cell-activating 
receptors on BC cells, (ii) death and adhesion molecules on BC cells, and (iii) 
the expression of NK cell-receptors on NK cells infiltrating BC spheroids. 
Cytokine treatment significantly increased the expression of FAS, TRAIL-R2, and 
ICAM-1 in all BC cell lines, enhancing NK cell-mediated apoptosis and promoting 
NK cell-tumor cell conjugate formation. Differently, the expression of ligands 
for activating receptors remained essentially unchanged. In BC spheroids, the 
treatment with IFN-γ and TNF-α enhanced NK-cell infiltration, with increased 
expression of activating receptors (NKG2D, DNAM-1, NKp30, and NKp46) on 
infiltrating NK cells. However, regardless of treatment, markers of NK cell 
exhaustion, such as PD-1 and CTLA-4, were also upregulated, the latter 
especially in triple-negative BC (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 spheroids, thus suggesting an 
exhausted phenotype of NK cells infiltrating spheroids despite activation. 
Cytokine treatment resulted in a significant NK cell-mediated reduction in 
spheroid size, accompanied by an increased apoptotic state, with effects more 
pronounced in MCF-7 than in MDA-MB-231 spheroids. These results indicate that, 
although the treatment with IFN-γ and TNF-α improves NK cell-mediated tumor 
interaction and apoptosis, its therapeutic efficacy may be dependent on the BC 
subtype, with TNBC spheroids showing greater resistance. These findings 
highlight the importance of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in shaping NK cell 
responses and suggest that combining IFN-γ and TNF-α treatments with 
NK-cell-based immunotherapeutic strategies may improve treatment outcomes, 
particularly for more aggressive BC subtypes.

INTRODUCTION: Cancer vaccine immunotherapy has shifted from traditional 
cytotoxic treatments toward strategies aimed at enhancing anti-tumor immunity, 
offering new therapeutic possibilities. Montanide ISA-51, a water-in-oil (W/O) 
emulsion, has shown considerable promise as an adjuvant in cancer vaccines.
AREAS COVERED: This review examines the current applications of Montanide ISA-51 
in cancer vaccines, explores its immunoregulatory mechanisms, highlights the 
challenges in its use as a vaccine adjuvant, and proposes avenues for future 
optimization.
EXPERT OPINION: Montanide ISA-51 enhances anti-tumor immune responses by 
improving antigen release and facilitating immune cell aggregation and 
activation, thereby boosting the effectiveness of vaccines against melanoma, 
glioma, and HPV-related cancers. When combined with TLR agonists or other 
immunomodulatory agents, Montanide ISA-51 further amplifies the immune response. 
However, despite its potential, the precise mechanisms underlying its effects in 
the complex immune environment remain to be fully understood. These insights 
will accelerate the translation of Montanide ISA-51 into clinical use as an 
adjuvant for cancer vaccines.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the characteristics linked to long-term opioid therapy 
(L-TOT) discontinuation may inform safer and personalised discontinuation 
strategies. This study aimed to identify factors associated with L-TOT 
discontinuation in people with chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) in UK primary 
care.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using the Clinical Practice Research 
Datalink Aurum data (2000-2020) was conducted. Adults with CNCP receiving L-TOT 
(three or more opioid prescriptions within 90 days or ≥90 days' supply within 
the first year, excluding the first 30 days) were included. Discontinuation was 
defined as opioid-free for ≥180 days after an L-TOT. Mixed-effects logistic 
models with a random intercept for general practice were used to identify 
sociodemographic, comorbidities, lifestyle, and pharmacological factors 
associated with L-TOT discontinuation.
RESULTS: Among 573 639 L-TOT users, 5.2% (n=29 589) discontinued within the 
first year. Discontinuation was more likely among Asians (adjusted odds ratio 
[aOR], 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.39; P<0.001), Blacks (aOR, 
1.21; 95% CI, 1.13-1.31; P<0.001), non-smokers (aOR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05-1.12; 
P<0.001), those living in the least deprived area (aOR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04-1.14; 
P<0.001), those using weak and short-acting opioids (aOR, 1.50; 95% CI, 
1.39-1.61), those with co-existing osteoarthritis (aOR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.11; 
P=0.003), those with anxiety (aOR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P=0.003), or those 
co-using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aOR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.09; 
P<0.001) or benzodiazepines (aOR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05-1.11; P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified key characteristics of people with CNCP who 
are more likely to discontinue L-TOT. This may help to inform the development of 
tailored interventions to promote safe opioid discontinuation in primary care.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related 
deaths globally, with a growing burden in Southeast Asia. This study aimed to 
assess pancreatic cancer trends, including incidence, mortality, and associated 
risk factors, across Southeast Asian countries using data from the Global Burden 
of Disease (GBD) Study 2021.
METHODS: We analyzed pancreatic cancer incidence, mortality, and 
age-standardized incidence (ASIR) and mortality (ASMR) rates from 1990 to 2021 
across Southeast Asia. The analysis included 15 countries grouped according to 
GBD's classification. We calculated the estimated annual percentage change 
(EAPC) in ASIR and ASMR and the mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR). We examined 
the correlation between cancer trends and the sociodemographic index (SDI). 
Additionally, risk factors contributing to pancreatic cancer mortality were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2021, pancreatic cancer incidence increased by 288.65 
%, while mortality rose by 287.07 % across Southeast Asia. Higher-SDI countries 
exhibited lower MIRs, while lower-SDI countries experienced higher MIRs. 
Metabolic risks and high fasting plasma glucose were the leading contributors to 
pancreatic cancer mortality, particularly in high-SDI countries, while smoking 
remained a significant risk in lower-SDI nations.
CONCLUSION: The substantial rise in pancreatic cancer burden across Southeast 
Asia highlights the need for improved healthcare infrastructure, especially in 
lower-SDI countries. Regional collaboration and targeted interventions focusing 
on early detection, treatment access, and modifiable risk factors are crucial to 
reducing pancreatic cancer mortality. Strengthening healthcare systems and 
public health initiatives will be vital to address this growing regional and 
global health challenge.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening reduces 
lung cancer mortality but may lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment, 
especially among the Asian LDCT screening population presenting with subsolid 
nodules (SSNs). Thus, we explored whether implementing chest X-ray (CXR) triage 
as a preliminary screening tool can improve patient selection and reduce 
unnecessary interventions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared patients who 
underwent direct LDCT screening with those who underwent LDCT and CXR triage. 
Medical records of 506 patients with SSNs ≤3cm from January 2006 to December 
2021 were reviewed. Primary outcomes included lung cancer prognosis, relapse, 
and histopathologic spectrum of lung adenocarcinoma to assess potential 
overdiagnosis. The CXR triage group consisted of patients who had both LDCT and 
CXR within 3 months, with CXR-visible nodules confirmed by surgical pathology. A 
1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was performed using age, sex, and nodule 
size, resulting in 97 matched pairs for balanced outcome comparison.
RESULTS: After PSM, 194 patients were analyzed. In the direct LDCT group, 37.1% 
of resected lesions were adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) or atypical adenomatous 
hyperplasia (AAH), indicating a higher likelihood of overdiagnosis. Conversely, 
the CXR triage group had no patients with AIS/AAH, a significant difference. No 
significant differences were observed in disease-free survival or relapse rates 
between groups during follow-up, suggesting that CXR triage may reduce 
overtreatment without negatively impacting short-term prognosis. Multivariate 
Cox regression revealed that age, sex, nodule size, smoking status, and 
screening method were not significant predictors of mortality. Kaplan-Meier 
survival analysis over 15 years showed similarly high survival rates in both 
groups, with no significant difference.
CONCLUSION: CXR triage is a preliminary step in LDCT screening for lung cancer, 
particularly in non-smoking Asian high-risk populations, to reduce unnecessary 
surgical procedures while preserving diagnostic effectiveness. Further 
prospective multicenter studies are needed to validate its long-term safety, 
cost-effectiveness, and acceptability in routine clinical practice.

PURPOSE: This study reports the real-world prevalence of therapeutic and/or 
disease-relevant oncogenic alterations in cancer research, specifically in the 
bladder cancer cohort of the American Association for Cancer Research Project 
Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) Biopharma Collaborative 
(BPC).
METHODS: The GENIE BPC bladder cancer cohort (v1.1) included adult patients with 
bladder cancer with genomic sequencing results reported between January 1, 2013, 
and December 31, 2018. The prevalence of alterations in PPARG, KRAS, TP53, 
FGFR3, ERBB2, ERBB3, EGFR, MET, B7-H3, and GPC3 was evaluated descriptively in 
the overall cohort and by stage of disease, patient demographics, and clinical 
characteristics.
RESULTS: The study included 716 patients. Median age at sequencing was 67.8 
years; most patients were male (76.5%) and non-Hispanic White (82.0%) and had a 
reported history of urothelial carcinoma (96.2%). The prevalence was 54.3% (95% 
CI: 50.6-58.0) for TP53 mutations, 4.3% (95% CI: 3.0-6.1) for KRAS hotspot 
mutations, 13.4% (95% CI: 11.0-16.1) for FGFR3 activating mutations, and 12.1% 
(95% CI: 9.7-14.9) for any PPARG amplification. Overall, prevalence of gene 
alterations was similar between patients with stage I-III disease and advanced 
or metastatic disease and across subgroups based on patient demographics and 
clinical characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of gene alterations is consistent with ranges 
reported in the literature. This analysis provides insights into the 
distribution of therapeutic or disease-relevant genetic biomarkers in patients 
with bladder cancer and helps the understanding of patient biomarker profile to 
support clinical development for patients with bladder cancer.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate for associations between the 
occurrence of palpitations in women prior to breast cancer surgery and single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for potassium channel genes.
METHODS: A total of 398 women were recruited prior to breast cancer surgery and 
provided detailed information on demographic and clinical characteristics. The 
occurrence of palpitations was assessed using a single item (ie, did you 
experience your ""heart race/pounds"" in the past week - yes or no). Blood samples 
were collected for genomic analyses and genotyping of single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) was done using a custom array. Multiple logistic regression 
analyses were used to identify associations between the occurrence of 
palpitations and variations in potassium channel genes.
RESULTS: After controlling for functional status and the occurrence of back 
pain, significant associations were found between the occurrence of palpitations 
and six SNPs among five candidate genes, including potassium voltage-gated 
channels (ie, potassium voltage gated channel modifier subfamily S member 1 
(KCNS1) rs4499491), potassium inwardly rectifying channels (ie, potassium 
inwardly rectifying channel subfamily J member 3 (KCNJ3) rs717175, KCNJ 
subfamily J member 5 (KCNJ5) rs11221510, KCNJ subfamily J member 6 (KCNJ6) 
rs13049947 and KCNJ6 rs1399596), and potassium two pore domain channels (ie, 
potassium two pore domain channel subfamily K member 2 (KCNK2) rs12757222).
CONCLUSIONS: Variations in potassium channel genes are associated with the 
occurrence of palpitations in women prior to breast cancer surgery.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: While direct clinical implications cannot be 
made, these findings provide preliminary evidence of potential therapeutic 
targets.

OBJECTIVES: With the escalating global burden of cancer, there is an increasing 
imperative to adopt holistic, person-centered approaches that address the 
complex and evolving care needs of individuals across the cancer continuum. 
Integrating advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) into 
conventional cancer care models offers significant potential to enhance the 
responsiveness, inclusivity, and sustainability of cancer care delivery. This 
paper aimed to explore how the Caring Life Course Theory (CLCT), a comprehensive 
multidisciplinary framework of care, can inform and enhance the integration of 
AI into cancer care delivery.
METHODS: A conceptual synthesis and narrative synthesis were employed to explore 
and understand how CLCT constructs can inform AI applications across different 
levels of cancer care (individual, relational/network and structural).
RESULTS: AI technologies are being used to support personalized care planning, 
real-time symptom monitoring, survivorship management, and coordinated service 
delivery. Guided by the CLCT, these technologies offer a structured and 
contextually grounded approach to delivering longitudinal, life-course-informed 
care. Nonetheless, significant challenges remain, including ethical concerns, 
algorithmic bias, and implementation barriers.
CONCLUSIONS: Aligning AI technologies with the CLCT framework can promote more 
personalized, equitable, and relationally responsive cancer care. Future 
research must prioritize ethical co-design, accountability, and sustained 
implementation.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The integration of CLCT and AI can support 
nurses in identifying care needs, facilitating remote monitoring, and 
coordinating personalized care. However, the integration of AI must be 
approached with critical attention to ethics, equity, and the preservation of 
fundamental nursing values.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our aim was to investigate the potential of using 
MRI-based habitat features for predicting progression-free survival (PFS) in 
patients with lung cancer brain metastasis (LCBM) receiving radiotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and forty-six lesions from 68 patients with 
LCBM receiving radiotherapy were retrospectively reviewed and divided into 
training, random test (R-test), and time-independent test (TI-test) cohorts. 
Conventional radiomics and habitat features were extracted from the whole-tumor 
area and tumor subregions, respectively. Different machine learning risk models 
for predicting PFS were developed on the basis of clinical, radiomics, and 
habitat features, and their combination (clinical + habitat), respectively. The 
performance of the risk models was evaluated using the concordance index 
(C-Index) and Brier scores. The Kaplan-Meier curve was used to assess the 
prognostic value of the models.
RESULTS: The habitat risk model achieved the best prediction ability among 4 
different risk models in the TI-test cohort (C-Index: 0.716; 95% CI, 
0.548-0.890). Additionally, the habitat and radiomics risk models outperformed 
the clinical risk model in the training (C-Index: 0.721-0.762 versus 0.697) and 
TI-test cohorts (C-Index: 0.630-0.716 versus 0.377).
CONCLUSIONS: A habitat risk model based on intratumoral heterogeneity could be a 
reliable biomarker for predicting PFS in patients with LCBM receiving 
radiotherapy.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT has become a common staging 
modality for newly diagnosed high-risk and unfavorable intermediate-risk 
prostate cancer after showing improved sensitivity and specificity compared with 
conventional imaging in clinical trials. We aimed to assess the causal impact of 
PSMA PET staging on initial treatment selection in real-world practice. Methods: 
We used observational data from the U.S. Veterans Health Administration to 
emulate a randomized controlled trial in which patients with newly diagnosed, 
unfavorable intermediate-, high-, and very-high-risk prostate cancer from 
January 2022 to December 2023 would have been randomized to undergo either 
upfront 18F- or 68Ga-PSMA PET staging or conventional imaging (99mTc bone scan 
and pelvic CT or MRI). Outcomes of interest included use of frontline androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT), second-generation androgen receptor pathway 
inhibitors (ARPIs), radiotherapy, and radical prostatectomy. Weighted 
univariable Cox regression was performed to assess the effect of treatment group 
on each outcome, and 95% CIs were generated from 1,000 bootstrap replicates. 
Results: In total, 9,049 patients met the criteria for inclusion. PSMA PET 
staging was associated with higher rates of any ADT use relative to conventional 
staging (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.26; 95% CI, 1.19-1.44), higher rates of 
ARPI use (aHR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.33-1.78), lower rates of prostatectomy (aHR, 
0.69; 95% CI, 0.56-0.83), and no significant effect on the use of radiotherapy 
(aHR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.99-1.25). Compared with patients with PSMA stage N0M0, 
ARPI use was more common in patients with PSMA stage N1M0 (aHR, 6.87; 95% CI, 
5.41-8.73) and PSMA stage M1 (aHR, 10.13; 95% CI, 8.16-1.2.58). Patients with 
PSMA N1M0 disease were much less likely to undergo prostatectomy compared with 
PSMA N0M0. Conclusion: PSMA PET staging may be leading to fewer prostatectomies 
and higher use rates of ADT and ARPIs in the Veterans Health Administration.

Objectives: One of the major limitations of the current diagnostic techniques 
for upper urinary tract carcinoma (UTUC) is the risk of both understaging and 
overstaging, highlighting the need for real-time, high-resolution intraoperative 
imaging. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy and safety of ureteral optical 
coherence tomography (OCT) under ureterorenoscopy for T staging of UTUC. 
Materials and Methods: In this study, patients with suspected UTUC were 
prospectively enrolled. The safety analysis set included 16 patients who 
underwent ureteral OCT for ureteral tumors. Because two (13%) patients underwent 
ureterorenoscopic ablation therapy, the diagnostic accuracy analysis set 
included 14 of 16 patients who had both ureteral OCT data and a final 
pathological T (pT) stage from surgical specimens. The concordance, 
underdiagnosis, and overdiagnosis rates were compared between radiographical 
imaging-based T (cT) and OCT-based T (octT) diagnoses. The primary outcome was 
the diagnostic accuracy of ureteral OCT in discriminating between pTis/Ta/T1 
(non-muscle-invasive UTUC) and T2/T3 (muscle-invasive UTUC) cancers. Results: 
Concordance between cT-based and pT-based diagnoses was observed in 11 (79%) of 
the 14 patients, whereas a higher concordance rate (13/14, 93%) was noted for 
octT diagnosis. Additionally, the underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis rates of octT 
were 0% and 7.1%, respectively, which were lower than those of cT (7.1% and 14%, 
respectively). Although no intraprocedural urinary injury was observed, 
postprocedural complications included hematuria in five patients (31%), urinary 
tract pain in two (13%), and urinary tract infection in one patient (6.3%). 
Conclusion: Ureteral OCT exhibited a high diagnostic performance in 
discriminating between non-muscle-invasive UTUC and muscle-invasive UTUC with a 
safety profile. Further prospective trials with large sample sizes are necessary 
to determine the true diagnostic value and the wide use of ureteral OCT.

Cardiotoxicity is a significant adverse effect of chemotherapy, particularly in 
breast cancer survivors, especially those undergoing aggressive treatment 
regimens or with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. This presents a major 
challenge for cardio-oncologists, who must balance the effective treatment of 
cancer with minimizing the risk of cardiovascular damage. Addressing this 
challenge requires a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which 
chemotherapy agents induce cardiotoxicity, as well as the development of 
reliable methods for early detection and the identification of effective 
cardioprotective strategies. Preclinical animal models have served as 
indispensable tools for elucidating underlying mechanisms and assessing the 
efficacy of potential cardioprotective strategies. This review aims to explore 
the key signaling pathways implicated in this process, focusing on mechanisms 
such as oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species generation, inflammatory 
pathways, cellular damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction. It also discusses 
advancements in detection techniques and cardioprotective strategies that have 
shown great promise in preserving cardiac function during cancer treatment 
without diminishing the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Ultimately, this review 
emphasizes the need to integrate cardiotoxicity management into breast cancer 
treatment protocols to enhance patient survival and quality of life.

Chromosomal deletion of tumor suppressor genes often occurs in an imprecise 
manner, leading to co-deletion of neighboring genes. This collateral damage can 
create novel dependencies specific to the co-deleted context. One notable 
example is the dependency on PRMT5 activity in tumors with MTAP deletion, which 
co-occurs with CDKN2A/B loss, leading to the development of MTA-cooperative 
PRMT5 inhibitors. To identify additional collateral damage context/target pairs 
for chromosome 9p and other common loci of chromosomal deletions, we conducted a 
combinatorial CRISPR screen knocking out frequently co-deleted genes in 
combination with a focused target library. We identified the gene encoding the 
ribosome rescue factor PELO as synthetic lethal with the SKI complex interacting 
exonuclease FOCAD, which is frequently co-deleted alongside MTAP and CDKN2A/B on 
chromosome 9p. A genome-wide screen in FOCAD isogenic cells further identified 
the ribosome rescue GTPase and PELO binding partner HBS1L as the top synthetic 
lethal target for FOCAD loss. Analysis of publicly available data and genetic 
manipulation of HBS1L using orthogonal modalities validated this interaction. 
HBS1L dependency in FOCAD-deleted cells was rescued by FOCAD re-expression, and 
FOCAD intact cells could be rendered HBS1L-dependent by FOCAD knockout, 
demonstrating the context specificity of this interaction. Mechanistically, 
HBS1L loss led to translational arrest and activated the unfolded protein 
response in FOCAD-deleted cells. In vivo, HBS1L deletion eliminated growth of 
FOCAD-deleted tumors. Here we propose a model where the FOCAD/SKI complex and 
HBS1L/PELO work together to resolve aberrant mRNA-induced ribosomal stalling, 
making the HBS1L/PELO complex an intriguing novel target for treating 
FOCAD-deleted tumors.

This review focuses on antimicrobials (azithromycin, clarithromycin, clioquinol, 
chloroquine, doxycycline, erythromycin, ivermectin, and tigecycline), 
disulfiram, and metformin. It aims to highlight key knowledge gaps and the role 
of RNA sequencing in the translational repurposing of these agents for cancer 
therapy. Among the selected repurposed candidates, metformin is distinguished by 
an abundance of preclinical and clinical studies. Its anticancer activity is 
partly attributed to the induction of multiple regulated cell death pathways, 
including apoptosis, pyroptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis, alongside 
transcriptomic changes identified by bulk RNA sequencing across different cancer 
types. Clinical translation has thus far yielded mixed results, with drug-drug 
interactions, subtherapeutic concentrations, resistance mechanisms, and 
components of the tumour microenvironment representing key challenges to be 
addressed. In future, transcriptomics-guided drug repurposing, which enables 
patient stratification, together with the strategic use of repurposed agents 
informed by predictive biomarkers, may improve clinical outcomes. Bulk RNA 
sequencing provides a cost-effective means to assess drug-induced global gene 
expression changes, whilst single-cell and spatial transcriptomics offer finer 
resolution by capturing cell-type-specific responses and stromal influences, 
thereby enhancing precision in therapeutic targeting.

BACKGROUND: The United Kingdom's (UK) diverse geography means many people live 
in rural and coastal areas, where cancer outcomes are often poorer than in urban 
settings. Devolution means that the four nations of the UK have distinct 
approaches to cancer care. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have recently 
published national cancer strategies, while England's new plan is expected later 
in 2025. This study examined UK cancer policy documents, to identify, how, and 
to what extent, rural or coastal issues were considered.
METHODS: UK cancer policy documents from 2000 to 2024 were sourced via The 
International Cancer Control Partnership (ICCP) website 
(https://iccp-portal.org/), UK government sites and Google. Documents were 
searched for rural and coastal related terms.
RESULTS: Fifty-five documents were included (England n = 17; Northern Ireland 
n = 10; Scotland n = 21; Wales n = 7). No recent policies included a specific 
section or explicit recommendations for rural or coastal cancer care. Across the 
policies, contextual analysis highlighted that terms to promote rural or coastal 
equity rarely appeared within recommendations. Northern Ireland gave more 
attention to rural issues than other nations, as evidenced by a rural needs 
impact assessment and supporting documents to inform Northern Ireland's Cancer 
Strategy 2022-2032.
CONCLUSION: Despite sizeable rural and coastal populations facing specific 
health challenges across the UK, national cancer policies excepting Northern 
Ireland gave minimal guidance for delivering cancer care tailored to these 
communities. Other UK nations should consider adopting more rural-centric 
approaches like Northern Ireland.
POLICY SUMMARY: Coastal and rural health issues have received policy attention 
via the Chief Medical Officer for England's annual reports (2021; 2023) and more 
recently in the UK Government's 10 Year Health Plan for England (July 2025). 
However, when it comes to high-level cancer policy across the UK, the needs of 
rural and coastal people with cancer are not being adequately or specifically 
recognised.

PURPOSE: This prospective, non-randomized phase II single-arm pilot trial aimed 
to explore favorable mid-treatment nodal response (FMNR) through CT imaging to 
guide de-escalated chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in patients with favorable risk, 
node-positive HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer (OPC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients included p16+ OPC (AJCC 8th: cT1-3 N1 
M0, <10 pack-year smokers). All patients were initially planned to receive 70 Gy 
with concurrent weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2. At week 4, CT imaging evaluated nodal 
response: ≥40% reduction warranted de-escalation to 60 Gy, while <40% reduction 
continued standard CRT. Primary endpoint was 2-year PFS from initiation of dose 
de-escalated CRT. Tissue tumor modified viral (TTMV) HPV DNA samples and DW-MRI 
were collected at baseline and week 4. MDADI questionnaires were collected at 
baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.
RESULTS: Of 39 patients, 26 had FMNR and underwent de-escalated treatment. 13 
pts had slow mid-treatment nodal shrinkage and received standard dose. At a 
median follow-up of 47.4 months, the 2-year PFS was 92.1% (95% CI: 0.72-0.98) 
for the deescalated dose group and 92.3% for the standard dose patients (95% CI: 
0.57-0.99), p=0.96. With a median survival follow up of 48.9 months (range: 
16.7-77.8 months), there were no deaths or distant failures. FMNR was associated 
with rapid TTMV HPV DNA clearance, reduced TTMV HPV DNA flare, lower baseline 
and week 4 MRI diffusivity, and higher baseline and week 4 MRI diffusional 
kurtosis. No differences in acute or late maximum grade 3-4 toxicity by patient 
were noted. MDADI composite scores showed minimal clinical important difference 
(MCID) in the de-escalated group at 1-month post-treatment while the standard 
group had MCID up to 1-year post-treatment. No patients required feeding tube 
placement.
CONCLUSIONS: De-escalated CRT using CT-based mid-treatment nodal response in 
favorable risk, node-positive HPV-associated OPC achieved excellent 2-year PFS 
and OS rates and represents a potential approach in better selecting patients 
for treatment de-escalation.

BACKGROUND: Simultaneous integrated dose reduction (SDR) radiotherapy (SDR-RT) 
with a definitive dose to the gross tumor volume (GTV) and a relatively lower 
dose to the clinical target volume (CTV) might be beneficial in improving normal 
tissue sparing with low toxicity. This randomized controlled trial (SDR-RT 
trial) compared the efficacies of SDR-RT and conventional fractionated 
radiotherapy (CF-RT) for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC).
METHODS: ELIGIBLE PATIENTS WITH LS-SCLC WERE 1: 1 randomized to receive CF-RT 
(60 Gy in 30 once-daily fractions over 6 weeks for both CTV and GTV) or SDR-RT 
(50 Gy for CTV and 60 Gy for GTV in 28 once-daily fractions over 5.5 weeks) 
along with 4-6 cycles of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free 
survival (PFS) rate in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, whereas the 
secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) rate and adverse event incidence.
RESULTS: Between February 2017 and March 2023, 336 patients randomly received 
either SDR-RT (n = 165) or CF-RT (n = 171). Over a median follow-up of 56 
months, the 2- and 5-year PFS rates in the ITT analysis were respectively 42.0% 
and 31.9% with SDR-RT, and 40.7% and 30.5% with CF-RT (P = 0.015 for 
noninferiority). The between-group differences in OS, locoregional PFS, and 
locoregional recurrence rates were nonsignificant. Compared with CF-RT, SDR-RT 
was associated with lower median values of V20 (21.0% vs. 22.8%) and Dmean (12.1 
vs. 13.4 Gy) of the bilateral lungs (both P < 0.001). Acute grade ≥3 toxicities 
and radiation pneumonitis incidence were lower with SDR-RT than that with CF-RT 
(54.5% vs. 66.9%, P = 0.020; 2.4% vs. 7.7%, P = 0.027).
CONCLUSION: Compared with CF-RT, SDR-RT led to similar survival and less acute 
adverse events. SDR-RT may be considered as a more protective approach for 
LS-SCLC treatment.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Fagonia cretica L. is a traditionally used 
medicinal plant in many cultures for the management of cancer and other 
ailments. However, systematic scientific evaluation of its anticancer efficacy 
and mechanisms remains limited.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the antiproliferative effects and underlying 
molecular mechanisms of an ethanolic extract of Fagonia cretica against 
colorectal (HCT-116) and prostate (PC3) cancer cell lines.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxic potential of F. cretica ethanolic extract 
was assessed by in vitro cell viability assays. Bioinformatics analyses and 
experimental validation were used to identify molecular targets and cellular 
pathways affected by the extract.
RESULTS: The F. cretica extract exhibited potent antiproliferative activity in 
both colorectal and prostate cancer cell lines. Integrated in silico and 
experimental studies identified DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) as a principal 
molecular target of the plant's phytoconstituents. Treatment with the extract 
led to significant downregulation of DNMT1 at both protein and mRNA levels, 
accompanied by promotion of apoptosis and induction of oxidative stress. 
Furthermore, a marked upregulation of the tumor suppressor gene ER-β was 
observed following extract exposure. These dual actions, suppression of DNMT1 
and activation of ER-β, appear central to the mechanism underlying the 
anticancer effects of F. cretica.
CONCLUSION: Our study provides scientific validation for the ethnomedicinal use 
of Fagonia cretica as an anticancer agent. By targeting both epigenetic and 
apoptotic pathways, this plant extract offers promise as a natural therapeutic 
candidate for colorectal and prostate cancer management. Further studies are 
warranted to isolate active constituents and evaluate efficacy in vivo.

CONTEXT: Even as health care institutions seek to promote culturally attuned 
care, clinicians may struggle when cultural norms and practices contradict 
established clinical practices.
OBJECTIVES: To explore sources of moral distress among clinicians treating the 
growing population of South Asian breast cancer survivors.
METHODS: We report secondary analyses from a mixed methods study that aimed to 
understand the barriers and facilitators to providing culturally attuned care to 
South Asian breast cancer survivors. We conducted 30-minute virtual 
semi-structured interviews with multidisciplinary clinicians involved in cancer 
care. Interviews were guided by the Consolidated Framework of Implementation 
Research (CFIR). For this study, we used a thematic analysis approach to examine 
the sources of moral distress, and potential solutions to address it.
RESULTS: 14 clinicians (8 physicians; 41.6±9.8 years; 9 women; 4 South Asian) 
were interviewed. We identified the following themes: 1) Clinicians experienced 
moral distress when South Asian cultural norms conflicted with pillars of 
biomedical ethics; 2) Moral distress was exacerbated by individual and 
system-level barriers; and, 3) Solutions may necessitate change across 
individual, inner setting (e.g., clinics), and outer setting (e.g., health care 
systems) domains of CFIR.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians may experience moral distress when their evidence-based 
and ethical care approaches conflict with cultural norms. Health care systems 
should provide programs that support clinicians who encounter these dilemmas to 
ensure high quality clinical care that respects the cultural norms of South 
Asian breast cancer survivors.

The precise structure of glycosaminoglycans is critical for their bioactivity 
and the development of glyco-pharmaceuticals. Herein, cellular and animal 
experiments were conducted to assess the differences in the activities of 
heparin (HP) and heparan sulfate (HS) against liver cancer and drug-induced 
liver injury (DILI). Label-free quantitative proteomics, bioinformatics, 
biolayer interferometry (BLI), and immunohistochemical analyses were used to 
determine key proteins with differential expression. As a result, HP 
demonstrated superior anti-liver cancer activity compared with HS, whereas HS 
exhibited strong potential in resisting acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver 
injury. DIRAS family GTPase 2 (DIRAS2) was identified as a key HS-binding 
protein that was strongly associated with cell proliferation, and its expression 
levels in cells and tissues showed opposite trends following HP and HS 
administration. HP significantly reduced the abundance of DIRAS2 in the tumor 
tissue, thereby inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, whereas HS promoted 
proliferation by increasing DIRAS2 expression. Cluster sequencing revealed that 
consecutive GlcNS6S-IdoA2S domains in HP and IdoA2S-GlcNS6S, GlcA-GlcNS6S, and 
IdoA-GlcNAc domains in HS were required for affinity binding within the 
decasaccharide region. Molecular docking suggested that differences in the 
binding modes of HP and HS chains to DIRAS2 underlie their functional diversity. 
These findings indicate that HP and HS oligosaccharides with well-defined 
structures may serve as potential therapeutic agents for liver-related diseases.

BACKGROUND: The role of specific gut microbial strains in colorectal cancer 
(CRC) remains incompletely understood. Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis 
(ETBF), particularly its toxin gene (bft) isotypes, has been linked to CRC, but 
strain-specific contributions need further elucidation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this case-control study, stool samples from 60 CRC 
patients and 60 matched healthy controls were collected at Shahid Beheshti 
Hospital, Hamadan, Iran (2023-2024). B. fragilis isolates were cultured and 
confirmed via 16S rRNA PCR. The presence of bft, fpn, nanH, and leuB genes was 
assessed using multiplex and conventional PCR. Gene expression was quantified by 
qRT-PCR, and genetic diversity analyzed with REP-PCR.
RESULTS: ETBF carriage (any bft) was significantly higher in CRC patients 
compared to controls (85.0% vs. 66.7%; p=0.036, OR=2.78). The bft-2 isotype was 
notably enriched in CRC cases (55.8% vs. 16.7%; p<0.001, OR=6.27), whereas bft-1 
predominated in controls. Multiple bft alleles including rare bft-3 (always 
co-occurring with bft-2 in metastatic cases) were mainly found in advanced 
tumors. Accessory virulence genes fpn (31.4% vs. 17.5%; p=0.048) and nanH (56.7% 
vs. 26.7%; p=0.002) were also more prevalent in CRC isolates. Transcription 
levels of bft, fpn, and nanH increased 3.2- to 5.1-fold in CRC strains, 
correlating with tumor stage. No significant differences were seen for leuB. 
Tumor anatomical location did not affect gene prevalence or expression.
CONCLUSIONS: bft-2-positive B. fragilis strains are significantly associated 
with CRC, highlighting bft-2 as a promising biomarker candidate. Longitudinal 
and mechanistic studies are warranted to confirm its diagnostic and prognostic 
utility.

Lung cancer is the primary driver of global cancer-attributed mortalities, often 
associated with poor prognosis. Nanoparticles offer improved drug delivery and 
reduced off-target side effects. This study explored a dual-delivery system 
using lactoferrin (Lf) functionalized bovine serum albumin nanoparticles (ANPs) 
co-loaded with tetrandrine (Tet), a natural anticancer agent, and 
tumor-suppressive miRNA-126. The optimized formulation (Lf-miRNA-126-Tet@ANPs) 
has a particle size of 131.9 ± 0.87 nm, low PdI (0.135), zeta potential of 
-14.2 ± 0.57 mV, and entrapment efficiency of 66.7 % and 68 % of Tet and 
miRNA-126, respectively. Tet was released in a controlled, pH-responsive manner 
from Lf-Tet@ANPs. In vitro studies on A549 cells revealed selective potent 
cytotoxicity (IC50 of 2.53 μg/mL), a 3.4-fold increase in cellular uptake, as 
well as higher anti-migratory effect (0.95 ± 0.18 % wound closure compared to 
13.10 ± 1.33 % for free Tet). Lf-miRNA-126-Tet@ANPs showed efficient in vivo 
antitumor effect against urethane-induced lung cancer model, demonstrating a 
significant improvement in Tet antiproliferative (mTOR), apoptotic (BCL-2), and 
antiangiogenic (STAT-3 and VEGF-A) effect, restoring tumor biomarkers to levels 
resembling negative groups. Histopathological findings further verify the 
superiority of Lf-miRNA-126-Tet@ANPs. These results highlight 
Lf-miRNA-126-Tet@ANPs as a promising nanoplatform for chemo-gene targeted 
delivery against lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: The long-term effects of individuals' cancer diagnosis and treatment 
may disrupt their partners' daily activities, employment, and financial 
stability, potentially impacting access to healthcare. This study aimed to 
examine the association of partner cancer history and access to care.
METHODS: Adults aged ≥50 years living with a partner who participated in the 
2010-2022 Health and Retirement Study were included in this cross-sectional 
study. Individuals were categorized as with or without a partner with a cancer 
history. Access to care was measured as: 1) having a usual source of care, 2) 
difficulties finding a provider, 3) inability to afford medical care, and 4) 
receipt of preventive services, including flu vaccination, cholesterol checks, 
and any breast, colorectal, or cervical cancer screenings within the past 2 
years. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to examine 
associations of partner cancer history and access to care, adjusted for age, 
sex, race and ethnicity, educational attainment, comorbidities, individual 
cancer history, and survey year.
RESULTS: Individuals whose partner had a cancer history had higher odds of 
reporting challenges in finding a general provider (odds ratio (OR): 1.30, 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 1.04-1.62) than individuals without partner cancer 
history. Partner cancer history was associated with a higher likelihood of 
receiving breast (1.34(1.07-1.68)) and colorectal (1.15(1.03-1.29)) cancer 
screenings among eligible populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Programs aimed at improving resources are needed for individuals 
with a partner diagnosed with cancer. Partner's cancer diagnosis may also 
enhance individuals' awareness and uptake of cancer screenings.

The Oxidative Balance Score (OBS), a composite measure of systemic oxidative 
stress, has demonstrated potential relevance in cancer outcomes. However, 
epidemiological evidence linking OBS to colorectal cancer (CRC) survival remains 
limited and methodologically heterogeneous. This study aims to explore the 
associations between OBS and survival outcomes among CRC patients. We included 
2799 patients from the Guangdong Colorectal Cancer Cohort study. Four OBSs were 
calculated based on distinct methodologies, and comparative analyses were 
conducted. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the 
associations between each OBS and overall survival (OS) and CRC-specific 
survival (CSS). Restricted cubic spline models assessed nonlinear associations. 
Stratified analyses examined effect modification by sex and tumor site. 
Additionally, weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression was applied to identify 
dominant antioxidants and pro-oxidants within each OBS. During a median 
follow-up of 60.33 months, 639 deaths were recorded, including 574 CRC-specific 
deaths. OBS-2 showed the best model fit and discriminatory ability. Patients 
with higher OBS-2 and OBS-3 scores had a significant prolonged CSS. 
Specifically, compared to the lowest quartile, the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
confidence interval (CIs) for the highest quartile were: OBS-2: HRQ4 vs. Q1, 
0.76; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.98; and OBS-3: HRQ4 vs. Q1, 0.76; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.96. 
OBS-1 and OBS-4 showed borderline inverse associations with CSS. For OS, only 
OBS-1 demonstrated a borderline inverse association. All associations appeared 
linear (all P-Nonlinear > 0.05). The inverse associations were more pronounced 
in rectal cancer patients. WQS regression identified selenium, n-3 
polyunsaturated fatty acids, and vitamin B12 as primary antioxidant 
contributors, whereas iron emerged as the predominant pro-oxidant. In 
conclusion, higher OBS-2 and OBS-3 scores were associated with improved CSS in 
CRC patients. These findings may help inform future recommendations for 
lifestyle-based interventions aimed at improving prognosis in this population.

Breast Swelling and Chest Wall Swelling as a Symptom Cluster Associated With 
Emotional Distress in Women with Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema.

Swartz A.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the emotional health of women with breast cancer-related 
lymphedema, focusing on the symptom cluster of breast swelling and chest wall 
swelling.
DESIGN: A descriptive correlational design was used for this secondary analysis.
SETTING: Patients were recruited from a breast cancer center in New York City.
PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 21 years and older were recruited after initial breast 
cancer treatment. A sample size of 568 participants participated in the original 
study. The secondary analysis included 57 participants with breast swelling and 
chest wall swelling.
METHODS: The Breast Cancer and Lymphedema Symptom Experience Index plus 
demographic information were collected. Four groups were created including the 
symptom cluster group of breast swelling and chest wall swelling for comparison. 
Parametric and nonparametric tests, such as descriptive statistics, chi-square, 
and Kruskal-Wallis H tests, were used to assess the data.
RESULTS: Results revealed a 10% prevalence of the symptom cluster among 
participants. The median score on the emotional distress subscale was 9 out of 
48. The emotional health of those with the symptom cluster showed a significant 
difference compared to those without the cluster.
CONCLUSION: These findings underscore the emotional distress burden associated 
with this symptom cluster, offering insights for the future development of 
targeted interventions and supportive care for affected individuals.

BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly prescribed medications 
that may influence the gut microbiome and impact the efficacy of immune 
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in cancer treatment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a large retrospective cohort study using the 
TriNetX database, encompassing >35,621 patients with cancer treated with ICIs 
between January 2015 and June 2021. Patients were stratified into 2 cohorts: 
those receiving ICIs with concurrent PPI use and those without PPI use.
RESULTS: Concomitant PPI use was associated with significantly higher mortality 
rates in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors across multiple cancer types, 
including melanoma (hazard ratio [HR], 1.889; 95% CI, 1.752-2.037); breast 
cancer (HR, 1.512; 95% CI, 1.345-1.701); urothelial carcinoma (HR, 1.406; 95% 
CI, 1.276-1.551); colorectal cancer (HR, 1.310; 95% CI, 1.187-1.445); 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HR, 1.413; 95% CI, 1.238-1.614); renal cancer (HR, 
1.490; 95% CI, 1.375-1.614); Hodgkin lymphoma (HR, 1.646; 95% CI, 1.212-2.236); 
head and neck cancers (HR, 1.402; 95% CI, 1.259-1.561); and lung cancer (HR, 
1.308; 95% CI, 1.184-1.445). Similar trends were observed with PD-L1 inhibitors, 
where PPI use correlated with increased mortality in melanoma (HR, 1.657; 95% 
CI, 1.049-2.617); breast cancer (HR, 1.584; 95% CI, 1.297-1.934); renal cancer 
(HR, 1.380; 95% CI, 1.059-1.799); and urothelial carcinoma. ICU admissions were 
more frequent among PPI users across different cancer types and ICI treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the potential risks associated with the 
concomitant use of PPIs and ICIs in cancer treatment. The findings suggest that 
careful consideration is necessary when prescribing PPIs to patients undergoing 
ICI therapy.

BACKGROUND: Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has been less extensively 
evaluated for surveillance after breast cancer treatment than for screening. We 
compared the performance of DBT and digital mammography (DM) for surveillance of 
asymptomatic women with a personal history of breast cancer (PHBC), using US 
clinical practice data adjusted for population differences.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 28,042 women with PHBC and 
posttreatment surveillance mammograms performed between 2012 and 2018 at 37 
facilities within the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. We calculated 
performance measures and absolute differences (ADs) for DBT versus DM, including 
cancer detection rate (CDR), invasive CDR, interval cancer rate, recall rate, 
and false-positive biopsy recommendation rate, sensitivity, specificity, and 
positive predictive value (PPV1), with 95% confidence intervals, adjusting for 
population characteristics using overlap weighting.
RESULTS: Among 80,077 mammograms (DBT, n=27,852; DM, n=52,225) and 1,098 
subsequent breast cancer diagnoses, DBT had a higher CDR (AD, 2.3 per 1,000 [95% 
CI, 0.3 to 4.3]), invasive CDR (AD, 2.9 per 1,000 [95% CI, 1.0 to 4.7]), and 
PPV1 (AD, 5.2% [95% CI, 2.5% to 7.8%)] and lower recall rate (AD, -1.0% [95% CI, 
-1.5% to -0.5%]) compared with DM. No significant differences overall were 
identified for interval cancer rate or other performance measures. 
Surveillance-detected cancers with DBT or DM had similar proportions of 
favorable prognostic characteristics (smaller size, node-negative, and estrogen 
receptor-positive).
CONCLUSIONS: For women with PHBC, DBT had better detection metrics compared with 
DM, as demonstrated by higher CDR, higher invasive CDR, and lower recall rate. 
However, the lack of significant reduction in interval cancer rate suggests that 
both DBT and DM may be used for posttreatment surveillance. Identifying 
effective imaging surveillance strategies for reducing interval cancer rates is 
needed to further improve posttreatment outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Thoracoscopic oesophagectomy, a minimally invasive treatment for 
oesophageal cancer, is used worldwide. However, no large-scale, multicentre, 
randomised controlled trial has compared long-term survival as the primary 
endpoint between thoracoscopic and open oesophagectomy. We aimed to confirm the 
non-inferiority in overall survival of thoracoscopic oesophagectomy over open 
oesophagectomy in patients with resectable thoracic oesophageal cancer.
METHODS: This multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3, 
non-inferiority trial was conducted at 31 hospitals across Japan. Patients aged 
20-80 years were eligible if they had histologically confirmed oesophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma, oesophageal adenosquamous carcinoma, or oesophageal 
basaloid squamous cell carcinoma, which was located in the thoracic oesophagus; 
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; clinical 
stage I, II, or III (but not T4) disease; and had not received previous 
treatment for oesophageal cancer, except for endoscopic resection of superficial 
lesions and preoperative chemotherapy (doublet or triplet) per Japanese 
guidelines. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a web-based system with 
adjustment factors by clinical stage (IA vs IB, II, or III), age (<76 years vs 
≥76 years), and institution, to right open transthoracic oesophagectomy or right 
thoracoscopic oesophagectomy, both with at least D2 lymphadenectomy. The primary 
endpoint was investigator-assessed overall survival, analysed in the 
intention-to-treat population. The non-inferiority margin was 9% for 3-year 
overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1·44). Two formal interim analyses of 
overall survival were planned: the first after half of the expected number of 
patients were enrolled and the second after patients had been accrued and 
protocol treatment completed. The trial would be terminated for efficacy if 
non-inferiority and superiority in overall survival was shown for thoracoscopic 
oesophagectomy in the first interim analysis and if non-inferiority in overall 
survival was shown in the second interim analysis. This trial was registered 
with UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, UMIN000017628 (follow-up ongoing).
FINDINGS: From May 20, 2015, to June 17, 2022, 300 patients were randomly 
assigned (150 to open oesophagectomy and 150 to thoracoscopic oesophagectomy). 
247 (82%) of 300 patients were male and 53 (18%) were female. The median age was 
68 years (IQR 64-72). 148 (99%) of 150 patients underwent open oesophagectomy, 
and all 150 patients underwent thoracoscopic oesophagectomy. In the first 
interim analysis at a median follow-up of 1·6 years (IQR 0·8-2·5), 
non-inferiority was not confirmed (HR 0·56 [99·99990046% CI 0·05-5·73]; 
one-sided pnon-inferiority=0·002326, greater than the prespecified 
non-inferiority threshold). At a median follow-up of 2·6 years (IQR 1·4-4·9) for 
the second interim analysis, 3-year overall survival was 82·0% (95% CI 
73·8-87·8) with thoracoscopic oesophagectomy and 70·9% (61·6-78·4) with open 
oesophagectomy (HR 0·64 [98·8% CI 0·34-1·21]), confirming non-inferiority 
(one-sided pnon-inferiority=0·000726, less than the prespecified non-inferiority 
threshold of 0·00616). The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee then recommended 
terminating the trial and publishing the results, and the trial was terminated 
in June 19, 2023. Intraoperative complications (grade ≥3) were similar between 
study groups (one [1%] of 150 in the thoracoscopic group vs two [1%] of 148 in 
the open group; all three events were intraoperative bleeding), as were 
postoperative complications before first discharge (grade ≥3; 63 [42%] vs 65 
[44%]). Grade 3 or higher pneumonia occurred in 12 (8%) patients in the 
thoracoscopic group and in 18 (12%) in the open group; grade 3 anastomotic 
leakage occurred in 17 (11%) patients in the thoracoscopic group and seven (5%) 
in the open group. Four treatment-related deaths occurred in the thoracoscopic 
group and two in the open group.
INTERPRETATION: Thoracoscopic oesophagectomy, a standard treatment in Japan, was 
non-inferior to open oesophagectomy for patients with resectable thoracic 
oesophageal cancer.

Hypersensitivity and Desensitization Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,

IntroductionPaclitaxel is associated with hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) in 
up to 40% of patients, primarily during the first two lifetime infusions. 
Standard premedication with diphenhydramine, dexamethasone, and famotidine as 
recommended by the prescribing information reduces this risk to approximately 
10%.1 In July 2023, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) replaced diphenhydramine 
with cetirizine to minimize sedation and prolonged antihistamine 
effects.MethodsThis retrospective, IRB-exempt study evaluated HSR rates with 
cetirizine premedication in adults receiving their first lifetime paclitaxel 
dose between January 1 and July 31, 2024, using a DFCI paclitaxel titration 
protocol. Eligible patients received cetirizine, famotidine, and dexamethasone 
as premedication. The primary endpoint was the HSR rate during the first 
infusion and was compared to an 8.1% historical HSR rate with diphenhydramine 
using Fisher's exact test.ResultsAmong 150 patients, the HSR rate with 
cetirizine was 8.7%, showing no significant difference in HSR rate with 
diphenhydramine (8.1%, P = 1.00). HSRs were generally milder in the cetirizine 
group, with less epinephrine use (7.7% vs. 66.7%). Paclitaxel re-challenge was 
successful in 77% of cetirizine-pretreated patients, and only two patients 
required allergy referral.ConclusionData from this study suggests paclitaxel HSR 
rates with cetirizine premedication are not significantly different from HSR 
rates with diphenhydramine.

PURPOSE: To examine the prevalence of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) in adults 
with p16-positive head and neck cancer after (chemo)radiation, with a particular 
focus on the influence of clinical and psychosocial factors on its severity.
METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted at three 
university cancer centers to assess FCR in adults with p16-positive oropharynx 
cancer or cancer of unknown primary in the head and neck undergoing 
(chemo)radiation between 2018 and 2024. FCR was measured using the short version 
of the Fear of Progression (FoP-Q-12) questionnaire and was compared to 
p16-negative head and neck cancer (oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx) 
survivors (n = 95).
RESULTS: Of 139 eligible patients, 118 were contacted, and 77 consented to 
participate. Median age at the start of radiotherapy was 61 years (IQR, 57-66), 
and most were male (n = 56, 73 %). Twenty-one patients (27 %) received 
definitive (chemo)radiation. Strong FCR (≥34 points) was reported by 16 patients 
(21 %). P16-positive head and neck cancer survivors reported less FCR than 
patients with p16-negative tumors (p < 0.0001). FCR was negatively correlated 
with global quality of life (r = -0.32, p < 0.01) and positively with distress 
(r = 0.37, p < 0.01), decision regret (r = 0.41, p < 0.001), depression 
(r = 0.58, p < 0.001) and anxiety (r = 0.72, p < 0.001). No associations were 
found between FCR and age, gender, performance status, smoking, T 
classification, N classification, type of treatment, and time between 
radiotherapy and questionnaire completion.
CONCLUSIONS: Strong FCR affected about one-fifth of p16-positive head and neck 
cancer survivors and was associated with lower quality of life as well as higher 
distress, depression, and anxiety.

The chirality of drugs profoundly influences their efficacy, safety, and 
biological functions, particularly in single-enantiomer structures. Toll-like 
receptor 7 (TLR7) activation represents a promising tumor immunotherapy strategy 
by bridging innate and adaptive immunity. Herein, we design a chiral TLR7 
agonist SMU-L11-R based on an imidazoquinoline scaffold. Compared to its 
enantiomer, it exhibits nearly 10-fold enhanced excitatory activity in HEK Blue 
hTLR7 cells (EC₅₀ = 0.012 ± 0.003 μM). Mechanistic studies reveal SMU-L11-R 
specifically activates TLR7, recruits MyD88, and triggers MAPK/NF-κB pathways, 
eliciting TNF-α/IL-1β/IL-6 secretion in both mouse and human peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells. The macrophage polarization experiments revealed SMU-L11-R 
remarkably upregulated the M1-like macrophage, accounting for 61.1 %, compared 
to 26.3 % in the control group. In the MC38 mouse model, SMU-L11-R can 
significantly inhibit tumor growth and exhibit excellent synergistic anti-tumor 
effects with PD-L1 inhibitors by upregulating CD8+T cells. Taken together, the 
optical isomer SMU-L11-R exhibits a superior TLR7 activation effect compared to 
its enantiomer, and demonstrates excellent tumor immune efficacy as a single 
drug or in combination with PD-L1 inhibitors.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) exhibits profound resistance to immune 
checkpoint blockade, driven by a dense stroma, low immunogenicity, and an 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM 
domain (TIGIT) is an inhibitory receptor expressed on tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes and contributes to immune dysfunction in PDAC through its 
interaction with PVR. To selectively modulate the TIGIT axis within the tumor 
microenvironment, we developed a bispecific antibody (chi2B5×4F11) that targets 
TIGIT while anchoring to CUB domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1), thereby 
enabling spatially confined immune activation in CDCP1-positive tumor niches. 
Functional characterization using in vitro NK-92 cell assays and in vivo studies 
using a humanized mouse model engrafted with CDCP1+ PANC-1 cells demonstrated 
the efficacy of these antibodies. Parental chi4F11 effectively blocked the 
TIGIT-PVR axis, restoring AKT-FOXO1 signaling without altering CD226 expression. 
Chi2B5×4F11 further enhanced NK-92 cell-mediated cytotoxicity and induced the 
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro. In vivo, treatment with 
chi2B5×4F11 reduced the proportion of TIGIT+ circulating immune subsets within 
the CD226+ compartment, suggesting functional restoration of co-stimulatory 
signaling. These findings highlight TIGIT as a crucial therapeutic target and 
suggest a strategy to overcome the immune resistance of pancreatic cancer.

The ten-eleven translocation (TET) dioxygenases TET1, TET2, and TET3 are more 
firmly established today as central controllers of cancer epigenetics, in 
addition to their traditional function in DNA demethylation. Previously viewed 
only in the context of neoplasms of hematologic origin, the most recent evidence 
shows that they have a broad-ranging effect in solid tumors, where they connect 
oncogenic signaling, tumor-immune interactions, and therapeutic resistance. By 
remodulating immune cell lineage commitment, cytokine networks, and immune 
checkpoint pathways, TET enzymes act as rheostats at the interface of tumor 
epigenetics and immunity. Through context-dependent functions, they enhance 
immune responsiveness to immunotherapy or reinforce immune evasion and drug 
resistance. In this review article, we integrate critical studies on 
TET-mediated regulation in solid tumors, highlighting their tumor-suppressive 
and oncogenic roles, their effects on immunotherapy response, and their 
functions as biomarkers and therapy targets. Characterizing these 
multifunctional roles provides an entry point for precision epigenetic therapy 
to potentially improve immunotherapy and bypass cancer therapy resistance.

Gastric cancer (GC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, 
with advanced stages often showing limited therapeutic response and frequent 
drug resistance. Growing evidence underscores glucose metabolism reprogramming 
as a pivotal mechanism promoting tumor progression, immune evasion, and 
treatment resistance in GC. However, the mechanistic details and clinical 
relevance of metabolic rewiring in GC remain insufficiently elucidated. This 
review comprehensively analyzes recent advances in glucose metabolic 
reprogramming in GC, covering key enzymes, transporters, non-coding RNAs, and 
metabolites involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate 
pathway, and glucose uptake. By synthesizing current evidence, we highlight 
clinically relevant mechanisms such as lactate-mediated immunosuppression-via 
polarization of Tregs and M2 macrophages-and metabolic adaptations that drive 
chemotherapy resistance. Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for targeting 
glucose metabolism to overcome drug resistance, suppress metastasis, and enhance 
immunotherapy efficacy in GC. Thus, targeting metabolic reprogramming represents 
a promising strategy for developing personalised therapies and improving 
outcomes in GC patients. Further translational and clinical studies are urgently 
needed to validate these metabolic pathways as therapeutic targets.

PURPOSE: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common and 
debilitating side effect among breast cancer patients, leading to impaired 
functional capacity and diminished quality of life. Although non-pharmacological 
methods such as local heat and cold applications are gaining attention, their 
comparative efficacy has not been sufficiently explored. This study aimed to 
examine the effectiveness of local heat and cold applications on CIPN symptoms 
in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included 96 breast cancer patients who 
developed CIPN during taxane-based chemotherapy. Participants were randomly 
assigned to heat application, cold application, or control groups. Interventions 
were administered following a standardized protocol throughout chemotherapy 
cycles. CIPN symptoms were assessed using a validated neuropathy evaluation tool 
before and after the intervention period.
RESULTS: The heat application group exhibited significant reductions in 
neuropathic symptoms, including toe numbness, finger discomfort, cold 
sensitivity, and difficulty with physical activity (p < 0.05). The cold 
application group showed moderate improvements in select sensory symptoms, 
though effects were less pronounced than in the heat group. Symptom severity 
increased over time in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Local heat application appears to be an effective non-pharmacologic 
approach for mitigating CIPN symptoms. Cold application provided limited symptom 
relief and may be useful in selected cases.

Maximal safe surgical resection remains the cornerstone of glioma treatment, yet 
the infiltrative nature of this most common malignant brain tumor poses major 
challenges in accurately delineating tumor margins while preserving adjacent 
functional tissues. Addressing this limitation requires the identification of 
reliable invasion biomarkers and the development of highly specific materials to 
enable complete resection of diffuse glioma. This review explores the 
infiltrative growth patterns of glioma and classifies margin-associated 
biomarkers into three major categorizes: molecular, cellular and structural 
abnormities. Particular emphasis is placed on molecular and functional 
biomarkers, which often manifest earlier and more faithfully reflect cancer cell 
distribution than structural markers. We also highlight recent advancements in 
engineering materials and probes capable of detecting these abnormalities beyond 
the reach of conventional diagnostic tools, thereby enhancing intraoperative 
precision. Finally, we outline future perspectives for refining biomarker 
discovery and probe design to facilitate maximal safe resection. By advancing 
next-generation technologies for delineating diffuse glioma margins, these 
efforts hold promise for improving surgical outcomes and patient survival.

BACKGROUND: Overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and 
progression-free survival (PFS) are traditionally used as surrogates for overall 
survival (OS). However, their validity as reliable predictors of OS in 
small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains unclear.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov were 
systematically searched between 2014 and 2024. Study selection followed PRISMA 
guidelines. Data on ORR, DCR, PFS, and OS were manually extracted from phase III 
randomized trials. Weighted linear regression and Pearson correlation analyses, 
with logarithmic transformation of odds ratios and hazard ratios, were used to 
assess associations between endpoints. Correlation coefficients were computed to 
evaluate the correlation between surrogate endpoints and OS. All tests were 
two-sided, with statistical significance set at P < 0.05.
RESULTS: The analysis comprised 23 randomized phase III trials, including 10 340 
patients. In first-line studies, a strong correlation was observed between PFS 
and OS (r = 0.77, P < 0.001). In first-line immunotherapy studies, PFS also 
correlated significantly with OS (r = 0.80, P = 0.006). In contrast, ORR and DCR 
did not correlate with OS in either first- or second-line settings. In the 
second-line setting, DCR correlated with PFS (r = -0.84, P = 0.01) but not with 
OS. These findings were consistent across both the difference model and the odds 
ratio model.
CONCLUSIONS: PFS demonstrates strong clinical value as a surrogate endpoint for 
OS in the first-line SCLC setting, including with chemoimmunotherapy, and may 
serve as a reliable endpoint for future phase III trials. In contrast, ORR and 
DCR do not reliably predict long-term outcomes, underscoring the need to 
prioritize PFS over these measures in trial design and interpretation.

BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is an effective therapy for patients 
with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive/low advanced 
breast cancer (ABC), but it is associated with a specific toxicity profile, 
particularly interstitial lung disease (ILD).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study 
to evaluate safety and efficacy profiles of T-DXd in patients with 
HER2-positive/low ABC treated at the European Institute of Oncology from 
December 2019 to April 2025. Endpoints included: cumulative incidence of ILD, 
grade ≥3 neutropenia in all patients, and real-world progression-free survival 
(rwPFS) by BC subtype. ILD was assessed across age, smoking status, lung 
metastases, subtype, prior immunotherapy, and prior chemotherapy lines. Grade ≥3 
neutropenia was assessed across age and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) at 
cycle 3 day 1 (C3D1).
RESULTS: A total of 112 patients were included, 43% (n = 48) with HER2-positive 
and 57% (n = 64) with HER2-low ABC. The median number of prior lines for ABC was 
3.0 [interquartile range (IQR) 2.0-5.0]. A prior antibody-drug conjugate line 
was administered in 58% (n = 28) and in 17% (n = 11) of patients with 
HER2-positive and HER2-low ABC, respectively. De novo ABC was diagnosed in 23% 
(n = 26) of patients. After a median follow-up of 9 months (IQR 5.1-21.7 
months), the 12-month cumulative incidence of ILD was 13% [95% confidence 
interval (CI) 7.2% to 20.6%] and two reported grade 5 cases (2%). At 
multivariable analysis, prior immunotherapy (hazard ratio 3.22, 95% CI 
1.06-9.72, P = 0.052) and smoking (HR 2.71, 95% CI 1.00-7.34, P = 0.062) were 
associated with a higher risk of ILD. Grade ≥3 neutropenia occurred in 10 
patients (9%), being associated with a low NLR at C3D1 (HR 0.10, 95% CI 
0.02-0.53, P < 0.001). rwPFS was 21.82 months (95% CI 17.98 months-not reached) 
and 6.90 months (95% CI 4.93-10.19 months) for HER2-positive and HER2-low ABC, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our real-world analysis confirms the safety and efficacy profiles of 
T-DXd in patients with ABC. Prior immunotherapy and smoking emerged as risk 
factors for ILD, and NLR for neutropenia grade ≥3, and merit further 
investigation.

BACKGROUND: While immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment 
of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), many patients still suffer from either 
primary or acquired treatment resistance. Stimulation of antitumor cellular 
immunity with a therapeutic cancer vaccine in combination with anti-programmed 
cell death (ligand) protein 1 [PD-(L)1] may improve outcome. PDC∗lung01 is a 
cancer vaccine made of irradiated plasmacytoid dendritic cells loaded with six 
NSCLC tumor antigens (NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A3, MAGE-A4, Multi-MAGE-A, MUC1, and 
Survivin), and available as a ready-to-use product.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter, phase I/II 
study assessed the safety profile, clinical activity, and immunogenicity of 
PDC∗lung01 at low or high doses, either as a single agent in resected NSCLC 
(cohorts A) or with anti-PD-1 in metastatic NSCLC with PD-L1 ≥ 50% (cohorts B). 
The primary objective was vaccine-related dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). 
Secondary objectives included safety profile, T-cell response against vaccine 
antigens in all cohorts, and clinical activity in cohort B2 (high-dose 
PDC∗lung01 with anti-PD-1): objective response rate (ORR) and 9-month 
progression-free survival (9mPFS).
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 20 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 14-26 
months] in all enrolled patients (N = 73). Most adverse events were mild to 
moderate; only one patient (2%) in cohort B2 reported a related DLT. In the 
combination of PDC∗lung01 (high-dose) with anti-PD-1 (N = 45), the confirmed ORR 
was 51% (80% CI 41% to 62%), the 9mPFS estimate was 47% (80% CI 37% to 57%), and 
the median PFS was 9 months (95% CI 5.0-24 months). PDC∗lung01 elicited tumor 
antigen-specific T-cell expansions in 50%-67% of patients and PFS duration 
correlated positively with immune response intensity (P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: PDC∗lung01 was immunogenic and had a manageable safety profile in 
all cohorts and met the predefined clinical objectives when combined with 
anti-PD-1 in metastatic NSCLC. Median PFS was positively correlated with 
antigen-specific T-cell expansions.

AIMS: Precision oncology, driven by next-generation sequencing (NGS), enables 
the use of matched targeted therapies (MTTs) tailored to tumour-specific genomic 
alterations. While benefits in early-stage cancer are well-established, the 
impact of MTTs in relapsed or metastatic settings remains unclear. This 
systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO ID: CRD42023471466) evaluates the 
efficacy and safety of NGS-guided MTTs in patients with advanced solid and 
haematological tumours.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE (to 30 October 
2024), reference lists, and conference proceedings identified randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NGS-guided MTTs (alone or combined with 
standard of care systemic treatment [SOC]) versus SOC alone in patients with 
advanced cancers that had progressed after at least one prior systemic therapy. 
Primary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), 
and grade ≥3 adverse events. Data extraction and bias assessment were conducted 
independently by two reviewers. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed using 
the DerSimonian-Laird method.
RESULTS: Thirty RCTs (7393 patients) were included that collectively enrolled 
patients with eight different cancer types. With a median follow-up ranging from 
12 months to 62.3 months, MTTs were associated with a 30-40% reduction in the 
risk of disease progression. No consistent OS benefit was observed with MTT 
monotherapy. However, combining MTTs with SOC resulted in improved OS, 
particularly in patients with prostate and urothelial cancer, but conferred PFS 
gain without OS improvement in those with breast and ovarian cancer. In terms of 
adverse events, we observed MTTs increased toxicity risk compared to SOC, 
specifically, in combination regimens. Most studies were at high risk of bias, 
with performance and detection bias being common limitations.
CONCLUSION: NGS-guided MTTs significantly enhance PFS, especially when combined 
with SOC, with OS benefits being more tumour-specific. Increased toxicity rates 
with MTTs underscore the need for careful in patient selection. Furthermore, 
genomic profiling should be routinely integrated into the management of patients 
with advanced or recurrent cancers.

This study investigates the postmortem tissue distribution of morphine, its main 
metabolites, and levetiracetam in a terminal cancer patient. A validated liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy method was developed and applied to 
blood and tissue samples collected during a forensic autopsy. Samples were 
processed using protein precipitation with acetonitrile and lipid removal 
cartridges. The analysis revealed peripheral blood concentrations of 0.220, 
1.19, and 16.6 μg/mL for morphine, 
morphine-3-glucuronide/morphine-6-glucuronide, and levetiracetam, respectively. 
The highest concentrations of each drug were found in the urine. The 
concentration of free morphine in the blood was elevated, but higher levels have 
been reported in terminal cancer patients undergoing long periods of pain 
management with morphine. Levetiracetam blood levels were in the therapeutic 
range. The results align with existing literature on morphine's postmortem 
redistribution and provide new insights into the tissue distribution of 
levetiracetam. These data can serve as a reference for future studies and 
contribute to the development of guidelines for the use of these medications in 
end-of-life care. The study concludes that while the drug concentrations were 
not high enough to solely attribute the cause of death to intoxication, the 
comprehensive tissue distribution analysis offers valuable information for 
forensic and clinical applications. To our knowledge, this is the first report 
to document the simultaneous analysis and tissue distribution of morphine and 
levetiracetam in postmortem samples.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly aggressive malignancy associated 
with a poor prognosis. Its clinical management is particularly challenging due 
to factors such as tumor metastasis and drug resistance, emphasizing the need 
for alternative therapeutic strategies. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has 
attracted growing interest as a potential cancer treatment owing to its 
distinctive advantages, including multi-target effects and a favorable safety 
profile. Jianpi Huayu decoction (JPHYD), a TCM formula developed by our team as 
an adjuvant therapy for hepatopancreatic malignancies, has demonstrated 
anti-tumor activity in preliminary studies. However, the precise mechanisms of 
action against PC remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the anti-tumor efficacy of JPHYD against PC and 
elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: The antitumor effects of JPHYD-containing serum (2.5 %, 5 %, and 10 %) 
on PANC-1 and SW1990 were evaluated using a series of in vitro assays, including 
CCK-8 cell viability, colony formation, EdU proliferation, wound healing, 
transwell invasion, apoptosis, and Western blot analyses. To investigate the 
underlying anticancer mechanisms, transcriptomics, untargeted metabolomics, 
overexpression plasmid transfection, RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, BODIPY 
staining, triglyceride (TG) quantification, and apoptosis and ferroptosis assays 
were conducted. Ferroptosis was assessed via Live/Dead staining, intracellular 
Fe²⁺, malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH) levels, C11-BODIPY staining, 
transmission electron microscopy, and Western blotting. In vivo, both 
subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft tumor models were established in BALB/C 
nude mice to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of JPHYD. Based on experimental 
design requirements, different doses of JPHYD were administered via intragastric 
gavage (low dose: 3.844 g/kg/d; medium dose: 7.689 g/kg/d; high dose: 15.378 
g/kg/d). To uncover active compounds, we employed a multi-level strategy that 
integrated UPLCHRMS analysis, in silico modeling (docking and dynamics 
simulations), and CETSA-based validation.
RESULTS: Consistent results from in vitro and in vivo models demonstrated that 
JPHYD effectively impaired pancreatic cancer progression without notable 
toxicity. Transcriptomic and untargeted metabolomic analyses indicated that 
JPHYD's anti-tumor effects may occur through stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) 
-mediated lipid metabolic remodeling. Specifically, JPHYD suppresses SCD1 
expression, reducing intracellular lipid accumulation and disrupting lipid 
homeostasis. Concurrently, this disruption enhances JPHYD-induced ferroptosis in 
PC cells, evidenced by accelerated GSH depletion, MDA accumulation, elevated 
intracellular Fe²⁺ levels, antioxidant system imbalance, and increased lipid 
peroxidation. The ferroptosis inhibitor (Ferrostatin-1, Fer-1) significantly 
reversed these effects. Mechanistic studies further revealed that overexpression 
of SCD1 restores lipid homeostasis in PC cells, substantially attenuating 
JPHYD-induced ferroptosis. Notably, Comprehensive screening identified 
dihydrotanshinone I (DHT) as a potential key active component of JPHYD 
responsible for SCD1 regulation. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics 
simulations, and CETSA experiments confirmed strong binding affinity between DHT 
and SCD1. In vitro, DHT treatment alone reduced PC cell viability, SCD1 protein 
expression, and intracellular lipid accumulation while significantly increasing 
lipid peroxidation and inducing ferroptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work demonstrates that JPHYD exerts potent antitumor activity 
in PC by modulating SCD1-mediated lipid remodeling and inducing ferroptosis. We 
further identified DHT, a natural bioactive compound, as a potential SCD1 
inhibitor. These results highlight the therapeutic promise of JPHYD and DHT and 
open new perspectives for developing effective strategies against PC.

BACKGROUND: Bone metastasis represents the primary cause of mortality and a 
major therapeutic challenge in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
Hu-gu-xiao-ji (HGXJ) formula has been proved to alleviate bone-metastatic pain 
in our previous study while its antitumor effect and mechanism remained unclear.
PURPOSE: This study is designed to explore the potential efficacy and underlying 
mechanisms of HGXJ formula against NSCLC with bone metastasis.
METHODS: Mouse xenografts and bone-metastatic models were applied to validate 
the inhibitory effect of HGXJ formula on primary and bone-metastatic NSCLC in 
vivo. Immunological experiments were conducted to assess the immune influence of 
tumor and bone microenvironment or peripheral circulation under the treatment 
with HGXJ formula monotherapy or in combination with immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (ICIs). Meanwhile, transcriptome sequencing, network pharmacology 
analysis, and molecular biological experiments were used to investigate the 
underlying mechanisms of HGXJ formula in modulating tumor progression and immune 
microenvironment.
RESULTS: HGXJ formula significantly suppressed the growth of primary NSCLC 
without observable toxicity and demonstrated efficacy against bone metastasis 
and its secondary dissemination, either alone or combined with ICIs. 
Furthermore, HGXJ formula reduced M2-type macrophages polarization and enhanced 
CD8+T cells infiltration to remodel tumor and bone microenvironment. Mechanism 
investigations further confirmed the dual function and muti-pathway modulation 
of HGXJ formula on directly inhibiting tumor via MAPK cascade and diminishing 
macrophages M2 polarization via STAT3/6 pathway, thus playing the antitumor role 
on bone-metastatic NSCLC.
CONCLUSION: These findings revealed the multifaceted therapeutic effects of HGXJ 
formula and provided mechanistic evidence supporting its potential as a 
candidate therapeutic option for NSCLC patients with bone metastasis.

BACKGROUND: Resistance to apatinib remains a major barrier to achieving 
favorable outcomes in patients with gastric cancer (GC). This study aimed to 
identify key molecular targets associated with apatinib resistance and to 
elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: By analyzing datasets related to anti-angiogenic therapies and 
treatment outcomes, we identified the hub gene associated with apatinib 
resistance. Its correlation with resistance was validated through gene 
manipulation in GC cells, alongside a series of in vitro and in vivo studies. 
Protein expression profiling was further performed to explore the underline 
mechanisms.
RESULTS: Our findings revealed a substantial association between IL-8 expression 
and resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy. Exogenous IL-8 treatment increased 
apatinib resistance in AGS cells. CXCR2 knockdown enhanced apatinib sensitivity 
while simultaneously inhibiting the migratory, invasive, and colony-forming 
capacities of AGS cells in vitro, as well as tumor growth and metastasis in 
vivo. Conversely, CXCR2 overexpression promoted resistance and aggressive 
phenotypes. Moreover, CXCR2 expression was found to be essential for 
vasculogenic mimicry (VM) formation in AGS cells. Importantly, knockdown or 
overexpression of CXCR2 modulated the expressions of p-PI3K, p-AKT, and 
VM-related proteins, including MMP2, MMP-14, VEGFR2, and PECAM1.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that IL-8/CXCR2 promotes apatinib resistance 
in human GC by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway and inducing VM. This work 
highlights a therapeutic strategy to improve apatinib efficacy and patient 
prognosis in GC.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prospective evidence 
for the association between use of hormonal contraceptives for 5 years or more 
and the subsequent incidence of breast cancer. We systematically searched all 
cohort studies published in English, Spanish, Italian, French, or Portuguese on 
PubMed or Web of Science up to September 8, 2025. We used Covidence software to 
manage most review activities. We extracted relative risks, odds ratios, or 
hazard ratios from each individual study to generate pooled results using a 
random-effects meta-analysis, and a dose-response meta-analysis to calculate 
relative risks and their 95 % confidence intervals for each additional year of 
use of hormonal contraceptives. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was applied to assess 
the quality of included studies. Several subgroup and sensitivity analyses were 
conducted. Twenty independent cohorts and 23 reports with a total of 5,572,683 
women and 72,350 incident cases of breast cancer were included in the systematic 
review, while 3,920,319 women with 68,508 incident cases were included in the 
meta-analysis. The pooled adjusted relative risk for the association between 
hormonal contraceptive use for 5 years or more and breast cancer risk was 1.20 
(95 % confidence interval, 1.09-1.32) compared with never users. Further 
meta-analyses on the dose-response relationship showed a nonlinear association, 
with risk progressively increasing during the first 5 years of use, after which 
the risk remained stable until the 10th year, when it increased again. This 
meta-analysis provides evidence of a detrimental association between duration of 
exposure to oral contraceptives and breast cancer risk.

The extracellular accumulation of adenosine is a central mechanism of immune 
evasion within the tumor microenvironment. Elevated adenosine levels-driven by 
hypoxia, chronic inflammation, and upregulated ectonucleotidase activity, 
primarily through ectonucleoside triphophate diphosphoydrolase 1 and 
ecto-5'-nucleotidase-induce profound immunosuppression and promote tumor 
progression. In this setting, adenosine acts mainly through 2 G protein-coupled 
receptors, the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AAR) and the adenosine A2B receptor 
(A2BAR), which modulate diverse immune and stromal cell populations. A2AAR 
signaling suppresses the effector activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and 
natural killer cells, whereas A2BAR activation exerts broader effects by 
amplifying myeloid-derived immunosuppression, driving stromal remodeling, and 
fostering angiogenesis and metastatic dissemination. This review provides a 
comprehensive overview of the distinct and converging roles of A2AAR and A2BAR 
in immune, stromal, and tumor compartments. We critically analyze current 
strategies for developing selective and dual A2AAR/A2BAR antagonists, with a 
focus on structure-activity relationships, scaffold optimization, and 
pharmacokinetic profiling. In addition, we examine ongoing clinical trials and 
emerging combination therapies involving A2AAR and A2BAR antagonists in 
conjunction with immune checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell therapies, 
enzymatic axis blockade, radiotherapy, and classical chemotherapy. We also 
underscore the therapeutic potential of dual A2AAR/A2BAR antagonists as a 
multitarget approach to counteract overlapping immunosuppressive mechanisms. 
Overall, targeting the adenosine axis-particularly through dual receptor 
blockade-represents a promising strategy for reprograming the tumor 
microenvironment, reinvigorating antitumor immunity, and improving the efficacy 
of cancer immunotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Adenosine signaling via 
adenosine A2A (A2AAR) and A2B (A2BAR) receptors plays a central role in 
tumor-induced immunosuppression, limiting the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. 
This review provides an integrated analysis of A2AAR and A2BAR functions across 
immune and stromal compartments, summarizes current selective antagonists (A2AAR 
and A2BAR) and dual antagonists, and highlights compounds in clinical studies. 
Moreover, it discusses synergistic combination strategies that integrate 
adenosine blockade with complementary immunotherapeutic and conventional 
approaches to enhance antitumor responses.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare various common approaches for handling missing 
vital status or follow-up time. As a case study for application of these 
methods, we estimated incidence of metachronous contralateral breast cancer 
(CBC).
METHODS: For 1980-2016, incidence of metachronous CBC with follow-up through 
2024 was estimated using Poisson regression with overdispersion, by age at 
incidence, year of incidence, histology and follow-up period. Missing follow-up 
time was ignored in the naive approach, simulated once using the average hazard 
derived from published Swiss cancer registry data, or multiply imputed using 3 
different imputation models.
RESULTS: 24,612 women aged 20-84 had unilateral breast cancer between 1980 and 
2016 in the Swiss cantons of Zurich and Zug. Of those, 5 % (n = 1264) were lost 
to follow-up. Over 291,463 person-years, 1145 contralateral breast malignancies 
were diagnosed, corresponding to 393 per 100,000 person-years (95 % CI 353-438). 
Incidence rates have been decreasing over time to 238 (171-333) for the 
incidence period 2010-2016. The same overall pattern was observed regardless of 
how we handled missing follow-up times. However, using a single imputation 
generally produced lower incidence rates compared to the naive approach, with 
multiple imputation giving higher estimates. The most complex multiple 
imputation model gave incidence estimates that were very similar to those from 
the naive approach.
CONCLUSION: Different methods to handle missing follow-up times yielded similar 
results: that CBC incidence has declined in recent decades. Multiple imputation 
is likely an appropriate method to handle missing follow-up data, enabling 
researchers to include all eligible individuals in the analysis.

OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a multimodal deep learning (DL) model that 
integrates preoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and 
postoperative whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict microsatellite instability 
(MSI) status in colorectal cancer (CRC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter study enrolled 305 CRC 
patients with paired CECT and WSIs. Patients from Center I and II were allocated 
to the training (n = 169) and internal validation (n = 85) sets, while those 
from Center III formed the external test set (n = 51). Pathology-based DL 
(PathDL) and venous-phase CECT (VPDL) models were constructed using 
EfficientNet-b0 and ResNet 101 architectures, respectively. A fusion model 
(F-VP-PathDL, Fusion of venous phase CT and pathology with deep learning) was 
developed using an adaptive residual network to integrate features from both 
modalities. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 
score.
RESULTS: The F-VP-PathDL model achieved strong performance on the internal 
validation set, with an AUC of 0.883 (95 % CI: 0.732-0.967). On the external 
test set, the model achieved an AUC of 0.905 (95 % CI: 0.831-0.945), 
outperforming single-modality and alternative fusion models (PathDL: 0.794; 
VPDL: 0.858; APDL: 0.802; F-AVPDL: 0.813). The model also demonstrated robust 
accuracy (84.2 %, 95 % CI: 69.1 %-92.8 %), sensitivity (80.3 %, 95 % CI: 
28.4 %-98.7 %), specificity (83.7 %, 95% CI: 68.8 %-93.9 %) and F1 score (0.837, 
95 % CI: 0.326-0.999) on the external test set.
CONCLUSIONS: The F-VP-PathDL model demonstrates robust generalizability across 
centers and offers a clinically scalable tool for MSI prediction in CRC, 
supporting patient stratification and informing immunotherapy decisions.

A disposable electrochemical biosensor was developed for the early diagnosis of 
metastatic colon cancer through the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), 
labeling with the electroactive anticancer drug, idarubicin (IDA) as a redox 
indicator. The sensing platform was constructed by modifying screen-printed 
carbon electrodes (SPCEs) layer-by-layer with multi-walled carbon nanotubes and 
poly-terthiophene benzoate, followed by the covalent immobilization of a colon 
cancer-specific aptamer (W3). Sequential modification of each sensing layer was 
confirmed via surface and electrochemical characterization experiments. 
Biocompatibility of the sensing components was initially validated through 
cytotoxicity assays, demonstrating high cell viability (92.8 %). Under optimized 
conditions, the biosensor achieved an excellent detection sensitivity, capable 
of identifying as few as three CTCs spiked in 1.0 mL whole blood using 
square-wave voltammetry. The sensor exhibited excellent analytical performance, 
with high accuracy (≥89.6 %), precision (coefficient of variation ≤5.1 %), 
anti-interference capability (relative interference effect ≤5 %), 
reproducibility (relative standard deviation ≤ 3 %), and operational stability 
for up to 36 days under laboratory-controlled conditions. The feasibility of the 
proposed sensor for practical application was validated through a preliminary 
clinical study involving five healthy volunteers and five colon cancer patients. 
Among them, one patient was identified as being at high risk for metastasis, 
presenting with 24 CTCs/mL, while the remaining four were classified as 
moderate-risk cases, with CTC levels ranging from 4 to 9 cells/mL.

BACKGROUND: Spain is the fourth largest pharmaceutical market in Europe, yet the 
time to reimbursement for cancer drugs has been considerably longer than in 
other European countries in recent years.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyse the key factors influencing the time to 
reimbursement decision (TTRD) and access in Spain for a wide range of oncology 
indications.
METHODS: Cancer drugs approved by the European Commission (EC) between 2010 and 
2023 were reviewed. TTRD and time to reimbursement (TTR) were calculated. 
Variables were categorized into three groups: pricing and reimbursement aspects, 
the European regulatory process, and quality of evidence. Both univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 88 indications were included in cohort A (newly approved 
drugs) and 220 in cohort B (all indications). Median TTRD was 528 days for 
cohort A and 524 for cohort B. In cohort A, shorter TTRD was associated with 
phase III trials (HR: 9.98; 95 %CI (2.61-38.08); p < 0.001) and availability of 
quality of life (QoL) data (HR: 5.30; 95 %CI (2.01-13.96); p < 0.001). In cohort 
B, overall survival (OS) data availability correlated with shorter TTRD (HR: 
2.27; 95 %CI (1.11-4.66); p < 0.05). Notably, TTRD was significantly longer 
during 2020-2023 compared to previous years in both cohorts. No significant 
associations were found for the remaining variables.
CONCLUSIONS: The quality of clinical evidence, including phase III trials, QoL, 
and OS data, plays a crucial role in shortening TTRD. In addition, recent years 
have seen a substantial delay in reimbursement timelines in Spain.

PURPOSE: Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for locally advanced 
rectal cancer (LARC) involves challenges in evaluating and predicting the 
preoperative response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Deep learning (DL) 
methods incorporating MRI are widely utilized for cancer diagnosis and outcome 
prediction. This study aims to develop and validate DL models based on 
preoperative T2-weighted MR images combined with radiological and 
clinicopathological data, and to assess their performance in predicting 
pathological T (pT)-downstaging after CRT.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 318 patients with histopathologically 
confirmed LARC, randomly assigned to a training set (n = 223) or internal test 
set (n = 95). An additional 88 patients comprised the external test set. DL 
models integrating T2-weighted MR images with radiological and 
clinicopathological characteristics were constructed to predict pT-downstaging. 
Model performance was evaluated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
analysis; DeLong's test was used to compare ROC curves.
RESULTS: The combined models (clinicopathological + T2-weighted MR images, MRI 
characteristics + T2-weighted MR images, and the all-combined model) 
demonstrated superior diagnostic performance in both internal and external test 
sets, with areas under the curve (AUCs) ranging from 0.800 to 0.817 and 0.802 to 
0.810, respectively. AUCs of the T2-weighted MRI-only model and the combined 
models significantly differed (P < 0.05); no significant differences were 
observed among the three combined models.
CONCLUSION: The proposed combined DL models demonstrated strong predictive 
performance for pT-downstaging after neoadjuvant CRT in LARC, with the MRI 
characteristics + T2-weighted MR images model also performing well without 
clinicopathological features.

Breast cancer, the second leading cause of death among women globally, presents 
challenges to conventional treatments. To combat this, researchers are more 
interested in developing minimally invasive alternative treatments and have 
emerged with a potential photodynamic treatment (PDT). To enhance the PDT 
efficacy and explore its potential in biological applications, materials such as 
upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are being utilized. In this context, a 
combination of mesoporous silica core-shell UCNPs (mSi-CS-UCNPs: 
mSi-NaYF4@NaSmF4) loaded with Hypocrellin B (HB) was successfully synthesized 
via a layer-by-layer method (hydrothermal and coprecipitation methods). The 
structural and morphological studies of the synthesized HB-loaded mSi-CS-UCNPs 
were performed by XRD, FESEM, and HRTEM. The HB content was determined by 
RP-HPLC with peak detection at 254 nm and 3.8 min retention time. The in vitro 
release profile for HB, α-, and αβ-HB-mSi-CS-UCNPs gives 4.87, 38.9, and 56.47% 
of HB release at 72 h, respectively. The α and αβ phases of HB-mSi-CS-UCNPs 
under 980 nm near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation show 39 and 42% cell 
viability with a 29 μg/mL IC50 value on 24 h treatment, which is less compared 
to that of the blank and HB-mSi-CS-UCNPs without light irradiation. 
Consequently, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, cell apoptosis assay, and 
mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) of HB-loaded mSi-CS-UCNPs-treated MCF-7 
breast cancer cells under 980 nm light irradiation also show better results, 
which represent higher singlet oxygen (1O2) production, leading to late 
apoptotic cells and features a decrease of ΔΨm by ROS generation. These results 
indicate that the HB-mSi-CS-UCNPs can effectively activate the loaded 
photosensitizers in the presence of 980 nm NIR light irradiation and produce 1O2 
for cancer cell death by either apoptosis or necrosis and could be used as a 
therapeutic modality for the treatment of breast cancers.

In recent years, developing effective theranostic agents for precise cancer 
treatment has been one of the most prevalent strategies. Herein, three 
staurosporine derivatives, MCY-STS, ECY-STS, and ICY-STS, synthesized through 
minor modifications of natural staurosporine, are reported. These derivatives 
not only exhibit attractive fluorescence properties, including solvatochromism 
and dual-state (solution and solid) emission, but also demonstrate potent 
protein kinase C inhibitory activity and anticancer effects against NCI-N87, 
MCF-7, and SK-OV-3 cell lines. Theoretical calculation analyses, including 
density functional theory calculations, molecular docking, and molecular 
dynamics simulations, are employed to elucidate their protein-ligand 
interactions and luminescence mechanisms. Further investigations reveal that 
ECY-STS significantly inhibits tumor growth while illuminating tumor tissues for 
therapy visualization. Collectively, these modified fluorescent staurosporine 
derivatives, particularly ECY-STS, represent promising theranostic agents that 
provide a novel strategy for cancer imaging and treatment in humans.

PURPOSE: Metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) is a leading cause 
of cancer mortality in the United States. Although fluorouracil, leucovorin, 
irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) and gemcitabine with NAB-paclitaxel 
(GnP) represent first-line chemotherapy options for mPDAC, practice patterns in 
older adults remain understudied. We describe national treatment trends, factors 
associated with treatment selection, and receipt of second-line treatment in 
older adults with mPDAC.
METHODS: Using the SEER-Medicare linked database (2010-2019), we identified a 
cohort of individuals age 66 years and older diagnosed with mPDAC who initiated 
infusion chemotherapy within 90 days of diagnosis. Temporal trends in first-line 
treatment selection were quantified for the overall population and stratified by 
levels of a claims-based frailty index (robust, prefrail, and frail). We used 
multinomial logistic regression to describe associations between patient factors 
and first-line agent received adjusted for year of diagnosis. We characterized 
median time on first-line therapy, use of supportive care interventions, and 
receipt of second-line therapy.
RESULTS: Among 7,473 adults with mPDAC (median age = 74 years, 50.7% female), 
gemcitabine monotherapy was the predominant treatment in 2010 at 69.3%, but in 
2019 it fell to the third most-used regimen (16.6%) behind GnP (45.2%) and 
FOLFIRINOX (20.9%). In the most recent data (2019), 29.8%, 19.8%, and 6.8% of 
robust, prefrail, and frail individuals received FOLFIRINOX, respectively. 
Factors associated with regimen selection included age, sex, race/ethnicity, 
comorbidity, and frailty. Approximately one third of FOLFIRINOX initiators 
received second-line GnP (36.3%) and vice versa (31.1%).
CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy use has evolved for older adults with mPDAC and varies 
across levels of baseline frailty. The heterogeneity in chemotherapy selection 
and practice patterns in older adults merits ongoing investigation to help 
ensure patients receive treatment tailored to their unique geriatric needs.

PURPOSE: Access to clinical notes enhances patient engagement and trust, and the 
21st Century Cures Act enabled immediate electronic patient access in April 
2021. Yet, technological advances may perpetuate disparities, which remain 
understudied. Understanding whether inequities in note access exist in oncology 
would highlight challenges around making this foundational health information 
available to all patients receiving ongoing, complex medical care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study at a high-volume specialty cancer center 
explored disparities around clinical notes posted to patients' portal accounts 
from September 1, 2021, to August 31, 2022, and accessed by March 19, 2024. 
Logistic and Poisson regression were used to identify patient characteristics 
associated with note access and note opening rates.
RESULTS: The study included 124,554 patients and 815,104 clinical notes, 43.7% 
of which (356,290) were accessed. Although modest differences in access rates 
emerged around sex, age, and marital status, larger disparities appeared for 
ethnicity, race, and language: Black patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.63 [95% CI, 
0.60 to 0.66]; P < .001; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.74 [95% CI, 0.73 to 
0.76]; P < .001), Hispanic patients (OR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.80 to 0.90]; P < .001; 
IRR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.89 to 0.92]; P < .001), and non-English-preferred language 
speakers (OR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.72 to 0.84]; P < .001; IRR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.80 to 
0.84]; P < .001) were, respectively, 37%, 15%, and 22% less likely to open at 
least one note, and opened 26%, 10%, and 18% percent fewer notes, compared with 
white, non-Hispanic, and English-preferred patients, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This analysis highlighted disparities, by race, ethnicity, and 
language, in cancer patients' accessing clinical notes. Tailored interventions 
are crucial to ensure that diverse groups benefit from digital health care 
resources.

PURPOSE: Goals-of-care (GOC) discussions during advanced serious illness and 
end-of-life (EOL) care are critical. Institutions are increasingly tracking the 
frequency and timing of GOC documentation, but large-scale content assessments 
have been limited. We aimed to use natural language processing (NLP) to assess 
GOC documentation quality and associations with EOL care for patients with 
cancer.
METHODS: This is a retrospective review of patients at a single US center who 
died with cancer between 2018 and 2022, and had documented GOC notes in the last 
12 months of life. Eight GOC components were identified: current understanding 
of illness, information preferences, prognostic disclosure, goals, fears, 
acceptable function, trade-offs, and family involvement. NLP software searched 
for the aggregate presence of these components at the patient level within 
extracted GOC notes. We evaluated associations between these eight components 
and receipt of aggressive EOL care (chemotherapy within 14 days of death, no 
hospice care, or hospice admission ≤3 days of death).
RESULTS: Two thousand thirty-one patients met inclusion criteria. The most 
common GOC component addressed was family involvement (75.0%) and the least 
common was fears (21.1%). Only 5.4% had all eight components documented. More 
comprehensive GOC notes were associated with lower rates of aggressive EOL care; 
73.2% received aggressive care when 0/8 components were documented, compared 
with 56.8% and 50.3% with six or seven components discussed, respectively. In 
multivariate logistic regression, GOC components documented (≤6 v ≥7: OR, 2.13; 
P < .0001) and primary tumor site (lymphoma: OR, 2.86; P < .0001) were 
independent predictors of aggressive EOL care.
CONCLUSION: Increasingly comprehensive and higher-quality GOC documentation is 
associated with a lower likelihood of receiving aggressive EOL care. 
Opportunities to improve the quality and documentation of GOC conversations may 
affect EOL care for patients with cancer.

Universal Genetic Testing for Pancreatic Cancer: Closing the Gap on a Missed 
Opportunity.

Approximately 10%-15% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) are caused by 
pathogenic germline variants (PGVs). Universal genetic testing (UGT) for PDAC, 
regardless of family history, was first recommended in 2018. Successful PDAC UGT 
implementation is crucial for targeted treatment and familial risk assessment. 
However, clinical of UGT introduction presents unique challenges for patients 
with PDAC with poor health and life expectancy. Data are available regarding UGT 
uptake in PDAC via different genetics service delivery models. However, most 
studies were conducted before the PDAC UGT recommendation and COVID-19 pandemic, 
which led to increased telemedicine utilization. Multiple genetic counseling 
(GC) and testing options are now available, including traditional, embedded, or 
group GC and point-of-care testing (POCT). Thus, oncology providers need a 
comprehensive resource regarding effective PDAC UGT integration into clinical 
practice. Therefore, we applied a narrative review approach to summarize 17 
publications from January 2020 to February 2025 on various genetics models in 
PDAC UGT, focused on test uptake. The most commonly used model was POCT (58.8%). 
The overall uptake rates were lowest with traditional GC alone (6.0%-21.9%), and 
highest with embedded GCs ± POCT (66.8%-78.4%) or POCT alone (22.1%-93.2%). 
Additional observed PDAC POCT benefits included decreased attrition rates, fewer 
patients deceased pre-result, quicker test turnaround times, and conservation of 
limited GC resources. Notably, genetic counselors played an important role in 
POCT via development of patient-facing informational materials, physician 
education, post-test result disclosure, and identification of relatives eligible 
for cascade testing and/or high-risk screening. Overall, current data indicate 
that oncologist-coordinated POCT plus genetics-facilitated education efforts and 
result disclosure may be the best method to optimize PDAC UGT uptake. Further 
research is needed regarding automated referral systems and/or telemedicine 
options.

PURPOSE: Growing use of multigene panels (MGPs) is increasing the number of 
patients identified with multiple pathogenic germline variants (PGVs) in cancer 
predisposition genes. This study characterizes the landscape of patients with 
multiple PGVs and identifies clinical settings where multiple PGVs affect 
management.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a single-institution retrospective cohort 
analysis comprising patients seen in the Department of Clinical Genetics and 
consented to the Risk Assessment Program (RAP) Registry who were evaluated with 
a MGP and found to have multiple PGVs.
RESULTS: All patients tested between January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2024, and 
found to have multiple PGV are included. Sixty-four patients (64/7,961, 0.8%) 
from 58 families carried multiple PGVs, 22/64 (34%) patients carried at least 
two PGVs in high- or moderate-risk genes, and 33/64 (52%) carried at least two 
PGVs that result in potential management changes. Five percent (30/557) of all 
patients with a PGV in BRCA1 or BRCA2 also carried an additional PGV, while 7% 
(19/284) of patients with a PGV in a mismatch repair (MMR) gene also carried an 
additional PGV. Ten patients from nine unrelated families had both a PGV in 
BRCA1 or BRCA2 as well as a PGV in an MMR gene.
CONCLUSION: Although the overall percentage of patients undergoing clinical 
genetic testing with multiple PGVs is small, a significant fraction of these 
patients could benefit from medical management changes because of the 
identification of multiple PGVs.

INTRODUCTION: Significant disparities persist in timely, guideline-concordant 
breast cancer treatment across the United States, impacting cancer outcomes. The 
influence of both patient-level and facility-level socioeconomic status (SES) on 
adherence to Commission on Cancer (CoC) quality measures remains incompletely 
understood.
STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the National 
Cancer Database (NCDB) to assess associations between patient and facility SES 
and concordance with timeliness of three CoC breast cancer quality measures: 
surgery, multi-agent chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, among patients diagnosed 
from 2018 to 2022. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to 
evaluate predictors of concordant care, including a composite measure of 
facility-level social risk.
RESULTS: The analytic cohorts included 471,425 patients for surgery, 82,734 for 
chemotherapy, and 311,523 for radiotherapy. Black race, uninsured status, and 
low educational attainment were each independently associated with lower odds of 
guideline-concordant care across all measures. Patients treated at low-SES 
facilities had higher odds of timely surgery (adjusted OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 
1.24-1.31) but lower odds of timely chemotherapy (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79-0.91) 
and radiotherapy (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.97) compared to those at other 
institutions. Facility type, fragmented care, and comorbidities also contributed 
to variation in concordance.
CONCLUSION: Significant disparities in guideline-concordant breast cancer care 
persist by race, insurance, education, and facility-level social risk, 
highlighting intervention opportunities to improve outcomes for these already 
vulnerable populations. These findings highlight the importance of policy and 
institutional strategies that address both patient- and facility-level barriers 
to ensure equitable access to high-quality multidisciplinary treatment.

Pancreatic cancer presents a significant therapeutic challenge characterized by 
poor survival rates, leading to development of innovative treatment strategies. 
This study evaluated the anti-cancer potential of 7-methoxyheptaphylline (7-MH), 
a carbazole alkaloid from Clausena harmandiana, against pancreatic cancer cells 
(PANC-1) and developed an environmentally sustainable extraction methodology 
using ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE). 7-MH demonstrated selective 
cytotoxicity against PANC-1 cells with preferential activity under nutrient 
deprivation conditions (PC50 = 4.54 μM) compared to nutrient-rich conditions 
(IC50 = 46.84 μM). This compound exhibited minimal toxicity toward normal MCE301 
epithelial cells (IC50 = 83.4 μM). Live-cell imaging showed dose-dependent 
apoptotic morphology including membrane blebbing and cell shrinkage within 24 
hours. At concentrations of 25 and 50 μM, the compound significantly inhibited 
wound closure and colony formation, suggesting antimetastatic properties. 
Mechanistic analysis exhibited that 7-MH suppressed the phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
signaling pathway specially under nutrient deprived conditions. Western blot 
analysis showed 45% reduction in Akt expression, 43% decrease in mTOR 
phosphorylation, and complete inhibition of Akt phosphorylation at 20 µM 
concentration. For sustainable extraction of 7-MH, UAE using ethanol was 
optimized through response surface methodology (RSM) with central composite 
design (CCD). The optimal protocol (50 °C, 60 minutes, 0.40 g/10 mL 
plant/solvent ratio) achieved 1.26 ± 0.02% yield with only 3.55% deviation from 
predicted values. This developed extraction method provides an efficient and 
environmentally sustainable alternative to conventional halogenated solvent 
extraction methods. These findings offer valuable insights for advancing natural 
product-based cancer therapeutics and demonstrate the implementation of 
sustainable natural products extraction principles.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most prevalent cancer 
globally and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Based on 
recent studies, lipid levels may have a relationship with the risk of CRC. This 
meta-analysis aims to better understand the association between various serum 
lipids and CRC risk.
METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in Web of Science, PubMed, and 
Scopus. This meta-analysis, including only prospective cohort studies, performed 
random-effects meta-analyses using the Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) 
model to assess the association between the highest versus lowest categories of 
serum triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein 
(HDL), and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) with the risk of CRC, primarily using 
hazard ratios (HR) as the effect size. Subgroup analyses (e.g., by tumor site, 
region, and risk of bias) and meta-regression analyses (e.g., for mean age, mean 
BMI, sex distribution, and duration of follow-up) were conducted to explore 
heterogeneity. Dose-response analyses were performed utilizing three model 
types.
RESULTS: Following the screening of 27,278 articles, 23 articles have been 
included in this study finally. The associations between TG, TC, HDL, and LDL 
levels and the risk of CRC, colon, and rectum cancers were examined separately. 
Higher levels of TC were not significantly associated with the risk of CRC 
(HR = 1.08; 95% CI: 0.90-1.30; I2 = 50.55%; p = 0.4187) and colon cancer 
(HR = 1.08; 95% CI: 0.99-1.18; I2 = 35.57%; p = 0.0720), but were significantly 
associated with an increased risk of rectum cancer (HR = 1.19; 95% CI: 
1.08-1.32; I2 = 28.36%; p = 0.0004). Higher levels of TG were associated with an 
increased hazard of CRC (HR 1.11; 95% CI: 1.044-1.18; I2 = 0.0%; p = 0.0008). 
For colon cancer, TG showed a marginally significant association (HR 1.23; 95% 
CI: 0.99-1.55; I2 = 52.0%; p = 0.0576). No significant association was found 
between TG levels and rectum cancer risk (HR 1.036; 95% CI: 0.69-1.56; 
I2 = 67.29%; p = 0.8674).Also, higher levels of HDL were not significantly 
associated with the risk of CRC (HR 0.93; 95% CI: 0.83-1.03; I2 = 28.8%; 
p = 0.1527), colon cancer (HR 0.94; 95% CI: 0.75-1.19; I2 = 0.0%; p = 0.6243), 
and rectum cancer (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.66;1.37; I2 = 0.0%; p = 0.7888). For 
colon cancer, higher LDL level was not significantly associated with risk (HR 
0.91; 95% CI: 0.60-1.37; p = 0.21; I2 = 37%; p = 6558). Accordingly quadratic 
and RCS models represented as lowest AIC for TC (p = 0.026), for TG (p = 0.004), 
for LDL (p = 0.942) and for HDL (p = 0.295).
CONCLUSION: Higher TG level was significantly associated with increased risk of 
CRC and showed a borderline association with colon cancer (HR 1.23, 95% CI 
0.99-1.55; p = 0.0576), while TC, HDL, and LDL showed no significant 
associations with these cancers. For rectum cancer, higher TC was significantly 
linked to increased risk, whereas TG, HDL, and LDL showed no significant 
associations. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies to 
investigate the mechanistic roles of hormones and the gut microbiota in 
modulating colorectal cancer risk, alongside multi-omics studies that integrate 
lipid metabolism with other biological variables such as inflammatory markers 
and genetic predispositions. These efforts could clarify causal pathways and 
inform targeted prevention strategies.

BACKGROUND: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a prevalent RNA modification in 
eukaryotes that regulates RNA stability and translation. Dysregulated m6A 
modification is implicated in cancer progression. This study investigated the 
role of the m6A reader protein, insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding 
protein 2 (IGF2 BP2), in the progression of thyroid cancer (TC).
METHODS: Cell proliferation was assessed using cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) and 
5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assays. Cell migration and invasion were 
evaluated by Transwell assays. A xenograft tumor model was employed to examine 
the impact of IGF2 BP2 on tumor growth in vivo. Gene functional annotation was 
performed through GO analysis. Spearman correlation analysis was utilized to 
evaluate the relationship between the expression levels of cathepsin H (CTSH) 
and IGF2 BP2. RIP-qPCR and RNA pull-down assays were conducted to confirm the 
interaction between IGF2 BP2 and CTSH mRNA.
RESULTS: Elevated IGF2 BP2 expression correlated significantly with advanced N 
stage in TC. Knockdown of IGF2 BP2 inhibited TC cell proliferation, migration, 
and invasion in vitro, as well as tumor growth in vivo. CTSH expression mirrored 
IGF2 BP2 expression. IGF2 BP2 interacted with CTSH mRNA, enhancing its stability 
in an m6A-dependent manner. Overexpression of CTSH counteracted the effects of 
IGF2 BP2 knockdown on TC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
CONCLUSION: IGF2 BP2 accelerates TC progression by recognizing and stabilizing 
m6A-modified CTSH mRNA. IGF2 BP2 and CTSH represent potential diagnostic and 
therapeutic targets for TC.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a rapidly metastasizing cancer 
characterized by a dense desmoplastic stroma comprised of extracellular matrix 
(ECM) proteins, which complicates treatment. Upon stimulation, pancreatic 
stellate cells (PSCs) differentiated into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) 
that are the source of ECM and cytokines in PDAC. We previously reported that 
mechanical stress activates PSCs and induces fibrosis through mechanical ion 
channel PIEZO1-mediated TRPV4 channel activation, but its role in PDAC remains 
unclear. Here we report that pathological activation of PIEZO1 differentiated 
human PSCs into an inflammatory CAF phenotype that expresses chemoresistance and 
cancer stemness markers CD10 and GPR77. In an orthotopic PDAC model, TRPV4 
knockout mice exhibited a significant reduction in tumor size, circulating 
inflammatory cytokines, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP1), and 
pre-metastatic niche markers, serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins. A similar trend 
was observed in mice lacking functional PIEZO1 in PSCs. The livers of TRPV4 
knockout mice exhibited fewer cancer cell microlesions, lacked macro tumors, 
produced lower levels of inflammatory protein S100A8, and developed fewer 
inflammatory cell clusters. In orthotopic and genetically engineered models of 
PDAC, these mice also had improved survival, suggesting that blocking TRPV4 
channels may be a promising therapeutic target for PDAC.

BACKGROUND: HER2-positive breast cancer is leading to aggressive tumor growth 
and a higher risk of metastasis, particularly to the central nervous system 
(CNS). Routine brain imaging for asymptomatic HER2-positive patients is debated, 
with no current consensus; Given the severe clinical implications of brain 
metastases, further research is needed to determine the cost-effectiveness and 
clinical utility of routine imaging for high-risk patients to improve outcomes 
and inform targeted screening protocols.
METHODS: This retrospective, monocentric study at the General Hospital of Vienna 
(AKH Wien) examined female HER2-positive breast cancer patients at first 
diagnosis to assess brain metastasis from January 2019 to February 2024. The 
study included patients with asymptomatic confirmed HER2 positive breast cancer. 
Data were collected through comprehensive medical records and brain imaging with 
MRI.
RESULTS: Among 110 female patients meeting the inclusion criteria, 4 (3.6%) were 
diagnosed with brain metastases. Ki67 showed a marginal association with brain 
metastasis (p = 0.054), and tumor grade was a significant predictor, with 
intermediate differentiated tumors (G2 vs. G3) associated with a higher risk of 
brain metastases (p = 0.041) and brain metases are correlating with the axillary 
lymphnode status and the tumor sizeAlso, the absence of positive Östrogen and 
Progesteron receptors is a predictor in upcoming brain metastases (p < 0.001). 
Other factors like age were not significantly associated.
CONCLUSION: This study found limited benefit in routine MRI for detecting 
asymptomatic brain metastases in HER2-positive breast cancer, given the low 
prevalence (3.6%). A targeted imaging approach for high-risk patients, like 
those with the absence of Hormon receptors and higher stage tumors, may be 
effective.

INTRODUCTION: Rates of pediatric differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) have been 
increasing, yet disparities in incidence, diagnosis, and treatment across race 
and ethnicity have not been fully explored.
METHODS: We assessed temporal trends in the incidence of pediatric DTC using 
data from 2000-2022 (excluding 2020 due to COVID-19) from the National Childhood 
Cancer Registry. Annual percent changes (APC) were calculated using joinpoint 
regression analysis overall and by race, ethnicity, age, and clinical factors. 
Differences in cancer presentation and treatment by race and ethnicity were 
evaluated using data from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) for 
18 registries for 2006-2018, while accounting for socioeconomic status (SES).
RESULTS: Overall pediatric DTC incidence increased 4.5% annually from 2000-2018 
(95%CI: 3.8%-5.8%), then declined (-6.9%) through 2022 (95%CI: -14.5%, -1.2%). 
Rates of decline appeared sharpest among Non-Hispanic White patients. Incidence 
rates continued increasing among Non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islanders and 
patients diagnosed with tumors >4 cm. Compared to non-Hispanic White patients, 
non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic children 
were more likely to be diagnosed with a tumor >4 cm.
CONCLUSION: Declines in reported pediatric thyroid cancer incidence, 
particularly among the smallest tumor sizes, after 2018 may be attributable to 
application of thyroid cancer management guidelines. However, the continued 
increase among those presenting with larger tumor sizes may support a true 
continued increase in incidence among some groups. The greater proportion of 
non-White children being diagnosed with larger tumors could be due to inequities 
related to timely access to care, differential application of thyroid management 
guidelines, differences in cancer subtypes, or other factors. These findings 
warrant further exploration when additional years of data are available.

Cancer Reporting Protocols in transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) - 
standardized reporting of bladder cancer and improvement of communication 
between pathologists and urologists.

Gallardo Zamora L, Hohage J, Degener S, Dotse J, Schiereck T, Rey Cardenas M, 
Kvasnicka HM, von Rundstedt FC, Gödde D.

INTRODUCTION: The College of American Pathologists (CAP) provides synoptic 
reporting (SR) histopathological protocols for various malignancies e.g. for 
bladder cancer. We investigated whether SR can enhance the quality of 
histopathological reporting at our institution. Specifically, we examined 
whether SR supports pathologists in report preparation and whether urologists of 
varying training levels fully understand the histopathological information in 
narrative reports (NR).
METHODS: We investigated the transcription of semantic reports into synoptic CAP 
protocols by pathologists and clinicians. Through retrospective evaluation, 187 
NR were re-evaluated using a CAP protocol by a senior pathologist to assess 
reporting quality and completeness. Additionally, 50 NR were independently 
transcribed into synoptic protocols by a resident trainee and board-certified 
urologists to evaluate clinical adoption.
RESULTS: SR demonstrated advantages in detailing specific pathological features, 
especially rare variants and tumor characteristics, despite high overall 
concordance between formats. Diagnostic accuracy improved with clinical 
experience, with uro-oncologist and department head outperforming the urology 
resident.
CONCLUSIONS: SR has the potential to improve the communication between 
pathologists and urologists and enhance the quality of care. It also increased 
standardization and minimized omissions, highlighting its potential to reduce or 
eliminate information loss.

A phototriggered and pH-responsive cancer drug delivery system based on 
polymeric micelles was formulated, utilizing easily available and cost-effective 
materials such as an amphiphilic diblock copolymer (mPEG-PLA) and a Spiropyran 
derivative. It addressed the major challenges in drug delivery systems, i.e., 
monitoring real-time drug release, targeted, and on-demand drug delivery. To 
monitor real-time drug release, the fluorescence quenching of the cancer drug, 
doxorubicin (DOX), by in situ synthesized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) through the 
Nanomaterial Surface Energy Transfer (NSET) mechanism was explored. 
Photoisomerization and size switching were characterized using UV-vis 
spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques. The NSET process 
during in situ synthesis of AuNPs and drug release from nanocarrier after 365 nm 
UV light exposure was demonstrated by steady-state and time-resolved 
fluorescence of DOX. The mPEG-PLA-Spiropyran-DOX (3:1:1) formulation exhibited ∼ 
73.16% encapsulation efficiency and ∼ 6.45% DOX-loading with proven kinetic 
stability. Sustained DOX release over 50 h was validated through in vitro 
studies at pH 5.5, 6.5, and 7.4, showing enhanced DOX release at acidic pH 5.5, 
representative of cancer cell organelles with prolonged UV exposure. Cell 
internalization, intracellular phototriggered drug release, and fluorescence 
cell imaging in mouse breast adenocarcinoma cells (4T1) were investigated. The 
results demonstrated that the micellar nanocarrier, after 365 nm UV light 
exposure, was highly efficient in inducing apoptosis, significant cytotoxicity, 
and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Furthermore, in vivo studies were 
conducted in both oral and breast cancer-bearing mice to assess tumor growth 
inhibition, changes in body weight, tumor weight, and immunohistochemical 
analysis. Notably, the therapeutic response was more pronounced in oral cancer, 
allowing for enhanced UV penetration and efficient activation of the micellar 
system. Overall, this study highlighted the potential of the dual-responsive 
micellar drug delivery system for targeted, on-demand cancer therapy with 
real-time monitoring. The enhanced efficacy in treating superficial malignancies 
underscores its promise for future clinical applications.

INTRODUCTION: The Speech Handicap Index (SHI) is a self-reported measure that 
facilitates assessing the speech difficulties of patients with head and neck 
cancer (HNC). A valid outcome measure in Tamil language is vital to evaluating 
the speech difficulties among Tamil-speaking persons treated for HNC. This study 
aimed to adapt and assess the reliability and validity of using the SHI-Tamil 
among Tamil-speaking individuals treated for HNC.
METHODS: The Tamil version of SHI was finalized by reviewing an existing version 
through back translation, expert reviews, and cognitive interviews with 
participants in a pilot study. Ninety-five patients with HNC and 61 healthy 
adults completed the SHI-T and speech domain of the University of Washington 
Quality of Life questionnaire V4. As many as 21 patients completed the SHI 
questionnaire again within 2 weeks to assess test-rest reliability.
RESULTS: The Tamil-adapted version of the SHI demonstrated excellent internal 
consistency (α = 0.97) and very strong test-retest reliability (ρ = 0.87). SHI 
scores significantly differed between the patients (Mdn = 16.0, IQR = 65) and 
the healthy group (Mdn = 0, IQR = 1). Within the patient group, SHI scores 
distinguished patients with and without self-reported speech concerns and the 
type of cancer treatment in the tongue cancer subset. The total and domain 
scores of SHI correlated significantly with the University of Washington Quality 
of Life questionnaire V4 (r > 0.8), indicating the construct validity of SHI.
CONCLUSION: The Tamil version of SHI is a culturally relevant, valid, and 
reliable patient-reported outcome measure for assessing speech difficulties 
among persons treated for HNC.

BACKGROUND: Brain tumors are among the most aggressive malignancies requiring 
multimodal therapy, including chemotherapy. In India, where healthcare is 
predominantly financed out of pocket, the cost of anticancer medications poses a 
significant barrier to treatment adherence. A wide disparity exists between the 
costliest branded drugs and their lower-cost alternatives, raising concerns 
about affordability and equity in care. This study aimed to perform a 
cost-minimization analysis (CMA) to quantify cost differences (CDs) among the 
most expensive, least expensive, and generic chemotherapy drugs used for brain 
tumor treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive pharmacoeconomic study compared the 
costs of eight chemotherapy agents-temozolomide, procarbazine, lomustine, 
carmustine, vincristine, bevacizumab, irinotecan, and carboplatin. Drug prices 
were sourced from the Current Index of Medical Stores (CIMS) and government 
databases. Dosages were standardized based on average Indian adult body surface 
area (BSA). Cost metrics included CD, cost ratio (CR), and percentage cost 
variation (PCV). Regimen-wise costs were calculated per cycle and overall.
RESULTS: Significant cost variation was observed across all formulations. 
Temozolomide 250 mg showed the highest fold difference (8.94×), while 
bevacizumab displayed a 3.3× difference. Adjuvant temozolomide over 12 months 
ranged from ₹32,220 (generic) to ₹3,90,000 (costliest brand). PCV values ranged 
from 27.7% (carboplatin) to over 700% (temozolomide). Most CDs were 
statistically significant (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study highlights substantial pricing disparities in 
chemotherapy for brain tumors in India. Cost-effective alternatives can 
significantly reduce treatment-related financial toxicity. Incorporating 
pharmacoeconomic evidence into prescribing decisions is essential to improve 
equitable access to neuro-oncology care.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, polarimetric imaging has been developed for various 
biological applications, including tissue morphological characterization and 
cancer stage detection. However, to facilitate classification models based on 
the characteristics of polarization states, it is essential to develop a 
consistent and standardized dataset of polarimetric images.
FINDINGS: This study presents a dataset of colorectal cancer polarimetric images 
designated as ColoPola, which is intended to facilitate research efforts in the 
field. The dataset consists of 572 sample slices (288 healthy and 284 
malignant). For each slice, 36 polarimetric images corresponding to different 
polarization states are provided. Thus, ColoPola contains 20,592 polarimetric 
images, of which 10,368 correspond to healthy samples and 10,224 to malignant 
samples. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the dataset is the first of its 
kind for colorectal cancer images. The practical utility of the dataset is 
evaluated using 5 models: 3 models constructed from scratch (CNN, CNN_2, and 
EfficientFormerV2) and 2 pretrained models (DenseNet and EfficientNetV2). For 
each model, the input has a size of 224 × 224 × 36, corresponding to the width, 
height, and red channel value of the polarimetric images, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the CNN, CNN_2, EfficientFormerV2, DenseNet, 
and EfficientNetV2 models obtain F1 scores of 0.870, 0.862, 0.908, 0.903, and 
0.965, respectively, on the testing set. Among the 5 models, EfficientNetV2 
achieves the best performance, with all the performance metrics exceeding 0.95 
for both the validation set and the testing set. Overall, the results suggest 
that ColoPola has significant potential as a polarimetric optical imaging-based 
diagnostic tool for colorectal cancer in clinical practice.

Malliaros FD, Raieli S.

Cancer is a complex disease where treatment resistance frequently arises, posing 
a significant challenge for patient survival. Predicting the emergence of 
resistance and understanding its underlying mechanisms are crucial for improving 
therapeutic strategies. This study introduces TIGENet, an interpretable model 
for predicting therapy response in oncology and identifying potential 
therapeutic targets. TIGENet integrates a variational autoencoder for 
dimensionality reduction with a Graph Neural Network model to predict patient 
responses to cancer treatments. We employ a graph explainer to highlight the 
most influential genes driving model predictions, improving interpretability. 
Our model uses breast cancer transcriptomic and clinical data to identify 
patients at risk of developing resistance and the key molecular factors 
involved. By combining tumor- and patient-centered perspectives, these findings 
contribute to advancing personalized therapeutic interventions.

BACKGROUND: Globally, cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers, yet it 
is largely preventable. Switching methods for primary screening from cytology 
testing, via Pap test, to human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is a component of 
that prevention. OncoSim-Cervix, a Canadian cervical cancer microsimulation 
model, assesses the long-term effects of HPV vaccination and screening 
interventions. This study projects the impact of differing roll-out strategies 
for HPV primary testing for cervical cancer screening in Canada.
DATA AND METHODS: OncoSim-Cervix simulates the progression from HPV infection to 
cervical cancer, incorporating Canadian data on incidence, mortality, HPV 
vaccination, screening, and costs. This analysis compared the effect of 
different roll-out strategies for switching from current practice to HPV primary 
screening every five years. Using OncoSim-Cervix, the study simulated one status 
quo scenario (cytology primary screening every three years) and three 
quinquennial HPV primary screening scenarios: (1) one-time roll-out, (2) 
population-based roll-out over two years, and (3) age-based roll-out over three 
years.
RESULTS: All HPV screening roll-out strategies were found to improve clinical 
outcomes, with reductions of approximately 20% in cervical cancer cases and 18% 
in deaths, while screening less frequently, compared with cytology screening. 
The one-time roll-out scenario initially spiked colposcopy referrals by 60%, 
while phased implementation produced smaller peaks (35% to 40%) followed by 
declining referrals, compared with cytology screening.
INTERPRETATION: Switching from three-year cytology to five-year HPV testing 
improves outcomes, with phased strategies mitigating the initial colposcopy 
surge. Modelling can help programs anticipate and manage colposcopy demand 
during the transition.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy on 
pulmonary function and the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in 
real-world non-small cell lung cancer patients.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of stage II-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer 
patients who received neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy across three medical 
institutions was conducted. Clinical data and perioperative outcomes were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 386 patients were screened and enrolled in the study cohort, 
and all patients underwent surgery after completing neoadjuvant 
chemoimmunotherapy. Postoperatively, 61 patients developed postoperative 
pulmonary complications, among whom 25 were diagnosed with checkpoint 
inhibitor-related pneumonia. The postoperative mortality rate was 2.8% (11/386), 
with all deaths attributed to severe postoperative checkpoint inhibitor-related 
pneumonia. The diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide tended to 
decrease after neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, with 39% of patients developing 
impaired pulmonary function post-treatment. After controlling for confounding 
variables via propensity score matching analysis, impaired pulmonary function 
after treatment was associated with postoperative pulmonary complications. 
Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that prior lung disease 
(odds ratio, [OR]: 1.63; 95% CI : 1.02-3.31, p = 0.037), impaired pulmonary 
function after treatment (OR: 2.78; 95% CI: 1.38-5.24, p < 0.001), lymph node 
metastasis (OR: 3.05; 95% CI: 1.65-6.21, p < 0.001), and elevated preoperative 
interleukin-6 levels (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.36-1.83, p < 0.001) were high risk 
factors for postoperative pulmonary complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Impaired pulmonary function after neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy is 
associated with the development of postoperative pulmonary complications. 
Post-treatment impaired pulmonary function, lymph node metastasis, prior lung 
disease, and elevated preoperative interleukin-6 levels are risk factors for 
postoperative pulmonary complications.

Technological breakthroughs in spatial omics and artificial intelligence (AI) 
have the potential to transform the understanding of cancer cells and the tumor 
microenvironment. Here we review the role of AI in spatial omics, discussing the 
current state-of-the-art and further needs to decipher cancer biology from 
large-scale spatial tissue data. An overarching challenge is the development of 
interpretable spatial AI models, an activity which demands not only improved 
data integration, but also new conceptual frameworks. We discuss emerging 
paradigms - in particular data-driven spatial AI, constraint-based spatial AI, 
and mechanistic spatial modeling - as well as the importance of integrating AI 
with hypothesis-driven strategies and model systems to realize the value of 
cancer spatial information.

IMPORTANCE: Cribriform prostate cancer is associated with poor outcomes; 
however, its optimal treatment strategy remains unclear in the absence of 
randomized data.
OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively analyze the results of the PROTECT randomized 
clinical trial to establish the association between cribriform-positive and 
cribriform-negative prostate cancer and 15-year risk of metastasis in patients 
who underwent active monitoring, surgery, or radiotherapy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between 1999 and 2009, the PROTECT phase 3 
randomized clinical trial enrolled 1643 men with clinically localized prostate 
cancer who were randomly assigned to receive active monitoring, surgery, or 
radiotherapy with neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). In this 
secondary analysis of the PROTECT trial, a centralized histopathologic review 
was conducted on available diagnostic biopsy slides to classify patients as 
cribriform-positive if they had invasive cribriform carcinoma and/or intraductal 
carcinoma. Data were collected from January 25, 2024, to October 11, 2024, and 
were analyzed from October 14, 2024, to January 30, 2025.
EXPOSURES: Age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, and cribriform 
status.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was progression to metastatic 
disease (bony, visceral, or lymph node metastases on imaging or PSA >100 ng/mL). 
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for 
randomization variables, were incorporated to assess 15-year metastasis risk. 
Cumulative incidence curves were compared using the Gray test. Both 
intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Among 712 men (mean [SD] age, 62.0 [5.0] years) whose biopsies were 
retrospectively reviewed, 93 (13.1%) had cribriform-positive disease and 42 
(5.9%) developed metastasis. In the intention-to-treat cohort, 
cribriform-positive disease significantly increased the risk of metastasis 
(hazard ratio [HR], 3.61 [95% CI, 1.60-8.11]; P = .003). Radiotherapy with 
neoadjuvant ADT significantly reduced metastasis risk (HR, 0.35 [95% CI, 
0.16-0.78]; P = .04) (15-year cumulative incidence in patients with 
cribriform-positive disease, 8%), while surgery delayed metastasis but did not 
significantly improve long-term outcomes compared with active monitoring (HR, 
0.52 [95% CI, 0.25-1.08]; P = .09) (15-year cumulative incidence in patients 
with cribriform-positive disease, 26% for surgery and 25% for active 
monitoring). Among patients with cribriform-negative disease, incidence of 
metastasis was low and did not differ by treatment. Similar per-protocol results 
were noted.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this secondary analysis of the 
PROTECT randomized clinical trial suggest that cribriform morphology was a 
strong, independent predictor of 15-year metastasis among patients with prostate 
cancer and that radiotherapy with neoadjuvant ADT was associated with a reduced 
long-term risk of metastasis. Conversely, outcomes were favorable for most 
patients with cribriform-negative disease, supporting their eligibility for 
active surveillance.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the survival difference between 2018 International 
Federation of Gynecology and Obsterics (FIGO) stage IIB cervical cancer (CC) 
patients with Unilateral parametrial invasion (UL) and Bilateral parametrial 
invasion (BL) disease and explore the significant role of parametrial invasion 
(PI) in prognosis prediction.
METHODS: A total of 506 stage IIB CC patients were identified from the 
multi-center study and patients were divided into UL and BL groups according to 
gynecological and radiological examination. Survival outcomes were estimated and 
compared between two groups before and after Propensity Scoring Matching (PSM). 
The role of upper 2/3 vaginal invasion (VI) in impacting survival probability 
was also assessed. The random forest (RF) model was constructed and validated to 
select important features related to survival outcomes and predict prognosis for 
these patients. The SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) was further introduced 
to provide better understanding towards the findings from RF model.
RESULTS: Significant better 5-year overall survival (OS) was observed among 
patients with UL disease whether before [BL : 61.7% (95%CI : 57.0%-66.4%); UL : 
84.8% (95%CI : 82.4%-87.2%); HR = 2.83, 95%CI : 1.90-4.20, P < 0.001] or after 
PSM [BL : 61.3% (95%CI : 56.6%-66.0%); UL : 81.2% (95%CI : 77.3%-85.1%); 
HR = 2.51, 95%CI : 1.56-4.04, P < 0.001]. Similar findings could also be 
observed in terms of progression free survival (PFS). The presence of VI didn't 
significantly impair the survival probability whether in UL or BL group (All 
P > 0.05). RF model was constructed, which possessed decent predictive ability 
both in the training (AUC = 0.893; 95%CI : 0.874-0.912) and validation cohort 
(AUC = 0.879; 95%CI : 0.801-0.957). PI was identified to be the paramount 
feature in affecting the survival outcomes for stage IIB CC patients through the 
Beeswarm summary plot and bar chart in SHAP analysis.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that 2018 FIGO stage IIB CC patients with 
BL disease had worse prognosis than those with UL disease and PI was the most 
significant feature in prognosis prediction for these patients.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate variables associated to not receiving adjuvant 
therapy in patients with resected pathological IB-IIIA NSCLC from a national 
registry.
METHODS: Patients who had lung resections were analyzed retrospectively for 
stages IB-III from 2009-2023, sourced from a multicentre registry. 
Uni/Multivariable logistic regression was performed, and a predictive tool was 
created to predict adjuvant therapy probability and cut-off values were 
determined through ROC analysis. The model's discrimination, performance and fit 
were evaluated using AUC-ROC, sensitivity/specificity and Hosmer-Lemeshow test 
respectively.
RESULTS: Of the 427 patients analyzed, the mean age was 65.4 years and 83.1% 
were treated under public insurance. 38.4% of patients received adjuvant 
chemotherapy after surgery. Multivariable analysis identified older age 
(OR = 1.06, p < 0.001), histological subtype (OR = 21.3, p < 0.001), public 
insurance (OR = 2.65, p = 0.006), stage I-B (OR = 8.10, p = 0.002), and negative 
lymph node status (OR = 3.34, p < 0.001) as independent factors associated with 
not receiving adjuvant therapy. Using the final equation, a calculated 
probability > 42.5% categorizes a patient for exclusive surgical intervention. 
The model's performance yielded an AUC of 0.833, with a sensitivity of 90.2%. 
The Hosmer-Lemeshow test resulted in a p ≥ 0.05.
CONCLUSIONS: Underutilization of adjuvant therapy in NSCLC is influenced by age, 
insurance type, and pathological factors. Public insurance status indicates 
healthcare access but does not fully capture social disparities. The absence of 
race, income, and geographic data limits broader analysis. Our model identifies 
patients at risk of treatment omission, aiding targeted interventions.

Cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM), which integrates active coping 
strategies, has been shown to enhance psychological adaptation in cancer 
survivors, resulting in reduced emotional distress and better quality of life. 
However, research on the impact of active coping in advanced cancer survivorship 
remains underexplored. This study examined whether active coping mediated the 
effects of CBSM on perceived stress among men with advanced prostate cancer 
(APC). APC survivors (N = 189) who had received androgen deprivation therapy 
(ADT) were randomized to a 10-week CBSM or a health promotion (HP) intervention 
and followed for one year. Structural equation modeling was used to test whether 
active coping mediated the effect of CBSM on perceived stress adjusting for 
relevant sociodemographic and clinical covariates, and to determine whether this 
mediating role was specific to the CBSM condition. CBSM predicted a decrease in 
perceived stress from baseline to 12 months post-baseline through active coping. 
As expected, this full mediating effect was observed only in patients who 
received CBSM. While active coping declined over time, CBSM appeared to have a 
buffer effect, helping to sustain coping compared to the control group. This may 
be particularly relevant for advanced cancer survivors, who often experience a 
general shift towards less coping over time, potentially due to psychological 
adaptation and increasing physical burdens. Findings suggest that sustaining 
active coping mechanisms through CBSM can contribute to reducing psychological 
stress and improving health-related quality of life in APC survivors. Future 
research should focus on optimizing interventions by tailoring coping strategies 
to the evolving needs of this population.

Metastatic cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, responsible 
for nearly 90% of deaths worldwide. Its progression depends on a multistep 
cascade involving invasion, vascular dissemination, survival in circulation and 
colonization of distant organs. This process is highly inefficient yet 
devastating, as a small fraction of tumor cells can establish lethal secondary 
lesions. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the biological 
complexities of metastasis, including tumor heterogeneity, chemoresistance and 
the tumor microenvironment. We further examine emerging diagnostic and 
therapeutic strategies, spanning molecular profiling, liquid biopsies, 
nanomedicine, immunotherapy and artificial intelligence. Targeted therapies 
toward inhibiting metastasis such as BRAF/MEK inhibitors have extended 
progression-free survival by 30-40% in melanoma trials, while checkpoint 
inhibitor combinations (PD-1 and CTLA-4) achieve response rates exceeding 50% in 
melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Liquid biopsy platforms enable real-time 
detection of resistance mutations, and nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems 
improve drug accumulation at tumor sites. Emerging tools such as organoids and 
tumor-on-a-chip models enhance predictive accuracy, while AI-driven analytics 
integrate multi-omics data to refine patient stratification. Integrating these 
innovations into next-generation clinical trials will require biomarker-driven 
patient selection, multi-center validation of assays and regulatory frameworks 
to accelerate approval. Together, these advances represent a transition toward 
personalized and adaptive care, offering the potential to redefine metastatic 
cancer as a manageable condition rather than a terminal diagnosis.

Beyond its established role as a lysine acetyltransferase, KAT2A has recently 
been identified to possess succinyltransferase activity. This study aims to 
investigate the function of KAT2A in mediating succinylation modification of 
heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) and to elucidate the underlying mechanism through 
which KAT2A regulates mitochondrial oxidative stress and ferroptosis induced by 
glucose starvation in colon cancer cells via HSP60 succinylation. Bioinformatic 
analyses were conducted to assess KAT2A expression in colon cancer and its 
association with patient prognosis. Protein interaction between KAT2A and HSP60 
was examined by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). Intracellular Fe²⁺ levels, lipid 
peroxidation, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) were measured 
using FerroOrange, C11 BODIPY 581/591, and MitoSOX Red fluorescent probes, 
respectively. Mitochondrial localization and membrane potential were evaluated 
via immunofluorescence assays. KAT2A is upregulated in colon cancer and 
correlates with poor prognosis, largely attributable to its ability to enhance 
cell viability and invasion under glucose deprivation. Overexpression of KAT2A 
conferred resistance to glucose starvation-induced ferroptosis by mediating 
HSP60 succinylation. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis identified three 
critical succinylation sites on HSP60 (K72, K133, K191), with K191 being the 
principal site regulating ferroptosis. Succinylated HSP60 interacts with GSTK1 
and promotes the mitochondrial translocation of the HSP60-GSTK1 complex, 
mitigating mitochondrial oxidative stress under glucose starvation. Through this 
mechanism, KAT2A suppresses ferroptosis and supports colon cancer cell survival 
and tumor growth. The KAT2A-HSP60-GSTK1 axis attenuates glucose 
starvation-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress, thereby inhibiting 
ferroptosis and promoting tumor progression in colon cancer.

Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) has been implicated in the development 
of colorectal cancer (CRC), yet its role in ferroptosis remains to be fully 
understood. In this study, we found that CPT1A expression was associated with 
metastasis of CRC by gene datasets analysis and immunohistochemical staining of 
clinical samples, and it was upregulated in CRC cells compared with normal colon 
cell. The CCK-8, Transwell, and wound healing assays demonstrated that 
overexpression of CPT1A enhanced the viability, invasion, and migratory capacity 
of CRC cells. CPT1A expression was reduced following induction of ferroptosis in 
CRC cells, and this downregulation could be reversed by a ferroptosis inhibitor. 
Moreover, CPT1A overexpression inhibited ferroptosis in CRC cells. Nrf2, a 
well-known negative regulator of ferroptosis, was found to colocalize with CPT1A 
in CRC cells. Molecular docking, Co-IP assay and Ch-IP assay further confirmed 
an interaction between CPT1A and Nrf2. Notably, Nrf2 overexpression upregulated 
CPT1A expression, whereas Nrf2 knockdown produced the opposite effect. CPT1A 
overexpression led to activation of PI3K/AKT pathway in CRC cells. Inactivation 
of the PI3K/AKT pathway by the inhibitor partially reversed the anti-ferroptosis 
effect of CPT1A overexpression. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K/AKT pathway 
suppressed Nrf2 expression, and reduce nuclear translocation of Nrf2, whereas 
activation of this pathway enhanced Nrf2 expression and nuclear translocation. 
In vivo experiments corroborated these findings, showing that CPT1A 
overexpression promoted Nrf2 expression, suppress ferroptosis, facilitated tumor 
growth, inactivated PI3K/AKT pathway. Taken together, our data suggest that 
CPT1A associates with metastasis of CRC, and inhibits ferroptosis through a 
regulatory feedback loop involving Nrf2 and PI3K/AKT pathway.

BACKGROUND: High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most aggressive 
ovarian cancer subtype, characterized by high recurrence, chemoresistance, and 
poor prognosis. Although competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks involving 
long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proposed as key regulators of tumor 
progression, their cell type-specific roles in HGSOC remain unclear.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify lncRNA-associated ceRNA networks active within 
the HGSOC tumor microenvironment.
METHODS: We performed an integrative analysis combining single-cell RNA 
sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq datasets. Cancer cells were isolated, 
and coexpression analyses were conducted using high-dimensional weighted gene 
coexpression network analysis. The resulting ceRNA modules were validated and 
functionally annotated using The Cancer Genome Atlas and pathway enrichment 
analysis.
RESULTS: Our analysis identified a cancer cell-specific ceRNA network involving 
MIR100HG, mir-224-5p, and EYA4. Interaction prediction and expression 
correlation analyses indicated that MIR100HG may function as a molecular sponge 
for mir-224-5p, thereby alleviating its suppression of EYA4. The presence of a 
7mer-m8 seed match between mir-224-5p and EYA4 supported this interaction. 
Pathway analysis suggested a link between the identified ceRNA network and the 
Wnt signaling pathway, a key driver of tumor initiation and metastasis.
CONCLUSION: The MIR100HG-mir-224-5p-EYA4 ceRNA network may promote tumor 
progression by modulating Wnt signaling. These findings offer insights into a 
potential posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism in tumor development and 
therapeutic targeting in HGSOC.

BACKGROUND: Accurate prediction of metachronous liver metastasis (MLM) within 
the 24 months remains a clinical challenge in rectal cancer. While radiomics 
offers noninvasive insights into tumor characteristics, few studies have 
investigated multi-sequence MRI-based habitat radiomics with interpretable 
modeling strategies.
METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 391 patients with pathologically 
confirmed rectal cancer. K-means clustering was applied to pretreatment 
T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) MRI to generate tumor 
subregions. Radiomic features were extracted from both sequences, and clinical 
variables were also included. Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were used 
to construct radiomics, habitat, and combined models. Model performance was 
assessed using area under the ROC curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA). 
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were employed to interpret the contribution 
of individual features.
RESULTS: The habitat model demonstrated superior predictive performance compared 
to conventional radiomics, achieving AUCs of 0.875 in the training cohort, 0.829 
in the internal validation cohort, and 0.810 in the external test cohort. The 
combined model, incorporating clinical variables and habitat features, achieved 
the highest performance in the validation cohort (AUC = 0.870) and external test 
cohort (AUC = 0.862). SHAP analysis revealed complementary contributions from 
T1WI and T2WI features, highlighting the intratumoral heterogeneity 
interpretability of the multi-sequence habitat approach.
CONCLUSION: Multi-sequence MRI-based habitat radiomics demonstrated strong 
performance in predicting MLM, and the integration with clinical variables 
further improved accuracy, providing a practical tool for individualized risk 
assessment and treatment planning.

Imaging-detected extranodal extension (iENE) is increasingly recognized as an 
objective adverse prognostic factor in head and neck cancer. The newly published 
9th edition of the UICC/AJCC TNM Classification now incorporates iENE into the 
nodal (N) categories for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, HPV-associated oropharyngeal 
carcinoma, and salivary gland carcinoma, typically upstaging patients to higher 
N categories, and designates imaging findings as an accepted standard for the 
clinical ENE (cENE) as the N3b category in all other head and neck subsites. To 
establish diagnostic criteria for iENE, the Head and Neck Cancer International 
Group (HNCIG) has proposed a four-tier grading system (2024): Grade 0 
(iENE-negative), Grade 1 (perinodal fat extension), Grade 2 (coalescent lymph 
nodes), and Grade 3 (invasion of adjacent structures). Each grade carries 
distinct clinical implications, ranging from treatment de-escalation for Grade 0 
to consideration of unresectable disease for Grade 3. Recent advances in 
ultra-high-resolution imaging, particularly photon-counting detector CT (PCD-CT) 
with 1024 × 1024 matrix in super-high-resolution (SHR) mode, may offer the 
spatial details necessary to more reliably detect these subtle findings compared 
with conventional imaging. Through direct comparisons with histopathological 
correlations, we demonstrate the potential of high-resolution imaging in 
detecting iENE. PCD-CT, with its simultaneous spectral imaging 
capabilities-including virtual monochromatic imaging-enhances soft tissue 
contrast for detecting subtle ENEs. In addition, material decomposition maps aid 
in the precise evaluation of tumor-tissue interfaces. This comprehensive review 
is an educational resource for radiologists applying the HNCIG consensus 
criteria including the newly adopted TNM staging requirements. While advanced 
imaging technologies such as PCD-CT show promising potential for enhanced tissue 
characterization, further validation studies are needed to establish their 
clinical utility in routine iENE assessment.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common cancer and a leading 
cause of cancer-related death. Peritoneal metastases occur in up to 25% of 
patients, with nearly half developing malignant ascites (MA), which arises from 
lymphatic obstruction, vascular permeability, and immune dysregulation. Median 
overall survival (OS) in this setting is poor (2-8 months). This systematic 
review and meta-analysis evaluate the prognostic impact of ascites in metastatic 
GC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were searched for studies 
reporting OS in metastatic GC patients with and without ascites. Hazard ratios 
(HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed and 
random-effects models in RStudio 4.2.3.
RESULTS: Overall, 14 studies involving 2179 patients, with 1208 having ascites, 
were included in the analysis. Of these, 13 were retrospective studies and 1 was 
a prospective study. The presence of ascites was associated with a significantly 
worse prognosis compared to its absence (HR 1.8418; 95% CI 1.5657-2.1667; 
P < 0.001). Similarly, the comparison of massive type ascites with mild to 
moderate type shows a worse outcome for the higher grade of ascites (HR 1.8597; 
95% CI 1.4633-2.3635; P < 0.001). Comparing no to moderate ascites vs massive 
ascites, the massive type also shows a significantly lower overall survival (HR 
2.5114; 95% CI 1.5409-4.0931; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that the presence of ascites and its 
grades are essential prognostic factors for metastatic gastric cancer, 
significantly worsening overall survival.

This study aimed to examine the level of spiritual experience and the impact of 
socio-demographic and clinical features, anxiety and depression, and spiritual 
well-being on the spiritual experiences of hospitalized patients with 
gynecological cancer. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 192 patients 
in a university-affiliated hospital in the west of Turkey. The participants 
completed self-assessment tools, including the Daily Spiritual Experience Scale, 
the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy--Spiritual Well-Being 
Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. According to the results 
of the hierarchical linear regression analysis, the statistically significant 
factors affecting spiritual experience among patients with gynecologic cancer 
were age (β = -.219), anxiety (β = .208), depression (β = .172), and faith 
(β = -.312). Meaning and peace subdimensions of spiritual well-being were not 
found to be a significant predictor of spiritual experience. This indicates that 
when the subdimensions contaminating the construct of spiritual well-being are 
removed, the faith subdimension predicts spiritual experience more strongly. 
Gynecological cancer patients may have spiritual issues, so health professionals 
should provide spiritual support.

BACKGROUND: Immediate dental implant placement with implant-supported prostheses 
enables single-stage functional and aesthetic rehabilitation during jaw 
reconstruction, a technique referred to as ""Jaw in a Day®"" (JIAD). This study 
evaluated the feasibility of the JIAD technique combined with retroauricular 
robot-assisted neck dissection (RA-RAND) in patients with oral cancer undergoing 
mandibular reconstruction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 75 patients who underwent 
mandibular reconstruction using fibula free flaps from September 2020 to 
February 2024. Among them, 31 patients were eligible for analysis. Seven 
patients had retroauricular robot-assisted neck dissection (RA-RAND), and 24 
patients had conventional transcervical neck dissection (CTND). Two patients in 
the RA-RAND group and nine in the CTND group underwent the JIAD procedure. We 
compared the time from data acquisition to surgery, reconstruction time, total 
operation time, and length of hospital stay between the groups.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between the RA-RAND and CTND 
groups in terms of reconstruction time (median 431 min, IQR 274-442 vs. 310 min, 
IQR 236-420; p = 0.435) or hospital stay (median 20 days, IQR 17-22 vs. 20 days, 
IQR 18-33; p = 0.275), although the total operation time was significantly 
longer in the RA-RAND group (median 831 min, IQR 702-898 vs. 526 min, IQR 
444-615; p = 0.002). Within the RA-RAND cohort, there were no significant 
differences between the JIAD and non-JIAD groups regarding time from data 
acquisition to surgery (median 17.5 days, IQR 14.2-20.8 vs. 13.0 days, IQR 
8.0-24.0; p = 1.000), reconstruction time (median 352.5 min, IQR 311.2-393.8 vs. 
431.0 min, IQR 278.0-450.0; p = 0.857), total operation time (median 863.5 min, 
IQR 847.2-879.8 vs. 701.5 min, IQR 649.0-751.5; p = 0.857), or length of 
hospital stay (median 18.5 days, IQR 15.2-21.8 vs. 20.0 days, IQR 18.0-22.0; 
p = 0.762).
CONCLUSION: Based on this case series and comparative analysis, the combination 
of the JIAD technique with RA-RAND appears technically feasible and does not 
prolong the operative or postoperative course. However, larger studies are 
required to confirm these findings.

Cancer treatments might lead to several long-term effects. In this work we 
investigate their causal role on ischemic heart disease and their potential 
precursors (i.e. hypertension and dyslipidemia) of the ovarian suppression 
therapy in adolescent and young adult (AYA) breast cancer (BC) survivors. 
Additionally, we assess the external validity of our findings through 
comparative analysis of regional data. We take advantage of a causal network 
model that leverage on observational data on 1-year AYA BC survivors living the 
Lombardy region in Italy. Using a structural causal model (SCM) and 
counterfactual analysis within Pearl's causal inference framework, we estimate 
the Average Causal Effect (ACE), Probability of Necessity (PN), and Probability 
of Sufficiency (PS) for the cause-effect relationships. Data of a regional 
cohort of AYA BC patients living in the Veneto region were used to externally 
validate results. Ovarian suppression was found to be a necessary but not 
sufficient cause for ischemic heart disease (PN > 97.8%; PS < 1.97%). While PN 
is high for both hypertension and dyslipidemia, PS varied suggesting ovarian 
suppression alone could induce hypertension in about 30% of cases but was rarely 
sufficient for dyslipidemia onset. External validation confirmed the robustness 
of findings across regions. Our experimental results may be of interest for 
clinicians who aim at personalizing the follow-up of AYA BC survivors, with 
particular attention to be paid in monitoring the hypertension onset or in its 
prevention. The study demonstrates the value of counterfactual reasoning and 
causal inference when working with real-world data.

Cancer and its treatment predispose to thromboembolic complications and 
thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia does not protect against thromboembolism, but 
increases the risk of bleeding. The prognosis in venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
strictly depends on the efficacy of anticoagulation. The choice of 
anticoagulation strategy will depend on the severity of thrombocytopenia and its 
expected duration. Thrombotic risk is also important, determining the risk of 
death related to pulmonary embolism and the risk of recurrence/progression of 
VTE. Possible strategies include full anticoagulation and possible platelet 
transfusions, modification of the anticoagulation dose or interruption of 
anticoagulation. The review focuses on the possibilities of VTE treatment in the 
aspect of clinically significant thrombocytopenia with a platelet count below 
50 × 109/L (50 000/µl).

OBJECTIVES: Recent advances in therapeutics have substantially improved breast 
cancer treatment outcomes. However, data on prognostic factors after surgical 
resection of pulmonary metastases from breast cancer remain limited.
METHODS: This single-center retrospective study analyzed data from patients with 
breast cancer who had undergone pulmonary metastasectomy between 2000 and 2023. 
We reviewed clinical and pathological parameters, including the disease-free 
interval (DFI), size and number of pulmonary metastases.
RESULTS: This study included 33 patients. The median postoperative survival of 
breast cancer patients with lung metastasis was 40 (range 4-217) months. 
According to univariate analysis, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, 
pStage I or II breast cancer, lung metastases < 20 mm, hormone receptor-positive 
lung metastases, absence of other metastases, and DFI ≥ 24 months were 
significantly associated with better survival. Multivariate analysis identified 
DFI < 24 months (hazard ratio [HR] 9.520, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
2.158-27.070) and tumor size ≥ 20 mm (HR 4.958, 95% CI 1.290-27.550) 
independently predicted poorer survival; ≥ 2 metastatic lesions showed 
a non-significant trend toward worse outcomes (HR 3.272, 95% CI 0.913-11.090).
CONCLUSIONS: This study clarified the criteria for pulmonary metastasectomy in 
patients with breast cancer. Considering subtype changes between the primary 
tumor and metastases could enable personalized therapies.

Although outcomes of laparoscopic and robotic-assisted proctectomy have been 
compared, the superiority of one approach over another was not proven. We used 
the target trial methodology to emulate a randomized clinical trial comparing 
laparoscopic and robotic-assisted proctectomy for rectal cancer. Data from the 
NCDB (2015-2021) on patients with stage II-III rectal adenocarcinoma were 
collected. Patients were divided into two groups: laparoscopic proctectomy (LP) 
and robotic-assisted proctectomy (RP). The groups were matched for baseline 
patient and treatment confounders to obtain balanced groups, emulating the 
design of a randomized trial. The primary outcome was the pathologic outcomes of 
each surgical approach, including the status of circumferential resection 
margins (CRM), surgical margins, and number of examined lymph nodes. Secondary 
outcomes included conversion to open surgery, hospital stay, and 30- and 90-day 
mortality. After matching, 5631 patients were included in each group. The RP and 
LP groups had similar rates of positive CRM (10.5% vs. 9.4%, p = 0.072), 
positive surgical margins (6% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.528), examined lymph nodes number 
(median: 15 vs. 15, p = 0.105), 30-day mortality (0.7% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.405), 
90-day mortality (1.5% vs. 1.8%, p = 0.333), and unplanned 30-day readmission 
(6.6% vs. 6.2%, p = 0.477). RP was associated with shorter hospital stay 
(median: 4 vs. 5 days, p < 0.001) and lower rate of conversion to open surgery 
(5.8% vs. 13.6%, OR: 0.39, 95%CI 0.34-0.45, p < 0.001). This target trial found 
RP and LP for rectal cancer associated with similar clinical and pathologic 
outcomes. RP was associated with fewer conversions and shorter hospital stays 
than LP.

BACKGROUND: Indocyanine green (ICG) lymphangiography for colon cancer has been 
regarded as a sentinel lymph node (LN) detection tool, but its repeatedly 
reported suboptimal sensitivity rates suggest that approach aiming to define 
locoregional lymphatic collector margins might be more efficient in guiding 
surgeon's decision making. Thus, present study was designed to determine if 
sensitivity of the latter approach is sufficient to guide resection margins' 
selection in colon cancer surgery.
METHODS: This is a prospective, single-centre, single-arm phase II 
interventional trial, including patients with histologically confirmed colon 
adenocarcinoma. ICG was injected subserosally in the beginning of operation, 
fluorescence was assessed 30 min after injection or later, when it became 
detectable. Primary endpoint was proportion of pN + patients in whom all 
metastatic lymph nodes were located within the area of fluorescence of 
lymphatics (AFL). Secondary endpoints included feasibility, safety, lymphatic 
spread patterns and proportion of resections modified based on ICG mapping.
RESULTS: Between 26 July 2022 and 27 February 2024, 101 patients underwent 
colectomies with intraoperative ICG lymphatic mapping. AFL was registered in all 
cases. Average lateral spread was 5.87 ± 3.20 proximally and 5.89 ± 2.54 cm 
distally. In two of 46 pN + cases affected LNs were discovered beyond AFL. ICG 
lymphatic mapping sensitivity was found to be 95.6%, which was beyond 
0.960-0.990 interval, so null hypothesis was retained.
CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, metastatic LNs were confined within ICG AFL in 95.6% 
of pN + cases. Although the predefined sensitivity threshold was not met, the 
result suggests potential for ICG mapping to guide resection margins in colon 
cancer surgery.

BACKGROUND: Ginger contains many biocompounds, but the antiproliferative effects 
of its phenylalkanoids (such as 
1-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-5-methoxydecan-3-one (HMPM)) on cancer cells are 
rarely reported. This study aims to explore the antiproliferative effects and 
mechanisms of HMPM on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells.
METHODS: ATP-based viability, flow cytometry, and Western blotting were 
conducted to explore the anti-TNBC in vitro effects and mechanisms.
RESULTS: HMPM inhibits the proliferation of several breast cancer cell lines. 
Two TNBC cell lines (Hs578T and MDA-MB-231), showing the highest sensitivity to 
HMPM, exhibited oxidative stress-dependent antiproliferation, as validated by 
N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Regarding flow cytometry, HMPM changes cell cycle 
distribution; upregulates apoptosis (annexin V), reactive oxygen species, and 
mitochondrial oxidative stress; and downregulates mitochondrial membrane 
potential and glutathione to a greater extent in TNBC cells than in normal 
breast cells (H184B5F5/M10), attenuated by NAC. Regarding flow cytometry and 
Western blotting, HMPM notably triggers oxidative stress-mediated caspase 3 and 
8 activation in TNBC cells compared to M10 cells. Finally, HMPM causes oxidative 
DNA damage, as indicated by γH2AX and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine flow cytometry.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, the ginger-derived HMPM offers antiproliferative 
activity against TNBC cells via oxidative stress-dependent changes with limited 
cytotoxicity to normal cells.

PURPOSE: The use of systematic biopsies (SB) in patients with suspicion of upper 
tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) has not been explored. Our objective is to 
investigate the safety of SB and its impact on the management of UTUC.
METHODS: We included patients who underwent diagnostic ureteroscopy 
(URS) ± ablation treatment and SB for UTUC at our institution (2015-2022). SB 
consisted of a minimum of two biopsies in renal pelvis, proximal, medium, and 
distal ureter. Complications were graded using Clavien-Dindo classification. The 
impact of SB on oncological outcomes was assessed through Kaplan-Meier curves 
and Cox regression analysis. Logistic regressions were used to assess predictors 
of positive SB.
RESULTS: Overall, 50/101 (50%) patients had positive SB. Overall and major 
complications were 19 (19%) and 4 (4%), respectively. SB detected UTUC in 8/16 
(50%) and 18/23 (78%) patients with negative/nondiagnostic and positive target 
biopsy, respectively. In 8/25 (32%) distal ureteral tumors, SB detected CIS in 
other upper tract portions. Patients with positive SB were more frequently 
treated with radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) (2-yr RNU-FS rates 87.7% vs. 
53.5%, p < 0.001). SB was an independent predictor of RNU-FS [HR 3.38 (95%CI 
1.46-7.80); p = 0.004]. History of CIS [OR 1.26 (95%CI 1.06-1.91), p = 0.04] and 
tumors ≥ 2 cm [OR 1.32 (95%CI 1.09-1.78), p = 0.04] were independent predictors 
of SB positivity. Limitations include the single-center, retrospective design of 
the study.
CONCLUSIONS: The integration of SB into the diagnostic workup of UTUC is safe 
and feasible. It may drive the treatment choice in high-risk patients.

Microsatellite instability (MSI), detected via immunohistochemistry and/or 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), is a hallmark for Lynch syndrome and a 
prognostic marker in colorectal cancer. While MSI status is assessed using 
immunohistochemistry on archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, 
interpretation can be challenging due to preanalytical variability, antigen 
decay, and observer subjectivity. PCR-based methods, like the Idylla system, 
offer a rapid automated alternative with minimal hands-on time and no 
requirement for specialized molecular facilities. We evaluated Idylla's 
performance on archival (≥ 10 years old) FFPE colorectal cancer resections by 
comparing BRAF and MSI analysis results with immunohistochemistry for DNA 
mismatch repair (MMR) proteins and previously performed PCR MSI (Pentaplex) and 
BRAF genotyping assays. MSI concordance was 94.3% (50/53) between Idylla and 
immunohistochemistry, and 98.1% (52/53) between Idylla and PCR. Two discordant 
samples were classified as MSI-high by Idylla and PCR, whereas 
immunohistochemistry showed normal MMR expression. Conversely, the third 
discordant sample was classified as microsatellite stable by Idylla and PCR, 
while immunohistochemistry indicated deficient MMR expression. For BRAF 
genotyping, concordance between Idylla and PCR was 92.7% (38/41). In two 
discordant samples, BRAF variants identified by PCR were not included in the 
Idylla panel, while the third discordant sample showed a pathogenic BRAF variant 
by Idylla not confirmed by PCR. This is the largest study evaluating Idylla on 
archival FFPE material. High concordance with traditional methods suggests that 
Idylla can be used as an alternative approach for Lynch syndrome screening, 
improving accessibility and reliability of MSI and BRAF testing in challenging 
archival specimens.

BACKGROUND: Keratinocyte skin cancers (KC), including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) 
and the spectrum of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), represent the most common 
malignancies worldwide. Accurate diagnosis and margin assessment are critical 
for optimal treatment but remain challenging when relying solely on clinical and 
dermoscopic evaluation. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) offers 
high-resolution, noninvasive imaging of skin architecture at near-histological 
levels, potentially improving diagnostic precision and reducing the need for 
(re)biopsies.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the current diagnostic criteria, diagnostic utility, 
advantages, and limitations of confocal microscopy in the assessment of 
nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC).
METHODS: A narrative review of recent literature and current guidelines was 
conducted, focusing on RCM for the detection, characterization, and monitoring 
of BCC and KC. Key diagnostic criteria, imaging protocols, and clinical 
applications were analyzed, including preoperative mapping, differentiation from 
benign lesions, and follow-up after treatment.
RESULTS: RCM provides real-time visualization of tumor architecture, cellular 
morphology, and vascular patterns, facilitating the identification of hallmark 
features such as basaloid tumor islands in BCC and keratinocyte atypia in SCC. 
Studies report improved diagnostic accuracy and reduced rates of unnecessary 
excisions. Limitations include restricted imaging depth and the requirement for 
operator expertise.
CONCLUSION: RCM represents a powerful adjunct to conventional diagnostic methods 
for NMSC. Its ability to deliver high-resolution, noninvasive imaging enhances 
diagnostic confidence, supports surgical planning, and aids in treatment 
monitoring, ultimately improving patient care. Combining multiple noninvasive 
techniques with proper training is key to enhancing this approach and promoting 
its routine clinical use.

Publisher: ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: HINTERGRUND: Keratinozytäre Hauttumoren 
einschließlich des Basalzellkarzinoms (BCC) und des Plattenepithelkarzinoms 
(SCC) sind die weltweit häufigsten malignen Hauterkrankungen. Eine präzise 
Diagnostik und Tumorrandbeurteilung ist essenziell, bleibt jedoch allein mit 
klinischer und dermatoskopischer Untersuchung manchmal herausfordernd. Die 
konfokale Lasermikroskopie (KLM) bietet eine nahezu histologische, nichtinvasive 
Darstellung epidermaler und oberflächlich dermaler Strukturen und kann die 
diagnostische Präzision verbessern sowie (Re‑)Biopsien reduzieren. ZIEL: 
Dargestellt werden die aktuellen diagnostischen Kriterien, Vorteile, 
Limitationen und klinischen Anwendungen von KLM bei nichtmelanozytärem Hautkrebs 
(NMSC).
METHODEN: Es handelt sich um eine narrative Übersichtsarbeit aktueller Literatur 
und Leitlinien zu KLM für Detektion, Differenzierung, Subtypisierung und 
Verlaufskontrolle von BCC und Keratinozytenkarzinomen (KC). Klinische 
Anwendungen umfassen präoperative Randkontrolle, Abgrenzung von benignen 
Läsionen und Nachsorge.
ERGEBNISSE: KLM ermöglicht die Echtzeitvisualisierung von Tumorarchitektur, 
zellulärer Morphologie und Gefäßmustern. Typische Merkmale wie basaloide 
Tumornester bei BCC und Keratinozytenatypien bei aktinischen Keratosen (AK), 
Morbus Bowen (MB) und SCC können identifiziert werden. Studien zeigen eine 
höhere diagnostische Genauigkeit, weniger unnötige Exzisionen und eine bessere 
Abgrenzung der Resektionsränder v. a. bei BCC und AK. Limitationen bestehen in 
der geringen Bildtiefe, bei SCC sowie im Bedarf an standardisierten 
Befundungsprotokollen und Schulung.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: KLM steigert die diagnostische Sicherheit, unterstützt die 
Operationsplanung und ermöglicht eine nichtinvasive Verlaufskontrolle der NMSC 
und ist somit ein wertvolles Instrument zur Verbesserung der 
Patientenversorgung. Die Kombination mehrerer nichtinvasiver Techniken mit 
angemessenem Training ist entscheidend, um die routinemäßige Anwendung in der 
klinischen Praxis zu fördern.

The implementation of robotic surgery represents a major advance for oncological 
surgical care, particularly in public health systems, but requires robust 
training and proctorship for established surgeons. To assess surgeon performance 
and clinical outcomes following a structured, proctored training program for 
robotic surgery in a Brazilian public cancer hospital. This prospective, 
randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02292914, 
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02292914 ) recruited 564 cancer patients 
(2014-2020) for either robotic (n = 326) or control (laparoscopic/open, n = 238) 
procedures. Sixteen surgeons (> 10 years oncology experience) underwent a 
standardized four-stage laboratory and perioperative proctored curriculum. 
Outcomes included operative duration, blood loss, lymph node yield, and 
intraoperative complications. Data were analyzed in IBM-SPSS v20.0 (chi-square, 
Fisher's exact, Mann-Whitney, paired t-test, GEE; p < 0.05). All surgeons 
completed the laboratory curriculum; eight met full operative certification 
criteria. Robotic procedures took longer than controls (mean 304.9 vs 259.1 min; 
p < 0.001), with significantly less blood loss (mean 266.2 vs 598.2 mL; 
p < 0.001). Lymph node yields and complication rates did not differ. Operative 
durations decreased with experience. Structured, proctored training enabled safe 
transition to robotic surgery in this high-volume public cancer center. The 
model is scalable and adaptable to other institutions and innovations in public 
hospitals.

Prostate cancer ranks as the second most prevalent malignancy among men, with 
its progression predominantly driven by androgen receptor (AR) signaling. 
Despite the centrality of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in managing 
advanced prostate cancer, the emergence of resistance culminating in 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains a formidable challenge. In 
this study, an integrative strategy for virtual screening was developed using a 
machine learning-based model implemented with Random Forest, followed by 
molecular docking. This strategy was employed to screen approximately 1,500,000 
compounds, ultimately narrowing them down to 20 candidates. Among these, 
8020-1599 and C301-6562 were identified as effective AR inhibitors. In vitro 
assays demonstrated that these compounds significantly inhibited the 
proliferation, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cells, exhibiting 
efficacy comparable to that of the clinical standard, enzalutamide. In vivo 
experiments further validated their antitumor activity, demonstrating 
significant tumor growth inhibition without causing notable toxicity. 
Mechanistically, 8020-1599 and C301-6562 disrupted AR nuclear translocation and 
its downstream signaling pathways, leading to a marked reduction in the 
expression of AR-regulated genes FKBP5 and KLK3. This study highlights a 
promising approach for developing highly effective and minimally toxic AR 
inhibitors, although further research is required to assess their long-term 
safety and potential effects on alternative signaling pathways.

BACKGROUND: Inferior rectal cancer, a malignancy occurring in the lower portion 
of the rectum, represents a significant clinical challenge due to its complex 
anatomical location and the diverse treatment approaches required for optimal 
patient outcomes. Over the past few decades, advancements in surgical 
techniques, radiotherapy, and systemic treatments have contributed to improving 
survival rates and minimizing morbidity associated with this disease.
AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: Neoadjuvant therapy combined with tumor resection surgery 
has demonstrated significant improvements in survival in patients with rectal 
cancer. However, uncertainty persists due to variability in therapeutic 
responses among different groups of patients and the limited availability of 
long-term data on the efficacy of pathologic responses. These limitations affirm 
the need for further studies to optimize and personalize the therapeutic 
approach to rectal cancer.
DATA SOURCES: A search for information was conducted using recognized databases, 
including Cochrane, PubMed, Scielo, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. The search 
strategy was designed using specific terms such as: ""rectal neoplasms"" OR 
(""rectal AND neoplasms"") OR ""rectal cancer"" AND (""therapeutics"" OR 
""treatments""), to identify relevant publications.
THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: Minimally invasive techniques offer oncologic outcomes 
equivalent to open surgery with faster recovery and lower morbidity, supported 
by total neoadjuvant therapy, which has become the standard of care for locally 
advanced rectal cancer, achieving higher pathologic complete response rates (OR 
2.44, 95% CI, 1.99-2.98) and longer disease-free survival (OR 2.07, 95% CI, 
1.20-3.56) than conventional chemoradiotherapy. In addition, emerging targeted 
agents (VEGF and EGFR inhibitors) in molecularly selected patients and PD-1 
blockade in dMMR tumors further improve response rates and support organ 
preservation strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite notable advances in treatment strategies for rectal cancer, 
challenges remain in identifying a therapeutic modality that can improve both 
overall survival and disease-free survival without exposing the patient to 
overly aggressive interventions.

Azores, Portugal.

BACKGROUND: The patterns of care for patients with advanced cancer in the last 
week of life are critical for ensuring quality and dignity during a vulnerable 
time. As patients approach end of life, the focus typically shifts from 
aggressive treatment to palliative care, emphasizing comfort and symptom 
management. The term ""non-comfortoriented care"" describes a set of medical 
interventions and treatments that prioritize prolonging life. This can lead to 
increased physical discomfort, emotional burden, or reduced quality of life.
AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: For those who die in a medical setting, end-of-life care 
practices vary greatly and the care can be either comfort-oriented or 
noncomfort-oriented. There is a need for a clear overview of patterns for 
end-of-life care for patients with advanced cancer.
DATA SOURCES: Based on Whittemore's integrative review method, comprehensive 
searches were conducted in PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar 
databases. Population/Patient, Exposure, and Outcome format was used to 
formulate a research review question.
THERAPEUTICS ADVANCES: Twenty-four articles were included. The key components of 
the patterns of care implemented during the last week of life are settings, 
palliative care involvement, intensity of therapeutics interventions, duration, 
and planning in advance. The only setting where solely comfort-oriented care was 
delivered was the community. In hospital settings, both comfort and 
noncomfort-oriented care were offered. Palliative care involvement was 
associated with comfort-oriented care, early recognition of dying (median 6 
days), medication rationalizing, and implementation of care pathways. 
Noncomfort-oriented care patterns occurred in emergency departments, oncology, 
and general wards in acute hospitals with late recognition of dying (median 2 
days) and use of inappropriate therapeutics interventions.
CONCLUSION: To deliver the best care in the last week of life, new strategies 
are necessary to guide the clinical practices and to ensure patient-centered 
care.

BackgroundEstablishing benchmarks for extravasation incidences with systemic 
anti-cancer therapy from various global regions is crucial. Reliable data can 
inform practices aimed at reducing both the occurrence and severity of 
extravasation events.MethodsThis prospective observational study evaluated 
extravasation incidences in patients receiving systemic anti-cancer therapy for 
solid tumors at a tertiary oncology daycare center over a period of 15 months. 
Multiple risk factors potentially contributing to extravasation and influencing 
its severity were systematically recorded and analyzed.ResultsOut of 66,540 
infusions, a total of 58 extravasation cases were identified, resulting in an 
overall incidence of 0.087%. The extravasation incidence was 0.13% for vesicant 
drugs and 0.045% for irritant drugs. Specifically, DNA-binding vesicants had an 
incidence of 0.2%, while non-DNA binding vesicants had an incidence of 0.11%. 
The predominant symptom reported was infusion site swelling (86%), followed by 
pain (43%) and erythema (36%). Grade 3 extravasation occurred in 13 cases 
(22.4%), with vesicants responsible for all but one event. Median symptom 
resolution time was 20 days overall, extending to 40 days in grade 3 cases. 
Notably, the occurrence of symptoms either during infusion or within 6 h 
post-infusion significantly correlated with milder grade 1 extravasations, lower 
incidence of severe grade 3 cases, and quicker symptom resolution within three 
weeks.ConclusionsDaycare oncology centers should implement standardized 
protocols for systemic therapy administration, emphasizing preventive strategies 
and prompt identification and management of extravasation to reduce associated 
morbidity.

BACKGROUND: The link between mesenteric panniculitis (MP) and cancer is debated. 
We explored this association after adjusting for age.
MATERIALS & METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed abdominal CT scans of 8,750 
patients between 2015 and 2017. Patients were categorized by cancer status.
RESULTS: Of included patients, 8.7% had cancer. MP was found in 148 patients 
(58% males, mean age 57.8 years). MP was more frequent in cancer patients 
(5.14%) compared to no-cancer group (1.36%). Among MP patients, breast cancer 
was the most common malignancy. After adjusting for age, MP remained 
significantly associated with breast cancer and multiple myeloma in females and 
lymphoma in males.
CONCLUSION: MP was significantly associated with breast cancer and multiple 
myeloma in females and lymphoma in males.

Plain Language Summary: Our study investigated the connection between mesenteric 
panniculitis (MP), a fatty tissue inflammation in the abdomen, and cancer. We 
looked at CT scan data from 8,750 patients. The results showed that MP was more 
common in people with cancer than those without it. Even after accounting for 
age, the link between MP and certain cancers was still strong. Particularly, MP 
was associated with breast cancer and multiple myeloma in women, and lymphoma in 
men.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies globally, with 
chemotherapy remaining a cornerstone treatment for advanced and metastatic 
cases. However, traditional chemotherapy is limited by poor targeting, low 
bioavailability, and systemic toxicity, necessitating the development of precise 
chemotherapy strategies. Nanotechnology has emerged as a promising platform to 
address these limitations by enabling targeted drug delivery. This review 
systematically synthesizes advancements in nanotechnology-based drug delivery 
systems and their targeting strategies, emphasizing their application in 
prostate cancer therapy. Active targeting approaches leverage cell membrane 
receptors, such as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), folate receptor, 
transferrin receptor, and CD44, as biomarkers. Corresponding ligands, including 
PSMA ligands, folate derivatives, transferrin, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin 
sulfate, and DUP-1, are used to modify nanocarriers, conferring precise 
targeting capabilities to loaded chemotherapeutics. Additionally, bioinspired 
strategies employing cell membrane encapsulation and magnetic field-guided 
delivery are discussed. Meanwhile, the review comprehensively summarizes the 
research advancements of nanodelivery systems in combination therapy involving 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, immunotherapy, and other 
modalities. Through a categorized analysis of the developments and challenges of 
these nanotechnologies, this review intends to furnish references and new 
orientations for the research and application of precise chemotherapy in 
prostate cancer.

KIAA1199 (also known as CEMIP or HYBID), an archived gene listed in the Human 
Unidentified Gene-Encoded (HUGE) database, has been implicated in tumor 
progression and metastasis in a wide range of cancers, including breast, 
cervical, cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic, colorectal, gastric, hepatocellular, 
lung, ovarian, prostate, papillary thyroid, and brain cancers. Overexpression of 
KIAA1199 is significantly correlated with poor prognosis and metastasis and has 
been clinically associated with chemoresistance. In addition, KIAA1199 may serve 
as a novel biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, particularly due to its 
role in maintaining cancer stem cell properties. However, the molecular 
mechanisms by which KIAA1199 regulates chemoresistance, prognosis, and cancer 
stem cell development remain incompletely understood. Therefore, this review 
aims to summarize the clinical relevance of KIAA1199 as a novel regulator 
involved in chemoresistance, cancer prognosis, and cancer stem cell biology.

The high rate of lung cancer and related deaths necessitated new treatment 
strategies. This study aimed at in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo evaluation of 
magnetic field sensitive, ultrasound-mediated, and pemetrexed and pazopanib 
containing nanobubble (NB) destruction to provide dual drug therapy against 
non-small cell lung cancer. For this purpose, cytotoxicity analysis (CRL-5807, 
CRL-5826, A549-Luc-C8), biocompatibility experiments including 
hemocompatibility, uptake by macrophages, and binding to serum proteins, acute 
and long-term toxicity analyses, in vivo therapeutic efficacy experiments, 
pharmacokinetic analyses, histochemistry, and immunohistochemistry experiments 
were performed on NBs. The IC50 value of NB-400 against A549-Luc-C8 was found to 
be 31.4 ± 1.6 μg/mL and 34.9 ± 1.2 μg/mL with and without ultrasound application 
for 72 h, respectively. 30.8% of NB-400 was phagocytosed by macrophage cells and 
was non-hemolytic. It was determined that NB-800 (prepared for inhaler 
administration) and NB-400 did not cause acute or long-term toxic effects and 
reduced tumor size and/or disappeared after treatment, but carrier-free dual 
drugs did not give a therapeutic response also based on immunohistochemical 
analyses. It can be said that the emerging intravenous and inhaled delivery 
systems can be potential therapeutics that can be used in the treatment of 
non-small cell lung cancer with superior properties such as magnetic targeting 
and ultrasound sensitivity.

The optimal number of systemic chemotherapies for total neoadjuvant therapy 
(TNT) in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) is controversial. This 
retrospective study, conducted at Fujian Medical University Union Hospital from 
January 2018 to April 2024, compared the efficacy and safety of TNT with 
radiotherapy plus six cycles of CAPOX (CAPOX-6, n = 105) versus four cycles of 
CAPOX (CAPOX-4, n = 124) in 229 patients with LARC. The CAPOX-6 group achieved a 
significantly higher complete response (CR) rate (53.3% vs. 28.2%, p <.001) and 
pathological complete remission rate (55.1% vs. 28.3%, p <.001) compared to the 
CAPOX-4 group. The CAPOX-6 group had higher anal preservation rates (95.9% vs. 
85.8%, p = .01) and lower enterostomy rates (59.2% vs. 89.2%, p <.001). 
Furthermore, the CAPOX-6 group had a higher proportion of less invasive 
transanal local excision (35.7% vs. 4.2%, p <.001) and lower postoperative 
complications (12.2% vs. 23.3%, p = .04). The 2-year DFS was similar (79% for 
CAPOX-6 vs. 75.9% for CAPOX-4, p = .92), but the 2-year recurrence rate was 
significantly lower in patients achieving CR (4.2% vs. 36.7% in non-CR, p 
<.001). Multivariate analysis identified six cycles of CAPOX and EMVI negative 
as independent predictors of CR. Grade 3-4 adverse events were comparable (36% 
vs. 28%, p = .2), with higher grade 1-2 leukopenia, neutropenia, and 
neurotoxicity in the CAPOX-6 group. The study concludes that TNT with 
radiotherapy plus six cycles of CAPOX is a preferred treatment strategy for 
LARC, particularly when prioritizing organ preservation and quality of life.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is now recommended for primary screening for 
invasive cervical cancer (ICC) among women. We evaluated same-day completion of 
an HPV screen-triage-treat algorithm consisting of: (1) GeneXpert high-risk HPV 
testing of self-collected vaginal samples, (2) visual inspection with acetic 
acid (VIA) and colposcopy for HPV+ women, and (3) thermal ablation (TA) 
treatment for HPV+ women with acetowhite cervical lesions eligible for TA by 
colposcopy, in Lilongwe, Malawi. We calculated same-day completion rates of the 
screening algorithm as the proportion of: (a) HPV+ women who had VIA the same 
day, and (b) HPV+ women with ablation-eligible lesions by colposcopy who 
received TA the same day. Between June 2020 and February 2022, we enrolled 1250 
participants: 625 women living with HIV (WLWH) and 625 without HIV. Participant 
median age was 35 years (IQR 30-40). A total of 698 (55.8%) had no prior ICC 
screening, and 589 (99.7%) of WLWH were on antiretroviral therapy. HPV DNA 
positivity overall was 38.1% (n = 476) and higher among WLWH (n = 295, 47.2%) 
than those without HIV (n = 181, 29.0%). Overall, 469 (98.5%) of the 476 HPV+ 
women had VIA performed. Most HPV+ women had VIA performed the same day (96%, 
95% confidence interval [CI]: 94%, 98%). Similarly, most HPV+ women with 
ablation-eligible lesions by colposcopy received TA the same day (99%, 95% CI: 
95%, 100%). VIA performed similarly to colposcopy in eligibility determination 
for TA. A single visit approach is achievable with an Xpert-based 
screen-triage-treat strategy for ICC prevention in Malawi, a reassuring finding 
for HPV-based primary screening scale-up.

Protein arginine methylation was a common post-translational modification, 
playing a key role in many biological processes and disease. But the regulatory 
mechanisms of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) in cancer were not 
well understood. This study aimed to examine the influence of PRMTs across 
various cancers and identify potential PRMTs-related prognostic biomarkers. 
Three machine learning algorithms were employed to identify potential PRMTs 
biomarkers across cancers. Additionally, drug prediction and molecular docking 
studies were carried out to discover new therapeutic targets. Functional 
studies, including Transwell and wound-healing assays, were performed to 
investigate the role of PRMT3 in tumor regulation. Through three machine 
learning algorithms, significant PRMTs prognosis-related biomarkers were 
identified across most cancers. The immune regulatory functions of PRMTs in 
pan-cancer were further examined. Daporinad, dinaciclib, and sepantronium 
bromide were predicted as potential drugs for the majority of cancer types. 
Functionally, the absence of PRMT3 notably inhibited metastasis in pancreatic 
cancer. Ten distinct cell types were identified from single-cell RNA sequencing 
data of pancreatic cancer. PRMT3 might serve as a promising prognostic biomarker 
for pancreatic cancer. These findings contributed to a deeper understanding of 
the regulatory mechanisms of PRMTs in cancer progression. Potential biomarkers 
had been identified that may predict responses to immunotherapy and improve 
survival outcomes for cancer patients. This study provided a detailed overview 
of the functional roles, genetic and epigenetic alterations, and prognostic 
significance of PRMTs in pan-cancer.

BackgroundPrevious research suggests that physicians' inclination to refer 
patients for suspected cancer is a relatively stable characteristic of their 
decision making. We aimed to identify its psychological determinants in the 
presence of a risk-prediction algorithm.MethodsWe presented 200 UK general 
practitioners with online vignettes describing patients with possible colorectal 
cancer. Per the vignette, GPs indicated the likelihood of referral (from highly 
unlikely to highly likely) and level of cancer risk 
(negligible/low/medium/high), received an algorithmic risk estimate, and could 
then revise their responses. After completing the vignettes, GPs responded to 
questions about their values with regard to harms and benefits of cancer 
referral for different stakeholders, perceived severity of errors, acceptance of 
false alarms, and attitudes to uncertainty. We tested whether these values and 
attitudes predicted their earlier referral decisions.ResultsThe algorithm 
significantly reduced both referral likelihood (b = -0.06 [-0.10, -0.007], P = 
0.025) and risk level (b = -0.14 [-0.17, -0.11], P < 0.001). The strongest 
predictor of referral was the value GPs attached to patient benefits (b = 0.30 
[0.23, 0.36], P < 0.001), followed by benefits (b = 0.18 [0.11, 0.24], P < 
0.001) and harms (b = -0.14 [-0.21, -0.08], P < 0.001) to the health 
system/society. The perceived severity of missing a cancer vis-à-vis 
overreferring also predicted referral (b = 0.004 [0.001, 0.007], P = 0.009). The 
algorithm did not significantly reduce the impact of these variables on referral 
decisions.ConclusionsThe decision to refer patients who might have cancer can be 
influenced by how physicians perceive and value the potential benefits and harms 
of referral primarily for patients and the moral seriousness of missing a cancer 
vis-à-vis over-referring. These values contribute to an internal threshold for 
action and are important even when an algorithm informs risk 
judgments.HighlightsPhysicians' inclination to refer patients for suspected 
cancer is determined by their assessment of cancer risk but also their core 
values; specifically, their values in relation to the perceived benefits and 
harms of referrals and the seriousness of missing a cancer compared with 
overreferring.We observed a moral prioritization of referral decision making, in 
which considerations about benefits to the patient were foremost, considerations 
about benefits but also harms to the health system or the society were second, 
while considerations about oneself carried little or no weight.Having an 
algorithm informing assessments of risk influences referral decisions but does 
not remove or significantly reduce the influence of physicians' core values.

VEGF-driven angiogenesis fuels epithelial ovarian cancer progression, ascites, 
and poor prognosis. Current anti-VEGF/chemotherapy combinations provide only 
transient benefits with notable toxicity. HEBERSaVax, a first-in-class 
VEGF-targeting immunotherapy, combines recombinant VEGF-A121 with proprietary 
adjuvants to generate dual anti-tumor effects: (1) neutralizing VEGF signaling 
via antibodies and (2) eliminating VEGF-producing cells through cytotoxic T-cell 
responses. We present results from the multicenter, open-label CENTAURO 4 phase 
2 trial evaluating two formulations of HEBERSaVax combined with 
carboplatin/paclitaxel in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer patients 
(unresectable or suboptimal debulked). Forty patients were randomized 1:1 to 
receive either: Group 1: Standard chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel) plus 
CIGB-247 vaccine (800 μg antigen with 200 μg VSSP adjuvant) Group 2: The same 
chemotherapy regimen plus CIGB-247 (800 μg antigen with 0.7 mg aluminum 
phosphate adjuvant). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. 
Secondary endpoints included objective response rate, overall survival, safety, 
and immune response results. HEBERSaVax exhibited excellent safety profiles and 
comparable immunogenicity with both adjuvant formulations. Vaccination-related 
adverse events were limited to grade 1-2 toxicities. Long-term outcomes showed 
promising clinical activity, with a median progression-free survival of 
18 months and a global median overall survival of 32.82 months at 6-year 
follow-up. No statistically significant differences emerged between the VSSP and 
aluminum phosphate adjuvant formulations for either safety or efficacy 
endpoints. These clinical outcomes and the vaccine's favorable toxicity profile 
position HEBERSaVax as a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for improving 
epithelial ovarian cancer management.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 80 
susceptibility loci for lung cancer risk. However, the genes underlying these 
associations remain largely unknown.
METHODS: We conducted a large transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) to 
identify lung cancer susceptibility genes. We leveraged gene expression data 
from lungs and 48 other tissue types and whole-genome sequencing data from up to 
706 samples of European ancestry in the GTEx (version 8) to build lung-tissue 
and joint-tissue gene expression prediction models. These models were applied to 
GWAS data, including 29,266 lung cancer cases and 56,450 controls, to assess the 
associations of genetically predicted gene expression levels with lung cancer 
risk.
RESULTS: A total of 8624 genes were successfully built for single-tissue models, 
and 11,341 genes for joint-tissue models (12,133 unique genes altogether). Among 
40 genes whose expression levels were associated with the risk of lung cancer at 
a Bonferroni-corrected significance level, ZKSCAN4 was located more than 2 Mb 
away from the GWAS-identified variants linked to lung cancer. Among the 
remaining 39 genes within 2 Mb of GWAS-identified variants, seven genes were 
independent of these. Among 53 genes associated with the risk of lung cancer 
subtypes, 13 genes were beyond 2 Mb of GWAS-identified variants, and four genes 
were independent of the GWAS-identified variants within 2 Mb regions.
CONCLUSION: Our TWAS identified over 50 candidate susceptibility genes for lung 
cancer, providing new insights into lung cancer genetics.

Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) proteins, including RhoGDI2, 
regulate the functions of Ras superfamily proteins that are known to be 
important cancer drug targets. Given the challenges in directly targeting Ras 
superfamily proteins with small molecules, targeting GDIs represents a unique 
opportunity but has seen limited success. In this work, we discovered HR3119 as 
the first ligand of RhoGDI2 with low-micromolar affinity (Kd = 8 μM) starting 
from a millimolar binding affinity fragment hit (Kd = 714 μM). HR3119 and its 
derivatives were rationally designed based on a series of ligand-bound RhoGDI2 
crystal structures. HR3119 occupies the protein-protein interaction interface 
between RhoGDI2 and its endogenous ligand Rac1 to disrupt RhoGDI2-Rac1 binding. 
Interestingly, the complex structure suggests that (6R)-HR3119 preferentially 
bound to RhoGDI2 when crystallized with a racemic mixture. The purified 
(6R)-HR3119 demonstrated a nearly 100-fold binding affinity advantage compared 
to (6S)-HR3119. Finally, (6R)-HR3119 engaged with RhoGDI2 in cells and 
suppressed the migration of aggressive breast cancer cells. Our work provides 
insights into the discovery of small-molecule compounds targeting RhoGDI2 in 
terms of methodology, chemistry starting points, compound design, and phenotype 
studies, underscoring exciting new perspectives in early drug discovery.

The increasing incidence of cancer-related morbidity and mortality underscores 
the urgent need for novel, less toxic therapeutic options. In this study, we 
isolated scytonemin from the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya aestuarii. Its 
identification was confirmed through an absorption peak at 384 nm and MALDI-TOF 
MS analysis showing a [M + H]+ ion at m/z 545.838, consistent with its oxidised 
form (C36H20N2O4). Scytonemin demonstrated significant cytotoxicity against 
breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, with IC50 values of 8 μM and 
4 μM, respectively, while remaining non-toxic to human peripheral blood 
lymphocytes (HPBLs). The compound rapidly induced caspase-dependent intrinsic 
apoptosis within 2 h, with apoptotic effects magnifying at 24 and 48 h. 
Molecular docking and reporter gene assays revealed that scytonemin inhibits two 
critical proteins associated with cancer progression c-Myc and Polo-like kinase 
1 (PLK1). These results suggest that scytonemin holds promise as a lead compound 
for the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cold forceps biopsy (CFB) is commonly used for the 
suspected diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). With larger pathologic 
specimens, cold snare biopsy (CSB) of CRC may be an attractive alternative. We 
performed a cohort study to compare the effectiveness and safety of CSB to CFB.
METHODS: Suspected CRC patients were retrospective and prospectively included 
and assigned to CFB or CSB at a single tertiary center. The primary outcome was 
the diagnostic consistency between endoscopic visual diagnosis and final biopsy 
tissue based on the duration required to determine diagnosis. And the diagnostic 
consistency between surgical postoperative pathology and final biopsy tissue. 
Secondary outcomes were clinically significant CSB or CFB-related bleeding, 
perforation, and technical success.
RESULTS: A total of 2000 suspected CRCs in 2000 patients were enrolled in CSB 
group (n=411) and CFB group (n=1589). The technical success rate of the 2 groups 
was 100%. Two groups were significantly different for diagnostic consistency: 
411/411 (100.0%), 381/411 (92.7%) CSB versus CFB 1438/1589 (90.5%), 1388/1589 
(87.35%) (OR 1.035 and 1.839; 95% CI: 1.026-1.045 and 1.233-2.744; P＜0.001 and P 
= 0.002). Bleeding and perforation occurred similarly in the 2 groups (16/411, 
2/411, 0/411, 0/411 vs. 73/1589, 11/1589, 0/1589, 0/1589; P＞0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with CFB, CSB is more effective in diagnosing suspected 
CRC without increasing adverse events.

OBJECTIVE: Laryngeal cancer is a significant head and neck malignancy, whose 
prevalence is increasing. Radiomics consists of high-dimensional and 
reproducible quantitative data which can serve as biomarkers with strong 
correlations to tumor staging, prognosis, and survival outcomes. The aim of this 
scoping review is to summarize the knowledge from the existing literature 
regarding the value of radiomics in laryngeal cancer management.
DATA SOURCES: Eligible articles were identified by a search of the Medline and 
PubMed bibliographical databases for the period up to May 2025.
REVIEW METHODS: This scoping review was performed in accordance with the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
guidelines. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed 
using the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) framework.
RESULTS: Thirty studies were deemed eligible, including a total of 3503 patients 
with laryngeal cancer. Primary objectives were the development of predictive 
models for overall survival, progression-free survival, local control, treatment 
response, and staging. Across studies, radiomics-based models consistently 
outperformed clinical or conventional imaging-based models in predicting key 
outcomes. Models combining radiomic features with clinicopathological variables 
achieved the highest accuracy. Recent advances include the use of deep learning, 
which further improved predictive performance compared to traditional radiomics. 
However, common limitations include heterogeneity in imaging protocols, feature 
extraction software, and model development algorithms, as well as a lack of 
external validation.
CONCLUSION: Despite several limitations that currently hinder routine clinical 
adoption of radiomics, this rapidly evolving field demonstrates significant 
potential to improve staging accuracy, prognostication, and personalized 
management in laryngeal cancer.

Dual-omics, by integrating molecular information from two distinct dimensions, 
can offer more comprehensive perspective for complex disease. Herein, we 
developed an efficient functionalized mesoporous nanoparticle-coupled laser 
desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (fMNPLDI-MS) platform capable of 
extracting high-quality serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs) and serum peptide 
fingerprints (SPFs) from trace serum samples within 50 s. Integrating these SMFs 
and SPFs markedly improved early screening and subtyping of 
endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer (EAOC) more than single omics. 
Specifically, leveraging machine learning on the identified 6 metabolites and 6 
peptides, the integration strategy attained an area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.989 and accuracy of 93.1%, compared with 
0.964/89.7% for metabolomics alone and 0.960/87.9% for peptidomics alone in 
distinguishing EAOC from benign controls. Similarly, the dual-omics integration 
strategy achieved an AUC value of 0.875 and accuracy of 86.7%, surpassing 
individual metabolomics (AUC: 0.869, accuracy: 83.3%) and peptidomics (AUC: 
0.733, accuracy: 76.7%), in subtype classification. This high-throughput 
fMNPLDI-MS dual-omics platform provides a powerful tool for EAOC screening and 
subtyping, paving the way toward early detection and precision management of 
this malignancy.

AIMS: Epidemiological studies indicate a heightened risk of pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma (PAAD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This 
study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying their comorbidity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Common DEGs between T2DM and PAAD were identified from 
GEO datasets. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed via PPI, 
GO, and KEGG. Core genes were screened and their diagnostic value was validated 
by ROC curves. Immune infiltration and TF-mRNA-miRNA regulatory networks were 
constructed to explore disease mechanisms. Core gene expression and prognostic 
significance in PAAD were assessed using GEPIA2 and HPA. Potential therapeutics 
targeting core genes were predicted via the Therapeutic Target Database.
RESULTS: A total of 35 DEGs were identified. GO analysis linked these genes to 
cell adhesion and extracellular matrix (ECM) components. KEGG enrichment 
highlighted ECM-receptor interaction as the top pathway. Key ECM-related 
molecules-ITGA3, FN1, LAMB3, ITGA2, and LAMC2-were upregulated in both T2DM and 
PAAD. Six potential therapeutic agents targeting ITGA2, LAMB3, and FN1 were 
identified.
CONCLUSION: Three genes and associated known drugs identified in this study may 
serve as potential targets for treating the coexistence of the two diseases.

Phototherapy approaches include photodynamic therapy (PDT), which utilizes 
chemically stable photocatalysts to sensitize the conversion of endogenous 
molecules such as oxygen (O2) to form transient reactive species such as 1O2, 
and photopharmacology, a complementary approach that relies on molecules that 
undergo self-modifying photochemistry, such as bond cleavage reactions or 
isomerization, for the creation of biologically active products. While Ru(II) 
polypyridyl systems have demonstrated utility for both approaches, related 
organometallic systems are relatively less explored. Here, the photochemistry 
and photobiological responses were compared for five Ru(II) arene compounds 
containing photolabile monodentate azine ligands and the π-expansive bidentate 
ligands dipyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-c]phenazine (dppz), 
4,5,9,16-tetraaza-dibenzo[a,c]naphthacene (dppn), and α-terthienyl-appended 
imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline (IP-3T). The compounds demonstrated 
significant light-mediated photocytotoxicity in lung cancer and melanoma cell 
lines, with up to 6000-fold increases in cytotoxicity upon irradiation. The 
arene systems were capable of partitioning between different excited state 
relaxation pathways, both releasing the monodentate ligand and generating 1O2, 
but with notably low yields that did not correlate with the photocytotoxicity of 
the systems. The organometallic compounds exhibit less mixing of the 
metal-associated and ligand-centered excited states than analogous polypyridyl 
coordination compounds, providing a structurally, photochemically, and 
photobiologically distinct class of compounds that can support both metal- and 
ligand-centered reactivity.

It has been discovered that many solid tumors express the survivin gene, 
particularly in tissue samples. On the other hand, limited data exist on the 
significance of the survivin gene in bronchial aspirates from lung cancer 
patients. The current study was designed to evaluate the levels of the survivin 
gene in lung cancer patients and correlate them with other clinical features. 
The study population consisted of 58 patients with lung cancer. A total of 25 
patients with non-malignant lung diseases were used as a comparable group. We 
used real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to 
assess survivin gene level in bronchial aspirate during bronchoscopy from 
individuals with lung cancer, as well as those with benign lung diseases. Cases 
with lung cancer had bronchial aspirates with a substantially greater survivin 
gene level (3.7±1.8) compared to individuals with benign lung illnesses 
(1.1±0.9) (p=0.0001). The lung cancer diagnosis had a sensitivity of 74.14% and 
a specificity of 96% when 2.4 of the survivin gene was used as the cutoff value. 
The levels of the survivin gene in lung cancer patients were significantly 
positively correlated with both age and performance status, with p values of 
0.012 and 0.0001, respectively. Nonetheless, there was a negative connection 
between the survivin gene level and the length of symptoms as well as the 
survival time in months, with p-values of 0.027 and 0.001, respectively. As a 
molecular marker, survivin gene identification in bronchial aspirate has both 
diagnostic and prognostic significance for lung cancer.

Exosomes, the cargo of circRNA, are crucial in cancer cell-tumor 
microenvironment communication. circSMARCC1 exerts a pro-tumor effect. However, 
this role has not been previously reported in gastric cancer (STAD). This study 
explores the role of STAD cell-derived exosomal circSMARCC1 in promoting 
macrophage M2 polarization. In this study, exosomes from the peripheral blood of 
STAD patients and AGS cells were extracted and identified. THP-1 cells were 
differentiated into macrophages with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 
polarized to the M2 phenotype by IL-4 and IL-13. circSMARCC1 expression was 
analyzed in STAD tissues, cell lines, and patient-derived exosomes. The 
biological function of circSMARCC1 in STAD cells was evaluated by CCK-8, EdU, 
and Transwell assays. The role of circSMARCC1 and U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary 
factor 2 (U2AF2) in regulating macrophage M2 polarization was verified by 
bioinformatics methods, qRT-PCR, Western blot, ELISA, and a nude mouse 
tumor-bearing model. Our findings demonstrated that circSMARCC1 was upregulated 
in STAD and associated with macrophage immune infiltration. circSMARCC1 
knockdown suppressed the malignant phenotypes of STAD cells and M2 macrophage 
polarization, whereas its overexpression led to the contrary result. Animal 
experiments further confirmed circSMARCC1 regulated tumor growth and macrophage 
M2 polarization. Importantly, exosomal circSMARCC1 in STAD patients was 
increased. Knockdown of circSMARCC1 in AGS cells reduced its level in secreted 
exosomes and inhibited M2 polarization, whereas overexpression produced the 
opposite effect. Mechanistically, circSMARCC1 upregulated U2AF2 expression 
through exosomes to promote macrophage M2 polarization. Collectively, STAD 
cell-derived exosomes induced macrophage M2 polarization to promote STAD 
progression through circSMARCC1.

Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among gynecological malignancies 
worldwide. Surgery and chemotherapy are the primary treatment modalities; 
however, their effectiveness significantly diminishes in the advanced stages of 
the disease. There is emerging evidence suggesting that natural products, 
including phytochemicals, could be beneficial in treating ovarian cancer. In 
this study, we employed SKOV3 cells to investigate the anticancer activity and 
the specific mechanisms of corylin, a principal flavonoid isolated from the 
fruit of Psoralea corylifolia. Corylin inhibited SKOV3 cell proliferation and 
colony formation in a dosedependent manner. It also induced apoptosis through 
the activation of caspases and disruption of the mitochondrial membrane 
potential. Moreover, corylin caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest by modifying the 
levels of cyclin D1 and the phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein. Further 
mechanistic studies demonstrated a marked downregulation of Signal transducer 
and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation, nuclear localization, 
and target gene expression in corylin-treated SKOV3 cells. These findings 
suggest that corylin is a promising therapeutic agent for inhibiting cancer cell 
proliferation by targeting STAT3 in ovarian cancer.

While our prior study identified the HLA-A *0201-restricted ACRBP epitope 
peptide and demonstrated its capacity to generate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) 
in vitro, the clinical relevance of the peptide-induced T cell reactivity in 
ovarian cancer (OC) patients and the in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of these CTLs 
remain unexplored. In this study, dendritic cells were sensitized with ACRBP 
peptide (ALLVLCYSI) and co-cultured with autologous CD8+T cells to induce the 
production of specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Pep-CTLs). The anti-tumor 
effects of Pep-CTLs were evaluated in SCID mice bearing human ovarian cancer 
(OC) OVCAR-3 cells. Concurrently, we co-cultured ALLVLCYSI peptide with 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from OC patients (HLA-A2+, ACRBP+) 
and assessed the number of specific T cells using ELISPOT assays. The 
immunological impact of the ACRBP peptide against human OC was validated through 
both in vitro and in vivo experiments. These findings establish a preclinical 
foundationfor developing ACRBP peptide-based vaccines in OC immunotherapy. To 
further elucidate ACRBP's role in OC treatment, the study analyzed single-cell 
RNA sequencing data from 8 OC patients and bulk RNA sequencing data from the 
Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) comprising 308 ovarian cancer cases. This 
analysis aimed to explore the heterogeneity among ACRBP-expressing tumor cell 
populations and to investigate the correlation between ACRBP expression and 
immune molecule expression (including MHC and chemokines) alongside chemotherapy 
response. These insights furnish a theoretical framework supporting the future 
application of ACRBP in tumor immunotherapy and strategies to prevent immune 
escape.

BACKGROUND: Accurate axillary staging is critical for selecting appropriate 
treatment strategies in breast cancer. Ultrasound (US) and ultrasound-guided 
fine-needle aspiration cytology (US + FNAC) are widely used to evaluate axillary 
lymph nodes. The study assessed the diagnostic accuracy of US and US + FNAC and 
examined whether axillary dissection (AD) is necessary in patients with positive 
US + FNAC findings.
METHODS: We analyzed 646 axillae from 642 breast cancer patients who underwent 
surgery at Hiraka General Hospital between 2013 and 2024. All patients underwent 
axillary US, and US + FNAC was performed on morphologically suspicious nodes. 
Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of US and US + FNAC were determined using 
postoperative pathology as the reference standard. The number of nodal 
metastases was compared between patients undergoing primary surgery and those 
receiving primary systemic therapy (PST).
RESULTS: In the primary surgery group (n = 516), US sensitivity, specificity, 
PPV, and NPV were 30.9% (38/123), 94.1% (370/393), 62.3% (38/61), and 81.3% 
(370/455), respectively. Corresponding values for US + FNAC were 80.6% (29/36), 
100% (22/22), 100% (29/29), and 75.9% (22/29). US + FNAC showed significantly 
higher sensitivity and PPV than US alone. Among US + FNAC-positive cases, 55.2% 
(16/29) had ≥ 3 metastatic nodes, compared with 6.9% (2/29) of negative cases. 
In the PST group (n = 130), US sensitivity was ≤ 88.1% (37/42), and US + FNAC 
sensitivity was ≤ 92.6% (25/27). Of the 46 US + FNAC-positive patients, 45.7% 
(21/46) became node-negative after PST, whereas 26.1% (12/46) had ≥ 3 positive 
nodes.
CONCLUSION: US + FNAC improves diagnostic accuracy for axillary staging; 
however, standard AD may constitute overtreatment in some FNAC-positive 
patients. Selective de-escalation of axillary surgery should therefore be 
considered.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common tumour in men and the second 
most common in women. It ranks as the third leading cause of new cancer cases 
and cancer-related deaths in both sexes. Due to differences in embryonic origin, 
rectal cancer (RC) is considered a distinct entity from colon cancer in terms of 
staging and treatment. Mortality rates in more developed countries are 
decreasing, largely due to increased screening and advances in the staging and 
treatment of rectal cancer. Current screening methods include faecal occult 
blood testing (FOBT) and rectosigmoidoscopy. For staging, the most commonly used 
imaging modalities are abdominopelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for locoregional evaluation, and computed 
tomography (CT), MRI, or positron emission tomography (PET) for detecting 
distant metastases. Traditionally, the standard treatment for rectal cancer has 
been total mesorectal excision. However, more recently, it has been observed 
that patients with non-advanced stages of the disease may benefit from 
neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy, which can allow for less invasive surgery at a 
later stage. In recent years, radiomic studies have emerged to identify 
predictive features of tumour progression, with the goal of personalising 
treatment according to each patient's characteristics.

Our study aimed to analyze the correlation of cancer-related parameters with 
tumor regression grade (TRG) and disease-free survival (DFS) by gender in 192 
rectal cancer patients operated on after neoadjuvant long-course 
chemoradiotherapy (LCCRT). Preoperative diagnostics revealed no significant 
gender differences in any clinical parameters other than obesity (p=0.031). We 
found that slightly overweight men had a lower incidence of distant metastases 
(p=0.042). The post-LCCRT pathologic finding showed that women had more positive 
lymph nodes (ypN, p=0.002) while no other pathologic parameter differed 
significantly between the genders. Overall, a poor response to therapy 
correlated with a shorter time to disease progression (p=0.002). Women achieved 
ypN0 in 50% of cases, but only 27% had a good TRG compared to 40.5% of men 
(p=0.073). Women had a worse DFS than men, even when complete response to 
therapy was achieved (p=0.003), and greater depth of residual tumor invasion 
(ypT, p=0.035) and higher ypN (p=0.002) correlated with shorter DFS. Positive 
resection margins (p<0.001), higher ypN stage (p=0.003), and poor TRG (p=0.025) 
correlated with shorter DFS in men. We conclude that women have a poorer 
response to LCCRT with the possibility that therapeutic approach to the 
neoadjuvant treatment of rectal cancer may be gender-specific.

BACKGROUND: Recent innovations in technology have significantly advanced the 
imaging capabilities of positron emission tomography/computed tomography 
(PET/CT). Digital PET/CT provides sensitive and high-resolution imaging and can 
improve the detection of small lesions as compared to conventional (analog) 
PET/CT. This study aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of digital versus 
analog PET/CT for detecting lymph node metastases and to assess the maximum 
standardized uptake (SUVmax) values in patients with resected non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: We enrolled a total of 103 patients with lung adenocarcinoma or 
squamous cell carcinoma who had undergone preoperative PET/CT in either analog 
or digital scanners. The primary endpoint was comparison of the diagnostic 
performance of the two modalities for lymph node metastasis, and the secondary 
endpoints were comparison of the SUVmax values and correlation of the SUVmax 
values with the Glut-1 (glucose transporter type 1) expression.
RESULTS: Of the 103 patients enrolled in the study, 61 had undergone analog 
PET/CT, and 42 had undergone digital PET/CT. Significantly higher SUVmax values 
on digital as compare with analog PET/CT were obtained for cT1b tumors (D/A 
ratio = 3.42, p = 0.002) as well as cT1c tumors (D/A ratio = 2.10, p < 0.001). 
However, no significant difference in SUVmax values between the two types of 
PET/CT was obtained for tumors exceeding 3.0 cm in diameter. A stronger 
correlation was found between tumor Glut-1 expression and the SUVmax values 
obtained digital PET/CT as compared with the values obtained with analog PET/CT. 
Digital PET/CT also showed a higher sensitivity (71.4% vs 37.5%) for detecting 
lymph node metastases, although the specificity was slightly lower (88.6% vs 
96.2%), and the overall accuracy was comparable (85.7% vs 88.5%) between the two 
types of scanners. False-positive lymph nodes on digital PET/CT were obtained in 
conditions such as pneumoconiosis and anthracosis, while false-negatives results 
were obtained in conditions such as micrometastases and/or low lymph node Glut-1 
expression.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that digital PET/CT shows improved diagnostic 
sensitivity and that the results of digital PET/CT are better correlated with 
tumor metabolic activity, which results in improved detection of lymph node 
metastases. These results support the clinical usefulness of digital PET/CT for 
optimizing perioperative strategies and increasing diagnostic confidence in the 
management of NSCLC. Future multicenter prospective studies and a standardized 
redefinition of SUVmax are urgently needed to validate our findings and to 
establish more reliable clinical application of digital PET/CT in patients with 
lung cancer.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Luminal B breast cancer (LBBC) is on the rise worldwide, 
with both incidence and mortality rates steadily increasing. Early detection 
proves difficult due to its aggressive characteristics, most notably its 
heightened proliferation rate and the complex interplay of molecular biomarkers, 
particularly in more advanced stages.
METHODS: Data Sources: In the present study, we conducted an in-silico analysis 
of LBBC cell lines using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) microarray dataset, 
which includes 30 LBBC and 11 normal samples. Analysis Tools: Differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using RStudio. A series of analyses, 
including cancer data interrogation via pan-cancer analysis, eXpression2Kinases 
(X2K), and the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMAP), was carried out to elucidate the 
underlying signaling pathways, transcription factors (TFs), and kinases, as well 
as to perform stemformatics analysis. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks 
were reconstructed using STRING and Cytoscape, enabling the identification of 
co-expressed and hub genes through the cytoHubba plug-in.
RESULTS: Of notes, FGF2, EGFR, ADIPOQ, LIPE, MET, IGF1, FGF1, EGF, FGF7, and 
PPARG were identified as the top 10 hub genes; RELA, PPARG, CTCF, EGR1, and 
NFE2L2 were detected as predominant TFs in LBBC; and CDK1, CDK2, MAPK3, CSNK2A1, 
and MAPK14 were identified as potential biomarkers through hub gene clustering. 
Further analysis indicated hsa-mir-221-3p and hsa-mir-29a-3p as key miRNAs 
targeting LBBC-related genes.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, our findings highlighted LBBC-associated genes, TFs, 
miRNAs, and pathways as prospective biomarkers, providing insights into LBBC 
diagnosis and therapeutic approaches.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive 
subtype lacking estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors, often leading to 
poor prognosis due to high recurrence and metastasis. FOXP3 expression, 
associated with suppressed anti-tumor immunity, is a potential prognostic marker 
in TNBC. However, the association between FOXP3 expression and disease-free 
survival (DFS) in TNBC remains controversial. This study aims to explore the 
relationship between FOXP3 expression and DFS in TNBC patients, contributing to 
the understanding of its prognostic significance.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 47 TNBC patients. 
Immunohistochemistry examination assessed FOXP3 expression, which was then 
categorized into low and high expression based on an optimal cut-off point. 
Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using Cox regression test to 
determine association between variables and DFS. Survival analysis was assessed 
using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test.
RESULTS: All patients were female mostly over 50 years old (66%). The majority 
had tumors >2 cm (87.2%) and LVI (66%). High-grade tumors (grade 3) were 
predominant (93.6%). Most patients showed moderate TIL levels (91.5%). No 
significant associations were found between FOXP3 expression and age (p=0.253), 
tumor size (p=0.308), lymph node status (p=0.466), tumor grade (p=0.476), LVI 
(p=0.422), patient's stage (p=0.644), and TILs (p=0.783). However, high FOXP3 
expression was significantly associated with worse DFS (p=0.019). Additionally, 
a higher stage was associated with worse DFS (p=0.002).
CONCLUSION: High FOXP3 expression is associated with lower DFS in TNBC patients. 
FOXP3 expression was not associated with age, tumor size, lymph node status, 
tumor grade, LVI, TILs, or cancer stage.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the expression patterns of 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in patients with triple-negative breast 
cancer (TNBC) in Kerman, Iran, and investigate its association with various 
clinicopathological factors.
METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 54 TNBC patients 
diagnosed between 2013 and 2022. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to 
assess EGFR expression levels in tumor tissue samples. Patients were classified 
as EGFR-positive or EGFR-negative based on IHC staining results. 
Clinicopathological data, including age, tumor grade, vascular invasion, lymph 
node involvement, Ki-67 proliferation index, presence of necrosis, ductal 
carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and microcalcifications, were collected. Statistical 
analyses were performed to examine the association between EGFR expression and 
clinicopathological variables.
RESULTS: EGFR expression was positive in 61.1% of the patients. A significant 
association was found between EGFR positivity and higher tumor histologic grade 
(P = 0.045), with 69.7% of EGFR-positive patients exhibiting grade III tumors 
compared to 38.1% in the EGFR-negative group. Although not statistically 
significant, EGFR-positive patients tended to be younger (median age 44 years) 
than EGFR-negative patients (median age 52 years) (P = 0.157). The Ki-67 
proliferation index was higher in EGFR-positive patients (median 60.0%) compared 
to EGFR-negative patients (median 47.5%).
CONCLUSION: EGFR expression is significantly associated with higher tumor grade, 
suggesting a correlation with more aggressive tumor behavior. EGFR may serve as 
a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in TNBC. Further research 
with larger cohorts is recommended to validate these findings and explore the 
implications of EGFR-targeted therapies in TNBC management.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) remains a major global health burden despite 
advances in diagnosis and treatment. In recent years, natural products have 
gained increasing attention as promising sources of anticancer agents, including 
GC.
METHODS: In this study, we applied an in silico ensemble-based modeling strategy 
to predict compounds with potential inhibitory effects against four GC-related 
cell lines: AGS, NCI-N87, BGC-823, and SNU-16. Individual predictive models were 
developed using several algorithms and further integrated into two consensus 
ensemble multi-objective models. A comprehensive database of over 100,000 
natural compounds from 21,665 plant species, was screened for validation and to 
identify potential molecular candidates.
RESULTS: The ensemble models demonstrated a 12-15-fold improvement in 
identifying active molecules compared to random selection. A total of 340 
molecules were prioritized, many belonging to bioactive classes such as taxane 
diterpenoids, flavonoids, isoflavonoids, phloroglucinols, and tryptophan 
alkaloids. Known anticancer compounds, including paclitaxel, orsaponin (OSW-1), 
glycybenzofuran, and glyurallin A, were successfully retrieved, reinforcing the 
validity of the approach. Species from the genera Taxus, Glycyrrhiza, 
Elaphoglossum, and Seseli emerged as particularly relevant sources of bioactive 
candidates.
CONCLUSION: While some genera, such as Taxus and Glycyrrhiza, have 
well-documented anticancer properties, others, including Elaphoglossum and 
Seseli, require further experimental validation. These findings highlight the 
potential of combining multi-objectives ensemble modeling with natural product 
databases to discover novel phytochemicals relevant to GC treatment.

Metastasis remains the leading cause of cancer-related death, yet the biological 
determinants that enable tumor cells to disseminate and colonize distant organs 
are incompletely understood. Emerging evidence identifies the microbiome, not 
merely as a bystander, but as an active architect of the metastatic cascade. 
Microbial communities residing in the gut, mucosal barriers, and within tumors 
shape metastatic progression by modulating immune surveillance, stromal 
remodeling, oncogenic signaling, and therapy response. Intratumoral and even 
intracellular microbes regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, 
and immune escape, while gut-derived metabolites condition pre-metastatic niches 
and alter systemic immunity. Technological advances in spatial transcriptomics, 
single-cell multi-omics, and metagenomics have revealed a spatially organized, 
functionally integrated microbial ecosystem within tumors, challenging long-held 
assumptions of sterility in cancer biology. This review synthesizes five 
converging dimensions of this paradigm: microbial interactions in the metastatic 
tumor microenvironment; microbiome-mediated immunoediting and metastatic escape; 
the role of intratumoral and intracellular bacteria in dissemination; 
spatial-multi-omic approaches to map microbial niches; and microbial biomarkers 
predictive of metastasis and therapy outcomes. Collectively, these findings 
recast the microbiome as a critical and targetable determinant of metastasis. 
Deciphering the tumor-microbe-host triad holds transformative potential for 
biomarker development, therapeutic innovation, and precision oncology.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of [99ᵐTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S 
SPECT/CT in primary prostate cancer (PCa) detection and assess its ability to 
predict metastatic involvement and tumor aggressiveness in this single-center 
retrospective study.
METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study enrolled 48 patients with 
suspected PCa (39 confirmed PCa, 9 benign conditions) who underwent 
[99ᵐTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S SPECT/CT between September 2022 and November 2023. Imaging 
was performed 4 h post-injection of 0.74 GBq [99ᵐTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S. Systematic 
prostate biopsy or surgical specimens served as the reference standard. Maximum 
standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were quantified in regions of enhanced 
prostatic uptake using Q.Volumetrix software. Correlations between SUVmax and 
clinicopathological parameters were analyzed using receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curves.
RESULTS: [99ᵐTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S SPECT/CT achieved 100% sensitivity, 77.78% 
specificity, and 95.83% accuracy. SUVmax correlated significantly with Gleason 
score, PSA levels, risk stratification, and metastatic status. Median SUVmax was 
significantly elevated in patients with PSA > 20 ng/mL versus ≤20 ng/mL (13.20 
vs. 6.68; p = 0.013) and Gleason score >7 versus ≤7 (13.60 vs. 6.75; p = 0.006). 
High-risk and metastatic cohorts demonstrated significantly higher SUVmax values 
(p = 0.010 and p = 0.023, respectively). For high-risk PCa prediction, optimal 
SUVmax cutoff was ≥10.85 (AUC = 0.84; sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 58%). 
For metastatic PCa detection, optimal cutoff was SUVmax ≥14.45 (AUC = 0.73; 
sensitivity = 92%, specificity = 50%).
CONCLUSION: [99ᵐTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S SPECT/CT demonstrates excellent diagnostic 
performance for PCa detection. SUVmax serves as a robust predictor for risk 
stratification and metastatic potential assessment.

Introduction Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the most common 
cancer of the head and neck region, including the oral cavity, larynx, pharynx, 
nasal cavity, and paranasal sinuses. Cancer arises because of cumulative genetic 
and epigenetic alterations in cancer-associated genes. It is important to 
understand the genetic/epigenetic background of the tumors to establish 
molecular targeted therapies. So far, the knowledge of key genes or molecules, 
which are closely associated with the carcinogenesis and development of HNSCC, 
is insufficient for targeted therapies. On the other hand, recent advances in 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) have greatly contributed to cancer genome 
research. In this research, using RNA sequence data of HNSCC stored in The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we identified differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs), functionally enriched gene sets, and new prognostic markers or 
candidate therapeutic targets. This exploratory study investigated whether novel 
prognostic markers and candidate therapeutic targets for HNSCC could be 
identified from TCGA RNA-seq data. Methods The RNA sequence data were downloaded 
from TCGA, including 504 cases from cancer and 44 cases from corresponding 
normal tissue. The DEGs between cancer and normal samples were detected using 
the DESeq2 package in R software. Differences with | log2 fold change (FC) | > 
1.0 and p-value <0.05 were considered as DEGs. Functional enrichment analyses 
were performed by ShinyGO 0.85 with Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. A gene set enrichment 
analysis (GSEA) was also performed using GSEA software. We also analyzed the top 
10 up- and down-regulated genes, which were sorted by adjusted p-value, by using 
Kaplan-Meier analysis to assess their potential as prognostic markers. Results 
Using the DESeq2 package, 10,976 DEGs were detected, including 6,932 
up-regulated genes and 4,044 down-regulated genes in cancer. As expected, 
functional enrichment analyses revealed enrichment of KEGG terms associated with 
cancers, including ""Pathway in Cancer"", ""Human Papillomavirus infection"", and 
""PI3K-Akt signaling pathway"" in up-regulated genes, whereas KEGG terms enriched 
in down-regulated genes were mainly ""Metabolic pathways"". GO terms for ""Cell 
differentiation (GOBP)"" and ""Extracellular region (GOCC)"" were enriched both in 
up- and down-regulated genes, suggesting aberrant expression of genes associated 
with cell differentiation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. GSEA data 
supported the enrichment analyses data. Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that high 
expression of homeobox C6 (HOXC6) (p=0.048), nucleobindin 2 (NUCB2) (p=0.007), 
IL12A antisense RNA 1 (IL12A-AS1) (p=0.001), calcium-binding protein 39-like 
(CAB39L)(p=0.038), nitric oxide synthase trafficking (NOSTRIN) (p=0.024), SLC8A1 
antisense RNA 1 (SLC8A1-AS1) (p=0.016), were the significantly correlated with 
poorer prognosis. Conclusions Based on bioinformatical approaches, we identified 
significantly enriched gene sets and novel candidates for prognostic markers or 
therapeutic targets in HNSCC. Further investigation would aid in determining the 
anti-cancer effects of these candidates.

INTRODUCTION: The discovery of anti-cancer drugs from natural plants represents 
a large interest around the world. Ferulic acid (FA) is a natural phenolic acid 
has antitumor activity. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a potent chemotherapeutic agent 
used in the treatment of breast cancer, but its clinical uses are limited due to 
its toxic effects. This study aimed to evaluate the antitumour effect of FA and 
its nanosuspension (FA-NS) alone and in combination with DOX in Ehrlich solid 
tumour (EST)-bearing mice.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-five female mice were divided into 7 groups: 
control, EST, FA, FA-NS, DOX, FA + DOX, and FA-NS + DOX. Proliferation, 
autophagy, apoptosis, angiogenesis, oxidative stress, and total antioxidant 
capacity (TAC) were investigated.
RESULTS: Our results showed that FA alone or in combination with DOX decreased 
tumour weight, proliferation, and angiogenesis by downregulating AKT and 
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 levels, with marked elevation in 
autophagy and apoptosis indicated by upregulating Beclin-1, LC3-II, and 
caspase-3 levels. In addition, reduction of oxidative stress was indicated by 
decreased malondialdehyde and elevated TAC levels. Interestingly, the 
combination treatment mitigates DOX-induced different toxicities through the 
reduction of high levels of troponin-1, creatine kinase-MB, alanine 
transaminase, aspartate transaminase, urea, and creatinine.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of FA with DOX has the ability not only to promote 
the antitumour activity of DOX but also to ameliorate the side effects of DOX 
with more significant results when the FA was formulated by the nanotechnology.

INTRODUCTION: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive subtype of 
lung cancer that accounts for approximately 15% of all lung cancers. Despite 
advancements in treatment, real-world clinical practice in developing countries 
often reveals less favorable outcomes than those observed in randomized clinical 
trials.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on all patients 
with extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) diagnosed or treated at a single center in 
Bosnia and Herzego-vina. Medical and electronic health records were reviewed to 
collect data on patients diagnosed with ES-SCLC between 2013 and 2023. The 
analysis included patient demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment 
outcomes, and adverse events.
RESULTS: Ninety-four patients with ES-SCLC were included in the study. Of these, 
89.4% were prescribed first-line treatment, and 63.8% received first- line 
chemotherapy based on cisplatin and etoposide. The median progression- free 
survival in patients treated with first-line ES-SCLC was five months, with a 
response rate of 57.5%. The median overall survival of patients treated with 
first-line chemotherapy in our study was seven months. The most common side 
effect was hematologic toxicity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the outcomes of patients with ES-SCLC in 
real clinical practice are poor. Further studies of real-world treatment 
outcomes are essential to validate the findings from randomized controlled 
trials. Ongoing research is needed to explore strategies for improving outcomes 
and addressing the unmet needs of patients with ES-SCLC.
