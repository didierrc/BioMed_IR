In this study the impact of achenes on polyphenolic compounds, ascorbic acids, 
and antioxidant activities in strawberry purees at production and after storage 
at 6 and 22 degrees C for 8 and 16 weeks was investigated. Strawberry purees 
were made from flesh, berry, and achene-enriched homogenate and contained 0, 
1.2, and 2.9% achenes, respectively. At production, strawberry purees made from 
flesh contained more anthocyanins, p-coumaroyl glycosides, and ascorbic acids, 
whereas increasing achene levels caused increasing levels of ellagic acid 
derivatives, proanthocyanidins, flavonols, total phenolics (TP), and antioxidant 
activities. In addition, the anthocyanins, TP, and ferric reducing ability power 
(FRAP) in purees with more achenes were better retained during storage. Ascorbic 
acids and anthocyanins declined rapidly during storage, whereas other 
polyphenols and antioxidant activities were more stable; that is, the 
contributions from anthocyanins and ascorbic acids to TP and antioxidant 
activities decreased. The findings that achenes contributed significantly to 
polyphenol content and stability of strawberry purees may be interesting in a 
nutritional and, thus, commercial, perspective.

Wheat grain is recognized as a good source of potentially health-enhancing 
components such as dietary fiber, phenolics, tocopherols, and carotenoids. 
Anthocyanins, another group of bioactive compounds, are found in blue and purple 
wheat grains. In the present study, a blue aleurone spring wheat line ""Purendo 
38"" with relatively high content of total anthocyanins was used to investigate 
the composition and stability of anthocyanins over three crop years. Commercial 
cultivars of purple (Konini) and red (Katepwa) wheats were included in the 
study. Separation of anthocyanins by high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) showed that each wheat had a distinct anthocyanin profile. Four major 
anthocyanins were separated from blue wheat extracts as compared to five 
anthocyanins in purple wheat. Cyanidin 3-glucoside was the predominant 
anthocyanin in purple wheat, whereas it was the second major anthocyanin in blue 
wheat. The predominant anthocyanin in blue wheat, making up approximately 41% of 
the total anthocyanin content, remains to be structurally unidentified. Blue 
wheat anthocyanins were thermally most stable at pH 1. Their degradation was 
slightly lower at pH 3 as compared to pH 5. Increasing the temperature from 65 
to 95 degrees C increased degradation of blue wheat anthocyanins. Addition of 
SO(2) during heating of blue wheat had a stabilizing effect on anthocyanin 
pigments. The optimal SO(2) concentrations were 500-1000 ppm for whole meals and 
1000-3000 ppm for isolated anthocyanins. Further studies are underway to 
identify and verify individual anthocyanins in blue wheat and their potential 
end uses.

Anthocyanin pigments from a wide variety of edible and ornamental black, blue, 
pink, purple, red, and white wheat, barley, corn, rice, and wild rice were 
identified and quantified to evaluate their potential as natural colorants or 
functional food ingredients. The total anthocyanin contents varied significantly 
and exhibited a range of 7-3276 microg/g. Some grains, such as red rice and 
black rice, contained a limited number of pigments, whereas others, such as 
blue, pink, purple, and red corns, had complex anthocyanin profiles. Of the 42 
anthocyanin compounds observed, 9 were characterized by comparison of the 
spectroscopic and chromatographic properties with those of authentic standards. 
The remaining compounds were tentatively identified on the basis of 
spectroscopic properties and electrospray ionization mass spectra. The most 
abundant anthocyanins were cyanidin 3-glucoside in black and red rices and in 
blue, purple, and red corns, pelargonidin 3-glucoside in pink corn, and 
delphinidin 3-glucoside in blue wheat.

Monomeric and oligomeric procyanidins present in cocoa liquors and chocolates 
were separated and quantified in four different laboratories using a 
normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with 
fluorescence detection. Procyanidin standards through decamers were obtained by 
extraction from cocoa beans, enrichment by Sephadex LH-20 gel permeation 
chromatography, and final purification by preparative normal-phase HPLC. The 
purity of each oligomeric fraction was assessed using HPLC coupled to mass 
spectrometry. A composite standard was then prepared, and calibration curves 
were generated for each oligomeric class using a quadratic fit of area sum 
versus concentration. Results obtained by each of the laboratories were in close 
agreement, which suggests this method is reliable and reproducible for 
quantification of procyanidins. Furthermore, the procyanidin content of the 
samples was correlated to the antioxidant capacity measured using the ORAC assay 
as an indicator for potential biological activity.

Epidemiologic studies revealed low mortality in hormone-dependent cancer in 
Japanese women and men consuming a traditional diet. We previously found that 
certain diphenolic food components, lignans and isoflavonoids, which are 
converted to biologically active hormone-like substances by intestinal 
microflora, may be cancer-protective agents. Therefore, we studied urinary 
excretion of these compounds (enterolactone, enterodiol, daidzein, equol, and 
O-desmethylangolensin) in 10 women and 9 men in a rural village south of Kyoto, 
Japan. The subjects consumed a typical low-fat diet with much rice and soy 
products, fish, and vegetables. An isotope-dilution gas chromatographic-mass 
spectrometric method was used for the assays. The urinary excretion of lignans 
was low but that of the isoflavonoids was very high. The excretion of 
isoflavonoids correlated with soybean-product intake. The low mortality in 
breast and prostate cancer of Japanese women and men, respectively, may be due 
to the high intake of soybean products.

Free and bound phenolic compounds including various phenolic acids and 
flavonoids contribute to the super-grain status of quinoa and amaranth. There 
were significant genetic diversity and similarities in the phenolic profiles of 
the grains of quinoa and different amaranth species. These phenolics 
significantly contributed to the health-promoting properties such as 
antioxidant, antihyperglycemic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Processing 
methods such as germination, fermentation, roasting, boiling, extrusion, 
microwave and radiation changed the phenolic profiles and related biological 
functions of the grains. Data inconsistencies among different studies were 
attributed to differing extraction and quantification methods, unit reporting, 
and limited genotype and species used, making direct comparisons across studies 
difficult. Furthermore, studies on biological activity of the phenolics remain 
limited to in vitro models and are scarce in in vivo or clinical trials. There 
is a need for standardized methodologies and optimized processing operations 
related to quinoa and amaranth phenolics for food and nutritional applications.

The health-promoting effects of whole-grain consumption have been attributed in 
part to their unique phytochemical contents and profiles that complement those 
found in fruits and vegetables. Wheat is an important component of the human 
diet; however, little is known about the phytochemical profiles and total 
antioxidant activities of milled fractions of different wheat varieties. The 
objectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of phytochemicals 
(total phenolics, flavonoids, ferulic acid, and carotenoids) and to determine 
hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity in milled fractions (endosperm 
and bran/germ) of three different wheat varieties, two of which were grown in 
two environments. Grain samples of each of the wheat varieties were milled into 
endosperm and bran/germ fractions. Each fraction was extracted and analyzed for 
total phenolics, ferulic acid, flavonoids, carotenoid contents, and hydrophilic 
and lipophilic antioxidant activities. Total phenolic content of bran/germ 
fractions (2867-3120 micromol of gallic acid equiv/100 g) was 15-18-fold higher 
(p < 0.01) than that of respective endosperm fractions. Ferulic acid content 
ranged from 1005 to 1130 micromol/100 g in bran/germ fractions and from 15 to 21 
micromol/100 g in the endosperm fractions. The bran/germ fraction flavonoid 
content was 740-940 micromol of catechin equiv/100 g. On average, bran/germ 
fractions of wheat had 4-fold more lutein, 12-fold more zeaxanthin, and 2-fold 
more beta-cryptoxanthin than the endosperm fractions. Hydrophilic antioxidant 
activity of bran/germ samples (7.1-16.4 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g) was 
13-27-fold higher than that of the respective endosperm samples. Similarly, 
lipophilic antioxidant activity was 28-89-fold higher in the bran/germ fractions 
(1785-4669 nmol of vitamin E equiv/g). Hydrophilic antioxidant activity 
contribution to the total antioxidant activity (hydrophilic + lipophilic) was 
>80%. In whole-wheat flour, the bran/germ fraction contributed 83% of the total 
phenolic content, 79% of the total flavonoid content, 51% of the total lutein, 
78% of the total zeaxanthin, 42% of the total beta-cryptoxanthin, 85% of the 
total hydrophilic antioxidant activity, and 94% of the total lipophilic 
antioxidant activity. Our results showed that different milled fractions of 
wheat have different profiles of both hydrophilic and lipophilic phytochemicals. 
These findings provide information necessary for evaluating contributions to 
good health and disease prevention from whole-wheat consumption.

This study presents the effects of soaking, cooking, and industrial dehydration 
treatments on phenolic profile and also on antioxidant properties in Pardina 
lentil. HPLC-PAC and HPLC-MS (ESI) analysis identified a total of 35 phenolic 
compounds in raw and processed lentil flours, corresponding to catechins and 
procyanidins (69% of the total of identified phenolic compounds), flavonols 
(17%), flavones, and flavanones (5%), and hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic 
compounds (5 and 4%, respectively). During the industrial process, catechins and 
procyanidins, flavonols, flavones, and flavanones decreased, while 
hydroxybenzoic compounds exhibited an important increase. In addition, raw 
lentils showed high values of the antioxidant activity (66.97 μmol Trolox/g); 
although the thermal processing promotes decreased, the levels of antioxidant 
activity were still relevant. Thus, the significant occurrence of bioactive 
phenolic compounds along with the interesting antioxidant capacity of dehydrated 
lentil flours make them useful for daily inclusion in the human diet as 
ready-to-use for special meals to specific populations.

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a lipid food, which constitutes a pillar of the 
Mediterranean diet. A high number of scientific data have demonstrated that it 
exerts a variety of beneficial effects on human health due to its peculiar 
chemical composition including fatty acids (98-99%) and other active compounds 
even if found in a very low percentage (1-2%). Among them, minor polar compounds 
(MCPs), represented mainly by phenolic compounds, are relevant for their healthy 
properties, as stated by the European Food Safety Authority's (EFSA) claims. In 
this paper, we described the results obtained from a pilot in vivo study, 
focused for the first time on the evaluation of the possible beneficial effects 
of two EVOOs on chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients after the consumption of 
40 mL per day for 9 weeks. The selected EVOOs, traced in the production chain, 
and characterized by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC-DAD-MS) 
analysis, resulted rich in MCPs and satisfied the EFSA's claim for their content 
of hydroxytyrosol and derivatives. The results obtained by this in vivo study 
appear to highlight the potential beneficial role in CKD patients of these EVOOs 
and are promising for future studies.

Fresh and sun-dried dates of three native varieties from Oman, namely, Fard, 
Khasab, and Khalas, were examined for their antioxidant activity and total 
contents of anthocyanins, carotenoids, and phenolics, as well as free and bound 
phenolic acids. All results are expressed as mean value +/- standard deviation 
(n = 3) on a fresh weight basis. Fresh date varieties were found to be a good 
source of antioxidants (11687-20604 micromol of Trolox equiv/g), total contents 
of anthocyanins (0.24-1.52 mg of cyanidin 3-glucoside equiv/100 g), carotenoids 
(1.31-3.03 mg/100 g), phenolics (134-280 mg of ferulic acid equiv/100 g), free 
phenolic acids (2.61-12.27 mg/100 g), and bound phenolic acids (6.84-30.25 
mg/100 g). A significant (p < 0.05) amount of antioxidants and carotenoids was 
lost after sun-drying of dates, whereas the total content of phenolics and free 
and bound phenolic acids increased significantly (p < 0.05). Anthocyanins were 
detected only in fresh dates. Date varieties had different levels and patterns 
of phenolic acids. Four free phenolic acids (protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, 
syringic acid, and ferulic acid) and nine bound phenolic acids (gallic acid, 
protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, 
syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and o-coumaric acid) were 
tentatively identified. Of the date varieties studied, Khalas, which is 
considered to be premium quality, had higher antioxidant activity, total 
carotenoids, and bound phenolic acids than other varieties. These results 
suggest that all date varieties serve as a good source of natural antioxidants 
and could potentially be considered as a functional food or functional food 
ingredient, although some of their antioxidant constituents are lost during 
sun-drying.

Four different colored carrots, orange, purple with orange core, yellow, and 
white, were examined for their content of phenolics, antioxidant vitamins, and 
sugars as well as their volatiles and sensory responses. A total of 35 volatiles 
were identified in all carrots, 27 positively. White carrot contained the 
highest content of volatiles, followed by orange, purple, and yellow. In total, 
11, 16, 10, and 9 phenolic compounds were determined for the first time in 
orange, purple, yellow, and white carrots, respectively. Of these, chlorogenic 
acid was the most predominant phenolic compound in all carrot varieties. 
Differences (p < 0.05) in relative sweetness, the contents of vitamin C and 
alpha- and beta-carotenes, and certain flavor characteristics were observed 
among the colored carrot varieties examined. Purple carrots contained 2.2 and 
2.3 times more alpha- and beta-carotenes (trace in yellow; not detected in 
white) than orange carrots, respectively. Purple carrot may be used in place of 
other carrot varieties to take advantage of its nutraceutical components.

The effect of roasting on taste-active components of 18 native hazelnut 
varieties, grown in the Giresun province of Turkey, was assessed. Samples were 
examined for their sugars, organic acids, condensed tannins, and free phenolic 
acids. Six sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose, myo-inositol, raffinose, and 
stachyose), seven organic acids (oxalic, maleic, citric, malic, lactic, 
succinic, and acetic), and one phenolic acid (gallic acid) were positively 
identified in natural and roasted hazelnut varieties; among these, sucrose, 
malic acid, and gallic acid predominated, respectively. Total sugars among 
hazelnut varieties ranged from 1.99 to 4.94 g/100 g, organic acids from 0.96 to 
2.72 g/100 g, condensed tannins from 3.99 to 40.56 mg of catechin equivalents/g, 
and gallic acid from 0.159 to 0.871 mg/100 g. Differences existed in the sugar 
and organic acid contents between natural and roasted hazelnut varieties, but 
they did not follow any particular trend. Significant losses (p < 0.05) in 
condensed tannins ( approximately 97.3%) and gallic acid ( approximately 66.7%) 
were noted when the hazelnuts were roasted. The present work suggests that 
roasting resulted in significant loss in condensed tannins and gallic acid due 
to the removal of the brown skin. The effect of roasting on sugars and organic 
acids was not noteworthy.

An analytical method based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) and followed by 
liquid chromatographic separation and ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) is 
proposed for the determination of 10 phenolic compounds which participate on 
beer stability and sensory properties in alcohol-free beers. Acetonitrile was 
found to be the most appropriate solvent for the elution of polyphenolic 
compounds adsorbed on C18 cartridges. The performance of the method was assessed 
by the evaluation of parameters such as absolute recovery (generally higher than 
60%), repeatability (lower than 10%), linearity (r2 higher than 0.993) and 
limits of quantitation (ranging from 1 to 37 microg/L); no matrix effects were 
observed. The polyphenol content of different Spanish alcohol-free beers is 
presented. Five phenolic compounds such as protocatechuic, p-coumaric, ferulic, 
caffeic acids, and (+)-catechin were identified at levels lower than 10 mg/L.

Polyphenols in the peel and pulp of 15 Basque cider apple varieties were 
determined by accelerated solvent extraction followed by reversed phase 
high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. It was 
observed that the polyphenolic composition in apple peel depended on varieties, 
whereas the main classes of phenolic compounds in apple pulp were flavan-3-ols 
and hydroxycinnamic acids in all cases, representing both together between 86 
and 95% of total polyphenols assayed.

The polyphenolic compositions of 31 Basque cider apple cultivars were determined 
in pulp, peel, and juice by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode 
array detection analysis of crude extracts and after thiolysis. Total 
polyphenols are distributed in a wide concentration range depending on the 
cultivar. Procyanidins are the class of polyphenols that present major 
concentrations in apple. Their average degrees of polymerization range from 4 to 
8 depending on the cultivar. Apple cultivars were technologically classified 
into bitter and nonbitter categories using different classification systems 
obtained by applying several pattern recognition techniques, such as principal 
component analysis, K-nearest neighbors, soft independent modeling of class 
analogy, partial least-squares, and multilayer feed-forward-artificial neural 
networks, to apple pulp, peel, or juice data (individual polyphenol 
concentrations, total procyanidin content, and the average degree of 
polymerization of procyanidins). Bitter apple cultivars present higher contents 
of flavan-3-ols and/or dihydrochalcones than nonbitter cultivars. Detailed 
knowledge of the polyphenolic profile of each apple cultivar affords information 
about their susceptibility to oxidation, their sensory properties (bitterness, 
astringency), and their possible influence on the characteristics and quality of 
the final product (juice, cider) when apples are processed.

Juices prepared from arils of 'Mollar' pomegranates were analysed for naturally 
occurring microorganisms, CIE Lab colour parameters, total phenols, anthocyanins 
and punicalagins, ellagic acid content and antioxidant capacity before and after 
low-, mild- and high-temperature pasteurisations (LTPs, MTPs and HTPs): 65, 80 
and 90 °C for 30 or 60s. Mean aerobic plate count (APC), yeast and mold count 
(YMC), and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) for fresh juices were 5.7, 5.36 and 4.0 
log CFU/mL, respectively. MTPs and HTPs were sufficiently effective to decrease 
APCs to nil or negligible levels. An increase in CIE a values and decrease in 
CIE b values were the characteristic colour changes in heat-treated juices. The 
effect of pasteurisations showed that total phenols, punicalagins and ellagic 
acid were not much affected by thermal processing. Total anthocyanin content and 
antioxidant capacity were substantially and significantly influenced by the heat 
treatment applied. A linear relationship was observed between Trolox equivalent 
antioxidant capacity (TEAC) values and total anthocyanins, suggesting that they 
contributed strongly to the antioxidant capacity of pomegranate juice.

Six selected phenolic aglycons (caffeic and ellagic acids, kaempferol, 
quercetin, myricetin, and morin) in nine types of berries, and their changes as 
influenced by jam processing, have been evaluated using optimized HPLC with 
diode-array detection. The berry samples, fresh and after jam processing, were 
analyzed, and the total amounts of selected phenolics as aglycons were 
identified and determined by acid hydrolysis. Their contents in fresh and jam 
samples did not indicate appreciable changes; therefore, the influence of jam 
processing on these selected phenolics in berries was suggested to be small, and 
was mostly present in berries as several conjugated forms that were 
glycosylated, esterified, etc., in the samples. The total phenolic content of 
each sample was also determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The three samples 
of each berry, namely fresh, jam, and acid hydrolysate of the berry, had similar 
total phenolic contents. On the other hand, the scavenging effect on the 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was measured, and acid hydrolysates 
showed stronger activity than that of the fresh and jam-processed samples for 
all of the berry types.

after single oral administration in human subjects.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hesperetin and naringenin, the aglycones of the 
flavanone glycosides hesperidin and naringin, occur naturally in citrus fruits. 
They exert interesting pharmacological properties such as antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, blood lipid and cholesterol lowering and are considered to 
contribute to health benefits in humans. However, no information is available on 
the pharmacokinetics of the citrus flavanones hesperetin and naringenin after 
their oral administration to humans as pure aglycones. Therefore, the objective 
of the present investigation was the evaluation of the pharmacokinetic 
parameters of hesperetin and naringenin in plasma and urine, after their single 
oral administration in humans in the form of solid dispersion capsules, and also 
to improve the absorption rate of flavanones by using aglycones rather than the 
naturally occurring glycosides.
DESIGN: Six healthy volunteers received orally 135 mg of each compound, 
hesperetin and naringenin, under fasting conditions. Blood samples were 
collected at 14 different time points over a 12 h period. Urine was collected 
over 24 h, in five sequential timed intervals. Plasma and urine hesperetin and 
naringenin concentrations, after enzymatic hydrolysis of their conjugated forms, 
were measured using validated high-pressure liquid chromatography methods. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters for hesperetin and naringenin, such as C(max), 
T(max), AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity), CL/F, V/F, t(1/2), MRT, A(e), A(e)((0-24)), 
and R(max) were calculated from their plasma or urine concentrations.
RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that both hesperetin and naringenin 
were rapidly absorbed and their concentrations in plasma observed 20 min after 
dosing and reached a peak in 4.0 and 3.5 h, respectively. The mean peak plasma 
concentration (C(max)) for hesperetin and naringenin were 825.78+/-410.63 ng/ml 
(2731.8+/-1358.4 nmol/l) and 2009.51+/-770.82 ng/ml (7386.6+/-2833.4 nmol/l), 
respectively and the mean AUC(0-infinity) values were 4846.20+/-1675.99 ng h/ml 
and 9424.52+/-2960.52 ng h/ml for hesperetin and naringenin, respectively. The 
elimination half-life for hesperetin was found to be 3.05+/-0.91 h and for 
naringenin 2.31+/-0.40 h, respectively. The mean values of the relative 
cumulative urinary excretion, as percentage of the administered dose, for 
hesperetin and naringenin, were found to be 3.26+/-0.44 and 5.81+/-0.81%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of the flavanone aglycones, hesperetin and 
naringenin, lead to their rapid absorption as their conjugated forms. The 
cumulative urinary recovery data indicated low bioavailability for both 
flavanone aglycones, owing to extensive first-pass metabolism partly by cleavage 
of the C-ring by the enzymes of intestinal bacteria leading to degradation 
products such as phenolic acids.

The ellagic acid, total phenolic, and vitamin C contents in four raspberry 
cultivars (Heritage, Autumn Bliss, Rubi, and Zeva) grown in Spain were detected 
and quantified by HPLC in fresh, just frozen, and stored fruits at -20 degrees C 
for a one year period. Ellagic acid [207-244 mg kg(-)(1) of fresh weight (fw)], 
total phenolic (137-1776 mg kg(-)(1) of fw), and vitamin C (221-312 mg kg(-)(1) 
of fw) contents in raw material were higher in the late cultivars Zeva and Rubi 
than in the early cultivars Autumn Bliss and Heritage. The freezing process 
slightly affected the values of extracted ellagic acid, total phenolic, and 
vitamin C content. At the end of long-term frozen storage (12 months), no 
significant change of total phenolic content extracted was observed, but 
significant decreases of 14-21% in ellagic acid and of 33-55% in vitamin C were 
quantified. Free radical scavenging capacity measured as antiradical efficiency 
(AE) depends on the seasonal period of harvest. Late cultivars, Rubi (6.1 x 
10(-)(4)) and Zeva (10.17 x 10(-)(4)), showed higher AE than early cultivars, 
Heritage (4.02 x 10(-)(4)) and Autumn Bliss (4.36 x 10(-)(4)). The freezing 
process produced a decrease of AE values in the four cultivars ranging between 4 
and 26%. During the frozen storage, the AE values reached after the freezing 
process remained unchanged.

The quantitative and qualitative evolution of the anthocyanins and volatile 
compounds of four raspberry cultivars (cvs. Heritage, Autumn Bliss, Zeva, and 
Rubi) growing in Spain were analyzed raw, just frozen, and during long-term 
frozen storage at -20 degrees C for a 1 year period. HS-SPME coupled with GC-MS 
and HPLC techniques were employed to study the evolution of the volatile 
compounds and the individual anthocyanins, respectively. The volatile aroma 
composition changes produced by the freezing process and long-term frozen 
storage were minimal. Only a significant increase in extraction capacity was 
obtained for alpha-ionone (27%) and for caryophyllene (67%) in Heritage at 12 
months of storage. The stability of anthocyanins to freezing and frozen storage 
depends on the seasonal period of harvest. Heritage and Autumn Bliss (early 
cultivars) were less affected by processing and long-term frozen storage (1 
year), and the total pigment extracted showed the tendency to increase 17 and 
5%, respectively. Rubi and Zeva (late cultivars) suffered a decreased trend on 
the total anthocyanin content of 4% for Rubi and 17.5% for Zeva. Cyanidin 
3-glucoside most easily suffered the degradative reactions that take place 
during processing and the storage period.

A number of potential antioxidants have been evaluated for their effect on 
formation of radicals in beer using the electron spin resonance (ESR) lag phase 
method. Sulfite was found to be the only compound that was able to delay the 
formation of radicals, whereas phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids, 
catechin, epicatechin, and proanthocyanidin dimers had no effect on the 
formation of radicals. Ascorbate, cystein, and cysteamin were on the other hand 
found to be prooxidants. It is suggested that antioxidants must be able to 
either scavenge peroxides or trap metal ions in order to be effective in beer. 
The effectiveness of sulfite is suggested to be a consequence of its 
two-electron nonradical producing reaction with peroxides.

Phenolic compounds are secondary plant metabolites which have long been 
associated with flavor and color characteristics of fruits and vegetables. These 
phenolic compounds attract great interest due to their postulated health 
protecting properties. However, adequate intakes and absorption rate of phenolic 
compounds are necessary for these beneficial effects. Until now, little is known 
about alterations of phenolic compounds content by the cooking process. In the 
present study, the influence of different volumes of cooking water on the amount 
of selected phenolic marker compounds resting in the vegetables was assessed. In 
zucchini, rutin was quantified as a marker for flavonoid glycosides. Chlorogenic 
acid, representative of phenolic acids was analyzed in carrots. In beans, rutin 
and quercitrin, both belonging to flavonoid glycosides, were investigated. In 
potatoes, chlorogenic and caffeic acid were determined. The cooking of zucchini, 
beans and carrots with smaller amounts of water resulted in significant higher 
content of phenolic phytochemicals in the vegetables compared to cooking with 
larger water volumes. For potatoes, which showed great variations in content of 
phenolic acids after cooking, no significant differences in phenolic acids was 
observed. It can be concluded from these observations, that real intakes of 
phenolic compounds from cooked vegetables are lower and that the amounts 
consumed are therefore overestimated.

BACKGROUND: The bread-making process influences bread components, including 
phenolics that significantly contribute to its antioxidant properties. Five 
bread model systems made from different rye cultivars were investigated to 
compare their impact on concentration of ethanol-soluble (free and ester-bound) 
and insoluble phenolics.
RESULTS: Breads produced by a straight dough method without acid addition (A) 
and three-stage sourdough method with 12 h native starter preparation (C) 
exhibited the highest, genotype-dependent concentrations of free phenolic acids. 
Dough acidification by direct acid addition (method B) or by gradual production 
during prolonged starter fermentation (24 and 48 h, for methods D and E) 
considerably decreased their level. However, breads B were enriched in soluble 
ester-bound fraction. Both direct methods, despite substantial differences in 
dough pH, caused a similar increase in the amount of insoluble ester-bound 
fraction. The contents of phenolic fractions in rye bread were positively 
related to activity level of feruloyl esterase and negatively to those of 
arabinoxylan-hydrolysing enzymes in wholemeal flour.
CONCLUSION: The solubility of rye bread phenolics may be enhanced by application 
of a suitable bread-making procedure with respect to rye cultivar, as the 
mechanisms of this process are also governed by a response of an individual 
genotype with specific biochemical profile.

The contents of pnenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers were quantified by 
HPLC analysis after alkaline hydrolysis in kernels of 17 rye (Secale cereale L.) 
varieties grown in one location in Denmark during 1997 and 1998. Significant 
variations (P < 0.05) with regard to the concentration of the analyzed 
components were observed among the different rye varieties and also between 
different harvest years. However, the content of phenolic acids in the analyzed 
rye varieties was narrow compared to cereals such as wheat and barley. The 
concentration of ferulic acid, the most abundant phenolic acid ranged from 900 
to 1170 microgram g(-1) dry matter. The content in sinapic acid ranged from 70 
to 140 microgram g(-1) dry matter, p-coumaric acid ranged from 40 to 70 
microgram g(-1) dry matter, and caffeic, p-hydroxybenzoic, protocatechuic, and 
vanillic acids were all detected in concentrations less than 20 microgram g(-1) 
dry matter. The most abundant ferulic acid dehydrodimer 8-O-4 -DiFA was 
quantified in concentrations from 130 to 200 microgram g(-1) dry matter followed 
by 8,5 -DiFA benzofuran form (50-100 microgram g(-1) dry matter), 5,5 -DiFA 
(40-70 microgram g(-1) dry matter), and 8,5 -DiFA (20-40 microgram g(-1) dry 
matter).

Major brands of cocoa powder products present in the Spanish market were 
analyzed for monomeric flavanols [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] and 
flavonols [quercetin-3-glucuronide, quercetin-3-glucoside (isoquercitrin), 
quercetin-3-arabinoside, and quercetin]. In addition, the influence of the 
manufacturing process of cocoa powder products, in particular, the 
alkalinization treatment ( Dutching), on the original content of these 
flavonoids has been studied. (-)-Epicatechin was in the range of 116.02-730.26 
microg/g, whereas (+)-catechin was in the range of 81.40-447.62 microg/g in the 
commercial cocoa products studied. Among flavonols, quercetin-3-arabinoside and 
isoquercitrin were the major flavonols in the cocoa powder products studied, 
ranging from 2.10 to 40.33 microg/g and from 3.97 to 42.74 microg/g, 
respectively, followed by quercetin-3-glucuronide (0.13-9.88 microg/g) and 
quercetin aglycone (0.28-3.25 microg/g). To our knowledge, these results are the 
first quantitative data in relation to the content of individualized flavonol 
derivatives in commercial cocoa powder products. The alkalinization treatment 
resulted in 60% loss of the mean total flavonoid content. Among flavanols, 
(-)-epicatechin presented a larger decline (67%, as a mean percentage 
difference) than (+)-catechin (38%), probably because of its epimerization into 
(-)-catechin, a less bioavailable form of catechin. A decline was also confirmed 
for di-, tri-, and tetrameric procyanidins. In the case of flavonols, quercetin 
presented the highest loss (86%), whereas quercetin-3-glucuronide, 
quercetin-3-arabinoside, and isoquercitrin showed a similar decrease (58, 62, 
and 61%, respectively). It is concluded that the large decrease found in the 
flavonoid content of natural cocoa powder, together with the observed change in 
the monomeric flavanol profile that results from the alkalinization treatment, 
could affect the antioxidant properties and the polyphenol biovailability of 
cocoa powder products.

Phenolic and orthodiphenolic compounds together with carotenoids, tocopherols, 
pigments, and fatty acids were tested for their antioxidant effect in 79 samples 
of virgin olive oils cv. Picual and Hojiblanca. A linear regression based on the 
oleic/linoleic ratio and the contents of phenols and tocopherols showed a good 
correlation (adjusted-R(2) = 0.91) with the stability measured by Rancimat, 
later verified with an external text set (adjusted-R(2) = 0.95). A tentative 
study on the percentage contribution of each chemical variable to stability is 
discussed. The contribution of phenolic and orthodiphenolic compounds was around 
51%, the composition of fatty acids 24%, and in less percentage 
alpha-tocopherol, carotenoids, and chlorophylls. No effect, or very little, was 
shown by beta- and gamma-tocopherols.

The objective of this work was to quantify the flavonoids present in foods most 
commonly consumed by the Brazilian population. The predominant flavonoids found 
in largest abundance in all of the analyzed vegetables were glycosides of 
quercetin. In lettuce, a small amount of luteolin was also detected. In sweet 
pepper, quercetin and luteolin were both present. White onion [48-56 mg/100 g of 
fresh weight (FW), expressed as aglycon], red onion (40-100 mg/100 g of FW), red 
lettuce (67-67.2 mg/100 g of FW), arugula (41-118 mg/100 g of FW), and chicory 
(18-38 mg/100 g of FW) were highest in total flavonoids. In fruits, the highest 
concentrations of flavonoids were found in the peel (125-170 mg/100 g of FW) and 
pulp (35-44 mg/100 g of FW) of oranges and in some apple varieties (14-36 mg/100 
g of FW). Variability in flavonoid content due to time of harvesting was high 
for leafy vegetables and red onions. The estimated ingestion by Brazilian 
population ranged from 60 to 106 mg/day.

Catechins, compounds that belong to the flavonoid class, are potentially 
beneficial to human health. To enable epidemiological evaluation of these 
compounds, data on their contents in foods are required. HPLC with UV and 
fluorescence detection was used to determine the levels of (+)-catechin, 
(-)-epicatechin, (+)-gallocatechin (GC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), 
(-)-epicatechin gallate (ECg), and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) in 24 
types of fruits, 27 types of vegetables and legumes, some staple foods, and 
processed foods commonly consumed in The Netherlands. Most fruits, chocolate, 
and some legumes contained catechins. Levels varied to a large extent: from 4.5 
mg/kg in kiwi fruit to 610 mg/kg in black chocolate. (+)-Catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin were the predominant catechins; GC, EGC, and ECg were detected 
in some foods, but none of the foods contained EGCg. The data reported here 
provide a base for the epidemiological evaluation of the effect of catechins on 
the risk for chronic diseases.

oral administration of trans-resveratrol (t-RES) to rabbits, rats, and mice. 
Half-life of RES in plasma, after i.v. administration of 20 mg t-RES/kg b.wt., 
was very short (e.g., 14.4 min in rabbits). The highest concentration of RES in 
plasma, either after i.v. or oral administration (e.g., 2.6 +/- 1.0 microM in 
mice 2.5 min after receiving 20 mg t-RES/kg orally), was reached within the 
first 5 min in all animals studied. Extravascular levels (brain, lung, liver, 
and kidney) of RES, which paralleled those in plasma, were always < 1 nmol/g 
fresh tissue. RES measured in plasma or tissues was in the trans form (at least 
99%). Hepatocytes metabolized t-RES in a dose-dependent fashion (e.g., 43 nmol 
of t-RES/g x min in the presence of 20 microM tRES), which means that the liver 
can remove circulating RES very rapidly. In vitro B16 melanoma (B16M) cell 
proliferation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was inhibited by 
t-RES in a concentration-dependent fashion (100% inhibition of tumor growth was 
found in the presence of 5 microM t-RES). Addition of 10 microM H(2)O(2) to B16M 
cells, cultured in the presence of 5 microM t-RES, reactivated cell growth. Oral 
administration of t-RES (20 mg/kg twice per day; or included in the drinking 
water at 23 mg/l) did not inhibit growth of B16M inoculated into the footpad of 
mice (solid growth). However, oral administration of t-RES (as above) decreased 
hepatic metastatic invasion of B16M cells inoculated intrasplenically. The 
antimetastatic mechanism involves a t-RES (1 microM)-induced inhibition of 
vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in the hepatic sinusoidal 
endothelium (HSE), which consequently decreased in vitro B16M cell adhesion to 
the endothelium via very late activation antigen 4 (VLA-4).

The effects of product and preparation variables on the in-cup chemical 
composition of tea extracts is of interest because the appearance and taste 
characteristics and the possible health effects of a tea liquor arise from the 
chemical components extracted from the leaf during tea preparation. A 
comprehensive study was therefore undertaken to determine the contributions of 
product and preparation variables on the total soluble solids, caffeine, and 
polyphenol contents of tea extracts. The results of this study show that the 
variety, growing environment, manufacturing conditions, and grade (particle 
size) of the tea leaves each influence the tea leaf and final infusion 
compositions. In addition, the composition of the tea infusion was shown to be 
influenced by whether the tea was contained in a teabag and, if so, the size and 
material of construction of the bag. Finally, the preparation method, including 
the amounts of tea and water used, infusion time, and amount of agitation, was 
shown to be a major determinant of the component concentrations of tea beverages 
as consumed. An illustration of the variation introduced by these product and 
preparation factors is provided by comparing solids, caffeine, and polyphenol 
contents of green and black tea infusions when commercial products are prepared 
according to the instructions given on their packaging.

The major flavanone-7-O-glycoside constituents in citrus fruit juices (naringin, 
hesperidin, neohesperidin, narirutin, and eriocitrin) were separated as 
diastereomers by multidimensional liquid chromatography. The method consisted of 
coupling two HPLC columns: a reversed-phase (RP(18)) column was used for the 
separation of flavanone glycosides, which were, then, individually switched into 
a carboxymethylated beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD)-based column and resolved as the 
corresponding stereoisomers. The method was used for the full analysis of 
flavanone glycosides in fresh hand-squeezed and commercial fruit juices by 
combining the quantitative estimation with the diastereomeric analysis. 
Quantitative data were in general consistent with previously reported data in 
this field. CC-LC isomer analysis was carried out by coupling the beta-CD column 
with a mass spectrometer operated with negative ion electrospray ionization 
(ESI-MS). The results showed that hesperidin was present in orange juices almost 
exclusively as the 2S isomer, whereas narirutin had mainly the 2R configuration. 
In grapefruit juices (2S)-naringin prevailed with the respect to the 2R isomer, 
whereas the opposite was true for narirutin. Lemon juices contained eriocitrin 
stereoisomers in equal amount (50% each), but hesperidin was almost exclusively 
found as the 2S isomer. Significant differences of the diastereomeric ratios 
were observed between freshly squeezed juices and juices from commercial 
sources.

The aims of the present study were to determine the level of (-)-epicatechin 
(EC) and its metabolites in rat plasma after oral administration of cocoa powder 
and to evaluate the protective effect of cocoa powder in terms of suppressing 
the oxidation of plasma components. Rats were orally administered 1 g cocoa 
powder/kg body weight, containing 7.80 mg EC, and their blood was collected 
before administration and at designated time intervals thereafter. The EC and 
its metabolites in plasma were treated with beta-glucuronidase and/or sulfatase, 
then analysed by HPLC and by liquid chromatography-MS. Several EC-related 
compounds were detected in plasma such as free EC, and glucuronide, sulfate, and 
glucuronide-sulfate conjugates of non-methylated or methylated EC. All EC 
metabolites showed a maximum concentration in plasma at 30-60 min 
post-administration. Glucuronide conjugates of both non-methylated and 
methylated EC were found in high concentration in plasma. Moreover, 
administration of cocoa powder significantly reduced the accumulation of lipid 
peroxides in plasma and significantly reduced the consumption of 
alpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with 
2,2'-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH (25 mmol/l)) or CuSO(4) 
(100 micromol/l) compared with that in the case of plasma obtained before 
administration. The total EC concentration in plasma was negatively correlated 
with the level of accumulation of lipid peroxides in plasma oxidized by 
treatment with AAPH (25 mmol/l) and was positively correlated with the level of 
residual alpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with CuSO(4) (100 
micromol/l). These results indicate that EC in cocoa powder was absorbed from 
the digestive tract, that various conjugated forms of EC were generated in the 
digestive tract and distributed to the plasma, and that these enhanced the 
antioxidative activity of plasma.

(-)-Epicatechin is a major polyphenol component of cocoa powder. The absorption 
and urinary excretion of (-)-epicatechin following administration of different 
levels of either cocoa powder (150, 750, and 1500 mg/kg) or (-)-epicatechin (1, 
5, and 10 mg/kg) were evaluated in rats. Both the sum of plasma (-)-epicatechin 
metabolites at 1 h postadministration and peak plasma concentrations increased 
in a dose-dependent fashion. The sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in urine, 
excreted within 18 h postadministration, also increased with dose. Moreover, the 
sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites excreted in urine reached the same level in 
both (-)-epicatechin and cocoa powder administration groups for equivalent 
amounts of (-)-epicatechin. These results suggest that, in the dose range 
examined in this study, bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin following 
administration of either (-)-epicatechin or cocoa powder shows dose dependence 
and that the various compounds present in cocoa powder have little effect on the 
bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin in cocoa powder.

We compared levels of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and their metabolites in 
rat plasma and urine after oral administration. Rats were divided into four 
groups and given (+)-catechin (CA group), (-)-epicatechin (EC group), a mixture 
of the two (MIX group) or deionized water. Blood samples were collected before 
administration and at designated time intervals thereafter. Urine samples were 
collected 0-24 h postadministration. (+)-Catechin, (-)-epicatechin and their 
metabolites in plasma and urine were analyzed by HPLC-mass spectrometry after 
treatment with beta-glucuronidase and/or sulfatase. After administration, 
absorbed (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were mainly present in plasma as 
metabolites, such as nonmethylated or 3'-O-methylated conjugates. In the CA and 
MIX groups, the primary metabolite of (+)-catechin in plasma was glucuronide in 
the nonmethylated form. In the EC and MIX groups, in contrast, the primary 
metabolites of (-)-epicatechin in plasma were glucuronide and sulfoglucuronide 
in nonmethylated forms, and sulfate in the 3'-O-methylated forms. Urinary 
excretion of the total amount of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in the EC group was 
significantly higher than the amount of (+)-catechin metabolites in the CA 
group. The sum of (+)-catechin metabolites in the urine was significantly lower 
in the MIX group than in the CA group, and the sum of (-)-epicatechin 
metabolites in the MIX group was also significantly lower than in the EC group. 
These results suggest that the bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin is higher than 
that of (+)-catechin in rats, and that, in combination, (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin might be absorbed competitively in the gastrointestinal tract of 
rats.

Erratum in
    Eur J Nutr. 2005 Feb;44(1):9.

BACKGROUND: Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural polyphenolic substance contained 
in many Lamiaceae herbs such as Perilla frutescens. Previous studies have shown 
RA has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activity. However, little is known on 
the absorption, metabolism, degradation and excretion of RA.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study in healthy humans was to determine the 
absorption, metabolism, and urinary excretion of RA after a single intake of 
perilla extract (PE).
METHOD: Six healthy men (mean age 37.2 +/- 6.2 y and mean body mass index 22.0 
+/- 1.9 kg/m(2)) were enrolled in the study that was a crossover design 
involving single intakes of PE containing 200 mg RA and placebo with a 10 day 
interval between treatments. Blood samples were collected before intake and at 
designated time intervals, while urine samples were collected over the periods 
0-6 h, 6-24 h and 24-48 h after intake. RA and its related metabolites in plasma 
and urine were measured by LC-MS.
RESULTS: RA, methylated RA (methyl-RA), caffeic acid (CAA), ferulic acid (FA) 
and a trace of m-coumaric acid (COA) were detected in the urine after intake of 
PE. In plasma, RA, methyl-RA and FA were detected, with maximum levels obtained 
0.5, 2 and 0.5 h after intake of PE, respectively. The majority of these 
components in both plasma and urine were present as conjugated forms 
(glucuronide and/or sulfated). The proportion of RA and its related metabolites 
excreted in the urine was 6.3 +/- 2.2% of the total dose, with approximately 75% 
of these components being excreted within 6 h after intake of PE.
CONCLUSIONS: RA contained in PE was absorbed, conjugated and methylated 
following intake, with a small proportion of RA being degraded into various 
components, such as conjugated forms of CAA, FA and COA. These metabolites were 
then rapidly excreted in the urine.

BACKGROUND: Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols such as catechins and 
procyanidins and has been shown in various models to inhibit LDL oxidation and 
atherogenesis.
OBJECTIVE: We examined whether long-term intake of cocoa powder alters plasma 
lipid profiles in normocholesterolemic and mildly hypercholesterolemic human 
subjects.
DESIGN: Twenty-five subjects were randomly assigned to ingest either 12 g 
sugar/d (control group) or 26 g cocoa powder and 12 g sugar/d (cocoa group) for 
12 wk. Blood samples were collected before the study and 12 wk after intake of 
the test drinks. Plasma lipids, LDL oxidative susceptibility, and urinary 
oxidative stress markers were measured.
RESULTS: At 12 wk, we measured a 9% prolongation from baseline levels in the lag 
time of LDL oxidation in the cocoa group. This prolongation in the cocoa group 
was significantly greater than the reduction measured in the control group 
(-13%). A significantly greater increase in plasma HDL cholesterol (24%) was 
observed in the cocoa group than in the control group (5%). A negative 
correlation was observed between plasma concentrations of HDL cholesterol and 
oxidized LDL. At 12 wk, there was a 24% reduction in dityrosine from baseline 
concentrations in the cocoa group. This reduction in the cocoa group was 
significantly greater than the reduction in the control group (-1%).
CONCLUSION: It is possible that increases in HDL-cholesterol concentrations may 
contribute to the suppression of LDL oxidation and that polyphenolic substances 
derived from cocoa powder may contribute to an elevation in HDL cholesterol.

Kakkalide is a major isoflavonoid from the flowers of Pueraria lobata (Willd.) 
Ohwi, possessing the protective effect against ethanol-induced intoxication and 
hepatic injury. The metabolism of kakkalide was investigated in rats. Thirteen 
metabolites were isolated by using solvent extraction and repeated 
chromatographic methods and identified by using spectroscopic methods including 
UV, IR, mass spectrometry, NMR, and circular dichroism experiments. Four new 
compounds were identified as irisolidone-7-O-glucuronide (M-1), 
tectorigenin-7-O-sulfate (M-2), tectorigenin-4'-O-sulfate (M-3), and biochanin 
A-6-O-sulfate (M-4) together with nine known compounds identified as irisolidone 
(M-5), tectorigenin (M-6), tectoridin (M-7), 
5,7-dihydroxy-8,4'-dimethoxyisoflavone (M-8), isotectorigenin (M-9), biochanin A 
(M-10), genistein (M-11), daidzein (M-12), and equol (M-13). The metabolic 
pathway of kakkalide was proposed, which is important to understand its 
metabolic fate and disposition in humans.

Phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of extra-virgin olive oils 
extracted from several Italian varieties were studied at production and during 
storage. The antioxidant activity was measured according to the following tests: 
in the aqueous phase, by radical scavenging of the 
2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical cation; and 
in the lipid phase, using the beta-carotene bleaching method. The phenolic 
content was not correlated to the oxidation indices (peroxide value and 
spectrophotometric constants). The phenolic contents and profiles of the various 
cultivars showed remarkable differences. The phenolic content was strongly 
correlated with the antioxidant activity measured according to the beta-carotene 
test and weakly correlated with the radical scavenging ability.

In the present paper, the following extraction techniques have been used for 
extracting isoflavonoids from the species Matricaria recutita, Rosmarinus 
officinalis, Foeniculum vulgare, and Agrimonia eupatoria L.: supercritical fluid 
extraction (SFE), pressurized fluid extraction, matrix solid phase dispersion, 
ultrasonic extraction in an ultrasonic bath (USE) and by means of an ultrasonic 
homogeniser (HOM), extraction by means of Soxhlet apparatus (SOX), and solid 
phase extraction. Experimental optimization of all techniques has been carried 
out using a soybean flour. Subsequent analyses of the extracts were carried out 
by liquid chromatography with UV detection. The maximum yields of daidzein and 
genistein were obtained by extraction with the SOX, USE, and HOM techniques. The 
maximum yields of apigenin and biochanin A from herb samples were obtained by 
SFE.

Four selected A. gangeticus accessions were evaluated in terms of color 
attributes, phytopigments, including betaxanthin, betacyanin, and carotenoid 
profiles, proximate, minerals, and antioxidant capacity (AC). Color attributes, 
phytopigments, proximate, minerals, and AC of A. gangeticus significantly varied 
across the accessions. For the first time, we identified four betacyanin 
compounds, such as amaranthine, iso-amaranthine, betanin, iso-betanin. We also 
identified five carotenoid compounds zeaxanthin neoxanthin, violaxanthin, 
lutein, and pro-vitamin A in A. gangeticus accessions. A. gangeticus contained 
adequate carbohydrates, protein, moisture, and dietary fiber. We found adequate 
iron, manganese, copper, zinc, sodium, molybdenum, boron, potassium, calcium, 
magnesium, phosphorus, sulfur in A. gangeticus accessions. The accessions LS7 
and LS9 had considerable color attributes, betacyanin, and carotenoid compounds, 
proximate, nutraceuticals, betalain, betaxanthin, and AC that could be used as 
preferable potent antioxidant varieties for consumption as sources of 
phytopigments, nutraceuticals, and antioxidants. The correlation study revealed 
that antioxidant constituents of A. gangeticus accession were strongly 
associated with AC. The identified components of betacyanin and carotenoid in A. 
gangeticus demands detail pharmacological study. The baseline data on color 
attributes, betacyanin, and carotenoid profiles, betaxanthins, betalains, and AC 
obtained in this present study could contribute to the scientific evaluation of 
pharmacologically active principles in A. gangeticus.

Four trichothecene-producing strains of Fusarium graminearum were grown on three 
maize grain fractions, whole grain, degermed grain, and the germ, to determine 
the effect of natural substrates on mycotoxin production. Monitoring the 
ergosterol content after 25 days of incubation indicated that fungal growth on 
all grain fractions was comparable. Trichothecene (TCT) production was highest 
on degermed grain, less on whole grain, and very low or nondetectable on the 
germ; similar results were found with four different strains. It was concluded 
that inhibitor(s) of TCT biosynthesis were present in maize germ. The presence 
of phenolic compounds was investigated in the different fractions. The 
hydroxamate 4-acetylbenzoxazolin-2-one (4-ABOA), a known inhibitor of mycotoxin 
production, was found in the degermed and whole grain fractions but not in the 
germ. Therefore, the TCT inhibition observed on the maize germ fraction used in 
our study is clearly not linked to 4-ABOA. Other soluble phenolic compounds were 
found at a much higher concentration in the germ than in the two other 
fractions. The inhibition property of the soluble ester-bound extracts was 
tested in liquid culture. A possible role for these compounds is discussed.

Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) Components: Interaction with Pro-Inflammatory 
Cytokines Focusing on Cancer and Skeletal Muscle Biology.

Turin, Italy.

The advantages of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) intake as part of a varied, 
healthy and balanced diet were demonstrated by many epidemiological studies. In 
particular, several components present in EVOO, such as tocopherols, carotenoids 
and phenolic compounds, play an important protective role in mitigating 
inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. 
The protective effect exerted by EVOO was proposed to be accounted for by its 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory or anti-proliferative properties. The present 
review will focus on the interactions among EVOO's components and 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, aiming to reveal the mechanisms potentially involved 
in the anticancer action of EVOO. Cancer patients very frequently develop a 
devastating syndrome known as cachexia, which negatively impinges on their 
outcome. The main features of cachexia include progressive body weight loss, fat 
and muscle wasting, and dysmetabolism, all of which partially result from the 
onset of systemic inflammation. In this regard, the possibility that EVOO could 
be beneficial to cancer patients by mitigating cachexia will be reviewed, 
focusing on the skeletal muscle.

Daidzein is an estrogenic isoflavone present in many plants and therefore 
consumed in relatively high doses by humans. Daidzein has a low affinity for the 
estrogen receptor (3 orders of magnitude lower than estradiol) and has been 
demonstrated to have estrogenic effects in rodents after administration of high 
doses. We have studied the disposition and biotransformation of daidzein in rats 
fed a diet low in isoflavone content. Four male and four female Fischer 344 rats 
were orally administered 100 mg/kg daidzein; excreted urine and feces were 
collected for 96 h and unchanged daidzein as well as formed metabolites were 
quantified by HPLC. In urine of male rats, daidzein, daidzein-glucuronide, and 
daidzein-sulfate were excreted; in females, only unchanged daidzein and 
daidzein-glucuronide were present. Total urinary excretion of daidzein accounted 
for < 10% of dose in both males and females. The major pathway of daidzein 
elimination was excretion of unchanged daidzein with feces. Reductive 
daidzein-metabolites likely formed by intestinal microflora (equol, 
O-desmethylangolensin) were excreted with feces in small amounts (< 5% of dose). 
Excretion of daidzein and metabolites with urine and feces was rapid with 
elimination half-lives of less than 12 h; daidzein concentrations in urine and 
feces were below the limit of detection 36 h after daidzein administration. The 
results suggest that daidzein is only poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal 
tract in rodents. Absorbed daidzein is rapidly eliminated both unchanged and as 
conjugates with urine. The inefficient absorption of daidzein from the 
gastrointestinal tract and the rapid excretion may explain the weak 
estrogenicity of daidzein seen in vivo in rodents when compared to other 
estrogenic chemicals with comparatively low affinity to the estrogen receptor.

A novel gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) method was 
developed, using an ion trap mass spectrometer, for the simultaneous 
determination of olive oil bioactive components, elenolic acid, hydroxytyrosol, 
and tyrosol, in rat urine. Samples were analyzed by GC-MS/MS prior to and after 
enzymatic treatment. A solid phase extraction sample pretreatment step with 
greater than 80% analytical recoveries for all compounds was performed followed 
by a derivatization reaction prior to GC-MS/MS analysis. The calibration curves 
were linear for all compounds studied for a dynamic range between 1 and 500 ng. 
The limit of detection was in the mid picogram level for tyrosol and elenolic 
acid (300 pg) and in the low picogram level for hydroxytyrosol (2.5 pg). The 
method was applied to the analysis of rat urine samples after sustained oral 
intake of oleuropein or extra virgin olive oil as a diet supplement.

Oleuropein (OE) is the cardinal bioactive compound derived from Olea europaea 
and possesses numerous beneficial properties for human health. However, despite 
the plethora of analytical methods that have studied the biological fate of 
olive oil-derived bioactive compounds, no validated methodology has been 
published to date for the simultaneous determination of OE, along with all its 
major metabolites. In this study, a liquid chromatography-electrospray 
ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS/MS) method has been developed and 
validated for the quantification of OE, simultaneously with its main metabolites 
hydroxytyrosol, 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid, 
4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methoxy-phenol or homovanillyl alcohol, 
2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid or homovanillic acid, and elenolic acid 
in rat plasma matrix. Samples were analyzed by LC-ESI MS/MS prior to and after 
enzymatic treatment. A solid-phase extraction step with high mean recovery for 
all compounds was performed as sample pretreatment. Calibration curves were 
linear for all bioactive compounds over the range studied, while the method 
exhibited good accuracy, intra- and inter-day precision. The limit of detection 
was in the picogram range (per milliliterof plasma) for HT and OE and in the 
nanogram range (per milliliter of plasma) for the other analytes, and the method 
was simple and rapid. The developed methodology was successfully applied for the 
simultaneous quantification of OE and its aforementioned metabolites in rat 
plasma samples, thus demonstrating its suitability for pharmacokinetics, as well 
as bioavailability and metabolism studies.

A microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) method has been applied for the first time 
to the extraction of the main lignan, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), 
and the two most concentrated hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in flaxseed. The 
effects of microwave power, extraction time and alkaline treatment were 
investigated. It was shown that a 3 min MAE resulted in an SDG content of 
16.1+/-0.4 mg/g, a p-coumaric acid glucoside content of 3.7+/-0.2 mg/g and a 
ferulic acid glucoside content of 4.1+/-0.2 mg/g. These values were compared 
with those obtained using conventional extraction methods and the results 
demonstrated that MAE was more effective in terms of both yield and time 
consumption.

A method was developed to determine the flavanols prodelphinidin B3, procyanidin 
B3, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin by high-performance liquid chromatography, 
using dual-channel electrochemical detection. This method was especially suited 
to the direct analysis of beer samples and to analysis of acetone extracts of 
barley samples, and was capable of determining proanthocyanidins and catechins 
at levels of 0.1-5.0 mg l-1. The use of dual-channel electrochemical detection 
also enabled unambiguous peak identification by measurement of collection 
efficiencies. This method offered improved sensitivity and selectivity compared 
with ultraviolet detection, and sample preparation procedures were greatly 
simplified. The method was applied to the comparison of stabilized and 
unstabilized lagers, and to the analysis of different barley varieties grown in 
Ireland.

To gain comprehensive insight into the interactions of key coffee odorants, like 
the Strecker aldehydes, acetaldehyde, propanal, methylpropanal, 2- and 
3-methylbutanal, and methional, and the nonvolatile fraction of coffee, an 
untargeted metabolomics approach was applied. Ultra performance liquid 
chromatography (UPLC)-time of flight (TOF)-mass spectrometry (ESI-) profiling 
followed by statistical data analysis revealed a marker substance for a coffee 
beverage spiked with acetaldehyde with an accurate mass of 217.0703 [M - H]-. 
This compound could be identified as a reaction product of quinic acid (QA) and 
acetaldehyde linked by acetalization at the cis-diol function of QA. 
Consequently, the acetalization of aldehydes, QA, 5-O-caffeoyl quinic acid 
(CQA), and quinic acid γ-lactone (QAL) was investigated by means of model 
reactions, followed by synthesis, isolation, and structure elucidation via 
UPLC-TOF-MS and 1D and 2D NMR techniques. UHPLC-MS/MSMRM screening and the 
quantification of aldehyde adducts in coffee beverages revealed the presence of 
QA/acetaldehyde, -/propanal, -/methylpropanal, and -/methional reaction products 
and CQA/acetaldehyde, -/propanal, -/methylpropanal, -/2- and 3-methylbutanal, 
and -/methional and QAL/acetaldehyde adducts for the first time, in 
concentrations of 12-270 μg/L for QA/aldehydes, 5-225 μg/L for CQA/aldehydes, 
and 62-173 μg/L for QAL/acetaldehyde. The sensory characterization of the 
identified compounds showed bitter taste recognition thresholds of 48-297 μmol/L 
for CQA adducts and 658 μmol/L for QAL/acetaldehyde, while the QA adducts showed 
no bitter taste (<2000 μmol/L).

The variation in flavonoid concentration and composition was investigated in 
baby spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) cv. Emilia sown on three occasions, each 
harvested at three growth stages at 6-day intervals. After harvest, leaves were 
stored in polypropylene bags at 2 or 10 degrees C. Flavonoids were analyzed by 
reversed phase HPLC. Twelve flavonoid peaks were detected. The main flavonoid, 
making up on average 43% of the total flavonoid concentration, was identified as 
5,3',4'-trihydroxy-3-methoxy-6:7-methylenedioxyflavone-4'-glucuronide. Four 
other flavonoids each contributed 7-12% of the total flavonoid content. Total 
flavonoid content was relatively stable during normal retail storage conditions, 
although some of the individual flavonoid compounds showed considerable 
variation. The youngest plants had the highest flavonoid concentration, 
indicating that by harvesting the baby spinach a few days earlier than the 
current commercial stage of harvest, the flavonoid concentration in the product 
may be increased and the content of potentially health-promoting compounds 
enhanced.

Table olives are a major component of the Mediterranean diet and are associated 
with many beneficial biological activities, which are mainly related to their 
phenolic compounds. Olive fruit debittering process defines the quantitative and 
qualitative composition of table olives in biophenols. The aim of the present 
study was to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant capacity and DNA-protective 
activity of an extract originated from brine samples, according to the Greek 
style debbitering process of Kalamon olive fruits. The main phenolic components 
determined in the brine extract were hydroxytyrosol (HT), verbascoside (VERB) 
and tyrosol (T). The in vitro cell-free assays showed strong radical scavenging 
capacity from the extract, therefore antioxidant potential. At cellular level, 
human endothelial cells (EA.hy296) and murine myoblasts (C2C12) were treated 
with non-cytotoxic concentrations of the brine extract and the redox status was 
assessed by measuring glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid 
peroxidation levels (TBARS). Our results show cell type specific response, 
exerting a hormetic reflection at endothelial cells. Finally, in both cell 
lines, pre-treatment with brine extract protected from H2O2-induced DNA damage. 
In conclusion, this is the first holistic approach highlighted table olive 
wastewaters from Kalamon- Greek style debittering process, as valuable source of 
bioactive compounds, which could have interesting implications for the 
development of new products in food or other industries.

Qualitative and quantitative differences among the constituents in various 
fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill., family Apiaceae) teas prepared by classical 
infusion, microwave decoction, and dissolution are reported. Different 
commercial starting materials, such as fruit (unbroken and crushed), four herbal 
teas, and two instant herbal teas were evaluated. Chlorogenic acid (1), 
quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide (2), p-anisaldehyde (3), and trans-anethole (4) 
were identified by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS as constituents of fennel teas. No 
coumarins, which are characteristic constituents of plants of Apiaceae family, 
were found. Trans-anethole (4), the main constituent of the essential oil, was 
present in all teas. In addition p-anisaldehyde (3), a degradation product of 
trans-anethole, was also identified in all teas with the exception of two 
samples. Chlorogenic acid (1) and quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide (2) were also 
present in all teas. In addition, minor unidentified flavonol constituents were 
found in two teas. Quality, activity, and safety of the content of the 
investigated preparations are also discussed.

All the pea varieties differed significantly (p < 0.05) in their phytic acid 
content. The field pea cultivars had significantly (p < 0.05) higher levels of 
phytic acid and polyphenols than those of vegetable pea varieties. All the 
domestic processing and cooking methods could reduce the contents of phytic acid 
and polyphenols but germination for 48 hours seemed to have a marked lowering 
effect on the levels of these antinutrients in peas.

The effect of gamma irradiation (0.5 and 1.0 kGy) and/or cooking on the 
proximate composition, mineral content, tannin content, phytic acid content and 
the in vitro protein digestibility (IVPD) of two Sudanese faba bean cultivars 
(BB7-S1 and SH-S2) was investigated in the present study. The results obtained 
revealed that gamma irradiation and/or cooking treatments have slight effect in 
chemical composition and mineral content, while they caused significant 
(P ≤ 0.05) reduction on tannin content for both cultivars. Cooking of faba bean 
seeds also insignificantly (P ≤ 0.05) reduced phytic acid content for both 
cultivars, while irradiation process and/or cooking had fluctuated effect. For 
both cultivars, irradiation of seeds and/or cooking increased the in vitro 
protein digestibility (IVPD), with maximum value of IVPD (79.97%) obtained for 
cultivar BB7-S1. The results indicate that the treatments used in this study 
might improve the nutritive quality of faba bean seed due to reduction in 
antinutritional factors with a concomitant increase in IVPD.

: This review focuses on the conditions required to increase and maintain the 
antioxidant nutrients in both extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and table olives 
(TOs) from the agronomic and technological practices to the gastronomy. The main 
antioxidants of TOs and EVOO are phenol alcohols and acids, secoiridoids, 
lignans and flavones, all of which possess the ability to prolong the oil's 
shelf-life and exhibit healthy properties for humans. The precise detection of 
secoiridoid derivatives remains the breakthrough for the nutritional and health 
quality certification of extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) required for EFSA 
health claims. To attain the necessary antioxidant quality in both EVOO and TOs, 
it is necessary to hard focus on the several steps in the production chain, 
including olive cultivar, agronomic conditions, harvesting methods, and 
transformation technology. The quality level is maintained if the storage 
conditions aim to minimize the oxidative processes that occur due to oxygen and 
light. In terms of minor polar biophenols, there is disagreement on which 
between the organic or conventional EVOOs show higher concentration values. The 
strict disciplinary of production of protected designation EVOOs does not ensure 
higher phenol values in comparison to the artisanal EVOOs. In gastronomy, the 
EVOOs are preferable to seed oils, particularly during frying vegetable. The 
EVOOs show higher heat stability, linked both to the fatty acid composition and 
the phenol content, that is important for preventing fatty acids oxidation. 
Concerning TOs, the commercial presentation includes olives and olive paste. 
Both products show a remarkable loss of natural antioxidants after 
pasteurization and during storage as the thermal treatment mostly impacts on TOs 
secoiridoids.

Health-promoting properties such as antioxidative, anticarcinogenic, and 
cholesterol-lowering effects are described for mangiferin and hesperidin, the 
major phenolic compounds present in Cyclopia genistoides (honeybush). However, 
knowledge of their metabolic fate and their absorption from the gastrointestinal 
tract is very limited. The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations 
of mangiferin, hesperidin, and their metabolites in plasma, urine, and feces 
samples from pigs consuming an extract of Cyclopia genistoides. Pigs were 
administered up to 74 mg mangiferin per kilogram of body weight and 1 mg 
hesperidin per kilogram of body weight per day for 11 days. Plasma samples were 
collected at various time points on days 9 and 11 of the study and days 1 and 2 
after termination of extract administration. Urine and feces were collected in 
fractions for 24 hours. In the plasma samples, the aglycone of mangiferin 
(norathyriol) was detected. Mean plasma concentrations ranged from 7.8 to 11.8 
mumol/L. Six metabolites of mangiferin and hesperidin were detected in the 
urine, including methyl mangiferin, norathyriol, its monoglucuronide, 
hesperetin, hesperetin monoglucuronide, and eriodictyol monoglucuronide. Between 
26.0% and 30.8% of the administered dose of hesperidin and only between 1.4% and 
1.6% of mangiferin could be detected in the urine on days 9 and 11 of the study. 
Approximately 8.2% of the administered dose of mangiferin was determined in the 
feces. The main metabolite was norathyriol. Neither hesperidin nor metabolites 
ascribed to hesperidin intake were detected. The results suggest that formation 
of norathyriol from mangiferin occurs in vivo, and specific metabolites were 
identified in blood and excretion products in urine and feces. This study will 
aid in investigating the physiological functions of the parent compounds in 
vivo.

BACKGROUND: Despite decades of research on the relation between soy and breast 
cancer, questions regarding the absorption, metabolism, and distribution of 
isoflavones in breast tissue largely remain unanswered.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the potential health effects of isoflavone consumption 
on normal breast tissue; isoflavone concentrations, metabolites, and 
biodistribution were investigated and compared with 17beta-estradiol exposure.
DESIGN: In this dietary intervention study, healthy women were randomly 
allocated to a soy milk (n = 11; 16.98-mg genistein and 5.40-mg daidzein 
aglycone equivalents per dose), soy supplement (n = 10; 5.27-mg genistein and 
17.56-mg daidzein aglycone equivalents per dose), or control (n = 10) group. 
After a run-in period > or = 4 d, 3 doses of soy milk or soy supplements were 
taken daily for 5 d before an esthetic breast reduction. Blood and breast 
biopsies were collected during surgery and analyzed with liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: After soy administration, genistein and total daidzein concentrations, 
which were expressed as aglycone equivalents, ranged from 135.1 to 2831 nmol/L 
and 105.1 to 1397 nmol/L, respectively, in hydrolyzed serum and from 92.33 to 
493.8 pmol/g and 22.15 to 770.8 pmol/g, respectively, in hydrolyzed breast 
tissue. The major metabolites identified in nonhydrolyzed samples were 
genistein-7-O-glucuronide and daidzein-7-O-glucuronide, with an overall 
glucuronidation of 98%. Total isoflavones showed a breast adipose/glandular 
tissue distribution of 40:60, and their mean (+/-SEM) derived 17beta-estradiol 
equivalents toward estrogen receptor beta were 21 +/- 4-fold and 40 +/- 10-fold 
higher than the 17beta-estradiol concentrations in adipose (0.283 +/- 0.089 
pmol/g, P < 0.001) and glandular (0.246 +/- 0.091 pmol/g, P = 0.001) fractions, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: After intake of soy milk and soy supplements, isoflavones reach 
exposure levels in breast tissue at which potential health effects may occur.

Olive oil is the main source of fat in the Mediterranean diet, and its 
consumption has been related to a low incidence of coronary heart disease and 
certain cancers. Recent findings demonstrate that olive oil phenolics are 
powerful in vitro and in vivo antioxidants and display other biological 
activities that could partially account for the observed healthful effects of 
the Mediterranean diet. A detailed method optimization plan was carried out to 
separate the most popular phenols in olive oil for four separation parameters: 
buffer concentration, buffer pH, applied voltage and temperature. Consequently, 
an analytical method capable of separating 21 different phenols and polyphenols 
by capillary zone electrophoresis was developed; the separation was performed 
within 10 min, using a 40 cm x 50 microm capillary, with a 45 mM sodium 
tetraborate buffer (pH 9.60), at 27 kV and 30 degrees C. The optimized method 
was applied to methanolic extracts of several Italian extra-virgin olive oils 
obtained by different technologies in order to characterize and to compare their 
antioxidant profile. Positive correlations of phenolic compounds found by 
capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and two colorimetric indexes (total 
polyphenols and o-diphenols) were found and discussed.

Phenolic compounds are found in both free and bound forms in cereals. The 
majority is in the insoluble bound form, that is, bound to cell wall material, 
such as ferulic acid and its derivatives. The antioxidant properties of the 
phenolic compounds in grains are associated with the health benefits of grains 
and grain products. The extraction capacity of several solvent mixtures, for 
extracting free phenols from barley flours, and the possibility of employing a 
rapid automated solvent extraction method were studied. The extraction yield of 
each method was evaluated by correlating several spectrophotometric indices 
(absorption at 280, 320, and 370 nm and total phenolic compounds by the 
Folin-Ciocalteu method) with the antioxidant activities of the barley extracts 
(scavenging activity by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl method). Interesting 
results were obtained when ethanol and acetone-based extraction mixtures were 
employed to extract free phenols. A comparison was made between alkaline and 
acid hydrolysis. The extraction yield of bound phenolic compounds increased when 
the digestion time for alkaline hydrolysis was prolonged.

Capillary electrophoresis (CE) can be effectively used as a fast screening tool 
to obtain qualitative and semiquantitative information about simple and complex 
phenolic compounds of extra virgin olive oil. Three simple phenols (tyrosol, 
hydroxytyrosol, and vanillic acid), a secoiridoid derivative (deacetoxy 
oleuropein aglycon), and two lignans (pinoresinol and acetoxypinoresinol) were 
detected as the main compounds in extra virgin olive oils by high-performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). 
Spectrophotometric indices, radical scavenging activity, and oxidative stability 
of extra virgin olive oil samples obtained from olives hand-picked at different 
ripening degrees were statistically correlated with the CZE and HPLC 
quantification. The concentration of phenols in extra virgin olive oil decreased 
with ripeness of olive fruits. The high correlations found between CZE and the 
other analytical results indicate that CE can be applied as a rapid and reliable 
tool to routinely determine phenolic compounds in extra virgin olive oils.

The red grape constituent resveratrol possesses cancer chemopreventive 
properties in rodents. The hypothesis was tested that, in healthy humans, p.o. 
administration of resveratrol is safe and results in measurable plasma levels of 
resveratrol. A phase I study of oral resveratrol (single doses of 0.5, 1, 2.5, 
or 5 g) was conducted in 10 healthy volunteers per dose level. Resveratrol and 
its metabolites were identified in plasma and urine by high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and quantitated by high-performance 
liquid chromatography-UV. Consumption of resveratrol did not cause serious 
adverse events. Resveratrol and six metabolites were recovered from plasma and 
urine. Peak plasma levels of resveratrol at the highest dose were 539 +/- 384 
ng/mL (2.4 micromol/L, mean +/- SD; n = 10), which occurred 1.5 h post-dose. 
Peak levels of two monoglucuronides and resveratrol-3-sulfate were 3- to 8-fold 
higher. The area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) values for 
resveratrol-3-sulfate and resveratrol monoglucuronides were up to 23 times 
greater than those of resveratrol. Urinary excretion of resveratrol and its 
metabolites was rapid, with 77% of all urinary agent-derived species excreted 
within 4 h after the lowest dose. Cancer chemopreventive effects of resveratrol 
in cells in vitro require levels of at least 5 micromol/L. The results presented 
here intimate that consumption of high-dose resveratrol might be insufficient to 
elicit systemic levels commensurate with cancer chemopreventive efficacy. 
However, the high systemic levels of resveratrol conjugate metabolites suggest 
that their cancer chemopreventive properties warrant investigation.

The fate of anthocyanins and ellagitannins in rats was monitored following 
ingestion of raspberry juice. After 1 h low nM concentrations of unmetabolised 
anthocyanins were present in plasma but these declined by 2 h and after 4 h they 
were no longer detectable. For the first 2 h there was an almost full recovery 
of anthocyanins as they passed from the stomach through the duodenum/jejunum and 
into the ileum. After 3 h less than 50% were recovered, and the levels declined 
rapidly thereafter. Excretion of raspberry anthocyanins in urine over a 24 h 
period was equivalent to 1.2% of the amount ingested. Trace quantities of 
anthocyanins were detected in the caecum, colon and faeces and they were absent 
in extracts of liver, kidneys and brain. Urine also contained a number of 
phenolic acids but most were present in quantities well in excess of the 918 
nmol of anthocyanins present in the ingested juice. These findings indicate that 
raspberry anthocyanins per se are poorly absorbed, probably prior to reaching 
the ileum, and that substantial amounts pass from the small to the large 
intestine where they are degraded by colonic bacteria. Ellagitannins disappeared 
in the stomach without accumulation of ellagic acid.

A healthy diet involves eating fruit and vegetables on a daily basis, the 
benefits of which are in part linked to the ingestion of bioactive compounds 
including polyphenols. As a convenient means of delivering additional 
polyphenols to the diet, a polyphenol-rich (P-R) juice drink was prepared and 
the bioavailability of its diverse spectrum of constituents investigated. Ten 
human volunteers followed a low-flavonoid diet for 2 days before drinking 350 mL 
of the P-R beverage. Plasma and urine were collected for 24 h and analyzed by 
HPLC-PDA-MS. The plasma pharmacokinetics and recoveries of urinary metabolites 
of flavan-3-ols, flavanones, dihydrochalcones and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, both 
in terms of their identity and quantity, were, in most instances, not markedly 
different to those reported in other feeding studies with green tea, orange 
juice, apple cider and coffee. This indicates that the combination of 
polyphenolic compounds in the P-R beverage are absorbed and excreted to a 
similar extent whether fed individually or together in a single beverage. It is 
concluded that the P-R beverage can deliver the intended blend of bioavailable 
polyphenols, which would normally require consumption of several different 
plant-derived foods.

Three seeds of Turkish origin, flax, poppy and safflower were analyzed for their 
proximate, fatty acids, tocols (tocopherols and tocotrienols) and total phenolic 
composition, and oxidative stability of their oil. The major fatty acid in the 
flax oil was alpha-linolenic acid, comprising 58.3% of total fatty acids, 
whereas poppy and safflower oils were rich in linoleic acid at 74.5% and 70.5% 
level, respectively. The amount of total tocols was 14.6 mg/100g flax, 
11.0mg/100g poppy and 12.1mg/100g safflower seed. Flax and poppy oil were rich 
in gamma-tocopherol as 79.4 mg/100g oil and 30.9 mg/100g oil, respectively, 
while alpha-tocopherol (44.1g/100g oil) was dominant in safflower oil. Only 
alpha- and gamma-tocotrienol were found in the oils. Oxidative stability of oils 
was measured at 110 degrees C at the rate of 20 L/h air flow rate, and poppy oil 
(5.56 h) was most stabile oil followed by safflower oil (2.87 h) and flax oil 
(1.57). There were no correlation between oxidative stability and unsaturation 
degree of fatty acids and tocol levels of the oils. All of the seeds 
investigated provide a healthy oil profile and may have potential as a source of 
specialty oils on a commercial scale.

Eight avenanthramides, amides of anthranilic acid (1) and 5-hydroxyanthranilic 
acid (2), respectively, and the four cinnamic acids p-coumaric (p), caffeic (c), 
ferulic (f), and sinapic (s) acid, were synthesized for identification in oat 
extracts and for structure-antioxidant activity studies. Three compounds (2p, 
2c, and 2f) were found in oat extracts. As assessed by the reactivity toward 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), all avenanthramides except 1p showed 
activity. Initially, the antioxidant activity of the avenanthramides decreased 
in a similar order as for the corresponding cinnamic acids, that is: sinapic > 
caffeic > ferulic > p-coumaric acid. The avenanthramides derived from 2 were 
usually slightly more active than those derived from 1. All avenanthramides 
inhibited azo-initiated peroxidation of linoleic acid. 1c and 1s were initially 
the most effective compounds. The relative order of antioxidant activities was 
slightly different for the DPPH and the linoleic acid assays run in methanol and 
chlorobenzene, respectively.

We have determined the absorption, conjugation and excretion of 
naringenin-7-O-rutinoside (narirutin) compared to the corresponding glucoside in 
an orange juice matrix in human subjects. Healthy volunteers (eight men and 
eight women), in a double blind, randomised, crossover study, consumed orange 
juice with (1) natural content of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside; (2) 
alpha-rhamnosidase-treated to yield naringenin-7-O-glucoside. Blood was sampled 
at twelve time points and three fractions of urine were collected over 24 h. The 
area under the plasma-time curve of naringenin from (2) 
alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice was increased about 4-fold (P < 0.0001), 
peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 5.4-fold higher (P < 0.0001) and Tmax was 
decreased from 311 to 92 min (P = 0.002) compared to untreated orange juice (1), 
indicating a change in absorption site from the colon to the small intestine. 
Furthermore, the amount in urine was increased from 7 to 47 % (P < 0.0001) of 
the dose after consumption of the alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice (2). 
All urine samples contained both naringenin-7- and -4'-O-glucuronides. In 
addition, to examine the effect of dose and alpha-rhamnosidase treatment on 
hesperetin conjugate profiles, a further treatment where (3) orange juice 
fortified with three times the original content of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside was 
used. Five hesperetin metabolites (3'-O-glucuronide; 7-O-glucuronide; 
5,7-O-diglucuronide; 3',7-O-diglucuronide; 3'-O-sulphate) were present after all 
treatments (1-3), with the same profile of the conjugates. The present data show 
that bioavailability of naringenin is increased by conversion from rutinoside to 
glucoside, but the profile of the conjugates of flavanones formed and excreted 
in urine is neither affected by the absorption site nor by a 3-fold change in 
dose.

Extraction methods to determine olive oil phenols are not exhaustive. A 
procedure to test their effectiveness, based on the treatment of the extracted 
oil with 2 N HCl followed by analysis of phenols in the aqueous phase, has been 
developed. It was concluded, using this test, that 15-40% of phenols remained 
unextracted when the liquid/liquid extraction method with 80% methanol was 
applied. Solid phase extraction (C(18) cartridge) succeeded in retaining most of 
the phenols in the cartridge, but the recovery yield from the sorbent material 
was low. However, a new extraction method, based on the use of 
N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as an extraction solvent, achieved a complete 
extraction of phenols from oils. The proposed method requires a lower amount of 
oil, solvents, energy, and labor than the traditional ones. Because of the low 
concentration of phenols in the DMF extract, the highly sensitive 
electrochemical detector (EC) technique was studied. All of the phenols detected 
by the traditional UV detectors were also detected by EC using a coulometric 
array system. A rapid and complete analytical methodology of phenols in olive 
oil has been proposed based on coupling DMF extraction and EC detection.

Oranges are rich sources of flavonoids that are bioactive and may protect 
against age-related diseases. The absorption of orange flavanones may be 
affected by factors such as processing and subject anthropometric variables, and 
the bioactivity of the absorbed phytochemicals depends on how they are 
metabolised during absorption. In a randomised cross-over study, twenty subjects 
consumed a single portion of orange fruit (150 g) or juice (300 g) that 
contained the flavanones narirutin and hesperidin, and an additional 109 
subjects across a broad age range (18-80 years) consumed the juice. Flavanone 
metabolites were measured in regularly collected samples of plasma and urine. 
After consumption of fruit or juice, flavanone conjugates, but not the 
aglycones, were detected in plasma and urine. The flavanone conjugates were 
shown to include the 7- and 4'-O-monoglucuronides of naringenin, the 7- and 
3'-O-monoglucuronides of hesperetin, two hesperetin diglucuronides and a 
hesperetin sulfo-glucuronide, but no aglycones or rutinosides. Analysis of the 
plasma pharmacokinetic and urinary excretion data on a dose-adjusted basis 
indicated no difference in absorption or excretion of either flavanone between 
the fruit and juice matrices. In the extended urinary excretion dataset the 
individual variation was very large (range 0-59 % urinary yield). There was a 
small but significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the excretion of hesperetin (but 
not naringenin) with increasing age (P < 0.05), but the effects of sex, BMI and 
contraceptive pill use were shown not to be associated with the variation in 
flavanone excretion.

Green tea seems to have a positive impact on health due to the catechins-found 
as flavanols. Thus, the present study was aimed to develop a low cost reversed 
phase high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for simultaneous 
determination of flavanol contents, namely catechin (C), epicatechin (EC), 
epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin 3-gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin 
3-gallate (EGCG) and caffeine in 29 commercial green tea samples available in a 
Saudi Arabian local market. A C-18 reversed-phase column, 
acetonitrile-trifluoroacetic acid as a mobile phase, coupled with UV detector at 
205 nm, was successfully used for precise analysis of the tested analytes in 
boiled water of digested tea leaves. The average values of N (No. of theoretical 
plates), HETP (height equivalent of theoretical plates) and R(s) (separation 
factor) (at 10 μg ml(-1) of the catechins EC, EGC, EGCG and ECG) were 
2.6×10(3)±1.2×10(3), 1.7×10(-3)±4.7×10(-4) cm and 1.7±5.53×10(-2), respectively. 
The developed HPLC method demonstrated excellent performance, with low limits of 
detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of the tested catechins of 0.004-0.05 
μg ml(-1) and 0.01-0.17 μg ml(-1), respectively, and recovery percentages of 
96-101%. The influence of infusion time (5-30 min) and temperature on the 
content of the flavanols was investigated by HPLC. After a 5 min infusion of the 
tea leaves, the average concentrations of caffeine, catechin, EC, EGC, ECG and 
EGCG were found to be in the ranges 0.086-2.23, 0.113-2.94, 0.58-10.22, 
0.19-24.9, 0.22-13.9 and 1.01-43.3 mg g(-1), respectively. The contents of 
caffeine and catechins followed the sequence: EGCG>EGC>ECG>EC>C>caffeine. The 
method was applied satisfactorily for the analysis of (+)-catechin, even at 
trace and ultra trace concentrations of catechins. The method was rapid, 
accurate, reproducible and ideal for routine analysis.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data showed that tomato and tomato product (sauce, 
paste) consumption is associated with a protective effect against the 
development of some chronic-degenerative diseases. Tomato antioxidant bioactive 
molecules such as carotenoids and polyphenols could be responsible, at least in 
part, for the healthy effect observed. The bioavailability of these compounds is 
an essential requirement to sustain their in vivo role. While it is well known 
that many factors can influence the bioaccessibility of carotenoids from the 
food matrix, there is little information about the factors affecting phenolic 
compounds' bioaccessibility.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This investigation was carried out to evaluate the effect of 
domestic cooking on the bioavailability in humans of antioxidant molecules after 
the administration of a test meal containing cherry tomatoes.
METHODS: A cross-over design was conducted. Subjects (3 females and 2 males) 
consumed experimental meals containing fresh and cooked cherry tomatoes. Blood 
collection was performed at different time intervals (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h).
RESULTS: Carotenoid and phenol plasma concentrations were measured. Plasma 
levels of lycopene and beta-carotene were not significantly different with 
respect to the baseline after ingestion of both the test meals, while plasma 
concentrations of naringenin and chlorogenic acid increased significantly with 
respect to the baseline (P<0.05) after administration of cooked cherry tomatoes, 
but not after administration of fresh cherry tomatoes.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated that domestically cooked tomatoes 
significantly increase naringenin and chlorogenic acid plasma levels. 
Considering that both naringenin and chlorogenic acid are widely studied for 
their potential healthy properties, evidence of their bioavailability and of the 
factors influencing their bioaccessibility is an important tool to sustain the 
possibility that these polyphenols play a biological role in human physiology.

The carotenoid and phenolic acid contents in fresh, stored and processed 
(blanched, frozen and boiled) spinach were comparatively determined by 
spectrophotometric and HPLC analyses. The major carotenoids identified after 
HPLC analysis in saponified samples were lutein (37-53μg/kg), β-carotene 
(18-31μg/kg), violaxanthin (9-23μg/kg) and neoxanthin (10-22μg/kg). These 
carotenoids were all affected by storage and/or heating. The content of 
carotenoids was best preserved after storage for one day at 4°C. The total 
phenolic content in the fresh spinach was 2088mg GAE/kg FW. After LC-MS analysis 
three phenolic acids were identified and quantified. These being ortho-coumaric 
acid (28-60mg/kg FW), ferulic acid (10-35mg/kg) and para-coumaric acid 
(1-30mg/kg) depending on the sample type. After storage of spinach at different 
temperatures (4°C or -18°C) the amount of total phenolic compounds decreased by 
around 20%, while the amount of individual phenolic acids increased by four 
times on average.

The polyphenol trans-resveratrol (t-RES) is present as 
t-RES-3-O-beta-D-glycoside, termed piceid, in several plant-derived foods. 
Although data on the metabolism and on in vivo effects of t-RES have been 
reported, quantitative data on the metabolites formed after dietary intake of 
t-RES or piceid are still lacking. In this study, 85.5 mg of piceid per 70 kg of 
body weight (bw) were administered to healthy volunteers in a bolus dose. t-RES 
metabolites formed in plasma and urine were identified and quantified by 
LC-MS/MS, NMR, and HPLC-DAD analysis using chemically synthesized t-RES 
conjugate standards. In addition, the amount of t-RES metabolites bound 
noncovalently to plasma proteins was determined for the first time in humans. 
The metabolites identified and quantified were t-RES-3-sulfate, 
t-RES-3,4'-disulfate, t-RES-3,5-disulfate, t-RES-3-glucuronide and 
t-RES-4'-glucuronide, with t-RES-sulfates being the dominant conjugates in 
plasma and urine. Besides these metabolites, two novel t-RES-C/O-conjugated 
diglucuronides have been identified and quantified in plasma and urine. 
Moreover, it could be shown that up to 50% of the plasma t-RES-3-sulfate, 
t-RES-disulfates, and the novel t-RES-C/O-diglucuronides were bound to proteins. 
Total recovery of the dietary administered piceid in urine ranged between 13.6 
and 35.7%.

The relationship among antioxidant activity, based on the electron-spin 
resonance determination of the reduction of Fremy's radical, vasodilation 
activity, and phenolic content was investigated in 16 red wines. The wines were 
selected to provide a range of origins, grape varieties, and vinification 
methods. Sensitive and selective HPLC methods were used for the analysis of the 
major phenolics in red wine: free and conjugated myricetin, quercetin, 
kaempferol, and isorhamnetin; (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, gallic acid, 
p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, caftaric acid, trans-resveratrol, 
cis-resveratrol, and trans-resveratrol glucoside. Total anthocyanins were 
measured using a colorimetric assay. The total phenolic content of the wines was 
determined according to the Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric assay and also by the 
cumulative measurements obtained by HPLC. The 16 wines exhibited a wide range in 
the values of all parameters investigated. However, the total phenol contents, 
measured both by HPLC and colorimetrically, correlated very strongly with the 
antioxidant activity and vasodilation activity. In addition, the antioxidant 
activity was associated with gallic acid, total resveratrol, and total catechin. 
In contrast, only the total anthocyanins were correlated with vasodilation 
activity. The results demonstrate that the different phenolic profiles of wines 
can produce varying antioxidant and vasodilatant activities, which opens up the 
possibility that some red wines may provide enhanced health benefits for the 
consumer.

Resveratrol and the biosynthetically related stilbenes are plant secondary 
metabolites with diverse pharmacological effects. The versatile functions of 
these compounds in plant defense mechanisms as phytoalexins on one hand, and in 
human health as potential pharmaceutical agents on the other, have attracted 
lots of interest in recent years to understand their biosynthetic pathways and 
their biological properties. Because of difficulties in obtaining resveratrol 
and its glucosylated derivatives as well as oligomeric forms in sufficient 
amounts for evaluation of their activity by plant sourcing or total synthesis, 
biotechnology may provide a competitive approach for the large-scale and low 
cost production of biologically active stilbenes. Additionally, one major 
limitation in the use of resveratrol and related aglycone derivatives as 
therapeutic agents is associated with their inherent poor aqueous solubility and 
low bioavailability. This article examines approaches for the synthesis of 
potential pharmacologically resveratrol derivatives in vivo by exploiting whole 
microorganisms, enzymatic and biocatalytic approaches allowing their full 
utilization for medicine, food and cosmetic applications. These methods also 
have the advantage of enabling the one-step production of stilbene compounds, 
compared to the time-consuming and environmentally unfriendly procedures used 
for their total synthesis or their extraction from plants. Increasing the 
desired products yield and biological activity through glucosylation 
(β-D-glucosides versus α-D-glucosides) and oligomerization methodologies of 
resveratrol including green chemistry methods in organic solvent-free media are 
discussed as well.

This study evaluated the diversity of 68 faba bean accessions grown in the 
Republic of Korea, focusing on variations in antinutrient factors, nutritional 
composition, fatty acids, lipid quality, antioxidant activity, and key 
agronomical traits. All parameters showed significant variations, indicating 
broad genetic diversity. Vicine and convicine were detected in all accessions 
using UHPLC-MS/MS, with their concentrations varying more than threefold. Total 
phenol (1.65-4.38 mg GAE/g), saponin (4.12-9.50 mg DE/g), and tannin 
(1.70-9.47 mg CE/g) contents showed coefficients of variation (CV) above 18.00%. 
Similarly, crude fiber (3.42%-10.85%), dietary fiber (9.18%-25.47%), total 
protein (21.68%-34.40%), and total fat (0.90%-1.99%) contents exhibited wide 
variations (CV > 9.50%). Palmitic acid (15.13%-18.73%) and linoleic acid 
(38.51%-54.93%) were the dominant saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, 
respectively. Antioxidant activities, including DPPH• scavenging activity 
(0.40-2.33 mg AAE/g), ABTS•+ scavenging activity (1.87-7.26 mg TE/g), and ferric 
reducing antioxidant power (0.67-4.94 mg AAE/g) varied significantly, all with 
CVs over 25.00%. Green genotypes exhibited significantly higher tannin, fibers, 
and palmitic and total saturated fatty acids, while yellow genotypes showed 
higher antioxidant activities, total unsaturated fatty acids, and lipid quality 
indices. Cluster and principal component analyses differentiated accessions 
based on their overall biochemical profile. Accession VF050 was identified for 
its low antinutrient content, VF012 and VF004 for distinct antioxidant 
potential, VF062, VF027, and VF012 for lipid quality, VF032, VF009, and VF018 
for high fiber, VF041 and VF057 for high protein, and VF019 and VF027 for 
agronomic performance. These accessions could serve as valuable materials for 
food innovation, crop improvement, and cultivation.

This study explored plasma levels and urinary and fecal excretion of metabolites 
and microbial-derived catabolites over a 24 h period following the ingestion of 
red wine (RWP) or grape seed (GSP) proanthocyanidin-rich extracts by rats. In 
total, 35 structurally-related (epi)catechin metabolites (SREMs) and 5-carbon 
side chain ring fission metabolites (5C-RFMs) (phenyl-γ-valerolactones and 
phenylvaleric acids), and 50 phenolic acid and aromatic catabolites were 
detected after intakes of both extracts. The consumption of the RWP extract, but 
not the GSP extract, led to the appearance of a ∼200 nmol L-1 peak plasma 
concentration of SREMs formed from flavan-3-ol monomers. In contrast, ingestion 
of the GSPs, but not the RWPs, resulted in a substantial increase in 
microbiota-derived 5-carbon side chain ring fission metabolites (5C-RFMs) in 
plasma. 5C-RFMs, along with low molecular weight phenolic catabolites were 
detected in urine after ingestion of both extracts. The GSP and RWP extracts had 
respective mean degrees of polymerisation 5.9 and 6.5 subunits, and the RWP 
extract had an upper polymer size of 21 subunits compared to 44 subunits for the 
GSP extract. The differences in plasma metabolite profiles might, therefore, be 
a consequence of this polydispersity impacting on the microbiota-mediated rates 
of cleavage of the proanthocyanidin subunits and their subsequent metabolism and 
absorption. Urinary excretion of phenolic catabolites indicated that 11% of RWPs 
and 7% for GSPs were subjected to microbial degradation. In all probability 
these figures, rather than representing the percentage of proanthocyanidins that 
are completely degraded, indicate partial cleavage of monomer subunits producing 
a much higher percentage of shortened proanthocyanidin chains. Obtaining more 
detailed information on the in vivo fate of proanthocyanidins is challenging 
because of the difficulties in analysing unabsorbed parent proanthocyanidins and 
their partially degraded flavan-3-ol subunit chains in feces. Further progress 
awaits the development of improved purification and analytical techniques for 
proanthocyanidins and their use in feeding studies, and in vitro fecal and 
bacterial incubations, with radio and/or stable isotope-labelled substrates.

PURPOSE: The flavones apigenin and tricin, which occur in leafy vegetables and 
rice bran, respectively, possess cancer chemopreventive properties in 
preclinical rodent models. Their pharmacology is only poorly understood. We 
compared their tissue levels in mice in vivo and their metabolism in liver 
fractions in vitro.
METHODS: Mice received apigenin or tricin (0.2%) with their diet for 5-7 days, 
and flavone levels were compared in the plasma, liver and gastrointestinal 
mucosa using HPLC-UV. Flavone metabolism was investigated in murine and human 
liver microsomes or cytosol in vitro co-incubated with uridine 
5'-diphosphoglucuronic acid or 3'-phosphoadenosine-5' phosphosulfate. Flavone 
metabolites were characterized by on-line HPLC-mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: After dietary administration of flavones for 7 days, levels of tricin 
in plasma, liver and mucosa exceeded those of apigenin by 350, 33 and 100%, 
respectively. Apigenin was more rapidly glucuronidated than tricin in liver 
microsomes, whilst tricin underwent swifter sulfonation than apigenin in liver 
cytosol. For either flavone the rate of glucuronidation was much faster than 
that of sulfonation. Flavone monoglucuronides and monosulfates were identified 
as metabolites in microsomal and cytosolic incubations, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: When consumed with the diet in mice tricin seems to be more 
available than apigenin in blood and tissues. Differences in their 
glucuronidation may account for their differential availability. Thus tricin may 
have a pharmacokinetic advantage over apigenin. This type of information may 
help decide which flavonoids to select for clinical development.

Although lettuce may provide relatively low levels of antioxidative 
phytochemicals which may contribute to human health, lettuce leaf extracts in 
fact contained compounds with high specific peroxyl radical scavenging 
activities. After determining the extraction conditions that minimized phenolic 
oxidation and produced the highest oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) 
values, the phenolic compounds from red leaf lettuce were separated by 
reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The primary 
phenolic compounds in the leaf tissue extracts were mono- and dicaffeoyltartaric 
acid (CTA and DCTA), mono- and dicaffeoylquinic acid (CQA and DCQA), quercetin 
3-malonylglucoside (QMG), quercetin 3-glucoside (QG), cyanidin 
3-malonylglucoside (CMG), and an unknown phenolic ester (UPE). Significant 
levels of DCQA were only found after wounding. Using the new fluorescein-based 
ORAC assay procedures, fractions from the HPLC analyses were assayed for peroxyl 
radical absorbance capacity. Using absorbance to estimate concentration, the 
decreasing order of contribution to the total ORAC value of an extract from 
wounded tissue was QMG > DCQA > CMG > DCTA > UPE > QG > CTA. The decreasing 
order of the specific peroxyl radical scavenging activities was CMG > QG > DCTA 
> DCQA > QMG > UPE > CQA > CTA. Since the concentrations of plant flavonoid and 
phenolic acid esters are sensitive to environmental factors, this information 
may be used to develop pre- and postharvest conditions which increase the 
dietary benefits of leaf lettuce.

BACKGROUND: Anthocyanins are potent antioxidants that are widely distributed in 
fruit, vegetables, and red wines. Anthocyanin products are also prescribed as 
medicines in many countries for treating various diseases. However, the 
pharmacokinetics of dietary anthocyanins are not known in humans because these 
glycosides were long considered nonabsorbable.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether anthocyanins can 
be absorbed as glycosides and to evaluate their pharmacokinetics in humans.
DESIGN: Four healthy elderly women consumed 720 mg anthocyanins. A series of 
blood and urine samples were collected before and after consumption of the 
anthocyanins. Anthocyanins were measured in plasma and urine by combining an 
octadecylsilane solid-phase extraction for sample preparation and an HPLC system 
with diode array for anthocyanin separation and detection. The structures of 
anthocyanins as glycosides in plasma and urine were further confirmed by using 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Anthocyanins were detected as glycosides in plasma and urine. The 
maximum plasma concentration of total anthocyanins varied from 55.3 to 168.3 
nmol/L, with an average of 97.4 nmol/L, and was reached within 71.3 min. The 
elimination of plasma anthocyanins appeared to follow first-order kinetics. The 
elimination half-life of plasma total anthocyanins was calculated to be 132.6 
min. Most anthocyanin compounds were excreted in urine during the first 4 h. The 
excretion rate of total anthocyanins was 77 microg/h during the first 4 h and 13 
microg/h during the second 4 h.
CONCLUSION: Anthocyanins are absorbed in their unchanged glycated forms in 
elderly women.

French wines are abundant sources of phenolic compounds. The content of several 
catechins, i.e., (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4, 
trimers C1, and trimer 2 (T2), of 160 French wines was determined by HPLC with 
UV detection. Red wines (n = 95) were found to have high levels of catechins, 
ranging from 32.8 to 209.8 mg/L (mean concentration 114.5 mg/L) for 
(+)-catechin, from 22.1 to 130.7 mg/L (mean concentration 75.7 mg/L) for 
(-)-epicatechin, from 7.8 to 39.1 mg/L (mean concentration 25.4 mg/L) for B1, 
from 18.3 to 93 mg/L (mean concentration 47.4 mg/L) for B2, from 21.4 to 215.6 
mg/L (mean concentration 119.6 mg/L) for B3, from 20.2 to 107.2 mg/L (mean 
concentration 81.9 mg/l) for B4, from 8.6 to 36.9 mg/L (mean concentration 26.3 
mg/L) for C1, and from 26.7 to 79.3 mg/L (mean concentration 67.1 mg/L) for T2. 
White and rosé wines (n = 57 and n = 8) were found to have low levels of 
(+)-catechin (mean concentrations 9.8 and 10.6 mg/L, respectively) and 
(-)-epicatechin (mean concentrations 5.3 and 6.5 mg/L, respectively). These data 
provide a basis for the epidemiological evaluation of catechin intake by the 
consumption of French wine.

A capillary zone electrophoresis method has been carried out to determine and 
quantitate some compounds of the polyphenolic fraction of virgin olive oil which 
have never previously been determined before using capillary electrophoresis, 
such as elenolic acid, ligstroside aglycon, oleuropein aglycon, and 
(+)-pinoresinol. The compounds were identified using standards obtained by 
semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A detailed method 
optimization was performed to separate the phenolic compounds present in olive 
oil using a methanol-water extract of Picual extra-virgin olive oil, and 
different extraction systems were compared (C18-solid phase extraction (SPE), 
Diol-SPE, Sax-SPE and liquid-liquid extraction). The optimized parameters were 
30 mM sodium tetraborate buffer (pH 9.3) at 25 kV with 8 s hydrodynamic 
injection, and the quantitation was carried out by the use of two reference 
compounds at two different wavelengths.

Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is one of the most important legume crops for 
human consumption because of its nearly perfect nutritional composition. 
However, the crop yield is invariably constrained by phosphorus (P) stress 
across all farming systems. The present study aimed to unravel the mechanistic 
basis of common bean response to P stress at the early vegetative phase using an 
integrated multi-omic approach. In vitro experiments were carried out with P 
sufficient (P+) and total P deficient (P-) treatments using common bean SFB-1 
seed cultivar. The plants were grown in MGRL media for a duration of three 
weeks. Various morphological traits were significantly reduced under P- stress 
conditions. There was a significant decrease in the levels of biochemical 
parameters such as free amino acids, secondary metabolites, and osmolytes 
(proline, total soluble sugars, and glycine betaine) under P- growth conditions. 
Additionally, photosynthetic pigments (such as chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, 
total chlorophyll, and total carotenoids), physiological parameters (such as 
relative water content and stress injury), as well as both enzymatic and 
non-enzymatic antioxidants (including catalase, peroxidase, superoxide 
dismutase, total phenolics, and flavonoids), were also significantly reduced. 
Proteomic analysis identified two key proteins, homocysteine methyltransferase 
and DDB1-CUL4 associated factor 1-like protein, which are involved in various 
stress adaptation pathways. Furthermore, techniques such as FTIR spectroscopy, 
SEM, SEM-EDX, and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy were used to validate the 
metabolic changes induced by phosphorus deficiency. Phosphorus deficiency led to 
profound metabolic changes affecting photosynthesis, defense-related protein 
expression, cell wall composition, secondary metabolite production, levels of 
phytohormone precursors, free amino acids, antioxidant activity, and osmolyte 
accumulation, all of which contributed to inhibited plant growth and 
development.

The capabilities of spectrophotometric and electrochemical detection techniques 
were investigated for the high-performance liquid chromatographic determination 
of flavonoids. Liquid chromatographic analyses were performed on eleven 
compounds belonging to three different classes of flavonoids: flavanone 
glycosides, flavone and flavonol aglycones. Separation of all compounds examined 
was carried out under reversed-phase conditions on a C18 narrow-bore column for 
UV detection, whereas for electrochemical detection, a C18 standard-bore column 
was used. UV analyses were carried out at 280 nm for flavanones and at 265 nm 
for flavones and flavonols, whereas controlled-potential coulometric 
measurements were performed using a porous graphite electrode. Analytical 
performances of the methods were compared in terms of linearity, limits of 
detection (LODs) and precision. Linearity over two orders of magnitude and LODs 
at low-ppm levels (0.06-1 mg/l) were demonstrated for all techniques considered. 
Instrumental precision in terms of relative standard deviation was found to be 
between 0 and 5% for the liquid chromatography (LC)-UV system and between 0.6 
and 10% for the LC-electrochemical detection (ED) system. The methods developed 
were applied to the analysis of flavanones and flavonols in a real sample, such 
as an extract of orange juice. Even though quercetin glycoside is mostly present 
in orange juice as rutin, other different glycosides of this flavonol could be 
present; on this basis, the hydrolysis of all glycosides to aglycone allows one 
to obtain more accurate data on the flavonol concentration in orange juice. To 
avoid sample degradation and to increase extraction efficiency, quercetin 
hydrolysis was optimized using a central composite design to investigate the 
effects of acid concentration and hydrolysis time on extraction recovery.

The present study aims first to compare the antioxidant microconstituent 
contents between organically and conventionally grown tomatoes and, second, to 
evaluate whether the consumption of purees made of these tomatoes can 
differently affect the plasma levels of antioxidant microconstituents in humans. 
When results were expressed as fresh matter, organic tomatoes had higher vitamin 
C, carotenoids, and polyphenol contents (except for chlorogenic acid) than 
conventional tomatoes. When results were expressed as dry matter, no significant 
difference was found for lycopene and naringenin. In tomato purees, no 
difference in carotenoid content was found between the two modes of culture, 
whereas the concentrations of vitamin C and polyphenols remained higher in 
purees made out of organic tomatoes. For the nutritional intervention, no 
significant difference (after 3 weeks of consumption of 96 g/day of tomato 
puree) was found between the two purees with regard to their ability to affect 
the plasma levels of the two major antioxidants, vitamin C and lycopene.

High-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) coupled 
with electronspray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to detect the flavonoid 
profile in lemon juices obtained from the main Sicilian cultivars (Femminello 
comune, Monachello, and Interdonato). Significant amounts of an unusual 
constituent were found in the lemon juice of the above-mentioned cultivars 
together with eriocitrin, hesperidin, and diosmin. Following purification by 
preparative HPLC, the structure was assigned as 6,8-di-C-glucopyranosyldiosmetin 
by means of DAD-UV, ESI-MS-MS, and (1)H NMR analysis. Three other minor 
components were also detected. One of these presented a flavone nature, and 
spectral data and literature references both suggested a 
6,8-di-C-glucopyranosylapigenin structure. The different contents of eriocitrin, 
hesperidin, diosmin, and above minor components in the cultivars allow juices to 
be readily differentiated.

A clinical study was conducted to investigate the dose response and metabolism 
of strawberry anthocyanins. In a crossover study design, 12 healthy adults 
consumed each of 3 strawberry treatments. The treatments were 100 g, 200 g, and 
400 g of pureed strawberries, delivering 15 micromol, 30 micromol, and 60 
micromol anthocyanin, respectively. Urine samples were collected for 24 h after 
each dose and samples were analyzed by HPLC with diode array detection and ion 
trap MS. Pelargonidin 3-glucoside was the major anthocyanin form in the 
treatments, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside and 3 metabolites of pelargonidin 
3-glucoside (detected as monoglucuronides) were excreted in urine after 
ingestion. One predominant monoglucuronide form was detected in urine in masses 
10-fold higher than the other 2 monoglucuronide forms. Increasing dose resulted 
in increasing appearance of anthocyanins in urine, and the mass of each 
pelargonidin monoglucuronide increased in urine with increasing dose. These 
results suggest that pelargonidin 3-glucoside absorption and metabolism are not 
saturated at masses < or = 60 micromol, thus showing that more strawberry 
anthocyanin can be absorbed with increasing dose.

In this study the main chemical parameters, ascorbic acid and polyphenol 
content, and antioxidant activity of two varieties of prunes, dried by 
high-temperature (85 + 70 degrees C) and low-temperature (60 degrees C) 
procedures, were monitored during storage. Ascorbic acid content was higher in 
the prunes dried at 60 degrees C but significantly decreased in both varieties 
during storage. The different classes of polyphenols analyzed (cinnamates, 
anthocyanins, flavonols) showed different stabilities during storage. 
Neochlorogenic acid decreased only in the President variety, whereas chlorogenic 
acid increased in both varieties; anthocyanins, present only in the President 
prunes, disappeared in the first months of storage, and the flavonol content 
fell significantly in both cultivars during the year of the study. Drying 
temperature significantly affected the polyphenol content, with different 
effects according to the class of polyphenols. Antioxidant activity showed a 
significant increase at the end of the storage period and in the President 
variety was higher in the sample dried at the higher temperature.

A sensitive, rapid, efficient, and reliable method for the separation and 
determination of phenolic acids by capillary zone electrophoresis has been 
carried out. A detailed method optimization was carried out to separate 14 
different compounds by studying parameters such as pH, type and concentration of 
buffer, applied voltage, and injection time. The separation was performed within 
16 min, using a 25 mM sodium borate buffer (pH 9.6) at 25 kV with 8 s of 
hydrodynamic injection. With this method and using a liquid-liquid extraction 
system, with recovery values around 95%, it has been possible to detect small 
quantities of phenolic acids in olive oil samples. This is apparently the first 
paper showing the quantification of this specific family of phenolic compounds 
in virgin olive oil samples.

Fourteen phenolic acids have been selectively determined in olive-oil samples 
using the co-electrosmotic capillary electrophoresis mode with UV detection 
after the LLE extraction system. A polycationic surfactant (hexadimetrine 
bromide, HDB), which dynamically coats the inner surface of the capillary and 
causes a fast anodic electroosmotic flow, was added to the electrolyte. The main 
factors affecting co-electroosmotic flow (EOF) such as type of modifier, 
concentration, and influence of organic solvents have been studied. Other 
parameters such as pH, type, and concentration of buffer, applied voltage, and 
injection time were also optimised using hydrodynamic injection for 8 s and UV 
detection at 210 nm. The composition optimum of the running buffer used was a 
20% 2-propanol, 0.001% HDB, and 50 mM sodium borate at a pH value of 9.6. The 
method has been applied to determination and quantification of fourteen phenolic 
acids at ppb levels in olive oil samples after a liquid-liquid extraction.

A rapid and reliable capillary zone electrophoresis method was used as a tool to 
obtain both qualitative and quantitative information about simple phenols, 
lignans, complex phenols (isomeric forms of secoiridoids), phenolic acids, and 
flavonoids in the solid-phase separation extracts from different Spanish 
extra-virgin olive oil in a short time (less than 6 min). Peak identification 
was done by using commercial and HPLC-isolated standards, studying the 
information of the electropherograms obtained at several wavelengths and also 
using the information previously reported. For the quantification of lignans and 
complex phenols (secoiridoid derivatives), we used a reference compound 
(oleuropein glucoside) at two different wavelengths (200 and 240 nm) and for the 
quantification of tyrosol and flavonoids, we used their commercially available 
standards.

We have recently demonstrated, in humans, the bioavailability of hydroxytyrosol 
(3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol; HT), one of the major antioxidant components of 
virgin olive oil. In particular, we reported that this compound is present in 
lipoproteins involved in atherosclerotic processes and is excreted in the urine 
mainly as glucuronide-conjugate. The aim of the present study was to elucidate, 
in humans, the metabolic fate of HT after ingestion of virgin olive oil. After 
administration of virgin olive oil, 24-hour urine collections of healthy 
volunteers were prepared for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses in 
order to identify and quantify HT and its metabolites homovanillic alcohol 
(HVA1c) and homovanillic acid (HVA). The results indicate that this compound 
undergoes the action of catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), enzymes involved 
in the catecholamine catabolism, resulting in an enhanced excretion of HVA1c. We 
also found a significant increase of HVA, indicating an oxidation of the 
ethanolic residue of HT and/or of HVA1c in humans. The excretion of both 
metabolites significantly correlated with the dose of administered HT.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Punicalagin is an antioxidant ellagitannin of pomegranate 
juice. This compound is responsible for the high antioxidant activity of this 
juice. Nothing is known about the bioavailability and metabolism of punicalagin 
or other food ellagitannins. The present work aims to evaluate the 
bioavailability and metabolism of punicalagin in the rat as an animal model.
DESIGN: Two groups of rats were studied. One fed with standard rat diet (n = 5) 
and another with the same diet plus 6 % punicalagin (n = 5). Samples of urine 
and faeces were taken during 37 days and plasma every week. The different 
metabolites were analysed by HPLC-MS-MS.
RESULTS: The daily intake of punicalagin ranged from 0.6 to 1.2 g. Values around 
3-6 % the ingested punicalagin were excreted as identified metabolites in faeces 
and urine. In faeces, punicalagin is transformed to hydrolysis products and 
partly metabolites by the rat microflora to 6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one 
derivatives. In plasma, punicalagin was detected at concentrations around 30 
microg/mL, and glucuronides of methyl ether derivatives of ellagic acid were 
also detected. 6H-Dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one derivatives were also detected 
especially during the last few weeks of the experiment. In urine, the main 
metabolites observed were the 6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one derivatives, as 
aglycones or glucuronides.
CONCLUSION: As only 3-6 % of the ingested punicalagin was detected as such or as 
metabolites in urine and faeces, the majority of this ellagitannin has to be 
converted to undetectable metabolites (i. e. CO(2)) or accumulated in 
non-analysed tissues, however with only traces of punicalagin metabolites being 
detected in liver or kidney. This is the first report on the absorption of an 
ellagitannin and its presence in plasma. In addition, the transformation of 
ellagic acid derivatives to 6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one derivatives in the rat is 
also confirmed.

Ellagitannins (ETs) are dietary polyphenols, containing ellagic acid (EA) 
subunits, with antioxidant and cancer chemopreventive activities that might 
contribute to health benefits in humans. However, little is known about their 
metabolic fate. We investigate here the metabolism of different dietary ETs and 
EA derivatives in humans. Forty healthy volunteers were distributed in four 
groups. Each group consumed, in a single dose, a different ET-containing 
foodstuff, i.e., strawberries (250 g), red raspberries (225 g), walnuts (35 g), 
and oak-aged red wine (300 mL). After the intake, five urine fractions (F) were 
collected at 8 (F1), 16 (F2), 32 (F3), 40 (F4), and 56 (F5) h. Neither ETs nor 
EA were detected in urine after LC-MS/MS analysis. However, the microbial 
metabolite 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one (urolithin B) conjugated 
with glucuronic acid was detected along the fractions F3-F5 in all of the 
subjects, independently of the consumed foodstuff. The mean percentage of 
metabolite excretion ranged from 2.8 (strawberries) to 16.6% (walnuts) regarding 
the ingested ETs. Considerable interindividual differences were noted, 
identifying ""high and low metabolite excreters"" in each group, which supported 
the involvement of the colonic microflora in ET metabolism. These results 
indicate that urolithin B (a previously described antiangiogenic and 
hyaluronidase inhibitor compound) is a biomarker of human exposure to dietary 
ETs and may be useful in intervention studies with ET-containing products. The 
antioxidant and anticarcinogenic effects of dietary ETs and EA should be 
considered in the gastrointestinal tract whereas the study of potential systemic 
activities should be focused on the bioavailable urolithin B derivatives.

Stoichiometric and kinetic values of phenolics against DPPH 
(2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) were determined for Andean purple corn (Zea mays 
L.) and red sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas). Both crops had higher antioxidant 
capacity and antiradical kinetics than blueberries and higher or similar 
anthocyanin and phenolic contents. The second-order rate constant (k(2)) was 
1.56, 1.12, 0.57, and 0.26 (mg antiradical/mL)(-1) s(-1) for red sweetpotato, 
Trolox, purple corn, and blueberry, respectively. On the molar basis of active 
hydroxyl groups, k(2)' showed the same order as for k(2). Corn cob and 
sweetpotato endodermis contributed the most in phenolic compounds and 
antioxidant capacity. Both crops studied can be considered as excellent novel 
sources of natural antioxidants for the functional food and dietary supplement 
markets.

Nineteen phenolic compounds including hydroxybenzoic acids, hydroxycinnamic 
acids, flavonoids, phenolic alcohols, and phenolic aldehydes have been 
identified and quantified in two monovarietal champagnes, Chardonnay and Pinot 
Noir, by using a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
system coupled with diode array detection. The identification of four 
hydroxycinnamic tartaric esters (caftaric, coutaric, fertaric, and 
2-S-glutathionylcaftaric acids), two flavanonols (astilbin and engeletin), and 
some other compounds was confirmed by HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry. 
Caftaric acid and tyrosol were the major phenols. Hydroxybenzoic acids and 
flavonoids were present at low concentrations. The phenolic compositions of 2000 
and 2001 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir vary quantitatively according to the year and 
the variety, but the chemical natures of the molecules are the same. The total 
phenolic content determined by colorimetric measurement ranges from 176 to 195 
mg/L of gallic acid equivalent and is similar to that described in white wines.

The antioxidant potential of eight clingstone peach cultivars was investigated 
by determining phenolic compounds and inhibition of low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) oxidation. Cultivars low in polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were also selected to 
minimize enzymatic browning. Inhibition of LDL oxidation varied from 17.0 to 
37.1% in peach flesh extract, from 15.2 to 49.8% in whole peach extract, and 
from 18.2 to 48.1% in peel extract. Total phenols were 432.8-768.1 mg/kg in 
flesh extract, 483.3-803.0 mg/kg in whole extract, and 910.9-1922.9 mg/kg in 
peel extract. The correlation coefficient between relative LDL antioxidant 
activity and concentration of total phenols was 0.76. Peel PPO activity was 
higher than flesh activity in most cultivars. The lowest PPO and specific 
activities were found in the Walgant cultivar, followed by Kakamas and 18-8-23. 
These three cultivars combine the desirable characteristics of strong 
antioxidant activity, low PPO activity, and lower susceptibility to browning 
reactions.

Liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) 
with positive and negative ion detection was used for the identification of 
flavonoids in Hakmeitau beans, a black seed cultivar of cowpea (Vigna sinensis). 
Gradient elution with water and acetonitrile, both containing 2% formic acid, 
was employed in chromatographic separation. The peaks were identified by 
comparison of the retention times and the UV-vis spectroscopic and mass 
spectrometric data with authentic standards and/or literature data. The 
identified flavonoids included six anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-O-galactoside, 
cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, malvidin 3-O-glucoside, 
peonidin 3-O-glucoside, and petunidin 3-O-glucoside) and four flavonol/flavonol 
glycosides (kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, quercetin, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, and 
quercetin 3-O-6' '-acetylglucoside). The tentatively identified flavonoids 
included two anthocyanins (malvidin 3-O-acetylglucoside and peonidin 
3-O-malonylglucoside) and three flavonol glycosides (myricetin-3-O-glucoside, 
quercetin 7-O-glucoside, and quercetin-3-O-diglucoside). These flavonoids are 
present in seed coats, and the contents of anthocyanins and flavonol glycosides 
were 20.7 and 2.0 mg/g, respectively.

Nutritional compounds (phenolic compounds, L-ascorbic acid), antioxidant 
activities, and physicochemical characteristics (fruit weight, dry matter, 
soluble solids, pH, acidity, total and reducing sugars) of 33 different sour 
cherry cultivars were studied. Polyphenols were identified by LC-PDA-QTOF/MS and 
quantified by UPLC-PDA-FL. A total of 41 polyphenolic compounds found were 
identified and presented as 14 flavan-3-ols, 11 anthocyanins, 5 hydroxycinnamic 
acids, 10 flavonols, and 1 flavon. The content of total polyphenols (TPs) ranged 
from 2982.51 ('Wisok' cultivar) to 1539.43 mg/100 g dry weight ('Erdi 
Nagygyϋmϋscu'cultivar). Flavan-3-ols, the major class of sour cherry 
polyphenols, represented ∼ 40% of the TP compounds, whereas anthocyanins and 
hydroxycinnamic acids amounted for about 25% each. The content of l-ascorbic 
acid did not exceed 22.18 mg/100 g fresh matter. Some polish sour cherry 
cultivars (especially 'Agat', 'Ametyst', 'Wider', 'Winer', and 'Wisok') may be 
selected to promote the growth of cultivars with strong nutritional and 
phytochemical beneficial effects on human health.

Absorption of cyanidin-based anthocyanins is not fully understood with respect 
to dose or anthocyanin structure. In feeding studies using whole foods, 
nonacylated anthocyanins are more bioavailable than their acylated counterparts, 
but the extent to which plant matrix determines relative bioavailability of 
anthocyanins is unknown. Using juice of purple carrots to circumvent matrix 
effects, a feeding trial was conducted to determine relative bioavailability of 
acylated and nonacylated anthocyanins and to assess dose-response effects. 
Appearance of anthocyanins in plasma was measured in 10 healthy adults for 8 h 
following consumption of purple carrot juice. Each subject consumed 50, 150, and 
250 mL of juice containing 76 micromol (65 mg), 228 micromol (194 mg), and 380 
micromol (323 mg) of total anthocyanins, respectively. Acylated anthocyanins 
comprised 76% of total anthocyanins in the juice, yet their bioavailability was 
found to be significantly less than that of nonacylated anthocyanins. Peak 
plasma concentrations of nonacylated anthocyanins were 4-fold higher than that 
for acylated anthocyanins. Absorption efficiency declined across the doses 
administered. Because the treatments were consumed as juice, it could be 
discerned that the difference in bioavailability of acylated versus nonacylated 
anthocyanins was not primarily caused by interactions with the plant matrix.

Understanding how the environment and production and cultivation practices 
influence the composition and quality of food crops is fundamental to the 
production of high-quality nutritious foods. In this 3-year study, total 
phenolics, percent soluble solids, ascorbic acid, and the flavonoid aglycones 
quercetin, kaempferol, and luteolin were measured in two varieties of tomato 
(Lycopersicon esculentum L. cv. Ropreco and Burbank) and two varieties of bell 
peppers (Capsicum annuum L. cv. California Wonder and Excalibur) grown by 
certified organic and conventional practices in a model system. Significantly 
higher levels of percent soluble solids (17%), quercetin (30%), kaempferol 
(17%), and ascorbic acid (26%) were found in Burbank tomatoes (fresh weight 
basis; FWB), whereas only levels of percent soluble solids (10%) and kaempferol 
(20%) were significantly higher in organic Ropreco tomatoes (FWB). Year-to-year 
variability was significant, and high values from 2003 influenced the 3-year 
average value of quercetin reported for organic Burbank tomatoes. Burbank 
tomatoes generally had higher levels of quercetin, kaempferol, total phenolics, 
and ascorbic acid as compared to Ropreco tomatoes. Bell peppers were influenced 
less by environment and did not display cropping system differences.

Tea (Camellia Sinensis) is one of the most popular drink, consumed as infusion 
or bottled ready to drink beverages. Although tea leaves contain many 
antioxidants compounds, after processing they can drastically decrease, 
sometimes up to a full degradation, as in the case of catechin, a very healthy 
flavan-3-ol. In this context, the synthesis of a cocrystal between (+)-catechin 
and L-(+)-ascorbic acid, was proved to be a useful strategy to make a new 
ingredient able to ameliorate the antioxidant profile of both infusions and 
bottled teas. The obtained cocrystal showed a three-fold higher solubility than 
(+)catechin and its formation was elucidated unambiguously by FT-IR, thermal 
(DSC) and diffraction (PXRD) analyses. Antioxidant characteristics of the 
samples were evaluated by colorimetric assays. As expected, infusions showed 
much better antioxidant features than ready-to-use lemon and peach teas. The 
same trend was confirmed after the addition of the cocrystal at two 
concentration levels. In particular, supplementation at concentration of 2 mg 
mL-1 improved the bottled tea antioxidant values to the level showed by the 
not-added infusion tea.

A HPLC method was developed for the separation and determination of flavonoid 
and phenolic antioxidants in cranberry juices. Free flavonoid and phenolic 
compounds were fractionated into neutral and acidic groups by means of a 
solid-phase extraction method, followed by subsequent HPLC separations. Combined 
flavonoids and phenolics were hydrolyzed by acid before HPLC analysis. This 
developed method provides a fast and high resolution of individual flavonoid and 
phenolic compounds. In cranberry fruit, flavonoids and phenolic acids exist 
predominantly in combined forms, such as glycosides and esters. A total of 400 
mg of total flavonoids and phenolic compounds/l of sample was found in a freshly 
squeezed cranberry juice, which was distributed as about 44% of phenolic acids 
and 56% of flavonoids. Benzoic acid was the major phenolic compound. Major 
flavonoids in the freshly squeezed cranberry juice were quercetin and myricetin.

Epidemiological studies suggest that consumption of whole grain cereals and 
whole grain cereal products have many benefical health effects, including 
reducing risk of diabetes, obesity, coronary heart diseases, stroke and even 
some cancers. Precise knowledge protective compounds present in cereal grains 
can be achieved only when specific biomarkers (biological marker, indicator), 
that could provide estimation of grain cereals absorption and intake, are 
established and determined. 5-n-alkylresorcinols (main fraction of phenolic 
compounds in cereals), because of their specific occurrence only in bran 
fraction, obtained in refining of milling fractions process, could be a very 
good candidate to play the role of biomarker of whole grain intake. They are 
absorbed by animals and humans, present in human plasma and as metabolites in 
urine. Because composition of saturated homologues of 5-n-alkylresorcinols is 
different in rye and wheat grains, they could be used as an indicator of the 
intake of the specific type of cereals and whole grain cereal products.

Scutellarin is widely used in treating various cardiovascular diseases. Few data 
are available regarding its metabolism and pharmacokinetics in humans. The 
objectives of this study were to develop methods to identify major metabolites 
of scutellarin in human urine and plasma and to determine simultaneously the 
parent drug and its major metabolites in human plasma for pharmacokinetic 
studies. Four metabolites were detected in urine samples by liquid 
chromatography coupled with electrospray multi-stage mass spectrometry (MS), but 
only one of them was found in plasma. Its structure was confirmed as 
scutellarein 6-O-beta-D-glucuronide by MS, NMR, and UV absorbance spectra. The 
plasma concentrations of scutellarin and the major metabolite were 
simultaneously determined using liquid chromatography-tandem MS. After a single 
p.o. administration of 60 mg of scutellarin to 20 healthy subjects, the plasma 
concentrations of scutellarin were very low, and its plasma concentration-time 
curve was also anomalous. Plasma concentration of the major metabolite was 
comparatively high, and the peak plasma concentration was 87.0 +/- 29.1 ng/ml. 
The Tmax was late (7.85 +/- 1.62 h), and part of individual pharmacokinetic 
profiles showed double peaks, which indicated scutellarin could be absorbed into 
the intestine after hydrolysis to its aglycone by bacterial enzymes. This was 
followed by reconjugation in the intestinal cell and/or liver with glucuronic 
acid catalyzed by the phase II enzyme, which showed regioselectivity and species 
difference. The regioselectivity of glucuronoconjugation for scutellarin may be 
of importance for pharmacological activity. Plasma concentration of 
isoscutellarin can be used as a biomarker of scutellarin intake.

In this work, liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem ion-trap mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) was used to investigate the in-vivo and in-vitro 
metabolism of tectoridin. After oral administration of a single dose (100 mg 
kg(-1)) of tectoridin to healthy rats, faeces and urine samples were collected 
for 0-48 h and 0-24 h, respectively. Tectoridin was also incubated with rat 
intestinal flora and rat liver microsomes. Samples from in-vivo and in-vitro 
metabolism studies were purified using a C(18) solid-phase extraction cartridge, 
then separated using a reverse-phase C(18) column with methanol/ water (30:70, 
v/v, adjusted to pH 10.0 with ammonia water) as mobile phase and detected by an 
on-line MS(n) system. The structure of the metabolites was elucidated by 
comparing their molecular weights, retention times and full-scan MS(n) spectra 
with those of the parent drug. The results revealed six metabolites of 
tectoridin in urine (tectorigenin, hydrogenated tectorigenin, mono-hydroxylated 
tectorigenin, di-hydroxylated tectorigenin, glucuronide-conjugated tectorigenin 
and sulfate-conjugated tectorigenin); three metabolites in faeces (tectorigenin, 
di-hydroxylated tectorigenin and sulfateconjugated tectorigenin); one metabolite 
in the intestinal flora incubation mixture (tectorigenin), and four in the liver 
microsomal incubation mixture (tectorigenin, hydrogenated tectorigenin, 
mono-hydroxylated tectorigenin and di-hydroxylated tectorigenin). Except for 
tectorigenin, all other metabolites of tectoridin are reported for the first 
time.

Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), a medicinal plant and edible vegetable from the 
Lamiaceae family, holds significant therapeutic and culinary value. Endophytic 
bacterial inoculation is an effective strategy for enhancing the essential oil 
content and metabolic profile of medicinal plants. This study isolated and 
molecularly identified two endophytic bacteria, and evaluated their effects on 
the physiological, biochemical, and essential oil traits of basil using a 
completely randomized design. The bacterial isolates were identified as 
Microbacterium foliorum Emf1 and Paenibacillus peoriae ER11. Both isolates 
significantly improved key growth traits, with M. foliorum Emf1 showing the most 
substantial impact across various indicators. Notable increases compared to the 
control included root volume (106.79%), root surface area (60.66%), root fresh 
(71.81%) and dry weight (77.77%), shoot fresh (81.73%) and dry weight (81.48%), 
leaf fresh (84.54%) and dry weight (83.59%), membrane stability (400.85%), 
carotenoid content (200.00%), anthocyanin levels (61.90%), essential oil content 
(101.43%), total phenol (20.46%), and antioxidant activity (56.6%). This 
research provides novel insights by demonstrating the beneficial effects of 
these two endophytic bacterial isolates in enhancing basil's growth performance, 
biochemical properties and essential oil content.

Epidemiological studies have shown that consumption of fruits and vegetables is 
associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases. Increased consumption of 
fruits and vegetables containing high levels of phytochemicals has been 
recommended to prevent chronic diseases related to oxidative stress in the human 
body. In this study, 10 common vegetables were selected on the basis of 
consumption per capita data in the United States. A more complete profile of 
phenolic distributions, including both free and bound phenolics in these 
vegetables, is reported here using new and modified methods. Broccoli possessed 
the highest total phenolic content, followed by spinach, yellow onion, red 
pepper, carrot, cabbage, potato, lettuce, celery, and cucumber. Red pepper had 
the highest total antioxidant activity, followed by broccoli, carrot, spinach, 
cabbage, yellow onion, celery, potato, lettuce, and cucumber. The phenolics 
antioxidant index (PAI) was proposed to evaluate the quality/quantity of 
phenolic contents in these vegetables and was calculated from the corrected 
total antioxidant activities by eliminating vitamin C contributions. 
Antiproliferative activities were also studied in vitro using HepG(2) human 
liver cancer cells. Spinach showed the highest inhibitory effect, followed by 
cabbage, red pepper, onion, and broccoli. On the basis of these results, the 
bioactivity index (BI) for dietary cancer prevention is proposed to provide a 
simple reference for consumers to choose vegetables in accordance with their 
beneficial activities. The BI could be a new alternative biomarker for future 
epidemiological studies in dietary cancer prevention and health promotion.

Peanuts are consumed mostly as processed products. Although the effect of 
processing on isoflavone composition of legumes has been extensively studied, 
there has been no such study on peanuts. The objective of this study was to 
evaluate the effect of processing (boiling, oil- and dry-roasting) on the 
phytochemical composition of peanuts. Boiling had a significant effect on the 
phytochemical composition of peanuts compared to oil- and dry-roasting. Boiled 
peanuts had the highest total flavonoid and polyphenol content. The biochanin A 
and genistein content of boiled peanut extracts were two- and fourfold higher, 
respectively. trans-Resveratrol was detected only in the boiled peanuts, with 
the commercial product having a significantly (p < or = 0.05) higher 
concentration. Ultraviolet and mass spectrometry chromatograms for the boiled 
peanut extracts show the presence of four additional peaks that were not 
observed in the raw peanut extracts.

Peanuts have been reported to contain bioactive phytochemicals, particularly 
isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, and biochanin A) and trans-resveratrol. 
Currently, limited data are available regarding the levels of these bioactive 
compounds in peanuts with variations in reported levels. The purpose of this 
study was to compare four methods of extraction [stirring, sonication, Soxtec, 
and microwave-assisted sonication (MAS)] for runner peanuts. Quantification of 
the selected compounds was conducted by reverse-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography (RP-HPLC). The results showed that the MAS and Soxtec methods 
extracted significantly higher amounts of the phytochemicals. Also, the defatted 
peanuts gave significantly higher amounts of the phytochemicals compared to the 
nondefatted peanuts. The high levels of the isoflavones may be attributed to 
heat-induced conversion of conjugate glycosides to aglycons. The MAS and Soxtec 
methods may be used for total isoflavone content quantitation, while sonication 
or stirring may be the method of choice for quantitation of isoflavone 
composition (aglycons and glycoside conjugates) in peanuts.

The effect of polyphenols among different varieties of plums on superoxide 
radical scavenging activity (SRSA) was studied by an enzymatic method and their 
IC(50) values were determined. We found that the SRSA levels of the polyphenols 
were closely related to their chemical structures; cyanidin showed the lowest 
IC(50) among the polyphenols examined, and aglycones are more effective than 
their glycosides. BY 69-339 cultivar exhibited the lowest IC(50) among the 
eleven plum cultivars, which means the highest antioxidant activity in 
scavenging superoxide radicals, followed by French Damson, Cacaks Best, 
Beltsville Elite B70197, Empress, Castleton, Stanley, NY 6, NY 101, Mirabellier, 
and NY 9. IC(50) values showed a higher correlation with total flavonoids (r (2) 
= 0.8699) than total phenolics (r (2) = 0.8355), which indicated that flavonoids 
might contribute to the total SRSA more directly than other polyphenols. 
Anthocyanins in plums appeared to be the major contributors to the total SRSA, 
except for two yellow cultivars having no anthocyanins. Chlorogenic acid was the 
predominant phenolic acid, and it also exhibited SRSA significantly in the range 
of 1.0 to 94.9%. Quercetins were the major flavonols in plums. However, they 
showed relatively low contribution to the total SRSA.

Epidemiological and scientific research has contributed to the identification of 
the key role of dietary antioxidants in maintaining human health by preventing 
oxidative damage to cellular components. The antiradical activity of seven 
varieties of plums and their protective effects against oxidative stress were 
comparatively evaluated in mouse granulocytes in this study using a 
2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) test and a 
cellular test. The class of phytochemical compounds responsible for the main 
antioxidant capacities observed was also investigated. The ABTS and cellular 
tests revealed that the total antioxidant capacities, expressed as vitamin C 
equivalents, ranged from 691.2 to 2,164.64 mg and from 613.98 to 2,137.59 mg per 
100 g of fresh weight, respectively, suggesting that plums are rich in natural 
antioxidants and appreciably protect granulocytes from oxidative stress. Our 
results showed a linear correlation between either total phenolic or flavonoid 
contents and total antioxidant capacity, revealing that these compounds 
contribute significantly to the antioxidant activity of plums. The major 
polyphenolics in plums, identified and quantified using reversed-phase 
high-performance liquid chromatography, were tested to evaluate their protective 
effect on peripheral blood granulocytes from oxidative stress. The results 
suggest that individual polyphenolics contribute directly to the total 
protective effect of plums.

To study the effect of polyphenolics on antioxidant activities of cabbages, the 
amounts of total phenolics, total flavonoids, antioxidant capacity and 
individual phenolic compounds in raw and processed cabbages were determined. 
Fresh and pickled red cabbages exhibited the highest total phenolic contents 
(393.1+/-10.8 mg and 366.3+/-3.6 mg gallic acid equivalents/100 g fresh sample, 
respectively). Fresh and pickled red cabbages were also highest in flavonoids 
(108.1+/-9.3 mg and 72.4+/-4.4 mg catechin equivalents/100 g fresh sample, 
respectively). The antioxidant capacity (expressed as vitamin C equivalent 
antioxidant capacity) ranged from 57.1 to 695.6 mg vitamin C equivalents/100 g 
fresh sample, where raw and pickled red cabbages exhibited the highest 
antioxidant capacity. There was a good linear relationship between the total 
phenolics and antioxidant capacity (r2=0.9743), and between the total flavonoids 
and antioxidant capacity (r2=0.9557); however, the relationship between the 
ascorbic acid content and antioxidant capacity was very low (r2=0.1442). The 
antioxidant capacity of raw and processed cabbages was highly correlated with 
their contents of polyphenolics. Kaempferol, quercetin, and apigenin were the 
major flavonoids existing in cabbages except for raw and pickled red cabbages, 
where cyanidin was the predominant flavonoid (73.6-117.7 mg/kg). In the red 
cabbages, cyanidin was the major contributor to the antioxidant capacity as well 
as the content of total phenolics and flavonoids.

Non-extractable phenolic compounds (NEPs), or bound phenolic compounds, 
represent a crucial component of polyphenols. They are an essential fraction 
that remains in the residual matrix after the extraction of extractable phenolic 
compounds (EPs), making them a valuable resource for numerous applications. 
These compounds encompass a diverse range of phenolic compounds, ranging from 
low molecular weight phenolic to high polymeric polyphenols attached to other 
macro molecules, e.g., cell walls and proteins. Their status as natural, green 
antioxidants have been well established, with numerous studies showcasing their 
anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, anti-cancer, and hypoglycemic activities. These 
properties make them a highly desirable alternative to synthetic antioxidants. 
Fruit and vegetable (F&Veg) wastes, e.g., peels, pomace, and seeds, generated 
during the harvest, transport, and processing of F&Vegs, are abundant in NEPs 
and EPs. This review delves into the various types, contents, structures, and 
antioxidant activities of NEPs and EPs in F&Veg wastes. The relationship between 
the structure of these compounds and their antioxidant activity is explored in 
detail, highlighting the importance of structure-activity relationships in the 
field of natural antioxidants. Their potential applications ranging from 
functional food and beverage products to nutraceutical and cosmetic products. A 
glimpse into their bright future as a valuable resource for a greener, 
healthier, and more sustainable future, and calling for researchers, 
industrialists, and policymakers to explore their full potential, are 
elaborated.

Most methods for detecting isoflavones in biological samples do not measure the 
concentration of sulfate conjugates. An LC-MS method is reported here to 
estimate urinary concentrations of genistein and daidzein, their sulfate and 
glucuronide conjugates and other major metabolites. Human and rat urine samples 
were extracted with diethyl ether, or pre-digested with sulfatase and/or 
beta-glucuronidase followed by extraction. The isoflavones were separated using 
gradient LC methods and detected by negative single ion monitoring on an MS 
system using a heated nebulizer atmospheric pressure chemical ionization 
interface. CVs for inter- and intra-assay variability were generally < 20 and 
10%, respectively. Preliminary studies using these procedures demonstrate 52+/-4 
and 26+/-4% of genistein in rat urine was found as the aglycone and sulfate 
conjugates, respectively, compared to 0.36 and 4%, respectively, in human urine. 
This method is suitable for the study of isoflavone sulfate conjugates in 
biological fluids.

Fish and fish products (14 samples), Indian foods and meals (10 samples), spices 
(30 samples) and beers (10 samples) were analysed for their phytoestrogen 
content, and a number of significant non-soya sources of dietary phytoestrogens 
were identified. No isoflavones were detected in unprocessed, farmed or ocean 
fish, but some samples of processed fish products contained soya isoflavones, 
which are assumed to come from coatings or protein addition. Additionally, some 
processed fish products contained, genistein glycocongugates not derived from 
soya. Genistein was detected in Indian meals such that, for example, a single 
portion of a vindalooo curry contained 11 mg genistein. The origin was most 
likely from the spices used, since the analysis of curry powders, chilli powder, 
crushed red chillies, garam masala and tandoori powder revealed that some 
contained genistein at more than 100 mg kg(-1). Cumin was the most likely source 
material, although not all individual samples of cumin tested contained high 
levels of genistein. Prenylnaringenin phytoestrogens were determined in UK 
hop-based beers at mean concentrations of 0.21 mg(-1) 6-prenylnaringenin and 
0.06mg(-1) 8-prenylnaringenin. The beers also contained traces of daidzein, 
genistein and biochanin A. The significance of 'hidden soya' in processed foods 
and these non-soya sources of phytoestrogens is that UK dietary intake of 
phytoestrogens must be assumed to be higher than estimated previously and that 
some sources of phytoestrogens remain poorly characterized.

The analysis of general content of polyphenols, minerals and antioxidant 
activity of infusions from selected coffee substitutes is presented. The 
obtained results showed that the coffee infusions prepared from acorns exhibit 
the highest radical scavenging capacities for DPPH 
(EC50 = 0.063-0.066 mgd.w./mL), ABTS (EC50 = 0.021-0.029 mgd.w./mL), 
OH(EC50 = 2.050-2.378 mgd.w./mL) as well as the highest ability to Fe3+ 
reduction (FRAP) (∼1.1 mmolFe/gd.w). These coffee substitutes also contain the 
greatest values of polyphenols (45-50 mgGA/gd.w). Analyzed coffee substitutes 
differ in both quality and quantity of polyphenols, but all tested coffees 
contain gallic and chlorogenic acids. The most of phenolic compounds was found 
in herbal-cereal coffee substitute. The quantitative results and PCA analysis 
indicated a good correlation between the antioxidant activity and total 
polyphenols, flavonoids and gallic acid content. Using the obtained data on the 
composition and antioxidant properties of extracts the cluster analysis (CA) was 
performed to distinguish similar or close types of coffee.

Phenolic acids (chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic, ellagic, and 
syringic acid) as well as syringaldehyde and juglone were identified in ripe 
fruits of 10 walnut cultivars: Adams, Cisco, Chandler, Franquette, Lara, Fernor, 
Fernette, Alsoszentivani 117 (A-117), Rasna, and Elit. Analyses were done using 
a high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a diode array detector. 
Significant differences in the contents of identified phenolics were observed 
among cultivars. Phenolics were determined separately in the kernel and in the 
thin skin of the walnut, termed the pellicle. Not only in the kernel but also in 
the pellicle did syringic acid, juglone, and ellagic acid predominate (average 
values of 33.83, 11.75, and 5.90 mg/100 g of kernel; and 1003.24, 317.90, and 
128.98 mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively), and the contents of ferulic and 
sinapic acid (average values of 0.06 and 0.05 mg/100 g of kernel and 2.93 and 
2.17 mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively) were the lowest in all cultivars. The 
highest differences in the sum of all identified phenolics were observed between 
Rasna and Fernette fruits; in Rasna there were >2-fold higher contents of 
identified phenolics in both kernel and pellicle. It was found that the walnut 
pellicle is the most important source of walnut phenolics. The ratio between the 
contents in pellicle and kernel varied by at least 14.8-fold for caffeic acid 
(cv. Adams) and by up to 752.0-fold for p-coumaric acid (cv. Elit).

Biotransformation of the phytoestrogen [14C]genistein was investigated in male 
and female rats by application of narrow-bore radio-HPLC-MSn (LCQ, Finnigan) to 
determine intermediates in metabolism. Urine contained five metabolites, 
Gm1-Gm5, 24 h after dosing by gavage with [14C]genistein (4 mg kg(-1)). 
Structural analysis following ESI revealed molecular ions [M+H]+ of m/z 447, 
449, 273, and 271 for metabolites Gm2, Gm3, Gm5 and genistein, respectively and 
an [M-H]- of m/z 349 for Gm4. Metabolite structure was deduced by evaluation of 
product ion spectra derived from unlabelled and [14C]-labelled ions and 
sensitivity to treatment with beta-glucuronidase. These studies indicated 
identity of metabolites with genistein glucuronide (Gm2), dihydrogenistein 
glucuronide (Gm3), genistein sulphate (Gm4) and dihydrogenistein (Gm5). 
Detection of the beta-glucuronidase resistant major metabolite Gm1 by ESI was 
poor and so was analysed by negative ion APCI; this revealed a deprotonated 
molecular ion of m/z 165 which had chromatographic and mass spectral properties 
consistent with authentic 4-hydroxyphenyl-2-propionic acid, a novel metabolite 
of genistein. In vitro metabolism studies with anaerobic caecal cultures derived 
from male and female rats revealed metabolism of genistein to Gm1 via Gm5 and an 
additional metabolite (Gm6) which was identified from product ion spectra as 
6'-hydroxy-O-desmethylangolensin. Biotransformation of genistein by both 
isolated hepatocytes and precision-cut liver slices was limited to 
glucuronidation of parent compound. Commonality of genistein metabolites found 
in rats with those reported in man suggest similar pathways of 
biotransformation, primarily involving gut micro-flora.

Anthocyanins are potent antioxidants that may possess chronic disease preventive 
properties. Here, rapid, reliable, and reproducible solid-phase extraction, 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and mass spectrometry techniques 
are described for the isolation, separation, and identification of anthocyanins 
in human plasma and urine. Recoveries of cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) were 91% 
from water, 71% from plasma, and 81% from urine. Intra- and interday variations 
for C3G extraction were 9 and 9.1% in plasma and 7.1 and 9.1% in urine and were 
less than 15% for all anthocyanins from a standardized bilberry extract 
(mirtoselect). Analysis of mirtoselect by HPLC with UV detection produced 
spectra with 15 peaks compatible with anthocyanin components found in 
mirtoselect within a total run time of 15 min. Chromatographic analysis of human 
urine obtained after an oral dose of mirtoselect yielded 19 anthocyanin peaks. 
Mass spectrometric analysis employing multiple reaction monitoring suggests the 
presence of unchanged anthocyanins and anthocyanidin glucuronide metabolites.

Chocolate and other cocoa-containing products are a rich source of polyphenols. 
This paper describes an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) method 
that can separate and quantify in 3 min six of the major chocolate polyphenols: 
catechin; epicatechin; B2 (epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin); B5 
(epicatechin-4beta-6-epicatechin); C1 
(epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin); and tetramer D 
(epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin). A 
survey of 68 chocolate samples indicated that there was a strongly predictive 
relationship between epicatechin and the other individual polyphenols, 
especially procyanidin B2 (R 2 = 0.989), even though the chocolates came from 
varied sources and manufacturers. The relationship was less strong with 
catechin, and so further work to explore the reasons for this difference was 
performed. Chiral analysis on a subset of 23 chocolates showed that 
(-)-epicatechin had a predictive relationship with (+)-catechin in line with the 
other polyphenols, but not with (-)-catechin (the predominant form). This 
indicates that (-)-catechin is the most affected by manufacturing conditions, 
possibly formed through epimerization from (-)-epicatechin during processing. 
The results show that epicatechin concentrations can be used to predict the 
content of other polyphenols, especially B2 and C1, and total polyphenols 
content. Finally, the (-)-catechin content is not predictable from the 
epicatechin content, and it is concluded that this is the main form of 
polyphenol that varies according to manufacturing conditions and cocoa origin.

Six strawberry cultivars grown on the same commercial plantation in Brazil were 
evaluated for their chemical composition and quality attributes at the ripe 
stage. The profiles of the main soluble sugars, ascorbic acid, and anthocyanins 
were also obtained during the developmental stages. Results showed significant 
differences among cultivars in all of the investigated parameters. Cv. 
Campineiro showed an average value for texture of 0.63 N, half the value found 
for cv. Oso Grande. Anthocyanin content ranged from 13 (cv. Campineiro) to 55 
(cv. Mazi) mg/100 g. Total ascorbic acid found for cv. Campineiro (85 mg/100 g) 
was twice the amount found in cv. Dover (40 mg/100 g). Fructose was the 
predominant soluble sugar in almost all cultivars. The proportion among the main 
soluble sugars (fructose, sucrose, and glucose) was similar for Oso Grande and 
Toyonoka cultivars. The flavonol content (quercetin plus kaempferol derivatives) 
ranged from 2.7 to 7.1 mg/100 g, with a mean value of 6.1 mg/100 g, whereas free 
ellagic acid ranged from 0.9 to 1.9 and total phenolics varied from 159 to 289

pre-treatment was carried out by capillary zone electrophoresis with diode-array 
detection. Electrolyte conditions such as pH, composition and concentration of 
the buffer, working voltage and type and time of injection were checked. The 
best separation of the cited analytes was achieved in 70 mM sodium borate 
solution and pH 10.25. The detection limits were from 2.1 to 5.6 mg L(-1) for 
the 18 compounds studied. The developed method is rapid, sensitive and

Ensuring the safety and stability of minimally processed foods using natural 
preservatives is of great scientific and commercial interest in modern 
biotechnology. Berry juice supplementation is increasingly recognized within 
this field. This study investigated the effectiveness of juices from four berry 
species Aronia melanocarpa, Ribes nigrum, Vaccinium macrocarpon, and Sambucus 
nigra, against the food pathogen Bacillus cereus. Overall, the antibacterial 
potency of juice supplements (up to 10% v/v in tryptic soy broth) followed the 
order of chokeberry > blackcurrant > cranberry > elderberry, with the latter 
showing no inhibitory effects. Notably, chokeberry and elderberry juices 
presented lower acidity and significantly greater phenolic contents (p < 0.05) 
than blackcurrant and cranberry juices did, suggesting that B. cereus 
susceptibility is not strictly dependent upon low extracellular pH or elevated 
anthocyanin levels. Instead, it is inferred to correlate with pro-oxidative 
effects induced directly at the intracellular level. Accordingly, this paper 
discusses the antioxidative, acidic, and lipophilic attributes of juices and 
their constituent fractions, including anthocyanins, to elucidate their 
biopreservative potential. The results of this study increase our understanding 
of the antibacterial susceptibility of B. cereus.

Human bioavailability of the flavonoid dihydrochalcones is little understood, 
and no evidence exists for C-glycosyl flavonoid absorption in humans. The 
present study uses catechol-O-methyltransferase to generate methylated 
metabolites of aspalathin (a C-glycosyl dihydrochalcone from rooibos tea). One 
of the methylated forms, both with and without glucuronidation, was detected 
using LC-MS/MS in the urine of human subjects (n = 6), demonstrating that 
deglycosylation is not a prerequisite for C-glycosyl flavonoid absorption. 
Methylation is catalysed by both intestine and liver cytosolic extracts. The 
results show that flavonoid C-glycosides are methylated and glucuronidated in 
vivo in an intact form in humans.

Noncovalent complexes were used for structural determination and isomer 
differentiation of flavonoid glucuronides. Several flavonoid glucuronides 
including naringenin-7-O-glucuronide, synthesized here for the first time, were 
used as test compounds. Electrospray ionization quadrupole ion trap mass 
spectrometry with collision-induced dissociation (CID) was used to analyze 
complexes of the form [Co(II) (L-H) (Aux)]+ and [Co(II) (L-H) (Aux)2]+, in which 
L is the flavonoid glucuronide and Aux is a phenanthroline-based ligand. These 
complexes yielded characteristic fragmentation patterns that facilitated 
assignment of the substitution position of the glucuronides. The methods were 
adapted to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with 
postcolumn cobalt complexation and were tested on extracts from biological 
fluids. The metabolites naringenin-7-O-glucuronide and 
naringenin-4'-O-glucuronide were detected in human urine following the 
consumption of grapefruit juice. Isomeric quercetin glucuronides were identified 
and differentiated after spiking rat plasma at the 1 microM level, proving that 
the new methods are effective at biologically relevant concentrations.

Cold plasma treatment of kiwifruit juice was studied in the domain of 18-30 kV 
of voltage, 2-6 mm of juice depth, and 6-10 min of treatment time using the 
response surface methodology (RSM). The experimental design utilized was a 
central composite rotatable design. The effect of voltage, juice depth, and 
treatment time on the various responses, namely peroxidase activity, color, 
total phenolic content, ascorbic acid, total antioxidant activity, and total 
flavonoid content, was examined. While modeling, the artificial neural network 
(ANN) showed greater predictive capability than RSM as the coefficient of 
determination (R2 ) value of responses was greater in the case of ANN 
(0.9538-0.9996) than in RSM (0.9041-0.9853). The mean square error value was 
also less in the case of ANN than in RSM. The ANN was coupled with a genetic 
algorithm (GA) for optimization. The optimum condition obtained from ANN-GA was 
30 kV, 5 mm, and 6.7 min, respectively.

The flavonoid quercetin in disease prevention and therapy: facts and fancies.

Biochemical and genetic studies on cellular and animal models on the 
mechanism(s) of action of phytochemicals provide a functional explanation of how 
and why a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is considered healthy. It is not 
unusual to find molecules that protect against diseases, which greatly differ 
from a physiopathological point of view, such as cancer and cardiovascular 
disorders. Quercetin falls into this category and possesses a broad range of 
biological properties. Uptake, metabolism and circulating concentrations of 
quercetin and its metabolites suggest that a regular diet provides amounts of 
quercetin (<1 μM) not compatible with its chemopreventive and/or 
cardioprotective effects. However, it appears relatively easy to increase total 
quercetin concentrations in plasma (>10 μM) by supplementation with 
quercetin-enriched foods or supplements. Multiple lines of experimental evidence 
suggest a positive association between quercetin intake and improved outcomes of 
inflammatory cardiovascular risk. The ameliorating effect of quercetin 
administration can be extended to other chronic inflammatory disorders but only 
if supplementation occurs in patients. Quercetin can be considered the prototype 
of a naturally-occurring chemopreventive agent because of its key roles in 
triggering the ""hallmarks of cancer"". However, several critical points must be 
taken into account when considering the potential therapeutic use of this 
molecule: (1) pharmacological versus nutraceutical doses applied, (2) 
specificity of its mechanism of action compared to other phytochemicals, and (3) 
identification of ""direct"" cellular targets. The design of specific clinical 
trials is extremely warranted to depict possible applications of quercetin in 
adjuvant cancer therapy.

A LC-MS method was developed for the determination of coumarin, vanillin, and 
ethyl vanillin in vanilla products. Samples were analyzed using LC-electrospray 
ionization (ESI)-MS in the positive ionization mode. Limits of detection for the 
method ranged from 0.051 to 0.073 microg mL(-1). Using the optimized method, 24 
vanilla products were analyzed. All samples tested negative for coumarin. 
Concentrations ranged from 0.38 to 8.59 mg mL(-1) (x =3.73) for vanillin and 
0.33 to 2.27 mg mL(-1) (x =1.03) for ethyl vanillin. The measured concentrations 
are compared to values calculated using UV monitoring and to results reported in 
a similar survey in 1988. Analytical results, method precision, and accuracy 
data are presented.

The phytochemical profiles (total phenolics, anthocyanins, ferulic acid, 
carotenoids) and antioxidant activities of five types of corn (white, yellow, 
high carotenoid, blue, and red) processed into masa, tortillas, and tortilla 
chips were studied. The nixtamalization process significantly (p < 0.05) reduced 
total phenolics and antioxidant activities when compared to raw grains. 
Nixtamalized grains exhibited higher concentration of free phenolics and soluble 
conjugated ferulic acid and had lower concentrations of bound phenolics and 
ferulic acid than unprocessed grains. Among processed products, there was little 
difference in the phytochemical contents and antioxidant activities. Among types 
of corn, the highest concentrations of total phenolics, ferulic acid, and 
antioxidant activity were observed in the high-carotenoid genotype followed by 
the regular yellow counterpart. The white corn contained the lowest amount of 
total phenolics and antioxidant activity. The pigmented blue corn had the 
highest anthocyanin concentration followed by the red counterpart. These 
findings suggest that lime-cooking significantly reduced the phytochemical 
content of nixtamalized products but released phenolics and ferulic acid.

A simple and reproducible method for qualitative and quantitative analysis of 
phenolic compounds in virgin olive oils by solid-phase extraction (SPE), high 
performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), and 
HPLC-mass spectrometry (MS) in tandem mode was developed. The polar fraction was 
obtained from samples of three different virgin olive oils. Detection and 
quantification were performed at 280, 240, and 320 nm. For identification 
purposes, HPLC-MS/MS was equipped with turbo ion spray source in the 
negative-ion mode. Twenty compounds of twenty-three detected and quantified were 
characterized. The method showed satisfactory linearity (r > 0.99), good 
recovery, satisfactory precision, and appropriate limits of detection (LOD) and 
quantification (LOQ).

In human LDL, the bioactivity of olive oil phenols is determined by the in vivo 
disposition of the biological metabolites of these compounds. Here, we examined 
how the ingestion of 2 similar olive oils affected the content of the metabolic 
forms of olive oil phenols in LDL in men. The oils differed in phenol 
concentrations as follows: high (629 mg/L) for virgin olive oil (VOO) and null 
(0 mg/L) for refined olive oil (ROO). The study population consisted of a 
subsample from the EUROLIVE study and a randomized controlled, crossover design 
was used. Intervention periods lasted 3 wk and were preceded by a 2-wk washout 
period. The levels of LDL hydroxytyrosol monosulfate and homovanillic acid 
sulfate, but not of tyrosol sulfate, increased after VOO ingestion (P < 0.05), 
whereas the concentrations of circulating oxidation markers, including oxidized 
LDL (oxLDL), conjugated dienes, and hydroxy fatty acids, decreased (P < 0.05). 
The levels of LDL phenols and oxidation markers were not affected by ROO 
consumption. The relative increase in the 3 LDL phenols was greater when men 
consumed VOO than when they consumed ROO (P < 0.05), as was the relative 
decrease in plasma oxLDL (P = 0.001) and hydroxy fatty acids (P < 0.001). Plasma 
oxLDL concentrations were negatively correlated with the LDL phenol levels (r = 
-0.296; P = 0.013). Phenols in LDL were not associated with other oxidation 
markers. In summary, the phenol concentration of olive oil modulates the 
phenolic metabolite content in LDL after sustained, daily consumption. The 
inverse relationship of these metabolites with the degree of LDL oxidation 
supports the in vivo antioxidant role of olive oil phenolics compounds.

Trypsin inhibitors (TI), tannins, and lectins appear to have a role in 
preventing chronic diseases in humans. The genetic variability of these traits 
in common bean needs to be ascertained in order to increase levels through 
breeding. The variability of TI, tannin, and lectins was determined in five bean 
cultivars grown at five locations in Mexico. TI and tannins contents in colored 
beans that belong to the Jalisco race were higher (11.1-11.9 trypsin units 
inhibited (TUI)/mg and 29.0-38.1 mg catechin equivalent (CE)/g, respectively) 
than cultivars of the Durango race (7.9-8.3 TUI/mg and 16.8-19.9 CE/mg, 
respectively). Bayo Victoria, a Durango race cultivar, had three times more 
lectins than levels reported for soybean. Cultivar influenced TI and tannins 
contents (p < 0.001), whereas site affected lectins (p < 0.001). An increase in 
levels of TI and tannins could be enhanced through breeding.

A rapid HPLC-diode array detection (DAD) method was developed for the routine 
analysis of 16 anthocyanins in wine. Direct injection of filtered wine samples 
followed by selective detection at 520 nm allowed quantitation of these 
compounds in red wines. The method was linear for malvidin-3-glucoside over the 
range 5-250ppm, and the limit of detection for this compound was 0.18 ppm. A 
volatile mobile phase is used, which enables hyphenation to mass spectrometry 
(MS). With HPLC-MS, a total of 44 pigments could be identified in South African 
wines. Obtained mass spectra are discussed for a series of representative wine 
constituents and results are compared with literature references. An attempt was 
made to differentiate between different cultivars according to the anthocyanin 
content using stepwise forward linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

The effect of wild blueberry consumption on anthocyanin (ACNs) distribution and 
metabolism in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was investigated. Thirty-two rats were 
fed for 4 or 8 weeks with a control (C) or a wild blueberry-enriched diet (8%) 
(WB). Anthocyanin profile in plasma, urine, feces, brain, and liver was 
evaluated by LC-MS/MS, and significantly increased in urine and not in feces 
after 8 weeks on the WB diet compared to that in 4 weeks, but no anthocyanins 
were detected in plasma, liver, and brain samples either in the C or WB groups. 
Metabolites of ACNs were detected in the plasma, urine, feces, and tissues of 
both the C and WB groups, but the urinary excretion of hippuric acid increased 
significantly after 4 and 8 weeks of WB consumption. Thus, it seems that ACNs 
are metabolized by the intestinal microflora to respective phenyl-alkyl acids, 
which can be further metabolized to benzoic acid. In conclusion, ACNs are 
bioavailable in rats, and the extent of their metabolism and excretion is based 
on diet duration. Additionally, urinary hippuric acid content could represent a 
potential biomarker of ACNs absorption and metabolism in the SD rat under the 
present experimental conditions.

with a recovery for both compounds of about 100% in plasma and about 60% in 
urine. The chromatographic separation was performed with a RP-ODS column using a 
water-acetonitrile linear gradient. The calibration curve was linear for both 
biophenols over the range 2.5-1000 ng/ml (LOD 1.25 ng/ml) for plasma and 5-1000 
ng/ml (LOD 2.5 ng/ml) for urine. Plasma concentrations of oleuropein and 
hydroxytyrosol were measured after oral administration of a single dose (100 
mg/kg) of oleuropein. Analysis of treated rat plasma showed the presence of 
unmodified oleuropein, reaching a peak value of 200 ng/ml within 2 h, with a 
small amount of hydroxytyrosol, whereas in urine, both compounds were mainly 
found as glucuronides.

OBJECTIVE: Because consumption of teas may be associated with potential health 
benefits due to its content in polyphenols and in Western countries the 
consumption of tea is equally divided between the hot and the ready-to-drink 
(RTD) cold versions of this typical beverage, the aim of this work was to study 
the absorption and metabolism of flavan-3-ols in human volunteers after the 
ingestion of a commercial RTD tea.
METHODS: A feeding study was carried out in 20 healthy human volunteers and 
urine samples were collected for 24h after tea ingestion. Flavan-3-ols-derived 
molecules were identified and quantified in urine samples by high-performance 
liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection.
RESULTS: Eight relevant metabolites were identified in urine, all modified 
flavan-3-ols with the exception of unmetabolized gallic acid. The urinary 
excretion of flavan-3-ols was equal to 7.2% of the intake with tea. Gallic acid, 
which was abundant in the RTD tea used in this study, reached a 4.5% of the 
drunken amount.
CONCLUSIONS: The bioavailability values observed are in agreement with previous 
reports, although the dosage of polyphenols ingested in this study is remarkably 
lower. Moreover, the use of a group of 20 volunteers, more than the average 
number of subjects used for usual human acute-feeding studies involving 
polyphenols, provides additional credibility to the results. After drinking the 
RTD ice tea used in this study, the internal compartments are exposed to 
non-marginal doses of flavanols and flavanol metabolites up to 24h.

This systematic review summarizes findings from human studies investigating the 
different routes of absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion (ADME) of 
dietary flavan-3-ols and their circulating metabolites in healthy subjects. 
Literature searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science. 
Human intervention studies using single and/or multiple intake of flavan-3-ols 
from food, extracts, and pure compounds were included. Forty-nine human 
intervention studies met inclusion criteria. Up to 180 metabolites were 
quantified from blood and urine samples following intake of flavan-3-ols, mainly 
as phase 2 conjugates of microbial catabolites (n = 97), with 
phenyl-γ-valerolactones being the most representative ones (n = 34). Phase 2 
conjugates of monomers and phenyl-γ-valerolactones, the main compounds in both 
plasma and urine, reached two peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of 260 and 
88 nmol/L at 1.8 and 5.3 h (Tmax) after flavan-3-ol intake. They contributed to 
the bioavailability of flavan-3-ols for over 20%. Mean bioavailability for 
flavan-3-ols was moderate (31 ± 23%, n bioavailability values = 20), and it 
seems to be scarcely affected by the amount of ingested compounds. While intra- 
and inter-source differences in flavan-3-ol bioavailability emerged, mean 
flavan-3-ol bioavailability was 82% (n = 1) and 63% (n = 2) after 
(-)-epicatechin and nut (hazelnuts, almonds) intake, respectively, followed by 
25% after consumption of tea (n = 7), cocoa (n = 5), apples (n = 3) and grape 
(n = 2). This highlights the need to better clarify the metabolic yield with 
which monomer flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins are metabolized in humans. This 
work clarified in a comprehensive way for the first time the ADME of a 
(poly)phenol family, highlighting the pool of circulating compounds that might 
be determinants of the putative beneficial effects linked to flavan-3-ol intake. 
Lastly, methodological inputs for implementing well-designed human and 
experimental model studies were provided.

Determination of free phenolic compounds in potato samples was optimized using a 
high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with on-line diode array 
detection. This method was applied to samples of four cultivars of potatoes 
harvested in Tenerife (Canary Islands). The free phenolic compounds found in the 
potato samples were (+)-catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric 
acid, and ferulic acid. Potato samples belonging to Colorada cultivar, ssp. 
andigena, had mean concentrations of total phenolic compounds and chlorogenic 
acid higher than those found for Kerr's Pink and Cara cultivars, ssp. tuberosum, 
and for Negra cultivar, S. x chaucha. In contrast, p-coumaric acid was not 
detected in any potato samples of the Colorada cultivar. Traditional potatoes 
presented a higher mean concentration of ferulic acid than recently imported 
potatoes. A significant and negative correlation was established between 
(+)-catechin and p-coumaric acid. A considerable contribution to the daily 
intake of flavonoids was observed with the actual consumption of potatoes.

The pigments responsible for the yellow-orange coloration of apple juices have 
remained largely unknown up to now. Four French cider apple juices were produced 
in conditions similar to those used in the cider-making industry. The oxidized 
juices, characterized using the CIE L a b parameters, displayed various colors 
depending on the apple variety and native phenolic composition. HPLC-DAD-MS 
revealed contrasting pigment profiles related to oxidized tanning and nontanning 
molecules. The latter were divided into two groups according to their polarity 
and their visible spectra. With regard to phenolic classes, flavanol monomers 
and hydroxycinnamic acids played an essential role in the formation of oxidation 
products. Interestingly, dihydrochalcones appeared to include precursors of some 
yellow compounds. Indeed, the yellow pigment phloretin xyloglucoside oxidation 
product (PXGOPj), derived from phloretin xyloglucoside, was clearly identified 
in apple juices as a xyloglucose analogue of the yellow pigment phloridzin 
oxidation product (POPj), previously characterized in a model solution by Le 
Guernevé et al. (Tetrahedron Lett. 2004, 45 (35), 6673-6677).

Processed fruits and vegetables have been long considered to have lower 
nutritional value than their fresh commodities due to the loss of vitamin C 
during processing. This research group found vitamin C in apples contributed < 
0.4% of total antioxidant activity, indicating most of the activity comes from 
the natural combination of phytochemicals. This suggests that processed fruits 
and vegetables may retain their antioxidant activity despite the loss of vitamin 
C. Here it is shown that thermal processing elevated total antioxidant activity 
and bioaccessible lycopene content in tomatoes and produced no significant 
changes in the total phenolics and total flavonoids content, although loss of 
vitamin C was observed. The raw tomato had 0.76 +/- 0.03 micromol of vitamin C/g 
of tomato. After 2, 15, and 30 min of heating at 88 degrees C, the vitamin C 
content significantly dropped to 0.68 +/- 0.02, 0.64 +/- 0.01, and 0.54 +/- 0.02 
micromol of vitamin C/g of tomato, respectively (p < 0.01). The raw tomato had 
2.01 +/- 0.04 mg of trans-lycopene/g of tomato. After 2, 15, and 30 min of 
heating at 88 degrees C, the trans-lycopene content had increased to 3.11+/- 
0.04, 5.45 +/- 0.02, and 5.32 +/- 0.05 mg of trans-lycopene/g of tomato (p < 
0.01). The antioxidant activity of raw tomatoes was 4.13 +/- 0.36 micromol of 
vitamin C equiv/g of tomato. With heat treatment at 88 degrees C for 2, 15, and 
30 min, the total antioxidant activity significantly increased to 5.29 +/- 0.26, 
5.53 +/- 0.24, and 6.70 +/- 0.25 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of tomato, 
respectively (p < 0.01). There were no significant changes in either total 
phenolics or total flavonoids. These findings indicate thermal processing 
enhanced the nutritional value of tomatoes by increasing the bioaccessible 
lycopene content and total antioxidant activity and are against the notion that 
processed fruits and vegetables have lower nutritional value than fresh produce. 
This information may have a significant impact on consumers' food selection by 
increasing their consumption of fruits and vegetables to reduce the risks of 
chronic diseases.

The effects of the phenolic compounds of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on AGS 
cells have never been studied so far, which is the aim of this study. The 
profiles of the main phenolic components in EVOOs, mainly secoiridoid compounds 
derived from the transformation of oleuropein during the olive milling process, 
were evaluated and compared. Oils of different origins were evaluated aiming at 
verifying whether chemical differences in the phenolic composition of the dry 
extracts played a role in the metabolism and in maintaining the cellular redox 
state of AGS cells. The following key enzymes of some metabolic pathways were 
studied: lactate dehydrogenase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, glucose 6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and hexokinase. 
As confirmed through PCA analysis, pretreatments with the dry extracts of EVOOs 
at different concentrations appeared to be able to counteract the enzymatic 
activity alterations due to oxidative stress induced by H2O2 1 mM and 2 mM. The 
studied phytocomplexes showed the ability to protect AGS cells from oxidative 
damage and the secoiridoid derivatives from both oleuropein and ligstroside 
contributed to the observed effects. The results suggested that EVOOs with 
medium to high concentrations of phenols can exert this protection.

Common bean effects on health have been related to its dietary fiber content and 
other active compounds. This study assessed the content of flavonoids, 
coumestrol, phenolic acids, galactooligosaccharides, and phytic acid in wild and 
cultivated Mexican common bean seeds (raw and cooked) and that of flavonoids, 
coumestrol, and phenolic acids in germinated bean seeds. The presence of 
isoflavones in raw bean seeds was not confirmed by the UV spectra. Quercetin, 
kaempferol, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and vanillic 
acid mean contents were 10.9, 52.3, 10.1, 9.6, 5.4, and 18.2 microg/g, 
respectively; raffinose, stachyose, verbascose, and phytic acid mean contents 
were 8.5, 56.3, 5.5, and 11.5 mg/g, respectively, in raw seeds. All compounds 
were affected by autoclaving, and germination resulted in a de novo synthesis of 
flavonols, phytoestrogens, and phenolic acids. The impact on health of common 
bean seed is affected by dietary burden, specific compounds content, and 
processing. On the other hand, germinated bean seed or beans sprouts may be 
sources of antioxidants and phytoestrogens.

Thermal treatments can improve the processing suitability and nutritional 
utilization of cereals. In this study, the effects of three thermal treatments, 
namely heat fluidization, microwave, and baking, on the physical, nutritional, 
and structural properties of whole grain black Tartary buckwheat (BTB), as well 
as the multiscale structures and digestive characteristics of in-kernel 
starches, were evaluated. Thermal treatments induced grain expansion, surface 
cracking, and porous internal structures, with heat fluidization causing the 
most significant reduction (32.06 %) in kernel hardness. Heat fluidization also 
enhanced rutin extractability by 68.00 % and antioxidant activities. Volatile 
compound analysis revealed heat fluidization reduced aldehyde and hydrocarbon 
levels, especially reducing hexanal from 27.06 to 3.86 mg/kg. For in-kernel 
starches, heat fluidization increased cold-water viscosity (56-fold), disrupted 
A-type crystallinity (relative crystallinity dropped to 8.49 %), reduced 
short-range ordered structure (R993/1018 decreased by 2.21 %), and enhanced 
resistant starch content (33 %). The study highlighted heat fluidization as the 
most effective method for enhancing processing and nutritional properties of 
whole grain BTB, offering insights for developing nutrient-dense whole grain 
products.

Phenolic composition and antioxidant capacity of 20 oat genotypes differing in 
hull color were investigated. Phenolic aldehydes, phenolic acids, 
avenanthramides and mono-, and diglycerides were identified in the soluble 
phenolic fraction of the genotypes. The bound phenolic fraction proved to be 
less diverse with phenolic aldehydes, phenolic acids and a ferulic acid 
dehydrodimer detected. Investigating the scavenging capacity of the hull and 
groat toward 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), an increased antioxidant 
activity (AOA) of hull compared to groats and a color dependence of the hull AOA 
could be observed. Principal component analysis on the determined variables 
revealed that the black-hulled samples were different from the white ones due to 
their increased phenolic content detected in the hull. However, reddish-hulled 
varieties were grouping with the accessions of the other colored groups. In 
addition, a distinction between spring and winter cultivars was also observed.

In this work, a new CE method with diode array detection (DAD) was developed for 
the monitoring and quantitation of flavonoids in different beans treated and 
untreated with UV-B radiation. Flavonoid concentration was monitored in 
UV-B-treated and untreated sprouts of three common beans (Zolfino ecotype, cv. 
Verdone, cv. Lingua di Fuoco) and one soybean (cv. Pacific). After acid 
hydrolysis of extracts, the CE-DAD method provides reproducible quantitative 
determinations of daidzein, glycitein, genistein, and kaempferol at ppm level in 
these natural matrices within a relatively short time (less than 16 min). Total 
flavonoid content determined by CE-DAD was 159 +/- 8, 26 +/- 2, 13 +/- 1, and 
1.3 +/- 0.3 microg/g fresh weight for untreated sprouts of Pacific soybean, 
Verdone bean, Zolfino bean, and Lingua di Fuoco bean, respectively. UV-B 
treatment caused no significant quantitative effect on Pacific soybean sprouts, 
whereas it enhanced the total isoflavone content by 1.5, 1.8, and 3.2-fold in 
Verdone, Zolfino, and Lingua di Fuoco beans, respectively. The proposed method 
shows (i) the potentialities of bean sprouts as a natural source of bioactive 
compounds (antioxidants); (ii) the technological role of UV-B treatment for 
sprout isoflavone enrichment; and (iii) the good capabilities of CE-DAD to 
monitor this process.

Column liquid chromatography on a C18-bonded silica column with 
water-methanol-acetic acid as eluent was used to determine polyphenols and 
caffeine in tea. Without any pretreatment, catechin, epicatechin gallate, 
epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epicatechin and caffeine were 
separated successfully within 15 min. The detection limits (S/N = 3) of 
polyphenols studied were 1.8-24 mg/l at a detection wavelength 270 nm. The 
linear range of the peak area calibration curves for the analytes were over two 
orders of magnitude with a correlation coefficient of 0.996-0.999. Using this 
method, some Chinese tea samples were analyzed with a good reproducibility (RSD 
are below 5%).

Phenolic compounds in loquat fruit were identified as 5-caffeoylquinic acid 
(chlorogenic acid), neochlorogenic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, 5-p-feruloylquinic 
acid, protocatechuic acid, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, epicatechin, o-coumaric acid, 
ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid. Neochlorogenic acid was found to be dominant 
in the early stages of loquat fruit development. Both the concentrations and 
types of phenolic compounds were high in young fruit but then decreased steadily 
during growth. However, the concentration of chlorogenic acid increased during 
ripening and became predominant in ripe fruit. The large rise in chlorogenic 
acid concentration appears to be a characteristic of loquat fruit ripening. In 
all of the cultivars tested, the types of phenolic compounds were similar but 
the total phenolic content varied from 81.8 to 173.8 mg/100 g of fresh pulp. In 
the biosynthetic pathway of chlorogenic acid, the enzyme activities of 
phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (CL), and 
hydroxycinnamoyl CoA:quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (CQT) were high at the 
early stage of growth, diminished to low levels approximately 3 weeks prior to 
harvest, but then rose to a peak at 1 week before harvest. The changes of these 
enzyme activities seemed to be associated with variations in chlorogenic acid 
concentration during development, maturation, and ripening of loquat fruit.

The possibility of proving the undeclared addition of pumpkin puree in apricot 
nectars and jams has been investigated by using the phenol compound fingerprint 
and sensory evaluation. The cheaper pumpkin admixtures in apricot nectars and 
jams could not be detected by the sensory evaluation, particularly if present in 
quantities of <15%. The lower admixtures of pumpkin puree in apricot nectars and 
jams could be detected by the presence of syringic acid, a phenolic compound 
characteristic of the investigated pumpkins (Cucurbita pepo cv. Gleisdorff and 
Table Gold, Cucurbita maxima cv. Turkinja, and Cucurbita moschata cv. Argenta). 
Syringic acid was isolated from pumpkin puree and determined by using HPLC with 
diode array detection. By using the phenolic profile, undeclared pumpkin 
admixture (> or =5%) in the apricot nectars and jams could be proven.

Lentils (Lens culinaris L.) are a popular food in many countries. However, 
little is known about their phenolic composition. Because polyphenols in lentils 
are located essentially in their seed coat, the objective of this work was to 
study the composition of proanthocyanidins, the major group of polyphenols, in 
this part of the tissue. The use of C(18) Sep-Pak cartridges permitted the 
fractionation of lentil seed coat extract into monomer, oligomer, and polymer 
proanthocyanidin fractions. Subsequent thiolysis of oligomer and polymer 
fractions followed by HPLC analysis allowed the mean degree of polymerization 
(mDP) and the structural composition of proanthocyanidins to be determined. A 
fractionation of lentil seed coat extracts on a polyamide column followed by 
HPLC and HPLC-DAD-MS analyses was used to identify the individual 
proanthocyanidins. The results showed that the major monomeric flavan-3-ol was 
(+) catechin-3-glucose, with lesser amounts of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin. 
In the oligomer fraction, various dimer, trimer, and tetramer proanthocyanidins 
constituted of catechin, gallocatechin, and catechin gallate units were 
identified, and several procyanidins and prodelphinidins from pentamers to 
nonamers constitute the polymer fraction. The most abundant proanthocyanidins in 
the seed coat of lentils are the polymers (65-75%), with a mDP of 7-9, followed 
by the oligomers (20-30%), with a mDP of 4-5.

Anthocyanins and derived components of red wines were determined by microHPLC 
using a 1 mm ID HPLC column coupled on-line with an MS detector equipped with an 
ESI (ElectroSpray Ionisation) source. The use of microcolumn HPLC greatly 
enhanced detection performance, allowing direct identification of components 
present in the fraction. Nineteen anthocyanins were detected. Fifteen were 
identified, two were tentatively identified, and only the aglycon of the 
remaining two components was certainly identified. Six anthocyanin-derived 
pigments, supposedly formed during wine maturation, were also investigated and 
found in a wine sample. The analysis of red wine anthocyanins was also carried 
out by injecting a large sample volume onto a 0.32 mm ID HPLC column, using the 
column focusing technique, in order to decrease the limit of detection and 
quantification of components present in a very small amounts.

Four high yielding and early maturing cultivars of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) 
namely UPAS-120, ICPL-87, ICPL-151 and, especially, Manak, contained significant 
amounts of polyphenols (1075 to 1328 mg/100g), which may limit their 
utilization. The effectiveness of soaking (6, 12 and 18 h, 30 degrees C), 
soaking and dehulling, ordinary cooking, pressure cooking and germination (24, 
36, 48 h, 30 degrees C) in reducing the levels of polyphenols was investigated. 
A decrease in the polyphenolic contents varying from 4 to 26 percent in 
different pigeon pea cultivar was achieved. Pressure cooking of soaked-dehulled 
seeds was found to be the most effective method, followed by sprouting for 48 h, 
ordinary cooking of soaked-dehulled seeds, and pressure cooking of soaked whole 
seeds followed by sprouting for 36 h.

Eight varieties of lettuce (Lactuca sativum) and three varieties of endive 
(Cichorium endivia) were analyzed for flavonoid composition and content. Total 
flavonoid contents, expressed as units of aglycon for fresh material, were in 
the ranges of 0.3-229 microg/g for lettuce and 44-248 microg/g for endive. Five 
quercetin conjugates [quercetin 3-O-galactoside, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, 
quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, quercetin 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside, and quercetin 
3-O-rhamnoside] and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide were measured in the green-leafed 
lettuce and an additional two cyanidin conjugates [cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and 
cyanidin 3-O-[(6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] in the red-leafed varieties. Three 
kaempferol conjugates [kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-glucuronide, and 
kaempferol 3-O-[6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] were measured in each of the endive 
varieties. The presence and identity of kaempferol 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside in 
endive was shown for the first time. Shredding of lettuce leaf followed by 
exposure to light produced significant losses of the flavonoid moiety in the 
green oak leaf (94%), red oak leaf (43%), iceberg (36%), green batavia (25%), 
lollo biondo (24%), and lollo rosso (6%) samples, whereas cos and green salad 
bowl samples did not show an overall loss. Shredding of endive also produced 
loss of the flavonoid moiety in escarole (32%), fine frisee (13%), and coarse 
frisee (8%). Significant demalonation was observed for both the quercetin and 
cyanidin glucosides in lettuce, whereas a similar degradation of the kaempferol 
analogue was found in endive tissue. Storage of whole heads of both lettuce and 
endive in the dark at 1 degrees C and 98% humidity for 7 days resulted in losses 
of total flavonol glycosides in the range of 7-46%. The identification of the 
amounts, position of substitution, and nature of the sugars is important for 
understanding the potential bioavailability and biological activities of 
flavonoids in salads.

We determined the uptake and excretion of low doses of polyphenols in six 
subjects who each consumed 1.1 L of an alcoholic cider beverage. Over a 24-h 
period, no phloretin was detected in plasma (detection limit = 0.036 
micromol/L), but 21 +/- 5% of the dose (4.8 mg) was excreted in the urine. In 
contrast, from a low dose of 1.6-mg quercetin equivalents, no quercetin was 
found in urine or plasma, but 3'-methyl quercetin was detected in plasma [C(max) 
(maximum concentration) = 0.14 +/- 0.19 micromol/L; range: 0 to 0.44 
micromol/L]. No flavanol monomers (dose of free (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin 
= 3.5 mg) were detected in urine or plasma (detection limit: 0.01 micromol/L). 
Caffeic acid (total dose including esters = 11 mg) was detected only in plasma 
within 2 h, with C(max) = 0.43 +/- 0.3 micromol/L (range: 0.18 to 0.84 
micromol/L). An almost 3-fold increase in hippuric acid was detected in 24-h 
urine (74 +/- 29 micromol/L; range: 38-116 micromol/L), compared with a prestudy 
value of 19 +/- 9 micromol/L. These data show that polyphenols are taken up from 
cider, that phloretin is excreted in the urine and suggest that low doses of 
quercetin are extensively methylated in humans.

Berries are known to contain phenolic substances (i.e., flavonoids and phenolic 
acids), which comprise two large and heterogeneous groups of biologically active 
nonnutrients. This investigation evaluated the content and profile of the 
phenolic compounds present in six different berries found in Northern Europe. 
The latter included bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), cowberry (Vaccinium 
vitis-idaea), cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccus), strawberry (Fragaria ananassa), 
black currant (Ribes nigrum), and red currant (Ribes rubrum). The study was 
focused on two areas. The first involved the extraction and analysis of berries 
for total phenolic content and determination of their antioxidant activity. The 
total phenolic level of berries was correlated with their antioxidant activity. 
Second, the berry extracts were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis to 
determine the content and profile of selected bioactive compounds. The analytes 
of interest included trans-resveratrol, cinnamic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric 
acid, quercetin, and morin.

Antioxidant capacity, as measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), 
and total phenolic and total anthocyanin contents were evaluated in fruit 
tissues of 87 highbush blueberry (Vacciniumcorymbosum L.) and 
species-introgressed highbush blueberry cultivars. ORAC and phenolic levels were 
evaluated in leaf tissues of the same materials. Average values for ORAC, 
phenolics, and anthocyanins in fruit were 15.9 ORAC units, 1.79 mg/g (gallic 
acid equivalents), and 0.95 mg/g (cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents), 
respectively. Cv. Rubel had the highest ORAC per gram of fresh weight values, at 
31.1 units, and cv. Elliott had the highest values on the basis of ORAC per 
square centimeter of surface area. In leaf tissue, values for both ORAC and 
phenolics were significantly higher than in fruit tissue, with mean values of 
490 ORAC units and 44.80 mg/g (gallic acid equivalents), respectively. Leaf ORAC 
had a low, but significant, correlation with fruit phenolics and anthocyanins, 
but not with fruit ORAC. An analysis of ORAC values versus calculated midparent 
values in 11 plants from the 87-cultivar group in which all parents were tested 
suggested that, across cultivars, ORAC inheritance is additive. An investigation 
of ORAC values in a family of 44 cv. Rubel x Duke seedlings showed negative 
epistasis for ORAC values, suggesting Rubel may have gene combinations 
contributing to ORAC that are broken up during hybridization.

Citrus flavonoids have been investigated for their biological activity, with 
both anti-inflammatory and -carcinogenic effects being reported. However, little 
information is known on the bioavailability of these compounds in vivo. The 
objectives of this study were to determine the tissue distribution of naringenin 
after gastric gavage of [3H]-naringenin to rats. Unlabelled naringenin was also 
used to quantify the levels of naringenin and its major metabolites in tissues 
and eliminated in the urine and faeces. Significant radioactivity was detected 
in the plasma as well as all tissues examined 2h post-gavage. After 18h, higher 
levels of radioactivity were retained in plasma and tissues (55% of the 
administered radioactivity). Investigation of the nature of metabolites, using 
unlabelled naringenin, revealed that the glucuronides were the major components 
in plasma, tissues and urine, in addition to the colonic metabolite 
3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid, detected in the urine. The aglycone was the 
form extensively retained in tissues after 18h post-gavage. Total identified 
metabolites detected after 18h in most tissues were only 1-5% of the levels 
detected after 2h. However, the brain, lungs and heart retained 27, 20 and 11%, 
respectively, relative to the total metabolites detected at 2h. While 
radioactive detection suggests increased levels of breakdown products of 
naringenin after 18 h versus 2 h, the products identified using unlabelled 
naringenin are not consistent with this, suggesting that a predominant 
proportion of the naringenin breakdown products at 18 h are retained as smaller 
decomposition molecules which cannot yet be identified.

Recent reports have demonstrated various cardiovascular and neurological 
benefits associated with the consumption of foods rich in anthocyanidins. 
However, information regarding absorption, metabolism, and especially, tissue 
distribution are only beginning to accumulate. In the present study, we 
investigated the occurrence and the kinetics of various circulating pelargonidin 
metabolites, and we aimed at providing initial information with regard to tissue 
distribution. Based on HPLC and LC-MS analyses we demonstrate that pelargonidin 
is absorbed and present in plasma following oral gavage to rats. In addition, 
the main structurally related pelargonidin metabolite identified in plasma and 
urine was pelargonidin glucuronide. Furthermore, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, a ring 
fission product of pelargonidin, was detected in plasma and urine samples 
obtained at 2 and 18 h after ingestion. At 2 h post-gavage, pelargonidin 
glucuronide was the major metabolite detected in kidney and liver, with levels 
reaching 0.5 and 0.15 nmol pelargonidin equivalents/g tissue, respectively. 
Brain and lung tissues contained detectable levels of the aglycone, with the 
glucuronide also present in the lungs. Other tissues, including spleen and 
heart, did not contain detectable levels of pelargonidin or ensuing metabolites. 
At 18 h post-gavage, tissue analyses did not reveal detectable levels of the 
aglycone nor of pelargonidin glucuronides. Taken together, our results 
demonstrate that the overall uptake of the administered pelargonidin was 18 % 
after 2 h, with the majority of the detected levels located in the stomach. 
However, the amounts recovered dropped to 1.2 % only 18 h post-gavage, with the 
urine and faecal content constituting almost 90 % of the total recovered 
pelargonidin.

The effects of cooking treatments (boiling, autoclaving and microwave cooking) 
and germination on the nutritional composition and antinutritional factors of 
chickpeas were studied. Cooking treatments and/or germination caused significant 
(p < 0.05) decreases in fat, total ash, carbohydrate fractions, antinutritional 
factors, minerals and B-vitamins. Germination was less effective than cooking 
treatments in reducing trypsin inhibitor, hemagglutinin activity, tannins and 
saponins; it was more effective in reducing phytic acid, stachyose and 
raffinose. Cooking treatments and germination decreased the concentrations of 
lysine, tryptophan, total aromatic and sulfur-containing amino acids. However, 
cooked and germinated chickpeas were still higher in lysine, isoleucine and 
total aromatic amino acid contents than the FAO/WHO reference. The losses in 
B-vitamins and minerals in chickpeas cooked by microwaving were smaller than in 
those cooked by boiling and autoclaving. Germination resulted in greater 
retention of all minerals and B-vitamins compared to cooking treatments. In 
vitro protein digestibility, protein efficiency ratio and essential amino acid 
index were improved by all treatments. The chemical score and limiting amino 
acid of chickpeas subjected to the various treatments varied considerably, 
depending on the type of treatment. Based on these results, microwave cooking 
appears to be the best alternative for legume preparation in households and 
restaurants.

A HPLC method was developed for the analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside 
(SDG) and hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in milled defatted flaxseed flour. 
Direct extraction by 1 M NaOH for 1 h at 20 degrees C resulted in a higher yield 
than that obtained by hydrolysis of alcoholic extracts. An internal standard, 
o-coumaric acid, was used and the method was found to be easy, fast, and with 
good repeatability. On dry matter basis, different samples of flaxseeds varied 
considerably in their content of (+)-SDG (11.9-25.9 mg/g), (-)-SDG (2.2-5.0 
mg/g), p-coumaric acid glucoside (1.2-8.5 mg/g), and ferulic acid glucoside 
(1.6-5.0 mg/g).

Oat milling fractions were examined for concentrations of total phenolics, 
tocols, and phenolic acids and in vitro antioxidant activity to determine their 
potential as dietary antioxidants. Methanolic extracts of pearling fractions, 
flour and aspirations from flaking, and trichomes had high, intermediate, and 
low antioxidant activities, respectively, evaluated by the beta-carotene 
bleaching method. Pearling fractions were also highest in total phenolics and 
tocols. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, vanillin, p-coumaric 
acid, and ferulic acid were identified and quantified by HPLC. Three 
avenanthramides and an unidentified ferulate derivative were also detected. 
Total phenolic content was significantly correlated with antioxidant activity, 
and regression equations that predicted antioxidant activity from phenolic and 
tocol concentrations were calculated. Antioxidant activity, evaluated by 
beta-carotene bleaching, was correlated with measures of oxygen radical 
absorbance capacity and low-density lipoprotein oxidation. These data indicate a 
potential for oat products, especially those enriched in outer layers of the 
groat, to contribute to dietary intakes of antioxidant phytonutrients.

Sichuan Congou black tea (SCGBT), one of China's top three high-aroma black 
teas, enjoys widespread consumer popularity. However, research into optimal 
processing varieties remains insufficient. This study assessed the quality of 
SCGBT produced from eight tea varieties: 'Fudingdabai' (FDDB), 'Zhongcha 302' 
(ZC302), 'Wuniuzao' (WNZ), 'Chuancha 2' (CC2), 'Fuxuan 9' (FX9), 'Mingshan 131' 
(MS131), 'Zhongcha 108' (ZC108), and 'Huangjinya' (HJY). Sensory evaluation, 
quantitative chemical analysis, and metabolomics techniques were employed. 
Results indicated that HJY, ZC302, and MS131 exhibited strong sweetness, umami, 
and mellowness, while CC2, FX9, and ZC108 were characterized by intense 
bitterness and astringency, attributed to high tea polyphenol levels and low 
free amino acid concentrations. The quality of WNZ and FDDB was relatively 
average. Using non-targeted metabolomics, 4,476 metabolite ion features were 
detected, and 75 significantly differential metabolites were identified 
(p < 0.05 and VIP > 1.0). Correlation analysis revealed that metabolites such as 
valine, L-glutamic acid, asparagine, L-serine, 
kaempferol-3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, quercetin-7-O-glucoside, L-tyrosine, 
and L-norleucine significantly influenced the taste of the tea infusion 
(|r| > 0.8, p < 0.05). Elevated levels of amino acids (L-glutamic acid and 
asparagine) and phenolic acids (gallic acid) contributed to the umami of HJY, 
ZC302, and MS131. Astringency was primarily determined by variations in 
flavonol/flavone and flavonol/flavone glycosides, as well as ester catechins. 
Additionally, the content of sweet-tasting amino acids and non-ester catechins 
was found to fluctuate. In summary, ZC302, MS131, and HJY are more suitable for 
processing into higher-grade SCGBT. These findings provide a theoretical and 
practical foundation for selecting and breeding high-quality SCGBT varieties and 
ensuring consistent product quality.

The polyphenolic composition of 62 wild and weedy Mexican bean collections from 
diverse origins, grouped by their seed coat color, was assessed. According to 
spectrophotometric analysis, the range of total phenols, condensed tannins, and 
total anthocyanins presented wide differences. Furthermore, the phenolic acid, 
flavonoid, and anthocyanin profiles were analyzed using HPLC. Ferulic was the 
main phenolic acid. Kaempferol and quercetin were the main flavonoids, and the 
isoflavones daidzein and coumestrol were found in only low levels in few 
collections. Delphinidin was the main anthocyanidin found, followed by 
petunidin, cyanidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, and peonidin. The wide variation 
observed in polyphenolic contents was more related to their genotype than to the 
color factor. These results show that some wild and weedy beans are good sources 
of phenolic compounds for use in breeding programs focused on nutrition and 
health.

Isoflavone phytoestrogens found in soybeans are the most widely studied 
phytochemicals in human diets and soy infant formulas. The health benefits of 
the isoflavones daidzein and genistein have been reported, and concerns about 
potential adverse effects have also been raised. However, the results of direct 
analysis of isoflavones and their metabolites in biological fluids after 
consumption of soy-containing diets are scarce. This study describes an LC/MS/MS 
method for the analysis of isoflavones and their metabolites in the urine of 
female rats fed diets made with soy protein isolate. Five isoflavones (daidzein, 
genistein, glycitein, dihydrodaidzein, and O-desmethylangolensin) were 
identified by comparison with authentic standards. Seventeen conjugates of 
isoflavones were characterized in the urine, the most unusual being genistein 
5-glucuronide and four glucuronide conjugates of reductive metabolites of 
daidzein. The application of LC/MS/MS to analyze isoflavone metabolites is 
simple and sensitive, and appears to be an excellent method for determining the 
bioavailability and metabolism of food phytochemistry.

Naringin is a flavonoid that exists in many plants and traditional Chinese 
medicines. In this study, a highly sensitive and specific electrospray 
ionization (ESI) liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) 
method was developed for quantification of naringin and its two metabolites, 
naringenin and naringenin glucuronide. Naringin and naringenin were extracted 
from rat plasma with ethyl acetate, using hesperidin as an internal standard. 
Components in the extract were separated on a 100 mm x 2.0 mm Betabasic 5 microm 
C18 ODS column by isocratic elution with 70% methanol. The components were 
analyzed in the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode in the precursor/product 
ion pair of m/z 581.3/273.4 for naringin, m/z 273.4/153.1 for naringenin and m/z 
611.5/303.4 for hesperidin, respectively. Linear calibration curves were 
obtained in the range of 5-1000 ng/ml, using 0.1 ml rat plasma. The within-day 
coefficients of variation (CVs) were 3.1, 1.8 and 2.2% for naringin, 3.0, 3.3, 
3.1% for naringenin at 5, 50 and 500 ng/ml (n=5). The between-day CVs were 3.4, 
1.7 and 4.9% for naringin and 4.0, 3.0, 4.6% for naringenin (n=5) at 5, 50 and 
500 ng/ml respectively. A formulation based on PEG400 was used and orally 
administered to Sprague-Dawley male rats. Plasma drug concentrations were 
measured by this method and the pharmacokinetics was analyzed by WinNonlin 
computer software. Plasma concentration-time profiles of naringin were found to 
increase quickly and decline rapidly within 2 h and could not be detected after 
24 h. Naringenin and naringenin glucuronide occurred slower and the T(max) were 
about 9 and 7.5 h later, respectively.

Roasting greatly reduces the phenolic content in green coffee beans. Considering 
the beneficial effects of coffee polyphenols, blends containing green coffee 
beans are being consumed as a healthier alternative to roasted coffee. This 
study was aimed at assessing the absorption and metabolism of hydroxycinnamates 
in an instant green/roasted (35/65) coffee blend in healthy humans. Twelve 
fasting men and women consumed a cup of coffee containing 269.5 mg (760.6 μmol) 
of chlorogenic acids. Blood and urine samples were taken before and after coffee 
consumption at different times and analyzed by LC-MS-QToF. Up to 25 and 42 
metabolites were identified in plasma and urine, respectively, mainly in the 
form of sulfate and methyl derivatives, and to a lower extent as glucuronides. 
Un-metabolized hydroxycinnamate esters (caffeoyl-, feruloyl-, and 
coumaroylquinic acids), hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic, ferulic and coumaric 
acids) and their phase II metabolites, in addition to phase II derivatives of 
lactones, represented a minor group of metabolites (16.3% of the metabolites 
excreted in urine) with kinetics compatible with small intestine absorption. 
Dihydrohydroxycinnamic acids and their phase II derivatives, in addition to 
feruloylglycine, showed delayed kinetics due to their colonic origin and 
represented the most abundant group of metabolites (75.7% of total urinary 
metabolites). Dihydrohydroxycinnamate esters (dihydroferuloyl-, dihydrocaffeoyl- 
and dihydrocoumaroylquinic acids) have been identified for the first time in 
both plasma and urine, with microbial origin (excreted 8-12 h after coffee 
intake) amounting to 8% of total urinary metabolites. In conclusion, coffee 
polyphenols are partially bioavailable and extensively metabolized, mainly by 
the colonic microbiota.

The market for decaffeinated coffees has been increasingly expanding over the 
years. Caffeine extraction may result in losses of other compounds such as 
chlorogenic acids (CGA) and, consequently, their 1,5-gamma-quinolactones (CGL) 
in roasted coffee. These phenolic compounds are important for flavor formation 
as well as the health effects of coffee; therefore, losses due to decaffeination 
need to be investigated. The present study evaluates the impact of 
decaffeination processing on CGA and CGL levels of green and roasted arabica 
coffees. Decaffeination produced a 16% average increase in the levels of total 
CGA in green coffee (dry matter), along with a 237% increase in CGL direct 
precursors. Different degrees of roasting showed average increments of 5.5-18% 
in CGL levels of decaffeinated coffee, compared to regular, a change more 
consistent with observed levels of total CGA than with those of CGL direct 
precursors in green samples. On the other hand, CGA levels in roasted coffee 
were 3-9% lower in decaffeinated coffee compared to regular coffee. Although 
differences in CGA and CGL contents of regular and decaffeinated roasted coffees 
appear to be relatively small, they may be enough to affect flavor 
characteristics as well as the biopharmacological properties of the final 
beverage, suggesting the need for further study.

Unbalanced diets generate oxidative stress commonly associated with the 
development of diabetes, atherosclerosis, obesity and cancer. Dietary flavonoids 
have antioxidant properties and may limit this stress and reduce the risk of 
these diseases. We used a metabolomic approach to study the influence of 
catechin, a common flavonoid naturally occurring in various fruits, wine or 
chocolate, on the metabolic changes induced by hyperlipidemic diets. Male Wistar 
rats ( n = 8/group) were fed during 6 weeks normolipidemic (5% w/w) or 
hyperlipidemic (15 and 25%) diets with or without catechin supplementation (0.2% 
w/w). Urines were collected at days 17 and 38 and analyzed by reverse-phase 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF). Hyperlipidic diets led to a 
significant increase of oxidative stress in liver and aorta, upon which catechin 
had no effect. Multivariate analyses (PCA and PLS-DA) of the urine fingerprints 
allowed discrimination of the different diets. Variables were then classified 
according to their dependence on lipid and catechin intake (ANOVA). Nine 
variables were identified as catechin metabolites of tissular or microbial 
origin. Around 1000 variables were significantly affected by the lipid content 
of the diet, and 76 were fully reversed by catechin supplementation. Four 
variables showing an increase in urinary excretion in rats fed the high-fat 
diets were identified as deoxycytidine, nicotinic acid, dihydroxyquinoline and 
pipecolinic acid. After catechin supplementation, the excretion of nicotinic 
acid was fully restored to the level found in the rats fed the low-fat diet. The 
physiological significance of these metabolic changes is discussed.

Anthocyanins are phenolic compounds widely distributed in fruits and vegetables. 
Their consumption has been shown to prevent some chronic diseases. Anthocyanin 
metabolism, however, is still not fully understood. The aim of this work was to 
evaluate the bioavailability of anthocyanins in humans consuming a meal 
containing strawberries and to identify possible metabolites in urine. Six 
healthy volunteers (three women and three men) consumed a meal containing 200 g 
strawberries (providing 179 micro mol pelargonidin-3-glucoside). Urine samples 
were collected before and after the meal and rapidly treated by solid-phase 
extraction. Identification and quantification of anthocyanin metabolites were 
carried out by HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC with UV-visible detection, respectively. 
In addition to pelargonidin-3-glucoside, five anthocyanin metabolites were 
identified in urine: three monoglucuronides of pelargonidin, one sulfoconjugate 
of pelargonidin and pelargonidin itself. Total urinary excretion of strawberry 
anthocyanin metabolites corresponded to 1.80 +/- 0.29% (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) of 
pelargonidin-3-glucoside ingested. More than 80% of this excretion was related 
to a monoglucuronide. Four hours after the meal, more than two-thirds of 
anthocyanin metabolites had been excreted, although urinary excretion of the 
metabolites continued until the end of the 24-h experiment. This study 
demonstrated that anthocyanins were glucuro- and sulfo-conjugated in humans and 
that the main metabolite of strawberry anthocyanins in human urine was a 
monoglucuronide of pelargonidin.

The consumption of anthocyanins has been shown to prevent certain chronic 
diseases. However, anthocyanin metabolism has not yet been fully elucidated. The 
aim of this study was to evaluate anthocyanin urinary excretion in humans 
receiving a meal containing blackberries and to identify possible metabolites in 
urine. Five healthy volunteers were fed 200 g of blackberries (960 mumol of 
anthocyanins). Urine samples were collected and rapidly treated by solid-phase 
extraction. Anthocyanin metabolites were identified and quantified by 
HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC with UV-vis detection, respectively. In addition to 
native cyanidin 3-glucoside, several other anthocyanin metabolites were 
identified in the urine: methylated glycosides, glucuronides of anthocyanidins 
and anthocyanins, a sulfoconjugate of cyanidin, and anthocyanidins. Total 
urinary excretion of blackberry anthocyanin metabolites was 0.160 +/- 0.020% (n 
= 5) of the amount of anthocyanins ingested. Monoglucuronides of anthocyanidins 
represented >60% of this excretion. Urinary excretion of anthocyanins was 
maximal between 2 and 4 h after the meal, but continued during the 24 h of the 
experiment. This study highlighted the influence of aglycon structure on 
anthocyanin urinary excretion. It demonstrated that anthocyanins are not only 
methylated but also glucuroconjugated and sulfoconjugated in humans and that the 
main metabolites of blackberry anthocyanins in human urine were anthocyanidin 
monoglucuronides.

Anthocyanins are natural pigments that could be involved in various health 
effects. Red oranges are an important dietary source of anthocyanins, including 
cyanidin 3-glucoside (Cy 3-glc) and an acylated derivative, cyanidin 
3-(6''-malonyl)-glucoside (Cy 3-malglc). The aim of this study was to evaluate 
the absorption and metabolism of red orange anthocyanins in rats fed an 
anthocyanin-enriched diet for 12 d (approximately 2.8 micromol anthocyanins/d). 
Furthermore, the absorption of these anthocyanins was studied in both the 
stomach and intestine using in situ models in rats. Anthocyanin metabolites were 
identified and quantified by HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem MS and 
HPLC-diode array detection, respectively. The red orange anthocyanins, Cy 3-glc 
and Cy 3-malglc, as well as their respective methylated derivatives, were 
recovered in urine after red orange juice intake. The 24 h urinary excretion of 
total anthocyanins was low (0.081 (SEM 0.009) % of the ingested amount). 
However, a high proportion (about 20 %) of red orange anthocyanins was absorbed 
from the stomach. More Cy 3-malglc than Cy 3-glc was absorbed in the intestine. 
This study thus indicated that red orange juice anthocyanins were rapidly 
absorbed from both stomach and small intestine, and then excreted in the urine 
as intact and methylated forms. Moreover, the absorption and metabolism of 
acylated anthocyanins and non-acylated anthocyanins were similar.

The mechanism of uptake of anthocyanins (as well as the type) from food in the 
intestine is not clear. Anthocyanin-rich extract from wild mulberry, composed of 
cyanidin-3-glucoside (79%) and cyanidin-3-rutinoside (cy-3-rut) (19%), was 
orally administered to Wistar rats, and their concentrations were determined in 
plasma, kidney, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The 2 glycosylated forms 
showed maximum concentration at 15 minutes after oral administration, both in 
plasma and kidney. The cyanidin-3-glucoside and cy-3-rut were found in plasma as 
glucuronides, as sulfates of cyanidin, and as unchanged forms. The area under 
the curve of concentration vs time (AUC(0-8h)) was 2.76 +/- 0.88 microg hour/mL 
and 9.74 +/- 0.75 microg hour/g for plasma and kidney, respectively. In spite of 
the low absorption, the increase in plasma anthocyanin level resulted in a 
significant increase in antioxidant capacity (P < .05). In the GI tract (stomach 
and small and large intestines), cyanidin glycosides were found unchanged, but a 
low amount of the aglycone form was present. Anthocyanin glycosides were no 
longer detected in the GI tract after 8 hours of administration. In vitro 
fermentation showed that the 2 cyanidin glycosides were totally metabolized by 
the rat colonic microflora, explaining their disappearance. In addition, the 2 
products of their degradation, cyanidin and protocatechuic acid, were not 
detected in plasma and probably do not influence plasma antioxidant capacity. As 
found by the everted sac model, anthocyanins were transported across the 
enterocyte by the sodium-dependent glucose transporter.

metabolites) was low (0.20 +/- 0.03%, n = 8). Proportions of anthocyanin 
derivatives (methylated anthocyanins and glucurono-conjugated derivatives) 
differed according to the organ considered. The bladder contained the highest 
levels of anthocyanins followed by the prostate. Prostate, testes and heart 
contained native cyanidin 3-glucoside and a small proportion of cyanidin 
monoglucuronide. Cyanidin 3-glucoside and methylated derivatives were present in 
adipose tissue. Thus, anthocyanin feeding in rats resulted in a wide 
distribution of anthocyanin derivatives to several organs. Identification of 
target tissues of anthocyanins may then help to understand the mechanisms of 
action of anthocyanins in vivo.

In this study, the effects of three common cooking practices (i.e., boiling, 
steaming, and frying) on the artichoke phenolic compounds pattern were evaluated 
by LC-MS/MS analysis. The variation of carotenoids, antioxidant capacity, and 
artichoke physical properties after cooking was also investigated. The major 
phenolic compounds present in the raw sample were 5- O-caffeoylquinic and 
1,5-di- O-caffeoylquinic acids; after cooking treatments, an increase of the 
overall caffeoylquinic acids concentration due to the formation of different 
dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers was observed. Steamed and fried samples showed 
similar patterns of dicaffeoylquinic concentrations, which were higher with 
respect to the boiled samples. On the other hand, all cooking practices, 
particularly frying, decreased flavonoid concentration. The antioxidant capacity 
of cooked artichokes, measured by three different assays, enormously increased 
after cooking, particularly after steaming (up to 15-fold) and boiling (up to 
8-fold). The observed cooking effect on the artichoke antioxidant profile is 
probably due to matrix softening and increased extractability of compounds, but 
the increase of antioxidant capacity is much higher than the increase of 
antioxidant concentration. These results suggest that some common cooking 
treatments can be used to enhance the nutritional value of vegetables, 
increasing bioaccessibility of health-promoting constituents.

A field experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of fertilization 
level on the phenolic composition of tronchuda cabbage ( Brassica oleracea L. 
var. costata DC) external and internal leaves. Eight different plots were 
constituted: a control without fertilization, one with organic matter, and six 
experiments with conventional fertilizers (nitrogen, boron, and sulfur, two 
levels each). The phenolic compounds were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC-DAD. 
External and internal leaves revealed distinct qualitative composition. In the 
internal leaves were found 15 phenolics (5 kaempferol and 10 cinnamic acid 
derivatives), whereas the external leaves presented 3- p-coumaroylquinic acid 
and 13 kaempferol derivatives. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to 
assess the relationships between phenolic compounds, agronomical practices, and 
harvesting time. Samples obtained with conventional practices were quite 
effectively separated from organic samples, for both types of leaves. In 
general, samples developed without any fertilization presented the highest 
phenolics amounts: external and internal leaves contained 1.4- and 4.6-fold more 
phenolic compounds than the ones that received conventional fertilizer, 
respectively, and the internal leaves presented 2.4 times more phenolics than 
the ones grown with organic amendment. Additionally, samples from organic 
production exhibited higher total phenolics content than those from conventional 
practices, collected at the same time. Samples harvested first were revealed to 
be distinct from the ones collected later. The results show that it is possible 
to grow tronchuda cabbage without excess fertilizers, with highest amounts of 
phenolics and reduced environment contamination.

The present study explored the bioavailability and brain deposition of a grape 
seed polyphenolic extract (GSPE) previously found to attenuate cognitive 
deterioration in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma 
pharmacokinetic response of major GSPE phenolic components was measured 
following intragastric gavage of 50, 100, and 150 mg GSPE per kg body weight. 
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis identified gallic acid 
(GA), catechin (C), and epicatechin (EC) in plasma of rats gavaged acutely with 
GSPE. Additionally, 4-methylgallic acid (4-OMeGA), 3'-methylcatechin (3'-OMeC), 
and 3'-methylepicatechin (3'-OMeEC) were identified as circulating metabolites 
of GSPE phenolic constituents. Cmax for individual GSPE constituents and their 
metabolites increased in a dose-dependent fashion (with increasing GSPE oral 
dose). Repeated daily exposure to GSPE was found to significantly increase 
bioavailability (defined as plasma AUC0-8h) of GA, C, and EC by 198, 253, and 
282% relative to animals receiving only a single acute GSPE dose. EC and C were 
not detectable in brain tissues of rats receiving a single GSPE dose but reached 
levels of 290.7 +/-45.9 and 576.7 +/- 227.7 pg/g in brain tissues from rats 
administered GSPE for 10 days. This study suggests that brain deposition of GA, 
C, and EC is affected by repeated dosing of GSPE.

The simultaneous determination of 19 phenolic compounds was performed directly 
in wort and beer by a combination of reverse-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography coupled with coulometric array detection. Chromatographic 
separation was achieved with an appropriate gradient of flow and a binary 
solvent based on phosphate buffer, methanol, and acetonitrile in a 45-min run. 
Eight serial coulometric detectors were used for on-line generation of 
voltammetric data to resolve coeluting compounds. The method was reliable and 
sensitive, the regression coefficient of standard calibration curves is 0.972 < 
or = r < or = 1.000, and the standard deviation value ranges from 0.010 to 0.129 
mg/L for wort and from 0.002 to 0.332 mg/L for beer. The mean concentrations of 
phenolic acids were 22.1 and 33.8 mg/L, respectively, in worts and beers 
produced in Italy. These amounts represent 5 and 10% of the non-tannic, 
non-flavonoid phenols in wort and beer, respectively.

In vitro studies show that some individual minor polar phenolic compounds (MPC) 
present in virgin olive oil prevent oxidation of human low-density lipoproteins 
(LDL), but few data are available on the antioxidant effect of whole oil 
extract. Thus, whole virgin olive extracts were studied to determine whether 
they maintain the antioxidant activity and whether this last is linked to MPC 
composition of a single virgin oil. Using HPLC-DAD the MPC content in Taggiasca 
and Seggianese virgin olive oils was measured. Taggiasca oil was less rich in 
total MPC (208.5 mg/L) than Seggianese oil (441.9 mg/L). In addition, the major 
compounds of Taggiasca oil were lignan derivatives, whereas the major compounds 
in Seggianese oils were secoiridoid derivatives. Moreover, Taggiasca oil was 
practically free of 5-hydroxytyrosol and 5-hydroxytyrosol derivatives, 
deacetoxy-oleuropein aglycone and oleuropein aglycone. The antioxidant activity 
of the oils on human LDL was evaluated by measuring malondialdehyde and 
conjugate diene generation induced by copper ions. In both tests, the oil 
extracts dose-dependently reduced malondialdehyde and conjugate diene 
generation. Moreover, antioxidant potency correlated with total MPC; thus, 
Seggianese extract was more active. The two oils differed quantitatively and 
qualitatively, and these differences influenced their biological activities; 
thus clinical trials focused on studying the effects of olive oils should 
specify the oils used.

A fast, precise and selective diode array HPLC method is presented for the 
extraction and analysis of soy isoflavonoids from foods and from human urine, 
plasma, and breast milk in support of mechanistic and epidemiologic studies 
assessing the potential cancer protective role of soya or isoflavones. Solid 
phase or solvent extraction was chosen for isolation, and enzymatic or acid 
hydrolysis procedures were used for aglycone production depending on the matrix 
to be analyzed. C-18 reversed-phase HPLC was applied to selectively separate and 
quantitate daidzein (1), glycitein (3), and genistein (4), including their 
malonyl (a) and acetyl (b) esters, and their mammalian metabolites equol (6) and 
O-desmethylangolensin (7), as well as formononetin (2), biochanin-A (5), and 
coumestrol (8) using a gradient elution system. UV absorbance scans and 
authentic standards were applied for identification purposes, additional to 
fluorometric monitoring, electrochemical detection, and GC/ MS analysis after 
trimethyl silylation. Detection limits of 20-microl injections were found to be 
1.09, 0.53, 3.28, and 1.00 pmoles for daidzein, genistein, equol, and 
O-desmethylangolensin (DMA), respectively, by monitoring at the individual 
compound's absorption maximum. The proposed method was applied to monitor 
isoflavone levels in soy foods and in human plasma, urine and breast milk after 
challenge with roasted soybeans. Implications of the presented results on the 
potential activity of isoflavones to prevent cancer by exposing newborn infants 
to these agents are discussed.

Concentrations and glucosidic conjugation patterns of isoflavones were 
determined in soy foods consumed by multiethnic populations in Singapore and 
Hawaii. Six raw and 11 cooked food groups traditionally consumed in Singapore 
and 8 food groups consumed in Hawaii were analyzed by reversed-phase 
high-pressure liquid chromatography with diode array detection. Mean total 
isoflavone levels varied between 35 and 7500 ppm, with the lowest values found 
in soy milk and burgers and the highest levels observed in soybean and its seeds 
and in supplements. Total isoflavone levels and conjugation patterns varied as a 
function of soybean variety, storage conditions, and food processing. A large 
contribution to the differences in total isoflavone content between food groups 
was due to the water content in foods and to leaching of polar analytes into the 
water phase during boiling. Soy protein drinks and traditional soy foods were 
found to possess very similar isoflavone amounts considering usual serving 
sizes.

Seven healthy females and six males consumed daily 256 mg of vitamin C, 271 mg 
of flavanones (mainly as glycosides), 6 mg of carotenoids (mainly xanthophylls 
and cryptoxanthins), and 0.16 mg of folate by incorporation of daily three times 
236 mL of not from concentrate orange juice (OJ) into their habitual diet. At 
the end of 3 weeks, mean vitamin C, folate, carotenoid, and flavanone plasma 
concentrations increased significantly relative to baseline by 59% (p < 0.001), 
46% (p = 0.018), and 22% (p < 0.001), and 8-fold (p = 0.045), respectively. 
Flavanones were excreted in urine 9-fold more at the end of the intervention (p 
= 0.01) but returned to baseline 2 days after study completion. After the 3 week 
intervention, plasma concentrations of vitamins A and E did not change. 
8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine in white blood cells declined by 16% (p = 0.38; n = 11), 
and in individuals with high baseline concentrations by 29% (p = 0.36; n = 7), 
respectively. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-/high-density lipoprotein

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between 
dietary intake of phytoestrogens estimated by a food frequency questionnaire 
(FFQ) with urinary metabolites.
METHODS: Participants were 26 premenopausal, Caucasian women aged 25 to 42 
years. Dietary intake of isoflavones (genistein and daidzein) and lignans 
(secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol) were estimated by a 53-item 
interviewer-administered FFQ on two occasions, reflecting 'habitual' (previous 2 
months) and 'recent' (previous 2 days) dietary intake. Isoflavone (genistein, 
daidzein) and lignan (enterolactone, enterodiol and secoisolariciresinol) 
concentrations were measured in 24-hour urine samples by gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry. Correlations between FFQ (habitual and recent, separately) and 
urinary metabolite values were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients.
RESULTS: Mean habitual isoflavone and lignan intakes were 13.7 mg/day and 13.8 
mg/day, respectively. Mean urinary concentrations of isoflavones and lignans 
were 17.4 micromol/day and 20.6 micromol/day, respectively. Recent and habitual 
isoflavone intakes were correlated with urinary excretion of metabolites (r = 
0.64, p < 0.001 and r = 0.54, p = 0.004, respectively). Urinary excretion of 
lignans was also modestly correlated with recent and habitual lignan intakes (r 
= 0.46, p = 0.02 and r = 0.40, p = 0.05, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of this FFQ as a measure of dietary 
isoflavone and lignan intake in epidemiological studies.

It has been suggested that the isoflavone, genistein,, may have some role as a 
chemopreventive agent against cancer in humans. Levels of genistein and its 
beta-glucoside conjugate, genistin, ingested in soybeans and related bean 
products by the Japanese were quantified by HPLC, to estimate daily intake of 
these compounds. Amounts of genistein and genistin in soybeans, soy nuts and soy 
powder were in the range of 4.6 to 18.2 and 200.6 to 968.1 micrograms/g food, 
respectively. The values for soy milk and tofu (bean curd) were 1.9 to 13.9 and 
94.8 to 137.7 micrograms/g food, respectively. Levels of isoflavones in 
fermented soybean products, miso (bean paste) and natto (fermented soybeans), 
were 38.5 to 229.1 micrograms/g food for genistein and 71.7 to 492.8 
micrograms/g food for genistin. Thus, the level of genistein in the fermented 
soybean products was higher than in soy beans and soybean products such as soy 
milk and tofu. From these observations, it is suggested that the beta-glycosyl 
bond of genistin is cleaved to produce genistein by microbes during fermentation 
to yield miso and natto. Soy sauce was also found to contain both isoflavones, 
but at levels lower than in miso and natto. On the basis of these data for 
average annual consumption of soybeans and related products, daily intake of 
genistein and genistin by the Japanese is calculated to be 1.5-4.1 and 6.3-8.3 
mg/person, respectively. These levels are much higher than those for Americans 
or Western Europeans, whose mortality rates for breast, colon and prostate 
cancers are greater than the Japanese.

The aim of the presented work was to study the effect of pressing method, 
pasteurization, cultivar, and vintage on the content of (+)-catechin, 
(-)-epicatechin, and nine procyanidins in grape juice. The results showed that 
the concentration of these flavan-3-ols in the juice was influenced, in 
decreasing order of importance, by pressing method, cultivar, pasteurization, 
and vintage. Cold pressing without maceration was the least and hot pressing 
after maceration at 60 degrees C for 60 min the most effective method for 
extracting the flavan-3-ols. Pasteurization increased the concentration of 
catechins in cold-pressed juices, but it decreased concentrations in hot-pressed 
juices. The concentration of most procyanidins was increased by pasteurization. 
Among the white cultivars, Seyval and Niagara were highest in procyanidins and 
Elvira and Chardonnay were highest in catechins. Vincent, Foch, and Baco were 
the red cultivars highest in catechins, and Vincent also had the highest content 
of procyanidins.

Seed coats and cotyledons from 25 Brazilian and 3 Peruvian bean cultivars were 
investigated in relation to their phenolic profiles and antioxidant capacity. 
Condensed tannins, anthocyanins, and flavonols such as kaempferol and quercetin 
glycosides were mostly found in seed coats. Cotyledons were rich in phenolic 
acids, such as ferulic, sinapic, chlorogenic, and other hydroxycinnamic acids. 
In general, the seed coat color pattern and the type of cultivar showed an 
important influence on the variability of phenolic profiles and levels, 
respectively. Total phenolics and antioxidant capacity assessed by the DPPH 
method were higher in seed coats than in cotyledons. The antioxidant capacity 
had a significant correlation with condensed tannins for all samples and with 
total anthocyanins in black and red seed coats, whereas in cotyledons, it was 
more related to the total phenolic content.

Analysis of phenolics and flavonoids in juice beverages using reversed-phase 
HPLC with coulometric array detection is described. Sixteen serial coulometric 
detectors were used for on-line resolution of co-eluting compounds and 
generation of voltammetric data. Within each class of compounds, oxidation 
potential corresponded to specific substitution patterns where: catechol < 
methoxycatechol < monohydroxyl < methoxyl. Twenty-seven standard compounds were 
resolved in a 45-min run. The limits of detection were in the low ng/ml range 
with a linear response range of at least three orders of magnitude. Intra-run 
retention time variation was < 1% (R.S.D.) and adjacent sensor response ratios 
varied by < 5% (R.S.D.). The utility of this technique in generating 
multivariate data for differentiation of juices and juice mixtures is shown.

The concentrations of trans-resveratrol, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and 
quercetin were evaluated by means of high-performance liquid 
chromatography-diode array detection in red wines obtained from Aglianico, 
Piedirosso, and Nerello Mascalese grapes. The trans-resveratrol and epicatechin 
concentrations did not differ significantly between experimental wines. The 
concentration of quercetin in Nerello Mascalese wines was more than twice that 
observed in Aglianico and Piedirosso wines. Nerello Mascalese wines also 
significantly differed from other wines in the (+)-catechin content, which was 
significantly higher than those found in the other two wines. During maceration, 
the maximum extraction of trans-resveratrol was reached after 12 days for 
Aglianico and Piedirosso, after which a decline was observed. On the contrary, 
in the case of Nerello Mascalese, the concentration of trans-resveratrol 
increased steadily throughout the whole maceration process. After 2 days of 
maceration, the maximum concentration of quercetin was observed in Aglianico 
must, whereas the maximum quercetin extraction was reached after 12 days for 
Piedirosso and 17 days for Nerello Mascalese. The maximum levels of (+)-catechin 
and (-)-epicatechin were generally observed after 12 days of maceration for all 
wines, although a decline of (-)-epicatechin occurred after maximum extraction 
in Aglianico and Piedirosso wines. Following marc pressing, a significant 
increase in the concentration of trans-resveratrol for Aglianico, (+)-catechin 
and (-)-epicatechin for Piedirosso, and (-)-epicatechin for Nerello Mascalese 
was observed.

A simple, rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy 
(LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of ethyl 
gallate, a pharmacologically active constituent isolated from Lagerstroemia 
speciosa (Linn.) Pers. This method was used to examine the pharmacokinetics of 
ethyl gallate and its major metabolite gallic acid in rat plasma using propyl 
gallate as an internal standard. After precipitation of the plasma proteins with 
acetonitrile, the analytes were separated on a Zorbax SB-C(18) column (3.5 
microm, 2.1 x 50 mm) with an isocratic mobile phase consisted of 
methanol-acetonitrile-10 mM ammonium acetate (10 : 25 : 65, v/v/v) containing 
0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. The Agilent G6410A triple 
quadrupole LC/MS system was operated under the multiple-reaction monitoring mode 
using the electrospray ionization technique in negative mode. The lower limits 
of quantification of gallic acid and ethyl gallate of the method were 0.5 and 
1.0 ng/mL. The intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision of the assay were 
less than 8.0%. This method has been applied successfully to a pharmacokinetic 
study involving the intragastric administration of ethyl gallate to rats.

Reversed-phase liquid chromatography with electrospray 
ionization-high-resolution/accuracy Fourier transform mass spectrometry 
(RPC-ESI-FTMS) and chemometrics were exploited to evaluate the influence of 
horizontal centrifugation by two- or three-phase decanters on the content of 
major phenolic secoiridoids in extravirgin olive oils (EVOOs). Despite the 
occurrence of other potential sources of variability typical of commercial olive 
oils, horizontal centrifugation was found to play a primary role, with a general 
increase of secoiridoid content occurring when two-phase decanters were used. As 
emphasized by principal component analysis (PCA), the increase involved 
preferentially oleacin and oleocanthal, when oxidative deterioration was 
purposely minimized during and/or after production, and oleuropein and 
ligstroside aglycones, when no vertical centrifugation was performed at the end 
of the productive cycle. The influence of the type of horizontal centrifugation 
was also emphasized by the elaboration of RPC-ESI-FTMS data based on 
hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

Epidemiological studies suggest that a moderate consumption of anthocyanins may 
be associated with protection against coronary heart disease. The main dietary 
sources of anthocyanins include red-coloured fruits and red wine. Although 
dietary anthocyanins comprise a diverse mixture of molecules, little is known 
how structural diversity relates to their bioavailability and biological 
function. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the absorption and 
metabolism of the 3-monoglucosides of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin 
and malvidin in humans and to examine both the effect of consuming a red wine 
extract on plasma antioxidant status and on monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 
production in healthy human subjects. After a 12-h overnight fast, seven healthy 
volunteers received 12 g of an anthocyanin extract and provided 13 blood samples 
in the 24 h following the test meal. Furthermore, urine was collected during 
this 24-h period. Anthocyanins were detected in their intact form in both plasma 
and urine samples. Other anthocyanin metabolites could also be detected in 
plasma and urine and were identified as glucuronides of peonidin and malvidin. 
Anthocyanins and their metabolites appeared in plasma about 30 min after 
ingestion of the test meal and reached their maximum value around 1.6 h later 
for glucosides and 2.5 h for glucuronides. Total urinary excretion of red wine 
anthocyanins was 0.05+/-0.01% of the administered dose within 24 h. About 94% of 
the excreted anthocyanins was found in urine within 6 h. In spite of the low 
concentration of anthocyanins found in plasma, an increase in the antioxidant 
capacity and a decrease in MCP-1 circulating levels in plasma were observed.

Wheat bran contains several ester-linked dehydrodimers of ferulic acid, which 
were detected and quantified after sequential alkaline hydrolysis. The major 
dimers released were: 
trans-5-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-7-methoxy-2, 3- 
dihydrobenzofuran-3-carboxylic acid (5-8-BendiFA), 
(Z)-beta-[4-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-methoxyphenoxy]-4-hydroxy-3-methox ycinnamic 
acid (8-O-4-diFA) and (E,E)-4,4'-dihydroxy-5,5'-dimethoxy-3,3'-bicinnamic acid 
(5-5-diFA). trans-7-hydroxy-1-(4-hydroxy-3methoxyphenyl)-6-methoxy-1,2-dihydro - 
naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (8-8-diFA cyclic form) and 
4,4'-dihydroxy-3,3'-dimethoxy-beta,beta'-bicinnamic acid (8-8-diFA non cyclic 
form) were not detected. One of the most abundant dimers, 8-O-4-diFA, was 
purified from de-starched wheat bran after alkaline hydrolysis and preparative 
HPLC. The resultant product was identical to the chemically synthesised 
8-O-4-dimer by TLC and HPLC as confirmed by 1H-NMR and mass spectrometry. The 
absorption maxima and absorption coefficients for the synthetic compound in 
ethanol were: lambda max: 323 nm, lambda min: 258 nm, epsilon lambda max (M-1 
cm-1): 24,800 +/- 2100 and epsilon 280 (M-1 cm-1): 19,700 +/- 1100. The 
antioxidant properties of 8-O-4-diFA were assessed using: (a) inhibition of 
ascorbate/iron-induced peroxidation of phosphatidylcholine liposomes and; (b) 
scavenging of the radical cation of 2,2'-azinobis 
(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) relative to the water-soluble 
vitamin E analogue, Trolox C. The 8-O-4-diFA was a better antioxidant than 
ferulic acid in both lipid and aqueous phases. This is the first report of the 
antioxidant activity of a natural diferulate obtained from a plant.

The application of hydrostatic high pressure on an industrial line of nectarine 
(Prunus persica L.) purées was assessed in comparison with the traditional 
thermal treatment of pasteurization. Changes after thermal processing (85 °C, 5 
min) and after high-pressure processing (HPP: 450 or 600 MPa for 5 or 10 min) 
and during the refrigerated storage (60 d) of an industrially produced nectarine 
purée were evaluated. Conventional heat pasteurization as well as HPP showed 
similar microorganisms' inactivation and maintained the microbial stability of 
purées until the end of the refrigerated storage (60 d). In general, thermally 
treated purée and HP-treated purée at 600 MPa showed more intense color changes 
after processing than the other treatment. In addition, thermally treated purée 
showed more intense color changes during storage than HPP. The highest 
carotenoids extractability was found in those purées treated at the lowest 
high-pressure-treatment intensity and holding time (450 MPa/5 min), but at the 
end of the storage (day 60), no differences in individual or total carotenoid 
levels were found between the purées. HPP at 600 MPa/10 min showed the highest 
polyphenols content after the treatment and during the storage. At day 0, 
significantly higher values were found of total antioxidant activity in purée 
HP-treated at 450 MPa/10 min than in untreated purée; while at the end of the 
storage, HP-treated purée at 600 MPa/10 min had the highest antioxidant 
activity. Hydrostatic high-pressure application in the industrial line of 
nectarine purée presented some advantages compared to the thermal treatment; 
however, some of the changes found were lessen during the storage period. In 
addition, more studies need to be carried out for HP-treatment intensity 
optimization.

Anthocyanins represent the most abundant class of bioactive compounds present in 
Vaccinium myrtillus L. (bilberry) fruit, conferring it several health-promoting 
properties. The content of anthocyanins in food products produced from 
bilberries can be affected by many parameters, making the study of their 
composition a critical issue. In this ambit, this work was aimed at a 
comprehensive profiling of anthocyanins in bilberry fruit and derivatives from 
the Italian Northern Apennines, including jam, juice, and liqueur 
(""Mirtillino""). Anthocyanins were extracted from the jams by means of a dynamic 
maceration with acidified methanol, while juice and liqueurs were directly 
analyzed. The analysis of anthocyanins in the extracts was carried out by means 
of HPLC-UV/DAD, HPLC-ESI-MS, and MS2, under gradient elution. As a comparison, 
authentic bilberry fruits were analyzed. The total anthocyanin content was in 
the range 582.4-795.2 mg/100 g (FW) for the fruit, 2.3-234.5 mg/100 g for the 
jams, 109.2-2252.2 mg/L for the juice, and 27.9-759.3 mg/L for the liqueurs. To 
deeper investigate the anthocyanin profile of the liqueurs that exhibited a 
remarkably different composition in comparison with the other products, an 
authentic bilberry liqueur was prepared in the lab, following a traditional 
recipe, and monitored weakly by HPLC. The percentage of degradation of 
3-O-galactosides and 3-O-arabinosides of bilberry anthocyanidins was found to be 
higher than that of 3-O-glucosides. The results of this work demonstrated the 
importance of a suitable and reliable analysis of bilberry fruit and related 
food products to ensure their genuineness and quality. Graphical abstract

Propolis has various biological activities such as antibacterial, antiviral, 
antioxidant, immunostimulating and antiinflammatory, which are generally 
ascribed to the polyphenolic fraction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
absorption of the main polyphenols [caffeic acid (CA), pinobanksin-5methyl ether 
(P-5ME), pinobanksin (Pb), chrysin (C), pinocembrin (P), galangin (G), 
pinobanksin-3-acetate, pinobanksin esters and caffeic acid phenylethyl ester 
(CAPE)] from a dewaxed and standardized extract of propolis (EPID). Fifteen 
healthy volunteers consumed 5 mL EPID in water, corresponding to 125 mg of 
flavonoids. Blood samples were collected before, each hour for 8 h and 24 h 
after EPID intake. After deconjugation by beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase the 
plasma samples were analyzed by a selective liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method using morin as internal standard (I.S.). A 
kinetic profile characterized by two t(max), respectively at 1 h and about 5 h 
post-ingestion, was observed in all the subjects. The two peaks may be due to 
enterohepatic cycling. Among the various polyphenols ingested, only P-5ME, Pb, 
C, P and G were detected in plasma and C(max)t(1h) were 65.7 +/- 13.3, 46.5 +/- 
12.7, 79.5 +/- 18.6, 168.1 +/- 16.3 and 113.7 +/- 16.8 ng/mL, respectively. 
These levels decreased significantly after 8 h and were no longer detectable 24 
h after EPID intake. The recovery of the extraction for CA, Pb, C, P, G and I.S. 
from spiked plasma was 95.2 +/- 3.1, 93.1 +/- 3.6, 91 +/- 2.5, 96.4 +/- 4.2, 
93.4 +/- 2.4 and 85.5 +/- 2.4%, respectively. The results of this study evidence 
that flavonoids from EPID are absorbed, metabolized and Pb-5ME and G seem to 
have apparent absorption, measured as (AUC/dose), higher than C, P and Pb.

We have determined the absorption, conjugation and excretion of 
naringenin-7-O-rutinoside (narirutin) compared to the corresponding glucoside in 
an orange juice matrix in human subjects. Healthy volunteers (eight men and 
eight women), in a double blind, randomised, crossover study, consumed orange 
juice with (1) natural content of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside; (2) 
alpha-rhamnosidase-treated to yield naringenin-7-O-glucoside. Blood was sampled 
at twelve time points and three fractions of urine were collected over 24 h. The 
area under the plasma-time curve of naringenin from (2) 
alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice was increased about 4-fold (P < 0.0001), 
peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 5.4-fold higher (P < 0.0001) and Tmax was 
decreased from 311 to 92 min (P = 0.002) compared to untreated orange juice (1), 
indicating a change in absorption site from the colon to the small intestine. 
Furthermore, the amount in urine was increased from 7 to 47 % (P < 0.0001) of 
the dose after consumption of the alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice (2). 
All urine samples contained both naringenin-7- and -4'-O-glucuronides. In 
addition, to examine the effect of dose and alpha-rhamnosidase treatment on 
hesperetin conjugate profiles, a further treatment where (3) orange juice 
fortified with three times the original content of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside was 
used. Five hesperetin metabolites (3'-O-glucuronide; 7-O-glucuronide; 
5,7-O-diglucuronide; 3',7-O-diglucuronide; 3'-O-sulphate) were present after all 
treatments (1-3), with the same profile of the conjugates. The present data show 
that bioavailability of naringenin is increased by conversion from rutinoside to 
glucoside, but the profile of the conjugates of flavanones formed and excreted 
in urine is neither affected by the absorption site nor by a 3-fold change in 
dose.

In the extracts of fresh raw and frozen broccoli, caffeic, ferulic, sinapinic 
acids and kaempferol were identified. Boiling reduced the amounts of caffeic 
acid and kaempferol in both samples. The concentration of polyphenols was 
2.69mg/g fresh mass and 0.96mg/fresh mass in fresh raw broccoli and frozen raw 
broccoli, respectively. Boiling significantly decreased the amounts of phenolic 
compounds in fresh broccoli (1.58mg/g of fresh mass). In the case of frozen 
broccoli, boiling increased the concentration of polyphenols by 38%. Fresh 
broccoli extract neutralized free radicals by 19.87%. Boiling significantly 
reduced its antiradical activity (to 15.06%). Samples of frozen broccoli had a 
27.06% antiradical ability. Boiling did not change the antiradical activity in 
frozen broccoli case. Hydrothermal processing significantly influenced on the 
ability of the extracts to inhibit the decolorization of β-carotene emulsion. 
The extract of fresh broccoli had a higher activity when uncooked. Boiling 
seemed to increase this activity in the case of frozen broccoli samples. The 
results of the studies on the ability of broccoli extracts to inhibit linoleic 
acid autooxidation were ambiguous and depended on the method applied. No 
correlation was found between the content of phenolic compounds and the 
antioxidant activity of the extracts, regardless of the experimental variant and 
technique used.

The content of anthocyanins, flavonols, and carbohydrates of Tropea red onions 
(Allium cepa L.) was determined by HPLC and HPLC-MS. Cyanidin derivatives 
constitute >50% of total anthocyanins, but delphinidin and petunidin 
derivatives, which have not been reported in red onions thus far, were also 
detected. The flavonoid distribution in the different layers of the bulbs 
indicates that, after homelike peeling, the edible portion contains 79% of the 
total content of quercetin 4'-glucoside but only 27% of the anthocyanins. 
Storage of onions for 6 weeks in different conditions, all of them mimicking 
home storage habits, resulted in a decrease to 64-73% of total anthocyanins. The 
same trend was verified for the total antioxidant activity, which was reduced to 
29-36%. A decrease in glucose and fructose content correlated with anthocyanin 
degradation was also observed. Storage at low temperature seems to better 
preserve the onion anthocyanins.

Using liquid/liquid extraction, three fractions were obtained from an Italian 
red wine containing single polyphenolic subfractions: (1) phenolic acids and 
quercetin-3-glucuronide, (2) catechins and quercetin-3-glucoside, and (3) 
anthocyanins. Beside the scavenging capacity of the different fractions against 
hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals, the in vitro inhibition of low density 
lipoprotein oxidation and platelet aggregation (two main events in the 
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis) were tested. The antioxidant activity of the 
fractions has been compared with that of the original red wine before and after 
dealcoholization. The anthocyanin fraction was the most effective both in 
scavenging reactive oxygen species and in inhibiting lipoprotein oxidation and 
platelet aggregation. This higher activity can be explained by both its high 
concentration in red wine and its antioxidant efficiency, which, at least for 
peroxyl radical scavenging, was three times as high as that of the other two 
fractions. Our results suggest that anthocyanins could be the key component in 
red wine in light of the protection against cardiovascular diseases, although 
this hypothesis needs in vivo evidence.

BACKGROUND: Aqueous extracts of most medicinal plants traditionally employed in 
Portugal (at the ratio of 1 g plant: 110 mL water) have been assayed for total 
antioxidant capacity and phenol content, in order to elucidate their claimed 
medicinal features.
RESULTS: The antioxidant activity was assessed by the ABTS(•+) method; the 
ascorbic acid equivalent values ranged from 1.4280 ± 0.1261 g L(-1) for avocado 
(Persea americana (Lauraceae)) obtained by infusion of powder, down to 0.0027 ± 
0.0012 g L(-1) for olive (Olea europaea (Oleaceae)) obtained by infusion of 
leaves. Total phenol content was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure; 
the gallic acid equivalent values ranged from 0.5541 ± 0.0289 g L(-1) for 
avocado obtained by infusion of powder, down to 0.0053 ± 0.0014 g L(-1) for 
olive obtained by boiling leaves. A good correlation between total antioxidant 
capacity and total phenol content was found.
CONCLUSION: The method of powder infusion should be chosen if high concentration 
of antioxidants are sought. On the other hand, a high antioxidant capacity and a 
high phenol content correlate well with the empirically established (and widely 
publicised) capacity to treat respiratory infections. Copyright © 2007 Society

The effect of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) and cooking on the flavonoids 
and vitamin C content (ascorbic + dehydroascorbic acid; AA + DHAA) of fresh-cut 
spinach was evaluated. The total flavonoid content (approximately 1000 mg 
kg(-)(1) f.w.) remained quite constant during storage in both air and MAP 
atmospheres, while vitamin C (750 mg kg(-)(1)f.w.) was better preserved in 
MAP-stored spinach. AA was transformed to DHAA during storage, and its 
concentration was higher in MAP-stored tissues. The free-radical scavenging 
activity of the isolated flavonoids was tested, and only those flavonoids with 
either a dihydroxyl grouping or acylated with ferulic acid showed significant 
activity. A decrease in the total antioxidant activity was observed during 
storage, particularly important in MAP-stored spinach. The higher content of 
DHAA and lower content of both AA and antioxidant flavonoids in the MAP-stored 
samples could explain this antioxidant activity decrease. Boiling extracted 50% 
of total flavonoids and 60% vitamin C in the cooking water. However, flavonoid 
glucuronides were extracted more in the cooking water than the other glycosides. 
The vitamin C content of the cooked tissue was higher in those samples stored in 
MAP.

The antioxidant activity of pomegranate juices was evaluated by four different 
methods (ABTS, DPPH, DMPD, and FRAP) and compared to those of red wine and a 
green tea infusion. Commercial pomegranate juices showed an antioxidant activity 
(18-20 TEAC) three times higher than those of red wine and green tea (6-8 TEAC). 
The activity was higher in commercial juices extracted from whole pomegranates 
than in experimental juices obtained from the arils only (12-14 TEAC). HPLC-DAD 
and HPLC-MS analyses of the juices revealed that commercial juices contained the 
pomegranate tannin punicalagin (1500-1900 mg/L) while only traces of this 
compound were detected in the experimental juice obtained from arils in the 
laboratory. This shows that pomegranate industrial processing extracts some of 
the hydrolyzable tannins present in the fruit rind. This could account for the 
higher antioxidant activity of commercial juices compared to the experimental 
ones. In addition, anthocyanins, ellagic acid derivatives, and hydrolyzable 
tannins were detected and quantified in the pomegranate juices.

Hand-squeezed navel orange juice contains 839 mg/L phenolics, including 
flavanones, flavones, and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. The flavanones are 
the main phenolics in the soluble fraction (648.6 mg/L) and are also present in 
the cloud fraction (104.8 mg/L). During refrigerated storage of fresh juice (4 
degrees C), 50% of the soluble flavanones precipitate and integrate into the 
cloud fraction. Commercial orange juices contain only 81-200 mg/L soluble 
flavanones (15-33%) and the content in the cloud is higher (206-644 mg/L) 
(62-85%), showing that during industrial processing and storage the soluble 
flavanones precipitate and are included in the cloud. An in vitro simulation of 
orange juice digestion shows that a serving of fresh orange juice (240 mL) 
provides 9.7 mg of soluble hesperidin 
(4'-methoxy-3',5,7-trihydroxyflavanone-7-rutinoside) and 4.7 mg of the 
C-glycosylflavone vicenin 2 (apigenin, 6,8-di-C-glucoside) for freshly squeezed 
orange juice, whereas pasteurized commercial juices provide 3.7 mg of soluble 
hesperidin and a higher amount of vicenin 2 (6.3 mg). This means that although 
orange juice is a very rich source of flavanones, only a limited quantity is 
soluble, and this might affect availability for absorption (11-36% of the 
soluble flavanones, depending on the juice). The flavanones precipitated in the 
cloud are not available for absorption and are partly transformed to the 
corresponding chalcones during the pancreatin-bile digestion.

Orange juice manufactured at industrial scale was subjected to digestion under 
in vitro gastrointestinal conditions (pH, temperature, and enzyme and chemical 
conditions) to evaluate the influence of individual industrial processing 
treatments on flavanone solubility, stability, and ability to permeate through a 
membrane under simulated physiological conditions. Four industrial processes 
including squeezing, standard pasteurization, concentration, and freezing were 
evaluated. Hand squeezing was compared with industrial squeezing. After in vitro 
gastrointestinal digestion of the orange juices, the flavanones able to permeate 
through a dialysis membrane, and those remaining in the retentate were evaluated 
by HPLC as were those present in the insoluble fraction. In all of the assayed 
orange juices, a high content of precipitated chalcones ( approximately 70% of 
the total flavanones) was formed under the physiological conditions of the 
gastrointestinal tract. Hand squeezing provided a higher concentration of 
flavanones in the permeated fraction and lower transformation to chalcones than 
industrial squeezing. Standard pasteurization did not influence the solubility 
and permeability of the orange juice flavanones and chalcones. Industrial 
concentration did not affect the amount of flavanones able to permeate but 
decreased the chalcones produced. Juices produced from frozen orange juice 
contained considerably smaller amounts of both soluble flavanones and insoluble 
chalcones.

The concentrations of 11 phenols and 5 furans were measured in 12 categories of 
distilled spirits by HPLC methodology, together with the total antioxidant 
status (TAS) of the same beverages. Ellagic acid was the phenol present in 
highest concentration in all beverages. Moderate amounts of syringaldehyde, 
syringic acid, and gallic acid, as well as lesser amounts of vanillin and 
vanillic acid, were measurable in most samples of whiskey, brandy, and rum but 
were largely undetectable in gin, vodka, liqueurs, and miscellaneous spirits. 
5-(Hydroxymethyl)furfural was the predominant furan in the former three 
beverages, notably cognac, with 2-furaldehyde the next highest, but these were 
undetectable in most of the latter beverages. Highest TAS values were given by 
armagnac, cognac, and bourbon whiskey, all three of which tended toward the 
highest concentrations of phenols. Negative TAS values were exhibited by rum, 
vodka, gin, and miscellaneous spirits in line with the low or undetectable 
phenol concentrations in these beverages. Wood aging is the most likely source 
of phenols and furans in distilled spirits. Those beverages exposed to this 
treatment contain significant antioxidant activity, which is between the ranges 
for white and red wines, with the potential to augment the antiatherosclerotic 
functions attributable to the ethanol that they contain.

Over the last decades, the phenolic compounds from virgin olive oil (VOO) have 
become the subject of intensive research because of their biological activities 
and their influence on some of the most relevant attributes of this interesting 
matrix. Developing metabolic profiling approaches to determine them in 
monovarietal virgin olive oils could help to gain a deeper insight into olive 
oil phenolic compounds composition as well as to promote their use for botanical 
origin tracing purposes. To this end, two approaches were comparatively 
investigated (LC-ESI-TOF MS and GC-APCI-TOF MS) to evaluate their capacity to 
properly classify 25 olive oil samples belonging to five different varieties 
(Arbequina, Cornicabra, Hojiblanca, Frantoio and Picual), using the entire 
chromatographic phenolic profiles combined to chemometrics (principal component 
analysis (PCA) and partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)). The 
application of PCA to LC-MS and GC-MS data showed the natural clustering of the 
samples, seeing that 2 varieties were dominating the models (Arbequina and 
Frantoio), suppressing any possible discrimination among the other cultivars. 
Afterwards, PLS-DA was used to build four different efficient predictive models 
for varietal classification of the samples under study. The varietal markers 
pointed out by each platform were compared. In general, with the exception of 
one GC-MS model, all exhibited proper quality parameters. The models constructed 
by using the LC-MS data demonstrated superior classification ability.

In this work, an Italian extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) sample and the same 
sample added with a carotenoid-rich nutraceutical extract from Lycium barbarum 
L. (EVOOCar) were subjected to a frying process to comparatively assess chemical 
and physical changes and heat stability. Oxidation progress was monitored by 
measuring oil quality changes such as peroxide value, free acidity, K232, K268, 
and fatty acid composition as well as minor compound content, phenols, 
α-tocopherol, and carotenoids. An UHPLC/QTOF-MS metabolomics approach 
discriminated the two oil samples based on their chemical changes during frying, 
identifying also the phenolic classes most exposed to statistically significant 
variations. Partial least square discriminant analysis and volcano analysis were 
applied together to identify the most significant markers allowing group 
separation. The decrease in total phenolic content was lower in EVOOCar than in 
EVOO during frying. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids showed a 
significant percentage loss, 3.7% and 17.2%, respectively, in EVOO after 180min 
frying at 180°C, while they remained constant or slightly changed in EVOOCar. 
Zeaxanthin added to the oil rapidly decreased during the frying process. These 
findings showed that the addition of a carotenoid extract from L. barbarum can 
help to improve the oxidative stability of extra-virgin olive oil.

This study investigated the effect of both the degree of ripening of the olive 
fruit and irrigation management-rain-fed, two different regulated deficit 
irrigations (RDI), the method proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations (known as FAO), and 125 FAO (125% FAO)-on the phenolic and 
volatile composition of Cornicabra virgin olive oils obtained during two crop 
seasons. Secoiridoid phenolic derivatives greatly decreased upon increase of 
both irrigation and ripening, for example, the 3,4-DHPEA-EDA content decreased 
from 770 to 450 mg/kg through fruit ripening under rain-fed conditions and from 
676 to 388 mg/kg from rain-fed conditions to FAO irrigation treatment (at a 
ripeness index of approximately 4). Moreover, secoiridoid derivatives of 
hydroxytyrosol decreased more than those of tyrosol. The levels of major 
volatile components decreased in the course of ripening but were higher in 
irrigated olive oils: for example, the E-2-hexenal content ranged between 4.2 
and 2.6 mg/kg (expressed as 4-methyl-2-pentanol) over fruit maturation under 
rain-fed conditions and between 8.0 and 3.5 mg/kg under FAO scheduling. It is 
important to note that where water was applied only from the beginning of August 
(RDI-2), when oil begins to accumulate in the fruit, the resulting virgin olive 
oil presented a phenol and volatile profile similar to those of the FAO and 125 
FAO methods, but with a considerable reduction in the amount of water supplied 
to the olive orchard.

The phenolic compounds hydroxycinnamates, anthocyanins, flavonols, and 
flavan-3-ols of sweet cherry cultivars Burlat, Saco, Summit, and Van harvested 
in 2001 and 2002 were quantified by HPLC-DAD. Phenolics were analyzed at 
partially ripe and ripe stages and during storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C (room 
temperature) and 1-2 degrees C (cool temperature). Neochlorogenic and 
p-coumaroylquinic acids were the main hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, but 
chlorogenic acid was also identified in all cultivars. The 3-glucoside and 
3-rutinoside of cyanidin were the major anthocyanins. Peonidin and pelargonidin 
3-rutinosides were the minor anthocyanins, and peonidin 3-glucoside was also 
present in cvs. Burlat and Van. Epicatechin was the main monomeric flavan-3-ol 
with catechin present in smaller amounts in all cultivars. The flavonol rutin 
was also detected. Cultivar Saco contained the highest amounts of phenolics [227 
mg/100 g of fresh weight (fw)] and cv. Van the lowest (124 mg/100 g of fw). 
Phenolic acid contents generally decreased with storage at 1-2 degrees C and 
increased with storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C. Anthocyanin levels increased at 
both storage temperatures. In cv. Van the anthocyanins increased up to 5-fold 
during storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C (from 47 to 230 mg/100 g of fw). Flavonol 
and flavan-3-ol contents remained quite constant. For all cultivars the levels 
of phenolic acids were higher in 2001 and the anthocyanin levels were higher in 
2002, which suggest a significant influence of climatic conditions on these 
compounds.

Chlorogenic acid, the ester of caffeic acid with quinic acid, is one of the most 
abundant polyphenols in the human diet with coffee, fruits and vegetables as its 
major sources. Its antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties have been well 
established in animal studies. However, little is known about its gut absorption 
and metabolism. In the present work, four groups of rats (n = 8) were fed a diet 
supplemented with chlorogenic, caffeic or quinic acids (250 micromol/d) or an 
unsupplemented diet for 8 d. Parent compounds and their metabolites were 
estimated in urine (24-h collection) and plasma by HPLC-electrospray 
ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Significant differences in their levels 
were observed among the groups. The recovery of chlorogenic acid in urine was 
low (0.8%, mol/mol), and the total urinary excretion of caffeic acid liberated 
by hydrolysis of chlorogenic acid and its tissular methylated metabolites 
(ferulic and isoferulic acids) did not account for >0.5% (mol/mol) of the dose 
ingested. On the other hand, the metabolites of microbial origin, namely, 
m-coumaric acid and derivatives of phenylpropionic, benzoic and hippuric acids, 
represented the major compounds in both urine and plasma. Hippuric acid largely 
originated from the transformation of the quinic acid moiety, and all other 
metabolites from the caffeic acid moiety. These microbial metabolites accounted 
for 57.4% (mol/mol) of the chlorogenic acid intake. Such a high abundance of 
microbial metabolites shows that the bioavailability of chlorogenic acid depends 
largely on its metabolism by the gut microflora. Their potential importance in 
explaining the biological effects of dietary polyphenols is emphasized.

Apples are known to exhibit various beneficial effects on human health. In the 
present study, we investigated the effect of continuous intake of apple juice 
(AJ) on constipation status. A single dose of loperamide in rats as the 
constipation model markedly decreased the weight and number of fecal pellets 
compared to saline-administered rats as a control. After the administration of 
AJ twice a day for seven days, recovery of defecation close to that of the 
control was observed in loperamide-treated rats. In addition, the total bile 
acid content in the feces increased from day 4 after the administration of AJ. 
Among hepatic and intestinal transporters and enzymes that regulate bile acids, 
the mRNA expression of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (Asbt, 
slc10a2) was decreased by AJ in rats. Furthermore, the Asbt-mediated bile acid 
transport activity in the rat ileum decreased after AJ administration. Moreover, 
in human colonic cancer-derived Caco-2 cells, AJ exposure for 24 and 48 h 
decreased the expressions of ASBT mRNA and protein, and the uptake activity of 
taurocholic acid in both 7- and 21-d cultures. Several components of AJ, such as 
procyanidins, decreased the expression of ASBT in Caco-2 cells. In conclusion, 
ASBT downregulation is a possible mechanism responsible for the 
constipation-relieving effect of apples, and procyanidins may play a role in 
downregulating ASBT, which leads to the beneficial effects of apples against 
constipation. Although it is generally agreed that the common dietary 
compositions play a role in constipation relief, the novel specific mechanism of 
apples found in this study would facilitate understanding food functions.

The fate of anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and ellagitannins was studied following 
the consumption of 300 g of raspberries by healthy human volunteers and subjects 
with an ileostomy. Postingestion plasma and urine from the former and ileal 
fluid and urine from the latter group were collected and analyzed by 
HPLC-PDA-MS(2). Plasma from the healthy volunteers did not contain detectable 
quantities of either the native raspberry polyphenolics or their metabolites. 
The three main raspberry anthocyanins were excreted in urine in both healthy and 
ileostomy volunteers 0-7 h after ingestion, in quantities corresponding to <0.1% 
of intake. This indicates a low level of absorption in the small intestine. With 
ileostomy volunteers 40% of anthocyanins and 23% of the ellagitannin sanguiin 
H-6 were recovered in ileal fluid with the main excretion period being the first 
4 h after raspberry consumption. The recovery of ellagic acid in ileal fluid was 
241%, indicating hydrolysis of ellagitannins in the stomach and/or the small 
intestine. Urinary excretion of ellagic acid and an ellagic acid-O-glucuronide 
was <1% of intake. No intact or conjugated forms of ellagitannins were detected 
in urine from either healthy subjects or ileostomy volunteers. However, in 
healthy subjects, but not the ileostomists, ellagitannins were catabolized with 
the appearance of urolithin A-O-glucuronide, two of its isomers, and urolithin 
B-O-glucuronide in urine collected 7-48 h after raspberry consumption. There was 
marked variation in the urolithin profile of individual volunteers, indicating 
differences in the colonic microflora responsible for ellagitannin degradation.

Recent studies have shown that dietary fiber and polyphenols of vegetables and 
fruits improve lipid metabolism and prevent the oxidation of low density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which hinder the development of 
atherosclerosis. The goal of this study was to measure the total polyphenol and 
dietary fiber contents of some tropical fruits (i.e., pineapple, wax apple, 
rambutan, lichi, guava, and mango) and compare the results to the content of 
these substances in the better characterized persimmon. It was found that lichi, 
guava, and ripe mango (cv. Keaw) have 3.35, 4.95, and 6.25 mg of total 
polyphenols in 100 g fresh fruit, respectively. This is significantly higher 
than in persimmon, pineapple, wax apple, mature green mango, and rambutan [P < 
0.0005 for pineapple (Smooth Cayene variant), wax apple, persimmon, rambutan, 
mature green mango (cv. Keaw); the value of P < 0.001 is found only for 
pineapple (Phuket, Queen variant)]. The same relationship was observed for the 
contents of gallic acid and of dietary fiber. It can be supposed that among the 
studied fruit, lichi, guava, and ripe mango may be preferable for dietary 
prevention of atherosclerosis.

Dietary fibers, major phenolics, main minerals, and trace elements in persimmons 
and apples were analyzed and compared in order to choose a preferable fruit for 
an antiatherosclerotic diet. Fluorometry and atomic absorption spectrometry 
following microwave digestion were optimized for the determination of major 
phenolics and minerals. Total, soluble, and insoluble dietary fibers, total 
phenols, epicatechin, gallic and p-coumaric acids, and concentrations of Na, K, 
Mg, Ca, Fe, and Mn in whole persimmons, their pulps, and peels were 
significantly higher than in whole apples, pulps, and peels (P < 0.01-0.0025). 
Conversely, the contents of Cu and Zn were higher in apples than in persimmons. 
In persimmons and apples all of the above components were higher in their peels 
than in whole fruits and pulps. The relatively high contents of dietary fibers, 
total and major phenolics, main minerals, and trace elements make persimmon 
preferable for an antiatherosclerotic diet.

Polish garlic and white and red onions were subjected to blanching, boiling, 
frying, and microwaving for different periods of time, and then their bioactive 
compounds (polyphenols, flavonoids, flavanols, anthocyanins, tannins, and 
ascorbic acid) and antioxidant activities were determined. It was found that 
blanching and frying and then microwaving of garlic and onions did not decrease 
significantly the amounts of their bioactive compounds and the level of 
antioxidant activities ( P > 0.05). The HPLC profiles of free and soluble ester- 
and glycoside-bound phenolic acids showed that trans-hydroxycinnamic acids 
(caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic) were as much as twice higher in 
garlic than in onions. Quercetin quantity was the highest in red onion among the 
studied vegetables. The electrophoretic separation of nonreduced garlic and 
onion proteins after boiling demonstrated their degradation in the range from 50 
to 112 kDa.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the present work was to evaluate the phytochemical 
profile and the antioxidant activity of strawberry fruit (cv. Camarosa) upon 
postharvest ripening at room temperature (20 °C) and to correlate them with 
qualitative attributes.
RESULTS: 'Camarosa' fruit retained an appreciable postharvest performance for up 
to 1 day shelf life; thereafter substantial quality deterioration was observed. 
An increased phenolic content, mainly attributed to hydroxycinnamic acids, 
flavonols and anthocyanins, was monitored after 3 days maintenance at 20 °C. The 
chromatographic fingerprint of athocyanins showed that pelargonidin-3-glucoside 
was the major anthocyanin, which increased with the increase of shelf life 
period, while cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside were found at 
lower concentrations. The potent radical scavenging activity, evaluated with 
four in vitro assays, showed a higher antioxidant capacity after 3 and 1 days of 
shelf life. In addition, the antioxidant effect of strawberry fruit extracts on 
lipid substrates and on an emulsion system showed a significant inhibition in 
the formation of conjugated diene hyperoxides. Interestingly, no direct 
correlation between the phytochemical profile and the quality attributes exist.
CONCLUSION: 'Camarosa' fruit had acceptable quality attributes for fresh 
consumption and at the same time a high phytochemical content up to 1 day shelf 
life. The over-ripe fruit continued to be an excellent reservoir of natural 
antioxidants, pointing to its potential use as food antioxidant and nutritional 
supplement.

Quercetin-4'-glucoside is a major flavonol in onions, and this study 
investigated the absorption and fate of radiolabeled quercetin-4'-glucoside in 
rats. Rats ingested [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside and the distribution of 
radioactivity throughout the body was determined after 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 h. The 
gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, and plasma were extracted, and 
radiolabeled components were identified and quantified using high-performance 
liquid chromatography with on-line radioactivity detection and tandem mass 
spectrometry. Two hours after dosing, all the [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside 
had been metabolized. More than 85% of the ingested radioactivity was present in 
the gastrointestinal tract at all time points with approximately 6% being 
absorbed and present in blood and internal organs, primarily the liver and 
kidneys. More than 95% of the absorbed radioactivity was in the form of >20 
different methylated glucuronated and/or sulfated quercetin conjugates. Five 
hours after ingestion, the main radiolabeled metabolites were quercetin 
diglucuronides in the gut, liver, and kidneys and glucuronyl sulfates of 
methylated quercetin in plasma. The main site of quercetin metabolism seemed to 
be the gastrointestinal tract. Quercetin metabolites may have a major influence 
on the gut mucosal epithelium and on colonic disease.

BACKGROUND: Owing to the distinctive advantages of mesenchymal stem cell-derived 
exosomes (MSCs-exo), these vesicles have emerged as a pivotal research focus in 
regenerative medicine, surpassing their MSC counterparts. Quercetin (Qr), widely 
recognized for its potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, 
demonstrates substantial potential in enhancing tissue repair processes. This 
study delves into the role of quercetin-pretreated MSC-derived exosomes 
(MSCsQr-exo) in accelerating the healing of diabetic wounds.
METHODS: MSCsQr-exo were isolated from quercetin-pretreated MSCs and applied to 
fibroblasts to evaluate changes in cell function. An in vitro DSW rat model was 
also developed, and the rats were treated with MSCsQr-exo to assess wound 
healing progression. Fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA sequencing and 
untargeted metabolomics to analyze changes in gut microbiota and metabolic 
profiles.
RESULTS: MSCsQr-exo significantly enhanced fibroblast proliferation and 
migration while improving the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs-exo in DSW treatment. 
Gut microbiota and metabolomic analyses revealed marked changes in DSW rats, 
with MSCsQr-exo effectively alleviating dysbiosis. MSCsQr-exo upregulated 
Faecalibacterium abundance and regulated arachidonic acid metabolism in both the 
arachidonic and linoleic acid pathways. Firmicutes and Enterobacteriaceae 
influenced the arachidonic acid pathway by modulating 14.15-EET expression 
levels.
CONCLUSION: MSCsQr-exo facilitate DSW wound healing through modulation of 
dysbiotic gut microbiota linked to DSW pathology. This discovery offers novel 
therapeutic avenues and research trajectories for enhancing DSW recovery.

The flavonoid quercetin, or its metabolites, inhibit chemical carcinogenesis in 
rodents and may have a role in the prevention of human cancers. Quercetin 
exposure in human populations results from the dietary intake of various plant 
foods; high concentrations of quercetin are found in apples, onions, tea, and 
red wine. Determination of the relationship between dietary intake and cancer 
risk depends on the characterization of quercetin intake. The development and 
use of biomarkers for quercetin intake may provide a basis for the objective 
classification of this exposure. One possible biomarker is metabolic products of 
quercetin. We report the development of a high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC)-based assay for quantitation of quercetin metabolites in human urine. The 
metabolites include 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (homoprotocatechuic acid), 
metahydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid 
(homovanillic acid). The assay has only two major steps, ether extraction and 
HPLC analysis, and is suitable for analysis of large sample numbers. Analytical 
characteristics of the assay include a sensitivity of less than 1 microgram, 
precision with coefficients of variation < 10%, and metabolite recoveries > 90%. 
The mean concentrations of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 
metahydroxyphenylacetic acid, and homovanillic acid in two human urine samples 
are approximately 0.7, 4.8, and 2.8 micrograms/ml, respectively. The 
identification of each metabolite is confirmed by HPLC, UV absorbance scans, and 
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. These results verify the 
occurrence of quercetin metabolites in human urine and the feasibility of 
quercetin metabolite quantitation, by the assay described herein, for 
epidemiological studies. Development of the analytical procedure is an essential 
first step for validation of the metabolites as biomarkers of quercetin intake.

A method was developed for the simultaneous detection of eight polyphenols 
(t-resveratrol, (+)-catechin, quercetin and p-coumaric, caffeic, sinapic, 
ferulic, and gallic acids) by CZE with electrochemical detection. Separation of 
these polyphenols was achieved within 25 min using a 200 mM borate buffer (pH 
9.4) containing 10% methanol as separation electrolyte. Amperometric detection 
of polyphenols was carried out with a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified 
with a multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNT) layer obtained from a dispersion of 
CNT in polyethylenimine. The excellent electrochemical properties of this 
modified electrode allowed the detection and quantification of the selected 
polyphenols in white wines without any pretreatment step, showing remarkable 
signal stability despite the presence of potential fouling substances in wine. 
The electrophoretic profiles of white wines, obtained using this methodology, 
have proven to be useful for the classification of these wines by means of 
chemometric multivariate techniques. Principal component analysis and 
discriminant analysis allowed accurate classification of wine samples on the 
basis of their grape varietal (verdejo and airén) using the information 
contained in selected zones of the electropherogram. The utility of the proposed 
CZE methodology based on the electrochemical response of CNT-modified electrodes 
appears to be promising in the field of wine industry and it is expected to be 
successfully extended to classification of a wider range of wines made of other

Proanthocyanidins (PAs) have been shown to have potential health benefits. 
However, no data exist concerning their dietary intake. Therefore, PAs in common 
and infant foods from the U.S. were analyzed. On the bases of our data and those 
from the USDA's Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII) of 
1994-1996, the mean daily intake of PAs in the U.S. population (>2 y old) was 
estimated to be 57.7 mg/person. Monomers, dimers, trimers, and those above 
trimers contribute 7.1, 11.2, 7.8, and 73.9% of total PAs, respectively. The 
major sources of PAs in the American diet are apples (32.0%), followed by 
chocolate (17.9%) and grapes (17.8%). The 2- to 5-y-old age group (68.2 
mg/person) and men >60 y old (70.8 mg/person) consume more PAs daily than other 
groups because they consume more fruit. The daily intake of PAs for 4- to 
6-mo-old and 6- to 10-mo-old infants was estimated to be 1.3 mg and 26.9 mg, 
respectively, based on the recommendations of the American Academy of 
Pediatrics. This study supports the concept that PAs account for a major 
fraction of the total flavonoids ingested in Western diets.

In the United States, commercially available foods, including cocoa and 
chocolate, are being marketed with statements referring to the level of 
antioxidant activity and polyphenols. For cocoa-containing foods, there has been 
no comprehensive survey of the content of these and other chemistries. A survey 
of cocoa and chocolate-containing products marketed in the United States was 
conducted to determine antioxidant activity and polyphenol and procyanidin 
contents. Commercially available samples consisted of the top market share 
products in each of the following six categories: natural cocoa, unsweetened 
baking chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet baking chips, milk chocolate, and 
chocolate syrup. Composite samples were characterized using four different 
methods: oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), vitamin C equivalence 
antioxidant capacity (VCEAC), total polyphenols, and procyanidins. All composite 
lots were further characterized for percent nonfat cocoa solids (NFCS) and 
percent fat. Natural cocoas had the highest levels of antioxidant activities, 
total polyphenols, and procyanidins followed by baking chocolates, dark 
chocolates and baking chips, and finally milk chocolate and syrups. The results 
showed a strong linear correlation between NFCS and ORAC (R (2) = 0.9849), total 
polyphenols (R (2) = 0.9793), and procyanidins (R (2) = 0.946), respectively. On 
the basis of principal component analysis, 81.4% of the sample set was 
associated with NFCS, antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, and procyanidins. 
The results indicated that, regardless of the product category, NFCS were the 
primary factor contributing to the level of cocoa antioxidants in the products 
tested. Results further suggested that differences in cocoa bean blends and 
processing, with the possible exception of Dutching, are minor factors in 
determining the level of antioxidants in commercially available cocoa-containing 
products in the United States.

BACKGROUND: The extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) industry generates significant 
quantities of by-products, such as olive oil mill wastewater (OMWW), which could 
be valorized for their high bioactive compound content. The aim of this study 
was to investigate the positive impact of incorporating a polyphenol-rich 
extract from OMWW into EVOO extract, focusing on the improvement in polyphenol 
content, antioxidant properties, and effects on intestinal cell viability. 
Specifically, increasing concentrations of OMWW extract (1, 10, 20, and 50%) 
were added to the EVOO extract, and the preliminary screening based on 
antioxidant activity was assessed using a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) 
radical scavenging assay.
RESULTS: The EVOO/OMWW 50% extract exhibited the highest DPPH radical scavenging 
activity (92.23%) and demonstrated superior antioxidant properties in comparison 
with pure EVOO and OMWW extracts. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
analysis revealed enrichment of polyphenols in the selected EVOO/OMWW 50% 
extract. The antioxidant/antiradical activity of EVOO/OMWW 50% extract was 
further investigated through various assays, including 
2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric reducing 
antioxidant power (FRAP), and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) scavenging tests. 
Considerable activity was revealed, significantly superior to that of the EVOO 
extract. Furthermore, the extract did not exhibit any significant cytotoxicity 
in human intestinal cell lines (Caco-2 and HT29-MTX), indicating its safety for 
potential nutraceutical applications.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the incorporation of OMWW into EVOO 
extract can improve its antioxidant/antiradical potential significantly, 
providing a promising approach for the valorization of OMWW waste in the 
enhancement of the EVOO nutraceutical properties. © 2025 Society of Chemical

[13C]Caffeic acid and [13C]ferulic acid were synthesized and then used as 
internal standards for the determination of these acids (free and esterified) in 
oatmeal. A comparative study indicated that 84% of the ferulic acid, but only 
32% of the caffeic acid, which is more susceptible to oxidation than the former, 
could be found by a conventional analytical approach.

A validated method was developed for the simultaneous determination of the 
hydroxycinnamates caffeic acid (CA), dihydrocaffeic acid (DHCA), ferulic acid 
(FA), dihydroferulic acid (DHFA), and isoferulic acid (IFA) in human plasma as 
metabolites derived from coffee consumption. The method includes a protein 
precipitation step prior to enzymatic hydrolysis of the conjugated metabolites 
(sulfate, glucuronide, and/or ester) back to their aglycone forms. After 
liquid-liquid extraction, the reconstituted extract was analysed by 
high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to negative electrospray 
ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. Calibration curves were constructed from 
spiked human plasma samples in the range of 0-4800 nM for each of the targeted 
analytes. Two internal standards, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid (500 nM) 
and 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid (200 nM), were spiked at the beginning of the 
sample preparation and before analysis, respectively. Good performance data were 
obtained with limits of detection and quantification of the five 
hydroxycinnamates ranging between 1-15 nM and 3-50 nM, respectively. Within and 
between-days precisions were respectively calculated between 8-18% and 8-30% (at 
50 nM added initially), between 6-9% and 6-12% (at 200 nM), and between 5-9% and 
5-9% (at 500 nM). Precision calculated from different analysts ranged from 18% 
to 44% (at 50 nM), from 8% to 16% (at 200 nM), and from 4% to 8% (at 500 nM). 
Using this method, we determined plasma levels in humans and measured the 
efficiency of deconjugation using our enzymatic cocktail.

Five French cider apple varieties were compared on the basis of their detailed 
polyphenol profile in the cortex and in the juices. Among the factors studied, 
variety was the most important variability factor in fruits, whereas polyphenol 
profiles showed an overall stability from one year to another, and a limited 
decrease of polyphenol concentration was observed during the starch regression 
period of fruit maturation. In juices, procyanidins remained the preponderant 
polyphenol class with concentrations up to 2.4 g/L even in centrifuged juices. 
Compared to the fruits, the average degree of polymerization of procyanidins was 
significantly reduced in the juice. Centrifugation of the crude juice had only 
minor effects on the polyphenol composition. For one variety, highly polymerized 
procyanidins with average degrees of polymerization of 25 were shown to be 
soluble in the centrifuged juice at a concentration of close to 1.2 g/L. 
Oxygenation of the juices during processing resulted in a significant decrease 
of all classes of native polyphenols. Catechins and procyanidins were 
particularly affected by oxidation, whereas caffeoylquinic acid was partly 
preserved. The transfer of polyphenols after pressing was maximal for 
dihydrochalcones and minimal for procyanidins with extraction yield values close 
to 80 and 30%, respectively.

Blackberries are a rich source of polyphenolics, particularly anthocyanins, that 
may contribute to the reduced risk of chronic disease; however, as with most 
berries, the fresh fruit are only seasonally available. With most of the 
blackberries consumed as frozen or in thermally processed forms after long-term 
storage, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of processing and 
6 months of storage on the anthocyanins and antioxidant capacity of blackberries 
that were individually quick-frozen (IQF), canned-in-syrup, canned-in-water, 
pureed, and juiced (clarified and nonclarified). Monomeric anthocyanins, percent 
polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity by oxygen radical absorbance capacity 
(ORAC FL) and photochemiluminescence (PCL) were determined postprocessing (1 
day) and after 1, 3, and 6 months of storage. Processing resulted in increases 
in polymeric color values (up to 7%) and losses in monomeric anthocyanins (up to 
65%). For most products, processing also resulted in losses in antioxidant 
capacity (by ORAC FL and PCL). Storage at 25 degrees C of all processed products 
resulted in dramatic losses in monomeric anthocyanins with as much as 75% losses 
of anthocyanins throughout storage, which coincided with marked increases of 
percent polymeric color values of these products over 6 months of storage. There 
were no changes in ORAC FL or PCL for processed products throughout long-term 
storage. No significant changes in antioxidant capacity or anthocyanin content 
were observed in IQF fruit during long-term storage at -20 degrees C.

Changes in blackberry ellagitannin composition in response to juicing (clarified 
and nonclarified), pureeing, canning (in water or syrup), and freezing as well 
as changes in processed products during 6 months of storage were investigated. 
Canning, pureeing, and freezing had little effect on ellagitannins, but 
processing berries into nonclarified and clarified juices resulted in total 
ellagitannin losses of 70 and 82%, respectively, due to removal of 
ellagitannin-rich seeds in the presscake. Minimal changes in total ellagitannin 
content were observed during storage of thermally processed products, but 
compositional changes indicative of ellagitannin depolymerization were apparent. 
The ellagitannin content and composition of frozen berries remained stable over 
6 months of storage. Ellagitannins are well retained in canned, pureed, and 
frozen blackberries, but methods are needed to prevent losses during juice 
processing and/or exploit the ellagitannin-rich coproducts.

The steryl ferulate contents of rye and wheat grains and their milling fractions 
were analyzed using a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic 
(HPLC) method. HPLC-mass spectrometry was used for identification. In addition, 
steryl ferulates of some selected milling byproducts were determined. The total 
steryl ferulate contents of rye and wheat grains were 6.0 and 6.3 mg/100 g, 
respectively. Uneven distribution of steryl ferulates in the grains led to 
considerable differences in the milling products; their steryl ferulate contents 
ranged from trace amounts in flours with low ash content to 20 and 34 mg/100 g 
in rye and wheat brans, respectively. Campestanyl ferulate and sitostanyl 
ferulate were the main components, followed by campesteryl ferulate and 
sitosteryl ferulate, whereas sitosterol was the main component in total sterols. 
Among the other samples, a byproduct of rice milling (pearling dust) was the 
best source of steryl ferulates, its total steryl ferulate content being 119 
mg/100 g, whereas no measurable amounts of steryl ferulates were measured in oat 
bran or pearling dust of barley. The results indicated that rye and wheat and 
especially their bran fractions are comparable to corn as steryl ferulate 
sources.

The amounts of quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol aglycons in 25 edible 
berries were analyzed by an optimized RP-HPLC method with UV detection and 
identified with diode array and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry 
detection. Sixteen species of cultivated berries and nine species of wild 
berries were collected in Finland in 1997. Quercetin was found in all berries, 
the contents being highest in bog whortleberry (158 mg/kg, fresh weight), 
lingonberry (74 and 146 mg/kg), cranberry (83 and 121 mg/kg), chokeberry (89 
mg/kg), sweet rowan (85 mg/kg), rowanberry (63 mg/kg), sea buckthorn berry (62 
mg/kg), and crowberry (53 and 56 mg/kg). Amounts between 14 and 142 mg/kg of 
myricetin were detected in cranberry, black currant, crowberry, bog 
whortleberry, blueberries, and bilberry. Kaempferol was detected only in 
gooseberries (16 and 19 mg/kg) and strawberries (5 and 8 mg/kg). Total contents 
of these flavonols (100-263 mg/kg) in cranberry, bog whortleberry, lingonberry, 
black currant, and crowberry were higher than those in the commonly consumed 
fruits or vegetables, except for onion, kale, and broccoli.

Effects of domestic processing and storage on the flavonols quercetin, 
myricetin, and kaempferol in five berries were studied using an optimized 
RP-HPLC method with UV and diode array detection after an acid hydrolysis of the 
corresponding glycosides. In fresh berries, the total content of flavonols was 
highest in lingonberry (169 mg/kg) and black currant (157 mg/kg), intermediate 
in bilberry (41 mg/kg) and strawberry (17 mg/kg), and lowest in red raspberry 
(9.5 mg/kg). Cooking strawberries with sugar to make jam resulted in minor 
losses (quercetin 15%, kaempferol 18%). During cooking of bilberries with water 
and sugar to make soup, 40% of quercetin was lost. Traditional preservation of 
crushed lingonberries in their own juice caused a considerable (40%) loss of 
quercetin. Only 15% of quercetin and 30% of myricetin present in unprocessed 
berries were retained in juices made by common domestic methods (steam-extracted 
black currant juice, unpasteurized lingonberry juice). Cold-pressing was 
superior to steam-extraction in extracting flavonols from black currants. During 
9 months of storage at 20 C, quercetin content decreased markedly (40%) in 
bilberries and lingonberries, but not in black currants or red raspberries. 
Myricetin and kaempferol were more susceptible than quercetin to losses during 
storage.

We evaluated the absorbability of anthocyanins in humans and rats administered 
with a beverage prepared from an extract of the tuber of purple sweet potato 
(Ipomoea batatas Cultivar Ayamurasaki), or with an anthocyanin concentrate. Two 
major anthocyanin components, cyanidin 
3-O-(2-O-(6-O-(E)-caffeoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside)-5-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside) 
and peonidin 
3-O-(2-O-(6-O-(E)-caffeoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside)-5-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside), 
were detected in the plasma and urine of both rats and humans by HPLC or liquid 
chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The plasma concentration of 
anthocyanins in humans reached a maximum 90 minutes after ingestion, and the 
recovery of anthocyanins in the urine was estimated as 0.01-0.03%. These results 
indicate that acylated anthocyanins could be selectively absorbed after 
ingesting food.

Analytical data are reported for 20 flavonoids (as aglycones) determined for 
more than 60 fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts collected from four regions 
across the United States at two times of the year. Sample collection was 
designed and implemented by the Nutrient Data Laboratory (USDA). Analyses of 
eight flavan-3-ols (catechin, catechin gallate, epicatechin, epicatechin 
gallate, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, gallocatechin, and 
gallocatechin gallate), six anthocyanins (cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, 
pelargonidin, peonidin, and petunidin), two flavanones (hesperetin and 
naringenin), two flavones (apigenin and luteolin), and two flavonols (myricetin 
and quercetin) were performed by the Food Composition Laboratory (USDA) using a 
hydrolysis method for the anthocyanidins, flavones, and flavonols and a direct 
extraction method for the flavan-3-ols and flavanones. Experimental results 
compare favorably (few statistically significant differences) to literature 
values in the flavonoid and proanthocyanidin database previously compiled by the 
Nutrient Data Laboratory. The results of this study showed a seasonal variation 
only for blueberries. This study also showed that the variation in the flavonoid 
content of foods, as purchased by the U.S. consumer, is very large. The relative 
standard deviation, averaged for each flavonoid in each food, was 168%.

Purification of polar fractions from cacao liquor extracts gave 17 phenolics 
including four new compounds. The new compounds were characterized as a 
C-glycosidic flavan, an O-glycoside of a dimeric and two O-glycosides of 
trimeric A-linked proanthocyanidins, on the basis of spectroscopic data. 
Isolated polyphenols showed inhibitory effects on nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate-dependent lipid peroxidation in microsomes and on the 
autoxidation of linoleic acid. These effects were attributed to the 
radical-scavenging activity in the peroxidation chain reactions, based on the 
findings that the cacao polyphenols effectively scavenged the 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical.

Cassia bark or cortex cinnamomi, the dried stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia Presl. 
(Lauraceae), is a popular natural spice and a commonly used herb in traditional 
Chinese medicine. However, adulterants are frequently found in the market. In 
this study, 44 samples of Cassia bark including bark from seven related 
Cinnamomum species were collected from fields and market. Four characteristic 
components, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, and coumarin were 
determined by RP-HPLC, and a fingerprint comprised of five markers was 
established. These results showed that cassia barks contained high contents of 
cinnamaldehyde (13.01-56.93 mg/g). The highest content of cinnamaldehyde (up to 
93.83 mg/g) was found in debarked cortex, which is traditionally regarded as 
having the best quality in local herb shops. In contrast, the adulterants from 
the other Cinnamomum species, C. wilsonii Camble, C. japonicum Sieb., C. mairei 
Levl. and C. burmanii (Nees) Blume, contained low contents of cinnamaldehyde 
(<2.00 mg/g). The content of cinnamaldehyde in C. loureirii Nees was comparable 
to that in C. cassia. It is suggested that five characteristic peaks by HPLC are 
suitable for distinguishing genuine cassia bark from the adulterants and could 
be applied in the quality control of this commodity.

The antiradical activity of dry beans was evaluated in order to assess the 
validity of this test and to correlate the results with those achieved with the 
Folin-Ciocalteu method and with a rapid spectrophotometric method for the 
analysis of total flavonoids. Four landraces (12 samples) of common beans 
(Phaseolus vulgaris L.), collected in two regions of Italy (Tuscany and 
Basilicata) in three different years, were analyzed. The EC50 values ranged from 
39 to 2810 mg sample/mg 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazil radical. The phenolic 
content of each sample was expressed as gallic acid equivalents; it changed from 
1.17 to 4.40 mg/g. The flavonoid content, expressed as mg of (+)-catechin per g 
of dry seeds, ranged from 0.24 to 1.43 mg/g. The qualiquantitative composition 
of polyphenols has been also elucidated by means of high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC)-diode array detection and HPLC/MS. These investigations 
showed that rapid tests can contribute to assessing the quality of functional 
food.

Dietary supplements manufactured from red clover are widely marketed to provide 
the beneficial health effects of isoflavones without changing the original diet. 
In this study the metabolism of formononetin and biochanin A, the principal 
isoflavones of red clover, was studied in human subjects. Seven women ingested 
four red clover dietary supplements, and the metabolites of the isoflavones were 
identified in their urine samples. The structures of trimethylsilyl derivatives 
of the metabolites were established by GC-MS. New reduced metabolites of 
formononetin (dihydroformononetin and angolensin) and biochanin A 
(dihydrobiochanin A and 6'-hydroxyangolensin) were identified in urine samples 
using authentic reference compounds. Possible metabolic pathways are presented 
for the red clover isoflavones formononetin and biochanin A.

Soy isoflavones have recently gained considerable interest due to their possible 
health benefits. However, detailed studies on the metabolism of isoflavones are 
lacking. The aims of the investigation presented here were (1) to study the in 
vitro intestinal metabolism of isoflavones and their hydroxylated analogues 
3'-OH-daidzein, 6-OH-daidzein, 8-OH-daidzein, and 3'-OH-genistein and (2) to 
characterize the structures of some earlier identified urinary metabolites of 
soy isoflavones, for which no authentic reference compounds have been available. 
Isoflavone standards (1-2 mg) were fermented with human fecal flora (16.7%) for 
24 h. Metabolites formed during the fermentation were tentatively identified by 
interpretation of the mass spectra of trimethylsilylated compounds obtained by 
GC-MS. Compounds having hydroxyl groups at 5-position (i.e., genistein and 
3'-OH-genistein) were completely converted to metabolites that could not be 
detected by the methods used in this study. The metabolism of daidzein and its 
hydroxylated analogues, 3'-OH-daidzein, 6-OH-daidzein, and 8-OH-daidzein, 
occurred to a much lesser extent. Minor amounts of reduced metabolites (i.e., 
isoflavanones and alpha-methyldeoxybenzoins) of these compounds were tentatively 
identified in fermentation extracts. The retention times and the mass spectra of 
reduced isoflavone metabolites, obtained from in vitro fermentations of pure 
compounds, were utilized to identify unknown urinary metabolites of soy 
isoflavones. Four novel isoflavone metabolites were identified in human urine 
collected after soy supplementation: 3' '-OH-O-desmethylangolensin, 
3',4',7-trihydroxyisoflavanone, 4',7,8-trihydroxyisoflavanone, and 
4',6,7-trihydroxyisoflavanone.

Strawberries are known to contain antioxidants, but the significance of 
ingesting antioxidant-rich fruits remains to be established. In order to 
determine whether the consumption of strawberries impacted measures of in vivo 
antioxidant capacity, frozen strawberries (250 g) were administered daily for 3 
weeks to 21 healthy female volunteers. Compliance was confirmed by quantitating 
pelargonidin-glucuronide, urolithin A-glucuronide, and 
2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3-[(2)H]furanone-glucuronide in plasma and urine by 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and antioxidant capacity in serum 
measured by the increase in lag phase of low-density lipoprotein after copper 
sulfate exposure, DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes, and activity of phase II 
enzymes. Among these measures lipid peroxidation lag time increased by 20% (P < 
.01), whereas other measures did not change significantly. The potent 
antioxidant defenses in humans make determination of changes due to dietary 
ingestion in healthy individuals difficult. In summary, daily consumption of 
strawberries resulted in a modest but significant increase in antioxidant 
capacity in a healthy population.

We determined whether nine common herbs (basil, chili, cilantro, dill, garlic, 
ginger, lemongrass, oregano, and parsley) and one herb mixture (Italian Herbs) 
retain the antioxidant capacity (AC) and content of phenolics and characteristic 
marker compounds during processing to dry and paste forms. Oregano exhibited the 
highest AC among the herbs tested in dry and fresh forms. Compared with fresh 
herbs, the AC in dry form was decreased in garlic, chili, dill, oregano and 
parsley and paste form of oregano and basil. With the exception of dried garlic 
and lemongrass in fresh and paste form, all herbs in dry, paste, and fresh form 
contained significant AC. The AC was correlated significantly to the total 
phenolic content in both dry and fresh form. However, there was no significant 
correlation between the AC and the concentration of chemical marker compounds. 
In summary, processed herbs contribute significant amounts of AC to the diet.

Catechins, compounds that belong to the flavonoid class, are potentially 
beneficial to human health. To enable an epidemiological evaluation of 
catechins, data on their contents in foods are required. HPLC with UV and 
fluorescence detection was used to determine the levels of (+)-catechin, 
(-)-epicatechin, (+)-gallocatechin (GC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), 
(-)-epicatechin gallate (ECg), and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) in 8 
types of black tea, 18 types of red and white wines, apple juice, grape juice, 
iced tea, beer, chocolate milk, and coffee. Tea infusions contained high levels 
of catechins (102-418 mg of total catechins/L), and tea was the only beverage 
that contained GC, EGC, ECg, and EGCg in addition to (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin. Catechin concentrations were still substantial in red wine 
(27-96 mg/L), but low to negligible amounts were found in white wine, 
commercially available fruit juices, iced tea, and chocolate milk. Catechins 
were absent from beer and coffee. The data reported here provide a base for the 
epidemiological evaluation of the effect of catechins on the risk for chronic 
diseases.

The phenolic profile of strawberry fruits (Fragaria x ananassa Duch., Rosaceae) 
was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array 
detection. A peak displaying retention time and UV spectral data identical to 
those of phloridzin (phloretin 2'-O-beta-d-glucoside), a dihydrochalcone 
glucoside so far considered characteristic of apples, was monitored. For further 
characterization, crude extracts of strawberries were purified on polyamide, and 
the target compound was isolated by preparative and analytical HPLC. Structure 
elucidation was performed on the basis of APCI- and ESI-MS in the negative ion 
mode as well as by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy using authentic phloridzin for 
comparison. The d-configuration of the sugar moiety was established by HPLC 
analysis of the corresponding acyclic 
1-deoxy-1-(N-acetyl-alpha-methylbenzylamino)alditol acetate. Apart from its 
chemotaxonomic relevance, this first report on the occurrence of phloridzin in 
strawberries is of particular interest for the authenticity control of 
strawberry products such as juices, jams, and fruit preparations since 
phloridzin has so far been used for the detection of fraudulent admixtures.

The flavonoids, naringin and naringenin and the furanocoumarin, bergapten 
(5-methoxypsoralen), were detected in some fresh grapefruit and commercial 
grapefruit juices but were not detected in other fruit juices tested (orange; 
orange with apple base; dark grape; orange and mango with apple base; orange, 
peach, passion fruit juice). The contents of these three grapefruit constituents 
in commercial juice and fresh grapefruit varied from brand to brand and also 
from lot to lot. Juice was prepared from the fresh fruit via different methods 
(by hand, squeezer or blender). The naringin content, after hand-squeeze, ranged 
from 115 to 384 mg/l. With hand-squeeze juice production, bergapten was not 
detected (less than 0.5 mg/l) in two varieties of grapefruit, and naringenin was 
usually not in detectable levels (less than 2 mg/l) in three varieties. All 
three constituents were present in New Zealand grapefruit preparations 
(including juice by hand-squeeze) and different lots showed variation in content 
(1.5-, 2.3- and 4.7-fold for naringin, naringenin and bergapten, respectively). 
Differences in the concentrations of these three constituents, which have 
potential for drug interaction, may contribute to the variability in 
pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 drugs and some contradictory results of drug 
interaction studies with grapefruit juice.

Gallic acid is one of the main phenolic components of black tea. The objective 
of this study was to identify urinary gallic acid metabolites with potential for 
use as markers of black tea intake. In an initial study, nine compounds, 
assessed by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, were found to increase 
in concentration in urine after 3 cups of black tea over 3 h. A subsequent study 
employed a controlled crossover design in which 10 subjects consumed 5 cups per 
day of black tea or water for 4 weeks in random order. Twenty-four hour urine 
samples were collected at the end of each period. Of the 9 candidate compounds 
identified in the initial study, only 3 were present at higher concentrations in 
urine of all 10 subjects during tea-drinking in comparison to water-drinking 
periods. These compounds were identified as 4-O-methylgallic acid, 
3-O-methylgallic acid, and 3, 4-O-dimethylgallic acid, all methyl ether 
derivatives of gallic acid. It is suggested that these compounds have the 
potential to be used as markers of black tea intake.

Tea and coffee are rich in polyphenols with a variety of biological activities. 
Many of the demonstrated activities are consistent with favourable effects on 
the risk of chronic diseases. 4-O-methylgallic acid (4OMGA) and isoferulic acid 
are potential biomarkers of exposure to polyphenols derived from tea and coffee 
respectively. 4OMGA is derived from gallic acid in tea, and isoferulic acid is 
derived from chlorogenic acid in coffee. Our major objective was to explore the 
relationships of tea and coffee intake with 24 h urinary excretion of 4OMGA and 
isoferulic acid in human subjects. The relationships of long-term usual (111 
participants) and contemporaneously recorded current (344 participants) tea and 
coffee intake with 24 h urinary excretion of 4OMGA and isoferulic acid were 
assessed in two populations. 4OMGA was related to usual (r 0.50, P<0.001) and 
current (r 0.57, P<0.001) tea intake, and isoferulic acid was related to usual 
(r 0.26, P=0.008) and current (r 0.18, P<0.001) coffee intake. Overall, our 
present results are consistent with the proposal that 4OMGA is a good biomarker 
for black tea-derived polyphenol exposure, but isoferulic acid may be of limited 
usefulness as a biomarker for coffee-derived polyphenol exposure.

There is considerable interest in coloured fruits and berries as sources of 
biologically active anthocyanins. To examine the relationship between the oral 
dose and the amount excreted for anthocyanins from a food source across a 
physiological range of doses, volunteers were fed, in random order, four 
portions (100-400 g) of fresh strawberries as part of a standard breakfast. 
Urine was collected at 2 h intervals up to 8 h, and for the period 8-24 h. Fresh 
strawberries contained pelargonidin-3-glucoside as the major anthocyanin with 
smaller amounts of cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside. 
Anthocyanins were detected in the urine of all volunteers for all doses, 
predominantly as pelargonidin glucuronide and sulphate metabolites. There was a 
strong, linear relationship between oral dose and anthocyanin excretion 
(Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient = 0.692, p < 0.001, n = 40) 
which indicated that on an average, every additional unit of dose caused 0.0166 
units of excretion. Within individuals, dose -- excretion data fitted a linear 
regression model (median R(2) = 0.93). We conclude that strawberry anthocyanins 
are partially bioavailable in humans with a linear relationship between oral 
dose and urinary excretion for doses up to 400 g fresh fruit.

The effect of fruit maturation on changes in carotenoids, flavonoids, total 
soluble reducing equivalents, phenolic acids, ascorbic acid, and antioxidant 
activity (AOX) in different pepper types (Capsicum annuum, Capsicum frutescens, 
and Capsicum chinese) was determined. Generally, the concentration of these 
chemical constituents increased as the peppers reached maturity. Peppers 
contained high levels of L-ascorbic acid and carotenoids at maturity, 
contributing 124-338% of the RDA for vitamin C and 0.33-336 RE/100 g of 
provitamin A activity, respectively. Levels of phenolic acids, capxanthin, and 
zeaxanthin generally increased during maturation, whereas the level of lutein 
declined. Flavonoid concentrations varied greatly among the pepper types 
analyzed and were negatively correlated to AOX under the conditions of the 
beta-carotene-linoleic assay. Model systems were used to aid in understanding 
the relationship between flavonoids and AOX. Significant increases in AOX were 
observed in pepper juice models in response to increasing dilution factors and 
the presence of EDTA, indicating a pro-oxidant effect due to metal ions in the 
system. In vitro models demonstrated that increasing levels of flavonoids in 
combination with constant levels of caffeic and ascorbic acid gave a resultant 
AOX that was either additive of the two compounds or competitive in their 
ability to scavenge peroxyl radicals. The model systems were in good agreement 
with the chemical composition of the pepper cultivars and reflected the 
interactions affecting AOX. More research is needed to understand the complex 
interactions that occur among various antioxidants present in pepper extracts.

Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of 11 commercial cultivars and 
15 advanced breeding lines of spinach were determined over two growing seasons 
known to vary in biotic and abiotic stresses. Flavonoid composition and content 
of fall-grown commercial cultivars and advanced breeding lines were also 
determined. Over-winter spinach, which was planted in late fall and harvested in 
the spring, had much higher levels of total phenolics and antioxidant capacity 
than spinach planted in early fall and harvested in late fall, indicating that 
growing conditions, as well as biotic and abiotic stresses, influenced phenolic 
metabolism. Genotype also appeared to play an important role in affecting 
phenolic metabolism and antioxidant capacity in spinach. Advanced breeding lines 
of spinach, which show increased disease resistance, had higher levels of total 
phenolics, individual and total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity than 
commercial cultivars. Our results indicate that plant breeders can select for 
increased phenolic content to increase antioxidant capacity in spinach 
cultivars, or the crops can be grown in different seasons or under certain 
stress conditions to elevate levels of antioxidants.

Fresh blueberries were processed into sugar and sugar-free jams and stored for 6 
months at 4 and 25 degrees C. The jams were analyzed immediately after 
processing and over 6 months of storage for polyphenolic content, percent 
polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity. Processing resulted in losses of 
anthocyanins, procyanidins, chlorogenic acid, and ORAC in both jam types, but 
flavonols were well retained. Marked losses of anthocyanins and procyanidins 
occurred over 6 months of storage and were accompanied by increased polymeric 
color values. Chlorogenic acid levels also declined during storage, but 
flavonols and ORAC changed little. Jams stored at 4 degrees C retained higher 
levels of anthocyanins, procyanidins, and ORAC and had lower polymeric color 
values than jams stored at 25 degrees C. Sugar-free jams retained higher levels 
of anthocyanins and had lower polymeric color values than sugar jams late during 
storage. Blueberry jams should be refrigerated to better retain polyphenolics 
and antioxidant capacity.

Minor polar compounds of 88 extra virgin olive oils were analyzed by HPLC-DAD-MS 
(high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector-mass spectrometry) 
and by the Folin-Ciocalteu (FC) spectrophotometric method, to validate and 
evaluate, for olive oils, the linear association between FC and HPLC data. The 
Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between HPLC and FC results. 
The highest, positive R were related with deacetoxyoleuropein aglycone (R = 
0.93) and oleuropein aglycone (R = 0.93) as single compounds and with the sum of 
orthodiphenols (R = 0.94) and the sum of all compounds (R = 0.95), showing that 
both estimations of total phenols content are reliably correlated, regardless 
for the absolute contents and are independent of the relative composition of the 
phenolic fraction. On the other hand the HPLC quantifications of apigenin and 
lignans showed no significant correlation with FC. These results, supported also 
by principal component analysis, may suggest caution about the interpretation of 
FC results to compare olive oils with very different phenolic profiles.

INTRODUCTION: Hardtank® is a pressure-modulated, solvent-free cold extraction 
that shortens brewing while maximizing bioactive recovery from roasted coffee.
METHODS: We produced a Nitro Cold Brew beverage from roasted Yellow Bourbon 
beans using Hardtank® (550 g : 10,000 mL water, 30 min, 0.3-1.5 bar) and 
compared its composition and antioxidant activity with laboratory extracts from 
roasted and green beans obtained by hot water infusion (93 °C, 5 min) and by 
methanol extraction (70% reflux, 2 h; 100% reflux, 2 h; 70% shake, 5 min). We 
measured caffeine, chlorogenic acid (and derivatives), total phenolics, total 
flavonoids, and antioxidant activity by the ferric reducing antioxidant power 
and DPPH radical tests, expressed as Trolox equivalents.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Nitro Cold Brew contained 375.8±2.4 mg phenolics + 
flavonoids per 100 mL, 72.4±1.1 mg caffeine per 100 mL, and 78.2±2.3 mg 
chlorogenic acid per 100 mL, with ferric reducing antioxidant power 27.9±0.5 mM 
and DPPH 11.7±0.6 mM. Using 70% methanol reflux as the 100% reference, Hardtank® 
achieved 135.3% for phenolics + flavonoids, 119.7% for caffeine, and up to 
172.3% for chlorogenic acid. Overall, Hardtank® yielded a ready-to-drink coffee 
with bioactive and antioxidant profiles comparable to or better than laboratory 
reflux extracts, while operating rapidly and without organic solvents, 
indicating promise for scalable production of functional coffee beverages.

Several recent reports have been published indicating that the antioxidant 
activity of olive oil and tea leaves is not stable over product shelf lives of 
about one year. We have measured the antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, 
flavan-3-ols monomers, and procyanidin levels in milk and dark chocolate, in 
cocoa powder, and in cocoa beans. Results show that for the cocoa products 
studied, antioxidant activity, and flavan-3-ol levels are stable over typical 
shelf lives of one year under controlled storage and over 2 years in ambient 
storage in the laboratory. We also show that 80 year old cocoa powder and 116 
year old cocoa beans still show very high levels of antioxidant activity and 
flavan-3-ol content.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of consumption of fermented and unfermented 
soy products on excretion of urinary isoflavonoid phytoestrogens and lignans in 
healthy men.
DESIGN: A randomized, crossover trial consisting of two 9-day feeding periods 
following 5 days of baseline data collection.
SUBJECTS: Healthy men, aged 20 to 40 years, were recruited from the University 
of Minnesota Twin Cities community. Of the 22 subjects who began the study, 17 
completed all feeding periods.
INTERVENTIONS: Fermented soy product (112 g tempeh) or unfermented soy (125 g 
soybean pieces) was consumed during each controlled feeding period.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Urine samples collected while subjects consumed their 
habitual diets and on the last 3 days of each feeding period were analyzed for 
isoflavonoid and lignan content by isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED: Comparisons of isoflavonoid and lignan excretion 
were analyzed using the general linear model procedure. Orthogonal contrasts 
were used to determine treatment differences of interest.
RESULTS: Urinary excretion of isoflavonoids (equol, O-desmethylangolensin 
[O-DMA], daidzein, genistein) was higher and excretion of lignans (enterodiol, 
enterolactone) was lower when subjects consumed soy-supplemented diets than when 
they consumed their habitual diets (P < .05). Urinary isoflavonoid excretion and 
lignan excretion were similar when subjects consumed tempeh and soybean pieces 
diets; however, recovery of daidzein and genistein was significantly higher when 
subjects consumed the tempeh diet than when they consumed the soybean pieces 
diet (P < .002). When fed soy, 5 of 17 subjects excreted high amounts of equol. 
These five subjects tended to excrete less O-DMA and daidzein than the 12 
subjects who excreted low amounts of equol (P < .06).
CONCLUSIONS: Fermentation of soy decreased the isoflavone content of the product 
fed but increased the urinary isoflavonoid recovery. This finding suggests that 
fermentation increases availability of isoflavones in soy.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of vegetable, fruit, and legume consumption on 
urinary isoflavonoid phytoestrogen and lignan excretion.
DESIGN: After 4 days of data collection, during which subjects consumed their 
habitual diets, subjects were randomly placed on four 9-day controlled 
experimental diets with each subject receiving each diet in a random order.
SUBJECTS: Seven men and three women, aged 20 to 35 years, were recruited from 
the University of Minnesota Twin Cities community.
INTERVENTIONS: All subjects consumed four experimental diets in an assigned 
random order: a controlled basal diet, a legume/allium diet (containing garbanzo 
beans, garlic, and onions), and diets low or high in vegetables and fruits 
(containing apples, pears, potatoes, and carrots).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Urine samples that were collected while subjects consumed 
their habitual diets and during the last 3 days of each feeding period were 
analyzed for isoflavonoid and lignan content using isotope dilution gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED: The effect of vegetable and fruit intake on 
urinary isoflavonoid and lignan excretion was analyzed using the general linear 
model procedure. Post hoc comparisons were made using Duncan's multiple range 
test.
RESULTS: Subjects excreted more of the lignan enterodiol on the high 
vegetable/fruit diet compared with the basal and legume/allium diets (P = .03); 
more of the isoflavonoids O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA), genistein, and sum of 
isoflavonoids on the legume/allium diet compared with the other controlled diets 
(P < .05); and more of the isoflavan equol on the basal and legume/allium diets 
compared with the high vegetable/fruit diet (P < .01). Subjects who excreted 
higher levels of equol on the basal and legume/allium diets also consumed more 
of the milk-based pudding provided as part of the controlled diets.
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary lignan and isoflavonoid excretion changed in response to 
alterations in vegetable, fruit, and legume intake under controlled dietary 
conditions.

The study focused on the effects of processing and storage on the stability of 
flaxseed-derived secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) added to various bakery 
products. The SDG concentration of doughs, baked rye breads, graham buns, and 
muffins was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array 
detection; the baked products were analyzed immediately after baking and upon 
storage at room temperature for 1 week and at -25 degrees C for 1 and 2 months, 
respectively. Added SDG was found to withstand normal baking temperatures in all 
bakery products. SDG also was a relatively stable compound during storage. 
Similarly, the content of SDG in flax buns containing fat-free flaxseed meal was 
unaffected by storage. We conclude that cereal-based bakery products can be 
supplemented with flaxseed-derived SDG.

Peanut and its derivatives, especially peanut butter, are extensively consumed 
in many countries, mainly in the United States, which is also the major exporter 
of these products. trans-Resveratrol is present in peanuts, and recently this 
compound has been quantified in peanut butter. It is well-known that there are 
beneficial effects of trans-resveratrol and its glucoside, the piceid, in 
health. The absorption of trans-resveratrol has been proven in animals, and 
certain studies show that the absorption of some phenols is enhanced by 
conjugation with glucose, so that it could be possible that trans-piceid would 
be more absorbed than its aglycon (trans-resveratrol). In our work, we have 
identified the presence of trans-piceid in peanut butter with a new method to 
quantify trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid (3-beta-glucose of 
trans-resveratrol). This fact is very interesting because the glucosilated form 
could be more easily absorbed by the intestinal gut; in this way trans-piceid 
would exercise its beneficial function more efficiently than trans-resveratrol. 
To our knowledge, this is the first time that trans-piceid has been quantified 
in peanut butter. Resveratrol and piceid contents in natural peanut butters were 
found to be significantly higher than those in blended peanut butters.

Anthocyanins, kind of flavonoids (FL) found in plants and vegetables, are known 
to have varieties of physiological functions. In the present study, we examined 
absorption and metabolism of delphinidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside (Dp3G) in rats. 
Dp3G appeared in the plasma at 15 min after oral administration as an intact 
glucosidic form. The plasma level also showed another peak at 60 min. One 
metabolite peak was detected in the plasma and the structure was assigned as 
4'-O-methyl Dp3G (MDp3G) by NMR and MS. The metabolite was also identified in 
several tissues as a major metabolite especially in the liver. No 3'-O-methyl 
Dp3G was detected in any tissues, therefore, 4'-OH methylation is the main path 
of Dp3G metabolism in rats. This finding generalized the metabolic formation of 
FL having pyrogallol B ring because it has been reported that FL having catechol 
structure produced 3'-O-methyl-derivatives, but FL having pyrogallol structure 
produced 4'-O-methyl-derivatives.

We previously determined that five rather hydrophobic metabolites appeared in 
blood plasma after oral administration of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 
but a group of hydrophilic metabolites still remained unidentified. In the 
present study, 12 hydrophilic metabolites found were collected from urine and 
plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and then 
analyzed by tandem MS spectrometry. From the MS spectra, four metabolites out of 
12 were assigned as glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and six 
out of 12 were glucuronides of the primary metabolites of cyanidin 
3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside). 
Extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and O-methyl 
cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside showed their maximum plasma concentrations 
at 15 and 60 min (or 30 min) after oral administration, respectively. Their 
maximum plasma concentrations ranged from 15 to 70 nM. From the profile of 
urinary-excreted anthocyanins after intravenous administration, it was deduced 
that extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and O-methyl 
cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside were mainly produced in the liver rather 
than by intestinal flora. The area under the plasma concentration curve was 0.25 
micromol min/L for extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside 
and 0.14 micromol min/L for O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 
respectively, when evaluated as cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside equivalent, 
indicating that extended glucuronidation is a critical pathway in cyanidin 
3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside metabolism in rats.

To clarify how structural diversity of anthocyanins relates to their in vivo 
function, bioavailability was precisely studied in rats using bilberry 
(Vaccinium myrtillus L.) extract (Bilberon 25) as an anthocyanin source that 
contains 15 different anthocyanins. The bilberry extract was orally or 
intravenously administered to rats, and the plasma levels of each anthocyanin 
were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. As the result, all 
anthocyanins except peonidin 3-O-alpha-L-arabinoside were detectable in the 
blood plasma. The plasma concentration of anthocyanins as a whole reached the 
maximum level of 1.2 microM at 15 min after oral administration of 400 mg/kg 
bilberry extract (153.2 mg/kg as anthocyanins) and then decreased with time. 
Uptake and decay profiles of each anthocyanin in the plasma were almost the same 
for all anthocyanins except a few with their maximum after 30 min. Among the 
anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone, the plasma level after 15 min of oral 
administration was as follows: galactoside > glucoside > arabinoside. Plasma 
clearance of anthocyanins after intravenous administration clearly showed that 
arabinoside disappeared more rapidly than glucoside and galactoside. On the 
other hand, when anthocyanins carrying the same sugar moiety were compared, the 
half disappearance time of plasma anthocyanins was in the following order: 
delphinidin > cyanidin > petunidin = peonidin > malvidin. The bioavailability of 
anthocyanins was in the range of 0.61-1.82% and was 0.93% as the anthocyanin 
mixture. The bioavailability of anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone was in 
the following order: Galactoside showed the highest followed by glucoside and 
arabinoside for cyanidin and delphinidin, but arabinoside and galactoside showed 
a higher bioavailability than glucoside for petunidin and malvidin. Anthocyanins 
recovered in urine and bile during the first 4 h after intravenous 
administration were only 30.8 and 13.4%, respectively. Anthocyanin profiles in 
tissues were quite different from those in blood plasma. The major anthocyanins 
distributed in liver and kidney were the O-methyl anthocyanins such as peonidin, 
malvidin, and other O-methyl anthocyanins derived from delphinidin, cyanidin, 
and petunidin-glycosides.

Total and free phenolic contents of 16 commonly consumed fruits (comprising 9 
apples, 4 pears, and one each of peach, plum, and kiwi fruit cultivars) were 
measured by Folin-Ciocalteu assay. Total phenol contents varied from 272 to 475 
mg of CtE/100 g of fresh weight. Of the apple cultivars studied, Braeburn and 
Empire had the highest and lowest total phenol content, respectively. The apple 
cultivars ranked in the following decreasing order: Braeburn > Red Delicious > 
Crisp Pink > Granny Smith > Royal Gala > Bramley > Golden Delicious > Fuji > 
Empire. Among pear cultivars, the order was Forelle > Taylor's > Peckham's > 
Conference. Peach and plum equally had high contents. The percentage of 
conjugated phenolics ranged between 3 (Red Delicious) and 77% (Empire) of the 
total phenols. Comparison of different cultivars of the same fruit and between 
different fruits showed broad variations in both phenolic content and in vitro 
antioxidant activity; a weak correlation (R(2) = 0.58) was observed between the 
phenolic content of the fruits and the total antioxidant activity, as estimated 
by the FRAP assay. The calculated dietary intake of total, free, and conjugated 
phenols from average per capita consumption of apples and pears in different 
regions of the U.K. varied between 104-126, 53-64, and 51-62 mg of CtE/day, 
respectively.

Fresh aerial parts of different chicory varieties: green chicory (c.v. 
""Catalogna""), two red chicory varieties (""radicchio rosso di Chioggia"" and 
""radicchio rosso di Treviso""), and Witloof or Belgian endive were analyzed by 
HPLC/DAD/MS. The chromatographic fingerprint was diagnostic for each variety. A 
monocaffeoyl tartaric acid, chlorogenic acid, and chicoric acid were detected in 
all the varieties, while cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-(6'' malonyl) 
glucoside, and cyanidin 3-O-(6'' malonyl) glucoside were the main phenolic 
compounds in the red varieties. The flavonoidic compounds, quercetin 
3-O-glucuronide and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide, were absent in the Witloof sample. 
The phenolic compounds from total leaves were the same as those obtained from 
only the colored parts; nevertheless, the total amount was remarkably lower with 
a decrease of up to 80% for Belgian endive. Chemical stability at high 
temperature was observed for the phenolic fraction from the green variety after 
decoction at 100 degrees C for 30 min.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the absorption of a citrus flavonoid, 
naringin, as its glycosylated form. Six healthy volunteers (three males and 
three females) were studied. After a single oral administeration of 500 mg of 
naringin, intact naringin was isolated from 2-4 h urine. Isolated naringin was 
identified by the LC/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), MS/MS, 
and MS/MS/MS techniques. The cumulative urinary excretion of naringin and its 
metabolites (naringenin and naringenin glucuronides) was determined by HPLC for 
0-24 h. Approximately 0.02% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as 
unchanged naringin, whereas urinary recoveries of naringenin and naringenin 
glucuronides were approximately 0.4 and 3.6% of the administered dose, 
respectively. It was concluded that trace amounts of orally administered 
naringin can be absorbed as the glycoside. However, it is not clear whether the 
glycoside is cleaved before or after absorption to generate naringenin.

BACKGROUND: Several studies investigated the impact of different cooking 
techniques on the quality of vegetables. However, the use of the combined 
air-steam cooking is still scarcely debated, despite the advantages informally 
referred by professional catering workers. In this study, its optimisation was 
studied on Brussels sprouts and pumpkin cubes to obtain the best physical 
(texture, colour) and antioxidant (FRAP, total phenols) response, in comparison 
to a conventional steaming treatment.
RESULTS: Increasing the strength of the air-steam treatment, Brussels sprouts 
resulted to be softer, less green (higher a* value), richer in phenols and 
exhibited lower FRAP values than the steamed ones. The air-steamed pumpkin cubes 
exhibited an equivalent softening degree to that of steamed ones and, under the 
strongest cooking conditions, a higher antioxidant quality and a yellow 
darkening (lower b* value). Varying the cooking time and/or temperature, a 
linear change of force/compression hardness and a* (negative a*: greenness) for 
Brussels sprouts, b* (yellowness) and total phenol content for pumpkin cubes was 
observed. A predictive model for these variables was obtained by response 
surface methodology. The best process conditions to achieve the optimal 
desirability were also identified.
CONCLUSION: The application of air-steam cooking under suitable time/temperature 
conditions could be proposed as an alternative method to a traditional steam 
cooking on Brussels sprouts and pumpkin cubes, being able to preserve or improve 
their quality. The best air-steam cooking conditions were 25 min at 90 °C for 
Brussels sprouts and 10 min at 110 °C for pumpkin. © 2017 Society of Chemical

Sterol ferulate, free sterol, and 5-alk(en)ylresorcinol constituents of wheat, 
rye, and corn bran oils were studied. Among the sterol ferulates, one novel 
compound, 24-methylenecholestanol ferulate (7), along with six known compounds, 
namely, 24-methylcholestanol ferulate (1), 24-methylcholesterol ferulate (2), 
2-methyllathosterol ferulate (3), stigmastanol ferulate (4), sitosterol ferulate 
(5), and schottenol ferulate (6), were isolated and characterized. Five known 
free sterols, namely, 24-methylcholesterol (8), stigmastanol (9), sitosterol 
(10), schottenol (11), and stigmasterol (12), were isolated and identified. 
5-Alk(en)ylresorcinols were found in wheat and rye bran oils but not in corn 
bran oil. Of these, one new compound, 5-n-(2'-oxo-14'-Z-heneicosenyl) resorcinol 
(19), and seven known compounds, namely, 5-n-heptadecyl- (13), 5-n-nonadecyl- 
(14), 5-n-heneicosyl- (15), 5-n-tricosyl- (16), 5-n-pentacosyl- (17), 
5-n-(14'-Z-nonadecenyl)- (18), and 5-n-(2'-oxoheneicosyl)resorcinols (20), were 
isolated and characterized. These compounds were evaluated with respect to their 
inhibitory effects on the induction of Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) 
by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells, which is known to 
be a primary screening test for antitumor promoters. Four compounds, 1, 2, 4, 
and 11, showed potent inhibitory effects on EBV-EA induction.

Sesame exhibits many beneficial physiological effects, which are mostly related 
to its lignan compounds, such as sesaminol glucosides. This investigation 
studies the distribution and elimination of sesaminol triglucoside from sesame 
in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. In order to investigate the distribution of 
sesaminol triglucoside (p.o. 500 mg/kg) in SD rats, the changes in concentration 
of sesaminol triglucoside and its metabolites were determined in tissues and 
plasma within 24 h period after tube-feeding to SD rats. Results showed that 
sesaminol triglucoside may be deglycosylated to form sesaminol first by 
intestinal microflora and then incorporated via lymphatic absorption into the 
cardiovascular system, transported to other tissues. The concentrations of 
sesaminol triglucoside and its metabolites in rectum, caecum, colon, and small 
intestines are higher than those in liver, lung, kidney, and heart. Its 
concentration in brain is low but detectable. Glucuronidation and sulfation was 
the main metabolic pathway for sesaminol in urine, and fecal elimination was a 
major route of elimination. From LC/MS/MS analysis of rat organs, sesaminol 
triglucoside can be converted to mammalian lignans, enterodiol (END), and 
enterolactone (ENL), by rat intestinal microflora. In the plasma, concentrations 
of END and ENL were 5.9 +/- 0.2 and 5.5 +/- 0.2 micromol/mL, respectively.

Methods were developed for the analysis of natural antioxidants including 
phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beverages and plant extracts using gradient 
HPLC with multi-channel electrochemical coulometric detection. Suitability of 
various reversed-phase columns for this purpose was compared; pH and mobile 
phase gradients were optimized with respect to the separation selectivity and 
sensitivity of detection. Because of different target compounds in various 
sample types, the overlapping resolution maps and the normalized resolution 
product approaches described earlier were used to select optimum columns and 
gradients to suit the analysis of the individual sample types. The methods were 
applied to the analysis of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beer, wine, tea, 
and yacon extracts. 32 phenolic compounds were identified and determined, 
including derivatives of benzoic and cinnamic acids, flavones, and a few related 
glycosides. Eight-channel CoulArray detection offers high selectivity and 
sensitivity with limits of detection in the low microg L(-1) range, at least an 
order of magnitude lower than single-channel coulometric detection using the 
Coulochem detector. No special sample pretreatment is necessary and, because of 
the compatibility of the CoulArray detector with gradient elution, phenolic 
antioxidants of different polarities can be determined in a single run. In 
addition to the retention times, the ratios of the areas of the pre-dominant and 
post-dominant peaks to the area of the dominant peak can be used for improved 
identification of natural antioxidants.

Commercially available curcumin, a bright orange-yellow color pigment of 
turmeric, consists of a mixture of three curcuminoids, namely, curcumin, 
demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin. These were isolated by column 
chromatography and identified by spectroscopic studies. The purity of the 
curcuminoids was analyzed by an improved HPLC method. HPLC separation was 
performed on a C(18) column using three solvents, methanol, 2% AcOH, and 
acetonitrile, with detection at 425 nm. Four different commercially available 
varieties of turmeric, namely, Salem, Erode, Balasore, and local market samples, 
were analyzed to detect the percentage of these three curcuminoids. The 
percentages of curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin as 
estimated using their calibration curves were found to be 1.06 +/- 0.061 to 5.65 
+/- 0.040, 0.83 +/- 0.047 to 3.36 +/- 0.040, and 0.42 +/- 0.036 to 2.16 +/-

curcuminoids are 2.34 +/- 0.171 to 9.18 +/- 0.232%.

The metabolic fate of the dietary isoflavones daidzein and genistein was 
investigated in human volunteers challenged with soya. Urinary diphenols, 
isolated by partition chromatography on Sephadex LH-20, were characterized and 
identified by profile capillary gas chromatography (GC) and electron ionization 
mass spectrometry (GC-EIMS) analysis of the trimethylsilyl ether (TMS) 
derivatives. Novel isoflavonic phytoestrogens found in the urine of volunteers 
were those of tetrahydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, 
6'-hydroxy-O-demethylangolesin and 2-dehydro-O-demethylangolensin. Other known 
diphenols identified were those of equal, dehydrodaidzein, O-demethylangolensin, 
daidzein, genistein, glycitein, and the lignan enterolactone. Two other urinary 
isomers with a fragmentation pattern closely resembling that of the persilylated 
TMS ethers of cis/trans-isomers of tetrahydrodaidzein, were characterized based 
on the elucidation of fragments associated with the loss of a non-phenolic-OTMS 
functional group in ring-C. These are fragments presented in the persilylated 
mass spectra of isoflavan-4-ols and isoflav-3-ene-4-ols, demonstrated here by a 
combination of simple and tandem mass spectrometry study of the deuterated 
persilylated TMS ethers of dihydrodaidzein. In a similar study we also present 
the data on the structural identification and fragment elucidation of the 
keto/enol tautomers of the TMS ether derivatives of the dihydro derivatives of 
daidzein and genistein, observed in the urine of volunteers and considered 
probable products of the derivatization process. Finally, the GC and GC-MS data 
of two unknown isoflavonoids and that of a lignan-like compound are presented 
together with those of dihydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, tetrahydrodaidzein and 
2-dehydro-O-demethylangolensin. The latter four were obtained here as products 
of small scale chemical synthesis in a preliminary study on the tentative 
identification of urinary isoflavonoids in human volunteers challenged with 
soya.

Flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) is a rich source of nutritive and bioactive 
compounds. The research evaluated the disparity in phytochemical profiles along 
with total and cellular antioxidant activities between oil and fiber flaxseeds. 
There were significant differences in total phenolics, total flavonoids and 
antioxidant activities among the six cultivars of fiber and oil flaxseed, 
respectively. Four phytochemical compounds including caffeic acid, p-coumaric 
acid and ferulic acid, and secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) were 
identified and quantified in the cultivars of oil and fiber flaxseed by HPLC 
analysis. Notably, the average of total phenolic and flavonoid contents, along 
with total antioxidant activities between fiber and oil flaxseeds were not 
different significantly; even the cellular antioxidant activity of fiber 
flaxseed was superior to oil flaxseed. These results suggest that fiber 
flaxseeds would be valuable candidates as functional products and dietary 
supplements production owing to the higher bioactive values as well as oil 
flaxseeds.

A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separation method with 
photo-diode array (PDA) and mass spectrometric (MS) detection was developed to 
determine and quantify flavonols, flavones, and flavanones in fruits, vegetables 
and beverages. The compounds were analysed as aglycones, obtained after acid 
hydrolysis of freeze-dried food material. Identification was based on retention 
time, UV and mass spectra by comparison with commercial standards, and the UV 
peak areas were used for quantitation of the flavonoid contents. Examples of 
HPLC-MS, analyses of orange pulp, tomato, and apple are presented. The method 
has been used to screen foods on the Danish market, and the contents of 
flavones, flavonols, and flavanones were measured.

A field experiment and two oxidation experiments in the laboratory were carried 
out. The content of the major anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-G) and 
cyanidin-3-sambubioside (Cy-3-Sa), in the fresh fruits from the 13 cultivars 
were from 361 to 1266 and from 269 to 656 mg/100 g, respectively. The two minor 
anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-sambubioside-5-glucoside (Cy-3-Sa-5-G) and 
cyanidin-3.5-diglucoside (Cy-3.5-dG), occurred in concentrations between 5 and 
47 mg/100 g. The content of ascorbic acid and quercetin in the fresh fruits of 
the cultivars varied from 6 to 25, and from 29 to 60 mg/100 g, respectively. 
Purging of the elderberry juice with N2 and/or addition of ascorbic acid reduced 
the oxidative degradation rate of the two major anthocyanins and quercetin. 
Ascorbic acid protected the anthocyanins, but not quercetin from oxidative 
degradation. Mixing of fruits with air during processing and even a low content 
of oxygen in the juice before tapping must be avoided by appropriate steps 
during processing. Improvement of the nutritional value of the elderberry juice 
and increased protection of anthocyanins against oxidative degradation may 
potentially be obtained by selection of cultivars with a high content of 
ascorbic acid.

Ethnobotanical reports from Latvia show that Tanacetum vulgare, Calluna 
vulgaris, Quercus robur, Artemisa absinthium, and Artemisia vulgaris contain 
phenolic compounds that have antioxidant properties, which can be beneficial in 
the treatment and prophylaxis of many diseases. The aim of this study was to 
characterize the phenolic compounds and antioxidant properties of these plants. 
Plant extracts were prepared using ethanol or acetone and then freeze-dried. 
Their total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total 
tannin content (TTC) were determined and characterized by HPLC. Their 
antioxidant properties were determined using a DPPH 
(2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging assay. C. vulgaris herb and 
T. vulgare leaf extracts contained the highest amounts of flavonoids, but the 
bark of Q. robur had mostly tannins and phenolic acids. A. absinthium and A. 
vulgaris had the lowest amounts of polyphenols. When compared using extraction 
solvents, all acetone extracts had more TPC, more TFC, and better antioxidant 
activity. All plants contained chlorogenic acid, which contributes to 
antioxidant properties. The analysed plant extracts could be used in future 
studies to develop medicinal products with antioxidant properties.

The consumption of 'not-from-concentrate' (NFC) fruit juices can be a convenient 
and enjoyable way to incorporate the nutritional benefits and flavors of fruits 
into one's diet. This study will focus on the effect of production of juices 
from apple and pear fruits, by using centrifugal decanter and tangential 
filtration, on the profile of polyphenols as a valuable source of bioactive 
compounds. Likewise, by-products from the juice industry were characterized in 
order to understand the high-value-added potential based on their composition of 
polyphenols. Briefly, apple and apple juice showed great contents of chlorogenic 
acid (0.990 ± 0.021 mg/g of DW), the dihydrochalcone phloridzin (1.041 ± 0.062 
mg/g of DW), procyanidins (0.733 ± 0.121 mg/g of DW) and quercetin derivatives 
(1.501 ± 0.192 mg/g of DW). Likewise, the most abundant compounds in pear and 
pear juices were chlorogenic acid (0.917 ± 0.021 mg/g of DW), caffeoylquinic 
acid (0.180 ± 0.029 mg/g of DW), procyanidins (0.255 ± 0.016 mg/g of DW) and 
quercetin derivatives (0.181 ± 0.004 mg/g of DW). Both temperature and 
tangential speed affect the amount of phenolic compounds in fruit juices, 
highlighting the need to control the technological process to obtain a more 
nutritious/healthier beverage. Overall, NFC juices arise as a better option when 
compared with concentrated juices. Furthermore, the higher yield of phenolic 
compounds found in fruit pomace clearly open new ways for upcycling this fruit 
by-product as a high-value-added ingredient.

Fresh strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.), raspberries (Rubus idaeus 
Michx.), highbush blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum L.), and lowbush blueberries 
(Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton) were stored at 0, 10, 20, and 30 degrees C for 
up to 8 days to determine the effects of storage temperature on whole fruit 
antioxidant capacity (as measured by the oxygen radical absorbing capacity 
assay, Cao et al., Clin. Chem. 1995, 41, 1738-1744) and total phenolic, 
anthocyanin, and ascorbate content. The four fruit varied markedly in their 
total antioxidant capacity, and antioxidant capacity was strongly correlated 
with the content of total phenolics (0.83) and anthocyanins (0.90). The 
antioxidant capacity of the two blueberry species was about 3-fold higher than 
either strawberries or raspberries. However, there was an increase in the 
antioxidant capacity of strawberries and raspberries during storage at 
temperatures >0 degrees C, which was accompanied by increases in anthocyanins in 
strawberries and increases in anthocyanins and total phenolics in raspberries. 
Ascorbate content differed more than 5-fold among the four fruit species; on 
average, strawberries and raspberries had almost 4-times more ascorbate than 
highbush and lowbush blueberries. There were no ascorbate losses in strawberries 
or highbush blueberries during 8 days of storage at the various temperatures, 
but there were losses in the other two fruit species. Ascorbate made only a 
small contribution (0.4-9.4%) to the total antioxidant capacity of the fruit. 
The increase observed in antioxidant capacity through postharvest phenolic 
synthesis and metabolism suggested that commercially feasible technologies may 
be developed to enhance the health functionality of small fruit crops.

Olive oil and fruit samples from six cultivars sampled at four different 
maturity stages were discriminated into cultivars and maturity stages. The 
variables-volatile and phenolic compounds-that significantly (p < 0.01) 
discriminated cultivars and maturity stage groups were identified. Separation by 
stepwise linear discriminant analysis revealed that Manzanilla olive cultivar 
was separated from cultivars Leccino, Barnea, Mission, Corregiola, and Paragon, 
whereas cultivars Corregiola and Paragon formed a cluster. The volatile 
compounds hexanol, hexanal, and 1-penten-3-ol were responsible for the 
discrimination of cultivars. All maturity stages were discriminated, with the 
separation of early stages attributed to oil phenolic compounds, tyrosol and 
oleuropein derivatives, whereas the volatile compounds (E)-2-hexenal, hexanol, 
1-penten-3-ol, and (Z)-2-penten-3-ol characterized the separation of all 
maturity stages and in particular the late stages. Hexanol and 1-penten-3-ol 
characterized the separation of both cultivars and maturity stages.

Virgin olive oils produced at wide ranges of malaxation temperatures (15, 30, 
45, and 60 degrees C) and times (30, 60, 90, and 120 min) in a complete 
factorial experimental design were discriminated with stepwise linear 
discriminant analysis (SLDA) revealing differences with processing conditions. 
Virgin olive oils produced at 15 and 60 degrees C for 30 min showed the most 
significant (p < 0.01) differences. Discrimination was based upon volatile and 
phenolic compounds detected in olive oils, peroxide value (PV), free fatty acids 
(FFA), ultraviolet (UV) absorbances, and oil yield. There were different 
discriminating variables for processing conditions illustrating the dependence 
of virgin olive oil quality on malaxation time and temperature. Volatile 
compounds were the dominant discriminating variables. Common oxidation 
indicators of olive oil (PV, K232, and K270) were not among the variables that 
significantly (p < 0.01) changed with malaxation time and temperature. Variables 
that discriminated both malaxation time and temperature were hexanal, 
3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ethyl alcohol-decarboxymethyl elenolic acid dialdehyde 
(3,4-DHPEA-DEDA) and FFA, whereas 1-penten-3-ol, E-2-hexenal, octane, tyrosol, 
and vanillic acid significantly (p < 0.01) changed with temperature only and 
Z-2-penten-1-ol, (+)-acetoxypinoresinol, and oil yield changed with time only. 
Virgin olive oil quality was significantly influenced by malaxation temperature, 
whereas oil yield discriminated malaxation time. This study demonstrates the two 
modes of hexanal formation: enzymatic and nonenzymatic during virgin olive oil 
extraction.

It is unknown whether the bioavailability of isoflavones is affected by the 
concomitant ingestion of glucosides or aglycones. This study was designed to 
investigate the effects of soymilk-based beverages containing different types of 
isoflavones on their absorption, excretion, and metabolism. Twelve healthy 
volunteers consumed 3 kinds of soymilk: untreated soymilk, 
beta-glucosidase-treated soymilk, and fermented soymilk. Blood samples were 
collected after 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 24 h. Urine samples were 
collected from 0 to 48 h. Concentrations of isoflavones and daidzein metabolites 
in serum and urine were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
After the ingestion of soymilk, the total concentration of isoflavones in serum 
rose slowly and reached a maximum of 0.94 +/- 0.39 micromol/L at 6.0 +/- 1.2 h. 
However, beta-glucosidase-treated soymilk and fermented soymilk increased the 
serum isoflavone concentration significantly more quickly with maximum 
concentrations at 1.0 h of 1.75 +/- 0.33 micromol/L and 2.05 +/- 0.32 
micromol/L, respectively. The urinary excretion of isoflavones after ingesting 
of these aglycone-enriched preparations was significantly greater than after 
consumption of untreated soymilk up to 8 h after injection, but not thereafter. 
The total and individual concentrations of isoflavones in serum and urine did 
not differ when subjects consumed the 2 aglycone-enriched soymilks. However, in 
equol producers (n = 5), the ingestion of ESM tended to increase urinary 
excretion of equol compared with the consumption of FSM (P = 0.08). These 
results demonstrated that the isoflavone aglycones of soymilk were absorbed 
faster and in greater amounts than their glucosides in healthy adults and that 
the metabolism of isoflavones might be affected by the type of soymilk consumed.

BACKGROUND: Polyphenols have been shown to be effective against many chronic 
diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, the consumption of 
raisins, being a food rich in polyphenols, has been attributed with 
neuroprotective benefits. Therefore, our main objective is to evaluate the 
effect of including 50 g of raisins in the diet daily for 6 months, on the 
improvement of cognitive performance, cardiovascular risk factors and markers of 
inflammation in a population of older adults without cognitive impairment.
METHODS: Design and intervention: This study will be a randomized controlled 
clinical trial of two parallel groups. Each subject included in the study will 
be randomly assigned to one of two study groups: control group (no supplement), 
intervention group (50 g of raisins daily during 6 months).
STUDY POPULATION: The participants will be selected by consecutive sampling in 
the Primary Care consultations of urban health centers in Salamanca and Zamora 
(Spain), taking into account the selection criteria.
STUDY VARIABLES: Two visits will be made, baseline and at 6 months. Cognitive 
performance will be evaluated (Mini-Mental State Examination test, Rey Auditory 
Verbal Learning Test, verbal fluency and montreal cognitive assessment (Moca)). 
It will also be analyzed the level of physical activity, quality of life, 
activities of daily living, energy and nutritional composition of the diet, body 
composition, blood pressure, heart rate, markers of inflammation and other 
laboratory tests of clinical relevance (glycaemia, total cholesterol, HDL 
cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides). In addition, sociodemographic

Biodegradation in marine medium of PHBV films with or without 5 % wt. of 
phenolic compounds (catechin, ferulic acid, and vanillin) was assessed at 
laboratory scale. Respirometric analyses and film disintegration kinetics were 
used to monitor the process over a period of 162 days. Structural changes in the 
films were analyzed throughout the exposure period using FESEM, DSC, 
Thermogravimetric analyses, XRD, and FTIR spectra. Respirometric tests showed 
complete biodegradation of all materials during the exposure period (the 
biodegradation half-time ranged between 63 and 79 days) but at different rates, 
depending on the phenolic compound incorporated. Ferulic acid and vanillin 
accelerate the PHBV biodegradation, whereas catechin delayed the process. 
Disintegration kinetics confirmed these results and showed that degradation 
occurred from the surface to the interior of the films. This was controlled by 
the degradation rate of the polymer amorphous phase and the formation of a 
biomass coating on the film surface. This is the result of the compounds 
generated by polymer degradation in combination with excretions from 
microorganisms. This coating has the potential to affect the enzyme diffusion to 
the polymer substrate. Moreover, the cohesion forces of the amorphous phase 
(reflected in its glass transition temperature) affected its degradation rate, 
while the slower degrading crystalline fragments were released, thus 
contributing to the disintegration process on the film's surface. Ferulic acid, 
with its hydrolytic effect, enhanced degradation, as did vanillin for its 
plasticizing and weakening effect in the amorphous phase of polymer matrix. In 
contrast, catechin with cross-linking effect hindered the progress of the 
material degradation, considerably slowing down the process rate.

The bioavailability of polyphenols in human and rodents has been discussed 
regarding their biological activity. We found different metabolite profiles of 
quercetin in rat plasma between two administration procedures. A single 
intragastric administration (50 mg/kg) resulted in the appearance of a variety 
of metabolites in the plasma, whereas only a major fraction was detected by free 
access (1% quercetin). The methylated/non-methylated metabolites ratio was much 
higher in the free access group. Mass spectrometric analyses showed that the 
fraction from free access contained highly conjugated quercetin metabolites such 
as sulfo-glucuronides of quercetin and methylquercetin. The metabolite profile 
of human plasma after an intake of onion was similar to that with intragastric 
administration in rats. In vitro oxidation of human low-density lipoprotein 
showed that methylation of the catechol moiety of quercetin significantly 
attenuated the antioxidative activity. These results might provide information 
about the bioavailability of quercetin when conducting animal experiments.

The fragmentation patterns and quantitation possibilities of three 
anthocyanidins (pelargonidin, cyanidin, malvidin), one flavonol (quercetin), two 
flavones (apigenin, luteolin) and two flavanones (naringenin, hesperetin) have 
been investigated as trimethylsilyl and as trimethylsilyl (oxime) derivatives by 
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results proved that anthocyanidins and 
flavanones form trimethylsilyl (oximes), while flavonol and flavones provide 
simple trimethylsilyl derivatives. In all cases, characteristic fragments of 
high masses are formed proper for quantitation purposes. Hydrolysis conditions 
for naringin, hesperidin and rutin have been optimized, resulting in the 
quantitative release of naringenin, hesperetin and quercetin together with their 
corresponding saccharides. These basic studies made possible the identification 
and quantification of the flavonoid, carboxylic-/amino acid and sugar 
constituents of citrus fruit juices and albedos, without any 
extraction/enrichment procedure. In total 33 compounds have been determined in 
hydrolyzed samples, such as 2 flavonoids (naringenin and hesperetin), 6 phenolic 
acids (trimethoxybenzoic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, quinic, chlorogenic and 
rosmarinic acids), 3 aliphatic carboxylic acids (levulinic, malic, citric 
acids), phosphoric acid, 4 amino acids (aspartic, glutamic acids, alanine, 
proline), 9 monosaccharides (xylose, arabinose, rhamnose, fucose, fructose, 
galactose, glucose, galacturonic acid, sedoheptulose), inositol, sugarphosphate, 
5 disaccharides and tocopherol. Measurements were carried out as the 
trimethylsilyl (oxime) ether/ester derivatives of constituents, in the 
concentration range of 2 x 10(-3) to 49.9%. Identification level of samples 
varied between 26.4 and 77.5%, expressed in dry matter content of juices and 
albedos.

In the present study we investigated the metabolic conversion of cyanidin 
glycosides in human subjects using solid-phase extraction,HPLC-diode array 
detector, MS, GC, and enzymic techniques. Volunteers consumed approximately 20 g 
chokeberry extract containing 1.3 g cyanidin 3-glycosides (899 mg cyanidin 
3-galactoside, 321 mg cyanidin 3-arabinoside, 51 mg cyanidin 3-xyloside and 50 
mg cyanidin 3-glucoside). Blood samples were drawn at 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h 
post-consumption of the extract. Urine samples were also collected at 0, 4-5,and 
22-24h. We have confirmed that human subjects have the capacity to metabolise 
cyanidin 3-glycosides, as we observed at least ten individual anthocyanin 
metabolites in the urine and serum. Average concentrations of anthocyanins and 
anthocyanin metabolites in the urine reached levels of 17.9 (range 14.9-20.9) 
l.mol/l within 5 h post-consumption and persisted in 24h urine samples at levels 
of 12.1 (range 11.1-13.0) nmol/l. In addition, average total levels of 
anthocyanins and anthocyanin metabolites detected in the serum were observed at 
5917 (range 197.3-986.1) nmol/ within 2h post-consumption. Cyanidin 
3-galactoside accounted for 55.4% (9.9(range 7-2-12-6) l.mol/) and 66.0% (390.6 
(range 119.4-661-9) nmol V) of the detected anthocyanins in the urine and serum 
samples,respectively. The metabolites were identified as glucuronide conjugates, 
as well as methylated and oxidised derivatives of cyanidin 3-galactoside and 
cyanidin glucuronide. Conjugation probably affects the biological activity of 
anthocyanins and these metabolic products are likely in part responsible for the 
reported health benefits associated with the consumption of anthocyanins.

Anthocyanins are reported to have many ""health promoting"" properties; however, 
despite numerous reports of their bioactivities, their absorption and metabolism 
in humans are poorly understood. The objective of this research was to detail 
the pharmacokinetic parameters of anthocyanins after the administration of a 
721-mg oral dose of cyanidin 3-glycosides from chokeberry extract to human 
subjects. Solid-phase extraction, preparative-HPLC, preparative-TLC, HPLC-diode 
array detection, HPLC-MS, and NMR were utilized to isolate, identity, and 
quantify anthocyanins in 0- to 7-h (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 h) serum and 0- to 
24-h urine samples (total individual urine voids over 24 h). The cumulative 
concentration of total anthocyanins (parent and metabolites) detected in the 
serum (0-7 h) was 376.65 +/- 16.20 (nmol x h)/L (area under the concentration 
time curve), reaching a maximum concentration (C(max) = 96.08 +/- 6.04 nmol/L) 
within 2.8 h. The parent anthocyanins represented only 32.0% [120.63 +/- 2.85 
(nmol x h)/L] of the total anthocyanins detected with 68.0% [256.02 +/- 5.23 
(nmol x h) identified as conjugated metabolites. Additionally, the total urinary 
excretion of anthocyanins over 24 h was 1071.54 +/- 375.46 microg, reaching a 
maximal rate of excretion (R(max) = 202.74 +/- 85.06 microg/h) at 3.72 +/- 0.83 
h. Parallel to the serum data, only 32.5% (347.85 +/- 60.61 microg) of the 
anthocyanins excreted in the urine (total 24 h) were the parent compounds with 
67.5% (723.69 +/- 92.59 microg) occurring as conjugated metabolites. The 
metabolites were identified as glucuronidated and methylated derivatives of the 
parent cyanidin 3-glycosides. The above results indicate that cyanidin 
3-glycosides are rapidly absorbed and metabolized extensively following a 
moderate-to-high oral dose in humans.

Levels of total phenol, catechins, and caffeine in teas commonly consumed in the 
United Kingdom have been determined using reversed phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography. Tea bags or tea leaves were purchased from local supermarkets 
and extracted in boiling water for 5 min. The resulting data showed considerable 
variability in both total phenols [80.5-134.9 mg/g of dry matter (DM) in black 
teas and 87-106.2 mg/g of DM in green teas] and catechins (5.6-47.5, 51.5-84.3, 
and 8.5-13.9 mg/g of DM in black, green, and fruit teas, respectively); this was 
most probably a result of differing agronomic conditions, leaf age, and storage 
during and after transport, as well as the degree of fermentation. Caffeine 
contents of black teas (22-28 mg/g of DM) were significantly higher than in less 
fermented green teas (11-20 mg/g of DM). The relative concentration of the five 
major tea catechins ranked EGCG > ECG > EC > EGC > C. The estimated U.K. dietary 
intakes of total tea catechins, calculated on the basis of an average tea 
consumption of three cups of tea (200 mL cup, 1% tea leaves w/v), were 61.5, 
92.7, and 405.5 mg/day from fruit teas, black teas, and green teas, 
respectively. The coefficients of variation were 19.4, 88.6, and 17.3%, 
respectively, indicating the wide variation in these intakes. The calculated 
caffeine intake ranged between 92 and 146 mg/day. In addition, many individuals 
will consume much larger quantities of tea, of various strengths (as determined 
by the brewing conditions employed). This broad spread of U.K. daily intakes 
further emphasizes the need for additional research to relate intake and effect 
in various population groups.

Total phenolics, total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity of 11 cultivars of 
fresh plums were determined using spectrophotometric methods. Identification and 
quantification of individual polyphenolics were performed using reversed-phase 
high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with a diode array detector. The 
total phenolic contents of various cultivars widely varied from 125.0 to 372.6 
mg/100 g expressed as gallic acid equivalents. The level of total flavonoids in 
fresh plums ranged between 64.8 and 257.5 mg/100 g expressed as catechin 
equivalents. Antioxidant capacity, expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant 
capacity (VCEAC), ranged from 204.9 to 567.0 mg/100 g with an average of 290.9 
mg/100 g of fresh weight. Cv. Beltsville Elite B70197 showed the highest amounts 
of total phenolics and total flavonoids and the highest VCEAC. A positive 
relationship (correlation coefficient r (2)() = 0.977) was presented between 
total phenolics and VCEAC, suggesting polyphenolics would play an important role 
in free radical scavenging. The level of IC(50) value of superoxide radical 
anion scavenging activity of the plum cultivars ranged from 13.4 to 45.7 mg of 
VCEAC/100 g. Neochlorogenic acid was the predominant polyphenolic among fresh 
plums tested. Flavonols found in plum were commonly quercetin derivatives. Rutin 
was the most predominant flavonol in plums. Various anthocyanins containing 
cyanidin aglycon and peonidin aglycon were commonly found in all plums except 
for cv. Mirabellier and NY 101.

Herein, we studied the variation in leaf and fruit morphological traits and 
antioxidant contents in 43 local and foreign cultivars (cvs) grown under the 
same experimental conditions in the widely cultivated plum species Prunus 
domestica and Prunus salicina. The peel contribution of fruit bioactive 
compounds in a serving portion, correlations among the examined parameters, and 
group patterns in each plum species were also studied. The species and cvs were 
sufficiently separated. Compared to Japanese cvs, European cvs had less 
elongated leaves and smaller and sweeter fruit with less total phenol and 
antioxidant capacities. The Japanese cvs 'Red ace' and the widely grown 'Black 
Amber', together with the European 'Tuleu Dulce', 'BlueFre', and the landrace 
'Asvestochoriou' make up groups with rich dietary sources of phytochemicals. The 
peel tissue contained higher total phenols and antioxidant capacities compared 
to the flesh, while the peel/flesh ratios varied widely among the cvs 
(6.6-fold). The variation in the antioxidant contents was lower among the cvs 
calculated per serving portion (3.7-fold); yet the peel tissue contribution was 
equal to that of the flesh (48.6%), signifying its high nutritive value. We 
observed increased sweetness in the fruit in the later-harvested cultivars, 
while cvs with more blue- and red-colored peel generally contained higher 
antioxidant contents mainly in the European plums. Moreover, larger fruit sizes 
were positively correlated with larger and more elliptic leaf shapes. In 
conclusion, the significant role of the genotype and the peel tissue as a source 
of bioactive compounds in plums were outlined with prospects of utilization in 
future breeding programs.

Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) contains abundant lignans including lipid-soluble 
lignans (sesamin and sesamolin) and water-soluble lignan glycosides (sesaminol 
triglucoside and sesaminol diglucoside) related to antioxidative activity. In 
this study, near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to develop a 
rapid and nondestructive method for the determination of lignan contents on 
intact sesame seeds. Ninety-three intact seeds were scanned in the reflectance 
mode of a scanning monochromator. This scanning procedure did not require the 
pulverization of samples, allowing each analysis to be completed within minutes. 
Reference values for lignan contents were obtained by high-performance liquid 
chromatography analysis. Calibration equations for lignans (sesamin and 
sesamolin) and lignan glycosides (sesaminol triglucoside and sesaminol 
diglucoside) contents were developed using modified partial least squares 
regression with internal cross-validation (n = 63). The equations obtained had 
low standard errors of cross-validation and moderate R2 (coefficient of 
determination in calibration). The prediction of an external validation set (n = 
30) showed significant correlation between reference values and NIRS predicted 
values based on the SEP (standard error of prediction), bias, and r2 
(coefficient of determination in prediction). The models developed in this study 
had relatively higher values (more than 2.0) of SD/SEP(C) for all lignans and 
lignan glycosides except for sesaminol diglucoside, which had a minor amount, 
indicating good correlation between the reference and the NIRS estimate. The 
results showed that NIRS, a nondestructive screening method, could be used to 
rapidly determine lignan and lignan glycoside contents in the breeding programs 
for high quality sesame.

Ready to drink (RTD) teas are a growing segment in the beverage category, 
brought about by improvements in the flavor of these products and healthy market 
trends driven by consumers. The presented results evaluated the antioxidant 
phytochemical stability of RTD teas from aqueous infusions of traditional green 
tea (Camellia sinensis) and a botanical tea from yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria) 
as influenced by packaging materials during cold storage. Two common packaging 
materials for RTD products are glass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and 
have been compared to a retortable pouch (RP), an emerging packaging material 
for various types of food since it is durable, inexpensive, lightweight, and 
easy to sterilize. Storage stability was then evaluated for each aqueous 
infusion prepared at 10 g/L at 90 °C for 10 min and evaluated at 3 °C in the 
absence of light over 12 weeks. Analyses included quantification and 
characterization of individual polyphenolics by high-performance liquid 
chromatography-photodiode array and liquid chromatography-electrospray 
ionization-mass spectrometry as well as changes in total antioxidant capacity. 
For green tea, concentrations of the three major flavan-3-ols, epigallocatechin 
gallate, epigallocatechin, and epicatechin gallate were better retained in glass 
bottles as compared to other packages over 12 weeks. In yaupon holly, 
chlorogenic acid and its isomers that were the predominant compounds were 
generally stable in each packaging material, and a 20.6-fold higher amount of 
saponin was found as compared to green tea, which caused higher stability of 
flavonol glycosides present in yaupon holly during storage. The antioxidant 
capacity of green tea was better retained in glass and PET versus RP, whereas no 
differences were again observed for yaupon holly. Results highlight the 
superiority of oxygen-impervious glass packaging, but viable alternatives may be 
utilizable for RTD teas with variable phytochemical compositions.

Flaxseed (FS) is a nutritional supplement with high concentrations of (n-3) 
fatty acids and lignans that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. 
The use of FS in the prevention or treatment of acute lung disease is unknown. 
In this study, we evaluated diets with high FS content in experimental murine 
models of acute lung injury and inflammation. The kinetics of lignan 
accumulation in blood, following 10% FS supplementation, was determined using 
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Mice were fed isocaloric control 
and 10% FS-supplemented diets for at least 3 wk and challenged by hyperoxia (80% 
oxygen), intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide, or acid aspiration. 
Bronchoalveolar lavage was evaluated for white blood cells, neutrophils, and 
proteins after a 24 h postintratracheal challenge of hydrochloric acid or 
lipopolysaccharide, or after 6 d of hyperoxia. Lung lipid peroxidation was 
assessed by tissue malondialdehyde concentrations. The plasma concentrations of 
the FS lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, were stable after mice had eaten 
the diets for 2 wk. Following hyperoxia and acid aspiration, bronchoalveolar 
lavage neutrophils decreased in FS-supplemented mice (P = 0.012 and P = 0.027, 
respectively), whereas overall alveolar white blood cell influx tended to be 
lower (P = 0.11). In contrast, neither lung injury nor inflammation was 
ameliorated by FS following lipopolysaccharide instillation. Lung 
malondialdehyde levels were lower in hyperoxic mice than in unchallenged mice (P 
= 0.0001), and decreased with FS treatment following acid aspiration (P = 
0.011). Dietary FS decreased lung inflammation and lipid peroxidation, 
suggesting a protective role against pro-oxidant-induced tissue damage in vivo.

Proanthocyanidins are well known for their involvement in haze and colour 
development during beer ageing. New methodologies are needed, however, to 
understand what happens to them in the bottled beer. For the first time in the 
brewing field, thiolysis was hyphenated to RP-HPLC-ESI(-)-MS/MS to investigate 
these flavanoids. Thirty minutes at 40°C followed by 10h at room temperature 
emerged as the best conditions for complete depolymerisation. 
NP-HPLC-ESI(-)-MS/MS was used to quantify and isolate fractions from monomers to 
trimers in a Sephadex LH20 acetone/water (70/30, v/v) beer extract. 
Unsurprisingly, a lower dimer/monomer ratio was evidenced in PVPP-treated beers 
than in silica gel-filtered beers. Most beer dimers are procyanidins B3 (two 
catechin units) whilst most trimers are prodelphinidins (catechin in terminal 
units and gallocatechins or catechins in extension units). Gallocatechin 
appeared to come mainly from malt. Despite the absence of chromatographic peaks 
corresponding to oligomers above trimers, an apparent degree of polymerisation 
close to six was calculated in the total LH20 extract. Still higher mean degrees 
of polymerisation (mDPs) were calculated for malt and hop, indicating selective 
extraction or depolymerisation from raw materials to beer. The main part of beer 
polyphenols is composed of complex undefined structures not degraded by 
toluene-α-thiol.

Two methods were developed for the quantitative analysis of phenolic acids in 
herb extracts. The methods were based on liquid chromatography-time-of-flight 
mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). 
The methods were compared in terms of their linearity, repeatability, 
selectivity, sensitivity and the speed of the analysis. The sensitivity was good 
for both methods, with limits of detection of <80 ng/ml for most of the 
compounds. The relative standard deviations (RSD) of the peak areas were on 
average 7.2% for the LC-TOFMS method and 1.4% for the GC-MS method. Both methods 
were found to be suitable for the determination of the target analytes, although 
GC-MS was better suited to the quantitative determination of compounds present 
at low concentrations.

A fast and effective dynamic sonication assisted ethanol extraction method was 
developed for extracting phenolic acids from basil, oregano, rosemary, sage, 
spearmint and thyme of the Lamiaceae family. The results were compared with 
results obtained by conventional solvent extraction techniques. A comprehensive 
two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC x LC) system interfaced to 
electrospray ionisation time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry was then 
optimised for analysis and quantification of the herb extracts. The optimised LC 
x LC system employed a combination of C18 and cyano columns. The relative 
standard deviations for the retention times were better than 0.05% (rosmarinic 
acid 0.1%) and those for the peak areas 2-14% (2 mg/l, n=3). Limits of detection 
were 18-90 ng/ml. The LC x LC-MS method was applied to the quantitative analysis 
of phenolic acids, and the results were compared with those obtained with 
conventional LC-MS.

A highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method with 
electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED) was developed for the determination of 
isoflavones. Electrochemical behaviour of daidzein and genistein was studied on 
carbon paste electrode (CPE) by adsorptive transfer stripping square wave 
voltammetry. The obtained electrochemical results were used for the development 
of HPLC-ED method. Furthermore, isoflavones were separated on an Atlantis dC18 
column using a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile (solvent A) and 0.15M 
acetate buffer of pH 5.5 (solvent B) at a flow rate 0.4 mL/min. A linear 
gradient profile (solvent B) was at 0-2 min 87%; 22 min 60%; 27 min 50%; 31 min 
45%; 47 min 87%. Full scan of multi-channel coulometric detection was tested and 
optimal potential at 450 mV was chosen for our purposes. Calibration curves were 
linear (daidzein R(2) = 0.9993 and genistein R(2) = 0.9987). The detection limit 
for daidzein/genistein was 480/394 pg/mL (1.8/1.5 nM) and per column 2.4/1.9 pg. 
Isoflavones extracted from soybean products (farina, meat, milk) by the 
accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) procedure and isoflavones present in human 
urine were determined by the HPLC-ED method.

Isoflavones are biologically active compounds occurring naturally in a variety 
of plants, with relatively high levels found in soybeans. Twelve laboratories 
participated in a collaborative study to determine the aglycon isoflavone 
content of 8 test samples of soy and foods containing soy. The analytical method 
for the determination of isoflavones incorporates a mild saponification step 
that reduces the number of analytes measured and permits quantitation versus 
commercially available, stable reference standards. Test samples were extracted 
at 65 degrees C with methanol-water (80 + 20), saponified with dilute sodium 
hydroxide solution, and analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography with UV 
detection at 260 nm. Isoflavone results were reported as microg/aglycon/g or 
microg aglycon equivalents/g. The 8 test samples included 2 blind duplicates and 
4 single test samples with total isoflavone concentrations ranging from 
approximately 50 to 3000 microg/g. Test samples of soy ingredients and products 
made with soy were distributed to collaborators with appropriate reference 
standards. Collaborators were asked to analyze test samples in duplicate on 2 
separate days. The data were analyzed for individual isoflavone components, 
subtotals of daidzin-daidzein, glycitin-glycitein, and genistin-genistein, and 
total isoflavones. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for repeatability was 
1.8-7.1%, and the RSD for reproducibility was 3.2-16.1% for total isoflavone 
values of 47-3099 microg/g.

BACKGROUND: The effects of industrial tomato paste processing and long-term (12 
months) ambient storage on the content and stability of quercetin, kaempferol, 
ascorbic acid (AA), dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA), β-carotene and lycopene were 
evaluated in a commercially produced tomato paste.
RESULTS: The initial thermal treatment (hot break; 93 °C for 5 min) resulted in 
significant reductions in quercetin (54%), kaempferol (61%), AA (63%) and 
β-carotene (30%), whereas subsequent processing steps (e.g. evaporation and 
sterilization) did not result in marked changes in these compounds. Lycopene was 
stable during hot break but decreased by 20% through evaporation and 
sterilization. The ratio of DHAA:vitamin C increased during hot break to 23%, 
whereas the ratio of DHAA:vitamin C remained relatively low in subsequent 
processing steps, indicating that AA was not oxidized. AA decreased with 
prolonged storage, with only 13% remaining at 12 months. The carotenoids and 
quercetin remained stable through 12 months of ambient storage.
CONCLUSIONS: Tomato pomace contained significant amounts of carotenoids and 
flavonoids, indicating that it may be an underutilized processing byproduct.

After intravenous administration of (-)-epicatechin gallate to Wistar male rats, 
its biliary metabolites were examined. Deconjugated forms of (-)-epicatechin 
gallate metabolites were prepared by beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase treatment and 
purified by HPLC. Five compounds were subjected to FAB-MS and NMR analyses. 
These metabolites were shown to be (-)-epicatechin gallate, 
3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, 4' 
'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, and 3',4' '-di-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin 
gallate. After oral administration, five major metabolites excreted in rat urine 
were purified in their deconjugated forms and their chemical structures 
identified. They were degradation products from (-)-epicatechin gallate, 
pyrogallol, 5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, 
4-hydroxy-5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)valeric acid, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic 
acid, and m-coumaric acid. Time course analysis of the identified 
(-)-epicatechin gallate metabolites showed that (-)-epicatechin gallate and its 
conjugate appeared in the plasma with their highest levels 0.5 h after oral 
administration; their levels rapidly decreased, and then they disappeared by 6 
h. The degradation products, mainly in their conjugated forms, emerged at 6 h, 
peaked at 24 h, and disappeared by 48 h. In urine samples, (-)-epicatechin 
gallate and its methylated metabolites were hardly detected and the degradation 
products began to be excreted in the 6-24 h period, peaked in the 24-48 h 
period, and then began to disappear. The most abundant metabolite in both the 
plasma and the urine was found to be the conjugated form of pyrogallol. On the 
basis of these results, a possible metabolic route of (-)-epicatechin gallate 
orally administered to the rat is proposed.

The chronic inflammatory skin disease atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by 
barrier defects, inflammation and microbial dysbiosis with a high prevalence of 
Staphylococcus (S.) aureus. Previously, we reported that a plant extract mixture 
consisting of curly kale, green tea and apple had beneficial effects on AD. 
Herein we further investigated the underlying promising effects exerted by the 
plant extract. The extract exhibited direct antimicrobial activity against S. 
aureus and reduced the number of extra- and intracellular S. aureus in 
keratinocytes. Gene expression analyses and luciferase reporter assays in 2D and 
3D AD-like skin models showed activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) 
by the plant extract. Knockdown experiments with siRNA revealed an AhR-dependent 
induction of the skin barrier molecule filaggrin by the plant extract in the AD 
skin model. Moreover, the plant extract demonstrated antioxidative properties by 
reduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species and induction of the 
antioxidative enzyme NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). In conclusion, the 
antioxidant and antibacterial effects of the plant extract in combination with 
the AhR activation may be promising for the topical treatment of AD. Further 
research has to uncover the full potential of plant extracts for the treatment 
of AD and other inflammatory diseases.

The effects of maturation (green, pink, and ripe) on phenolic composition of 
strawberry cultivars Camarosa, Dorit, Chandler, and Osmanli and their hybrids 
were investigated using a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. 
p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, ellagic acid, cyanidin-3-glucoside, 
pelargonidin-3-glucoside, kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin were individually 
quantified for each stage. The highest amounts of anthocyanins were obtained 
from ripe fruits whereas ellagic acid was found as the main phenolic in the 
green fruits. Phenolic concentrations were found statistically different in 
green and ripe fruits. One hybrid was found to have higher phenolic contents 
than the other genotypes. The p-hydroxybenzoic and p-coumaric acid levels 
changed during maturation, but no differences in contents of flavonoids in green 
and ripe fruit were detected.

A HPLC method coupled with coulometric electrode array detection for the 
determination of matairesinol in flax seed is described. The defatted sample was 
spiked with bisphenol A (internal standard), refluxed for 75 min in a mixture of 
ethanol-bidistilled water-12 M hydrochloric acid (2:2:1, v/v/v) to extract 
matairesinol conjugates and to hydrolyze them simultaneously. The extract was 
diluted with mobile phase [250 ml acetonitrile-750 ml buffer (730 ml bidistilled 
water, 20 ml glacial acetic acid adjusted to pH 3 with 5 M sodium hydroxide)] 
and injected into the HPLC system. Matairesinol was separated from other 
compounds on a reversed-phase column (Lichrospher 60 RP-Select B, 250 x 4 mm, 5 
micro m) and detected in a coulometric electrode array detector using a 
flow-rate of 0.8 ml/min. The potentials of the eight electrodes were set on 
+150, +200, +250, +300, +350, +400, +550 and +600 mV against modified palladium 
electrodes. The content of matairesinol determined in seven samples varies 
between 7 and 28.5 micro g/g. The limit of quantitation is 5 micro g/g.

Aspalathin, a flavonoid in Aspalathus linearis (rooibos), is absorbed by pig 
intestine as a C-glycoside.

Aspalathin, a dihydrochalcone and C-glycoside, is the most abundant flavonoid in 
rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which is well known as an herbal tea in many 
countries. Aspalathin appears to have in vitro antioxidative and antimutagenic 
effects. To understand the effects of aspalathin in the body, research on the 
absorption in the intestinal tract, metabolism in the body, and identification 
of circulating metabolites in vivo is required. We investigated the metabolism 
of aspalathin to identify the parent compound and related metabolites in urine 
and plasma after orally administering a rooibos extract (16.3% aspalathin by 96 
g rooibos extract, which equates to 1.1 kg dried rooibos material), produced 
from unfermented rooibos plant material, to pigs over a period of 11 days (oral 
dosage, 157-167 mg aspalathin per kg body weight daily). On days 7 and 11 of the 
study and days 1 and 2 after termination, urine was collected in 24-hour 
fractions, and plasma samples were collected at various time points. To our 
knowledge, this is the first time aspalathin metabolites have been identified in 
vivo, by presenting evidence of the absorption of aspalathin. Six substances 
identified in the urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were 
identified; these represent aspalathin and the metabolites methylated 
aspalathin, glucuronidated aspalathin glucuronidated and methylated aspalathin, 
a glucuronidated aglycone of aspalathin, as well as a metabolite of eriodictyol. 
The latter compound was methylated and contained 2 glucuronic acid moieties. 
This study showed that aspalathin can be absorbed by the intestine as 
C-glycoside as well as being cleaved in an aglycone and sugar moiety. The major 
metabolite in the enzymatically treated samples was methylated aspalathin. 
Between 0.1% and 0.9% of the administered dose of aspalathin could be detected 
in the urine on days 7 and 11 of the feeding study. No metabolites or aspalathin 
were found in plasma samples. The identification of the metabolites in vivo 
enables investigations to determine the biological potential of rooibos 
extracts.

BACKGROUND: Dietary intake of flavonoids, a class of plant (poly)phenols, is 
hypothesized to mediate a variety of beneficial health outcomes linked to fruits 
and vegetables (FV) intake. Absorbed flavonoids are metabolized and excreted in 
urine and may serve as biomarkers of FV intake and host metabolism, but defining 
the relationship of urinary biomarkers to the specific time of intake is 
unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize a targeted panel of 6 urinary flavonoids and 
determine the relationship to estimated dietary flavonoid intake over time in 
adults.
METHODS: Dietary flavonoid intake was estimated from both a 30-d food frequency 
questionnaire and 3-d diet records using the Phenol-Explorer database in 17 
adults. Twenty-four-hour urine was collected, and a targeted panel of 6 urinary 
flavonoids (quercetin, phloretin, naringenin, hesperetin, kaempferol, and 
isorhamnetin) was quantified using high-pressure liquid chromatography-diode 
array detection (DAD).
RESULTS: Compared to estimated intakes from a 1 d or 3 d diet record, total 
urinary flavonoids were most strongly associated with total FV (excluding 
potatoes) (rs = 0.53, P = 0.028) and total FV flavonoid (rs = 0.60, P = 0.011) 
intakes estimated by a 2 d diet record (including the day before and the day of 
the 24-h urine collection). There were no significant correlations between 
urinary concentrations of flavonoids and estimated FV intake using a 30-d food 
frequency questionnaire (rs = 0.36, P = 0.16).
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted flavonoid concentrations in a 24-h urine collection may 
serve as a biomarker for estimating dietary exposures over 2 d prior to 
completion of the urine collection, but not more distant dietary exposures.This 
trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03489213.

The bioavailability and urinary excretion of three dietary flavonoids, 
quercetin, hesperetin and naringenin, were investigated. Ten healthy men were 
asked to consume a 'juice mix' containing equal amounts of the three flavonoids, 
and their urine and plasma samples were collected. The resulting mean plasma 
area under the curve (AUC)(0-48 h) and C(max) values for quercetin and 
hesperetin were similar, whereas the AUC(0-48 h) of naringenin and, thus, the 
relative bioavailability were higher after consumption of the same dose. The 
study consolidates a significantly lower urinary excretion of quercetin 
(1.5+/-1%) compared with hesperetin (14.2+/-9.1%) and naringenin (22.6+/-11.5%) 
and shows that this is not due to a lower bioavailability of quercetin, but 
rather reflects different clearance mechanisms.

Phytoestrogens are a group of polyphenolic plant metabolites that can induce 
biological responses. Their bioactivity is based on their similarity to 
17beta-estradiol and their ability to bind to the beta-estrogen receptor. 
Although epidemiological data are inconclusive, phytoestrogens are considered to 
be beneficial for a variety of conditions, for example, hormone-related cancers 
like breast and prostate cancer. To investigate the biological effects of these 
compounds and to assess the exposure of larger cohorts or the general public, 
reliable data on the phytoestrogen content of food is necessary. Previously, 
food analysis for phytoestrogens was performed using either HPLC-UV or GC/MS. 
Here, we describe the development of the first generic method for the analysis 
of phytoestrogens in food, using automated solid-phase extraction and liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The presented method shows a good 
reproducibility and can be easily adapted to other phytoestrogens if required.

Phytoestrogens are secondary plant metabolites that have received increasing 
attention for their bioactivity, in particular due to their structural and 
functional similarity to 17beta-estradiol. Although urinary and plasma 
phytoestrogens can be used as biomarkers for dietary intake, this is often not 
possible in large epidemiological studies or in the assessment of general 
exposure in free-living individuals. Accurate information about dietary 
phytoestrogens is therefore important, but there are very limited data 
concerning food contents. In this study was analyzed a comprehensive selection 
of tea, coffee, alcoholic beverages, nuts, seeds, and oils for their 
phytoestrogen content using a newly developed sensitive method based on LC-MS 
incorporating (13)C 3-labeled standards. Phytoestrogens were detected in all 
foods analyzed, although the contents in gin and bitter (beer) were below the 
limit of quantification (1.5 microg/100 g). Lignans were the main type of 
phytoestrogens detected. Tea and coffee contained up to 20 microg/100 g 
phytoestrogens and beer (except bitter) contained up to 71 microg/100 g, mainly 
lignans. As these beverages are commonly consumed, they are a main source of 
dietary lignans. The results published here will contribute to databases of 
dietary phytoestrogen content and allow a more accurate determination of 
phytoestrogen exposure in free-living individuals.

Dietary phytoestrogens may be involved in the occurrence of chronic diseases. 
Reliable information on the phytoestrogen content in foods is required to assess 
dietary exposure and disease risk in epidemiological studies. However, there is 
little information on isoflavone, lignan, and coumestrol content of cereals and 
cereal-based foods, leading to an underestimation of intake. This is the first 
study of phytoestrogens (isoflavones: biochanin A, daidzein, formononetin, 
genistein, glycitein; lignans: matairesinol, secoisplariciresinol; coumestrol) 
in a comprehensive selection of 101 cereals and cereal-based foods-including 
breads, breakfast cereals, biscuits, pasta and rice-consumed in the UK using a 
sensitive LCMS technique with 13C-labelled internal standards. Phytoestrogens 
were detected in all foods analyzed; bread contained the highest amount of 
phytoestrogens-many as isoflavones-with an average content of 375 +/- 67 
microg/100 g wet weight (excluding soya-linseed bread with 12,000 microg/100 g). 
Most other foods contained less than 100 microg/100 g, many as lignans. Our 
study shows that all foods analyzed contained phytoestrogens, with the highest 
amount found in breads, making them one of the main sources of dietary 
phytoestrogens in the UK. These results will allow a more accurate estimation of 
exposure to dietary phytoestrogens.

The distribution of total phenolics and main betacyanins in red beetroot (Beta 
vulgaris) root was determined. Also, the subsequent effects of cold storage on 
the content of total phenolics, main betacyanins (betanin and isobetanin), and 
the main known ferulic acid ester 
(beta-D-fructofuranosyl-alpha-D-(6-O-(E)-feruloylglucopyranoside) were 
determined in the peel, which is the root part containing the largest amount of 
total phenolics. The content of total phenolics in the red beetroot water 
extracts was determined according to a modification of the Folin-Ciocalteu 
method and expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE). The compounds of interest 
were identified by HPLC-ESI-MS and NMR techniques, and the contents of compounds 
were determined by HLPC analyses. The total phenolic contents in various root 
parts were found to decrease in the order peel, crown, flesh. Significant 
differences in the contents of total phenolics and individual compounds were 
found when the effect of cold storage (5 degrees C, 0-196 days) on the 
constituents of the peel from intact roots was examined. In addition to the 
betacyanins of red beetroot peel found in our earlier study, tentative 
identifications of betanidin and feruloylamaranthin were made.

The soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein are found in high concentrations in 
human plasma and urine after soy consumption. However, in vitro and in vivo data 
regarding the oxidative metabolism of isoflavones in humans are scarce. 
Therefore, we have studied the oxidative metabolites of these compounds formed 
in human liver microsomes and excreted in urine of male and female humans 
ingesting soy products for 2 days. Human liver microsomes transformed the soy 
isoflavone daidzein to three monohydroxylated and three dihydroxylated 
metabolites according to GC/MS analysis. On the basis of a previous study with 
rat liver microsomes and with the help of reference substances, these 
metabolites were identified as 6,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 
7,3',4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 7,8,4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 
7,8,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, 6,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, and 
6,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone. Significant amounts of the same metabolites 
except 6,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone were also found in urine of female and 
male volunteers after soy intake. Genistein was metabolized by human liver 
microsomes to six hydroxylation products. The main metabolites were the three 
aromatic monohydroxylated products 5,6,7,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, 
5,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone and 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone. The 
aliphatic monohydroxylated metabolite 2,5,7,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone and two 
aromatic dihydroxylated metabolites, 5,7,8,3',4'-pentahydroxyisoflavone and 
5,6,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyisoflavone, were formed in trace amounts. The same 
hydroxylated genistein metabolites except the aliphatic hydroxylated one could 
also be detected in human urine samples. Methylated forms of the catechol 
metabolites, which were generated by incubations with 
catechol-O-methyltransferase in vitro could be detected only in trace amounts in 
the urine samples. This implies that this reaction does not play a major role in 
the biotransformation of the hydroxylated daidzein and genistein metabolites in 
vivo. Most of these oxidative metabolites are described as human in vivo 
metabolites for the first time. Their biological significance remains to be 
established.

Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of two tree spinach species 
(Cnidoscolus chayamansa McVaugh and C. aconitifolius Miller.) were determined in 
raw and cooked leaf extracts. Antioxidant capacity was assessed by the oxygen 
radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, and flavonoid glycoside composition 
was quantified by HPLC and identified by GC. Total phenolics and antioxidant 
capacity were higher in raw than in cooked leaf extracts. The ORAC values were 
strongly correlated with total phenolic content (r = 0.926) in all leaf 
extracts. The major flavonoids isolated from the leaf extracts were 
kaempferol-3-O-glycosides and quercetin-3-O-glycosides. C. aconitifolius leaves 
contained more varieties of the flavonoid glycosides than C. chayamansa. Cooking 
reduced antioxidant activity and phenolic content and resulted in losses of some 
kaempferol glycoside and quercetin glycoside residues in leaf extracts. The 
results of this study indicate that tree spinach leaves are a rich source of 
natural antioxidants for foods.

Lignans and isoflavonoid phytoestrogens, produced from plant precursors by 
colonic bacteria, may protect against certain cancers. We examined the effects 
of flaxseed consumption on urinary lignans and isoflavonoids. Eighteen women 
consumed their usual omnivorous diets for three menstrual cycles and their usual 
diets supplemented with flaxseed powder (10 g/d) for three cycles in a 
randomized crossover design. Three-day urine samples from follicular and luteal 
phases were analyzed for lignans and isoflavonoids by isotope-dilution gas 
chromatography--mass spectrometry. Excretion of the lignans enterodiol and 
enterolactone increased with flaxseed from 1.09 +/- 1.08 and 3.16 +/- 1.47 to 
19.48 +/- 1.10 and 27.79 +/- 1.50 mumol/d, respectively (P < 0.0002). Enterodiol 
and enterolactone excretion varied among subjects in response to flaxseed (3- to 
285-fold increase). There were no differences in excretion of isoflavonoids 
(daidzein, genistein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin) or the lignan 
matairesinol with flaxseed. Excretion was not altered by phase of menstrual 
cycle or duration of flaxseed consumption.

The total alkylresorcinol (AR) content and relative homologue composition of 21 
durum wheat (Triticum durum) kernel samples, as well as 5 pasta products and the 
corresponding flour mixtures, were determined. Durum wheat contained on average 
455 microg/g ARs, and the average relative homologue composition was C17:0 
(0.4%), C19:0 (14%), C21:0 (58%), C23:0 (21%), and C25:0 (6.5%). The homologue 
composition was found to be relatively consistent among samples, with durum 
wheat being different from common wheat by having a higher proportion of the 
longer homologues. No differences in content or homologue composition were 
observed in pasta products compared to flour ingredients, showing that 
alkylresorcinols are stable during pasta processing. The ratio of the homologues 
C17:0 to C21:0 was < or =0.02 for whole grain durum wheat products, which is 
different from those of common wheat (0.1) and rye (0.9).

Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and 
development of atherosclerosis. Levels of phenolics, major catechins 
[(+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, procyanidin dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4], phenolic 
acids (gallic acid and caffeic acid), caftaric acid, malvidin-3-glucoside, 
peonidin-3-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-glucoside were quantified by HPLC with UV 
detection for 54 French varietal commercial wines taken from southern France to 
study the antioxidant capacity and the daily dietary intake of these compounds 
for the French population. The highest antioxidant capacity was obtained with 
red wines and ranged from 12.8 mmol/L (Grenache) to 25.2 mmol/L (Pinot Noir). 
For white wines, Chardonnay enriched in phenolics by special wine-making was 
found to have an antioxidant capacity of 13.8 mmol/L, comparable to red wine 
values. For red wines classified by vintages (1996-1999) antioxidant capacities 
were approximately 20 mmol/L and then decreased to 13.4 mmol/L for vintages 
1995-1991. Sweet white wines have 1.7 times more antioxidant capacity (3.2 
mmol/L) than dry white wines (1.91 mmol/L). On the basis of a still significant 
French wine consumption of 180 mL/day/person, the current daily intake of 
catechins (monomers and dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4) averaged 5 (dry white wine), 
4.36 (sweet white wines), 7.70 (rosé wines), 31.98 (red wines), and 66.94 (dry 
white wine enriched in phenolic) mg/day/resident for the French population. Red 
wine, and particularly Pinot Noir, Egiodola, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, and 
Merlot varieties, or Chardonnay enriched in phenolics during wine-making for 
white varieties contribute to a very significant catechin dietary intake.

Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and 
development of atherosclerosis. Stilbenes have been shown to have cancer 
chemopreventive activity and to protect lipoproteins from oxidative damage. A 
method for the direct determination of stilbene oligomers (viniferin and 
pallidol) as well as astilbin in different types of wine using high-performance 
liquid chromatography with UV detection is described. In a survey of 21 
commercial wines from the south of France, levels of pallidol and viniferin are 
reported for the first time in different types of wines. Viniferin was found to 
be present only in red and botrytized sweet white wines with levels between 0.1 
and 1.63 mg/L; pallidol was not found in dry and sweet white wines but only in 
wines made by maceration with stems, with levels between 0.38 and 2.22 mg/L. 
Highest levels of astilbin were found in Egiodola (15.13 mg/L), Merlot (11.61 
mg/L), and Cabernet Sauvignon (8.24 mg/L) for red wines and in Sauvignon (5.04 
mg/L) for white varietal wines. Astilbin levels are highest for recent vintages, 
but pallidol is not found in older vintages. During noble rot development in 
Sauvignon or Sémillon grapes from the Sauternes area, levels of trans-astringin, 
trans-resveratrol, trans-piceid, and pallidol are quite low (<0.5 mg/kg of 
grapes). Viniferin and astilbin levels become optimum at 2 and 30 mg/kg, 
respectively, during spot grape and speckle grape stages.

A straightforward stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) for the quantitative

3-methylcatechol (3), 4-methylcatechol (4), and 4-ethylcatechol (5) in foods by 
means of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed. With or 
without sample preparation involving phenylboronyl solid phase extraction, the 
method allowed the quantification of the target compounds in complex matrices 
such as coffee beverages with quantification limits of 9 nmol/L for 
4-ethylcatechol, 24 nmol/L for catechol, 3-methyl-, and 4-methylcatechol, and 31 
nmol/L for pyrogallol. Recovery rates for the analytes ranged from 97 to 103%. 
Application of the developed SIDA to various commercial food samples showed that 
quantitative analysis of the target compounds is possible within 30 min and gave 
first quantitative data on the amounts of di- and trihydroxybenzenes in coffee 
beverage, coffee powder, coffee surrogate, beer, malt, roasted cocoa powder,

Maize bran heteroxylan samples were extracted in various conditions of severity. 
Their ferulate and diferulate content was investigated by GC-MS of methyl 
ester-TMSi derivatives. When extracted by 0.5 M NaOH in mild conditions, the 
heteroxylan sample contained a low level of ferulic acid (0.032% by wt.) and the 
main diferulate surviving alkaline extraction was found to be the 8-8' 
diferulate. On peroxidase treatment, this sample nevertheless produced a firm 
and brittle gel without any change in the diferulate profile. Typical lignin 
structures, mainly comprising syringyl units interconnected through beta-O-4, 
beta-1 and beta-beta interunit bonds, were evidenced in the maize bran sample. 
More importantly, these lignin structures were found to be tightly associated 
with the alkali-extracted heteroxylans. Thioacidolysis revealed the occurrence 
of 0.1-0.5% (by wt.) lignin structures in heteroxylan fractions extracted in 
mild or severe conditions, before and after purification of the polysaccharides. 
The gelling potential of the heteroxylan fractions was not only dependent on 
their ferulate level, but also influenced by associated lignin structures. These 
results argue for the occurrence of covalent linkages between heteroxylan chains 
and lignin structures which could participate in the peroxidase-driven gelation 
of feruloylated polysaccharides. They demonstrate the role of low lignin levels 
in the organization of native or reconstructed polysaccharide networks.

Spectrophotometric determination of tannins in tea and beer samples with 
iron(III) and 1,10-phenanthroline as reagents.

Lau OW, Luk SF, Huang HL.

A simple and accurate spectrophotometric method is proposed for the 
determination of tannins in tea and beer samples based on the reduction of 
iron(III) to iron(II) by tannins at 80 degrees C for 20 min. The iron(II) was 
then reacted with 1,10-phenanthroline at pH 4.4 to form a coloured complex. 
Background correction could be effected by precipitating the tannins in the 
sample solution twice with gelatin and kaolin. Absorbance measurements were made 
at 540 nm and the calibration graph was linear from 0 to 5.5 micrograms ml-1 of 
tannic acid with a slope of 0.213 A p.p.m.-1. The precision for the 
determination of tannins in a tea sample containing 9.45% of tannins was 1.8%. 
Most of the ingredients commonly found in tea and beer samples do not interfere 
with the determination. Several tea and beer samples were analysed for their 
tannin content using the proposed method.

The effect of olive stone removal before processing on the degradation level, 
secoiridoid and tocopherol contents, and antioxidant activity of monovarietal 
extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) was studied. EVOOs were extracted from olives of 
the Leccino, Moraiolo, Frantoio, Pendolino, Taggiasca, and Colombaia varieties 
both in the presence and in the absence of the stones. The degradation level of 
EVOOs was evaluated by acidity, peroxide number, and spectroscopic indices 
K(232) and K(270), according to EU regulation. The secoiridoid compounds typical 
of EVOO, namely, the oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives, hydroxytyrosol, 
tyrosol, and tocopherols were analyzed by HPLC. The antioxidant activity was 
evaluated by the xanthine oxidase/xanthine system, generating superoxide radical 
and hydrogen peroxide, and by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl 
test. Results showed that EVOOs obtained from both stoned and destoned olives 
had a very low degradation level, which was not affected by destoning. Destoning 
lowered slightly the alpha-tocopherol content in EVOOs but increased the total 
secoiridoid content and the antioxidant activity of EVOOs (up to 3.5-fold). 
However, these effects were variety-dependent and negligible in some conditions. 
It was concluded that a better knowledge of the reactions occurring during olive 
processing, and particularly on the involvement of endogenous pulp and stone 
enzymes, is essential to predict the effect of destoning on EVOO quality.

The degradation of secoiridoid, tocopherol, and antioxidant activity in extra 
virgin olive oils (EVOOs) was studied during 8 months of storage in closed 
bottles in the dark, at 40 and 25 degrees C. Picual, Arbequina, Taggiasca, and 
Colombaia monovarietal EVOOs possessing quite different fatty acid and 
antioxidant contents were used. The secoiridoid aglycones, namely, the 
oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives, and alpha-tocopherol decreased following 
pseudo-first-order kinetics. In all EVOOs oleuropein derivatives were less 
stable than the corresponding ligstroside derivatives and alpha-tocopherol. 
Accordingly, overall antioxidant activity decreased following pseudo-first-order 
kinetics, with rate constants ranging from 0.85 x 10(-)(3) to 4.1 x 10(-)(3) 
days(-)(1) at 40 degrees C and from 0.8 x 10(-)(3) to 1.5 x 10(-)(3) days(-)(1) 
at 25 degrees C. According to both the antioxidant activity and the hydrolysis 
and oxidation indices established by EU regulation to assess EVOO quality, 
Colombaia oil was the least stable, followed by Taggiasca, Arbequina, and Picual 
oils. Despite antioxidant degradation, EVOOs with high antioxidant contents were 
still ""excellent"" after 240 days of storage at 40 degrees C. These data led to 
the conclusion that the beneficial properties of EVOOs due to antioxidant 
activity can be maintained throughout their commercial lives.

Peaches are tasty and juicy, with a unique flavor. The flavors of peaches always 
vary with cultivars. To investigate the physicochemical and aroma 
characteristics of peaches, the sugars, organic acids, total flavonoids, 
phenols, antioxidant activities, and aroma compounds of seven peach cultivars in 
Xinjiang were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and 
headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS). The results showed that sucrose (59.83 to 87.34%), 
malic acid (32.41 to 59.14%), and chlorogenic acid (10.43 to 45.50%) were the 
dominant sugar, organic acid, and phenolic compound in peaches, respectively. 
The antioxidant activity varied between 147.81 and 394.55 μmol TEs/100 g. The 
analysis of the aroma structure of peaches found that the volatile composition 
of peaches was relatively consistent, though the concentration of total aroma 
and certain separate compounds were different between cultivars. Meanwhile, the 
aroma fingerprint of the peaches consisted of hexyl acetate, cis-3-hexenyl 
acetate, γ-decalactone, n-hexanal, 2-hexenal, nonanal, decanal benzaldehyde and 
6-pentylpyran-2-one, providing a clear green, sweet, floral, and fruity odor. 
These results provide complete information on the physicochemical properties, 
functional ingredients and aroma of the peaches.

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with photodiode array detection 
was applied for the characterization of anthocyanins in red-fleshed Budd Blood 
(Citrus sinensis) orange. More than seven anthocyanin pigments were separated 
within 30 min by using a binary gradient (0.1% H(3)P0(4) in water and 0.1% 
H(3)PO(4) in acetonitrile) elution on a Prodigy ODS column. Separations by 
reversed-phase HPLC and semipreparative HPLC on a Prodigy 10-microm ODS Prep 
column, and acid and alkali hydrolyses were used for identification of 
anthocyanins. The primary anthocyanins in Budd Blood orange grown in Florida 
were cyanidin-3-(6""-malonylglucoside) (44.8%) followed by cyanidin-3-glucoside 
(33.6%). Two other minor pigments were also acylated with malonic acid. 
Malonated anthocyanins represented the major proportion (>51%) of anthocyanins 
in Budd Blood orange. Total anthocyanin contents and juice color parameters (CIE 
L,a,b) were compared with six other Florida-grown blood oranges.

The contribution of each phytochemical to the total antioxidant capacity of 
apples was determined. Major phenolic phytochemicals of six apple cultivars were 
identified and quantified, and their contributions to total antioxidant activity 
of apples were determined using a 
2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging assay 
and expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC). Average 
concentrations of major phenolics and vitamin C in six apple cultivars were as 
follows (mg/100 g of fresh weight of apples): quercetin glycosides, 13.20; 
procyanidin B(2), 9.35; chlorogenic acid, 9.02; epicatechin, 8.65; phloretin 
glycosides, 5.59; vitamin C, 12.80. A highly linear relationship (r (2) > 0.97) 
was attained between concentrations and total antioxidant capacity of phenolics 
and vitamin C. Relative VCEAC values of these compounds were in the order 
quercetin (3.06) > epicatechin (2.67) > procyanidin B(2) (2.36) > phloretin 
(1.63) > vitamin C (1.00) > chlorogenic acid (0.97). Therefore, the estimated 
contribution of major phenolics and vitamin C to the total antioxidant capacity 
of 100 g of fresh apples is as follows: quercetin (40.39 VCEAC) > epicatechin 
(23.10) > procyanidin B(2) (22.07) > vitamin C (12.80) > phloretin (9.11) > 
chlorogenic acid (8.75). These results indicate that flavonoids such as 
quercetin, epicatechin, and procyanidin B(2) rather than vitamin C contribute 
significantly to the total antioxidant activity of apples.

In vitro trials have indicated various potential health effects of lingonberries 
( Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.). Most of these studies have been performed with 
berry extract or juice, and the detailed chemical structures of active compounds 
in these products have not been elucidated. Lingonberry contains 
cyanidin-3-galactoside as its main anthocyanin. Absorption and metabolism of the 
compound is not fully understood, and no studies of anthocyanin metabolism have 
been performed with lingonberries. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
urinary excretion of cyanidin-3-galactoside and its metabolites in young and 
healthy subjects receiving a breakfast containing 300 g of lingonberries. A 
fast, selective, and sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (uHPLC-MS/MS) method was optimized for 
the analysis of the anthocyanin metabolites in urine. Both intact 
cyanidin-3-galactoside and its methylated and glucuronidated metabolites were 
identified from urine samples. The two metabolites represented >50% of cyanidin 
excreted in urine. Maximal excretion appeared between 4 and 8 h after the meal. 
Also, the compounds were absorbed more slowly than reported previously in 
several studies.

The aim of this study was to compare some bioactive compounds in apples, peaches 
and pears and their influence on lipids and antioxidant capacity in rats. The 
content of total polyphenols (g/100g) was 0.23 +/- 0.03; 0.22 +/- 0.03 and 0.68 
+/- 0.1 in peeled fruits and 0.48 +/- 0.04, 0.47 +/- 0.04 and 1.2 +/- 0.12 in 
peels of peaches, pears and apples, respectively. Caffeic, p-coumaric and 
ferulic acids and the total radical-trapping antioxidative potential (TRAP) 
values in peeled apples and their peels were significantly higher than in 
peaches and pears, respectively. Contrarary, no significant differences in the 
content of dietary fiber among the studied fruits were found. The content of all 
studied indices in peels was significantly higher than peeled fruits (p < 0.05 
). A good correlation between the total polyphenols and the TRAP values was 
found in all fruits. Diets supplemented with apples and to a less extent with 
peaches and pears have improved lipid metabolism and increased the plasma 
antioxidant potential especially in rats fed with added cholesterol. The highest 
content of biologically active compounds and the best results in the experiment 
on rats makes apple preferable for dietary prevention of atherosclerosis and 
other diseases.

Flavanone glycosides (FGs) and polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) have been 
studied in pigmented orange (Citrus sinensis) juices and second-pressure 
extracts (SPEs) by high-performance liquid chromatography and diode array 
detector. Detection was performed simultaneously at two different wavelengths: 
278 nm (for determination of FGs) and 325 nm (for determination of PMFs). 
Qualitative distribution patterns of FGs and PMFs in juices and SPEs were 
similar, although the quantitative results are quite different. An increased 
narirutin/hesperidin ratio after centrifugation and the presence of high amounts 
of PMFs in SPEs, which remain unchanged after centrifugation, were observed. 
Therefore, a simple and affordable procedure to distinguish an orange juice from 
SPEs was proposed.

Tea has been proposed to have beneficial health effects which have been 
attributed to the polyphenolic compounds known as catechins. The bioavailability 
and biotransformation of these compounds, however, are not clearly understood. 
In this study, we used liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass 
spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS) to determine urinary glucuronidated and sulfated tea 
catechins and their metabolites (including methylated and ring-fission 
metabolites) based on the detection of deprotonated molecular ions and aglycone 
fragment ions. The compound resolution was achieved both chromatographically and 
mass spectroscopically. After green tea administration, the major conjugates 
appeared in human, mouse, and rat urine samples were identified as 
monoglucuronides and monosulfates of (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and 
(-)-epicatechin. We also found O-methyl-EGC-O-glucuronides and -O-sulfates and 
O-methyl-epicatechin-O-sulfates in human urine. 
(-)-5-(3',4',5'-Trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4) and 
(-)-5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6), the ring-fission 
metabolites of EGC and (-)-epicatechin, respectively, were also predominantly in 
monoglucuronide and monosulfate forms in the urine. In comparison to rats, the 
urinary metabolite profiles of tea catechins in mice resemble more closely to 
those in humans. This is the first report describing direct simultaneous 
analysis of multiple tea catechin conjugates in urine samples. This method will 
allow more thorough investigations of the biotransformation of tea polyphenols.

To identify and quantify biologically active components in rat serum after 
orally administrating the decoction of Bulpleurum falcatum L. and Fractus 
aurantii, one of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and 
validated. The HPLC separation was carried out on a Waters Nova Pak C(18) column 
using acetonitrile and water as mobile phase after the sample of rat serum was 
cleaned up with solid-phase extraction. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization 
in the negative ion mode and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) method was 
developed to determine the active components. Three flavonoids of hesperidin, 
neohesperidin and naringin were identified in the serum by comparing their 
retention times and three independent SRM precursor/product ion transitions with 
those of corresponding reference standards. The concentrations of naringin, 
hesperidin and neohesperidin in rat serum determined by SRM measurement were 
16.3, 11.9 and 14.3 ng/ml, respectively, after orally administrating the 
decoction of B. falcatum L. and F. aurantii. This method was validated in terms 
of recovery, linearity, accuracy and precision (intra- and interday variation). 
The recoveries from spiked control samples were 93.0, 89.3 and 91.2% for 
hesperidin, neohesperidin and naringin, respectively. Linearity in rat serum was 
observed over the range of 2.0-50.0 ng/ml. Percent bias (accuracy) and precision 
were well within the acceptable range and the relative standard deviation 
(R.S.D.) of the measured rat serum samples was less than 10% (n=5).

Nobiletin, a major component of citrus polymethoxyflavones, has many potential 
significant health benefits. While the biological activities of nobiletin have 
been widely reported, its in vitro and in vivo metabolic fate has been rarely 
studied. To explore the biotransformation mechanism of nobiletin we conducted an 
investigation into its metabolic profile in mouse urine, by various analytical 
techniques. Due to sample amount limitations for isolating and characterizing an 
individual metabolite, two possible nobiletin metabolites were prepared in a 
similar multi-step organic synthetic route: 
3'-hydroxy-5,6,7,8,4'-pentamethoxyflavone (3'-demethylnobiletin) and 
4'-hydroxy-5,6,7,8,3'-pentamethoxyflavone (4'-demethylnobiletin). Normal phase 
(silica gel) and C(18) reverse phase chromatography, as well as liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry, were employed in the 
separation of 3'-demethylnobiletin and 4'-demethylnobiletin, however, without 
success due to the structural similarities of these mono-demethylated 
nobiletins. Using a chiral packed column eluted under supercritical fluid 
chromatography (SFC) conditions, a clear separation was achieved. Thus, by 
comparing the SFC profiles of metabolite mixtures with the synthesized standard 
compounds, the major nobiletin metabolite of mouse urine is identified as 
4'-demethylnobiletin, whereas 3'-demethylnobiletin is a minor metabolite. In 
this study, the concentration of 4'-demethylnobiletin in mouse urine is 28.9 
microg/mL.

The polyphenolic compositions of three heartnut (Juglans ailanthifolia var. 
cordiformis) varieties (Imshu, Campbell CW1, and Campbell CW3) were examined and 
compared with those of two Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.) varieties (Combe 
and Lake). The nuts were defatted, extracted, and separated into three different 
fractions, the free phenolic acid (FPA), acid-hydrolyzable phenolic acid (AHPA), 
and bound phenolic acid (BPA) fractions. The total phenolic contents (TPCs) in 
both FPA and AHPA of the Persian walnuts were significantly higher (P < 0.001) 
than those of the heartnuts, but not in the BPA (P = 0.20). LC-ESI-MS(n)() 
studies revealed that except for the FPA fraction, the major polyphenolics in 
both heartnut and Persian walnut were ellagic acid and valoneic acid dilactone. 
Persian walnuts contained an average of 0.29 and 1.31 mg of ellagic acid/g nut 
in the 80% methanol extractable fractions FPA and AHPA, respectively. Heartnuts 
contained an average of 0.16 and 0.60 mg of ellagic acid/g nut in the respective 
fractions. Bound ellagic acid in the residue was 0.93 and 0.70 mg/g of nut in 
the Persian walnut and in the heartnut, respectively. Valoneic acid dilactone 
was tentatively identified and quantified as milligrams of ellagic acid 
equivalent per gram of nut. These components were found to contribute to the 
strong total antioxidant activities measured using ferric reducing antioxidant 
power and photochemiluminescence methods.

Flaxseed contains the largest amount of lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside 
(SDG) oligomers and is the richest dietary source of SDG. SDG oligomers in the 
flaxseed extract are often hydrolyzed to break the ester linkages for the 
release of SDG and the glycosidic bonds for the release of secoisolariciresinol 
(SECO). The hydrolysates of SDG oligomers are complicated because of the 
production of esters in an alcohol-containing medium. In this study, a new 
gradient reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has 
been developed to be suitable for the separation and determination of: (1) SDG 
oligomers extracted from the defatted flaxseed powder by a 70% aqueous methanol 
solution; (2) SDG oligomers and their alkaline hydrolysates, including SDG, 
p-coumaric acid glucoside and its methyl ester, ferulic acid glucoside and its 
methyl ester in an alkaline hydrolytic solution; and (3) the succedent acid 
hydrolysates, including secoisolariciresinol monoglucoside (SMG), SECO, 
anhydrosecoisolariciresinol (anhydro-SECO), p-coumaric acid and its methyl 
ester, ferulic acid and its methyl ester, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (HMF) and 
its degradation product in an acid hydrolytic solution. The content of SDG 
oligomers in a defatted flaxseed powder was found to be 38.5 mg/g on a dry 
matter basis, corresponding to a SDG content of 15.4 mg/g, which was determined 
after alkaline hydrolysis. Furthermore, this study presented a major reaction 
pathway for the hydrolysis of SDG oligomers.

A new analytical approach based on gas chromatography coupled to atmospheric 
pressure chemical ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry was evaluated for 
its applicability for the analysis of phenolic compounds from extra-virgin olive 
oil. Both chromatographic and MS parameters were optimized in order to improve 
the sensitivity and to maximize the number of phenolic compounds detected. We 
performed a complete analytical validation of the method with respect to its 
linearity, sensitivity, precision, accuracy and possible matrix effects. The 
LODs ranged from 0.13 to 1.05ppm for the different tested compounds depending on 
their properties. The RSDs for repeatability test did not exceed 6.07% and the 
accuracy ranged from 95.4% to 101.5%. To demonstrate the feasibility of our 
method for analysis of real samples, we analyzed the extracts of three different 
commercial extra-virgin olive oils. We have identified unequivocally a number of 
phenolic compounds and obtained quantitative information for 21 of them. In 
general, our results show that GC-APCI-TOF MS is a flexible platform which can 
be considered as an interesting tool for screening, structural assignment and 
quantitative determination of phenolic compounds from virgin olive oil.

Dietary phytoestrogens such as the isoflavones daidzein and genistein are 
thought to protect against chronic diseases that are common in Western 
societies, such as cancer, osteoporosis, and ischemic heart disease. In 
addition, there are concerns regarding the deleterious effects of hormone-like 
compounds, especially with respect to the development of infants. However, there 
is little information regarding the phytoestrogen content of foods, and 
therefore epidemiologic investigations of phytoestrogens are limited. As part of 
a study quantifying the consumption of phytoestrogens, the objective of this 
work was to assess the daidzein and genistein content of fruits and nuts 
commonly eaten in Europe. Eighty different fruits and nuts were sampled, 
prepared for eating, and freeze-dried. Daidzein and genistein were extracted 
from the dried foods, and the two isoflavones were quantified after hydrolytic 
removal of any conjugated carbohydrate. Completeness of extraction and any 
procedural losses of the isoflavones were accounted for using synthetic daidzin 
(7-O-glucosyl-4'-hydroxyisoflavone) and genistin 
(7-O-glucosyl-4'5-dihydroxyisoflavone) as internal standards. Of the 80 foods 
assayed, 43 contained no detectable daidzein or genistein, at a limit of 
quantification of 1 microg/kg dry weight of food. Nine foods contained more than 
100 microg of the two isoflavones combined per kilogram wet weight, and 28 
contained less than this amount. Currants and raisins were the richest sources 
of the isoflavones, containing 2,250 microg and 1,840 microg of the two 
isoflavones combined per kilogram of wet weight of food. Although fruits and 
nuts are not as rich in isoflavone phytoestrogens as are soy and other legumes, 
this is the first documentation of levels of daidzein and genistein occurring in 
these foods.

Dietary phytoestrogens have a number of biological effects, including endocrine 
disruption, antioxidant potential, and protein tyrosine kinase inhibition. 
Secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin are lignan phytoestrogens found 
in foodstuffs, especially flaxseed. Normally they are glycosidically linked to 
carbohydrates and in the large intestine are deconjugated from the carbohydrate 
portion by bacteria. The aglycone lignans can be further modified to form the 
mammalian phytoestrogens enterodiol, enterolactone, and enterofuran, which are 
absorbed into the body and excreted in urine. To assess the health implications 
of phytoestrogens in general populations, knowledge of the quantity in the foods 
eaten is necessary. This article describes a simple preparative procedure for 
the assay of secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin in foodstuffs 
after hydrolytic removal of any conjugated carbohydrate. The difficulties in the 
practical application of the assay procedure are illustrated and discussed. 
Analytical results indicating the concentration of secoisolariciresinol, 
matairesinol, and shonanin in a number of foodstuffs are presented. Also, the 
mass spectral data of a putative mammalian phytoestrogen, called enterofuran, 
identified in urine are presented.

A screening method using LC-DAD-ESI/MS was applied to the analysis of flavonoids 
in celery, Chinese celery, and celery seeds (Apium graveolens L. and varieties). 
Fifteen flavonoid glycosides were detected in the three celery materials. They 
were identified as luteolin 7-O-apiosylglucoside, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, 
apigenin 7-O-apiosylglucoside, chrysoeriol 7-O-apiosylglucoside, chrysoeriol 
7-O-glucoside, and more than 10 malonyl derivatives of these glycosides. The 
identification of the malonyl derivatives was confirmed by their conversion into 
glycosides upon heating and by comparison of some of the malonates with 
malonates that had previously been identified in red bell pepper and parsley. 
The concentrations of the glycosides and the malonyl glycosides in the three 
materials were estimated by comparison to aglycone standards. This is the first 
report of the presence of these glycosylated flavonoid malonates in celery.

Two commercial samples of soft (70% Canadian Eastern soft red spring and 30% 
Canadian Eastern soft white winter) and hard (90% Canadian western hard red 
spring and 10% Canadian Eastern hard red winter) wheats were used to obtain 
different milling fractions. Phenolics extracted belonged to free, soluble 
esters and insoluble-bound fractions. Soluble esters of phenolics and 
insoluble-bound phenolics were extracted into diethyl ether after alkaline 
hydrolysis of samples. The content of phenolics was determined using 
Folin-Ciocalteu's reagent and expressed as ferulic acid equivalents (FAE). The 
antioxidant activity of phenolic fractions was evaluated using Trolox equivalent 
antioxidant capacity, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging, reducing 
power, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, inhibition of oxidation of human 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and DNA, Rancimat, inhibition of 
photochemilumenescence, and iron(II) chelation activity. The bound phenolic 
content in the bran fraction was 11.3 +/- 0.13 and 12.2 +/- 0.15 mg FAE/g 
defatted material for hard and soft wheats, respectively. The corresponding 
values for flour were 0.33 +/- 0.01 and 0.46 +/- 0.02 mg FAE/g defatted sample. 
The bound phenolic content of hard and soft whole wheats was 2.1 (+/-0.004 or 
+/-0.005) mg FAE/g defatted material. The free phenolic content ranged from 0.14 
+/- 0.004 to 0.98 +/- 0.05 mg FAE/g defatted milling fractions of hard and soft 
wheats examined. The contribution of bound phenolics to the total phenolic 
content was significantly higher than that of free and esterified fractions. In 
wheat, phenolic compounds were concentrated mainly in the bran tissues. In the 
numerous in vitro antioxidant assays carried out, the bound phenolic fraction 
demonstrated a significantly higher antioxidant capacity than free and 
esterified phenolics. Thus, inclusion of bound phenolics in studies related to 
quantification and antioxidant activity evaluation of grains and cereals is 
essential.

Cocoa-phytochemicals have been related to the health-benefits of cocoa 
consumption. Metabolomics has been proposed as a powerful tool to characterize 
both the intake and the effects on the metabolism of dietary components. Human 
urine metabolome modifications after single cocoa intake were explored in a 
randomized, crossed, and controlled trial. After overnight fasting, 10 subjects 
consumed randomly either a single dose of cocoa powder with milk or water, or 
milk without cocoa. Urine samples were collected before the ingestion and at 
0-6, 6-12, and 12-24-h after test-meals consumption. Samples were analyzed by 
HPLC-q-ToF, followed by multivariate data analysis. Results revealed an 
important effect on urinary metabolome during the 24 h after cocoa powder 
intake. These changes were not influenced by matrix as no global differences 
were found between cocoa powder consumption with milk or with water. Overall, 27 
metabolites related to cocoa-phytochemicals, including alkaloid derivatives, 
polyphenol metabolites (both host and microbial metabolites) and 
processing-derived products such as diketopiperazines, were identified as the 
main contributors to the urinary modifications after cocoa powder intake. These 
results confirm that metabolomics will contribute to better characterization of 
the urinary metabolome in order to further explore the metabolism of 
phytochemicals and its relation with human health.

The aim of this study was to compare the amount and activity of phytonutrients 
in raw, grilled, and boiled eggplant fruit using chemical measures and a 
biological assay of oxidative bursts in human neutrophils. The thermally treated 
samples showed various changes in their chemical composition (dry matter, 
soluble solids, acidity, and the amount of alcohol insoluble substances) due to 
the cooking processes and were much richer in the main phenolic compounds such 
as chlorogenic and caffeic acids, which are known to be antioxidants. 
Consequently, their free radical scavenging activity was significantly higher, 
especially that of superoxide anion. The biological assay of oxidative bursts 
from human neutrophils in the presence of 
N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine confirmed the greater activity of 
extracts of the cooked eggplants with respect to raw eggplants. Successive 
extract dilutions showed a significant activity up to 1.25 microg/mL after 
cooking, while raw fruits resulted in an activity up to 10.00 microg/mL. These 
results showed that the thermal treatment commonly used before consumption can 
increase the content and biological activity of antioxidant compounds of 
eggplants.

Flavonoids are phytochemicals that are widespread in the human diet. Despite 
limitations in their bioavailability, experimental and epidemiological data 
suggest health benefits of flavonoid consumption. Valid biomarkers of flavonoid 
intake may be useful for estimating exposure in a range of settings. However, to 
date, few useful flavonoid biomarkers have been identified. In this study, we 
used a metabolite profiling approach to examine the aromatic and phenolic 
profile of plasma and urine of healthy men after oral consumption of 200 mg of 
the pure flavonoids, quercetin, (-)-epicatechin, and epigallocatechin gallate, 
which represent major flavonoid constituents in the diet. Following enzymatic 
hydrolysis, 71 aromatic compounds were quantified in plasma and urine at 2 and 5 
h, respectively, after flavonoid ingestion. Plasma concentrations of different 
aromatic compounds ranged widely, from 0.01 to 10 micromol/L, with variation 
among volunteers. None of the aromatic compounds was significantly elevated in 
plasma 2 h after consumption of either flavonoid compared with water placebo. 
This indicates that flavonoid-derived aromatic compounds are not responsible for 
the acute physiological effects reported within 2 h in previous human 
intervention studies involving flavonoids or flavonoid-rich food consumption. 
These effects are more likely due to absorption of the intact flavonoid. Our 
urine analysis suggested that urinary 4-ethylphenol, benzoic acid, and 
4-ethylbenzoic acid may be potential biomarkers of quercetin intake and 
1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene, 4-O-methylgallic acid, 3-O-methylgallic acid, and 
gallic acid may be potential markers of epigallocatechin gallate intake. 
Potential biomarkers of (-)-epicatechin were not identified. These urinary 
biomarkers may provide an accurate indication of flavonoid exposure.

We describe a reversed-phase HPLC method that uses gradient elution and diode 
array detection to determine four biologically active phenolic constituents of 
red wines: gallic acid, trans-resveratrol, quercetin and rutin. The method 
permits direct injection without sample pre-treatment. ODS Hypersil served as 
the stationary phase; the gradient was formed by acetic acid, methanol, and 
water. Each analysis required an equilibration period of 10 min and a run time 
of 50 min for completion. Previously, total phenols were analysed according to 
the Folin-Ciocalteu method, using gallic acid as the standard, and the results 
are given as gallic acid equivalent.

Germination is a process that enhances the content of health-promoting secondary 
metabolites. However, the bioaccessibility of these compounds depends on their 
stability and solubility throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The study aimed 
to explore how germination time influences the content and bioaccessibility of 
γ-aminobutyric acid and polyphenols and antioxidant capacity of lupin (Lupinus 
angustifolius L.) sprouts during simulated gastrointestinal digestion. 
Gamma-aminobutyric acid showed a decrease following gastrointestinal digestion 
(GID) whereas phenolic acids and flavonoids exhibited bioaccessibilities of up 
to 82.56 and 114.20%, respectively. Although the digestion process affected the 
profile of phenolic acids and flavonoids, certain isoflavonoids identified in 
7-day sprouts (G7) showed resistance to GID. Germination not only favored 
antioxidant activity but also resulted in germinated samples exhibiting greater 
antioxidant properties than ungerminated counter parts after GID. Intestinal 
digests from G7 did not show cytotoxicity in RAW 264.7 macrophages, and notably, 
they showed an outstanding ability to inhibit the production of reactive oxygen 
species. This suggests potential benefit in mitigating oxidative stress. These 
findings contribute to understand the dynamic interplay between bioprocessing 
and digestion in modulating the bioaccessibility of bioactive compounds in 
lupin, thereby impacting health.

White, blue, red and purple corns (Zea mays L.) were lime-cooked to obtain masa 
for tortillas. The total phenolics and anthocyanins content, antioxidant 
activity expressed as total reducing power (TRP), peroxyl radical bleaching 
(PRAC), total antioxidant activity (TAA) and quinone reductase (QR) induction in 
the murine hepatoma (Hepa 1 c1c7 cell line) as a biological marker for phase II 
detoxification enzymes were investigated. Among the extracts prepared from raw 
corn varieties the highest concentration of total phenolics, anthocyanins, 
antioxidant index and induction of QR-inducing activity were found in the 
Veracruz 42 (Ver 42) genotype. The nixtamalization process (masa) reduced total 
phenolics, anthocyanins and antioxidant activities and the ability for QR 
induction when was compared to raw grain. Processing masa into tortillas also 
negatively affected total phenolics, anthocyanin concentration, antioxidant 
activities, and QR induction in the colored corn varieties. The blue variety and 
its corresponding masa and tortillas did not induce QR. Ver 42 genotype and 
their products (masa and tortilla) showed the greatest antioxidant activity and 
capacity to induce QR.

This work aimed to establish the content of phenolic compounds, carbohydrates,

α-glucosidase, pancreatic lipase, 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX), acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE), and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), and antioxidant activity (ABTSo+ and

including, in the order of abundance, polymeric procyanidins, flavan-3-ols, 
phenolic acids, flavonols, and anthocyanins. The total content of phenolic 
compounds varied depending on the cultivar and ranged from 343.75 to 1419 mg/100 
g d.w. The cultivars of Ś2, Ś11, and Ś16 accumulated the greatest amounts of 
polyphenols, while in cvs. Ś42, Ś35, and Ś20 polyphenols were the least 
abundant. The highest antioxidant potential of 7.71 (ABTSo+) and 13.28 (FRAP) 
mmoL Trolox/100 g d.w. was confirmed for cv. Ś11. P. domestica fruits showed 
inhibitory activity toward α-amylase (2.63-61.53), α-glucosidase (0.19-24.07), 
pancreatic lipase (0.50-8.20), and lipoxygenase (15-LOX; 4.19-32.67), expressed 
as IC50 (mg/mL). The anti-AChE effect was stronger than the anti-BuChE one. Cv. 
Ś3 did not inhibit AChE activity, while cv. Ś35 did not inhibit BuChE. Thanks to 
the abundance of biologically active compounds, P. domestica offers several 
health-promoting benefits and may prevent many diseases. For these reasons, they 
are worth introducing into a daily diet.

High-performance liquid chromatography/diode-array detection (HPLC/DAD), 
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC/TOFMS) and quadrupole ion trap mass 
spectrometry (HPLC/QIT-MS) were used for separation, identification and 
structural analysis of lignans in Schisandra chinensis and rat plasma after oral 
administration of the herbal extract. Six lignans in Schisandra chinensis 
extract were identified unambiguously by comparing the retention time, their 
characteristic ultraviolet (UV) absorption and accurate mass measurement. A 
formula database of known lignans in Schisandra chinensis was established, 
against which the other 15 lignans were identified effectively based on the 
accurate extract masses and formulae acquired by HPLC/TOFMS. In order to 
distinguish the isomers, multi-stage mass spectrometry (ion trap mass 
spectrometry, MSn) was also used. The fragmentation behavior of the lignans in 
the ion trap mass spectrometer was studied by the six lignan standards, and 
their fragmentation rules in MSn spectra were summarized. These deduced 
fragmentation rules of lignans were successfully implemented in distinguishing 
the three groups of isomers in Schisandra chinensis by HPLC/QIT-MS. By using the 
three different analytical techniques, 21 lignans in Schisandra chinensis were 
identified within 30 min. After oral administration of the extract, 11 lignans 
in rat plasma were detected and identified by comparing their retention time, 
characteristic UV absorption and accurate mass measurement of peaks in 
HPLC/TOFMS chromatograms of the herbal extract. Finally, HPLC/TOFMS fingerprints 
of Schisandra chinensis in vitro and rat plasma in vivo were established. It is 
concluded that a rapid and effective method based on three analytical techniques 
for identification of chemical components was established, which is useful for 
rapid identification of multiple components in Schisandra chinensis in vitro and 
in vivo. In addition, it can provide help for further pharmacology and action 
mechanism study of lignans in Schisandra chinensis.

Phlorin (3,5-dihydroxyphenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside), an orange peel marker, has 
been searched in 45 species and varieties of Citrus. The phlorin content was 
determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography in juices and aqueous peel 
extracts of these different fruits. The phlorin content in C. reticulata peel 
extract varies from 0 to 1012 mg L(-)(1) with a mean of 162 mg L(-)(1). On the 
contrary, phlorin was not found in mandarin and clementine juices except for 
mandarin ""Commune"" and ""Beauty"" (33 and 30 mg L(-)(1), respectively). In the 14 
species of oranges and varieties, phlorin was detected in juices and peel 
extracts with a mean of 22 and 492 mg L(-)(1), respectively, while for 
grapefruits, means were 108 mg L(-)(1) in juices and 982 mg L(-)(1) for peel 
extracts. Tangors and tangelos which are hybrids (C. reticulata x C. sinensis 
and C. reticulata x C. paradisi, respectively) are characterized by the 
systematic presence of phlorin in peels (mean: 406 and 659 mg L(-)(1), 
respectively) while in juices its presence could be variable (0-73 mg L(-)(1)). 
These heterogeneity and values may be explained by the genetic variability of 
these hybrids and the phlorin content of their parentage group.

Recent interest in food phenolics has increased greatly, because of their 
antioxidant and free radical scavenging abilities. Popular beverages in the 
world include tea, coffee, cocoa, beer, wine and fruit/vegetable juices. All of 
these beverages contain phenolic compounds. In present study total polyphenol 
content and in vitro antioxidant properties were investigated in 16 red wines, 5 
white wines, 5 lager beers, 3 dark beers, 17 fruit juices and 5 vegetable 
juices. High polyphenol content was measured in red wines (1720 +/- 546 mg x 
L(-1)) and in some fruit juices such as elderberry and prunes (5,680 and 1,807 
mg x L(-1), respectively). The concentration of polyphenols was between 159 and 
5,680 mg x L(-1) in fruit juices and between 255 and 696 mg x L(-1) in vegetable 
ones, while low level of phenolics was observed in dark and lager beers and 
white wines (473, 376 and 392 mg x L(-1), respectively). All samples exhibited 
significant antioxidant properties such as hydrogen-donating ability, reducing 
power, chelating ability and total antioxidant status (TAS) value. These 
antioxidant properties strongly correlated with the total polyphenol content of 
the beverages.

This study investigates the impact of varying addition levels (5 %, 15 %, and 
25 %) of freeze-dried (FD) and sun-dried (SD) daylily flowers on the 
physicochemical properties, bioactive compounds, antioxidant activities, 
metabolomic profiles, and volatile compounds in craft beer. Daylily addition 
significantly altered physicochemical parameters, with the 25 % FD treatment 
enhancing polyphenol content by 48 %, flavonoids by 40 %, and antioxidant 
activity (DPPH scavenging) by 33.4 %. Metabolomics analysis revealed significant 
changes in the beer's secondary metabolite profile, particularly in flavonoid 
biosynthesis, terpenoid metabolism, and key volatile compounds such as ionones 
and oxabicycloheptane derivatives. While FD samples showed higher concentrations 
of bioactive compounds, volatile compound analysis revealed that SD samples 
exhibited stronger flavor characteristics, particularly in fruity, green, sweet, 
and floral notes. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated greater preservation of 
bioactive compounds in FD samples, especially those involved in flavonoid and 
terpenoid biosynthesis pathways. However, high addition levels (25 %) of both 
treatments increased off-flavor precursors, highlighting the need for careful 
optimization. These findings demonstrate the potential of daylily flowers as a 
functional ingredient in craft beer, with freeze-drying better preserving 
bioactive compounds while sun-drying providing superior flavor characteristics, 
suggesting that drying methods should be selected based on specific product 
requirements. This study provides valuable insights for creating unique, 
healthy, and flavorful craft beers through optimized daylily addition.

Cocoa products are obtained from the seeds of Theobroma cacao L. In this 
research, cocoa liquor and chocolate produced from cocoa beans from West Africa 
(Forastero, ""bulk"" cacao) and Ecuador (Nacional variety, ""fine-flavor"" cacao), 
were investigated, using a novel approach in which various analytical techniques 
are combined in order to obtain in-depth knowledge of the studied cocoa samples. 
The levels of various classes of primary metabolites were determined and a wide 
range of secondary metabolites, including volatile organic acids, aldehydes, 
esters, pyrazines, polyphenols, methylxanthines and biogenic amines, were 
identified and/or quantified by HS-SPME GC-MS (headspace-solid phase 
microextraction gas chromatography - mass spectrometry). and UPLC-HRMS 
(ultra-performance liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry). 
Odor Activity Values (OAV) were calculated to assess the contribution of 
individual volatiles on the final aroma. Various volatile aroma compounds were 
more abundant in the West African cocoa liquor and chocolate, while the 
Ecuadorian samples were richer in most quantified non-volatile metabolites. 
Principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed that the four samples can be 
clearly distinguished. Alcohols, pyrazines, amino acids and biogenic amines were 
found to be highly influential in causing this differentiation. The proposed 
approach can be useful in future studies on more extensive cocoa sample 
collections, in order to highlight similarities and pinpoint typical differences 
in chemical composition among these samples.

Sample preparation is often overlooked and is frequently considered as ""a means 
to an end"". This systematic study with a phenolic-enriched substrate, eggplant 
(Solanum melongena L.), was undertaken to evaluate the substantial variations in 
the extraction techniques, solvents, and parameters as described in the 
published literature. Direct comparison of over 10 extraction procedures or 
conditions was performed to show the importance and influence of sample 
preparation on the assay of phenolic compounds. Chlorogenic acid (CA) was the 
most abundant phenolic acid accounting for >75% of the total phenolic acids 
content extracted from the eggplant sample. Optimum extraction of CA and total 
phenolics (TP) from Black Bell cultivar of eggplant were obtained when 
extractions were performed with a mixture of MeOH/H2O at a ratio of 80:20% v/v 
using a pressurized liquid extractor (PLE) at 100 degrees C. The amount of CA 
and TP extracted from eggplant by the previously reported procedures using a 
wrist shaker, rotary shaker, stirring, sonication, or reflux with different 
extraction solvents (acetone or varying composition of MeOH/H2O solvent 
mixtures) varied significantly between 5 and 95% as compared to PLE. The 
predominant phenolic acids in the free phenolic acid fraction of Black Beauty 
cultivar of eggplant were CA isomers. However, caffeic acid isomers were the 
major phenolic acids extracted from the base-hydrolyzed fraction. The total 
amount of caffeic acid extracted from the Italian Neon cultivar was more that 
twice that of four other eggplant cultivars (Orient Express, Calliope Zebra 
Stripe, Orient Charm Neon, and Black Beauty).

Resveratrol in the fruits of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.), the lowbush 
""wild"" blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton), the rabbiteye blueberry 
(Vaccinium ashei Reade), and the highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) 
were measured using a new assay based on high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The LC-MS/MS assay provided 
lower limits of detection than previous methods for resveratrol measurement, 90 
fmol of trans-resveratrol injected on-column, and a linear standard curve 
spanning >3 orders of magnitude. The recoveries of resveratrol from blueberries 
spiked with 1.8, 3.6, or 36 ng/g were 91.5 +/- 4.5, 95.6 +/- 6.5, and 88.0 +/- 
3.6%, respectively. trans-Resveratrol but not cis-resveratrol was detected in 
both blueberry and bilberry samples. The highest levels of trans-resvertatrol in 
these specimens were 140.0 +/- 29.9 pmol/g in highbush blueberries from Michigan 
and 71.0 +/- 15.0 pmol/g in bilberries from Poland. However, considerable 
regional variation was observed; highbush blueberries from British Columbia 
contained no detectable resveratrol. Because blueberries and bilberries are 
often consumed after cooking, the effect of baking on resveratrol content was 
investigated. After 18 min of heating at 190 degrees C, between 17 and 46% of 
the resveratrol had degraded in the various Vaccinium species. Therefore, the 
resveratrol content of baked or heat-processed blueberries or bilberries should 
be expected to be lower than in the raw fruit. Although blueberries and 
bilberries were found to contain resveratrol, the level of this chemoprotective 
compound in these fruits was <10% that reported for grapes. Furthermore, cooking 
or heat processing of these berries will contribute to the degradation of 
resveratrol.

A highly sensitive and specific electrospray ionization (ESI) liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method for quantitation of 
naringenin (NAR) and an explanation for the double peaks phenomenon was 
developed and validated. NAR was extracted from rat plasma and tissues along 
with the internal standard (IS), hesperidin, with ethyl acetate. The analytes 
were analyzed in the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode as the 
precursor/product ion pair of m/z 273.4/151.3 for NAR and m/z 611.5/303.3 for 
the IS. The assay was linear over the concentration range of 5-2500 ng/mL. The 
lower limit quantification was 5 ng/mL, available for plasma pharmacokinetics of 
NAR in rats. Accuracy in within- and between-run precisions showed good 
reproducibility. When NAR was administered orally, only little and predominantly 
its glucuronidation were into circulation in the plasma. There existed double 
peaks phenomenon in plasma concentration-time curve leading to the relatively 
slow elimination of NAR in plasma. The results showed that there was a linear 
relationship between the AUC of total NAR and dosages. And the double peaks are 
mainly due to enterohepatic circulation.

High-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode array and 
electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (MS) detection was used to study 
phenolic compounds in berries of black, green, red, and white currants (Ribes 
spp.). UV-visible spectrometry was a valuable tool for the identification of the 
class of the phenolic compound, whereas MS and MS-MS fragmentation data were 
useful for further structural characterization. Distinct similarities were found 
in the relative distribution of conjugated forms of phenolic compounds among the 
four currants. Phenolic acids were found mainly as hexose esters. Flavonol 
glycosides and anthocyanin pigments were mainly found as 3-O-rutinosides and 
second as 3-O-glucosides. However, cyanidin 3-O-sambubioside and quercetin 
hexoside-malonate were notable phenolic compounds in red currant. Flavonol 
hexoside-malonates were identified and quantified in the berries of currants for 
the first time.

High-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode array and 
electrospray ionization mass spectrometric detection was used to study soluble 
and insoluble forms of phenolic compounds in strawberries, raspberries (red and 
yellow cultivated and red wild), arctic bramble, and cloudberries. 
Hydroxycinnamic acids were present as free forms in cloudberries and mainly as 
sugar esters in the other berries. Quercetin 3-glucuronide was the typical 
flavonol glycoside in all of the berries studied. The composition of the 
predominant anthocyanins can be used to distinguish the studied red Rubus 
species from each other since cyanidin was glycosylated typically with 
3-sophorose (56%) in cultivated red raspberry, with 3-sophorose (30%) and 
3-glucose (27%) in wild red raspberry, and with 3-rutinose (80%) in arctic 
bramble. Ellagic acid was present as free and glycosylated forms and as 
ellagitannins of varying degrees of polymerization. Comparable levels of 
ellagitannins were obtained by the analysis of soluble ellagitannins as gallic 
acid equivalents and by the analysis of ellagic acid equivalents released by 
acid hydrolysis of the extracts.

The present study evaluated the antiproliferative capacity and possible cell 
death mechanisms of lyophilized mango pulp extract (LMPE), applied to human 
colon cancer cells (SW480) and their metastasis-derived counterparts (SW620). 
The total phenolic content of LMPE was estimated by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. 
Three assays were employed to determine its antioxidant capacity: 
ferric-reducing antioxidant power, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, and 
2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. Furthermore, the antiproliferative activity of 
LMPE was assessed by sulforhodamine B, clonogenic, and Ki-67 assays. Flow 
cytometry was employed to examine the cell cycle, production of intracellular 
reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell-surface phosphatidylserine, and change in 
mitochondrial membrane potential. LMPE exhibited a high level of total phenolic 
content and antioxidant activity. The mean maximal inhibitory concentration 
values of LMPE at 48 h of exposure were 43 and 29 mg/mL for SW480 and SW620, 
respectively. In the SW480 and SW620 cell lines, LMPE at 50 mg/mL and 48 h of 
exposure induced an increase in intracellular ROS, cell cycle arrest in the G2/M 
phase, and probably, apoptotic processes without mitochondrial depolarization. 
LMPE had an antiproliferative capacity against the human colorectal cancer cell 
lines SW480 and SW620. These results highlight the chemopreventive potential of 
LMPE in colorectal cancer treatments.

Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is one of the most important legume crops for 
human consumption because of its nearly perfect nutritional composition. 
However, the crop yield is invariably constrained by phosphorus (P) stress 
across all farming systems. The present study aimed to unravel the mechanistic 
basis of common bean response to P stress at the early vegetative phase using an 
integrated multi-omic approach. In vitro experiments were carried out with P 
sufficient (P+) and total P deficient (P-) treatments using common bean SFB-1 
seed cultivar. The plants were grown in MGRL media for a duration of three 
weeks. Various morphological traits were significantly reduced under P- stress 
conditions. There was a significant decrease in the levels of biochemical 
parameters such as free amino acids, secondary metabolites, and osmolytes 
(proline, total soluble sugars, and glycine betaine) under P- growth conditions. 
Additionally, photosynthetic pigments (such as chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, 
total chlorophyll, and total carotenoids), physiological parameters (such as 
relative water content and stress injury), as well as both enzymatic and 
non-enzymatic antioxidants (including catalase, peroxidase, superoxide 
dismutase, total phenolics, and flavonoids), were also significantly reduced. 
Proteomic analysis identified two key proteins, homocysteine methyltransferase 
and DDB1-CUL4 associated factor 1-like protein, which are involved in various 
stress adaptation pathways. Furthermore, techniques such as FTIR spectroscopy, 
SEM, SEM-EDX, and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy were used to validate the 
metabolic changes induced by phosphorus deficiency. Phosphorus deficiency led to 
profound metabolic changes affecting photosynthesis, defense-related protein 
expression, cell wall composition, secondary metabolite production, levels of 
phytohormone precursors, free amino acids, antioxidant activity, and osmolyte 
accumulation, all of which contributed to inhibited plant growth and 
development.

A method was developed to determine the flavanols prodelphinidin B3, procyanidin 
B3, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin by high-performance liquid chromatography, 
using dual-channel electrochemical detection. This method was especially suited 
to the direct analysis of beer samples and to analysis of acetone extracts of 
barley samples, and was capable of determining proanthocyanidins and catechins 
at levels of 0.1-5.0 mg l-1. The use of dual-channel electrochemical detection 
also enabled unambiguous peak identification by measurement of collection 
efficiencies. This method offered improved sensitivity and selectivity compared 
with ultraviolet detection, and sample preparation procedures were greatly 
simplified. The method was applied to the comparison of stabilized and 
unstabilized lagers, and to the analysis of different barley varieties grown in 
Ireland.

Three espresso coffee (EC) samples of different botanical varieties and types of 
roast were prepared in standard conditions using an experimental EC prototype: 
Arabica coffee, Robusta Natural blend, and Robusta Torrefacto blend (a special 
roast by adding sugar). The ECs were characterized with regard to the physical 
parameters, amount of total solids, total solids on filtrate, lipids, caffeine, 
trigonelline, and chlorogenic acids by HPLC, and sensory descriptive analysis 
related to foam appearance, taste, and mouthfeel. Principal component analysis 
(PCA) was applied to differentiate the EC samples. Arabica and Robusta samples 
were separated successfully by principal component 1 (55.3% of variance) 
including physicochemical and sensory parameters related to foam and taste of 
ECs. Torrefacto and Robusta Natural EC samples were separated by principal 
component 2 (20.7% of total variance) including mouthfeel and other attributes 
of color foam. Some interesting correlations among sensory and physicochemical 
variables were found. A very simple discriminate function was obtained by 
discriminate analysis allowing the classification of each EC sample into its 
respective group with a success rate of 100%.

Two commonly consumed plant foods, onion bulbs and asparagus spears, were 
subjected to typical domestic processing, including chopping, maceration, and 
boiling. The impact of these processes on flavonol content was assessed. 
Further, the consequences of these processes on the antioxidant capacity of the 
tissues were evaluated with the beta-carotene bleaching method. Chopping 
significantly affected rutin content in asparagus, yielding an 18.5% decrease in 
60 min; but in onions, quercetin 3,4'-diglucoside (Q(DG)) and quercetin 
4'-glucoside (Q(MG)) were virtually unaffected by chopping. Boiling for 60 min 
had more severe effects, as it caused overall flavonol losses of 20.6 and 43.9% 
in onions and asparagus, respectively. Chopping of tissues did not considerably 
influence the antioxidant capacity, but boiling did provoke notable changes.

Stress factors occurring during the growing season and potato storage, can 
negatively affect the quality of tubers, including an increased tendency to 
enzymatic darkening. Abiotic stress due to water shortage is a major factor 
limiting agricultural production. The purpose of the study was to determine the 
effect of cultivation technology based on the use of biostimulant, hydrogel and 
irrigation as well as storage on the propensity to darkening and the content of 
sugars and organic acids. The results show that genotypic and technological 
variability in interaction with growing season conditions had a significant 
(p < 0.05) effect on the oxidative potential (OP) of potato tubers. The Denar 
cultivar, compared to the 'Gardena', was characterized by a lower tendency to 
enzymatic darkening. Application of biostimulant and hydrogel generally 
contributed to lowering the oxidative potential of the tested cultivars. The 
application of anti-stress agents had no effect on organic acid content. The 
long-term storage caused an increase in the content of total sugars (TS) (22%), 
reducing sugars (RS) (49%), chlorogenic acid (ACH) (11%), and loss of ascorbic 
acid (AA) (6%) in the tubers which contributed to an increase in the oxidative 
potential of potato tubers (16%). The correlation coefficients obtained 
(p < 0.05) confirm the dependence of OP on the concentration of organic acids.

PURPOSE: Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), an anthocyanin component of fruits and 
berries, possesses cancer chemopreventive properties in mouse models of 
carcinogenesis. Its pharmacokinetics and metabolism in mice have hitherto not 
been studied.
METHODS: C57BL6J mice received C3G by either gavage at 500 mg/kg or tail vein 
injection at 1 mg/kg. Blood, urine, bile and heart, lung, kidney, liver, 
prostate, brain and gastrointestinal (gi) mucosal tissues were obtained up to 2 
h after administration. Levels of C3G and its anthocyanin metabolites were 
determined by HPLC with visible detection. Metabolites were identified by 
LC/MS/MS.
RESULTS: After oral administration peak concentrations of anthocyanins occurred 
within 30 min after administration. Levels were highest in the urine and gi 
mucosa. In the gi mucosa and liver the predominant flavonoid species after oral 
administration was C3G, whilst after iv dosing the majority of anthocyanins was 
C3G metabolites. After oral or iv administration, C3G half-lives in the 
different biofluids and tissues ranged from 0.7 to 1.8 h and 0.3 to 0.7 h, 
respectively. Systemic bioavailabilities for parent C3G and total anthocyanins 
were 1.7 and 3.3%, respectively. The major metabolites of C3G were products of 
methylation and glucuronidation. Cyanidin was a minor metabolite in the gut.
CONCLUSION: C3G and its metabolites were recovered from murine tissues which may 
be targets for cancer chemopreventive intervention. Anthocyanin levels achieved 
in the gi mucosa, prostate and the kidneys were of an order of magnitude 
consistent with pharmacological activity.

Pharmacokinetics of trans-resveratrol in its aglycone (RES(AGL)) and glucuronide 
(RES(GLU)) forms were studied following intravenous (15 mg/kg i.v.) and oral (50 
mg/kg p.o.) administration of trans-resveratrol in a solution of 
beta-cyclodextrin to intact rats. In addition, the enterohepatic recirculation 
of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) was assessed in a linked-rat model. Multiple plasma and 
urine samples were collected and concentrations of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) were 
determined using an electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
spectrometry method. After i.v. administration, plasma concentrations of 
RES(AGL) declined with a rapid elimination half-life (T(1/2), 0.13 h), followed 
by sudden increases in plasma concentrations 4 to 8 h after drug administration. 
These plasma concentrations resulted in a significant prolongation of the 
terminal elimination half-life of RES(AGL) (T(1/2TER), 1.31 h). RES(AGL) and 
RES(GLU) also displayed sudden increases in plasma concentrations 4 to 8 h after 
oral administration, with T(1/2TER) of 1.48 and 1.58 h, respectively. RES(AGL) 
bioavailability was 38% and its exposure was approximately 46-fold lower than 
that of RES(GLU) (AUC(inf), 7.1 versus 324.7 micromol.h/l). Enterohepatic 
recirculation was confirmed in the linked-rat model since significant plasma 
concentrations of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) were observed in bile-recipient rats at 
4 to 8 h. The percentages of the exposures of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) that were 
due to enterohepatic recirculation were 24.7 and 24.0%, respectively. The 
fraction of drug excreted in the urine over a period of 12 h was negligible. 
These results confirm that RES(AGL) is bioavailable and undergoes extensive 
first-pass glucuronidation, and that enterohepatic recirculation contributes 
significantly to the exposure of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) in rats.

Sweet peppers (Capsicum annuum L.) cv. Vergasa have been studied at four 
maturity stages (immature green, green, immature red, and red). The individual 
phenolics (hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids), vitamin C (ascorbic acid and 
dehydroascorbic acid), and individual carotenoids were characterized and 
quantified. Five hydroxycinnamic derivatives and 23 flavonoids were 
characterized and quantified from the pericarp of sweet pepper by 
high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray 
ionization-mass spectrometry. Identification was carried out by their UV 
spectra, chromatographic comparisons with authentic markers, identification of 
hydrolysis products, and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Hydroxycinnamic 
derivatives, O-glycosides of quercetin, luteolin, and chrysoeriol, and a large 
number of C-glycosyl flavones have been characterized. Some of these compounds 
were found for the first time in nature. Clear differences in the individual and 
total phenolic content were detected between the different maturity stages. 
Immature green pepper had a very high phenolic content while green, immature 
red, and red ripe peppers showed a 4-5-fold reduction. Ascorbic acid was the 
main form of vitamin C, and its content increased as the pepper reached 
maturity. The red ripe stage had a relevant impact on the carotenoids content. 
Thus, immature green peppers showed the highest content of polyphenols, while 
red ripe fruits had the highest content of vitamin C and provitamin A.

The phloretin-O-glycosides, phloretin-2'-O-glucoside and 
phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside, are thought to be unique to apples and 
apple products. To investigate the metabolism and bioavailability of these 
compounds, nine healthy and five ileostomy human subjects consumed 500 mL of 
Thatchers Redstreak apple cider containing 46 micromol of 
phloretin-O-glycosides. Over the ensuing 24 h period, plasma, urine, and ileal 
fluid were collected prior to analysis by high-performance liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The sole metabolite present in 
quantifiable amounts in plasma was phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, which reached a 
peak concentration (C(max)) of 73 nmol/L and 0.6 h after ingestion (T(max)) with 
the healthy subjects, and statistically similar values were obtained with the 
ileostomy volunteers. Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide was also detected in urine 
along with two additional phloretin-O-glucuronides and a 
phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate. The quantity of phloretin metabolites 
excreted in urine represented 5.0 + or - 0.9% of intake in healthy volunteers 
and 5.5 + or - 0.6% in ileostomy volunteers. The similarity in the excretion 
levels of the two groups and the rapid plasma T(max) indicate absorption of the 
dihydrochalcones in the small intestine. Of the two major phloretin-O-glycosides 
in cider, only phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside was recovered in ileal 
fluid in quantities corresponding to 22% of intake. The absence of 
phloretin-2'-O-glucoside in ileal fluid suggests that it is more readily 
absorbed than phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside. 
Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, two other phloretin-O-glucuronides, one 
phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate, two phloretin-O-sulfates, and the aglycone 
phloretin were also detected in the ileal fluid. This implies that the wall of 
the small intestine contains beta-glycosidase, sulfuryltransferase, and 
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities and that, as well as being absorbed, 
sizable amounts of the phloretin metabolites that are formed efflux back into 
the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. The overall recovery of the 
dihydrochalcones and their metabolites in the ileal fluid was equivalent to 
38.6% of intake.

The present study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of three different grapefruit 
flavanone forms in dog plasma and demonstrated their absorption after an oral 
intake of a grapefruit extract; pharmacokinetic parameters of these forms were 
also determined. Ten healthy beagles were administered 70 mg citrus flavonoids 
as a grapefruit extract contained in capsules, while two additional dogs were 
used as controls and given an excipient. The grapefruit flavanone naringin, 
along with its metabolites naringenin and naringenin glucuronide, was detected 
in dog plasma. Blood samples were collected between 0 and 24 h after 
administration of the extract. Naringin reached its maximun plasma concentration 
at around 80 min, whereas naringenin and naringenin glucuronide reached their 
maximun plasma concentrations at around 20 and 30 min, respectively. Maximum 
plasma concentrations of naringin, naringenin and naringenin glucuronide 
(medians and ranges) were 0.24 (0.05-2.08), 0.021 (0.001-0.3) and 0.09 
(0.034-0.12) micromol/l, respectively. The areas under the curves were 23.16 l 
(14.04-70.62) min x micromol/for nariningin, 1.78 (0.09-4.95) min x micromol/l 
for naringenin and 22.5 (2.74-99.23) min x micromol/l for naringenin 
glucuronide. The median and range values for mean residence time were 3.3 
(1.5-9.3), 2.8 (0.8-11.2) and 8.0 (2.3-13.1) h for naringin, naringenin and 
naringenin glucuronide, respectively. The results of the present study 
demonstrate the absorption of grapefruit flavanones via the presence of their 
metabolites in plasma, thus making an important contribution to the field since 
the biological activities ascribed to these compounds rely on their specific 
forms of absorption.

The present study evaluates for the first time in dogs, the kinetics of green 
tea catechins and their metabolic forms in plasma and urine. Ten beagles were 
administered 173 mg (12.35 mg/kg body weight) of catechins as a green tea 
extract, in capsules. Blood samples were collected during 24 h after intake and 
urine samples were collected during the following periods of time: 0-2, 2-6, 6-8 
and 8-24 h. Two catechins with a galloyl moiety and three conjugated metabolites 
were detected in plasma. Most of the detected forms in plasma reached their 
maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) at around 1 h. Median Cmax for ( - 
)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), ( - )-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), ( - 
)-epigallocatechin glucuronide (EGC-glucuronide), ( - )-epicatechin glucuronide 
(EC-glucuronide), ( - )-epicatechin sulphate (EC-sulphate) were 0.3 (range 
0.1-1.9), 0.1 (range 0-0.4), 0.8 (range 0.2-3.9), 0.2 (range 0.1-1.7) and 1 
(range 0.3-3.4) micromol/l, respectively. The areas under the plasma 
concentration v. time curves (AUC0 --> 24) were 427 (range 102-1185) micromol/l 
x min for EGC-glucuronide, 112 (range 53-919) micromol/l x min for EC-sulphate, 
71 (range 26-306) micromol/l x min for EGCG, 40 (range 12-258) micromol/l x min 
for EC-glucuronide and 14 (range 0.1-124) micromol/l x min for ECG. The values 
of mean residence time (MRT0 --> 24) were 5 (range 2-16), 2 (range 1-11), 10 
(range 2-13), 3 (range 2-16) and 2.4 (range 1-18) h for EGCG, ECG, 
EGC-glucuronide, EC-glucuronide and EC-sulphate, respectively. In urine, 
catechins were present as conjugated forms, suggesting bile excretion of EGCG 
and ECG. Green tea catechins are absorbed following an oral administration and 
EGC-glucuronide is the metabolic form that remains in the organism for a longer 
period of time, suggesting that this compound could suffer an enterohepatic 
cycle.

To study the potential hepatic metabolism of olive oil phenols, human hepatoma 
HepG2 cells were incubated for 2 and 18 h with hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and 
hydroxytyrosyl acetate, three phenolic constituents of olive oil. After 
incubation, culture media and cell lysates were hydrolyzed with 
beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase and analyzed by LC-MS. In vitro methylation, 
glucuronidation, and sulfation of pure phenols were also performed. Methylated 
and glucuronidated forms of hydroxytyrosol were detected at 18 h of incubation, 
together with methylglucuronidated metabolites. Hydroxytyrosyl acetate was 
largely converted into free hydroxytyrosol and subsequently metabolized, yet 
small amounts of glucuronidated hydroxytyrosyl acetate were detected. Tyrosol 
was poorly metabolized, with <10% of the phenol glucuronidated after 18 h. Minor 
amounts of free or conjugated phenols were detected in cell lysates. No sulfated 
metabolites were found. In conclusion, olive oil phenols can be metabolized by 
the liver as suggested by the results obtained using HepG2 cells as a hepatic 
model system.

Four cultivars (Bronowicka Ostra, Cyklon, Tornado, and Tajfun) of pepper fruit 
Capsicum annuum L. were studied for phenolics contents and antioxidant activity. 
Two fractions of phenolics, flavonoids (with phenolic acids) and capsaicinoids, 
were isolated from the pericarp of pepper fruit at two growth stages (green and 
red) and were studied for their antioxidant capacity. Both fractions from red 
fruits had higher activities than those from green fruits. A comparison of the 
capsaicinoid fraction with the flavonoid and phenolic acid fraction from red 
fruit with respect to their antioxidant activity gave similar results. Phenolic 
compounds were separated and quantified by LC and HPLC. Contents of nine 
compounds were determined in the flavonoid and phenolic acid fraction: 
trans-p-feruloyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, 
trans-p-sinapoyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, quercetin 
3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside-7-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside, trans-p-ferulyl 
alcohol-4-O-[6-(2-methyl-3-hydroxypropionyl] glucopyranoside, luteolin 
6-C-beta-d-glucopyranoside-8-C-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside, apigenin 
6-C-beta-d-glucopyranoside-8-C-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside, lutoeolin 
7-O-[2-(beta-d-apiofuranosyl)-beta-d-glucopyranoside], quercetin 
3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside, and luteolin 
7-O-[2-(beta-d-apiofuranosyl)-4-(beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-6-malonyl]-beta-d-glucopyranoside. 
The main compounds of this fraction isolated from red pepper were sinapoyl and 
feruloyl glycosides, and the main compound from green pepper was 
quercetin-3-O-l-rhamnoside. Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were the main 
components of the capsaicinoid fraction. A high correlation was found between 
the content of these compounds and the antioxidant activity of both fractions. 
Their antioxidant activities were elucidated by heat-induced oxidation in the 
beta-carotene-linoleic acid system and the antiradical activity by the 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) decoloration test. The highest antioxidant 
activity in the beta-carotene-linoleic acid system was found for 
trans-p-sinapoyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, which was lower than the activity of 
free sinapic acid. Quercetin 3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside had the highest 
antiradical activity in the DPPH system, which was comparable to the activity of 
quercetin. The activities of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were similar to that 
of trans-p-feruloyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside in the DPPH model system.

Garnacha Tintorera (also known as Alicante Bouschet) is one of the few V. 
vinifera grape cultivars with red-colored berry flesh. The study of the phenolic 
composition of both berry flesh and skin of Garnacha Tintorera grapes shows 
interesting findings. Anthocyanins were asymmetrically distributed within grape 
flesh and skins. Malvidin derivatives dominated in skin, followed by 
peonidin-type anthocyanins; in contrast, the flesh almost exclusively contained 
peonidin 3-glucoside. In addition, LC-UV-vis and LC-MS evidence suggest the 
presence of small amounts of peonidin 3,5-diglucoside and a second peonidin 
dihexoside derivative, and, very likely, the first report of the occurrence of 
pelargonidin 3-glucoside and its acetyl and p-coumaroyl derivatives in V. 
vinifera grapes. Flavonols also occurred in the flesh of Garnacha Tintorera 
grapes, but its flavonol profile showed lower contribution of trisubstituted 
flavonoid structures (myricetin, laricitrin, and syringetin) when compared to 
that of skin. The skin of Garnacha Tintorera grapes contained hydroxycinnamic 
acids in higher amounts than in flesh, caftaric acid being the main derivative 
found, and coutaric acid accounting for its highest proportion in the skin. The 
phenolic composition of the whole grape berries reflected the average of the 
differences described for the two aforementioned berry parts, and subsequently, 
the red wines made from these grapes had a phenolic composition closer to that 
shown by the whole berries. The formation of anthocyanin-derived pigments in 
Garnacha Tintorera red wines makes necessary the use of LC-MS for detecting the 
minor pelargonidin-based anthocyanins and peonidin dihexoside, which could be 
suggested as chemical markers for cultivar authentication of this grape cultivar 
and its wines.

A method using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous analysis of nine 
chlorogenic acids (CGAs), three isomers each of caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs), 
feruloylquinic acids (FQAs) and dicaffeoylquinic acids (dCQAs), and their two 
metabolites, caffeic acid (CA) and ferulic acid (FA), in human plasma. In 
simultaneous multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) measurements using ESI-MS/MS 
with a negative ion mode, a deprotonated molecular ion derived from each of the 
11 molecules was used as a precursor ion while three diagnostic product ions 
characteristic for each were selected for the qualitative analysis. To obtain 
maximal intensities for all diagnostic product ions, the collision energy was 
optimized for each one. LC separation was achieved under conditions of a 
reversed-phase Inertsil ODS-2 column combined with a gradient elution system 
using 50mM acetic acid with 3% acetonitrile aqueous solution and 50 mM acetic 
acid with 100% acetonitrile. In the quantitative analysis, one of the three 
diagnostic product ions for each of the 11 molecules was selected. Application 
of simultaneous LC-ESI-MS/MS MRM measurements to analyze the 11 standards spiked 
into blank human plasma indicated that all diagnostic product ions were detected 
without any interference, and that the sensitivity, linearity and recovery of 
this method were acceptable. When using this method to analyze those 11 
molecules in the plasma after oral ingestion of 250 ml of a drink containing a 
green coffee bean extract (300 mg CGAs), all 11 molecules were identified and 
CQAs, FQAs and FA were quantified. CQAs, FQAs and dCQAs in human plasma were 
detected for the first time. This method should be useful to understand the 
biological and pharmacological effects of CGAs, such as improvement of human 
hypertension.

Hesperidin is a biologically effective flavonoid. Several studies have reported 
that dietary hesperidin was converted to conjugated metabolites, such as 
hesperetin-glucuronides and sulfoglucuronides, during absorption and metabolism. 
However, the chemical structures of the conjugated metabolites, especially the 
sites of glucuronidation and sulfoglucuronidation in plasma, were unconfirmed. 
Therefore, the concentrations of the metabolites conjugated at various sites in 
plasma could not be individually quantified. In the present study, we identified 
the chemical structures and concentrations of the major conjugated metabolites 
in rat plasma after oral administration of hesperidin. Two 
hesperetin-glucuronides were prepared and identified as 
hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Using 
these authentic compounds, the concentrations of 
hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide in rat 
plasma were individually determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
In rat plasma, hesperetin-glucuronides were primarily comprised of 
hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. The 
concentration of hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide was slightly higher than that 
of hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Furthermore, not only hesperetin 
conjugates but also homoeriodictyol conjugates were observed in rat plasma. The 
present study is the first report elucidating the chemical structures and 
changes in individual concentrations in rat plasma of glucuronides derived from 
orally administered hesperidin.

Anthocyanins (ACs) are phenolic compounds that are distributed widely in fruits 
and vegetables. Although consumption of these compounds has been shown to 
improve visual function, the distribution of ACs in ocular tissue has not been 
examined in detail. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the ocular 
distribution of blackcurrant anthocyanins (BCAs) in rats and rabbits after oral, 
intravenous (i.v.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration. Identification and 
quantification of ACs were carried out using high-performance liquid 
chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) and 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV-visible detection, 
respectively. BCAs were identified in the plasma and whole eye after oral and 
i.p. administration in rats. No other peaks were detected in either plasma or 
ocular tissues after administration when the absorbance of the eluate was 
monitored at 520 nm. This finding indicates that intact forms of ACs were 
present in rats after administration of BCA. In rats given i.p. administration, 
the concentration of total ACs in the whole eye and some ocular tissues was 
higher than that measured in plasma. These results suggested that ACs detected 
in the ocular tissues were not due to residual blood. Following i.v. 
administration in rabbits, four ACs were identified in the plasma and several 
ocular tissues including the aqueous humor, cornea, sclera, choroid, ciliary 
body, iris and retina. A small amount of ACs was also detected in the vitreous 
and lens. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that BCAs were absorbed and 
distributed in ocular tissues as intact forms. Our data show clearly that intact 
forms of BCAs pass thorough the blood-aqueous barrier and blood-retinal barrier 
in both rats and rabbits.

A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with diode-array 
detection (DAD) was used to identify and quantify free and total phenolic acids 
(m-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, gallic acid, 
vanillic acid, syringic acid, o-coumaric acid, m-coumaric acid, p-coumaric acid, 
caffeic acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, chlorogenic acid, and ellagic acid) in 
plant foods. Free phenolic acids were extracted with a mixture of methanol and 
10% acetic acid. Bound phenolic acids were liberated using first alkaline and 
then acid hydrolysis followed by extraction with diethyl ether/ethyl acetate 
(1:1). All fractions were quantified separately by HPLC. After HPLC 
quantification, results of alkali and acid hydrolysates were calculated to 
represent total phenolic acids. Ellagic acid was quantified separately after 
long (20 h) acid hydrolysis. The methods developed were effective for the 
determination of phenolic acids in plant foods. DAD response was linear for all 
phenolic acids within the ranges evaluated, with correlation coefficients 
exceeding 0.999. Coefficients of variation for 4-8 sample replicates were 
consistently below 10%. Recovery tests of phenolic acids were performed for 
every hydrolysis condition using several samples. Recoveries were generally good 
(mean >90%) with the exceptions of gallic acid and, in some cases, caffeic acid 
samples.

The contents of free and total phenolic acids and alk(en)ylresorcinols were 
analyzed in commercial products of eight grains: oat (Avena sativa), wheat 
(Triticum spp.), rye (Secale cerale), barley (Hordeum vulgare), buckwheat 
(Fagopyrum esculentum), millet (Panicum miliaceum), rice (Oryza sativa), and 
corn (Zea mays). Avenanthramides were determined in three oat products. Free 
phenolic acids, alk(en)ylresorcinols, and avenanthramides were extracted with 
methanolic acetic acid, 100% methanol, and 80% methanol, respectively, and 
quantified by HPLC. The contents of total phenolic acids were quantified by HPLC 
analysis after alkaline and acid hydrolyses. The highest contents of total 
phenolic acids were in brans of wheat (4527 mg/kg) and rye (4190 mg/kg) and in 
whole-grain flours of these grains (1342 and 1366 mg/kg, respectively). In other 
products, the contents varied from 111 mg/kg (white wheat bread) to 765 mg/kg 
(whole-grain rye bread). Common phenolic acids found in the grain products were 
ferulic acid (most abundant), ferulic acid dehydrodimers, sinapic acid, and 
p-coumaric acid. The grain products were found to contain either none or only 
low amounts of free phenolic acids. The content of avenanthramides in oat flakes 
(26-27 mg/kg) was about double that found in oat bran (13 mg/kg). The highest 
contents of alk(en)ylresorcinols were observed in brans of rye (4108 mg/kg) and 
wheat (3225 mg/kg). In addition, whole-grain rye products (rye bread, rye flour, 
and whole-wheat flour) contained considerable levels of alk(en)ylresorcinols 
(524, 927, and 759 mg/kg, respectively).

European cereal-based fermented foods (ECBFFs) and alcoholic beverages have been 
fundamental components of regional diets for centuries, providing unique flavor 
profiles, essential nutrients, and a diverse array of health benefits. These 
foods, which encompass breads, beverages, and porridges, derive their functional 
and culinary properties from the activity of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts. 
This review examines the nutritional and functional characteristics of ECBFFs, 
with a focus on their microbial composition and fermentation processes. It 
highlights various ECBFFs and alcoholic beverages, including conventional and 
sourdough breads, tarhana, boza, kvass, and beers examining their 
health-promoting properties and potential for commercial expansion. Key findings 
from the literature show that certain ECBFFs are abundant in prebiotics and 
probiotics, primarily due to the fermentation processes involving lactic acid 
bacteria and yeasts. These microorganisms generate bioactive compounds such as 
organic acids, bacteriocins, and phenolic compounds, which exhibit 
antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. ECBFFs can also 
enhance digestibility, improve mineral bioavailability, and support gut health, 
thereby promoting overall well-being. From a commercial perspective, products 
like Yosa and Proviva demonstrate the feasibility of developing innovative 
ECBFFs that align with contemporary dietary preferences. The future of ECBFFs is 
promising, offering extensive opportunities for research, innovation, and 
large-scale commercialization to meet the increasing consumer demand for 
functional, plant-based foods.

Total phenolic compounds (TPC) and the chlorogenic acids content of potato 
by-product extracts of two hydro alcoholic solvents (methanol, ethanol) and two 
extraction methods (maceration and heating-assisted extraction) were studied. 
The content of TPC in the extracts was determined spectrometrically according to 
the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure and calculated as chlorogenic acid equivalents. 
Soluble phenolic acids, especially the chlorogenic acids, were performed by 
HPLC. The antioxidant activity of potato by-product extracts was determined by 
using the total oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. The highest 
content of TPC was found in raw and lyophilized red waters when using ethanol as 
a solvent around 57 mg/g fresh weight. Heating-assisted extraction enhances this 
quantitative increasing. At the given operating conditions, unpeeled potato 
samples exhibit a higher TPC than peeled ones, showing that TPC are accumulated 
in skin tissue. The greatest amount of chlorogenic acid (Caffeoyl-Quinic Acids, 
3, 4, 5 CQA), mainly the 5-CQA (870 ± 39.66 µg/g WM for wet matter versus DM dry 
matter), was obtained in the pellets and lyophilized fresh peels (skin vs. 
flesh). In addition, the greatest amounts of chlorogenic acids were found when 
potato peels were extracted with methanol. Heating-assisted extraction improved 
the chlorogenic acid concentration of the potato peel extracts. The total ORAC 
amounts recorded in the different potato fractions varied between 1500 and 1650 
µM TE/g. They were higher than those of some fruits, vegetables, nuts, cereals, 
and sweet potato cultivar. The good correlation coefficient found between TPC, 
chlorogenic acids determination, and the ORAC capacity indicates that the TPC 
can be used as a good indicator of the antioxidant capacity of potato 
by-products.

Flavonoids continue to attract wide attention as possible very useful agents for 
combating free radical pathologies, i.e. the pathological states associated with 
free radical overproduction. Commonly used methods for the analysis of plant 
flavonoids include high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary 
electrophoresis (CE). On the other hand, the soft-ionization approach based on 
electrospray ionization (ESI-MS) permits highly selective analysis of complex 
matrices. In this work, we examined firstly the ESI-MS behaviour of 
representative aglycones and glycosides of flavonols, flavones and isoflavones 
with the aim of suggesting a possible relationship between structure and mass 
spectra. Using HPLC coupled to a diode array detector (DAD) for on-line UV 
spectra acquisition, and in parallel to ESI-MS for mass spectra (LC/DAD-ESI-MS), 
we have developed methodology to observe flavonols directly in tomato puree 
extract. In this way, it has been possible to detect intact flavonol glycosides 
in tomato extracts and to characterize a flavonol trisaccharide. For the first 
time, using LC/ESI-MS, it has been possible to detect intact flavonol glycosides 
in plasma of healthy volunteers and to provide further evidence on the 
absorption of flavonoid glycosides after consumption of common vegetables like 
tomatoes.

We present a method for the quantitative determination of the phytoestrogens 
formononetin, biochanin A, daidzein, genistein, and coumestrol and 
simultaneously the lignans secoisolariciresinol (SECO) and matairesinol in 
plant-derived foods. These compounds are measured by isotope dilution gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring mode 
(ID/GC/MS/SIM) using synthesized deuterated internal standards for the 
correction of losses during the procedure. A three-step hydrolysis--a 
rehydration with distilled H2O, followed by enzymatic and acid hydrolysis--has 
been applied in order to convert the diphenolic glycosides into their respective 
aglycones. Purification and separation are carried out in two ion-exchange 
chromatographic steps followed by derivatization and GC-MS. The within-assay 
imprecision values vary 3.1-9.6% and the between-assay imprecision 7.0-21.2%. 
The mean recovery of authentic standards processed through the whole procedure 
varied from 95.5 to 105.5%. Values for some different food samples are 
presented. The simultaneous determination of the biologically most interesting 
phytoestrogens and lignans in foods has not been carried out previously and the 
method will be useful for screening of important foods in populations with 
different risk of cancer and coronary heart disease, and for metabolic studies.

Tea is a beverage consumed widely throughout the world. The existence in tea of 
chemopreventing compounds possessing antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic and 
antioxidative properties has been reported. High intakes of tea and foods 
containing flavonoids have recently been shown to be negatively correlated to 
the occurrence of CHD. However, tea may contain other compounds with similar 
activities. Using a new gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method we 
measured lignans and isoflavonoids in samples of twenty commercial teas (black, 
green and red varieties) and, for comparison, six coffees. Both unbrewed and 
brewed tea were investigated. The analysis of the teas yielded relatively high 
levels of the lignans secoisolariciresinol (5.6-28.9 mg/kg; 15.9-81.9 mumol/kg) 
and matairesinol (0.56-4.13 mg/kg; 1.6-11.5 mumol/kg) but only low levels of 
isoflavonoids. Because the plant lignans, as well as their mammalian metabolites 
enterolactone and enterodiol, have antioxidative properties and these mammalian 
lignans occur in high concentrations in plasma, we hypothesize that lignan 
polyphenols may contribute to the protective effect of tea on CHD.

Gradient reversed-phase HPLC was used to obtain quantitative estimates of the 
levels of free and conjugated myricetin and quercetin in 65 red wines from 
Italy, Chile, France, California, Australia, Bulgaria, Spain, Romania, New 
Zealand, Brazil, Morocco, and Hungary. The concentrations of total flavonols 
ranged from 4.6 to 41.6 mg L(-1). High total flavonol levels appear to be 
associated with the use of thick-skinned grape varieties, such as Cabernet 
Sauvignon, with a high skin:volume ratio, which were left to ripen fully in 
sunny conditions before harvest and which were extracted efficiently by modern 
methods of vinification. Some Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon wines contained up to 
40 mg of total flavonols L(-1), which was higher than the levels detected in 
Cabernet Sauvignon from France, California, and Australia. The flavonol content 
of 1989 and 1990 Cabernet Sauvignon from Bulgaria was <6 mg L(-1). Chilean 
Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Pinot Noir all contained consistently higher 
concentrations of flavonols than their counterparts from different geographical 
regions.

Aims. To assess the possible effect of polyphenol-rich olive extracts on lipid 
metabolism in medaka fish by quantifying the expression of lipogenic and 
lipolytic genes. Materials and methods. Adult medaka fish were maintained in 
tanks for five days with five extracts at 0.01% in water, causing obesity 
through a diet rich in carbohydrates, with a control group maintained in water 
with a normal diet. The extracts contained polyphenols ranging between 7 and 116 
mg/g (oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol) with an antioxidant power of 2-13 mmol of 
2,4,6-tri(2-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine/100 g. After five days, the fish were 
sacrificed and the hepatic mRNA and its complementary DNA were extracted by 
reverse transcription. Complementary DNAs were quantified for three lipolytic 
and three lipogenic genes by real-time PCR. The relative gene expression was 
calculated from the amplification curves in reference to the control group. 
Results. The expression of genes involved in lipolysis, including peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor-±, acyl-CoA oxidase 1, and carnitine 
palmitoyltransferase 1, were clearly decreased in fish subjected to an 
obesogenic diet, and this situation could not be reversed in fish maintained 
with polyphenol-rich extracts. In contrast, lipogenic fatty acid synthase, 
acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 genes 
increased considerably with the obesogenic diet and reverted to the normal state 
with the olive extracts. The effect was not dependent on the total polyphenol 
content, the specific oleuropein or hydroxytyrosol concentration, or the 
antioxidant power, suggesting a synergistic effect. Conclusion. Olive 
polyphenols, acting as anti-lipogenic agents, have a positive effect on lipid 
metabolism, but their mechanism in each gene is different according to the 
extract, which supports synergistic mechanisms with the different proportions of 
polyphenols and accompanying phytochemicals in each extract.

Anthocyanins, the red/blue pigments found in plants, are polyphenolic compounds 
consumed by humans and are part of a normal diet. Recent studies have shown that 
anthocyanins have substantial bioactivity including antioxidant activity and 
therefore may have beneficial effects on human health. Anthocyanins are a group 
of over 500 compounds of diverse structures containing different core phenolic 
aglycons and conjugated with sugars in a variety of glycosylation patterns. In 
this study, we have investigated the bioabsorption of 15 anthocyanins with 
structures containing different aglycons and conjugated sugars extracted from 
blueberry, boysenberry, black raspberry, and blackcurrant in both humans and 
rats. Intact and unmetabolized anthocyanins were detected in urine of rats and 
humans following dosing for all molecular structures investigated, thus 
demonstrating that anthocyanins with diverse molecular structure and from 
different dietary sources are bioavailable at diet relevant dosage rates. In 
addition, the relative concentrations of anthocyanins detected in urine 
following dosing varied, indicating that differences in bioavailability are due 
to variations in chemical structure. Our results suggest that the nature of the 
sugar conjugate and the phenolic aglycon are both important determinants of 
anthocyanin absorption and excretion in rats and humans.

An accurate quantification of phenolic compounds present in several kind of 
craft beers, corresponding worts, ingredients and spent products was performed 
by LC-MS/MS in this study. The dilution 1:2 of the sample with the mobile phase 
gave the best results, offering a very fast and simple method to reduce the 
matrix effect. A validated method was applied to six different types of craft 
beers, their worts, starting and spent products, such as barley malts and barley 
husks, starting hops and spent hops, and finally, starting yeast and spent 
yeasts to quantify the selected phenolic compounds. The Total Phenol Content 
(TPC) of barley malts is not negligible and it results almost prevalently due to 
trans-p-coumaric acid, which ranges from 76.4 μg/Kg for Mais to 672.6 μg/Kg for 
Munich. The trans-p-coumaric acid is transferred to the worts during the must 
preparation and is responsible for the not negligible TPC of worts, that was 
between 131.1 μg/Kg for Ego to 2041.6 μg/Kg for Alter beer. Bitter acids and 
prenylflavonoids are mainly present in the starting hops (TPC 323.8 μg/Kg and 
TPC 500.3 for Saaz and Perle hops, respectively). Their concentration strongly 
decreases in the spent hops where the TPC ranges between 8.0 μg/Kg for Triplo 
Malto to 24.4 μg/Kg for Alter, suggesting that they are transferred to the 
intermediate of production. Phenolic compounds, originally present in the 
starting barley malts and hops, are limitedly present into the final beers, and 
their TPC ranges approximately from 65.6 μg/Kg for Fiat lux to 105.3 μg/Kg for 
Alter. Actually, most phenolic compounds are absorbed into the yeast added for 
the fermentation, as it is clearly evident from the observation that spent 
yeasts contain a higher phenolic compounds amount with the respect to the 
starting yeast, and several phenolic compounds, in particular those coming from 
hops, are originally absent into the yeast and are only present in the spent 
ones.

The antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. In 
vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal 
action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in 
general against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, olive oils 
showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal 
microbiota (Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli) also against 
beneficial microorganisms such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium 
bifidum. Otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (Listeria 
monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia sp., and 
Shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. The 
dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, 
hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the phenolic compounds that statistically 
correlated with bacterial survival. These findings were confirmed by testing 
each individual phenolic compound, isolated by HPLC, against L. monocytogenes. 
In particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon 
showed a potent antimicrobial activity. These results indicate that not all oils 
classified as ""olive oil"" had similar bactericidal effects and that this 
bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.

The possible beneficial effects of tea consumption have attracted a great deal 
of attention. Many of the biological effects have been attributed to tea 
catechins, but the metabolic fate of these compounds is not clear. In the 
present study, a major metabolite observed in human blood and urine samples 
after green tea administration was identified as a O-methylated derivative of 
(-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) by comparison with products from chemical and 
enzymatic O-methylation of EGC. The structure of this metabolite was elucidated 
as 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epigallocatechin (4'-O-MeEGC) by (1)H and (13)C NMR and 
heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity experiment. The human plasma level of 
4'-O-MeEGC reached its peak value within the first 2 h following tea ingestion. 
Its maximum concentration was 4 to 6 times higher than that of EGC. The 
half-lives of EGC and 4'-O-MeEGC in the blood were 1.02 +/- 0.07 and 4.39 +/- 
1.14 h, respectively. The amount of 4'-O-MeEGC excreted in urine was about 3 
times higher than that of EGC, and 88% of 4'-O-MeEGC was excreted in urine 
within 8 h. The present structural information and concentration-time profile of 
this metabolite provide the basis for understanding the biotransformation of EGC 
and for future elucidation of its biological activities.

(-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant tea catechin, has been 
proposed to be beneficial to human health based on its strong antioxidative and 
other biological activities in vitro. Inadequate knowledge regarding the 
bioavailability and biotransformation of EGCG in humans, however, has limited 
our understanding of its possible beneficial health effects. In this study, 
4',4' '-di-O-methyl-EGCG (4',4' '-DiMeEGCG) was detected in human plasma and 
urine by LC/MS/MS following green tea ingestion. Both 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and EGCG 
reached peak plasma values (20.5 +/- 7.7 and 145.4 +/- 31.6 nM, respectively, in 
4 subjects) at 2 h after the dose. The half-lives of 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and EGCG 
were 4.1 +/- 0.8 and 2.7 +/- 0.9 h, respectively. The cumulative urinary 
excretion of 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG during a 24 h period was 140.3 +/- 48.6 microg, 
about 5-fold higher than that of EGCG, but the excreted 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and 
EGCG in urine only accounted for about 0.1% of ingested EGCG. 
(-)-5-(3',4',5'-Trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4) and 
(-)-5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6), along with another 
possible ring-fission metabolite, 
(-)-5-(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6'), were detected in human 
urine after green tea ingestion. The cumulative excretion of M4, M6', and M6 
during a 24 h period ranged from 75 microg to 1.2 mg, 0.6 to 6 mg, and 0.6 to 10 
mg, respectively. The combined excretion of all three ring-fission metabolites 
accounted for 1.5-16% of ingested catechins. M4, M6', and M6 were all observed 
after the ingestion of pure EGCG or EGC by human subjects, whereas only M6 was 
produced after EC ingestion. These metabolites as well as monomethylated EGCG 
were detected in mice and rats after tea or EGCG administration, and the tissue 
levels reflected the rather low bioavailability of EGCG in rats. The presently 
characterized methylated EGCG metabolites and ring-fission products exist in 
substantial quantities and may contribute to the biological activities of tea.

The present study investigates the bioavailability of resveratrol and quercetin 
in humans, mice, and rats after oral ingestion of grape juice preparations or 
pure aglycones. Oral administration of resveratrol and quercetin to humans 
yielded detectable levels of resveratrol, quercetin, and their derivatives in 
the plasma and urine. Urinary levels of resveratrol, quercetin, and their 
metabolites were observed in human subjects receiving 600 and 1200 mL of grape 
juice, whereas quercetin metabolites were identified in urine samples even after 
receiving 200 mL of grape juice. The cumulative amounts of resveratrol and 
quercetin excreted in the urine of mice receiving concentrated grape juice for 4 
days were 2.3 and 0.7% of the ingested doses, respectively. After i.g. 
administration of resveratrol to rats (2 mg/kg), up to 1.2 microM resveratrol 
was observed in the plasma. The study demonstrates that the glycoside forms of 
resveratrol and quercetin in grape juice are absorbed to a lesser extent than 
the aglycones.

Estimation of dietary intake of polyphenols is difficult, due to limited 
availability of food composition data and bias inherent to dietary assessment 
methods. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the associations between 
the intake of polyphenol-rich foods and the urinary excretion of several 
phenolic compounds and therefore explore whether these phenolic compounds could 
be used as a biomarker of intake. Fifty-three participants of the SU.VI.MAX 
study (a randomised primary-prevention trial evaluating the effect of daily 
antioxidant supplementation on chronic diseases) collected a 24 h urine and a 
spot urine sample and filled a dietary record during a 2 d period. Thirteen 
polyphenols and metabolites, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, m-coumaric acid, 
gallic acid, 4-O-methylgallic acid, quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, 
hesperetin, naringenin, phloretin, enterolactone and enterodiol, were measured 
using HPLC-electrospray ionisation-MS-MS. In spot samples apple consumption was 
positively correlated to phloretin, grapefruit consumption to naringenin, orange 
to hesperetin, citrus fruit consumption to both naringenin and hesperetin, with 
r coefficients ranging from 0.31 to 0.57 (P < 0.05). The combination of fruits 
and/or fruit juices was positively correlated to gallic acid and 
4-O-methylgallic acid, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, hesperetin, naringenin and 
phloretin (r 0.24-0.44, P < 0.05). Coffee consumption was positively correlated 
to caffeic and chlorogenic acids (r 0.29 and 0.63, P < 0.05 respectively). Black 
tea and wine consumption were positively correlated with gallic and 
4-O-methylgallic acids (r 0.37-0.54, P < 0.001). The present results suggest 
that several polyphenols measured in a spot urine sample can be used as 
biomarkers of polyphenol-rich food intake.

OBJECTIVE: Estimation of dietary intake of polyphenols is difficult, due to 
limited availability of food composition data and bias inherent to dietary 
assessment methods. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether we 
could detect polyphenols and their metabolites in a spot urine sample in a 
free-living human population and whether it was related to those observed in 
24-h urine samples, for potential use as a biomarkers of polyphenol intake.
SUBJECTS: Four 24-h urine samples and two spot urine samples were collected from 
154 participants of the SU.VI.MAX cohort (a randomized primary-prevention trial 
evaluating the effect of daily antioxidant supplementation on chronic diseases) 
in two separate studies over, respectively, a 7- and 2-day periods. Thirteen 
polyphenols and metabolites (chlorogenic acid (CGA), caffeic acid (CA), 
m-coumaric acid (mCOU), gallic acid (GA), 4-O-methylgallic acid (MeGA), 
quercetin (Q), isorhamnetin (MeQ), kaempferol (K), hesperetin (HESP), naringenin 
(NAR), phloretin (PHLOR), enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) were measured 
using HPLC-ESI-MS-MS.
RESULTS: Correlations between the urinary excretion levels were observed. The 
most significant were explained by metabolic filiations (CGA/CA, CA/mCOU, 
GA/MeGA, Q/MeQ, NAR/PHLOR, ENL/END) or co-occurrence in a same food source 
(NAR/HESP). Concentrations in spot samples correlated with those in 24-h urine 
sample (P<0.02, except for CA and for MeQ). Intra-individual variations were 
smaller than inter-individual variations for all polyphenols (P<0.01) except for 
MeGA and for PHLOR.
CONCLUSION: These results show that these polyphenols and metabolites are useful 
biomarkers for polyphenol intake.

The intake of polyphenols has been demonstrated to have health-promoting and 
disease-preventive effects. The pomegranate (Punica granatum L.), which is rich 
in several polyphenols, has been used for centuries in ancient cultures for its 
medicinal purposes. The potential health benefits of pomegranate polyphenols 
have been demonstrated in numerous in vitro studies and in vivo experiments. 
This study investigated the absorption and antioxidant effects of a standardized 
extract from pomegranate in healthy human volunteers after the acute consumption 
of 800 mg of extract. Results indicate that ellagic acid (EA) from the extract 
is bioavailable, with an observed C(max) of 33 ng/mL at t(max) of 1 h. The 
plasma metabolites urolithin A, urolithin B, hydroxyl-urolithin A, urolithin 
A-glucuronide, and dimethyl ellagic acid-glucuronide were identified by HPLC-MS. 
The antioxidant capacity measured with the oxygen radical absorbance capacity 
(ORAC) assay was increased with a maximum effect of 32% after 0.5 h, whereas the 
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was not affected. The inflammation 
marker interleukin-6 (IL-6) was not significantly affected after 4 h after the 
consumption of the extract. Overall, this study demonstrated the absorbability 
of EA from a pomegranate extract high in ellagitannin content and its ex vivo 
antioxidant effects.

Studies were conducted on the flavonoids (myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, 
luteolin, and apigenin) contents of 62 edible tropical plants. The highest total 
flavonoids content was in onion leaves (1497.5 mg/kg quercetin, 391.0 mg/kg 
luteolin, and 832.0 mg/kg kaempferol), followed by Semambu leaves (2041.0 
mg/kg), bird chili (1663.0 mg/kg), black tea (1491.0 mg/kg), papaya shoots 
(1264.0 mg/kg), and guava (1128.5 mg/kg). The major flavonoid in these plant 
extracts is quercetin, followed by myricetin and kaempferol. Luteolin could be 
detected only in broccoli (74.5 mg/kg dry weight), green chili (33.0 mg/kg), 
bird chili (1035.0 mg/kg), onion leaves (391.0 mg/kg), belimbi fruit (202.0 
mg/kg), belimbi leaves (464.5 mg/kg), French bean (11.0 mg/kg), carrot (37.5 
mg/kg), white radish (9.0 mg/kg), local celery (80.5 mg/kg), limau purut leaves 
(30.5 mg/kg), and dried asam gelugur (107.5 mg/kg). Apigenin was found only in 
Chinese cabbage (187.0 mg/kg), bell pepper (272.0 mg/kg), garlic (217.0 mg/kg), 
belimbi fruit (458.0 mg/kg), French peas (176.0 mg/kg), snake gourd (42.4 
mg/kg), guava (579.0 mg/kg), wolfberry leaves (547.0 mg/kg), local celery (338.5 
mg/kg), daun turi (39.5 mg/kg), and kadok (34.5 mg/kg). In vegetables, quercetin 
glycosides predominate, but glycosides of kaempferol, luteolin, and apigenin are 
also present. Fruits contain almost exclusively quercetin glycosides, whereas 
kaempferol and myricetin glycosides are found only in trace quantities.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of three common 
cooking practices (i.e., boiling, steaming, and frying) on phytochemical 
contents (i.e., polyphenols, carotenoids, glucosinolates, and ascorbic acid), 
total antioxidant capacities (TAC), as measured by three different analytical 
assays [Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), total radical-trapping 
antioxidant parameter (TRAP), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)] and 
physicochemical parameters of three vegetables (carrots, courgettes, and 
broccoli). Water-cooking treatments better preserved the antioxidant compounds, 
particularly carotenoids, in all vegetables analyzed and ascorbic acid in 
carrots and courgettes. Steamed vegetables maintained a better texture quality 
than boiled ones, whereas boiled vegetables showed limited discoloration. Fried 
vegetables showed the lowest degree of softening, even though antioxidant 
compounds were less retained. An overall increase of TEAC, FRAP, and TRAP values 
was observed in all cooked vegetables, probably because of matrix softening and 
increased extractability of compounds, which could be partially converted into 
more antioxidant chemical species. Our findings defy the notion that processed 
vegetables offer lower nutritional quality and also suggest that for each 
vegetable a cooking method would be preferred to preserve the nutritional and 
physicochemical qualities.

Flavonoids and related plant compounds in fruits and vegetables are of 
particular importance as they have been found to possess antioxidant and free 
radical scavenging activity. The HPLC-based quantitative procedure, with 
improved extraction and hydrolysis, was used to analyze the content of the 
flavonols quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol in 10 black currant cultivars 
from organic farms and in 5 cultivars from conventional farms. Myricetin was the 
most abundant flavonol, and its amount varied significantly among cultivars, 
from 8.9 to 24.5 mg x 100 g(-1) (fresh weight). The quercetin levels in black 
currant also varied widely among the cultivars, from 5.2 to 12.2 mg x 100 g(-1). 
The kaempferol levels in black currant cultivars were low, ranging from 0.9 to 
2.3 mg x 100 g(-1). The sum of these major flavonols varied widely among black 
currant cultivars. No consistent differences in the contents of flavonols were 
found between the same black currant cultivars grown in organic and conventional 
ways. The high variability in the levels of flavonols in different cultivars 
offers possible avenues for identifying and selecting cultivars rich in certain 
flavonols for the special production of berries for industrial use.

Considerable epidemiological evidence suggests a link between the consumption of 
diets rich in fruits and vegetables and a decreased risk of cardiovascular 
disease and cancers. Anthocyanins have received attention as important dietary 
constituents that may provide health benefits and contribute antioxidant 
capacity beyond that provided by essential micronutrients such as ascorbate, 
tocopherols, and selenium. The emergence of renewed interest by industrial 
countries in traditional herbal medicines and the development of 'functional 
foods' are stimulating the need for more information regarding the 
bioavailability and efficacy of plant polyphenols. Flavonoids represent a 
numerous group of secondary plant metabolites based on the structure of a pyran 
ring flanked by two or more phenyl rings and varying subtly in the degree of 
unsaturation and the pattern of hydroxylation or methylation. Flavonoids also 
vary in the type of sugar attached or the degree of polymerization. 
Anthocyanins, potent flavonoid antioxidants widely distributed in fruits, 
vegetables and red wines, normally occur in nature as glycosides, a form not 
usually considered as bioavailable. We have examined the bioavailability and 
pharmacokinetics of anthocyanins in humans. Anthocyanins were detected as 
glycosides in both plasma and urine samples. The elimination of plasma 
anthocyanins appeared to follow first-order kinetics and most anthocyanin 
compounds were excreted in urine within 4 h after feeding. The current findings 
appear to refute assumptions that anthocyanins are not absorbed in their 
unchanged glycosylated forms in humans.

Limited information is available concerning the qualitative and quantitative 
composition of polyphenolic compounds, especially flavonoids, in almonds. We 
determined total phenols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids in California almond 
(Prunus dulcis) skins and kernels among the principal almond varieties (Butte, 
Carmel, Fritz, Mission, Monterey, Nonpareil, Padre, and Price) with 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/electrochemical detection and UV 
detection. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry under identical HPLC 
conditions was utilized to verify identities of the predominant flavonoids and 
phenolic acids. Total phenols ranged from 127 (Fritz) to 241 (Padre) mg gallic 
acid equivalents/100 g of fresh weight. The analyses were compiled to produce a 
data set of 18 flavonoids and three phenolic acids. The predominant flavonoids 
were isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside and isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside (in 
combination), catechin, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, epicatechin, 
quercetin-3-O-galactoside, and isorhamnetin-3-O-galactoside at 16.81, 1.93, 
1.17, 0.85, 0.83, and 0.50 mg/100 g of fresh weight almonds, respectively. Using 
the existing approach of calculating only the aglycone form of flavonoids for 
use in the U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrient database, whole almonds would 
provide the most prevalent aglycones of isorhamnetin at 11.70 (3.32), kaempferol 
at 0.60 (0.17), catechin at 1.93 (0.55), quercetin at 0.72 (0.20), and 
epicatechin at 0.85 (0.24) mg/100 g of fresh weight (mg/oz serving), 
respectively. These data can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of 
action underlying the relationship between almond consumption and health-related 
outcomes and provide values for whole and blanched almonds suitable for 
inclusion in nutrient databases.

In the United States, commercially available foods, including cocoa and 
chocolate, are being marketed with statements referring to the level of 
antioxidant activity and polyphenols. For cocoa-containing foods, there has been 
no comprehensive survey of the content of these and other chemistries. A survey 
of cocoa and chocolate-containing products marketed in the United States was 
conducted to determine antioxidant activity and polyphenol and procyanidin 
contents. Commercially available samples consisted of the top market share 
products in each of the following six categories: natural cocoa, unsweetened 
baking chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet baking chips, milk chocolate, and 
chocolate syrup. Composite samples were characterized using four different 
methods: oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), vitamin C equivalence 
antioxidant capacity (VCEAC), total polyphenols, and procyanidins. All composite 
lots were further characterized for percent nonfat cocoa solids (NFCS) and 
percent fat. Natural cocoas had the highest levels of antioxidant activities, 
total polyphenols, and procyanidins followed by baking chocolates, dark 
chocolates and baking chips, and finally milk chocolate and syrups. The results 
showed a strong linear correlation between NFCS and ORAC (R (2) = 0.9849), total 
polyphenols (R (2) = 0.9793), and procyanidins (R (2) = 0.946), respectively. On 
the basis of principal component analysis, 81.4% of the sample set was 
associated with NFCS, antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, and procyanidins. 
The results indicated that, regardless of the product category, NFCS were the 
primary factor contributing to the level of cocoa antioxidants in the products 
tested. Results further suggested that differences in cocoa bean blends and 
processing, with the possible exception of Dutching, are minor factors in 
determining the level of antioxidants in commercially available cocoa-containing 
products in the United States.

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and red wine (RW) are two basic elements that form 
part of the so-called Mediterranean diet. Both stand out because of their high 
phenolic compound content and their potential related health benefits. The 
present study is focused on the metabolic disposition of resveratrol (RESV), 
tyrosol (TYR), and hydroxytyrosol (HT) following the consumption of EVOO, RW, 
and a combination of both. In this study, 12 healthy volunteers consumed a 
single dose of 25 mL of EVOO, 150 mL of RW, and a combination of both in a 
crossover randomized clinical trial. Urinary recovery of RESV, TYR, and HT was 
analysed in urine samples collected over a 6-h period following the intake of 
each treatment. Higher HT levels were observed following EVOO compared to RW 
(3788 ± 1751 nmols and 2308 ± 847 nmols respectively). After the combination of 
EVOO and RW, the recovery of TYR and HT metabolites increased statistically 
compared to their separate consumption (4925 ± 1751 nmols of TYR and 6286 ± 3198 
nmols of HT). EVOO triggered an increase in glucuronide conjugates, while RW 
intake raised sulfate metabolites. Marginal effects were observed in RESV 
increased bioavailability after the combination of RW with the fat matrix 
provided by EVOO.

An automated on-line method for the determination of the isoflavones, daidzein 
and genistein, was developed using in-tube solid-phase microextraction coupled 
to high-performance liquid chromatography (in-tube SPME-HPLC). In-tube SPME is a 
new extraction technique for organic compounds in aqueous samples, in which 
analytes are extracted from the sample directly into an open tubular capillary 
by repeated draw/eject cycles of sample solution. Daidzein, genistein and their 
glucosides tested in this study were clearly separated within 8 min by HPLC 
using an XDB-C8 column with diode array detection. In order to optimize the 
extraction of these compounds, several in-tube SPME parameters were examined. 
The glucosides daidzin and genistin were analyzed as aglycones after hydrolysis 
because the glucosides were not concentrated by in-tube SPME. The optimum 
extraction conditions for daidzein and genistein were obtained with 20 
draw/eject cycles of 40 microl of sample using a Supel-Q porous layer open 
tubular capillary column. The extracted compounds were easily desorbed from the 
capillary by mobile phase flow, and carryover was not observed. Using the 
in-tube SPME-HPLC method, the calibration curves of these compounds were linear 
in the range 5-200 ng/ml, with a correlation coefficient above 0.9999 (n = 18), 
and the detection limits (S/N = 3) were 0.4-0.5 ng/ml. This method was 
successfully applied to the analysis of soybean foods without interference 
peaks. The recoveries of aglycones and glucosides spiked into food samples were 
above 97%.

Eriocitrin, a flavonoid glycoside present in lemon fruit, is metabolized in vivo 
to a series of eriodictyol, methylated eriodictyol, 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic 
acid, and their conjugates. Plasma antioxidant activity increased following oral 
administration of aqueous eriocitrin solutions to rats. Eriocitrin metabolites 
were found in plasma and renal excreted urine through HPLC and LC-MS analyses. 
Eriocitrin was not detected in plasma and urine, but eriodictyol, 
homoeriodictyol, and hesperetin in their conjugated forms were detected in 
plasma of 4.0 h following administration of eriocitrin. In urine for 24 h, both 
nonconjugates and conjugates of these metabolites were detected. 
3,4-Dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, which is metabolized from eriodictyol by 
intestinal bacteria, was detected in slight amounts with each form in 4.0-h 
plasma and 24-h urine. Eriocitrin was suggested to be metabolized by intestinal 
bacteria, and then eriodictyol and 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic of its metabolite 
were absorbed. Following administration of eriocitrin, plasma exhibited an 
elevated resistance effect to lipid peroxidation. Eriocitrin metabolites 
functioning as antioxidant agents are discussed.

An HPLC method was developed and validated for the quantification of sesaminol 
triglucoside and a sesaminol diglucoside in sesame seeds. These two lignans were 
isolated, and their structures were characterized by mass and nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy. Defatted sesame flour was extracted first with 85% 
ethanol for 5 h followed by 70% ethanol for 10 h at room temperature using

A new lignan glucoside was isolated from defatted sesame seed flour and its 
structure was established as sesamolinol diglucoside 
[2-(3-methoxy-4-(O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl 
(1-->6)-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside)phenoxyl)-6-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-cis-3,7-dioxabicyclo-(3.3.0)-octane] 
by mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A quantitative analysis of 
65 sesame seed samples showed that this sesamolinol diglucoside ranged from <5 
to 232 mg/100 g of seeds (98+/-57 mg/100 g) with no difference between white and 
black sesame seeds.

The monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric flavan-3-ol composition of wines, grape 
seeds, and skins from Vitis vinifera L. cv. Graciano, Tempranillo, and Cabernet 
Sauvignon has been studied using (1) fractionation by polyamide column 
chromatography followed by HPLC/ESI-MS analysis, (2) fractionation on C(18) 
Sep-Pak cartridges followed by reaction with vanillin and acid-catalyzed 
degradation in the presence of toluene-alpha-thiol (thiolysis). The content of 
monomers ((+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin), procyanidin dimers (B3, B1, B4, and 
B2), trimers (T2 and C1), and dimer gallates (B2-3-O-gallate, B2-3'-O-gallate, 
and B1-3-O-gallate) ranged from 76.93 to 133.18 mg/L in wines, from 2.30 to 8.21 
mg/g in grape seeds, and from 0.14 to 0.38 mg/g in grape skins. In wines, the 
polymeric fraction represented 77-84% of total flavan-3-ols and showed a mean 
degree of polymerization (mDP) value of 6.3-13.0. In grapes, the polymeric 
fraction represented 75-81% of total flavan-3-ols in seeds and 94-98% in skins 
and showed mDP values of 6.4-7.3 in seeds and 33.8-85.7 in skins. All the 
monomeric flavan-3-ols and oligomeric procyanidins found in wines were also 
present in seeds, although differences in their relative abundances were seen. 
The skin polymeric proanthocyanidins participated in the equilibration of the 
wine polymeric proanthocyanidin fraction, especially contributing to the polymer 
subunit composition and mDP.

Physicochemical parameters, microbial diversity using sequencing and amplicon, 
and metabolite concentrations from Ginger Bug and Ginger Beer were 
characterized. Furthermore, the sensory aspects of the beverage were determined. 
The longer ginger bug activation time (96 h) resulted in higher production of 
organic acids and alcohols, increased phenolic and volatile compounds 
concentration, greater microbial diversity, and increased lactic acid bacteria 
and yeasts. In the same way, the longer fermentation time (14 days) of ginger 
beer resulted in higher ethanol content, volatile compounds, and phenolic 
compounds, in addition to better sensory characteristics. Our results showed 
that ginger beer produced with ginger bug and fermented for 14 days showed 
better volatile and phenolic compound profiles, physicochemical parameters, 
microbial diversity, and sensory characteristics.

Mutagenic heterocyclic amines (HAs) are formed at low levels during cooking of 
meat and fish, and some of them are considered to be possible human carcinogens. 
The formation of HAs may be affected by the presence of synthetic or naturally 
occurring antioxidants. In the present study the effect of virgin olive oil 
(VOO) phenolic compounds, identified and quantified by LC-MS, on the formation 
of HAs in a model system was evaluated. An aqueous solution of creatinine, 
glucose, and glycine was heated in the presence of two samples of VOO differing 
only in the composition of phenolic compounds. The addition of VOO to the model 
system inhibited the formation of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline 
(IQx), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), and 
2-amino-3,7,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx) by between 30 and 50% 
compared with the control. Fresh-made olive oil, which contained a high amount 
of dihydroxyphenylethanol derivatives, inhibited HA formation more than a 
1-year-old oil did. The inhibition of HA formation was also verified using 
phenolic compounds extracted from VOO.

Quercetin is a typical flavonoid present mostly as glycosides in plant foods; it 
has attracted much attention for its potential beneficial effects in disease 
prevention. In this study, we examined human volunteers after the short-term 
ingestion of onion, a vegetable rich in quercetin glucosides. The subjects were 
served diets containing onion slices (quercetin equivalent: 67.6-93.6 mg/day) 
with meals for 1 wk. Quercetin was only found in glucuronidase-sulfatase-treated 
plasma, and its concentration after 10 h of fasting increased from 0.04 +/- 0.04 
microM before the trial to 0.63 +/- 0.72 microM after the 1-wk trial. The 
quercetin content in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) after glucuronidase-sulfatase 
treatment corresponded to <1% of the alpha-tocopherol content. Human LDL 
isolated from the plasma after the trial showed little improvement of its 
resistance to copper ion-induced oxidation. It is therefore concluded that 
conjugated metabolites of quercetin accumulate exclusively in human blood plasma 
in the concentration range of 10(-7) approximately 10(-6) M after the short-term 
ingestion of vegetables rich in quercetin glucosides, although these metabolites 
are hardly incorporated into plasma LDL.

The study was aim to assess the impact of biochanin A on the oral 
bioavailability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of saquinavir (SQV), a substrate of 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp), in rats. 10 male rats were randomized into 2 groups of 
equal size, and administered orally 30 mg/kg SQV with or without 20 mg/kg 
biochanin A. The PK of SQV was assessed using non-compartmental analysis. 
Results revealed that the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of SQV 
from time zero to time infinity (AUC0-∞) was reduced by 51.39% by biochanin A 
(P=0.038); while the apparent systemic clearance (CL/F) was increased by 87.62% 
(P=0.028). Double peak phenomenon was observed in the plasma SQV profiles. 
Biochanin A increased the first peak, yet decreased the second peak of plasma 
SQV levels. Our study demonstrates that biochanin A can significantly reduce SQV 
oral bioavailability and alter SQV PK profiles in rats. Findings in this study 
suggest a precaution in the clinic when SQV is administered with dietary/herbal 
supplements that contain biochanin A.

The purpose of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetics of quercetin 
aglycone as well as its conjugated metabolites and to develop a population 
pharmacokinetic model for quercetin that incorporates enterohepatic 
recirculation. The stability of quercetin in different matrices at various 
temperatures and pH, and the quercetin content of six capsules of the herbal 
preparation Quercetin-500 Plus were determined by HPLC. Subjects received 
quercetin 500 mg three times daily and blood and urine samples were obtained. 
The concentration of quercetin aglycone and conjugated metabolites were assayed 
using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. Pharmacokinetic 
parameters were determined using noncompartmental analysis with WinNonlin. A 
population compartment model incorporating input from the gallbladder was 
developed to account for the enterohepatic recirculation observed with 
quercetin. The oral clearance (CL/F) was high (3.5 x 10(4)l/h) with an average 
terminal half-life of 3.5 h for quercetin. The plasma concentration versus time 
curves exhibited re-entry peaks. A one-compartment model that included 
enterohepatic recirculation best described the plasma data. This represents the 
first comprehensive evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and enterohepatic 
recirculation of quercetin in humans. Population pharmacokinetic models adapted 
for enterohepatic recirculation allowed an assessment of the magnitude and 
frequency of the enterohepatic recirculation process.

The preparation of OSA-modified starch often involves heterogeneous reactions, 
high energy consumption and environmental pollution. To address these issues, 
this study explored a novel strategy for producing OSA-modified corn starch via 
a semi-dry process assisted by improved extrusion cooking technology (IECT). The 
degree of substitution (DS), structure and properties of OSA-modified corn 
starch, as well as the underlying mechanisms of these changes, were 
investigated. Results showed that as the screw speeds increased, starch granule 
morphology became rougher, and the crystalline structure was disrupted. 
OSA-modified starch exhibited higher peak viscosity and lower gelatinization 
temperatures. At 300 rpm, the DS of OSA-modified starch prepared via 
IECT-assisted semi-dry processing increased by 44 ± 0.5 % compared with the 
conventional method. The resistant starch content increased to 19.6 ± 0.3 %, and 
it showed better emulsifying activity and stability. This study provides a 
theoretical foundation for the efficient preparation of OSA-modified starch.

The intake of alkylresorcinols and lignans in Spain is unknown due to the lack 
of information on the content of these compounds in particular foods. This paper 
describes the development of the first alkylresorcinol and lignan database 
adapted to the Spanish diet, including foods items especially relevant for this 
population. The values of alkylresorcinols and lignans in common foods and 
beverages were collected from scientific publications in refereed journals, and 
other foods particularly consumed in Spain, for which values were not available, 
were analyzed by standardized protocols and included into the database. The 
Alignia database presents the content of alkylresorcinols in 88 food items and 
the lignan content of 593 foods and beverages. Using the database, the intake of 
lignans in Spain, calculated using data from the Food Composition Panel based on 
household consumption, was estimated to be 0.76 mg/day.

implication as cancer chemopreventive and neuroprotective agents. Total 
resveratrol content, quantified as glucoside and aglycone forms of resveratrol, 
has been determined in a survey of 45 Monastrell monovarietal Spanish red wine 
types (around 135 wine samples), belonging to Alicante and Bullas appellations. 
The average between ratio glucoside/aglycone forms of resveratrol in these wines 
was considerably high, ranging from 82 to 91% of resveratrol in its glycosidic 
form. This characteristic was observed in a high percentage of the studied 
wines, which were made under different winemaking procedures, and from different 
vintages (1995-2002). In addition, wines made using macerative fermentations 
with double amount of solid parts (""doble pasta"") reached the highest levels of 
total stilbene content expressed as resveratrol equivalent, i.e., 30 mg/L 
(average of 18.8 mg/L). It can be concluded that high resveratrol glucoside 
concentration and low free isomer content can be considered characteristics of 
the Monastrell variety, as it happens to red wines deriving from other varieties 
grown at warm climates. This fact, also observed for other French and Portuguese 
red varieties, might play an important role in food habits involving these types 
of wines.

Six flavone glycosides were separated by HPLC using RP-18 with a quaternary 
mobile phase mixture [water-acetonitrile-tetrahydrofuran-acetic acid (80:16:3:1,

We present a simultaneous liquid chromatographic method for the separation of 
two flavonoid compound families, flavanone glycosides (FGs) and polymethoxylated 
flavones (PMFs), which are usually found in citrus fruits species and varieties. 
This technique permits the quantitation of six FGs (narirutin, naringin, 
hesperidin, neohesperidin, didymin, poncirin) and six PMFs (sinensetin, 
hexamethoxyflavone, nobiletin, scutellarein, heptamethoxyflavone and 
tangeretin). This technique, to be used to characterize a citrus juice by its 
polyphenolic profile, has been applied to the determination of flavonoid 
compounds in grapefruit- and orange juice. Differentiation of orange juice 
varieties and mixtures containing tangor juice using polyphenolic profiles and 
flavonoid content has been achieved.

Fruits from 107 genotypes of Vaccinium L., Rubus L., and Ribes L., were analyzed 
for total anthocyanins (ACY), total phenolics (TPH), and antioxidant capacities 
as determined by oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC) and ferric reducing 
antioxidant power (FRAP). Fruit size was highly correlated (r = 0.84) with ACY 
within Vaccinium corymbosum L., but was not correlated to ACY across eight other 
Vaccinium species, or within 27 blackberry hybrids. Certain Vaccinium and Ribes 
fruits with pigmented flesh were lower in ACY, TPH, ORAC, and FRAP compared to 
those values in berries with nonpigmented flesh. ORAC values ranged from 19 to 
131 micromol Trolox equivalents/g in Vaccinium, from 13 to 146 in Rubus, and 
from 17 to 116 in Ribes. Though ACY may indicate TPH, the range observed in 
ACY/TPH ratios precludes prediction of ACY from TPH and vice versa for a single 
genotype. In general, TPH was more highly correlated to antioxidant capacity 
than ACY was. This study demonstrates the wide diversity of phytochemical levels 
and antioxidant capacities within and across three genera of small fruit.

The health-promoting effects of whole-grain wheat likely derive from phenolic 
compounds and other antioxidants that also make wheat a potential source of 
functional food ingredients. The objective of this study was to determine the 
effects of genotype and growing environment on the phenolic contents and 
antioxidant activities of alcohol-soluble extracts from commercial wheat 
cultivars. Total phenolic contents (TPCs), antioxidant activities (AOAs), and 
concentrations of six phenolic acids were measured in six red- and white-grained 
hard spring wheat genotypes grown at four diverse locations in Western Canada 
during the 2003 crop year. There were significant differences among genotypes 
and environments for TPC, AOA, and concentrations of all the phenolic acids 
measured. The predominant indicators of antioxidant potential, i.e., TPC, AOA, 
and ferulic acid (FA) concentration were highly intercorrelated (r > 0.72). For 
these indices, the Canada Western (CW) Red Spring wheat cultivars Neepawa and AC 
Elsa had the highest levels, whereas an analogous CW hard white spring wheat 
cultivar, AC Snowbird, had the lowest levels. Grain color did not appear to be a 
factor in the expression of antioxidant-related parameters. For both TPC and 
AOA, as well as for vanillic acid, syringic acid, and ferulic acid, 
environmental effects were considerably larger than genotype effects. Neither 
growing temperature nor rainfall from anthesis to maturity appeared to be 
related to the environmental variation that was observed. Genotype x environment 
interaction was small for all parameters compared with genotype and location 
effects and was significant only for TPC. Genotype variation for antioxidant 
properties indicates that it would be possible to select for these quantitative 
traits in a breeding program. However, the significant environmental variation 
observed would delay and/or complicate this process.

A total of 72, 65-week-old broiler breeder hens (Ross 308, BW 4,190 ± 45 g) was 
placed in individual cages to investigate utilization of fiber in soy hulls 
(SH), oat hulls (OH), and flax meal (FM). Birds were adapted to cages for 10 d 
prior to allocation (n = 18) to broiler breeder ration (control) or control 
mixed with either of the 3 fiber sources (wt/wt) added to supply equal amounts 
of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) ∼21% and TiO2. The daily feed allocation was 
based on 4% BW. Feed intake (FI) was monitored daily, and grab excreta samples 
were taken on d 16 and 17. On d 18, all birds were weighed and killed 2 h post 
feeding to measure ceca digesta pH and short chain fatty acids (SCFA). Relative 
to the control birds, birds receiving fiber lost (P < 0.05) BW due to decreased 
(P < 0.05) FI. The BW changes were respectively +80, -174, -133, and -585 g/bird 
for control, SH, OH, and FM, and corresponding FI was 1,062, 918, 885, and 
590 g/bird. Birds fed FM retained higher (P < 0.05) NDF than birds fed either SH 
or OH. The ceca digesta pH was lower (P < 0.05) in birds receiving added fiber 
relative to control. However, ceca digesta pH of FM fed birds was lower (P < 
0.05) than in birds fed either SH or OH, which were in turn similar (P > 0.05). 
Birds fed FM had higher (P < 0.05) concentration of butyric acid than birds fed 
the control diets, while birds fed SH and OH had intermediate butyric acid 
concentration. Acetic acid and total SCFA concentrations were higher (P < 0.05) 
in birds fed OH diet than in birds fed control but was similar (P > 0.05) to 
that in birds fed either SH or FM. In conclusion, short term feeding of fibrous 
feed ingredients reduced BW linked to reduced FI. Fiber sources exhibited 
differences in utilization reflective of chemical characteristics.

A HPLC-MS procedure for the sensitive and specific analysis of the black tea 
flavonoid theaflavin in human plasma and urine was developed. Levels were 
measured after enzymatic deconjugation, extraction into ethyl acetate, and 
separation by HPLC, using tandem mass spectrometry as a detecting system. Two 
healthy volunteers consumed 700 mg theaflavins, equivalent to about 30 cups of 
black tea. The maximum concentration detected in blood plasma was 1.0 microg 
l(-1) in a sample collected after 2 h. The concentration in urine also peaked 
after 2 h at 4.2 microg l(-1). Hence, only minute amounts of theaflavins can be 
detected in plasma and urine samples of healthy volunteers after ingestion.

Epidemiological studies suggest that consumption of flavonol-rich diets 
decreases the risk of developing heart disease and certain cancers. Recent 
studies have detected flavonol conjugates in blood and urine following various 
dietary interventions. To assess to what extent flavonols also accumulate in 
tissues, where they might be expected to exert anti-carcinogenic and 
anti-atherogenic effects, [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside was synthesized and 
fed to rats. After 60 min, 93.6% of the ingested radioactivity was recovered 
from the intestine, incorporated into 18 metabolites that had undergone 
deglycosylation followed by varying degrees of glucuronidation, methylation, 
and/or sulfation. [(14)C]Quercetin, the aglycon of the radiolabeled substrate, 
was present in the intestine and in trace amounts in the liver but was not 
detected in the plasma and kidneys. The original [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside 
was detected exclusively in the intestine, where it accounted for only 26.2% of 
the radioactivity. The remainder of the recovered radioactivity was located 
mainly in the plasma, liver, and kidneys as (14)C-labeled metabolites. However, 
compared to the quantities in the gastrointestinal tract, the levels of 
metabolites in plasma and body tissues were very low, indicating only limited 
absorption into the blood stream. The data demonstrate that 
quercetin-4'-glucoside, which is a major flavonol in onions, undergoes rapid and 
extensive metabolism in the intestine, and this appears not to be associated to 
any extent with transport across the gut wall into the blood stream.

Scottish-grown red raspberries are a rich source of vitamin C and phenolics, 
most notably, the anthocyanins cyanidin-3-sophoroside, 
cyanidin-3-(2(G)-glucosylrutinoside), and cyanidin-3-glucoside, and two 
ellagitannins, sanguiin H-6 and lambertianin C, which are present together with 
trace levels of flavonols, ellagic acid, and hydroxycinnamates. The antioxidant 
capacity of the fresh fruit and the levels of vitamin C and phenolics were not 
affected by freezing. When fruit were stored at 4 degrees C for 3 days and then 
at 18 degrees C for 24 h, mimicking the route fresh fruit takes after harvest to 
the supermarket and onto the consumer's table, anthocyanin levels were 
unaffected while vitamin C levels declined and those of elligitannins increased, 
and overall, there was no effect on the antioxidant capacity of the fruit. It is 
concluded, therefore, that freshly picked, fresh commercial, and frozen 
raspberries all contain similar levels of phytochemicals and antioxidants per 
serving.

The bioavailability of dietary phytochemicals may be influenced by the food 
matrix in which they are consumed. In this study the impact of a full-fat yogurt 
on the bioavailability and metabolism of orange juice flavanones was 
investigated. Human plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period after the 
consumption of 250 mL of orange juice containing a total of 168 micromol of 
hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside and 12 micromol of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside, with and 
without 150 mL of full-fat yogurt. The juice also contained 1 g of paracetamol 
and 5 g of lactulose. HPLC-MS(2) analysis revealed the accumulation of 
hesperetin-7-O-glucuronide, and an unassigned hesperetin-O-glucuronide 
metabolite in plasma reached a peak concentration (C(max)) of 924 +/- 224 
nmol/L, 4.4 +/- 0.5 h (T(max)) after orange juice ingestion. The T(max) is 
indicative of absorption in the colon. When the juice was consumed with yogurt, 
neither the C(max) at 661 +/- 170 nmol/L nor the T(max) at 5.1 +/- 0.4 h were 
significantly different from those obtained with juice alone. The two hesperetin 
glucuronides were also excreted in urine along with a third 
hesperetin-O-glucuronide, two hesperetin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfates, a 
hesperetin-O-diglucuronide, a naringenin-O-diglucuronide, and, tentatively 
identified, naringenin-7-O-glucuronide and naringenin-4'-O-glucuronide. This 
indicates the occurrence of substantial, postabsorption, phase II metabolism 
prior to urinary excretion. The quantity of flavanone metabolites excreted 0-5 h 
after orange juice ingestion was significantly reduced by yogurt, but over the 
full 0-24 h urine collection period, the amounts excreted, corresponding to ca. 
7.0% of intake, were not affected by the addition of yogurt to the drink. Nor 
did yogurt have a significant effect on gastric emptying, as determined by 
plasma paracetamol levels, or on the mouth to cecum transit time of the head of 
the meal, assessed by measurement of lactulose-derived breath hydrogen. There is 
also a discussion of the merits of studies of the absorption and metabolism of 
flavanones based on direct analysis of metabolites by HPLC-MS and the more 
traditional indirect approach where samples are treated with a mollusc 
glucuronidase/sulfatase preparation prior to HPLC analysis of the released 
aglycones.

Plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period after the consumption by 
humans of 200 g of strawberries, containing 222 micromol of pelargonidin-3- 
O-glucoside, with and without cream. The main metabolite, a pelargonidin- 
O-glucuronide, reached a peak plasma concentration ( C max) of 274 +/- 24 nmol/L 
after 1.1 +/- 0.4 h ( t max) when only strawberries were ingested. When the 
strawberries were eaten with cream, the C max was not statistically different 
but the t max at 2.4 +/- 0.5 h was delayed significantly ( p < 0.001). The 
pelargonidin- O-glucuronide, along with smaller quantities of other metabolites, 
was also excreted in urine in quantities corresponding to ca. 1% of anthocyanin 
intake. The quantities excreted over the 0-24 h collection period were not 
influenced significantly by cream. However, the 0-2 h excretion of anthocyanin 
metabolites was significantly lower when the strawberries were eaten with cream, 
whereas the reverse occurred during with the 5-8 h excretion period. In keeping 
with these observations, measurement of plasma paracetamol and breath hydrogen 
revealed that cream delayed gastric emptying and extended mouth to cecum transit 
time.

A national sampling plan was developed to select the most widely used 
isoflavone-containing foods in the United States. Foods were selected based on 
their retail volume and sampled in five geographical areas representing seven 
metropolitan areas. Isoflavones were analyzed from composite samples, raw and 
cooked, and reported by brand. Quality control measures were evaluated 
throughout the study. Isoflavone levels ranged from 1 microg/g in soy sauces to 
540 microg/g in tempeh. Soymilk and tofu represented the major portion of soy 
foods evaluated. These data will appear in the electronic version of USDA 
Handbook No. 8 of Food Composition Data in 1999.

The inhibition and eradication of oral biofilms is increasingly focused on the 
use of plant extracts as mouthwashes and toothpastes adjuvants. Here, we report 
on the chemical composition and the antibiofilm activity of 15 methanolic 
extracts of Iris species against both mono-(Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
Staphylococcus aureus) and multi-species oral biofilms (Streptococcus gordonii, 
Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, and Actinomyces 
naeslundii). The phytochemical profiles of Iris pallida s.l., Iris versicolor 
L., Iris lactea Pall., Iris carthaliniae Fomin, and Iris germanica were 
determined by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution 
tandem mass spectroscopy (UHPLC-HRMS/MS) analysis, and a total of 180 compounds 
were identified among Iris species with (iso)flavonoid dominancy. I. pallida, I. 
versicolor, and I. germanica inhibited both the quorum sensing and adhesion 
during biofilm formation in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the 
extracts were less active against maturated biofilms. Of the five tested 
species, Iris pallida s.l. was the most effective at both inhibiting biofilm 
formation and disrupting existing biofilms, and the leaf extract exhibited the 
strongest inhibitory effect compared to the root and rhizome extracts. The 
cytotoxicity of the extracts was excluded in human fibroblasts. The inhibition 
of bacterial adhesion significantly correlated with myristic acid content, and 
quorum sensing inhibition correlated with the 7-β-hydroxystigmast-4-en-3-one 
content. These findings could be useful for establishing an effective tool for 
the control of oral biofilms and thus dental diseases.

Neochlorogenic acid (3-CQA) and cryptochlorogenic acid (4-CQA), isolated from 
prune (Prunus domestica L.), were identified by NMR and MS analyses. In 
addition, the quantity of chlorogenic acid isomers in prune were measured by 
HPLC. These isomers, 3-CQA, 4-CQA, and chlorogenic acid (5-CQA), were contained 
in the ratio 78.7:18. 4:3.9, respectively. 4-CQA was identified and quantified 
in prune for the first time, and relatively high amounts of this isomer were 
characteristic. Antioxidative activities of the chlorogenic acid isomers, such 
as scavenging activity on superoxide anion radicals and inhibitory effect 
against oxidation of methyl linoleate, were also evaluated. Each isomer showed 
antioxidative activities which were almost the same.

Previous studies on coffee examined absorption of phenolic acids (PA) in the 
small intestine, but not the contribution of the colon to absorption. Nine 
healthy volunteers ingested instant soluble coffee ( approximately 335 mg total 
chlorogenic acids (CGAs)) in water. Blood samples were taken over 12 h, and at 
24 h to assess return to baseline. Many previous studies, which used 
glucuronidase and sulfatase, measured only PA and did not rigorously assess 
CGAs. To improve this, plasma samples were analyzed after full hydrolysis by 
chlorogenate esterase, glucuronidase and sulfatase to release aglycone 
equivalents of PA followed by liquid-liquid extraction and ESI-LC-ESI-MS/MS 
detection. Ferulic, caffeic and isoferulic acid equivalents appeared rapidly in 
plasma, peaking at 1-2 h. Dihydrocaffeic and dihydroferulic acids appeared in 
plasma 6-8 h after ingestion (T(max=)8-12 h). Substantial variability in maximum 
plasma concentration and T(max) was also observed between individuals. This 
study confirms that the small intestine is a significant site for absorption of 
PA, but shows for the first time that the colon/microflora play the major role 
in absorption and metabolism of CGAs and PA from coffee.

Knowledge of the biochemical processes responsible for the release of phenolic 
acids (precursors of vinyl aromatics) during malting is important to find 
mitigation strategies for the toxicologically relevant styrene (formed from 
cinnamic acid) in wheat beer. Therefore, grain and malts of four barley and 
three wheat varieties were screened for the activities of various enzymes and 
the amounts of nonstarch polysaccharides (to which the phenolic acids are bound 
to a certain extent). During malting, a very strong degradation of β-glucan, 
synonymous to a depletion of the cell walls, was found, suggesting that a 
partial degradation of cell walls cannot have an effect on the release of 
phenolic acids. In barley malts, water-extractable arabinoxylan contents were 
between 0.59 and 0.79 g/100 g dm and in wheat malts between 0.93 and 1.51 g/100 
g dm. Additionally, higher soluble ferulic acid contents in wheat wort compared 
to barley wort indicated that the degradation of nonstarch polysaccharides has 
an impact on the release of phenolic acids. For the feruloyl esterase, higher 
activities were found in malts of the barley varieties. However, this fact was 
not reflected by the free phenolic acid contents in those malts. Correlation 
coefficients between the protease activity and the feruloyl esterase, α- and 
β-amylase, and β-glucanase activities were proven to be insignificant, 
highlighting that the protease activity had no effect on the activities of these 
other enzymes.

In spite of the wide literature describing the biological effects of phenolic 
compounds, scarce data are available on their absorption from diet. In the 
present work, we studied the absorption in humans of phenolic acids from beer, a 
common beverage rich in different phenolic acids with related chemical 
structures. Beer was analyzed for free and total (free+bound) phenolic acids. 
Ferulic, caffeic and sinapic acids were present in beer mainly as bound forms, 
while 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and p-coumaric acid were present mainly as free 
forms. Vanillic acid was present equally in the free and bound forms. Plasma 
samples were collected before and 30 and 60 min after beer administration and 
analyzed for free and conjugated phenolic acid content. A significant two- to 
fourfold increase in plasma levels of phenolic acids was detected with peak 
concentrations at 30 min after beer ingestion. 4-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid was 
present in plasma mainly as nonconjugated forms while p-coumaric acid was 
present equally as nonconjugated and conjugated forms. Ferulic, vanillic and 
caffeic acids were present in plasma predominantly as conjugated forms, with a 
slight prevalence of sulfates with respect to glucuronates. Our results indicate 
that phenolic acids from beer are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and 
are present in blood after being largely metabolized to the form of glucuronide 
and sulfate conjugates. The extent of conjugation is related to the chemical 
structure of phenolic acids: the monohydroxy derivatives showing the lowest 
conjugation degree and the dihydroxy derivatives showing the highest one.

The phenolic composition, aroma compounds, and organic acid content of 83 
vinegars have been determined. Multivariate analysis techniques have been used 
to classify these vinegar samples according to raw material (white wine, red 
wine, apple, honey, alcohol, balsamic, and malt) and production process (with 
and without aging in wood). Cluster analysis grouped the samples according to 
production process. Only apple and balsamic vinegars were separated from wine 
vinegars. Alcohol, honey, and malt vinegars were grouped with no aged wine 
vinegars. Linear discriminate analysis allowed a 88% differentiation according 
to raw material and 100% according to aging in wood. Besides, from the results 
obtained, a major role of the volatile compounds in the differentiation of the 
vinegar samples according to their aging period in wood can be seen.

The antioxidant polyphenols in cacao liquor, a major ingredient of chocolate and 
cocoa, have been characterized as flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidin oligomers. 
In this study, various cacao products were analyzed by normal-phase HPLC, and 
the profiles and quantities of the polyphenols present, grouped by molecular 
size (monomers to approximately oligomers), were compared. Individual cacao 
polyphenols, flavan-3-ols (catechin and epicatechin), and dimeric (procyanidin 
B2), trimeric (procyanidin C1), and tetrameric (cinnamtannin A2) 
proanthocyanidins, and galactopyranosyl-ent-(-)-epicatechin (2alpha-->7, 
4alpha-->8)-(-)-epicatechin (Gal-EC-EC), were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC 
and/or HPLC/MS. The profile of monomers (catechins) and proanthocyanidin in dark 
chocolate was similar to that of cacao liquor, while the ratio of flavan-3-ols 
to the total amount of monomeric and oligomeric polyphenols in the case of pure 
cocoa powder was higher than that in the case of cacao liquor or chocolate.

(-)-epicatechin is one of the most potent antioxidants present in the human 
diet. Particularly high levels are found in black tea, apples, and chocolate. 
High intake of catechins has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular 
diseases. There have been several reports concerning the bioavailability of 
catechins, however, the chemical structure of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in 
blood, tissues, and urine remains unclear. In the present study, we purified and 
elucidated the chemical structure of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in human and 
rat urine after oral administration. Three metabolites were purified from human 
urine including (-)-epicatechin-3'-O-glucuronide, 
4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-3'-O-glucuronide, and 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-5 
or 7-O-glucuronide, according to 1H- and 13C-NMR, HMBC, and LC-MS analyses. The 
metabolites purified from rat urine were 3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin, 
(-)-epicatechin-7-O-glucuronide, and 
3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-7-O-glucuronide. These compounds were also detected 
in the blood of humans and rats by LC-MS. The presence of these metabolites in 
blood and urine suggests that catechins are metabolized and circulated in the 
body after administration of catechin-containing foods.

Catechins are polyphenolic plant compounds (flavonoids) that may offer 
significant health benefits to humans. These benefits stem largely from their 
anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, and antimutagenic properties. Recent 
epidemiological studies suggest that the consumption of flavonoid-containing 
foods is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Chocolate is a 
natural cocoa bean-based product that reportedly contains high levels of 
monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric catechins. We have applied solid-liquid 
extraction and liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical 
ionization-mass spectrometry to the identification and determination of the 
predominant monomeric catechins, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin, in a baking 
chocolate Standard Reference Material (NIST Standard Reference Material 2384). 
(+)-Catechin and (-)-epicatechin are detected and quantified in chocolate 
extracts on the basis of selected-ion monitoring of their protonated [M + H](+) 
molecular ions. Tryptophan methyl ester is used as an internal standard. The 
developed method has the capacity to accurately quantify as little as 0.1 
microg/mL (0.01 mg of catechin/g of chocolate) of either catechin in chocolate 
extracts, and the method has additionally been used to certify (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin levels in the baking chocolate Standard Reference Material. This 
is the first reported use of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry for the 
quantitative determination of monomeric catechins in chocolate and the only 
report certifying monomeric catechin levels in a food-based Standard Reference 
Material.

Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

BACKGROUND: The mammalian lignans enterolactone and enterodiol are produced in 
the colon by the action of bacteria on the plant precursor secoisolariciresinol 
diglycoside, which is found in high concentrations in flaxseed.
OBJECTIVE: Two experiments were conducted to determine 1) whether there is a 
dose response in urinary lignan excretion with increasing flaxseed intake, 2) 
whether flaxseed processing affects lignan excretion, 3) peak plasma lignan 
concentrations, and 4) plasma lignan concentrations after chronic 
supplementation.
DESIGN: Nine healthy young women supplemented their diets with 5, 15, or 25 g 
raw or 25 g processed (muffin or bread) flaxseed for 7 d during the follicular 
phase of their menstrual cycles. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected 
at baseline and on the final day of supplementation. As an adjunct to the 
25-g-flaxseed arm, subjects consumed the supplement for an additional day and 
blood and urine samples were collected at specific intervals. All blood and 
urine samples were analyzed for enterolactone and enterodiol by gas 
chromatography-mass spectroscopy.
RESULTS: A dose-dependent urinary lignan response to raw flaxseed was observed 
(r = 0.72, P < 0.001). The processing of flaxseed as a muffin or bread did not 
affect the quantity of lignan excretion. Plasma lignan concentrations were 
greater (P < or = 0.05) than baseline by 9 h after flaxseed ingestion 
(29.35+/-3.69 and 51.75+/-7.49 nmol/L, respectively). The total plasma area 
under the curve was higher on the eighth than on the first day (1840.15+/-343.02 
and 1027.15+/-95.71 nmol x h/L, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Mammalian lignan production from flaxseed precursors is dependent on 
time and dose but not on processing.

Hesperidin is the predominant polyphenol consumed from citrus fruits and juices. 
However, hesperidin is proposed to have limited bioavailability due to the 
rutinoside moiety attached to the flavonoid. The aim of this study was to 
demonstrate in human subjects that the removal of the rhamnose group to yield 
the corresponding flavonoid glucoside (i.e., hesperetin-7-glucoside) will 
improve the bioavailability of the aglycone hesperetin. Healthy volunteers 
(n=16) completed the double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Subjects 
randomly consumed hesperetin equivalents supplied as orange juice with natural 
hesperidin (""low dose""), orange juice treated with hesperidinase enzyme to yield 
hesperetin-7-glucoside, and orange juice fortified to obtain 3 times more 
hesperidin than naturally present (""high dose""). The area under the curve (AUC) 
for total plasma hesperetin of subjects consuming hesperetin-7-glucoside juice 
was 2-fold higher than that of subjects consuming the ""low"" dose hesperidin 
juice [3.45+/-1.27 vs. 1.16+/-0.52 mmol/(L.h), respectively, P>0.0001]. The AUC 
for hesperetin after consuming the hesperetin-7-glucoside juice was improved to 
the level of the ""high"" dose hesperidin juice [4.16+/-1.50 mmol/(L.h)]. The peak 
plasma concentrations (C(max)) of hesperetin were 4-fold higher (2.60+/-1.07 
mmol/L, P<0.0001) after subjects consumed hesperetin-7-glucoside juice compared 
with those consuming ""low"" dose hesperidin juice (0.48 +/- 0.27 mmol/L), and 
1.5-fold higher than those consuming ""high"" dose hesperidin juice (1.05+/-0.25 
mmol/L). The corresponding T(max) was much faster (0.6+/-0.1 h, P<0.0001) after 
subjects consumed hesperetin-7-glucoside juice compared with ""low"" dose 
(7.0+/-3.0 h) and ""high"" dose (7.4+/-2.0 h) hesperidin juices. The results of 
this study demonstrated that the bioavailability of hesperidin was modulated by 
enzymatic conversion to hesperetin-7-glucoside, thus changing the absorption 
site from the colon to the small intestine. This may affect future interventions 
concerning the health benefits of citrus flavonoids.

The phenolic and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values have been 
measured in six fresh and frozen vegetables (beet green, spinach, broccoli, 
carrot, onion, and celery) from the same cultivar by analyzing the whole juice 
(WJ) and the acetonic extract of the squeezed pulp. To exploit the effect of the 
acid environment on the stability and recovery of the phenolics, perchloric acid 
(PCA) was added directly to WJ and to the pulp before the extraction with 
acetone. In both fresh and frozen vegetables, PCA markedly increased the 
recovery of phenolics extracted from the pulp, but PCA had no effect on the WJ. 
Four of six frozen vegetables showed lower phenolic and ORAC values than the 
fresh vegetables, whereas in the other two cases, values were significantly 
higher compared to fresh samples. Among the fresh vegetables, beet green showed 
the highest ORAC and phenolic values; however, when measured in two different 
cultivars of beet green, the ORAC value showed as much as 4.5-fold variation, 
whereas total phenolics and flavonoids showed 1.2- and 3.5-fold variations, 
respectively. The results show that total phenolics and ORAC, compared in fresh 
and frozen vegetables, represent an index of the mildness of blanching in the 
industry of frozen vegetables and provide a measure of the gap in antioxidants 
in the diet of people who consume frozen instead of fresh vegetables. The plant 
genotype is an important source of variability in the ORAC value, which can be 
conveniently used to increase the intake of antioxidants from vegetables.

Vegetables are the most important sources of phenolics in the Mediterranean 
diet. Phenolics, especially flavonoids, are suggested as being essential 
bioactive compounds providing health benefits. In this study, twenty-seven 
vegetables, fifteen aromatic herbs and some spices consumed in Central Italy 
(the Marches region) were studied to reveal total phenolic, flavonoid and 
flavanol content as well as their antioxidant capacity measured by the oxygen 
radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. A comparison in terms of antioxidant 
capacity was made between different salads, as well as between salads to which 
aromatic herbs had been added. Lemon balm and marjoram at a concentration of 1.5 
% w/w increased by 150 % and 200 % respectively the antioxidant capacity of a 
salad portion. A 200 g portion of a salad enriched with marjoram corresponded to 
an intake of 200 (SD 10) mg phenolics and 4000 (SD 300) ORAC units (micromol 
Trolox equivalents). Olive oils and wine or apple vinegars were the salad 
dressings that provided the highest increase in antioxidant capacity. Among the 
spices tested, cumin and fresh ginger made the most significant contribution to 
the antioxidant capacity. The results are useful in surveying the antioxidant 
parameters of vegetables, herbs and spices produced and consumed in our 
geographical area as well as in quantifying the daily intake of phenolics and 
ORAC units. The results can be used in public health campaigns to stimulate the 
consumption of vegetables able to provide significant health protection in order 
to prevent chronic diseases.

A mandarin-type citrus fruit, ponkan (Citrus reticulata), was processed by 
in-line, chopper pulper, and hand-press extractions to investigate the effect of 
extraction method on the concentrations of bioactive compounds in processed 
juice. Concentrations of polymethoxylated flavones (tangeretin, nobiletin, and 
sinensetin) and beta-cryptoxanthin in juice, and inhibitory activities against 
arachidonate cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenases of the juice extract were 
analyzed. The juice processed by hand-press extraction contained the largest 
amounts of nobiletin (3.56 mg/100 mL), tangeretin (4.10 mg/100 mL), and 
sinensetin (0.13 mg/100 mL). Concentrations of beta-cryptoxanthin were 0.66, 
0.59, 0.55, and 0.50 mg/100 mL in chopper pulper, in-line (5/64 in.), in-line 
(8/64 in.) and hand-press juices, respectively. Both extracts of in-line juices 
showed greater inhibitory activity toward platelet 12-lipoxygenase than the 
others. The inhibitory effect of hand-press juice extract on platelet 
cyclooxygenase activity was remarkable among juice extracts. All juice extracts 
effectively inhibited polymorphonuclear 5-lipoxygenase activity at nearly the 
same rate.

Anthocyanins are water-soluble pigments that are liable for colors ranging from 
red to blue of most fruits, vegetables, and flowers. A novel and fast method was 
developed for the determination of five anthocyanins and free pelargonidin by 
high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to photodiode array detection. A 
10% formic acid and acetonitrile mixture was employed as mobile phase in the 
gradient elution mode. Mobile phase composition, column temperature, flow rate, 
injection volume, and column conditioning time were optimized by employing a 
stepwise strategy. Using a C18 core-shell column (100 × 4.6 mm, 2.7 μm), the 
separation of six analytes was accomplished in less than 9.5 min with a 
run-to-run analysis time of 19 min. The developed method was validated with 
respect to linearity (r > 0.9999), limit of detection, limit of quantification, 
intra-/interday precision (<2%), accuracy (98.6-104.4%), and specificity. 
Afterwards, the method was applied to the determination of anthocyanins present 
in 15 different samples including fruits, fruit juices, and fruit wines.

High-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) and mass spectrometric (MS) 
procedures were developed to determine lignans in flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) 
and chaparral (Larrea tridentata). Flaxseed contains high levels of 
phytoestrogens. Chaparral has been associated with acute nonviral toxic 
hepatitis and contains lignans that are structurally similar to known estrogenic 
compounds. Both flaxseed and chaparral products have been marketed as dietary 
supplements. A mild enzyme hydrolysis procedure to prevent the formation of 
artifacts in the isolation step was used in the determination of 
secoisolariciresinol in flaxseed products. HPLC with ultraviolet spectral (UV) 
or MS detection was used as the determinative steps. HPLC procedures with UV 
detection and mass spectrometry were developed to characterize the phenolic 
components, including lignans and flavonoids, of chaparral and to direct 
fractionation studies for the bioassays.

To fully investigate the effects of heat treatment on proteins and lipids in 
sheep milk, lipidomics and Astral-DIA proteomics combined with parallel reaction 
monitoring methods were used to analyze the changes of lipids and proteins after 
heat treatment at 65 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 15 s. A total of 79 and 381 
differential lipids and proteins were identified respectively. Lipidomics 
results show that Triacylglycerol (16:1_17:1_16:2) was unique in raw milk, 
whereas diacylglycerol (20:1_22:1) was unique in 95 °C group. Choline metabolism 
in cancer was the core metabolic pathway linked with heat treatment. 
Additionally, the collagen alpha-3(VI) chain protein (COL6A3), folate 
receptor-like domain-containing protein (FOLR1), and serpin domain-containing 
protein (JEQ12_008015) gradually disappeared with increasing heating 
temperature. The differentially expressed proteins were mainly associated with 
metabolic pathways. These analysis provide scientific connotation for the 
production of high quality dairy products and the healthy development of the 
dairy industry.

Cranberry, which is rich in polyphenols, including anthocyanins and 
proanthocyanidins, has been found to have various effects beneficial to human 
health, including prevention of urinary tract infections. These effects have 
been associated with polyphenols in the fruit. We investigated the excretion of 
anthocyanins in human urine after ingestion of cranberry juice. Eleven healthy 
volunteers consumed 200 ml of cranberry juice containing 650.8 microg total 
anthocyanins. Urine samples were collected within 24 h before and after 
consumption. Six of 12 anthocyanins identified in cranberry were quantified in 
human urine by HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization and tandem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS-MS). Among these, peonidin 3-O-galactoside, the second 
most plentiful anthocyanin in the juice, was found most abundantly in urine 
within 24 h, corresponding to 41.5 nmol (56.1% of total anthocyanins). The 
urinary levels of anthocyanins reached a maximum between 3 and 6 h after 
ingestion, and the recovery of total anthocyanins in the urine over 24 h was 
estimated to be 5.0% of the amount consumed. This study found high absorption 
and excretion of cranberry anthocyanins in human urine.

Changes occurring in the concentrations of alpha-tocopherol, total phenols, and 
complex phenols linked to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol (fractions FII and FIV) and 
p-hydroxyphenylethanol (FIII) during storage of virgin olive oil under 
environmental conditions were studied. Under diffused light, alpha-tocopherol 
was decomposed by 79% in 4 months, whereas <45% of the phenols were lost during 
the same period. Among the phenols, FII showed the least stability, and 
decreased by 72% in 6 months. Total phenols, FIII, and FIV recorded reductions 
in the range of 57-63% in 6 months. When the oil was stored in the dark, 
alpha-tocopherol, total phenols, FIII, and FIV exhibited similar profiles of 
degradation, reducing by 39-45% in the first 6 months and 50-62% in 12 months. 
FII was the least stable compound in the dark and recorded a loss of 64% in 6 
months and 79% in 12 months. The levels of the above antioxidants were further 
related to peroxide formation. Remaining levels of these compounds at PV = 20 
meq/kg ranged between 50 and 73% under diffused light and between 40 and 62% in 
the dark.

Four cultivars of strawberries (Senga Sengana, BFr77111, Elsanta, and Honeoye) 
were studied for their content of antioxidants, total antioxidant capacity, and 
low molecular weight carbohydrates in relation to harvest year, ripening stage, 
and cold storage. For ascorbic acid, chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, and total 
antioxidative capacity, measured in both water-soluble and water-insoluble 
extracts, there was a 2-5-fold variation among cultivars. Unripe berries 
contained lower concentrations of chlorogenic acid and p-coumaric acid and also 
quercetin and kaempferol compared with riper berries. During cold storage for up 
to 3 days, relatively few changes in the concentration of the different 
antioxidants occurred. The concentrations of several investigated parameters 
were interrelated, for example, for ascorbic acid and water-soluble antioxidant 
capacity and for ellagic acid and water-insoluble antioxidant capacity. The 
dominating sugars in strawberries were fructose and glucose, but considerable 
amounts of sucrose were also present, and their contents varied among cultivars, 
giving a predicted glycemic index of approximately 81. Verbascose, raffinose, 
and stachyose were found in only minor amounts. The study shows that the 
concentration of a number of bioactive compounds in strawberries varied 
according to cultivar, ripening stage, and storage. This information should make 
it possible to select strawberries with an optimal content of bioactive 
compounds.

Dietary phenols are antioxidants, and their consumption might contribute to the 
prevention of cardiovascular disease. Coffee and tea are major dietary sources 
of phenols. Dietary phenols are metabolized extensively in the body. Lack of 
quantitative data on their metabolites hinders a proper evaluation of the 
potential biological effects of dietary phenols in vivo. The aim of this study 
was to identify and quantify the phenolic acid metabolites of chlorogenic acid 
(major phenol in coffee), quercetin-3-rutinoside (major flavonol in tea) and 
black tea phenols in humans, and determine the site of metabolism. Healthy 
humans (n = 20) with an intact colon participated in a dietary controlled 
crossover study, and we identified and quantified approximately 60 potential 
phenolic acid metabolites in urine. Half of the ingested chlorogenic acid and 
43% of the tea phenols were metabolized to hippuric acid. Quercetin-3-rutinoside 
was metabolized mainly to phenylacetic acids, i.e., 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid 
(36%), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (8%) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic 
acid (5%). In contrast, in seven humans without a colon, we found only traces of 
phenolic acid metabolites in urine after they had ingested chlorogenic acid and 
quercetin-3-rutinoside. This implies that the colonic microflora convert most of 
these dietary phenols into metabolites that then reach the circulation. 
Metabolites of dietary phenols have lower antioxidant activity than their parent 
compounds; therefore, the contribution of dietary phenols to antioxidant 
activity in vivo might be lower than expected from in vitro tests.

Wheat bran is a conventional by-product of the wheat milling industry mainly 
used for animal feed. It is a rich and inexpensive source of phytonutrients, so 
is in demand for fibre-rich food products but creates quality issues when 
incorporated into bread. The purpose of this study was to characterize the 
physicochemical properties and phytochemical composition of different size durum 
bran fractions and show how they impact bread quality. Durum wheat (Triticum 
durum Desf.) was milled to create a coarse bran fraction (CB), which was further 
ground into a finer fraction (FB) which was sieved using four screens with 
apertures 425, 315, 250, 180, and <180 µm to create a particle size range of 
1497 to 115 µm. All fractions contained phytosterol with highest in the 180 and 
FB, while total phenolic acids and antioxidant capacity was highest in CB and 
425. Use of the fractions in a leavened common wheat (T. aestivum L.) bread 
formula at 10% incorporation negatively impacted bread loaf volume, colour, and 
texture compared to standard loaves, with CB having the least impact. Results 
suggest that to combine the highest phytochemical content with minimal impact on 
bread quality, bran particle size should be considered, with CB being the best 
choice.

Flaxseed lignan macromolecules (FLMs) are important polyphenols present in 
flaxseeds with interfacial adsorption behavior. However, FLMs are easily 
degraded during thermal treatment in emulsions, which further influences their 
interfacial properties and application. In this work, the interfacial properties 
of FLMs between oil and water were evaluated using compression isotherms and 
interfacial tension to investigate the regulation mechanism of FLMs and their 
heat-treated products on the stability of O/W emulsions. Furthermore, the 
improvement mechanism of FLM heat-treated products on the physicochemical 
stability of flaxseed oil emulsions was clarified. Studies showed that thermal 
degradation occurred on terminal phenolic acids in FLMs when treated under 100 
and 150 °C (FLM-100 and FLM-150) without any decrease in antioxidant activity. 
FLM-100 and FLM-150 improved the physicochemical stability of sunflower lecithin 
(S90)-stabilized flaxseed oil emulsions and reduced the concentration of 
hydroperoxides and TBARS by 26.7% and 80% (p < 0.05), respectively, during 
storage. This was due to the high interfacial anchoring of FLM-100 and FLM-150, 
which further strengthened the interface of oil droplets and improved the 
interfacial antioxidant effect of FLMs. This implies that FLM-100 and FLM-150 
could act as new efficient antioxidants for application in food emulsions.

Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) is a nutrient-rich plant valued for its 
medicinal and dietary applications that accumulates high levels of cellular 
metabolites. The root system demonstrates potent antioxidant properties. In this 
study, a single-nucleus resolution transcriptomic atlas of the Tartary buckwheat 
root system was generated using fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting. The 
analysis identified 10 major cell types and 22 cell clusters involved in root 
development, along with newly defined marker genes. The developmental 
trajectories of specific root cell types, such as root hairs and cortex cells, 
were mapped, and the key regulatory networks underlying their development were 
constructed. The flavonoid biosynthetic pathway of Tartary buckwheat was 
analyzed at the single-cell level. Furthermore, the core regulatory factor 
FtHD2B in Tartary buckwheat roots promoted the response of roots to stress by 
positively regulating the synthesis of flavonoids. This study provides the 
single-nucleus resolution transcriptomic dataset for the root system of a 
Polygonaceae plant, offering clues for understanding root cell differentiation 
and root system development within this family.

In the modern era, anthropogenic activities have led to an alarming increase in 
soil salinity, posing significant challenges to agriculture. Salinity not only 
adversely affects crop growth but also contributes to water pollution. Na stress 
reduces plant growth through osmotic effects, limiting water uptake and causing 
ion toxicity and oxidative damage. Brassinosteroids, a class of plant steroids, 
are well known for their roles in plant development and enhancing tolerance to 
various environmental stressors. This study aimed to investigate the impact of 
28-homobrassinolide (28-HBL) application, both through seed priming and foliar 
application on Phaseolus vulgaris L. (common beans) subjected to sodium fluoride 
(NaF) stress. In pot experiments, soil was treated with 200 ppm NaF via aqueous 
solution 15 days before sowing followed by seed priming and foliar application 
with two concentrations of 28-HBL (40 and 60 ppm). Seed priming with 28-HBL 
enhanced total phenolic content and facilitated the uptake of essential mineral 
nutrients (K+, Zn2+, and Mg2+), counteracting the adverse effects of NaF on 
plant growth. Furthermore, the combined treatment of seed priming and foliar 
application of 28-HBL significantly increased protein content (24%) and proline 
content (61%), with the highest levels observed in the 28-HBL SP+FS-60 ppm 
group. Gas exchange characteristics, chlorophyll a (66%), chlorophyll b (65%), 
and carotenoids (75%) were all significantly improved in plants subjected to 
SP+FS-60 ppm 28-HBL treatment compared to those treated solely with NaF stress. 
28-HBL effectively mitigated NaF induced stress by modulating ascorbic acid 
content and DPPH and enhancing the plant's antioxidant system, improving growth 
and biomass production. Additionally, the study investigated the antioxidant 
capacity of 28-HBL under salt stress, highlighting its potential as a valuable 
tool for enhancing P. vulgaris cultivation in fluoride-polluted soil. These 
findings underscore the potential of 28-homobrassinolide as a promising strategy 
for addressing soil salinity stress in agricultural settings.

Plain Language Summary: Prior research has mostly focused on how 
brassinosteroids helps plants deal with environmental stressors. However, we 
employ foliar application and seed priming to administer 28-homobrassinolide 
(28-HBL). Our research showed that exogenously administered 28-homobrassinolide 
(28-HBL) reduces sodium fluoride stress and improves the development of 
Phaseolus vulgaris L. (common beans) seedlings. The findings of this 
investigation lend credence to the use of 28-homobrassinolide (28-HBL) in crop 
stress management.

Epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested that diesel exhaust 
particles (DEPs), which generate reactive oxygen species, may be involved in the 
recent increase in the prevalence of lung diseases. Cacao liquor 
proanthocyanidins (CPs) are naturally occurring polyphenols with antioxidative 
activities. We carried out a study in mice to investigate the effects of dietary 
supplementation of CPs on lung injury induced by intratracheal administration of 
DEPs (500 microg/body). Dietary supplementation with 1.0 percent CPs inhibited 
DEP-induced lung injury, characterized by neutrophil sequestration and edema. 
Immunohistochemical analyses showed that CPs prevented enhanced expression of 
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 caused 
by DEPs in the lung injury. Numerous adducts of nitrotyrosine, N-(hexanonyl) 
lysine, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and 8-OHdG were also observed immunohistochemically 
in the lungs of mice treated with DEPs. However, these indicators of oxidative 
stress were barely visible in mice pretreated with CP supplementation. In 
addition, the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in the lung was 
decreased by CP supplementation in the presence of DEPs. These results suggest 
that CPs inhibit DEP-induced lung injury by reducing oxidative stress, in 
association with a reduction in the expression of adhesion molecules.

Furocoumarins represent a family of natural food constituents with phototoxic 
and photomutagenic properties. They are found mainly in plants belonging to the 
Rutaceae and Umbilliferae such as celery, carrots, and parsnips. Parsnips 
(Pastinaca sativa L.) have become more and more popular as a vegetable, e.g., as 
a constituent of or ingredient in baby food. Previous work has shown that 
microbial infection of parsnip roots can result in a dramatic increase in 
furocoumarin levels. In this study, freshly harvested parsnips were stored as 
whole roots, pieces (cubes), or homogenate at +4 degrees C or -18 degrees C over 
various time periods under standard conditions. It was found that furocoumarin 
concentrations (sum of five furocoumarins: angelicin, isopimpinellin, 
5-methoxypsoralen, 8-methoxypsoralen, and psoralen) in freshly harvested 
parsnips, analyzed by HPLC after extraction with diethyl ether and sequential 
solid phase (reversed-phase and silica) extraction, was generally lower than 2.5 
mg/kg, and storage of parsnips in any form investigated at -18 degrees C over up 
to 50 days did not lead to a marked increase in furocoumarin levels. In 
contrast, storage of whole parsnips, but not of cubes or homogenate, at +4 
degrees C resulted in a marked biphasic increase of furocoumarin concentrations 
after 7 and 38 days of storage up to levels of about 40 mg/kg. A dramatic 
increase in furocoumarin concentrations up to 566 mg/kg was observed when whole 
parsnips obtained from the market were kept at room temperature over 53 days, 
resulting in a visible microbial (mold) infection. Baby food products from the 
German market containing parsnips as an ingredient or constituent showed 
furocoumarin levels < or =0.41 mg/kg, suggesting that properly stored 
roots/preparations have been used. It is recommended that, after harvesting, 
parsnips be kept at -18 degrees C or under other conditions that prevent 
microbial infections.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the phenolic antioxidant and squalene 
content in a range of olive and seed oils. A mean of 290 +/- 38 (SEM) mg 
squalene/100 g was detected. However, while there was a weak significant 
difference between extra virgin (424 +/- 21 mg/kg) and refined virgin (340 +/- 
31 mg/100 g; P<0.05) olive oils, highly significant differences were evident 
between extra virgin olive oils (P<0.0001) refined virgin olive oils (P<0.0001) 
and seed oils (24 +/- 5 mg/100 g). While seed oils were devoid, on average, the 
olive oils contained 196 +/- 19 mg/kg total phenolics as judged by HPLC 
analysis, but the value for extra virgin (232 +/- 15 mg/kg) was significantly 
higher than that of refined virgin olive oil (62 +/- 12 mg/kg; P<0.0001). 
Appreciable quantities of simple phenols (hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol) were 
detected in olive oils, with significant differences between extravirgin (41.87 
+/- 6.17) and refined virgin olive oils (4.72 +/- 215; P<0.01). The major linked 
phenols were secoiridoids and lignans. Although extra virgin contained higher 
concentrations of secoiridoids (27.72 +/- 6.84) than refined olive oils (9.30 
+/- 3.81) this difference was not significant. On the other hand, the 
concentration of lignans was significantly higher (P<0.001) in extra virgin 
(41.53 +/- 3.93) compared to refined virgin olive oils (7.29 +/- 2.56). All 
classes of phenolics were shown to be potent antioxidants. In future 
epidemiologic studies, both the nature and source of olive oil consumed should 
be differentiated in ascertaining cancer risk.

Because olives represent an important component of the Mediterranean diet, it is 
necessary to establish unequivocal identification and quantitation of the major 
potential antioxidant phenolic compounds they contain. The major phenolic 
antioxidants in two types of brined olives were isolated and purified by 
semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography. Structural analysis was 
conducted using UV spectrophotometry, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy. In particular, completely assigned 1H and 13C NMR data 
are presented and errors in literature data are corrected. The data show that 
tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, 3-(3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid (dihydrocaffeic 
acid), dihydro-p-coumaric acid (phloretic acid), the phenylpropanoid glucosides 
acteoside (verbascoside) and isoacteoside, along with the flavonoids luteolin 
and apigenin are major components of the phenolic fraction of brined black 
olives. Brined green olives contain only hydroxytyrosol and traces of other 
minor phenolics. Brined olives contain even higher concentrations of phenolic 
antioxidants than olive oil and may, therefore, be more important modulators of 
cancer chemopreventive activity.

Several polyphenols have been tested in grape berries from Spain. The flavonoid 
content is important because of the pharmacological properties of these 
compounds, whereas resveratrol has been proved to be an antifungal, 
antiinflammatory and an anticarcinogenic compound. A reversed-phase HPLC method 
has been developed and applied to determine resveratrol, quercetine, quercitrine 
and rutine content in several grape berries samples in a single analysis. 
Covering the grapes with a preservative paper yields a healthier product, but 
one which has a lower polyphenol content than unprotected grapes.

A valid method using liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray 
ionization (ESI) ion trap mass spectrometry was established for the study of the 
absorbed and metabolic components of a Chinese medicine 'Shuangdan' granule in 
rat plasma after oral administration. The plasma samples were acidified with 1M 
hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) of two-fold volume 
for three times. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a Zorbax 
SB-C18 column with a linear gradient whereas 0.1% acetic acid/water/acetonitrile 
was used as mobile phase. Mass spectra were acquired in both negative and 
positive modes. More than 20 components including 16 components from 'Shuangdan' 
granule and 5 metabolites were simultaneously identified by comparing their mass 
spectra and retention behavior with reference compounds or literature data. The 
results proved that the established method could be used to identify the 
structure of active components responsible for the pharmacological effects of 
'Shuangdan' granule.

Spinach leaves harvested at three maturity stages from eight commercial 
cultivars (CC) and eight advanced breeding lines (ABL) were evaluated for oxygen 
radical absorbing capacity (ORAC), total phenolics, and flavonoid composition 
and content. ABL had higher levels of total phenolics, total flavonoids, and 
ORAC than CC. Midmaturity spinach leaves had higher levels of total phenolics, 
total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity than immature and mature leaves. The 
contents of individual flavonoids varied in response to maturation, with the 
predominant glucuronated flavones decreasing and patuletin and spinacetin 
derivatives increasing. Both total phenolics and total flavonoids correlated 
well with ORAC (r(xy)() = 0.78 and 0.81, respectively) demonstrating that 
flavonoids were major contributors to antioxidant capacity. Our results indicate 
that spinach genotypes should be harvested at the midmaturity stage for 
consumers to benefit from elevated levels of health promoting flavonoids present 
in the leaves. Additionally, plant breeders can select for increased phenolic 
content to increase antioxidant capacity of spinach genotypes.

The effects of genetic, pre-harvest (season of harvest, spear diameter, spear 
portion and spear tip color) and post-harvest factors (storage and domestic 
preparation practices, e.g., peeling and cooking) on total phenolic, flavonoid 
and ascorbic acid content of white asparagus spears and their correlation with 
antioxidant capacity (DPPH and FRAP) were studied. Results showed that genetic 
material was important for the total phenolic content but not season of harvest, 
spear diameter or storage. Violet spear tips and apical spear portions showed 
the largest amount of total phenolics. Peeling did not affect total phenolics in 
fresh asparagus, whereas it reduced their content in stored asparagus, while 
cooking resulted in an increase in both fresh and stored asparagus. However, the 
soluble extract of total phenolics and flavonoids were minor and the missing 
significance of phenolics and flavonoids in antioxidant capacity of white 
asparagus spears depends on these small amounts.

An HPLC method, using detection after postcolumn derivatization with 
p-dimethylaminocynnamaldehyde (DMACA), was developed for the quantitative 
analysis of individual flavanols in food. This method was applied to flavanol 
determination in 56 different kinds of Spanish food products, including fruit, 
vegetables, legumes, beverages (cider, coffee, beer, tea, and wine), and 
chocolate. The determined compounds corresponded to the catechins and 
proanthocyanidin dimers and trimers usually present in food and, therefore, they 
were representative of the flavanols of low degree of polymerization consumed 
with the diet. The data generated could be used for calculation of the dietary 
intake of either individual or total flavanols, which would allow the further 
establishment of epidemiological correlations with the incidence of chronic 
diseases. Similar flavanol profiles were found in the different samples of a 
similar type of product, even though important variations could exist in the 
concentrations of total and individual flavanols among them. This was attributed 
to factors such as sample origin, stage of ripeness, post-harvesting 
conservation, and processing. Total flavanol contents varied from nondetectable 
in most of the vegetables to 184 mg/100 g found in a sample of broad bean. 
Substantial amounts were also found in some fruits, such as plum and apple, as 
well as in tea and red wine. Epicatechin was the most abundant flavanol, 
followed by catechin and procyanidin B2. In general, catechins were found in all 
the flavanol-containing products, but the presence of gallocatechins was only 
relevant in pomegranate, broad bean, lentil, grape, wine, beer, and tea, and 
most of the berries. Galloyled flavanols were only detected in strawberry, 
medlar, grape, and tea.

The aim of this study was to quantify the contents of individual quercetin 
glycosides in red, yellow and chartreuse onion by High Performance Liquid 
Chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Acid hydrolysis of individual quercetin 
glycosides using 6 M hydrochloric acid guided to identify and separate quercetin 
7,4'-diglucoside, quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin 4'-glucoside, and quercetin. 
The contents of total quercetin glycosides varied extensively among three 
varieties (ranged from 16.10 to 103.93 mg/g DW). Quercetin was the predominant 
compound that accounted mean 32.21 mg/g DW in red onion (43.6% of the total) and 
127.92 mg/g DW in chartreuse onion (78.3% of the total) followed by quercetin 
3-glucoside (28.83 and 24.16 mg/g DW) respectively. Quercetin 3-glucoside levels 
were much higher in yellow onion (43.85 mg/g DW) followed by quercetin 
30.08 mg/g DW. Quercetin 4'-glucoside documented the lowest amount that 
documented mean 2.4% of the total glycosides. The varied contents of glycosides 
present in the different onion varieties were significant.

Eight commercial Italian vini novelli (red wines prepared by carbonic maceration 
and supposed to be consumed within three months from their wine-making) were 
evaluated for their total antioxidant activity. The wines had an average total 
phenol content (1605.4 +/- 337.4 mg/L gallic acid equivalents) lower than that 
of wines prepared by traditional maceration and consumable after aging (2057. 3 
+/- 524.0 mg/L gallic acid equivalents). The average flavanol content (424.7 +/- 
121.3 mg/L catechin equivalents) and the total antioxidant activity (16.8 +/- 
3.8 mmol/L Trolox equivalents) of vini novelli were higher than the 
corresponding values (382.7 +/- 174.5 mg/L catechin equivalents and 12.3 +/- 3.3 
mmol/L Trolox equivalents) found for aged wines. Three couples of experimental 
wines were prepared from the same grapes by traditional or carbonic maceration. 
These wines showed a different phenolic pattern, anthocyanins being more 
abundant in vini novelli. However, the average total antioxidant activities of 
the wines were similar, suggesting that aging (and not the wine-making 
technique) is the main factor influencing the antioxidant activity of red wines.

The optimization and validation of a protocol for the quantification of six 
dietary lignans, i.e., secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, lariciresinol, 
pinoresinol, medioresinol, and syringaresinol, in food are presented. The method 
incorporates isotope dilution to ensure correct accuracy and precision, 
introducing the utilization of individual stable 13C3-labeled lignans. To 
demonstrate the potential of this new method, preliminary results of the levels 
of dietary lignans in selected foods are presented. It is concluded that the 
method fulfils the reliability criteria and can be applied to the analysis of 
the most common lignans in human food, being an essential asset to establish the 
intake of lignans in a determined population and their relation with disease 
prevention.

Lignans constitute a group of phytochemicals widely distributed in the human 
diet. Once ingested, most dietary lignans are metabolized by the gut microflora 
to enterolactone and enterodiol, also known as enterolignans. Together with 
isoflavones and coumestrol, enterolignans have been traditionally classified as 
phytoestrogens, plant-derived compounds that exhibit estrogen-like activity. In 
addition to a higher intake of vegetables, many studies have suggested that the 
presence of phytoestrogens in the Japanese diet is one of the factors that might 
explain the reduced incidence of certain chronic diseases in Japanese 
populations compared with Western countries. Being a vegetable-based diet, 
exposure to dietary lignans should be high, but to assess this exposure, a 
lignan food database is required. Stable isotope-dilution gas chromatography 
coupled with mass spectrometry was used to quantify six plant lignans in 86 food 
items commonly consumed in Japan. These data will complement the previous 
databases and most importantly expand the knowledge of occurrence of lignans in 
food to Eastern diets.

The influence of 2 weeks and 3 months of dark storage upon light-induced 
chlorogenic acid accumulation within tuber tissue of four potato cultivars and 
upon 5-, 4-, and 3-caffeoylquinic acid concentrations within cv. King Edward was 
determined. Storage period significantly affected (P < 0.05) the magnitude of 
the light-induced chlorogenic acid response with accumulation rates 3-4 times 
higher in tubers exposed to light after 2 weeks compared with those placed under 
light after 3 months. Comparison of chlorogenic acid concentrations in controls 
after 2 and 3 months of dark storage indicated that tuber chlorogenic 
concentrations decline during prolonged cold store at 5 degrees C. Rates of 
accumulation in response to light were cultivar-dependent with cv. Fianna the 
most light-sensitive and cv. Maris Piper relatively light-insensitive. In 
virtually all cases exposure to sodium and fluorescent light promoted higher 
rates of accumulation than did exposure to high-pressure mercury light sources. 
Chlorogenic acid values steadily increased over 15 days of illumination with, in 
the majority of cases, no indication of cessation. Light exposure increased 5-, 
4-, and 3-caffeoylquinic acid accumulation rates in cv. King Edward. 
Irrespective of storage period and light source, ratios of 
5-:4-:3-caffeoylquinic acid were ca. 85:15:0 at day 0 and 52:42:6 by day 15.

Several recent articles have reported a significant antioxidant capacity of 
cereal products, determined in methanolic and ethanolic extracts. The aim of 
this work was to conduct an assessment of the antioxidant capacity of cereals 
using both chemical and in vitro digestive enzymatic extraction of antioxidants. 
Ferric reducing power (FRAP) and free radical scavenging capacity (DPPH) methods 
were used to determine the antioxidant capacity in wheat flour, bread, raw and 
boiled rice, wheat bran, and oat bran. The most efficient antioxidant extraction 
was achieved by using successively acidic methanol/water (50:50 v/v, pH 2) and 
acetone/water (70:30 v/v). The antioxidant capacity in these extracts ranged 
from 1.1 to 4.4 micromol Trolox/g dw. A significant amount of hydrolyzable 
phenolics with a high antioxidant capacity (from 5 to 108 micromol Trolox/g dw) 
was found in the residues of this aqueous-organic extraction. The antioxidant 
capacities of these nonextractable polyphenols are usually ignored in the 
literature, although they may have an antioxidant role in the gastrointestinal 
tract, especially after colonic fermentation, and may be fermentated to active 
metabolites. On the other hand, in vitro digestive enzymatic extracts obtained 
by enzymatic treatments that mimic conditions in the gastrointestinal tract 
showed that the amount of antioxidants released by the cereal matrix into the 
human intestine may be higher than the one that can be expected from 
measurements in the usual aqueous-organic extracts.

Ninety-four samples of Asturian natural cider were analyzed for titratable and 
volatile acidities, pH, alcoholic, total polyphenol, and acidic polysaccharide 
contents, nonvolatile acids, polyalcohols, residual sugars, and major volatile 
compounds. A partial least-squares regression analysis (PLR-1) was performed to 
correlate the chemical composition and the origin of the raw material, the cider 
samples being grouped into two categories: an ""odd"" class, cider made from 
foreign apples (1995 and 1997), and an ""even"" class, ciders made from Asturian 
apples (1996 and 1998). The mathematical model has a multiple linear correlation

Prunes, which are industrially obtained by dehydrating fresh plums at 85-90 
degrees C for 18 h, contain higher levels of phenolic compounds than most other 
fruits. Prune phenolics have shown beneficial effects on human health. Reports 
are available in the literature on ascorbic acid, phenol composition, and 
antioxidant activity of fresh plums and prunes, but there is a lack of 
publications on the influence of drying parameters on the phenolic compounds and 
antioxidant activity. A study was carried out on two plum cultivars using two 
sets of air-drying temperatures: (i) air temperature at 85 degrees C until 50% 
of prune moisture level and then the temperature was lowered to 70 degrees C; 
(ii) air temperature at 60 degrees C. Whole fresh and dried fruits were assessed 
for phenolics (catechins, hydroxycinnamic acids, anthocyanins, and flavonols), 
ascorbic acid, and antioxidant activity (all parameters were calculated on a dry 
matter basis). Analysis of data shows that chlorogenic and neochlorogenic acid 
changes were affected by both process parameters and cultivar. Drying destroyed 
anthocyanins, and there was a significant decrease in flavonols. Ascorbic acid 
was drastically reduced in relation to process temperature. The most striking 
result was that drying at 85 degrees C doubled antioxidant activity in both 
cultivars, while contradictory results were found for 60 degrees C processed 
plums.

A dispersive solid phase extraction-high performance liquid chromatographic 
(HPLC) method was established for the simultaneous determination of 2,4-D, 
thiabendazole, 2-naphthol, o-phenyl phenol, diphenyl ether and biphenyl in the 
fruits and vegetables. The samples were vortexed for extraction with 
acetonitrile containing sodium chloride and anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The 
acetonitrile extraction was purified by acidic alumina dispersed solid phase 
extraction. The analysis was performed on an Agilent TC C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 
mm, 5 microm) and an ultraviolet detector at 235 nm with a mobile phase of 
methanol-0.02 mol/L (pH 6) potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution, at a flow 
rate of 1.0 mL/min with gradient elution. Good linearities were observed in the 
range of 0.5-20 mg/L with correlation coefficients greater than 0.99. The 
average recoveries of the six preservatives in fruits and vegetables were in the 
range of 84.2% -99. 1% at three spiked levels of 1, 2 and 10 mg/kg (n = 6) and 
the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were in the range of 1.67%-10.3%. The 
limits of quantification were 1 mg/kg. This method is simple, accurate and 
suitable for the determination of the six preservatives in fruits and 
vegetables.

The physicochemical properties of apple juice from 13 apple varieties were 
correlated with the structural features of isolated apple pectin populations. 
Mathematical models explaining these structural properties, revealed variations 
in pectins as present in alcohol insoluble solids (AIS), water-soluble solids 
(WSS), and chelating soluble solids (ChSS). Significant differences in turbidity 
(89.00-4129 NTU), particle size (59.75-218.01 μm in D[4, 3]), and titratable 
acid (0.13 to 0.90 %) were observed, while pH, total soluble solids, and 
ζ-potential showed less variation. Juice yield (54.85-63.35 %) was inversely 
correlated with AIS, WSS, and ChSS content. Juice ζ-potential was positively 
correlated with the degree of methyl-esterification, methyl-ester distribution 
patterns, and the side chain sugar ratios of WSS pectin fractions. Juice quality 
as represented by juice clarity, texture and stability was significantly 
influenced by the diverse structure's features like sugar composition, 
methyl-esterification level and distribution of endogenous pectin. A partial 
least squares (PLS) regression model effectively predicted juice properties 
based on pectin characteristics. These findings underscore the importance of 
pectin structure in determining apple juice quality and provide a valuable 
framework for the juice industry to enhance quality control and inform cultivar 
selection.

The antioxidant dihydrocaffeic acid is a dietary constituent and a microbial 
metabolite of flavonoids. Orally administered to rats, dihydrocaffeic acid was 
very rapidly absorbed most probably by the gastric or duodenal epithelium and 
excreted in urine as free and conjugated forms. LC-MS2 analysis of plasma and 
urine samples allowed confident identification of the dihydrocaffeic acid 
metabolites. The parent compound was glucuronidated, sulphated or methylated, on 
one of the hydroxyl groups present on its phenyl ring. All the dihydrocaffeic 
acid metabolites peaked in plasma within the first 30min following ingestion, 
suggesting a metabolism possibly by the gastric or duodenal cells and by the 
liver. Using in vitro and ex vivo models of the intestinal epithelium and the 
liver, the identity and source of the metabolites detected in vivo were 
examined. The data obtained suggest that, in rats, intestinal cells are more 
able to glucuronidate dihydrocaffeic acid, whereas liver favours sulphation. 
Moreover, glucuronidation, sulphation and methylation seem to be 
regio-selective, preferably on the 3-OH of dihydrocaffeic acid. The methyl 
conjugate, dihydroferulic acid, was shown to be oxidized into ferulic acid by 
intestinal and hepatic cells, which were also able to perform the reverse 
reaction, the reduction of ferulic acid into dihydroferulic acid. As a 
conclusion, the main form of dihydrocaffeic acid circulating in plasma after its 
ingestion is a mixture of different primary and secondary metabolites.

Puerarin (daidzein-8-C-glucoside) is the major bioactive isoflavone of kudzu 
root (the root of Pueraria lobata). Its metabolic fate, however, is not 
well-known. In this study, a sensitive and specific LC-ESI-MS/MS method for the 
determination of puerarin and its metabolites daidzein, dihydrodaidzein, and 
equol was developed for their analysis in biological samples. Two new 
metabolites of puerarin, mono- and dihydroxylated derivatives, were detected in 
the urine and feces of rats after oral administration. The persistence of 
puerarin in blood and urine as the principal metabolic form for the period of 
4-72 h after oral administration suggested that puerarin is rapidly absorbed 
from the intestine without metabolism. Its presence in organs such as the brain 
suggests that this glucoside may enter tissues by specific transport pathways. 
Study of these metabolites may provide further understanding of the health 
beneficial effects of puerarin in kudzu dietary supplements.

Proanthocyanidin rich plant extracts derived from grape seed extract (GSE), 
hawthorn and cranberry are on markets for their preventive effects against 
cardiovascular diseases and uroinfections in woman. However, the importance of 
these health beneficial effects of these botanicals remains elusive due to 
incomplete understanding of uptake, metabolism and bioavailability of 
proanthocyanidins in vivo. In the present study rats were given GSE orally (300 
mg/kg, twice a day) and blood and urine were collected over a 24 h period. 
Monomeric catechins and their methylated metabolites, and proanthocyanidins up 
to trimers were detected in blood samples treated with GSE using LC-MS/MS 
operating in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. A new tetramethylated 
metabolite of dimeric proanthocyanidin (m/z 633) in GSE-treated urine was 
tentatively identified. Using LC-MS/MS, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were 
identified in the brain conclusively. These data suggested that GSE catechins 
cross the blood brain barrier and may be responsible for the neuroprotective 
effects of GSE.

Dietary polyphenolics can be converted into smaller phenolic acids (PA) by 
microorganisms in the colon and may contribute to health benefits associated 
with the parent polyphenolics. Urinary excretion of 18 PA and their conjugates 
was studied, using HPLC-MS/MS, in rats fed AIN93G-based diets containing 5% (dry 
weight basis) of either cranberry (CB), blueberry (BB), or black raspberry 
(BRB). Hippuric, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic, and 
4-hydroxybenzoic acids were excreted in greatest quantity in the urine over a 24 
h period in all diets. Primary PA excreted in the berry diets were 
4-hydroxycinnamic acid for CB; chlorogenic, ferulic, and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic 
acids for BB; and 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic, 3-hydroxybenzoic, and 
3-hydroxycinnamic acids for BRB. PA were present in conjugated form with 
cinnamic acid derivatives being 50-70% and phenylacetic acid derivatives 
conjugated <10%. Conjugated, and not just the free, PA are significant 
contributors to total urinary excretion.

Extracts of aromatic plants of Greek origin were examined as potential sources 
of phenolic compounds. RP-HPLC with UV detection was employed for the 
identification and quantification of the phenolic antioxidants, present in 
methanolic extracts. The most abundant phenolic acids were ferulic acid (1.1-280

(+)-Catechin and quercetin were the most abundant flavonoids. Apigenin and 
luteolin were detected in high amounts in Menta pulegium and Thymus vulgaris, 
respectively. The antioxidant capacity was determined, in dried ground plants 
and in their methanol extracts, with the Rancimat test using sunflower oil as 
substrate. Both pulverized plants and extracts showed antioxidant capacity. 
Total phenolic content in the extracts was determined spectrometrically 
according to the Folin-Ciocalteu assay and ranged from 1 to 21 mg of gallic 
acid/100 g of dry sample. Antimicrobial activity of the extracts against 
selected microbes was also conducted in this study.

To fully investigate the effects of heat treatment on proteins and lipids in 
sheep milk, lipidomics and Astral-DIA proteomics combined with parallel reaction 
monitoring methods were used to analyze the changes of lipids and proteins after 
heat treatment at 65 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 15 s. A total of 79 and 381 
differential lipids and proteins were identified respectively. Lipidomics 
results show that Triacylglycerol (16:1_17:1_16:2) was unique in raw milk, 
whereas diacylglycerol (20:1_22:1) was unique in 95 °C group. Choline metabolism 
in cancer was the core metabolic pathway linked with heat treatment. 
Additionally, the collagen alpha-3(VI) chain protein (COL6A3), folate 
receptor-like domain-containing protein (FOLR1), and serpin domain-containing 
protein (JEQ12_008015) gradually disappeared with increasing heating 
temperature. The differentially expressed proteins were mainly associated with 
metabolic pathways. These analysis provide scientific connotation for the 
production of high quality dairy products and the healthy development of the 
dairy industry.

Virgin olive oils from percolation (first extraction) have been compared with 
the corresponding oils from centrifugation (second extraction). The former were 
characterized by (i) higher contents of total phenols, o-diphenols, 
hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol-aglycons, tocopherols, trans-2-hexenal, total volatiles, 
and waxes; (ii) higher values of resistance to autoxidation and of turbidity; 
(iii) higher sensory scores; (iv) higher ratios of campesterol/stigmasterol, 
trans-2-hexenal/hexanal, and trans-2-hexenal/total volatiles; (v) lower contents 
of chlorophylls, pheophytins, sterols, and aliphatic and triterpene alcohols; 
(vi) lower alcoholic index and color indices; (vii) similar values of acidity, 
peroxide index, and UV (ultraviolet) spectrophotometric indices; (viii) similar 
percentages of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, triglycerides, and 
diglycerides; and (ix) similar values of glyceridic indices. Stigmastadienes, 
trans-oleic, trans-linoleic, and trans-linolenic acid isomers were not detected 
in the two genuine oil kinds. Hence, the qualitative level of the first 
extraction oil was superior to the second extraction one.

derived from the most important blood and blond varieties grown in Italy. 
Soluble solids, acidity, and anthocyanins were also determined. Hydroxycinnamic 
acids were more abundant in blood orange than in blond juices. Ferulic acid was 
the major component in all cases, but the distribution of the four acids was 
typical in each variety. Discriminant analysis of the experimental results 
showed that these acids could be used as markers of blood and blond varieties. 
The statistical model was used to recognize some mixtures of blood and blond 
juices.

Several fresh orange juices, obtained from five different Citrus sinensis (L.) 
Osbeck varieties (three pigmented varieties, Moro, Sanguinello, and Tarocco, and 
two blond varieties, Valencia late and Washington navel), were subjected to 
antioxidant profile determination (including total polyphenols, flavanones, 
anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, and ascorbic acid). The antioxidant 
activity of these juices was then assessed by means of different ""in vitro"" 
tests (bleaching of the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical; 
peroxidation, induced by the water-soluble radical initiator 
2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride, on mixed 
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/linoleic acid unilamellar vesicles; scavenging 
activity against nitric oxide; total antioxidant status). All orange juices 
tested showed an evident antioxidant effect. Our findings indicate the 
following: (1) the antioxidant efficiency of orange juices may be attributed, in 
a significant part at least, to their content of total phenols, (2) while 
ascorbic acid seems to play a minor role; (3) the antioxidant activity of orange 
juices is related not only to structural features of phytochemicals contained in 
them, but also to their capability to interact with biomembranes; (4) finally, 
as to pigmented juices, their antioxidant efficiency appears to be widely 
influenced by the anthocyanin level. One could speculate that the supply of 
natural antioxidant phenols through daily consumption of orange juice might 
provide additional protection against in vivo oxidation of cellular 
biomolecules.

Quantitative analysis of anthocyanins was performed on a series of blood orange 
juices according to various spectrophotometric and HPLC methods, and the causes 
for different concentration resulting from the application of such procedures 
were investigated. Spectrophotometric methods utilizing aqueous ethanol as a 
solvent provided an anthocyanin content higher than that determined by HPLC. 
Discrepancies were ascribed to the use of impure standards and/or unsuitable 
calibration lines. The most consistent results with the HPLC findings were 
obtained by a method utilizing water as a solvent and cyanidin-3-glucoside as a 
standard. Actual concentration of anthocyanins in blood orange juice was 
remarkably lower than that currently determined by procedures used in the juice 
producing factories.

Stilbenes have been shown to have cancer chemopreventive activity and to protect 
lipoproteins from oxidative damage. A method is described for their direct 
determination in different types of wine using high-performance liquid 
chromatography with ultraviolet detection. In a survey of 120 commercial wines 
from Portugal and France, the highest concentrations of stilbenes were found in 
red wines. The glucosides of resveratrol were present in higher concentrations 
than the free isomers. Isolation from wine and characterization of 
trans-astringin in a large quantity are described for the first time.

A study was conducted to determine the presence of resveratrol, pterostilbene, 
and piceatannol in Vaccinium berries. Samples representing selections and 
cultivars of 10 species from Mississippi, North Carolina, Oregon, and Canada 
were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Resveratrol was found in 
Vaccinium angustifolium (lowbush blueberry), Vaccinium arboretum (sparkleberry), 
Vaccinium ashei (rabbiteye blueberry), Vaccinium corymbosum (highbush 
blueberry), Vaccinium elliottii (Elliott's blueberry), Vaccinium macrocarpon 
(cranberry), Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry), Vaccinium stamineum (deerberry), 
Vaccinium vitis-ideae var. vitis-ideae (lingonberry), and Vaccinium vitis-ideae 
var. minor (partridgeberry) at levels between 7 and 5884 ng/g dry sample. 
Lingonberry was found to have the highest content, 5884 ng/g dry sample, 
comparable to that found in grapes, 6471 ng/g dry sample. Pterostilbene was 
found in two cultivars of V. ashei and in V. stamineum at levels of 99-520 ng/g 
dry sample. Piceatannol was found in V. corymbosum and V. stamineum at levels of 
138-422 ng/g dry sample. These naturally occurring stilbenes, known to be strong 
antioxidants and to have cancer chemopreventive activities, will add to the 
purported health benefits derived from the consumption of these small fruits.

Tea is a complex mixture containing a range of compounds from simple phenolics 
to complex thearubigins, many of which have well-recognized antioxidant 
properties. This paper describes the application of high-performance liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS(n)) methods for the rapid and routine 
analysis of more than 30 phenolics in tea. Green and black tea infusions were 
injected directly onto a reversed phase HPLC column, and the phenolics eluted 
using two different mobile phase gradients, one optimized to resolve catechin 
derivatives and the other, flavonols and theaflavins. Compounds, identified on 
the basis of their retention time, absorbance spectrum, and MS fragmentation 
pattern, included (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, theaflavin and their various 
gallate derivatives, quercetin and kaempferol mono-, di-, and triglycosides, 
quinic acid esters of gallic acid and hydroxycinnamates, and the purine 
alkaloids, caffeine and theobromine.

BACKGROUND: Proanthocyanidins, the most abundant polyphenols in chocolate, are 
not depolymerized in the stomach and reach the small intestine intact, where 
they are hardly absorbed because of their high molecular weight. In vitro and in 
vivo studies using pure compounds as substrates suggest that proanthocyanidins 
and the related catechin monomers may be degraded into more bioavailable 
low-molecular-weight phenolic acids by the microflora in the colon.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the amounts of phenolic acids 
formed by the microflora and excreted in the urine of human subjects after 
consumption of polyphenol-rich chocolate.
DESIGN: After consumption of a polyphenol-free diet for 2 d and a subsequent 
overnight fast, 11 healthy subjects (7 men and 4 women) consumed 80 g chocolate 
containing 439 mg proanthocyanidins and 147 mg catechin monomers. All urine was 
collected during the 24 h before chocolate consumption and at 3, 6, 9, 24, and 
48 h after chocolate consumption. Aromatic acids were identified in urine by gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry and were quantified by HPLC-electrospray 
ionization tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Chocolate intake increased the urinary excretion of the 6 following 
phenolic acids: m-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, ferulic acid, 
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, m-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, vanillic acid, and 
m-hydroxybenzoic acid.
CONCLUSION: The antioxidant and biological effects of chocolate may be explained 
not solely by the established absorption of catechin monomers but also by the 
absorption of microbial phenolic acid metabolites.

Beers are a source of dietary flavonoids; however, there exist differences in 
composition, alcohol concentration, and beneficial activities. To characterize 
these differences, three kinds of lager beer of habitual consumption in Spain, 
dark, blond, and alcohol-free, were assayed for total phenolic content, 
antioxidant activity, superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities, and 
in vitro inhibitory effect on DNA oxidative damage. Furthermore, their 
melanoidin content and correlation with antioxidant activity were evaluated. 
Dark beer contained the highest total phenolic (489 +/- 52 mg/L) and melanoidin 
(1.49 +/- 0.02 g/L) contents with a 2-fold difference observed when compared to 
the alcohol-free beer. For the three kinds of beer, the antioxidant activity 
measured as N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride concentration was 
strongly correlated with the total polyphenol content (R(2) = 0.91102, p < 
0.005) and with the melanoidin content (R(2) = 0.7999, p < 0.05). The results 
support a positive effect of beers on the protection of DNA oxidative damage, by 
decreasing the deoxyribose degradation, DNA scission (measured by 
electrophoresis), and inhibition of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) formation. 
Furthermore, a correlation between the total melanoidin content (R(2) = 0.7309, 
p < 0.01) and inhibition of 8-OH-dG was observed.

A quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection 
method separating 16 phenolic acids was achieved. Six columns and several mobile 
phases were investigated. Resolution was achieved with a high-purity silica 
Phenomenex Luna C18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm) and a binary gradient 
consisting of CH3OH-water (with 0.1% formic acid) and flow rate set at 0.7 
ml/min. Acids were detected and quantitation performed at wavelength 
representing the lowest energy lambda(max) for individual acids. Extraction 
procedure from wine was optimized and yields ranged from 79 to 87% based on 
internal standard recovery. To confirm our quantitative results, identical 
samples were analyzed both in-house and by a collaborating laboratory. 
Correlation of two data sets generated linear regression equations that 
approached unity (0.93-0.98) and R2 values ranging from 0.990 to 0.999.

A two-level Plackett-Burman design with 8 variables was used to evaluate 
ultrasonic treatment variables influencing the total phenolic content (TPC) 
extracted from asparagus roots. Steepest ascent method was conducted to identify 
the significance of parameters such as extraction temperature, stirring speed, 
intermission time, extraction time, ultrasonic frequency, and ultrasonic power. 
Ethanol and methanol aqueous solutions were used as extraction solvents and 
solvent's concentration, extraction time, ultrasonic power and solid: liquid 
ratio were optimized in this study. A predicted value of TPC (71.1 mg/g) was 
obtained under the optimum conditions of extraction time 120 min, ultrasonic 
power 550 W, ethanol concentration of 20% and a solid: liquid ratio of 1:100. 
Central composite design was employed to further analyse the common interactions 
between the extraction variables and to further determine the optimal values 
that would generate the maximum TPC, total flavonoids content, total saponins 
content, caffeic acid and in vitro antioxidant activities. The optimal variables 
for ethanol extraction (80 min, 50% of ethanol, 360 W and 1:40) generated higher 
than methanol (410 W for 114.9 min using 73.7% methanol at 1:24).

Phenolic compounds including phenolic aldehydes, acids and flavonoids are 
separated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with analysis time 
shorter than described in the literature. The use of a fluorescence detector in 
series with absorbance detector allowed increasing selectivity and sensitivity 
for the determination of catechin, vanillic acid, syringic acid, epicatechin and 
trans-resveratrol in wine samples. An optimised sample preparation method using 
liquid-liquid extraction with diethyl ether at pH 2.0 was used. The optimised 
method was applied to analyse wine samples with good results.

Grapevine stilbenes are a family of polyphenols which derive from 
trans-resveratrol having antifungal and antimicrobial properties, thus being 
considered as phytoalexins. In addition to their diverse bioactive properties in 
animal models, they highlight a strong potential in human health maintenance and 
promotion. Due to this relevance, highly-specific qualitative and quantitative 
methods of analysis are necessary to accurately analyze stilbenes in different 
matrices derived from grapevine. Here, we developed a rapid, sensitive, and 
specific analysis method using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography 
coupled to triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ) in MRM mode to detect 
and quantify five grapevine stilbenes, trans-resveratrol, trans-piceid, 
trans-piceatannol, trans-pterostilbene, and trans-ε-viniferin, whose interest in 
relation to human health is continuously growing. The method was optimized to 
minimize in-source fragmentation of piceid and to avoid co-elution of cis-piceid 
and trans-resveratrol, as both are detected with resveratrol transitions. The 
applicability of the developed method of stilbene analysis was tested 
successfully in different complex matrices including cellular extracts of Vitis 
vinifera cell cultures, reaction media of biotransformation assays, and red 
wine.

In this study polyphenolic compounds extracted from olive fruits of five 
registered cultivars were analyzed. A solid-liquid extraction (LSE) procedure 
with Extrelut cartridge (diatomaceous earth) using different eluents was 
developed to obtain polyphenolic compounds. HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS methods were 
applied for the quali-quantitative analysis of each fraction obtained from LSE. 
The results of this work show that the LSE procedure with diatomaceous earth 
cartridge supplies a rapid and reproducible fractioning method able to obtain a 
quantitative recovery of all compounds and to collect fractions directly 
analyzed by HPLC. A comparison among different cultivars shows significant 
quantitative differences in some polyphenols, such as verbascoside, anthocyanic 
compounds, and oleuropein derivatives.

The flavonoid composition of three phenotypes of ""Zolfino"" landraces, a typical 
bean grown in Tuscany, has been elucidated by means of HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS 
analysis. Flavonols, isoflavones, and anthocyanins have been separated and 
determined in the different samples chosen on the basis of their seed coat 
color. A flavonol that has not been previously found in Phaseolus vulgaris L. 
seeds has been characterized. The quantitative data show the presence of 
flavonols (ranging from 709 to 118 mg/kg of fresh weight), isoflavones (ranging 
from 14 to 2 mg/kg of fresh weight), and anthocyanins, in black beans only. 
These results show that this genotype could be very interesting from a 
nutritional point of view.

There is increasing interest in olive polyphenols because of their biological 
properties as well as their contribution to the color, taste, and shelf life of 
olive products. However, some of these compounds remain unidentified. It has 
been shown that hydroxytyrosol 4-beta-D-glucoside 
(4-beta-D-glucosyl-3-hydroxyphenylethanol) coeluted with hydroxytyrosol 
[(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol] under reversed phase conditions in the phenolic 
chromatograms of olive pulp, vegetation water, and pomace of olive oil 
processing. A method to separate this compound from hydroxytyrosol by HPLC has 
been developed. The concentration of this glucoside increased in olive pulp with 
maturation and could be the main phenolic compound in mature olives. In 
contrast, the presence of this compound was not detected in olive oil by using 
HPLC-MS. The compound must be considered both in table olives and olive oil 
processing because of its glucose and hydroxytyrosol contribution to these 
products.

The levels of trans-piceid, cis-piceid, trans-resveratrol, and cis-resveratrol 
have been measured in 36 grape juices using an HPLC system with spectral 
analysis of eluting peaks. The piceid (glucosides) were the major component in 
the grape juices. In red grape juices the average concentrations were 3.38 mg/L 
for trans-piceid, 0.79 mg/L for cis-piceid, 0.50 mg/L for trans-resveratrol, and 
0.06 mg/L for cis-resveratrol. In white grape juices the levels were, on 
average, 0.18 mg/L for trans-piceid, 0.26 mg/L for cis-piceid, and 0.05 mg/L for 
trans-resveratrol, and cis-resveratrol was not detected in any sample. Levels of 
total resveratrol (trans- and cis-resveratrol and -piceid) found in red and in 
white grape juices are similar to those described in Spanish red and white 
wines. Due to their resveratrol content, as well as other phenolics, grape 
juices may have a beneficial health effect of interest to those who cannot drink 
wine.

Yoghurt impacts on the excretion of phenolic acids derived from colonic

Human urine was collected over a 24 h period after the consumption of 250 mL of 
(i) water, (ii) orange juice, and (iii) orange juice plus 150 mL of full fat 
natural yoghurt. The orange juice contained 168 micromol of 
hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside and 18 micromol of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside. GC-MS 
analysis of the urine identified nine phenolic acids, five of which, 
3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylhydracrylic acid, dihydroferulic 
acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylhydracrylic acid and 3-hydroxyhippuric acid, were 
associated with orange juice consumption indicating that they were derived from 
colonic catabolism of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside. The overall 0-24 h excretion of 
the five phenolic acids was 6.7 +/- 1.8 micromol after drinking water and this 
increased significantly (p < 0.05) to 62 +/- 18 micromol, equivalent to 37% of 
the ingested flavanones, following orange juice consumption. When the orange 
juice was ingested with yoghurt excretion fell back markedly to 9.3 +/- 4.4 
micromol. This was not due to a difference in mouth to caecum transit time, as 
measured with breath hydrogen production, though possibly there may have been a 
slowing of the bulk of the meal reaching the large intestine which may then have 
altered the catabolism of the flavanones to phenolic acids by the colonic 
microbiota.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate green tea flavan-3-ol 
catabolism and plasma pharmacokinetic and urinary excretion by high-performance 
liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry to evaluate their absolute 
bioavailability by taking into account all known and some unknown catabolites 
deriving from their interaction with the gastrointestinal tract and its host 
microflora.
METHODS: A feeding study was carried out in 20 healthy human volunteers who 
ingested 400 mL of a ready-to-drink green tea containing approximately 400 μmol 
of flavan-3-ols. Urine and plasma were collected for 4 and 24h, respectively, 
and 39 relevant catabolites were identified in these biological fluids by tandem 
mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: In biological fluids, 39 relevant flavan-3-ol catabolites were 
identified. In plasma, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate was the only unmetabolized 
compound and the highest in absolute concentration compared with 
(-)-epigallocatechin and (-)-epicatechin conjugates. Colonic microflora-derived 
polyhydroxyphenyl-γ-valerolactones were by far the main urinary catabolites, 
averaging 10 times greater concentratin than flavan-3-ol conjugates. The 
calculated bioavailability was equal to 39% and it is interesting to notice the 
great variability in urinary excretion of colonic metabolites among 
participants, probably related to differences in their own colonic microflora.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that green tea catechins are more 
bioavailable than previously observed when colonic ring fission metabolites are 
taken into consideration. Regular consumption of ready-to-drink green tea 
containing flavan-3-ols allows a non-marginal exposure of the human body to 
these catabolites, somehow justifying the numerous beneficial actions described 
as linked to green tea intake.

Nine commercial brands of grapefruit juice were analyzed for their flavonoid 
content by HPLC to determine if significant brand-to-brand variance in 
grapefruit juice flavonoid content exists. Flavonoid glycosides narirutin, 
naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, didymin, and poncirin have been identified 
in all the grapefruit juices examined. The aglycone quercetin was detected in 
only two brands. All the juices were free from methoxylated flavonoid aglycones. 
There was a significant difference in the amounts of total flavonoids and 
individual flavonoids in the nine brands. The concentration of total flavonoids 
ranged between 19.44 and 84.28 mg/100 ml juice. Naringin was found to be the 
major flavonoid followed by narirutin and hesperidin. Their concentrations 
ranged from 14.56 to 63.8; 2.25 to 12.20; and 0.24 to 3.12 mg/100 ml juice, 
respectively.

The alkylresorcinol content and homologue composition in selected Polish rye and 
wheat cultivars and selected whole-grain cereal products were determined in this 
study. Cereal grains and whole-grain cereal products were extracted with 
acetone, whereas bread types were extracted with hot 1-propanol. The average 
alkylresorcinol content in tested rye (approximately 1100 mg/kg DM) and wheat 
(approximately 800 mg/kg DM) grains harvested in Poland was within the range 
previously reported in Swedish and Finnish samples. The total alkylresorcinol 
content in tested cereal products available on the Polish market varied from 
very low levels in barley grain-based foods up to 3000 mg/kg DM in wheat bran. 
The total alkylresorcinol content in 14 bread samples extracted with hot 
1-propanol varied from approximately 100 mg/kg DM in whole bread made with honey 
up to approximately 650 mg/kg DM in whole-rye bread. Calculated ratios of C17:0 
to C21:0 homologues, a useful parameter previously used to distinguish between 
rye and wheat cereals and their derived products, was about 1.2-1.4 in rye 
products, about 0.2 in wheat products, and varied between 0.2 and 0.6 in 
cereal-derived products containing a mixture of whole rye and/or wheat. The data 
set obtained were subsequently compared using cluster and principal component 
analysis, which allowed the tested cereal products to be classified into two 
major groups consisting of whole-rye or whole-wheat products, respectively. On 
the basis of that approach, mixed cereal products containing rye and wheat bran 
or whole rye and wheat flour were grouped between those two well-defined 
clusters. Our work not only provides a detailed examination of alkylresorcinols 
in selected Polish rye and wheat cultivars and selected whole-grain cereal 
products, but also demonstrates that this type of analysis accompanied by the 
use of proper statistical algorithms offers an objective way to evaluate the 
quality of whole-grain rye and/or wheat and their derived products.

A fast method using high-performance liquid chromatography based on two 
monolithic columns has been developed for the simultaneous determination of 
isoflavones extracted from soybeans and derived foods. The 12 main isoflavones 
were resolved in 10 min in two coupled monolithic columns working at 35 degrees 
C using a elution gradient of acidified water (0.1% acetic acid) and methanol 
(0.1% acetic acid) at a flow rate of 5 mL min(-1). Retention time and relative 
area standard deviations were below 1% for all isoflavones. The method developed 
was successfully applied to several soy food samples and spiked samples. Total 
isoflavone concentration in sampled soy foods ranged from 34.28 mg L(-1) to 4.29 
mg g(-1).

Two new dehydrotriferulic acids and two dehydrotetraferulic acids were isolated 
from saponified maize bran insoluble fiber using size exclusion chromatography 
on Bio-Beads S-X3 followed by Sephadex LH-20 chromatography and semipreparative 
phenyl-hexyl reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography. On the basis 
of UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and one- and two-dimensional NMR 
experiments, the structures were identified as 
8-5(noncyclic)/5-5-dehydrotriferulic acid, 
8-8(tetrahydrofuran)/5-5-dehydrotriferulic acid, and 
4-O-8/5-5/8-O-4-dehydrotetraferulic acid. The second tetramer was tentatively 
identified as 4-O-8/5-5/8-5(noncyclic)-dehydrotetraferulic acid. Compounds 
containing an 8-5(noncyclic)-coupled dimeric unit probably do not exist in 
planta but are formed from their phenylcoumaran precursors containing an 
8-5(cyclic)-coupled dimeric unit during saponification. The presented 
dehydrotrimers are the first dehydrotriferulates that do not contain an 
8-O-4-coupled dimeric unit. The ferulate dehydrotetramers that are reported for 
the first time are presumed, like the dimers and trimers, to cross-link 
polysaccharides in the plant. Because both tetramers contain a 
5-5/8-O-4-dehydrotriferulate moiety, the predominant dehydrotrimer in maize 
bran, it is not possible to deduce whether tetramers are formed by coupling of a 
fourth unit to a preformed dehydrotriferulate or by 5-5-coupling of preformed 
8-O-4- and 8-5-dehydrodiferulates. Nevertheless, such compounds document 
expanded roles for ferulates in cross-linking polysaccharides in plant cell 
walls.

Quantitation of polymethoxylated flavones in orange juice by high-performance 
liquid chromatography.

Rouseff RL, Ting SV.

A quantitative high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedure for the 
determination of the five major polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) in orange juice 
has been developed. It employs a unique ternary solvent system with coupled 
UV-fluorescence detection. The dual detectors were employed to determine the 
presence of interfering substances and served as a cross check on quantitation. 
Stop flow UV and fluorescence scanning was used to identify peaks and determine 
the presence of impurities. Although all five citrus PMFs fluoresce, some HPLC 
fluorescence peaks were too small to be of much practical use. All five citrus 
PMFs could be quantitated satisfactorily with the fixed wavelength UV (313 nm) 
detector. The HPLC procedure has been used to evaluate each step in the 
preparation. The optimum extracting solvent was selected and one time consuming 
step was eliminated, as it was found to be unnecessary. HPLC values for 
nobiletin and sinensetin are in good agreement with the thin-layer 
chromatographic (TLC) values in the literature. HPLC values for the other three 
flavones were considerably lower than those reported in the literature. The HPLC 
procedure is considerably faster than the TLC procedure with equal or superior 
precision and accuracy.

The major flavanone-7-O-glycoside constituents in citrus fruit juices (naringin, 
hesperidin, neohesperidin, narirutin, and eriocitrin) were separated as 
diastereomers by multidimensional liquid chromatography. The method consisted of 
coupling two HPLC columns: a reversed-phase (RP(18)) column was used for the 
separation of flavanone glycosides, which were, then, individually switched into 
a carboxymethylated beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD)-based column and resolved as the 
corresponding stereoisomers. The method was used for the full analysis of 
flavanone glycosides in fresh hand-squeezed and commercial fruit juices by 
combining the quantitative estimation with the diastereomeric analysis. 
Quantitative data were in general consistent with previously reported data in 
this field. CC-LC isomer analysis was carried out by coupling the beta-CD column 
with a mass spectrometer operated with negative ion electrospray ionization 
(ESI-MS). The results showed that hesperidin was present in orange juices almost 
exclusively as the 2S isomer, whereas narirutin had mainly the 2R configuration. 
In grapefruit juices (2S)-naringin prevailed with the respect to the 2R isomer, 
whereas the opposite was true for narirutin. Lemon juices contained eriocitrin 
stereoisomers in equal amount (50% each), but hesperidin was almost exclusively 
found as the 2S isomer. Significant differences of the diastereomeric ratios 
were observed between freshly squeezed juices and juices from commercial 
sources.

Interindividual variation in metabolism of soy isoflavones and lignans: 
influence of habitual diet on equol production by the gut microflora.

The soy isoflavones, daidzein and genistein, and the lignans, matairesinol and 
secoisolariciresinol, are phytoestrogens metabolized extensively by the 
intestinal microflora. Considerable important evidence is already available that 
shows extensive interindividual variation in isoflavone metabolism, and we have 
investigated the extent of this variation in a crossover study of a 
soy-containing food low or high in isoflavones (each treatment period lasted for 
17 days, and the 2 treatment periods were separated by a 25-day washout period) 
in 24 healthy subjects [19 women and 5 men, mean age 30 yr, range 19-40, mean 
body mass index 22.5 +/- 3.5 (SD) kg/m2]. There was a 16-fold variation in total 
isoflavonoid excretion in urine after the high-isoflavone treatment period. The 
variation in urinary equol excretion was greatest (664-fold), and subjects fell 
into two groups: poor equol excretors and good equol excretors (36%). A 
significant negative correlation was found between the proportion of energy from 
fat in the habitual diet and urinary equol excretion (r = -0.55; p = 0.012). 
Good equol excretors consumed less fat as percentage of energy than poor 
excretors (26 +/- 2.3% compared with 35 +/- 1.6%, p < 0.01) and more 
carbohydrate as percentage of energy than poor excretors (55 +/- 2.9% compared 
with 47 +/- 1.7%, p < 0.05). Interindividual variation in the urinary excretion 
of O-desmethyl-angolensin (O-DMA) was also apparent (76-fold after the 
high-isoflavone treatment period), but there was no relationship between equol 
excretion and O-DMA excretion. Enterolactone was the major lignan metabolite in 
urine and plasma but showed less interindividual variation than equol and O-DMA. 
It is suggested that the dietary fat intake decreases the capacity of gut 
microbial flora to synthesize equol.

For the first time the identification and quantification of phenolic compounds 
of the Olea europaea L. cv. Chemlali olive were carried out to examine their 
profile during maturation. The phenolic composition was studied by using 
reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography during all steps of fruit 
development. Oleuropein is the abundant phenolic compound in Chemlali olive, and 
its concentration increases during maturation. An indirect relationship between 
oleuropein content in olive fruit and hydroxytyrosol was observed. Weak changes 
in the amounts of the other phenolic monomers and flavonoids were also observed. 
The total phenolic content varied from 6 to 16 g/kg expressed as pyrogallol 
equivalents. Its highest level was found at the last maturation period. The 
antioxidant capacity of olive extracts was evaluated by measuring the radical 
scavenging effect on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl. The IC(50) values of the 
olive extract ranged from 3.2 to 1.5 microg/mL. There was a correlation between 
antioxidant activity and total phenolic content of samples. The antioxidant 
activity increased with maturation. This could be attributed to the increase of 
the tolal phenol level with fruit development.

This investigation was designed to characterize phenolic metabolism of the olive 
cultivar, Hardy's Mammoth, by examining its constitutive tissues. The phenolic 
profiles of pulp, seed, stone, and new and old season leaves were monitored over 
two fruiting seasons, to investigate possible relationships between tissues and 
phenol content and to determine the impact of alternate fruit bearing. No major 
qualitative differences in phenolic composition were found between the various 
tissues; however, distinct differences between the tissues with respect to 
quantifiable phenols were established. Relationships between 
2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl (3E,4E)-4-formyl-3-(2-oxoethyl)hex-4-enoate ester, 
oleuropein, and hydroxytyrosol in pulp and leaf were identified and found to be 
related to alternate bearing. Concentrations of 5-caffeoylquinic acid in old 
season leaves differed dramatically between seasons, confirming earlier studies.

Low risk of breast cancer (BC) has been proposed to be associated with high 
intake of lignans. Some plant lignans are converted to mammalian lignans, e.g., 
enterolactone (ENL), suggested to be the biologically active lignan forms. Until 
now, little attention has been paid to the possible biological activities of 
plant lignans, even though some plant lignans are absorbed and present in serum 
and urine. In this study, we have investigated the antitumorigenic and 
endocrine-modulatory activities of different plant lignans in order to clarify 
the structure-activity relationships. 7-Hydroxymatairesinol (HMR) is [corrected] 
converted to ENL, and both HMR and ENL inhibit the growth of 
7,12-dimethylbenz[a]-anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary cancer. Nortrachelogenin 
(NTG) resembles HMR, but has a hydroxyl group at C-8 instead of C-7 and is not 
converted to ENL. In DMBA-model, NTG showed no inhibition of tumor growth, but 
increased the uterine weight. Furthermore, life-long exposure to NTG increased 
uterine weight in immature females and ventral prostate weight in adult males. 
In contrast, life-long exposure to HMR had no effects on uterine or prostate 
weights at any age. Our results indicate that a difference in the position of 
one hydroxyl group results in distinct biological responses in vivo, as well as 
different lignan metabolite profiles.

Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a naturally occurring 
polyphenol with cancer chemopreventive properties in preclinical models of 
carcinogenesis, including those of colorectal cancer. Recently, a variety of 
analogues of resveratrol have been synthesised and investigated in in vitro 
assays. One analogue, 3,4,5,4'-tetramethoxystilbene (DMU 212), showed 
preferential growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic properties in transformed cells, 
when compared with their untransformed counterparts. As part of a 
chemoprevention drug development programme, the pharmacokinetic properties of 
DMU 212 were compared with those of resveratrol in the plasma, liver, kidney, 
lung, heart, brain and small intestinal and colonic mucosa of mice. DMU 212 or 
resveratrol (240 mg kg(-1)) were administered intragastrically, and drug 
concentrations were measured by HPLC. Metabolites were characterised by 
cochromatography with authentic reference compounds and were identified by mass 
spectrometry. The ratios of area of plasma or tissue concentration vs time 
curves of resveratrol over DMU 212 (AUC(res)/AUC(DMU212)) for the plasma, liver, 
small intestinal and colonic mucosa were 3.5, 5, 0.1 and 0.15, respectively. 
Thus, resveratrol afforded significantly higher levels than DMU 212 in the 
plasma and liver, while DMU 212 exhibited superior availability compared to 
resveratrol in the small intestine and colon. Resveratrol was metabolised to its 
sulphate or glucuronate conjugates, while DMU 212 underwent metabolic 
hydroxylation or single and double O-demethylation. DMU 212 and resveratrol 
inhibited the growth of human-derived colon cancer cells HCA-7 and HT-29 in 
vitro with IC(50) values of between 6 and 26 microM. In the light of the 
superior levels achieved in the gastrointestinal tract after the administration 
of DMU 212, when compared to resveratrol, the results provide a good rationale 
to evaluate DMU 212 as a colorectal cancer chemopreventive agent.

Resveratrol has been associated with reduced cardiovascular disease and reduced 
cancer risk. This phytoalexin has been reported in a number of plant species, 
including grapes, and may be one of the compounds responsible for the health 
benefits of red wine. Analytical methods for measuring resveratrol in wine and 
peanuts were adapted to isolate, identify, and quantify resveratrol in several 
cultivars of peanuts. Aqueous ethanol (80% v/v) extracts from peanuts without 
seed coats were purified over alumina/silica gel columns and analyzed by 
reversed phase HPLC using a C-18 column. Peanuts from each market type, 
Virginia, runner, and Spanish, produced in four different locations contained 
from 0.03 to 0.14 microg of resveratrol/g. Seed coats from runner and Virginia 
types contained approximately 0.65 microg/g of seed coat, which is equivalent to 
<0.04 microg/seed. Quantitative analysis of 15 cultivars representing 3 peanut 
market types, which had been cold stored for up to 3 years, indicated a range of 
0.02-1.79 microg/g of peanut compared to 0.6-8.0 microg/mL in red wines.

Tea is rich in polyphenols and has a variety of biological activities. In order 
to better understand the biological effects of tea constituents on human health, 
markers for their exposure and their metabolic fates are needed. Previously, we 
have characterized several catechin metabolites in the blood and urine, but more 
information on the metabolite profile of tea polyphenols is needed. In the 
present study, the human urinary metabolite profile of tea polyphenols was 
investigated using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass 
spectrometry with data-dependent acquisition. With data-dependent MS/MS analysis 
by collecting the MS2 and MS3 spectra of the most intense ions in the sample, we 
identified more than twenty metabolites of tea polyphenols from human urine 
samples. (-)-Epigallocatechin (EGC) glucuronide, methylated EGC glucuronide, 
methylated EGC sulfate, (-)-epicatechin (EC) glucruronide, EC sulfate, 
methylated EC sulfate, as well as the glucuronide and sulfate metabolites of the 
ring-fission metabolites of tea catechins, 
5-(3',4',5'-trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4), 
5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6) and 
5-(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6'), were the major human 
urinary metabolites of tea polyphenols. To our knowledge, this is the first 
report of the direct simultaneous analysis of the human urinary metabolite 
profile of tea polyphenols using single sample analysis. This method can also be 
used for thorough investigations of the metabolite profiles of many other 
dietary constituents.

(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant and most biologically 
active polyphenolic compound in tea, has been proposed to have many health 
beneficial effects. The metabolic fate of EGCG, however, is not well understood. 
In the present study, we identified a novel EGCG metabolite, 
7-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-EGCG-4''-O-beta-D-glucupyranoside, in a mouse urine 
sample using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass 
spectrometry. The structure of this metabolite was confirmed by analyzing the 
MSn (n = 1-4) spectra as well as comparing the MS/MS spectra of its product ions 
with those from EGCG and EGCG-4''-O-beta-D-glucupyranoside standards. To our 
knowledge, this is the first report of the identification of a glucoside 
metabolite of EGCG in mammals. Our results indicate that glucosidation 
represents a novel pathway in the metabolism of EGCG in mice.

The cortex of 14 French apple varieties (12 cider and 2 juice varieties), one 
English cider variety, and one dessert apple (i.e., Golden Delicious) were 
studied for their polyphenol composition. Total polyphenols were assayed by the 
Folin-Ciocalteu method, and the precise polyphenolic composition (monomeric 
catechins, proanthocyanidins, hydroxycinnamic acids, and dihydrochalcones) was 
obtained by HPLC following thiolysis. ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS analyses showed that 
chlorogenic acid and p-coumaroylquinic acid were methylated under the conditions 
of thiolysis. Depending on the variety, the global polyphenol concentration 
varied from 1 to 7 g per kilogram of fresh cortex. Cider varieties globally 
showed a higher polyphenol concentration than the dessert apple Golden 
Delicious, bitter varieties being the more concentrated. The proportion of the 
polyphenol classes varied greatly from one cultivar to another. For all 
varieties, procyanidins were always the predominant class. They were mainly 
constituted of (-)-epicatechin units with a small proportion of (+)-catechin as 
a terminal unit. The average degree of polymerization ranged between 4.2 and 7.5 
depending upon the variety with an exception for the sharp varieties Guillevic 
and Avrolles which showed significant concentrations of procyanidins with DPn of 
40 and 50, respectively.

The presence of resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) and its beta-glucoside, 
piceid (resveratrol-3-beta-D-glucopyranoside), together with their isomers in 
wine appears to be one of the beneficial factors conferring a protective effect 
against cardiovascular disease through red wine ingestion. A total of 42 red and 
white wines was collected in areas from Hokkaido to Kyushu in Japan. The wines 
were fractionated with a C18 Sep-pak cartridge, and the active principles were 
eluted with ethyl acetate. Crude trans- and cis-piceid were extracted from a 
Chinese medicine, 'Kojohkon' (Polygonum cuspidatum), and their retention times 
and UV absorption were confirmed by HPLC. trans- and cis-Resveratrol, and trans- 
and cis-piceid were analyzed in a short C18 HPLC column, and cis-resveratrol was 
quantified from the amount of cis-isomer converted from authentic 
trans-resveratrol that had been treated by UV irradiation. The content of piceid 
is shown as the resveratrol equivalent. The average content of total stilbene 
compounds was 4.37 mg/liter in red wines, while only 0.68 mg/liter in white 
wines. Red wines made from Pinot noir, Merlot, and Zweigeltrebe grapes all had a 
high resveratrol content.

Chemical composition and the effects of domestic processing and storage were 
studied in organically cultivated or wild growing berries, harvested in 
certificated area in Serbia. The total phenolics content in fresh berries ranged 
from 380 to 1660 mg GAE/100 g. The phenolic content decreased during the 
processing to jams, and storage in almost all samples, except in black currant. 
Among fresh berries, the highest amount of total anthocyanins was found in 
bilberry (0.61 +/- 0.03 %). Processing and storage caused decrease in 
anthocyanin content. The most ubiquitous anthocyanin aglycone was found to be 
cyanidin. Ellagic acid was detected in fresh and frozen black raspberries and 
related jams, and its content increases during thermal processing to jam. Among 
fresh berries, bilberry showed the strongest DPPH radical scavenging activity 
with an IC(50) value of 0.82 mg/ml. However, frozen as well as processed berries 
in our study still showed comparable high values of radical scavenging activity. 
After 9 months of storage all investigated jams were microbiologicaly correct. 
Regardless of the losses in the amount of total phenolics, total anthocyanins 
and radical scavenging activity, frozen berries and related jams are still 
excellent sources of nutritional substances with antioxidant potential.

A new HPLC stationary phase has been applied to the analysis of phenolic acids 
and flavonoids with diode array and mass spectrometric detection. The separation 
of 26 standard compounds was achieved within 1 h. The stationary phase displayed 
excellent resolution especially of flavonol glycosides. The analytical system 
has been used for the determination of phenolic compounds in apple pomace and 
apple juice, and in extracts of pear fruits of different cultivars. Apple pomace 
was found to be a promising source of phenolics. However, yields are affected by 
the drying conditions applied. Furthermore, the applicability of the analytical 
system for the authenticity control of apple and pear juice was demonstrated by 
determination of characteristic quercetin and isorhamnetin glycosides, and 
dihydrochalcones, respectively. Since isorhamnetin-3-glucoside was present in 
all pear cultivars investigated, the usefulness of arbutin as a specific marker 
of pear products appears to be doubtful.

We carried out a human volunteer study with 14 participants, eight of whom were 
asked to consume one cup of coffee at four different time points. Urine samples 
were collected at eight time points and analyzed by HPLC-MS analysis. The LC-MS 
data were subjected to unsupervised multivariate statistical analysis (principal 
component analysis) followed by supervised multivariate analysis (linear 
discriminant analysis). In an unbiased approach, in the absence of data 
preselection and filtering, the most important features explaining differences 
between coffee consumers and the control group observed showed variations in 
endogenous human hormonal steroid metabolites as well as xanthine derivatives. 
Only after a biased data treatment data revealed differences between the sample 
groups based on literature reported chlorogenic acid metabolites resulting 
directly from coffee intake. Such analysis could confirm the presence of 21 
previously reported chlorogenic acid plasma metabolites as urinary metabolites. 
The application of tandem MS molecular networking revealed the presence of five 
bioavailable chlorogenic acid derivatives in urine previously not reported, 
including both quinic acid lactone and dimethoxy caffeoyl esters. Selected 
cinnamic acids were quantified in urine.

Due to the lack of one universally applicable and commonly used reference 
method, sample preparation in isoflavone (IF) analysis has been performed by 
many different methods which renders comparison and quality assessment of 
published IF contents in foodstuffs difficult. In the present work, the impact 
of different experimental parameters on the IF concentrations determined in 
soybeans, tofu, soy drink and textured vegetable protein by different extraction 
and hydrolysis methods was assessed and IF contents obtained by optimized 
orthogonal methods were compared. Chromatographic analysis was performed by 
HPLC-UV-ESI-MS. If possible sources of error - which are also pointed out in 
this work - are avoided, IF contents obtained by extraction, acid-, base- and 
enzymatic hydrolysis are similar. However, these sample preparation methods 
differ in the amount of time, standard compounds and instruments required, 
ruggedness, and in their applicability to analysis of complex composite samples 
containing soy as minor ingredient. Enzymatic hydrolysis with Helix pomatia 
juice after extraction by sonication with first 50, then 80% aqueous 
acetonitrile in the presence of zinc sulfate heptahydrate and after adjustment 
to </=10% organic solvent turned out to be the method of choice if only aglucone 
equivalent contents are required. The advantages of this method are short 
chromatographic run times, smallest danger of coelution, lowest achievable 
limits of quantitation and therefore best suitability for work-up of complex 
composite samples and that only aglucone standards are needed for quantitation.

Pinotage red wines were found to contain a reaction product of malvidin 
3-glucoside and caffeic acid, the so-called pinotin A. A total of 50 Pinotage 
wines from the vintages 1996-2002 were analyzed for the content of pinotin A, 
malvidin 3-glucoside, caffeic acid, and caftaric acid. Statistical analyses were 
performed to reveal variations in the content of these compounds and to 
determine the factors that influence pinotin A formation during wine aging. An 
exponential increase of the concentration of this aging product was observed 
with prolonged storage time. The most rapid synthesis of pinotin A was observed 
in 2.5-4 year old wines, although at this age malvidin 3-glucoside is already 
degraded to a large extent. This phenomenon is explained by the increased ratio 
of caffeic acid/malvidin 3-glucoside, which strongly favors the formation of 
pinotin A and makes side reactions less likely. Pinotin A formation proceeds as 
long as a certain level of malvidin 3-glucoside is maintained in the wines. In 
wines >5-6 years old degradation or polymerization of pinotin A finally exceeds 
the rate of its de novo synthesis.

Pistachio shells split naturally prior to maturity leading to their unique 
crack-shell form. Within 24 h of harvest, hull-trapped moisture may cause shell 
staining. The illegal process of bleaching has been used to restore a desirable 
white color to pistachio shells. It is not known whether bleaching adversely 
affects phytochemical levels in pistachios. Therefore, we identified for the 
first time multiple pistachio skin phenolics as quercetin (14.9 microg/g), 
luteolin (10.0 microg/g), eriodictyol (10.2 microg/g), rutin (1.6 microg/g), 
naringenin (1.2 microg/g), apigenin (0.2 microg/g), and the anthocyanins, 
cyanidin-3-galactoside (696 microg/g) and cyanidin-3-glucoside (209 microg/g). 
We investigated the effects of bleaching (0.1-50% hydrogen peroxide) on phenolic 
levels and antioxidative capacities in raw and roasted nuts. Because of their 
flavylium cation structures, anthocyanins were the most sensitive to bleaching. 
Bleaching decreased total anthocyanin levels [mug/g of skins (% hydrogen 
peroxide)]: 905 and 549 (0%); 653 and 145 (0.1%); 111 and 18.4 (5%); 6.1 and 3.2 
(25%); 0 and 0 (50%) for raw and roasted nuts, respectively. Bleaching also 
reduced antioxidative capacity [microM/g of Trolox (% hydrogen peroxide)]: 945 
and 725 (0%); 940 and 472 (0.1%); 930 and 455 (5%); 433 and 370 (25%); 189 and 
173 (50%), for raw and roasted nuts, respectively. Raw nuts preserved phenolic 
levels and antioxidant capacity better than roasted nuts, suggesting 
contributing effects of other substances and/or matrix effects that are 
destroyed by the roasting process. The destruction of bioactive phenolics in 
pistachio skins may negatively impact the potential health benefits arising from 
pistachio consumption.

Pomegranate juice (PJ), a rich source of polyphenols including ellagitannins, 
has attracted much attention due to its reported health benefits. This has 
resulted in the consumption of liquid and powder pomegranate extracts as 
alternatives to PJ. Therefore establishing the bioavailability of polyphenols 
from these extract preparations is necessary. Sixteen healthy volunteers 
sequentially consumed, with a 1-week washout period between treatments, PJ (8 
ounces, Wonderful fruit variety), a pomegranate polyphenol liquid extract 
(POMxl, 8 ounces), and a pomegranate polyphenol powder extract (POMxp, 1,000 
mg). The three interventions provided 857, 776, and 755 mg of polyphenols as 
gallic acid equivalents, respectively. Plasma bioavailability, judged based on 
ellagic acid levels over a 6-hour period, did not show statistical differences 
in area under the curve for the three interventions: 0.14 +/- 0.05, 0.11 +/- 
0.03, and 0.11 +/- 0.04 micromol . hour/L for PJ, POMxl, and POMxp, 
respectively. The time of maximum concentration was delayed for POMxp (2.58 +/- 
0.42 hours) compared to PJ (0.65 +/- 0.23 hours) and POMxl (0.94 +/- 0.06 
hours). Urolithin-A glucuronide, a urinary metabolite of ellagic acid, was not 
significantly different with the three interventions, reaching levels of 
approximately 1,000 ng/mL. This study demonstrates that ellagitannin 
metabolites, delivered from pomegranate fruits, as PJ, POMxl, and POMxp, reach 
equivalent levels with a delay in time of maximum concentration of POMxp 
compared to PJ and POMxl.

The effects of Trametes hirsuta laccase and Pentopan Mono BG xylanase and their 
combination on oat, wheat, and mixed oat-wheat doughs and the corresponding 
breads were investigated. Laccase treatment decreased the content of 
water-extractable arabinoxylan (WEAX) in oat dough due to oxidative 
cross-linking of feruloylated arabinoxylans. Laccase treatment also increased 
the proportion of water-soluble polysaccharides (WSNSP) apparently due to the 
beta-glucanase side activity present in the laccase preparation. As a result of 
the laccase treatment, the firmness of fresh oat bread was increased. Xylanase 
treatment doubled the content of WEAX in oat dough and slightly increased the 
amount of WSNSP. Increased stiffness of the dough and firmness of the fresh 
bread were detected, probably because of the increased WEAX content, which 
decreased the amount of water available for beta-glucan. The combination of 
laccase and xylanase produced slight hydrolysis of beta-glucan by the 
beta-glucanase side activity of laccase and enhanced the availability of AX for 
xylanase with concomitant reduction of the amount and molar mass of WSNSP. 
Subsequently, the volume of oat bread was increased. Laccase treatment tightened 
wheat dough, probably due to cross-linking of WEAX to higher molecular weight. 
In oat-wheat dough, laccase slightly increased the proportion of WSNSP between 
medium to low molecular weight and increased the specific volume of the bread. 
Xylanase increased the contents of WEAX and WSNSP between medium to low 
molecular weight in oat-wheat dough, which increased the softness of the dough, 
as well as the specific volume and softness of the bread. The results thus 
indicate that a combination of laccase and xylanase was beneficial for the 
textures of both oat and oat-wheat breads.

Vidalia onion varieties Nirvana, DPS 1032, Yellow 2025, King-Midas, and SBO 133 
grown at Vidalia, Georgia, were analyzed for flavonoid content. A 
high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with photodiode array 
detection was used for quantification. Compounds were analyzed as aglycons after 
acid hydrolysis with 1.2 M HCl. Identification of each compound was based on 
comparison of its retention time and UV spectra with those of pure commercial 
standards. Three major flavonoids, kaempferol, myricetin, and quercetin, were 
identified and quantified. Quercetin was the major flavonoid (7.70-46.32 mg/100 
g fresh weight, FW) present in all varieties, followed by myricetin (2.77-4.13 
mg/100 g FW). Minor quantities of kaempferol (1.10-1.98 mg/100 g FW) were also 
detected. The total polyphenols and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity 
(TEAC) ranged from 73.33 to 180.84 mg/100 g FW and 0.92-1.56 microM TEAC/g FW, 
respectively. A positive but weaker correlation was obtained for total 
polyphenols versus antioxidant capacity. Nevertheless, a stronger correlation 
(r(2) = 0.34) was obtained between flavonoid content versus antioxidant 
capacity. The data indicate that Vidalia onions are a rich source of quercetin, 
and they also contain myricetin and kaempferol.

Blueberries and blackberries grown at various locations in Georgia were 
collected and analyzed for flavonoids, total anthocyanins, total polyphenols, 
and Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). Each sample was analyzed for 
phenolic acids (gallic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, 
and ellagic acid) and flavonoids (catechin, epicatechin, myricetin, quercetin, 
and kaempferol). A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with 
photodiode array detection was used for analysis. Compounds were analyzed as 
aglycons after acid hydrolysis with 1.2 M HCl. Identification of each compound 
was based on retention time and UV spectra by comparison with pure commercial 
standards. Phenolic acids ranged from 0.19 to 258.90 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW), 
and flavonoids ranged from 2.50 to 387.48 mg/100 g FW. Total polyphenols ranged 
from 261.95 to 929.62 mg/100 g FW, and total anthocyanins ranged from 12.70 to 
197.34 mg/100 g FW. TEAC values varied from 8.11 to a maximum of 38.29 microM/g 
FW. A linear relationship was observed between TEAC values and total polyphenols 
or total anthocyanins. The data indicate that blueberries and blackberries are 
rich sources of antioxidants.

Hydrophilic phenols are the most abundant natural antioxidants of virgin olive 
oil (VOO), in which tocopherols and carotenes are also present. The prevalent 
classes of hydrophilic phenols found in VOO are phenyl alcohols, phenolic acids, 
secoiridoids such as the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid 
linked to (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol or (p-hydroxypheny1)ethanol 
(3,4-DHPEA-EDA or p-HPEA-EDA) and an isomer of the oleuropein aglycon 
(3,4-DHPEA-EA), lignans such as (+)-1-acetoxypinoresinol and (+)-pinoresinol, 
and flavonoids. A new method for the analysis of VOO hydrophilic phenols by 
direct injection in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with the use 
of a fluorescence detector (FLD) has been proposed and compared with the 
traditional liquid-liquid extraction technique followed by the HPLC analysis 
utilizing a diode array detector (DAD) and a FLD. Results show that the most 
important classes of phenolic compounds occurring in VOO can be evaluated using 
HPLC direct injection. The efficiency of the new method, as compared to the 
liquid-liquid extraction, was higher to quantify phenyl alcohols, lignans, and 
3,4-DHPEA-EA and lower for the evaluation of 3,4-DHPEA-EDA and p-HPEA-EDA.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the interaction between buckwheat 
protein and buckwheat phenols in the process of protein extraction and to 
compare the effects of phenols on protein structure and antioxidant activity. 
With the extension of extraction time, the content of total phenol increased 
from 150.51 to 336.01 mg gallic acid equivalent/g sample. Four phenols and seven 
phenols were identified by UPLC-Q/TOF-MS as binding to proteins in non-covalent 
and covalent forms, respectively. The contribution of non-covalent and covalent 
bound phenols to the antioxidant activity of the complexes were different. 
Meanwhile, the binding of phenols changed the infrared characteristic peak of 
protein, and reduced the fluorescence intensity and surface hydrophobic value. 
The free amino and sulfhydryl content of the protein decreased with increasing 
extraction time. These findings provide valuable information for one-step 
preparation of protein-phenol complexes.

An off-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) and ultra-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and 
validated for determining procyanidins, catechin, epicatechin, dimer, and trimer 
in plasma samples. In the validation procedure of the analytical method, 
linearity, precision, accuracy, detection limits (LODs), quantification limits 
(LOQs), and the matrix effect were studied. Recoveries of the procyanidins were 
higher than 84%, except for the trimer, which was 65%. The LODs and LOQs were 
lower than 0.003 and 0.01 microM, respectively, for all the procyanidins 
studied, except for the trimers, which were 0.8 and 0.98 microM, respectively. 
This methodology was then applied for the analysis of rat plasma obtained 2h 
after ingestion of grape seed phenolic extract. Monomers (catechin and 
epicatechin), dimer and trimer in their native form were detected and quantified 
in plasma samples, and their concentration ranged from 0.85 to 8.55 microM. 
Moreover, several metabolites, such as catechin and epicatechin glucuronide, 
catechin and epicatechin methyl glucuronide, and catechin and epicatechin 
methyl-sulphate were identified. These conjugated forms were quantified, in 
reference to the respective unconjugated form, showing concentrations between 
0.06 and 23.90 microM.

Quercetin (QUE), a flavonoid widely found in vegetables and fruits, is primarily 
metabolized through phase II conjugation pathways and circulates as various 
conjugates. We previously showed that QUE and its metabolites are transferred to 
neonatal mice via breast milk. However, as the dams in that study ingested QUE 
during pregnancy, placental transfer may also had occurred. Thus, this study 
aimed to investigate the placental transfer of QUE and its metabolites by 
quantifying their concentrations before parturition. ICR mice were fed a 
standard AIN-93G diet and mated, with gestational day 0 defined as the day of 
mating. On gestational day 14, the diet was switched to 1 % (w/w) 
QUE-supplemented AIN-93G. On gestational day 17, blood, liver, and placenta 
samples were collected from pregnant dams and fetuses. QUE and its metabolites 
were quantified using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with 
quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. QUE and its metabolites were 
detected in the placenta and maternal liver, as well as in the fetal liver. The 
proportions of heteroconjugates (e.g., quercetin glucuronide sulfate and 
isorhamnetin glucuronide sulfate) in the placenta (59 %) and fetal liver (43 %) 
were lower than in maternal plasma (94 %). In contrast, monoconjugates (e.g., 
quercetin glucuronide, quercetin sulfate) and particularly free QUE were 
relatively abundant in both placenta and fetal liver. These findings suggest 
that heteroconjugates from maternal blood may be deconjugated in the placenta. 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively analyze the 
placental transfer of QUE and its metabolites to fetuses in pregnant mice.

BACKGROUND: The nonsteroidal estrogen equol occurs as diastereoisomers, 
S-(-)equol and R-(+)equol, both of which have significant biological actions. 
S-(-)equol, the naturally occurring enantiomer produced by 20-30% of adults 
consuming soy foods, has selective affinity for estrogen receptor-beta, whereas 
both enantiomers modulate androgen action. Little is known about the 
pharmacokinetics of the diastereoisomers, despite current interest in developing 
equol as a nutraceutical or pharmaceutical agent.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare the pharmacokinetics of S-(-)equol and 
R-(+)equol by using [13C] stable-isotope-labeled tracers to facilitate the 
optimization of clinical studies aimed at evaluating the potential of these 
diastereoisomers in the prevention and treatment of estrogen- and 
androgen-dependent conditions.
DESIGN: A randomized, crossover, open-label study in 12 healthy adults (6 men 
and 6 women) compared the plasma and urinary pharmacokinetics of orally 
administered enantiomeric pure forms of S-(-)[2-13C]equol, R-(+)[2-13C]equol, 
and the racemic mixture. Plasma and urinary [13C]R-equol and [13C]S-equol 
concentrations were measured by tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Plasma [13C]equol concentration appearance and disappearance curves 
showed that both enantiomers were rapidly absorbed, attained high circulating 
concentrations, and had a similar terminal elimination half-life of 7-8 h. The 
systemic bioavailability and fractional absorption of R-(+)[2-13C]equol were 
higher than those of S-(-)[2-13C]equol or the racemate. The pharmacokinetics of 
racemic (+/-)[2-13C]equol were different from those of the individual 
enantiomers: slower absorption, lower peak plasma concentrations, and lower 
systemic bioavailability.
CONCLUSIONS: The high bioavailability of both diastereoisomers contrasts with 
previous findings for the soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein, both of which 
have relatively poor bioavailability, and suggests that low doses of equol taken 
twice daily may be sufficient to achieve biological effects.

The soy isoflavone metabolite, S-(-)equol, has selective affinity for estrogen 
receptor (ER)beta and also antagonizes in vivo the action of 
dihydrotestosterone. It is therefore of interest as a potential new therapeutic 
agent in hormone-dependent conditions and is under development as a 
nutraceutical. Our objective in this study was to define the pharmacokinetics of 
natural S-(-)equol after administration of SE5-OH, a newly developed S-(-)equol 
supplement made by incubation of the equol-producing bacterium Lactococcus 
garvieae with soy germ isoflavones. In a single-center, open-label, randomized, 
2-period crossover design study, the pharmacokinetics of S-(-)equol administered 
as single-bolus oral doses of 10 and 30 mg in the form of SE5-OH tablets was 
determined in 12 healthy postmenopausal women. S-(-)equol was measured in plasma 
and urine collected at timed intervals over a 48-h period postdosing using 
tandem MS. Equol-producer status was also determined after a soymilk challenge 
conducted after the pharmacokinetic sampling was complete. S-(-)equol was 
rapidly absorbed after oral administration and attained high plasma 
concentrations, with a plasma elimination half-life of 8 h. The maximum plasma 
concentration/dose, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 
to infinity/dose, and the fraction of dose excreted in urine (%f(e,u)) were 
similar for the 2 doses, indicating a dose-proportional response in total 
S-(-)equol pharmacokinetics. The systemic bioavailability of S-(-)equol was very 
high, as the %f(e,u) was 82% for both doses, which is greater than published 
data for the soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein. Three participants were 
determined to be equol-producers, representing a 25% frequency, and 
equol-producer status had no effect on natural S-(-)equol pharmacokinetics.

Several phenolic acids, e.g. caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, 
gallic acid and ellagic acid, which occur naturally, are inhibitors of 
carcinogenesis. In this paper we present a new method for the simultaneous 
determination of all of these compounds, except ellagic acid, in juices by 
reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using ultraviolet 
detection and involving isocratic elution, and we have devised an HPLC method 
for the determination of ellagic acid in juices. The experimental results showed 
that cherry juice contains a high concentration of chlorogenic acid and the 
content of bound gallic acid in black and green grape juices is high compared to 
that of other phenolic acids.

Total equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and phenolic content of 26 common 
spice extracts from 12 botanical families were investigated. Qualitative and 
quantitative analyses of major phenolics in the spice extracts were 
systematically conducted by reversed-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography (RP-HPLC). Many spices contained high levels of phenolics and 
demonstrated high antioxidant capacity. Wide variation in TEAC values 
(0.55-168.7 mmol/100 g) and total phenolic content (0.04-14.38 g of gallic acid 
equivalent/100 g) was observed. A highly positive linear relationship (R2= 0.95) 
obtained between TEAC values and total phenolic content showed that phenolic 
compounds in the tested spices contributed significantly to their antioxidant 
capacity. Major types of phenolic constituents identified in the spice extracts 
were phenolic acids, phenolic diterpenes, flavonoids, and volatile oils (e.g., 
aromatic compounds). Rosmarinic acid was the dominant phenolic compound in the 
six spices of the family Labiatae. Phenolic volatile oils were the principal 
active ingredients in most spices. The spices and related families with the 
highest antioxidant capacity were screened, e.g., clove in the Myrtaceae, 
cinnamon in the Lauraceae, oregano in the Labiatae, etc., representing potential 
sources of potent natural antioxidants for commercial exploitation. This study 
provides direct comparative data on antioxidant capacity and total and 
individual phenolics contents of the 26 spice extracts.

In this study, we investigated the intestinal absorption of luteolin and 
luteolin 7-O-beta-glucoside in rats by HPLC. The absorption analysis using rat 
everted small intestine demonstrated that luteolin was converted to glucuronides 
during passing through the intestinal mucosa and that luteolin 
7-O-beta-glucoside was absorbed after hydrolysis to luteolin. Free luteolin, its 
conjugates and methylated conjugates were present in rat plasma after dosing. 
This suggests that some luteolin can escape the intestinal conjugation and the 
hepatic sulfation/methylation. LC/MS analysis showed that the main conjugate 
which circulates in the blood was a monoglucuronide of the unchanged aglycone. 
Luteolin in propyleneglycol was absorbed more rapidly than that in 0.5% 
carboxymethyl cellulose. The plasma concentration of luteolin and its conjugates 
reached the highest level 15 min and 30 min after dosing with luteolin in 
propyleneglycol, respectively. HPLC analysis also allowed us to demonstrate the 
presence of free luteolin and its monoglucuronide in human serum after ingestion 
of luteolin.

The beneficial effects of red, yellow and white onion extracts have been 
assessed by antioxidant activity and antimutagenic activity. And the effects 
compared to BHT and ascorbic acid. Total phenolic compounds and flavonoids in 
onion extracts were determined. Yellow onion extract had more organic acid and 
free sugar than those detected in the white and red onion extract. The 
scavenging activity of DPPH radical and H(2)O(2) were increased depending on the 
concentration. The antioxidant activities using beta-carotene-linoleate system 
and reducing power were increased but the effect was small to that of BHT and 
ascorbic acid. After digested, extracts showed antimutagenic activities, and it 
seems that they inhibit the mutagenicity for digesting. This study demonstrated 
that the antimutagenicities and antioxidant properties of ethyl acetate extract 
against mutagens were related to their phenols and flavonoids, which are heat 
stable and losses digestive juices are relatively low.

Cold-pressed oils are oils prepared from pressing plant materials with a screw 
or hydraulic press, yielding oils with little contamination of harmful chemicals 
and high content of nutrients and functional constituents. Cold-pressed oils 
have gained increasing recognition as food supplements for preventing and 
ameliorating body deterioration due to ageing and the progression of lifestyle 
diseases or non-communicable diseases. This article aimed to review their 
structure, bioactivity, and chromatographic analysis of the mostly found 
functional compounds in cold-pressed oils, including phytosterols, carotenoids, 
tocols (tocopherols and tocotrienols), phenolic compounds (flavonoids, phenolic 
acids, tannins, stilbenes, and lignans), and squalene.

Flavanones, the main polyphenols of citrus fruits, are thought to contribute to 
the protective effects of these fruits against cardiovascular diseases and 
cancer. The metabolism of naringin (naringenin 7-O-neohesperidoside) is studied 
here in healthy (sham-operated, ShO) and tumor-bearing (TuB) rats. The tumor was 
induced by implanting Yoshida's sarcoma in hindlimb. Both groups received for 7 
days a semi-synthetic diet containing 0.5% naringin in per feeding conditions. 
Flavanones were analyzed in plasma, liver, kidney and urine by tandem mass 
spectrometry. Naringenin conjugates (essentially glucuronides) accounted for up 
to 98% of the total flavanones in plasma. Low amounts of hesperetin (4'-O-methyl 
naringénine) and isosakuranetin (3'-hydroxy-4'-O-methylnaringenin) were also 
detected in all biological samples and accounted for 2% of the total flavanones 
in plasma. They were largely present as aglycones. The in vivo hydroxylation of 
flavanones is described here for the first time. Total concentrations of 
naringenin metabolites reached 17.3+/-2.7 microM in plasma 6 hours after the 
beginning of the meal in healthy rats and only 10.6+/-1.3 microM in TuB rats. 
The nature of metabolites was similar in both healthy and TuB rats and in 
plasma, tissues and urine. The lower concentration of flavanones in the TuB rats 
suggests that disease and more particularly cancer, may affect the 
bioavailability of flavonoids.

The phenolic compounds present in 17 samples of Portuguese commercial and three 
homemade quince jams were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, to determine 
their authenticity. Two different extraction methods were needed for the 
complete definition of quince jams profiles, one of them including an Amberlite 
XAD-2 cleaning step. These analyses showed that all the samples presented a 
similar profile composed of at least eight identified phenolic compounds, 
several unidentified characteristic procyanidin polymers, and sodium benzoate as 
preservative of quince jams. Several samples also contained arbutin, suggesting 
that these quince jam samples were fraudulently adulterated with pear puree.

The present study reports the phenolic profile and antiproliferative properties 
of quince (Cydonia oblonga Miller) leaf and fruit (pulp, peel, and seed) against 
human kidney and colon cancer cells. The phenolic profiles of quince methanolic 
extracts were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/diode 
array detector (DAD). 5-O-Caffeoylquinic acid was always one of the two major 
phenolic compounds present in all extracts, except for seed. Our results 
revealed that quince leaf and fruit extracts exhibited distinctive 
antiproliferative activities. The extracts from quince leaf showed 
concentration-dependent growth inhibitory activity toward human colon cancer 
cells (IC(50) = 239.7 +/- 43.2 microg/mL), while no effect was observed in renal 
adenocarcinoma cells. Concerning the fruit, seed extracts exhibited no effect on 
colon cancer cell growth, whereas strong antiproliferative efficiency against 
renal cancer cells was observed for the highest concentration assayed (500 
microg/mL). The antiproliferative activity of pulp and peel extracts was low or 
absent in the selected range of extract concentrations. This is the first report 
showing that C. oblonga may be useful as a cancer chemopreventive and/or 
chemotherapeutic agent.

Isoflavones and carotenoids in four experimental genotypes and Hutcheson 
cultivar soybeans were evaluated as a function of processing treatments and 
maturity. Total isoflavone and carotenoid contents were affected by genotypes 
and maturity stages (p < 0.0001). Total isoflavones ranged from 472 microg/g (in 
NTCPR93-40) to 2280 microg/g (in Hutcheson). Lutein contents ranged from 895 (in 
NTCPR93-286) to 2119 (in Honey Brown), and beta-carotene ranged from 291 (in 
Hutcheson) to 491 (in NICPR92-40) microg/100 g. Mean total isoflavone retention 
percentages in immature Hutcheson soybeans were 46% (boiling), 53% (freezing), 
and 40% (freeze-drying). Mean retentions of lutein and beta-carotene, 
respectively, were 92 and 73% in frozen, 62 and 62% in boiled, and 34 and 27% in 
freeze-dried soybeans. Boiling caused a substantial increase in daidzin, 
genistin, and genistein. The results show that post-harvest changes in total 
isoflavones and carotenoids in soybeans are influenced by processing methods, 
but genotype has an effect on isoflavone and carotenoid profiles during seed 
development.

Total anthocyanin pigments increased from 74.7 to 317 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW) 
from underripe to overripe for Marion blackberries and from 69.9 to 164 mg/100 g 
FW for Evergreen blackberries. Total phenolics did not show a marked change with 
maturity with values slightly decreasing from underripe to ripe. Antioxidant 
activities, while increasing with ripening, also did not show the marked change 
that total anthocyanins exhibited. The impact of variation due to plots, 
subsampling, sample preparation, and measurement on Marion composition was 
examined in detail. Plot-to-plot and sample differences were the major 
contributors to variation, with sample preparation being an important 
contributor for some parameters. Measurement variation was a relatively small 
component of the total variation. Total anthocyanins for 11 blackberry cultivars 
ranged from 131 to 256 mg/100 g FW (mean = 198), total phenolics ranged from 682 
to 1056 mg GAE/100 g FW (mean = 900), oxygen radical absorbance capacity ranged

Apples are an important source of flavonoids in the human diet. The effect of 
processing apples into juice on polyphenolic antioxidant content and activity is 
described. Raw juice obtained from Jonagold apples by pulping and straight 
pressing or after pulp enzyming had an antioxidant activity that was only 10 and 
3%, respectively, of the activity of the fresh apples. The levels of flavonoids 
and chlorogenic acid in the juice were reduced to between 50% (chlorogenic acid) 
and 3% (catechins). Most of the antioxidants were retained in the pomace rather 
than being transferred into the juice. Apparently, most of the antioxidant 
compounds are absorbed to the solid matter of the pomace. In apple juice, 45% of 
the total measured antioxidant activity could be ascribed to the analyzed 
antioxidants. For three apple cultivars tested (Elstar, Golden Delicious, and 
Jonagold), the processing methods had similar effects. The results indicate that 
processing can have a major impact on the bioactivity of products.

The difference in urinary excretion of mammalian and plant lignans in rats was 
determined after oral administration of equivalent doses (25 mg/kg of body 
weight) of 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR), lariciresinol (LAR), matairesinol (MR), 
and secoisolariciresinol (SECO). Twenty-four hours-urine samples were collected 
after a single dose and after administration of one dose/day for 10 days. Eight 
lignans were analysed in urine extracts using a high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method showing good sensitivity and 
repeatability. After a single dose of HMR, LAR, MR, and SECO, the main 
metabolites were 7-hydroxyenterolactone (HENL), cyclolariciresinol (CLAR), 
enterolactone (ENL), and enterodiol (END), respectively, but after 10-day 
exposure ENL was the main metabolite of all the tested lignans, showing a 
considerably higher excretion than after a single dose. Metabolic 
transformations of plant lignans into each other could also be observed.

Twenty-four plant lignans were analyzed by high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in bran extracts of 16 cereal species, 
in four nut species, and in two oilseed species (sesame seeds and linseeds). 
Eighteen of these were lignans previously unidentified in these species, and of 
these, 16 were identified in the analyzed samples. Four different extraction 
methods were applied as follows: alkaline extraction, mild acid extraction, a 
combination of alkaline and mild acid extraction, or accelerated solvent 
extraction. The extraction method was of great importance for the lignan yield. 
7-Hydroxymatairesinol, which has not previously been detected in cereals because 
of destructive extraction methods, was the dominant lignan in wheat, triticale, 
oat, barley, millet, corn bran, and amaranth whole grain. Syringaresinol was the 
other dominant cereal lignan. Wheat and rye bran had the highest lignan content 
of all cereals; however, linseeds and sesame seeds were by far the most 
lignan-rich of the studied species.

In seed extracts of five oilseed species, in bran extracts of three cereal 
species, and in seed and/or whole berry extracts of 10 berry species, the 
concentrations of a large number of lignans and the enantiomeric composition of 
selected lignans were determined. In the case of sesame and hemp seeds, the 
lignan content and composition of the whole seeds was compared to that of the 
hulled seeds. The results showed that cloudberry seeds are the third most 
lignan-rich food source after linseeds and whole sesame seeds, and that most of 
the berry species analysed were more lignan-rich than the cereal brans. The 
lignans are concentrated in the hull of the oilseeds and in the seeds of the 
berries. In most samples, secoisolarici-, pino-, medio-, and syringaresinol were 
present as a mixture of two enantiomers.

A modified high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for 
determination of trans-resveratrol (resveratrol) in peanuts and peanut products 
has been developed. Resveratrol was extracted with acetonitrile-water (90/10, 
v/v) by blending with diatomaceous earth at high speed followed by purification 
of an aliquot of the extract on a minicolumn packed with Al(2)O(3)-ODS (C(18)) 
mixture. The column was eluted with acetonitrile-water (90/10, v/v), eluate was 
evaporated under nitrogen, and residue was dissolved in HPLC mobile phase. 
Resveratrol in an aliquot of purified extract was quantitated by HPLC on silica 
gel with n-hexane-2-propanol-water-acetonitrile-acetic acid (1050/270/17/5/1, 
v/v) as a mobile phase. The recovery of resveratrol added to diatomaceous earth 
at 0.05 microg/g was 98.95 +/- 17.79%; the recovery of the standard added to 
fresh peanuts (with 0.070 microg/g natural level of resveratrol) at 0.50, 5.00, 
and 10.00 microg/g was 117.23 +/- 8.87, 100.10 +/- 2.49, and 100.45 +/- 1.51%, 
respectively. The quantitation limit of resveratrol in fresh peanuts was about 
0. 01 microg/g. Roasted peanuts had the lowest content of resveratrol of 0.055 
+/- 0.023 microg/g (n = 21), while in peanut butter its concentration was 
significantly higher, 0.324 +/- 0.129 microg/g (n = 46), and boiled peanuts had 
the highest level of 5.138 +/- 2.849 microg/g (n = 12). Resveratrol content in 
commercial peanut products was similar to the resveratrol content of the raw 
peanut fractions routinely used for making them.

The concentrations of three polyphenols ((+)-catechin, quercetin and 
trans-resveratrol) in blood serum, plasma and urine, as well as whole blood, 
have been measured after their oral and intragastric administration, 
respectively, to humans and rats. The method developed for this purpose utilized 
ethyl acetate extraction of 100 microl samples and their derivatization with 
bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) followed by gas-chromatographic 
analysis on a DB-5 column followed by mass selective detection employing two 
target ions and one qualifier ion for each compound. Total run time was 17 min 
with excellent resolution and linearity. The limits of detection (LOD) and 
quantitation (LOQ) were an order of magnitude less than for any previously 
published method, being 0.01 microg/l and 0.1 microg/l, respectively, for all 
compounds. Recovery at 1 microg/l and 10 microg/l was >80% in all instances but 
one, and was >90% in 50%. Imprecision was acceptable at 0.25 and 1.0 microg/l, 
concentrations below the LOQ of previous methods. Aglycones released from 
conjugates after hydrolysis were easily measurable. Optimal conditions for 
hydrolysis were established. After oral administration of the three polyphenols 
to humans, their conjugates vastly exceeded the concentrations of the aglycones 
in both plasma and urine. Concentrations peaked within 0.5-1.0 h in plasma and 
within 8 h in urine. During the first 24 h, 5.1% of the (+)-catechin and 24.6% 
of the trans-resveratrol given were recovered in the urine (free plus 
conjugated). This method can be proposed as the method of choice to assay these 
polyphenols and their conjugates in biological fluids.

Fig fruit has been a typical component in the health-promoting Mediterranean 
diet for millennia. To study the potential health-promoting constituents of fig 
fruits, six commercial fig varieties differing in color (black, red, yellow, and 
green) were analyzed for total polyphenols, total flavonoids, antioxidant 
capacity, and amount and profile of anthocyanins. Using reversed-phase liquid 
chromatography (RP-LC), various concentrations of anthocyanins but a similar 
profile was found in all varieties studied. Hydrolysis revealed cyanidin as the 
major aglycon. Proton and carbon NMR confirmed cyanidin-3-O-rhamnoglucoside 
(cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside; C3R) as the main anthocyanin in all fruits. Color 
appearance of fig extract correlated well with total polyphenols, flavonoids, 
anthocyanins, and antioxidant capacity. Extracts of darker varieties showed 
higher contents of phytochemicals compared to lighter colored varieties. Fruit 
skins contributed most of the above phytochemicals and antioxidant activity 
compared to the fruit pulp. Antioxidant capacity correlated well with the 
amounts of polyphenols and anthocyanins (R2 = 0.985 and 0.992, respectively). In 
the dark-colored Mission and the red Brown-Turkey varieties, the anthocyanin 
fraction contributed 36 and 28% of the total antioxidant capacity, respectively. 
C3R contributed 92% of the total antioxidant capacity of the anthocyanin 
fraction. Fruits of the Mission variety contained the highest levels of 
polyphenols, flavonoids, and anthocyanins and exhibited the highest antioxidant 
capacity.

Banana (Musa cavendish) peel, usually discarded as waste, is a polyphenol-rich 
source with antioxidant and chelating properties. This study evaluated its 
ability to mitigate ovarian toxicity induced by a heavy metal mixture (HMM) 
consisting of Hg, Mn, Pb, and Al in female rats. Animals received the HMM with 
or without banana peel extract at 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg dosages for 60 days. 
Co-treatment dose-dependently reduced ovarian metal accumulation, attenuated 
oxidative and nitrosative stress (MDA, NO), restored antioxidant enzyme 
activities (SOD, CAT, GSH, GPx), and modulated pro-inflammatory (IL-6, TNF-α), 
apoptotic (Caspase-3), and transcriptional factors (NF-κB, Nrf2). The gonadal 
endocrine profile also improved gonadotropins (FSH, LH), prolactin (PRL), and 
progesterone (P), which were normalized at the medium dose (400 mg/kg), and 
demonstrated a clear dose-related effect. Histological examination further 
revealed that this dose most effectively improved ovarian tissue. GC-MS analysis 
identified bioactive compounds including resveratrol, proanthocyanidins, and 
anthocyanidins, supporting both antioxidant and chelating actions. These 
findings demonstrate that banana peel extract exerts a dual, dose-dependent 
protective role in the gonad, limiting metal burden while enhancing redox 
defenses, and highlight its translational potential as a sustainable agro-food 
waste product in reproductive toxicology.

Seed coat, cotyledon and embryonic axe fractions of chickpea (Cicer arietinum 
L.) and horse gram (Macrotyloma uniflorum L.) were evaluated for their phenolic 
composition in relation to antioxidant activities. Compositional analysis of 
phenolics by HPLC revealed a wide variation in the distribution of flavonols, 
isoflavones, phenolic acids and anthocyanins among these legume fractions. 
Although cotyledon fractions of both the legumes were rich in phenolic acids, 
the concentrations of flavonols such as quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin 
were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than the embryonic axe and seed coat 
fractions. Ferulic, chlorogenic, caffeic, and vanillic acids were the principal 
phenolic acids found in cotyledons. The most striking difference was the 
predominance of isoflavones in embryonic axe fractions. Although the isoflavone 
genistein was detected in all three fractions of chickpea, it was present 
exclusively in the embryonic axe fraction of horse gram at levels greater than 
daidzein. Furthermore, cyanidin, petunidin, and delphinidin were detected in 
seed coat and embryonic axe fractions but not in cotyledons. In addition to 
these three anthocyanins, malvidin was found only in the horse gram seed coat 
fraction. Seed coat fractions having higher total phenolic indexes were found to 
be the most active 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavengers 
(IC(50) 13.1 to 18.6 microg/mL) followed by embryonic axe and cotyledon 
fractions (IC(50) 15.4 to 34.2 microg/mL). Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) 
scavenging capacities of cotyledons, embryonic axe and seed coats were 12.3, 
34.1 and 78.6% for chickpea and 15.1, 56.8 and 92.6% for horse gram, 
respectively. The multiple antioxidant activity of horse gram and chickpea 
fractions was evident, as they also possessed reducing power and ferrous 
ion-chelating potency. These results contributed to the understanding of the 
relationships between major phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities of 
legumes and provided useful information for effective utilization of 
legume-milled fractions as functional food ingredients for promoting health.

Ten healthy human subjects consumed 500 mL of Choladi green tea, containing 648 
mumol of flavan-3-ols after which plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h 
period and analysed by HPLC-MS. Plasma contained a total of ten metabolites, in 
the form of O-methylated, sulphated and glucuronide conjugates of (epi)catechin 
and (epi)gallocatechin, with 29-126 nM peak plasma concentrations (C(max)) 
occurring 1.6-2.3 h after ingestion, indicative of absorption in the small 
intestine. Plasma also contained unmetabolised (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate 
and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate with respective C(max) values of 55 and 25 nM. 
Urine excreted 0-24 h after consumption of green tea contained 15 metabolites of 
(epi)catechin and (epi)gallocatechin, but (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate and 
(-)-epicatechin-3-gallate were not detected. Overall flavan-3-ol metabolite 
excretion was equivalent to 8.1% of intake, however, urinary (epi)gallocatechin 
metabolites corresponded to 11.4% of (epi)gallocatechin ingestion while 
(epi)catechin metabolites were detected in amounts equivalent to 28.5% of 
(epi)catechin intake. These findings imply that (epi)catechins are highly 
bioavailable, being absorbed and excreted to a much greater extent than most 
other flavonoids. It is also evident that flavan-3-ol metabolites are rapidly 
turned over in the circulatory system and as a consequence C(max) values are not 
an accurate quantitative indicator of the extent to which absorption occurs.

Human subjects drank coffee containing 412 mumol of chlorogenic acids, and 
plasma and urine were collected 0 to 24 h after ingestion and were analyzed by 
high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Within 1 h, some of 
the components in the coffee reached nanomole peak plasma concentrations 
(C(max)), whereas chlorogenic acid metabolites, including caffeic 
acid-3-O-sulfate and ferulic acid-4-O-sulfate and sulfates of 3- and 
4-caffeoylquinic acid lactones, had higher C(max) values. The short time to 
reach C(max) (T(max)) indicates absorption of these compounds in the small 
intestine. In contrast, dihydroferulic acid, its 4-O-sulfate, and dihydrocaffeic 
acid-3-O-sulfate exhibited much higher C(max) values (145-385 nM) with T(max) 
values in excess of 4 h, indicating absorption in the large intestine and the 
probable involvement of catabolism by colonic bacteria. These three compounds, 
along with ferulic acid-4-O-sulfate and dihydroferulic acid-4-O-glucuronide, 
were also major components to be excreted in urine (8.4-37.1 mumol) after coffee 
intake. Feruloylglycine, which is not detected in plasma, was also a major 
urinary component (20.7 mumol excreted). Other compounds, not accumulating in 
plasma but excreted in smaller quantities, included the 3-O-sulfate and 
3-O-glucuronide of isoferulic acid, dihydro(iso)ferulic acid-3-O-glucuronide, 
and dihydrocaffeic acid-3-O-glucuronide. Overall, the 119.9 mumol excretion of 
the chlorogenic acid metabolites corresponded to 29.1% of intake, indicating 
that as well as being subject to extensive metabolism, chlorogenic acids in 
coffee are well absorbed. Pathways for the formation of the various metabolites 
within the body are proposed. Urinary dihydrocaffeic acid-3-O-sulfate and 
feruloylglycine are potentially very sensitive biomarkers for the consumption of 
relatively small amounts of coffee.

Sensory-guided decomposition of roasted cocoa nibs revealed that, besides 
theobromine and caffeine, a series of bitter-tasting 2,5-diketopiperazines and 
flavan-3-ols were the key inducers of the bitter taste as well as the astringent 
mouthfeel imparted upon consumption of roasted cocoa. In addition, a number of 
polyphenol glycopyranosides as well as a series of N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino 
acids have been identified as key astringent compounds of roasted cocoa. In the 
present investigation, a total of 84 putative taste compounds were quantified in 
roasted cocoa beans and then rated for the taste contribution on the basis of 
dose-over-threshold (DoT) factors to bridge the gap between pure structural 
chemistry and human taste perception. To verify these quantitative results, an 
aqueous taste reconstitute was prepared by blending aqueous solutions of the 
individual taste compounds in their ""natural"" concentrations. Sensory analyses 
revealed that the taste profile of this artificial cocktail was very close to 
the taste profile of an aqueous suspension of roasted cocoa nibs. To further 
narrow down the number of key taste compounds, finally, taste omission 
experiments and human dose/response functions were performed, demonstrating that 
the bitter-tasting alkaloids theobromine and caffeine, seven bitter-tasting 
diketopiperazines, seven bitter- and astringent-tasting flavan-3-ols, six 
puckering astringent N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino acids, four velvety astringent 
flavonol glycosides, gamma-aminobutyric acid, beta-aminoisobutyric acid, and six 
organic acids are the key organoleptics of the roasted cocoa nibs.

To investigate probable health benefits of flavonoids and stilbenes in red wine 
a new reversed-phase (RP) high-performance liquid-chromatographic (HPLC) method 
with enhanced separation efficiency and improved selectivity, sensitivity, and 
speed has been established for determination of the flavonoids quercetin, 
myricetin and kaempferol and the stilbenes cis- and trans-resveratrol, in a 
single run . UV-absorbance, fluorescence (FLD), and mass-spectrometric (MS) 
detection were also evaluated. UV-absorbance detection at 320 nm for stilbenes 
and 377 nm for flavonoids enables their determination up to the nanogram range 
with a linearity of R2>0.9999 (linear range 50 ng mL(-1)-50 microg mL(-1)). 
Calculated values of average recoveries were between 95 and 105% for all 
analytes. For resveratrol, fluorescence detection was highly selective and twice 
as sensitive as UV detection, and linearity was satisfactory (R2>0.9996; linear 
range see UV detection). For the detection of the hydrophilic glycosidic 
compounds piceid and rutin, which are coeluted with other hydrophilic 
ingredients, the validated RP HPLC system was coupled to a quadrupole ion-trap 
mass-spectrometer (MS) via an electrospray interface (ESI) with 25% ammonia 
solution as sheath liquid. MS detection was, highly linear (R2>0.9878; linear 
range 50 ng mL(-1)-50 microg mL(-1)) for all investigated analytes and the 
limits of detection were in the low nanogram range. Compared with UV detection 
MS detection resulted in a 200% increase in signal intensity for myricetin and 
400% increases for quercetin and kaempferol, but equal signal intensity for 
resveratrol. Calculated values of average recoveries were 102% for myricetin and 
79% for piceid. Collision induced dissociation (CID) was also used to obtain 
characteristic fragmentation fingerprints to facilitate qualitative and 
quantitative analysis even in complex matrices. Finally, this hyphenated 
HPLC-ESI-MS method was highly suitable and an essential improvement compared 
with UV- and fluorescence detection.

A method for quantitation of six prenylflavonoids (xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, 
desmethylxanthohumol, 6- and 8-prenylnaringenins and 6-geranylnaringenin) in 
hops and beer by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry has been developed. The method 
allows direct analysis of beer and crude methanolic extracts of hops. After HPLC 
separation, prenylflavonoids were detected by positive ion multiple-reaction 
monitoring using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a heated 
nebulizer--atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface. The accuracy and 
precision were evaluated by replicate analyses of (spiked) samples. Thirteen 
commercial beers were analysed with the method. Isoxanthohumol, formed by 
isomerization of xanthohumol during the brewing process, was the most abundant 
flavonoid in hopped beers, ranging from 0.04 to 3.44 mg/l.

The flavonol contents of 20 varieties of tomato fruit were investigated in 
relation to variety, size, season, and country of origin. Ten commonly consumed 
tomato-based food products were also assessed. Free and conjugated flavonols 
were identified and quantified using reversed-phase HPLC. Ninety-eight percent 
of flavonols detected in tomatoes were found to occur in the skin. Tomatoes 
contained, primarily as conjugates, quercetin and kaempferol. The main quercetin 
conjugate was identified as rutin (quercetin 3-rhamnosylglucoside) by LC-MS. The 
total flavonol content of the different varieties of tomato that were analyzed 
varied from 1.3 to 22.2 microgram/g of fresh weight (fw). Smaller cherry tomato 
fruits originating from warm sunny climates, such as Spain and Israel, were 
found to contain the highest concentration of flavonols. Among the tomato-based 
products investigated, tomato juice and tomato purée were rich in flavonols, 
containing 14-16 microgram/mL and 70 microgram/g fw, respectively. In contrast 
to fresh tomatoes, most tomato-based products contained significant amounts of 
free flavonols.

Teas represent a rich source of dietary antioxidants. This paper describes 
analysis of the antioxidant potential of individual tea phenolics using an 
on-line high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Tea phenolics from 
Kenyan green and black teas were identified using liquid chromatography--mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) in conjunction with the analysis of their 
2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS+) radical scavenging 
ability. Antioxidant potential of flavan-3-ols, caffeoylquinic acids, flavonols, 
and theaflavins was assessed in comparison to the synthetic vitamin E analogue 
Trolox. (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate was identified as the most potent 
antioxidant with a Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) value of 3.0, 
contributing approximately 30% of the total antioxidant capacity of green tea. 
Theaflavins retained antioxidant capacity similar to that of (-)-epicatechin 
monomers whilst conjugated flavonols did not contribute significantly to the 
antioxidant capacity of either green or black tea. After HPLC analysis of the 
antioxidant capacity of phenolics in black tea some 80% of antioxidant activity 
remained unaccounted for indicating the potential importance of thearubigens as 
antioxidants in black teas.

specific anthocyanins-cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-sambubioside, 
cyanidin-3-rutinoside, and cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside, as well as ellagic 
acid. Subjects were fed 45 g of freeze-dried BRB daily for 7 days. Blood samples 
were collected predose on days 1 and 7 and at 10 time points postdose. Urine was 
collected for 12 hours predose on days 1 and 7 and at three 4-hour intervals 
postdose. Maximum concentrations of anthocyanins and ellagic acid in plasma 
occurred at 1 to 2 hours, and maximum quantities in urine appeared from 0 to 4 
hours. Overall, less than 1% of these compounds were absorbed and excreted in 
urine. None of the pharmacokinetic parameters changed significantly between days 
1 and 7. In conclusion, 45 g of freeze-dried BRB daily are well tolerated and 
result in quantifiable anthocyanins and ellagic acid in plasma and urine.

BACKGROUND: The organic food sales have been increasing during the recent years. 
It has been hypothesised that organically grown fruits are healthier based on 
their higher content of phytochemicals. However, data on the bioavailability of 
phytochemicals from organically or conventionally produced plant foods are 
scarce.
METHODS: Two human intervention studies were performed to compare the 
bioavailability of polyphenols in healthy men after ingestion of apples from 
different farming systems. The administered apples were grown organically and 
conventionally under defined conditions and characterised regarding their 
polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity. No significant differences in the 
polyphenol content and the antioxidant capacity from the organic and 
conventional farming system were observed.
RESULTS: In the short-term intervention study, six men consumed either 
organically or conventionally produced apples in a randomized cross-over study. 
After intake of 1 kg apples, phloretin (C (max) 13 + or - 5 nmol/l, t (max) 1.7 
+ or - 1.2 h) and coumaric acid (C (max )35 + or - 12 nmol/l, t (max) 3.0 + or - 
0.8 h) plasma concentrations increased significantly (P < 0.0001) in both 
intervention groups, without differences between the two farming systems. In the 
long-term intervention study, 43 healthy volunteers consumed organically or 
conventionally produced apples (500 g/day; 4 weeks) or no apples in a 
double-blind, randomized intervention study. In this study, 24 h after the last 
dosing regime, the apple intake did not result in increasing polyphenol 
concentrations in plasma and urine compared to the control group suggesting no 
accumulation of apple polyphenols or degradation products in humans.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the two farming systems 
(organic/conventional) do not result in differences in the bioavailability of 
apple polyphenols.

An extract from flaxseed containing oligomeric structures of the phenolic 
glucosides secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), p-coumaric acid glucoside and 
ferulic acid glucoside was fractionated into three oligomeric fractions (F50, 
F60 and F70) by reversed phase liquid chromatography and further subfractionated 
by Sepharose CL-6B. The F50 fraction, which had the highest proportion of 
hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides, was also fractionated on Sephadex LH-20 
according to hydrophobicity and size. The different separations resulted in 
complex profiles of UV-absorbing molecules. HPLC analyses indicated that 
reversed-phase chromatography separated the oligomers according to composition 
of the phenolic glucosides, while the subfractionation revealed that other 
structural features of the oligomers were also important. Using the DPPH 
radical, SDG and oligomeric fractions showed similar hydrogen-donating abilities 
comparable to ferulic acid but higher than α-tocopherol, which suggests that SDG 
was the only active antioxidant.

Three phenolic glucosides, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, p-coumaric acid 
glucoside and ferulic acid glucoside, were analyzed in commercial breads 
containing flaxseed. The total phenolic glucoside content ranged from 15 to 
157mg/100g dry bread. Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside was the dominating 
phenolic glucoside with an average relative content of 62%, followed by 
p-coumaric acid glucoside (20%) and ferulic acid glucoside (18%). Strong 
positive correlations between the phenolic glucosides were found, indicating no 
major effect of raw material or bread-making process on the relative content of 
the phenolic glucosides in flaxseed.

This research studies in detail the contents of phenolic compounds determined by 
the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and the antioxidant activities determined by the 
TEAC (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity), DPPH (using 
diphenyl-p-picrylhydrazyl radical), and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) 
methods, and their correlations for used standards with these methods 
(catechine, gallic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, Trolox, ascorbic acid, and 
ferrous sulfate) and extracts from several species of commonly consumed 
vegetables were studied in detail. The comparison of absolute values of 
absorption coefficients for used standards and for individual methods allows one 
to choose optimal common standards for methods to be compared. The procedures 
applied for the same sets of the extracts using identical calibration procedures 
and common standards allowed better comparison of the results obtained by the 
TEAC, DPPH, and FRAP methods. The values of content of phenolic substances and 
total antioxidant activity of the sets of samples correlate very well for all 
used methods. The very high values of antioxidant activity were found in 
intensely colored vegetables (red cabbage, red onion, etc.), and the values were 
very low in watery vegetables such as potato, marrow, and cucumber.

Consumption of fruits and vegetables has been associated with reduced risk of 
chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Phytochemicals, 
especially phenolics, in fruits and vegetables are suggested to be the major 
bioactive compounds for the health benefits. However, the phenolic contents and 
their antioxidant activities in fruits and vegetables were underestimated in the 
literature, because bound phenolics were not included. This study was designed 
to investigate the profiles of total phenolics, including both soluble free and 
bound forms in common fruits, by applying solvent extraction, base digestion, 
and solid-phase extraction methods. Cranberry had the highest total phenolic 
content, followed by apple, red grape, strawberry, pineapple, banana, peach, 
lemon, orange, pear, and grapefruit. Total antioxidant activity was measured 
using the TOSC assay. Cranberry had the highest total antioxidant activity 
(177.0 +/- 4.3 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of fruit), followed by apple, red 
grape, strawberry, peach, lemon, pear, banana, orange, grapefruit, and 
pineapple. Antiproliferation activities were also studied in vitro using HepG(2) 
human liver-cancer cells, and cranberry showed the highest inhibitory effect 
with an EC(50) of 14.5 +/- 0.5 mg/mL, followed by lemon, apple, strawberry, red 
grape, banana, grapefruit, and peach. A bioactivity index (BI) for dietary 
cancer prevention is proposed to provide a new alternative biomarker for future 
epidemiological studies in dietary cancer prevention and health promotion.

BACKGROUND: Consumer demand for products rich in phytochemicals is increasing as 
a result of greater awareness of their potential health benefits. However, 
processed products are stored for long-term and the phytochemicals are 
susceptible to degradation during storage. The objective of this study was to 
assess the storage effects on phytochemicals in thermally processed blueberries. 
Thermally processed canned berries and juice/puree were analysed for 
phytochemicals during their long-term storage.
RESULTS: The phytochemical retention of thermally processed blueberries during 
storage was not influenced by production system (conventional versus organic). 
During 13 months of storage, total anthocyanins, total phenolics and total 
antioxidant activity in canned blueberry solids decreased by up to 86, 69 and 
52% respectively. In canned blueberry syrup, total anthocyanins and total 
antioxidant activity decreased by up to 68 and 15% respectively, while total 
phenolic content increased by up to 117%. Similar trends in phytochemical 
content were observed in juice/puree stored for 4 months. The extent of changes 
in phytochemicals of thermally processed blueberries during storage was 
significantly influenced by blanching.
CONCLUSION: Long-term storage of thermally processed blueberries had varying 
degrees of influence on degradation of total anthocyanins, total phenolics and 
total antioxidant activity. Blanching before thermal processing helped to 
preserve the phytochemicals during storage of blueberries.

Anthocyanins are present in human diet due to their wide occurrence in fruits 
and beverages. They possess antioxidant activities and could be involved in 
several health effects. The aim of this study was to investigate anthocyanin 
metabolism and distribution in the digestive area organs (stomach, jejunum and 
liver) and kidney, as well as a target tissue (brain) in rats fed with a 
blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.) anthocyanin-enriched diet for 15 days. 
Identification and quantification of anthocyanin metabolites was carried out by 
HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC-DAD, respectively. The stomach exhibited only native 
blackberry anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-pentose), while 
in other organs (jejunum, liver, and kidney) native and methylated anthocyanins 
as well as conjugated anthocyanidins (cyanidin and peonidin monoglucuronides) 
were identified. Proportions of anthocyanin derivatives differed according to 
the organ considered, with the liver presenting the highest proportion of 
methylated forms. Jejunum and plasma also contained aglycone forms. In the 
brain, total anthocyanin content (blackberry anthocyanins and peonidin 
3-O-glucoside) reached 0.25 +/- 0.05 nmol/g of tissue (n = 6). The urinary 
excretion of total anthocyanins was low (0.19 +/- 0.02% of the ingested amount). 
Thus, organs of the digestive area indicated a metabolic pathway of anthocyanins 
with enzymatic conversions (methylation and/or glucurono-conjugation). Moreover, 
following consumption of an anthocyanin-rich diet, anthocyanins enter the brain.

Physicochemical analysis of processed strained product was performed on 10 
carrot genotypes grown in Texas (TX) and Georgia (GA). Carrots from GA 
experienced hail damage during growth, resulting in damage to their tops. 
Measurements included pH, moisture, soluble phenolics, total carotenoids, 
sugars, organic acids, and isocoumarin (6-MM). Sensory analysis was conducted 
using a trained panel to evaluate relationships between chemical and sensory 
attributes of the genotypes and in carrots spiked with increasing levels of 
6-MM. Preharvest stress conditions in GA carrots seemed to elicit a phytoalexic 
response, producing compounds that impacted the perception of bitter and sour 
flavors. Spiking 6-MM into strained carrots demonstrated the role bitter 
compounds have in lowering sweetness scores while increasing the perception of 
sour flavor. Screening fresh carrots for the phytoalexin 6-MM has the potential 
to significantly improve the sensory quality of processed products.

This investigation evaluated the content and profile of flavanoid and phenolic 
acid compounds present in nine Vaccinium species that included domestic 
blueberry cultivars and sample collections from undomesticated colonies. The 
study was focused in two areas of inquiry. The first involved extracting and 
analyzing the berries for total phenolics (TPH), total anthocyanins (ACY), and 
the antioxidant capacity. Vaccinium species differ in their polyphenolic 
content, and these high TPH and ACY levels are correlated to their antioxidant 
capacity. Second, berry extracts were analyzed by high-performance liquid 
chromatography equipped with photodiode array and mass spectrometric detectors 
to determine the content and profile of selected bioactive compounds. The 
flavanoid analytes of interest included the anthocyanidins, flavan-3-ols, and 
flavonol aglycons, as well as specific phenolic acid components. This 
semicomprehensive analysis begins to characterize the phytochemical profiles and 
illustrates the differences in the content of polyphenolic compounds present 
within these Vaccinium species.

A method using simple extraction and 2-directional high-performance thin-layer 
chromatography (HPTLC) was developed for the simultaneous determination of 
curcumin, metanil yellow, and sudan dyes in turmeric, chili, and various mixed 
curry powder formulations. The method offers resolution (Rf) of turmeric 
pigments, namely, curcumin (0.77), demethoxycurcumin (0.69), 
bis(demethoxy)curcumin (0.61), and the synthetic dye metanil yellow (0.05) by 
the first-directional mobile phase, chloroform-methanol (9 + 1, v/v). The 
resolution (Rf) of sudan I (0.30) and sudan IV (0.23) was achieved by the 
second-directional mobile phase, toluene-hexane-acetic acid (50 + 50 + 1, 
v/v/v). Natural pigments of both turmeric and chili showed no interference in 
the detection and quantification of synthetic colors. The limit of detection and 
limit of quantification values for curcumin, metanil yellow, sudan I, and sudan 
IV were 17.39, 42.90, 15.45, and 7.01 and 52.71,130.0, 46.80, and 21.24 ng/spot, 
respectively. Analysis of a few market samples showed the presence of metanil 
yellow (1.5-4.6 mg/g), sudan I (4.8-12.1 mg/g), and sudan IV (0.9-2.0 mg/g) in 
loose turmeric and chili samples, whereas the curcumin content in turmeric and 
mixed curry powder samples ranged from 6.5 to 36.4 and from 0.3 to 1.9 mg/g, 
respectively. The method is relatively simple, offers reasonable sensitivity, 
and can be used to screen a large number of samples.

Phytoestrogens may play a role in hormone-related diseases such as cancer, but 
epidemiological and clinical data are conflicting in part due to inadequate 
databases used in intake estimation. A database of nine phytoestrogens in foods 
relevant to Western diets was developed to more accurately estimate intakes. 
Foods (N = 121) available in Ontario, Canada were prepared as commonly consumed 
and analyzed for isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, glycitein, formononetin), 
lignans (secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, pinoresinol, lariciresinol), and 
coumestan (coumestrol) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. Data 
were presented on an as is (wet) basis per 100 g and per serving. Food groups 
with decreasing levels of total phytoestrogens per 100 g are nuts and oilseeds, 
soy products, cereals and breads, legumes, meat products, and other processed 
foods that may contain soy, vegetables, fruits, alcoholic, and nonalcoholic 
beverages. Soy products contain the highest amounts of isoflavone, followed by 
legumes, meat products and other processed foods, cereals and breads, nuts and 
oilseeds, vegetables, alcoholic beverages, fruits, and nonalcoholic beverages. 
Decreasing amounts of lignans are found in nuts and oilseeds, cereals and 
breads, legumes, fruits, vegetables, soy products, processed foods, alcoholic, 
and nonalcoholic beverages. The richest sources of specific phytoestrogens, 
including coumestrol, were identified. The database will improve phytoestrogen 
intake estimation in future epidemiological and clinical studies particularly in 
Western populations.

Anthocyanins are the most abundant phenolic compounds, widely distributed in 
fruits and vegetables, and exhibit potent antioxidant capacity. Humans ingest a 
significant amount of anthocyanins in the daily diet. The objective of the 
current study was to examine human absorption and metabolism of black raspberry 
anthocyanins when administered at high doses (2.69 +/- 0.085 g/day). Ten healthy 
men consumed 45 g of freeze-dried black raspberries daily for 1 week. Urine 
samples were collected over a 12 h period in 4 h intervals at day 1 and day 7. 
Urinary anthocyanins were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography 
coupled to a photodiode array detector and a tandem mass spectrometer using 
precursor ion and product ion analyses. Anthocyanins were excreted in intact 
forms and metabolized into methylated derivatives in human urine. The urinary 
excretion of anthocyanins reached a maximum concentration (1091.8 +/- 1081.3 
pmol/L, n = 10) during the 4-8 h period after black raspberry ingestion. As 
compared to the anthocyanin distribution in black raspberries, urinary cyanidin 
3-xylosylrutinoside was detected at a higher concentration than that of 
cyanidin-3-rutinoside.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) has become a critical global public health issue 
worldwide. Tartary buckwheat extracts exhibit potential therapeutic effects 
against ALD due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. However, in 
vivo pharmacokinetics and metabolite identification of tartary buckwheat 
extracts have not been clearly elucidated. Accordingly, the current manuscript 
aimed to investigate pharmacokinetics and to identify novel metabolites in 
beagle dogs following oral co-administration of tartary buckwheat extracts and 
ethanol. To support pharmacokinetic study, a simple LC-MS/MS method was 
developed and validated for simultaneous determination of quercetin and 
kaempferol in beagle dog plasma. The conjugated forms of both analytes were 
hydrolyzed by β-glucuronidase and sulfatase followed by liquid-liquid extraction 
using methyl tert-butyl ether. In addition, another effective approach was 
established using advanced ultrafast liquid chromatography coupled with a 
Q-Exactive hybrid quadrupole orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometer to 
identify the metabolites in beagle dog biological samples including urine, 
feces, and plasma. The pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that the absolute oral 
bioavailability for quercetin and kaempferol was determined to be 4.6% and 1.6%, 
respectively. Oral bioavailability of quercetin and kaempferol was limited in 
dogs probably due to poor absorption, significant first pass effect, and biliary 
elimination, etc. Using high resolution mass spectrometric analysis, a total of 
nine novel metabolites were identified for the first time and metabolic pathways 
included methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfation. In vivo pharmacokinetics 
and metabolite identification results provided preclinical support of 
co-administration of tartary buckwheat extracts and ethanol in humans.

This study reports tannin contents of various tea (19), beer (6) and wine (6) 
samples, produced or sold in Turkey under different brand names. Determinations 
were carried out by employing a previously reported UV-vis spectrophotometric 
method. The standard addition procedure was also compared to the direct 
determination procedure and found to be more reliable. The tannin contents of 
hot water extracts of tea, tea bag and herbal tea samples ranged between 
6.20-8.33, 8.03-6.59 and 2.76-6.54 percent (w/w) respectively. Tannin contents 
of beer and wine samples determined without extraction were found ranging 
between 66.36-77.26 and 67.18-107.62 micrograms/mL respectively. Iron contents 
of analysed wine samples were also found ranging between 0.36 and 10.33 ppm by 
AAS and no relation is found between tannin and iron contents.

The phenolic compounds of 25 peach, nectarine, and plum cultivars were studied 
and quantified by HPLC-DAD-ESIMS. Hydroxycinnamates, procyanidins, flavonols, 
and anthocyanins were detected and quantified. White and yellow flesh nectarines 
and peaches, and yellow and red plums, were analyzed at two different maturity 
stages with consideration of both peel and flesh tissues. HPLC-MS analyses 
allowed the identification of procyanidin dimers of the B- and A-types, as well 
as the presence of procyanidin trimers in plums. As a general rule, the peel 
tissues contained higher amounts of phenolics, and anthocyanins and flavonols 
were almost exclusively located in this tissue. No clear differences in the 
phenolic content of nectarines and peaches were detected or between white flesh 
and yellow flesh cultivars. There was no clear trend in phenolic content with 
ripening of the different cultivars. Some cultivars, however, had a very high 
phenolic content. For example, the white flesh nectarine cultivar Brite Pearl 
(350-460 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 430-550 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) and 
the yellow flesh cv. Red Jim (180-190 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 210-330 mg/kg 
procyanidins in flesh), contained 10 times more phenolics than cultivars such as 
Fire Pearl (38-50 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 23-30 mg/kg procyanidins in 
flesh). Among white flesh peaches, cultivars Snow King (300-320 mg/kg 
hydroxycinnamates and 660-695 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) and Snow Giant 
(125-130 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 520-540 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) showed 
the highest content. The plum cultivars Black Beaut and Angeleno were especially 
rich in phenolics.

Cocoa is a food rich in polyphenols, mainly the flavonoid procyanidins and 
flavan-3-ols. The improvement of the cardiovascular function in humans upon 
cocoa consumption has been specifically linked to the presence of flavan-3-ol 
derived metabolites in plasma, especially epicatechin glucuronide. In this 
context, a flavonoid-enriched cocoa-derived product could potentially exert 
stronger health benefits. The aim of the present study was to obtain a cocoa 
powder with a higher flavonoid content (mainly enriched in monomer compounds) 
and assess its flavonoid bioavailability in humans. For this purpose, an 
unfermented, nonroasted, and blanch-treated cocoa powder (A) was obtained. The 
powder contained four times more procyanidins than a conventional (B) cocoa 
powder. Powder A contained eight times more epicatechin and procyanidin B2 than 
powder B. Cocoa milk drinks were prepared with powder A (MDA) and B (MDB). The 
bioavailability of flavonoids in both drinks was assessed in a crossover 
intervention with healthy volunteers. The content of epicatechin glucuronide, 
the main metabolite detected in plasma, was five-fold higher upon consumption of 
MDA as compared with MDB. The urinary excretion of metabolites, mainly methyl 
epicatechin sulfate, was higher upon MDA consumption as compared with MDB, 
ranging from two- to 12-fold higher depending on the metabolite. These results, 
together with previous reports regarding the cardiovascular benefits linked to 
the presence of procyanidin metabolites in plasma, suggest that further clinical 
trials to validate the health benefits of a flavonoid-enriched cocoa powder are 
warranted.

All drying processes increased oil content, antioxidant activity, total phenolic 
contents, and most of the phenolic compounds in the pulp, peel and seeds of both 
ripe fruits with varied degrees (p < 0.05). In addition, the processes reduced 
the oil contents, linoleic acids, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, (+)-catechin, and 
naringenin of the pulp, antioxidant activity of the peels and seeds, and 
3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, (+)-catechin of the seeds and it enhanced all other 
parameters in the pulp, peel, and seeds of unripe fruits (p < 0.05). Comparing 
the phenolic profiles of avocado pulp, peels, and seeds of ripe and unripe 
fruits indicated that the peel and seeds are richer than the pulp and that is 
superior in unripe fruits than ripe ones. In addition, drying processes 
particularly microwave and air drying greatly enhanced the bioactive properties 
of ripe and unripe avocado fruits and could thus be used to elongate the 
shelf-life of avocado fruit products without major impact on the overall 
quality.

Consumption of flavonoid-rich foods and beverages is thought to reduce the risk 
of cardiovascular diseases. Whereas the biological activities of flavonoids have 
been characterized in vitro, there are no clear experimental data demonstrating 
that chronic dietary intake and intestinal absorption of flavonoids actually 
protects the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury. We tested whether 
long-term consumption of specific flavonoids (anthocyanins) included in normal 
food could render the heart of rats more resistant to myocardial infarction. 
Maize kernels that differed specifically in their accumulation of anthocyanins 
were used to prepare rodent food in which anthocyanins were either present or 
absent. Male Wistar rats were fed the anthocyanin-rich (ACN-rich) or the 
anthocyanin-free (ACN-free) diet for a period of 8 wk. Anthocyanins were 
significantly absorbed and detected in the blood and urine of only rats fed the 
ACN-rich diet. In Langendorff preparations, the hearts of rats fed the ACN-rich 
diet were more resistant to regional ischemia and reperfusion insult. Moreover, 
on an in vivo model of coronary occlusion and reperfusion, infarct size was 
reduced in rats that ate the ACN-rich diet than in those that consumed the 
ACN-free diet (P < 0.01). Cardioprotection was associated with increased 
myocardial glutathione levels, suggesting that dietary anthocyanins might 
modulate cardiac antioxidant defenses. Our findings suggest important potential 
health benefits of foods rich in anthocyanins and emphasize the need to develop 
anthocyanin-rich functional foods with protective activities for promoting human 
health.

Rats were fed a grape seed extract (GSE) containing (+)-catechin, 
(-)-epicatechin and dimers, trimers, tetramers and polymeric procyanidins. 
Liver, kidney, brain and gastrointestinal (GI) tract together with plasma, urine 
and faeces were collected over a 24 h period and their flavan-3-ol content was 
analysed by HPLC with tandem mass spectrometry and diode array detection. Small 
amounts of the GSE flavan-3-ols moved out of the stomach and into the 
duodenum/jejunum, and to a greater extent the ileum 1 h after ingestion, and 
into the caecum after 2 h with relatively small amounts being detected in the 
colon after 3 h. The GI tract contained the parent GSE flavan-3-ols and 
procyanidins with only trace amounts of metabolites and there were no 
indications that proanthocyanidins were depolymerised in the GI tract releasing 
monomeric flavan-3-ols. Plasma contained exclusively catechin glucuronides and 
methylated glucuronide metabolites which were also detected in the liver and 
kidneys. These metabolites were also present in urine together with sulphated 
metabolites and low amounts of the procyanidin dimers B1, B2, B3 and B4 as well 
as the trimer C2 and an unknown GSE trimer. The amounts of (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin metabolites excreted in urine relative to the quantity of the 
monomers ingested were 27 and 36 %, respectively, after 24 h. This is similar to 
the levels of urinary excretion reported to occur by other investigators after 
feeding (-)-epicatechin to rats and provides further, albeit indirect, evidence 
that the procyanidin oligomers in the GSE were not depolymerised to monomers to 
any extent after ingestion. No convincing analytical data were obtained for the 
presence of flavan-3-ol metabolites in the brain.

Polyphenolic compounds of apple may play an important role in physiologic 
functions related to human health. Different polyphenolics may have varied 
biological activities including antioxidant activity. The objective of this 
study was to investigate the profiles of polyphenolic compounds in different 
apple varieties and different parts of an apple. The total and individual 
polyphenolics differed significantly among the eight apple cultivars grown in 
Ontario, and the peels had higher concentrations than the flesh. Among the 
tested cultivars, Red Delicious and Northern Spy had the highest concentrations 
and Empire the lowest. Five major polyphenolic groups with a total of 16 
identified individual compounds were found, among which the dihydroxycinnamic 
acid esters, phloretin glycosides, and flavan-3-ols were found in both flesh and 
peel, whereas quercetin glycosides were almost exclusively found in the peel. 
Cyanidin 3-galactoside was unique to and found only in red apple peels. In both 
apple peel and flesh, the predominant group of polyphenolics was the 
procyanidins, followed by quercetin glycosides in the peel and hydroxycinnamic 
acid esters in the flesh. 3-Hydroxyphloretin 2'-xyloglucoside was newly 
identified in apple. The results obtained in this study will further the 
understanding of the polyphenolic composition of apples and their roles in 
health-promoting physiological functions.

Black rice (BR) is beneficial for the health of animals and humans. Herein, we 
investigated the pharmacokinetics of cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), a major 
anthocyanin constituent of BR, in male rats. After its intravenous 
administration, C3G was rapidly distributed throughout the body and disappeared 
from the plasma. Its cumulative urinary excretion accounted for less than 20% of 
the dose administered. After a single dose of BR extract (C3G40) containing C3G 
was orally administered (300 mg C3G/kg body weight), the C3G plasma 
concentration peaked at 30 min and then rapidly declined within 4 h. The extent 
of the cumulative urinary excretion of C3G, together with the area under the 
curve (AUC) of the plasma C3G concentration, indicated a bioavailability of 
approximately 0.5-1.5%. These results suggest that C3G was rapidly absorbed from 
the gastrointestinal tract in rats; however, its plasma concentration was very 
low. We also examined the enhancing effect of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), a 
pungent component of wasabi, on the gastrointestinal absorption of C3G in rats. 
Following the co-administration of C3G with AITC dissolved in PEG200, the 
urinary excretion and AUC of C3G were 4.5- and 2.7-fold higher than those in the 
control group (without AITC) (p<0.01), respectively. This is the first study to 
show that the gastrointestinal absorption of BR anthocyanins is promoted by 
AITC.

Hydroxytyrosol is quantitatively and qualitatively the principal phenolic 
antioxidant in olive oil. Recently it was shown that hydroxytyrosol and five 
metabolites were excreted in urine when hydroxytyrosol was dosed intravenously 
or orally in an olive oil solution to rats. The conclusive identification of 
three metabolites of hydroxytyrosol by MS/MS as a monosulfate conjugate, a 
3-O-glucuronide conjugate, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid 
(homovanillic acid) has been established in this investigation. The structural 
configurations of the glucuronide conjugate and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic 
acid were confirmed by (1)H NMR. The radical scavenging potencies of 
homovanillic acid, homovanillic alcohol, hydroxytyrosol, and the metabolites 
were examined with the radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. These studies 
showed them to be potent antioxidants with SC(50) values of 14.8 and 11.4 microM 
for homovanillic acid and homovanillic alcohol, respectively. The 
3-O-glucuronide conjugate was more potent than hydroxytyrosol, with an SC(50) of 
2.3 in comparison to 11.0 microM, and the monosulfate conjugate was almost 
devoid of radical scavenging activity.

The effect of fresh-cutting and subsequent cold storage on phenolic compounds 
from five long-term-stored potato cultivars (Agria, Cara, Liseta, Monalisa, and 
Spunta) was studied. Fresh-cutting induced the biosynthesis of three flavonols, 
which were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESIMS as quercetin 3-rutinoside, quercetin 
3-diglucoside, and quercetin 3-glucosylrutinoside. The flavonols were detected 
after a lag period of 3 days of cold storage. The content ranged from 6 to 14 
mg/100 g of fresh weight depending on the cultivar after 6 days of storage. 
Chlorogenic acid as the main caffeic acid derivative and the amino acids 
tyrosine and tryptophan were also quantified. The effect of cold storage under 
light or in dark was studied with new-season-harvested Monalisa potatoes. The 
flavonol induction was higher in fresh-cut potatoes stored under light than in 
the dark. However, caffeic acid derivatives were not affected. Domestic cooking 
such as boiling, microwaving, and frying provoked a partial loss of the 
flavonols, which were retained in the range of 4-16 mg per serving (213 g). 
Steam-cooking resulted in the highest retention of caffeic acid derivatives and 
aromatic amino acids compared with the other cooking methods studied. This means 
that due to the large amount of potatoes consumed in the Western diet, fresh-cut 
potatoes can be a significant source of health-promoting phenolics.

PURPOSE: Some studies have suggested that Glycated albumin (GA) may represent a 
useful biomarker in pregnant women for diagnosing and monitoring gestational 
diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, whether GA is a sufficiently accurate marker 
to screen GDM in a general population of pregnant women remains unclear. The 
current study aimed to investigate the role of GA in screening GDM in Chinese 
pregnant women.
METHODS: In this study, 298 Chinese women between 24-28 weeks of gestation were 
included. A total number of 247 women with normal glucose tolerance and 51 with 
GDM were identified according to the glucose levels detection. GA concentrations 
(GA%) were measured using three different kits, all of which utilized the 
ketoamine oxidase method for analysis.
RESULTS: Firstly, we found the GA% levels of the GDM group were significantly 
higher than those of healthy control. Specifically, the GA% level of the healthy 
control using Lucica, Maccura, Gcell was respectively 12.86 ± 0.8458, 
13.40 ± 0.9344 or 10.98 ± 1.009, while that of the GDM patients was respectively 
13.21 ± 1.101, 13.78 ± 1.219 and 11.44 ± 1.449. Then, the Receiving operator 
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that the areas under the curve 
(AUC) of all kits were less than 0.7 (Lucica, AUC = 0.6149; Maccura, 
AUC = 0.6140; Gcell, AUC = 0.6078), which do not provide support for the 
utilization of GA as a screening tool for GDM.
CONCLUSION: GA is not a good indicator for screening GDM initially.

BACKGROUND: Nutritional biomarkers are alternatives to traditional dietary 
assessment tools. We sought to develop a method for nutritional analysis of 
resveratrol, a phenolic compound with purported health-promoting properties, and 
to determine all resveratrol metabolites.
METHODS: We obtained LDL and urine samples from 11 healthy male volunteers who 
had consumed 250 mL of Merlot red wine. We measured resveratrol and its 
metabolites with 96-well solid-phase extraction plates coupled with HPLC-tandem 
mass spectrometry. Hexestrol was used as the internal standard. Gradient 
chromatography in multiple reaction monitoring mode was performed on a Luna 
C(18) column, maintained at 40 degrees C; m/z transitions were as follows: 
resveratrol, 227/185; resveratrol glucosides, 389/227; resveratrol glucuronides, 
403/227; resveratrol sulfates, 307/227; taxifolin, 303/285; and hexestrol, 
269/134.
RESULTS: Standard calibration curves were linear at 4.4-3289.5 nmol/L. Residual 
analyses were 100% (3.2) for trans-resveratrol and 100% (11.1) for trans-piceid. 
In both matrices, imprecision (CV) was <10.8% at all concentrations. Detection 
limits for resveratrol were 0.2 nmol/L (LDL), 0.3 nmol/L (synthetic urine), and 
4.0 nmol/L (blank urine). Resveratrol and metabolites were checked for 
stability, and no degradation was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry method enabled us to identify 
resveratrol sulfates in human LDL and to characterize the complete profile of 
resveratrol metabolism in human LDL and urine. This method provides an accurate 
index of exposure to resveratrol and its metabolites, which can be used as 
nutritional biomarkers for evaluating the biological effects of moderate wine 
intake on human health.

When discovered in the 50's, isoflavones were suspected to provoke infertility 
syndrome in sheep grazing on clover. Many others effects of these phytoestrogens 
have been documented afterwards. To determine the distribution of isoflavone 
metabolites in ewe tissues and look for a link with their physiological impact, 
two ewes were fed a diet containing 50% red clover silage (variety Pawera) for 
one month with a daily intake of 157.6 mg/kg bw of total isoflavones. Only 
aglycones were fed due to the fermentation stage of the silage. At the 
sacrifice, isoflavone metabolites and aglycones were analyzed in blood, liver, 
kidney, lung, heart, muscle, ovaries, uterus, mammary glands, suprarenal glands, 
thymus, aorta, thyroid, pituitary gland, cerebellum, olfactory lobes, and brain 
hemispheres using HPLC-Coularray and LC-MS-MS. The major compounds recovered in 
tissues were equol and daidzein, present as glucuronides. Kidney concentrations 
were 10-fold higher than in other tissues. Penetration in brain was very 
limited. Reproductive organs contained higher concentrations of isoflavones than 
heart, muscle, or thymus. Distribution of isoflavones in ewe tissues is unequal 
and may reflect specific impact in some target tissues.

Proanthocyanidins, flavonoids exhibiting cardiovascular protection, constitute a 
major fraction of the flavonoid ingested in the human diet. Although they are 
poorly absorbed, they are metabolized by the intestinal microbiota into various 
phenolic acids. An analytical method, based on an optimized 96-well plate 
solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure and liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS) for the analysis of 19 phenolic microbial 
metabolites and monomeric and dimeric flavanols in urine samples, was developed 
and validated. Human urine samples were obtained before and after ingestion of 
an acute consumption of 40 g of soluble cocoa powder and rat urines before and 
after the prolonged administration (2 weeks) of different diets composed of 
natural cocoa powder. The mean recovery of analytes using the new SPE-LC-MS/MS 
method ranged from 87% to 109%. Accuracy ranged from 87.5% to 113.8%, and 
precision met acceptance criteria (<15% relative standard deviation). 
Procyanidin B2 has been detected and quantified for the first time in human and 
rat urine after cocoa consumption. Changes in human and rat urinary levels of 
microbial phenolic acids and flavanols were in the range of 0.001-59.43 nmol/mg 
creatinine and of 0.004-181.56 nmol/mg creatinine, respectively. Major 
advantages of the method developed include reduction of laboratory work in the 
sample preparation step by the use of 96-well SPE plates and the sensitive 
measurement of a large number of metabolites in a very short run time, which 
makes it ideal for use in epidemiological studies.

Nut skins are considered to be a rich source of polyphenols and may be partially 
responsible for the numerous health effects associated with nut consumption. 
However, more bioavailability studies of nut skin polyphenols are needed to 
understand the health effects derived from nut consumption. The aim of the 
present study was to determine the profiles of both phase II and 
microbial-derived phenolic metabolites in plasma and urine samples before and 
after the intake of almond skin polyphenols by healthy human subjects (n = 2). 
Glucuronide, O-methyl glucuronide, sulfate, and O-methyl sulfate derivatives of 
(epi)catechin, as well as the glucuronide conjugates of naringenin and 
glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of isorhamnetin, were detected in plasma and 
urine samples after consumption of almond skin polyphenols. The main 
microbial-derived metabolites of flavanols, such as 
5-(dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 
5-(hydroxymethoxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, were also detected in their 
glucuronide and sulfate forms. In addition, numerous metabolites derived from 
further microbial degradation of hydroxyphenylvalerolactones, including 
hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, hydroxycinnamic, hydroxybenzoic, 
and hydroxyhippuric acids, registered major changes in urine after the 
consumption of almond skin polyphenols. The urinary excretion of these microbial 
metabolites was estimated to account for a larger proportion of the total 
polyphenol ingested than phase II metabolites of (epi)catechin, indicating the 
important role of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism of highly polymerized 
almond skin polyphenols. To the authors' knowledge this study constitutes the 
most complete report of the absorption of almond skin polyphenols in humans.

The biological properties of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) polyphenols are strictly 
dependent on their bioavailability. A long-term cocoa feeding trial was 
performed with subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Subjects (n=42) 
received two sachets of 20 g of cocoa powder/day with 250 mL of skimmed milk 
each, or only 500 mL/day of skimmed milk, both for two 4-week periods. The 
phenolic metabolic profile including phase II conjugated metabolites and 
phenolic acids derived from the intestinal microbiota was determined by LC-MS/MS 
in both 24-h urine and fasting plasma. The analysis of 24-h urine revealed 
significant increases of phase II metabolites, including glucuronides and 
sulfate conjugates of (-)-epicatechin, O-methyl-epicatechin, 
5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 
5-(3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, after regular cocoa intake. 
In the case of plasma, only glucuronide conjugates of 
dihydroxyphenylvalerolactones increased. Regular consumption of cocoa also 
resulted in a significant increase in the urinary excretion of colonic 
microbial-derived phenolic metabolites, including vanillic, 
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acids, and particularly 
5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, whereas only the two latter 
metabolites showed a significant increase in fasting plasma. The results found 
herein indicate that 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 
hydroxyphenylacetic acids could be good biomarkers of the regular consumption of 
cocoa and therefore, of flavanol-rich foods.

Health effects of cocoa flavonols depend on their bioavailability, which is 
strongly influenced by the food matrix and the degree of flavanol 
polymerization. The effect of milk on the bioavailability of cocoa flavanoids 
considering phase II metabolites of epicatechin has been the subject of 
considerable debate. This work studies the effect of milk at the colonic 
microbial metabolism level of the nonabsorbed flavanol fraction that reaches the 
colon and is metabolized by the colonic microbiota into various phenolic acids. 
Twenty-one human volunteers followed a diet low in polyphenols for at least 48 h 
before taking, in a random order, 40 g of cocoa powder dissolved either in 250 
mL of whole milk or in 250 mL of water. Urine samples were collected before the 
intake and during three different periods (0-6, 6-12, and 12-24 h). Phenolic 
acids were analyzed by LC-MS/MS after solid-phase extraction. Of the 15 
metabolites assessed, the excretion of 9 phenolic acids was affected by the 
intake of milk. The urinary concentration of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, 
protocatechuic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, 4-hydroxyhippuric, hippuric, caffeic, and 
ferulic acids diminished after the intake of cocoa with milk, whereas urinary 
concentrations of vanillic and phenylacetic acids increased. In conclusion, milk 
partially affects the formation of microbial phenolic acids derived from the 
colonic degradation of procyanidins and other compounds present in cocoa powder.

A reversed-phase HPLC procedure is proposed for the determination of seven 
flavonoids (luteolin, nepetin, hispidulin, jaceosidin, cirsimaritin, 
cirsilineol, and eupatorin) in vervain samples. A simple extractive technique 
was developed, involving only extraction with ethyl ether, which allowed the 
elimination of phenolic acids, yielding a sufficiently purified flavonoid 
fraction. All of the analyzed vervain samples showed a common flavonoid pattern, 
in which hispidulin and jaceosidin were the major compounds and nepetin was the 
minor compound.

Total aliphatic and indole glucosinolates, phenolic compounds (flavonoids and 
hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives), and vitamin C contents were evaluated in freshly 
harvested broccoli (Brassica oleracea L., var. italica, cv. Marathon) 
inflorescences. These were film-wrapped and stored for 7 days at 1 degrees C to 
simulate a maximum period of commercial transport and distribution. After cold 
storage, inflorescences were kept for 3 days at 15 degrees C to simulate a 
retail sale period. For wrapping, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) of 11 microm 
thickness was used. Gas composition was about 17% O(2) and 2% CO(2) during cold 
storage and about 16% O(2) and 3-4% CO(2) during shelf life within packages. The 
predominant glucosinolates were 4-methylsulfinylbutyl-glucosinolate 
(glucoraphanin), 3-indolylmethyl-glucosinolate (glucobrassicin), and 
1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl-glucosinolate (neoglucobrassicin). The predominant 
hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives were identified as 1,2,2'-trisinapoylgentiobiose, 
1,2-diferuloylgentiobiose, 1,2'-disinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose, and 
3-O-caffeoyl-quinic (neochlorogenic acid). Results showed major losses at the 
end of both periods, in comparison with broccoli at harvest. Thus, the 
respective losses, at the end of cold storage and retail periods, were 71-80% of 
total glucosinolates, 62-59% of total flavonoids, 51-44% of sinapic acid 
derivatives, and 73-74% caffeoyl-quinic acid derivatives. Slight differences in 
all compound concentrations between storage and retail sale periods were 
detected. Distribution and retail periods had minimal effects on vitamin C. 
Weight loss was monitored at the end of both periods.

Orange juice is a very rich source of dietary flavanones. The effect of 
flavanone concentration and solubility of orange beverages on their 
bioavailability has been studied in a crossover study with 10 healthy 
volunteers. Five different beverages with different flavanone concentrations 
were evaluated. Commercial orange juices (29.2-70.3 mg of flavanones/100 mL) 
were compared with experimental orange beverages in which the flavanone 
concentration was enhanced (110.2 mg/100 mL). Hesperetin and naringenin 
glucuronides and sulfates were detected and quantified in plasma and urine. The 
study shows that the solubility of the flavanones, and particularly that of 
hesperidin, in the juice is a key factor for the bioavailability as flavanone 
excretion and the C(max) in plasma correlate well with the soluble flavanone 
concentration in the juice, whereas it has no correlation with the total 
flavanone intake. In addition, a large interindividual variation was observed, 
this being consistent for each individual after the intake of the different 
beverages, suggesting that flavanone bioavailability is also dependent on the 
occurrence of specific microbiota that is able to remove the rutinosides from 
the juice glycosides, which results in aglycones that are then absorbed from the 
gut.

The effect of storage on the total polyphenol content and individual phenolic 
compounds as well as on the hydrophilic antioxidant capacity of ketchups and 
tomato juices was studied. The total polyphenol content was determined using the 
Folin-Ciocalteu assay, and the antioxidant capacity of the hydrophilic fraction 
was determined using DPPH and ABTS(+) assays. Individual polyphenols were 
identified and quantified using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization 
tandem mass spectrometry on a triple quadrupole. All analyses were carried out 
for ketchups and tomato juices after storage for 3, 6, and 9 months. The total 
polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity of the hydrophilic fraction 
decreased during storage of ketchups and tomato juices. Ketchups, in general, 
showed a slightly greater stability during storage than tomato juices. The most 
significant decrease was observed for quercetin followed by caffeic and ferulic 
acids, whereas glycosilated polyphenols showed greater stability during storage.

Tomatoes and tomato-based products are rich in antioxidants such as carotenoids, 
vitamin C and polyphenols. The industrial processing of diced tomatoes involves 
heat treatments in which these antioxidant compounds may be potentially 
affected. In this study, we evaluate the effect of each separate step in the 
dice-making process. Three technological processes were investigated: Hot, Cold 
and Cold treated with calcium salt (CaCl2). Four stages were monitored in each 
process: (1) fresh tomatoes; (2) peeled tomatoes; (3) diced tomatoes; and (4) 
final product after sauce addition. The main tool for minimising or 
counteracting the eventual processing damage was the strategy of 
'reconstitution', achieved by adding a sauce rich in seeds and peels with high 
levels of antioxidants and phenolics to the diced tomatoes. Different analyses 
were carried out in order to evaluate the effect of each processing step. First, 
total polyphenols (TP) were evaluated using Folin-Ciocalteau (F-C) assay and 
antioxidant activity using ABTS(+) and DPPH assays. Flavonols, flavanones, 
hydroxycinnamic and phenolic acids were then quantified using liquid 
chromatography/electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry 
(HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). The combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that each processing step induces 
alterations in the antioxidant and phenolic profile, and in particular sauce 
addition and calcium treatment significantly affected the levels of antioxidants 
and phenolics during the dice-making process.

Information on phyto-oestrogen intake in various populations has been scanty 
until now, primarily because data on the content of these compounds in foods 
were lacking. We report here on expansion of the Finnish National Food 
Composition Database (Fineli) with values for the plant lignans matairesinol and 
secoisolariciresinol and the isoflavones daidzein and genistein. The values, 
expressed as aglycones, were based on food analyses (mainly GC-MS) or imputed 
from analytical data for 180 foods for lignans and 160 foods for isoflavones; 
additionally, over 1000 values were derived from the recipe database of Fineli. 
Average intake of these phyto-oestrogens was calculated using food consumption 
data of the National Dietary Survey FINDIET 1997, which was carried out in a 
random sample of the adult population in five areas in Finland. The dietary data 
were collected by 24 h recall =2862). The mean lignan intake was 434 (standard 
deviation (SD) 1575) microg/d and the mean isoflavone intake was 788 (SD 673) 
microg/d. Women had a higher lignan density (microg lignans/MJ) in their diet 
than men (P<0.05). Men had a higher mean daily isoflavone intake, 902 (SD 368) 
microg, than women, 668 (SD 963) microg (P<0.05). The sources of lignans were 
many: seeds, cereals, fruit, berries and vegetables. The main sources of 
isoflavones appeared to be processed meat products/sausages containing soya as 
an ingredient, and legumes as such. The average intake of lignans and 
isoflavones in Finland seems to be low, but intake varies throughout the 
population.

Consumers' increasing interest in the relationship between diet and health is a 
sign for food producers to pay more attention to potential health-protecting 
compounds in new product development and food processing. From a production 
chain perspective the choice of the raw material that is used is important for 
the health-protecting potential of the end product. Four apple cultivars 
(Jonagold, Golden Delicious, Cox's Orange, and Elstar), which can be used as 
fresh apples or in processed apple products, were compared with regard to 
flavonol, catechins, phloridzin, and chlorogenic acid concentrations and 
antioxidant activity. Jonagold apples possessed the highest flavonoid 
concentration and the highest antioxidant activity. To study seasonal 
differences, apples from three different harvest years were analyzed, but in 
three cultivars no effect on flavonoid concentration and antioxidant activity 
was observed. Long-term storage, both at refrigerator temperature and under 
controlled atmosphere conditions, was found not to influence flavonoid 
concentration or antioxidant activity.

Chestnut (Castanea sativa) is an important basic food in rural diets and a major 
starch crop used in a similar way to potatoes. Chestnuts are a fundamental 
economic resource in the ""chestnut regions"" not only for the fruit but also for 
the chestnut wood. Chestnuts have become increasingly important with respect to 
human health, for example, as an alternative gluten-free flour source. Chestnuts 
are also a rich source of other beneficial compounds, but there have been few 
studies on the composition during processing. In this study, we analyzed the 
chemical composition of three Portuguese cultivars at different stages of 
industrial processing. The chestnut cultivars were Longal, Judia, and Martaínha. 
All three cultivars had high moisture contents but were low in ash, crude fat, 
and crude protein contents, with high starch and low fiber contents. The free 
amino acid contents, including various essential amino acids, varied depending 
on the cultivar. All three cultivars also had a significant content of 
polyphenolics with gallic acid; ellagic acid was predominant among hydrolyzable 
and condensed tannins. Many of these compounds are known to exert significant 
positive effects on human health. The one-way analysis of variance for fresh 
chestnut shows significant differences among the three cultivars for most of the 
studied parameters. The same statistical analysis applied to each one of the two 
cultivars (Judia and Longal) sampled for the four processing steps analyzed 
indicates a significant effect of this factor in practically all of the 
constituents. On the other hand, the two-way analysis of variance shows that, 
besides the residual, the processing step and the interaction cultivar x 
processing step were the factors that more contributed for the total variation 
observed in the constituents analyzed, while the contribution of cultivar was 
much less significant.

Commercially important edible nut seeds were analyzed for chemical composition 
and moisture sorption. Moisture (1.47-9.51%), protein (7.50-21.56%), lipid 
(42.88-66.71%), ash (1.16-3.28%), total soluble sugars (0.55-3.96%), tannins 
(0.01-0.88%), and phytate (0.15-0.35%) contents varied considerably. Regardless 
of the seed type, lipids were mainly composed of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty 
acids (>75% of the total lipids). Fatty acid composition analysis indicated that 
oleic acid (C18:1) was the main constituent of monounsaturated lipids in all 
seed samples. With the exception of macadamia, linoleic acid (C18:2) was the 
major polyunsaturated fatty acid. In the case of walnuts, in addition to 
linoleic acid (59.79%) linolenic acid (C18:3) also significantly contributed 
toward the total polyunsaturated lipids. Amino acid composition analyses 
indicated lysine (Brazil nut, cashew nut, hazelnut, pine nut, and walnut), 
sulfur amino acids methionine and cysteine (almond), tryptophan (macadamia, 
pecan), and threonine (peanut) to be the first limiting amino acid as compared 
to human (2-5 year old) amino acid requirements. The amino acid composition of 
the seeds was characterized by the dominance of hydrophobic (range = 
37.16-44.54%) and acidic (27.95-33.17%) amino acids followed by basic 
(16.16-21.17%) and hydrophilic (8.48-11.74%) amino acids. Trypsin inhibitory 
activity, hemagglutinating activity, and proteolytic activity were not detected 
in the nut seed samples analyzed. Sorption isotherms (Aw range = 0.08-0.97) 
indicated a narrow range for monolayer water content (11-29 mg/g of dry matter). 
No visible mold growth was evident on any of the samples stored at Aw < 0.53 and 
25 degrees C for 6 months.

Biofortification of staple crops is a promising, sustainable strategy to combat 
micronutrient deficiencies including iron (Fe). This study evaluated the impact 
of boiling (BLF) and fermentation (FLF) on Fe and other minerals content in 
Fe-biofortified lentil flours and analytical approaches for Fe and phytic acid 
quantification. Both treatments significantly reduced tannin, saponin, oxalate, 
and phytic acid contents. FLF presented higher content of most minerals 
including Fe (66.5 mg/kg) than BLF (61.6 mg/kg). A weak correlation (r = 0.43) 
was found between phosphovanadomolybdate and total phosphorus assay kit methods, 
whereas ICP-OES showed strong correlation (r = 0.95) with the 
hexathiocyanatoferrate technique for phytic acid and Fe contents determination, 
respectively. PCA explained 92.6 % of variation in the mineral content across 
flours. SEM-EDS provided insights into processing-induced microstructural 
alterations and confirmed ICP-OES elemental composition. Overall, processing 
appears to be an effective strategy to reduce antinutritional factors and 
increase the content of some minerals.

Olive oil phenolic compounds are potent antioxidants in vitro, but evidence for 
antioxidant action in vivo is controversial. We examined the role of the 
phenolic compounds from olive oil on postprandial oxidative stress and LDL 
antioxidant content. Oral fat loads of 40 mL of similar olive oils, but with 
high (366 mg/kg), moderate (164 mg/kg), and low (2.7 mg/kg) phenolic content, 
were administered to 12 healthy male volunteers in a cross-over study design 
after a washout period in which a strict antioxidant diet was followed. Tyrosol 
and hydroxytyrosol, phenolic compounds of olive oil, were dose-dependently 
absorbed (p<0.001). Total phenolic compounds in LDL increased at postprandial 
state in a direct relationship with the phenolic compounds content of the olive 
oil ingested (p<0.05). Plasma concentrations of tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, and 
3-O-methyl-hydroxytyrosol directly correlated with changes in the total phenolic 
compounds content of the LDL after the high phenolic compounds content olive oil 
ingestion. A 40 mL dose of olive oil promoted a postprandial oxidative stress, 
the degree of LDL oxidation being lower as the phenolic content of the olive oil 
administered increases. In conclusion, olive oil phenolic content seems to 
modulate the LDL phenolic content and the postprandial oxidative stress promoted 
by 40 mL olive oil ingestion in humans.

Hydroxytyrosol is the most potent phenolic antioxidant of olive oil and olive 
mill waste water (OMWW) and its biological activities have stimulated research 
on its potential role in cardiovascular protection. However, evidence of the 
absorption of OMWW phenolics and on their possible in vivo activity has, until 
now, never been provided. Three groups male Sprague-Dawley rats were 
administered 1, 5, or 10 mg/Kg of the OMWW extract, respectively, providing 
41.4, 207, and 414 microg/Kg of hydroxytyrosol, respectively. Urine was 
collected for 24 h and the urinary levels of hydroxytyrosol were quantified by 
mass spectrometry. Hydroxytyrosol was dose-dependently (R(2) = 0.95) absorbed 
and excreted in the urines mostly as a glucuronide conjugate. Further, the 
administration of an hydroxytyrosol-rich OMWW extract (10 mg/kg) to the rats was 
also associated with an increase of their plasma antioxidant capacity. Future 
experiments will eventually further clarify its metabolic fate and its in vivo 
actions.

Interest in the in vivo biological activities of olive oil phenolics is rapidly 
growing, and different models and vehicles of administration are used worldwide. 
Matters of practicality determine the use of rats rather than humans as the 
model of choice. Also, growing interest in nutraceuticals is leading to the 
formulation of compounds containing olive oil phenols. In this study, we 
compared metabolism and urinary excretion of hydroxytyrosol [(HT), the most 
representative phenol of olive oil] between rats and humans by evaluating 
excretion of HT and its major metabolite, homovanillyl alcohol. Also, we 
compared human excretion of HT when consumed as a natural component of extra 
virgin olive oil, when added to refined olive oil, or when added to yogurt (as 
an approximation of functional food). Urinary excretion of HT was greater in 
humans than in rats, a species with a high basal excretion of HT and its 
metabolites. The high (234% of HT administered) excretion of free HT suggests 
that hydrolysis of oleuropein administered in humans (still an unresolved issue) 
occurs in vivo. Moreover, human HT excretion was much higher after its 
administration as a natural component of olive oil (44.2% of HT administered) 
than after its addition to refined olive oil (23% of HT administered) or yogurt 
(5.8% of dose or approximately 13% of that recorded after virgin olive oil 
intake). These data suggest that the rat is not the appropriate model for the 
study of HT metabolism and that HT-containing functional foods should be 
carefully formulated.

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and red wine (RW) are two basic elements that form 
part of the so-called Mediterranean diet. Both stand out because of their high 
phenolic compound content and their potential related health benefits. The 
present study is focused on the metabolic disposition of resveratrol (RESV), 
tyrosol (TYR), and hydroxytyrosol (HT) following the consumption of EVOO, RW, 
and a combination of both. In this study, 12 healthy volunteers consumed a 
single dose of 25 mL of EVOO, 150 mL of RW, and a combination of both in a 
crossover randomized clinical trial. Urinary recovery of RESV, TYR, and HT was 
analysed in urine samples collected over a 6-h period following the intake of 
each treatment. Higher HT levels were observed following EVOO compared to RW 
(3788 ± 1751 nmols and 2308 ± 847 nmols respectively). After the combination of 
EVOO and RW, the recovery of TYR and HT metabolites increased statistically 
compared to their separate consumption (4925 ± 1751 nmols of TYR and 6286 ± 3198 
nmols of HT). EVOO triggered an increase in glucuronide conjugates, while RW 
intake raised sulfate metabolites. Marginal effects were observed in RESV 
increased bioavailability after the combination of RW with the fat matrix 
provided by EVOO.

Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and 
development of atherosclerosis. Stilbenes have been shown to protect 
lipoproteins from oxidative damage and to have cancer chemopreventive activity. 
We describe a method for the direct determination of stilbenes in several red 
wines using high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. In a 
survey of 12 commercial wines from the south of Brazil (Rio Grande del Sul), 
levels of delta-viniferin are reported for the first time in different varieties 
of red wines. Brazilian red wine contains trans-astringin, trans-piceid, 
trans-resveratrol, cis-resveratrol (in high quantity: 5 times more than the 
trans form), epsilon-viniferin, and a compound isolated for the first time in 
wine, trans-delta-viniferin. Isolation and identification of delta-viniferin was 
achieved by NMR after extraction and fractionation of red wine phenolics. 
delta-Viniferin contributes, as well as cis-resveratrol and trans-piceid, to a 
significant proportion of stilbenes in wine dietary intake, particularly with 
Merlot varieties containing an average level of 10 mg/L for delta-viniferin, 15 
mg/L for cis-resveratrol, and 13 mg/L for trans-piceid. The total stilbene 
intake from wine origin was estimated for the Brazilian population as 5.3 mg/day 
per person (on the basis of a regular wine consumption of 160 mL/day). 
delta-Viniferin can contribute to around 20% of total stilbenes in wine (average 
of 6.4 mg/L in red Brazilian wines). It would be important in the future to 
investigate the origins of the differences in wine stilbene levels in relation 
to the vine varieties, and the bioavailability of the newly extracted stilbene 
delta-viniferin in plasma after consumption of different types of wines.

Apples are a rich source of polyphenols in the human diet. However, the 
distribution of polyphenols in different apple varieties and tissues is still 
largely unclear. In this study, a new liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) strategy was developed to reveal the spatial 
distribution of polyphenols in different apple tissues and varieties. A method 
based on multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-enhanced product ion (EPI) was 
established in the information-dependent acquisition (IDA) mode for 
pseudo-target screening of major apple polyphenols. A total of 39 apple 
polyphenolic metabolites were finally identified. Qualitative and quantitative 
results showed that the variety and content of polyphenols in apple peels were 
higher than those of other tissues. In apple roots, stems, and leaves, the 
highest polyphenol variety and content were found in wild species, followed by 
cultivars and elite varieties. Dihydrochalcone substances, one kind of major 
apple polyphenols, were more abundant in apple roots, stems, and leaves. This 
strategy can be applied as a model for other agricultural products, in addition 
to revealing the distribution of polyphenols in different tissues of apples, 
which provides a theoretical basis for the utilization of polyphenol resources 
and variety selection.

The amounts of myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol were analyzed in 16 red and 
2 white berry and grape wines after acid hydrolysis using an RP-HPLC method with 
diode array detection. The red berry wines analyzed were made mainly from black 
currant, crowberry, and bog whortleberry, i.e., berries rich in flavonols. The 
red grape wines were made mainly from Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot grapes in 
several countries. The white wines studied were gooseberry and white currant 
wines and Chardonnay and Riesling wines. The amount of myricetin ranged from 3.8 
to 22.6 mg L(-1) in red berry wines and from 0 to 14.6 mg L(-1) in red grape 
wines. The amount of quercetin was from 2.2 to 24.3 mg L(-1) red berry wines and 
from <1.2 to 19.4 mg L(-1) in red grape wines. Low levels of kaempferol were 
found in all red berry wines and in 9 red grape wines. The total concentration 
of these flavonols was from 6 to 46 mg L(-1) (mean 20 mg L(-1)) in red berry 
wines and from 4 to 31 mg L(-1) (mean 15 mg L(-1)) in red grape wines. Small 
amounts of quercetin were found in white currant and gooseberry wines, whereas 
no flavonols were detected in white grape wines. These results demonstrate that

Brassica vegetables are widely consumed mostly after processing and cooking. 
These processing and cooking methods not only can affect the taste, texture, 
flavor and nutrients of these vegetables, but also influence the levels of some 
important bioactive compounds, such as glucosinolates (GLSs). Glucoraphanin 
(GLR) is the most abundant GLSs and its hydrolyzed component, sulforaphane 
(SLR), is the most powerful anti-cancer compound in brassica vegetables. In this 
review, we find out that varied treatments impact the retention of GLR and the 
formation of SLR differently. Be specific, 1) freezing can avoid the losses of 
GLR while short-time microwaving, short-time steaming and fermentation promote 
the biotransformation from GLR to SLR; 2) Boiling and blanching cause the 
largest losses of GLR and SLR, while freezing significantly protect their 
losses.; 3) Stir-frying varies the levels of GLR and SLR in different cooking 
conditions.

Five types of caneberries [evergreen blackberries (Rubus laciniatus), 
marionberries (Rubus ursinus), boysenberries (Rubus ursinus x idaeus), red 
raspberries (Rubus idaeus), and black raspberries (Rubus occidentalis)] were 
analyzed for antioxidant activity by measuring their oxygen radical absorbance 
capacity (ORAC). In addition, the berries were analyzed for total phenolics, 
anthocyanins, procyanidins, and ellagic acid content. All of the berries had 
high ORAC activity ranging from 24 to 77.2 micromol of Trolox equiv/g of fresh 
berries. Anthocyanin content ranged from 0.65 to 5.89 mg/g, and phenolics ranged 
from 4.95 to 9.8 mg/g. Black raspberries had the highest ORAC and anthocyanin 
and phenolic contents. Only red raspberries had detectable amounts of 
procyanidin oligomers (monomer, dimers, and trimers). All berries had high 
levels of ellagic acid (47-90 mg/g), but boysenberries had the highest level 
prior to hydrolysis. The results from this study indicate that these caneberries 
were high in antioxidant activity and were rich sources of anthocyanins and 
phenolics.

Resveratrol provides multiple physiologic benefits which promote healthspan in 
various model species and clinical trials support continued exploration of 
resveratrol treatment in humans. However, there remains concern regarding low 
bioavailability and wide inter-individual differences in absorption and 
metabolism in humans, which suggests a great need to develop novel methods for 
resveratrol delivery. We hypothesized that oral transmucosal delivery, using a 
lozenge composed of a resveratrol-excipient matrix, would allow resveratrol to 
be absorbed rapidly into the bloodstream. We pursued proof of concept through 
two experiments. In the first experiment, the solubility of trans-resveratrol 
(tRES) in water and 2.0 M solutions of dextrose, fructose, ribose, sucrose, and 
xylitol was determined using HPLC. Independent t-tests with a Bonferroni 
correction were used to compare the solubility of tRES in each of the solutions 
to that in water. tRES was significantly more soluble in the ribose solution 
(p = 0.0013) than in the other four solutions. Given the enhanced solubility of 
tRES in a ribose solution, a resveratrol-ribose matrix was developed into a 
lozenge suitable for human consumption. Lozenges were prepared, each containing 
146±5.5 mg tRES per 2000 mg of lozenge mass. Two healthy human participants 
consumed one of the prepared lozenges following an overnight fast. Venipuncture 
was performed immediately before and 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes following 
lozenge administration. Maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) for tRES alone 
(i.e., resveratrol metabolites not included) were 325 and 332 ng⋅mL(-1) for the 
two participants at 15 minute post-administration for both individuals. These 
results suggest a resveratrol-ribose matrix lozenge can achieve greater Cmax and 
enter the bloodstream faster than previously reported dosage forms for 
gastrointestinal absorption. While this study is limited by small sample size 
and only one method of resveratrol delivery, it does provide proof of concept to 
support further exploration of novel delivery methods for resveratrol 
administration.

Dietary factors affecting polyphenol bioavailability.

While many epidemiological studies have associated the consumption of 
polyphenols within fruits and vegetables with a decreased risk of developing 
several chronic diseases, intervention studies have generally not confirmed 
these beneficial effects. The reasons for this discrepancy are not fully 
understood but include potential differences in dosing, interaction with the 
food matrix, and differences in polyphenol bioavailability. In addition to 
endogenous factors such as microbiota and digestive enzymes, the food matrix can 
also considerably affect bioaccessibility, uptake, and further metabolism of 
polyphenols. While dietary fiber (such as hemicellulose), divalent minerals, and 
viscous and protein-rich meals are likely to cause detrimental effects on 
polyphenol bioaccessibility, digestible carbohydrates, dietary lipids 
(especially for hydrophobic polyphenols, e.g., curcumin), and additional 
antioxidants may enhance polyphenol availability. Following epithelial uptake, 
polyphenols such as flavonoids may reduce phase II metabolism and excretion, 
enhancing polyphenol bioavailability. Furthermore, polyphenols may act 
synergistically due to their influence on efflux transporters such as 
p-glycoprotein. In order to understand polyphenol bioactivity, increased 
knowledge of the factors affecting polyphenol bioavailability, including dietary 
factors, is paramount.

Fruits and leaves from different cultivars of thornless blackberry (Rubus sp.), 
red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.), black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis L.), and 
strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa D.) plants were analyzed for total antioxidant 
capacity (oxygen radical absorbance capacity, ORAC) and total phenolic content. 
In addition, fruits were analyzed for total anthocyanin content. Blackberries 
and strawberries had the highest ORAC values during the green stages, whereas 
red raspberries had the highest ORAC activity at the ripe stage. Total 
anthocyanin content increased with maturity for all three species of fruits. 
Compared with fruits, leaves were found to have higher ORAC values. In fruits, 
ORAC values ranged from 7.8 to 33.7 micromol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g of 
fresh berries (35. 0-162.1 micromol of TE/g of dry matter), whereas in leaves, 
ORAC values ranged from 69.7 to 182.2 micromol of TE/g of fresh leaves 
(205.0-728.8 micromol of TE/g of dry matter). As the leaves become older, the 
ORAC values and total phenolic contents decreased. The results showed a linear 
correlation between total phenolic content and ORAC activity for fruits and 
leaves. For ripe berries, a linear relationship existed between ORAC values and 
anthocyanin content. Of the ripe fruits tested, on the basis of wet weight of 
fruit, cv. Jewel black raspberry and blackberries may be the richest source for 
antioxidants. On the basis of the dry weight of fruit, strawberries had the 
highest ORAC activity followed by black raspberries (cv. Jewel), blackberries, 
and red raspberries.

Tea is a popular beverage almost all over the world. Many studies show that tea 
consumption is closely associated with positive health impact. Most of the HPLC 
methods used for the determination of tea constituents include gradient elution 
systems which involve expensive instrumentation. The objective of this study was 
to develop a simple, rapid precise and low cost HPLC method for the separation 
and quantification of catechins and caffeine in tea (Camellia sinensis). The 
method utilizes a phenyl column (2.1 × 150 mm) with a UV-detector (280 nm) where 
excellent chromatographic separation of tea components i.e. gallic acid (GA), 
caffeine (Caf), epicatechin (EC) and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was 
achieved. The isocratic elution system of acetonitrile, glacial acetic acid and 
deionized water (8:1:91 v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min was involved. This 
method produced excellent accuracy and precision. Within run and between run 
precision was less than 7.5 %. The equations for calibration curves were 
y = 0.117 (±0.010)x + 0.173 (±0.024), y = 0.100 (±0.003)x + 0.045 (±0.019), 
y = 0.016 (±0.001)x + 0.006 (±0.004), y = 0.025 (±0.001)x-0.025 (±0.007) for GA, 
Caf, EC and EGCG respectively. The method validation parameters prove that the 
method is efficient, a simple and adequate for the quantitative determination of 
principal components in tea samples.

Water scarcity is an ecological issue affecting over 10% of Europe. It is 
intensified by rising temperatures, leading to greater evaporation and reduced 
precipitation. Agriculture has been confirmed as the sector accounting for the 
highest water consumption globally, and it faces significant challenges relating 
to drought, impacting crop yields and food security. Sustainable practices, 
precision irrigation, and the development of drought-resistant crops are 
essential for the mitigation of this threat. Effective, innovative solutions are 
crucial for optimizing water use for intensive crops such as cultivated 
strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa). This study emphasizes the importance of 
identifying the genotypes most resilient to low water availability. Experimental 
trials involving reduced irrigation levels were set up to identify genotypes 
with a greater capacity to increase fruit quality and maintain fruit yield. 
Reduced water conditions positively influenced strawberry fruit quality, 
exhibiting improved citric acid, soluble solids, and color brightness linked to 
decreased water use, while firmness remained stable. Notably, the total phenolic 
content was most affected by stress, indicating strong antioxidant responses. 
With these interesting variations in fruit quality came a different response in 
plant yield. Plants belonging to the Lauretta and AN15,07,53 cultivars 
maintained a 98% fruit yield when grown under WS1 conditions. While the yield 
for the Francesca cultivar increased by 10% under the stressed WS1 conditions in 
comparison to the control conditions, water stress in the WS2 treatment caused a 
strong reduction in yield in all three genotypes. Overall, the findings 
emphasize the importance of identifying for each new cultivar the most 
appropriate water regime in order to amplify the quality of the fruit, thus 
maintaining high production standards and saving water.

Cultural system [hill plasticulture (HC) versus matted row (MR)] and genotype 
interactions affected strawberry fruit quality. In general, fruit soluble solids 
content, total sugar, fructose, glucose, ascorbic acid, titratable acid, and 
citric acid contents were increased in the HC system. Fruit from HC also had 
higher flavonoid contents and antioxidant capacities. Strawberry fruit contains 
flavonols as well as other phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins and phenolic 
acids. Pelargonidin-based anthocyanins such as pelargonidin 3-glucoside, 
pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside-succinate were the 
predominant anthocyanins in strawberry fruit. The content of cyanidin-based 
anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, was much 
lower than that of pelargonidin-based anthocyanins in either system. Strawberry 
fruit from the HC system had significantly higher amounts of p-coumaroylglucose,

To identify the major metabolites of resveratrol in rat, rat urine samples were 
pretreated by using solid-phase extraction technique (SPE) with polyamide 
cartridges. And a LC-MS/MS method with electrospray ionisation (ESI), negative 
ion mode and collision induced dissociation (CID), was used to elucidate the 
structures of the major metabolites of resveratrol. According to the results of 
our experiment, we found that the main metabolites of resveratrol were 
resveratrol monoglucuronide (M1), dihydroresveratrol monosulfate (M2), 
resveratrol monosulfate (M3) and dihydroresveratrol (M4).

PURPOSE: Polygonum cuspidatum extract as a traditional Chinese medicine is 
extracted from the dried rhizome and root of Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb.et Zucc. 
Resveratrol is one of its active components. Studies were performed in rats to 
define the tissue distribution and excretion of resveratrol in urine and bile, 
and to characterize (if possible) any metabolites of resveratrol observed in 
tissues after ig 20mg/kg Polygonum cuspidatum extract.
METHOD: For tissue distribution studies, tissues (300 mg) were homogenized and 
centrifuged with methanol, and metabolites found in selected tissue extract were 
identified by LC/MS/MS. For urinary and biliary excretion experiments, urine and 
bile samples were cleaned up by using solid-phase extraction (SPE) with 
polyamide cartridges. All the concentrations of resveratrol in these biological 
samples were determined by HPLC with UV detection.
RESULT: After a single oral dose of 20mg/kg PCE in rats, resveratrol was mainly 
distributed in stomach, duodenum, liver and kidney with detectable metabolites 
resveratrol monoglucuronide and resveratrol monosulfate. The majority of the 
resveratrol was excreted as metabolites, only 0.59% and 0.027% of the dosage 
were excreted in urine and bile respectively as unchanged drug within 24h.

A sensitive ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method has 
been developed and validated for the quantification of taxifolin in rat plasma. 
Following liquid/liquid extraction by ethyl acetate, the analytes were separated 
on a Sunfire (2.1 mm x 50 mm, 3.5 microm) column and analyzed in the selected 
ion recording with a negative electrospray ionization mode. The method was 
linear over the concentration range of 6-6750 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-day 
precisions were all within 8% and accuracy ranged from 92.9% to 105.1%. The 
lower limit of quantification was 6 ng/mL. The present method was successfully 
applied to the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin 
following intravenous and oral administration to rats. The absolute 
bioavailability of taxifolin was 0.17% in rat.

To take advantage of the various pharmacologic activities of soy bean 
isoflavones, more detailed studies of the absorption and excretion rates of 
these compounds in humans and subsequent evaluation of their bioavailabilities 
are required. We conducted a pharmacokinetic study of soybean isoflavones in 
seven healthy male volunteers. After ingestion of 60 g of kinako (baked soybean 
powder, containing 103 micromol daidzein and 112 micromol genistein), changes of 
the isoflavone and metabolite concentrations in plasma, urine and feces were 
measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The plasma concentration of 
genistein increased after 2 h and reached its highest value of 2.44 +/- 0.65 
micromol/L 6 h later. The plasma concentration of daidzein peaked at 1.56 +/- 
0.34 micromol/L at the same time, but it was always lower than that of 
genistein. Peak plasma concentration of O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) and equol 
appeared after the daidzein peak in four and two subjects, respectively. In 
contrast with plasma, daidzein was the main component in urine. Urinary daidzein 
excretion started to increase shortly after the rise in its plasma concentration 
and reached 2.4 micromol/h 8 h after ingestion of kinako. Genistein excretion in 
urine paralleled that of daidzein, but the value at 6 h was about half (1.1 
micromol/h). The majority of ingested isoflavones after ingestion of kinako were 
recovered on d 2 or 3 in the feces. Total recovery of daidzein, O-DMA and equol 
from urine and feces was 54.7%, calculated from daidzein intake; 20.1% of 
administered genistein was recovered as genistein. The half-lives of plasma 
genistein and daidzein were 8.36 and 5.79 h, respectively. The individual plasma 
and urinary concentrations of equol and O-DMA were quite variable; subjects were 
classified as high and low metabolizers. The high plasma concentration of 
isoflavones for at least several hours after a single ingestion of soy protein 
suggests that these compounds may interact with macromolecules and have 
biological effects.

The antioxidant activity of roasted coffee residues was evaluated. Extraction 
with four solvents (water, methanol, ethanol, and n-hexane) showed that water 
extracts of roasted coffee residues (WERCR) produced higher yields and gave 
better protection for lipid peroxidation. WERCR showed a remarkable protective 
effect on oxidative damage of protein. In addition, WERCR showed scavenging of 
free radicals as well as the reducing ability and to bind ferrous ions, 
indicating that WERCR acts as both primary and secondary antioxidants. The HPLC 
analyses showed that phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid) and 
nonphenolic compounds [caffeine, trigonelline, nicotinic acid, and 
5-(hydroxymethyl)furfuraldehyde] remained in roasted coffee residues. These 
compounds showed a protective effect on a liposome model system. The 
concentrations of flavonoids and polyphenolic compounds in roasted coffee 
residues were 8,400 and 20,400 ppm, respectively. In addition, the Maillard 
reaction products (MRPs) remaining in roasted coffee residues were believed to 
show antioxidant activity. These data indicate that roasted coffee residues have 
excellent potential for use as a natural antioxidant source because the 
antioxidant compounds remained in roasted coffee residues.

The consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains rich in antioxidative 
phytochemicals is associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as 
cancer, coronary heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, cataract, and 
aged-related functional decline. For example, phenolic acids are among the main 
antioxidative phytochemicals in grains that have been shown to be beneficial to 
human health. Corn (Zea mays L.) is a major staple food in several parts of the 
world; thus, the antioxidant activity of several corn types was evaluated. The 
2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl free radical (DPPH*) scavenging activity, total 
phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant capacity of lipid-soluble substances (ACL), 
oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and phenolic acid compositions of 
typical and mutant genotypes (typical-1, waxy, typical-2, and high-amylose) were 
investigated. The DPPH* scavenging activity at 60 min was 34.39-44.51% in 
methanol extracts and 60.41-67.26% in HCl/methanol (1/99, v/v) extracts of corn. 
The DPPH* scavenging activity of alkaline hydrolysates of corn ranged from 48.63 
to 64.85%. The TPC ranged from 0.67 to 1.02 g and from 0.91 to 2.15 g of ferulic 
acid equiv/kg of corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. The 
TPC of alkaline hydrolysates ranged from 2.74 to 6.27 g of ferulic acid equiv/kg 
of corn. The ACL values were 0.41-0.80 and 0.84-1.59 g of Trolox equiv/kg of 
corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. The ORAC values were 
10.57-12.47 and 18.76-24.92 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn in methanol and 
HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. ORAC values of alkaline hydrolysates ranged 
from 42.85 to 68.31 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn. The composition of phenolic 
acids in alkaline hydrolysates of corn was p-hydroxybenzoic acid (5.08-10.6 
mg/kg), vanillic acid (3.25-14.71 mg/kg), caffeic acid (2.32-25.73 mg/kg), 
syringic acid (12.37-24.48 mg/kg), p-coumaric acid (97.87-211.03 mg/kg), ferulic 
acid (1552.48-2969.10 mg/kg), and o-coumaric acid (126.53-575.87 mg/kg). Levels 
of DPPH* scavenging activity, TPC, ACL, and ORAC in HCl/methanol extracts were 
obviously higher than those present in methanol extracts. There was no 
significant loss of antioxidant capacity when corn was dried at relatively high 
temperatures (65 and 93 degrees C) postharvest as compared to drying at ambient 
temperatures (27 degrees C). Alkaline hydrolysates showed very high TPC, ACL, 
and ORAC values when compared to methanol and HCl/methanol extracts. 
High-amylose corn had a better antioxidant capacity than did typical (nonmutant) 
corn genotypes.

Crude extracts of evening primrose meal were prepared in 56% (v/v) acetone and 
separated into six fractions (I-VI) using a Sephadex LH-20 column. Qualitative 
tests for phenolic and vanillin positive compounds produced positive results for 
all fractions. Silica gel thin-layer chromatography of fractions III and V 
allowed the location and isolation of two spots containing moderate to strong 
antioxidative compounds. High-performance liquid chromatography of the spot 
isolated from fraction III showed the resolution of two structurally related 
compounds, whereas that of the spot from fraction V showed the presence of one 
compound. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electron impact mass 
spectrometry produced sufficient evidence to identify the isolated compounds as 
(+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and gallic acid. These compounds accounted for 
about 10.5 and 1.7% of the dry mass of the crude extracts and meal, 
respectively.

The lipophilic character of quercetin suggests that it can cross enterocyte 
membranes via simple diffusion. Therefore, it should be more bioavailable than 
its glucosides, which require preliminary hydrolysis or active transport for 
absorption. However, the published human studies show that quercetin is less 
bioavailable than its glucosides. Assuming that low bioavailability of quercetin 
aglycone provided to humans as a pure substance is the result of its low 
solubility in the digestive tract, we studied its bioavailability from dietary 
sources in which quercetin was dispersed in the food matrix. In a randomized 
crossover study, 9 volunteers took a single dose of either shallot flesh (99.2% 
quercetin glucosides and 0.8% quercetin aglycone) or dry shallot skin (83.3% 
quercetin aglycone and 16.7% quercetin glucosides), providing 1.4 mg quercetin 
per kg of body weight. Blood samples were collected before and after consumption 
of shallot preparations. Plasma quercetin was measured on HPLC with 
electrochemical detection after plasma enzymatic treatment. The maximum plasma 
quercetin concentration of 1.02 +/- 0.13 micromol/L was reached at 2.33 +/- 0.50 
h after shallot flesh consumption compared with 3.95 +/- 0.62 micromol/L at 2.78 
+/- 0.15 h after dry skin consumption. The area under the concentration-time 
curve after dry skin consumption was 47.23 +/- 7.53 micromol x h(-1) x L(-1) and 
was significantly higher than that after shallot flesh intake (22.23 +/- 2.32 
micromol x h(-1) x L(-1)). When provided along with dietary sources, quercetin 
aglycone is more bioavailable than its glucosides in humans. Results point to 
the food matrix as a key factor.

BACKGROUND: Little information is currently available on the role of the gut 
microflora in modulating isoflavone bioavailability or on sex differences in 
isoflavone metabolism and bioavailability.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether chronic soy consumption influences 
isoflavone bioavailability as judged by plasma isoflavone concentrations and 
modified gut microflora activities [beta-glucoside hydrolysis and equol and 
O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) production]. We also examined whether sex 
differences in isoflavone metabolism exist.
DESIGN: A randomized, parallel, controlled study design was used to compare a 
high-soy diet (104 +/- 24 mg total isoflavones/d) with a low-soy diet (0.54 +/- 
0.58 mg total isoflavones/d) in 76 healthy young adults for 10 wk.
RESULTS: Concentrations of isoflavones and their gut microflora metabolites in 
the plasma, urine, and feces were significantly higher in the subjects who 
consumed the high-soy diet than in those who consumed the low-soy diet. 
Concentrations of O-DMA in plasma and urine were higher in the men than in the 
women. Fecal bacteria from subjects consuming both diets could convert daidzein 
to equol ex vivo. Fecal beta-glucosidase activity was significantly higher in 
the subjects who consumed the high-soy diet than in those who consumed the 
low-soy diet.
CONCLUSIONS: Although interindividual variation in isoflavone metabolism was 
high, intraindividual variation was low. Only concentrations of O-DMA in plasma 
and urine appeared to be influenced by sex. Chronic soy consumption does not 
appear to induce many significant changes to the gut metabolism of isoflavones 
other than higher beta-glucosidase activity.

Acrylamide (ACR), which is formed in foods during high-temperature cooking, 
triggers ferroptosis in the liver. Blueberry anthocyanins (BAs) are effective in 
protecting the liver against ACR-induced injury; however, this effect is also 
associated with metabolites generated in vivo. To determine their functional 
interaction with ACR defense, the dominating anthocyanin 
monomer-cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) and metabolites gallic acid (GA), 
4-hydroxybenzoic acid (HA), and vanillic acid (VA) according to our previous 
study were combined to explore their influence on ferroptosis in HepG2 cells. 
The results showed that C3G and its metabolites (GA, HA, and VA) synergistically 
inhibited ferroptosis by suppressing oxidative stress, via compounds and 
antioxidant enzymes related to the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway, iron, lipid reactive 
oxygen species, and targeted genes and proteins, such as Nrf2, GPX4, SLC7A11, 
ACSL4, and others. Overall, this study provides a novel perspective on the 
health benefits of BAs following their digestion and metabolism.

Anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins were characterized by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS coupled 
with a diode array and/or fluorescent detector in seven cultivars of Ribes 
nigrum (black currant) and Ribes rubrum (red currant, Red Lake), six cultivars 
of Ribes grossularia (gooseberries), Aronia melanocarpa(chokeberry), and 
Sambucus nigra (elderberry). Thirty-one different anthocyanins were detected in 
these berries, but not every anthocyanin was observed in each berry. A number of 
minor anthocyanins were identified from these berries for the first time. The 
concentrations of individual anthocyanins in all of the berries were quantified 
using relevant anthocyanidin 3-glucoside standards. Among the berries studied in 
this paper and in berries in general, chokeberry has the highest total 
anthocyanin concentrations [1480 mg/100 g of fresh weight (FW)], whereas the 
lowest total anthocyanin concentration in the berries studied was found in the 
gooseberry cv. Careless, which contained only 0.07 mg/100 g of FW. Two cultivars 
of gooseberries (Marigold and Leveller) did not contain any anthocyanins. Total 
proanthocyanidin concentrations in the berries studied ranged from 23 to 664 
mg/100 g of FW in elderberry and chokeberry, respectively. Procyanidin or 
prodelphinidin polymers were the predominant components (>65% w/w) in most of 
the berries. The lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities were measured 
by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC(FL)) procedure. The total 
antioxidant capacity varied from 21 micromol of TE/g of FW in Careless 
gooseberry to 161 micromol of TE/g of FW in chokeberry. Total phenolics in the 
berries in general paralleled hydrophilic antioxidant capacity.

Weaning pigs (7.9 +/- 1.7 kg) were fed a freeze-dried powder of marionberry (MB) 
by stomach tube to study the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins. Four 
major anthocyanins (ACNs) were found in MB: cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-glc, 
78%), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (Cy-3-rutin, 20%), pelargonidin-3-glucoside 
(Pg-3-glc, 0.4%), and 1 unknown acylated cyanidin-based ACN (UACy, 1.5%). In the 
urine, the 4 original ACNs and 11 metabolites were identified and quantified. 
The main metabolites were glucuronidated and/or methylated forms of the original 
anthocyanins. Total recovery of the 4 original ACNs plus their related 
metabolites was 0.087 +/- 0.034% for Cy-3-glc, 0.084 +/- 0.026% for Cy-3-rutin, 
0.583 +/- 0.229% for Pg-3-glc and 0.036 +/- 0.011% for UACy (mean +/- SD, n = 
3), respectively. For the individual ACNs, the amount of metabolites recovered 
from Cy-3-rutin was lower than that of the original intact Cy-3-rutin, whereas 
the amounts of metabolites from Cy-3-glc and Pg-3-glc in the urine were much 
higher than their original forms. In pig plasma, the 2 original ACNs, Cy-3-glc 
and Cy-3-rutin, and a trace of 1 metabolite (cyanidin monoglucuronide) were 
detected. The plasma concentration:dose ratio of Cy-3-rutin was higher than that 
of Cy-3-glc. Different aglycones and/or sugar moieties may influence the 
absorption and metabolism of ACNs. Cy-3-glc and Cy-3-rutin had similar apparent 
excretion rates relative to dose, whereas Pg-3-glc had a much higher total 
urinary excretion than cyanidin-based anthocyanins. Most of Cy-3-glc and 
Pg-3-glc were excreted in the form of metabolites, whereas most of the 
Cy-3-rutin was excreted in its original unmetabolized form. Urinary recovery of 
the acylated anthocyanin was lower than that of nonacylated anthocyanins.

Both lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities were determined using the 
oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC(FL)) assay with fluorescein as the 
fluorescent probe and 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride as a peroxyl 
radical generator on over 100 different kinds of foods, including fruits, 
vegetables, nuts, dried fruits, spices, cereals, infant, and other foods. Most 
of the foods were collected from four different regions and during two different 
seasons in U.S. markets. Total phenolics of each sample were also measured using 
the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. Hydrophilic ORAC(FL) values (H-ORAC(FL)) ranged 
from 0.87 to 2641 micromol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g among all of the foods, 
whereas lipophilic ORAC(FL) values (L-ORAC(FL)) ranged from 0.07 to 1611 
micromol of TE/g. Generally, L-ORAC(FL) values were <10% of the H-ORAC(FL) 
values except for a very few samples. Total antioxidant capacity was calculated 
by combining L-ORAC(FL) and H-ORAC(FL). Differences of ORAC(FL) values in fruits 
and vegetables from different seasons and regions were relatively large for some 
foods but could not be analyzed in detail because of the sampling scheme. Two 
different processing methods, cooking and peeling, were used on selected foods 
to evaluate the impact of processing on ORAC(FL). The data demonstrated that 
processing can have significant effects on ORAC(FL). Considering all of the 
foods analyzed, the relationship between TP and H-ORAC(FL) showed a very weak 
correlation. Total hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant capacity intakes were 
calculated to be 5558 and 166 micromol of TE/day, respectively, on the basis of 
data from the USDA Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994-1996).

To investigate the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins (ACNs) with 
different aglycones and sugar moieties, weanling pigs (11.4 +/- 3.8 kg) were 
fed, in a single meal, a freeze-dried powder of chokeberry, black currant, or 
elderberry at a single dose of 229, 140, or 228 mumol total ACN/kg body weight 
(BW), respectively. These berries provided ACNs with differences in aglycone as 
well as some unique differences in the sugar moieties. The relative proportions 
of the different metabolites depended upon concentrations, quantities consumed, 
and types of glycoside of ACNs in the berry. Delphinidin ACNs were not 
metabolized to any measurable extent. Cyanidin ACNs were metabolized via 
methylation and glucuronidation as well as by formation of both derivatives on 
the same ACN molecule. ACNs with either a di- or trisaccharide attached to them 
were excreted in the urine primarily as the intact form. Over 80% of the ACN 
compounds containing rutinose or sambubiose, which were excreted in the urine 
from black currant, elderberry, or Marion blackberry, were excreted as the 
intact molecule. The limited metabolism of these ACNs that did occur was via 
methylation. ACN monoglycosides other than the glucoside were metabolized via 
methylation and/or glucuronide formation. The monoglucuronide that formed 
represented a small proportion of the metabolites relative to the methylated or 
the mixed methylated and glucuronide forms of ACNs. The data clearly demonstrate 
that the aglycone and the sugar moieties can alter the apparent absorption and 
metabolism of ACNs.

Breviscapine, is the total flavonoid components (the content of scutellarin > or 
=85%) extracted from the dried whole plant of Erigeron breviscapus (VANT.) 
HAND.-MAZZ, and its preparations are generally used in the clinic for the 
treatment of cerebral and cardio-vascular diseases in China. In this paper, the 
metabolites of breviscapine in the urine of rats after oral administration were 
investigated. The ten metabolites were isolated by open-column chromatography 
and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography, and their structures 
were elucidated by MS, NMR spectroscopy including (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, and NOESY 
(nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy), enzymatic hydrolysis and chemical 
evidence. The ten metabolites were identified as 
scutellarein-6,7-di-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-1), scutellarein (M-2), 
6-O-methyl-scutellarin (M-3), 6-O-methyl-scutellarein (M-4), 
scutellarein-6-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-5), scutellarein-5-O-beta-D-glucuronide

apigenin-5-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-9), and apigenin-4'-O-beta-D-glucuronide 
(M-10) respectively. The results of this study indicated that the metabolites of 
brevisvapine were excreted in rats urine as glucuronidated, sulfated or 
methylated forms, as well as the aglycone of scutellarin-scutellarein after oral 
administration, and the metabolic pathways were also proposed.

Soy isoflavones are potentially beneficial phytoestrogens, but their 
tissue-selective effects in women are poorly understood. We tested the 
hypothesis that soy isoflavones affect bone mineral density (BMD), which may be 
influenced by individual differences in isoflavone metabolism and serum calcium 
levels. Ninety-nine healthy premenopausal women were randomized to isoflavones 
(136.6 mg aglycone equivalence) and 98 to placebo for 5 days per week for up to 
2 years. BMD, serum calcium, and urinary excretion of daidzein and genistein 
were measured before and during treatment. In 129 adherent subjects, we found 
that isoflavone exposure, determined by urinary excretion levels, but not by 
dose assignment, interacted with serum calcium in affecting whole body BMD, but 
not hip and spine BMD. The regression coefficient was -0.042 for genistein 
excretion (GE) and 0.091 for the interaction between GE and serum calcium (all 
P < .05). Daidzein excretion had similar but marginal effect. Genistein 
significantly decreased whole body BMD only at low normal serum calcium levels 
but increased whole body BMD at higher serum calcium levels. Comparing maximum 
to minimum GE, mean changes in whole body BMD were +0.033 and -0.113 g/cm2 at 
serum calcium levels of 10 and 8.15 mg/dL, respectively. These associations were 
not evident by intention-to-treat analysis, which could not model for 
inter-individual differences in isoflavone metabolism. In summary, soy 
isoflavones decrease whole body BMD only when serum calcium is low. Isoflavones 
are dietary substances that may influence calcium homeostasis by releasing 
calcium from bone while sparing the common fracture risk sites hip and spine.

Short-term soy and probiotic supplementation does not markedly affect 
concentrations of reproductive hormones in postmenopausal women with and without 
histories of breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Observational studies suggest that dietary isoflavones reduce breast 
cancer risk, and this may be caused in part by effects on endogenous hormone 
concentrations. Because intestinal bacteria metabolize isoflavones, it was 
hypothesized that consumption of probiotic bacteria would enhance the biologic 
effects of isoflavones, including effects on endogenous hormones.
DESIGN: Twenty (20) postmenopausal breast cancer survivors and 20 healthy 
postmenopausal women completed four 42-day diet periods in a randomized, 
crossover design. They received one of the following: isolated soy protein; 
isolated milk protein; soy + probiotic capsules; or milk + probiotic capsules. 
Each protein supplement provided 0.38 g protein/(kg body weight/day) (26.6 +/- 
4.5 g protein/day) and soy protein provided 0.64 mg isoflavones/(kg body 
weight/day) (44.4 +/- 7.5 mg isoflavones/day). Probiotic capsules provided 10(9) 
colony-forming units Lactobacillus acidophilus (strain DDS-1), Bifidobacterium 
longum, and 15-20 mg fructo-oligosaccharide.
MEASURES: Plasma samples were collected at baseline and after each diet for 
analysis of estrogens, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), androgens, and sex 
hormone?binding globulin (SHBG).
RESULTS: Hormone levels were not affected by soy, probiotic supplements, or 
equol producer status, and neither cancer status nor equol producer status 
altered the effects of soy or probiotics. Furthermore probiotics did not alter 
the effects of soy consumption. Soy protein tended to decrease SHBG compared to 
milk protein diets (p = 0.05), although both proteins significantly decreased 
SHBG relative to baseline (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that short-term, moderate consumption of 
isoflavone-containing soy protein and consumption of these particular probiotic 
capsules do not significantly alter reproductive hormone concentrations in 
breast cancer survivors or controls, regardless of equol producer status.

The effects of soaking, boiling and steaming processes on the total phenolic 
components and antioxidant activity in commonly consumed cool season food 
legumes (CSFL's), including green pea, yellow pea, chickpea and lentil were 
investigated. As compared to original unprocessed legumes, all processing steps 
caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH free 
radical scavenging activity (DPPH) in all tested CSFL's. All soaking and 
atmospheric boiling treatments caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in oxygen 
radical absorbing capacity (ORAC). However, pressure boiling and pressure 
steaming caused significant (p<0.05) increases in ORAC values. Steaming 
treatments resulted in a greater retention of TPC, DPPH, and ORAC values in all 
tested CSFL's as compared to boiling treatments. To obtain cooked legumes with 
similar palatability and firmness, pressure boiling shortened processing time as 
compared to atmospheric boiling, resulted in insignificant differences in TPC, 
DPPH for green and yellow pea. However, TPC and DPPH in cooked lentils differed 
significantly between atmospheric and pressure boiling. As compared to 
atmospheric processes, pressure processes significantly increased ORAC values in 
both boiled and steamed CSFL's. Greater TPC, DPPH and ORAC values were detected 
in boiling water than that in soaking and steaming water. Boiling also caused 
more solid loss than steaming. Steam processing exhibited several advantages in 
retaining the integrity of the legume appearance and texture of the cooked 
product, shortening process time, and greater retention of antioxidant 
components and activities.

The effects of soaking, boiling, and steaming processes on the phenolic 
components and antioxidant activity of black beans were investigated. All 
processed beans exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) lower antioxidant activities 
than raw beans in total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH free radical scavenging 
activity (DPPH), and oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC). Steaming 
processes resulted in a greater retention of TPC and ORAC values than the 
boiling processes. Pressure boiling shortened processing time compared to 
regular boiling, resulted in insignificant differences in TPC, but significantly 
increased in ORAC as compared to the regular boiling method. Pressure steaming 
resulted in significant decreases in TPC, DPPH, while significantly increased in 
ORAC compared to regular steaming. Greater TPC, DPPH, and ORAC values were 
detected in boiling water than in the soaking and steaming water. Mass balance 
analysis showed that boiling caused more dry solid loss than steaming. All of 
these results indicated that processing methods significantly changed contents 
and activities of antioxidant components of black beans. Steam processing 
exhibited several advantages in appearance and texture of the cooked product, 
shortening processing time, and in greater retention of TPC and antioxidant 
activities. Steam processing may be used to develop high-quality 
health-promoting black bean products.

Potatoes in the diet contribute significantly to antioxidant daily intake 
worldwide. The influence of different domestic cooking conditions, boiling, 
microwaving, and baking, on total phenolics (TP), antioxidant capacity, phenolic 
composition, and tryptophan content was studied using eight commercial potato 
varieties. The antioxidant capacity was detected by the methods of oxygen 
radical absorbance capacity assay (ORAC) and the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 
free radical (DPPH(*)) assay. The phenolic composition and tryptophan content 
were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a 
diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), whereas phenolics and tryptophan were 
identified by means of HPLC-mass spectrometry, HPLC-DAD, and authentic 
standards. Antioxidant capacity was influenced by potato variety and cooking 
conditions; however, cooked potatoes retained 68-97% ORAC value depending on 
cooking procedure and variety. Chlorogenic acid and its isomers dominated the 
phenolic composition of each variety involved in this study. ORAC and TP were 
highly and positively correlated (r = 0.9119). Norkotah ranked highest in 
chlorogenic acid content and antioxidant value. Principal component analysis 
showed different cooking processes did not influence the trend of the 
antioxidant profile of the eight potato varieties, but specific compounds exert 
influence on the antioxidant capacity. The results imply that the potato 
varieties rich in antioxidant components could be good antioxidant sources as 
activities are not greatly affected by different cooking conditions.

Epidemiological studies have indicated that the consumption of fruits and 
vegetables is associated with a reduced risk for the development of chronic 
diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Phytochemicals, including 
phenolics and flavonoids, are suggested to be the major bioactive compounds 
contributing to the health benefits of fruits and vegetables. Onions are a major 
source of dietary flavonoids; however, there may exist varietal differences in 
composition, concentration, and beneficial activities. To characterize these 
differences, shallots and 10 onion (Allium cepa L.) varieties commonly available 
in the United States (Western Yellow, Northern Red, New York Bold, Western 
White, Peruvian Sweet, Empire Sweet, Mexico, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley Sweet, 
and Vidalia) were evaluated for total phenolic and flavonoid contents and 
antioxidant and antiproliferative activities. Shallots contained the highest 
total phenolic content (114.7 +/- 10.0 mg/100 g of sample) among the varieties 
tested, with a 6-fold difference observed when compared to the variety with the 
lowest phenolic content (Vidalia, p < 0.05). Western Yellow onion variety 
exhibited the highest total flavonoid content (69.2 +/- 3.7 mg/100 g of onion) 
of the varieties tested, with an 11-fold difference when compared to the variety 
with the lowest flavonoid content (Western White, p < 0.05). Shallots exhibited 
the highest total antioxidant activity (45.5 +/- 2.1 micromol of vitamin C 
equiv/g of onion), followed by Western Yellow, New York Bold, Northern Red, 
Mexico, Empire Sweet, Western White, Peruvian Sweet, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley 
Sweet, and Vidalia. For all varieties, both total phenolic and flavonoid 
contents were strongly correlated with total antioxidant activity (R (2) = 
0.9668, p < 0.05; and R (2) = 0.7033, p < 0.05, respectively). The proliferation 
of HepG(2) and Caco-2 cells was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent 
fashion after exposure to the Western Yellow, shallots, New York Bold, and 
Northern Red extracts, with Western Yellow, shallots, and New York Bold 
exhibiting the highest antiproliferative activity against HepG(2) cells and New 
York Bold and Western Yellow exhibiting the highest antiproliferative activity 
against Caco-2 cells. However, the varieties of Western White, Peruvian Sweet, 
Empire Sweet, Mexico, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley Sweet, and Vidalia 
demonstrated weak antiproliferative activity against both HepG(2) and Caco-2 
cells. These results may influence consumers toward purchasing onion varieties 
exhibiting greater potential health benefits and may significantly affect future 
breeding efforts to enhance onion nutritional qualities.

To explore the metabolism of 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (1,5-DCQA) in rats, 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in parallel to diode-array detection was 
used for the rapid detection/characterization of the metabolites formed in bile, 
urine, and plasma of rats following oral administration of 1,5-DCQA (160 mg/kg). 
The methylation and glucuronidation of 1,5-DCQA occurring in vitro using rat 
liver and small intestinal microsomes and cytosols were studied in comparison 
with those occurring in vivo, and the enzymes involved were also determined. In 
addition, the anti-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) activity of three 
important metabolites was preliminarily evaluated in MT-4 cells infected with 
HIV-1. A total of 22 metabolites in vivo and in vitro were identified, including 
four isomeric O-mono-methylated metabolites (M8-M11), nine isomeric 
O-di-methylated metabolites (M3, M6, M22, and M12-M17), four isomeric 
O-mono-methyl-glucuronidated metabolites (M2 and M19-M21), four isomeric 
O-di-methyl-glucuronidated metabolites (M1, M4, M5, and M7), and one 
glucuronidated metabolite (M18). The O-methylation positions of three important 
metabolites (M8, M9, and M12) were determined (3''-, 3'-, and 3',3''-) by 
comparing with synthesized standards. The efficacy experiments showed that M8, 
M9, and M12 could inhibit HIV replication with IC(50) values of about 25, 25, 
and 46 microM, respectively. These results suggest that O-methylation and 
glucuronidation are two important metabolic pathways of 1,5-DCQA, that both rat 
liver and small intestine can catalyze such reactions by 
catechol-O-methyltransferase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and that the 
HIV-1 inhibitory activity of M8, M9, and M12 is comparable to or slightly weaker 
than that of 1,5-DCQA.

Naringenin chalcone is the main active component of tomato skin extract, which 
has an antiallergic activity. In this study, naringenin chalcone was orally 
administered to rats, and the chemical structures and levels of the major 
metabolites in the plasma and urine of rats were determined. HPLC analysis 
indicated the presence of three major metabolites in the urine. LC-MS and NMR 
analyses tentatively identified these as naringenin 
chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide, naringenin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide, and 
naringenin-4'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Naringenin chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide 
was the only metabolite detected in the plasma, and its peak plasma level was 
observed 1 h after naringenin chalcone administration. Naringenin 
chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide also inhibited histamine release from rat 
peritoneal mast cells stimulated with compound 48/80. This activity might 
contribute to the antiallergic activity of naringenin chalcone in vivo. To the 
best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to report determination 
of naringenin chalcone metabolites in rat plasma and urine.

Fruit and vegetable intake is inversely correlated with risks for several 
chronic diseases in humans. Phytochemicals, and in particular, phenolic 
compounds, present in plant foods may be partly responsible for these health 
benefits through a variety of mechanisms. Since environmental factors play a 
role in a plant's production of secondary metabolites, it was hypothesized that 
an organic agricultural production system would increase phenolic levels. 
Cultivars of leaf lettuce, collards, and pac choi were grown either on 
organically certified plots or on adjacent conventional plots. Nine prominent 
phenolic agents were quantified by HPLC, including phenolic acids (e. g. caffeic 
acid and gallic acid) and aglycone or glycoside flavonoids (e. g. apigenin, 
kaempferol, luteolin, and quercetin). Statistically, we did not find significant 
higher levels of phenolic agents in lettuce and collard samples grown 
organically. The total phenolic content of organic pac choi samples as measured 
by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, however, was significantly higher than 
conventional samples (p < 0.01), and seemed to be associated with a greater 
attack the plants in organic plots by flea beetles. These results indicated that 
although organic production method alone did not enhance biosynthesis of 
phytochemicals in lettuce and collards, the organic system provided an increased 
opportunity for insect attack, resulting in a higher level of total phenolic 
agents in pac choi.

Phenolic acids from 30 barley varieties (combination of 
hulled/hulless/two-row/six-row/regular/waxy) were investigated by HPLC following 
four different sample treatments: (a) simple hot water extraction, (b) 
extraction after acid hydrolysis, (c) acid plus alpha-amylase hydrolysis, and 
(d) acid plus alpha-amylase plus cellulase hydrolysis treatments. The benzoic 
acid (p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, and protocatechuic acids) and cinnamic acid 
derivatives (coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, and chlorogenic acids) were identified, 
and some of the phenolic acids were quantified after each above-mentioned 
treatment. The data indicated that a combination of sequential acid, 
alpha-amylase, and cellulase hydrolysis treatments might be applicable for 
release of more phenolic acids from barley.

Nutritionists recommend increasing the intake of soluble dietary fiber (SDF), 
which is very low in most cereal-based products. Conversion of insoluble DF 
(IDF) into SDF can be achieved by chemical treatments, but this affects the 
sensorial properties of the products. In this study, the possibility of getting 
a substantial increase of SDF from cereal products using a tailored preparation 
of Trichoderma enzymes is reported. Enzymes were produced cultivating 
Trichoderma using durum wheat fiber (DWF) and barley spent grain (BSG) as unique 
carbon sources. Many Trichoderma strains were screened, and the hydrolysis 
conditions able to increase by enzymatic treatment the amount of SDF in DWF and 
BSG were determined. Results demonstrate in both products that it is possible to 
triple the amount of SDF without a marked decrease of total DF. The enzymatic 
treatment also causes the release of hydroxycinnamic acids, mainly ferulic acid, 
that are linked to the polysaccharides chains. This increases the free phenolic 
concentration, the water-soluble antioxidant activity, and, in turn, the phenol 
compounds bioavailability.

PURPOSE: Resveratrol, a phenolic phytoalexin occurring in grapes, wine, peanuts, 
and cranberries, has been reported to have anticarcinogenic, antioxidative, 
phytoestrogenic, and cardioprotective activities. Because little is known about 
the metabolism of this potentially important compound, the in vitro and in vivo 
metabolism of trans-resveratrol were investigated.
METHODS: The in vitro experiments included incubation with human liver 
microsomes, human hepatocytes, and rat hepatocytes and the in vivo studies 
included oral or intraperitoneal administration of resveratrol to rats and mice. 
Methanol extracts of rat urine, mouse serum, human hepatocytes, rat hepatocytes, 
and human liver microsomes were analyzed for resveratrol metabolites using 
reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with on-line 
ultraviolet-photodiode array detection and mass spectrometric detection 
(LC-DAD-MS and LC-UV-MS-MS). UV-photodiode array analysis facilitated the 
identification of cis- and trans-isomers of resveratrol and its metabolites. 
Negative ion electrospray mass spectrometric analysis provided molecular weight 
confirmation of resveratrol metabolites and tandem mass spectrometry allowed 
structural information to be obtained.
RESULTS: No resveratrol metabolites were detected in the microsomal incubations, 
and no phase I metabolites, such as oxidations, reductions, or hydrolyzes, were 
observed in any samples. However, abundant trans-resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide and 
trans-resveratrol-3-sulfate were identified in rat urine, mouse serum, and 
incubations with rat and human hepatocytes. Incubation with beta-glucuronidase 
and sulfatase to release free resveratrol was used to confirm the structures of 
these conjugates. Only trace amounts of cis-resveratrol were detected, 
indicating that isomerization was not an important factor in the metabolism and 
elimination of resveratrol.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that trans-resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide and 
trans-resveratrol-3-sulfate are the most abundant metabolites of resveratrol. 
Virtually no unconjugated resveratrol was detected in urine or serum samples, 
which might have implications regarding the significance of in vitro studies 
that used only unconjugated resveratrol.

The composition of phenolic acids in several small berries grown in Northeastern 
Poland, namely, low-bush blueberries, black mulberries, European juneberries, 
black currants, fruits of blue-berried honeysuckle, and blackberries, was 
determined by gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS). The total 
content of phenolic acids, identified by GC-MS, ranged from 2845.8 +/- 141.0 
(black mulberries) to 5418.2 +/- 228.0 (blue-berried honeysuckle). Twenty 
phenolic acids were identified in the berries. Of these, hydroxycaffeic, m- and 
p-coumaric, and 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acids were the major phenolic acids in 
blackberries and blueberries, m-coumaric acid was the major phenolic acid in 
blue-berried honeysuckle and black currant fruits, while salicylic, caffeic, and 
m- and p-coumaric acids were the predominant phenolic acids in European 
juneberries. Syringic and veratric acids were detected only in blueberries, 
while p-hydroxybenzoic and sinapic acids were present only in black currants and 
o-coumaric acid was present in blueberries and black mulberries. The phenolic 
acids liberated from esters and glycosidic bonds were the major fractions of 
phenolic acids in the berries.

From red raspberries, ellagic acid, its 4-arabinoside, its 4' (4' '-acetyl) 
arabinoside, and its 4' (4' '-acetyl)xyloside, as well as quercetin and 
kaempferol 3-glucosides, were identified. In addition, two unidentified ellagic 
acid derivatives were detected. The free radical scavenging activity of the 
ellagic acid derivatives was evaluated by using the DPPH method and compared to 
that of Trolox. All of the isolated compounds showed antioxidant activity. The 
effect of processing to obtain jams on raspberry phenolics was evaluated. The 
flavonol content decreased slightly with processing and more markedly during 
storage of the jams. The ellagic acid derivatives, with the exception of ellagic 
acid itself, remained quite stable with processing and during 6 months of jam 
storage. The content of free ellagic acid increased 3-fold during the storage 
period. The initial content (10 mg/kg of fresh weight of raspberries) increased 
2-fold with processing, and it continued increasing up to 35 mg/kg after 1 month 
of storage of the jam. Then a slight decrease was observed until 6 months of 
storage had elapsed. The increase observed in ellagic acid could be explained by 
a release of ellagic acid from ellagitannins with the thermal treatment.

Polyphenol content, free radical scavenging capacity, and changes during storage 
over 7 months in the dark were studied in ecological and conventional red and 
white wines. In red wines, the most changeable components during storage were 
the anthocyanins since during storage anthocyanins content decreased 88% in 
conventional wine and 91% in ecological wine. Initially, the total flavonol 
contents of the conventional and ecological red wines were 163.88 +/- 2.69 and 
153.58 +/- 1.71 mg/L, respectively, and no significant variations occurred 
during storage. No differences in hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives content 
between conventional and ecological red and white wines were observed. The 
flavonol level in white wines was very low, as expected since these compounds 
are found in grape skin. The initial antioxidant activity was 5.37 +/- 0.14 and 
5.82 +/- 0.31 mM equivalents Trolox for conventional and ecological red wines, 
respectively; no significant differences were observed (p = 0.2831), and these 
values were 7-8 times higher than the antioxidant activity observed in 
conventional and ecological white wine. In contrast with other studies, the 
total concentrations of phenolic compounds in conventional and ecological red 
and white wines were not related to antioxidant activity (p > 0.05). In red 
wines, no significant differences were observed in the antioxidant activity of 
ecological and conventional red wine (p = 0.28), while in white wine significant 
differences were observed in the antioxidant activity between conventional and 
ecological white wine (p = 0.006).

BACKGROUND: Nutritional biomarkers may be better measures of dietary exposure 
than self-reported dietary data. We evaluated resveratrol metabolites, potential 
biomarkers of wine consumption, in humans after moderate consumption of 
sparkling, white, or red wines.
METHODS: We performed 2 randomized, crossover trials and a cohort study. In the 
first study, 10 healthy men consumed 30 g of ethanol/day as sparkling wine or 
gin for 28 days. In the second trial, 10 healthy women consumed 20 g of 
ethanol/day as white or red wine for 28 days. We also evaluated 52 participants 
in a study on the effects of a Mediterranean diet on primary prevention of 
cardiovascular disease (the PREDIMED Study). We used liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to analyze urinary total resveratrol 
metabolites (TRMs) and predictive values and ROC curve analyses to assess the 
diagnostic accuracy.
RESULTS: We observed significant increases in TRMs [72.4 (95% confidence 
interval, 48.5-96.2; P = 0.005), 211.5 (166.6-256.3; P = 0.005), and 560.5 
nmol/g creatinine (244.9-876.1; P = 0.005)] after consumption of sparkling, 
white, or red wine, respectively, but no changes after the washout or gin 
periods. In the cohort study, the reported daily dose of wine consumption 
correlated directly with TRMs (r = 0.654; P < 0.001). Using a cutoff of 90 
nmol/g, we were able to use TRMs to differentiate wine consumers from abstainers 
with a sensitivity of 72% (60%-84%); and a specificity of 94% (87%-100%).
CONCLUSIONS: Resveratrol metabolites in urine may be useful biomarkers of wine 
intake in epidemiologic and intervention studies.

The study was aimed at verification of the following hypothesis: differences in 
antioxidant capacity of diets consisting of different cereals and byproducts 
affect the antioxidant status of the consumers of these diets. To validate that 
hypothesis this study investigated the contents of polyphenols and 
alpha-tocopherol as well as the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in vitro of 
cereals and their fractions (barley, husked and naked oat, oat bran, and 
triticale); the nutritional and antioxidant properties of diets containing these 
cereals, applied in a 4-week feeding experiment on rats, were also assessed. 
Among the cereals examined, the highest TAC was reported for barley (13.16 
micromol of Trolox/g) and the lowest for naked oat (3.84 micromol of Trolox/g). 
Compared with cereals, the TAC of buckwheat waste was 2-3 times higher (25.2 
micromol of Trolox/g). The antioxidant capacity of diets, calculated in vitro, 
ranged from 6.35 micromol of Trolox/g for naked oat type diet to 10.51 micromol 
of Trolox/g for barley type diet. Results of an in vitro study were confirmed in 
changes of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and the level of 
thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in the serum of rats fed diets 
with the highest and lowest antioxidant capacities in vitro; the barley diet 
increased the activity of GPx (37.63 units/mL) and decreased the level of TBARS 
(4.82 microg/g), whereas the naked oat diet had an opposite effect (31.16 
units/mL and 5.91 microg/g, respectively).

The main flavonoids in grapefruit juice, naringin and narirutin, were quantified 
by LC-MS with structural differentiation by LC-MS/MS. After human consumption of 
grapefruit juice, urine samples were collected for 24 hours and screened for 
flavonoid metabolites by LC-MS. The metabolite structures (glucuronides, 
sulfates, and glucuronide sulfates) were then confirmed via their unique 
fragmentation patterns by LC-MS/MS. To further verify the identity of the common 
aglycon (naringenin) shared by the metabolites, enzymatic hydrolysis was 
performed and the resulting products were analyzed. This work demonstrates that 
LC-MS and LC-MS/MS techniques can be used for fast metabolite screening without 
extensive sample preparation.

Fuzi is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. Clinical Fuzi poisoning 
cases have frequently been reported. Glycyrrhizae Radix is often used to 
alleviate Fuzi's toxicity. However, the poisoning mechanism of Fuzi and the 
detoxication mechanism of Glycyrrhizae Radix are still not clear. We identified 
the chemical components of Fuzi at different decoction times (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 
6 h) using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight 
mass spectrometry. A total of 35 compounds were detected in the Fuzi decoction, 
including diester alkaloids, monoester alkaloids, amino acids, phenolic acids, 
organic acids, glycosides, and sugars among others. The content of diester 
alkaloids (i.e., subaconitine, neoaconitine, and aconitine) in the Fuzi 
decoction decreased after 2 h of decoction time, while the content of monoester 
alkaloids (i.e., benzoyl aconitine and benzoyl subaconitine) reached a peak at 
2 h. A total of 32 rats were randomly divided into four groups, including 8 
cases in the low-dosage Fuzi decoction group A, 8 cases in the high-dosage Fuzi 
decoction group B, 8 cases in the Fuzi and glycyrrhizae decoction group C, and 8 
cases in the control group D. The decoction was administered orally for 7 days. 
Then, a serum was obtained. The metabolites' changes were analyzed in serum 
metabolomics using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). 
Statistical analysis and pathway analysis were used to assess the effects of 
glycyrrhizae on the metabolic changes induced by Fuzi. The behavioral and 
biochemical characteristics indicated that Fuzi exhibited toxic effects on rats 
and their metabolic profiles changed. However, the metabolic profiles of the 
glycyrrhizae group became similar to those of the control group. These profiles 
showed that glycyrrhizae can effectively improve Fuzi poisoning rats. Our study 
demonstrated that the established pseudotargeted metabolomics is a powerful 
approach for investigating the mechanisms of herbal toxicity.

This is a report about the identification of key metabolites of tectorigenin in 
rat urine using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization 
ion trap tandem mass spectrometric method (HPLC-ESI-MS(n)). Six healthy rats 
were administered a single dose (80 mg/kg) of tectorigenin by oral gavage. Urine 
was sampled for 0-24 h and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the 
supernatants, then the supernatants were purified by solid-phase extraction with 
a C(18) cartridge. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a 
reversed-phase C(18) column with a gradient elution program whereas 
acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid water was used as mobile phase. Mass spectra were 
acquired in negative ionization mode and a data-dependant scan was used for the 
identification of the key metabolites of tectorigenin in the urine samples. As a 
result, four phase II metabolites and the parent drug tectorigenin were found 
and identified in rat urine for the first time.

Phenolic acids (PAs) have been shown to be beneficial to human health and are 
found most abundantly in corn bran ( approximately 4%, w/w), one of the main 
dietary fibers. This study therefore evaluated the bioavailabilities of phenolic 
antioxidants ferulic acid (FA) and p-coumaric acid (PCA) in refined corn bran 
(RCB) by determining their recovery in the plasma, urine, and feces of rats fed 
a single meal of a RCB diet containing 5% RCB or adapted to the RCB diet for 10 
days. In both studies, 0.4-0.5% of ingested FA and 1.2-2.3% of ingested PCA were 
recovered in rat urine. By contrast, approximately 81% of FA and approximately 
64% of PCA ingested with the single meal were excreted through the rat feces 
within 3 days after the ingestion. On the other hand, after rats were fed the 
RCB diet, total FA (all forms of FA) was recovered in plasma at a concentration 
of 35.0 +/- 2.0 microg/L, total FA and total PCA were excreted through urine at 
levels of 155.4 +/- 5.8 and 50.9 +/- 6.6 microg/day, respectively. These 
parameters showed no significant change (P = 0.93, 0.09, and 0.66, respectively) 
after rats were fed the RCB diet continuously for up to 10 days. These results 
suggest that the PAs in RCB are bioavailable in rats. Their bioavailabilities, 
however, are relatively low compared with their high content in RCB and not 
improved by the adaptation for 10 days to the enriched RCB diet. Additionally, 
comparison with the results of other studies revealed that high contents of FA 
and, especially, diferulic acids in cereal bran, which act as cross-links 
between bran cell wall polysaccharides, may not improve but, rather, limit the 
bioavailabilities of PAs in vivo.

Plant lignans occur in many foods, with flaxseed presently recognized as the 
richest source. Some plant lignans can be converted by intestinal microbiota to 
the mammalian lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, which may have protective 
effects against hormone-related diseases such as breast cancer. This study 
determined whether plant lignans in sesame seed, particularly sesamin, could be 
metabolized to the mammalian lignans. The total plant lignan concentration in 
sesame seed (2180 micromol/100 g) was higher than that in flaxseed (820 
micromol/100 g). In vitro fermentation with human fecal inoculum showed 
conversion of sesamin to the mammalian lignans, although at a lower rate (1.1%) 
compared with that of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (57.2%). However, when 
fed to female Sprague-Dawley rats for 10 d, sesamin (15 mg/kg body weight) and a 
10% sesame seed diet resulted in greater (P < 0.05) urinary mammalian lignan 
excretion (3.2 and 11.2 micromol/d, respectively), than the control (< 0.05 
micromol/d). We conclude that sesame seed is a rich source of mammalian lignan 
precursors and sesamin is one of them. From intermediate metabolites of sesamin 
identified in rat urine by GC-MS, a tentative metabolic pathway of sesamin to 
mammalian lignans is suggested.

The objective of the study was to analyze the effect of total content of 
minerals in waters on the effectiveness of extraction of polyphenols and 
flavonoids and on the antioxidant properties of brews from leaves of green and 
black tea, leaves of peppermint, chamomile inflorescences, leaves of sage, and 
flowers of lavender. The process of brewing was conducted at an initial 
temperature of 95 °C, under cover, for 15 min, with the use of 10 waters 
differing in terms of mineral components. The content of total polyphenols and 
total flavonoids was determined in the brews obtained. The antioxidant 
properties were assayed with the use of stable DPPH radicals and Ferric Reducing 
Antioxidant Power (FRAP) reagent. A significant effect of water mineralization 
on the extraction of phenolic compounds and on the antioxidant properties of the 
brews obtained was observed. In the majority of cases, the highest 
concentrations of polyphenols and flavonoids were obtained in brews prepared 
with the use of deionized water and waters with medium levels of mineralization. 
It was also demonstrated that there was a significant reduction of antioxidant 
properties in brews prepared with the water that had the highest level of 
mineralization (2896 ppm), at 70% and 93%, respectively, for green and black 
teas.

The antioxidant activity of phenolics in fruits of blueberry (Vaccinium 
corymbosum cv. Sierra), cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon cv. Ben Lear), wild 
chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa), and lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea cv. 
Amberland) was determined in this study. The phenolic constituents and contents 
among the different berries varied considerably. Anthocyanins were found to be 
the main components in all these berries. Chlorogenic acid in blueberry, 
quercetin glycosides in cranberry and lingonberry, and caffeic acid and its 
derivative in chokeberry were also present in relatively high concentrations. 
Chlorogenic acid, peonidin 3-galactoside, cyanidin 3-galactoside, and cyanidin 
3-galactoside were the most important antioxidants in blueberry, cranberry, wild 
chokeberry, and lingonberry, respectively. The contribution of individual 
phenolics to the total antioxidant capacity was generally dependent on their 
structure and content in the berries. Phenolics such as quercetin and cyanidin, 
with 3',4'-dihydroxy substituents in the B ring and conjugation between the A 
and B rings, had highly effective radical scavenging structures in blueberries, 
cranberries, chokeberries, and lingonberries. Phenolic acids such as caffeic 
acid also showed high antioxidant activity, probably due to its dihydroxylation 
in the 3,4 positions as hydrogen donors.

The purpose of this study was to examine the antioxidant properties of water and 
80% methanolic extracts of cereal grains and their different morphological 
fractions. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. Almari and cv. Henika, barley 
(Hordeum vulgare L.) cv. Gregor and cv. Mobek, rye (Secale cereale L.) cv. 
Dańkowskie Zlote, oat (Avena sativa L.) cv. Slawko and buckwheat (Fagopyrum 
esculentum Moench) cv. Kora were used. PC (L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine) liposome 
system and spectrophotometric assay of total antioxidant activity (TAA) were 
used to evaluate the antioxidative activity of extracts. Among the water 
extracts, only the one prepared from buckwheat exhibited antioxidant activity at 
the concentration analyzed. The following hierarchy of antioxidant activity was 
provided for 80% methanolic extracts originated from whole grain: buckwheat > 
barley > oat > wheat congruent with rye. The antioxidant activity was observed 
in extract prepared from separated parts of buckwheat and barley. In respect to 
hulls, the antioxidant hierarchy was as follows: buckwheat > oat > barley. The 
correlation coefficient between total phenolic compounds and total antioxidative 
activity of the extracts was -0.35 for water extracts and 0.96, 0.99, 0.80, and 
0.99 for 80% methanolic extracts originated from whole grains, hulls, pericarb 
with testa fractions and endosperm with embryo fractions, respectively.

The seeds of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench L.) were dehulled and then, 
following milling, extruded on a counter rotating, twin-screw extruder with the 
different barrel temperature profiles: 120, 160, and 200 degrees C. After 
extrusion cooking process, the following compounds were analyzed: free and 
conjugated phenolic acids, total polyphenols (TPC), tocopherols (T) and 
tocotrienols (T3), inositol phosphates (IP), reduced glutathione (GSH), and 
melatonin (MLT). The antioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase-like activity 
(SOD-like activity) were determined in the groats and extrudates. Extrusion 
caused a significant decrease in all the compounds tested, except for phenolic 
acids. The content of IP decreased by 13%, that of GSH by 42%, and that of T + 
T3 by 62%. A three-fold lower level of MLT and TPC was noted whereas the 
SOD-like activity disappeared when compared to the nonextruded material. A 
two-fold higher content of phenolic acids (free and released from ester bonds) 
was observed. In spite of the clear decrease in the investigated antioxidants, 
the extruded dehulled buckwheat seeds contained still significant content of 
bioactive compounds, which resulted in as little as an average 10% decrease of 
the antioxidant capacity.

A GC-MS method is reported for separation and characterization of widely 
different amounts of benzoic and phenolic acids as their trimethylsilyl 
derivatives simultaneously in cranberry. Fifteen benzoic and phenolic acids 
(benzoic, o-hydroxybenzoic, cinnamic, m-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxybenzoic, 
p-hydroxyphenyl acetic, phthalic, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic, vanillic, 
o-hydroxycinnamic, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic, p-coumaric, ferulic, caffeic, and 
sinapic acid) were identified in cranberry fruit in their free and bound forms 
on the basis of GC retention times and simultaneously recorded mass spectra. 
Except for benzoic, p-coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, and sinapic acids, 10 other 
phenolic acids identified have not been reported in cranberry before. The 
quantitation of the identified components was based on total ion current (TIC). 
The experimental results indicated cranberry fruit contains a high content of 
benzoic and phenolic acids (5.7 g/kg fresh weight) with benzoic acid being the 
most abundant (4.7 g/kg fresh weight). The next most abundant are p-coumaric 
(0.25 g/kg fresh weight) and sinapic (0.21 g/kg fresh weight) acid. Benzoic and 
phenolic acids occur mainly in bound forms and only about 10% occurs as free 
acid.
