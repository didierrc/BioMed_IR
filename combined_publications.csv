In this study the impact of achenes on polyphenolic compounds, ascorbic acids, 
and antioxidant activities in strawberry purees at production and after storage 
at 6 and 22 degrees C for 8 and 16 weeks was investigated. Strawberry purees 
were made from flesh, berry, and achene-enriched homogenate and contained 0, 
1.2, and 2.9% achenes, respectively. At production, strawberry purees made from 
flesh contained more anthocyanins, p-coumaroyl glycosides, and ascorbic acids, 
whereas increasing achene levels caused increasing levels of ellagic acid 
derivatives, proanthocyanidins, flavonols, total phenolics (TP), and antioxidant 
activities. In addition, the anthocyanins, TP, and ferric reducing ability power 
(FRAP) in purees with more achenes were better retained during storage. Ascorbic 
acids and anthocyanins declined rapidly during storage, whereas other 
polyphenols and antioxidant activities were more stable; that is, the 
contributions from anthocyanins and ascorbic acids to TP and antioxidant 
activities decreased. The findings that achenes contributed significantly to 
polyphenol content and stability of strawberry purees may be interesting in a 
nutritional and, thus, commercial, perspective.

Wheat grain is recognized as a good source of potentially health-enhancing 
components such as dietary fiber, phenolics, tocopherols, and carotenoids. 
Anthocyanins, another group of bioactive compounds, are found in blue and purple 
wheat grains. In the present study, a blue aleurone spring wheat line ""Purendo 
38"" with relatively high content of total anthocyanins was used to investigate 
the composition and stability of anthocyanins over three crop years. Commercial 
cultivars of purple (Konini) and red (Katepwa) wheats were included in the 
study. Separation of anthocyanins by high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) showed that each wheat had a distinct anthocyanin profile. Four major 
anthocyanins were separated from blue wheat extracts as compared to five 
anthocyanins in purple wheat. Cyanidin 3-glucoside was the predominant 
anthocyanin in purple wheat, whereas it was the second major anthocyanin in blue 
wheat. The predominant anthocyanin in blue wheat, making up approximately 41% of 
the total anthocyanin content, remains to be structurally unidentified. Blue 
wheat anthocyanins were thermally most stable at pH 1. Their degradation was 
slightly lower at pH 3 as compared to pH 5. Increasing the temperature from 65 
to 95 degrees C increased degradation of blue wheat anthocyanins. Addition of 
SO(2) during heating of blue wheat had a stabilizing effect on anthocyanin 
pigments. The optimal SO(2) concentrations were 500-1000 ppm for whole meals and 
1000-3000 ppm for isolated anthocyanins. Further studies are underway to 
identify and verify individual anthocyanins in blue wheat and their potential 
end uses.

Anthocyanin pigments from a wide variety of edible and ornamental black, blue, 
pink, purple, red, and white wheat, barley, corn, rice, and wild rice were 
identified and quantified to evaluate their potential as natural colorants or 
functional food ingredients. The total anthocyanin contents varied significantly 
and exhibited a range of 7-3276 microg/g. Some grains, such as red rice and 
black rice, contained a limited number of pigments, whereas others, such as 
blue, pink, purple, and red corns, had complex anthocyanin profiles. Of the 42 
anthocyanin compounds observed, 9 were characterized by comparison of the 
spectroscopic and chromatographic properties with those of authentic standards. 
The remaining compounds were tentatively identified on the basis of 
spectroscopic properties and electrospray ionization mass spectra. The most 
abundant anthocyanins were cyanidin 3-glucoside in black and red rices and in 
blue, purple, and red corns, pelargonidin 3-glucoside in pink corn, and 
delphinidin 3-glucoside in blue wheat.

Monomeric and oligomeric procyanidins present in cocoa liquors and chocolates 
were separated and quantified in four different laboratories using a 
normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with 
fluorescence detection. Procyanidin standards through decamers were obtained by 
extraction from cocoa beans, enrichment by Sephadex LH-20 gel permeation 
chromatography, and final purification by preparative normal-phase HPLC. The 
purity of each oligomeric fraction was assessed using HPLC coupled to mass 
spectrometry. A composite standard was then prepared, and calibration curves 
were generated for each oligomeric class using a quadratic fit of area sum 
versus concentration. Results obtained by each of the laboratories were in close 
agreement, which suggests this method is reliable and reproducible for 
quantification of procyanidins. Furthermore, the procyanidin content of the 
samples was correlated to the antioxidant capacity measured using the ORAC assay 
as an indicator for potential biological activity.

Epidemiologic studies revealed low mortality in hormone-dependent cancer in 
Japanese women and men consuming a traditional diet. We previously found that 
certain diphenolic food components, lignans and isoflavonoids, which are 
converted to biologically active hormone-like substances by intestinal 
microflora, may be cancer-protective agents. Therefore, we studied urinary 
excretion of these compounds (enterolactone, enterodiol, daidzein, equol, and 
O-desmethylangolensin) in 10 women and 9 men in a rural village south of Kyoto, 
Japan. The subjects consumed a typical low-fat diet with much rice and soy 
products, fish, and vegetables. An isotope-dilution gas chromatographic-mass 
spectrometric method was used for the assays. The urinary excretion of lignans 
was low but that of the isoflavonoids was very high. The excretion of 
isoflavonoids correlated with soybean-product intake. The low mortality in 
breast and prostate cancer of Japanese women and men, respectively, may be due 
to the high intake of soybean products.

Maize and sorghum represent economic, social, and nutritional significance 
worldwide. This work evaluated the physicochemical properties, carbohydrate, and 
lipids profile, as well as nutraceutical properties of sorghum and maize 
varieties used for obtaining popped grains. Proximate composition, carbohydrate 
profiles, fatty acids, and phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity were 
evaluated. Sorghum and maize shared traits, but white sorghum had higher amylose 
(27%) while Palomero maize 2 had the lowest (18%). Sucrose accounted for 87% of 
the low molecular weight carbohydrates (LMWC), followed by raffinose (up to 10%) 
and fructose (up to 7%). As for monomeric carbohydrates, maize contained more 
xylose and arabinose, while sorghum had a higher glucose content. The fatty acid 
profile was similar among varieties, but maize show high contents of total, 
unsaturated, and saturated fatty acids. Conversely, red sorghum exhibited 
significantly higher levels of palmitoleic and cis-vaccenic acids compared to 
the other varieties. Red sorghum showed the highest content of phenolic 
compounds, including free and bound phenols, condensed and hydrolyzed tannins, 
flavonoids (bound), and antioxidant capacity (ABTS and DPPH). While Palomero 
maize 2 exhibited a higher proportion of free flavonoids. These findings provide 
valuable information for selecting and using these varieties in different 
agricultural and industrial sectors.

USA.

The health-promoting effects of whole-grain consumption have been attributed in 
part to their unique phytochemical contents and profiles that complement those 
found in fruits and vegetables. Wheat is an important component of the human 
diet; however, little is known about the phytochemical profiles and total 
antioxidant activities of milled fractions of different wheat varieties. The 
objectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of phytochemicals 
(total phenolics, flavonoids, ferulic acid, and carotenoids) and to determine 
hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity in milled fractions (endosperm 
and bran/germ) of three different wheat varieties, two of which were grown in 
two environments. Grain samples of each of the wheat varieties were milled into 
endosperm and bran/germ fractions. Each fraction was extracted and analyzed for 
total phenolics, ferulic acid, flavonoids, carotenoid contents, and hydrophilic 
and lipophilic antioxidant activities. Total phenolic content of bran/germ 
fractions (2867-3120 micromol of gallic acid equiv/100 g) was 15-18-fold higher 
(p < 0.01) than that of respective endosperm fractions. Ferulic acid content 
ranged from 1005 to 1130 micromol/100 g in bran/germ fractions and from 15 to 21 
micromol/100 g in the endosperm fractions. The bran/germ fraction flavonoid 
content was 740-940 micromol of catechin equiv/100 g. On average, bran/germ 
fractions of wheat had 4-fold more lutein, 12-fold more zeaxanthin, and 2-fold 
more beta-cryptoxanthin than the endosperm fractions. Hydrophilic antioxidant 
activity of bran/germ samples (7.1-16.4 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g) was 
13-27-fold higher than that of the respective endosperm samples. Similarly, 
lipophilic antioxidant activity was 28-89-fold higher in the bran/germ fractions 
(1785-4669 nmol of vitamin E equiv/g). Hydrophilic antioxidant activity 
contribution to the total antioxidant activity (hydrophilic + lipophilic) was 
>80%. In whole-wheat flour, the bran/germ fraction contributed 83% of the total 
phenolic content, 79% of the total flavonoid content, 51% of the total lutein, 
78% of the total zeaxanthin, 42% of the total beta-cryptoxanthin, 85% of the 
total hydrophilic antioxidant activity, and 94% of the total lipophilic 
antioxidant activity. Our results showed that different milled fractions of 
wheat have different profiles of both hydrophilic and lipophilic phytochemicals. 
These findings provide information necessary for evaluating contributions to 
good health and disease prevention from whole-wheat consumption.

This study presents the effects of soaking, cooking, and industrial dehydration 
treatments on phenolic profile and also on antioxidant properties in Pardina 
lentil. HPLC-PAC and HPLC-MS (ESI) analysis identified a total of 35 phenolic 
compounds in raw and processed lentil flours, corresponding to catechins and 
procyanidins (69% of the total of identified phenolic compounds), flavonols 
(17%), flavones, and flavanones (5%), and hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic 
compounds (5 and 4%, respectively). During the industrial process, catechins and 
procyanidins, flavonols, flavones, and flavanones decreased, while 
hydroxybenzoic compounds exhibited an important increase. In addition, raw 
lentils showed high values of the antioxidant activity (66.97 μmol Trolox/g); 
although the thermal processing promotes decreased, the levels of antioxidant 
activity were still relevant. Thus, the significant occurrence of bioactive 
phenolic compounds along with the interesting antioxidant capacity of dehydrated 
lentil flours make them useful for daily inclusion in the human diet as 
ready-to-use for special meals to specific populations.

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a lipid food, which constitutes a pillar of the 
Mediterranean diet. A high number of scientific data have demonstrated that it 
exerts a variety of beneficial effects on human health due to its peculiar 
chemical composition including fatty acids (98-99%) and other active compounds 
even if found in a very low percentage (1-2%). Among them, minor polar compounds 
(MCPs), represented mainly by phenolic compounds, are relevant for their healthy 
properties, as stated by the European Food Safety Authority's (EFSA) claims. In 
this paper, we described the results obtained from a pilot in vivo study, 
focused for the first time on the evaluation of the possible beneficial effects 
of two EVOOs on chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients after the consumption of 
40 mL per day for 9 weeks. The selected EVOOs, traced in the production chain, 
and characterized by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC-DAD-MS) 
analysis, resulted rich in MCPs and satisfied the EFSA's claim for their content 
of hydroxytyrosol and derivatives. The results obtained by this in vivo study 
appear to highlight the potential beneficial role in CKD patients of these EVOOs 
and are promising for future studies.

Muscat, Oman.

Fresh and sun-dried dates of three native varieties from Oman, namely, Fard, 
Khasab, and Khalas, were examined for their antioxidant activity and total 
contents of anthocyanins, carotenoids, and phenolics, as well as free and bound 
phenolic acids. All results are expressed as mean value +/- standard deviation 
(n = 3) on a fresh weight basis. Fresh date varieties were found to be a good 
source of antioxidants (11687-20604 micromol of Trolox equiv/g), total contents 
of anthocyanins (0.24-1.52 mg of cyanidin 3-glucoside equiv/100 g), carotenoids 
(1.31-3.03 mg/100 g), phenolics (134-280 mg of ferulic acid equiv/100 g), free 
phenolic acids (2.61-12.27 mg/100 g), and bound phenolic acids (6.84-30.25 
mg/100 g). A significant (p < 0.05) amount of antioxidants and carotenoids was 
lost after sun-drying of dates, whereas the total content of phenolics and free 
and bound phenolic acids increased significantly (p < 0.05). Anthocyanins were 
detected only in fresh dates. Date varieties had different levels and patterns 
of phenolic acids. Four free phenolic acids (protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, 
syringic acid, and ferulic acid) and nine bound phenolic acids (gallic acid, 
protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, 
syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and o-coumaric acid) were 
tentatively identified. Of the date varieties studied, Khalas, which is 
considered to be premium quality, had higher antioxidant activity, total 
carotenoids, and bound phenolic acids than other varieties. These results 
suggest that all date varieties serve as a good source of natural antioxidants 
and could potentially be considered as a functional food or functional food 
ingredient, although some of their antioxidant constituents are lost during 
sun-drying.

Four different colored carrots, orange, purple with orange core, yellow, and 
white, were examined for their content of phenolics, antioxidant vitamins, and 
sugars as well as their volatiles and sensory responses. A total of 35 volatiles 
were identified in all carrots, 27 positively. White carrot contained the 
highest content of volatiles, followed by orange, purple, and yellow. In total, 
11, 16, 10, and 9 phenolic compounds were determined for the first time in 
orange, purple, yellow, and white carrots, respectively. Of these, chlorogenic 
acid was the most predominant phenolic compound in all carrot varieties. 
Differences (p < 0.05) in relative sweetness, the contents of vitamin C and 
alpha- and beta-carotenes, and certain flavor characteristics were observed 
among the colored carrot varieties examined. Purple carrots contained 2.2 and 
2.3 times more alpha- and beta-carotenes (trace in yellow; not detected in 
white) than orange carrots, respectively. Purple carrot may be used in place of 
other carrot varieties to take advantage of its nutraceutical components.

The effect of roasting on taste-active components of 18 native hazelnut 
varieties, grown in the Giresun province of Turkey, was assessed. Samples were 
examined for their sugars, organic acids, condensed tannins, and free phenolic 
acids. Six sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose, myo-inositol, raffinose, and 
stachyose), seven organic acids (oxalic, maleic, citric, malic, lactic, 
succinic, and acetic), and one phenolic acid (gallic acid) were positively 
identified in natural and roasted hazelnut varieties; among these, sucrose, 
malic acid, and gallic acid predominated, respectively. Total sugars among 
hazelnut varieties ranged from 1.99 to 4.94 g/100 g, organic acids from 0.96 to 
2.72 g/100 g, condensed tannins from 3.99 to 40.56 mg of catechin equivalents/g, 
and gallic acid from 0.159 to 0.871 mg/100 g. Differences existed in the sugar 
and organic acid contents between natural and roasted hazelnut varieties, but 
they did not follow any particular trend. Significant losses (p < 0.05) in 
condensed tannins ( approximately 97.3%) and gallic acid ( approximately 66.7%) 
were noted when the hazelnuts were roasted. The present work suggests that 
roasting resulted in significant loss in condensed tannins and gallic acid due 
to the removal of the brown skin. The effect of roasting on sugars and organic 
acids was not noteworthy.

An analytical method based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) and followed by 
liquid chromatographic separation and ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) is 
proposed for the determination of 10 phenolic compounds which participate on 
beer stability and sensory properties in alcohol-free beers. Acetonitrile was 
found to be the most appropriate solvent for the elution of polyphenolic 
compounds adsorbed on C18 cartridges. The performance of the method was assessed 
by the evaluation of parameters such as absolute recovery (generally higher than 
60%), repeatability (lower than 10%), linearity (r2 higher than 0.993) and 
limits of quantitation (ranging from 1 to 37 microg/L); no matrix effects were 
observed. The polyphenol content of different Spanish alcohol-free beers is 
presented. Five phenolic compounds such as protocatechuic, p-coumaric, ferulic, 
caffeic acids, and (+)-catechin were identified at levels lower than 10 mg/L.

array detection analysis of crude extracts and after thiolysis. Total 
polyphenols are distributed in a wide concentration range depending on the 
cultivar. Procyanidins are the class of polyphenols that present major 
concentrations in apple. Their average degrees of polymerization range from 4 to 
8 depending on the cultivar. Apple cultivars were technologically classified 
into bitter and nonbitter categories using different classification systems 
obtained by applying several pattern recognition techniques, such as principal 
component analysis, K-nearest neighbors, soft independent modeling of class 
analogy, partial least-squares, and multilayer feed-forward-artificial neural 
networks, to apple pulp, peel, or juice data (individual polyphenol 
concentrations, total procyanidin content, and the average degree of 
polymerization of procyanidins). Bitter apple cultivars present higher contents 
of flavan-3-ols and/or dihydrochalcones than nonbitter cultivars. Detailed 
knowledge of the polyphenolic profile of each apple cultivar affords information 
about their susceptibility to oxidation, their sensory properties (bitterness, 
astringency), and their possible influence on the characteristics and quality of 
the final product (juice, cider) when apples are processed.

Juices prepared from arils of 'Mollar' pomegranates were analysed for naturally 
occurring microorganisms, CIE Lab colour parameters, total phenols, anthocyanins 
and punicalagins, ellagic acid content and antioxidant capacity before and after 
low-, mild- and high-temperature pasteurisations (LTPs, MTPs and HTPs): 65, 80 
and 90 °C for 30 or 60s. Mean aerobic plate count (APC), yeast and mold count 
(YMC), and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) for fresh juices were 5.7, 5.36 and 4.0 
log CFU/mL, respectively. MTPs and HTPs were sufficiently effective to decrease 
APCs to nil or negligible levels. An increase in CIE a values and decrease in 
CIE b values were the characteristic colour changes in heat-treated juices. The 
effect of pasteurisations showed that total phenols, punicalagins and ellagic 
acid were not much affected by thermal processing. Total anthocyanin content and 
antioxidant capacity were substantially and significantly influenced by the heat 
treatment applied. A linear relationship was observed between Trolox equivalent 
antioxidant capacity (TEAC) values and total anthocyanins, suggesting that they 
contributed strongly to the antioxidant capacity of pomegranate juice.

Six selected phenolic aglycons (caffeic and ellagic acids, kaempferol, 
quercetin, myricetin, and morin) in nine types of berries, and their changes as 
influenced by jam processing, have been evaluated using optimized HPLC with 
diode-array detection. The berry samples, fresh and after jam processing, were 
analyzed, and the total amounts of selected phenolics as aglycons were 
identified and determined by acid hydrolysis. Their contents in fresh and jam 
samples did not indicate appreciable changes; therefore, the influence of jam 
processing on these selected phenolics in berries was suggested to be small, and 
was mostly present in berries as several conjugated forms that were 
glycosylated, esterified, etc., in the samples. The total phenolic content of 
each sample was also determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The three samples 
of each berry, namely fresh, jam, and acid hydrolysate of the berry, had similar 
total phenolic contents. On the other hand, the scavenging effect on the 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was measured, and acid hydrolysates 
showed stronger activity than that of the fresh and jam-processed samples for 
all of the berry types.

after single oral administration in human subjects.

Greece.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hesperetin and naringenin, the aglycones of the 
flavanone glycosides hesperidin and naringin, occur naturally in citrus fruits. 
They exert interesting pharmacological properties such as antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, blood lipid and cholesterol lowering and are considered to 
contribute to health benefits in humans. However, no information is available on 
the pharmacokinetics of the citrus flavanones hesperetin and naringenin after 
their oral administration to humans as pure aglycones. Therefore, the objective 
of the present investigation was the evaluation of the pharmacokinetic 
parameters of hesperetin and naringenin in plasma and urine, after their single 
oral administration in humans in the form of solid dispersion capsules, and also 
to improve the absorption rate of flavanones by using aglycones rather than the 
naturally occurring glycosides.
DESIGN: Six healthy volunteers received orally 135 mg of each compound, 
hesperetin and naringenin, under fasting conditions. Blood samples were 
collected at 14 different time points over a 12 h period. Urine was collected 
over 24 h, in five sequential timed intervals. Plasma and urine hesperetin and 
naringenin concentrations, after enzymatic hydrolysis of their conjugated forms, 
were measured using validated high-pressure liquid chromatography methods. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters for hesperetin and naringenin, such as C(max), 
T(max), AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity), CL/F, V/F, t(1/2), MRT, A(e), A(e)((0-24)), 
and R(max) were calculated from their plasma or urine concentrations.
RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that both hesperetin and naringenin 
were rapidly absorbed and their concentrations in plasma observed 20 min after 
dosing and reached a peak in 4.0 and 3.5 h, respectively. The mean peak plasma 
concentration (C(max)) for hesperetin and naringenin were 825.78+/-410.63 ng/ml 
(2731.8+/-1358.4 nmol/l) and 2009.51+/-770.82 ng/ml (7386.6+/-2833.4 nmol/l), 
respectively and the mean AUC(0-infinity) values were 4846.20+/-1675.99 ng h/ml 
and 9424.52+/-2960.52 ng h/ml for hesperetin and naringenin, respectively. The 
elimination half-life for hesperetin was found to be 3.05+/-0.91 h and for 
naringenin 2.31+/-0.40 h, respectively. The mean values of the relative 
cumulative urinary excretion, as percentage of the administered dose, for 
hesperetin and naringenin, were found to be 3.26+/-0.44 and 5.81+/-0.81%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of the flavanone aglycones, hesperetin and 
naringenin, lead to their rapid absorption as their conjugated forms. The 
cumulative urinary recovery data indicated low bioavailability for both 
flavanone aglycones, owing to extensive first-pass metabolism partly by cleavage 
of the C-ring by the enzymes of intestinal bacteria leading to degradation 
products such as phenolic acids.

Cuidad Universitaria s/n, 28040 Madrid, Spain.

The ellagic acid, total phenolic, and vitamin C contents in four raspberry 
cultivars (Heritage, Autumn Bliss, Rubi, and Zeva) grown in Spain were detected 
and quantified by HPLC in fresh, just frozen, and stored fruits at -20 degrees C 
for a one year period. Ellagic acid [207-244 mg kg(-)(1) of fresh weight (fw)], 
total phenolic (137-1776 mg kg(-)(1) of fw), and vitamin C (221-312 mg kg(-)(1) 
of fw) contents in raw material were higher in the late cultivars Zeva and Rubi 
than in the early cultivars Autumn Bliss and Heritage. The freezing process 
slightly affected the values of extracted ellagic acid, total phenolic, and 
vitamin C content. At the end of long-term frozen storage (12 months), no 
significant change of total phenolic content extracted was observed, but 
significant decreases of 14-21% in ellagic acid and of 33-55% in vitamin C were 
quantified. Free radical scavenging capacity measured as antiradical efficiency 
(AE) depends on the seasonal period of harvest. Late cultivars, Rubi (6.1 x 
10(-)(4)) and Zeva (10.17 x 10(-)(4)), showed higher AE than early cultivars, 
Heritage (4.02 x 10(-)(4)) and Autumn Bliss (4.36 x 10(-)(4)). The freezing 
process produced a decrease of AE values in the four cultivars ranging between 4 
and 26%. During the frozen storage, the AE values reached after the freezing 
process remained unchanged.

Frozen storage effects on anthocyanins and volatile compounds of raspberry 
fruit.

Ciudad Universitaria s/n, 28040 Madrid, Spain.

The quantitative and qualitative evolution of the anthocyanins and volatile 
compounds of four raspberry cultivars (cvs. Heritage, Autumn Bliss, Zeva, and 
Rubi) growing in Spain were analyzed raw, just frozen, and during long-term 
frozen storage at -20 degrees C for a 1 year period. HS-SPME coupled with GC-MS 
and HPLC techniques were employed to study the evolution of the volatile 
compounds and the individual anthocyanins, respectively. The volatile aroma 
composition changes produced by the freezing process and long-term frozen 
storage were minimal. Only a significant increase in extraction capacity was 
obtained for alpha-ionone (27%) and for caryophyllene (67%) in Heritage at 12 
months of storage. The stability of anthocyanins to freezing and frozen storage 
depends on the seasonal period of harvest. Heritage and Autumn Bliss (early 
cultivars) were less affected by processing and long-term frozen storage (1 
year), and the total pigment extracted showed the tendency to increase 17 and 
5%, respectively. Rubi and Zeva (late cultivars) suffered a decreased trend on 
the total anthocyanin content of 4% for Rubi and 17.5% for Zeva. Cyanidin 
3-glucoside most easily suffered the degradative reactions that take place 
during processing and the storage period.

Agricultural University, Frederiksberg C, Denmark. mola@kvl.dk

A number of potential antioxidants have been evaluated for their effect on 
formation of radicals in beer using the electron spin resonance (ESR) lag phase 
method. Sulfite was found to be the only compound that was able to delay the 
formation of radicals, whereas phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids, 
catechin, epicatechin, and proanthocyanidin dimers had no effect on the 
formation of radicals. Ascorbate, cystein, and cysteamin were on the other hand 
found to be prooxidants. It is suggested that antioxidants must be able to 
either scavenge peroxides or trap metal ions in order to be effective in beer. 
The effectiveness of sulfite is suggested to be a consequence of its 
two-electron nonradical producing reaction with peroxides.

Phenolic compounds are secondary plant metabolites which have long been 
associated with flavor and color characteristics of fruits and vegetables. These 
phenolic compounds attract great interest due to their postulated health 
protecting properties. However, adequate intakes and absorption rate of phenolic 
compounds are necessary for these beneficial effects. Until now, little is known 
about alterations of phenolic compounds content by the cooking process. In the 
present study, the influence of different volumes of cooking water on the amount 
of selected phenolic marker compounds resting in the vegetables was assessed. In 
zucchini, rutin was quantified as a marker for flavonoid glycosides. Chlorogenic 
acid, representative of phenolic acids was analyzed in carrots. In beans, rutin 
and quercitrin, both belonging to flavonoid glycosides, were investigated. In 
potatoes, chlorogenic and caffeic acid were determined. The cooking of zucchini, 
beans and carrots with smaller amounts of water resulted in significant higher 
content of phenolic phytochemicals in the vegetables compared to cooking with 
larger water volumes. For potatoes, which showed great variations in content of 
phenolic acids after cooking, no significant differences in phenolic acids was 
observed. It can be concluded from these observations, that real intakes of 
phenolic compounds from cooked vegetables are lower and that the amounts 
consumed are therefore overestimated.

flour and five bread model systems: insight into mechanisms of improved 
availability.

Acclimatization Institute - National Research Institute, Radzikow, PL-05-870, 
Blonie, Poland.

BACKGROUND: The bread-making process influences bread components, including 
phenolics that significantly contribute to its antioxidant properties. Five 
bread model systems made from different rye cultivars were investigated to 
compare their impact on concentration of ethanol-soluble (free and ester-bound) 
and insoluble phenolics.
RESULTS: Breads produced by a straight dough method without acid addition (A) 
and three-stage sourdough method with 12 h native starter preparation (C) 
exhibited the highest, genotype-dependent concentrations of free phenolic acids. 
Dough acidification by direct acid addition (method B) or by gradual production 
during prolonged starter fermentation (24 and 48 h, for methods D and E) 
considerably decreased their level. However, breads B were enriched in soluble 
ester-bound fraction. Both direct methods, despite substantial differences in 
dough pH, caused a similar increase in the amount of insoluble ester-bound 
fraction. The contents of phenolic fractions in rye bread were positively 
related to activity level of feruloyl esterase and negatively to those of 
arabinoxylan-hydrolysing enzymes in wholemeal flour.
CONCLUSION: The solubility of rye bread phenolics may be enhanced by application 
of a suitable bread-making procedure with respect to rye cultivar, as the 
mechanisms of this process are also governed by a response of an individual 
genotype with specific biochemical profile.

The contents of pnenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers were quantified by 
HPLC analysis after alkaline hydrolysis in kernels of 17 rye (Secale cereale L.) 
varieties grown in one location in Denmark during 1997 and 1998. Significant 
variations (P < 0.05) with regard to the concentration of the analyzed 
components were observed among the different rye varieties and also between 
different harvest years. However, the content of phenolic acids in the analyzed 
rye varieties was narrow compared to cereals such as wheat and barley. The 
concentration of ferulic acid, the most abundant phenolic acid ranged from 900 
to 1170 microgram g(-1) dry matter. The content in sinapic acid ranged from 70 
to 140 microgram g(-1) dry matter, p-coumaric acid ranged from 40 to 70 
microgram g(-1) dry matter, and caffeic, p-hydroxybenzoic, protocatechuic, and 
vanillic acids were all detected in concentrations less than 20 microgram g(-1) 
dry matter. The most abundant ferulic acid dehydrodimer 8-O-4 -DiFA was 
quantified in concentrations from 130 to 200 microgram g(-1) dry matter followed 
by 8,5 -DiFA benzofuran form (50-100 microgram g(-1) dry matter), 5,5 -DiFA 
(40-70 microgram g(-1) dry matter), and 8,5 -DiFA (20-40 microgram g(-1) dry 
matter).

Major brands of cocoa powder products present in the Spanish market were 
analyzed for monomeric flavanols [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] and 
flavonols [quercetin-3-glucuronide, quercetin-3-glucoside (isoquercitrin), 
quercetin-3-arabinoside, and quercetin]. In addition, the influence of the 
manufacturing process of cocoa powder products, in particular, the 
alkalinization treatment ( Dutching), on the original content of these 
flavonoids has been studied. (-)-Epicatechin was in the range of 116.02-730.26 
microg/g, whereas (+)-catechin was in the range of 81.40-447.62 microg/g in the 
commercial cocoa products studied. Among flavonols, quercetin-3-arabinoside and 
isoquercitrin were the major flavonols in the cocoa powder products studied, 
ranging from 2.10 to 40.33 microg/g and from 3.97 to 42.74 microg/g, 
respectively, followed by quercetin-3-glucuronide (0.13-9.88 microg/g) and 
quercetin aglycone (0.28-3.25 microg/g). To our knowledge, these results are the 
first quantitative data in relation to the content of individualized flavonol 
derivatives in commercial cocoa powder products. The alkalinization treatment 
resulted in 60% loss of the mean total flavonoid content. Among flavanols, 
(-)-epicatechin presented a larger decline (67%, as a mean percentage 
difference) than (+)-catechin (38%), probably because of its epimerization into 
(-)-catechin, a less bioavailable form of catechin. A decline was also confirmed 
for di-, tri-, and tetrameric procyanidins. In the case of flavonols, quercetin 
presented the highest loss (86%), whereas quercetin-3-glucuronide, 
quercetin-3-arabinoside, and isoquercitrin showed a similar decrease (58, 62, 
and 61%, respectively). It is concluded that the large decrease found in the 
flavonoid content of natural cocoa powder, together with the observed change in 
the monomeric flavanol profile that results from the alkalinization treatment, 
could affect the antioxidant properties and the polyphenol biovailability of 
cocoa powder products.

Phenolic and orthodiphenolic compounds together with carotenoids, tocopherols, 
pigments, and fatty acids were tested for their antioxidant effect in 79 samples 
of virgin olive oils cv. Picual and Hojiblanca. A linear regression based on the 
oleic/linoleic ratio and the contents of phenols and tocopherols showed a good 
correlation (adjusted-R(2) = 0.91) with the stability measured by Rancimat, 
later verified with an external text set (adjusted-R(2) = 0.95). A tentative 
study on the percentage contribution of each chemical variable to stability is 
discussed. The contribution of phenolic and orthodiphenolic compounds was around 
51%, the composition of fatty acids 24%, and in less percentage 
alpha-tocopherol, carotenoids, and chlorophylls. No effect, or very little, was 
shown by beta- and gamma-tocopherols.

The objective of this work was to quantify the flavonoids present in foods most 
commonly consumed by the Brazilian population. The predominant flavonoids found 
in largest abundance in all of the analyzed vegetables were glycosides of 
quercetin. In lettuce, a small amount of luteolin was also detected. In sweet 
pepper, quercetin and luteolin were both present. White onion [48-56 mg/100 g of 
fresh weight (FW), expressed as aglycon], red onion (40-100 mg/100 g of FW), red 
lettuce (67-67.2 mg/100 g of FW), arugula (41-118 mg/100 g of FW), and chicory 
(18-38 mg/100 g of FW) were highest in total flavonoids. In fruits, the highest 
concentrations of flavonoids were found in the peel (125-170 mg/100 g of FW) and 
pulp (35-44 mg/100 g of FW) of oranges and in some apple varieties (14-36 mg/100 
g of FW). Variability in flavonoid content due to time of harvesting was high 
for leafy vegetables and red onions. The estimated ingestion by Brazilian 
population ranged from 60 to 106 mg/day.

The antioxidant catechin content of chocolate is four times that of tea. 
Chocolate contributed 20% of the catechin intake in a representative sample of 
the Dutch population, and tea contributes 55%. Epidemiological assessments of 
health effects of tea should include other foods that are sources of catechins.

Catechins, compounds that belong to the flavonoid class, are potentially 
beneficial to human health. To enable epidemiological evaluation of these 
compounds, data on their contents in foods are required. HPLC with UV and 
fluorescence detection was used to determine the levels of (+)-catechin, 
(-)-epicatechin, (+)-gallocatechin (GC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), 
(-)-epicatechin gallate (ECg), and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) in 24 
types of fruits, 27 types of vegetables and legumes, some staple foods, and 
processed foods commonly consumed in The Netherlands. Most fruits, chocolate, 
and some legumes contained catechins. Levels varied to a large extent: from 4.5 
mg/kg in kiwi fruit to 610 mg/kg in black chocolate. (+)-Catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin were the predominant catechins; GC, EGC, and ECg were detected 
in some foods, but none of the foods contained EGCg. The data reported here 
provide a base for the epidemiological evaluation of the effect of catechins on 
the risk for chronic diseases.

Catechins, compounds that belong to the flavonoid class, are potentially 
beneficial to human health. To enable an epidemiological evaluation of 
catechins, data on their contents in foods are required. HPLC with UV and 
fluorescence detection was used to determine the levels of (+)-catechin, 
(-)-epicatechin, (+)-gallocatechin (GC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), 
(-)-epicatechin gallate (ECg), and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) in 8 
types of black tea, 18 types of red and white wines, apple juice, grape juice, 
iced tea, beer, chocolate milk, and coffee. Tea infusions contained high levels 
of catechins (102-418 mg of total catechins/L), and tea was the only beverage 
that contained GC, EGC, ECg, and EGCg in addition to (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin. Catechin concentrations were still substantial in red wine 
(27-96 mg/L), but low to negligible amounts were found in white wine, 
commercially available fruit juices, iced tea, and chocolate milk. Catechins 
were absent from beer and coffee. The data reported here provide a base for the 
epidemiological evaluation of the effect of catechins on the risk for chronic 
diseases.

The relationship between resveratrol (RES) bioavalability and its effect on 
tumor growth was investigated. Tissue levels of RES were studied after i.v. and 
oral administration of trans-resveratrol (t-RES) to rabbits, rats, and mice. 
Half-life of RES in plasma, after i.v. administration of 20 mg t-RES/kg b.wt., 
was very short (e.g., 14.4 min in rabbits). The highest concentration of RES in 
plasma, either after i.v. or oral administration (e.g., 2.6 +/- 1.0 microM in 
mice 2.5 min after receiving 20 mg t-RES/kg orally), was reached within the 
first 5 min in all animals studied. Extravascular levels (brain, lung, liver, 
and kidney) of RES, which paralleled those in plasma, were always < 1 nmol/g 
fresh tissue. RES measured in plasma or tissues was in the trans form (at least 
99%). Hepatocytes metabolized t-RES in a dose-dependent fashion (e.g., 43 nmol 
of t-RES/g x min in the presence of 20 microM tRES), which means that the liver 
can remove circulating RES very rapidly. In vitro B16 melanoma (B16M) cell 
proliferation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was inhibited by 
t-RES in a concentration-dependent fashion (100% inhibition of tumor growth was 
found in the presence of 5 microM t-RES). Addition of 10 microM H(2)O(2) to B16M 
cells, cultured in the presence of 5 microM t-RES, reactivated cell growth. Oral 
administration of t-RES (20 mg/kg twice per day; or included in the drinking 
water at 23 mg/l) did not inhibit growth of B16M inoculated into the footpad of 
mice (solid growth). However, oral administration of t-RES (as above) decreased 
hepatic metastatic invasion of B16M cells inoculated intrasplenically. The 
antimetastatic mechanism involves a t-RES (1 microM)-induced inhibition of 
vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in the hepatic sinusoidal 
endothelium (HSE), which consequently decreased in vitro B16M cell adhesion to 
the endothelium via very late activation antigen 4 (VLA-4).

The effects of product and preparation variables on the in-cup chemical 
composition of tea extracts is of interest because the appearance and taste 
characteristics and the possible health effects of a tea liquor arise from the 
chemical components extracted from the leaf during tea preparation. A 
comprehensive study was therefore undertaken to determine the contributions of 
product and preparation variables on the total soluble solids, caffeine, and 
polyphenol contents of tea extracts. The results of this study show that the 
variety, growing environment, manufacturing conditions, and grade (particle 
size) of the tea leaves each influence the tea leaf and final infusion 
compositions. In addition, the composition of the tea infusion was shown to be 
influenced by whether the tea was contained in a teabag and, if so, the size and 
material of construction of the bag. Finally, the preparation method, including 
the amounts of tea and water used, infusion time, and amount of agitation, was 
shown to be a major determinant of the component concentrations of tea beverages 
as consumed. An illustration of the variation introduced by these product and 
preparation factors is provided by comparing solids, caffeine, and polyphenol 
contents of green and black tea infusions when commercial products are prepared 
according to the instructions given on their packaging.

The major flavanone-7-O-glycoside constituents in citrus fruit juices (naringin, 
hesperidin, neohesperidin, narirutin, and eriocitrin) were separated as 
diastereomers by multidimensional liquid chromatography. The method consisted of 
coupling two HPLC columns: a reversed-phase (RP(18)) column was used for the 
separation of flavanone glycosides, which were, then, individually switched into 
a carboxymethylated beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD)-based column and resolved as the 
corresponding stereoisomers. The method was used for the full analysis of 
flavanone glycosides in fresh hand-squeezed and commercial fruit juices by 
combining the quantitative estimation with the diastereomeric analysis. 
Quantitative data were in general consistent with previously reported data in 
this field. CC-LC isomer analysis was carried out by coupling the beta-CD column 
with a mass spectrometer operated with negative ion electrospray ionization 
(ESI-MS). The results showed that hesperidin was present in orange juices almost 
exclusively as the 2S isomer, whereas narirutin had mainly the 2R configuration. 
In grapefruit juices (2S)-naringin prevailed with the respect to the 2R isomer, 
whereas the opposite was true for narirutin. Lemon juices contained eriocitrin 
stereoisomers in equal amount (50% each), but hesperidin was almost exclusively 
found as the 2S isomer. Significant differences of the diastereomeric ratios 
were observed between freshly squeezed juices and juices from commercial 
sources.

The aims of the present study were to determine the level of (-)-epicatechin 
(EC) and its metabolites in rat plasma after oral administration of cocoa powder 
and to evaluate the protective effect of cocoa powder in terms of suppressing 
the oxidation of plasma components. Rats were orally administered 1 g cocoa 
powder/kg body weight, containing 7.80 mg EC, and their blood was collected 
before administration and at designated time intervals thereafter. The EC and 
its metabolites in plasma were treated with beta-glucuronidase and/or sulfatase, 
then analysed by HPLC and by liquid chromatography-MS. Several EC-related 
compounds were detected in plasma such as free EC, and glucuronide, sulfate, and 
glucuronide-sulfate conjugates of non-methylated or methylated EC. All EC 
metabolites showed a maximum concentration in plasma at 30-60 min 
post-administration. Glucuronide conjugates of both non-methylated and 
methylated EC were found in high concentration in plasma. Moreover, 
administration of cocoa powder significantly reduced the accumulation of lipid 
peroxides in plasma and significantly reduced the consumption of 
alpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with 
2,2'-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH (25 mmol/l)) or CuSO(4) 
(100 micromol/l) compared with that in the case of plasma obtained before 
administration. The total EC concentration in plasma was negatively correlated 
with the level of accumulation of lipid peroxides in plasma oxidized by 
treatment with AAPH (25 mmol/l) and was positively correlated with the level of 
residual alpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with CuSO(4) (100 
micromol/l). These results indicate that EC in cocoa powder was absorbed from 
the digestive tract, that various conjugated forms of EC were generated in the 
digestive tract and distributed to the plasma, and that these enhanced the 
antioxidative activity of plasma.

(-)-Epicatechin is a major polyphenol component of cocoa powder. The absorption 
and urinary excretion of (-)-epicatechin following administration of different 
levels of either cocoa powder (150, 750, and 1500 mg/kg) or (-)-epicatechin (1, 
5, and 10 mg/kg) were evaluated in rats. Both the sum of plasma (-)-epicatechin 
metabolites at 1 h postadministration and peak plasma concentrations increased 
in a dose-dependent fashion. The sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in urine, 
excreted within 18 h postadministration, also increased with dose. Moreover, the 
sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites excreted in urine reached the same level in 
both (-)-epicatechin and cocoa powder administration groups for equivalent 
amounts of (-)-epicatechin. These results suggest that, in the dose range 
examined in this study, bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin following 
administration of either (-)-epicatechin or cocoa powder shows dose dependence 
and that the various compounds present in cocoa powder have little effect on the 
bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin in cocoa powder.

We compared levels of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and their metabolites in 
rat plasma and urine after oral administration. Rats were divided into four 
groups and given (+)-catechin (CA group), (-)-epicatechin (EC group), a mixture 
of the two (MIX group) or deionized water. Blood samples were collected before 
administration and at designated time intervals thereafter. Urine samples were 
collected 0-24 h postadministration. (+)-Catechin, (-)-epicatechin and their 
metabolites in plasma and urine were analyzed by HPLC-mass spectrometry after 
treatment with beta-glucuronidase and/or sulfatase. After administration, 
absorbed (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were mainly present in plasma as 
metabolites, such as nonmethylated or 3'-O-methylated conjugates. In the CA and 
MIX groups, the primary metabolite of (+)-catechin in plasma was glucuronide in 
the nonmethylated form. In the EC and MIX groups, in contrast, the primary 
metabolites of (-)-epicatechin in plasma were glucuronide and sulfoglucuronide 
in nonmethylated forms, and sulfate in the 3'-O-methylated forms. Urinary 
excretion of the total amount of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in the EC group was 
significantly higher than the amount of (+)-catechin metabolites in the CA 
group. The sum of (+)-catechin metabolites in the urine was significantly lower 
in the MIX group than in the CA group, and the sum of (-)-epicatechin 
metabolites in the MIX group was also significantly lower than in the EC group. 
These results suggest that the bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin is higher than 
that of (+)-catechin in rats, and that, in combination, (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin might be absorbed competitively in the gastrointestinal tract of 
rats.

Erratum in
    Eur J Nutr. 2005 Feb;44(1):9.

BACKGROUND: Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural polyphenolic substance contained 
in many Lamiaceae herbs such as Perilla frutescens. Previous studies have shown 
RA has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activity. However, little is known on 
the absorption, metabolism, degradation and excretion of RA.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study in healthy humans was to determine the 
absorption, metabolism, and urinary excretion of RA after a single intake of 
perilla extract (PE).
METHOD: Six healthy men (mean age 37.2 +/- 6.2 y and mean body mass index 22.0 
+/- 1.9 kg/m(2)) were enrolled in the study that was a crossover design 
involving single intakes of PE containing 200 mg RA and placebo with a 10 day 
interval between treatments. Blood samples were collected before intake and at 
designated time intervals, while urine samples were collected over the periods 
0-6 h, 6-24 h and 24-48 h after intake. RA and its related metabolites in plasma 
and urine were measured by LC-MS.
RESULTS: RA, methylated RA (methyl-RA), caffeic acid (CAA), ferulic acid (FA) 
and a trace of m-coumaric acid (COA) were detected in the urine after intake of 
PE. In plasma, RA, methyl-RA and FA were detected, with maximum levels obtained 
0.5, 2 and 0.5 h after intake of PE, respectively. The majority of these 
components in both plasma and urine were present as conjugated forms 
(glucuronide and/or sulfated). The proportion of RA and its related metabolites 
excreted in the urine was 6.3 +/- 2.2% of the total dose, with approximately 75% 
of these components being excreted within 6 h after intake of PE.
CONCLUSIONS: RA contained in PE was absorbed, conjugated and methylated 
following intake, with a small proportion of RA being degraded into various 
components, such as conjugated forms of CAA, FA and COA. These metabolites were 
then rapidly excreted in the urine.

BACKGROUND: Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols such as catechins and 
procyanidins and has been shown in various models to inhibit LDL oxidation and 
atherogenesis.
OBJECTIVE: We examined whether long-term intake of cocoa powder alters plasma 
lipid profiles in normocholesterolemic and mildly hypercholesterolemic human 
subjects.
DESIGN: Twenty-five subjects were randomly assigned to ingest either 12 g 
sugar/d (control group) or 26 g cocoa powder and 12 g sugar/d (cocoa group) for 
12 wk. Blood samples were collected before the study and 12 wk after intake of 
the test drinks. Plasma lipids, LDL oxidative susceptibility, and urinary 
oxidative stress markers were measured.
RESULTS: At 12 wk, we measured a 9% prolongation from baseline levels in the lag 
time of LDL oxidation in the cocoa group. This prolongation in the cocoa group 
was significantly greater than the reduction measured in the control group 
(-13%). A significantly greater increase in plasma HDL cholesterol (24%) was 
observed in the cocoa group than in the control group (5%). A negative 
correlation was observed between plasma concentrations of HDL cholesterol and 
oxidized LDL. At 12 wk, there was a 24% reduction in dityrosine from baseline 
concentrations in the cocoa group. This reduction in the cocoa group was 
significantly greater than the reduction in the control group (-1%).
CONCLUSION: It is possible that increases in HDL-cholesterol concentrations may 
contribute to the suppression of LDL oxidation and that polyphenolic substances 
derived from cocoa powder may contribute to an elevation in HDL cholesterol.

Kakkalide is a major isoflavonoid from the flowers of Pueraria lobata (Willd.) 
Ohwi, possessing the protective effect against ethanol-induced intoxication and 
hepatic injury. The metabolism of kakkalide was investigated in rats. Thirteen 
metabolites were isolated by using solvent extraction and repeated 
chromatographic methods and identified by using spectroscopic methods including 
UV, IR, mass spectrometry, NMR, and circular dichroism experiments. Four new 
compounds were identified as irisolidone-7-O-glucuronide (M-1), 
tectorigenin-7-O-sulfate (M-2), tectorigenin-4'-O-sulfate (M-3), and biochanin 
A-6-O-sulfate (M-4) together with nine known compounds identified as irisolidone 
(M-5), tectorigenin (M-6), tectoridin (M-7), 
5,7-dihydroxy-8,4'-dimethoxyisoflavone (M-8), isotectorigenin (M-9), biochanin A 
(M-10), genistein (M-11), daidzein (M-12), and equol (M-13). The metabolic 
pathway of kakkalide was proposed, which is important to understand its 
metabolic fate and disposition in humans.

Phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of extra-virgin olive oils 
extracted from several Italian varieties were studied at production and during 
storage. The antioxidant activity was measured according to the following tests: 
in the aqueous phase, by radical scavenging of the 
2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical cation; and 
in the lipid phase, using the beta-carotene bleaching method. The phenolic 
content was not correlated to the oxidation indices (peroxide value and 
spectrophotometric constants). The phenolic contents and profiles of the various 
cultivars showed remarkable differences. The phenolic content was strongly 
correlated with the antioxidant activity measured according to the beta-carotene 
test and weakly correlated with the radical scavenging ability.

In the present paper, the following extraction techniques have been used for 
extracting isoflavonoids from the species Matricaria recutita, Rosmarinus 
officinalis, Foeniculum vulgare, and Agrimonia eupatoria L.: supercritical fluid 
extraction (SFE), pressurized fluid extraction, matrix solid phase dispersion, 
ultrasonic extraction in an ultrasonic bath (USE) and by means of an ultrasonic 
homogeniser (HOM), extraction by means of Soxhlet apparatus (SOX), and solid 
phase extraction. Experimental optimization of all techniques has been carried 
out using a soybean flour. Subsequent analyses of the extracts were carried out 
by liquid chromatography with UV detection. The maximum yields of daidzein and 
genistein were obtained by extraction with the SOX, USE, and HOM techniques. The 
maximum yields of apigenin and biochanin A from herb samples were obtained by 
SFE.

Four selected A. gangeticus accessions were evaluated in terms of color 
attributes, phytopigments, including betaxanthin, betacyanin, and carotenoid 
profiles, proximate, minerals, and antioxidant capacity (AC). Color attributes, 
phytopigments, proximate, minerals, and AC of A. gangeticus significantly varied 
across the accessions. For the first time, we identified four betacyanin 
compounds, such as amaranthine, iso-amaranthine, betanin, iso-betanin. We also 
identified five carotenoid compounds zeaxanthin neoxanthin, violaxanthin, 
lutein, and pro-vitamin A in A. gangeticus accessions. A. gangeticus contained 
adequate carbohydrates, protein, moisture, and dietary fiber. We found adequate 
iron, manganese, copper, zinc, sodium, molybdenum, boron, potassium, calcium, 
magnesium, phosphorus, sulfur in A. gangeticus accessions. The accessions LS7 
and LS9 had considerable color attributes, betacyanin, and carotenoid compounds, 
proximate, nutraceuticals, betalain, betaxanthin, and AC that could be used as 
preferable potent antioxidant varieties for consumption as sources of 
phytopigments, nutraceuticals, and antioxidants. The correlation study revealed 
that antioxidant constituents of A. gangeticus accession were strongly 
associated with AC. The identified components of betacyanin and carotenoid in A. 
gangeticus demands detail pharmacological study. The baseline data on color 
attributes, betacyanin, and carotenoid profiles, betaxanthins, betalains, and AC 
obtained in this present study could contribute to the scientific evaluation of 
pharmacologically active principles in A. gangeticus.

Four trichothecene-producing strains of Fusarium graminearum were grown on three 
maize grain fractions, whole grain, degermed grain, and the germ, to determine 
the effect of natural substrates on mycotoxin production. Monitoring the 
ergosterol content after 25 days of incubation indicated that fungal growth on 
all grain fractions was comparable. Trichothecene (TCT) production was highest 
on degermed grain, less on whole grain, and very low or nondetectable on the 
germ; similar results were found with four different strains. It was concluded 
that inhibitor(s) of TCT biosynthesis were present in maize germ. The presence 
of phenolic compounds was investigated in the different fractions. The 
hydroxamate 4-acetylbenzoxazolin-2-one (4-ABOA), a known inhibitor of mycotoxin 
production, was found in the degermed and whole grain fractions but not in the 
germ. Therefore, the TCT inhibition observed on the maize germ fraction used in 
our study is clearly not linked to 4-ABOA. Other soluble phenolic compounds were 
found at a much higher concentration in the germ than in the two other 
fractions. The inhibition property of the soluble ester-bound extracts was 
tested in liquid culture. A possible role for these compounds is discussed.

The advantages of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) intake as part of a varied, 
healthy and balanced diet were demonstrated by many epidemiological studies. In 
particular, several components present in EVOO, such as tocopherols, carotenoids 
and phenolic compounds, play an important protective role in mitigating 
inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. 
The protective effect exerted by EVOO was proposed to be accounted for by its 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory or anti-proliferative properties. The present 
review will focus on the interactions among EVOO's components and 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, aiming to reveal the mechanisms potentially involved 
in the anticancer action of EVOO. Cancer patients very frequently develop a 
devastating syndrome known as cachexia, which negatively impinges on their 
outcome. The main features of cachexia include progressive body weight loss, fat 
and muscle wasting, and dysmetabolism, all of which partially result from the 
onset of systemic inflammation. In this regard, the possibility that EVOO could 
be beneficial to cancer patients by mitigating cachexia will be reviewed, 
focusing on the skeletal muscle.

Daidzein is an estrogenic isoflavone present in many plants and therefore 
consumed in relatively high doses by humans. Daidzein has a low affinity for the 
estrogen receptor (3 orders of magnitude lower than estradiol) and has been 
demonstrated to have estrogenic effects in rodents after administration of high 
doses. We have studied the disposition and biotransformation of daidzein in rats 
fed a diet low in isoflavone content. Four male and four female Fischer 344 rats 
were orally administered 100 mg/kg daidzein; excreted urine and feces were 
collected for 96 h and unchanged daidzein as well as formed metabolites were 
quantified by HPLC. In urine of male rats, daidzein, daidzein-glucuronide, and 
daidzein-sulfate were excreted; in females, only unchanged daidzein and 
daidzein-glucuronide were present. Total urinary excretion of daidzein accounted 
for < 10% of dose in both males and females. The major pathway of daidzein 
elimination was excretion of unchanged daidzein with feces. Reductive 
daidzein-metabolites likely formed by intestinal microflora (equol, 
O-desmethylangolensin) were excreted with feces in small amounts (< 5% of dose). 
Excretion of daidzein and metabolites with urine and feces was rapid with 
elimination half-lives of less than 12 h; daidzein concentrations in urine and 
feces were below the limit of detection 36 h after daidzein administration. The 
results suggest that daidzein is only poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal 
tract in rodents. Absorbed daidzein is rapidly eliminated both unchanged and as 
conjugates with urine. The inefficient absorption of daidzein from the 
gastrointestinal tract and the rapid excretion may explain the weak 
estrogenicity of daidzein seen in vivo in rodents when compared to other 
estrogenic chemicals with comparatively low affinity to the estrogen receptor.

A novel gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) method was 
developed, using an ion trap mass spectrometer, for the simultaneous 
determination of olive oil bioactive components, elenolic acid, hydroxytyrosol, 
and tyrosol, in rat urine. Samples were analyzed by GC-MS/MS prior to and after 
enzymatic treatment. A solid phase extraction sample pretreatment step with 
greater than 80% analytical recoveries for all compounds was performed followed 
by a derivatization reaction prior to GC-MS/MS analysis. The calibration curves 
were linear for all compounds studied for a dynamic range between 1 and 500 ng. 
The limit of detection was in the mid picogram level for tyrosol and elenolic 
acid (300 pg) and in the low picogram level for hydroxytyrosol (2.5 pg). The 
method was applied to the analysis of rat urine samples after sustained oral 
intake of oleuropein or extra virgin olive oil as a diet supplement.

Simultaneous quantification of oleuropein and its metabolites in rat plasma by 
liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.

Oleuropein (OE) is the cardinal bioactive compound derived from Olea europaea 
and possesses numerous beneficial properties for human health. However, despite 
the plethora of analytical methods that have studied the biological fate of 
olive oil-derived bioactive compounds, no validated methodology has been 
published to date for the simultaneous determination of OE, along with all its 
major metabolites. In this study, a liquid chromatography-electrospray 
ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS/MS) method has been developed and 
validated for the quantification of OE, simultaneously with its main metabolites 
hydroxytyrosol, 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid, 
4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methoxy-phenol or homovanillyl alcohol, 
2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid or homovanillic acid, and elenolic acid 
in rat plasma matrix. Samples were analyzed by LC-ESI MS/MS prior to and after 
enzymatic treatment. A solid-phase extraction step with high mean recovery for 
all compounds was performed as sample pretreatment. Calibration curves were 
linear for all bioactive compounds over the range studied, while the method 
exhibited good accuracy, intra- and inter-day precision. The limit of detection 
was in the picogram range (per milliliterof plasma) for HT and OE and in the 
nanogram range (per milliliter of plasma) for the other analytes, and the method 
was simple and rapid. The developed methodology was successfully applied for the 
simultaneous quantification of OE and its aforementioned metabolites in rat 
plasma samples, thus demonstrating its suitability for pharmacokinetics, as well 
as bioavailability and metabolism studies.

A microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) method has been applied for the first time 
to the extraction of the main lignan, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), 
and the two most concentrated hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in flaxseed. The 
effects of microwave power, extraction time and alkaline treatment were 
investigated. It was shown that a 3 min MAE resulted in an SDG content of 
16.1+/-0.4 mg/g, a p-coumaric acid glucoside content of 3.7+/-0.2 mg/g and a 
ferulic acid glucoside content of 4.1+/-0.2 mg/g. These values were compared 
with those obtained using conventional extraction methods and the results 
demonstrated that MAE was more effective in terms of both yield and time 
consumption.

A method was developed to determine the flavanols prodelphinidin B3, procyanidin 
B3, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin by high-performance liquid chromatography, 
using dual-channel electrochemical detection. This method was especially suited 
to the direct analysis of beer samples and to analysis of acetone extracts of 
barley samples, and was capable of determining proanthocyanidins and catechins 
at levels of 0.1-5.0 mg l-1. The use of dual-channel electrochemical detection 
also enabled unambiguous peak identification by measurement of collection 
efficiencies. This method offered improved sensitivity and selectivity compared 
with ultraviolet detection, and sample preparation procedures were greatly 
simplified. The method was applied to the comparison of stabilized and 
unstabilized lagers, and to the analysis of different barley varieties grown in 
Ireland.

To gain comprehensive insight into the interactions of key coffee odorants, like 
the Strecker aldehydes, acetaldehyde, propanal, methylpropanal, 2- and 
3-methylbutanal, and methional, and the nonvolatile fraction of coffee, an 
untargeted metabolomics approach was applied. Ultra performance liquid 
chromatography (UPLC)-time of flight (TOF)-mass spectrometry (ESI-) profiling 
followed by statistical data analysis revealed a marker substance for a coffee 
beverage spiked with acetaldehyde with an accurate mass of 217.0703 [M - H]-. 
This compound could be identified as a reaction product of quinic acid (QA) and 
acetaldehyde linked by acetalization at the cis-diol function of QA. 
Consequently, the acetalization of aldehydes, QA, 5-O-caffeoyl quinic acid 
(CQA), and quinic acid γ-lactone (QAL) was investigated by means of model 
reactions, followed by synthesis, isolation, and structure elucidation via 
UPLC-TOF-MS and 1D and 2D NMR techniques. UHPLC-MS/MSMRM screening and the 
quantification of aldehyde adducts in coffee beverages revealed the presence of 
QA/acetaldehyde, -/propanal, -/methylpropanal, and -/methional reaction products 
and CQA/acetaldehyde, -/propanal, -/methylpropanal, -/2- and 3-methylbutanal, 
and -/methional and QAL/acetaldehyde adducts for the first time, in 
concentrations of 12-270 μg/L for QA/aldehydes, 5-225 μg/L for CQA/aldehydes, 
and 62-173 μg/L for QAL/acetaldehyde. The sensory characterization of the 
identified compounds showed bitter taste recognition thresholds of 48-297 μmol/L 
for CQA adducts and 658 μmol/L for QAL/acetaldehyde, while the QA adducts showed 
no bitter taste (<2000 μmol/L).

The variation in flavonoid concentration and composition was investigated in 
baby spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) cv. Emilia sown on three occasions, each 
harvested at three growth stages at 6-day intervals. After harvest, leaves were 
stored in polypropylene bags at 2 or 10 degrees C. Flavonoids were analyzed by 
reversed phase HPLC. Twelve flavonoid peaks were detected. The main flavonoid, 
making up on average 43% of the total flavonoid concentration, was identified as 
5,3',4'-trihydroxy-3-methoxy-6:7-methylenedioxyflavone-4'-glucuronide. Four 
other flavonoids each contributed 7-12% of the total flavonoid content. Total 
flavonoid content was relatively stable during normal retail storage conditions, 
although some of the individual flavonoid compounds showed considerable 
variation. The youngest plants had the highest flavonoid concentration, 
indicating that by harvesting the baby spinach a few days earlier than the 
current commercial stage of harvest, the flavonoid concentration in the product 
may be increased and the content of potentially health-promoting compounds 
enhanced.

Table olives are a major component of the Mediterranean diet and are associated 
with many beneficial biological activities, which are mainly related to their 
phenolic compounds. Olive fruit debittering process defines the quantitative and 
qualitative composition of table olives in biophenols. The aim of the present 
study was to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant capacity and DNA-protective 
activity of an extract originated from brine samples, according to the Greek 
style debbitering process of Kalamon olive fruits. The main phenolic components 
determined in the brine extract were hydroxytyrosol (HT), verbascoside (VERB) 
and tyrosol (T). The in vitro cell-free assays showed strong radical scavenging 
capacity from the extract, therefore antioxidant potential. At cellular level, 
human endothelial cells (EA.hy296) and murine myoblasts (C2C12) were treated 
with non-cytotoxic concentrations of the brine extract and the redox status was 
assessed by measuring glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid 
peroxidation levels (TBARS). Our results show cell type specific response, 
exerting a hormetic reflection at endothelial cells. Finally, in both cell 
lines, pre-treatment with brine extract protected from H2O2-induced DNA damage. 
In conclusion, this is the first holistic approach highlighted table olive 
wastewaters from Kalamon- Greek style debittering process, as valuable source of 
bioactive compounds, which could have interesting implications for the 
development of new products in food or other industries.

Qualitative and quantitative differences among the constituents in various 
fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill., family Apiaceae) teas prepared by classical 
infusion, microwave decoction, and dissolution are reported. Different 
commercial starting materials, such as fruit (unbroken and crushed), four herbal 
teas, and two instant herbal teas were evaluated. Chlorogenic acid (1), 
quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide (2), p-anisaldehyde (3), and trans-anethole (4) 
were identified by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS as constituents of fennel teas. No 
coumarins, which are characteristic constituents of plants of Apiaceae family, 
were found. Trans-anethole (4), the main constituent of the essential oil, was 
present in all teas. In addition p-anisaldehyde (3), a degradation product of 
trans-anethole, was also identified in all teas with the exception of two 
samples. Chlorogenic acid (1) and quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide (2) were also 
present in all teas. In addition, minor unidentified flavonol constituents were 
found in two teas. Quality, activity, and safety of the content of the 
investigated preparations are also discussed.

All the pea varieties differed significantly (p < 0.05) in their phytic acid 
content. The field pea cultivars had significantly (p < 0.05) higher levels of 
phytic acid and polyphenols than those of vegetable pea varieties. All the 
domestic processing and cooking methods could reduce the contents of phytic acid 
and polyphenols but germination for 48 hours seemed to have a marked lowering 
effect on the levels of these antinutrients in peas.

The effect of gamma irradiation (0.5 and 1.0 kGy) and/or cooking on the 
proximate composition, mineral content, tannin content, phytic acid content and 
the in vitro protein digestibility (IVPD) of two Sudanese faba bean cultivars 
(BB7-S1 and SH-S2) was investigated in the present study. The results obtained 
revealed that gamma irradiation and/or cooking treatments have slight effect in 
chemical composition and mineral content, while they caused significant 
(P ≤ 0.05) reduction on tannin content for both cultivars. Cooking of faba bean 
seeds also insignificantly (P ≤ 0.05) reduced phytic acid content for both 
cultivars, while irradiation process and/or cooking had fluctuated effect. For 
both cultivars, irradiation of seeds and/or cooking increased the in vitro 
protein digestibility (IVPD), with maximum value of IVPD (79.97%) obtained for 
cultivar BB7-S1. The results indicate that the treatments used in this study 
might improve the nutritive quality of faba bean seed due to reduction in 
antinutritional factors with a concomitant increase in IVPD.

: This review focuses on the conditions required to increase and maintain the 
antioxidant nutrients in both extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and table olives 
(TOs) from the agronomic and technological practices to the gastronomy. The main 
antioxidants of TOs and EVOO are phenol alcohols and acids, secoiridoids, 
lignans and flavones, all of which possess the ability to prolong the oil's 
shelf-life and exhibit healthy properties for humans. The precise detection of 
secoiridoid derivatives remains the breakthrough for the nutritional and health 
quality certification of extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) required for EFSA 
health claims. To attain the necessary antioxidant quality in both EVOO and TOs, 
it is necessary to hard focus on the several steps in the production chain, 
including olive cultivar, agronomic conditions, harvesting methods, and 
transformation technology. The quality level is maintained if the storage 
conditions aim to minimize the oxidative processes that occur due to oxygen and 
light. In terms of minor polar biophenols, there is disagreement on which 
between the organic or conventional EVOOs show higher concentration values. The 
strict disciplinary of production of protected designation EVOOs does not ensure 
higher phenol values in comparison to the artisanal EVOOs. In gastronomy, the 
EVOOs are preferable to seed oils, particularly during frying vegetable. The 
EVOOs show higher heat stability, linked both to the fatty acid composition and 
the phenol content, that is important for preventing fatty acids oxidation. 
Concerning TOs, the commercial presentation includes olives and olive paste. 
Both products show a remarkable loss of natural antioxidants after 
pasteurization and during storage as the thermal treatment mostly impacts on TOs 
secoiridoids.

Health-promoting properties such as antioxidative, anticarcinogenic, and 
cholesterol-lowering effects are described for mangiferin and hesperidin, the 
major phenolic compounds present in Cyclopia genistoides (honeybush). However, 
knowledge of their metabolic fate and their absorption from the gastrointestinal 
tract is very limited. The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations 
of mangiferin, hesperidin, and their metabolites in plasma, urine, and feces 
samples from pigs consuming an extract of Cyclopia genistoides. Pigs were 
administered up to 74 mg mangiferin per kilogram of body weight and 1 mg 
hesperidin per kilogram of body weight per day for 11 days. Plasma samples were 
collected at various time points on days 9 and 11 of the study and days 1 and 2 
after termination of extract administration. Urine and feces were collected in 
fractions for 24 hours. In the plasma samples, the aglycone of mangiferin 
(norathyriol) was detected. Mean plasma concentrations ranged from 7.8 to 11.8 
mumol/L. Six metabolites of mangiferin and hesperidin were detected in the 
urine, including methyl mangiferin, norathyriol, its monoglucuronide, 
hesperetin, hesperetin monoglucuronide, and eriodictyol monoglucuronide. Between 
26.0% and 30.8% of the administered dose of hesperidin and only between 1.4% and 
1.6% of mangiferin could be detected in the urine on days 9 and 11 of the study. 
Approximately 8.2% of the administered dose of mangiferin was determined in the 
feces. The main metabolite was norathyriol. Neither hesperidin nor metabolites 
ascribed to hesperidin intake were detected. The results suggest that formation 
of norathyriol from mangiferin occurs in vivo, and specific metabolites were 
identified in blood and excretion products in urine and feces. This study will 
aid in investigating the physiological functions of the parent compounds in 
vivo.

BACKGROUND: Despite decades of research on the relation between soy and breast 
cancer, questions regarding the absorption, metabolism, and distribution of 
isoflavones in breast tissue largely remain unanswered.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the potential health effects of isoflavone consumption 
on normal breast tissue; isoflavone concentrations, metabolites, and 
biodistribution were investigated and compared with 17beta-estradiol exposure.
DESIGN: In this dietary intervention study, healthy women were randomly 
allocated to a soy milk (n = 11; 16.98-mg genistein and 5.40-mg daidzein 
aglycone equivalents per dose), soy supplement (n = 10; 5.27-mg genistein and 
17.56-mg daidzein aglycone equivalents per dose), or control (n = 10) group. 
After a run-in period > or = 4 d, 3 doses of soy milk or soy supplements were 
taken daily for 5 d before an esthetic breast reduction. Blood and breast 
biopsies were collected during surgery and analyzed with liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: After soy administration, genistein and total daidzein concentrations, 
which were expressed as aglycone equivalents, ranged from 135.1 to 2831 nmol/L 
and 105.1 to 1397 nmol/L, respectively, in hydrolyzed serum and from 92.33 to 
493.8 pmol/g and 22.15 to 770.8 pmol/g, respectively, in hydrolyzed breast 
tissue. The major metabolites identified in nonhydrolyzed samples were 
genistein-7-O-glucuronide and daidzein-7-O-glucuronide, with an overall 
glucuronidation of 98%. Total isoflavones showed a breast adipose/glandular 
tissue distribution of 40:60, and their mean (+/-SEM) derived 17beta-estradiol 
equivalents toward estrogen receptor beta were 21 +/- 4-fold and 40 +/- 10-fold 
higher than the 17beta-estradiol concentrations in adipose (0.283 +/- 0.089 
pmol/g, P < 0.001) and glandular (0.246 +/- 0.091 pmol/g, P = 0.001) fractions, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: After intake of soy milk and soy supplements, isoflavones reach 
exposure levels in breast tissue at which potential health effects may occur.

Olive oil is the main source of fat in the Mediterranean diet, and its 
consumption has been related to a low incidence of coronary heart disease and 
certain cancers. Recent findings demonstrate that olive oil phenolics are 
powerful in vitro and in vivo antioxidants and display other biological 
activities that could partially account for the observed healthful effects of 
the Mediterranean diet. A detailed method optimization plan was carried out to 
separate the most popular phenols in olive oil for four separation parameters: 
buffer concentration, buffer pH, applied voltage and temperature. Consequently, 
an analytical method capable of separating 21 different phenols and polyphenols 
by capillary zone electrophoresis was developed; the separation was performed 
within 10 min, using a 40 cm x 50 microm capillary, with a 45 mM sodium 
tetraborate buffer (pH 9.60), at 27 kV and 30 degrees C. The optimized method 
was applied to methanolic extracts of several Italian extra-virgin olive oils 
obtained by different technologies in order to characterize and to compare their 
antioxidant profile. Positive correlations of phenolic compounds found by 
capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and two colorimetric indexes (total 
polyphenols and o-diphenols) were found and discussed.

spectrophotometric study among extraction methods of free and bound phenolic 
compounds.

Phenolic compounds are found in both free and bound forms in cereals. The 
majority is in the insoluble bound form, that is, bound to cell wall material, 
such as ferulic acid and its derivatives. The antioxidant properties of the 
phenolic compounds in grains are associated with the health benefits of grains 
and grain products. The extraction capacity of several solvent mixtures, for 
extracting free phenols from barley flours, and the possibility of employing a 
rapid automated solvent extraction method were studied. The extraction yield of 
each method was evaluated by correlating several spectrophotometric indices 
(absorption at 280, 320, and 370 nm and total phenolic compounds by the 
Folin-Ciocalteu method) with the antioxidant activities of the barley extracts 
(scavenging activity by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl method). Interesting 
results were obtained when ethanol and acetone-based extraction mixtures were 
employed to extract free phenols. A comparison was made between alkaline and 
acid hydrolysis. The extraction yield of bound phenolic compounds increased when 
the digestion time for alkaline hydrolysis was prolonged.

Capillary electrophoresis (CE) can be effectively used as a fast screening tool 
to obtain qualitative and semiquantitative information about simple and complex 
phenolic compounds of extra virgin olive oil. Three simple phenols (tyrosol, 
hydroxytyrosol, and vanillic acid), a secoiridoid derivative (deacetoxy 
oleuropein aglycon), and two lignans (pinoresinol and acetoxypinoresinol) were 
detected as the main compounds in extra virgin olive oils by high-performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). 
Spectrophotometric indices, radical scavenging activity, and oxidative stability 
of extra virgin olive oil samples obtained from olives hand-picked at different 
ripening degrees were statistically correlated with the CZE and HPLC 
quantification. The concentration of phenols in extra virgin olive oil decreased 
with ripeness of olive fruits. The high correlations found between CZE and the 
other analytical results indicate that CE can be applied as a rapid and reliable 
tool to routinely determine phenolic compounds in extra virgin olive oils.

The red grape constituent resveratrol possesses cancer chemopreventive 
properties in rodents. The hypothesis was tested that, in healthy humans, p.o. 
administration of resveratrol is safe and results in measurable plasma levels of 
resveratrol. A phase I study of oral resveratrol (single doses of 0.5, 1, 2.5, 
or 5 g) was conducted in 10 healthy volunteers per dose level. Resveratrol and 
its metabolites were identified in plasma and urine by high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and quantitated by high-performance 
liquid chromatography-UV. Consumption of resveratrol did not cause serious 
adverse events. Resveratrol and six metabolites were recovered from plasma and 
urine. Peak plasma levels of resveratrol at the highest dose were 539 +/- 384 
ng/mL (2.4 micromol/L, mean +/- SD; n = 10), which occurred 1.5 h post-dose. 
Peak levels of two monoglucuronides and resveratrol-3-sulfate were 3- to 8-fold 
higher. The area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) values for 
resveratrol-3-sulfate and resveratrol monoglucuronides were up to 23 times 
greater than those of resveratrol. Urinary excretion of resveratrol and its 
metabolites was rapid, with 77% of all urinary agent-derived species excreted 
within 4 h after the lowest dose. Cancer chemopreventive effects of resveratrol 
in cells in vitro require levels of at least 5 micromol/L. The results presented 
here intimate that consumption of high-dose resveratrol might be insufficient to 
elicit systemic levels commensurate with cancer chemopreventive efficacy. 
However, the high systemic levels of resveratrol conjugate metabolites suggest 
that their cancer chemopreventive properties warrant investigation.

The fate of anthocyanins and ellagitannins in rats was monitored following 
ingestion of raspberry juice. After 1 h low nM concentrations of unmetabolised 
anthocyanins were present in plasma but these declined by 2 h and after 4 h they 
were no longer detectable. For the first 2 h there was an almost full recovery 
of anthocyanins as they passed from the stomach through the duodenum/jejunum and 
into the ileum. After 3 h less than 50% were recovered, and the levels declined 
rapidly thereafter. Excretion of raspberry anthocyanins in urine over a 24 h 
period was equivalent to 1.2% of the amount ingested. Trace quantities of 
anthocyanins were detected in the caecum, colon and faeces and they were absent 
in extracts of liver, kidneys and brain. Urine also contained a number of 
phenolic acids but most were present in quantities well in excess of the 918 
nmol of anthocyanins present in the ingested juice. These findings indicate that 
raspberry anthocyanins per se are poorly absorbed, probably prior to reaching 
the ileum, and that substantial amounts pass from the small to the large 
intestine where they are degraded by colonic bacteria. Ellagitannins disappeared 
in the stomach without accumulation of ellagic acid.

A healthy diet involves eating fruit and vegetables on a daily basis, the 
benefits of which are in part linked to the ingestion of bioactive compounds 
including polyphenols. As a convenient means of delivering additional 
polyphenols to the diet, a polyphenol-rich (P-R) juice drink was prepared and 
the bioavailability of its diverse spectrum of constituents investigated. Ten 
human volunteers followed a low-flavonoid diet for 2 days before drinking 350 mL 
of the P-R beverage. Plasma and urine were collected for 24 h and analyzed by 
HPLC-PDA-MS. The plasma pharmacokinetics and recoveries of urinary metabolites 
of flavan-3-ols, flavanones, dihydrochalcones and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, both 
in terms of their identity and quantity, were, in most instances, not markedly 
different to those reported in other feeding studies with green tea, orange 
juice, apple cider and coffee. This indicates that the combination of 
polyphenolic compounds in the P-R beverage are absorbed and excreted to a 
similar extent whether fed individually or together in a single beverage. It is 
concluded that the P-R beverage can deliver the intended blend of bioavailable 
polyphenols, which would normally require consumption of several different 
plant-derived foods.

Three seeds of Turkish origin, flax, poppy and safflower were analyzed for their 
proximate, fatty acids, tocols (tocopherols and tocotrienols) and total phenolic 
composition, and oxidative stability of their oil. The major fatty acid in the 
flax oil was alpha-linolenic acid, comprising 58.3% of total fatty acids, 
whereas poppy and safflower oils were rich in linoleic acid at 74.5% and 70.5% 
level, respectively. The amount of total tocols was 14.6 mg/100g flax, 
11.0mg/100g poppy and 12.1mg/100g safflower seed. Flax and poppy oil were rich 
in gamma-tocopherol as 79.4 mg/100g oil and 30.9 mg/100g oil, respectively, 
while alpha-tocopherol (44.1g/100g oil) was dominant in safflower oil. Only 
alpha- and gamma-tocotrienol were found in the oils. Oxidative stability of oils 
was measured at 110 degrees C at the rate of 20 L/h air flow rate, and poppy oil 
(5.56 h) was most stabile oil followed by safflower oil (2.87 h) and flax oil 
(1.57). There were no correlation between oxidative stability and unsaturation 
degree of fatty acids and tocol levels of the oils. All of the seeds 
investigated provide a healthy oil profile and may have potential as a source of 
specialty oils on a commercial scale.

Eight avenanthramides, amides of anthranilic acid (1) and 5-hydroxyanthranilic 
acid (2), respectively, and the four cinnamic acids p-coumaric (p), caffeic (c), 
ferulic (f), and sinapic (s) acid, were synthesized for identification in oat 
extracts and for structure-antioxidant activity studies. Three compounds (2p, 
2c, and 2f) were found in oat extracts. As assessed by the reactivity toward 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), all avenanthramides except 1p showed 
activity. Initially, the antioxidant activity of the avenanthramides decreased 
in a similar order as for the corresponding cinnamic acids, that is: sinapic > 
caffeic > ferulic > p-coumaric acid. The avenanthramides derived from 2 were 
usually slightly more active than those derived from 1. All avenanthramides 
inhibited azo-initiated peroxidation of linoleic acid. 1c and 1s were initially 
the most effective compounds. The relative order of antioxidant activities was 
slightly different for the DPPH and the linoleic acid assays run in methanol and 
chlorobenzene, respectively.

We have determined the absorption, conjugation and excretion of 
naringenin-7-O-rutinoside (narirutin) compared to the corresponding glucoside in 
an orange juice matrix in human subjects. Healthy volunteers (eight men and 
eight women), in a double blind, randomised, crossover study, consumed orange 
juice with (1) natural content of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside; (2) 
alpha-rhamnosidase-treated to yield naringenin-7-O-glucoside. Blood was sampled 
at twelve time points and three fractions of urine were collected over 24 h. The 
area under the plasma-time curve of naringenin from (2) 
alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice was increased about 4-fold (P < 0.0001), 
peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 5.4-fold higher (P < 0.0001) and Tmax was 
decreased from 311 to 92 min (P = 0.002) compared to untreated orange juice (1), 
indicating a change in absorption site from the colon to the small intestine. 
Furthermore, the amount in urine was increased from 7 to 47 % (P < 0.0001) of 
the dose after consumption of the alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice (2). 
All urine samples contained both naringenin-7- and -4'-O-glucuronides. In 
addition, to examine the effect of dose and alpha-rhamnosidase treatment on 
hesperetin conjugate profiles, a further treatment where (3) orange juice 
fortified with three times the original content of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside was 
used. Five hesperetin metabolites (3'-O-glucuronide; 7-O-glucuronide; 
5,7-O-diglucuronide; 3',7-O-diglucuronide; 3'-O-sulphate) were present after all 
treatments (1-3), with the same profile of the conjugates. The present data show 
that bioavailability of naringenin is increased by conversion from rutinoside to 
glucoside, but the profile of the conjugates of flavanones formed and excreted 
in urine is neither affected by the absorption site nor by a 3-fold change in 
dose.

Extraction methods to determine olive oil phenols are not exhaustive. A 
procedure to test their effectiveness, based on the treatment of the extracted 
oil with 2 N HCl followed by analysis of phenols in the aqueous phase, has been 
developed. It was concluded, using this test, that 15-40% of phenols remained 
unextracted when the liquid/liquid extraction method with 80% methanol was 
applied. Solid phase extraction (C(18) cartridge) succeeded in retaining most of 
the phenols in the cartridge, but the recovery yield from the sorbent material 
was low. However, a new extraction method, based on the use of 
N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as an extraction solvent, achieved a complete 
extraction of phenols from oils. The proposed method requires a lower amount of 
oil, solvents, energy, and labor than the traditional ones. Because of the low 
concentration of phenols in the DMF extract, the highly sensitive 
electrochemical detector (EC) technique was studied. All of the phenols detected 
by the traditional UV detectors were also detected by EC using a coulometric 
array system. A rapid and complete analytical methodology of phenols in olive 
oil has been proposed based on coupling DMF extraction and EC detection.

Oranges are rich sources of flavonoids that are bioactive and may protect 
against age-related diseases. The absorption of orange flavanones may be 
affected by factors such as processing and subject anthropometric variables, and 
the bioactivity of the absorbed phytochemicals depends on how they are 
metabolised during absorption. In a randomised cross-over study, twenty subjects 
consumed a single portion of orange fruit (150 g) or juice (300 g) that 
contained the flavanones narirutin and hesperidin, and an additional 109 
subjects across a broad age range (18-80 years) consumed the juice. Flavanone 
metabolites were measured in regularly collected samples of plasma and urine. 
After consumption of fruit or juice, flavanone conjugates, but not the 
aglycones, were detected in plasma and urine. The flavanone conjugates were 
shown to include the 7- and 4'-O-monoglucuronides of naringenin, the 7- and 
3'-O-monoglucuronides of hesperetin, two hesperetin diglucuronides and a 
hesperetin sulfo-glucuronide, but no aglycones or rutinosides. Analysis of the 
plasma pharmacokinetic and urinary excretion data on a dose-adjusted basis 
indicated no difference in absorption or excretion of either flavanone between 
the fruit and juice matrices. In the extended urinary excretion dataset the 
individual variation was very large (range 0-59 % urinary yield). There was a 
small but significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the excretion of hesperetin (but 
not naringenin) with increasing age (P < 0.05), but the effects of sex, BMI and 
contraceptive pill use were shown not to be associated with the variation in 
flavanone excretion.

Green tea seems to have a positive impact on health due to the catechins-found 
as flavanols. Thus, the present study was aimed to develop a low cost reversed 
phase high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for simultaneous 
determination of flavanol contents, namely catechin (C), epicatechin (EC), 
epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin 3-gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin 
3-gallate (EGCG) and caffeine in 29 commercial green tea samples available in a 
Saudi Arabian local market. A C-18 reversed-phase column, 
acetonitrile-trifluoroacetic acid as a mobile phase, coupled with UV detector at 
205 nm, was successfully used for precise analysis of the tested analytes in 
boiled water of digested tea leaves. The average values of N (No. of theoretical 
plates), HETP (height equivalent of theoretical plates) and R(s) (separation 
factor) (at 10 μg ml(-1) of the catechins EC, EGC, EGCG and ECG) were 
2.6×10(3)±1.2×10(3), 1.7×10(-3)±4.7×10(-4) cm and 1.7±5.53×10(-2), respectively. 
The developed HPLC method demonstrated excellent performance, with low limits of 
detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of the tested catechins of 0.004-0.05 
μg ml(-1) and 0.01-0.17 μg ml(-1), respectively, and recovery percentages of 
96-101%. The influence of infusion time (5-30 min) and temperature on the 
content of the flavanols was investigated by HPLC. After a 5 min infusion of the 
tea leaves, the average concentrations of caffeine, catechin, EC, EGC, ECG and 
EGCG were found to be in the ranges 0.086-2.23, 0.113-2.94, 0.58-10.22, 
0.19-24.9, 0.22-13.9 and 1.01-43.3 mg g(-1), respectively. The contents of 
caffeine and catechins followed the sequence: EGCG>EGC>ECG>EC>C>caffeine. The 
method was applied satisfactorily for the analysis of (+)-catechin, even at 
trace and ultra trace concentrations of catechins. The method was rapid, 
accurate, reproducible and ideal for routine analysis.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data showed that tomato and tomato product (sauce, 
paste) consumption is associated with a protective effect against the 
development of some chronic-degenerative diseases. Tomato antioxidant bioactive 
molecules such as carotenoids and polyphenols could be responsible, at least in 
part, for the healthy effect observed. The bioavailability of these compounds is 
an essential requirement to sustain their in vivo role. While it is well known 
that many factors can influence the bioaccessibility of carotenoids from the 
food matrix, there is little information about the factors affecting phenolic 
compounds' bioaccessibility.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This investigation was carried out to evaluate the effect of 
domestic cooking on the bioavailability in humans of antioxidant molecules after 
the administration of a test meal containing cherry tomatoes.
METHODS: A cross-over design was conducted. Subjects (3 females and 2 males) 
consumed experimental meals containing fresh and cooked cherry tomatoes. Blood 
collection was performed at different time intervals (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h).
RESULTS: Carotenoid and phenol plasma concentrations were measured. Plasma 
levels of lycopene and beta-carotene were not significantly different with 
respect to the baseline after ingestion of both the test meals, while plasma 
concentrations of naringenin and chlorogenic acid increased significantly with 
respect to the baseline (P<0.05) after administration of cooked cherry tomatoes, 
but not after administration of fresh cherry tomatoes.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated that domestically cooked tomatoes 
significantly increase naringenin and chlorogenic acid plasma levels. 
Considering that both naringenin and chlorogenic acid are widely studied for 
their potential healthy properties, evidence of their bioavailability and of the 
factors influencing their bioaccessibility is an important tool to sustain the 
possibility that these polyphenols play a biological role in human physiology.

The carotenoid and phenolic acid contents in fresh, stored and processed 
(blanched, frozen and boiled) spinach were comparatively determined by 
spectrophotometric and HPLC analyses. The major carotenoids identified after 
HPLC analysis in saponified samples were lutein (37-53μg/kg), β-carotene 
(18-31μg/kg), violaxanthin (9-23μg/kg) and neoxanthin (10-22μg/kg). These 
carotenoids were all affected by storage and/or heating. The content of 
carotenoids was best preserved after storage for one day at 4°C. The total 
phenolic content in the fresh spinach was 2088mg GAE/kg FW. After LC-MS analysis 
three phenolic acids were identified and quantified. These being ortho-coumaric 
acid (28-60mg/kg FW), ferulic acid (10-35mg/kg) and para-coumaric acid 
(1-30mg/kg) depending on the sample type. After storage of spinach at different 
temperatures (4°C or -18°C) the amount of total phenolic compounds decreased by 
around 20%, while the amount of individual phenolic acids increased by four 
times on average.

Quantification of free and protein-bound trans-resveratrol metabolites and 
identification of trans-resveratrol-C/O-conjugated diglucuronides - two novel 
resveratrol metabolites in human plasma.

The polyphenol trans-resveratrol (t-RES) is present as 
t-RES-3-O-beta-D-glycoside, termed piceid, in several plant-derived foods. 
Although data on the metabolism and on in vivo effects of t-RES have been 
reported, quantitative data on the metabolites formed after dietary intake of 
t-RES or piceid are still lacking. In this study, 85.5 mg of piceid per 70 kg of 
body weight (bw) were administered to healthy volunteers in a bolus dose. t-RES 
metabolites formed in plasma and urine were identified and quantified by 
LC-MS/MS, NMR, and HPLC-DAD analysis using chemically synthesized t-RES 
conjugate standards. In addition, the amount of t-RES metabolites bound 
noncovalently to plasma proteins was determined for the first time in humans. 
The metabolites identified and quantified were t-RES-3-sulfate, 
t-RES-3,4'-disulfate, t-RES-3,5-disulfate, t-RES-3-glucuronide and 
t-RES-4'-glucuronide, with t-RES-sulfates being the dominant conjugates in 
plasma and urine. Besides these metabolites, two novel t-RES-C/O-conjugated 
diglucuronides have been identified and quantified in plasma and urine. 
Moreover, it could be shown that up to 50% of the plasma t-RES-3-sulfate, 
t-RES-disulfates, and the novel t-RES-C/O-diglucuronides were bound to proteins. 
Total recovery of the dietary administered piceid in urine ranged between 13.6 
and 35.7%.

The relationship among antioxidant activity, based on the electron-spin 
resonance determination of the reduction of Fremy's radical, vasodilation 
activity, and phenolic content was investigated in 16 red wines. The wines were 
selected to provide a range of origins, grape varieties, and vinification 
methods. Sensitive and selective HPLC methods were used for the analysis of the 
major phenolics in red wine: free and conjugated myricetin, quercetin, 
kaempferol, and isorhamnetin; (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, gallic acid, 
p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, caftaric acid, trans-resveratrol, 
cis-resveratrol, and trans-resveratrol glucoside. Total anthocyanins were 
measured using a colorimetric assay. The total phenolic content of the wines was 
determined according to the Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric assay and also by the 
cumulative measurements obtained by HPLC. The 16 wines exhibited a wide range in 
the values of all parameters investigated. However, the total phenol contents, 
measured both by HPLC and colorimetrically, correlated very strongly with the 
antioxidant activity and vasodilation activity. In addition, the antioxidant 
activity was associated with gallic acid, total resveratrol, and total catechin. 
In contrast, only the total anthocyanins were correlated with vasodilation 
activity. The results demonstrate that the different phenolic profiles of wines 
can produce varying antioxidant and vasodilatant activities, which opens up the 
possibility that some red wines may provide enhanced health benefits for the 
consumer.

Resveratrol and the biosynthetically related stilbenes are plant secondary 
metabolites with diverse pharmacological effects. The versatile functions of 
these compounds in plant defense mechanisms as phytoalexins on one hand, and in 
human health as potential pharmaceutical agents on the other, have attracted 
lots of interest in recent years to understand their biosynthetic pathways and 
their biological properties. Because of difficulties in obtaining resveratrol 
and its glucosylated derivatives as well as oligomeric forms in sufficient 
amounts for evaluation of their activity by plant sourcing or total synthesis, 
biotechnology may provide a competitive approach for the large-scale and low 
cost production of biologically active stilbenes. Additionally, one major 
limitation in the use of resveratrol and related aglycone derivatives as 
therapeutic agents is associated with their inherent poor aqueous solubility and 
low bioavailability. This article examines approaches for the synthesis of 
potential pharmacologically resveratrol derivatives in vivo by exploiting whole 
microorganisms, enzymatic and biocatalytic approaches allowing their full 
utilization for medicine, food and cosmetic applications. These methods also 
have the advantage of enabling the one-step production of stilbene compounds, 
compared to the time-consuming and environmentally unfriendly procedures used 
for their total synthesis or their extraction from plants. Increasing the 
desired products yield and biological activity through glucosylation 
(β-D-glucosides versus α-D-glucosides) and oligomerization methodologies of 
resveratrol including green chemistry methods in organic solvent-free media are 
discussed as well.

Institute of Crop and Food Science, Rural Development Administration Wanju-gun 
Republic of Korea.

This study evaluated the diversity of 68 faba bean accessions grown in the 
Republic of Korea, focusing on variations in antinutrient factors, nutritional 
composition, fatty acids, lipid quality, antioxidant activity, and key 
agronomical traits. All parameters showed significant variations, indicating 
broad genetic diversity. Vicine and convicine were detected in all accessions 
using UHPLC-MS/MS, with their concentrations varying more than threefold. Total 
phenol (1.65-4.38 mg GAE/g), saponin (4.12-9.50 mg DE/g), and tannin 
(1.70-9.47 mg CE/g) contents showed coefficients of variation (CV) above 18.00%. 
Similarly, crude fiber (3.42%-10.85%), dietary fiber (9.18%-25.47%), total 
protein (21.68%-34.40%), and total fat (0.90%-1.99%) contents exhibited wide 
variations (CV > 9.50%). Palmitic acid (15.13%-18.73%) and linoleic acid 
(38.51%-54.93%) were the dominant saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, 
respectively. Antioxidant activities, including DPPH• scavenging activity 
(0.40-2.33 mg AAE/g), ABTS•+ scavenging activity (1.87-7.26 mg TE/g), and ferric 
reducing antioxidant power (0.67-4.94 mg AAE/g) varied significantly, all with 
CVs over 25.00%. Green genotypes exhibited significantly higher tannin, fibers, 
and palmitic and total saturated fatty acids, while yellow genotypes showed 
higher antioxidant activities, total unsaturated fatty acids, and lipid quality 
indices. Cluster and principal component analyses differentiated accessions 
based on their overall biochemical profile. Accession VF050 was identified for 
its low antinutrient content, VF012 and VF004 for distinct antioxidant 
potential, VF062, VF027, and VF012 for lipid quality, VF032, VF009, and VF018 
for high fiber, VF041 and VF057 for high protein, and VF019 and VF027 for 
agronomic performance. These accessions could serve as valuable materials for 
food innovation, crop improvement, and cultivation.

This study explored plasma levels and urinary and fecal excretion of metabolites 
and microbial-derived catabolites over a 24 h period following the ingestion of 
red wine (RWP) or grape seed (GSP) proanthocyanidin-rich extracts by rats. In 
total, 35 structurally-related (epi)catechin metabolites (SREMs) and 5-carbon 
side chain ring fission metabolites (5C-RFMs) (phenyl-γ-valerolactones and 
phenylvaleric acids), and 50 phenolic acid and aromatic catabolites were 
detected after intakes of both extracts. The consumption of the RWP extract, but 
not the GSP extract, led to the appearance of a ∼200 nmol L-1 peak plasma 
concentration of SREMs formed from flavan-3-ol monomers. In contrast, ingestion 
of the GSPs, but not the RWPs, resulted in a substantial increase in 
microbiota-derived 5-carbon side chain ring fission metabolites (5C-RFMs) in 
plasma. 5C-RFMs, along with low molecular weight phenolic catabolites were 
detected in urine after ingestion of both extracts. The GSP and RWP extracts had 
respective mean degrees of polymerisation 5.9 and 6.5 subunits, and the RWP 
extract had an upper polymer size of 21 subunits compared to 44 subunits for the 
GSP extract. The differences in plasma metabolite profiles might, therefore, be 
a consequence of this polydispersity impacting on the microbiota-mediated rates 
of cleavage of the proanthocyanidin subunits and their subsequent metabolism and 
absorption. Urinary excretion of phenolic catabolites indicated that 11% of RWPs 
and 7% for GSPs were subjected to microbial degradation. In all probability 
these figures, rather than representing the percentage of proanthocyanidins that 
are completely degraded, indicate partial cleavage of monomer subunits producing 
a much higher percentage of shortened proanthocyanidin chains. Obtaining more 
detailed information on the in vivo fate of proanthocyanidins is challenging 
because of the difficulties in analysing unabsorbed parent proanthocyanidins and 
their partially degraded flavan-3-ol subunit chains in feces. Further progress 
awaits the development of improved purification and analytical techniques for 
proanthocyanidins and their use in feeding studies, and in vitro fecal and 
bacterial incubations, with radio and/or stable isotope-labelled substrates.

and tricin, flavones with putative cancer chemopreventive properties.

Molecular Medicine, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.

PURPOSE: The flavones apigenin and tricin, which occur in leafy vegetables and 
rice bran, respectively, possess cancer chemopreventive properties in 
preclinical rodent models. Their pharmacology is only poorly understood. We 
compared their tissue levels in mice in vivo and their metabolism in liver 
fractions in vitro.
METHODS: Mice received apigenin or tricin (0.2%) with their diet for 5-7 days, 
and flavone levels were compared in the plasma, liver and gastrointestinal 
mucosa using HPLC-UV. Flavone metabolism was investigated in murine and human 
liver microsomes or cytosol in vitro co-incubated with uridine 
5'-diphosphoglucuronic acid or 3'-phosphoadenosine-5' phosphosulfate. Flavone 
metabolites were characterized by on-line HPLC-mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: After dietary administration of flavones for 7 days, levels of tricin 
in plasma, liver and mucosa exceeded those of apigenin by 350, 33 and 100%, 
respectively. Apigenin was more rapidly glucuronidated than tricin in liver 
microsomes, whilst tricin underwent swifter sulfonation than apigenin in liver 
cytosol. For either flavone the rate of glucuronidation was much faster than 
that of sulfonation. Flavone monoglucuronides and monosulfates were identified 
as metabolites in microsomal and cytosolic incubations, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: When consumed with the diet in mice tricin seems to be more 
available than apigenin in blood and tissues. Differences in their 
glucuronidation may account for their differential availability. Thus tricin may 
have a pharmacokinetic advantage over apigenin. This type of information may 
help decide which flavonoids to select for clinical development.

Although lettuce may provide relatively low levels of antioxidative 
phytochemicals which may contribute to human health, lettuce leaf extracts in 
fact contained compounds with high specific peroxyl radical scavenging 
activities. After determining the extraction conditions that minimized phenolic 
oxidation and produced the highest oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) 
values, the phenolic compounds from red leaf lettuce were separated by 
reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The primary 
phenolic compounds in the leaf tissue extracts were mono- and dicaffeoyltartaric 
acid (CTA and DCTA), mono- and dicaffeoylquinic acid (CQA and DCQA), quercetin 
3-malonylglucoside (QMG), quercetin 3-glucoside (QG), cyanidin 
3-malonylglucoside (CMG), and an unknown phenolic ester (UPE). Significant 
levels of DCQA were only found after wounding. Using the new fluorescein-based 
ORAC assay procedures, fractions from the HPLC analyses were assayed for peroxyl 
radical absorbance capacity. Using absorbance to estimate concentration, the 
decreasing order of contribution to the total ORAC value of an extract from 
wounded tissue was QMG > DCQA > CMG > DCTA > UPE > QG > CTA. The decreasing 
order of the specific peroxyl radical scavenging activities was CMG > QG > DCTA 
> DCQA > QMG > UPE > CQA > CTA. Since the concentrations of plant flavonoid and 
phenolic acid esters are sensitive to environmental factors, this information 
may be used to develop pre- and postharvest conditions which increase the 
dietary benefits of leaf lettuce.

Anthocyanins are absorbed in glycated forms in elderly women: a pharmacokinetic 
study.

Aging at Tufts University, Boston, MA, USA.

BACKGROUND: Anthocyanins are potent antioxidants that are widely distributed in 
fruit, vegetables, and red wines. Anthocyanin products are also prescribed as 
medicines in many countries for treating various diseases. However, the 
pharmacokinetics of dietary anthocyanins are not known in humans because these 
glycosides were long considered nonabsorbable.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether anthocyanins can 
be absorbed as glycosides and to evaluate their pharmacokinetics in humans.
DESIGN: Four healthy elderly women consumed 720 mg anthocyanins. A series of 
blood and urine samples were collected before and after consumption of the 
anthocyanins. Anthocyanins were measured in plasma and urine by combining an 
octadecylsilane solid-phase extraction for sample preparation and an HPLC system 
with diode array for anthocyanin separation and detection. The structures of 
anthocyanins as glycosides in plasma and urine were further confirmed by using 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Anthocyanins were detected as glycosides in plasma and urine. The 
maximum plasma concentration of total anthocyanins varied from 55.3 to 168.3 
nmol/L, with an average of 97.4 nmol/L, and was reached within 71.3 min. The 
elimination of plasma anthocyanins appeared to follow first-order kinetics. The 
elimination half-life of plasma total anthocyanins was calculated to be 132.6 
min. Most anthocyanin compounds were excreted in urine during the first 4 h. The 
excretion rate of total anthocyanins was 77 microg/h during the first 4 h and 13 
microg/h during the second 4 h.
CONCLUSION: Anthocyanins are absorbed in their unchanged glycated forms in 
elderly women.

French wines are abundant sources of phenolic compounds. The content of several 
catechins, i.e., (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4, 
trimers C1, and trimer 2 (T2), of 160 French wines was determined by HPLC with 
UV detection. Red wines (n = 95) were found to have high levels of catechins, 
ranging from 32.8 to 209.8 mg/L (mean concentration 114.5 mg/L) for 
(+)-catechin, from 22.1 to 130.7 mg/L (mean concentration 75.7 mg/L) for 
(-)-epicatechin, from 7.8 to 39.1 mg/L (mean concentration 25.4 mg/L) for B1, 
from 18.3 to 93 mg/L (mean concentration 47.4 mg/L) for B2, from 21.4 to 215.6 
mg/L (mean concentration 119.6 mg/L) for B3, from 20.2 to 107.2 mg/L (mean 
concentration 81.9 mg/l) for B4, from 8.6 to 36.9 mg/L (mean concentration 26.3 
mg/L) for C1, and from 26.7 to 79.3 mg/L (mean concentration 67.1 mg/L) for T2. 
White and rosé wines (n = 57 and n = 8) were found to have low levels of 
(+)-catechin (mean concentrations 9.8 and 10.6 mg/L, respectively) and 
(-)-epicatechin (mean concentrations 5.3 and 6.5 mg/L, respectively). These data 
provide a basis for the epidemiological evaluation of catechin intake by the 
consumption of French wine.

A capillary zone electrophoresis method has been carried out to determine and 
quantitate some compounds of the polyphenolic fraction of virgin olive oil which 
have never previously been determined before using capillary electrophoresis, 
such as elenolic acid, ligstroside aglycon, oleuropein aglycon, and 
(+)-pinoresinol. The compounds were identified using standards obtained by 
semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A detailed method 
optimization was performed to separate the phenolic compounds present in olive 
oil using a methanol-water extract of Picual extra-virgin olive oil, and 
different extraction systems were compared (C18-solid phase extraction (SPE), 
Diol-SPE, Sax-SPE and liquid-liquid extraction). The optimized parameters were 
30 mM sodium tetraborate buffer (pH 9.3) at 25 kV with 8 s hydrodynamic 
injection, and the quantitation was carried out by the use of two reference 
compounds at two different wavelengths.

Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is one of the most important legume crops for 
human consumption because of its nearly perfect nutritional composition. 
However, the crop yield is invariably constrained by phosphorus (P) stress 
across all farming systems. The present study aimed to unravel the mechanistic 
basis of common bean response to P stress at the early vegetative phase using an 
integrated multi-omic approach. In vitro experiments were carried out with P 
sufficient (P+) and total P deficient (P-) treatments using common bean SFB-1 
seed cultivar. The plants were grown in MGRL media for a duration of three 
weeks. Various morphological traits were significantly reduced under P- stress 
conditions. There was a significant decrease in the levels of biochemical 
parameters such as free amino acids, secondary metabolites, and osmolytes 
(proline, total soluble sugars, and glycine betaine) under P- growth conditions. 
Additionally, photosynthetic pigments (such as chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, 
total chlorophyll, and total carotenoids), physiological parameters (such as 
relative water content and stress injury), as well as both enzymatic and 
non-enzymatic antioxidants (including catalase, peroxidase, superoxide 
dismutase, total phenolics, and flavonoids), were also significantly reduced. 
Proteomic analysis identified two key proteins, homocysteine methyltransferase 
and DDB1-CUL4 associated factor 1-like protein, which are involved in various 
stress adaptation pathways. Furthermore, techniques such as FTIR spectroscopy, 
SEM, SEM-EDX, and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy were used to validate the 
metabolic changes induced by phosphorus deficiency. Phosphorus deficiency led to 
profound metabolic changes affecting photosynthesis, defense-related protein 
expression, cell wall composition, secondary metabolite production, levels of 
phytohormone precursors, free amino acids, antioxidant activity, and osmolyte 
accumulation, all of which contributed to inhibited plant growth and 
development.

The capabilities of spectrophotometric and electrochemical detection techniques 
were investigated for the high-performance liquid chromatographic determination 
of flavonoids. Liquid chromatographic analyses were performed on eleven 
compounds belonging to three different classes of flavonoids: flavanone 
glycosides, flavone and flavonol aglycones. Separation of all compounds examined 
was carried out under reversed-phase conditions on a C18 narrow-bore column for 
UV detection, whereas for electrochemical detection, a C18 standard-bore column 
was used. UV analyses were carried out at 280 nm for flavanones and at 265 nm 
for flavones and flavonols, whereas controlled-potential coulometric 
measurements were performed using a porous graphite electrode. Analytical 
performances of the methods were compared in terms of linearity, limits of 
detection (LODs) and precision. Linearity over two orders of magnitude and LODs 
at low-ppm levels (0.06-1 mg/l) were demonstrated for all techniques considered. 
Instrumental precision in terms of relative standard deviation was found to be 
between 0 and 5% for the liquid chromatography (LC)-UV system and between 0.6 
and 10% for the LC-electrochemical detection (ED) system. The methods developed 
were applied to the analysis of flavanones and flavonols in a real sample, such 
as an extract of orange juice. Even though quercetin glycoside is mostly present 
in orange juice as rutin, other different glycosides of this flavonol could be 
present; on this basis, the hydrolysis of all glycosides to aglycone allows one 
to obtain more accurate data on the flavonol concentration in orange juice. To 
avoid sample degradation and to increase extraction efficiency, quercetin 
hydrolysis was optimized using a central composite design to investigate the 
effects of acid concentration and hydrolysis time on extraction recovery.

The present study aims first to compare the antioxidant microconstituent 
contents between organically and conventionally grown tomatoes and, second, to 
evaluate whether the consumption of purees made of these tomatoes can 
differently affect the plasma levels of antioxidant microconstituents in humans. 
When results were expressed as fresh matter, organic tomatoes had higher vitamin 
C, carotenoids, and polyphenol contents (except for chlorogenic acid) than 
conventional tomatoes. When results were expressed as dry matter, no significant 
difference was found for lycopene and naringenin. In tomato purees, no 
difference in carotenoid content was found between the two modes of culture, 
whereas the concentrations of vitamin C and polyphenols remained higher in 
purees made out of organic tomatoes. For the nutritional intervention, no 
significant difference (after 3 weeks of consumption of 96 g/day of tomato 
puree) was found between the two purees with regard to their ability to affect 
the plasma levels of the two major antioxidants, vitamin C and lycopene.

High-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) coupled 
with electronspray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to detect the flavonoid 
profile in lemon juices obtained from the main Sicilian cultivars (Femminello 
comune, Monachello, and Interdonato). Significant amounts of an unusual 
constituent were found in the lemon juice of the above-mentioned cultivars 
together with eriocitrin, hesperidin, and diosmin. Following purification by 
preparative HPLC, the structure was assigned as 6,8-di-C-glucopyranosyldiosmetin 
by means of DAD-UV, ESI-MS-MS, and (1)H NMR analysis. Three other minor 
components were also detected. One of these presented a flavone nature, and 
spectral data and literature references both suggested a 
6,8-di-C-glucopyranosylapigenin structure. The different contents of eriocitrin, 
hesperidin, diosmin, and above minor components in the cultivars allow juices to 
be readily differentiated.

Anthocyanin excretion by humans increases linearly with increasing strawberry 
dose.

Center, Agricultural Research Service, USDA, Beltsville, MD 20705, USA.

A clinical study was conducted to investigate the dose response and metabolism 
of strawberry anthocyanins. In a crossover study design, 12 healthy adults 
consumed each of 3 strawberry treatments. The treatments were 100 g, 200 g, and 
400 g of pureed strawberries, delivering 15 micromol, 30 micromol, and 60 
micromol anthocyanin, respectively. Urine samples were collected for 24 h after 
each dose and samples were analyzed by HPLC with diode array detection and ion 
trap MS. Pelargonidin 3-glucoside was the major anthocyanin form in the 
treatments, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside and 3 metabolites of pelargonidin 
3-glucoside (detected as monoglucuronides) were excreted in urine after 
ingestion. One predominant monoglucuronide form was detected in urine in masses 
10-fold higher than the other 2 monoglucuronide forms. Increasing dose resulted 
in increasing appearance of anthocyanins in urine, and the mass of each 
pelargonidin monoglucuronide increased in urine with increasing dose. These 
results suggest that pelargonidin 3-glucoside absorption and metabolism are not 
saturated at masses < or = 60 micromol, thus showing that more strawberry 
anthocyanin can be absorbed with increasing dose.

In this study the main chemical parameters, ascorbic acid and polyphenol 
content, and antioxidant activity of two varieties of prunes, dried by 
high-temperature (85 + 70 degrees C) and low-temperature (60 degrees C) 
procedures, were monitored during storage. Ascorbic acid content was higher in 
the prunes dried at 60 degrees C but significantly decreased in both varieties 
during storage. The different classes of polyphenols analyzed (cinnamates, 
anthocyanins, flavonols) showed different stabilities during storage. 
Neochlorogenic acid decreased only in the President variety, whereas chlorogenic 
acid increased in both varieties; anthocyanins, present only in the President 
prunes, disappeared in the first months of storage, and the flavonol content 
fell significantly in both cultivars during the year of the study. Drying 
temperature significantly affected the polyphenol content, with different 
effects according to the class of polyphenols. Antioxidant activity showed a 
significant increase at the end of the storage period and in the President 
variety was higher in the sample dried at the higher temperature.

A sensitive, rapid, efficient, and reliable method for the separation and 
determination of phenolic acids by capillary zone electrophoresis has been 
carried out. A detailed method optimization was carried out to separate 14 
different compounds by studying parameters such as pH, type and concentration of 
buffer, applied voltage, and injection time. The separation was performed within 
16 min, using a 25 mM sodium borate buffer (pH 9.6) at 25 kV with 8 s of 
hydrodynamic injection. With this method and using a liquid-liquid extraction 
system, with recovery values around 95%, it has been possible to detect small 
quantities of phenolic acids in olive oil samples. This is apparently the first 
paper showing the quantification of this specific family of phenolic compounds 
in virgin olive oil samples.

Fourteen phenolic acids have been selectively determined in olive-oil samples 
using the co-electrosmotic capillary electrophoresis mode with UV detection 
after the LLE extraction system. A polycationic surfactant (hexadimetrine 
bromide, HDB), which dynamically coats the inner surface of the capillary and 
causes a fast anodic electroosmotic flow, was added to the electrolyte. The main 
factors affecting co-electroosmotic flow (EOF) such as type of modifier, 
concentration, and influence of organic solvents have been studied. Other 
parameters such as pH, type, and concentration of buffer, applied voltage, and 
injection time were also optimised using hydrodynamic injection for 8 s and UV 
detection at 210 nm. The composition optimum of the running buffer used was a 
20% 2-propanol, 0.001% HDB, and 50 mM sodium borate at a pH value of 9.6. The 
method has been applied to determination and quantification of fourteen phenolic 
acids at ppb levels in olive oil samples after a liquid-liquid extraction.

A rapid and reliable capillary zone electrophoresis method was used as a tool to 
obtain both qualitative and quantitative information about simple phenols, 
lignans, complex phenols (isomeric forms of secoiridoids), phenolic acids, and 
flavonoids in the solid-phase separation extracts from different Spanish 
extra-virgin olive oil in a short time (less than 6 min). Peak identification 
was done by using commercial and HPLC-isolated standards, studying the 
information of the electropherograms obtained at several wavelengths and also 
using the information previously reported. For the quantification of lignans and 
complex phenols (secoiridoid derivatives), we used a reference compound 
(oleuropein glucoside) at two different wavelengths (200 and 240 nm) and for the 
quantification of tyrosol and flavonoids, we used their commercially available 
standards.

We have recently demonstrated, in humans, the bioavailability of hydroxytyrosol 
(3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol; HT), one of the major antioxidant components of 
virgin olive oil. In particular, we reported that this compound is present in 
lipoproteins involved in atherosclerotic processes and is excreted in the urine 
mainly as glucuronide-conjugate. The aim of the present study was to elucidate, 
in humans, the metabolic fate of HT after ingestion of virgin olive oil. After 
administration of virgin olive oil, 24-hour urine collections of healthy 
volunteers were prepared for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses in 
order to identify and quantify HT and its metabolites homovanillic alcohol 
(HVA1c) and homovanillic acid (HVA). The results indicate that this compound 
undergoes the action of catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), enzymes involved 
in the catecholamine catabolism, resulting in an enhanced excretion of HVA1c. We 
also found a significant increase of HVA, indicating an oxidation of the 
ethanolic residue of HT and/or of HVA1c in humans. The excretion of both 
metabolites significantly correlated with the dose of administered HT.

Evaluation of the bioavailability and metabolism in the rat of punicalagin, an 
antioxidant polyphenol from pomegranate juice.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Punicalagin is an antioxidant ellagitannin of pomegranate 
juice. This compound is responsible for the high antioxidant activity of this 
juice. Nothing is known about the bioavailability and metabolism of punicalagin 
or other food ellagitannins. The present work aims to evaluate the 
bioavailability and metabolism of punicalagin in the rat as an animal model.
DESIGN: Two groups of rats were studied. One fed with standard rat diet (n = 5) 
and another with the same diet plus 6 % punicalagin (n = 5). Samples of urine 
and faeces were taken during 37 days and plasma every week. The different 
metabolites were analysed by HPLC-MS-MS.
RESULTS: The daily intake of punicalagin ranged from 0.6 to 1.2 g. Values around 
3-6 % the ingested punicalagin were excreted as identified metabolites in faeces 
and urine. In faeces, punicalagin is transformed to hydrolysis products and 
partly metabolites by the rat microflora to 6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one 
derivatives. In plasma, punicalagin was detected at concentrations around 30 
microg/mL, and glucuronides of methyl ether derivatives of ellagic acid were 
also detected. 6H-Dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one derivatives were also detected 
especially during the last few weeks of the experiment. In urine, the main 
metabolites observed were the 6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one derivatives, as 
aglycones or glucuronides.
CONCLUSION: As only 3-6 % of the ingested punicalagin was detected as such or as 
metabolites in urine and faeces, the majority of this ellagitannin has to be 
converted to undetectable metabolites (i. e. CO(2)) or accumulated in 
non-analysed tissues, however with only traces of punicalagin metabolites being 
detected in liver or kidney. This is the first report on the absorption of an 
ellagitannin and its presence in plasma. In addition, the transformation of 
ellagic acid derivatives to 6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one derivatives in the rat is 
also confirmed.

Metabolism of antioxidant and chemopreventive ellagitannins from strawberries, 
raspberries, walnuts, and oak-aged wine in humans: identification of biomarkers 
and individual variability.

Ellagitannins (ETs) are dietary polyphenols, containing ellagic acid (EA) 
subunits, with antioxidant and cancer chemopreventive activities that might 
contribute to health benefits in humans. However, little is known about their 
metabolic fate. We investigate here the metabolism of different dietary ETs and 
EA derivatives in humans. Forty healthy volunteers were distributed in four 
groups. Each group consumed, in a single dose, a different ET-containing 
foodstuff, i.e., strawberries (250 g), red raspberries (225 g), walnuts (35 g), 
and oak-aged red wine (300 mL). After the intake, five urine fractions (F) were 
collected at 8 (F1), 16 (F2), 32 (F3), 40 (F4), and 56 (F5) h. Neither ETs nor 
EA were detected in urine after LC-MS/MS analysis. However, the microbial 
metabolite 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one (urolithin B) conjugated 
with glucuronic acid was detected along the fractions F3-F5 in all of the 
subjects, independently of the consumed foodstuff. The mean percentage of 
metabolite excretion ranged from 2.8 (strawberries) to 16.6% (walnuts) regarding 
the ingested ETs. Considerable interindividual differences were noted, 
identifying ""high and low metabolite excreters"" in each group, which supported 
the involvement of the colonic microflora in ET metabolism. These results 
indicate that urolithin B (a previously described antiangiogenic and 
hyaluronidase inhibitor compound) is a biomarker of human exposure to dietary 
ETs and may be useful in intervention studies with ET-containing products. The 
antioxidant and anticarcinogenic effects of dietary ETs and EA should be 
considered in the gastrointestinal tract whereas the study of potential systemic 
activities should be focused on the bioavailable urolithin B derivatives.

Stoichiometric and kinetic values of phenolics against DPPH 
(2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) were determined for Andean purple corn (Zea mays 
L.) and red sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas). Both crops had higher antioxidant 
capacity and antiradical kinetics than blueberries and higher or similar 
anthocyanin and phenolic contents. The second-order rate constant (k(2)) was 
1.56, 1.12, 0.57, and 0.26 (mg antiradical/mL)(-1) s(-1) for red sweetpotato, 
Trolox, purple corn, and blueberry, respectively. On the molar basis of active 
hydroxyl groups, k(2)' showed the same order as for k(2). Corn cob and 
sweetpotato endodermis contributed the most in phenolic compounds and 
antioxidant capacity. Both crops studied can be considered as excellent novel 
sources of natural antioxidants for the functional food and dietary supplement 
markets.

Nineteen phenolic compounds including hydroxybenzoic acids, hydroxycinnamic 
acids, flavonoids, phenolic alcohols, and phenolic aldehydes have been 
identified and quantified in two monovarietal champagnes, Chardonnay and Pinot 
Noir, by using a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
system coupled with diode array detection. The identification of four 
hydroxycinnamic tartaric esters (caftaric, coutaric, fertaric, and 
2-S-glutathionylcaftaric acids), two flavanonols (astilbin and engeletin), and 
some other compounds was confirmed by HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry. 
Caftaric acid and tyrosol were the major phenols. Hydroxybenzoic acids and 
flavonoids were present at low concentrations. The phenolic compositions of 2000 
and 2001 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir vary quantitatively according to the year and 
the variety, but the chemical natures of the molecules are the same. The total 
phenolic content determined by colorimetric measurement ranges from 176 to 195 
mg/L of gallic acid equivalent and is similar to that described in white wines.

The antioxidant potential of eight clingstone peach cultivars was investigated 
by determining phenolic compounds and inhibition of low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) oxidation. Cultivars low in polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were also selected to 
minimize enzymatic browning. Inhibition of LDL oxidation varied from 17.0 to 
37.1% in peach flesh extract, from 15.2 to 49.8% in whole peach extract, and 
from 18.2 to 48.1% in peel extract. Total phenols were 432.8-768.1 mg/kg in 
flesh extract, 483.3-803.0 mg/kg in whole extract, and 910.9-1922.9 mg/kg in 
peel extract. The correlation coefficient between relative LDL antioxidant 
activity and concentration of total phenols was 0.76. Peel PPO activity was 
higher than flesh activity in most cultivars. The lowest PPO and specific 
activities were found in the Walgant cultivar, followed by Kakamas and 18-8-23. 
These three cultivars combine the desirable characteristics of strong 
antioxidant activity, low PPO activity, and lower susceptibility to browning 
reactions.

Liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) 
with positive and negative ion detection was used for the identification of 
flavonoids in Hakmeitau beans, a black seed cultivar of cowpea (Vigna sinensis). 
Gradient elution with water and acetonitrile, both containing 2% formic acid, 
was employed in chromatographic separation. The peaks were identified by 
comparison of the retention times and the UV-vis spectroscopic and mass 
spectrometric data with authentic standards and/or literature data. The 
identified flavonoids included six anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-O-galactoside, 
cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, malvidin 3-O-glucoside, 
peonidin 3-O-glucoside, and petunidin 3-O-glucoside) and four flavonol/flavonol 
glycosides (kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, quercetin, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, and 
quercetin 3-O-6' '-acetylglucoside). The tentatively identified flavonoids 
included two anthocyanins (malvidin 3-O-acetylglucoside and peonidin 
3-O-malonylglucoside) and three flavonol glycosides (myricetin-3-O-glucoside, 
quercetin 7-O-glucoside, and quercetin-3-O-diglucoside). These flavonoids are 
present in seed coats, and the contents of anthocyanins and flavonol glycosides 
were 20.7 and 2.0 mg/g, respectively.

Nutritional compounds (phenolic compounds, L-ascorbic acid), antioxidant 
activities, and physicochemical characteristics (fruit weight, dry matter, 
soluble solids, pH, acidity, total and reducing sugars) of 33 different sour 
cherry cultivars were studied. Polyphenols were identified by LC-PDA-QTOF/MS and 
quantified by UPLC-PDA-FL. A total of 41 polyphenolic compounds found were 
identified and presented as 14 flavan-3-ols, 11 anthocyanins, 5 hydroxycinnamic 
acids, 10 flavonols, and 1 flavon. The content of total polyphenols (TPs) ranged 
from 2982.51 ('Wisok' cultivar) to 1539.43 mg/100 g dry weight ('Erdi 
Nagygyϋmϋscu'cultivar). Flavan-3-ols, the major class of sour cherry 
polyphenols, represented ∼ 40% of the TP compounds, whereas anthocyanins and 
hydroxycinnamic acids amounted for about 25% each. The content of l-ascorbic 
acid did not exceed 22.18 mg/100 g fresh matter. Some polish sour cherry 
cultivars (especially 'Agat', 'Ametyst', 'Wider', 'Winer', and 'Wisok') may be 
selected to promote the growth of cultivars with strong nutritional and 
phytochemical beneficial effects on human health.

and plant matrix.

Absorption of cyanidin-based anthocyanins is not fully understood with respect 
to dose or anthocyanin structure. In feeding studies using whole foods, 
nonacylated anthocyanins are more bioavailable than their acylated counterparts, 
but the extent to which plant matrix determines relative bioavailability of 
anthocyanins is unknown. Using juice of purple carrots to circumvent matrix 
effects, a feeding trial was conducted to determine relative bioavailability of 
acylated and nonacylated anthocyanins and to assess dose-response effects. 
Appearance of anthocyanins in plasma was measured in 10 healthy adults for 8 h 
following consumption of purple carrot juice. Each subject consumed 50, 150, and 
250 mL of juice containing 76 micromol (65 mg), 228 micromol (194 mg), and 380 
micromol (323 mg) of total anthocyanins, respectively. Acylated anthocyanins 
comprised 76% of total anthocyanins in the juice, yet their bioavailability was 
found to be significantly less than that of nonacylated anthocyanins. Peak 
plasma concentrations of nonacylated anthocyanins were 4-fold higher than that 
for acylated anthocyanins. Absorption efficiency declined across the doses 
administered. Because the treatments were consumed as juice, it could be 
discerned that the difference in bioavailability of acylated versus nonacylated 
anthocyanins was not primarily caused by interactions with the plant matrix.

Understanding how the environment and production and cultivation practices 
influence the composition and quality of food crops is fundamental to the 
production of high-quality nutritious foods. In this 3-year study, total 
phenolics, percent soluble solids, ascorbic acid, and the flavonoid aglycones 
quercetin, kaempferol, and luteolin were measured in two varieties of tomato 
(Lycopersicon esculentum L. cv. Ropreco and Burbank) and two varieties of bell 
peppers (Capsicum annuum L. cv. California Wonder and Excalibur) grown by 
certified organic and conventional practices in a model system. Significantly 
higher levels of percent soluble solids (17%), quercetin (30%), kaempferol 
(17%), and ascorbic acid (26%) were found in Burbank tomatoes (fresh weight 
basis; FWB), whereas only levels of percent soluble solids (10%) and kaempferol 
(20%) were significantly higher in organic Ropreco tomatoes (FWB). Year-to-year 
variability was significant, and high values from 2003 influenced the 3-year 
average value of quercetin reported for organic Burbank tomatoes. Burbank 
tomatoes generally had higher levels of quercetin, kaempferol, total phenolics, 
and ascorbic acid as compared to Ropreco tomatoes. Bell peppers were influenced 
less by environment and did not display cropping system differences.

Tea (Camellia Sinensis) is one of the most popular drink, consumed as infusion 
or bottled ready to drink beverages. Although tea leaves contain many 
antioxidants compounds, after processing they can drastically decrease, 
sometimes up to a full degradation, as in the case of catechin, a very healthy 
flavan-3-ol. In this context, the synthesis of a cocrystal between (+)-catechin 
and L-(+)-ascorbic acid, was proved to be a useful strategy to make a new 
ingredient able to ameliorate the antioxidant profile of both infusions and 
bottled teas. The obtained cocrystal showed a three-fold higher solubility than 
(+)catechin and its formation was elucidated unambiguously by FT-IR, thermal 
(DSC) and diffraction (PXRD) analyses. Antioxidant characteristics of the 
samples were evaluated by colorimetric assays. As expected, infusions showed 
much better antioxidant features than ready-to-use lemon and peach teas. The 
same trend was confirmed after the addition of the cocrystal at two 
concentration levels. In particular, supplementation at concentration of 2 mg 
mL-1 improved the bottled tea antioxidant values to the level showed by the 
not-added infusion tea.

Dartmouth, North Dartmouth 02747, USA.

A HPLC method was developed for the separation and determination of flavonoid 
and phenolic antioxidants in cranberry juices. Free flavonoid and phenolic 
compounds were fractionated into neutral and acidic groups by means of a 
solid-phase extraction method, followed by subsequent HPLC separations. Combined 
flavonoids and phenolics were hydrolyzed by acid before HPLC analysis. This 
developed method provides a fast and high resolution of individual flavonoid and 
phenolic compounds. In cranberry fruit, flavonoids and phenolic acids exist 
predominantly in combined forms, such as glycosides and esters. A total of 400 
mg of total flavonoids and phenolic compounds/l of sample was found in a freshly 
squeezed cranberry juice, which was distributed as about 44% of phenolic acids 
and 56% of flavonoids. Benzoic acid was the major phenolic compound. Major 
flavonoids in the freshly squeezed cranberry juice were quercetin and myricetin.

Epidemiological studies suggest that consumption of whole grain cereals and 
whole grain cereal products have many benefical health effects, including 
reducing risk of diabetes, obesity, coronary heart diseases, stroke and even 
some cancers. Precise knowledge protective compounds present in cereal grains 
can be achieved only when specific biomarkers (biological marker, indicator), 
that could provide estimation of grain cereals absorption and intake, are 
established and determined. 5-n-alkylresorcinols (main fraction of phenolic 
compounds in cereals), because of their specific occurrence only in bran 
fraction, obtained in refining of milling fractions process, could be a very 
good candidate to play the role of biomarker of whole grain intake. They are 
absorbed by animals and humans, present in human plasma and as metabolites in 
urine. Because composition of saturated homologues of 5-n-alkylresorcinols is 
different in rye and wheat grains, they could be used as an indicator of the 
intake of the specific type of cereals and whole grain cereal products.

Scutellarin is widely used in treating various cardiovascular diseases. Few data 
are available regarding its metabolism and pharmacokinetics in humans. The 
objectives of this study were to develop methods to identify major metabolites 
of scutellarin in human urine and plasma and to determine simultaneously the 
parent drug and its major metabolites in human plasma for pharmacokinetic 
studies. Four metabolites were detected in urine samples by liquid 
chromatography coupled with electrospray multi-stage mass spectrometry (MS), but 
only one of them was found in plasma. Its structure was confirmed as 
scutellarein 6-O-beta-D-glucuronide by MS, NMR, and UV absorbance spectra. The 
plasma concentrations of scutellarin and the major metabolite were 
simultaneously determined using liquid chromatography-tandem MS. After a single 
p.o. administration of 60 mg of scutellarin to 20 healthy subjects, the plasma 
concentrations of scutellarin were very low, and its plasma concentration-time 
curve was also anomalous. Plasma concentration of the major metabolite was 
comparatively high, and the peak plasma concentration was 87.0 +/- 29.1 ng/ml. 
The Tmax was late (7.85 +/- 1.62 h), and part of individual pharmacokinetic 
profiles showed double peaks, which indicated scutellarin could be absorbed into 
the intestine after hydrolysis to its aglycone by bacterial enzymes. This was 
followed by reconjugation in the intestinal cell and/or liver with glucuronic 
acid catalyzed by the phase II enzyme, which showed regioselectivity and species 
difference. The regioselectivity of glucuronoconjugation for scutellarin may be 
of importance for pharmacological activity. Plasma concentration of 
isoscutellarin can be used as a biomarker of scutellarin intake.

Medicine, Hubei University, 430062, P. R. China.

In this work, liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem ion-trap mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) was used to investigate the in-vivo and in-vitro 
metabolism of tectoridin. After oral administration of a single dose (100 mg 
kg(-1)) of tectoridin to healthy rats, faeces and urine samples were collected 
for 0-48 h and 0-24 h, respectively. Tectoridin was also incubated with rat 
intestinal flora and rat liver microsomes. Samples from in-vivo and in-vitro 
metabolism studies were purified using a C(18) solid-phase extraction cartridge, 
then separated using a reverse-phase C(18) column with methanol/ water (30:70, 
v/v, adjusted to pH 10.0 with ammonia water) as mobile phase and detected by an 
on-line MS(n) system. The structure of the metabolites was elucidated by 
comparing their molecular weights, retention times and full-scan MS(n) spectra 
with those of the parent drug. The results revealed six metabolites of 
tectoridin in urine (tectorigenin, hydrogenated tectorigenin, mono-hydroxylated 
tectorigenin, di-hydroxylated tectorigenin, glucuronide-conjugated tectorigenin 
and sulfate-conjugated tectorigenin); three metabolites in faeces (tectorigenin, 
di-hydroxylated tectorigenin and sulfateconjugated tectorigenin); one metabolite 
in the intestinal flora incubation mixture (tectorigenin), and four in the liver 
microsomal incubation mixture (tectorigenin, hydrogenated tectorigenin, 
mono-hydroxylated tectorigenin and di-hydroxylated tectorigenin). Except for 
tectorigenin, all other metabolites of tectoridin are reported for the first 
time.

Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), a medicinal plant and edible vegetable from the 
Lamiaceae family, holds significant therapeutic and culinary value. Endophytic 
bacterial inoculation is an effective strategy for enhancing the essential oil 
content and metabolic profile of medicinal plants. This study isolated and 
molecularly identified two endophytic bacteria, and evaluated their effects on 
the physiological, biochemical, and essential oil traits of basil using a 
completely randomized design. The bacterial isolates were identified as 
Microbacterium foliorum Emf1 and Paenibacillus peoriae ER11. Both isolates 
significantly improved key growth traits, with M. foliorum Emf1 showing the most 
substantial impact across various indicators. Notable increases compared to the 
control included root volume (106.79%), root surface area (60.66%), root fresh 
(71.81%) and dry weight (77.77%), shoot fresh (81.73%) and dry weight (81.48%), 
leaf fresh (84.54%) and dry weight (83.59%), membrane stability (400.85%), 
carotenoid content (200.00%), anthocyanin levels (61.90%), essential oil content 
(101.43%), total phenol (20.46%), and antioxidant activity (56.6%). This 
research provides novel insights by demonstrating the beneficial effects of 
these two endophytic bacterial isolates in enhancing basil's growth performance, 
biochemical properties and essential oil content.

Toxicology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.

Epidemiological studies have shown that consumption of fruits and vegetables is 
associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases. Increased consumption of 
fruits and vegetables containing high levels of phytochemicals has been 
recommended to prevent chronic diseases related to oxidative stress in the human 
body. In this study, 10 common vegetables were selected on the basis of 
consumption per capita data in the United States. A more complete profile of 
phenolic distributions, including both free and bound phenolics in these 
vegetables, is reported here using new and modified methods. Broccoli possessed 
the highest total phenolic content, followed by spinach, yellow onion, red 
pepper, carrot, cabbage, potato, lettuce, celery, and cucumber. Red pepper had 
the highest total antioxidant activity, followed by broccoli, carrot, spinach, 
cabbage, yellow onion, celery, potato, lettuce, and cucumber. The phenolics 
antioxidant index (PAI) was proposed to evaluate the quality/quantity of 
phenolic contents in these vegetables and was calculated from the corrected 
total antioxidant activities by eliminating vitamin C contributions. 
Antiproliferative activities were also studied in vitro using HepG(2) human 
liver cancer cells. Spinach showed the highest inhibitory effect, followed by 
cabbage, red pepper, onion, and broccoli. On the basis of these results, the 
bioactivity index (BI) for dietary cancer prevention is proposed to provide a 
simple reference for consumers to choose vegetables in accordance with their 
beneficial activities. The BI could be a new alternative biomarker for future 
epidemiological studies in dietary cancer prevention and health promotion.

Peanuts are consumed mostly as processed products. Although the effect of 
processing on isoflavone composition of legumes has been extensively studied, 
there has been no such study on peanuts. The objective of this study was to 
evaluate the effect of processing (boiling, oil- and dry-roasting) on the 
phytochemical composition of peanuts. Boiling had a significant effect on the 
phytochemical composition of peanuts compared to oil- and dry-roasting. Boiled 
peanuts had the highest total flavonoid and polyphenol content. The biochanin A 
and genistein content of boiled peanut extracts were two- and fourfold higher, 
respectively. trans-Resveratrol was detected only in the boiled peanuts, with 
the commercial product having a significantly (p < or = 0.05) higher 
concentration. Ultraviolet and mass spectrometry chromatograms for the boiled 
peanut extracts show the presence of four additional peaks that were not 
observed in the raw peanut extracts.

Peanuts have been reported to contain bioactive phytochemicals, particularly 
isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, and biochanin A) and trans-resveratrol. 
Currently, limited data are available regarding the levels of these bioactive 
compounds in peanuts with variations in reported levels. The purpose of this 
study was to compare four methods of extraction [stirring, sonication, Soxtec, 
and microwave-assisted sonication (MAS)] for runner peanuts. Quantification of 
the selected compounds was conducted by reverse-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography (RP-HPLC). The results showed that the MAS and Soxtec methods 
extracted significantly higher amounts of the phytochemicals. Also, the defatted 
peanuts gave significantly higher amounts of the phytochemicals compared to the 
nondefatted peanuts. The high levels of the isoflavones may be attributed to 
heat-induced conversion of conjugate glycosides to aglycons. The MAS and Soxtec 
methods may be used for total isoflavone content quantitation, while sonication 
or stirring may be the method of choice for quantitation of isoflavone 
composition (aglycons and glycoside conjugates) in peanuts.

Superoxide radical scavenging activity of the major polyphenols in fresh plums.

Chun OK(1), Kim DO, Lee CY.

Author information:

York 14456, USA.

The effect of polyphenols among different varieties of plums on superoxide 
radical scavenging activity (SRSA) was studied by an enzymatic method and their 
IC(50) values were determined. We found that the SRSA levels of the polyphenols 
were closely related to their chemical structures; cyanidin showed the lowest 
IC(50) among the polyphenols examined, and aglycones are more effective than 
their glycosides. BY 69-339 cultivar exhibited the lowest IC(50) among the 
eleven plum cultivars, which means the highest antioxidant activity in 
scavenging superoxide radicals, followed by French Damson, Cacaks Best, 
Beltsville Elite B70197, Empress, Castleton, Stanley, NY 6, NY 101, Mirabellier, 
and NY 9. IC(50) values showed a higher correlation with total flavonoids (r (2) 
= 0.8699) than total phenolics (r (2) = 0.8355), which indicated that flavonoids 
might contribute to the total SRSA more directly than other polyphenols. 
Anthocyanins in plums appeared to be the major contributors to the total SRSA, 
except for two yellow cultivars having no anthocyanins. Chlorogenic acid was the 
predominant phenolic acid, and it also exhibited SRSA significantly in the range 
of 1.0 to 94.9%. Quercetins were the major flavonols in plums. However, they 
showed relatively low contribution to the total SRSA.

Epidemiological and scientific research has contributed to the identification of 
the key role of dietary antioxidants in maintaining human health by preventing 
oxidative damage to cellular components. The antiradical activity of seven 
varieties of plums and their protective effects against oxidative stress were 
comparatively evaluated in mouse granulocytes in this study using a 
2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) test and a 
cellular test. The class of phytochemical compounds responsible for the main 
antioxidant capacities observed was also investigated. The ABTS and cellular 
tests revealed that the total antioxidant capacities, expressed as vitamin C 
equivalents, ranged from 691.2 to 2,164.64 mg and from 613.98 to 2,137.59 mg per 
100 g of fresh weight, respectively, suggesting that plums are rich in natural 
antioxidants and appreciably protect granulocytes from oxidative stress. Our 
results showed a linear correlation between either total phenolic or flavonoid 
contents and total antioxidant capacity, revealing that these compounds 
contribute significantly to the antioxidant activity of plums. The major 
polyphenolics in plums, identified and quantified using reversed-phase 
high-performance liquid chromatography, were tested to evaluate their protective 
effect on peripheral blood granulocytes from oxidative stress. The results 
suggest that individual polyphenolics contribute directly to the total 
protective effect of plums.

To study the effect of polyphenolics on antioxidant activities of cabbages, the 
amounts of total phenolics, total flavonoids, antioxidant capacity and 
individual phenolic compounds in raw and processed cabbages were determined. 
Fresh and pickled red cabbages exhibited the highest total phenolic contents 
(393.1+/-10.8 mg and 366.3+/-3.6 mg gallic acid equivalents/100 g fresh sample, 
respectively). Fresh and pickled red cabbages were also highest in flavonoids 
(108.1+/-9.3 mg and 72.4+/-4.4 mg catechin equivalents/100 g fresh sample, 
respectively). The antioxidant capacity (expressed as vitamin C equivalent 
antioxidant capacity) ranged from 57.1 to 695.6 mg vitamin C equivalents/100 g 
fresh sample, where raw and pickled red cabbages exhibited the highest 
antioxidant capacity. There was a good linear relationship between the total 
phenolics and antioxidant capacity (r2=0.9743), and between the total flavonoids 
and antioxidant capacity (r2=0.9557); however, the relationship between the 
ascorbic acid content and antioxidant capacity was very low (r2=0.1442). The 
antioxidant capacity of raw and processed cabbages was highly correlated with 
their contents of polyphenolics. Kaempferol, quercetin, and apigenin were the 
major flavonoids existing in cabbages except for raw and pickled red cabbages, 
where cyanidin was the predominant flavonoid (73.6-117.7 mg/kg). In the red 
cabbages, cyanidin was the major contributor to the antioxidant capacity as well 
as the content of total phenolics and flavonoids.

Non-extractable phenolic compounds (NEPs), or bound phenolic compounds, 
represent a crucial component of polyphenols. They are an essential fraction 
that remains in the residual matrix after the extraction of extractable phenolic 
compounds (EPs), making them a valuable resource for numerous applications. 
These compounds encompass a diverse range of phenolic compounds, ranging from 
low molecular weight phenolic to high polymeric polyphenols attached to other 
macro molecules, e.g., cell walls and proteins. Their status as natural, green 
antioxidants have been well established, with numerous studies showcasing their 
anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, anti-cancer, and hypoglycemic activities. These 
properties make them a highly desirable alternative to synthetic antioxidants. 
Fruit and vegetable (F&Veg) wastes, e.g., peels, pomace, and seeds, generated 
during the harvest, transport, and processing of F&Vegs, are abundant in NEPs 
and EPs. This review delves into the various types, contents, structures, and 
antioxidant activities of NEPs and EPs in F&Veg wastes. The relationship between 
the structure of these compounds and their antioxidant activity is explored in 
detail, highlighting the importance of structure-activity relationships in the 
field of natural antioxidants. Their potential applications ranging from 
functional food and beverage products to nutraceutical and cosmetic products. A 
glimpse into their bright future as a valuable resource for a greener, 
healthier, and more sustainable future, and calling for researchers, 
industrialists, and policymakers to explore their full potential, are 
elaborated.

An LC-MS method to determine concentrations of isoflavones and their sulfate and 
glucuronide conjugates in urine.

Most methods for detecting isoflavones in biological samples do not measure the 
concentration of sulfate conjugates. An LC-MS method is reported here to 
estimate urinary concentrations of genistein and daidzein, their sulfate and 
glucuronide conjugates and other major metabolites. Human and rat urine samples 
were extracted with diethyl ether, or pre-digested with sulfatase and/or 
beta-glucuronidase followed by extraction. The isoflavones were separated using 
gradient LC methods and detected by negative single ion monitoring on an MS 
system using a heated nebulizer atmospheric pressure chemical ionization 
interface. CVs for inter- and intra-assay variability were generally < 20 and 
10%, respectively. Preliminary studies using these procedures demonstrate 52+/-4 
and 26+/-4% of genistein in rat urine was found as the aglycone and sulfate 
conjugates, respectively, compared to 0.36 and 4%, respectively, in human urine. 
This method is suitable for the study of isoflavone sulfate conjugates in 
biological fluids.

Determination of unusual soya and non-soya phytoestrogen sources in beer, fish 
products and other foods.

Affairs, Sand Hutton, York YO41 1LZ, UK. db.clarke@csl.gov.uk

Fish and fish products (14 samples), Indian foods and meals (10 samples), spices 
(30 samples) and beers (10 samples) were analysed for their phytoestrogen 
content, and a number of significant non-soya sources of dietary phytoestrogens 
were identified. No isoflavones were detected in unprocessed, farmed or ocean 
fish, but some samples of processed fish products contained soya isoflavones, 
which are assumed to come from coatings or protein addition. Additionally, some 
processed fish products contained, genistein glycocongugates not derived from 
soya. Genistein was detected in Indian meals such that, for example, a single 
portion of a vindalooo curry contained 11 mg genistein. The origin was most 
likely from the spices used, since the analysis of curry powders, chilli powder, 
crushed red chillies, garam masala and tandoori powder revealed that some 
contained genistein at more than 100 mg kg(-1). Cumin was the most likely source 
material, although not all individual samples of cumin tested contained high 
levels of genistein. Prenylnaringenin phytoestrogens were determined in UK 
hop-based beers at mean concentrations of 0.21 mg(-1) 6-prenylnaringenin and 
0.06mg(-1) 8-prenylnaringenin. The beers also contained traces of daidzein, 
genistein and biochanin A. The significance of 'hidden soya' in processed foods 
and these non-soya sources of phytoestrogens is that UK dietary intake of 
phytoestrogens must be assumed to be higher than estimated previously and that 
some sources of phytoestrogens remain poorly characterized.

The analysis of general content of polyphenols, minerals and antioxidant 
activity of infusions from selected coffee substitutes is presented. The 
obtained results showed that the coffee infusions prepared from acorns exhibit 
the highest radical scavenging capacities for DPPH 
(EC50 = 0.063-0.066 mgd.w./mL), ABTS (EC50 = 0.021-0.029 mgd.w./mL), 
OH(EC50 = 2.050-2.378 mgd.w./mL) as well as the highest ability to Fe3+ 
reduction (FRAP) (∼1.1 mmolFe/gd.w). These coffee substitutes also contain the 
greatest values of polyphenols (45-50 mgGA/gd.w). Analyzed coffee substitutes 
differ in both quality and quantity of polyphenols, but all tested coffees 
contain gallic and chlorogenic acids. The most of phenolic compounds was found 
in herbal-cereal coffee substitute. The quantitative results and PCA analysis 
indicated a good correlation between the antioxidant activity and total 
polyphenols, flavonoids and gallic acid content. Using the obtained data on the 
composition and antioxidant properties of extracts the cluster analysis (CA) was 
performed to distinguish similar or close types of coffee.

Phenolic acids (chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic, ellagic, and 
syringic acid) as well as syringaldehyde and juglone were identified in ripe 
fruits of 10 walnut cultivars: Adams, Cisco, Chandler, Franquette, Lara, Fernor, 
Fernette, Alsoszentivani 117 (A-117), Rasna, and Elit. Analyses were done using 
a high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a diode array detector. 
Significant differences in the contents of identified phenolics were observed 
among cultivars. Phenolics were determined separately in the kernel and in the 
thin skin of the walnut, termed the pellicle. Not only in the kernel but also in 
the pellicle did syringic acid, juglone, and ellagic acid predominate (average 
values of 33.83, 11.75, and 5.90 mg/100 g of kernel; and 1003.24, 317.90, and 
128.98 mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively), and the contents of ferulic and 
sinapic acid (average values of 0.06 and 0.05 mg/100 g of kernel and 2.93 and 
2.17 mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively) were the lowest in all cultivars. The 
highest differences in the sum of all identified phenolics were observed between 
Rasna and Fernette fruits; in Rasna there were >2-fold higher contents of 
identified phenolics in both kernel and pellicle. It was found that the walnut 
pellicle is the most important source of walnut phenolics. The ratio between the 
contents in pellicle and kernel varied by at least 14.8-fold for caffeic acid 
(cv. Adams) and by up to 752.0-fold for p-coumaric acid (cv. Elit).

Biotransformation of the phytoestrogen [14C]genistein was investigated in male 
and female rats by application of narrow-bore radio-HPLC-MSn (LCQ, Finnigan) to 
determine intermediates in metabolism. Urine contained five metabolites, 
Gm1-Gm5, 24 h after dosing by gavage with [14C]genistein (4 mg kg(-1)). 
Structural analysis following ESI revealed molecular ions [M+H]+ of m/z 447, 
449, 273, and 271 for metabolites Gm2, Gm3, Gm5 and genistein, respectively and 
an [M-H]- of m/z 349 for Gm4. Metabolite structure was deduced by evaluation of 
product ion spectra derived from unlabelled and [14C]-labelled ions and 
sensitivity to treatment with beta-glucuronidase. These studies indicated 
identity of metabolites with genistein glucuronide (Gm2), dihydrogenistein 
glucuronide (Gm3), genistein sulphate (Gm4) and dihydrogenistein (Gm5). 
Detection of the beta-glucuronidase resistant major metabolite Gm1 by ESI was 
poor and so was analysed by negative ion APCI; this revealed a deprotonated 
molecular ion of m/z 165 which had chromatographic and mass spectral properties 
consistent with authentic 4-hydroxyphenyl-2-propionic acid, a novel metabolite 
of genistein. In vitro metabolism studies with anaerobic caecal cultures derived 
from male and female rats revealed metabolism of genistein to Gm1 via Gm5 and an 
additional metabolite (Gm6) which was identified from product ion spectra as 
6'-hydroxy-O-desmethylangolensin. Biotransformation of genistein by both 
isolated hepatocytes and precision-cut liver slices was limited to 
glucuronidation of parent compound. Commonality of genistein metabolites found 
in rats with those reported in man suggest similar pathways of 
biotransformation, primarily involving gut micro-flora.

Anthocyanins are potent antioxidants that may possess chronic disease preventive 
properties. Here, rapid, reliable, and reproducible solid-phase extraction, 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and mass spectrometry techniques 
are described for the isolation, separation, and identification of anthocyanins 
in human plasma and urine. Recoveries of cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) were 91% 
from water, 71% from plasma, and 81% from urine. Intra- and interday variations 
for C3G extraction were 9 and 9.1% in plasma and 7.1 and 9.1% in urine and were 
less than 15% for all anthocyanins from a standardized bilberry extract 
(mirtoselect). Analysis of mirtoselect by HPLC with UV detection produced 
spectra with 15 peaks compatible with anthocyanin components found in 
mirtoselect within a total run time of 15 min. Chromatographic analysis of human 
urine obtained after an oral dose of mirtoselect yielded 19 anthocyanin peaks. 
Mass spectrometric analysis employing multiple reaction monitoring suggests the 
presence of unchanged anthocyanins and anthocyanidin glucuronide metabolites.

major cocoa polyphenols and inter-relationships of their concentrations in 
chocolate.

Chocolate and other cocoa-containing products are a rich source of polyphenols. 
This paper describes an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) method 
that can separate and quantify in 3 min six of the major chocolate polyphenols: 
catechin; epicatechin; B2 (epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin); B5 
(epicatechin-4beta-6-epicatechin); C1 
(epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin); and tetramer D 
(epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin). A 
survey of 68 chocolate samples indicated that there was a strongly predictive 
relationship between epicatechin and the other individual polyphenols, 
especially procyanidin B2 (R 2 = 0.989), even though the chocolates came from 
varied sources and manufacturers. The relationship was less strong with 
catechin, and so further work to explore the reasons for this difference was 
performed. Chiral analysis on a subset of 23 chocolates showed that 
(-)-epicatechin had a predictive relationship with (+)-catechin in line with the 
other polyphenols, but not with (-)-catechin (the predominant form). This 
indicates that (-)-catechin is the most affected by manufacturing conditions, 
possibly formed through epimerization from (-)-epicatechin during processing. 
The results show that epicatechin concentrations can be used to predict the 
content of other polyphenols, especially B2 and C1, and total polyphenols 
content. Finally, the (-)-catechin content is not predictable from the 
epicatechin content, and it is concluded that this is the main form of 
polyphenol that varies according to manufacturing conditions and cocoa origin.

The validation of a HPTLC-densitometric method for the determination of 
secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) in flaxseed was performed improving the 
reproducibility of a previously reported HPTLC densitometric procedure by the 
use of fully wettable reversed phase plates (silica gel 60 RP18W F(254S), 
10cmx10cm) with MeOH:HCOOH 0.1% (40:60, v/v) mobile phase. The analysis required 
only the alkaline hydrolysis in aqueous medium of undefatted samples and 
densitometry at 282nm of HPTLC runs. The method was validated following the 
protocol proposed by the Société Francaise des Sciences et Techniques 
Pharmaceutiques (SFSTP) giving rise to a dependable and high throughput 
procedure well suited to routine application. SDG was quantified in the range of 
321-1071ng with RSD of repeatability and intermediate precision not exceeding 
3.61% and accuracy inside the acceptance limits. Flaxseed of five cultivars of 
different origin was elected as test-bed.

Six strawberry cultivars grown on the same commercial plantation in Brazil were 
evaluated for their chemical composition and quality attributes at the ripe 
stage. The profiles of the main soluble sugars, ascorbic acid, and anthocyanins 
were also obtained during the developmental stages. Results showed significant 
differences among cultivars in all of the investigated parameters. Cv. 
Campineiro showed an average value for texture of 0.63 N, half the value found 
for cv. Oso Grande. Anthocyanin content ranged from 13 (cv. Campineiro) to 55 
(cv. Mazi) mg/100 g. Total ascorbic acid found for cv. Campineiro (85 mg/100 g) 
was twice the amount found in cv. Dover (40 mg/100 g). Fructose was the 
predominant soluble sugar in almost all cultivars. The proportion among the main 
soluble sugars (fructose, sucrose, and glucose) was similar for Oso Grande and 
Toyonoka cultivars. The flavonol content (quercetin plus kaempferol derivatives) 
ranged from 2.7 to 7.1 mg/100 g, with a mean value of 6.1 mg/100 g, whereas free 
ellagic acid ranged from 0.9 to 1.9 and total phenolics varied from 159 to 289 
(mean 221) mg/100 g.

Simultaneous determination of alcohols, amines, amino acids, flavonoids, and 
purine and pyrimidine bases in bottled beer samples directly without any 
pre-treatment was carried out by capillary zone electrophoresis with diode-array 
detection. Electrolyte conditions such as pH, composition and concentration of 
the buffer, working voltage and type and time of injection were checked. The 
best separation of the cited analytes was achieved in 70 mM sodium borate 
solution and pH 10.25. The detection limits were from 2.1 to 5.6 mg L(-1) for 
the 18 compounds studied. The developed method is rapid, sensitive and 
quantitative and has been applied to seven types of international bottled beers 
of different origins bought locally.

Ensuring the safety and stability of minimally processed foods using natural 
preservatives is of great scientific and commercial interest in modern 
biotechnology. Berry juice supplementation is increasingly recognized within 
this field. This study investigated the effectiveness of juices from four berry 
species Aronia melanocarpa, Ribes nigrum, Vaccinium macrocarpon, and Sambucus 
nigra, against the food pathogen Bacillus cereus. Overall, the antibacterial 
potency of juice supplements (up to 10% v/v in tryptic soy broth) followed the 
order of chokeberry > blackcurrant > cranberry > elderberry, with the latter 
showing no inhibitory effects. Notably, chokeberry and elderberry juices 
presented lower acidity and significantly greater phenolic contents (p < 0.05) 
than blackcurrant and cranberry juices did, suggesting that B. cereus 
susceptibility is not strictly dependent upon low extracellular pH or elevated 
anthocyanin levels. Instead, it is inferred to correlate with pro-oxidative 
effects induced directly at the intracellular level. Accordingly, this paper 
discusses the antioxidative, acidic, and lipophilic attributes of juices and 
their constituent fractions, including anthocyanins, to elucidate their

The C-glycosyl flavonoid, aspalathin, is absorbed, methylated and glucuronidated 
intact in humans.

Human bioavailability of the flavonoid dihydrochalcones is little understood, 
and no evidence exists for C-glycosyl flavonoid absorption in humans. The 
present study uses catechol-O-methyltransferase to generate methylated 
metabolites of aspalathin (a C-glycosyl dihydrochalcone from rooibos tea). One 
of the methylated forms, both with and without glucuronidation, was detected 
using LC-MS/MS in the urine of human subjects (n = 6), demonstrating that 
deglycosylation is not a prerequisite for C-glycosyl flavonoid absorption. 
Methylation is catalysed by both intestine and liver cytosolic extracts. The 
results show that flavonoid C-glycosides are methylated and glucuronidated in 
vivo in an intact form in humans.

Noncovalent complexes were used for structural determination and isomer 
differentiation of flavonoid glucuronides. Several flavonoid glucuronides 
including naringenin-7-O-glucuronide, synthesized here for the first time, were 
used as test compounds. Electrospray ionization quadrupole ion trap mass 
spectrometry with collision-induced dissociation (CID) was used to analyze 
complexes of the form [Co(II) (L-H) (Aux)]+ and [Co(II) (L-H) (Aux)2]+, in which 
L is the flavonoid glucuronide and Aux is a phenanthroline-based ligand. These 
complexes yielded characteristic fragmentation patterns that facilitated 
assignment of the substitution position of the glucuronides. The methods were 
adapted to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with 
postcolumn cobalt complexation and were tested on extracts from biological 
fluids. The metabolites naringenin-7-O-glucuronide and 
naringenin-4'-O-glucuronide were detected in human urine following the 
consumption of grapefruit juice. Isomeric quercetin glucuronides were identified 
and differentiated after spiking rat plasma at the 1 microM level, proving that 
the new methods are effective at biologically relevant concentrations.

Cold plasma treatment of kiwifruit juice was studied in the domain of 18-30 kV 
of voltage, 2-6 mm of juice depth, and 6-10 min of treatment time using the 
response surface methodology (RSM). The experimental design utilized was a 
central composite rotatable design. The effect of voltage, juice depth, and 
treatment time on the various responses, namely peroxidase activity, color, 
total phenolic content, ascorbic acid, total antioxidant activity, and total 
flavonoid content, was examined. While modeling, the artificial neural network 
(ANN) showed greater predictive capability than RSM as the coefficient of 
determination (R2 ) value of responses was greater in the case of ANN 
(0.9538-0.9996) than in RSM (0.9041-0.9853). The mean square error value was 
also less in the case of ANN than in RSM. The ANN was coupled with a genetic 
algorithm (GA) for optimization. The optimum condition obtained from ANN-GA was 
30 kV, 5 mm, and 6.7 min, respectively.

The flavonoid quercetin in disease prevention and therapy: facts and fancies.

Biochemical and genetic studies on cellular and animal models on the 
mechanism(s) of action of phytochemicals provide a functional explanation of how 
and why a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is considered healthy. It is not 
unusual to find molecules that protect against diseases, which greatly differ 
from a physiopathological point of view, such as cancer and cardiovascular 
disorders. Quercetin falls into this category and possesses a broad range of 
biological properties. Uptake, metabolism and circulating concentrations of 
quercetin and its metabolites suggest that a regular diet provides amounts of 
quercetin (<1 μM) not compatible with its chemopreventive and/or 
cardioprotective effects. However, it appears relatively easy to increase total 
quercetin concentrations in plasma (>10 μM) by supplementation with 
quercetin-enriched foods or supplements. Multiple lines of experimental evidence 
suggest a positive association between quercetin intake and improved outcomes of 
inflammatory cardiovascular risk. The ameliorating effect of quercetin 
administration can be extended to other chronic inflammatory disorders but only 
if supplementation occurs in patients. Quercetin can be considered the prototype 
of a naturally-occurring chemopreventive agent because of its key roles in 
triggering the ""hallmarks of cancer"". However, several critical points must be 
taken into account when considering the potential therapeutic use of this 
molecule: (1) pharmacological versus nutraceutical doses applied, (2) 
specificity of its mechanism of action compared to other phytochemicals, and (3) 
identification of ""direct"" cellular targets. The design of specific clinical 
trials is extremely warranted to depict possible applications of quercetin in 
adjuvant cancer therapy.

A LC-MS method was developed for the determination of coumarin, vanillin, and 
ethyl vanillin in vanilla products. Samples were analyzed using LC-electrospray 
ionization (ESI)-MS in the positive ionization mode. Limits of detection for the 
method ranged from 0.051 to 0.073 microg mL(-1). Using the optimized method, 24 
vanilla products were analyzed. All samples tested negative for coumarin. 
Concentrations ranged from 0.38 to 8.59 mg mL(-1) (x =3.73) for vanillin and 
0.33 to 2.27 mg mL(-1) (x =1.03) for ethyl vanillin. The measured concentrations 
are compared to values calculated using UV monitoring and to results reported in 
a similar survey in 1988. Analytical results, method precision, and accuracy 
data are presented.

Effect of processing on the phytochemical profiles and antioxidant activity of 
corn for production of masa, tortillas, and tortilla chips.

USA.

The phytochemical profiles (total phenolics, anthocyanins, ferulic acid, 
carotenoids) and antioxidant activities of five types of corn (white, yellow, 
high carotenoid, blue, and red) processed into masa, tortillas, and tortilla 
chips were studied. The nixtamalization process significantly (p < 0.05) reduced 
total phenolics and antioxidant activities when compared to raw grains. 
Nixtamalized grains exhibited higher concentration of free phenolics and soluble 
conjugated ferulic acid and had lower concentrations of bound phenolics and 
ferulic acid than unprocessed grains. Among processed products, there was little 
difference in the phytochemical contents and antioxidant activities. Among types 
of corn, the highest concentrations of total phenolics, ferulic acid, and 
antioxidant activity were observed in the high-carotenoid genotype followed by 
the regular yellow counterpart. The white corn contained the lowest amount of 
total phenolics and antioxidant activity. The pigmented blue corn had the 
highest anthocyanin concentration followed by the red counterpart. These 
findings suggest that lime-cooking significantly reduced the phytochemical 
content of nixtamalized products but released phenolics and ferulic acid.

A simple and reproducible method for qualitative and quantitative analysis of 
phenolic compounds in virgin olive oils by solid-phase extraction (SPE), high 
performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), and 
HPLC-mass spectrometry (MS) in tandem mode was developed. The polar fraction was 
obtained from samples of three different virgin olive oils. Detection and 
quantification were performed at 280, 240, and 320 nm. For identification 
purposes, HPLC-MS/MS was equipped with turbo ion spray source in the 
negative-ion mode. Twenty compounds of twenty-three detected and quantified were 
characterized. The method showed satisfactory linearity (r > 0.99), good 
recovery, satisfactory precision, and appropriate limits of detection (LOD) and 
quantification (LOQ).

In human LDL, the bioactivity of olive oil phenols is determined by the in vivo 
disposition of the biological metabolites of these compounds. Here, we examined 
how the ingestion of 2 similar olive oils affected the content of the metabolic 
forms of olive oil phenols in LDL in men. The oils differed in phenol 
concentrations as follows: high (629 mg/L) for virgin olive oil (VOO) and null 
(0 mg/L) for refined olive oil (ROO). The study population consisted of a 
subsample from the EUROLIVE study and a randomized controlled, crossover design 
was used. Intervention periods lasted 3 wk and were preceded by a 2-wk washout 
period. The levels of LDL hydroxytyrosol monosulfate and homovanillic acid 
sulfate, but not of tyrosol sulfate, increased after VOO ingestion (P < 0.05), 
whereas the concentrations of circulating oxidation markers, including oxidized 
LDL (oxLDL), conjugated dienes, and hydroxy fatty acids, decreased (P < 0.05). 
The levels of LDL phenols and oxidation markers were not affected by ROO 
consumption. The relative increase in the 3 LDL phenols was greater when men 
consumed VOO than when they consumed ROO (P < 0.05), as was the relative 
decrease in plasma oxLDL (P = 0.001) and hydroxy fatty acids (P < 0.001). Plasma 
oxLDL concentrations were negatively correlated with the LDL phenol levels (r = 
-0.296; P = 0.013). Phenols in LDL were not associated with other oxidation 
markers. In summary, the phenol concentration of olive oil modulates the 
phenolic metabolite content in LDL after sustained, daily consumption. The 
inverse relationship of these metabolites with the degree of LDL oxidation 
supports the in vivo antioxidant role of olive oil phenolics compounds.

Trypsin inhibitors (TI), tannins, and lectins appear to have a role in 
preventing chronic diseases in humans. The genetic variability of these traits 
in common bean needs to be ascertained in order to increase levels through 
breeding. The variability of TI, tannin, and lectins was determined in five bean 
cultivars grown at five locations in Mexico. TI and tannins contents in colored 
beans that belong to the Jalisco race were higher (11.1-11.9 trypsin units 
inhibited (TUI)/mg and 29.0-38.1 mg catechin equivalent (CE)/g, respectively) 
than cultivars of the Durango race (7.9-8.3 TUI/mg and 16.8-19.9 CE/mg, 
respectively). Bayo Victoria, a Durango race cultivar, had three times more 
lectins than levels reported for soybean. Cultivar influenced TI and tannins 
contents (p < 0.001), whereas site affected lectins (p < 0.001). An increase in 
levels of TI and tannins could be enhanced through breeding.

A rapid HPLC-diode array detection (DAD) method was developed for the routine 
analysis of 16 anthocyanins in wine. Direct injection of filtered wine samples 
followed by selective detection at 520 nm allowed quantitation of these 
compounds in red wines. The method was linear for malvidin-3-glucoside over the 
range 5-250ppm, and the limit of detection for this compound was 0.18 ppm. A 
volatile mobile phase is used, which enables hyphenation to mass spectrometry 
(MS). With HPLC-MS, a total of 44 pigments could be identified in South African 
wines. Obtained mass spectra are discussed for a series of representative wine 
constituents and results are compared with literature references. An attempt was 
made to differentiate between different cultivars according to the anthocyanin 
content using stepwise forward linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

The effect of wild blueberry consumption on anthocyanin (ACNs) distribution and 
metabolism in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was investigated. Thirty-two rats were 
fed for 4 or 8 weeks with a control (C) or a wild blueberry-enriched diet (8%) 
(WB). Anthocyanin profile in plasma, urine, feces, brain, and liver was 
evaluated by LC-MS/MS, and significantly increased in urine and not in feces 
after 8 weeks on the WB diet compared to that in 4 weeks, but no anthocyanins 
were detected in plasma, liver, and brain samples either in the C or WB groups. 
Metabolites of ACNs were detected in the plasma, urine, feces, and tissues of 
both the C and WB groups, but the urinary excretion of hippuric acid increased 
significantly after 4 and 8 weeks of WB consumption. Thus, it seems that ACNs 
are metabolized by the intestinal microflora to respective phenyl-alkyl acids, 
which can be further metabolized to benzoic acid. In conclusion, ACNs are 
bioavailable in rats, and the extent of their metabolism and excretion is based 
on diet duration. Additionally, urinary hippuric acid content could represent a 
potential biomarker of ACNs absorption and metabolism in the SD rat under the 
present experimental conditions.

We describe a liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation tandem mass 
spectrometry method for the qualitative and quantitative determination of the 
secoiridoid oleuropein and its bioactive metabolite hydroxytyrosol in rat plasma 
and urine. Samples were prepared by liquid-liquid extraction using ethyl acetate 
with a recovery for both compounds of about 100% in plasma and about 60% in 
urine. The chromatographic separation was performed with a RP-ODS column using a 
water-acetonitrile linear gradient. The calibration curve was linear for both 
biophenols over the range 2.5-1000 ng/ml (LOD 1.25 ng/ml) for plasma and 5-1000 
ng/ml (LOD 2.5 ng/ml) for urine. Plasma concentrations of oleuropein and 
hydroxytyrosol were measured after oral administration of a single dose (100 
mg/kg) of oleuropein. Analysis of treated rat plasma showed the presence of 
unmodified oleuropein, reaching a peak value of 200 ng/ml within 2 h, with a 
small amount of hydroxytyrosol, whereas in urine, both compounds were mainly 
found as glucuronides.

OBJECTIVE: Because consumption of teas may be associated with potential health 
benefits due to its content in polyphenols and in Western countries the 
consumption of tea is equally divided between the hot and the ready-to-drink 
(RTD) cold versions of this typical beverage, the aim of this work was to study 
the absorption and metabolism of flavan-3-ols in human volunteers after the 
ingestion of a commercial RTD tea.
METHODS: A feeding study was carried out in 20 healthy human volunteers and 
urine samples were collected for 24h after tea ingestion. Flavan-3-ols-derived 
molecules were identified and quantified in urine samples by high-performance 
liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection.
RESULTS: Eight relevant metabolites were identified in urine, all modified 
flavan-3-ols with the exception of unmetabolized gallic acid. The urinary 
excretion of flavan-3-ols was equal to 7.2% of the intake with tea. Gallic acid, 
which was abundant in the RTD tea used in this study, reached a 4.5% of the 
drunken amount.
CONCLUSIONS: The bioavailability values observed are in agreement with previous 
reports, although the dosage of polyphenols ingested in this study is remarkably 
lower. Moreover, the use of a group of 20 volunteers, more than the average 
number of subjects used for usual human acute-feeding studies involving 
polyphenols, provides additional credibility to the results. After drinking the 
RTD ice tea used in this study, the internal compartments are exposed to 
non-marginal doses of flavanols and flavanol metabolites up to 24h.

This systematic review summarizes findings from human studies investigating the 
different routes of absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion (ADME) of 
dietary flavan-3-ols and their circulating metabolites in healthy subjects. 
Literature searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science. 
Human intervention studies using single and/or multiple intake of flavan-3-ols 
from food, extracts, and pure compounds were included. Forty-nine human 
intervention studies met inclusion criteria. Up to 180 metabolites were 
quantified from blood and urine samples following intake of flavan-3-ols, mainly 
as phase 2 conjugates of microbial catabolites (n = 97), with 
phenyl-γ-valerolactones being the most representative ones (n = 34). Phase 2 
conjugates of monomers and phenyl-γ-valerolactones, the main compounds in both 
plasma and urine, reached two peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of 260 and 
88 nmol/L at 1.8 and 5.3 h (Tmax) after flavan-3-ol intake. They contributed to 
the bioavailability of flavan-3-ols for over 20%. Mean bioavailability for 
flavan-3-ols was moderate (31 ± 23%, n bioavailability values = 20), and it 
seems to be scarcely affected by the amount of ingested compounds. While intra- 
and inter-source differences in flavan-3-ol bioavailability emerged, mean 
flavan-3-ol bioavailability was 82% (n = 1) and 63% (n = 2) after 
(-)-epicatechin and nut (hazelnuts, almonds) intake, respectively, followed by 
25% after consumption of tea (n = 7), cocoa (n = 5), apples (n = 3) and grape 
(n = 2). This highlights the need to better clarify the metabolic yield with 
which monomer flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins are metabolized in humans. This 
work clarified in a comprehensive way for the first time the ADME of a 
(poly)phenol family, highlighting the pool of circulating compounds that might 
be determinants of the putative beneficial effects linked to flavan-3-ol intake. 
Lastly, methodological inputs for implementing well-designed human and 
experimental model studies were provided.

Determination of free phenolic compounds in potato samples was optimized using a 
high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with on-line diode array 
detection. This method was applied to samples of four cultivars of potatoes 
harvested in Tenerife (Canary Islands). The free phenolic compounds found in the 
potato samples were (+)-catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric 
acid, and ferulic acid. Potato samples belonging to Colorada cultivar, ssp. 
andigena, had mean concentrations of total phenolic compounds and chlorogenic 
acid higher than those found for Kerr's Pink and Cara cultivars, ssp. tuberosum, 
and for Negra cultivar, S. x chaucha. In contrast, p-coumaric acid was not 
detected in any potato samples of the Colorada cultivar. Traditional potatoes 
presented a higher mean concentration of ferulic acid than recently imported 
potatoes. A significant and negative correlation was established between 
(+)-catechin and p-coumaric acid. A considerable contribution to the daily 
intake of flavonoids was observed with the actual consumption of potatoes.

The pigments responsible for the yellow-orange coloration of apple juices have 
remained largely unknown up to now. Four French cider apple juices were produced 
in conditions similar to those used in the cider-making industry. The oxidized 
juices, characterized using the CIE L a b parameters, displayed various colors 
depending on the apple variety and native phenolic composition. HPLC-DAD-MS 
revealed contrasting pigment profiles related to oxidized tanning and nontanning 
molecules. The latter were divided into two groups according to their polarity 
and their visible spectra. With regard to phenolic classes, flavanol monomers 
and hydroxycinnamic acids played an essential role in the formation of oxidation 
products. Interestingly, dihydrochalcones appeared to include precursors of some 
yellow compounds. Indeed, the yellow pigment phloretin xyloglucoside oxidation 
product (PXGOPj), derived from phloretin xyloglucoside, was clearly identified 
in apple juices as a xyloglucose analogue of the yellow pigment phloridzin 
oxidation product (POPj), previously characterized in a model solution by Le 
Guernevé et al. (Tetrahedron Lett. 2004, 45 (35), 6673-6677).

Toxicology, Stocking Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.

Processed fruits and vegetables have been long considered to have lower 
nutritional value than their fresh commodities due to the loss of vitamin C 
during processing. This research group found vitamin C in apples contributed < 
0.4% of total antioxidant activity, indicating most of the activity comes from 
the natural combination of phytochemicals. This suggests that processed fruits 
and vegetables may retain their antioxidant activity despite the loss of vitamin 
C. Here it is shown that thermal processing elevated total antioxidant activity 
and bioaccessible lycopene content in tomatoes and produced no significant 
changes in the total phenolics and total flavonoids content, although loss of 
vitamin C was observed. The raw tomato had 0.76 +/- 0.03 micromol of vitamin C/g 
of tomato. After 2, 15, and 30 min of heating at 88 degrees C, the vitamin C 
content significantly dropped to 0.68 +/- 0.02, 0.64 +/- 0.01, and 0.54 +/- 0.02 
micromol of vitamin C/g of tomato, respectively (p < 0.01). The raw tomato had 
2.01 +/- 0.04 mg of trans-lycopene/g of tomato. After 2, 15, and 30 min of 
heating at 88 degrees C, the trans-lycopene content had increased to 3.11+/- 
0.04, 5.45 +/- 0.02, and 5.32 +/- 0.05 mg of trans-lycopene/g of tomato (p < 
0.01). The antioxidant activity of raw tomatoes was 4.13 +/- 0.36 micromol of 
vitamin C equiv/g of tomato. With heat treatment at 88 degrees C for 2, 15, and 
30 min, the total antioxidant activity significantly increased to 5.29 +/- 0.26, 
5.53 +/- 0.24, and 6.70 +/- 0.25 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of tomato, 
respectively (p < 0.01). There were no significant changes in either total 
phenolics or total flavonoids. These findings indicate thermal processing 
enhanced the nutritional value of tomatoes by increasing the bioaccessible 
lycopene content and total antioxidant activity and are against the notion that 
processed fruits and vegetables have lower nutritional value than fresh produce. 
This information may have a significant impact on consumers' food selection by 
increasing their consumption of fruits and vegetables to reduce the risks of 
chronic diseases.

The effects of the phenolic compounds of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on AGS 
cells have never been studied so far, which is the aim of this study. The 
profiles of the main phenolic components in EVOOs, mainly secoiridoid compounds 
derived from the transformation of oleuropein during the olive milling process, 
were evaluated and compared. Oils of different origins were evaluated aiming at 
verifying whether chemical differences in the phenolic composition of the dry 
extracts played a role in the metabolism and in maintaining the cellular redox 
state of AGS cells. The following key enzymes of some metabolic pathways were 
studied: lactate dehydrogenase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, glucose 6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and hexokinase. 
As confirmed through PCA analysis, pretreatments with the dry extracts of EVOOs 
at different concentrations appeared to be able to counteract the enzymatic 
activity alterations due to oxidative stress induced by H2O2 1 mM and 2 mM. The 
studied phytocomplexes showed the ability to protect AGS cells from oxidative 
damage and the secoiridoid derivatives from both oleuropein and ligstroside 
contributed to the observed effects. The results suggested that EVOOs with 
medium to high concentrations of phenols can exert this protection.

Common bean effects on health have been related to its dietary fiber content and 
other active compounds. This study assessed the content of flavonoids, 
coumestrol, phenolic acids, galactooligosaccharides, and phytic acid in wild and 
cultivated Mexican common bean seeds (raw and cooked) and that of flavonoids, 
coumestrol, and phenolic acids in germinated bean seeds. The presence of 
isoflavones in raw bean seeds was not confirmed by the UV spectra. Quercetin, 
kaempferol, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and vanillic 
acid mean contents were 10.9, 52.3, 10.1, 9.6, 5.4, and 18.2 microg/g, 
respectively; raffinose, stachyose, verbascose, and phytic acid mean contents 
were 8.5, 56.3, 5.5, and 11.5 mg/g, respectively, in raw seeds. All compounds 
were affected by autoclaving, and germination resulted in a de novo synthesis of 
flavonols, phytoestrogens, and phenolic acids. The impact on health of common 
bean seed is affected by dietary burden, specific compounds content, and 
processing. On the other hand, germinated bean seed or beans sprouts may be 
sources of antioxidants and phytoestrogens.

Thermal treatments can improve the processing suitability and nutritional 
utilization of cereals. In this study, the effects of three thermal treatments, 
namely heat fluidization, microwave, and baking, on the physical, nutritional, 
and structural properties of whole grain black Tartary buckwheat (BTB), as well 
as the multiscale structures and digestive characteristics of in-kernel 
starches, were evaluated. Thermal treatments induced grain expansion, surface 
cracking, and porous internal structures, with heat fluidization causing the 
most significant reduction (32.06 %) in kernel hardness. Heat fluidization also 
enhanced rutin extractability by 68.00 % and antioxidant activities. Volatile 
compound analysis revealed heat fluidization reduced aldehyde and hydrocarbon 
levels, especially reducing hexanal from 27.06 to 3.86 mg/kg. For in-kernel 
starches, heat fluidization increased cold-water viscosity (56-fold), disrupted 
A-type crystallinity (relative crystallinity dropped to 8.49 %), reduced 
short-range ordered structure (R993/1018 decreased by 2.21 %), and enhanced 
resistant starch content (33 %). The study highlighted heat fluidization as the 
most effective method for enhancing processing and nutritional properties of 
whole grain BTB, offering insights for developing nutrient-dense whole grain 
products.

Phenolic composition and antioxidant capacity of 20 oat genotypes differing in 
hull color were investigated. Phenolic aldehydes, phenolic acids, 
avenanthramides and mono-, and diglycerides were identified in the soluble 
phenolic fraction of the genotypes. The bound phenolic fraction proved to be 
less diverse with phenolic aldehydes, phenolic acids and a ferulic acid 
dehydrodimer detected. Investigating the scavenging capacity of the hull and 
groat toward 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), an increased antioxidant 
activity (AOA) of hull compared to groats and a color dependence of the hull AOA 
could be observed. Principal component analysis on the determined variables 
revealed that the black-hulled samples were different from the white ones due to 
their increased phenolic content detected in the hull. However, reddish-hulled 
varieties were grouping with the accessions of the other colored groups. In 
addition, a distinction between spring and winter cultivars was also observed.

soybean seedlings monitored by capillary electrophoresis with diode array 
detection.

Bologna, Bologna, Italy.

In this work, a new CE method with diode array detection (DAD) was developed for 
the monitoring and quantitation of flavonoids in different beans treated and 
untreated with UV-B radiation. Flavonoid concentration was monitored in 
UV-B-treated and untreated sprouts of three common beans (Zolfino ecotype, cv. 
Verdone, cv. Lingua di Fuoco) and one soybean (cv. Pacific). After acid 
hydrolysis of extracts, the CE-DAD method provides reproducible quantitative 
determinations of daidzein, glycitein, genistein, and kaempferol at ppm level in 
these natural matrices within a relatively short time (less than 16 min). Total 
flavonoid content determined by CE-DAD was 159 +/- 8, 26 +/- 2, 13 +/- 1, and 
1.3 +/- 0.3 microg/g fresh weight for untreated sprouts of Pacific soybean, 
Verdone bean, Zolfino bean, and Lingua di Fuoco bean, respectively. UV-B 
treatment caused no significant quantitative effect on Pacific soybean sprouts, 
whereas it enhanced the total isoflavone content by 1.5, 1.8, and 3.2-fold in 
Verdone, Zolfino, and Lingua di Fuoco beans, respectively. The proposed method 
shows (i) the potentialities of bean sprouts as a natural source of bioactive 
compounds (antioxidants); (ii) the technological role of UV-B treatment for 
sprout isoflavone enrichment; and (iii) the good capabilities of CE-DAD to 
monitor this process.

Column liquid chromatography on a C18-bonded silica column with 
water-methanol-acetic acid as eluent was used to determine polyphenols and 
caffeine in tea. Without any pretreatment, catechin, epicatechin gallate, 
epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epicatechin and caffeine were 
separated successfully within 15 min. The detection limits (S/N = 3) of 
polyphenols studied were 1.8-24 mg/l at a detection wavelength 270 nm. The 
linear range of the peak area calibration curves for the analytes were over two 
orders of magnitude with a correlation coefficient of 0.996-0.999. Using this 
method, some Chinese tea samples were analyzed with a good reproducibility (RSD 
are below 5%).

599-8531, Japan. dingc@ba.ars.usda.gov

Phenolic compounds in loquat fruit were identified as 5-caffeoylquinic acid 
(chlorogenic acid), neochlorogenic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, 5-p-feruloylquinic 
acid, protocatechuic acid, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, epicatechin, o-coumaric acid, 
ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid. Neochlorogenic acid was found to be dominant 
in the early stages of loquat fruit development. Both the concentrations and 
types of phenolic compounds were high in young fruit but then decreased steadily 
during growth. However, the concentration of chlorogenic acid increased during 
ripening and became predominant in ripe fruit. The large rise in chlorogenic 
acid concentration appears to be a characteristic of loquat fruit ripening. In 
all of the cultivars tested, the types of phenolic compounds were similar but 
the total phenolic content varied from 81.8 to 173.8 mg/100 g of fresh pulp. In 
the biosynthetic pathway of chlorogenic acid, the enzyme activities of 
phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (CL), and 
hydroxycinnamoyl CoA:quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (CQT) were high at the 
early stage of growth, diminished to low levels approximately 3 weeks prior to 
harvest, but then rose to a peak at 1 week before harvest. The changes of these 
enzyme activities seemed to be associated with variations in chlorogenic acid 
concentration during development, maturation, and ripening of loquat fruit.

The possibility of proving the undeclared addition of pumpkin puree in apricot 
nectars and jams has been investigated by using the phenol compound fingerprint 
and sensory evaluation. The cheaper pumpkin admixtures in apricot nectars and 
jams could not be detected by the sensory evaluation, particularly if present in 
quantities of <15%. The lower admixtures of pumpkin puree in apricot nectars and 
jams could be detected by the presence of syringic acid, a phenolic compound 
characteristic of the investigated pumpkins (Cucurbita pepo cv. Gleisdorff and 
Table Gold, Cucurbita maxima cv. Turkinja, and Cucurbita moschata cv. Argenta). 
Syringic acid was isolated from pumpkin puree and determined by using HPLC with 
diode array detection. By using the phenolic profile, undeclared pumpkin 
admixture (> or =5%) in the apricot nectars and jams could be proven.

Lentils (Lens culinaris L.) are a popular food in many countries. However, 
little is known about their phenolic composition. Because polyphenols in lentils 
are located essentially in their seed coat, the objective of this work was to 
study the composition of proanthocyanidins, the major group of polyphenols, in 
this part of the tissue. The use of C(18) Sep-Pak cartridges permitted the 
fractionation of lentil seed coat extract into monomer, oligomer, and polymer 
proanthocyanidin fractions. Subsequent thiolysis of oligomer and polymer 
fractions followed by HPLC analysis allowed the mean degree of polymerization 
(mDP) and the structural composition of proanthocyanidins to be determined. A 
fractionation of lentil seed coat extracts on a polyamide column followed by 
HPLC and HPLC-DAD-MS analyses was used to identify the individual 
proanthocyanidins. The results showed that the major monomeric flavan-3-ol was 
(+) catechin-3-glucose, with lesser amounts of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin. 
In the oligomer fraction, various dimer, trimer, and tetramer proanthocyanidins 
constituted of catechin, gallocatechin, and catechin gallate units were 
identified, and several procyanidins and prodelphinidins from pentamers to 
nonamers constitute the polymer fraction. The most abundant proanthocyanidins in 
the seed coat of lentils are the polymers (65-75%), with a mDP of 7-9, followed 
by the oligomers (20-30%), with a mDP of 4-5.

Anthocyanins and derived components of red wines were determined by microHPLC 
using a 1 mm ID HPLC column coupled on-line with an MS detector equipped with an 
ESI (ElectroSpray Ionisation) source. The use of microcolumn HPLC greatly 
enhanced detection performance, allowing direct identification of components 
present in the fraction. Nineteen anthocyanins were detected. Fifteen were 
identified, two were tentatively identified, and only the aglycon of the 
remaining two components was certainly identified. Six anthocyanin-derived 
pigments, supposedly formed during wine maturation, were also investigated and 
found in a wine sample. The analysis of red wine anthocyanins was also carried 
out by injecting a large sample volume onto a 0.32 mm ID HPLC column, using the 
column focusing technique, in order to decrease the limit of detection and 
quantification of components present in a very small amounts.

Four high yielding and early maturing cultivars of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) 
namely UPAS-120, ICPL-87, ICPL-151 and, especially, Manak, contained significant 
amounts of polyphenols (1075 to 1328 mg/100g), which may limit their 
utilization. The effectiveness of soaking (6, 12 and 18 h, 30 degrees C), 
soaking and dehulling, ordinary cooking, pressure cooking and germination (24, 
36, 48 h, 30 degrees C) in reducing the levels of polyphenols was investigated. 
A decrease in the polyphenolic contents varying from 4 to 26 percent in 
different pigeon pea cultivar was achieved. Pressure cooking of soaked-dehulled 
seeds was found to be the most effective method, followed by sprouting for 48 h, 
ordinary cooking of soaked-dehulled seeds, and pressure cooking of soaked whole 
seeds followed by sprouting for 36 h.

Eight varieties of lettuce (Lactuca sativum) and three varieties of endive 
(Cichorium endivia) were analyzed for flavonoid composition and content. Total 
flavonoid contents, expressed as units of aglycon for fresh material, were in 
the ranges of 0.3-229 microg/g for lettuce and 44-248 microg/g for endive. Five 
quercetin conjugates [quercetin 3-O-galactoside, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, 
quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, quercetin 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside, and quercetin 
3-O-rhamnoside] and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide were measured in the green-leafed 
lettuce and an additional two cyanidin conjugates [cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and 
cyanidin 3-O-[(6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] in the red-leafed varieties. Three 
kaempferol conjugates [kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-glucuronide, and 
kaempferol 3-O-[6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] were measured in each of the endive 
varieties. The presence and identity of kaempferol 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside in 
endive was shown for the first time. Shredding of lettuce leaf followed by 
exposure to light produced significant losses of the flavonoid moiety in the 
green oak leaf (94%), red oak leaf (43%), iceberg (36%), green batavia (25%), 
lollo biondo (24%), and lollo rosso (6%) samples, whereas cos and green salad 
bowl samples did not show an overall loss. Shredding of endive also produced 
loss of the flavonoid moiety in escarole (32%), fine frisee (13%), and coarse 
frisee (8%). Significant demalonation was observed for both the quercetin and 
cyanidin glucosides in lettuce, whereas a similar degradation of the kaempferol 
analogue was found in endive tissue. Storage of whole heads of both lettuce and 
endive in the dark at 1 degrees C and 98% humidity for 7 days resulted in losses 
of total flavonol glycosides in the range of 7-46%. The identification of the 
amounts, position of substitution, and nature of the sugars is important for 
understanding the potential bioavailability and biological activities of 
flavonoids in salads.

United Kingdom.

We determined the uptake and excretion of low doses of polyphenols in six 
subjects who each consumed 1.1 L of an alcoholic cider beverage. Over a 24-h 
period, no phloretin was detected in plasma (detection limit = 0.036 
micromol/L), but 21 +/- 5% of the dose (4.8 mg) was excreted in the urine. In 
contrast, from a low dose of 1.6-mg quercetin equivalents, no quercetin was 
found in urine or plasma, but 3'-methyl quercetin was detected in plasma [C(max) 
(maximum concentration) = 0.14 +/- 0.19 micromol/L; range: 0 to 0.44 
micromol/L]. No flavanol monomers (dose of free (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin 
= 3.5 mg) were detected in urine or plasma (detection limit: 0.01 micromol/L). 
Caffeic acid (total dose including esters = 11 mg) was detected only in plasma 
within 2 h, with C(max) = 0.43 +/- 0.3 micromol/L (range: 0.18 to 0.84 
micromol/L). An almost 3-fold increase in hippuric acid was detected in 24-h 
urine (74 +/- 29 micromol/L; range: 38-116 micromol/L), compared with a prestudy 
value of 19 +/- 9 micromol/L. These data show that polyphenols are taken up from 
cider, that phloretin is excreted in the urine and suggest that low doses of 
quercetin are extensively methylated in humans.

Technology, Akadeemia tee 15, 12618 Tallinn, Estonia. sille@brosven.ee

Berries are known to contain phenolic substances (i.e., flavonoids and phenolic 
acids), which comprise two large and heterogeneous groups of biologically active 
nonnutrients. This investigation evaluated the content and profile of the 
phenolic compounds present in six different berries found in Northern Europe. 
The latter included bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), cowberry (Vaccinium 
vitis-idaea), cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccus), strawberry (Fragaria ananassa), 
black currant (Ribes nigrum), and red currant (Ribes rubrum). The study was 
focused on two areas. The first involved the extraction and analysis of berries 
for total phenolic content and determination of their antioxidant activity. The 
total phenolic level of berries was correlated with their antioxidant activity. 
Second, the berry extracts were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis to 
determine the content and profile of selected bioactive compounds. The analytes 
of interest included trans-resveratrol, cinnamic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric 
acid, quercetin, and morin.

Oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and phenolic and anthocyanin 
concentrations in fruit and leaf tissues of highbush blueberry.

Jersey 08019, USA.

Antioxidant capacity, as measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), 
and total phenolic and total anthocyanin contents were evaluated in fruit 
tissues of 87 highbush blueberry (Vacciniumcorymbosum L.) and 
species-introgressed highbush blueberry cultivars. ORAC and phenolic levels were 
evaluated in leaf tissues of the same materials. Average values for ORAC, 
phenolics, and anthocyanins in fruit were 15.9 ORAC units, 1.79 mg/g (gallic 
acid equivalents), and 0.95 mg/g (cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents), 
respectively. Cv. Rubel had the highest ORAC per gram of fresh weight values, at 
31.1 units, and cv. Elliott had the highest values on the basis of ORAC per 
square centimeter of surface area. In leaf tissue, values for both ORAC and 
phenolics were significantly higher than in fruit tissue, with mean values of 
490 ORAC units and 44.80 mg/g (gallic acid equivalents), respectively. Leaf ORAC 
had a low, but significant, correlation with fruit phenolics and anthocyanins, 
but not with fruit ORAC. An analysis of ORAC values versus calculated midparent 
values in 11 plants from the 87-cultivar group in which all parents were tested 
suggested that, across cultivars, ORAC inheritance is additive. An investigation 
of ORAC values in a family of 44 cv. Rubel x Duke seedlings showed negative 
epistasis for ORAC values, suggesting Rubel may have gene combinations 
contributing to ORAC that are broken up during hybridization.

Citrus flavonoids have been investigated for their biological activity, with 
both anti-inflammatory and -carcinogenic effects being reported. However, little 
information is known on the bioavailability of these compounds in vivo. The 
objectives of this study were to determine the tissue distribution of naringenin 
after gastric gavage of [3H]-naringenin to rats. Unlabelled naringenin was also 
used to quantify the levels of naringenin and its major metabolites in tissues 
and eliminated in the urine and faeces. Significant radioactivity was detected 
in the plasma as well as all tissues examined 2h post-gavage. After 18h, higher 
levels of radioactivity were retained in plasma and tissues (55% of the 
administered radioactivity). Investigation of the nature of metabolites, using 
unlabelled naringenin, revealed that the glucuronides were the major components 
in plasma, tissues and urine, in addition to the colonic metabolite 
3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid, detected in the urine. The aglycone was the 
form extensively retained in tissues after 18h post-gavage. Total identified 
metabolites detected after 18h in most tissues were only 1-5% of the levels 
detected after 2h. However, the brain, lungs and heart retained 27, 20 and 11%, 
respectively, relative to the total metabolites detected at 2h. While 
radioactive detection suggests increased levels of breakdown products of 
naringenin after 18 h versus 2 h, the products identified using unlabelled 
naringenin are not consistent with this, suggesting that a predominant 
proportion of the naringenin breakdown products at 18 h are retained as smaller 
decomposition molecules which cannot yet be identified.

Recent reports have demonstrated various cardiovascular and neurological 
benefits associated with the consumption of foods rich in anthocyanidins. 
However, information regarding absorption, metabolism, and especially, tissue 
distribution are only beginning to accumulate. In the present study, we 
investigated the occurrence and the kinetics of various circulating pelargonidin 
metabolites, and we aimed at providing initial information with regard to tissue 
distribution. Based on HPLC and LC-MS analyses we demonstrate that pelargonidin 
is absorbed and present in plasma following oral gavage to rats. In addition, 
the main structurally related pelargonidin metabolite identified in plasma and 
urine was pelargonidin glucuronide. Furthermore, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, a ring 
fission product of pelargonidin, was detected in plasma and urine samples 
obtained at 2 and 18 h after ingestion. At 2 h post-gavage, pelargonidin 
glucuronide was the major metabolite detected in kidney and liver, with levels 
reaching 0.5 and 0.15 nmol pelargonidin equivalents/g tissue, respectively. 
Brain and lung tissues contained detectable levels of the aglycone, with the 
glucuronide also present in the lungs. Other tissues, including spleen and 
heart, did not contain detectable levels of pelargonidin or ensuing metabolites. 
At 18 h post-gavage, tissue analyses did not reveal detectable levels of the 
aglycone nor of pelargonidin glucuronides. Taken together, our results 
demonstrate that the overall uptake of the administered pelargonidin was 18 % 
after 2 h, with the majority of the detected levels located in the stomach. 
However, the amounts recovered dropped to 1.2 % only 18 h post-gavage, with the 
urine and faecal content constituting almost 90 % of the total recovered 
pelargonidin.

arietinum L.) undergoing different cooking methods and germination.

University, Shibin El-Kom, Egypt.

The effects of cooking treatments (boiling, autoclaving and microwave cooking) 
and germination on the nutritional composition and antinutritional factors of 
chickpeas were studied. Cooking treatments and/or germination caused significant 
(p < 0.05) decreases in fat, total ash, carbohydrate fractions, antinutritional 
factors, minerals and B-vitamins. Germination was less effective than cooking 
treatments in reducing trypsin inhibitor, hemagglutinin activity, tannins and 
saponins; it was more effective in reducing phytic acid, stachyose and 
raffinose. Cooking treatments and germination decreased the concentrations of 
lysine, tryptophan, total aromatic and sulfur-containing amino acids. However, 
cooked and germinated chickpeas were still higher in lysine, isoleucine and 
total aromatic amino acid contents than the FAO/WHO reference. The losses in 
B-vitamins and minerals in chickpeas cooked by microwaving were smaller than in 
those cooked by boiling and autoclaving. Germination resulted in greater 
retention of all minerals and B-vitamins compared to cooking treatments. In 
vitro protein digestibility, protein efficiency ratio and essential amino acid 
index were improved by all treatments. The chemical score and limiting amino 
acid of chickpeas subjected to the various treatments varied considerably, 
depending on the type of treatment. Based on these results, microwave cooking 
appears to be the best alternative for legume preparation in households and 
restaurants.

A HPLC method was developed for the analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside 
(SDG) and hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in milled defatted flaxseed flour. 
Direct extraction by 1 M NaOH for 1 h at 20 degrees C resulted in a higher yield 
than that obtained by hydrolysis of alcoholic extracts. An internal standard, 
o-coumaric acid, was used and the method was found to be easy, fast, and with 
good repeatability. On dry matter basis, different samples of flaxseeds varied 
considerably in their content of (+)-SDG (11.9-25.9 mg/g), (-)-SDG (2.2-5.0 
mg/g), p-coumaric acid glucoside (1.2-8.5 mg/g), and ferulic acid glucoside 
(1.6-5.0 mg/g).

The increasing generation of domestic waste poses significant environmental 
challenges, particularly in the context of disposal and resource utilization. 
This review critically evaluates the potential application of selected household 
waste materials-waste cooking oil (WCO), eggshell powder (ESP), waste plastics 
(WP), and waste glass (WG)-as functional additives in the bituminous binder and 
mixture. The study explores their roles as rejuvenators, modifiers, fillers, and 
partial replacements for coarse and fine aggregates. Findings indicate that WCO, 
when used in concentrations of 1-4%, effectively rejuvenates aged binders by 
enhancing workability and reducing stiffness. Incorporation of 5% ESP improves 
binder stiffness and resistance to thermal-induced deformations. Bitumen 
modified with 0.25% LDPE, 2% HDPE, and 1% PP when used in combination displays 
significantly enhanced adhesion and elasticity. Additionally, substituting 
aggregates with WG up to 10-15% demonstrates improvements in strength and 
durability without compromising mix integrity. The review further discusses the 
challenges associated with integrating these materials in road construction. The 
comparative analysis confirms that these waste-derived modifiers can partially 
or wholly replace conventional materials, contributing to both enhanced pavement 
performance and sustainable infrastructure development.

Oat milling fractions were examined for concentrations of total phenolics, 
tocols, and phenolic acids and in vitro antioxidant activity to determine their 
potential as dietary antioxidants. Methanolic extracts of pearling fractions, 
flour and aspirations from flaking, and trichomes had high, intermediate, and 
low antioxidant activities, respectively, evaluated by the beta-carotene 
bleaching method. Pearling fractions were also highest in total phenolics and 
tocols. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, vanillin, p-coumaric 
acid, and ferulic acid were identified and quantified by HPLC. Three 
avenanthramides and an unidentified ferulate derivative were also detected. 
Total phenolic content was significantly correlated with antioxidant activity, 
and regression equations that predicted antioxidant activity from phenolic and 
tocol concentrations were calculated. Antioxidant activity, evaluated by 
beta-carotene bleaching, was correlated with measures of oxygen radical 
absorbance capacity and low-density lipoprotein oxidation. These data indicate a 
potential for oat products, especially those enriched in outer layers of the 
groat, to contribute to dietary intakes of antioxidant phytonutrients.

Sichuan Congou black tea (SCGBT), one of China's top three high-aroma black 
teas, enjoys widespread consumer popularity. However, research into optimal 
processing varieties remains insufficient. This study assessed the quality of 
SCGBT produced from eight tea varieties: 'Fudingdabai' (FDDB), 'Zhongcha 302' 
(ZC302), 'Wuniuzao' (WNZ), 'Chuancha 2' (CC2), 'Fuxuan 9' (FX9), 'Mingshan 131' 
(MS131), 'Zhongcha 108' (ZC108), and 'Huangjinya' (HJY). Sensory evaluation, 
quantitative chemical analysis, and metabolomics techniques were employed. 
Results indicated that HJY, ZC302, and MS131 exhibited strong sweetness, umami, 
and mellowness, while CC2, FX9, and ZC108 were characterized by intense 
bitterness and astringency, attributed to high tea polyphenol levels and low 
free amino acid concentrations. The quality of WNZ and FDDB was relatively 
average. Using non-targeted metabolomics, 4,476 metabolite ion features were 
detected, and 75 significantly differential metabolites were identified 
(p < 0.05 and VIP > 1.0). Correlation analysis revealed that metabolites such as 
valine, L-glutamic acid, asparagine, L-serine, 
kaempferol-3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, quercetin-7-O-glucoside, L-tyrosine, 
and L-norleucine significantly influenced the taste of the tea infusion 
(|r| > 0.8, p < 0.05). Elevated levels of amino acids (L-glutamic acid and 
asparagine) and phenolic acids (gallic acid) contributed to the umami of HJY, 
ZC302, and MS131. Astringency was primarily determined by variations in 
flavonol/flavone and flavonol/flavone glycosides, as well as ester catechins. 
Additionally, the content of sweet-tasting amino acids and non-ester catechins 
was found to fluctuate. In summary, ZC302, MS131, and HJY are more suitable for 
processing into higher-grade SCGBT. These findings provide a theoretical and 
practical foundation for selecting and breeding high-quality SCGBT varieties and 
ensuring consistent product quality.

The polyphenolic composition of 62 wild and weedy Mexican bean collections from 
diverse origins, grouped by their seed coat color, was assessed. According to 
spectrophotometric analysis, the range of total phenols, condensed tannins, and 
total anthocyanins presented wide differences. Furthermore, the phenolic acid, 
flavonoid, and anthocyanin profiles were analyzed using HPLC. Ferulic was the 
main phenolic acid. Kaempferol and quercetin were the main flavonoids, and the 
isoflavones daidzein and coumestrol were found in only low levels in few 
collections. Delphinidin was the main anthocyanidin found, followed by 
petunidin, cyanidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, and peonidin. The wide variation 
observed in polyphenolic contents was more related to their genotype than to the 
color factor. These results show that some wild and weedy beans are good sources 
of phenolic compounds for use in breeding programs focused on nutrition and 
health.

Isoflavone phytoestrogens found in soybeans are the most widely studied 
phytochemicals in human diets and soy infant formulas. The health benefits of 
the isoflavones daidzein and genistein have been reported, and concerns about 
potential adverse effects have also been raised. However, the results of direct 
analysis of isoflavones and their metabolites in biological fluids after 
consumption of soy-containing diets are scarce. This study describes an LC/MS/MS 
method for the analysis of isoflavones and their metabolites in the urine of 
female rats fed diets made with soy protein isolate. Five isoflavones (daidzein, 
genistein, glycitein, dihydrodaidzein, and O-desmethylangolensin) were 
identified by comparison with authentic standards. Seventeen conjugates of 
isoflavones were characterized in the urine, the most unusual being genistein 
5-glucuronide and four glucuronide conjugates of reductive metabolites of 
daidzein. The application of LC/MS/MS to analyze isoflavone metabolites is 
simple and sensitive, and appears to be an excellent method for determining the 
bioavailability and metabolism of food phytochemistry.

Naringin is a flavonoid that exists in many plants and traditional Chinese 
medicines. In this study, a highly sensitive and specific electrospray 
ionization (ESI) liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) 
method was developed for quantification of naringin and its two metabolites, 
naringenin and naringenin glucuronide. Naringin and naringenin were extracted 
from rat plasma with ethyl acetate, using hesperidin as an internal standard. 
Components in the extract were separated on a 100 mm x 2.0 mm Betabasic 5 microm 
C18 ODS column by isocratic elution with 70% methanol. The components were 
analyzed in the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode in the precursor/product 
ion pair of m/z 581.3/273.4 for naringin, m/z 273.4/153.1 for naringenin and m/z 
611.5/303.4 for hesperidin, respectively. Linear calibration curves were 
obtained in the range of 5-1000 ng/ml, using 0.1 ml rat plasma. The within-day 
coefficients of variation (CVs) were 3.1, 1.8 and 2.2% for naringin, 3.0, 3.3, 
3.1% for naringenin at 5, 50 and 500 ng/ml (n=5). The between-day CVs were 3.4, 
1.7 and 4.9% for naringin and 4.0, 3.0, 4.6% for naringenin (n=5) at 5, 50 and 
500 ng/ml respectively. A formulation based on PEG400 was used and orally 
administered to Sprague-Dawley male rats. Plasma drug concentrations were 
measured by this method and the pharmacokinetics was analyzed by WinNonlin 
computer software. Plasma concentration-time profiles of naringin were found to 
increase quickly and decline rapidly within 2 h and could not be detected after 
24 h. Naringenin and naringenin glucuronide occurred slower and the T(max) were 
about 9 and 7.5 h later, respectively.

Roasting greatly reduces the phenolic content in green coffee beans. Considering 
the beneficial effects of coffee polyphenols, blends containing green coffee 
beans are being consumed as a healthier alternative to roasted coffee. This 
study was aimed at assessing the absorption and metabolism of hydroxycinnamates 
in an instant green/roasted (35/65) coffee blend in healthy humans. Twelve 
fasting men and women consumed a cup of coffee containing 269.5 mg (760.6 μmol) 
of chlorogenic acids. Blood and urine samples were taken before and after coffee 
consumption at different times and analyzed by LC-MS-QToF. Up to 25 and 42 
metabolites were identified in plasma and urine, respectively, mainly in the 
form of sulfate and methyl derivatives, and to a lower extent as glucuronides. 
Un-metabolized hydroxycinnamate esters (caffeoyl-, feruloyl-, and 
coumaroylquinic acids), hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic, ferulic and coumaric 
acids) and their phase II metabolites, in addition to phase II derivatives of 
lactones, represented a minor group of metabolites (16.3% of the metabolites 
excreted in urine) with kinetics compatible with small intestine absorption. 
Dihydrohydroxycinnamic acids and their phase II derivatives, in addition to 
feruloylglycine, showed delayed kinetics due to their colonic origin and 
represented the most abundant group of metabolites (75.7% of total urinary 
metabolites). Dihydrohydroxycinnamate esters (dihydroferuloyl-, dihydrocaffeoyl- 
and dihydrocoumaroylquinic acids) have been identified for the first time in 
both plasma and urine, with microbial origin (excreted 8-12 h after coffee 
intake) amounting to 8% of total urinary metabolites. In conclusion, coffee 
polyphenols are partially bioavailable and extensively metabolized, mainly by 
the colonic microbiota.

The market for decaffeinated coffees has been increasingly expanding over the 
years. Caffeine extraction may result in losses of other compounds such as 
chlorogenic acids (CGA) and, consequently, their 1,5-gamma-quinolactones (CGL) 
in roasted coffee. These phenolic compounds are important for flavor formation 
as well as the health effects of coffee; therefore, losses due to decaffeination 
need to be investigated. The present study evaluates the impact of 
decaffeination processing on CGA and CGL levels of green and roasted arabica 
coffees. Decaffeination produced a 16% average increase in the levels of total 
CGA in green coffee (dry matter), along with a 237% increase in CGL direct 
precursors. Different degrees of roasting showed average increments of 5.5-18% 
in CGL levels of decaffeinated coffee, compared to regular, a change more 
consistent with observed levels of total CGA than with those of CGL direct 
precursors in green samples. On the other hand, CGA levels in roasted coffee 
were 3-9% lower in decaffeinated coffee compared to regular coffee. Although 
differences in CGA and CGL contents of regular and decaffeinated roasted coffees 
appear to be relatively small, they may be enough to affect flavor 
characteristics as well as the biopharmacological properties of the final 
beverage, suggesting the need for further study.

Unbalanced diets generate oxidative stress commonly associated with the 
development of diabetes, atherosclerosis, obesity and cancer. Dietary flavonoids 
have antioxidant properties and may limit this stress and reduce the risk of 
these diseases. We used a metabolomic approach to study the influence of 
catechin, a common flavonoid naturally occurring in various fruits, wine or 
chocolate, on the metabolic changes induced by hyperlipidemic diets. Male Wistar 
rats ( n = 8/group) were fed during 6 weeks normolipidemic (5% w/w) or 
hyperlipidemic (15 and 25%) diets with or without catechin supplementation (0.2% 
w/w). Urines were collected at days 17 and 38 and analyzed by reverse-phase 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF). Hyperlipidic diets led to a 
significant increase of oxidative stress in liver and aorta, upon which catechin 
had no effect. Multivariate analyses (PCA and PLS-DA) of the urine fingerprints 
allowed discrimination of the different diets. Variables were then classified 
according to their dependence on lipid and catechin intake (ANOVA). Nine 
variables were identified as catechin metabolites of tissular or microbial 
origin. Around 1000 variables were significantly affected by the lipid content 
of the diet, and 76 were fully reversed by catechin supplementation. Four 
variables showing an increase in urinary excretion in rats fed the high-fat 
diets were identified as deoxycytidine, nicotinic acid, dihydroxyquinoline and 
pipecolinic acid. After catechin supplementation, the excretion of nicotinic 
acid was fully restored to the level found in the rats fed the low-fat diet. The 
physiological significance of these metabolic changes is discussed.

Anthocyanins are phenolic compounds widely distributed in fruits and vegetables. 
Their consumption has been shown to prevent some chronic diseases. Anthocyanin 
metabolism, however, is still not fully understood. The aim of this work was to 
evaluate the bioavailability of anthocyanins in humans consuming a meal 
containing strawberries and to identify possible metabolites in urine. Six 
healthy volunteers (three women and three men) consumed a meal containing 200 g 
strawberries (providing 179 micro mol pelargonidin-3-glucoside). Urine samples 
were collected before and after the meal and rapidly treated by solid-phase 
extraction. Identification and quantification of anthocyanin metabolites were 
carried out by HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC with UV-visible detection, respectively. 
In addition to pelargonidin-3-glucoside, five anthocyanin metabolites were 
identified in urine: three monoglucuronides of pelargonidin, one sulfoconjugate 
of pelargonidin and pelargonidin itself. Total urinary excretion of strawberry 
anthocyanin metabolites corresponded to 1.80 +/- 0.29% (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) of 
pelargonidin-3-glucoside ingested. More than 80% of this excretion was related 
to a monoglucuronide. Four hours after the meal, more than two-thirds of 
anthocyanin metabolites had been excreted, although urinary excretion of the 
metabolites continued until the end of the 24-h experiment. This study 
demonstrated that anthocyanins were glucuro- and sulfo-conjugated in humans and 
that the main metabolite of strawberry anthocyanins in human urine was a 
monoglucuronide of pelargonidin.

The consumption of anthocyanins has been shown to prevent certain chronic 
diseases. However, anthocyanin metabolism has not yet been fully elucidated. The 
aim of this study was to evaluate anthocyanin urinary excretion in humans 
receiving a meal containing blackberries and to identify possible metabolites in 
urine. Five healthy volunteers were fed 200 g of blackberries (960 mumol of 
anthocyanins). Urine samples were collected and rapidly treated by solid-phase 
extraction. Anthocyanin metabolites were identified and quantified by 
HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC with UV-vis detection, respectively. In addition to 
native cyanidin 3-glucoside, several other anthocyanin metabolites were 
identified in the urine: methylated glycosides, glucuronides of anthocyanidins 
and anthocyanins, a sulfoconjugate of cyanidin, and anthocyanidins. Total 
urinary excretion of blackberry anthocyanin metabolites was 0.160 +/- 0.020% (n 
= 5) of the amount of anthocyanins ingested. Monoglucuronides of anthocyanidins 
represented >60% of this excretion. Urinary excretion of anthocyanins was 
maximal between 2 and 4 h after the meal, but continued during the 24 h of the 
experiment. This study highlighted the influence of aglycon structure on 
anthocyanin urinary excretion. It demonstrated that anthocyanins are not only 
methylated but also glucuroconjugated and sulfoconjugated in humans and that the 
main metabolites of blackberry anthocyanins in human urine were anthocyanidin 
monoglucuronides.

Anthocyanins are natural pigments that could be involved in various health 
effects. Red oranges are an important dietary source of anthocyanins, including 
cyanidin 3-glucoside (Cy 3-glc) and an acylated derivative, cyanidin 
3-(6''-malonyl)-glucoside (Cy 3-malglc). The aim of this study was to evaluate 
the absorption and metabolism of red orange anthocyanins in rats fed an 
anthocyanin-enriched diet for 12 d (approximately 2.8 micromol anthocyanins/d). 
Furthermore, the absorption of these anthocyanins was studied in both the 
stomach and intestine using in situ models in rats. Anthocyanin metabolites were 
identified and quantified by HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem MS and 
HPLC-diode array detection, respectively. The red orange anthocyanins, Cy 3-glc 
and Cy 3-malglc, as well as their respective methylated derivatives, were 
recovered in urine after red orange juice intake. The 24 h urinary excretion of 
total anthocyanins was low (0.081 (SEM 0.009) % of the ingested amount). 
However, a high proportion (about 20 %) of red orange anthocyanins was absorbed 
from the stomach. More Cy 3-malglc than Cy 3-glc was absorbed in the intestine. 
This study thus indicated that red orange juice anthocyanins were rapidly 
absorbed from both stomach and small intestine, and then excreted in the urine 
as intact and methylated forms. Moreover, the absorption and metabolism of 
acylated anthocyanins and non-acylated anthocyanins were similar.

The mechanism of uptake of anthocyanins (as well as the type) from food in the 
intestine is not clear. Anthocyanin-rich extract from wild mulberry, composed of 
cyanidin-3-glucoside (79%) and cyanidin-3-rutinoside (cy-3-rut) (19%), was 
orally administered to Wistar rats, and their concentrations were determined in 
plasma, kidney, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The 2 glycosylated forms 
showed maximum concentration at 15 minutes after oral administration, both in 
plasma and kidney. The cyanidin-3-glucoside and cy-3-rut were found in plasma as 
glucuronides, as sulfates of cyanidin, and as unchanged forms. The area under 
the curve of concentration vs time (AUC(0-8h)) was 2.76 +/- 0.88 microg hour/mL 
and 9.74 +/- 0.75 microg hour/g for plasma and kidney, respectively. In spite of 
the low absorption, the increase in plasma anthocyanin level resulted in a 
significant increase in antioxidant capacity (P < .05). In the GI tract (stomach 
and small and large intestines), cyanidin glycosides were found unchanged, but a 
low amount of the aglycone form was present. Anthocyanin glycosides were no 
longer detected in the GI tract after 8 hours of administration. In vitro 
fermentation showed that the 2 cyanidin glycosides were totally metabolized by 
the rat colonic microflora, explaining their disappearance. In addition, the 2 
products of their degradation, cyanidin and protocatechuic acid, were not 
detected in plasma and probably do not influence plasma antioxidant capacity. As 
found by the everted sac model, anthocyanins were transported across the 
enterocyte by the sodium-dependent glucose transporter.

Anthocyanins are natural dietary pigments that could be involved in various 
health effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of 
anthocyanins to various organs (bladder, prostate, testes, heart and adipose 
tissue) in rats fed with a blackberry anthocyanin-enriched diet for 12 days. 
Identification and quantification of anthocyanins were carried out by HPLC-DAD. 
The urinary excretion of total anthocyanins (native anthocyanins and their 
metabolites) was low (0.20 +/- 0.03%, n = 8). Proportions of anthocyanin 
derivatives (methylated anthocyanins and glucurono-conjugated derivatives) 
differed according to the organ considered. The bladder contained the highest 
levels of anthocyanins followed by the prostate. Prostate, testes and heart 
contained native cyanidin 3-glucoside and a small proportion of cyanidin 
monoglucuronide. Cyanidin 3-glucoside and methylated derivatives were present in 
adipose tissue. Thus, anthocyanin feeding in rats resulted in a wide 
distribution of anthocyanin derivatives to several organs. Identification of 
target tissues of anthocyanins may then help to understand the mechanisms of 
action of anthocyanins in vivo.

In this study, the effects of three common cooking practices (i.e., boiling, 
steaming, and frying) on the artichoke phenolic compounds pattern were evaluated 
by LC-MS/MS analysis. The variation of carotenoids, antioxidant capacity, and 
artichoke physical properties after cooking was also investigated. The major 
phenolic compounds present in the raw sample were 5- O-caffeoylquinic and 
1,5-di- O-caffeoylquinic acids; after cooking treatments, an increase of the 
overall caffeoylquinic acids concentration due to the formation of different 
dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers was observed. Steamed and fried samples showed 
similar patterns of dicaffeoylquinic concentrations, which were higher with 
respect to the boiled samples. On the other hand, all cooking practices, 
particularly frying, decreased flavonoid concentration. The antioxidant capacity 
of cooked artichokes, measured by three different assays, enormously increased 
after cooking, particularly after steaming (up to 15-fold) and boiling (up to 
8-fold). The observed cooking effect on the artichoke antioxidant profile is 
probably due to matrix softening and increased extractability of compounds, but 
the increase of antioxidant capacity is much higher than the increase of 
antioxidant concentration. These results suggest that some common cooking 
treatments can be used to enhance the nutritional value of vegetables, 
increasing bioaccessibility of health-promoting constituents.

A field experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of fertilization 
level on the phenolic composition of tronchuda cabbage ( Brassica oleracea L. 
var. costata DC) external and internal leaves. Eight different plots were 
constituted: a control without fertilization, one with organic matter, and six 
experiments with conventional fertilizers (nitrogen, boron, and sulfur, two 
levels each). The phenolic compounds were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC-DAD. 
External and internal leaves revealed distinct qualitative composition. In the 
internal leaves were found 15 phenolics (5 kaempferol and 10 cinnamic acid 
derivatives), whereas the external leaves presented 3- p-coumaroylquinic acid 
and 13 kaempferol derivatives. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to 
assess the relationships between phenolic compounds, agronomical practices, and 
harvesting time. Samples obtained with conventional practices were quite 
effectively separated from organic samples, for both types of leaves. In 
general, samples developed without any fertilization presented the highest 
phenolics amounts: external and internal leaves contained 1.4- and 4.6-fold more 
phenolic compounds than the ones that received conventional fertilizer, 
respectively, and the internal leaves presented 2.4 times more phenolics than 
the ones grown with organic amendment. Additionally, samples from organic 
production exhibited higher total phenolics content than those from conventional 
practices, collected at the same time. Samples harvested first were revealed to 
be distinct from the ones collected later. The results show that it is possible 
to grow tronchuda cabbage without excess fertilizers, with highest amounts of 
phenolics and reduced environment contamination.

The present study explored the bioavailability and brain deposition of a grape 
seed polyphenolic extract (GSPE) previously found to attenuate cognitive 
deterioration in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma 
pharmacokinetic response of major GSPE phenolic components was measured 
following intragastric gavage of 50, 100, and 150 mg GSPE per kg body weight. 
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis identified gallic acid 
(GA), catechin (C), and epicatechin (EC) in plasma of rats gavaged acutely with 
GSPE. Additionally, 4-methylgallic acid (4-OMeGA), 3'-methylcatechin (3'-OMeC), 
and 3'-methylepicatechin (3'-OMeEC) were identified as circulating metabolites 
of GSPE phenolic constituents. Cmax for individual GSPE constituents and their 
metabolites increased in a dose-dependent fashion (with increasing GSPE oral 
dose). Repeated daily exposure to GSPE was found to significantly increase 
bioavailability (defined as plasma AUC0-8h) of GA, C, and EC by 198, 253, and 
282% relative to animals receiving only a single acute GSPE dose. EC and C were 
not detectable in brain tissues of rats receiving a single GSPE dose but reached 
levels of 290.7 +/-45.9 and 576.7 +/- 227.7 pg/g in brain tissues from rats 
administered GSPE for 10 days. This study suggests that brain deposition of GA, 
C, and EC is affected by repeated dosing of GSPE.

The simultaneous determination of 19 phenolic compounds was performed directly 
in wort and beer by a combination of reverse-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography coupled with coulometric array detection. Chromatographic 
separation was achieved with an appropriate gradient of flow and a binary 
solvent based on phosphate buffer, methanol, and acetonitrile in a 45-min run. 
Eight serial coulometric detectors were used for on-line generation of 
voltammetric data to resolve coeluting compounds. The method was reliable and 
sensitive, the regression coefficient of standard calibration curves is 0.972 < 
or = r < or = 1.000, and the standard deviation value ranges from 0.010 to 0.129 
mg/L for wort and from 0.002 to 0.332 mg/L for beer. The mean concentrations of 
phenolic acids were 22.1 and 33.8 mg/L, respectively, in worts and beers 
produced in Italy. These amounts represent 5 and 10% of the non-tannic, 
non-flavonoid phenols in wort and beer, respectively.

In vitro studies show that some individual minor polar phenolic compounds (MPC) 
present in virgin olive oil prevent oxidation of human low-density lipoproteins 
(LDL), but few data are available on the antioxidant effect of whole oil 
extract. Thus, whole virgin olive extracts were studied to determine whether 
they maintain the antioxidant activity and whether this last is linked to MPC 
composition of a single virgin oil. Using HPLC-DAD the MPC content in Taggiasca 
and Seggianese virgin olive oils was measured. Taggiasca oil was less rich in 
total MPC (208.5 mg/L) than Seggianese oil (441.9 mg/L). In addition, the major 
compounds of Taggiasca oil were lignan derivatives, whereas the major compounds 
in Seggianese oils were secoiridoid derivatives. Moreover, Taggiasca oil was 
practically free of 5-hydroxytyrosol and 5-hydroxytyrosol derivatives, 
deacetoxy-oleuropein aglycone and oleuropein aglycone. The antioxidant activity 
of the oils on human LDL was evaluated by measuring malondialdehyde and 
conjugate diene generation induced by copper ions. In both tests, the oil 
extracts dose-dependently reduced malondialdehyde and conjugate diene 
generation. Moreover, antioxidant potency correlated with total MPC; thus, 
Seggianese extract was more active. The two oils differed quantitatively and 
qualitatively, and these differences influenced their biological activities; 
thus clinical trials focused on studying the effects of olive oils should 
specify the oils used.

A fast, precise and selective diode array HPLC method is presented for the 
extraction and analysis of soy isoflavonoids from foods and from human urine, 
plasma, and breast milk in support of mechanistic and epidemiologic studies 
assessing the potential cancer protective role of soya or isoflavones. Solid

hydrolysis procedures were used for aglycone production depending on the matrix 
to be analyzed. C-18 reversed-phase HPLC was applied to selectively separate and 
quantitate daidzein (1), glycitein (3), and genistein (4), including their 
malonyl (a) and acetyl (b) esters, and their mammalian metabolites equol (6) and 
O-desmethylangolensin (7), as well as formononetin (2), biochanin-A (5), and 
coumestrol (8) using a gradient elution system. UV absorbance scans and 
authentic standards were applied for identification purposes, additional to 
fluorometric monitoring, electrochemical detection, and GC/ MS analysis after 
trimethyl silylation. Detection limits of 20-microl injections were found to be 
1.09, 0.53, 3.28, and 1.00 pmoles for daidzein, genistein, equol, and 
O-desmethylangolensin (DMA), respectively, by monitoring at the individual 
compound's absorption maximum. The proposed method was applied to monitor 
isoflavone levels in soy foods and in human plasma, urine and breast milk after 
challenge with roasted soybeans. Implications of the presented results on the 
potential activity of isoflavones to prevent cancer by exposing newborn infants 
to these agents are discussed.

Concentrations and glucosidic conjugation patterns of isoflavones were 
determined in soy foods consumed by multiethnic populations in Singapore and 
Hawaii. Six raw and 11 cooked food groups traditionally consumed in Singapore 
and 8 food groups consumed in Hawaii were analyzed by reversed-phase 
high-pressure liquid chromatography with diode array detection. Mean total 
isoflavone levels varied between 35 and 7500 ppm, with the lowest values found 
in soy milk and burgers and the highest levels observed in soybean and its seeds 
and in supplements. Total isoflavone levels and conjugation patterns varied as a 
function of soybean variety, storage conditions, and food processing. A large 
contribution to the differences in total isoflavone content between food groups 
was due to the water content in foods and to leaching of polar analytes into the 
water phase during boiling. Soy protein drinks and traditional soy foods were 
found to possess very similar isoflavone amounts considering usual serving 
sizes.

Seven healthy females and six males consumed daily 256 mg of vitamin C, 271 mg 
of flavanones (mainly as glycosides), 6 mg of carotenoids (mainly xanthophylls 
and cryptoxanthins), and 0.16 mg of folate by incorporation of daily three times 
236 mL of not from concentrate orange juice (OJ) into their habitual diet. At 
the end of 3 weeks, mean vitamin C, folate, carotenoid, and flavanone plasma 
concentrations increased significantly relative to baseline by 59% (p < 0.001), 
46% (p = 0.018), and 22% (p < 0.001), and 8-fold (p = 0.045), respectively. 
Flavanones were excreted in urine 9-fold more at the end of the intervention (p 
= 0.01) but returned to baseline 2 days after study completion. After the 3 week 
intervention, plasma concentrations of vitamins A and E did not change. 
8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine in white blood cells declined by 16% (p = 0.38; n = 11), 
and in individuals with high baseline concentrations by 29% (p = 0.36; n = 7), 
respectively. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-/high-density lipoprotein 
(HDL)-cholesterol ratios decreased but cholesterol (HDL, LDL, total) and 
thiobarbituric acid reactive substance plasma concentrations did not change 
significantly. We conclude from this pilot study that OJ is an excellent food 
source to enhance circulating concentrations of valuable hydrophilic as well as 
lipophilic phytochemicals.

Toronto, Ontario M5S 1B2, CANADA.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between 
dietary intake of phytoestrogens estimated by a food frequency questionnaire 
(FFQ) with urinary metabolites.
METHODS: Participants were 26 premenopausal, Caucasian women aged 25 to 42 
years. Dietary intake of isoflavones (genistein and daidzein) and lignans 
(secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol) were estimated by a 53-item 
interviewer-administered FFQ on two occasions, reflecting 'habitual' (previous 2 
months) and 'recent' (previous 2 days) dietary intake. Isoflavone (genistein, 
daidzein) and lignan (enterolactone, enterodiol and secoisolariciresinol) 
concentrations were measured in 24-hour urine samples by gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry. Correlations between FFQ (habitual and recent, separately) and 
urinary metabolite values were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients.
RESULTS: Mean habitual isoflavone and lignan intakes were 13.7 mg/day and 13.8 
mg/day, respectively. Mean urinary concentrations of isoflavones and lignans 
were 17.4 micromol/day and 20.6 micromol/day, respectively. Recent and habitual 
isoflavone intakes were correlated with urinary excretion of metabolites (r = 
0.64, p < 0.001 and r = 0.54, p = 0.004, respectively). Urinary excretion of 
lignans was also modestly correlated with recent and habitual lignan intakes (r 
= 0.46, p = 0.02 and r = 0.40, p = 0.05, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of this FFQ as a measure of dietary 
isoflavone and lignan intake in epidemiological studies.

It has been suggested that the isoflavone, genistein,, may have some role as a 
chemopreventive agent against cancer in humans. Levels of genistein and its 
beta-glucoside conjugate, genistin, ingested in soybeans and related bean 
products by the Japanese were quantified by HPLC, to estimate daily intake of 
these compounds. Amounts of genistein and genistin in soybeans, soy nuts and soy 
powder were in the range of 4.6 to 18.2 and 200.6 to 968.1 micrograms/g food, 
respectively. The values for soy milk and tofu (bean curd) were 1.9 to 13.9 and 
94.8 to 137.7 micrograms/g food, respectively. Levels of isoflavones in 
fermented soybean products, miso (bean paste) and natto (fermented soybeans), 
were 38.5 to 229.1 micrograms/g food for genistein and 71.7 to 492.8 
micrograms/g food for genistin. Thus, the level of genistein in the fermented 
soybean products was higher than in soy beans and soybean products such as soy 
milk and tofu. From these observations, it is suggested that the beta-glycosyl 
bond of genistin is cleaved to produce genistein by microbes during fermentation 
to yield miso and natto. Soy sauce was also found to contain both isoflavones, 
but at levels lower than in miso and natto. On the basis of these data for 
average annual consumption of soybeans and related products, daily intake of 
genistein and genistin by the Japanese is calculated to be 1.5-4.1 and 6.3-8.3 
mg/person, respectively. These levels are much higher than those for Americans 
or Western Europeans, whose mortality rates for breast, colon and prostate 
cancers are greater than the Japanese.

The aim of the presented work was to study the effect of pressing method, 
pasteurization, cultivar, and vintage on the content of (+)-catechin, 
(-)-epicatechin, and nine procyanidins in grape juice. The results showed that 
the concentration of these flavan-3-ols in the juice was influenced, in 
decreasing order of importance, by pressing method, cultivar, pasteurization, 
and vintage. Cold pressing without maceration was the least and hot pressing 
after maceration at 60 degrees C for 60 min the most effective method for 
extracting the flavan-3-ols. Pasteurization increased the concentration of 
catechins in cold-pressed juices, but it decreased concentrations in hot-pressed 
juices. The concentration of most procyanidins was increased by pasteurization. 
Among the white cultivars, Seyval and Niagara were highest in procyanidins and 
Elvira and Chardonnay were highest in catechins. Vincent, Foch, and Baco were 
the red cultivars highest in catechins, and Vincent also had the highest content 
of procyanidins.

Paulo, Av. Prof. Lineu Prestes 580, Bloco 14, 05508-900 São Paulo, SP, Brazil.

Seed coats and cotyledons from 25 Brazilian and 3 Peruvian bean cultivars were 
investigated in relation to their phenolic profiles and antioxidant capacity. 
Condensed tannins, anthocyanins, and flavonols such as kaempferol and quercetin 
glycosides were mostly found in seed coats. Cotyledons were rich in phenolic 
acids, such as ferulic, sinapic, chlorogenic, and other hydroxycinnamic acids. 
In general, the seed coat color pattern and the type of cultivar showed an 
important influence on the variability of phenolic profiles and levels, 
respectively. Total phenolics and antioxidant capacity assessed by the DPPH 
method were higher in seed coats than in cotyledons. The antioxidant capacity 
had a significant correlation with condensed tannins for all samples and with 
total anthocyanins in black and red seed coats, whereas in cotyledons, it was 
more related to the total phenolic content.

Analysis of phenolics and flavonoids in juice beverages using reversed-phase 
HPLC with coulometric array detection is described. Sixteen serial coulometric 
detectors were used for on-line resolution of co-eluting compounds and 
generation of voltammetric data. Within each class of compounds, oxidation 
potential corresponded to specific substitution patterns where: catechol < 
methoxycatechol < monohydroxyl < methoxyl. Twenty-seven standard compounds were 
resolved in a 45-min run. The limits of detection were in the low ng/ml range 
with a linear response range of at least three orders of magnitude. Intra-run 
retention time variation was < 1% (R.S.D.) and adjacent sensor response ratios 
varied by < 5% (R.S.D.). The utility of this technique in generating 
multivariate data for differentiation of juices and juice mixtures is shown.

The concentrations of trans-resveratrol, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and 
quercetin were evaluated by means of high-performance liquid 
chromatography-diode array detection in red wines obtained from Aglianico, 
Piedirosso, and Nerello Mascalese grapes. The trans-resveratrol and epicatechin 
concentrations did not differ significantly between experimental wines. The 
concentration of quercetin in Nerello Mascalese wines was more than twice that 
observed in Aglianico and Piedirosso wines. Nerello Mascalese wines also 
significantly differed from other wines in the (+)-catechin content, which was 
significantly higher than those found in the other two wines. During maceration, 
the maximum extraction of trans-resveratrol was reached after 12 days for 
Aglianico and Piedirosso, after which a decline was observed. On the contrary, 
in the case of Nerello Mascalese, the concentration of trans-resveratrol 
increased steadily throughout the whole maceration process. After 2 days of 
maceration, the maximum concentration of quercetin was observed in Aglianico 
must, whereas the maximum quercetin extraction was reached after 12 days for 
Piedirosso and 17 days for Nerello Mascalese. The maximum levels of (+)-catechin 
and (-)-epicatechin were generally observed after 12 days of maceration for all 
wines, although a decline of (-)-epicatechin occurred after maximum extraction 
in Aglianico and Piedirosso wines. Following marc pressing, a significant 
increase in the concentration of trans-resveratrol for Aglianico, (+)-catechin 
and (-)-epicatechin for Piedirosso, and (-)-epicatechin for Nerello Mascalese 
was observed.

University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.

A simple, rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy 
(LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of ethyl 
gallate, a pharmacologically active constituent isolated from Lagerstroemia 
speciosa (Linn.) Pers. This method was used to examine the pharmacokinetics of 
ethyl gallate and its major metabolite gallic acid in rat plasma using propyl 
gallate as an internal standard. After precipitation of the plasma proteins with 
acetonitrile, the analytes were separated on a Zorbax SB-C(18) column (3.5 
microm, 2.1 x 50 mm) with an isocratic mobile phase consisted of 
methanol-acetonitrile-10 mM ammonium acetate (10 : 25 : 65, v/v/v) containing 
0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. The Agilent G6410A triple 
quadrupole LC/MS system was operated under the multiple-reaction monitoring mode 
using the electrospray ionization technique in negative mode. The lower limits 
of quantification of gallic acid and ethyl gallate of the method were 0.5 and 
1.0 ng/mL. The intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision of the assay were 
less than 8.0%. This method has been applied successfully to a pharmacokinetic 
study involving the intragastric administration of ethyl gallate to rats.

Reversed-phase liquid chromatography with electrospray 
ionization-high-resolution/accuracy Fourier transform mass spectrometry 
(RPC-ESI-FTMS) and chemometrics were exploited to evaluate the influence of 
horizontal centrifugation by two- or three-phase decanters on the content of 
major phenolic secoiridoids in extravirgin olive oils (EVOOs). Despite the 
occurrence of other potential sources of variability typical of commercial olive 
oils, horizontal centrifugation was found to play a primary role, with a general 
increase of secoiridoid content occurring when two-phase decanters were used. As 
emphasized by principal component analysis (PCA), the increase involved 
preferentially oleacin and oleocanthal, when oxidative deterioration was 
purposely minimized during and/or after production, and oleuropein and 
ligstroside aglycones, when no vertical centrifugation was performed at the end 
of the productive cycle. The influence of the type of horizontal centrifugation 
was also emphasized by the elaboration of RPC-ESI-FTMS data based on 
hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

Epidemiological studies suggest that a moderate consumption of anthocyanins may 
be associated with protection against coronary heart disease. The main dietary 
sources of anthocyanins include red-coloured fruits and red wine. Although 
dietary anthocyanins comprise a diverse mixture of molecules, little is known 
how structural diversity relates to their bioavailability and biological 
function. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the absorption and 
metabolism of the 3-monoglucosides of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin 
and malvidin in humans and to examine both the effect of consuming a red wine 
extract on plasma antioxidant status and on monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 
production in healthy human subjects. After a 12-h overnight fast, seven healthy 
volunteers received 12 g of an anthocyanin extract and provided 13 blood samples 
in the 24 h following the test meal. Furthermore, urine was collected during 
this 24-h period. Anthocyanins were detected in their intact form in both plasma 
and urine samples. Other anthocyanin metabolites could also be detected in 
plasma and urine and were identified as glucuronides of peonidin and malvidin. 
Anthocyanins and their metabolites appeared in plasma about 30 min after 
ingestion of the test meal and reached their maximum value around 1.6 h later 
for glucosides and 2.5 h for glucuronides. Total urinary excretion of red wine 
anthocyanins was 0.05+/-0.01% of the administered dose within 24 h. About 94% of 
the excreted anthocyanins was found in urine within 6 h. In spite of the low 
concentration of anthocyanins found in plasma, an increase in the antioxidant 
capacity and a decrease in MCP-1 circulating levels in plasma were observed.

Wheat bran contains several ester-linked dehydrodimers of ferulic acid, which 
were detected and quantified after sequential alkaline hydrolysis. The major 
dimers released were: 
trans-5-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-7-methoxy-2, 3- 
dihydrobenzofuran-3-carboxylic acid (5-8-BendiFA), 
(Z)-beta-[4-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-methoxyphenoxy]-4-hydroxy-3-methox ycinnamic 
acid (8-O-4-diFA) and (E,E)-4,4'-dihydroxy-5,5'-dimethoxy-3,3'-bicinnamic acid 
(5-5-diFA). trans-7-hydroxy-1-(4-hydroxy-3methoxyphenyl)-6-methoxy-1,2-dihydro - 
naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (8-8-diFA cyclic form) and 
4,4'-dihydroxy-3,3'-dimethoxy-beta,beta'-bicinnamic acid (8-8-diFA non cyclic 
form) were not detected. One of the most abundant dimers, 8-O-4-diFA, was 
purified from de-starched wheat bran after alkaline hydrolysis and preparative 
HPLC. The resultant product was identical to the chemically synthesised 
8-O-4-dimer by TLC and HPLC as confirmed by 1H-NMR and mass spectrometry. The 
absorption maxima and absorption coefficients for the synthetic compound in 
ethanol were: lambda max: 323 nm, lambda min: 258 nm, epsilon lambda max (M-1 
cm-1): 24,800 +/- 2100 and epsilon 280 (M-1 cm-1): 19,700 +/- 1100. The 
antioxidant properties of 8-O-4-diFA were assessed using: (a) inhibition of 
ascorbate/iron-induced peroxidation of phosphatidylcholine liposomes and; (b) 
scavenging of the radical cation of 2,2'-azinobis 
(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) relative to the water-soluble 
vitamin E analogue, Trolox C. The 8-O-4-diFA was a better antioxidant than 
ferulic acid in both lipid and aqueous phases. This is the first report of the 
antioxidant activity of a natural diferulate obtained from a plant.

The application of hydrostatic high pressure on an industrial line of nectarine 
(Prunus persica L.) purées was assessed in comparison with the traditional 
thermal treatment of pasteurization. Changes after thermal processing (85 °C, 5 
min) and after high-pressure processing (HPP: 450 or 600 MPa for 5 or 10 min) 
and during the refrigerated storage (60 d) of an industrially produced nectarine 
purée were evaluated. Conventional heat pasteurization as well as HPP showed 
similar microorganisms' inactivation and maintained the microbial stability of 
purées until the end of the refrigerated storage (60 d). In general, thermally 
treated purée and HP-treated purée at 600 MPa showed more intense color changes 
after processing than the other treatment. In addition, thermally treated purée 
showed more intense color changes during storage than HPP. The highest 
carotenoids extractability was found in those purées treated at the lowest 
high-pressure-treatment intensity and holding time (450 MPa/5 min), but at the 
end of the storage (day 60), no differences in individual or total carotenoid 
levels were found between the purées. HPP at 600 MPa/10 min showed the highest 
polyphenols content after the treatment and during the storage. At day 0, 
significantly higher values were found of total antioxidant activity in purée 
HP-treated at 450 MPa/10 min than in untreated purée; while at the end of the 
storage, HP-treated purée at 600 MPa/10 min had the highest antioxidant 
activity. Hydrostatic high-pressure application in the industrial line of 
nectarine purée presented some advantages compared to the thermal treatment; 
however, some of the changes found were lessen during the storage period. In 
addition, more studies need to be carried out for HP-treatment intensity 
optimization.

Anthocyanins represent the most abundant class of bioactive compounds present in 
Vaccinium myrtillus L. (bilberry) fruit, conferring it several health-promoting 
properties. The content of anthocyanins in food products produced from 
bilberries can be affected by many parameters, making the study of their 
composition a critical issue. In this ambit, this work was aimed at a 
comprehensive profiling of anthocyanins in bilberry fruit and derivatives from 
the Italian Northern Apennines, including jam, juice, and liqueur 
(""Mirtillino""). Anthocyanins were extracted from the jams by means of a dynamic 
maceration with acidified methanol, while juice and liqueurs were directly 
analyzed. The analysis of anthocyanins in the extracts was carried out by means 
of HPLC-UV/DAD, HPLC-ESI-MS, and MS2, under gradient elution. As a comparison, 
authentic bilberry fruits were analyzed. The total anthocyanin content was in 
the range 582.4-795.2 mg/100 g (FW) for the fruit, 2.3-234.5 mg/100 g for the 
jams, 109.2-2252.2 mg/L for the juice, and 27.9-759.3 mg/L for the liqueurs. To 
deeper investigate the anthocyanin profile of the liqueurs that exhibited a 
remarkably different composition in comparison with the other products, an 
authentic bilberry liqueur was prepared in the lab, following a traditional 
recipe, and monitored weakly by HPLC. The percentage of degradation of 
3-O-galactosides and 3-O-arabinosides of bilberry anthocyanidins was found to be 
higher than that of 3-O-glucosides. The results of this work demonstrated the 
importance of a suitable and reliable analysis of bilberry fruit and related 
food products to ensure their genuineness and quality. Graphical abstract

Propolis has various biological activities such as antibacterial, antiviral, 
antioxidant, immunostimulating and antiinflammatory, which are generally 
ascribed to the polyphenolic fraction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
absorption of the main polyphenols [caffeic acid (CA), pinobanksin-5methyl ether 
(P-5ME), pinobanksin (Pb), chrysin (C), pinocembrin (P), galangin (G), 
pinobanksin-3-acetate, pinobanksin esters and caffeic acid phenylethyl ester 
(CAPE)] from a dewaxed and standardized extract of propolis (EPID). Fifteen 
healthy volunteers consumed 5 mL EPID in water, corresponding to 125 mg of 
flavonoids. Blood samples were collected before, each hour for 8 h and 24 h 
after EPID intake. After deconjugation by beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase the 
plasma samples were analyzed by a selective liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method using morin as internal standard (I.S.). A 
kinetic profile characterized by two t(max), respectively at 1 h and about 5 h 
post-ingestion, was observed in all the subjects. The two peaks may be due to 
enterohepatic cycling. Among the various polyphenols ingested, only P-5ME, Pb, 
C, P and G were detected in plasma and C(max)t(1h) were 65.7 +/- 13.3, 46.5 +/- 
12.7, 79.5 +/- 18.6, 168.1 +/- 16.3 and 113.7 +/- 16.8 ng/mL, respectively. 
These levels decreased significantly after 8 h and were no longer detectable 24 
h after EPID intake. The recovery of the extraction for CA, Pb, C, P, G and I.S. 
from spiked plasma was 95.2 +/- 3.1, 93.1 +/- 3.6, 91 +/- 2.5, 96.4 +/- 4.2, 
93.4 +/- 2.4 and 85.5 +/- 2.4%, respectively. The results of this study evidence 
that flavonoids from EPID are absorbed, metabolized and Pb-5ME and G seem to 
have apparent absorption, measured as (AUC/dose), higher than C, P and Pb.

We have determined the absorption, conjugation and excretion of 
naringenin-7-O-rutinoside (narirutin) compared to the corresponding glucoside in 
an orange juice matrix in human subjects. Healthy volunteers (eight men and 
eight women), in a double blind, randomised, crossover study, consumed orange 
juice with (1) natural content of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside; (2) 
alpha-rhamnosidase-treated to yield naringenin-7-O-glucoside. Blood was sampled 
at twelve time points and three fractions of urine were collected over 24 h. The 
area under the plasma-time curve of naringenin from (2) 
alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice was increased about 4-fold (P < 0.0001), 
peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 5.4-fold higher (P < 0.0001) and Tmax was 
decreased from 311 to 92 min (P = 0.002) compared to untreated orange juice (1), 
indicating a change in absorption site from the colon to the small intestine. 
Furthermore, the amount in urine was increased from 7 to 47 % (P < 0.0001) of 
the dose after consumption of the alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice (2). 
All urine samples contained both naringenin-7- and -4'-O-glucuronides. In 
addition, to examine the effect of dose and alpha-rhamnosidase treatment on 
hesperetin conjugate profiles, a further treatment where (3) orange juice 
fortified with three times the original content of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside was 
used. Five hesperetin metabolites (3'-O-glucuronide; 7-O-glucuronide; 
5,7-O-diglucuronide; 3',7-O-diglucuronide; 3'-O-sulphate) were present after all 
treatments (1-3), with the same profile of the conjugates. The present data show 
that bioavailability of naringenin is increased by conversion from rutinoside to 
glucoside, but the profile of the conjugates of flavanones formed and excreted 
in urine is neither affected by the absorption site nor by a 3-fold change in 
dose.

In the extracts of fresh raw and frozen broccoli, caffeic, ferulic, sinapinic 
acids and kaempferol were identified. Boiling reduced the amounts of caffeic 
acid and kaempferol in both samples. The concentration of polyphenols was 
2.69mg/g fresh mass and 0.96mg/fresh mass in fresh raw broccoli and frozen raw 
broccoli, respectively. Boiling significantly decreased the amounts of phenolic 
compounds in fresh broccoli (1.58mg/g of fresh mass). In the case of frozen 
broccoli, boiling increased the concentration of polyphenols by 38%. Fresh 
broccoli extract neutralized free radicals by 19.87%. Boiling significantly 
reduced its antiradical activity (to 15.06%). Samples of frozen broccoli had a 
27.06% antiradical ability. Boiling did not change the antiradical activity in 
frozen broccoli case. Hydrothermal processing significantly influenced on the 
ability of the extracts to inhibit the decolorization of β-carotene emulsion. 
The extract of fresh broccoli had a higher activity when uncooked. Boiling 
seemed to increase this activity in the case of frozen broccoli samples. The 
results of the studies on the ability of broccoli extracts to inhibit linoleic 
acid autooxidation were ambiguous and depended on the method applied. No 
correlation was found between the content of phenolic compounds and the 
antioxidant activity of the extracts, regardless of the experimental variant and 
technique used.

Flavonoid and carbohydrate contents in Tropea red onions: effects of homelike 
peeling and storage.

The content of anthocyanins, flavonols, and carbohydrates of Tropea red onions 
(Allium cepa L.) was determined by HPLC and HPLC-MS. Cyanidin derivatives 
constitute >50% of total anthocyanins, but delphinidin and petunidin 
derivatives, which have not been reported in red onions thus far, were also 
detected. The flavonoid distribution in the different layers of the bulbs 
indicates that, after homelike peeling, the edible portion contains 79% of the 
total content of quercetin 4'-glucoside but only 27% of the anthocyanins. 
Storage of onions for 6 weeks in different conditions, all of them mimicking 
home storage habits, resulted in a decrease to 64-73% of total anthocyanins. The 
same trend was verified for the total antioxidant activity, which was reduced to 
29-36%. A decrease in glucose and fructose content correlated with anthocyanin 
degradation was also observed. Storage at low temperature seems to better 
preserve the onion anthocyanins.

Antioxidant Activity of Different Phenolic Fractions Separated from an Italian 
Red Wine.

Capponi 9, 50121 Firenze, Italy.

Using liquid/liquid extraction, three fractions were obtained from an Italian 
red wine containing single polyphenolic subfractions: (1) phenolic acids and 
quercetin-3-glucuronide, (2) catechins and quercetin-3-glucoside, and (3) 
anthocyanins. Beside the scavenging capacity of the different fractions against 
hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals, the in vitro inhibition of low density 
lipoprotein oxidation and platelet aggregation (two main events in the 
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis) were tested. The antioxidant activity of the 
fractions has been compared with that of the original red wine before and after 
dealcoholization. The anthocyanin fraction was the most effective both in 
scavenging reactive oxygen species and in inhibiting lipoprotein oxidation and 
platelet aggregation. This higher activity can be explained by both its high 
concentration in red wine and its antioxidant efficiency, which, at least for 
peroxyl radical scavenging, was three times as high as that of the other two 
fractions. Our results suggest that anthocyanins could be the key component in 
red wine in light of the protection against cardiovascular diseases, although 
this hypothesis needs in vivo evidence.

capacity and phenol content on extraction features.

BACKGROUND: Aqueous extracts of most medicinal plants traditionally employed in 
Portugal (at the ratio of 1 g plant: 110 mL water) have been assayed for total 
antioxidant capacity and phenol content, in order to elucidate their claimed 
medicinal features.
RESULTS: The antioxidant activity was assessed by the ABTS(•+) method; the 
ascorbic acid equivalent values ranged from 1.4280 ± 0.1261 g L(-1) for avocado 
(Persea americana (Lauraceae)) obtained by infusion of powder, down to 0.0027 ± 
0.0012 g L(-1) for olive (Olea europaea (Oleaceae)) obtained by infusion of 
leaves. Total phenol content was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure; 
the gallic acid equivalent values ranged from 0.5541 ± 0.0289 g L(-1) for 
avocado obtained by infusion of powder, down to 0.0053 ± 0.0014 g L(-1) for 
olive obtained by boiling leaves. A good correlation between total antioxidant 
capacity and total phenol content was found.
CONCLUSION: The method of powder infusion should be chosen if high concentration 
of antioxidants are sought. On the other hand, a high antioxidant capacity and a 
high phenol content correlate well with the empirically established (and widely 
publicised) capacity to treat respiratory infections. Copyright © 2007 Society

The effect of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) and cooking on the flavonoids 
and vitamin C content (ascorbic + dehydroascorbic acid; AA + DHAA) of fresh-cut 
spinach was evaluated. The total flavonoid content (approximately 1000 mg 
kg(-)(1) f.w.) remained quite constant during storage in both air and MAP 
atmospheres, while vitamin C (750 mg kg(-)(1)f.w.) was better preserved in 
MAP-stored spinach. AA was transformed to DHAA during storage, and its 
concentration was higher in MAP-stored tissues. The free-radical scavenging 
activity of the isolated flavonoids was tested, and only those flavonoids with 
either a dihydroxyl grouping or acylated with ferulic acid showed significant 
activity. A decrease in the total antioxidant activity was observed during 
storage, particularly important in MAP-stored spinach. The higher content of 
DHAA and lower content of both AA and antioxidant flavonoids in the MAP-stored 
samples could explain this antioxidant activity decrease. Boiling extracted 50% 
of total flavonoids and 60% vitamin C in the cooking water. However, flavonoid 
glucuronides were extracted more in the cooking water than the other glycosides. 
The vitamin C content of the cooked tissue was higher in those samples stored in 
MAP.

Antioxidant activity of pomegranate juice and its relationship with phenolic 
composition and processing.

The antioxidant activity of pomegranate juices was evaluated by four different 
methods (ABTS, DPPH, DMPD, and FRAP) and compared to those of red wine and a 
green tea infusion. Commercial pomegranate juices showed an antioxidant activity 
(18-20 TEAC) three times higher than those of red wine and green tea (6-8 TEAC). 
The activity was higher in commercial juices extracted from whole pomegranates 
than in experimental juices obtained from the arils only (12-14 TEAC). HPLC-DAD 
and HPLC-MS analyses of the juices revealed that commercial juices contained the 
pomegranate tannin punicalagin (1500-1900 mg/L) while only traces of this 
compound were detected in the experimental juice obtained from arils in the 
laboratory. This shows that pomegranate industrial processing extracts some of 
the hydrolyzable tannins present in the fruit rind. This could account for the 
higher antioxidant activity of commercial juices compared to the experimental 
ones. In addition, anthocyanins, ellagic acid derivatives, and hydrolyzable 
tannins were detected and quantified in the pomegranate juices.

Hand-squeezed navel orange juice contains 839 mg/L phenolics, including 
flavanones, flavones, and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. The flavanones are 
the main phenolics in the soluble fraction (648.6 mg/L) and are also present in 
the cloud fraction (104.8 mg/L). During refrigerated storage of fresh juice (4 
degrees C), 50% of the soluble flavanones precipitate and integrate into the 
cloud fraction. Commercial orange juices contain only 81-200 mg/L soluble 
flavanones (15-33%) and the content in the cloud is higher (206-644 mg/L) 
(62-85%), showing that during industrial processing and storage the soluble 
flavanones precipitate and are included in the cloud. An in vitro simulation of 
orange juice digestion shows that a serving of fresh orange juice (240 mL) 
provides 9.7 mg of soluble hesperidin 
(4'-methoxy-3',5,7-trihydroxyflavanone-7-rutinoside) and 4.7 mg of the 
C-glycosylflavone vicenin 2 (apigenin, 6,8-di-C-glucoside) for freshly squeezed 
orange juice, whereas pasteurized commercial juices provide 3.7 mg of soluble 
hesperidin and a higher amount of vicenin 2 (6.3 mg). This means that although 
orange juice is a very rich source of flavanones, only a limited quantity is 
soluble, and this might affect availability for absorption (11-36% of the 
soluble flavanones, depending on the juice). The flavanones precipitated in the 
cloud are not available for absorption and are partly transformed to the 
corresponding chalcones during the pancreatin-bile digestion.

Orange juice manufactured at industrial scale was subjected to digestion under 
in vitro gastrointestinal conditions (pH, temperature, and enzyme and chemical 
conditions) to evaluate the influence of individual industrial processing 
treatments on flavanone solubility, stability, and ability to permeate through a 
membrane under simulated physiological conditions. Four industrial processes 
including squeezing, standard pasteurization, concentration, and freezing were 
evaluated. Hand squeezing was compared with industrial squeezing. After in vitro 
gastrointestinal digestion of the orange juices, the flavanones able to permeate 
through a dialysis membrane, and those remaining in the retentate were evaluated 
by HPLC as were those present in the insoluble fraction. In all of the assayed 
orange juices, a high content of precipitated chalcones ( approximately 70% of 
the total flavanones) was formed under the physiological conditions of the 
gastrointestinal tract. Hand squeezing provided a higher concentration of 
flavanones in the permeated fraction and lower transformation to chalcones than 
industrial squeezing. Standard pasteurization did not influence the solubility 
and permeability of the orange juice flavanones and chalcones. Industrial 
concentration did not affect the amount of flavanones able to permeate but 
decreased the chalcones produced. Juices produced from frozen orange juice 
contained considerably smaller amounts of both soluble flavanones and insoluble 
chalcones.

Phenolic constituents, furans, and total antioxidant status of distilled 
spirits.

100 College Street, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1L5 Canada. david.goldberg@utoronto.ca

The concentrations of 11 phenols and 5 furans were measured in 12 categories of 
distilled spirits by HPLC methodology, together with the total antioxidant 
status (TAS) of the same beverages. Ellagic acid was the phenol present in 
highest concentration in all beverages. Moderate amounts of syringaldehyde, 
syringic acid, and gallic acid, as well as lesser amounts of vanillin and 
vanillic acid, were measurable in most samples of whiskey, brandy, and rum but 
were largely undetectable in gin, vodka, liqueurs, and miscellaneous spirits. 
5-(Hydroxymethyl)furfural was the predominant furan in the former three 
beverages, notably cognac, with 2-furaldehyde the next highest, but these were 
undetectable in most of the latter beverages. Highest TAS values were given by 
armagnac, cognac, and bourbon whiskey, all three of which tended toward the 
highest concentrations of phenols. Negative TAS values were exhibited by rum, 
vodka, gin, and miscellaneous spirits in line with the low or undetectable 
phenol concentrations in these beverages. Wood aging is the most likely source 
of phenols and furans in distilled spirits. Those beverages exposed to this 
treatment contain significant antioxidant activity, which is between the ranges 
for white and red wines, with the potential to augment the antiatherosclerotic 
functions attributable to the ethanol that they contain.

Over the last decades, the phenolic compounds from virgin olive oil (VOO) have 
become the subject of intensive research because of their biological activities 
and their influence on some of the most relevant attributes of this interesting 
matrix. Developing metabolic profiling approaches to determine them in 
monovarietal virgin olive oils could help to gain a deeper insight into olive 
oil phenolic compounds composition as well as to promote their use for botanical 
origin tracing purposes. To this end, two approaches were comparatively 
investigated (LC-ESI-TOF MS and GC-APCI-TOF MS) to evaluate their capacity to 
properly classify 25 olive oil samples belonging to five different varieties 
(Arbequina, Cornicabra, Hojiblanca, Frantoio and Picual), using the entire 
chromatographic phenolic profiles combined to chemometrics (principal component 
analysis (PCA) and partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)). The 
application of PCA to LC-MS and GC-MS data showed the natural clustering of the 
samples, seeing that 2 varieties were dominating the models (Arbequina and 
Frantoio), suppressing any possible discrimination among the other cultivars. 
Afterwards, PLS-DA was used to build four different efficient predictive models 
for varietal classification of the samples under study. The varietal markers 
pointed out by each platform were compared. In general, with the exception of 
one GC-MS model, all exhibited proper quality parameters. The models constructed 
by using the LC-MS data demonstrated superior classification ability.

In this work, an Italian extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) sample and the same 
sample added with a carotenoid-rich nutraceutical extract from Lycium barbarum 
L. (EVOOCar) were subjected to a frying process to comparatively assess chemical 
and physical changes and heat stability. Oxidation progress was monitored by 
measuring oil quality changes such as peroxide value, free acidity, K232, K268, 
and fatty acid composition as well as minor compound content, phenols, 
α-tocopherol, and carotenoids. An UHPLC/QTOF-MS metabolomics approach 
discriminated the two oil samples based on their chemical changes during frying, 
identifying also the phenolic classes most exposed to statistically significant 
variations. Partial least square discriminant analysis and volcano analysis were 
applied together to identify the most significant markers allowing group 
separation. The decrease in total phenolic content was lower in EVOOCar than in 
EVOO during frying. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids showed a 
significant percentage loss, 3.7% and 17.2%, respectively, in EVOO after 180min 
frying at 180°C, while they remained constant or slightly changed in EVOOCar. 
Zeaxanthin added to the oil rapidly decreased during the frying process. These 
findings showed that the addition of a carotenoid extract from L. barbarum can 
help to improve the oxidative stability of extra-virgin olive oil.

This study investigated the effect of both the degree of ripening of the olive 
fruit and irrigation management-rain-fed, two different regulated deficit 
irrigations (RDI), the method proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations (known as FAO), and 125 FAO (125% FAO)-on the phenolic and 
volatile composition of Cornicabra virgin olive oils obtained during two crop 
seasons. Secoiridoid phenolic derivatives greatly decreased upon increase of 
both irrigation and ripening, for example, the 3,4-DHPEA-EDA content decreased 
from 770 to 450 mg/kg through fruit ripening under rain-fed conditions and from 
676 to 388 mg/kg from rain-fed conditions to FAO irrigation treatment (at a 
ripeness index of approximately 4). Moreover, secoiridoid derivatives of 
hydroxytyrosol decreased more than those of tyrosol. The levels of major 
volatile components decreased in the course of ripening but were higher in 
irrigated olive oils: for example, the E-2-hexenal content ranged between 4.2 
and 2.6 mg/kg (expressed as 4-methyl-2-pentanol) over fruit maturation under 
rain-fed conditions and between 8.0 and 3.5 mg/kg under FAO scheduling. It is 
important to note that where water was applied only from the beginning of August 
(RDI-2), when oil begins to accumulate in the fruit, the resulting virgin olive 
oil presented a phenol and volatile profile similar to those of the FAO and 125 
FAO methods, but with a considerable reduction in the amount of water supplied 
to the olive orchard.

The phenolic compounds hydroxycinnamates, anthocyanins, flavonols, and 
flavan-3-ols of sweet cherry cultivars Burlat, Saco, Summit, and Van harvested 
in 2001 and 2002 were quantified by HPLC-DAD. Phenolics were analyzed at 
partially ripe and ripe stages and during storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C (room 
temperature) and 1-2 degrees C (cool temperature). Neochlorogenic and 
p-coumaroylquinic acids were the main hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, but 
chlorogenic acid was also identified in all cultivars. The 3-glucoside and 
3-rutinoside of cyanidin were the major anthocyanins. Peonidin and pelargonidin 
3-rutinosides were the minor anthocyanins, and peonidin 3-glucoside was also 
present in cvs. Burlat and Van. Epicatechin was the main monomeric flavan-3-ol 
with catechin present in smaller amounts in all cultivars. The flavonol rutin 
was also detected. Cultivar Saco contained the highest amounts of phenolics [227 
mg/100 g of fresh weight (fw)] and cv. Van the lowest (124 mg/100 g of fw). 
Phenolic acid contents generally decreased with storage at 1-2 degrees C and 
increased with storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C. Anthocyanin levels increased at 
both storage temperatures. In cv. Van the anthocyanins increased up to 5-fold 
during storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C (from 47 to 230 mg/100 g of fw). Flavonol 
and flavan-3-ol contents remained quite constant. For all cultivars the levels 
of phenolic acids were higher in 2001 and the anthocyanin levels were higher in 
2002, which suggest a significant influence of climatic conditions on these 
compounds.

Chlorogenic acid bioavailability largely depends on its metabolism by the gut 
microflora in rats.

Chlorogenic acid, the ester of caffeic acid with quinic acid, is one of the most 
abundant polyphenols in the human diet with coffee, fruits and vegetables as its 
major sources. Its antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties have been well 
established in animal studies. However, little is known about its gut absorption 
and metabolism. In the present work, four groups of rats (n = 8) were fed a diet 
supplemented with chlorogenic, caffeic or quinic acids (250 micromol/d) or an 
unsupplemented diet for 8 d. Parent compounds and their metabolites were 
estimated in urine (24-h collection) and plasma by HPLC-electrospray 
ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Significant differences in their levels 
were observed among the groups. The recovery of chlorogenic acid in urine was 
low (0.8%, mol/mol), and the total urinary excretion of caffeic acid liberated 
by hydrolysis of chlorogenic acid and its tissular methylated metabolites 
(ferulic and isoferulic acids) did not account for >0.5% (mol/mol) of the dose 
ingested. On the other hand, the metabolites of microbial origin, namely, 
m-coumaric acid and derivatives of phenylpropionic, benzoic and hippuric acids, 
represented the major compounds in both urine and plasma. Hippuric acid largely 
originated from the transformation of the quinic acid moiety, and all other 
metabolites from the caffeic acid moiety. These microbial metabolites accounted 
for 57.4% (mol/mol) of the chlorogenic acid intake. Such a high abundance of 
microbial metabolites shows that the bioavailability of chlorogenic acid depends 
largely on its metabolism by the gut microflora. Their potential importance in 
explaining the biological effects of dietary polyphenols is emphasized.

Apple juice relieves loperamide-induced constipation in rats by downregulating 
the intestinal apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter ASBT.

Sciences, Kanazawa University, Japan. tamai@p.kanazawa-u.ac.jp.

Apples are known to exhibit various beneficial effects on human health. In the 
present study, we investigated the effect of continuous intake of apple juice 
(AJ) on constipation status. A single dose of loperamide in rats as the 
constipation model markedly decreased the weight and number of fecal pellets 
compared to saline-administered rats as a control. After the administration of 
AJ twice a day for seven days, recovery of defecation close to that of the 
control was observed in loperamide-treated rats. In addition, the total bile 
acid content in the feces increased from day 4 after the administration of AJ. 
Among hepatic and intestinal transporters and enzymes that regulate bile acids, 
the mRNA expression of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (Asbt, 
slc10a2) was decreased by AJ in rats. Furthermore, the Asbt-mediated bile acid 
transport activity in the rat ileum decreased after AJ administration. Moreover, 
in human colonic cancer-derived Caco-2 cells, AJ exposure for 24 and 48 h 
decreased the expressions of ASBT mRNA and protein, and the uptake activity of 
taurocholic acid in both 7- and 21-d cultures. Several components of AJ, such as 
procyanidins, decreased the expression of ASBT in Caco-2 cells. In conclusion, 
ASBT downregulation is a possible mechanism responsible for the 
constipation-relieving effect of apples, and procyanidins may play a role in 
downregulating ASBT, which leads to the beneficial effects of apples against 
constipation. Although it is generally agreed that the common dietary 
compositions play a role in constipation relief, the novel specific mechanism of 
apples found in this study would facilitate understanding food functions.

Bioavailability of anthocyanins and ellagitannins following consumption of 
raspberries by healthy humans and subjects with an ileostomy.

Author information:

Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.

The fate of anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and ellagitannins was studied following 
the consumption of 300 g of raspberries by healthy human volunteers and subjects 
with an ileostomy. Postingestion plasma and urine from the former and ileal 
fluid and urine from the latter group were collected and analyzed by 
HPLC-PDA-MS(2). Plasma from the healthy volunteers did not contain detectable 
quantities of either the native raspberry polyphenolics or their metabolites. 
The three main raspberry anthocyanins were excreted in urine in both healthy and 
ileostomy volunteers 0-7 h after ingestion, in quantities corresponding to <0.1% 
of intake. This indicates a low level of absorption in the small intestine. With 
ileostomy volunteers 40% of anthocyanins and 23% of the ellagitannin sanguiin 
H-6 were recovered in ileal fluid with the main excretion period being the first 
4 h after raspberry consumption. The recovery of ellagic acid in ileal fluid was 
241%, indicating hydrolysis of ellagitannins in the stomach and/or the small 
intestine. Urinary excretion of ellagic acid and an ellagic acid-O-glucuronide 
was <1% of intake. No intact or conjugated forms of ellagitannins were detected 
in urine from either healthy subjects or ileostomy volunteers. However, in 
healthy subjects, but not the ileostomists, ellagitannins were catabolized with 
the appearance of urolithin A-O-glucuronide, two of its isomers, and urolithin 
B-O-glucuronide in urine collected 7-48 h after raspberry consumption. There was 
marked variation in the urolithin profile of individual volunteers, indicating 
differences in the colonic microflora responsible for ellagitannin degradation.

Recent studies have shown that dietary fiber and polyphenols of vegetables and 
fruits improve lipid metabolism and prevent the oxidation of low density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which hinder the development of 
atherosclerosis. The goal of this study was to measure the total polyphenol and 
dietary fiber contents of some tropical fruits (i.e., pineapple, wax apple, 
rambutan, lichi, guava, and mango) and compare the results to the content of 
these substances in the better characterized persimmon. It was found that lichi, 
guava, and ripe mango (cv. Keaw) have 3.35, 4.95, and 6.25 mg of total 
polyphenols in 100 g fresh fruit, respectively. This is significantly higher 
than in persimmon, pineapple, wax apple, mature green mango, and rambutan [P < 
0.0005 for pineapple (Smooth Cayene variant), wax apple, persimmon, rambutan, 
mature green mango (cv. Keaw); the value of P < 0.001 is found only for 
pineapple (Phuket, Queen variant)]. The same relationship was observed for the 
contents of gallic acid and of dietary fiber. It can be supposed that among the 
studied fruit, lichi, guava, and ripe mango may be preferable for dietary 
prevention of atherosclerosis.

Dietary fibers, major phenolics, main minerals, and trace elements in persimmons 
and apples were analyzed and compared in order to choose a preferable fruit for 
an antiatherosclerotic diet. Fluorometry and atomic absorption spectrometry 
following microwave digestion were optimized for the determination of major 
phenolics and minerals. Total, soluble, and insoluble dietary fibers, total 
phenols, epicatechin, gallic and p-coumaric acids, and concentrations of Na, K, 
Mg, Ca, Fe, and Mn in whole persimmons, their pulps, and peels were 
significantly higher than in whole apples, pulps, and peels (P < 0.01-0.0025). 
Conversely, the contents of Cu and Zn were higher in apples than in persimmons. 
In persimmons and apples all of the above components were higher in their peels 
than in whole fruits and pulps. The relatively high contents of dietary fibers, 
total and major phenolics, main minerals, and trace elements make persimmon 
preferable for an antiatherosclerotic diet.

Polish garlic and white and red onions were subjected to blanching, boiling, 
frying, and microwaving for different periods of time, and then their bioactive 
compounds (polyphenols, flavonoids, flavanols, anthocyanins, tannins, and 
ascorbic acid) and antioxidant activities were determined. It was found that 
blanching and frying and then microwaving of garlic and onions did not decrease 
significantly the amounts of their bioactive compounds and the level of 
antioxidant activities ( P > 0.05). The HPLC profiles of free and soluble ester- 
and glycoside-bound phenolic acids showed that trans-hydroxycinnamic acids 
(caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic) were as much as twice higher in 
garlic than in onions. Quercetin quantity was the highest in red onion among the 
studied vegetables. The electrophoretic separation of nonreduced garlic and 
onion proteins after boiling demonstrated their degradation in the range from 50 
to 112 kDa.

Biotechnology and Food Science, Lemesos 3603, Cyprus.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the present work was to evaluate the phytochemical 
profile and the antioxidant activity of strawberry fruit (cv. Camarosa) upon 
postharvest ripening at room temperature (20 °C) and to correlate them with 
qualitative attributes.
RESULTS: 'Camarosa' fruit retained an appreciable postharvest performance for up 
to 1 day shelf life; thereafter substantial quality deterioration was observed. 
An increased phenolic content, mainly attributed to hydroxycinnamic acids, 
flavonols and anthocyanins, was monitored after 3 days maintenance at 20 °C. The 
chromatographic fingerprint of athocyanins showed that pelargonidin-3-glucoside 
was the major anthocyanin, which increased with the increase of shelf life 
period, while cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside were found at 
lower concentrations. The potent radical scavenging activity, evaluated with 
four in vitro assays, showed a higher antioxidant capacity after 3 and 1 days of 
shelf life. In addition, the antioxidant effect of strawberry fruit extracts on 
lipid substrates and on an emulsion system showed a significant inhibition in 
the formation of conjugated diene hyperoxides. Interestingly, no direct 
correlation between the phytochemical profile and the quality attributes exist.
CONCLUSION: 'Camarosa' fruit had acceptable quality attributes for fresh 
consumption and at the same time a high phytochemical content up to 1 day shelf 
life. The over-ripe fruit continued to be an excellent reservoir of natural 
antioxidants, pointing to its potential use as food antioxidant and nutritional 
supplement.

Quercetin-4'-glucoside is a major flavonol in onions, and this study 
investigated the absorption and fate of radiolabeled quercetin-4'-glucoside in 
rats. Rats ingested [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside and the distribution of 
radioactivity throughout the body was determined after 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 h. The 
gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, and plasma were extracted, and 
radiolabeled components were identified and quantified using high-performance 
liquid chromatography with on-line radioactivity detection and tandem mass 
spectrometry. Two hours after dosing, all the [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside 
had been metabolized. More than 85% of the ingested radioactivity was present in 
the gastrointestinal tract at all time points with approximately 6% being 
absorbed and present in blood and internal organs, primarily the liver and 
kidneys. More than 95% of the absorbed radioactivity was in the form of >20 
different methylated glucuronated and/or sulfated quercetin conjugates. Five 
hours after ingestion, the main radiolabeled metabolites were quercetin 
diglucuronides in the gut, liver, and kidneys and glucuronyl sulfates of 
methylated quercetin in plasma. The main site of quercetin metabolism seemed to 
be the gastrointestinal tract. Quercetin metabolites may have a major influence 
on the gut mucosal epithelium and on colonic disease.

BACKGROUND: Owing to the distinctive advantages of mesenchymal stem cell-derived 
exosomes (MSCs-exo), these vesicles have emerged as a pivotal research focus in 
regenerative medicine, surpassing their MSC counterparts. Quercetin (Qr), widely 
recognized for its potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, 
demonstrates substantial potential in enhancing tissue repair processes. This 
study delves into the role of quercetin-pretreated MSC-derived exosomes 
(MSCsQr-exo) in accelerating the healing of diabetic wounds.
METHODS: MSCsQr-exo were isolated from quercetin-pretreated MSCs and applied to 
fibroblasts to evaluate changes in cell function. An in vitro DSW rat model was 
also developed, and the rats were treated with MSCsQr-exo to assess wound 
healing progression. Fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA sequencing and 
untargeted metabolomics to analyze changes in gut microbiota and metabolic 
profiles.
RESULTS: MSCsQr-exo significantly enhanced fibroblast proliferation and 
migration while improving the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs-exo in DSW treatment. 
Gut microbiota and metabolomic analyses revealed marked changes in DSW rats, 
with MSCsQr-exo effectively alleviating dysbiosis. MSCsQr-exo upregulated 
Faecalibacterium abundance and regulated arachidonic acid metabolism in both the 
arachidonic and linoleic acid pathways. Firmicutes and Enterobacteriaceae 
influenced the arachidonic acid pathway by modulating 14.15-EET expression 
levels.
CONCLUSION: MSCsQr-exo facilitate DSW wound healing through modulation of 
dysbiotic gut microbiota linked to DSW pathology. This discovery offers novel 
therapeutic avenues and research trajectories for enhancing DSW recovery.

The flavonoid quercetin, or its metabolites, inhibit chemical carcinogenesis in 
rodents and may have a role in the prevention of human cancers. Quercetin 
exposure in human populations results from the dietary intake of various plant 
foods; high concentrations of quercetin are found in apples, onions, tea, and 
red wine. Determination of the relationship between dietary intake and cancer 
risk depends on the characterization of quercetin intake. The development and 
use of biomarkers for quercetin intake may provide a basis for the objective 
classification of this exposure. One possible biomarker is metabolic products of 
quercetin. We report the development of a high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC)-based assay for quantitation of quercetin metabolites in human urine. The 
metabolites include 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (homoprotocatechuic acid), 
metahydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid 
(homovanillic acid). The assay has only two major steps, ether extraction and 
HPLC analysis, and is suitable for analysis of large sample numbers. Analytical 
characteristics of the assay include a sensitivity of less than 1 microgram, 
precision with coefficients of variation < 10%, and metabolite recoveries > 90%. 
The mean concentrations of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 
metahydroxyphenylacetic acid, and homovanillic acid in two human urine samples 
are approximately 0.7, 4.8, and 2.8 micrograms/ml, respectively. The 
identification of each metabolite is confirmed by HPLC, UV absorbance scans, and 
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. These results verify the 
occurrence of quercetin metabolites in human urine and the feasibility of 
quercetin metabolite quantitation, by the assay described herein, for 
epidemiological studies. Development of the analytical procedure is an essential 
first step for validation of the metabolites as biomarkers of quercetin intake.

A method was developed for the simultaneous detection of eight polyphenols 
(t-resveratrol, (+)-catechin, quercetin and p-coumaric, caffeic, sinapic, 
ferulic, and gallic acids) by CZE with electrochemical detection. Separation of 
these polyphenols was achieved within 25 min using a 200 mM borate buffer (pH 
9.4) containing 10% methanol as separation electrolyte. Amperometric detection 
of polyphenols was carried out with a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified 
with a multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNT) layer obtained from a dispersion of 
CNT in polyethylenimine. The excellent electrochemical properties of this 
modified electrode allowed the detection and quantification of the selected 
polyphenols in white wines without any pretreatment step, showing remarkable 
signal stability despite the presence of potential fouling substances in wine. 
The electrophoretic profiles of white wines, obtained using this methodology, 
have proven to be useful for the classification of these wines by means of 
chemometric multivariate techniques. Principal component analysis and 
discriminant analysis allowed accurate classification of wine samples on the 
basis of their grape varietal (verdejo and airén) using the information 
contained in selected zones of the electropherogram. The utility of the proposed 
CZE methodology based on the electrochemical response of CNT-modified electrodes 
appears to be promising in the field of wine industry and it is expected to be 
successfully extended to classification of a wider range of wines made of other 
grape varietals.

1994-1996, the mean daily intake of PAs in the U.S. population (>2 y old) was 
estimated to be 57.7 mg/person. Monomers, dimers, trimers, and those above 
trimers contribute 7.1, 11.2, 7.8, and 73.9% of total PAs, respectively. The 
major sources of PAs in the American diet are apples (32.0%), followed by 
chocolate (17.9%) and grapes (17.8%). The 2- to 5-y-old age group (68.2 
mg/person) and men >60 y old (70.8 mg/person) consume more PAs daily than other 
groups because they consume more fruit. The daily intake of PAs for 4- to 
6-mo-old and 6- to 10-mo-old infants was estimated to be 1.3 mg and 26.9 mg, 
respectively, based on the recommendations of the American Academy of 
Pediatrics. This study supports the concept that PAs account for a major 
fraction of the total flavonoids ingested in Western diets.

In the United States, commercially available foods, including cocoa and 
chocolate, are being marketed with statements referring to the level of 
antioxidant activity and polyphenols. For cocoa-containing foods, there has been 
no comprehensive survey of the content of these and other chemistries. A survey 
of cocoa and chocolate-containing products marketed in the United States was 
conducted to determine antioxidant activity and polyphenol and procyanidin 
contents. Commercially available samples consisted of the top market share 
products in each of the following six categories: natural cocoa, unsweetened 
baking chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet baking chips, milk chocolate, and 
chocolate syrup. Composite samples were characterized using four different 
methods: oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), vitamin C equivalence 
antioxidant capacity (VCEAC), total polyphenols, and procyanidins. All composite 
lots were further characterized for percent nonfat cocoa solids (NFCS) and 
percent fat. Natural cocoas had the highest levels of antioxidant activities, 
total polyphenols, and procyanidins followed by baking chocolates, dark 
chocolates and baking chips, and finally milk chocolate and syrups. The results 
showed a strong linear correlation between NFCS and ORAC (R (2) = 0.9849), total 
polyphenols (R (2) = 0.9793), and procyanidins (R (2) = 0.946), respectively. On 
the basis of principal component analysis, 81.4% of the sample set was 
associated with NFCS, antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, and procyanidins. 
The results indicated that, regardless of the product category, NFCS were the 
primary factor contributing to the level of cocoa antioxidants in the products 
tested. Results further suggested that differences in cocoa bean blends and 
processing, with the possible exception of Dutching, are minor factors in 
determining the level of antioxidants in commercially available cocoa-containing 
products in the United States.

BACKGROUND: The extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) industry generates significant 
quantities of by-products, such as olive oil mill wastewater (OMWW), which could 
be valorized for their high bioactive compound content. The aim of this study 
was to investigate the positive impact of incorporating a polyphenol-rich 
extract from OMWW into EVOO extract, focusing on the improvement in polyphenol 
content, antioxidant properties, and effects on intestinal cell viability. 
Specifically, increasing concentrations of OMWW extract (1, 10, 20, and 50%) 
were added to the EVOO extract, and the preliminary screening based on 
antioxidant activity was assessed using a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) 
radical scavenging assay.
RESULTS: The EVOO/OMWW 50% extract exhibited the highest DPPH radical scavenging 
activity (92.23%) and demonstrated superior antioxidant properties in comparison 
with pure EVOO and OMWW extracts. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
analysis revealed enrichment of polyphenols in the selected EVOO/OMWW 50% 
extract. The antioxidant/antiradical activity of EVOO/OMWW 50% extract was 
further investigated through various assays, including 
2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric reducing 
antioxidant power (FRAP), and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) scavenging tests. 
Considerable activity was revealed, significantly superior to that of the EVOO 
extract. Furthermore, the extract did not exhibit any significant cytotoxicity 
in human intestinal cell lines (Caco-2 and HT29-MTX), indicating its safety for 
potential nutraceutical applications.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the incorporation of OMWW into EVOO 
extract can improve its antioxidant/antiradical potential significantly, 
providing a promising approach for the valorization of OMWW waste in the 
enhancement of the EVOO nutraceutical properties. © 2025 Society of Chemical

[13C]Caffeic acid and [13C]ferulic acid were synthesized and then used as 
internal standards for the determination of these acids (free and esterified) in 
oatmeal. A comparative study indicated that 84% of the ferulic acid, but only 
32% of the caffeic acid, which is more susceptible to oxidation than the former, 
could be found by a conventional analytical approach.

A validated method was developed for the simultaneous determination of the 
hydroxycinnamates caffeic acid (CA), dihydrocaffeic acid (DHCA), ferulic acid 
(FA), dihydroferulic acid (DHFA), and isoferulic acid (IFA) in human plasma as 
metabolites derived from coffee consumption. The method includes a protein 
precipitation step prior to enzymatic hydrolysis of the conjugated metabolites 
(sulfate, glucuronide, and/or ester) back to their aglycone forms. After 
liquid-liquid extraction, the reconstituted extract was analysed by 
high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to negative electrospray 
ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. Calibration curves were constructed from 
spiked human plasma samples in the range of 0-4800 nM for each of the targeted 
analytes. Two internal standards, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid (500 nM) 
and 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid (200 nM), were spiked at the beginning of the 
sample preparation and before analysis, respectively. Good performance data were 
obtained with limits of detection and quantification of the five 
hydroxycinnamates ranging between 1-15 nM and 3-50 nM, respectively. Within and 
between-days precisions were respectively calculated between 8-18% and 8-30% (at 
50 nM added initially), between 6-9% and 6-12% (at 200 nM), and between 5-9% and 
5-9% (at 500 nM). Precision calculated from different analysts ranged from 18% 
to 44% (at 50 nM), from 8% to 16% (at 200 nM), and from 4% to 8% (at 500 nM). 
Using this method, we determined plasma levels in humans and measured the 
efficiency of deconjugation using our enzymatic cocktail.

Five French cider apple varieties were compared on the basis of their detailed 
polyphenol profile in the cortex and in the juices. Among the factors studied, 
variety was the most important variability factor in fruits, whereas polyphenol 
profiles showed an overall stability from one year to another, and a limited 
decrease of polyphenol concentration was observed during the starch regression 
period of fruit maturation. In juices, procyanidins remained the preponderant 
polyphenol class with concentrations up to 2.4 g/L even in centrifuged juices. 
Compared to the fruits, the average degree of polymerization of procyanidins was 
significantly reduced in the juice. Centrifugation of the crude juice had only 
minor effects on the polyphenol composition. For one variety, highly polymerized 
procyanidins with average degrees of polymerization of 25 were shown to be 
soluble in the centrifuged juice at a concentration of close to 1.2 g/L. 
Oxygenation of the juices during processing resulted in a significant decrease 
of all classes of native polyphenols. Catechins and procyanidins were 
particularly affected by oxidation, whereas caffeoylquinic acid was partly 
preserved. The transfer of polyphenols after pressing was maximal for 
dihydrochalcones and minimal for procyanidins with extraction yield values close 
to 80 and 30%, respectively.

Blackberries are a rich source of polyphenolics, particularly anthocyanins, that 
may contribute to the reduced risk of chronic disease; however, as with most 
berries, the fresh fruit are only seasonally available. With most of the 
blackberries consumed as frozen or in thermally processed forms after long-term 
storage, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of processing and 
6 months of storage on the anthocyanins and antioxidant capacity of blackberries 
that were individually quick-frozen (IQF), canned-in-syrup, canned-in-water, 
pureed, and juiced (clarified and nonclarified). Monomeric anthocyanins, percent 
polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity by oxygen radical absorbance capacity 
(ORAC FL) and photochemiluminescence (PCL) were determined postprocessing (1 
day) and after 1, 3, and 6 months of storage. Processing resulted in increases 
in polymeric color values (up to 7%) and losses in monomeric anthocyanins (up to 
65%). For most products, processing also resulted in losses in antioxidant 
capacity (by ORAC FL and PCL). Storage at 25 degrees C of all processed products 
resulted in dramatic losses in monomeric anthocyanins with as much as 75% losses 
of anthocyanins throughout storage, which coincided with marked increases of 
percent polymeric color values of these products over 6 months of storage. There 
were no changes in ORAC FL or PCL for processed products throughout long-term 
storage. No significant changes in antioxidant capacity or anthocyanin content 
were observed in IQF fruit during long-term storage at -20 degrees C.

Processing and storage effects on the ellagitannin composition of processed 
blackberry products.

Hager TJ(1), Howard LR, Prior RL.

Fayetteville, Arkansas 72704, United States.

Changes in blackberry ellagitannin composition in response to juicing (clarified 
and nonclarified), pureeing, canning (in water or syrup), and freezing as well 
as changes in processed products during 6 months of storage were investigated. 
Canning, pureeing, and freezing had little effect on ellagitannins, but 
processing berries into nonclarified and clarified juices resulted in total 
ellagitannin losses of 70 and 82%, respectively, due to removal of 
ellagitannin-rich seeds in the presscake. Minimal changes in total ellagitannin 
content were observed during storage of thermally processed products, but 
compositional changes indicative of ellagitannin depolymerization were apparent. 
The ellagitannin content and composition of frozen berries remained stable over 
6 months of storage. Ellagitannins are well retained in canned, pureed, and 
frozen blackberries, but methods are needed to prevent losses during juice 
processing and/or exploit the ellagitannin-rich coproducts.

The steryl ferulate contents of rye and wheat grains and their milling fractions 
were analyzed using a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic 
(HPLC) method. HPLC-mass spectrometry was used for identification. In addition, 
steryl ferulates of some selected milling byproducts were determined. The total 
steryl ferulate contents of rye and wheat grains were 6.0 and 6.3 mg/100 g, 
respectively. Uneven distribution of steryl ferulates in the grains led to 
considerable differences in the milling products; their steryl ferulate contents 
ranged from trace amounts in flours with low ash content to 20 and 34 mg/100 g 
in rye and wheat brans, respectively. Campestanyl ferulate and sitostanyl 
ferulate were the main components, followed by campesteryl ferulate and 
sitosteryl ferulate, whereas sitosterol was the main component in total sterols. 
Among the other samples, a byproduct of rice milling (pearling dust) was the 
best source of steryl ferulates, its total steryl ferulate content being 119 
mg/100 g, whereas no measurable amounts of steryl ferulates were measured in oat 
bran or pearling dust of barley. The results indicated that rye and wheat and 
especially their bran fractions are comparable to corn as steryl ferulate 
sources.

The amounts of quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol aglycons in 25 edible 
berries were analyzed by an optimized RP-HPLC method with UV detection and 
identified with diode array and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry 
detection. Sixteen species of cultivated berries and nine species of wild 
berries were collected in Finland in 1997. Quercetin was found in all berries, 
the contents being highest in bog whortleberry (158 mg/kg, fresh weight), 
lingonberry (74 and 146 mg/kg), cranberry (83 and 121 mg/kg), chokeberry (89 
mg/kg), sweet rowan (85 mg/kg), rowanberry (63 mg/kg), sea buckthorn berry (62 
mg/kg), and crowberry (53 and 56 mg/kg). Amounts between 14 and 142 mg/kg of 
myricetin were detected in cranberry, black currant, crowberry, bog 
whortleberry, blueberries, and bilberry. Kaempferol was detected only in 
gooseberries (16 and 19 mg/kg) and strawberries (5 and 8 mg/kg). Total contents 
of these flavonols (100-263 mg/kg) in cranberry, bog whortleberry, lingonberry, 
black currant, and crowberry were higher than those in the commonly consumed 
fruits or vegetables, except for onion, kale, and broccoli.

Kuopio, PO box 1627, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland.

Effects of domestic processing and storage on the flavonols quercetin, 
myricetin, and kaempferol in five berries were studied using an optimized 
RP-HPLC method with UV and diode array detection after an acid hydrolysis of the 
corresponding glycosides. In fresh berries, the total content of flavonols was 
highest in lingonberry (169 mg/kg) and black currant (157 mg/kg), intermediate 
in bilberry (41 mg/kg) and strawberry (17 mg/kg), and lowest in red raspberry 
(9.5 mg/kg). Cooking strawberries with sugar to make jam resulted in minor 
losses (quercetin 15%, kaempferol 18%). During cooking of bilberries with water 
and sugar to make soup, 40% of quercetin was lost. Traditional preservation of 
crushed lingonberries in their own juice caused a considerable (40%) loss of 
quercetin. Only 15% of quercetin and 30% of myricetin present in unprocessed 
berries were retained in juices made by common domestic methods (steam-extracted 
black currant juice, unpasteurized lingonberry juice). Cold-pressing was 
superior to steam-extraction in extracting flavonols from black currants. During 
9 months of storage at 20 C, quercetin content decreased markedly (40%) in 
bilberries and lingonberries, but not in black currants or red raspberries. 
Myricetin and kaempferol were more susceptible than quercetin to losses during 
storage.

We evaluated the absorbability of anthocyanins in humans and rats administered 
with a beverage prepared from an extract of the tuber of purple sweet potato 
(Ipomoea batatas Cultivar Ayamurasaki), or with an anthocyanin concentrate. Two 
major anthocyanin components, cyanidin 
3-O-(2-O-(6-O-(E)-caffeoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside)-5-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside) 
and peonidin 
3-O-(2-O-(6-O-(E)-caffeoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside)-5-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside), 
were detected in the plasma and urine of both rats and humans by HPLC or liquid 
chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The plasma concentration of 
anthocyanins in humans reached a maximum 90 minutes after ingestion, and the 
recovery of anthocyanins in the urine was estimated as 0.01-0.03%. These results 
indicate that acylated anthocyanins could be selectively absorbed after 
ingesting food.

Analytical data are reported for 20 flavonoids (as aglycones) determined for 
more than 60 fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts collected from four regions 
across the United States at two times of the year. Sample collection was 
designed and implemented by the Nutrient Data Laboratory (USDA). Analyses of 
eight flavan-3-ols (catechin, catechin gallate, epicatechin, epicatechin 
gallate, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, gallocatechin, and 
gallocatechin gallate), six anthocyanins (cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, 
pelargonidin, peonidin, and petunidin), two flavanones (hesperetin and 
naringenin), two flavones (apigenin and luteolin), and two flavonols (myricetin 
and quercetin) were performed by the Food Composition Laboratory (USDA) using a 
hydrolysis method for the anthocyanidins, flavones, and flavonols and a direct 
extraction method for the flavan-3-ols and flavanones. Experimental results 
compare favorably (few statistically significant differences) to literature 
values in the flavonoid and proanthocyanidin database previously compiled by the 
Nutrient Data Laboratory. The results of this study showed a seasonal variation 
only for blueberries. This study also showed that the variation in the flavonoid 
content of foods, as purchased by the U.S. consumer, is very large. The relative 
standard deviation, averaged for each flavonoid in each food, was 168%.

Purification of polar fractions from cacao liquor extracts gave 17 phenolics 
including four new compounds. The new compounds were characterized as a 
C-glycosidic flavan, an O-glycoside of a dimeric and two O-glycosides of 
trimeric A-linked proanthocyanidins, on the basis of spectroscopic data. 
Isolated polyphenols showed inhibitory effects on nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate-dependent lipid peroxidation in microsomes and on the 
autoxidation of linoleic acid. These effects were attributed to the 
radical-scavenging activity in the peroxidation chain reactions, based on the 
findings that the cacao polyphenols effectively scavenged the 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical.

Cassia bark or cortex cinnamomi, the dried stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia Presl. 
(Lauraceae), is a popular natural spice and a commonly used herb in traditional 
Chinese medicine. However, adulterants are frequently found in the market. In 
this study, 44 samples of Cassia bark including bark from seven related 
Cinnamomum species were collected from fields and market. Four characteristic 
components, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, and coumarin were 
determined by RP-HPLC, and a fingerprint comprised of five markers was 
established. These results showed that cassia barks contained high contents of 
cinnamaldehyde (13.01-56.93 mg/g). The highest content of cinnamaldehyde (up to 
93.83 mg/g) was found in debarked cortex, which is traditionally regarded as 
having the best quality in local herb shops. In contrast, the adulterants from 
the other Cinnamomum species, C. wilsonii Camble, C. japonicum Sieb., C. mairei 
Levl. and C. burmanii (Nees) Blume, contained low contents of cinnamaldehyde 
(<2.00 mg/g). The content of cinnamaldehyde in C. loureirii Nees was comparable 
to that in C. cassia. It is suggested that five characteristic peaks by HPLC are 
suitable for distinguishing genuine cassia bark from the adulterants and could 
be applied in the quality control of this commodity.

The antiradical activity of dry beans was evaluated in order to assess the 
validity of this test and to correlate the results with those achieved with the 
Folin-Ciocalteu method and with a rapid spectrophotometric method for the 
analysis of total flavonoids. Four landraces (12 samples) of common beans 
(Phaseolus vulgaris L.), collected in two regions of Italy (Tuscany and 
Basilicata) in three different years, were analyzed. The EC50 values ranged from 
39 to 2810 mg sample/mg 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazil radical. The phenolic 
content of each sample was expressed as gallic acid equivalents; it changed from 
1.17 to 4.40 mg/g. The flavonoid content, expressed as mg of (+)-catechin per g 
of dry seeds, ranged from 0.24 to 1.43 mg/g. The qualiquantitative composition 
of polyphenols has been also elucidated by means of high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC)-diode array detection and HPLC/MS. These investigations 
showed that rapid tests can contribute to assessing the quality of functional 
food.

Dietary supplements manufactured from red clover are widely marketed to provide 
the beneficial health effects of isoflavones without changing the original diet. 
In this study the metabolism of formononetin and biochanin A, the principal 
isoflavones of red clover, was studied in human subjects. Seven women ingested 
four red clover dietary supplements, and the metabolites of the isoflavones were 
identified in their urine samples. The structures of trimethylsilyl derivatives 
of the metabolites were established by GC-MS. New reduced metabolites of 
formononetin (dihydroformononetin and angolensin) and biochanin A 
(dihydrobiochanin A and 6'-hydroxyangolensin) were identified in urine samples 
using authentic reference compounds. Possible metabolic pathways are presented 
for the red clover isoflavones formononetin and biochanin A.

Soy isoflavones have recently gained considerable interest due to their possible 
health benefits. However, detailed studies on the metabolism of isoflavones are 
lacking. The aims of the investigation presented here were (1) to study the in 
vitro intestinal metabolism of isoflavones and their hydroxylated analogues 
3'-OH-daidzein, 6-OH-daidzein, 8-OH-daidzein, and 3'-OH-genistein and (2) to 
characterize the structures of some earlier identified urinary metabolites of 
soy isoflavones, for which no authentic reference compounds have been available. 
Isoflavone standards (1-2 mg) were fermented with human fecal flora (16.7%) for 
24 h. Metabolites formed during the fermentation were tentatively identified by 
interpretation of the mass spectra of trimethylsilylated compounds obtained by 
GC-MS. Compounds having hydroxyl groups at 5-position (i.e., genistein and 
3'-OH-genistein) were completely converted to metabolites that could not be 
detected by the methods used in this study. The metabolism of daidzein and its 
hydroxylated analogues, 3'-OH-daidzein, 6-OH-daidzein, and 8-OH-daidzein, 
occurred to a much lesser extent. Minor amounts of reduced metabolites (i.e., 
isoflavanones and alpha-methyldeoxybenzoins) of these compounds were tentatively 
identified in fermentation extracts. The retention times and the mass spectra of 
reduced isoflavone metabolites, obtained from in vitro fermentations of pure 
compounds, were utilized to identify unknown urinary metabolites of soy 
isoflavones. Four novel isoflavone metabolites were identified in human urine 
collected after soy supplementation: 3' '-OH-O-desmethylangolensin, 
3',4',7-trihydroxyisoflavanone, 4',7,8-trihydroxyisoflavanone, and 
4',6,7-trihydroxyisoflavanone.

Strawberries are known to contain antioxidants, but the significance of 
ingesting antioxidant-rich fruits remains to be established. In order to 
determine whether the consumption of strawberries impacted measures of in vivo 
antioxidant capacity, frozen strawberries (250 g) were administered daily for 3 
weeks to 21 healthy female volunteers. Compliance was confirmed by quantitating 
pelargonidin-glucuronide, urolithin A-glucuronide, and 
2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3-[(2)H]furanone-glucuronide in plasma and urine by 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and antioxidant capacity in serum 
measured by the increase in lag phase of low-density lipoprotein after copper 
sulfate exposure, DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes, and activity of phase II 
enzymes. Among these measures lipid peroxidation lag time increased by 20% (P < 
.01), whereas other measures did not change significantly. The potent 
antioxidant defenses in humans make determination of changes due to dietary 
ingestion in healthy individuals difficult. In summary, daily consumption of 
strawberries resulted in a modest but significant increase in antioxidant 
capacity in a healthy population.

We determined whether nine common herbs (basil, chili, cilantro, dill, garlic, 
ginger, lemongrass, oregano, and parsley) and one herb mixture (Italian Herbs) 
retain the antioxidant capacity (AC) and content of phenolics and characteristic 
marker compounds during processing to dry and paste forms. Oregano exhibited the 
highest AC among the herbs tested in dry and fresh forms. Compared with fresh 
herbs, the AC in dry form was decreased in garlic, chili, dill, oregano and 
parsley and paste form of oregano and basil. With the exception of dried garlic 
and lemongrass in fresh and paste form, all herbs in dry, paste, and fresh form 
contained significant AC. The AC was correlated significantly to the total 
phenolic content in both dry and fresh form. However, there was no significant 
correlation between the AC and the concentration of chemical marker compounds. 
In summary, processed herbs contribute significant amounts of AC to the diet.

Catechins, compounds that belong to the flavonoid class, are potentially 
beneficial to human health. To enable an epidemiological evaluation of 
catechins, data on their contents in foods are required. HPLC with UV and 
fluorescence detection was used to determine the levels of (+)-catechin, 
(-)-epicatechin, (+)-gallocatechin (GC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), 
(-)-epicatechin gallate (ECg), and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) in 8 
types of black tea, 18 types of red and white wines, apple juice, grape juice, 
iced tea, beer, chocolate milk, and coffee. Tea infusions contained high levels 
of catechins (102-418 mg of total catechins/L), and tea was the only beverage 
that contained GC, EGC, ECg, and EGCg in addition to (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin. Catechin concentrations were still substantial in red wine 
(27-96 mg/L), but low to negligible amounts were found in white wine, 
commercially available fruit juices, iced tea, and chocolate milk. Catechins 
were absent from beer and coffee. The data reported here provide a base for the 
epidemiological evaluation of the effect of catechins on the risk for chronic 
diseases.

The phenolic profile of strawberry fruits (Fragaria x ananassa Duch., Rosaceae) 
was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array 
detection. A peak displaying retention time and UV spectral data identical to 
those of phloridzin (phloretin 2'-O-beta-d-glucoside), a dihydrochalcone 
glucoside so far considered characteristic of apples, was monitored. For further 
characterization, crude extracts of strawberries were purified on polyamide, and 
the target compound was isolated by preparative and analytical HPLC. Structure 
elucidation was performed on the basis of APCI- and ESI-MS in the negative ion 
mode as well as by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy using authentic phloridzin for 
comparison. The d-configuration of the sugar moiety was established by HPLC 
analysis of the corresponding acyclic 
1-deoxy-1-(N-acetyl-alpha-methylbenzylamino)alditol acetate. Apart from its 
chemotaxonomic relevance, this first report on the occurrence of phloridzin in 
strawberries is of particular interest for the authenticity control of 
strawberry products such as juices, jams, and fruit preparations since 
phloridzin has so far been used for the detection of fraudulent admixtures.

Content of CYP3A4 inhibitors, naringin, naringenin and bergapten in grapefruit 
and grapefruit juice products.

The flavonoids, naringin and naringenin and the furanocoumarin, bergapten 
(5-methoxypsoralen), were detected in some fresh grapefruit and commercial 
grapefruit juices but were not detected in other fruit juices tested (orange; 
orange with apple base; dark grape; orange and mango with apple base; orange, 
peach, passion fruit juice). The contents of these three grapefruit constituents 
in commercial juice and fresh grapefruit varied from brand to brand and also 
from lot to lot. Juice was prepared from the fresh fruit via different methods 
(by hand, squeezer or blender). The naringin content, after hand-squeeze, ranged 
from 115 to 384 mg/l. With hand-squeeze juice production, bergapten was not 
detected (less than 0.5 mg/l) in two varieties of grapefruit, and naringenin was 
usually not in detectable levels (less than 2 mg/l) in three varieties. All 
three constituents were present in New Zealand grapefruit preparations 
(including juice by hand-squeeze) and different lots showed variation in content 
(1.5-, 2.3- and 4.7-fold for naringin, naringenin and bergapten, respectively). 
Differences in the concentrations of these three constituents, which have 
potential for drug interaction, may contribute to the variability in 
pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 drugs and some contradictory results of drug 
interaction studies with grapefruit juice.

Gallic acid is one of the main phenolic components of black tea. The objective 
of this study was to identify urinary gallic acid metabolites with potential for 
use as markers of black tea intake. In an initial study, nine compounds, 
assessed by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, were found to increase 
in concentration in urine after 3 cups of black tea over 3 h. A subsequent study 
employed a controlled crossover design in which 10 subjects consumed 5 cups per 
day of black tea or water for 4 weeks in random order. Twenty-four hour urine 
samples were collected at the end of each period. Of the 9 candidate compounds 
identified in the initial study, only 3 were present at higher concentrations in 
urine of all 10 subjects during tea-drinking in comparison to water-drinking 
periods. These compounds were identified as 4-O-methylgallic acid, 
3-O-methylgallic acid, and 3, 4-O-dimethylgallic acid, all methyl ether 
derivatives of gallic acid. It is suggested that these compounds have the 
potential to be used as markers of black tea intake.

Tea and coffee are rich in polyphenols with a variety of biological activities. 
Many of the demonstrated activities are consistent with favourable effects on 
the risk of chronic diseases. 4-O-methylgallic acid (4OMGA) and isoferulic acid 
are potential biomarkers of exposure to polyphenols derived from tea and coffee 
respectively. 4OMGA is derived from gallic acid in tea, and isoferulic acid is 
derived from chlorogenic acid in coffee. Our major objective was to explore the 
relationships of tea and coffee intake with 24 h urinary excretion of 4OMGA and 
isoferulic acid in human subjects. The relationships of long-term usual (111 
participants) and contemporaneously recorded current (344 participants) tea and 
coffee intake with 24 h urinary excretion of 4OMGA and isoferulic acid were 
assessed in two populations. 4OMGA was related to usual (r 0.50, P<0.001) and 
current (r 0.57, P<0.001) tea intake, and isoferulic acid was related to usual 
(r 0.26, P=0.008) and current (r 0.18, P<0.001) coffee intake. Overall, our 
present results are consistent with the proposal that 4OMGA is a good biomarker 
for black tea-derived polyphenol exposure, but isoferulic acid may be of limited 
usefulness as a biomarker for coffee-derived polyphenol exposure.

Urinary excretion of strawberry anthocyanins is dose dependent for physiological 
oral doses of fresh fruit.

There is considerable interest in coloured fruits and berries as sources of 
biologically active anthocyanins. To examine the relationship between the oral 
dose and the amount excreted for anthocyanins from a food source across a 
physiological range of doses, volunteers were fed, in random order, four 
portions (100-400 g) of fresh strawberries as part of a standard breakfast. 
Urine was collected at 2 h intervals up to 8 h, and for the period 8-24 h. Fresh 
strawberries contained pelargonidin-3-glucoside as the major anthocyanin with 
smaller amounts of cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside. 
Anthocyanins were detected in the urine of all volunteers for all doses, 
predominantly as pelargonidin glucuronide and sulphate metabolites. There was a 
strong, linear relationship between oral dose and anthocyanin excretion 
(Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient = 0.692, p < 0.001, n = 40) 
which indicated that on an average, every additional unit of dose caused 0.0166 
units of excretion. Within individuals, dose -- excretion data fitted a linear 
regression model (median R(2) = 0.93). We conclude that strawberry anthocyanins 
are partially bioavailable in humans with a linear relationship between oral 
dose and urinary excretion for doses up to 400 g fresh fruit.

Changes in phytochemical and antioxidant activity of selected pepper cultivars 
(Capsicum species) as influenced by maturity.

The effect of fruit maturation on changes in carotenoids, flavonoids, total 
soluble reducing equivalents, phenolic acids, ascorbic acid, and antioxidant 
activity (AOX) in different pepper types (Capsicum annuum, Capsicum frutescens, 
and Capsicum chinese) was determined. Generally, the concentration of these 
chemical constituents increased as the peppers reached maturity. Peppers 
contained high levels of L-ascorbic acid and carotenoids at maturity, 
contributing 124-338% of the RDA for vitamin C and 0.33-336 RE/100 g of 
provitamin A activity, respectively. Levels of phenolic acids, capxanthin, and 
zeaxanthin generally increased during maturation, whereas the level of lutein 
declined. Flavonoid concentrations varied greatly among the pepper types 
analyzed and were negatively correlated to AOX under the conditions of the 
beta-carotene-linoleic assay. Model systems were used to aid in understanding 
the relationship between flavonoids and AOX. Significant increases in AOX were 
observed in pepper juice models in response to increasing dilution factors and 
the presence of EDTA, indicating a pro-oxidant effect due to metal ions in the 
system. In vitro models demonstrated that increasing levels of flavonoids in 
combination with constant levels of caffeic and ascorbic acid gave a resultant 
AOX that was either additive of the two compounds or competitive in their 
ability to scavenge peroxyl radicals. The model systems were in good agreement 
with the chemical composition of the pepper cultivars and reflected the 
interactions affecting AOX. More research is needed to understand the complex 
interactions that occur among various antioxidants present in pepper extracts.

Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of 11 commercial cultivars and 
15 advanced breeding lines of spinach were determined over two growing seasons 
known to vary in biotic and abiotic stresses. Flavonoid composition and content 
of fall-grown commercial cultivars and advanced breeding lines were also 
determined. Over-winter spinach, which was planted in late fall and harvested in 
the spring, had much higher levels of total phenolics and antioxidant capacity 
than spinach planted in early fall and harvested in late fall, indicating that 
growing conditions, as well as biotic and abiotic stresses, influenced phenolic 
metabolism. Genotype also appeared to play an important role in affecting 
phenolic metabolism and antioxidant capacity in spinach. Advanced breeding lines 
of spinach, which show increased disease resistance, had higher levels of total 
phenolics, individual and total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity than 
commercial cultivars. Our results indicate that plant breeders can select for 
increased phenolic content to increase antioxidant capacity in spinach 
cultivars, or the crops can be grown in different seasons or under certain 
stress conditions to elevate levels of antioxidants.

Fresh blueberries were processed into sugar and sugar-free jams and stored for 6 
months at 4 and 25 degrees C. The jams were analyzed immediately after 
processing and over 6 months of storage for polyphenolic content, percent 
polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity. Processing resulted in losses of 
anthocyanins, procyanidins, chlorogenic acid, and ORAC in both jam types, but 
flavonols were well retained. Marked losses of anthocyanins and procyanidins 
occurred over 6 months of storage and were accompanied by increased polymeric 
color values. Chlorogenic acid levels also declined during storage, but 
flavonols and ORAC changed little. Jams stored at 4 degrees C retained higher 
levels of anthocyanins, procyanidins, and ORAC and had lower polymeric color 
values than jams stored at 25 degrees C. Sugar-free jams retained higher levels 
of anthocyanins and had lower polymeric color values than sugar jams late during 
storage. Blueberry jams should be refrigerated to better retain polyphenolics 
and antioxidant capacity.

Minor polar compounds of 88 extra virgin olive oils were analyzed by HPLC-DAD-MS 
(high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector-mass spectrometry) 
and by the Folin-Ciocalteu (FC) spectrophotometric method, to validate and 
evaluate, for olive oils, the linear association between FC and HPLC data. The 
Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between HPLC and FC results. 
The highest, positive R were related with deacetoxyoleuropein aglycone (R = 
0.93) and oleuropein aglycone (R = 0.93) as single compounds and with the sum of 
orthodiphenols (R = 0.94) and the sum of all compounds (R = 0.95), showing that 
both estimations of total phenols content are reliably correlated, regardless 
for the absolute contents and are independent of the relative composition of the 
phenolic fraction. On the other hand the HPLC quantifications of apigenin and 
lignans showed no significant correlation with FC. These results, supported also 
by principal component analysis, may suggest caution about the interpretation of 
FC results to compare olive oils with very different phenolic profiles.

This study investigates the potential of spent coffee grounds aqueous extract 
(SCGAE) as a natural preservative for deep-water pink shrimp (DWPS). The SCGAE 
was initially assessed for chemical profiling, antioxidant, and antimicrobial 
activity. DWPS samples were treated with SCGAE (0.5, 0.75, and 1%) against salt 
0.1% (positive control) and stored under vacuum and air at frozen conditions. 
Total phenolic content TPC (as mg gallic acid equivalent, GAE), antioxidant 
activity (as mg ascorbic acid equivalent, AAE), total viable counts (TVCs), 
coliform bacteria (CB), and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were measured. 
Chlorogenic acids and derivatives (over 65%) were the main SCGAE compounds 
contributing to significant antioxidant (EC50DPPH = 1.04 mg/mL) and 
antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacterium (Staphylococcus aureus), 
Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella 
pneumoniae, Vibrio anguillarum, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus), and a yeast 
(Candida albicans) with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.06-0.13 mg/mL. 
Incorporating SCGAE at 0.5, 0.75, and 1% enriched DWPS meat with phenolics (TPC 
was between 92.38-116.65 mg GAE/100 g) and antioxidants (7.65-19.86 mg 
AAE/100 g) in a dose-dependent manner while increasing pigments level. Samples 
stored under vacuum exhibited higher antioxidant levels than positive and 
negative controls. SCGAE 1% reduced the microbial load (TVC, CB, and LAB) 
significantly up to 90% under different storage conditions. Scanning electronic 
microscopy showed a dense and uniform coating of SCGAE, improving DWPS 
antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, flavor, and acceptability. To 
conclude, SCGAE is a promising natural alternative to synthetic food 
preservatives, improving phenolic content, antioxidant activity, and 
microbiological quality of preserved shrimp.

Several recent reports have been published indicating that the antioxidant 
activity of olive oil and tea leaves is not stable over product shelf lives of 
about one year. We have measured the antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, 
flavan-3-ols monomers, and procyanidin levels in milk and dark chocolate, in 
cocoa powder, and in cocoa beans. Results show that for the cocoa products 
studied, antioxidant activity, and flavan-3-ol levels are stable over typical 
shelf lives of one year under controlled storage and over 2 years in ambient 
storage in the laboratory. We also show that 80 year old cocoa powder and 116 
year old cocoa beans still show very high levels of antioxidant activity and 
flavan-3-ol content.

USA.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of consumption of fermented and unfermented 
soy products on excretion of urinary isoflavonoid phytoestrogens and lignans in 
healthy men.
DESIGN: A randomized, crossover trial consisting of two 9-day feeding periods 
following 5 days of baseline data collection.
SUBJECTS: Healthy men, aged 20 to 40 years, were recruited from the University 
of Minnesota Twin Cities community. Of the 22 subjects who began the study, 17 
completed all feeding periods.
INTERVENTIONS: Fermented soy product (112 g tempeh) or unfermented soy (125 g 
soybean pieces) was consumed during each controlled feeding period.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Urine samples collected while subjects consumed their 
habitual diets and on the last 3 days of each feeding period were analyzed for 
isoflavonoid and lignan content by isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED: Comparisons of isoflavonoid and lignan excretion 
were analyzed using the general linear model procedure. Orthogonal contrasts 
were used to determine treatment differences of interest.
RESULTS: Urinary excretion of isoflavonoids (equol, O-desmethylangolensin 
[O-DMA], daidzein, genistein) was higher and excretion of lignans (enterodiol, 
enterolactone) was lower when subjects consumed soy-supplemented diets than when 
they consumed their habitual diets (P < .05). Urinary isoflavonoid excretion and 
lignan excretion were similar when subjects consumed tempeh and soybean pieces 
diets; however, recovery of daidzein and genistein was significantly higher when 
subjects consumed the tempeh diet than when they consumed the soybean pieces 
diet (P < .002). When fed soy, 5 of 17 subjects excreted high amounts of equol. 
These five subjects tended to excrete less O-DMA and daidzein than the 12 
subjects who excreted low amounts of equol (P < .06).
CONCLUSIONS: Fermentation of soy decreased the isoflavone content of the product 
fed but increased the urinary isoflavonoid recovery. This finding suggests that 
fermentation increases availability of isoflavones in soy.

55108, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of vegetable, fruit, and legume consumption on 
urinary isoflavonoid phytoestrogen and lignan excretion.
DESIGN: After 4 days of data collection, during which subjects consumed their 
habitual diets, subjects were randomly placed on four 9-day controlled 
experimental diets with each subject receiving each diet in a random order.
SUBJECTS: Seven men and three women, aged 20 to 35 years, were recruited from 
the University of Minnesota Twin Cities community.
INTERVENTIONS: All subjects consumed four experimental diets in an assigned 
random order: a controlled basal diet, a legume/allium diet (containing garbanzo 
beans, garlic, and onions), and diets low or high in vegetables and fruits 
(containing apples, pears, potatoes, and carrots).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Urine samples that were collected while subjects consumed 
their habitual diets and during the last 3 days of each feeding period were 
analyzed for isoflavonoid and lignan content using isotope dilution gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED: The effect of vegetable and fruit intake on 
urinary isoflavonoid and lignan excretion was analyzed using the general linear 
model procedure. Post hoc comparisons were made using Duncan's multiple range 
test.
RESULTS: Subjects excreted more of the lignan enterodiol on the high 
vegetable/fruit diet compared with the basal and legume/allium diets (P = .03); 
more of the isoflavonoids O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA), genistein, and sum of 
isoflavonoids on the legume/allium diet compared with the other controlled diets 
(P < .05); and more of the isoflavan equol on the basal and legume/allium diets 
compared with the high vegetable/fruit diet (P < .01). Subjects who excreted 
higher levels of equol on the basal and legume/allium diets also consumed more 
of the milk-based pudding provided as part of the controlled diets.
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary lignan and isoflavonoid excretion changed in response to 
alterations in vegetable, fruit, and legume intake under controlled dietary 
conditions.

The study focused on the effects of processing and storage on the stability of 
flaxseed-derived secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) added to various bakery 
products. The SDG concentration of doughs, baked rye breads, graham buns, and 
muffins was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array 
detection; the baked products were analyzed immediately after baking and upon 
storage at room temperature for 1 week and at -25 degrees C for 1 and 2 months, 
respectively. Added SDG was found to withstand normal baking temperatures in all 
bakery products. SDG also was a relatively stable compound during storage. 
Similarly, the content of SDG in flax buns containing fat-free flaxseed meal was 
unaffected by storage. We conclude that cereal-based bakery products can be 
supplemented with flaxseed-derived SDG.

Peanut and its derivatives, especially peanut butter, are extensively consumed 
in many countries, mainly in the United States, which is also the major exporter 
of these products. trans-Resveratrol is present in peanuts, and recently this 
compound has been quantified in peanut butter. It is well-known that there are 
beneficial effects of trans-resveratrol and its glucoside, the piceid, in 
health. The absorption of trans-resveratrol has been proven in animals, and 
certain studies show that the absorption of some phenols is enhanced by 
conjugation with glucose, so that it could be possible that trans-piceid would 
be more absorbed than its aglycon (trans-resveratrol). In our work, we have 
identified the presence of trans-piceid in peanut butter with a new method to 
quantify trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid (3-beta-glucose of 
trans-resveratrol). This fact is very interesting because the glucosilated form 
could be more easily absorbed by the intestinal gut; in this way trans-piceid 
would exercise its beneficial function more efficiently than trans-resveratrol. 
To our knowledge, this is the first time that trans-piceid has been quantified 
in peanut butter. Resveratrol and piceid contents in natural peanut butters were 
found to be significantly higher than those in blended peanut butters.

Anthocyanins, kind of flavonoids (FL) found in plants and vegetables, are known 
to have varieties of physiological functions. In the present study, we examined 
absorption and metabolism of delphinidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside (Dp3G) in rats. 
Dp3G appeared in the plasma at 15 min after oral administration as an intact 
glucosidic form. The plasma level also showed another peak at 60 min. One 
metabolite peak was detected in the plasma and the structure was assigned as 
4'-O-methyl Dp3G (MDp3G) by NMR and MS. The metabolite was also identified in 
several tissues as a major metabolite especially in the liver. No 3'-O-methyl 
Dp3G was detected in any tissues, therefore, 4'-OH methylation is the main path 
of Dp3G metabolism in rats. This finding generalized the metabolic formation of 
FL having pyrogallol B ring because it has been reported that FL having catechol 
structure produced 3'-O-methyl-derivatives, but FL having pyrogallol structure 
produced 4'-O-methyl-derivatives.

We previously determined that five rather hydrophobic metabolites appeared in 
blood plasma after oral administration of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 
but a group of hydrophilic metabolites still remained unidentified. In the 
present study, 12 hydrophilic metabolites found were collected from urine and 
plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and then 
analyzed by tandem MS spectrometry. From the MS spectra, four metabolites out of 
12 were assigned as glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and six 
out of 12 were glucuronides of the primary metabolites of cyanidin 
3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside). 
Extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and O-methyl 
cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside showed their maximum plasma concentrations 
at 15 and 60 min (or 30 min) after oral administration, respectively. Their 
maximum plasma concentrations ranged from 15 to 70 nM. From the profile of 
urinary-excreted anthocyanins after intravenous administration, it was deduced 
that extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and O-methyl 
cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside were mainly produced in the liver rather 
than by intestinal flora. The area under the plasma concentration curve was 0.25 
micromol min/L for extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside 
and 0.14 micromol min/L for O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 
respectively, when evaluated as cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside equivalent, 
indicating that extended glucuronidation is a critical pathway in cyanidin 
3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside metabolism in rats.

Bioavailability and tissue distribution of anthocyanins in bilberry (Vaccinium 
myrtillus L.) extract in rats.

Ichiyanagi T(1), Shida Y, Rahman MM, Hatano Y, Konishi T.

Life Sciences, 265-1, Higashijima, Niigata 956-8603, Japan.

To clarify how structural diversity of anthocyanins relates to their in vivo 
function, bioavailability was precisely studied in rats using bilberry 
(Vaccinium myrtillus L.) extract (Bilberon 25) as an anthocyanin source that 
contains 15 different anthocyanins. The bilberry extract was orally or 
intravenously administered to rats, and the plasma levels of each anthocyanin 
were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. As the result, all 
anthocyanins except peonidin 3-O-alpha-L-arabinoside were detectable in the 
blood plasma. The plasma concentration of anthocyanins as a whole reached the 
maximum level of 1.2 microM at 15 min after oral administration of 400 mg/kg 
bilberry extract (153.2 mg/kg as anthocyanins) and then decreased with time. 
Uptake and decay profiles of each anthocyanin in the plasma were almost the same 
for all anthocyanins except a few with their maximum after 30 min. Among the 
anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone, the plasma level after 15 min of oral 
administration was as follows: galactoside > glucoside > arabinoside. Plasma 
clearance of anthocyanins after intravenous administration clearly showed that 
arabinoside disappeared more rapidly than glucoside and galactoside. On the 
other hand, when anthocyanins carrying the same sugar moiety were compared, the 
half disappearance time of plasma anthocyanins was in the following order: 
delphinidin > cyanidin > petunidin = peonidin > malvidin. The bioavailability of 
anthocyanins was in the range of 0.61-1.82% and was 0.93% as the anthocyanin 
mixture. The bioavailability of anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone was in 
the following order: Galactoside showed the highest followed by glucoside and 
arabinoside for cyanidin and delphinidin, but arabinoside and galactoside showed 
a higher bioavailability than glucoside for petunidin and malvidin. Anthocyanins 
recovered in urine and bile during the first 4 h after intravenous 
administration were only 30.8 and 13.4%, respectively. Anthocyanin profiles in 
tissues were quite different from those in blood plasma. The major anthocyanins 
distributed in liver and kidney were the O-methyl anthocyanins such as peonidin, 
malvidin, and other O-methyl anthocyanins derived from delphinidin, cyanidin, 
and petunidin-glycosides.

Total and free phenolic contents of 16 commonly consumed fruits (comprising 9 
apples, 4 pears, and one each of peach, plum, and kiwi fruit cultivars) were 
measured by Folin-Ciocalteu assay. Total phenol contents varied from 272 to 475 
mg of CtE/100 g of fresh weight. Of the apple cultivars studied, Braeburn and 
Empire had the highest and lowest total phenol content, respectively. The apple 
cultivars ranked in the following decreasing order: Braeburn > Red Delicious > 
Crisp Pink > Granny Smith > Royal Gala > Bramley > Golden Delicious > Fuji > 
Empire. Among pear cultivars, the order was Forelle > Taylor's > Peckham's > 
Conference. Peach and plum equally had high contents. The percentage of 
conjugated phenolics ranged between 3 (Red Delicious) and 77% (Empire) of the 
total phenols. Comparison of different cultivars of the same fruit and between 
different fruits showed broad variations in both phenolic content and in vitro 
antioxidant activity; a weak correlation (R(2) = 0.58) was observed between the 
phenolic content of the fruits and the total antioxidant activity, as estimated 
by the FRAP assay. The calculated dietary intake of total, free, and conjugated 
phenols from average per capita consumption of apples and pears in different 
regions of the U.K. varied between 104-126, 53-64, and 51-62 mg of CtE/day, 
respectively.

Fresh aerial parts of different chicory varieties: green chicory (c.v. 
""Catalogna""), two red chicory varieties (""radicchio rosso di Chioggia"" and 
""radicchio rosso di Treviso""), and Witloof or Belgian endive were analyzed by 
HPLC/DAD/MS. The chromatographic fingerprint was diagnostic for each variety. A 
monocaffeoyl tartaric acid, chlorogenic acid, and chicoric acid were detected in 
all the varieties, while cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-(6'' malonyl) 
glucoside, and cyanidin 3-O-(6'' malonyl) glucoside were the main phenolic 
compounds in the red varieties. The flavonoidic compounds, quercetin 
3-O-glucuronide and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide, were absent in the Witloof sample. 
The phenolic compounds from total leaves were the same as those obtained from 
only the colored parts; nevertheless, the total amount was remarkably lower with 
a decrease of up to 80% for Belgian endive. Chemical stability at high 
temperature was observed for the phenolic fraction from the green variety after 
decoction at 100 degrees C for 30 min.

192-8508, Japan.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the absorption of a citrus flavonoid, 
naringin, as its glycosylated form. Six healthy volunteers (three males and 
three females) were studied. After a single oral administeration of 500 mg of 
naringin, intact naringin was isolated from 2-4 h urine. Isolated naringin was 
identified by the LC/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), MS/MS, 
and MS/MS/MS techniques. The cumulative urinary excretion of naringin and its 
metabolites (naringenin and naringenin glucuronides) was determined by HPLC for 
0-24 h. Approximately 0.02% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as 
unchanged naringin, whereas urinary recoveries of naringenin and naringenin 
glucuronides were approximately 0.4 and 3.6% of the administered dose, 
respectively. It was concluded that trace amounts of orally administered 
naringin can be absorbed as the glycoside. However, it is not clear whether the 
glycoside is cleaved before or after absorption to generate naringenin.

on physical and antioxidant properties.

di Parma, Parma, Italy.

BACKGROUND: Several studies investigated the impact of different cooking 
techniques on the quality of vegetables. However, the use of the combined 
air-steam cooking is still scarcely debated, despite the advantages informally 
referred by professional catering workers. In this study, its optimisation was 
studied on Brussels sprouts and pumpkin cubes to obtain the best physical 
(texture, colour) and antioxidant (FRAP, total phenols) response, in comparison 
to a conventional steaming treatment.
RESULTS: Increasing the strength of the air-steam treatment, Brussels sprouts 
resulted to be softer, less green (higher a* value), richer in phenols and 
exhibited lower FRAP values than the steamed ones. The air-steamed pumpkin cubes 
exhibited an equivalent softening degree to that of steamed ones and, under the 
strongest cooking conditions, a higher antioxidant quality and a yellow 
darkening (lower b* value). Varying the cooking time and/or temperature, a 
linear change of force/compression hardness and a* (negative a*: greenness) for 
Brussels sprouts, b* (yellowness) and total phenol content for pumpkin cubes was 
observed. A predictive model for these variables was obtained by response 
surface methodology. The best process conditions to achieve the optimal 
desirability were also identified.
CONCLUSION: The application of air-steam cooking under suitable time/temperature 
conditions could be proposed as an alternative method to a traditional steam 
cooking on Brussels sprouts and pumpkin cubes, being able to preserve or improve 
their quality. The best air-steam cooking conditions were 25 min at 90 °C for 
Brussels sprouts and 10 min at 110 °C for pumpkin. © 2017 Society of Chemical

Sterol ferulate, free sterol, and 5-alk(en)ylresorcinol constituents of wheat, 
rye, and corn bran oils were studied. Among the sterol ferulates, one novel 
compound, 24-methylenecholestanol ferulate (7), along with six known compounds, 
namely, 24-methylcholestanol ferulate (1), 24-methylcholesterol ferulate (2), 
2-methyllathosterol ferulate (3), stigmastanol ferulate (4), sitosterol ferulate 
(5), and schottenol ferulate (6), were isolated and characterized. Five known 
free sterols, namely, 24-methylcholesterol (8), stigmastanol (9), sitosterol 
(10), schottenol (11), and stigmasterol (12), were isolated and identified. 
5-Alk(en)ylresorcinols were found in wheat and rye bran oils but not in corn 
bran oil. Of these, one new compound, 5-n-(2'-oxo-14'-Z-heneicosenyl) resorcinol 
(19), and seven known compounds, namely, 5-n-heptadecyl- (13), 5-n-nonadecyl- 
(14), 5-n-heneicosyl- (15), 5-n-tricosyl- (16), 5-n-pentacosyl- (17), 
5-n-(14'-Z-nonadecenyl)- (18), and 5-n-(2'-oxoheneicosyl)resorcinols (20), were 
isolated and characterized. These compounds were evaluated with respect to their 
inhibitory effects on the induction of Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) 
by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells, which is known to 
be a primary screening test for antitumor promoters. Four compounds, 1, 2, 4, 
and 11, showed potent inhibitory effects on EBV-EA induction.

Sesame exhibits many beneficial physiological effects, which are mostly related 
to its lignan compounds, such as sesaminol glucosides. This investigation 
studies the distribution and elimination of sesaminol triglucoside from sesame 
in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. In order to investigate the distribution of 
sesaminol triglucoside (p.o. 500 mg/kg) in SD rats, the changes in concentration 
of sesaminol triglucoside and its metabolites were determined in tissues and 
plasma within 24 h period after tube-feeding to SD rats. Results showed that 
sesaminol triglucoside may be deglycosylated to form sesaminol first by 
intestinal microflora and then incorporated via lymphatic absorption into the 
cardiovascular system, transported to other tissues. The concentrations of 
sesaminol triglucoside and its metabolites in rectum, caecum, colon, and small 
intestines are higher than those in liver, lung, kidney, and heart. Its 
concentration in brain is low but detectable. Glucuronidation and sulfation was 
the main metabolic pathway for sesaminol in urine, and fecal elimination was a 
major route of elimination. From LC/MS/MS analysis of rat organs, sesaminol 
triglucoside can be converted to mammalian lignans, enterodiol (END), and 
enterolactone (ENL), by rat intestinal microflora. In the plasma, concentrations 
of END and ENL were 5.9 +/- 0.2 and 5.5 +/- 0.2 micromol/mL, respectively.

Methods were developed for the analysis of natural antioxidants including 
phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beverages and plant extracts using gradient 
HPLC with multi-channel electrochemical coulometric detection. Suitability of 
various reversed-phase columns for this purpose was compared; pH and mobile 
phase gradients were optimized with respect to the separation selectivity and 
sensitivity of detection. Because of different target compounds in various 
sample types, the overlapping resolution maps and the normalized resolution 
product approaches described earlier were used to select optimum columns and 
gradients to suit the analysis of the individual sample types. The methods were 
applied to the analysis of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beer, wine, tea, 
and yacon extracts. 32 phenolic compounds were identified and determined, 
including derivatives of benzoic and cinnamic acids, flavones, and a few related 
glycosides. Eight-channel CoulArray detection offers high selectivity and 
sensitivity with limits of detection in the low microg L(-1) range, at least an 
order of magnitude lower than single-channel coulometric detection using the 
Coulochem detector. No special sample pretreatment is necessary and, because of 
the compatibility of the CoulArray detector with gradient elution, phenolic 
antioxidants of different polarities can be determined in a single run. In 
addition to the retention times, the ratios of the areas of the pre-dominant and 
post-dominant peaks to the area of the dominant peak can be used for improved 
identification of natural antioxidants.

Commercially available curcumin, a bright orange-yellow color pigment of 
turmeric, consists of a mixture of three curcuminoids, namely, curcumin, 
demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin. These were isolated by column 
chromatography and identified by spectroscopic studies. The purity of the 
curcuminoids was analyzed by an improved HPLC method. HPLC separation was 
performed on a C(18) column using three solvents, methanol, 2% AcOH, and 
acetonitrile, with detection at 425 nm. Four different commercially available 
varieties of turmeric, namely, Salem, Erode, Balasore, and local market samples, 
were analyzed to detect the percentage of these three curcuminoids. The 
percentages of curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin as 
estimated using their calibration curves were found to be 1.06 +/- 0.061 to 5.65 
+/- 0.040, 0.83 +/- 0.047 to 3.36 +/- 0.040, and 0.42 +/- 0.036 to 2.16 +/- 
0.06, respectively, in four different samples. The total percentages of 
curcuminoids are 2.34 +/- 0.171 to 9.18 +/- 0.232%.

The metabolic fate of the dietary isoflavones daidzein and genistein was 
investigated in human volunteers challenged with soya. Urinary diphenols, 
isolated by partition chromatography on Sephadex LH-20, were characterized and 
identified by profile capillary gas chromatography (GC) and electron ionization 
mass spectrometry (GC-EIMS) analysis of the trimethylsilyl ether (TMS) 
derivatives. Novel isoflavonic phytoestrogens found in the urine of volunteers 
were those of tetrahydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, 
6'-hydroxy-O-demethylangolesin and 2-dehydro-O-demethylangolensin. Other known 
diphenols identified were those of equal, dehydrodaidzein, O-demethylangolensin, 
daidzein, genistein, glycitein, and the lignan enterolactone. Two other urinary 
isomers with a fragmentation pattern closely resembling that of the persilylated 
TMS ethers of cis/trans-isomers of tetrahydrodaidzein, were characterized based 
on the elucidation of fragments associated with the loss of a non-phenolic-OTMS 
functional group in ring-C. These are fragments presented in the persilylated 
mass spectra of isoflavan-4-ols and isoflav-3-ene-4-ols, demonstrated here by a 
combination of simple and tandem mass spectrometry study of the deuterated 
persilylated TMS ethers of dihydrodaidzein. In a similar study we also present 
the data on the structural identification and fragment elucidation of the 
keto/enol tautomers of the TMS ether derivatives of the dihydro derivatives of 
daidzein and genistein, observed in the urine of volunteers and considered 
probable products of the derivatization process. Finally, the GC and GC-MS data 
of two unknown isoflavonoids and that of a lignan-like compound are presented 
together with those of dihydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, tetrahydrodaidzein and 
2-dehydro-O-demethylangolensin. The latter four were obtained here as products 
of small scale chemical synthesis in a preliminary study on the tentative 
identification of urinary isoflavonoids in human volunteers challenged with 
soya.

Flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) is a rich source of nutritive and bioactive 
compounds. The research evaluated the disparity in phytochemical profiles along 
with total and cellular antioxidant activities between oil and fiber flaxseeds. 
There were significant differences in total phenolics, total flavonoids and 
antioxidant activities among the six cultivars of fiber and oil flaxseed, 
respectively. Four phytochemical compounds including caffeic acid, p-coumaric 
acid and ferulic acid, and secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) were 
identified and quantified in the cultivars of oil and fiber flaxseed by HPLC 
analysis. Notably, the average of total phenolic and flavonoid contents, along 
with total antioxidant activities between fiber and oil flaxseeds were not 
different significantly; even the cellular antioxidant activity of fiber 
flaxseed was superior to oil flaxseed. These results suggest that fiber 
flaxseeds would be valuable candidates as functional products and dietary 
supplements production owing to the higher bioactive values as well as oil 
flaxseeds.

A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separation method with 
photo-diode array (PDA) and mass spectrometric (MS) detection was developed to 
determine and quantify flavonols, flavones, and flavanones in fruits, vegetables 
and beverages. The compounds were analysed as aglycones, obtained after acid 
hydrolysis of freeze-dried food material. Identification was based on retention 
time, UV and mass spectra by comparison with commercial standards, and the UV 
peak areas were used for quantitation of the flavonoid contents. Examples of 
HPLC-MS, analyses of orange pulp, tomato, and apple are presented. The method 
has been used to screen foods on the Danish market, and the contents of 
flavones, flavonols, and flavanones were measured.

Interaction of vitamin C and flavonoids in elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.) during 
juice processing.

Kaack K(1), Austed T.

A field experiment and two oxidation experiments in the laboratory were carried 
out. The content of the major anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-G) and 
cyanidin-3-sambubioside (Cy-3-Sa), in the fresh fruits from the 13 cultivars 
were from 361 to 1266 and from 269 to 656 mg/100 g, respectively. The two minor 
anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-sambubioside-5-glucoside (Cy-3-Sa-5-G) and 
cyanidin-3.5-diglucoside (Cy-3.5-dG), occurred in concentrations between 5 and 
47 mg/100 g. The content of ascorbic acid and quercetin in the fresh fruits of 
the cultivars varied from 6 to 25, and from 29 to 60 mg/100 g, respectively. 
Purging of the elderberry juice with N2 and/or addition of ascorbic acid reduced 
the oxidative degradation rate of the two major anthocyanins and quercetin. 
Ascorbic acid protected the anthocyanins, but not quercetin from oxidative 
degradation. Mixing of fruits with air during processing and even a low content 
of oxygen in the juice before tapping must be avoided by appropriate steps 
during processing. Improvement of the nutritional value of the elderberry juice 
and increased protection of anthocyanins against oxidative degradation may 
potentially be obtained by selection of cultivars with a high content of 
ascorbic acid.

Ethnobotanical reports from Latvia show that Tanacetum vulgare, Calluna 
vulgaris, Quercus robur, Artemisa absinthium, and Artemisia vulgaris contain 
phenolic compounds that have antioxidant properties, which can be beneficial in 
the treatment and prophylaxis of many diseases. The aim of this study was to 
characterize the phenolic compounds and antioxidant properties of these plants. 
Plant extracts were prepared using ethanol or acetone and then freeze-dried. 
Their total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total 
tannin content (TTC) were determined and characterized by HPLC. Their 
antioxidant properties were determined using a DPPH 
(2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging assay. C. vulgaris herb and 
T. vulgare leaf extracts contained the highest amounts of flavonoids, but the 
bark of Q. robur had mostly tannins and phenolic acids. A. absinthium and A. 
vulgaris had the lowest amounts of polyphenols. When compared using extraction 
solvents, all acetone extracts had more TPC, more TFC, and better antioxidant 
activity. All plants contained chlorogenic acid, which contributes to 
antioxidant properties. The analysed plant extracts could be used in future 
studies to develop medicinal products with antioxidant properties.

Figs are consumed fresh, dried, or processed into confectionery, compotes, and 
candies. Key consumer criteria include taste, nutritional value, and functional 
properties. The study focused on characterizing the biochemical and antioxidant 
properties of 51 Moroccan fig cultivars from oases and Atlas regions. The 
following determinations were assessed sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose, and 
total sugars), organic acids (malic acid, citric acid, and total organic acids), 
total polyphenols and antioxidant activity. The results reveal significant 
variation among studied cultivars. Total sugars, glucose, fructose, and 
antioxidant activity (ABTS, FRAP) are the most discriminating parameters. 
Additionally, the cultivars from oases 'Mrotchi' (MR2), 'Mrotchi' (MR4) and 
'Tabkhant' (TB1) exhibit the highest total polyphenols content (610.07, 681.43, 
and 582.76 mg GAE/100 g dw, respectively) and exceptionally high antioxidant 
activities (11.03, 13.88, and 11.37 mmol Trolox/kg, respectively). Additionally, 
the cultivars 'Ain Hajla' (AH5) and 'Tazizawt' (TZ) from southeastern oases, as 
well as the cultivar 'Beida' (BD1) from the Atlas Mountain, exhibit high levels 
of glucose and fructose. This study highlights the substantial biochemical 
diversity in Moroccan fig cultivars, providing valuable insights for the 
selection of genetic pools with desirable chemotypes, ultimately benefiting 
consumer health.

The consumption of 'not-from-concentrate' (NFC) fruit juices can be a convenient 
and enjoyable way to incorporate the nutritional benefits and flavors of fruits 
into one's diet. This study will focus on the effect of production of juices 
from apple and pear fruits, by using centrifugal decanter and tangential 
filtration, on the profile of polyphenols as a valuable source of bioactive 
compounds. Likewise, by-products from the juice industry were characterized in 
order to understand the high-value-added potential based on their composition of 
polyphenols. Briefly, apple and apple juice showed great contents of chlorogenic 
acid (0.990 ± 0.021 mg/g of DW), the dihydrochalcone phloridzin (1.041 ± 0.062 
mg/g of DW), procyanidins (0.733 ± 0.121 mg/g of DW) and quercetin derivatives 
(1.501 ± 0.192 mg/g of DW). Likewise, the most abundant compounds in pear and 
pear juices were chlorogenic acid (0.917 ± 0.021 mg/g of DW), caffeoylquinic 
acid (0.180 ± 0.029 mg/g of DW), procyanidins (0.255 ± 0.016 mg/g of DW) and 
quercetin derivatives (0.181 ± 0.004 mg/g of DW). Both temperature and 
tangential speed affect the amount of phenolic compounds in fruit juices, 
highlighting the need to control the technological process to obtain a more 
nutritious/healthier beverage. Overall, NFC juices arise as a better option when 
compared with concentrated juices. Furthermore, the higher yield of phenolic 
compounds found in fruit pomace clearly open new ways for upcycling this fruit 
by-product as a high-value-added ingredient.

Fresh strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.), raspberries (Rubus idaeus 
Michx.), highbush blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum L.), and lowbush blueberries 
(Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton) were stored at 0, 10, 20, and 30 degrees C for 
up to 8 days to determine the effects of storage temperature on whole fruit 
antioxidant capacity (as measured by the oxygen radical absorbing capacity 
assay, Cao et al., Clin. Chem. 1995, 41, 1738-1744) and total phenolic, 
anthocyanin, and ascorbate content. The four fruit varied markedly in their 
total antioxidant capacity, and antioxidant capacity was strongly correlated 
with the content of total phenolics (0.83) and anthocyanins (0.90). The 
antioxidant capacity of the two blueberry species was about 3-fold higher than 
either strawberries or raspberries. However, there was an increase in the 
antioxidant capacity of strawberries and raspberries during storage at 
temperatures >0 degrees C, which was accompanied by increases in anthocyanins in 
strawberries and increases in anthocyanins and total phenolics in raspberries. 
Ascorbate content differed more than 5-fold among the four fruit species; on 
average, strawberries and raspberries had almost 4-times more ascorbate than 
highbush and lowbush blueberries. There were no ascorbate losses in strawberries 
or highbush blueberries during 8 days of storage at the various temperatures, 
but there were losses in the other two fruit species. Ascorbate made only a 
small contribution (0.4-9.4%) to the total antioxidant capacity of the fruit. 
The increase observed in antioxidant capacity through postharvest phenolic 
synthesis and metabolism suggested that commercially feasible technologies may 
be developed to enhance the health functionality of small fruit crops.

Olive oil and fruit samples from six cultivars sampled at four different 
maturity stages were discriminated into cultivars and maturity stages. The 
variables-volatile and phenolic compounds-that significantly (p < 0.01) 
discriminated cultivars and maturity stage groups were identified. Separation by 
stepwise linear discriminant analysis revealed that Manzanilla olive cultivar 
was separated from cultivars Leccino, Barnea, Mission, Corregiola, and Paragon, 
whereas cultivars Corregiola and Paragon formed a cluster. The volatile 
compounds hexanol, hexanal, and 1-penten-3-ol were responsible for the 
discrimination of cultivars. All maturity stages were discriminated, with the 
separation of early stages attributed to oil phenolic compounds, tyrosol and 
oleuropein derivatives, whereas the volatile compounds (E)-2-hexenal, hexanol, 
1-penten-3-ol, and (Z)-2-penten-3-ol characterized the separation of all 
maturity stages and in particular the late stages. Hexanol and 1-penten-3-ol 
characterized the separation of both cultivars and maturity stages.

Virgin olive oils produced at wide ranges of malaxation temperatures (15, 30, 
45, and 60 degrees C) and times (30, 60, 90, and 120 min) in a complete 
factorial experimental design were discriminated with stepwise linear 
discriminant analysis (SLDA) revealing differences with processing conditions. 
Virgin olive oils produced at 15 and 60 degrees C for 30 min showed the most 
significant (p < 0.01) differences. Discrimination was based upon volatile and 
phenolic compounds detected in olive oils, peroxide value (PV), free fatty acids 
(FFA), ultraviolet (UV) absorbances, and oil yield. There were different 
discriminating variables for processing conditions illustrating the dependence 
of virgin olive oil quality on malaxation time and temperature. Volatile 
compounds were the dominant discriminating variables. Common oxidation 
indicators of olive oil (PV, K232, and K270) were not among the variables that 
significantly (p < 0.01) changed with malaxation time and temperature. Variables 
that discriminated both malaxation time and temperature were hexanal, 
3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ethyl alcohol-decarboxymethyl elenolic acid dialdehyde 
(3,4-DHPEA-DEDA) and FFA, whereas 1-penten-3-ol, E-2-hexenal, octane, tyrosol, 
and vanillic acid significantly (p < 0.01) changed with temperature only and 
Z-2-penten-1-ol, (+)-acetoxypinoresinol, and oil yield changed with time only. 
Virgin olive oil quality was significantly influenced by malaxation temperature, 
whereas oil yield discriminated malaxation time. This study demonstrates the two 
modes of hexanal formation: enzymatic and nonenzymatic during virgin olive oil 
extraction.

It is unknown whether the bioavailability of isoflavones is affected by the 
concomitant ingestion of glucosides or aglycones. This study was designed to 
investigate the effects of soymilk-based beverages containing different types of 
isoflavones on their absorption, excretion, and metabolism. Twelve healthy 
volunteers consumed 3 kinds of soymilk: untreated soymilk, 
beta-glucosidase-treated soymilk, and fermented soymilk. Blood samples were 
collected after 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 24 h. Urine samples were 
collected from 0 to 48 h. Concentrations of isoflavones and daidzein metabolites 
in serum and urine were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
After the ingestion of soymilk, the total concentration of isoflavones in serum 
rose slowly and reached a maximum of 0.94 +/- 0.39 micromol/L at 6.0 +/- 1.2 h. 
However, beta-glucosidase-treated soymilk and fermented soymilk increased the 
serum isoflavone concentration significantly more quickly with maximum 
concentrations at 1.0 h of 1.75 +/- 0.33 micromol/L and 2.05 +/- 0.32 
micromol/L, respectively. The urinary excretion of isoflavones after ingesting 
of these aglycone-enriched preparations was significantly greater than after 
consumption of untreated soymilk up to 8 h after injection, but not thereafter. 
The total and individual concentrations of isoflavones in serum and urine did 
not differ when subjects consumed the 2 aglycone-enriched soymilks. However, in 
equol producers (n = 5), the ingestion of ESM tended to increase urinary 
excretion of equol compared with the consumption of FSM (P = 0.08). These 
results demonstrated that the isoflavone aglycones of soymilk were absorbed 
faster and in greater amounts than their glucosides in healthy adults and that 
the metabolism of isoflavones might be affected by the type of soymilk consumed.

BACKGROUND: Polyphenols have been shown to be effective against many chronic 
diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, the consumption of 
raisins, being a food rich in polyphenols, has been attributed with 
neuroprotective benefits. Therefore, our main objective is to evaluate the 
effect of including 50 g of raisins in the diet daily for 6 months, on the 
improvement of cognitive performance, cardiovascular risk factors and markers of 
inflammation in a population of older adults without cognitive impairment.
METHODS: Design and intervention: This study will be a randomized controlled 
clinical trial of two parallel groups. Each subject included in the study will 
be randomly assigned to one of two study groups: control group (no supplement), 
intervention group (50 g of raisins daily during 6 months).
STUDY POPULATION: The participants will be selected by consecutive sampling in 
the Primary Care consultations of urban health centers in Salamanca and Zamora 
(Spain), taking into account the selection criteria.
STUDY VARIABLES: Two visits will be made, baseline and at 6 months. Cognitive 
performance will be evaluated (Mini-Mental State Examination test, Rey Auditory 
Verbal Learning Test, verbal fluency and montreal cognitive assessment (Moca)). 
It will also be analyzed the level of physical activity, quality of life, 
activities of daily living, energy and nutritional composition of the diet, body 
composition, blood pressure, heart rate, markers of inflammation and other 
laboratory tests of clinical relevance (glycaemia, total cholesterol, HDL 
cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides). In addition, sociodemographic 
data, personal and family history, medication use and alcohol and tobacco 
consumption will be collected.
DISCUSSION: In this project, it is intended to contribute to minimize the 
problems derived from cognitive deterioration in older people.

Biodegradation in marine medium of PHBV films with or without 5 % wt. of 
phenolic compounds (catechin, ferulic acid, and vanillin) was assessed at 
laboratory scale. Respirometric analyses and film disintegration kinetics were 
used to monitor the process over a period of 162 days. Structural changes in the 
films were analyzed throughout the exposure period using FESEM, DSC, 
Thermogravimetric analyses, XRD, and FTIR spectra. Respirometric tests showed 
complete biodegradation of all materials during the exposure period (the 
biodegradation half-time ranged between 63 and 79 days) but at different rates, 
depending on the phenolic compound incorporated. Ferulic acid and vanillin 
accelerate the PHBV biodegradation, whereas catechin delayed the process. 
Disintegration kinetics confirmed these results and showed that degradation 
occurred from the surface to the interior of the films. This was controlled by 
the degradation rate of the polymer amorphous phase and the formation of a 
biomass coating on the film surface. This is the result of the compounds 
generated by polymer degradation in combination with excretions from 
microorganisms. This coating has the potential to affect the enzyme diffusion to 
the polymer substrate. Moreover, the cohesion forces of the amorphous phase 
(reflected in its glass transition temperature) affected its degradation rate, 
while the slower degrading crystalline fragments were released, thus 
contributing to the disintegration process on the film's surface. Ferulic acid, 
with its hydrolytic effect, enhanced degradation, as did vanillin for its 
plasticizing and weakening effect in the amorphous phase of polymer matrix. In 
contrast, catechin with cross-linking effect hindered the progress of the 
material degradation, considerably slowing down the process rate.

The bioavailability of polyphenols in human and rodents has been discussed 
regarding their biological activity. We found different metabolite profiles of 
quercetin in rat plasma between two administration procedures. A single 
intragastric administration (50 mg/kg) resulted in the appearance of a variety 
of metabolites in the plasma, whereas only a major fraction was detected by free 
access (1% quercetin). The methylated/non-methylated metabolites ratio was much 
higher in the free access group. Mass spectrometric analyses showed that the 
fraction from free access contained highly conjugated quercetin metabolites such 
as sulfo-glucuronides of quercetin and methylquercetin. The metabolite profile 
of human plasma after an intake of onion was similar to that with intragastric 
administration in rats. In vitro oxidation of human low-density lipoprotein 
showed that methylation of the catechol moiety of quercetin significantly 
attenuated the antioxidative activity. These results might provide information 
about the bioavailability of quercetin when conducting animal experiments.

their trimethylsilyl derivatives: analysis of flavonoids, sugars, carboxylic and 
amino acids in model systems and in citrus fruits.

University, Budapest 112, Hungary.

The fragmentation patterns and quantitation possibilities of three 
anthocyanidins (pelargonidin, cyanidin, malvidin), one flavonol (quercetin), two 
flavones (apigenin, luteolin) and two flavanones (naringenin, hesperetin) have 
been investigated as trimethylsilyl and as trimethylsilyl (oxime) derivatives by 
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results proved that anthocyanidins and 
flavanones form trimethylsilyl (oximes), while flavonol and flavones provide 
simple trimethylsilyl derivatives. In all cases, characteristic fragments of 
high masses are formed proper for quantitation purposes. Hydrolysis conditions 
for naringin, hesperidin and rutin have been optimized, resulting in the 
quantitative release of naringenin, hesperetin and quercetin together with their 
corresponding saccharides. These basic studies made possible the identification 
and quantification of the flavonoid, carboxylic-/amino acid and sugar 
constituents of citrus fruit juices and albedos, without any 
extraction/enrichment procedure. In total 33 compounds have been determined in 
hydrolyzed samples, such as 2 flavonoids (naringenin and hesperetin), 6 phenolic 
acids (trimethoxybenzoic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, quinic, chlorogenic and 
rosmarinic acids), 3 aliphatic carboxylic acids (levulinic, malic, citric 
acids), phosphoric acid, 4 amino acids (aspartic, glutamic acids, alanine, 
proline), 9 monosaccharides (xylose, arabinose, rhamnose, fucose, fructose, 
galactose, glucose, galacturonic acid, sedoheptulose), inositol, sugarphosphate, 
5 disaccharides and tocopherol. Measurements were carried out as the 
trimethylsilyl (oxime) ether/ester derivatives of constituents, in the 
concentration range of 2 x 10(-3) to 49.9%. Identification level of samples 
varied between 26.4 and 77.5%, expressed in dry matter content of juices and 
albedos.

Columbia, Canada.

In the present study we investigated the metabolic conversion of cyanidin 
glycosides in human subjects using solid-phase extraction,HPLC-diode array 
detector, MS, GC, and enzymic techniques. Volunteers consumed approximately 20 g 
chokeberry extract containing 1.3 g cyanidin 3-glycosides (899 mg cyanidin 
3-galactoside, 321 mg cyanidin 3-arabinoside, 51 mg cyanidin 3-xyloside and 50 
mg cyanidin 3-glucoside). Blood samples were drawn at 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h 
post-consumption of the extract. Urine samples were also collected at 0, 4-5,and 
22-24h. We have confirmed that human subjects have the capacity to metabolise 
cyanidin 3-glycosides, as we observed at least ten individual anthocyanin 
metabolites in the urine and serum. Average concentrations of anthocyanins and 
anthocyanin metabolites in the urine reached levels of 17.9 (range 14.9-20.9) 
l.mol/l within 5 h post-consumption and persisted in 24h urine samples at levels 
of 12.1 (range 11.1-13.0) nmol/l. In addition, average total levels of 
anthocyanins and anthocyanin metabolites detected in the serum were observed at 
5917 (range 197.3-986.1) nmol/ within 2h post-consumption. Cyanidin 
3-galactoside accounted for 55.4% (9.9(range 7-2-12-6) l.mol/) and 66.0% (390.6 
(range 119.4-661-9) nmol V) of the detected anthocyanins in the urine and serum 
samples,respectively. The metabolites were identified as glucuronide conjugates, 
as well as methylated and oxidised derivatives of cyanidin 3-galactoside and 
cyanidin glucuronide. Conjugation probably affects the biological activity of 
anthocyanins and these metabolic products are likely in part responsible for the 
reported health benefits associated with the consumption of anthocyanins.

Anthocyanins are reported to have many ""health promoting"" properties; however, 
despite numerous reports of their bioactivities, their absorption and metabolism 
in humans are poorly understood. The objective of this research was to detail 
the pharmacokinetic parameters of anthocyanins after the administration of a 
721-mg oral dose of cyanidin 3-glycosides from chokeberry extract to human 
subjects. Solid-phase extraction, preparative-HPLC, preparative-TLC, HPLC-diode 
array detection, HPLC-MS, and NMR were utilized to isolate, identity, and 
quantify anthocyanins in 0- to 7-h (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 h) serum and 0- to 
24-h urine samples (total individual urine voids over 24 h). The cumulative 
concentration of total anthocyanins (parent and metabolites) detected in the 
serum (0-7 h) was 376.65 +/- 16.20 (nmol x h)/L (area under the concentration 
time curve), reaching a maximum concentration (C(max) = 96.08 +/- 6.04 nmol/L) 
within 2.8 h. The parent anthocyanins represented only 32.0% [120.63 +/- 2.85 
(nmol x h)/L] of the total anthocyanins detected with 68.0% [256.02 +/- 5.23 
(nmol x h) identified as conjugated metabolites. Additionally, the total urinary 
excretion of anthocyanins over 24 h was 1071.54 +/- 375.46 microg, reaching a 
maximal rate of excretion (R(max) = 202.74 +/- 85.06 microg/h) at 3.72 +/- 0.83 
h. Parallel to the serum data, only 32.5% (347.85 +/- 60.61 microg) of the 
anthocyanins excreted in the urine (total 24 h) were the parent compounds with 
67.5% (723.69 +/- 92.59 microg) occurring as conjugated metabolites. The 
metabolites were identified as glucuronidated and methylated derivatives of the 
parent cyanidin 3-glycosides. The above results indicate that cyanidin 
3-glycosides are rapidly absorbed and metabolized extensively following a 
moderate-to-high oral dose in humans.

Levels of total phenol, catechins, and caffeine in teas commonly consumed in the 
United Kingdom have been determined using reversed phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography. Tea bags or tea leaves were purchased from local supermarkets 
and extracted in boiling water for 5 min. The resulting data showed considerable 
variability in both total phenols [80.5-134.9 mg/g of dry matter (DM) in black 
teas and 87-106.2 mg/g of DM in green teas] and catechins (5.6-47.5, 51.5-84.3, 
and 8.5-13.9 mg/g of DM in black, green, and fruit teas, respectively); this was 
most probably a result of differing agronomic conditions, leaf age, and storage 
during and after transport, as well as the degree of fermentation. Caffeine 
contents of black teas (22-28 mg/g of DM) were significantly higher than in less 
fermented green teas (11-20 mg/g of DM). The relative concentration of the five 
major tea catechins ranked EGCG > ECG > EC > EGC > C. The estimated U.K. dietary 
intakes of total tea catechins, calculated on the basis of an average tea 
consumption of three cups of tea (200 mL cup, 1% tea leaves w/v), were 61.5, 
92.7, and 405.5 mg/day from fruit teas, black teas, and green teas, 
respectively. The coefficients of variation were 19.4, 88.6, and 17.3%, 
respectively, indicating the wide variation in these intakes. The calculated 
caffeine intake ranged between 92 and 146 mg/day. In addition, many individuals 
will consume much larger quantities of tea, of various strengths (as determined 
by the brewing conditions employed). This broad spread of U.K. daily intakes 
further emphasizes the need for additional research to relate intake and effect 
in various population groups.

14456, USA.

Total phenolics, total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity of 11 cultivars of 
fresh plums were determined using spectrophotometric methods. Identification and 
quantification of individual polyphenolics were performed using reversed-phase 
high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with a diode array detector. The 
total phenolic contents of various cultivars widely varied from 125.0 to 372.6 
mg/100 g expressed as gallic acid equivalents. The level of total flavonoids in 
fresh plums ranged between 64.8 and 257.5 mg/100 g expressed as catechin 
equivalents. Antioxidant capacity, expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant 
capacity (VCEAC), ranged from 204.9 to 567.0 mg/100 g with an average of 290.9 
mg/100 g of fresh weight. Cv. Beltsville Elite B70197 showed the highest amounts 
of total phenolics and total flavonoids and the highest VCEAC. A positive 
relationship (correlation coefficient r (2)() = 0.977) was presented between 
total phenolics and VCEAC, suggesting polyphenolics would play an important role 
in free radical scavenging. The level of IC(50) value of superoxide radical 
anion scavenging activity of the plum cultivars ranged from 13.4 to 45.7 mg of 
VCEAC/100 g. Neochlorogenic acid was the predominant polyphenolic among fresh 
plums tested. Flavonols found in plum were commonly quercetin derivatives. Rutin 
was the most predominant flavonol in plums. Various anthocyanins containing 
cyanidin aglycon and peonidin aglycon were commonly found in all plums except 
for cv. Mirabellier and NY 101.

Herein, we studied the variation in leaf and fruit morphological traits and 
antioxidant contents in 43 local and foreign cultivars (cvs) grown under the 
same experimental conditions in the widely cultivated plum species Prunus 
domestica and Prunus salicina. The peel contribution of fruit bioactive 
compounds in a serving portion, correlations among the examined parameters, and 
group patterns in each plum species were also studied. The species and cvs were 
sufficiently separated. Compared to Japanese cvs, European cvs had less 
elongated leaves and smaller and sweeter fruit with less total phenol and 
antioxidant capacities. The Japanese cvs 'Red ace' and the widely grown 'Black 
Amber', together with the European 'Tuleu Dulce', 'BlueFre', and the landrace 
'Asvestochoriou' make up groups with rich dietary sources of phytochemicals. The 
peel tissue contained higher total phenols and antioxidant capacities compared 
to the flesh, while the peel/flesh ratios varied widely among the cvs 
(6.6-fold). The variation in the antioxidant contents was lower among the cvs 
calculated per serving portion (3.7-fold); yet the peel tissue contribution was 
equal to that of the flesh (48.6%), signifying its high nutritive value. We 
observed increased sweetness in the fruit in the later-harvested cultivars, 
while cvs with more blue- and red-colored peel generally contained higher 
antioxidant contents mainly in the European plums. Moreover, larger fruit sizes 
were positively correlated with larger and more elliptic leaf shapes. In 
conclusion, the significant role of the genotype and the peel tissue as a source 
of bioactive compounds in plums were outlined with prospects of utilization in 
future breeding programs.

Nondestructive determination of lignans and lignan glycosides in sesame seeds by 
near infrared reflectance spectroscopy.

Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) contains abundant lignans including lipid-soluble 
lignans (sesamin and sesamolin) and water-soluble lignan glycosides (sesaminol 
triglucoside and sesaminol diglucoside) related to antioxidative activity. In 
this study, near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to develop a 
rapid and nondestructive method for the determination of lignan contents on 
intact sesame seeds. Ninety-three intact seeds were scanned in the reflectance 
mode of a scanning monochromator. This scanning procedure did not require the 
pulverization of samples, allowing each analysis to be completed within minutes. 
Reference values for lignan contents were obtained by high-performance liquid 
chromatography analysis. Calibration equations for lignans (sesamin and 
sesamolin) and lignan glycosides (sesaminol triglucoside and sesaminol 
diglucoside) contents were developed using modified partial least squares 
regression with internal cross-validation (n = 63). The equations obtained had 
low standard errors of cross-validation and moderate R2 (coefficient of 
determination in calibration). The prediction of an external validation set (n = 
30) showed significant correlation between reference values and NIRS predicted 
values based on the SEP (standard error of prediction), bias, and r2 
(coefficient of determination in prediction). The models developed in this study 
had relatively higher values (more than 2.0) of SD/SEP(C) for all lignans and 
lignan glycosides except for sesaminol diglucoside, which had a minor amount, 
indicating good correlation between the reference and the NIRS estimate. The 
results showed that NIRS, a nondestructive screening method, could be used to 
rapidly determine lignan and lignan glycoside contents in the breeding programs 
for high quality sesame.

Ready to drink (RTD) teas are a growing segment in the beverage category, 
brought about by improvements in the flavor of these products and healthy market 
trends driven by consumers. The presented results evaluated the antioxidant 
phytochemical stability of RTD teas from aqueous infusions of traditional green 
tea (Camellia sinensis) and a botanical tea from yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria) 
as influenced by packaging materials during cold storage. Two common packaging 
materials for RTD products are glass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and 
have been compared to a retortable pouch (RP), an emerging packaging material 
for various types of food since it is durable, inexpensive, lightweight, and 
easy to sterilize. Storage stability was then evaluated for each aqueous 
infusion prepared at 10 g/L at 90 °C for 10 min and evaluated at 3 °C in the 
absence of light over 12 weeks. Analyses included quantification and 
characterization of individual polyphenolics by high-performance liquid 
chromatography-photodiode array and liquid chromatography-electrospray 
ionization-mass spectrometry as well as changes in total antioxidant capacity. 
For green tea, concentrations of the three major flavan-3-ols, epigallocatechin 
gallate, epigallocatechin, and epicatechin gallate were better retained in glass 
bottles as compared to other packages over 12 weeks. In yaupon holly, 
chlorogenic acid and its isomers that were the predominant compounds were 
generally stable in each packaging material, and a 20.6-fold higher amount of 
saponin was found as compared to green tea, which caused higher stability of 
flavonol glycosides present in yaupon holly during storage. The antioxidant 
capacity of green tea was better retained in glass and PET versus RP, whereas no 
differences were again observed for yaupon holly. Results highlight the 
superiority of oxygen-impervious glass packaging, but viable alternatives may be 
utilizable for RTD teas with variable phytochemical compositions.

Flaxseed (FS) is a nutritional supplement with high concentrations of (n-3) 
fatty acids and lignans that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. 
The use of FS in the prevention or treatment of acute lung disease is unknown. 
In this study, we evaluated diets with high FS content in experimental murine 
models of acute lung injury and inflammation. The kinetics of lignan 
accumulation in blood, following 10% FS supplementation, was determined using 
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Mice were fed isocaloric control 
and 10% FS-supplemented diets for at least 3 wk and challenged by hyperoxia (80% 
oxygen), intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide, or acid aspiration. 
Bronchoalveolar lavage was evaluated for white blood cells, neutrophils, and 
proteins after a 24 h postintratracheal challenge of hydrochloric acid or 
lipopolysaccharide, or after 6 d of hyperoxia. Lung lipid peroxidation was 
assessed by tissue malondialdehyde concentrations. The plasma concentrations of 
the FS lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, were stable after mice had eaten 
the diets for 2 wk. Following hyperoxia and acid aspiration, bronchoalveolar 
lavage neutrophils decreased in FS-supplemented mice (P = 0.012 and P = 0.027, 
respectively), whereas overall alveolar white blood cell influx tended to be 
lower (P = 0.11). In contrast, neither lung injury nor inflammation was 
ameliorated by FS following lipopolysaccharide instillation. Lung 
malondialdehyde levels were lower in hyperoxic mice than in unchallenged mice (P 
= 0.0001), and decreased with FS treatment following acid aspiration (P = 
0.011). Dietary FS decreased lung inflammation and lipid peroxidation, 
suggesting a protective role against pro-oxidant-induced tissue damage in vivo.

Proanthocyanidins are well known for their involvement in haze and colour 
development during beer ageing. New methodologies are needed, however, to 
understand what happens to them in the bottled beer. For the first time in the 
brewing field, thiolysis was hyphenated to RP-HPLC-ESI(-)-MS/MS to investigate 
these flavanoids. Thirty minutes at 40°C followed by 10h at room temperature 
emerged as the best conditions for complete depolymerisation. 
NP-HPLC-ESI(-)-MS/MS was used to quantify and isolate fractions from monomers to 
trimers in a Sephadex LH20 acetone/water (70/30, v/v) beer extract. 
Unsurprisingly, a lower dimer/monomer ratio was evidenced in PVPP-treated beers 
than in silica gel-filtered beers. Most beer dimers are procyanidins B3 (two 
catechin units) whilst most trimers are prodelphinidins (catechin in terminal 
units and gallocatechins or catechins in extension units). Gallocatechin 
appeared to come mainly from malt. Despite the absence of chromatographic peaks 
corresponding to oligomers above trimers, an apparent degree of polymerisation 
close to six was calculated in the total LH20 extract. Still higher mean degrees 
of polymerisation (mDPs) were calculated for malt and hop, indicating selective 
extraction or depolymerisation from raw materials to beer. The main part of beer 
polyphenols is composed of complex undefined structures not degraded by 
toluene-α-thiol.

Comparison of GC-MS and LC-MS methods for the analysis of antioxidant phenolic 
acids in herbs.

Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.

Two methods were developed for the quantitative analysis of phenolic acids in 
herb extracts. The methods were based on liquid chromatography-time-of-flight 
mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). 
The methods were compared in terms of their linearity, repeatability, 
selectivity, sensitivity and the speed of the analysis. The sensitivity was good 
for both methods, with limits of detection of <80 ng/ml for most of the 
compounds. The relative standard deviations (RSD) of the peak areas were on 
average 7.2% for the LC-TOFMS method and 1.4% for the GC-MS method. Both methods 
were found to be suitable for the determination of the target analytes, although 
GC-MS was better suited to the quantitative determination of compounds present 
at low concentrations.

Helsinki, P.O. Box 55, FIN-00014, Helsinki, Finland.

A fast and effective dynamic sonication assisted ethanol extraction method was 
developed for extracting phenolic acids from basil, oregano, rosemary, sage, 
spearmint and thyme of the Lamiaceae family. The results were compared with 
results obtained by conventional solvent extraction techniques. A comprehensive 
two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC x LC) system interfaced to 
electrospray ionisation time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry was then 
optimised for analysis and quantification of the herb extracts. The optimised LC 
x LC system employed a combination of C18 and cyano columns. The relative 
standard deviations for the retention times were better than 0.05% (rosmarinic 
acid 0.1%) and those for the peak areas 2-14% (2 mg/l, n=3). Limits of detection 
were 18-90 ng/ml. The LC x LC-MS method was applied to the quantitative analysis 
of phenolic acids, and the results were compared with those obtained with 
conventional LC-MS.

and Forestry, Zemedelská 1, CZ-613 00 Brno, Czech Republic.

A highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method with 
electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED) was developed for the determination of 
isoflavones. Electrochemical behaviour of daidzein and genistein was studied on 
carbon paste electrode (CPE) by adsorptive transfer stripping square wave 
voltammetry. The obtained electrochemical results were used for the development 
of HPLC-ED method. Furthermore, isoflavones were separated on an Atlantis dC18 
column using a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile (solvent A) and 0.15M 
acetate buffer of pH 5.5 (solvent B) at a flow rate 0.4 mL/min. A linear 
gradient profile (solvent B) was at 0-2 min 87%; 22 min 60%; 27 min 50%; 31 min 
45%; 47 min 87%. Full scan of multi-channel coulometric detection was tested and 
optimal potential at 450 mV was chosen for our purposes. Calibration curves were 
linear (daidzein R(2) = 0.9993 and genistein R(2) = 0.9987). The detection limit 
for daidzein/genistein was 480/394 pg/mL (1.8/1.5 nM) and per column 2.4/1.9 pg. 
Isoflavones extracted from soybean products (farina, meat, milk) by the 
accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) procedure and isoflavones present in human 
urine were determined by the HPLC-ED method.

Determination of isoflavones in soy and selected foods containing soy by 
extraction, saponification, and liquid chromatography: collaborative study.

Isoflavones are biologically active compounds occurring naturally in a variety 
of plants, with relatively high levels found in soybeans. Twelve laboratories 
participated in a collaborative study to determine the aglycon isoflavone 
content of 8 test samples of soy and foods containing soy. The analytical method 
for the determination of isoflavones incorporates a mild saponification step 
that reduces the number of analytes measured and permits quantitation versus 
commercially available, stable reference standards. Test samples were extracted 
at 65 degrees C with methanol-water (80 + 20), saponified with dilute sodium 
hydroxide solution, and analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography with UV 
detection at 260 nm. Isoflavone results were reported as microg/aglycon/g or 
microg aglycon equivalents/g. The 8 test samples included 2 blind duplicates and 
4 single test samples with total isoflavone concentrations ranging from 
approximately 50 to 3000 microg/g. Test samples of soy ingredients and products 
made with soy were distributed to collaborators with appropriate reference 
standards. Collaborators were asked to analyze test samples in duplicate on 2 
separate days. The data were analyzed for individual isoflavone components, 
subtotals of daidzin-daidzein, glycitin-glycitein, and genistin-genistein, and 
total isoflavones. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for repeatability was 
1.8-7.1%, and the RSD for reproducibility was 3.2-16.1% for total isoflavone 
values of 47-3099 microg/g.

Effects of industrial tomato paste processing on ascorbic acid, flavonoids and 
carotenoids and their stability over one-year storage.

Davis, CA 95616, USA.

BACKGROUND: The effects of industrial tomato paste processing and long-term (12 
months) ambient storage on the content and stability of quercetin, kaempferol, 
ascorbic acid (AA), dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA), β-carotene and lycopene were 
evaluated in a commercially produced tomato paste.
RESULTS: The initial thermal treatment (hot break; 93 °C for 5 min) resulted in 
significant reductions in quercetin (54%), kaempferol (61%), AA (63%) and 
β-carotene (30%), whereas subsequent processing steps (e.g. evaporation and 
sterilization) did not result in marked changes in these compounds. Lycopene was 
stable during hot break but decreased by 20% through evaporation and 
sterilization. The ratio of DHAA:vitamin C increased during hot break to 23%, 
whereas the ratio of DHAA:vitamin C remained relatively low in subsequent 
processing steps, indicating that AA was not oxidized. AA decreased with 
prolonged storage, with only 13% remaining at 12 months. The carotenoids and 
quercetin remained stable through 12 months of ambient storage.
CONCLUSIONS: Tomato pomace contained significant amounts of carotenoids and 
flavonoids, indicating that it may be an underutilized processing byproduct.

fate in the rat.

After intravenous administration of (-)-epicatechin gallate to Wistar male rats, 
its biliary metabolites were examined. Deconjugated forms of (-)-epicatechin 
gallate metabolites were prepared by beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase treatment and 
purified by HPLC. Five compounds were subjected to FAB-MS and NMR analyses. 
These metabolites were shown to be (-)-epicatechin gallate, 
3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, 4' 
'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, and 3',4' '-di-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin 
gallate. After oral administration, five major metabolites excreted in rat urine 
were purified in their deconjugated forms and their chemical structures 
identified. They were degradation products from (-)-epicatechin gallate, 
pyrogallol, 5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, 
4-hydroxy-5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)valeric acid, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic 
acid, and m-coumaric acid. Time course analysis of the identified 
(-)-epicatechin gallate metabolites showed that (-)-epicatechin gallate and its 
conjugate appeared in the plasma with their highest levels 0.5 h after oral 
administration; their levels rapidly decreased, and then they disappeared by 6 
h. The degradation products, mainly in their conjugated forms, emerged at 6 h, 
peaked at 24 h, and disappeared by 48 h. In urine samples, (-)-epicatechin 
gallate and its methylated metabolites were hardly detected and the degradation 
products began to be excreted in the 6-24 h period, peaked in the 24-48 h 
period, and then began to disappear. The most abundant metabolite in both the 
plasma and the urine was found to be the conjugated form of pyrogallol. On the 
basis of these results, a possible metabolic route of (-)-epicatechin gallate 
orally administered to the rat is proposed.

The chronic inflammatory skin disease atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by 
barrier defects, inflammation and microbial dysbiosis with a high prevalence of 
Staphylococcus (S.) aureus. Previously, we reported that a plant extract mixture 
consisting of curly kale, green tea and apple had beneficial effects on AD. 
Herein we further investigated the underlying promising effects exerted by the 
plant extract. The extract exhibited direct antimicrobial activity against S. 
aureus and reduced the number of extra- and intracellular S. aureus in 
keratinocytes. Gene expression analyses and luciferase reporter assays in 2D and 
3D AD-like skin models showed activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) 
by the plant extract. Knockdown experiments with siRNA revealed an AhR-dependent 
induction of the skin barrier molecule filaggrin by the plant extract in the AD 
skin model. Moreover, the plant extract demonstrated antioxidative properties by 
reduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species and induction of the 
antioxidative enzyme NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). In conclusion, the 
antioxidant and antibacterial effects of the plant extract in combination with 
the AhR activation may be promising for the topical treatment of AD. Further 
research has to uncover the full potential of plant extracts for the treatment 
of AD and other inflammatory diseases.

The effects of maturation (green, pink, and ripe) on phenolic composition of 
strawberry cultivars Camarosa, Dorit, Chandler, and Osmanli and their hybrids 
were investigated using a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. 
p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, ellagic acid, cyanidin-3-glucoside, 
pelargonidin-3-glucoside, kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin were individually 
quantified for each stage. The highest amounts of anthocyanins were obtained 
from ripe fruits whereas ellagic acid was found as the main phenolic in the 
green fruits. Phenolic concentrations were found statistically different in 
green and ripe fruits. One hybrid was found to have higher phenolic contents 
than the other genotypes. The p-hydroxybenzoic and p-coumaric acid levels 
changed during maturation, but no differences in contents of flavonoids in green 
and ripe fruit were detected.

A HPLC method coupled with coulometric electrode array detection for the 
determination of matairesinol in flax seed is described. The defatted sample was 
spiked with bisphenol A (internal standard), refluxed for 75 min in a mixture of 
ethanol-bidistilled water-12 M hydrochloric acid (2:2:1, v/v/v) to extract 
matairesinol conjugates and to hydrolyze them simultaneously. The extract was 
diluted with mobile phase [250 ml acetonitrile-750 ml buffer (730 ml bidistilled 
water, 20 ml glacial acetic acid adjusted to pH 3 with 5 M sodium hydroxide)] 
and injected into the HPLC system. Matairesinol was separated from other 
compounds on a reversed-phase column (Lichrospher 60 RP-Select B, 250 x 4 mm, 5 
micro m) and detected in a coulometric electrode array detector using a 
flow-rate of 0.8 ml/min. The potentials of the eight electrodes were set on 
+150, +200, +250, +300, +350, +400, +550 and +600 mV against modified palladium 
electrodes. The content of matairesinol determined in seven samples varies 
between 7 and 28.5 micro g/g. The limit of quantitation is 5 micro g/g.

Aspalathin, a flavonoid in Aspalathus linearis (rooibos), is absorbed by pig 
intestine as a C-glycoside.

Aspalathin, a dihydrochalcone and C-glycoside, is the most abundant flavonoid in 
rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which is well known as an herbal tea in many 
countries. Aspalathin appears to have in vitro antioxidative and antimutagenic 
effects. To understand the effects of aspalathin in the body, research on the 
absorption in the intestinal tract, metabolism in the body, and identification 
of circulating metabolites in vivo is required. We investigated the metabolism 
of aspalathin to identify the parent compound and related metabolites in urine 
and plasma after orally administering a rooibos extract (16.3% aspalathin by 96 
g rooibos extract, which equates to 1.1 kg dried rooibos material), produced 
from unfermented rooibos plant material, to pigs over a period of 11 days (oral 
dosage, 157-167 mg aspalathin per kg body weight daily). On days 7 and 11 of the 
study and days 1 and 2 after termination, urine was collected in 24-hour 
fractions, and plasma samples were collected at various time points. To our 
knowledge, this is the first time aspalathin metabolites have been identified in 
vivo, by presenting evidence of the absorption of aspalathin. Six substances 
identified in the urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were 
identified; these represent aspalathin and the metabolites methylated 
aspalathin, glucuronidated aspalathin glucuronidated and methylated aspalathin, 
a glucuronidated aglycone of aspalathin, as well as a metabolite of eriodictyol. 
The latter compound was methylated and contained 2 glucuronic acid moieties. 
This study showed that aspalathin can be absorbed by the intestine as 
C-glycoside as well as being cleaved in an aglycone and sugar moiety. The major 
metabolite in the enzymatically treated samples was methylated aspalathin. 
Between 0.1% and 0.9% of the administered dose of aspalathin could be detected 
in the urine on days 7 and 11 of the feeding study. No metabolites or aspalathin 
were found in plasma samples. The identification of the metabolites in vivo 
enables investigations to determine the biological potential of rooibos 
extracts.

BACKGROUND: Dietary intake of flavonoids, a class of plant (poly)phenols, is 
hypothesized to mediate a variety of beneficial health outcomes linked to fruits 
and vegetables (FV) intake. Absorbed flavonoids are metabolized and excreted in 
urine and may serve as biomarkers of FV intake and host metabolism, but defining 
the relationship of urinary biomarkers to the specific time of intake is 
unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize a targeted panel of 6 urinary flavonoids and 
determine the relationship to estimated dietary flavonoid intake over time in 
adults.
METHODS: Dietary flavonoid intake was estimated from both a 30-d food frequency 
questionnaire and 3-d diet records using the Phenol-Explorer database in 17 
adults. Twenty-four-hour urine was collected, and a targeted panel of 6 urinary 
flavonoids (quercetin, phloretin, naringenin, hesperetin, kaempferol, and 
isorhamnetin) was quantified using high-pressure liquid chromatography-diode 
array detection (DAD).
RESULTS: Compared to estimated intakes from a 1 d or 3 d diet record, total 
urinary flavonoids were most strongly associated with total FV (excluding 
potatoes) (rs = 0.53, P = 0.028) and total FV flavonoid (rs = 0.60, P = 0.011) 
intakes estimated by a 2 d diet record (including the day before and the day of 
the 24-h urine collection). There were no significant correlations between 
urinary concentrations of flavonoids and estimated FV intake using a 30-d food 
frequency questionnaire (rs = 0.36, P = 0.16).
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted flavonoid concentrations in a 24-h urine collection may 
serve as a biomarker for estimating dietary exposures over 2 d prior to 
completion of the urine collection, but not more distant dietary exposures.This

The bioavailability and urinary excretion of three dietary flavonoids, 
quercetin, hesperetin and naringenin, were investigated. Ten healthy men were 
asked to consume a 'juice mix' containing equal amounts of the three flavonoids, 
and their urine and plasma samples were collected. The resulting mean plasma 
area under the curve (AUC)(0-48 h) and C(max) values for quercetin and 
hesperetin were similar, whereas the AUC(0-48 h) of naringenin and, thus, the 
relative bioavailability were higher after consumption of the same dose. The 
study consolidates a significantly lower urinary excretion of quercetin 
(1.5+/-1%) compared with hesperetin (14.2+/-9.1%) and naringenin (22.6+/-11.5%) 
and shows that this is not due to a lower bioavailability of quercetin, but 
rather reflects different clearance mechanisms.

Phytoestrogens are a group of polyphenolic plant metabolites that can induce 
biological responses. Their bioactivity is based on their similarity to 
17beta-estradiol and their ability to bind to the beta-estrogen receptor. 
Although epidemiological data are inconclusive, phytoestrogens are considered to 
be beneficial for a variety of conditions, for example, hormone-related cancers 
like breast and prostate cancer. To investigate the biological effects of these 
compounds and to assess the exposure of larger cohorts or the general public, 
reliable data on the phytoestrogen content of food is necessary. Previously, 
food analysis for phytoestrogens was performed using either HPLC-UV or GC/MS. 
Here, we describe the development of the first generic method for the analysis 
of phytoestrogens in food, using automated solid-phase extraction and liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The presented method shows a good 
reproducibility and can be easily adapted to other phytoestrogens if required.

Phytoestrogens are secondary plant metabolites that have received increasing 
attention for their bioactivity, in particular due to their structural and 
functional similarity to 17beta-estradiol. Although urinary and plasma 
phytoestrogens can be used as biomarkers for dietary intake, this is often not 
possible in large epidemiological studies or in the assessment of general 
exposure in free-living individuals. Accurate information about dietary 
phytoestrogens is therefore important, but there are very limited data 
concerning food contents. In this study was analyzed a comprehensive selection 
of tea, coffee, alcoholic beverages, nuts, seeds, and oils for their 
phytoestrogen content using a newly developed sensitive method based on LC-MS 
incorporating (13)C 3-labeled standards. Phytoestrogens were detected in all 
foods analyzed, although the contents in gin and bitter (beer) were below the 
limit of quantification (1.5 microg/100 g). Lignans were the main type of 
phytoestrogens detected. Tea and coffee contained up to 20 microg/100 g 
phytoestrogens and beer (except bitter) contained up to 71 microg/100 g, mainly 
lignans. As these beverages are commonly consumed, they are a main source of 
dietary lignans. The results published here will contribute to databases of 
dietary phytoestrogen content and allow a more accurate determination of 
phytoestrogen exposure in free-living individuals.

Dietary phytoestrogens may be involved in the occurrence of chronic diseases. 
Reliable information on the phytoestrogen content in foods is required to assess 
dietary exposure and disease risk in epidemiological studies. However, there is 
little information on isoflavone, lignan, and coumestrol content of cereals and 
cereal-based foods, leading to an underestimation of intake. This is the first 
study of phytoestrogens (isoflavones: biochanin A, daidzein, formononetin, 
genistein, glycitein; lignans: matairesinol, secoisplariciresinol; coumestrol) 
in a comprehensive selection of 101 cereals and cereal-based foods-including 
breads, breakfast cereals, biscuits, pasta and rice-consumed in the UK using a 
sensitive LCMS technique with 13C-labelled internal standards. Phytoestrogens 
were detected in all foods analyzed; bread contained the highest amount of 
phytoestrogens-many as isoflavones-with an average content of 375 +/- 67 
microg/100 g wet weight (excluding soya-linseed bread with 12,000 microg/100 g). 
Most other foods contained less than 100 microg/100 g, many as lignans. Our 
study shows that all foods analyzed contained phytoestrogens, with the highest 
amount found in breads, making them one of the main sources of dietary 
phytoestrogens in the UK. These results will allow a more accurate estimation of 
exposure to dietary phytoestrogens.

The distribution of total phenolics and main betacyanins in red beetroot (Beta 
vulgaris) root was determined. Also, the subsequent effects of cold storage on 
the content of total phenolics, main betacyanins (betanin and isobetanin), and 
the main known ferulic acid ester 
(beta-D-fructofuranosyl-alpha-D-(6-O-(E)-feruloylglucopyranoside) were 
determined in the peel, which is the root part containing the largest amount of 
total phenolics. The content of total phenolics in the red beetroot water 
extracts was determined according to a modification of the Folin-Ciocalteu 
method and expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE). The compounds of interest 
were identified by HPLC-ESI-MS and NMR techniques, and the contents of compounds 
were determined by HLPC analyses. The total phenolic contents in various root 
parts were found to decrease in the order peel, crown, flesh. Significant 
differences in the contents of total phenolics and individual compounds were 
found when the effect of cold storage (5 degrees C, 0-196 days) on the 
constituents of the peel from intact roots was examined. In addition to the 
betacyanins of red beetroot peel found in our earlier study, tentative 
identifications of betanidin and feruloylamaranthin were made.

vitro and in vivo.

The soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein are found in high concentrations in 
human plasma and urine after soy consumption. However, in vitro and in vivo data 
regarding the oxidative metabolism of isoflavones in humans are scarce. 
Therefore, we have studied the oxidative metabolites of these compounds formed 
in human liver microsomes and excreted in urine of male and female humans 
ingesting soy products for 2 days. Human liver microsomes transformed the soy 
isoflavone daidzein to three monohydroxylated and three dihydroxylated 
metabolites according to GC/MS analysis. On the basis of a previous study with 
rat liver microsomes and with the help of reference substances, these 
metabolites were identified as 6,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 
7,3',4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 7,8,4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 
7,8,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, 6,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, and 
6,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone. Significant amounts of the same metabolites 
except 6,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone were also found in urine of female and 
male volunteers after soy intake. Genistein was metabolized by human liver 
microsomes to six hydroxylation products. The main metabolites were the three 
aromatic monohydroxylated products 5,6,7,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, 
5,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone and 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone. The 
aliphatic monohydroxylated metabolite 2,5,7,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone and two 
aromatic dihydroxylated metabolites, 5,7,8,3',4'-pentahydroxyisoflavone and 
5,6,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyisoflavone, were formed in trace amounts. The same 
hydroxylated genistein metabolites except the aliphatic hydroxylated one could 
also be detected in human urine samples. Methylated forms of the catechol 
metabolites, which were generated by incubations with 
catechol-O-methyltransferase in vitro could be detected only in trace amounts in 
the urine samples. This implies that this reaction does not play a major role in 
the biotransformation of the hydroxylated daidzein and genistein metabolites in 
vivo. Most of these oxidative metabolites are described as human in vivo 
metabolites for the first time. Their biological significance remains to be 
established.

Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of two tree spinach species 
(Cnidoscolus chayamansa McVaugh and C. aconitifolius Miller.) were determined in 
raw and cooked leaf extracts. Antioxidant capacity was assessed by the oxygen 
radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, and flavonoid glycoside composition 
was quantified by HPLC and identified by GC. Total phenolics and antioxidant 
capacity were higher in raw than in cooked leaf extracts. The ORAC values were 
strongly correlated with total phenolic content (r = 0.926) in all leaf 
extracts. The major flavonoids isolated from the leaf extracts were 
kaempferol-3-O-glycosides and quercetin-3-O-glycosides. C. aconitifolius leaves 
contained more varieties of the flavonoid glycosides than C. chayamansa. Cooking 
reduced antioxidant activity and phenolic content and resulted in losses of some 
kaempferol glycoside and quercetin glycoside residues in leaf extracts. The 
results of this study indicate that tree spinach leaves are a rich source of 
natural antioxidants for foods.

Lignans and isoflavonoid phytoestrogens, produced from plant precursors by 
colonic bacteria, may protect against certain cancers. We examined the effects 
of flaxseed consumption on urinary lignans and isoflavonoids. Eighteen women 
consumed their usual omnivorous diets for three menstrual cycles and their usual 
diets supplemented with flaxseed powder (10 g/d) for three cycles in a 
randomized crossover design. Three-day urine samples from follicular and luteal 
phases were analyzed for lignans and isoflavonoids by isotope-dilution gas 
chromatography--mass spectrometry. Excretion of the lignans enterodiol and 
enterolactone increased with flaxseed from 1.09 +/- 1.08 and 3.16 +/- 1.47 to 
19.48 +/- 1.10 and 27.79 +/- 1.50 mumol/d, respectively (P < 0.0002). Enterodiol 
and enterolactone excretion varied among subjects in response to flaxseed (3- to 
285-fold increase). There were no differences in excretion of isoflavonoids 
(daidzein, genistein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin) or the lignan 
matairesinol with flaxseed. Excretion was not altered by phase of menstrual 
cycle or duration of flaxseed consumption.

Box 7051, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden. rikard.landberg@lmv.slu.se

The total alkylresorcinol (AR) content and relative homologue composition of 21 
durum wheat (Triticum durum) kernel samples, as well as 5 pasta products and the 
corresponding flour mixtures, were determined. Durum wheat contained on average 
455 microg/g ARs, and the average relative homologue composition was C17:0 
(0.4%), C19:0 (14%), C21:0 (58%), C23:0 (21%), and C25:0 (6.5%). The homologue 
composition was found to be relatively consistent among samples, with durum 
wheat being different from common wheat by having a higher proportion of the 
longer homologues. No differences in content or homologue composition were 
observed in pasta products compared to flour ingredients, showing that 
alkylresorcinols are stable during pasta processing. The ratio of the homologues 
C17:0 to C21:0 was < or =0.02 for whole grain durum wheat products, which is 
different from those of common wheat (0.1) and rye (0.9).

Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and 
development of atherosclerosis. Levels of phenolics, major catechins 
[(+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, procyanidin dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4], phenolic 
acids (gallic acid and caffeic acid), caftaric acid, malvidin-3-glucoside, 
peonidin-3-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-glucoside were quantified by HPLC with UV 
detection for 54 French varietal commercial wines taken from southern France to 
study the antioxidant capacity and the daily dietary intake of these compounds 
for the French population. The highest antioxidant capacity was obtained with 
red wines and ranged from 12.8 mmol/L (Grenache) to 25.2 mmol/L (Pinot Noir). 
For white wines, Chardonnay enriched in phenolics by special wine-making was 
found to have an antioxidant capacity of 13.8 mmol/L, comparable to red wine 
values. For red wines classified by vintages (1996-1999) antioxidant capacities 
were approximately 20 mmol/L and then decreased to 13.4 mmol/L for vintages 
1995-1991. Sweet white wines have 1.7 times more antioxidant capacity (3.2 
mmol/L) than dry white wines (1.91 mmol/L). On the basis of a still significant 
French wine consumption of 180 mL/day/person, the current daily intake of 
catechins (monomers and dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4) averaged 5 (dry white wine), 
4.36 (sweet white wines), 7.70 (rosé wines), 31.98 (red wines), and 66.94 (dry 
white wine enriched in phenolic) mg/day/resident for the French population. Red 
wine, and particularly Pinot Noir, Egiodola, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, and 
Merlot varieties, or Chardonnay enriched in phenolics during wine-making for 
white varieties contribute to a very significant catechin dietary intake.

Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and 
development of atherosclerosis. Stilbenes have been shown to have cancer 
chemopreventive activity and to protect lipoproteins from oxidative damage. A 
method for the direct determination of stilbene oligomers (viniferin and 
pallidol) as well as astilbin in different types of wine using high-performance 
liquid chromatography with UV detection is described. In a survey of 21 
commercial wines from the south of France, levels of pallidol and viniferin are 
reported for the first time in different types of wines. Viniferin was found to 
be present only in red and botrytized sweet white wines with levels between 0.1 
and 1.63 mg/L; pallidol was not found in dry and sweet white wines but only in 
wines made by maceration with stems, with levels between 0.38 and 2.22 mg/L. 
Highest levels of astilbin were found in Egiodola (15.13 mg/L), Merlot (11.61 
mg/L), and Cabernet Sauvignon (8.24 mg/L) for red wines and in Sauvignon (5.04 
mg/L) for white varietal wines. Astilbin levels are highest for recent vintages, 
but pallidol is not found in older vintages. During noble rot development in 
Sauvignon or Sémillon grapes from the Sauternes area, levels of trans-astringin, 
trans-resveratrol, trans-piceid, and pallidol are quite low (<0.5 mg/kg of 
grapes). Viniferin and astilbin levels become optimum at 2 and 30 mg/kg, 
respectively, during spot grape and speckle grape stages.

Development of a stable isotope dilution analysis with liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry detection for the quantitative analysis 
of di- and trihydroxybenzenes in foods and model systems.

A straightforward stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) for the quantitative 
determination of the di- and trihydroxybenzenes catechol (1), pyrogallol (2), 
3-methylcatechol (3), 4-methylcatechol (4), and 4-ethylcatechol (5) in foods by 
means of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed. With or 
without sample preparation involving phenylboronyl solid phase extraction, the 
method allowed the quantification of the target compounds in complex matrices 
such as coffee beverages with quantification limits of 9 nmol/L for 
4-ethylcatechol, 24 nmol/L for catechol, 3-methyl-, and 4-methylcatechol, and 31 
nmol/L for pyrogallol. Recovery rates for the analytes ranged from 97 to 103%. 
Application of the developed SIDA to various commercial food samples showed that 
quantitative analysis of the target compounds is possible within 30 min and gave 
first quantitative data on the amounts of di- and trihydroxybenzenes in coffee 
beverage, coffee powder, coffee surrogate, beer, malt, roasted cocoa powder, 
bread crust, potato crisps, fruits, and cigarette smoke and human urine. Model 
precursor studies revealed the carbohydrate/amino acid systems as well as the 
plant polyphenols catechin and epicatechin as precursors of catechol and 
5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, caffeic acid as a precursor of catechol and 
4-ethylcatechol, and gallocatechin, epigallocatechin, and gallic acid as 
precursors of pyrogallol.

The phenolic fraction of maize bran: evidence for lignin-heteroxylan 
association.

Maize bran heteroxylan samples were extracted in various conditions of severity. 
Their ferulate and diferulate content was investigated by GC-MS of methyl 
ester-TMSi derivatives. When extracted by 0.5 M NaOH in mild conditions, the 
heteroxylan sample contained a low level of ferulic acid (0.032% by wt.) and the 
main diferulate surviving alkaline extraction was found to be the 8-8' 
diferulate. On peroxidase treatment, this sample nevertheless produced a firm 
and brittle gel without any change in the diferulate profile. Typical lignin 
structures, mainly comprising syringyl units interconnected through beta-O-4, 
beta-1 and beta-beta interunit bonds, were evidenced in the maize bran sample. 
More importantly, these lignin structures were found to be tightly associated 
with the alkali-extracted heteroxylans. Thioacidolysis revealed the occurrence 
of 0.1-0.5% (by wt.) lignin structures in heteroxylan fractions extracted in 
mild or severe conditions, before and after purification of the polysaccharides. 
The gelling potential of the heteroxylan fractions was not only dependent on 
their ferulate level, but also influenced by associated lignin structures. These 
results argue for the occurrence of covalent linkages between heteroxylan chains 
and lignin structures which could participate in the peroxidase-driven gelation 
of feruloylated polysaccharides. They demonstrate the role of low lignin levels 
in the organization of native or reconstructed polysaccharide networks.

Spectrophotometric determination of tannins in tea and beer samples with 
iron(III) and 1,10-phenanthroline as reagents.

Lau OW, Luk SF, Huang HL.

A simple and accurate spectrophotometric method is proposed for the 
determination of tannins in tea and beer samples based on the reduction of 
iron(III) to iron(II) by tannins at 80 degrees C for 20 min. The iron(II) was 
then reacted with 1,10-phenanthroline at pH 4.4 to form a coloured complex. 
Background correction could be effected by precipitating the tannins in the 
sample solution twice with gelatin and kaolin. Absorbance measurements were made 
at 540 nm and the calibration graph was linear from 0 to 5.5 micrograms ml-1 of 
tannic acid with a slope of 0.213 A p.p.m.-1. The precision for the 
determination of tannins in a tea sample containing 9.45% of tannins was 1.8%. 
Most of the ingredients commonly found in tea and beer samples do not interfere 
with the determination. Several tea and beer samples were analysed for their 
tannin content using the proposed method.

The effect of olive stone removal before processing on the degradation level, 
secoiridoid and tocopherol contents, and antioxidant activity of monovarietal 
extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) was studied. EVOOs were extracted from olives of 
the Leccino, Moraiolo, Frantoio, Pendolino, Taggiasca, and Colombaia varieties 
both in the presence and in the absence of the stones. The degradation level of 
EVOOs was evaluated by acidity, peroxide number, and spectroscopic indices 
K(232) and K(270), according to EU regulation. The secoiridoid compounds typical 
of EVOO, namely, the oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives, hydroxytyrosol, 
tyrosol, and tocopherols were analyzed by HPLC. The antioxidant activity was 
evaluated by the xanthine oxidase/xanthine system, generating superoxide radical 
and hydrogen peroxide, and by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl 
test. Results showed that EVOOs obtained from both stoned and destoned olives 
had a very low degradation level, which was not affected by destoning. Destoning 
lowered slightly the alpha-tocopherol content in EVOOs but increased the total 
secoiridoid content and the antioxidant activity of EVOOs (up to 3.5-fold). 
However, these effects were variety-dependent and negligible in some conditions. 
It was concluded that a better knowledge of the reactions occurring during olive 
processing, and particularly on the involvement of endogenous pulp and stone 
enzymes, is essential to predict the effect of destoning on EVOO quality.

The degradation of secoiridoid, tocopherol, and antioxidant activity in extra 
virgin olive oils (EVOOs) was studied during 8 months of storage in closed 
bottles in the dark, at 40 and 25 degrees C. Picual, Arbequina, Taggiasca, and 
Colombaia monovarietal EVOOs possessing quite different fatty acid and 
antioxidant contents were used. The secoiridoid aglycones, namely, the 
oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives, and alpha-tocopherol decreased following 
pseudo-first-order kinetics. In all EVOOs oleuropein derivatives were less 
stable than the corresponding ligstroside derivatives and alpha-tocopherol. 
Accordingly, overall antioxidant activity decreased following pseudo-first-order 
kinetics, with rate constants ranging from 0.85 x 10(-)(3) to 4.1 x 10(-)(3) 
days(-)(1) at 40 degrees C and from 0.8 x 10(-)(3) to 1.5 x 10(-)(3) days(-)(1) 
at 25 degrees C. According to both the antioxidant activity and the hydrolysis 
and oxidation indices established by EU regulation to assess EVOO quality, 
Colombaia oil was the least stable, followed by Taggiasca, Arbequina, and Picual 
oils. Despite antioxidant degradation, EVOOs with high antioxidant contents were 
still ""excellent"" after 240 days of storage at 40 degrees C. These data led to 
the conclusion that the beneficial properties of EVOOs due to antioxidant 
activity can be maintained throughout their commercial lives.

Peaches are tasty and juicy, with a unique flavor. The flavors of peaches always 
vary with cultivars. To investigate the physicochemical and aroma 
characteristics of peaches, the sugars, organic acids, total flavonoids, 
phenols, antioxidant activities, and aroma compounds of seven peach cultivars in 
Xinjiang were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and 
headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS). The results showed that sucrose (59.83 to 87.34%), 
malic acid (32.41 to 59.14%), and chlorogenic acid (10.43 to 45.50%) were the 
dominant sugar, organic acid, and phenolic compound in peaches, respectively. 
The antioxidant activity varied between 147.81 and 394.55 μmol TEs/100 g. The 
analysis of the aroma structure of peaches found that the volatile composition 
of peaches was relatively consistent, though the concentration of total aroma 
and certain separate compounds were different between cultivars. Meanwhile, the 
aroma fingerprint of the peaches consisted of hexyl acetate, cis-3-hexenyl 
acetate, γ-decalactone, n-hexanal, 2-hexenal, nonanal, decanal benzaldehyde and 
6-pentylpyran-2-one, providing a clear green, sweet, floral, and fruity odor. 
These results provide complete information on the physicochemical properties, 
functional ingredients and aroma of the peaches.

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with photodiode array detection 
was applied for the characterization of anthocyanins in red-fleshed Budd Blood 
(Citrus sinensis) orange. More than seven anthocyanin pigments were separated 
within 30 min by using a binary gradient (0.1% H(3)P0(4) in water and 0.1% 
H(3)PO(4) in acetonitrile) elution on a Prodigy ODS column. Separations by 
reversed-phase HPLC and semipreparative HPLC on a Prodigy 10-microm ODS Prep 
column, and acid and alkali hydrolyses were used for identification of 
anthocyanins. The primary anthocyanins in Budd Blood orange grown in Florida 
were cyanidin-3-(6""-malonylglucoside) (44.8%) followed by cyanidin-3-glucoside 
(33.6%). Two other minor pigments were also acylated with malonic acid. 
Malonated anthocyanins represented the major proportion (>51%) of anthocyanins 
in Budd Blood orange. Total anthocyanin contents and juice color parameters (CIE 
L,a,b) were compared with six other Florida-grown blood oranges.

capacity.

The contribution of each phytochemical to the total antioxidant capacity of 
apples was determined. Major phenolic phytochemicals of six apple cultivars were 
identified and quantified, and their contributions to total antioxidant activity 
of apples were determined using a 
2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging assay 
and expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC). Average 
concentrations of major phenolics and vitamin C in six apple cultivars were as 
follows (mg/100 g of fresh weight of apples): quercetin glycosides, 13.20; 
procyanidin B(2), 9.35; chlorogenic acid, 9.02; epicatechin, 8.65; phloretin 
glycosides, 5.59; vitamin C, 12.80. A highly linear relationship (r (2) > 0.97) 
was attained between concentrations and total antioxidant capacity of phenolics 
and vitamin C. Relative VCEAC values of these compounds were in the order 
quercetin (3.06) > epicatechin (2.67) > procyanidin B(2) (2.36) > phloretin 
(1.63) > vitamin C (1.00) > chlorogenic acid (0.97). Therefore, the estimated 
contribution of major phenolics and vitamin C to the total antioxidant capacity 
of 100 g of fresh apples is as follows: quercetin (40.39 VCEAC) > epicatechin 
(23.10) > procyanidin B(2) (22.07) > vitamin C (12.80) > phloretin (9.11) > 
chlorogenic acid (8.75). These results indicate that flavonoids such as 
quercetin, epicatechin, and procyanidin B(2) rather than vitamin C contribute 
significantly to the total antioxidant activity of apples.

In vitro trials have indicated various potential health effects of lingonberries 
( Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.). Most of these studies have been performed with 
berry extract or juice, and the detailed chemical structures of active compounds 
in these products have not been elucidated. Lingonberry contains 
cyanidin-3-galactoside as its main anthocyanin. Absorption and metabolism of the 
compound is not fully understood, and no studies of anthocyanin metabolism have 
been performed with lingonberries. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
urinary excretion of cyanidin-3-galactoside and its metabolites in young and 
healthy subjects receiving a breakfast containing 300 g of lingonberries. A 
fast, selective, and sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (uHPLC-MS/MS) method was optimized for 
the analysis of the anthocyanin metabolites in urine. Both intact 
cyanidin-3-galactoside and its methylated and glucuronidated metabolites were 
identified from urine samples. The two metabolites represented >50% of cyanidin 
excreted in urine. Maximal excretion appeared between 4 and 8 h after the meal. 
Also, the compounds were absorbed more slowly than reported previously in 
several studies.

The aim of this study was to compare some bioactive compounds in apples, peaches 
and pears and their influence on lipids and antioxidant capacity in rats. The 
content of total polyphenols (g/100g) was 0.23 +/- 0.03; 0.22 +/- 0.03 and 0.68 
+/- 0.1 in peeled fruits and 0.48 +/- 0.04, 0.47 +/- 0.04 and 1.2 +/- 0.12 in 
peels of peaches, pears and apples, respectively. Caffeic, p-coumaric and 
ferulic acids and the total radical-trapping antioxidative potential (TRAP) 
values in peeled apples and their peels were significantly higher than in 
peaches and pears, respectively. Contrarary, no significant differences in the 
content of dietary fiber among the studied fruits were found. The content of all 
studied indices in peels was significantly higher than peeled fruits (p < 0.05 
). A good correlation between the total polyphenols and the TRAP values was 
found in all fruits. Diets supplemented with apples and to a less extent with 
peaches and pears have improved lipid metabolism and increased the plasma 
antioxidant potential especially in rats fed with added cholesterol. The highest 
content of biologically active compounds and the best results in the experiment 
on rats makes apple preferable for dietary prevention of atherosclerosis and 
other diseases.

Flavanone glycosides (FGs) and polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) have been 
studied in pigmented orange (Citrus sinensis) juices and second-pressure 
extracts (SPEs) by high-performance liquid chromatography and diode array 
detector. Detection was performed simultaneously at two different wavelengths: 
278 nm (for determination of FGs) and 325 nm (for determination of PMFs). 
Qualitative distribution patterns of FGs and PMFs in juices and SPEs were 
similar, although the quantitative results are quite different. An increased 
narirutin/hesperidin ratio after centrifugation and the presence of high amounts 
of PMFs in SPEs, which remain unchanged after centrifugation, were observed. 
Therefore, a simple and affordable procedure to distinguish an orange juice from 
SPEs was proposed.

Tea has been proposed to have beneficial health effects which have been 
attributed to the polyphenolic compounds known as catechins. The bioavailability 
and biotransformation of these compounds, however, are not clearly understood. 
In this study, we used liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass 
spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS) to determine urinary glucuronidated and sulfated tea 
catechins and their metabolites (including methylated and ring-fission 
metabolites) based on the detection of deprotonated molecular ions and aglycone 
fragment ions. The compound resolution was achieved both chromatographically and 
mass spectroscopically. After green tea administration, the major conjugates 
appeared in human, mouse, and rat urine samples were identified as 
monoglucuronides and monosulfates of (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and 
(-)-epicatechin. We also found O-methyl-EGC-O-glucuronides and -O-sulfates and 
O-methyl-epicatechin-O-sulfates in human urine. 
(-)-5-(3',4',5'-Trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4) and 
(-)-5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6), the ring-fission 
metabolites of EGC and (-)-epicatechin, respectively, were also predominantly in 
monoglucuronide and monosulfate forms in the urine. In comparison to rats, the 
urinary metabolite profiles of tea catechins in mice resemble more closely to 
those in humans. This is the first report describing direct simultaneous 
analysis of multiple tea catechin conjugates in urine samples. This method will 
allow more thorough investigations of the biotransformation of tea polyphenols.

To identify and quantify biologically active components in rat serum after 
orally administrating the decoction of Bulpleurum falcatum L. and Fractus 
aurantii, one of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and 
validated. The HPLC separation was carried out on a Waters Nova Pak C(18) column 
using acetonitrile and water as mobile phase after the sample of rat serum was 
cleaned up with solid-phase extraction. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization 
in the negative ion mode and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) method was 
developed to determine the active components. Three flavonoids of hesperidin, 
neohesperidin and naringin were identified in the serum by comparing their 
retention times and three independent SRM precursor/product ion transitions with 
those of corresponding reference standards. The concentrations of naringin, 
hesperidin and neohesperidin in rat serum determined by SRM measurement were 
16.3, 11.9 and 14.3 ng/ml, respectively, after orally administrating the 
decoction of B. falcatum L. and F. aurantii. This method was validated in terms 
of recovery, linearity, accuracy and precision (intra- and interday variation). 
The recoveries from spiked control samples were 93.0, 89.3 and 91.2% for 
hesperidin, neohesperidin and naringin, respectively. Linearity in rat serum was 
observed over the range of 2.0-50.0 ng/ml. Percent bias (accuracy) and precision 
were well within the acceptable range and the relative standard deviation 
(R.S.D.) of the measured rat serum samples was less than 10% (n=5).

Author information:

Nobiletin, a major component of citrus polymethoxyflavones, has many potential 
significant health benefits. While the biological activities of nobiletin have 
been widely reported, its in vitro and in vivo metabolic fate has been rarely 
studied. To explore the biotransformation mechanism of nobiletin we conducted an 
investigation into its metabolic profile in mouse urine, by various analytical 
techniques. Due to sample amount limitations for isolating and characterizing an 
individual metabolite, two possible nobiletin metabolites were prepared in a 
similar multi-step organic synthetic route: 
3'-hydroxy-5,6,7,8,4'-pentamethoxyflavone (3'-demethylnobiletin) and 
4'-hydroxy-5,6,7,8,3'-pentamethoxyflavone (4'-demethylnobiletin). Normal phase 
(silica gel) and C(18) reverse phase chromatography, as well as liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry, were employed in the 
separation of 3'-demethylnobiletin and 4'-demethylnobiletin, however, without 
success due to the structural similarities of these mono-demethylated 
nobiletins. Using a chiral packed column eluted under supercritical fluid 
chromatography (SFC) conditions, a clear separation was achieved. Thus, by 
comparing the SFC profiles of metabolite mixtures with the synthesized standard 
compounds, the major nobiletin metabolite of mouse urine is identified as 
4'-demethylnobiletin, whereas 3'-demethylnobiletin is a minor metabolite. In 
this study, the concentration of 4'-demethylnobiletin in mouse urine is 28.9 
microg/mL.

The polyphenolic compositions of three heartnut (Juglans ailanthifolia var. 
cordiformis) varieties (Imshu, Campbell CW1, and Campbell CW3) were examined and 
compared with those of two Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.) varieties (Combe 
and Lake). The nuts were defatted, extracted, and separated into three different 
fractions, the free phenolic acid (FPA), acid-hydrolyzable phenolic acid (AHPA), 
and bound phenolic acid (BPA) fractions. The total phenolic contents (TPCs) in 
both FPA and AHPA of the Persian walnuts were significantly higher (P < 0.001) 
than those of the heartnuts, but not in the BPA (P = 0.20). LC-ESI-MS(n)() 
studies revealed that except for the FPA fraction, the major polyphenolics in 
both heartnut and Persian walnut were ellagic acid and valoneic acid dilactone. 
Persian walnuts contained an average of 0.29 and 1.31 mg of ellagic acid/g nut 
in the 80% methanol extractable fractions FPA and AHPA, respectively. Heartnuts 
contained an average of 0.16 and 0.60 mg of ellagic acid/g nut in the respective 
fractions. Bound ellagic acid in the residue was 0.93 and 0.70 mg/g of nut in 
the Persian walnut and in the heartnut, respectively. Valoneic acid dilactone 
was tentatively identified and quantified as milligrams of ellagic acid 
equivalent per gram of nut. These components were found to contribute to the 
strong total antioxidant activities measured using ferric reducing antioxidant 
power and photochemiluminescence methods.

their hydrolysates in the flaxseed extract by high-performance liquid 
chromatography.

Flaxseed contains the largest amount of lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside 
(SDG) oligomers and is the richest dietary source of SDG. SDG oligomers in the 
flaxseed extract are often hydrolyzed to break the ester linkages for the 
release of SDG and the glycosidic bonds for the release of secoisolariciresinol 
(SECO). The hydrolysates of SDG oligomers are complicated because of the 
production of esters in an alcohol-containing medium. In this study, a new 
gradient reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has 
been developed to be suitable for the separation and determination of: (1) SDG 
oligomers extracted from the defatted flaxseed powder by a 70% aqueous methanol 
solution; (2) SDG oligomers and their alkaline hydrolysates, including SDG, 
p-coumaric acid glucoside and its methyl ester, ferulic acid glucoside and its 
methyl ester in an alkaline hydrolytic solution; and (3) the succedent acid 
hydrolysates, including secoisolariciresinol monoglucoside (SMG), SECO, 
anhydrosecoisolariciresinol (anhydro-SECO), p-coumaric acid and its methyl 
ester, ferulic acid and its methyl ester, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (HMF) and 
its degradation product in an acid hydrolytic solution. The content of SDG 
oligomers in a defatted flaxseed powder was found to be 38.5 mg/g on a dry 
matter basis, corresponding to a SDG content of 15.4 mg/g, which was determined 
after alkaline hydrolysis. Furthermore, this study presented a major reaction 
pathway for the hydrolysis of SDG oligomers.

A new analytical approach based on gas chromatography coupled to atmospheric 
pressure chemical ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry was evaluated for 
its applicability for the analysis of phenolic compounds from extra-virgin olive 
oil. Both chromatographic and MS parameters were optimized in order to improve 
the sensitivity and to maximize the number of phenolic compounds detected. We 
performed a complete analytical validation of the method with respect to its 
linearity, sensitivity, precision, accuracy and possible matrix effects. The 
LODs ranged from 0.13 to 1.05ppm for the different tested compounds depending on 
their properties. The RSDs for repeatability test did not exceed 6.07% and the 
accuracy ranged from 95.4% to 101.5%. To demonstrate the feasibility of our 
method for analysis of real samples, we analyzed the extracts of three different 
commercial extra-virgin olive oils. We have identified unequivocally a number of 
phenolic compounds and obtained quantitative information for 21 of them. In 
general, our results show that GC-APCI-TOF MS is a flexible platform which can 
be considered as an interesting tool for screening, structural assignment and 
quantitative determination of phenolic compounds from virgin olive oil.

Kingdom.

Dietary phytoestrogens such as the isoflavones daidzein and genistein are 
thought to protect against chronic diseases that are common in Western 
societies, such as cancer, osteoporosis, and ischemic heart disease. In 
addition, there are concerns regarding the deleterious effects of hormone-like 
compounds, especially with respect to the development of infants. However, there 
is little information regarding the phytoestrogen content of foods, and 
therefore epidemiologic investigations of phytoestrogens are limited. As part of 
a study quantifying the consumption of phytoestrogens, the objective of this 
work was to assess the daidzein and genistein content of fruits and nuts 
commonly eaten in Europe. Eighty different fruits and nuts were sampled, 
prepared for eating, and freeze-dried. Daidzein and genistein were extracted 
from the dried foods, and the two isoflavones were quantified after hydrolytic 
removal of any conjugated carbohydrate. Completeness of extraction and any 
procedural losses of the isoflavones were accounted for using synthetic daidzin 
(7-O-glucosyl-4'-hydroxyisoflavone) and genistin 
(7-O-glucosyl-4'5-dihydroxyisoflavone) as internal standards. Of the 80 foods 
assayed, 43 contained no detectable daidzein or genistein, at a limit of 
quantification of 1 microg/kg dry weight of food. Nine foods contained more than 
100 microg of the two isoflavones combined per kilogram wet weight, and 28 
contained less than this amount. Currants and raisins were the richest sources 
of the isoflavones, containing 2,250 microg and 1,840 microg of the two 
isoflavones combined per kilogram of wet weight of food. Although fruits and 
nuts are not as rich in isoflavone phytoestrogens as are soy and other legumes, 
this is the first documentation of levels of daidzein and genistein occurring in 
these foods.

Dietary phytoestrogens have a number of biological effects, including endocrine 
disruption, antioxidant potential, and protein tyrosine kinase inhibition. 
Secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin are lignan phytoestrogens found 
in foodstuffs, especially flaxseed. Normally they are glycosidically linked to 
carbohydrates and in the large intestine are deconjugated from the carbohydrate 
portion by bacteria. The aglycone lignans can be further modified to form the 
mammalian phytoestrogens enterodiol, enterolactone, and enterofuran, which are 
absorbed into the body and excreted in urine. To assess the health implications 
of phytoestrogens in general populations, knowledge of the quantity in the foods 
eaten is necessary. This article describes a simple preparative procedure for 
the assay of secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin in foodstuffs 
after hydrolytic removal of any conjugated carbohydrate. The difficulties in the 
practical application of the assay procedure are illustrated and discussed. 
Analytical results indicating the concentration of secoisolariciresinol, 
matairesinol, and shonanin in a number of foodstuffs are presented. Also, the 
mass spectral data of a putative mammalian phytoestrogen, called enterofuran, 
identified in urine are presented.

LC-DAD-ESI/MS was used to identify 23 flavonoids in the extract of Mexican 
oregano (Lippia graveolens H.B.K.), a spice and herb, used in the USA and 
Mexico. The identification of luteolin-7-O-glucoside, apigenin 7-O-glucoside, 
phloridzin, taxifolin, eriodictyol, scutellarein, luteolin, quercetin, 
naringenin, pinocembrin and galangin was confirmed by direct comparison with 
standards. Identification of 6-hydroxyluteolin, two 6-hydroxyluteolin 
7-O-glycosides, three pentahydroxyflavanone hexosides, scutellarein 
7-O-hexoside, 3-hydroxyphloretin hexoside, and three other flavones, was made by 
detailed analysis of their UV and mass spectral data. The identification of the 
flavonoid glycosides was further confirmed through detection of their aglycones 
following hydrolysis of the samples. The concentration of the identified 
flavonoids in three samples was also estimated. This is the first report of 
detection of over 20 flavonoids, including chalcones, in this plant material.

Avenue, Beltsville, MD 20705, USA.

A screening method using LC-DAD-ESI/MS was applied to the analysis of flavonoids 
in celery, Chinese celery, and celery seeds (Apium graveolens L. and varieties). 
Fifteen flavonoid glycosides were detected in the three celery materials. They 
were identified as luteolin 7-O-apiosylglucoside, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, 
apigenin 7-O-apiosylglucoside, chrysoeriol 7-O-apiosylglucoside, chrysoeriol 
7-O-glucoside, and more than 10 malonyl derivatives of these glycosides. The 
identification of the malonyl derivatives was confirmed by their conversion into 
glycosides upon heating and by comparison of some of the malonates with 
malonates that had previously been identified in red bell pepper and parsley. 
The concentrations of the glycosides and the malonyl glycosides in the three 
materials were estimated by comparison to aglycone standards. This is the first 
report of the presence of these glycosylated flavonoid malonates in celery.

The major flavonoids in rat serum after oral administration of Dalbergia 
odorifera extract were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by high 
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and its coupling to mass spectrometry 
(HPLC-MS). Utilizing HPLC-MS technique, 18 flavonoids including five 
isoflavones, four isoflavanones, four neoflavones, two flavanones, two 
chalcones, one isoflavanonol were identified in free form in serum sample based 
on comparison with the authentic standards. Furthermore, the amounts of the four 
prominent flavonoids, (3R)-4'-methoxy-2',3,7-trihydroxyisoflavanone, vestitone, 
formononetin and sativanone were determined in serum by HPLC-UV with internal 
standard method. The method was validated and utilized in pharmacokinetic 
studies of these four analytes. This is the first report on identification and 
determination of the major flavonoids in rat serum after oral administration of 
D. odorifera extract and the results provided a firm basis for clarifying the 
pharmacological effect of D. odorifera and evaluating the clinical applications 
of this medicinal herb.

Importance of insoluble-bound phenolics to antioxidant properties of wheat.

Liyana-Pathirana CM(1), Shahidi F.

(1)Department of Biology, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, 
Newfoundland, A1B 3X9, Canada.

Two commercial samples of soft (70% Canadian Eastern soft red spring and 30% 
Canadian Eastern soft white winter) and hard (90% Canadian western hard red 
spring and 10% Canadian Eastern hard red winter) wheats were used to obtain 
different milling fractions. Phenolics extracted belonged to free, soluble 
esters and insoluble-bound fractions. Soluble esters of phenolics and 
insoluble-bound phenolics were extracted into diethyl ether after alkaline 
hydrolysis of samples. The content of phenolics was determined using 
Folin-Ciocalteu's reagent and expressed as ferulic acid equivalents (FAE). The 
antioxidant activity of phenolic fractions was evaluated using Trolox equivalent 
antioxidant capacity, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging, reducing 
power, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, inhibition of oxidation of human 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and DNA, Rancimat, inhibition of 
photochemilumenescence, and iron(II) chelation activity. The bound phenolic 
content in the bran fraction was 11.3 +/- 0.13 and 12.2 +/- 0.15 mg FAE/g 
defatted material for hard and soft wheats, respectively. The corresponding 
values for flour were 0.33 +/- 0.01 and 0.46 +/- 0.02 mg FAE/g defatted sample. 
The bound phenolic content of hard and soft whole wheats was 2.1 (+/-0.004 or 
+/-0.005) mg FAE/g defatted material. The free phenolic content ranged from 0.14 
+/- 0.004 to 0.98 +/- 0.05 mg FAE/g defatted milling fractions of hard and soft 
wheats examined. The contribution of bound phenolics to the total phenolic 
content was significantly higher than that of free and esterified fractions. In 
wheat, phenolic compounds were concentrated mainly in the bran tissues. In the 
numerous in vitro antioxidant assays carried out, the bound phenolic fraction 
demonstrated a significantly higher antioxidant capacity than free and 
esterified phenolics. Thus, inclusion of bound phenolics in studies related to 
quantification and antioxidant activity evaluation of grains and cereals is 
essential.

An LC-MS-based metabolomics approach for exploring urinary metabolome 
modifications after cocoa consumption.

Cocoa-phytochemicals have been related to the health-benefits of cocoa 
consumption. Metabolomics has been proposed as a powerful tool to characterize 
both the intake and the effects on the metabolism of dietary components. Human 
urine metabolome modifications after single cocoa intake were explored in a 
randomized, crossed, and controlled trial. After overnight fasting, 10 subjects 
consumed randomly either a single dose of cocoa powder with milk or water, or 
milk without cocoa. Urine samples were collected before the ingestion and at 
0-6, 6-12, and 12-24-h after test-meals consumption. Samples were analyzed by 
HPLC-q-ToF, followed by multivariate data analysis. Results revealed an 
important effect on urinary metabolome during the 24 h after cocoa powder 
intake. These changes were not influenced by matrix as no global differences 
were found between cocoa powder consumption with milk or with water. Overall, 27 
metabolites related to cocoa-phytochemicals, including alkaloid derivatives, 
polyphenol metabolites (both host and microbial metabolites) and 
processing-derived products such as diketopiperazines, were identified as the 
main contributors to the urinary modifications after cocoa powder intake. These 
results confirm that metabolomics will contribute to better characterization of 
the urinary metabolome in order to further explore the metabolism of 
phytochemicals and its relation with human health.

The aim of this study was to compare the amount and activity of phytonutrients 
in raw, grilled, and boiled eggplant fruit using chemical measures and a 
biological assay of oxidative bursts in human neutrophils. The thermally treated 
samples showed various changes in their chemical composition (dry matter, 
soluble solids, acidity, and the amount of alcohol insoluble substances) due to 
the cooking processes and were much richer in the main phenolic compounds such 
as chlorogenic and caffeic acids, which are known to be antioxidants. 
Consequently, their free radical scavenging activity was significantly higher, 
especially that of superoxide anion. The biological assay of oxidative bursts 
from human neutrophils in the presence of 
N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine confirmed the greater activity of 
extracts of the cooked eggplants with respect to raw eggplants. Successive 
extract dilutions showed a significant activity up to 1.25 microg/mL after 
cooking, while raw fruits resulted in an activity up to 10.00 microg/mL. These 
results showed that the thermal treatment commonly used before consumption can 
increase the content and biological activity of antioxidant compounds of 
eggplants.

Flavonoids are phytochemicals that are widespread in the human diet. Despite 
limitations in their bioavailability, experimental and epidemiological data 
suggest health benefits of flavonoid consumption. Valid biomarkers of flavonoid 
intake may be useful for estimating exposure in a range of settings. However, to 
date, few useful flavonoid biomarkers have been identified. In this study, we 
used a metabolite profiling approach to examine the aromatic and phenolic 
profile of plasma and urine of healthy men after oral consumption of 200 mg of 
the pure flavonoids, quercetin, (-)-epicatechin, and epigallocatechin gallate, 
which represent major flavonoid constituents in the diet. Following enzymatic 
hydrolysis, 71 aromatic compounds were quantified in plasma and urine at 2 and 5 
h, respectively, after flavonoid ingestion. Plasma concentrations of different 
aromatic compounds ranged widely, from 0.01 to 10 micromol/L, with variation 
among volunteers. None of the aromatic compounds was significantly elevated in 
plasma 2 h after consumption of either flavonoid compared with water placebo. 
This indicates that flavonoid-derived aromatic compounds are not responsible for 
the acute physiological effects reported within 2 h in previous human 
intervention studies involving flavonoids or flavonoid-rich food consumption. 
These effects are more likely due to absorption of the intact flavonoid. Our 
urine analysis suggested that urinary 4-ethylphenol, benzoic acid, and 
4-ethylbenzoic acid may be potential biomarkers of quercetin intake and 
1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene, 4-O-methylgallic acid, 3-O-methylgallic acid, and 
gallic acid may be potential markers of epigallocatechin gallate intake. 
Potential biomarkers of (-)-epicatechin were not identified. These urinary 
biomarkers may provide an accurate indication of flavonoid exposure.

We describe a reversed-phase HPLC method that uses gradient elution and diode 
array detection to determine four biologically active phenolic constituents of 
red wines: gallic acid, trans-resveratrol, quercetin and rutin. The method 
permits direct injection without sample pre-treatment. ODS Hypersil served as 
the stationary phase; the gradient was formed by acetic acid, methanol, and 
water. Each analysis required an equilibration period of 10 min and a run time 
of 50 min for completion. Previously, total phenols were analysed according to 
the Folin-Ciocalteu method, using gallic acid as the standard, and the results 
are given as gallic acid equivalent.

Germination is a process that enhances the content of health-promoting secondary 
metabolites. However, the bioaccessibility of these compounds depends on their 
stability and solubility throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The study aimed 
to explore how germination time influences the content and bioaccessibility of 
γ-aminobutyric acid and polyphenols and antioxidant capacity of lupin (Lupinus 
angustifolius L.) sprouts during simulated gastrointestinal digestion. 
Gamma-aminobutyric acid showed a decrease following gastrointestinal digestion 
(GID) whereas phenolic acids and flavonoids exhibited bioaccessibilities of up 
to 82.56 and 114.20%, respectively. Although the digestion process affected the 
profile of phenolic acids and flavonoids, certain isoflavonoids identified in 
7-day sprouts (G7) showed resistance to GID. Germination not only favored 
antioxidant activity but also resulted in germinated samples exhibiting greater 
antioxidant properties than ungerminated counter parts after GID. Intestinal 
digests from G7 did not show cytotoxicity in RAW 264.7 macrophages, and notably, 
they showed an outstanding ability to inhibit the production of reactive oxygen 
species. This suggests potential benefit in mitigating oxidative stress. These 
findings contribute to understand the dynamic interplay between bioprocessing 
and digestion in modulating the bioaccessibility of bioactive compounds in 
lupin, thereby impacting health.

White, blue, red and purple corns (Zea mays L.) were lime-cooked to obtain masa 
for tortillas. The total phenolics and anthocyanins content, antioxidant 
activity expressed as total reducing power (TRP), peroxyl radical bleaching 
(PRAC), total antioxidant activity (TAA) and quinone reductase (QR) induction in 
the murine hepatoma (Hepa 1 c1c7 cell line) as a biological marker for phase II 
detoxification enzymes were investigated. Among the extracts prepared from raw 
corn varieties the highest concentration of total phenolics, anthocyanins, 
antioxidant index and induction of QR-inducing activity were found in the 
Veracruz 42 (Ver 42) genotype. The nixtamalization process (masa) reduced total 
phenolics, anthocyanins and antioxidant activities and the ability for QR 
induction when was compared to raw grain. Processing masa into tortillas also 
negatively affected total phenolics, anthocyanin concentration, antioxidant 
activities, and QR induction in the colored corn varieties. The blue variety and 
its corresponding masa and tortillas did not induce QR. Ver 42 genotype and 
their products (masa and tortilla) showed the greatest antioxidant activity and 
capacity to induce QR.

This work aimed to establish the content of phenolic compounds, carbohydrates, 
and organic acids and to determine their potential to inactivate α-amylase, 
α-glucosidase, pancreatic lipase, 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX), acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE), and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), and antioxidant activity (ABTSo+ and 
FRAP) in 43 Prunus domestica cultivars. We identified 20 phenolic compounds, 
including, in the order of abundance, polymeric procyanidins, flavan-3-ols, 
phenolic acids, flavonols, and anthocyanins. The total content of phenolic 
compounds varied depending on the cultivar and ranged from 343.75 to 1419 mg/100 
g d.w. The cultivars of Ś2, Ś11, and Ś16 accumulated the greatest amounts of 
polyphenols, while in cvs. Ś42, Ś35, and Ś20 polyphenols were the least 
abundant. The highest antioxidant potential of 7.71 (ABTSo+) and 13.28 (FRAP) 
mmoL Trolox/100 g d.w. was confirmed for cv. Ś11. P. domestica fruits showed 
inhibitory activity toward α-amylase (2.63-61.53), α-glucosidase (0.19-24.07), 
pancreatic lipase (0.50-8.20), and lipoxygenase (15-LOX; 4.19-32.67), expressed 
as IC50 (mg/mL). The anti-AChE effect was stronger than the anti-BuChE one. Cv. 
Ś3 did not inhibit AChE activity, while cv. Ś35 did not inhibit BuChE. Thanks to 
the abundance of biologically active compounds, P. domestica offers several 
health-promoting benefits and may prevent many diseases. For these reasons, they 
are worth introducing into a daily diet.

High-performance liquid chromatography/diode-array detection (HPLC/DAD), 
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC/TOFMS) and quadrupole ion trap mass 
spectrometry (HPLC/QIT-MS) were used for separation, identification and 
structural analysis of lignans in Schisandra chinensis and rat plasma after oral 
administration of the herbal extract. Six lignans in Schisandra chinensis 
extract were identified unambiguously by comparing the retention time, their 
characteristic ultraviolet (UV) absorption and accurate mass measurement. A 
formula database of known lignans in Schisandra chinensis was established, 
against which the other 15 lignans were identified effectively based on the 
accurate extract masses and formulae acquired by HPLC/TOFMS. In order to 
distinguish the isomers, multi-stage mass spectrometry (ion trap mass 
spectrometry, MSn) was also used. The fragmentation behavior of the lignans in 
the ion trap mass spectrometer was studied by the six lignan standards, and 
their fragmentation rules in MSn spectra were summarized. These deduced 
fragmentation rules of lignans were successfully implemented in distinguishing 
the three groups of isomers in Schisandra chinensis by HPLC/QIT-MS. By using the 
three different analytical techniques, 21 lignans in Schisandra chinensis were 
identified within 30 min. After oral administration of the extract, 11 lignans 
in rat plasma were detected and identified by comparing their retention time, 
characteristic UV absorption and accurate mass measurement of peaks in 
HPLC/TOFMS chromatograms of the herbal extract. Finally, HPLC/TOFMS fingerprints 
of Schisandra chinensis in vitro and rat plasma in vivo were established. It is 
concluded that a rapid and effective method based on three analytical techniques 
for identification of chemical components was established, which is useful for 
rapid identification of multiple components in Schisandra chinensis in vitro and 
in vivo. In addition, it can provide help for further pharmacology and action 
mechanism study of lignans in Schisandra chinensis.

been searched in 45 species and varieties of Citrus. The phlorin content was 
determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography in juices and aqueous peel 
extracts of these different fruits. The phlorin content in C. reticulata peel 
extract varies from 0 to 1012 mg L(-)(1) with a mean of 162 mg L(-)(1). On the 
contrary, phlorin was not found in mandarin and clementine juices except for 
mandarin ""Commune"" and ""Beauty"" (33 and 30 mg L(-)(1), respectively). In the 14 
species of oranges and varieties, phlorin was detected in juices and peel 
extracts with a mean of 22 and 492 mg L(-)(1), respectively, while for 
grapefruits, means were 108 mg L(-)(1) in juices and 982 mg L(-)(1) for peel 
extracts. Tangors and tangelos which are hybrids (C. reticulata x C. sinensis 
and C. reticulata x C. paradisi, respectively) are characterized by the 
systematic presence of phlorin in peels (mean: 406 and 659 mg L(-)(1), 
respectively) while in juices its presence could be variable (0-73 mg L(-)(1)). 
These heterogeneity and values may be explained by the genetic variability of 
these hybrids and the phlorin content of their parentage group.

Recent interest in food phenolics has increased greatly, because of their 
antioxidant and free radical scavenging abilities. Popular beverages in the 
world include tea, coffee, cocoa, beer, wine and fruit/vegetable juices. All of 
these beverages contain phenolic compounds. In present study total polyphenol 
content and in vitro antioxidant properties were investigated in 16 red wines, 5 
white wines, 5 lager beers, 3 dark beers, 17 fruit juices and 5 vegetable 
juices. High polyphenol content was measured in red wines (1720 +/- 546 mg x 
L(-1)) and in some fruit juices such as elderberry and prunes (5,680 and 1,807 
mg x L(-1), respectively). The concentration of polyphenols was between 159 and 
5,680 mg x L(-1) in fruit juices and between 255 and 696 mg x L(-1) in vegetable 
ones, while low level of phenolics was observed in dark and lager beers and 
white wines (473, 376 and 392 mg x L(-1), respectively). All samples exhibited 
significant antioxidant properties such as hydrogen-donating ability, reducing 
power, chelating ability and total antioxidant status (TAS) value. These 
antioxidant properties strongly correlated with the total polyphenol content of 
the beverages.

This study investigates the impact of varying addition levels (5 %, 15 %, and 
25 %) of freeze-dried (FD) and sun-dried (SD) daylily flowers on the 
physicochemical properties, bioactive compounds, antioxidant activities, 
metabolomic profiles, and volatile compounds in craft beer. Daylily addition 
significantly altered physicochemical parameters, with the 25 % FD treatment 
enhancing polyphenol content by 48 %, flavonoids by 40 %, and antioxidant 
activity (DPPH scavenging) by 33.4 %. Metabolomics analysis revealed significant 
changes in the beer's secondary metabolite profile, particularly in flavonoid 
biosynthesis, terpenoid metabolism, and key volatile compounds such as ionones 
and oxabicycloheptane derivatives. While FD samples showed higher concentrations 
of bioactive compounds, volatile compound analysis revealed that SD samples 
exhibited stronger flavor characteristics, particularly in fruity, green, sweet, 
and floral notes. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated greater preservation of 
bioactive compounds in FD samples, especially those involved in flavonoid and 
terpenoid biosynthesis pathways. However, high addition levels (25 %) of both 
treatments increased off-flavor precursors, highlighting the need for careful 
optimization. These findings demonstrate the potential of daylily flowers as a 
functional ingredient in craft beer, with freeze-drying better preserving 
bioactive compounds while sun-drying providing superior flavor characteristics, 
suggesting that drying methods should be selected based on specific product 
requirements. This study provides valuable insights for creating unique, 
healthy, and flavorful craft beers through optimized daylily addition.

Cocoa products are obtained from the seeds of Theobroma cacao L. In this 
research, cocoa liquor and chocolate produced from cocoa beans from West Africa 
(Forastero, ""bulk"" cacao) and Ecuador (Nacional variety, ""fine-flavor"" cacao), 
were investigated, using a novel approach in which various analytical techniques 
are combined in order to obtain in-depth knowledge of the studied cocoa samples. 
The levels of various classes of primary metabolites were determined and a wide 
range of secondary metabolites, including volatile organic acids, aldehydes, 
esters, pyrazines, polyphenols, methylxanthines and biogenic amines, were 
identified and/or quantified by HS-SPME GC-MS (headspace-solid phase 
microextraction gas chromatography - mass spectrometry). and UPLC-HRMS 
(ultra-performance liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry). 
Odor Activity Values (OAV) were calculated to assess the contribution of 
individual volatiles on the final aroma. Various volatile aroma compounds were 
more abundant in the West African cocoa liquor and chocolate, while the 
Ecuadorian samples were richer in most quantified non-volatile metabolites. 
Principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed that the four samples can be 
clearly distinguished. Alcohols, pyrazines, amino acids and biogenic amines were 
found to be highly influential in causing this differentiation. The proposed 
approach can be useful in future studies on more extensive cocoa sample 
collections, in order to highlight similarities and pinpoint typical differences 
in chemical composition among these samples.

Sample preparation is often overlooked and is frequently considered as ""a means 
to an end"". This systematic study with a phenolic-enriched substrate, eggplant 
(Solanum melongena L.), was undertaken to evaluate the substantial variations in 
the extraction techniques, solvents, and parameters as described in the 
published literature. Direct comparison of over 10 extraction procedures or 
conditions was performed to show the importance and influence of sample 
preparation on the assay of phenolic compounds. Chlorogenic acid (CA) was the 
most abundant phenolic acid accounting for >75% of the total phenolic acids 
content extracted from the eggplant sample. Optimum extraction of CA and total 
phenolics (TP) from Black Bell cultivar of eggplant were obtained when 
extractions were performed with a mixture of MeOH/H2O at a ratio of 80:20% v/v 
using a pressurized liquid extractor (PLE) at 100 degrees C. The amount of CA 
and TP extracted from eggplant by the previously reported procedures using a 
wrist shaker, rotary shaker, stirring, sonication, or reflux with different 
extraction solvents (acetone or varying composition of MeOH/H2O solvent 
mixtures) varied significantly between 5 and 95% as compared to PLE. The 
predominant phenolic acids in the free phenolic acid fraction of Black Beauty 
cultivar of eggplant were CA isomers. However, caffeic acid isomers were the 
major phenolic acids extracted from the base-hydrolyzed fraction. The total 
amount of caffeic acid extracted from the Italian Neon cultivar was more that 
twice that of four other eggplant cultivars (Orient Express, Calliope Zebra 
Stripe, Orient Charm Neon, and Black Beauty).

Resveratrol in the fruits of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.), the lowbush 
""wild"" blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton), the rabbiteye blueberry 
(Vaccinium ashei Reade), and the highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) 
were measured using a new assay based on high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The LC-MS/MS assay provided 
lower limits of detection than previous methods for resveratrol measurement, 90 
fmol of trans-resveratrol injected on-column, and a linear standard curve 
spanning >3 orders of magnitude. The recoveries of resveratrol from blueberries 
spiked with 1.8, 3.6, or 36 ng/g were 91.5 +/- 4.5, 95.6 +/- 6.5, and 88.0 +/- 
3.6%, respectively. trans-Resveratrol but not cis-resveratrol was detected in 
both blueberry and bilberry samples. The highest levels of trans-resvertatrol in 
these specimens were 140.0 +/- 29.9 pmol/g in highbush blueberries from Michigan 
and 71.0 +/- 15.0 pmol/g in bilberries from Poland. However, considerable 
regional variation was observed; highbush blueberries from British Columbia 
contained no detectable resveratrol. Because blueberries and bilberries are 
often consumed after cooking, the effect of baking on resveratrol content was 
investigated. After 18 min of heating at 190 degrees C, between 17 and 46% of 
the resveratrol had degraded in the various Vaccinium species. Therefore, the 
resveratrol content of baked or heat-processed blueberries or bilberries should 
be expected to be lower than in the raw fruit. Although blueberries and 
bilberries were found to contain resveratrol, the level of this chemoprotective 
compound in these fruits was <10% that reported for grapes. Furthermore, cooking 
or heat processing of these berries will contribute to the degradation of 
resveratrol.

A highly sensitive and specific electrospray ionization (ESI) liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method for quantitation of 
naringenin (NAR) and an explanation for the double peaks phenomenon was 
developed and validated. NAR was extracted from rat plasma and tissues along 
with the internal standard (IS), hesperidin, with ethyl acetate. The analytes 
were analyzed in the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode as the 
precursor/product ion pair of m/z 273.4/151.3 for NAR and m/z 611.5/303.3 for 
the IS. The assay was linear over the concentration range of 5-2500 ng/mL. The 
lower limit quantification was 5 ng/mL, available for plasma pharmacokinetics of 
NAR in rats. Accuracy in within- and between-run precisions showed good 
reproducibility. When NAR was administered orally, only little and predominantly 
its glucuronidation were into circulation in the plasma. There existed double 
peaks phenomenon in plasma concentration-time curve leading to the relatively 
slow elimination of NAR in plasma. The results showed that there was a linear 
relationship between the AUC of total NAR and dosages. And the double peaks are 
mainly due to enterohepatic circulation.

High-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode array and 
electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (MS) detection was used to study 
phenolic compounds in berries of black, green, red, and white currants (Ribes 
spp.). UV-visible spectrometry was a valuable tool for the identification of the 
class of the phenolic compound, whereas MS and MS-MS fragmentation data were 
useful for further structural characterization. Distinct similarities were found 
in the relative distribution of conjugated forms of phenolic compounds among the 
four currants. Phenolic acids were found mainly as hexose esters. Flavonol 
glycosides and anthocyanin pigments were mainly found as 3-O-rutinosides and 
second as 3-O-glucosides. However, cyanidin 3-O-sambubioside and quercetin 
hexoside-malonate were notable phenolic compounds in red currant. Flavonol 
hexoside-malonates were identified and quantified in the berries of currants for 
the first time.

High-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode array and 
electrospray ionization mass spectrometric detection was used to study soluble 
and insoluble forms of phenolic compounds in strawberries, raspberries (red and 
yellow cultivated and red wild), arctic bramble, and cloudberries. 
Hydroxycinnamic acids were present as free forms in cloudberries and mainly as 
sugar esters in the other berries. Quercetin 3-glucuronide was the typical 
flavonol glycoside in all of the berries studied. The composition of the 
predominant anthocyanins can be used to distinguish the studied red Rubus 
species from each other since cyanidin was glycosylated typically with 
3-sophorose (56%) in cultivated red raspberry, with 3-sophorose (30%) and 
3-glucose (27%) in wild red raspberry, and with 3-rutinose (80%) in arctic 
bramble. Ellagic acid was present as free and glycosylated forms and as 
ellagitannins of varying degrees of polymerization. Comparable levels of 
ellagitannins were obtained by the analysis of soluble ellagitannins as gallic 
acid equivalents and by the analysis of ellagic acid equivalents released by 
acid hydrolysis of the extracts.

The present study evaluated the antiproliferative capacity and possible cell 
death mechanisms of lyophilized mango pulp extract (LMPE), applied to human 
colon cancer cells (SW480) and their metastasis-derived counterparts (SW620). 
The total phenolic content of LMPE was estimated by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. 
Three assays were employed to determine its antioxidant capacity: 
ferric-reducing antioxidant power, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, and 
2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. Furthermore, the antiproliferative activity of 
LMPE was assessed by sulforhodamine B, clonogenic, and Ki-67 assays. Flow 
cytometry was employed to examine the cell cycle, production of intracellular 
reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell-surface phosphatidylserine, and change in 
mitochondrial membrane potential. LMPE exhibited a high level of total phenolic 
content and antioxidant activity. The mean maximal inhibitory concentration 
values of LMPE at 48 h of exposure were 43 and 29 mg/mL for SW480 and SW620, 
respectively. In the SW480 and SW620 cell lines, LMPE at 50 mg/mL and 48 h of 
exposure induced an increase in intracellular ROS, cell cycle arrest in the G2/M 
phase, and probably, apoptotic processes without mitochondrial depolarization. 
LMPE had an antiproliferative capacity against the human colorectal cancer cell 
lines SW480 and SW620. These results highlight the chemopreventive potential of 
LMPE in colorectal cancer treatments.

Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is one of the most important legume crops for 
human consumption because of its nearly perfect nutritional composition. 
However, the crop yield is invariably constrained by phosphorus (P) stress 
across all farming systems. The present study aimed to unravel the mechanistic 
basis of common bean response to P stress at the early vegetative phase using an 
integrated multi-omic approach. In vitro experiments were carried out with P 
sufficient (P+) and total P deficient (P-) treatments using common bean SFB-1 
seed cultivar. The plants were grown in MGRL media for a duration of three 
weeks. Various morphological traits were significantly reduced under P- stress 
conditions. There was a significant decrease in the levels of biochemical 
parameters such as free amino acids, secondary metabolites, and osmolytes 
(proline, total soluble sugars, and glycine betaine) under P- growth conditions. 
Additionally, photosynthetic pigments (such as chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, 
total chlorophyll, and total carotenoids), physiological parameters (such as 
relative water content and stress injury), as well as both enzymatic and 
non-enzymatic antioxidants (including catalase, peroxidase, superoxide 
dismutase, total phenolics, and flavonoids), were also significantly reduced. 
Proteomic analysis identified two key proteins, homocysteine methyltransferase 
and DDB1-CUL4 associated factor 1-like protein, which are involved in various 
stress adaptation pathways. Furthermore, techniques such as FTIR spectroscopy, 
SEM, SEM-EDX, and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy were used to validate the 
metabolic changes induced by phosphorus deficiency. Phosphorus deficiency led to 
profound metabolic changes affecting photosynthesis, defense-related protein 
expression, cell wall composition, secondary metabolite production, levels of 
phytohormone precursors, free amino acids, antioxidant activity, and osmolyte 
accumulation, all of which contributed to inhibited plant growth and 
development.

A method was developed to determine the flavanols prodelphinidin B3, procyanidin 
B3, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin by high-performance liquid chromatography, 
using dual-channel electrochemical detection. This method was especially suited 
to the direct analysis of beer samples and to analysis of acetone extracts of 
barley samples, and was capable of determining proanthocyanidins and catechins 
at levels of 0.1-5.0 mg l-1. The use of dual-channel electrochemical detection 
also enabled unambiguous peak identification by measurement of collection 
efficiencies. This method offered improved sensitivity and selectivity compared 
with ultraviolet detection, and sample preparation procedures were greatly 
simplified. The method was applied to the comparison of stabilized and 
unstabilized lagers, and to the analysis of different barley varieties grown in 
Ireland.

Three espresso coffee (EC) samples of different botanical varieties and types of 
roast were prepared in standard conditions using an experimental EC prototype: 
Arabica coffee, Robusta Natural blend, and Robusta Torrefacto blend (a special 
roast by adding sugar). The ECs were characterized with regard to the physical 
parameters, amount of total solids, total solids on filtrate, lipids, caffeine, 
trigonelline, and chlorogenic acids by HPLC, and sensory descriptive analysis 
related to foam appearance, taste, and mouthfeel. Principal component analysis 
(PCA) was applied to differentiate the EC samples. Arabica and Robusta samples 
were separated successfully by principal component 1 (55.3% of variance) 
including physicochemical and sensory parameters related to foam and taste of 
ECs. Torrefacto and Robusta Natural EC samples were separated by principal 
component 2 (20.7% of total variance) including mouthfeel and other attributes 
of color foam. Some interesting correlations among sensory and physicochemical 
variables were found. A very simple discriminate function was obtained by 
discriminate analysis allowing the classification of each EC sample into its 
respective group with a success rate of 100%.

Chania, P.O. Box 85, 73100, Chania, Greece. dimitris@maich.gr

Two commonly consumed plant foods, onion bulbs and asparagus spears, were 
subjected to typical domestic processing, including chopping, maceration, and 
boiling. The impact of these processes on flavonol content was assessed. 
Further, the consequences of these processes on the antioxidant capacity of the 
tissues were evaluated with the beta-carotene bleaching method. Chopping 
significantly affected rutin content in asparagus, yielding an 18.5% decrease in 
60 min; but in onions, quercetin 3,4'-diglucoside (Q(DG)) and quercetin 
4'-glucoside (Q(MG)) were virtually unaffected by chopping. Boiling for 60 min 
had more severe effects, as it caused overall flavonol losses of 20.6 and 43.9% 
in onions and asparagus, respectively. Chopping of tissues did not considerably 
influence the antioxidant capacity, but boiling did provoke notable changes.

Stress factors occurring during the growing season and potato storage, can 
negatively affect the quality of tubers, including an increased tendency to 
enzymatic darkening. Abiotic stress due to water shortage is a major factor 
limiting agricultural production. The purpose of the study was to determine the 
effect of cultivation technology based on the use of biostimulant, hydrogel and 
irrigation as well as storage on the propensity to darkening and the content of 
sugars and organic acids. The results show that genotypic and technological 
variability in interaction with growing season conditions had a significant 
(p < 0.05) effect on the oxidative potential (OP) of potato tubers. The Denar 
cultivar, compared to the 'Gardena', was characterized by a lower tendency to 
enzymatic darkening. Application of biostimulant and hydrogel generally 
contributed to lowering the oxidative potential of the tested cultivars. The 
application of anti-stress agents had no effect on organic acid content. The 
long-term storage caused an increase in the content of total sugars (TS) (22%), 
reducing sugars (RS) (49%), chlorogenic acid (ACH) (11%), and loss of ascorbic 
acid (AA) (6%) in the tubers which contributed to an increase in the oxidative 
potential of potato tubers (16%). The correlation coefficients obtained 
(p < 0.05) confirm the dependence of OP on the concentration of organic acids.

Phenolic compounds in 46 Spanish cider apple varieties were determined by 
RP-HPLC with direct injection. Several pattern recognition procedures, including 
principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and 
partial least squares (PLS-1), were applied to the data in an attempt to 
classify the samples into bitter and nonbitter categories. Reliable decision 
rules were obtained by both LDA and PLS-1. LDA achieved 91.3 and 85.7% correct 
classification respectively, for internal and external evaluation of the model.

PURPOSE: Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), an anthocyanin component of fruits and 
berries, possesses cancer chemopreventive properties in mouse models of 
carcinogenesis. Its pharmacokinetics and metabolism in mice have hitherto not 
been studied.
METHODS: C57BL6J mice received C3G by either gavage at 500 mg/kg or tail vein 
injection at 1 mg/kg. Blood, urine, bile and heart, lung, kidney, liver, 
prostate, brain and gastrointestinal (gi) mucosal tissues were obtained up to 2 
h after administration. Levels of C3G and its anthocyanin metabolites were 
determined by HPLC with visible detection. Metabolites were identified by 
LC/MS/MS.
RESULTS: After oral administration peak concentrations of anthocyanins occurred 
within 30 min after administration. Levels were highest in the urine and gi 
mucosa. In the gi mucosa and liver the predominant flavonoid species after oral 
administration was C3G, whilst after iv dosing the majority of anthocyanins was 
C3G metabolites. After oral or iv administration, C3G half-lives in the 
different biofluids and tissues ranged from 0.7 to 1.8 h and 0.3 to 0.7 h, 
respectively. Systemic bioavailabilities for parent C3G and total anthocyanins 
were 1.7 and 3.3%, respectively. The major metabolites of C3G were products of 
methylation and glucuronidation. Cyanidin was a minor metabolite in the gut.
CONCLUSION: C3G and its metabolites were recovered from murine tissues which may 
be targets for cancer chemopreventive intervention. Anthocyanin levels achieved 
in the gi mucosa, prostate and the kidneys were of an order of magnitude 
consistent with pharmacological activity.

Pharmacokinetics of trans-resveratrol in its aglycone (RES(AGL)) and glucuronide 
(RES(GLU)) forms were studied following intravenous (15 mg/kg i.v.) and oral (50 
mg/kg p.o.) administration of trans-resveratrol in a solution of 
beta-cyclodextrin to intact rats. In addition, the enterohepatic recirculation 
of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) was assessed in a linked-rat model. Multiple plasma and 
urine samples were collected and concentrations of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) were 
determined using an electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
spectrometry method. After i.v. administration, plasma concentrations of 
RES(AGL) declined with a rapid elimination half-life (T(1/2), 0.13 h), followed 
by sudden increases in plasma concentrations 4 to 8 h after drug administration. 
These plasma concentrations resulted in a significant prolongation of the 
terminal elimination half-life of RES(AGL) (T(1/2TER), 1.31 h). RES(AGL) and 
RES(GLU) also displayed sudden increases in plasma concentrations 4 to 8 h after 
oral administration, with T(1/2TER) of 1.48 and 1.58 h, respectively. RES(AGL) 
bioavailability was 38% and its exposure was approximately 46-fold lower than 
that of RES(GLU) (AUC(inf), 7.1 versus 324.7 micromol.h/l). Enterohepatic 
recirculation was confirmed in the linked-rat model since significant plasma 
concentrations of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) were observed in bile-recipient rats at 
4 to 8 h. The percentages of the exposures of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) that were 
due to enterohepatic recirculation were 24.7 and 24.0%, respectively. The 
fraction of drug excreted in the urine over a period of 12 h was negligible. 
These results confirm that RES(AGL) is bioavailable and undergoes extensive 
first-pass glucuronidation, and that enterohepatic recirculation contributes 
significantly to the exposure of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) in rats.

Universitario, Espinardo, Murcia, Spain.

Sweet peppers (Capsicum annuum L.) cv. Vergasa have been studied at four 
maturity stages (immature green, green, immature red, and red). The individual 
phenolics (hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids), vitamin C (ascorbic acid and 
dehydroascorbic acid), and individual carotenoids were characterized and 
quantified. Five hydroxycinnamic derivatives and 23 flavonoids were 
characterized and quantified from the pericarp of sweet pepper by 
high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray 
ionization-mass spectrometry. Identification was carried out by their UV 
spectra, chromatographic comparisons with authentic markers, identification of 
hydrolysis products, and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Hydroxycinnamic 
derivatives, O-glycosides of quercetin, luteolin, and chrysoeriol, and a large 
number of C-glycosyl flavones have been characterized. Some of these compounds 
were found for the first time in nature. Clear differences in the individual and 
total phenolic content were detected between the different maturity stages. 
Immature green pepper had a very high phenolic content while green, immature 
red, and red ripe peppers showed a 4-5-fold reduction. Ascorbic acid was the 
main form of vitamin C, and its content increased as the pepper reached 
maturity. The red ripe stage had a relevant impact on the carotenoids content. 
Thus, immature green peppers showed the highest content of polyphenols, while 
red ripe fruits had the highest content of vitamin C and provitamin A.

humans and subjects with an ileostomy.

The phloretin-O-glycosides, phloretin-2'-O-glucoside and 
phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside, are thought to be unique to apples and 
apple products. To investigate the metabolism and bioavailability of these 
compounds, nine healthy and five ileostomy human subjects consumed 500 mL of 
Thatchers Redstreak apple cider containing 46 micromol of 
phloretin-O-glycosides. Over the ensuing 24 h period, plasma, urine, and ileal 
fluid were collected prior to analysis by high-performance liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The sole metabolite present in 
quantifiable amounts in plasma was phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, which reached a 
peak concentration (C(max)) of 73 nmol/L and 0.6 h after ingestion (T(max)) with 
the healthy subjects, and statistically similar values were obtained with the 
ileostomy volunteers. Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide was also detected in urine 
along with two additional phloretin-O-glucuronides and a 
phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate. The quantity of phloretin metabolites 
excreted in urine represented 5.0 + or - 0.9% of intake in healthy volunteers 
and 5.5 + or - 0.6% in ileostomy volunteers. The similarity in the excretion 
levels of the two groups and the rapid plasma T(max) indicate absorption of the 
dihydrochalcones in the small intestine. Of the two major phloretin-O-glycosides 
in cider, only phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside was recovered in ileal 
fluid in quantities corresponding to 22% of intake. The absence of 
phloretin-2'-O-glucoside in ileal fluid suggests that it is more readily 
absorbed than phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside. 
Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, two other phloretin-O-glucuronides, one 
phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate, two phloretin-O-sulfates, and the aglycone 
phloretin were also detected in the ileal fluid. This implies that the wall of 
the small intestine contains beta-glycosidase, sulfuryltransferase, and 
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities and that, as well as being absorbed, 
sizable amounts of the phloretin metabolites that are formed efflux back into 
the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. The overall recovery of the 
dihydrochalcones and their metabolites in the ileal fluid was equivalent to 
38.6% of intake.

The present study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of three different grapefruit 
flavanone forms in dog plasma and demonstrated their absorption after an oral 
intake of a grapefruit extract; pharmacokinetic parameters of these forms were 
also determined. Ten healthy beagles were administered 70 mg citrus flavonoids 
as a grapefruit extract contained in capsules, while two additional dogs were 
used as controls and given an excipient. The grapefruit flavanone naringin, 
along with its metabolites naringenin and naringenin glucuronide, was detected 
in dog plasma. Blood samples were collected between 0 and 24 h after 
administration of the extract. Naringin reached its maximun plasma concentration 
at around 80 min, whereas naringenin and naringenin glucuronide reached their 
maximun plasma concentrations at around 20 and 30 min, respectively. Maximum 
plasma concentrations of naringin, naringenin and naringenin glucuronide 
(medians and ranges) were 0.24 (0.05-2.08), 0.021 (0.001-0.3) and 0.09 
(0.034-0.12) micromol/l, respectively. The areas under the curves were 23.16 l 
(14.04-70.62) min x micromol/for nariningin, 1.78 (0.09-4.95) min x micromol/l 
for naringenin and 22.5 (2.74-99.23) min x micromol/l for naringenin 
glucuronide. The median and range values for mean residence time were 3.3 
(1.5-9.3), 2.8 (0.8-11.2) and 8.0 (2.3-13.1) h for naringin, naringenin and 
naringenin glucuronide, respectively. The results of the present study 
demonstrate the absorption of grapefruit flavanones via the presence of their 
metabolites in plasma, thus making an important contribution to the field since 
the biological activities ascribed to these compounds rely on their specific 
forms of absorption.

The present study evaluates for the first time in dogs, the kinetics of green 
tea catechins and their metabolic forms in plasma and urine. Ten beagles were 
administered 173 mg (12.35 mg/kg body weight) of catechins as a green tea 
extract, in capsules. Blood samples were collected during 24 h after intake and 
urine samples were collected during the following periods of time: 0-2, 2-6, 6-8 
and 8-24 h. Two catechins with a galloyl moiety and three conjugated metabolites 
were detected in plasma. Most of the detected forms in plasma reached their 
maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) at around 1 h. Median Cmax for ( - 
)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), ( - )-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), ( - 
)-epigallocatechin glucuronide (EGC-glucuronide), ( - )-epicatechin glucuronide 
(EC-glucuronide), ( - )-epicatechin sulphate (EC-sulphate) were 0.3 (range 
0.1-1.9), 0.1 (range 0-0.4), 0.8 (range 0.2-3.9), 0.2 (range 0.1-1.7) and 1 
(range 0.3-3.4) micromol/l, respectively. The areas under the plasma 
concentration v. time curves (AUC0 --> 24) were 427 (range 102-1185) micromol/l 
x min for EGC-glucuronide, 112 (range 53-919) micromol/l x min for EC-sulphate, 
71 (range 26-306) micromol/l x min for EGCG, 40 (range 12-258) micromol/l x min 
for EC-glucuronide and 14 (range 0.1-124) micromol/l x min for ECG. The values 
of mean residence time (MRT0 --> 24) were 5 (range 2-16), 2 (range 1-11), 10 
(range 2-13), 3 (range 2-16) and 2.4 (range 1-18) h for EGCG, ECG, 
EGC-glucuronide, EC-glucuronide and EC-sulphate, respectively. In urine, 
catechins were present as conjugated forms, suggesting bile excretion of EGCG 
and ECG. Green tea catechins are absorbed following an oral administration and 
EGC-glucuronide is the metabolic form that remains in the organism for a longer 
period of time, suggesting that this compound could suffer an enterohepatic 
cycle.

Antonio Novais 10, Ciudad Universitaria, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.

To study the potential hepatic metabolism of olive oil phenols, human hepatoma 
HepG2 cells were incubated for 2 and 18 h with hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and 
hydroxytyrosyl acetate, three phenolic constituents of olive oil. After 
incubation, culture media and cell lysates were hydrolyzed with 
beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase and analyzed by LC-MS. In vitro methylation, 
glucuronidation, and sulfation of pure phenols were also performed. Methylated 
and glucuronidated forms of hydroxytyrosol were detected at 18 h of incubation, 
together with methylglucuronidated metabolites. Hydroxytyrosyl acetate was 
largely converted into free hydroxytyrosol and subsequently metabolized, yet 
small amounts of glucuronidated hydroxytyrosyl acetate were detected. Tyrosol 
was poorly metabolized, with <10% of the phenol glucuronidated after 18 h. Minor 
amounts of free or conjugated phenols were detected in cell lysates. No sulfated 
metabolites were found. In conclusion, olive oil phenols can be metabolized by 
the liver as suggested by the results obtained using HepG2 cells as a hepatic 
model system.

Antioxidant activity of the main phenolic compounds isolated from hot pepper 
fruit (Capsicum annuum L).

Four cultivars (Bronowicka Ostra, Cyklon, Tornado, and Tajfun) of pepper fruit 
Capsicum annuum L. were studied for phenolics contents and antioxidant activity. 
Two fractions of phenolics, flavonoids (with phenolic acids) and capsaicinoids, 
were isolated from the pericarp of pepper fruit at two growth stages (green and 
red) and were studied for their antioxidant capacity. Both fractions from red 
fruits had higher activities than those from green fruits. A comparison of the 
capsaicinoid fraction with the flavonoid and phenolic acid fraction from red 
fruit with respect to their antioxidant activity gave similar results. Phenolic 
compounds were separated and quantified by LC and HPLC. Contents of nine 
compounds were determined in the flavonoid and phenolic acid fraction: 
trans-p-feruloyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, 
trans-p-sinapoyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, quercetin 
3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside-7-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside, trans-p-ferulyl 
alcohol-4-O-[6-(2-methyl-3-hydroxypropionyl] glucopyranoside, luteolin 
6-C-beta-d-glucopyranoside-8-C-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside, apigenin 
6-C-beta-d-glucopyranoside-8-C-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside, lutoeolin 
7-O-[2-(beta-d-apiofuranosyl)-beta-d-glucopyranoside], quercetin 
3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside, and luteolin 
7-O-[2-(beta-d-apiofuranosyl)-4-(beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-6-malonyl]-beta-d-glucopyranoside. 
The main compounds of this fraction isolated from red pepper were sinapoyl and 
feruloyl glycosides, and the main compound from green pepper was 
quercetin-3-O-l-rhamnoside. Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were the main 
components of the capsaicinoid fraction. A high correlation was found between 
the content of these compounds and the antioxidant activity of both fractions. 
Their antioxidant activities were elucidated by heat-induced oxidation in the 
beta-carotene-linoleic acid system and the antiradical activity by the 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) decoloration test. The highest antioxidant 
activity in the beta-carotene-linoleic acid system was found for 
trans-p-sinapoyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, which was lower than the activity of 
free sinapic acid. Quercetin 3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside had the highest 
antiradical activity in the DPPH system, which was comparable to the activity of 
quercetin. The activities of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were similar to that 
of trans-p-feruloyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside in the DPPH model system.

Garnacha Tintorera (also known as Alicante Bouschet) is one of the few V. 
vinifera grape cultivars with red-colored berry flesh. The study of the phenolic 
composition of both berry flesh and skin of Garnacha Tintorera grapes shows 
interesting findings. Anthocyanins were asymmetrically distributed within grape 
flesh and skins. Malvidin derivatives dominated in skin, followed by 
peonidin-type anthocyanins; in contrast, the flesh almost exclusively contained 
peonidin 3-glucoside. In addition, LC-UV-vis and LC-MS evidence suggest the 
presence of small amounts of peonidin 3,5-diglucoside and a second peonidin 
dihexoside derivative, and, very likely, the first report of the occurrence of 
pelargonidin 3-glucoside and its acetyl and p-coumaroyl derivatives in V. 
vinifera grapes. Flavonols also occurred in the flesh of Garnacha Tintorera 
grapes, but its flavonol profile showed lower contribution of trisubstituted 
flavonoid structures (myricetin, laricitrin, and syringetin) when compared to 
that of skin. The skin of Garnacha Tintorera grapes contained hydroxycinnamic 
acids in higher amounts than in flesh, caftaric acid being the main derivative 
found, and coutaric acid accounting for its highest proportion in the skin. The 
phenolic composition of the whole grape berries reflected the average of the 
differences described for the two aforementioned berry parts, and subsequently, 
the red wines made from these grapes had a phenolic composition closer to that 
shown by the whole berries. The formation of anthocyanin-derived pigments in 
Garnacha Tintorera red wines makes necessary the use of LC-MS for detecting the 
minor pelargonidin-based anthocyanins and peonidin dihexoside, which could be 
suggested as chemical markers for cultivar authentication of this grape cultivar 
and its wines.

simultaneous analysis of chlorogenic acids and their metabolites in human 
plasma.

Haga, Tochigi 321-3497, Japan.

A method using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous analysis of nine 
chlorogenic acids (CGAs), three isomers each of caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs), 
feruloylquinic acids (FQAs) and dicaffeoylquinic acids (dCQAs), and their two 
metabolites, caffeic acid (CA) and ferulic acid (FA), in human plasma. In 
simultaneous multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) measurements using ESI-MS/MS 
with a negative ion mode, a deprotonated molecular ion derived from each of the 
11 molecules was used as a precursor ion while three diagnostic product ions 
characteristic for each were selected for the qualitative analysis. To obtain 
maximal intensities for all diagnostic product ions, the collision energy was 
optimized for each one. LC separation was achieved under conditions of a 
reversed-phase Inertsil ODS-2 column combined with a gradient elution system 
using 50mM acetic acid with 3% acetonitrile aqueous solution and 50 mM acetic 
acid with 100% acetonitrile. In the quantitative analysis, one of the three 
diagnostic product ions for each of the 11 molecules was selected. Application 
of simultaneous LC-ESI-MS/MS MRM measurements to analyze the 11 standards spiked 
into blank human plasma indicated that all diagnostic product ions were detected 
without any interference, and that the sensitivity, linearity and recovery of 
this method were acceptable. When using this method to analyze those 11 
molecules in the plasma after oral ingestion of 250 ml of a drink containing a 
green coffee bean extract (300 mg CGAs), all 11 molecules were identified and 
CQAs, FQAs and FA were quantified. CQAs, FQAs and dCQAs in human plasma were 
detected for the first time. This method should be useful to understand the 
biological and pharmacological effects of CGAs, such as improvement of human 
hypertension.

Hesperidin is a biologically effective flavonoid. Several studies have reported 
that dietary hesperidin was converted to conjugated metabolites, such as 
hesperetin-glucuronides and sulfoglucuronides, during absorption and metabolism. 
However, the chemical structures of the conjugated metabolites, especially the 
sites of glucuronidation and sulfoglucuronidation in plasma, were unconfirmed. 
Therefore, the concentrations of the metabolites conjugated at various sites in 
plasma could not be individually quantified. In the present study, we identified 
the chemical structures and concentrations of the major conjugated metabolites 
in rat plasma after oral administration of hesperidin. Two 
hesperetin-glucuronides were prepared and identified as 
hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Using 
these authentic compounds, the concentrations of 
hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide in rat 
plasma were individually determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
In rat plasma, hesperetin-glucuronides were primarily comprised of 
hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. The 
concentration of hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide was slightly higher than that 
of hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Furthermore, not only hesperetin 
conjugates but also homoeriodictyol conjugates were observed in rat plasma. The 
present study is the first report elucidating the chemical structures and 
changes in individual concentrations in rat plasma of glucuronides derived from 
orally administered hesperidin.

Anthocyanins (ACs) are phenolic compounds that are distributed widely in fruits 
and vegetables. Although consumption of these compounds has been shown to 
improve visual function, the distribution of ACs in ocular tissue has not been 
examined in detail. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the ocular 
distribution of blackcurrant anthocyanins (BCAs) in rats and rabbits after oral, 
intravenous (i.v.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration. Identification and 
quantification of ACs were carried out using high-performance liquid 
chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) and 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV-visible detection, 
respectively. BCAs were identified in the plasma and whole eye after oral and 
i.p. administration in rats. No other peaks were detected in either plasma or 
ocular tissues after administration when the absorbance of the eluate was 
monitored at 520 nm. This finding indicates that intact forms of ACs were 
present in rats after administration of BCA. In rats given i.p. administration, 
the concentration of total ACs in the whole eye and some ocular tissues was 
higher than that measured in plasma. These results suggested that ACs detected 
in the ocular tissues were not due to residual blood. Following i.v. 
administration in rabbits, four ACs were identified in the plasma and several 
ocular tissues including the aqueous humor, cornea, sclera, choroid, ciliary 
body, iris and retina. A small amount of ACs was also detected in the vitreous 
and lens. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that BCAs were absorbed and 
distributed in ocular tissues as intact forms. Our data show clearly that intact 
forms of BCAs pass thorough the blood-aqueous barrier and blood-retinal barrier 
in both rats and rabbits.

Finland. pirjo.mattila@mtt.fi

A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with diode-array 
detection (DAD) was used to identify and quantify free and total phenolic acids 
(m-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, gallic acid, 
vanillic acid, syringic acid, o-coumaric acid, m-coumaric acid, p-coumaric acid, 
caffeic acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, chlorogenic acid, and ellagic acid) in 
plant foods. Free phenolic acids were extracted with a mixture of methanol and 
10% acetic acid. Bound phenolic acids were liberated using first alkaline and 
then acid hydrolysis followed by extraction with diethyl ether/ethyl acetate 
(1:1). All fractions were quantified separately by HPLC. After HPLC 
quantification, results of alkali and acid hydrolysates were calculated to 
represent total phenolic acids. Ellagic acid was quantified separately after 
long (20 h) acid hydrolysis. The methods developed were effective for the 
determination of phenolic acids in plant foods. DAD response was linear for all 
phenolic acids within the ranges evaluated, with correlation coefficients 
exceeding 0.999. Coefficients of variation for 4-8 sample replicates were 
consistently below 10%. Recovery tests of phenolic acids were performed for 
every hydrolysis condition using several samples. Recoveries were generally good 
(mean >90%) with the exceptions of gallic acid and, in some cases, caffeic acid 
samples.

The contents of free and total phenolic acids and alk(en)ylresorcinols were 
analyzed in commercial products of eight grains: oat (Avena sativa), wheat 
(Triticum spp.), rye (Secale cerale), barley (Hordeum vulgare), buckwheat 
(Fagopyrum esculentum), millet (Panicum miliaceum), rice (Oryza sativa), and 
corn (Zea mays). Avenanthramides were determined in three oat products. Free 
phenolic acids, alk(en)ylresorcinols, and avenanthramides were extracted with 
methanolic acetic acid, 100% methanol, and 80% methanol, respectively, and 
quantified by HPLC. The contents of total phenolic acids were quantified by HPLC 
analysis after alkaline and acid hydrolyses. The highest contents of total 
phenolic acids were in brans of wheat (4527 mg/kg) and rye (4190 mg/kg) and in 
whole-grain flours of these grains (1342 and 1366 mg/kg, respectively). In other 
products, the contents varied from 111 mg/kg (white wheat bread) to 765 mg/kg 
(whole-grain rye bread). Common phenolic acids found in the grain products were 
ferulic acid (most abundant), ferulic acid dehydrodimers, sinapic acid, and 
p-coumaric acid. The grain products were found to contain either none or only 
low amounts of free phenolic acids. The content of avenanthramides in oat flakes 
(26-27 mg/kg) was about double that found in oat bran (13 mg/kg). The highest 
contents of alk(en)ylresorcinols were observed in brans of rye (4108 mg/kg) and 
wheat (3225 mg/kg). In addition, whole-grain rye products (rye bread, rye flour, 
and whole-wheat flour) contained considerable levels of alk(en)ylresorcinols 
(524, 927, and 759 mg/kg, respectively).

European cereal-based fermented foods (ECBFFs) and alcoholic beverages have been 
fundamental components of regional diets for centuries, providing unique flavor 
profiles, essential nutrients, and a diverse array of health benefits. These 
foods, which encompass breads, beverages, and porridges, derive their functional 
and culinary properties from the activity of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts. 
This review examines the nutritional and functional characteristics of ECBFFs, 
with a focus on their microbial composition and fermentation processes. It 
highlights various ECBFFs and alcoholic beverages, including conventional and 
sourdough breads, tarhana, boza, kvass, and beers examining their 
health-promoting properties and potential for commercial expansion. Key findings 
from the literature show that certain ECBFFs are abundant in prebiotics and 
probiotics, primarily due to the fermentation processes involving lactic acid 
bacteria and yeasts. These microorganisms generate bioactive compounds such as 
organic acids, bacteriocins, and phenolic compounds, which exhibit 
antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. ECBFFs can also 
enhance digestibility, improve mineral bioavailability, and support gut health, 
thereby promoting overall well-being. From a commercial perspective, products 
like Yosa and Proviva demonstrate the feasibility of developing innovative 
ECBFFs that align with contemporary dietary preferences. The future of ECBFFs is 
promising, offering extensive opportunities for research, innovation, and 
large-scale commercialization to meet the increasing consumer demand for 
functional, plant-based foods.

Total phenolic compounds (TPC) and the chlorogenic acids content of potato 
by-product extracts of two hydro alcoholic solvents (methanol, ethanol) and two 
extraction methods (maceration and heating-assisted extraction) were studied. 
The content of TPC in the extracts was determined spectrometrically according to 
the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure and calculated as chlorogenic acid equivalents. 
Soluble phenolic acids, especially the chlorogenic acids, were performed by 
HPLC. The antioxidant activity of potato by-product extracts was determined by 
using the total oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. The highest 
content of TPC was found in raw and lyophilized red waters when using ethanol as 
a solvent around 57 mg/g fresh weight. Heating-assisted extraction enhances this 
quantitative increasing. At the given operating conditions, unpeeled potato 
samples exhibit a higher TPC than peeled ones, showing that TPC are accumulated 
in skin tissue. The greatest amount of chlorogenic acid (Caffeoyl-Quinic Acids, 
3, 4, 5 CQA), mainly the 5-CQA (870 ± 39.66 µg/g WM for wet matter versus DM dry 
matter), was obtained in the pellets and lyophilized fresh peels (skin vs. 
flesh). In addition, the greatest amounts of chlorogenic acids were found when 
potato peels were extracted with methanol. Heating-assisted extraction improved 
the chlorogenic acid concentration of the potato peel extracts. The total ORAC 
amounts recorded in the different potato fractions varied between 1500 and 1650 
µM TE/g. They were higher than those of some fruits, vegetables, nuts, cereals, 
and sweet potato cultivar. The good correlation coefficient found between TPC, 
chlorogenic acids determination, and the ORAC capacity indicates that the TPC 
can be used as a good indicator of the antioxidant capacity of potato 
by-products.

Flavonoids continue to attract wide attention as possible very useful agents for 
combating free radical pathologies, i.e. the pathological states associated with 
free radical overproduction. Commonly used methods for the analysis of plant 
flavonoids include high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary 
electrophoresis (CE). On the other hand, the soft-ionization approach based on 
electrospray ionization (ESI-MS) permits highly selective analysis of complex 
matrices. In this work, we examined firstly the ESI-MS behaviour of 
representative aglycones and glycosides of flavonols, flavones and isoflavones 
with the aim of suggesting a possible relationship between structure and mass 
spectra. Using HPLC coupled to a diode array detector (DAD) for on-line UV 
spectra acquisition, and in parallel to ESI-MS for mass spectra (LC/DAD-ESI-MS), 
we have developed methodology to observe flavonols directly in tomato puree 
extract. In this way, it has been possible to detect intact flavonol glycosides 
in tomato extracts and to characterize a flavonol trisaccharide. For the first 
time, using LC/ESI-MS, it has been possible to detect intact flavonol glycosides 
in plasma of healthy volunteers and to provide further evidence on the 
absorption of flavonoid glycosides after consumption of common vegetables like 
tomatoes.

We present a method for the quantitative determination of the phytoestrogens 
formononetin, biochanin A, daidzein, genistein, and coumestrol and 
simultaneously the lignans secoisolariciresinol (SECO) and matairesinol in 
plant-derived foods. These compounds are measured by isotope dilution gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring mode 
(ID/GC/MS/SIM) using synthesized deuterated internal standards for the 
correction of losses during the procedure. A three-step hydrolysis--a 
rehydration with distilled H2O, followed by enzymatic and acid hydrolysis--has 
been applied in order to convert the diphenolic glycosides into their respective 
aglycones. Purification and separation are carried out in two ion-exchange 
chromatographic steps followed by derivatization and GC-MS. The within-assay 
imprecision values vary 3.1-9.6% and the between-assay imprecision 7.0-21.2%. 
The mean recovery of authentic standards processed through the whole procedure 
varied from 95.5 to 105.5%. Values for some different food samples are 
presented. The simultaneous determination of the biologically most interesting 
phytoestrogens and lignans in foods has not been carried out previously and the 
method will be useful for screening of important foods in populations with 
different risk of cancer and coronary heart disease, and for metabolic studies.

Tea is a beverage consumed widely throughout the world. The existence in tea of 
chemopreventing compounds possessing antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic and 
antioxidative properties has been reported. High intakes of tea and foods 
containing flavonoids have recently been shown to be negatively correlated to 
the occurrence of CHD. However, tea may contain other compounds with similar 
activities. Using a new gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method we 
measured lignans and isoflavonoids in samples of twenty commercial teas (black, 
green and red varieties) and, for comparison, six coffees. Both unbrewed and 
brewed tea were investigated. The analysis of the teas yielded relatively high 
levels of the lignans secoisolariciresinol (5.6-28.9 mg/kg; 15.9-81.9 mumol/kg) 
and matairesinol (0.56-4.13 mg/kg; 1.6-11.5 mumol/kg) but only low levels of 
isoflavonoids. Because the plant lignans, as well as their mammalian metabolites 
enterolactone and enterodiol, have antioxidative properties and these mammalian 
lignans occur in high concentrations in plasma, we hypothesize that lignan 
polyphenols may contribute to the protective effect of tea on CHD.

Gradient reversed-phase HPLC was used to obtain quantitative estimates of the 
levels of free and conjugated myricetin and quercetin in 65 red wines from 
Italy, Chile, France, California, Australia, Bulgaria, Spain, Romania, New 
Zealand, Brazil, Morocco, and Hungary. The concentrations of total flavonols 
ranged from 4.6 to 41.6 mg L(-1). High total flavonol levels appear to be 
associated with the use of thick-skinned grape varieties, such as Cabernet 
Sauvignon, with a high skin:volume ratio, which were left to ripen fully in 
sunny conditions before harvest and which were extracted efficiently by modern 
methods of vinification. Some Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon wines contained up to 
40 mg of total flavonols L(-1), which was higher than the levels detected in 
Cabernet Sauvignon from France, California, and Australia. The flavonol content 
of 1989 and 1990 Cabernet Sauvignon from Bulgaria was <6 mg L(-1). Chilean 
Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Pinot Noir all contained consistently higher 
concentrations of flavonols than their counterparts from different geographical 
regions.

Aims. To assess the possible effect of polyphenol-rich olive extracts on lipid 
metabolism in medaka fish by quantifying the expression of lipogenic and 
lipolytic genes. Materials and methods. Adult medaka fish were maintained in 
tanks for five days with five extracts at 0.01% in water, causing obesity 
through a diet rich in carbohydrates, with a control group maintained in water 
with a normal diet. The extracts contained polyphenols ranging between 7 and 116 
mg/g (oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol) with an antioxidant power of 2-13 mmol of 
2,4,6-tri(2-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine/100 g. After five days, the fish were 
sacrificed and the hepatic mRNA and its complementary DNA were extracted by 
reverse transcription. Complementary DNAs were quantified for three lipolytic 
and three lipogenic genes by real-time PCR. The relative gene expression was 
calculated from the amplification curves in reference to the control group. 
Results. The expression of genes involved in lipolysis, including peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor-±, acyl-CoA oxidase 1, and carnitine 
palmitoyltransferase 1, were clearly decreased in fish subjected to an 
obesogenic diet, and this situation could not be reversed in fish maintained 
with polyphenol-rich extracts. In contrast, lipogenic fatty acid synthase, 
acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 genes 
increased considerably with the obesogenic diet and reverted to the normal state 
with the olive extracts. The effect was not dependent on the total polyphenol 
content, the specific oleuropein or hydroxytyrosol concentration, or the 
antioxidant power, suggesting a synergistic effect. Conclusion. Olive 
polyphenols, acting as anti-lipogenic agents, have a positive effect on lipid 
metabolism, but their mechanism in each gene is different according to the 
extract, which supports synergistic mechanisms with the different proportions of 
polyphenols and accompanying phytochemicals in each extract.

Anthocyanins, the red/blue pigments found in plants, are polyphenolic compounds 
consumed by humans and are part of a normal diet. Recent studies have shown that 
anthocyanins have substantial bioactivity including antioxidant activity and 
therefore may have beneficial effects on human health. Anthocyanins are a group 
of over 500 compounds of diverse structures containing different core phenolic 
aglycons and conjugated with sugars in a variety of glycosylation patterns. In 
this study, we have investigated the bioabsorption of 15 anthocyanins with 
structures containing different aglycons and conjugated sugars extracted from 
blueberry, boysenberry, black raspberry, and blackcurrant in both humans and 
rats. Intact and unmetabolized anthocyanins were detected in urine of rats and 
humans following dosing for all molecular structures investigated, thus 
demonstrating that anthocyanins with diverse molecular structure and from 
different dietary sources are bioavailable at diet relevant dosage rates. In 
addition, the relative concentrations of anthocyanins detected in urine 
following dosing varied, indicating that differences in bioavailability are due 
to variations in chemical structure. Our results suggest that the nature of the 
sugar conjugate and the phenolic aglycon are both important determinants of 
anthocyanin absorption and excretion in rats and humans.

An accurate quantification of phenolic compounds present in several kind of 
craft beers, corresponding worts, ingredients and spent products was performed 
by LC-MS/MS in this study. The dilution 1:2 of the sample with the mobile phase 
gave the best results, offering a very fast and simple method to reduce the 
matrix effect. A validated method was applied to six different types of craft 
beers, their worts, starting and spent products, such as barley malts and barley 
husks, starting hops and spent hops, and finally, starting yeast and spent 
yeasts to quantify the selected phenolic compounds. The Total Phenol Content 
(TPC) of barley malts is not negligible and it results almost prevalently due to 
trans-p-coumaric acid, which ranges from 76.4 μg/Kg for Mais to 672.6 μg/Kg for 
Munich. The trans-p-coumaric acid is transferred to the worts during the must 
preparation and is responsible for the not negligible TPC of worts, that was 
between 131.1 μg/Kg for Ego to 2041.6 μg/Kg for Alter beer. Bitter acids and 
prenylflavonoids are mainly present in the starting hops (TPC 323.8 μg/Kg and 
TPC 500.3 for Saaz and Perle hops, respectively). Their concentration strongly 
decreases in the spent hops where the TPC ranges between 8.0 μg/Kg for Triplo 
Malto to 24.4 μg/Kg for Alter, suggesting that they are transferred to the 
intermediate of production. Phenolic compounds, originally present in the 
starting barley malts and hops, are limitedly present into the final beers, and 
their TPC ranges approximately from 65.6 μg/Kg for Fiat lux to 105.3 μg/Kg for 
Alter. Actually, most phenolic compounds are absorbed into the yeast added for 
the fermentation, as it is clearly evident from the observation that spent 
yeasts contain a higher phenolic compounds amount with the respect to the 
starting yeast, and several phenolic compounds, in particular those coming from 
hops, are originally absent into the yeast and are only present in the spent 
ones.

The antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. In 
vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal 
action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in 
general against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, olive oils 
showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal 
microbiota (Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli) also against 
beneficial microorganisms such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium 
bifidum. Otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (Listeria 
monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia sp., and 
Shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. The 
dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, 
hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the phenolic compounds that statistically 
correlated with bacterial survival. These findings were confirmed by testing 
each individual phenolic compound, isolated by HPLC, against L. monocytogenes. 
In particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon 
showed a potent antimicrobial activity. These results indicate that not all oils 
classified as ""olive oil"" had similar bactericidal effects and that this 
bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.

The possible beneficial effects of tea consumption have attracted a great deal 
of attention. Many of the biological effects have been attributed to tea 
catechins, but the metabolic fate of these compounds is not clear. In the 
present study, a major metabolite observed in human blood and urine samples 
after green tea administration was identified as a O-methylated derivative of 
(-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) by comparison with products from chemical and 
enzymatic O-methylation of EGC. The structure of this metabolite was elucidated 
as 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epigallocatechin (4'-O-MeEGC) by (1)H and (13)C NMR and 
heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity experiment. The human plasma level of 
4'-O-MeEGC reached its peak value within the first 2 h following tea ingestion. 
Its maximum concentration was 4 to 6 times higher than that of EGC. The 
half-lives of EGC and 4'-O-MeEGC in the blood were 1.02 +/- 0.07 and 4.39 +/- 
1.14 h, respectively. The amount of 4'-O-MeEGC excreted in urine was about 3 
times higher than that of EGC, and 88% of 4'-O-MeEGC was excreted in urine 
within 8 h. The present structural information and concentration-time profile of 
this metabolite provide the basis for understanding the biotransformation of EGC 
and for future elucidation of its biological activities.

(-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant tea catechin, has been 
proposed to be beneficial to human health based on its strong antioxidative and 
other biological activities in vitro. Inadequate knowledge regarding the 
bioavailability and biotransformation of EGCG in humans, however, has limited 
our understanding of its possible beneficial health effects. In this study, 
4',4' '-di-O-methyl-EGCG (4',4' '-DiMeEGCG) was detected in human plasma and 
urine by LC/MS/MS following green tea ingestion. Both 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and EGCG 
reached peak plasma values (20.5 +/- 7.7 and 145.4 +/- 31.6 nM, respectively, in 
4 subjects) at 2 h after the dose. The half-lives of 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and EGCG 
were 4.1 +/- 0.8 and 2.7 +/- 0.9 h, respectively. The cumulative urinary 
excretion of 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG during a 24 h period was 140.3 +/- 48.6 microg, 
about 5-fold higher than that of EGCG, but the excreted 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and 
EGCG in urine only accounted for about 0.1% of ingested EGCG. 
(-)-5-(3',4',5'-Trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4) and 
(-)-5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6), along with another 
possible ring-fission metabolite, 
(-)-5-(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6'), were detected in human 
urine after green tea ingestion. The cumulative excretion of M4, M6', and M6 
during a 24 h period ranged from 75 microg to 1.2 mg, 0.6 to 6 mg, and 0.6 to 10 
mg, respectively. The combined excretion of all three ring-fission metabolites 
accounted for 1.5-16% of ingested catechins. M4, M6', and M6 were all observed 
after the ingestion of pure EGCG or EGC by human subjects, whereas only M6 was 
produced after EC ingestion. These metabolites as well as monomethylated EGCG 
were detected in mice and rats after tea or EGCG administration, and the tissue 
levels reflected the rather low bioavailability of EGCG in rats. The presently 
characterized methylated EGCG metabolites and ring-fission products exist in 
substantial quantities and may contribute to the biological activities of tea.

The present study investigates the bioavailability of resveratrol and quercetin 
in humans, mice, and rats after oral ingestion of grape juice preparations or 
pure aglycones. Oral administration of resveratrol and quercetin to humans 
yielded detectable levels of resveratrol, quercetin, and their derivatives in 
the plasma and urine. Urinary levels of resveratrol, quercetin, and their 
metabolites were observed in human subjects receiving 600 and 1200 mL of grape 
juice, whereas quercetin metabolites were identified in urine samples even after 
receiving 200 mL of grape juice. The cumulative amounts of resveratrol and 
quercetin excreted in the urine of mice receiving concentrated grape juice for 4 
days were 2.3 and 0.7% of the ingested doses, respectively. After i.g. 
administration of resveratrol to rats (2 mg/kg), up to 1.2 microM resveratrol 
was observed in the plasma. The study demonstrates that the glycoside forms of 
resveratrol and quercetin in grape juice are absorbed to a lesser extent than 
the aglycones.

Estimation of dietary intake of polyphenols is difficult, due to limited 
availability of food composition data and bias inherent to dietary assessment 
methods. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the associations between 
the intake of polyphenol-rich foods and the urinary excretion of several 
phenolic compounds and therefore explore whether these phenolic compounds could 
be used as a biomarker of intake. Fifty-three participants of the SU.VI.MAX 
study (a randomised primary-prevention trial evaluating the effect of daily 
antioxidant supplementation on chronic diseases) collected a 24 h urine and a 
spot urine sample and filled a dietary record during a 2 d period. Thirteen 
polyphenols and metabolites, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, m-coumaric acid, 
gallic acid, 4-O-methylgallic acid, quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, 
hesperetin, naringenin, phloretin, enterolactone and enterodiol, were measured 
using HPLC-electrospray ionisation-MS-MS. In spot samples apple consumption was 
positively correlated to phloretin, grapefruit consumption to naringenin, orange 
to hesperetin, citrus fruit consumption to both naringenin and hesperetin, with 
r coefficients ranging from 0.31 to 0.57 (P < 0.05). The combination of fruits 
and/or fruit juices was positively correlated to gallic acid and 
4-O-methylgallic acid, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, hesperetin, naringenin and 
phloretin (r 0.24-0.44, P < 0.05). Coffee consumption was positively correlated 
to caffeic and chlorogenic acids (r 0.29 and 0.63, P < 0.05 respectively). Black 
tea and wine consumption were positively correlated with gallic and 
4-O-methylgallic acids (r 0.37-0.54, P < 0.001). The present results suggest 
that several polyphenols measured in a spot urine sample can be used as 
biomarkers of polyphenol-rich food intake.

OBJECTIVE: Estimation of dietary intake of polyphenols is difficult, due to 
limited availability of food composition data and bias inherent to dietary 
assessment methods. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether we 
could detect polyphenols and their metabolites in a spot urine sample in a 
free-living human population and whether it was related to those observed in 
24-h urine samples, for potential use as a biomarkers of polyphenol intake.
SUBJECTS: Four 24-h urine samples and two spot urine samples were collected from 
154 participants of the SU.VI.MAX cohort (a randomized primary-prevention trial 
evaluating the effect of daily antioxidant supplementation on chronic diseases) 
in two separate studies over, respectively, a 7- and 2-day periods. Thirteen 
polyphenols and metabolites (chlorogenic acid (CGA), caffeic acid (CA), 
m-coumaric acid (mCOU), gallic acid (GA), 4-O-methylgallic acid (MeGA), 
quercetin (Q), isorhamnetin (MeQ), kaempferol (K), hesperetin (HESP), naringenin 
(NAR), phloretin (PHLOR), enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) were measured 
using HPLC-ESI-MS-MS.
RESULTS: Correlations between the urinary excretion levels were observed. The 
most significant were explained by metabolic filiations (CGA/CA, CA/mCOU, 
GA/MeGA, Q/MeQ, NAR/PHLOR, ENL/END) or co-occurrence in a same food source 
(NAR/HESP). Concentrations in spot samples correlated with those in 24-h urine 
sample (P<0.02, except for CA and for MeQ). Intra-individual variations were 
smaller than inter-individual variations for all polyphenols (P<0.01) except for 
MeGA and for PHLOR.
CONCLUSION: These results show that these polyphenols and metabolites are useful 
biomarkers for polyphenol intake.

The intake of polyphenols has been demonstrated to have health-promoting and 
disease-preventive effects. The pomegranate (Punica granatum L.), which is rich 
in several polyphenols, has been used for centuries in ancient cultures for its 
medicinal purposes. The potential health benefits of pomegranate polyphenols 
have been demonstrated in numerous in vitro studies and in vivo experiments. 
This study investigated the absorption and antioxidant effects of a standardized 
extract from pomegranate in healthy human volunteers after the acute consumption 
of 800 mg of extract. Results indicate that ellagic acid (EA) from the extract 
is bioavailable, with an observed C(max) of 33 ng/mL at t(max) of 1 h. The 
plasma metabolites urolithin A, urolithin B, hydroxyl-urolithin A, urolithin 
A-glucuronide, and dimethyl ellagic acid-glucuronide were identified by HPLC-MS. 
The antioxidant capacity measured with the oxygen radical absorbance capacity 
(ORAC) assay was increased with a maximum effect of 32% after 0.5 h, whereas the 
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was not affected. The inflammation 
marker interleukin-6 (IL-6) was not significantly affected after 4 h after the 
consumption of the extract. Overall, this study demonstrated the absorbability 
of EA from a pomegranate extract high in ellagitannin content and its ex vivo 
antioxidant effects.

Studies were conducted on the flavonoids (myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, 
luteolin, and apigenin) contents of 62 edible tropical plants. The highest total 
flavonoids content was in onion leaves (1497.5 mg/kg quercetin, 391.0 mg/kg 
luteolin, and 832.0 mg/kg kaempferol), followed by Semambu leaves (2041.0 
mg/kg), bird chili (1663.0 mg/kg), black tea (1491.0 mg/kg), papaya shoots 
(1264.0 mg/kg), and guava (1128.5 mg/kg). The major flavonoid in these plant 
extracts is quercetin, followed by myricetin and kaempferol. Luteolin could be 
detected only in broccoli (74.5 mg/kg dry weight), green chili (33.0 mg/kg), 
bird chili (1035.0 mg/kg), onion leaves (391.0 mg/kg), belimbi fruit (202.0 
mg/kg), belimbi leaves (464.5 mg/kg), French bean (11.0 mg/kg), carrot (37.5 
mg/kg), white radish (9.0 mg/kg), local celery (80.5 mg/kg), limau purut leaves 
(30.5 mg/kg), and dried asam gelugur (107.5 mg/kg). Apigenin was found only in 
Chinese cabbage (187.0 mg/kg), bell pepper (272.0 mg/kg), garlic (217.0 mg/kg), 
belimbi fruit (458.0 mg/kg), French peas (176.0 mg/kg), snake gourd (42.4 
mg/kg), guava (579.0 mg/kg), wolfberry leaves (547.0 mg/kg), local celery (338.5 
mg/kg), daun turi (39.5 mg/kg), and kadok (34.5 mg/kg). In vegetables, quercetin 
glycosides predominate, but glycosides of kaempferol, luteolin, and apigenin are 
also present. Fruits contain almost exclusively quercetin glycosides, whereas 
kaempferol and myricetin glycosides are found only in trace quantities.

Effects of different cooking methods on nutritional and physicochemical 
characteristics of selected vegetables.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of three common 
cooking practices (i.e., boiling, steaming, and frying) on phytochemical 
contents (i.e., polyphenols, carotenoids, glucosinolates, and ascorbic acid), 
total antioxidant capacities (TAC), as measured by three different analytical 
assays [Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), total radical-trapping 
antioxidant parameter (TRAP), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)] and 
physicochemical parameters of three vegetables (carrots, courgettes, and 
broccoli). Water-cooking treatments better preserved the antioxidant compounds, 
particularly carotenoids, in all vegetables analyzed and ascorbic acid in 
carrots and courgettes. Steamed vegetables maintained a better texture quality 
than boiled ones, whereas boiled vegetables showed limited discoloration. Fried 
vegetables showed the lowest degree of softening, even though antioxidant 
compounds were less retained. An overall increase of TEAC, FRAP, and TRAP values 
was observed in all cooked vegetables, probably because of matrix softening and 
increased extractability of compounds, which could be partially converted into 
more antioxidant chemical species. Our findings defy the notion that processed 
vegetables offer lower nutritional quality and also suggest that for each 
vegetable a cooking method would be preferred to preserve the nutritional and 
physicochemical qualities.

Flavonoids and related plant compounds in fruits and vegetables are of 
particular importance as they have been found to possess antioxidant and free 
radical scavenging activity. The HPLC-based quantitative procedure, with 
improved extraction and hydrolysis, was used to analyze the content of the 
flavonols quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol in 10 black currant cultivars 
from organic farms and in 5 cultivars from conventional farms. Myricetin was the 
most abundant flavonol, and its amount varied significantly among cultivars, 
from 8.9 to 24.5 mg x 100 g(-1) (fresh weight). The quercetin levels in black 
currant also varied widely among the cultivars, from 5.2 to 12.2 mg x 100 g(-1). 
The kaempferol levels in black currant cultivars were low, ranging from 0.9 to 
2.3 mg x 100 g(-1). The sum of these major flavonols varied widely among black 
currant cultivars. No consistent differences in the contents of flavonols were 
found between the same black currant cultivars grown in organic and conventional 
ways. The high variability in the levels of flavonols in different cultivars 
offers possible avenues for identifying and selecting cultivars rich in certain 
flavonols for the special production of berries for industrial use.

Considerable epidemiological evidence suggests a link between the consumption of 
diets rich in fruits and vegetables and a decreased risk of cardiovascular 
disease and cancers. Anthocyanins have received attention as important dietary 
constituents that may provide health benefits and contribute antioxidant 
capacity beyond that provided by essential micronutrients such as ascorbate, 
tocopherols, and selenium. The emergence of renewed interest by industrial 
countries in traditional herbal medicines and the development of 'functional 
foods' are stimulating the need for more information regarding the 
bioavailability and efficacy of plant polyphenols. Flavonoids represent a 
numerous group of secondary plant metabolites based on the structure of a pyran 
ring flanked by two or more phenyl rings and varying subtly in the degree of 
unsaturation and the pattern of hydroxylation or methylation. Flavonoids also 
vary in the type of sugar attached or the degree of polymerization. 
Anthocyanins, potent flavonoid antioxidants widely distributed in fruits, 
vegetables and red wines, normally occur in nature as glycosides, a form not 
usually considered as bioavailable. We have examined the bioavailability and 
pharmacokinetics of anthocyanins in humans. Anthocyanins were detected as 
glycosides in both plasma and urine samples. The elimination of plasma 
anthocyanins appeared to follow first-order kinetics and most anthocyanin 
compounds were excreted in urine within 4 h after feeding. The current findings 
appear to refute assumptions that anthocyanins are not absorbed in their 
unchanged glycosylated forms in humans.

Limited information is available concerning the qualitative and quantitative 
composition of polyphenolic compounds, especially flavonoids, in almonds. We 
determined total phenols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids in California almond 
(Prunus dulcis) skins and kernels among the principal almond varieties (Butte, 
Carmel, Fritz, Mission, Monterey, Nonpareil, Padre, and Price) with 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/electrochemical detection and UV 
detection. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry under identical HPLC 
conditions was utilized to verify identities of the predominant flavonoids and 
phenolic acids. Total phenols ranged from 127 (Fritz) to 241 (Padre) mg gallic 
acid equivalents/100 g of fresh weight. The analyses were compiled to produce a 
data set of 18 flavonoids and three phenolic acids. The predominant flavonoids 
were isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside and isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside (in 
combination), catechin, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, epicatechin, 
quercetin-3-O-galactoside, and isorhamnetin-3-O-galactoside at 16.81, 1.93, 
1.17, 0.85, 0.83, and 0.50 mg/100 g of fresh weight almonds, respectively. Using 
the existing approach of calculating only the aglycone form of flavonoids for 
use in the U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrient database, whole almonds would 
provide the most prevalent aglycones of isorhamnetin at 11.70 (3.32), kaempferol 
at 0.60 (0.17), catechin at 1.93 (0.55), quercetin at 0.72 (0.20), and 
epicatechin at 0.85 (0.24) mg/100 g of fresh weight (mg/oz serving), 
respectively. These data can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of 
action underlying the relationship between almond consumption and health-related 
outcomes and provide values for whole and blanched almonds suitable for 
inclusion in nutrient databases.

In the United States, commercially available foods, including cocoa and 
chocolate, are being marketed with statements referring to the level of 
antioxidant activity and polyphenols. For cocoa-containing foods, there has been 
no comprehensive survey of the content of these and other chemistries. A survey 
of cocoa and chocolate-containing products marketed in the United States was 
conducted to determine antioxidant activity and polyphenol and procyanidin 
contents. Commercially available samples consisted of the top market share 
products in each of the following six categories: natural cocoa, unsweetened 
baking chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet baking chips, milk chocolate, and 
chocolate syrup. Composite samples were characterized using four different 
methods: oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), vitamin C equivalence 
antioxidant capacity (VCEAC), total polyphenols, and procyanidins. All composite 
lots were further characterized for percent nonfat cocoa solids (NFCS) and 
percent fat. Natural cocoas had the highest levels of antioxidant activities, 
total polyphenols, and procyanidins followed by baking chocolates, dark 
chocolates and baking chips, and finally milk chocolate and syrups. The results 
showed a strong linear correlation between NFCS and ORAC (R (2) = 0.9849), total 
polyphenols (R (2) = 0.9793), and procyanidins (R (2) = 0.946), respectively. On 
the basis of principal component analysis, 81.4% of the sample set was 
associated with NFCS, antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, and procyanidins. 
The results indicated that, regardless of the product category, NFCS were the 
primary factor contributing to the level of cocoa antioxidants in the products 
tested. Results further suggested that differences in cocoa bean blends and 
processing, with the possible exception of Dutching, are minor factors in 
determining the level of antioxidants in commercially available cocoa-containing 
products in the United States.

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and red wine (RW) are two basic elements that form 
part of the so-called Mediterranean diet. Both stand out because of their high 
phenolic compound content and their potential related health benefits. The 
present study is focused on the metabolic disposition of resveratrol (RESV), 
tyrosol (TYR), and hydroxytyrosol (HT) following the consumption of EVOO, RW, 
and a combination of both. In this study, 12 healthy volunteers consumed a 
single dose of 25 mL of EVOO, 150 mL of RW, and a combination of both in a 
crossover randomized clinical trial. Urinary recovery of RESV, TYR, and HT was 
analysed in urine samples collected over a 6-h period following the intake of 
each treatment. Higher HT levels were observed following EVOO compared to RW 
(3788 ± 1751 nmols and 2308 ± 847 nmols respectively). After the combination of 
EVOO and RW, the recovery of TYR and HT metabolites increased statistically 
compared to their separate consumption (4925 ± 1751 nmols of TYR and 6286 ± 3198 
nmols of HT). EVOO triggered an increase in glucuronide conjugates, while RW 
intake raised sulfate metabolites. Marginal effects were observed in RESV 
increased bioavailability after the combination of RW with the fat matrix 
provided by EVOO.

Determination of daidzein and genistein in soybean foods by automated on-line 
in-tube solid-phase microextraction coupled to high-performance liquid 
chromatography.

An automated on-line method for the determination of the isoflavones, daidzein 
and genistein, was developed using in-tube solid-phase microextraction coupled 
to high-performance liquid chromatography (in-tube SPME-HPLC). In-tube SPME is a 
new extraction technique for organic compounds in aqueous samples, in which 
analytes are extracted from the sample directly into an open tubular capillary 
by repeated draw/eject cycles of sample solution. Daidzein, genistein and their 
glucosides tested in this study were clearly separated within 8 min by HPLC 
using an XDB-C8 column with diode array detection. In order to optimize the 
extraction of these compounds, several in-tube SPME parameters were examined. 
The glucosides daidzin and genistin were analyzed as aglycones after hydrolysis 
because the glucosides were not concentrated by in-tube SPME. The optimum 
extraction conditions for daidzein and genistein were obtained with 20 
draw/eject cycles of 40 microl of sample using a Supel-Q porous layer open 
tubular capillary column. The extracted compounds were easily desorbed from the 
capillary by mobile phase flow, and carryover was not observed. Using the 
in-tube SPME-HPLC method, the calibration curves of these compounds were linear 
in the range 5-200 ng/ml, with a correlation coefficient above 0.9999 (n = 18), 
and the detection limits (S/N = 3) were 0.4-0.5 ng/ml. This method was 
successfully applied to the analysis of soybean foods without interference 
peaks. The recoveries of aglycones and glucosides spiked into food samples were 
above 97%.

Eriocitrin, a flavonoid glycoside present in lemon fruit, is metabolized in vivo 
to a series of eriodictyol, methylated eriodictyol, 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic 
acid, and their conjugates. Plasma antioxidant activity increased following oral 
administration of aqueous eriocitrin solutions to rats. Eriocitrin metabolites 
were found in plasma and renal excreted urine through HPLC and LC-MS analyses. 
Eriocitrin was not detected in plasma and urine, but eriodictyol, 
homoeriodictyol, and hesperetin in their conjugated forms were detected in 
plasma of 4.0 h following administration of eriocitrin. In urine for 24 h, both 
nonconjugates and conjugates of these metabolites were detected. 
3,4-Dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, which is metabolized from eriodictyol by 
intestinal bacteria, was detected in slight amounts with each form in 4.0-h 
plasma and 24-h urine. Eriocitrin was suggested to be metabolized by intestinal 
bacteria, and then eriodictyol and 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic of its metabolite 
were absorbed. Following administration of eriocitrin, plasma exhibited an 
elevated resistance effect to lipid peroxidation. Eriocitrin metabolites 
functioning as antioxidant agents are discussed.

An HPLC method was developed and validated for the quantification of sesaminol 
triglucoside and a sesaminol diglucoside in sesame seeds. These two lignans were 
isolated, and their structures were characterized by mass and nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy. Defatted sesame flour was extracted first with 85% 
ethanol for 5 h followed by 70% ethanol for 10 h at room temperature using 
naringenin as internal standard. Analysis of 65 different samples of sesame 
seeds indicated that the content of sesaminol triglucoside ranged from 36 to 
1560 mg/100 g of seed (mean 637 +/- 312) and that of sesaminol diglucoside 
ranged from 0 to 493 mg/100 g of seed (mean 75 +/- 95). No significant 
difference was found between sesaminol glucoside contents in black and white 
seeds.

A new lignan glucoside was isolated from defatted sesame seed flour and its 
structure was established as sesamolinol diglucoside 
[2-(3-methoxy-4-(O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl 
(1-->6)-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside)phenoxyl)-6-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-cis-3,7-dioxabicyclo-(3.3.0)-octane] 
by mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A quantitative analysis of 
65 sesame seed samples showed that this sesamolinol diglucoside ranged from <5 
to 232 mg/100 g of seeds (98+/-57 mg/100 g) with no difference between white and 
black sesame seeds.

The monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric flavan-3-ol composition of wines, grape 
seeds, and skins from Vitis vinifera L. cv. Graciano, Tempranillo, and Cabernet 
Sauvignon has been studied using (1) fractionation by polyamide column 
chromatography followed by HPLC/ESI-MS analysis, (2) fractionation on C(18) 
Sep-Pak cartridges followed by reaction with vanillin and acid-catalyzed 
degradation in the presence of toluene-alpha-thiol (thiolysis). The content of 
monomers ((+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin), procyanidin dimers (B3, B1, B4, and 
B2), trimers (T2 and C1), and dimer gallates (B2-3-O-gallate, B2-3'-O-gallate, 
and B1-3-O-gallate) ranged from 76.93 to 133.18 mg/L in wines, from 2.30 to 8.21 
mg/g in grape seeds, and from 0.14 to 0.38 mg/g in grape skins. In wines, the 
polymeric fraction represented 77-84% of total flavan-3-ols and showed a mean 
degree of polymerization (mDP) value of 6.3-13.0. In grapes, the polymeric 
fraction represented 75-81% of total flavan-3-ols in seeds and 94-98% in skins 
and showed mDP values of 6.4-7.3 in seeds and 33.8-85.7 in skins. All the 
monomeric flavan-3-ols and oligomeric procyanidins found in wines were also 
present in seeds, although differences in their relative abundances were seen. 
The skin polymeric proanthocyanidins participated in the equilibration of the 
wine polymeric proanthocyanidin fraction, especially contributing to the polymer 
subunit composition and mDP.

Physicochemical parameters, microbial diversity using sequencing and amplicon, 
and metabolite concentrations from Ginger Bug and Ginger Beer were 
characterized. Furthermore, the sensory aspects of the beverage were determined. 
The longer ginger bug activation time (96 h) resulted in higher production of 
organic acids and alcohols, increased phenolic and volatile compounds 
concentration, greater microbial diversity, and increased lactic acid bacteria 
and yeasts. In the same way, the longer fermentation time (14 days) of ginger 
beer resulted in higher ethanol content, volatile compounds, and phenolic 
compounds, in addition to better sensory characteristics. Our results showed 
that ginger beer produced with ginger bug and fermented for 14 days showed 
better volatile and phenolic compound profiles, physicochemical parameters, 
microbial diversity, and sensory characteristics.

Mutagenic heterocyclic amines (HAs) are formed at low levels during cooking of 
meat and fish, and some of them are considered to be possible human carcinogens. 
The formation of HAs may be affected by the presence of synthetic or naturally 
occurring antioxidants. In the present study the effect of virgin olive oil 
(VOO) phenolic compounds, identified and quantified by LC-MS, on the formation 
of HAs in a model system was evaluated. An aqueous solution of creatinine, 
glucose, and glycine was heated in the presence of two samples of VOO differing 
only in the composition of phenolic compounds. The addition of VOO to the model 
system inhibited the formation of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline 
(IQx), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), and 
2-amino-3,7,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx) by between 30 and 50% 
compared with the control. Fresh-made olive oil, which contained a high amount 
of dihydroxyphenylethanol derivatives, inhibited HA formation more than a 
1-year-old oil did. The inhibition of HA formation was also verified using 
phenolic compounds extracted from VOO.

Quercetin is a typical flavonoid present mostly as glycosides in plant foods; it 
has attracted much attention for its potential beneficial effects in disease 
prevention. In this study, we examined human volunteers after the short-term 
ingestion of onion, a vegetable rich in quercetin glucosides. The subjects were 
served diets containing onion slices (quercetin equivalent: 67.6-93.6 mg/day) 
with meals for 1 wk. Quercetin was only found in glucuronidase-sulfatase-treated 
plasma, and its concentration after 10 h of fasting increased from 0.04 +/- 0.04 
microM before the trial to 0.63 +/- 0.72 microM after the 1-wk trial. The 
quercetin content in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) after glucuronidase-sulfatase 
treatment corresponded to <1% of the alpha-tocopherol content. Human LDL 
isolated from the plasma after the trial showed little improvement of its 
resistance to copper ion-induced oxidation. It is therefore concluded that 
conjugated metabolites of quercetin accumulate exclusively in human blood plasma 
in the concentration range of 10(-7) approximately 10(-6) M after the short-term 
ingestion of vegetables rich in quercetin glucosides, although these metabolites 
are hardly incorporated into plasma LDL.

University, Beijing, China.

The study was aim to assess the impact of biochanin A on the oral 
bioavailability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of saquinavir (SQV), a substrate of 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp), in rats. 10 male rats were randomized into 2 groups of 
equal size, and administered orally 30 mg/kg SQV with or without 20 mg/kg 
biochanin A. The PK of SQV was assessed using non-compartmental analysis. 
Results revealed that the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of SQV 
from time zero to time infinity (AUC0-∞) was reduced by 51.39% by biochanin A 
(P=0.038); while the apparent systemic clearance (CL/F) was increased by 87.62% 
(P=0.028). Double peak phenomenon was observed in the plasma SQV profiles. 
Biochanin A increased the first peak, yet decreased the second peak of plasma 
SQV levels. Our study demonstrates that biochanin A can significantly reduce SQV 
oral bioavailability and alter SQV PK profiles in rats. Findings in this study 
suggest a precaution in the clinic when SQV is administered with dietary/herbal 
supplements that contain biochanin A.

The purpose of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetics of quercetin 
aglycone as well as its conjugated metabolites and to develop a population 
pharmacokinetic model for quercetin that incorporates enterohepatic 
recirculation. The stability of quercetin in different matrices at various 
temperatures and pH, and the quercetin content of six capsules of the herbal 
preparation Quercetin-500 Plus were determined by HPLC. Subjects received 
quercetin 500 mg three times daily and blood and urine samples were obtained. 
The concentration of quercetin aglycone and conjugated metabolites were assayed 
using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. Pharmacokinetic 
parameters were determined using noncompartmental analysis with WinNonlin. A 
population compartment model incorporating input from the gallbladder was 
developed to account for the enterohepatic recirculation observed with 
quercetin. The oral clearance (CL/F) was high (3.5 x 10(4)l/h) with an average 
terminal half-life of 3.5 h for quercetin. The plasma concentration versus time 
curves exhibited re-entry peaks. A one-compartment model that included 
enterohepatic recirculation best described the plasma data. This represents the 
first comprehensive evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and enterohepatic 
recirculation of quercetin in humans. Population pharmacokinetic models adapted 
for enterohepatic recirculation allowed an assessment of the magnitude and 
frequency of the enterohepatic recirculation process.

The preparation of OSA-modified starch often involves heterogeneous reactions, 
high energy consumption and environmental pollution. To address these issues, 
this study explored a novel strategy for producing OSA-modified corn starch via 
a semi-dry process assisted by improved extrusion cooking technology (IECT). The 
degree of substitution (DS), structure and properties of OSA-modified corn 
starch, as well as the underlying mechanisms of these changes, were 
investigated. Results showed that as the screw speeds increased, starch granule 
morphology became rougher, and the crystalline structure was disrupted. 
OSA-modified starch exhibited higher peak viscosity and lower gelatinization 
temperatures. At 300 rpm, the DS of OSA-modified starch prepared via 
IECT-assisted semi-dry processing increased by 44 ± 0.5 % compared with the 
conventional method. The resistant starch content increased to 19.6 ± 0.3 %, and 
it showed better emulsifying activity and stability. This study provides a 
theoretical foundation for the efficient preparation of OSA-modified starch.

The intake of alkylresorcinols and lignans in Spain is unknown due to the lack 
of information on the content of these compounds in particular foods. This paper 
describes the development of the first alkylresorcinol and lignan database 
adapted to the Spanish diet, including foods items especially relevant for this 
population. The values of alkylresorcinols and lignans in common foods and 
beverages were collected from scientific publications in refereed journals, and 
other foods particularly consumed in Spain, for which values were not available, 
were analyzed by standardized protocols and included into the database. The 
Alignia database presents the content of alkylresorcinols in 88 food items and 
the lignan content of 593 foods and beverages. Using the database, the intake of 
lignans in Spain, calculated using data from the Food Composition Panel based on 
household consumption, was estimated to be 0.76 mg/day.

The presence of stilbenes in wine is becoming an important issue due to their 
claimed relation to a low incidence in coronary diseases and their increasing 
implication as cancer chemopreventive and neuroprotective agents. Total 
resveratrol content, quantified as glucoside and aglycone forms of resveratrol, 
has been determined in a survey of 45 Monastrell monovarietal Spanish red wine 
types (around 135 wine samples), belonging to Alicante and Bullas appellations. 
The average between ratio glucoside/aglycone forms of resveratrol in these wines 
was considerably high, ranging from 82 to 91% of resveratrol in its glycosidic 
form. This characteristic was observed in a high percentage of the studied 
wines, which were made under different winemaking procedures, and from different 
vintages (1995-2002). In addition, wines made using macerative fermentations 
with double amount of solid parts (""doble pasta"") reached the highest levels of 
total stilbene content expressed as resveratrol equivalent, i.e., 30 mg/L 
(average of 18.8 mg/L). It can be concluded that high resveratrol glucoside 
concentration and low free isomer content can be considered characteristics of 
the Monastrell variety, as it happens to red wines deriving from other varieties 
grown at warm climates. This fact, also observed for other French and Portuguese 
red varieties, might play an important role in food habits involving these types 
of wines.

Six flavone glycosides were separated by HPLC using RP-18 with a quaternary 
mobile phase mixture [water-acetonitrile-tetrahydrofuran-acetic acid (80:16:3:1, 
v/v)]. This procedure was applied to the separation and determination of the 
most important flavanone glycosides contained in pure grapefruit and sour orange 
juices and mixtures. This method can be used for quality control of industrial 
concentrates and juices.

We present a simultaneous liquid chromatographic method for the separation of 
two flavonoid compound families, flavanone glycosides (FGs) and polymethoxylated 
flavones (PMFs), which are usually found in citrus fruits species and varieties. 
This technique permits the quantitation of six FGs (narirutin, naringin, 
hesperidin, neohesperidin, didymin, poncirin) and six PMFs (sinensetin, 
hexamethoxyflavone, nobiletin, scutellarein, heptamethoxyflavone and 
tangeretin). This technique, to be used to characterize a citrus juice by its 
polyphenolic profile, has been applied to the determination of flavonoid 
compounds in grapefruit- and orange juice. Differentiation of orange juice 
varieties and mixtures containing tangor juice using polyphenolic profiles and 
flavonoid content has been achieved.

Anthocyanins, phenolics, and antioxidant capacity in diverse small fruits: 
vaccinium, rubus, and ribes.

Fruits from 107 genotypes of Vaccinium L., Rubus L., and Ribes L., were analyzed 
for total anthocyanins (ACY), total phenolics (TPH), and antioxidant capacities 
as determined by oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC) and ferric reducing 
antioxidant power (FRAP). Fruit size was highly correlated (r = 0.84) with ACY 
within Vaccinium corymbosum L., but was not correlated to ACY across eight other 
Vaccinium species, or within 27 blackberry hybrids. Certain Vaccinium and Ribes 
fruits with pigmented flesh were lower in ACY, TPH, ORAC, and FRAP compared to 
those values in berries with nonpigmented flesh. ORAC values ranged from 19 to 
131 micromol Trolox equivalents/g in Vaccinium, from 13 to 146 in Rubus, and 
from 17 to 116 in Ribes. Though ACY may indicate TPH, the range observed in 
ACY/TPH ratios precludes prediction of ACY from TPH and vice versa for a single 
genotype. In general, TPH was more highly correlated to antioxidant capacity 
than ACY was. This study demonstrates the wide diversity of phytochemical levels 
and antioxidant capacities within and across three genera of small fruit.

Genotype and environmental variation in phenolic content, phenolic acid 
composition, and antioxidant activity of hard spring wheat.

The health-promoting effects of whole-grain wheat likely derive from phenolic 
compounds and other antioxidants that also make wheat a potential source of 
functional food ingredients. The objective of this study was to determine the 
effects of genotype and growing environment on the phenolic contents and 
antioxidant activities of alcohol-soluble extracts from commercial wheat 
cultivars. Total phenolic contents (TPCs), antioxidant activities (AOAs), and 
concentrations of six phenolic acids were measured in six red- and white-grained 
hard spring wheat genotypes grown at four diverse locations in Western Canada 
during the 2003 crop year. There were significant differences among genotypes 
and environments for TPC, AOA, and concentrations of all the phenolic acids 
measured. The predominant indicators of antioxidant potential, i.e., TPC, AOA, 
and ferulic acid (FA) concentration were highly intercorrelated (r > 0.72). For 
these indices, the Canada Western (CW) Red Spring wheat cultivars Neepawa and AC 
Elsa had the highest levels, whereas an analogous CW hard white spring wheat 
cultivar, AC Snowbird, had the lowest levels. Grain color did not appear to be a 
factor in the expression of antioxidant-related parameters. For both TPC and 
AOA, as well as for vanillic acid, syringic acid, and ferulic acid, 
environmental effects were considerably larger than genotype effects. Neither 
growing temperature nor rainfall from anthesis to maturity appeared to be 
related to the environmental variation that was observed. Genotype x environment 
interaction was small for all parameters compared with genotype and location 
effects and was significant only for TPC. Genotype variation for antioxidant 
properties indicates that it would be possible to select for these quantitative 
traits in a breeding program. However, the significant environmental variation 
observed would delay and/or complicate this process.

A total of 72, 65-week-old broiler breeder hens (Ross 308, BW 4,190 ± 45 g) was 
placed in individual cages to investigate utilization of fiber in soy hulls 
(SH), oat hulls (OH), and flax meal (FM). Birds were adapted to cages for 10 d 
prior to allocation (n = 18) to broiler breeder ration (control) or control 
mixed with either of the 3 fiber sources (wt/wt) added to supply equal amounts 
of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) ∼21% and TiO2. The daily feed allocation was 
based on 4% BW. Feed intake (FI) was monitored daily, and grab excreta samples 
were taken on d 16 and 17. On d 18, all birds were weighed and killed 2 h post 
feeding to measure ceca digesta pH and short chain fatty acids (SCFA). Relative 
to the control birds, birds receiving fiber lost (P < 0.05) BW due to decreased 
(P < 0.05) FI. The BW changes were respectively +80, -174, -133, and -585 g/bird 
for control, SH, OH, and FM, and corresponding FI was 1,062, 918, 885, and 
590 g/bird. Birds fed FM retained higher (P < 0.05) NDF than birds fed either SH 
or OH. The ceca digesta pH was lower (P < 0.05) in birds receiving added fiber 
relative to control. However, ceca digesta pH of FM fed birds was lower (P < 
0.05) than in birds fed either SH or OH, which were in turn similar (P > 0.05). 
Birds fed FM had higher (P < 0.05) concentration of butyric acid than birds fed 
the control diets, while birds fed SH and OH had intermediate butyric acid 
concentration. Acetic acid and total SCFA concentrations were higher (P < 0.05) 
in birds fed OH diet than in birds fed control but was similar (P > 0.05) to 
that in birds fed either SH or FM. In conclusion, short term feeding of fibrous 
feed ingredients reduced BW linked to reduced FI. Fiber sources exhibited 
differences in utilization reflective of chemical characteristics.

A HPLC-MS procedure for the sensitive and specific analysis of the black tea 
flavonoid theaflavin in human plasma and urine was developed. Levels were 
measured after enzymatic deconjugation, extraction into ethyl acetate, and 
separation by HPLC, using tandem mass spectrometry as a detecting system. Two 
healthy volunteers consumed 700 mg theaflavins, equivalent to about 30 cups of 
black tea. The maximum concentration detected in blood plasma was 1.0 microg 
l(-1) in a sample collected after 2 h. The concentration in urine also peaked 
after 2 h at 4.2 microg l(-1). Hence, only minute amounts of theaflavins can be 
detected in plasma and urine samples of healthy volunteers after ingestion.

Epidemiological studies suggest that consumption of flavonol-rich diets 
decreases the risk of developing heart disease and certain cancers. Recent 
studies have detected flavonol conjugates in blood and urine following various 
dietary interventions. To assess to what extent flavonols also accumulate in 
tissues, where they might be expected to exert anti-carcinogenic and 
anti-atherogenic effects, [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside was synthesized and 
fed to rats. After 60 min, 93.6% of the ingested radioactivity was recovered 
from the intestine, incorporated into 18 metabolites that had undergone 
deglycosylation followed by varying degrees of glucuronidation, methylation, 
and/or sulfation. [(14)C]Quercetin, the aglycon of the radiolabeled substrate, 
was present in the intestine and in trace amounts in the liver but was not 
detected in the plasma and kidneys. The original [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside 
was detected exclusively in the intestine, where it accounted for only 26.2% of 
the radioactivity. The remainder of the recovered radioactivity was located 
mainly in the plasma, liver, and kidneys as (14)C-labeled metabolites. However, 
compared to the quantities in the gastrointestinal tract, the levels of 
metabolites in plasma and body tissues were very low, indicating only limited 
absorption into the blood stream. The data demonstrate that 
quercetin-4'-glucoside, which is a major flavonol in onions, undergoes rapid and 
extensive metabolism in the intestine, and this appears not to be associated to 
any extent with transport across the gut wall into the blood stream.

Scottish-grown red raspberries are a rich source of vitamin C and phenolics, 
most notably, the anthocyanins cyanidin-3-sophoroside, 
cyanidin-3-(2(G)-glucosylrutinoside), and cyanidin-3-glucoside, and two 
ellagitannins, sanguiin H-6 and lambertianin C, which are present together with 
trace levels of flavonols, ellagic acid, and hydroxycinnamates. The antioxidant 
capacity of the fresh fruit and the levels of vitamin C and phenolics were not 
affected by freezing. When fruit were stored at 4 degrees C for 3 days and then 
at 18 degrees C for 24 h, mimicking the route fresh fruit takes after harvest to 
the supermarket and onto the consumer's table, anthocyanin levels were 
unaffected while vitamin C levels declined and those of elligitannins increased, 
and overall, there was no effect on the antioxidant capacity of the fruit. It is 
concluded, therefore, that freshly picked, fresh commercial, and frozen 
raspberries all contain similar levels of phytochemicals and antioxidants per 
serving.

Bioavailability and metabolism of orange juice flavanones in humans: impact of a 
full-fat yogurt.

Mullen W(1), Archeveque MA, Edwards CA, Matsumoto H, Crozier A.

Author information:
(1)University of Glasgow, United Kingdom.

The bioavailability of dietary phytochemicals may be influenced by the food 
matrix in which they are consumed. In this study the impact of a full-fat yogurt 
on the bioavailability and metabolism of orange juice flavanones was 
investigated. Human plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period after the 
consumption of 250 mL of orange juice containing a total of 168 micromol of 
hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside and 12 micromol of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside, with and 
without 150 mL of full-fat yogurt. The juice also contained 1 g of paracetamol 
and 5 g of lactulose. HPLC-MS(2) analysis revealed the accumulation of 
hesperetin-7-O-glucuronide, and an unassigned hesperetin-O-glucuronide 
metabolite in plasma reached a peak concentration (C(max)) of 924 +/- 224 
nmol/L, 4.4 +/- 0.5 h (T(max)) after orange juice ingestion. The T(max) is 
indicative of absorption in the colon. When the juice was consumed with yogurt, 
neither the C(max) at 661 +/- 170 nmol/L nor the T(max) at 5.1 +/- 0.4 h were 
significantly different from those obtained with juice alone. The two hesperetin 
glucuronides were also excreted in urine along with a third 
hesperetin-O-glucuronide, two hesperetin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfates, a 
hesperetin-O-diglucuronide, a naringenin-O-diglucuronide, and, tentatively 
identified, naringenin-7-O-glucuronide and naringenin-4'-O-glucuronide. This 
indicates the occurrence of substantial, postabsorption, phase II metabolism 
prior to urinary excretion. The quantity of flavanone metabolites excreted 0-5 h 
after orange juice ingestion was significantly reduced by yogurt, but over the 
full 0-24 h urine collection period, the amounts excreted, corresponding to ca. 
7.0% of intake, were not affected by the addition of yogurt to the drink. Nor 
did yogurt have a significant effect on gastric emptying, as determined by 
plasma paracetamol levels, or on the mouth to cecum transit time of the head of 
the meal, assessed by measurement of lactulose-derived breath hydrogen. There is 
also a discussion of the merits of studies of the absorption and metabolism of 
flavanones based on direct analysis of metabolites by HPLC-MS and the more 
traditional indirect approach where samples are treated with a mollusc 
glucuronidase/sulfatase preparation prior to HPLC analysis of the released 
aglycones.

Plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period after the consumption by 
humans of 200 g of strawberries, containing 222 micromol of pelargonidin-3- 
O-glucoside, with and without cream. The main metabolite, a pelargonidin- 
O-glucuronide, reached a peak plasma concentration ( C max) of 274 +/- 24 nmol/L 
after 1.1 +/- 0.4 h ( t max) when only strawberries were ingested. When the 
strawberries were eaten with cream, the C max was not statistically different 
but the t max at 2.4 +/- 0.5 h was delayed significantly ( p < 0.001). The 
pelargonidin- O-glucuronide, along with smaller quantities of other metabolites, 
was also excreted in urine in quantities corresponding to ca. 1% of anthocyanin 
intake. The quantities excreted over the 0-24 h collection period were not 
influenced significantly by cream. However, the 0-2 h excretion of anthocyanin 
metabolites was significantly lower when the strawberries were eaten with cream, 
whereas the reverse occurred during with the 5-8 h excretion period. In keeping 
with these observations, measurement of plasma paracetamol and breath hydrogen 
revealed that cream delayed gastric emptying and extended mouth to cecum transit 
time.

A national sampling plan was developed to select the most widely used 
isoflavone-containing foods in the United States. Foods were selected based on 
their retail volume and sampled in five geographical areas representing seven 
metropolitan areas. Isoflavones were analyzed from composite samples, raw and 
cooked, and reported by brand. Quality control measures were evaluated 
throughout the study. Isoflavone levels ranged from 1 microg/g in soy sauces to 
540 microg/g in tempeh. Soymilk and tofu represented the major portion of soy 
foods evaluated. These data will appear in the electronic version of USDA 
Handbook No. 8 of Food Composition Data in 1999.

The inhibition and eradication of oral biofilms is increasingly focused on the 
use of plant extracts as mouthwashes and toothpastes adjuvants. Here, we report 
on the chemical composition and the antibiofilm activity of 15 methanolic 
extracts of Iris species against both mono-(Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
Staphylococcus aureus) and multi-species oral biofilms (Streptococcus gordonii, 
Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, and Actinomyces 
naeslundii). The phytochemical profiles of Iris pallida s.l., Iris versicolor 
L., Iris lactea Pall., Iris carthaliniae Fomin, and Iris germanica were 
determined by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution 
tandem mass spectroscopy (UHPLC-HRMS/MS) analysis, and a total of 180 compounds 
were identified among Iris species with (iso)flavonoid dominancy. I. pallida, I. 
versicolor, and I. germanica inhibited both the quorum sensing and adhesion 
during biofilm formation in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the 
extracts were less active against maturated biofilms. Of the five tested 
species, Iris pallida s.l. was the most effective at both inhibiting biofilm 
formation and disrupting existing biofilms, and the leaf extract exhibited the 
strongest inhibitory effect compared to the root and rhizome extracts. The 
cytotoxicity of the extracts was excluded in human fibroblasts. The inhibition 
of bacterial adhesion significantly correlated with myristic acid content, and 
quorum sensing inhibition correlated with the 7-β-hydroxystigmast-4-en-3-one 
content. These findings could be useful for establishing an effective tool for 
the control of oral biofilms and thus dental diseases.

Neochlorogenic acid (3-CQA) and cryptochlorogenic acid (4-CQA), isolated from 
prune (Prunus domestica L.), were identified by NMR and MS analyses. In 
addition, the quantity of chlorogenic acid isomers in prune were measured by 
HPLC. These isomers, 3-CQA, 4-CQA, and chlorogenic acid (5-CQA), were contained 
in the ratio 78.7:18. 4:3.9, respectively. 4-CQA was identified and quantified 
in prune for the first time, and relatively high amounts of this isomer were 
characteristic. Antioxidative activities of the chlorogenic acid isomers, such 
as scavenging activity on superoxide anion radicals and inhibitory effect 
against oxidation of methyl linoleate, were also evaluated. Each isomer showed 
antioxidative activities which were almost the same.

Previous studies on coffee examined absorption of phenolic acids (PA) in the 
small intestine, but not the contribution of the colon to absorption. Nine 
healthy volunteers ingested instant soluble coffee ( approximately 335 mg total 
chlorogenic acids (CGAs)) in water. Blood samples were taken over 12 h, and at 
24 h to assess return to baseline. Many previous studies, which used 
glucuronidase and sulfatase, measured only PA and did not rigorously assess 
CGAs. To improve this, plasma samples were analyzed after full hydrolysis by 
chlorogenate esterase, glucuronidase and sulfatase to release aglycone 
equivalents of PA followed by liquid-liquid extraction and ESI-LC-ESI-MS/MS 
detection. Ferulic, caffeic and isoferulic acid equivalents appeared rapidly in 
plasma, peaking at 1-2 h. Dihydrocaffeic and dihydroferulic acids appeared in 
plasma 6-8 h after ingestion (T(max=)8-12 h). Substantial variability in maximum 
plasma concentration and T(max) was also observed between individuals. This 
study confirms that the small intestine is a significant site for absorption of 
PA, but shows for the first time that the colon/microflora play the major role 
in absorption and metabolism of CGAs and PA from coffee.

Knowledge of the biochemical processes responsible for the release of phenolic 
acids (precursors of vinyl aromatics) during malting is important to find 
mitigation strategies for the toxicologically relevant styrene (formed from 
cinnamic acid) in wheat beer. Therefore, grain and malts of four barley and 
three wheat varieties were screened for the activities of various enzymes and 
the amounts of nonstarch polysaccharides (to which the phenolic acids are bound 
to a certain extent). During malting, a very strong degradation of β-glucan, 
synonymous to a depletion of the cell walls, was found, suggesting that a 
partial degradation of cell walls cannot have an effect on the release of 
phenolic acids. In barley malts, water-extractable arabinoxylan contents were 
between 0.59 and 0.79 g/100 g dm and in wheat malts between 0.93 and 1.51 g/100 
g dm. Additionally, higher soluble ferulic acid contents in wheat wort compared 
to barley wort indicated that the degradation of nonstarch polysaccharides has 
an impact on the release of phenolic acids. For the feruloyl esterase, higher 
activities were found in malts of the barley varieties. However, this fact was 
not reflected by the free phenolic acid contents in those malts. Correlation 
coefficients between the protease activity and the feruloyl esterase, α- and 
β-amylase, and β-glucanase activities were proven to be insignificant, 
highlighting that the protease activity had no effect on the activities of these 
other enzymes.

In spite of the wide literature describing the biological effects of phenolic 
compounds, scarce data are available on their absorption from diet. In the 
present work, we studied the absorption in humans of phenolic acids from beer, a 
common beverage rich in different phenolic acids with related chemical 
structures. Beer was analyzed for free and total (free+bound) phenolic acids. 
Ferulic, caffeic and sinapic acids were present in beer mainly as bound forms, 
while 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and p-coumaric acid were present mainly as free 
forms. Vanillic acid was present equally in the free and bound forms. Plasma 
samples were collected before and 30 and 60 min after beer administration and 
analyzed for free and conjugated phenolic acid content. A significant two- to 
fourfold increase in plasma levels of phenolic acids was detected with peak 
concentrations at 30 min after beer ingestion. 4-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid was 
present in plasma mainly as nonconjugated forms while p-coumaric acid was 
present equally as nonconjugated and conjugated forms. Ferulic, vanillic and 
caffeic acids were present in plasma predominantly as conjugated forms, with a 
slight prevalence of sulfates with respect to glucuronates. Our results indicate 
that phenolic acids from beer are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and 
are present in blood after being largely metabolized to the form of glucuronide 
and sulfate conjugates. The extent of conjugation is related to the chemical 
structure of phenolic acids: the monohydroxy derivatives showing the lowest 
conjugation degree and the dihydroxy derivatives showing the highest one.

The phenolic composition, aroma compounds, and organic acid content of 83 
vinegars have been determined. Multivariate analysis techniques have been used 
to classify these vinegar samples according to raw material (white wine, red 
wine, apple, honey, alcohol, balsamic, and malt) and production process (with 
and without aging in wood). Cluster analysis grouped the samples according to 
production process. Only apple and balsamic vinegars were separated from wine 
vinegars. Alcohol, honey, and malt vinegars were grouped with no aged wine 
vinegars. Linear discriminate analysis allowed a 88% differentiation according 
to raw material and 100% according to aging in wood. Besides, from the results 
obtained, a major role of the volatile compounds in the differentiation of the 
vinegar samples according to their aging period in wood can be seen.

The antioxidant polyphenols in cacao liquor, a major ingredient of chocolate and 
cocoa, have been characterized as flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidin oligomers. 
In this study, various cacao products were analyzed by normal-phase HPLC, and 
the profiles and quantities of the polyphenols present, grouped by molecular 
size (monomers to approximately oligomers), were compared. Individual cacao 
polyphenols, flavan-3-ols (catechin and epicatechin), and dimeric (procyanidin 
B2), trimeric (procyanidin C1), and tetrameric (cinnamtannin A2) 
proanthocyanidins, and galactopyranosyl-ent-(-)-epicatechin (2alpha-->7, 
4alpha-->8)-(-)-epicatechin (Gal-EC-EC), were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC 
and/or HPLC/MS. The profile of monomers (catechins) and proanthocyanidin in dark 
chocolate was similar to that of cacao liquor, while the ratio of flavan-3-ols 
to the total amount of monomeric and oligomeric polyphenols in the case of pure 
cocoa powder was higher than that in the case of cacao liquor or chocolate.

(-)-epicatechin is one of the most potent antioxidants present in the human 
diet. Particularly high levels are found in black tea, apples, and chocolate. 
High intake of catechins has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular 
diseases. There have been several reports concerning the bioavailability of 
catechins, however, the chemical structure of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in 
blood, tissues, and urine remains unclear. In the present study, we purified and 
elucidated the chemical structure of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in human and 
rat urine after oral administration. Three metabolites were purified from human 
urine including (-)-epicatechin-3'-O-glucuronide, 
4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-3'-O-glucuronide, and 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-5 
or 7-O-glucuronide, according to 1H- and 13C-NMR, HMBC, and LC-MS analyses. The 
metabolites purified from rat urine were 3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin, 
(-)-epicatechin-7-O-glucuronide, and 
3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-7-O-glucuronide. These compounds were also detected 
in the blood of humans and rats by LC-MS. The presence of these metabolites in 
blood and urine suggests that catechins are metabolized and circulated in the 
body after administration of catechin-containing foods.

Catechins are polyphenolic plant compounds (flavonoids) that may offer 
significant health benefits to humans. These benefits stem largely from their 
anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, and antimutagenic properties. Recent 
epidemiological studies suggest that the consumption of flavonoid-containing 
foods is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Chocolate is a 
natural cocoa bean-based product that reportedly contains high levels of 
monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric catechins. We have applied solid-liquid 
extraction and liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical 
ionization-mass spectrometry to the identification and determination of the 
predominant monomeric catechins, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin, in a baking 
chocolate Standard Reference Material (NIST Standard Reference Material 2384). 
(+)-Catechin and (-)-epicatechin are detected and quantified in chocolate 
extracts on the basis of selected-ion monitoring of their protonated [M + H](+) 
molecular ions. Tryptophan methyl ester is used as an internal standard. The 
developed method has the capacity to accurately quantify as little as 0.1 
microg/mL (0.01 mg of catechin/g of chocolate) of either catechin in chocolate 
extracts, and the method has additionally been used to certify (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin levels in the baking chocolate Standard Reference Material. This 
is the first reported use of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry for the 
quantitative determination of monomeric catechins in chocolate and the only 
report certifying monomeric catechin levels in a food-based Standard Reference 
Material.

Human metabolism of mammalian lignan precursors in raw and processed flaxseed.

Nesbitt PD(1), Lam Y, Thompson LU.

Author information:

Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

BACKGROUND: The mammalian lignans enterolactone and enterodiol are produced in 
the colon by the action of bacteria on the plant precursor secoisolariciresinol 
diglycoside, which is found in high concentrations in flaxseed.
OBJECTIVE: Two experiments were conducted to determine 1) whether there is a 
dose response in urinary lignan excretion with increasing flaxseed intake, 2) 
whether flaxseed processing affects lignan excretion, 3) peak plasma lignan 
concentrations, and 4) plasma lignan concentrations after chronic 
supplementation.
DESIGN: Nine healthy young women supplemented their diets with 5, 15, or 25 g 
raw or 25 g processed (muffin or bread) flaxseed for 7 d during the follicular 
phase of their menstrual cycles. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected 
at baseline and on the final day of supplementation. As an adjunct to the 
25-g-flaxseed arm, subjects consumed the supplement for an additional day and 
blood and urine samples were collected at specific intervals. All blood and 
urine samples were analyzed for enterolactone and enterodiol by gas 
chromatography-mass spectroscopy.
RESULTS: A dose-dependent urinary lignan response to raw flaxseed was observed 
(r = 0.72, P < 0.001). The processing of flaxseed as a muffin or bread did not 
affect the quantity of lignan excretion. Plasma lignan concentrations were 
greater (P < or = 0.05) than baseline by 9 h after flaxseed ingestion 
(29.35+/-3.69 and 51.75+/-7.49 nmol/L, respectively). The total plasma area 
under the curve was higher on the eighth than on the first day (1840.15+/-343.02 
and 1027.15+/-95.71 nmol x h/L, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Mammalian lignan production from flaxseed precursors is dependent on 
time and dose but not on processing.

Hesperidin is the predominant polyphenol consumed from citrus fruits and juices. 
However, hesperidin is proposed to have limited bioavailability due to the 
rutinoside moiety attached to the flavonoid. The aim of this study was to 
demonstrate in human subjects that the removal of the rhamnose group to yield 
the corresponding flavonoid glucoside (i.e., hesperetin-7-glucoside) will 
improve the bioavailability of the aglycone hesperetin. Healthy volunteers 
(n=16) completed the double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Subjects 
randomly consumed hesperetin equivalents supplied as orange juice with natural 
hesperidin (""low dose""), orange juice treated with hesperidinase enzyme to yield 
hesperetin-7-glucoside, and orange juice fortified to obtain 3 times more 
hesperidin than naturally present (""high dose""). The area under the curve (AUC) 
for total plasma hesperetin of subjects consuming hesperetin-7-glucoside juice 
was 2-fold higher than that of subjects consuming the ""low"" dose hesperidin 
juice [3.45+/-1.27 vs. 1.16+/-0.52 mmol/(L.h), respectively, P>0.0001]. The AUC 
for hesperetin after consuming the hesperetin-7-glucoside juice was improved to 
the level of the ""high"" dose hesperidin juice [4.16+/-1.50 mmol/(L.h)]. The peak 
plasma concentrations (C(max)) of hesperetin were 4-fold higher (2.60+/-1.07 
mmol/L, P<0.0001) after subjects consumed hesperetin-7-glucoside juice compared 
with those consuming ""low"" dose hesperidin juice (0.48 +/- 0.27 mmol/L), and 
1.5-fold higher than those consuming ""high"" dose hesperidin juice (1.05+/-0.25 
mmol/L). The corresponding T(max) was much faster (0.6+/-0.1 h, P<0.0001) after 
subjects consumed hesperetin-7-glucoside juice compared with ""low"" dose 
(7.0+/-3.0 h) and ""high"" dose (7.4+/-2.0 h) hesperidin juices. The results of 
this study demonstrated that the bioavailability of hesperidin was modulated by 
enzymatic conversion to hesperetin-7-glucoside, thus changing the absorption 
site from the colon to the small intestine. This may affect future interventions 
concerning the health benefits of citrus flavonoids.

Polyphenols and antioxidant capacity of vegetables under fresh and frozen 
conditions.

The phenolic and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values have been 
measured in six fresh and frozen vegetables (beet green, spinach, broccoli, 
carrot, onion, and celery) from the same cultivar by analyzing the whole juice 
(WJ) and the acetonic extract of the squeezed pulp. To exploit the effect of the 
acid environment on the stability and recovery of the phenolics, perchloric acid 
(PCA) was added directly to WJ and to the pulp before the extraction with 
acetone. In both fresh and frozen vegetables, PCA markedly increased the 
recovery of phenolics extracted from the pulp, but PCA had no effect on the WJ. 
Four of six frozen vegetables showed lower phenolic and ORAC values than the 
fresh vegetables, whereas in the other two cases, values were significantly 
higher compared to fresh samples. Among the fresh vegetables, beet green showed 
the highest ORAC and phenolic values; however, when measured in two different 
cultivars of beet green, the ORAC value showed as much as 4.5-fold variation, 
whereas total phenolics and flavonoids showed 1.2- and 3.5-fold variations, 
respectively. The results show that total phenolics and ORAC, compared in fresh 
and frozen vegetables, represent an index of the mildness of blanching in the 
industry of frozen vegetables and provide a measure of the gap in antioxidants 
in the diet of people who consume frozen instead of fresh vegetables. The plant 
genotype is an important source of variability in the ORAC value, which can be 
conveniently used to increase the intake of antioxidants from vegetables.

Vegetables are the most important sources of phenolics in the Mediterranean 
diet. Phenolics, especially flavonoids, are suggested as being essential 
bioactive compounds providing health benefits. In this study, twenty-seven 
vegetables, fifteen aromatic herbs and some spices consumed in Central Italy 
(the Marches region) were studied to reveal total phenolic, flavonoid and 
flavanol content as well as their antioxidant capacity measured by the oxygen 
radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. A comparison in terms of antioxidant 
capacity was made between different salads, as well as between salads to which 
aromatic herbs had been added. Lemon balm and marjoram at a concentration of 1.5 
% w/w increased by 150 % and 200 % respectively the antioxidant capacity of a 
salad portion. A 200 g portion of a salad enriched with marjoram corresponded to 
an intake of 200 (SD 10) mg phenolics and 4000 (SD 300) ORAC units (micromol 
Trolox equivalents). Olive oils and wine or apple vinegars were the salad 
dressings that provided the highest increase in antioxidant capacity. Among the 
spices tested, cumin and fresh ginger made the most significant contribution to 
the antioxidant capacity. The results are useful in surveying the antioxidant 
parameters of vegetables, herbs and spices produced and consumed in our 
geographical area as well as in quantifying the daily intake of phenolics and 
ORAC units. The results can be used in public health campaigns to stimulate the 
consumption of vegetables able to provide significant health protection in order 
to prevent chronic diseases.

A mandarin-type citrus fruit, ponkan (Citrus reticulata), was processed by 
in-line, chopper pulper, and hand-press extractions to investigate the effect of 
extraction method on the concentrations of bioactive compounds in processed 
juice. Concentrations of polymethoxylated flavones (tangeretin, nobiletin, and 
sinensetin) and beta-cryptoxanthin in juice, and inhibitory activities against 
arachidonate cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenases of the juice extract were 
analyzed. The juice processed by hand-press extraction contained the largest 
amounts of nobiletin (3.56 mg/100 mL), tangeretin (4.10 mg/100 mL), and 
sinensetin (0.13 mg/100 mL). Concentrations of beta-cryptoxanthin were 0.66, 
0.59, 0.55, and 0.50 mg/100 mL in chopper pulper, in-line (5/64 in.), in-line 
(8/64 in.) and hand-press juices, respectively. Both extracts of in-line juices 
showed greater inhibitory activity toward platelet 12-lipoxygenase than the 
others. The inhibitory effect of hand-press juice extract on platelet 
cyclooxygenase activity was remarkable among juice extracts. All juice extracts 
effectively inhibited polymorphonuclear 5-lipoxygenase activity at nearly the 
same rate.

Anthocyanins are water-soluble pigments that are liable for colors ranging from 
red to blue of most fruits, vegetables, and flowers. A novel and fast method was 
developed for the determination of five anthocyanins and free pelargonidin by 
high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to photodiode array detection. A 
10% formic acid and acetonitrile mixture was employed as mobile phase in the 
gradient elution mode. Mobile phase composition, column temperature, flow rate, 
injection volume, and column conditioning time were optimized by employing a 
stepwise strategy. Using a C18 core-shell column (100 × 4.6 mm, 2.7 μm), the 
separation of six analytes was accomplished in less than 9.5 min with a 
run-to-run analysis time of 19 min. The developed method was validated with 
respect to linearity (r > 0.9999), limit of detection, limit of quantification, 
intra-/interday precision (<2%), accuracy (98.6-104.4%), and specificity. 
Afterwards, the method was applied to the determination of anthocyanins present 
in 15 different samples including fruits, fruit juices, and fruit wines.

High-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) and mass spectrometric (MS) 
procedures were developed to determine lignans in flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) 
and chaparral (Larrea tridentata). Flaxseed contains high levels of 
phytoestrogens. Chaparral has been associated with acute nonviral toxic 
hepatitis and contains lignans that are structurally similar to known estrogenic 
compounds. Both flaxseed and chaparral products have been marketed as dietary 
supplements. A mild enzyme hydrolysis procedure to prevent the formation of 
artifacts in the isolation step was used in the determination of 
secoisolariciresinol in flaxseed products. HPLC with ultraviolet spectral (UV) 
or MS detection was used as the determinative steps. HPLC procedures with UV 
detection and mass spectrometry were developed to characterize the phenolic 
components, including lignans and flavonoids, of chaparral and to direct 
fractionation studies for the bioassays.

To fully investigate the effects of heat treatment on proteins and lipids in 
sheep milk, lipidomics and Astral-DIA proteomics combined with parallel reaction 
monitoring methods were used to analyze the changes of lipids and proteins after 
heat treatment at 65 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 15 s. A total of 79 and 381 
differential lipids and proteins were identified respectively. Lipidomics 
results show that Triacylglycerol (16:1_17:1_16:2) was unique in raw milk, 
whereas diacylglycerol (20:1_22:1) was unique in 95 °C group. Choline metabolism 
in cancer was the core metabolic pathway linked with heat treatment. 
Additionally, the collagen alpha-3(VI) chain protein (COL6A3), folate 
receptor-like domain-containing protein (FOLR1), and serpin domain-containing 
protein (JEQ12_008015) gradually disappeared with increasing heating 
temperature. The differentially expressed proteins were mainly associated with 
metabolic pathways. These analysis provide scientific connotation for the 
production of high quality dairy products and the healthy development of the 
dairy industry.

Cranberry, which is rich in polyphenols, including anthocyanins and 
proanthocyanidins, has been found to have various effects beneficial to human 
health, including prevention of urinary tract infections. These effects have 
been associated with polyphenols in the fruit. We investigated the excretion of 
anthocyanins in human urine after ingestion of cranberry juice. Eleven healthy 
volunteers consumed 200 ml of cranberry juice containing 650.8 microg total 
anthocyanins. Urine samples were collected within 24 h before and after 
consumption. Six of 12 anthocyanins identified in cranberry were quantified in 
human urine by HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization and tandem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS-MS). Among these, peonidin 3-O-galactoside, the second 
most plentiful anthocyanin in the juice, was found most abundantly in urine 
within 24 h, corresponding to 41.5 nmol (56.1% of total anthocyanins). The 
urinary levels of anthocyanins reached a maximum between 3 and 6 h after 
ingestion, and the recovery of total anthocyanins in the urine over 24 h was 
estimated to be 5.0% of the amount consumed. This study found high absorption 
and excretion of cranberry anthocyanins in human urine.

Changes occurring in the concentrations of alpha-tocopherol, total phenols, and 
complex phenols linked to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol (fractions FII and FIV) and 
p-hydroxyphenylethanol (FIII) during storage of virgin olive oil under 
environmental conditions were studied. Under diffused light, alpha-tocopherol 
was decomposed by 79% in 4 months, whereas <45% of the phenols were lost during 
the same period. Among the phenols, FII showed the least stability, and 
decreased by 72% in 6 months. Total phenols, FIII, and FIV recorded reductions 
in the range of 57-63% in 6 months. When the oil was stored in the dark, 
alpha-tocopherol, total phenols, FIII, and FIV exhibited similar profiles of 
degradation, reducing by 39-45% in the first 6 months and 50-62% in 12 months. 
FII was the least stable compound in the dark and recorded a loss of 64% in 6 
months and 79% in 12 months. The levels of the above antioxidants were further 
related to peroxide formation. Remaining levels of these compounds at PV = 20 
meq/kg ranged between 50 and 73% under diffused light and between 40 and 62% in 
the dark.

Four cultivars of strawberries (Senga Sengana, BFr77111, Elsanta, and Honeoye) 
were studied for their content of antioxidants, total antioxidant capacity, and 
low molecular weight carbohydrates in relation to harvest year, ripening stage, 
and cold storage. For ascorbic acid, chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, and total 
antioxidative capacity, measured in both water-soluble and water-insoluble 
extracts, there was a 2-5-fold variation among cultivars. Unripe berries 
contained lower concentrations of chlorogenic acid and p-coumaric acid and also 
quercetin and kaempferol compared with riper berries. During cold storage for up 
to 3 days, relatively few changes in the concentration of the different 
antioxidants occurred. The concentrations of several investigated parameters 
were interrelated, for example, for ascorbic acid and water-soluble antioxidant 
capacity and for ellagic acid and water-insoluble antioxidant capacity. The 
dominating sugars in strawberries were fructose and glucose, but considerable 
amounts of sucrose were also present, and their contents varied among cultivars, 
giving a predicted glycemic index of approximately 81. Verbascose, raffinose, 
and stachyose were found in only minor amounts. The study shows that the 
concentration of a number of bioactive compounds in strawberries varied 
according to cultivar, ripening stage, and storage. This information should make 
it possible to select strawberries with an optimal content of bioactive 
compounds.

Dietary phenols are antioxidants, and their consumption might contribute to the 
prevention of cardiovascular disease. Coffee and tea are major dietary sources 
of phenols. Dietary phenols are metabolized extensively in the body. Lack of 
quantitative data on their metabolites hinders a proper evaluation of the 
potential biological effects of dietary phenols in vivo. The aim of this study 
was to identify and quantify the phenolic acid metabolites of chlorogenic acid 
(major phenol in coffee), quercetin-3-rutinoside (major flavonol in tea) and 
black tea phenols in humans, and determine the site of metabolism. Healthy 
humans (n = 20) with an intact colon participated in a dietary controlled 
crossover study, and we identified and quantified approximately 60 potential 
phenolic acid metabolites in urine. Half of the ingested chlorogenic acid and 
43% of the tea phenols were metabolized to hippuric acid. Quercetin-3-rutinoside 
was metabolized mainly to phenylacetic acids, i.e., 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid 
(36%), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (8%) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic 
acid (5%). In contrast, in seven humans without a colon, we found only traces of 
phenolic acid metabolites in urine after they had ingested chlorogenic acid and 
quercetin-3-rutinoside. This implies that the colonic microflora convert most of 
these dietary phenols into metabolites that then reach the circulation. 
Metabolites of dietary phenols have lower antioxidant activity than their parent 
compounds; therefore, the contribution of dietary phenols to antioxidant 
activity in vivo might be lower than expected from in vitro tests.

Wheat bran is a conventional by-product of the wheat milling industry mainly 
used for animal feed. It is a rich and inexpensive source of phytonutrients, so 
is in demand for fibre-rich food products but creates quality issues when 
incorporated into bread. The purpose of this study was to characterize the 
physicochemical properties and phytochemical composition of different size durum 
bran fractions and show how they impact bread quality. Durum wheat (Triticum 
durum Desf.) was milled to create a coarse bran fraction (CB), which was further 
ground into a finer fraction (FB) which was sieved using four screens with 
apertures 425, 315, 250, 180, and <180 µm to create a particle size range of 
1497 to 115 µm. All fractions contained phytosterol with highest in the 180 and 
FB, while total phenolic acids and antioxidant capacity was highest in CB and 
425. Use of the fractions in a leavened common wheat (T. aestivum L.) bread 
formula at 10% incorporation negatively impacted bread loaf volume, colour, and 
texture compared to standard loaves, with CB having the least impact. Results 
suggest that to combine the highest phytochemical content with minimal impact on 
bread quality, bran particle size should be considered, with CB being the best 
choice.

Flaxseed lignan macromolecules (FLMs) are important polyphenols present in 
flaxseeds with interfacial adsorption behavior. However, FLMs are easily 
degraded during thermal treatment in emulsions, which further influences their 
interfacial properties and application. In this work, the interfacial properties 
of FLMs between oil and water were evaluated using compression isotherms and 
interfacial tension to investigate the regulation mechanism of FLMs and their 
heat-treated products on the stability of O/W emulsions. Furthermore, the 
improvement mechanism of FLM heat-treated products on the physicochemical 
stability of flaxseed oil emulsions was clarified. Studies showed that thermal 
degradation occurred on terminal phenolic acids in FLMs when treated under 100 
and 150 °C (FLM-100 and FLM-150) without any decrease in antioxidant activity. 
FLM-100 and FLM-150 improved the physicochemical stability of sunflower lecithin 
(S90)-stabilized flaxseed oil emulsions and reduced the concentration of 
hydroperoxides and TBARS by 26.7% and 80% (p < 0.05), respectively, during 
storage. This was due to the high interfacial anchoring of FLM-100 and FLM-150, 
which further strengthened the interface of oil droplets and improved the 
interfacial antioxidant effect of FLMs. This implies that FLM-100 and FLM-150 
could act as new efficient antioxidants for application in food emulsions.

Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) is a nutrient-rich plant valued for its 
medicinal and dietary applications that accumulates high levels of cellular 
metabolites. The root system demonstrates potent antioxidant properties. In this 
study, a single-nucleus resolution transcriptomic atlas of the Tartary buckwheat 
root system was generated using fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting. The 
analysis identified 10 major cell types and 22 cell clusters involved in root 
development, along with newly defined marker genes. The developmental 
trajectories of specific root cell types, such as root hairs and cortex cells, 
were mapped, and the key regulatory networks underlying their development were 
constructed. The flavonoid biosynthetic pathway of Tartary buckwheat was 
analyzed at the single-cell level. Furthermore, the core regulatory factor 
FtHD2B in Tartary buckwheat roots promoted the response of roots to stress by 
positively regulating the synthesis of flavonoids. This study provides the 
single-nucleus resolution transcriptomic dataset for the root system of a 
Polygonaceae plant, offering clues for understanding root cell differentiation 
and root system development within this family.

In the modern era, anthropogenic activities have led to an alarming increase in 
soil salinity, posing significant challenges to agriculture. Salinity not only 
adversely affects crop growth but also contributes to water pollution. Na stress 
reduces plant growth through osmotic effects, limiting water uptake and causing 
ion toxicity and oxidative damage. Brassinosteroids, a class of plant steroids, 
are well known for their roles in plant development and enhancing tolerance to 
various environmental stressors. This study aimed to investigate the impact of 
28-homobrassinolide (28-HBL) application, both through seed priming and foliar 
application on Phaseolus vulgaris L. (common beans) subjected to sodium fluoride 
(NaF) stress. In pot experiments, soil was treated with 200 ppm NaF via aqueous 
solution 15 days before sowing followed by seed priming and foliar application 
with two concentrations of 28-HBL (40 and 60 ppm). Seed priming with 28-HBL 
enhanced total phenolic content and facilitated the uptake of essential mineral 
nutrients (K+, Zn2+, and Mg2+), counteracting the adverse effects of NaF on 
plant growth. Furthermore, the combined treatment of seed priming and foliar 
application of 28-HBL significantly increased protein content (24%) and proline 
content (61%), with the highest levels observed in the 28-HBL SP+FS-60 ppm 
group. Gas exchange characteristics, chlorophyll a (66%), chlorophyll b (65%), 
and carotenoids (75%) were all significantly improved in plants subjected to 
SP+FS-60 ppm 28-HBL treatment compared to those treated solely with NaF stress. 
28-HBL effectively mitigated NaF induced stress by modulating ascorbic acid 
content and DPPH and enhancing the plant's antioxidant system, improving growth 
and biomass production. Additionally, the study investigated the antioxidant 
capacity of 28-HBL under salt stress, highlighting its potential as a valuable 
tool for enhancing P. vulgaris cultivation in fluoride-polluted soil. These 
findings underscore the potential of 28-homobrassinolide as a promising strategy 
for addressing soil salinity stress in agricultural settings.

Plain Language Summary: Prior research has mostly focused on how 
brassinosteroids helps plants deal with environmental stressors. However, we 
employ foliar application and seed priming to administer 28-homobrassinolide 
(28-HBL). Our research showed that exogenously administered 28-homobrassinolide 
(28-HBL) reduces sodium fluoride stress and improves the development of 
Phaseolus vulgaris L. (common beans) seedlings. The findings of this 
investigation lend credence to the use of 28-homobrassinolide (28-HBL) in crop 
stress management.

Epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested that diesel exhaust 
particles (DEPs), which generate reactive oxygen species, may be involved in the 
recent increase in the prevalence of lung diseases. Cacao liquor 
proanthocyanidins (CPs) are naturally occurring polyphenols with antioxidative 
activities. We carried out a study in mice to investigate the effects of dietary 
supplementation of CPs on lung injury induced by intratracheal administration of 
DEPs (500 microg/body). Dietary supplementation with 1.0 percent CPs inhibited 
DEP-induced lung injury, characterized by neutrophil sequestration and edema. 
Immunohistochemical analyses showed that CPs prevented enhanced expression of 
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 caused 
by DEPs in the lung injury. Numerous adducts of nitrotyrosine, N-(hexanonyl) 
lysine, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and 8-OHdG were also observed immunohistochemically 
in the lungs of mice treated with DEPs. However, these indicators of oxidative 
stress were barely visible in mice pretreated with CP supplementation. In 
addition, the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in the lung was 
decreased by CP supplementation in the presence of DEPs. These results suggest 
that CPs inhibit DEP-induced lung injury by reducing oxidative stress, in 
association with a reduction in the expression of adhesion molecules.

Furocoumarins represent a family of natural food constituents with phototoxic 
and photomutagenic properties. They are found mainly in plants belonging to the 
Rutaceae and Umbilliferae such as celery, carrots, and parsnips. Parsnips 
(Pastinaca sativa L.) have become more and more popular as a vegetable, e.g., as 
a constituent of or ingredient in baby food. Previous work has shown that 
microbial infection of parsnip roots can result in a dramatic increase in 
furocoumarin levels. In this study, freshly harvested parsnips were stored as 
whole roots, pieces (cubes), or homogenate at +4 degrees C or -18 degrees C over 
various time periods under standard conditions. It was found that furocoumarin 
concentrations (sum of five furocoumarins: angelicin, isopimpinellin, 
5-methoxypsoralen, 8-methoxypsoralen, and psoralen) in freshly harvested 
parsnips, analyzed by HPLC after extraction with diethyl ether and sequential 
solid phase (reversed-phase and silica) extraction, was generally lower than 2.5 
mg/kg, and storage of parsnips in any form investigated at -18 degrees C over up 
to 50 days did not lead to a marked increase in furocoumarin levels. In 
contrast, storage of whole parsnips, but not of cubes or homogenate, at +4 
degrees C resulted in a marked biphasic increase of furocoumarin concentrations 
after 7 and 38 days of storage up to levels of about 40 mg/kg. A dramatic 
increase in furocoumarin concentrations up to 566 mg/kg was observed when whole 
parsnips obtained from the market were kept at room temperature over 53 days, 
resulting in a visible microbial (mold) infection. Baby food products from the 
German market containing parsnips as an ingredient or constituent showed

parsnips be kept at -18 degrees C or under other conditions that prevent 
microbial infections.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the phenolic antioxidant and squalene 
content in a range of olive and seed oils. A mean of 290 +/- 38 (SEM) mg 
squalene/100 g was detected. However, while there was a weak significant 
difference between extra virgin (424 +/- 21 mg/kg) and refined virgin (340 +/- 
31 mg/100 g; P<0.05) olive oils, highly significant differences were evident 
between extra virgin olive oils (P<0.0001) refined virgin olive oils (P<0.0001) 
and seed oils (24 +/- 5 mg/100 g). While seed oils were devoid, on average, the 
olive oils contained 196 +/- 19 mg/kg total phenolics as judged by HPLC 
analysis, but the value for extra virgin (232 +/- 15 mg/kg) was significantly 
higher than that of refined virgin olive oil (62 +/- 12 mg/kg; P<0.0001). 
Appreciable quantities of simple phenols (hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol) were 
detected in olive oils, with significant differences between extravirgin (41.87 
+/- 6.17) and refined virgin olive oils (4.72 +/- 215; P<0.01). The major linked 
phenols were secoiridoids and lignans. Although extra virgin contained higher 
concentrations of secoiridoids (27.72 +/- 6.84) than refined olive oils (9.30 
+/- 3.81) this difference was not significant. On the other hand, the 
concentration of lignans was significantly higher (P<0.001) in extra virgin 
(41.53 +/- 3.93) compared to refined virgin olive oils (7.29 +/- 2.56). All 
classes of phenolics were shown to be potent antioxidants. In future 
epidemiologic studies, both the nature and source of olive oil consumed should 
be differentiated in ascertaining cancer risk.

Because olives represent an important component of the Mediterranean diet, it is 
necessary to establish unequivocal identification and quantitation of the major 
potential antioxidant phenolic compounds they contain. The major phenolic 
antioxidants in two types of brined olives were isolated and purified by 
semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography. Structural analysis was 
conducted using UV spectrophotometry, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy. In particular, completely assigned 1H and 13C NMR data 
are presented and errors in literature data are corrected. The data show that 
tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, 3-(3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid (dihydrocaffeic 
acid), dihydro-p-coumaric acid (phloretic acid), the phenylpropanoid glucosides 
acteoside (verbascoside) and isoacteoside, along with the flavonoids luteolin 
and apigenin are major components of the phenolic fraction of brined black 
olives. Brined green olives contain only hydroxytyrosol and traces of other 
minor phenolics. Brined olives contain even higher concentrations of phenolic 
antioxidants than olive oil and may, therefore, be more important modulators of 
cancer chemopreventive activity.

Several polyphenols have been tested in grape berries from Spain. The flavonoid 
content is important because of the pharmacological properties of these 
compounds, whereas resveratrol has been proved to be an antifungal, 
antiinflammatory and an anticarcinogenic compound. A reversed-phase HPLC method 
has been developed and applied to determine resveratrol, quercetine, quercitrine 
and rutine content in several grape berries samples in a single analysis. 
Covering the grapes with a preservative paper yields a healthier product, but 
one which has a lower polyphenol content than unprotected grapes.

A valid method using liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray 
ionization (ESI) ion trap mass spectrometry was established for the study of the 
absorbed and metabolic components of a Chinese medicine 'Shuangdan' granule in 
rat plasma after oral administration. The plasma samples were acidified with 1M 
hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) of two-fold volume 
for three times. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a Zorbax 
SB-C18 column with a linear gradient whereas 0.1% acetic acid/water/acetonitrile 
was used as mobile phase. Mass spectra were acquired in both negative and 
positive modes. More than 20 components including 16 components from 'Shuangdan' 
granule and 5 metabolites were simultaneously identified by comparing their mass 
spectra and retention behavior with reference compounds or literature data. The 
results proved that the established method could be used to identify the 
structure of active components responsible for the pharmacological effects of 
'Shuangdan' granule.

Antioxidant capacity and phenolic content of spinach as affected by genetics and 
maturation.

Fayetteville, AR 72704, USA.

Spinach leaves harvested at three maturity stages from eight commercial 
cultivars (CC) and eight advanced breeding lines (ABL) were evaluated for oxygen 
radical absorbing capacity (ORAC), total phenolics, and flavonoid composition 
and content. ABL had higher levels of total phenolics, total flavonoids, and 
ORAC than CC. Midmaturity spinach leaves had higher levels of total phenolics, 
total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity than immature and mature leaves. The 
contents of individual flavonoids varied in response to maturation, with the 
predominant glucuronated flavones decreasing and patuletin and spinacetin 
derivatives increasing. Both total phenolics and total flavonoids correlated 
well with ORAC (r(xy)() = 0.78 and 0.81, respectively) demonstrating that 
flavonoids were major contributors to antioxidant capacity. Our results indicate 
that spinach genotypes should be harvested at the midmaturity stage for 
consumers to benefit from elevated levels of health promoting flavonoids present 
in the leaves. Additionally, plant breeders can select for increased phenolic 
content to increase antioxidant capacity of spinach genotypes.

The effects of genetic, pre-harvest (season of harvest, spear diameter, spear 
portion and spear tip color) and post-harvest factors (storage and domestic 
preparation practices, e.g., peeling and cooking) on total phenolic, flavonoid 
and ascorbic acid content of white asparagus spears and their correlation with 
antioxidant capacity (DPPH and FRAP) were studied. Results showed that genetic 
material was important for the total phenolic content but not season of harvest, 
spear diameter or storage. Violet spear tips and apical spear portions showed 
the largest amount of total phenolics. Peeling did not affect total phenolics in 
fresh asparagus, whereas it reduced their content in stored asparagus, while 
cooking resulted in an increase in both fresh and stored asparagus. However, the 
soluble extract of total phenolics and flavonoids were minor and the missing 
significance of phenolics and flavonoids in antioxidant capacity of white 
asparagus spears depends on these small amounts.

Salamanca, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, Salamanca 37007, Spain.

An HPLC method, using detection after postcolumn derivatization with 
p-dimethylaminocynnamaldehyde (DMACA), was developed for the quantitative 
analysis of individual flavanols in food. This method was applied to flavanol 
determination in 56 different kinds of Spanish food products, including fruit, 
vegetables, legumes, beverages (cider, coffee, beer, tea, and wine), and 
chocolate. The determined compounds corresponded to the catechins and 
proanthocyanidin dimers and trimers usually present in food and, therefore, they 
were representative of the flavanols of low degree of polymerization consumed 
with the diet. The data generated could be used for calculation of the dietary 
intake of either individual or total flavanols, which would allow the further 
establishment of epidemiological correlations with the incidence of chronic 
diseases. Similar flavanol profiles were found in the different samples of a 
similar type of product, even though important variations could exist in the 
concentrations of total and individual flavanols among them. This was attributed 
to factors such as sample origin, stage of ripeness, post-harvesting 
conservation, and processing. Total flavanol contents varied from nondetectable 
in most of the vegetables to 184 mg/100 g found in a sample of broad bean. 
Substantial amounts were also found in some fruits, such as plum and apple, as 
well as in tea and red wine. Epicatechin was the most abundant flavanol, 
followed by catechin and procyanidin B2. In general, catechins were found in all 
the flavanol-containing products, but the presence of gallocatechins was only 
relevant in pomegranate, broad bean, lentil, grape, wine, beer, and tea, and 
most of the berries. Galloyled flavanols were only detected in strawberry, 
medlar, grape, and tea.

The aim of this study was to quantify the contents of individual quercetin 
glycosides in red, yellow and chartreuse onion by High Performance Liquid 
Chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Acid hydrolysis of individual quercetin 
glycosides using 6 M hydrochloric acid guided to identify and separate quercetin 
7,4'-diglucoside, quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin 4'-glucoside, and quercetin. 
The contents of total quercetin glycosides varied extensively among three 
varieties (ranged from 16.10 to 103.93 mg/g DW). Quercetin was the predominant 
compound that accounted mean 32.21 mg/g DW in red onion (43.6% of the total) and 
127.92 mg/g DW in chartreuse onion (78.3% of the total) followed by quercetin 
3-glucoside (28.83 and 24.16 mg/g DW) respectively. Quercetin 3-glucoside levels 
were much higher in yellow onion (43.85 mg/g DW) followed by quercetin 
30.08 mg/g DW. Quercetin 4'-glucoside documented the lowest amount that 
documented mean 2.4% of the total glycosides. The varied contents of glycosides 
present in the different onion varieties were significant.

Polyphenol content and total antioxidant activity of vini novelli (young red 
wines).

Pellegrini N(1), Simonetti P, Gardana C, Brenna O, Brighenti F, Pietta P.

(1)Department of Food Science and Microbiology, University of Milan, Italy.

Eight commercial Italian vini novelli (red wines prepared by carbonic maceration 
and supposed to be consumed within three months from their wine-making) were 
evaluated for their total antioxidant activity. The wines had an average total 
phenol content (1605.4 +/- 337.4 mg/L gallic acid equivalents) lower than that 
of wines prepared by traditional maceration and consumable after aging (2057. 3 
+/- 524.0 mg/L gallic acid equivalents). The average flavanol content (424.7 +/- 
121.3 mg/L catechin equivalents) and the total antioxidant activity (16.8 +/- 
3.8 mmol/L Trolox equivalents) of vini novelli were higher than the 
corresponding values (382.7 +/- 174.5 mg/L catechin equivalents and 12.3 +/- 3.3 
mmol/L Trolox equivalents) found for aged wines. Three couples of experimental 
wines were prepared from the same grapes by traditional or carbonic maceration. 
These wines showed a different phenolic pattern, anthocyanins being more 
abundant in vini novelli. However, the average total antioxidant activities of 
the wines were similar, suggesting that aging (and not the wine-making 
technique) is the main factor influencing the antioxidant activity of red wines.

The optimization and validation of a protocol for the quantification of six 
dietary lignans, i.e., secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, lariciresinol, 
pinoresinol, medioresinol, and syringaresinol, in food are presented. The method 
incorporates isotope dilution to ensure correct accuracy and precision, 
introducing the utilization of individual stable 13C3-labeled lignans. To 
demonstrate the potential of this new method, preliminary results of the levels 
of dietary lignans in selected foods are presented. It is concluded that the 
method fulfils the reliability criteria and can be applied to the analysis of 
the most common lignans in human food, being an essential asset to establish the 
intake of lignans in a determined population and their relation with disease 
prevention.

Lignans constitute a group of phytochemicals widely distributed in the human 
diet. Once ingested, most dietary lignans are metabolized by the gut microflora 
to enterolactone and enterodiol, also known as enterolignans. Together with 
isoflavones and coumestrol, enterolignans have been traditionally classified as 
phytoestrogens, plant-derived compounds that exhibit estrogen-like activity. In 
addition to a higher intake of vegetables, many studies have suggested that the 
presence of phytoestrogens in the Japanese diet is one of the factors that might 
explain the reduced incidence of certain chronic diseases in Japanese 
populations compared with Western countries. Being a vegetable-based diet, 
exposure to dietary lignans should be high, but to assess this exposure, a 
lignan food database is required. Stable isotope-dilution gas chromatography 
coupled with mass spectrometry was used to quantify six plant lignans in 86 food 
items commonly consumed in Japan. These data will complement the previous 
databases and most importantly expand the knowledge of occurrence of lignans in 
food to Eastern diets.

Influence of storage upon light-induced chlorogenic acid accumulation in potato 
tubers (Solanum tuberosum L.).

Percival GC(1), Baird L.

United Kingdom. G.Percival@au.sac.ac.uk

The influence of 2 weeks and 3 months of dark storage upon light-induced 
chlorogenic acid accumulation within tuber tissue of four potato cultivars and 
upon 5-, 4-, and 3-caffeoylquinic acid concentrations within cv. King Edward was 
determined. Storage period significantly affected (P < 0.05) the magnitude of 
the light-induced chlorogenic acid response with accumulation rates 3-4 times 
higher in tubers exposed to light after 2 weeks compared with those placed under 
light after 3 months. Comparison of chlorogenic acid concentrations in controls 
after 2 and 3 months of dark storage indicated that tuber chlorogenic 
concentrations decline during prolonged cold store at 5 degrees C. Rates of 
accumulation in response to light were cultivar-dependent with cv. Fianna the 
most light-sensitive and cv. Maris Piper relatively light-insensitive. In 
virtually all cases exposure to sodium and fluorescent light promoted higher 
rates of accumulation than did exposure to high-pressure mercury light sources. 
Chlorogenic acid values steadily increased over 15 days of illumination with, in 
the majority of cases, no indication of cessation. Light exposure increased 5-, 
4-, and 3-caffeoylquinic acid accumulation rates in cv. King Edward. 
Irrespective of storage period and light source, ratios of 
5-:4-:3-caffeoylquinic acid were ca. 85:15:0 at day 0 and 52:42:6 by day 15.

Literature data may underestimate the actual antioxidant capacity of cereals.

de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC), c/José Antonio Novais, 10, Ciudad 
Universitaria, Madrid, 28040 Spain.

Several recent articles have reported a significant antioxidant capacity of 
cereal products, determined in methanolic and ethanolic extracts. The aim of 
this work was to conduct an assessment of the antioxidant capacity of cereals 
using both chemical and in vitro digestive enzymatic extraction of antioxidants. 
Ferric reducing power (FRAP) and free radical scavenging capacity (DPPH) methods 
were used to determine the antioxidant capacity in wheat flour, bread, raw and 
boiled rice, wheat bran, and oat bran. The most efficient antioxidant extraction 
was achieved by using successively acidic methanol/water (50:50 v/v, pH 2) and 
acetone/water (70:30 v/v). The antioxidant capacity in these extracts ranged 
from 1.1 to 4.4 micromol Trolox/g dw. A significant amount of hydrolyzable 
phenolics with a high antioxidant capacity (from 5 to 108 micromol Trolox/g dw) 
was found in the residues of this aqueous-organic extraction. The antioxidant 
capacities of these nonextractable polyphenols are usually ignored in the 
literature, although they may have an antioxidant role in the gastrointestinal 
tract, especially after colonic fermentation, and may be fermentated to active 
metabolites. On the other hand, in vitro digestive enzymatic extracts obtained 
by enzymatic treatments that mimic conditions in the gastrointestinal tract 
showed that the amount of antioxidants released by the cereal matrix into the 
human intestine may be higher than the one that can be expected from 
measurements in the usual aqueous-organic extracts.

volatile acidities, pH, alcoholic, total polyphenol, and acidic polysaccharide 
contents, nonvolatile acids, polyalcohols, residual sugars, and major volatile 
compounds. A partial least-squares regression analysis (PLR-1) was performed to 
correlate the chemical composition and the origin of the raw material, the cider 
samples being grouped into two categories: an ""odd"" class, cider made from 
foreign apples (1995 and 1997), and an ""even"" class, ciders made from Asturian 
apples (1996 and 1998). The mathematical model has a multiple linear correlation

Prunes, which are industrially obtained by dehydrating fresh plums at 85-90 
degrees C for 18 h, contain higher levels of phenolic compounds than most other 
fruits. Prune phenolics have shown beneficial effects on human health. Reports 
are available in the literature on ascorbic acid, phenol composition, and 
antioxidant activity of fresh plums and prunes, but there is a lack of 
publications on the influence of drying parameters on the phenolic compounds and 
antioxidant activity. A study was carried out on two plum cultivars using two 
sets of air-drying temperatures: (i) air temperature at 85 degrees C until 50% 
of prune moisture level and then the temperature was lowered to 70 degrees C; 
(ii) air temperature at 60 degrees C. Whole fresh and dried fruits were assessed 
for phenolics (catechins, hydroxycinnamic acids, anthocyanins, and flavonols), 
ascorbic acid, and antioxidant activity (all parameters were calculated on a dry 
matter basis). Analysis of data shows that chlorogenic and neochlorogenic acid 
changes were affected by both process parameters and cultivar. Drying destroyed 
anthocyanins, and there was a significant decrease in flavonols. Ascorbic acid 
was drastically reduced in relation to process temperature. The most striking 
result was that drying at 85 degrees C doubled antioxidant activity in both 
cultivars, while contradictory results were found for 60 degrees C processed 
plums.

A dispersive solid phase extraction-high performance liquid chromatographic 
(HPLC) method was established for the simultaneous determination of 2,4-D, 
thiabendazole, 2-naphthol, o-phenyl phenol, diphenyl ether and biphenyl in the 
fruits and vegetables. The samples were vortexed for extraction with 
acetonitrile containing sodium chloride and anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The 
acetonitrile extraction was purified by acidic alumina dispersed solid phase 
extraction. The analysis was performed on an Agilent TC C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 
mm, 5 microm) and an ultraviolet detector at 235 nm with a mobile phase of 
methanol-0.02 mol/L (pH 6) potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution, at a flow 
rate of 1.0 mL/min with gradient elution. Good linearities were observed in the 
range of 0.5-20 mg/L with correlation coefficients greater than 0.99. The 
average recoveries of the six preservatives in fruits and vegetables were in the 
range of 84.2% -99. 1% at three spiked levels of 1, 2 and 10 mg/kg (n = 6) and 
the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were in the range of 1.67%-10.3%. The 
limits of quantification were 1 mg/kg. This method is simple, accurate and 
suitable for the determination of the six preservatives in fruits and 
vegetables.

The physicochemical properties of apple juice from 13 apple varieties were 
correlated with the structural features of isolated apple pectin populations. 
Mathematical models explaining these structural properties, revealed variations 
in pectins as present in alcohol insoluble solids (AIS), water-soluble solids 
(WSS), and chelating soluble solids (ChSS). Significant differences in turbidity 
(89.00-4129 NTU), particle size (59.75-218.01 μm in D[4, 3]), and titratable 
acid (0.13 to 0.90 %) were observed, while pH, total soluble solids, and 
ζ-potential showed less variation. Juice yield (54.85-63.35 %) was inversely 
correlated with AIS, WSS, and ChSS content. Juice ζ-potential was positively 
correlated with the degree of methyl-esterification, methyl-ester distribution 
patterns, and the side chain sugar ratios of WSS pectin fractions. Juice quality 
as represented by juice clarity, texture and stability was significantly 
influenced by the diverse structure's features like sugar composition, 
methyl-esterification level and distribution of endogenous pectin. A partial 
least squares (PLS) regression model effectively predicted juice properties 
based on pectin characteristics. These findings underscore the importance of 
pectin structure in determining apple juice quality and provide a valuable 
framework for the juice industry to enhance quality control and inform cultivar 
selection.

Investigation of the metabolic fate of dihydrocaffeic acid.

Poquet L(1), Clifford MN, Williamson G.

Author information:

The antioxidant dihydrocaffeic acid is a dietary constituent and a microbial 
metabolite of flavonoids. Orally administered to rats, dihydrocaffeic acid was 
very rapidly absorbed most probably by the gastric or duodenal epithelium and 
excreted in urine as free and conjugated forms. LC-MS2 analysis of plasma and 
urine samples allowed confident identification of the dihydrocaffeic acid 
metabolites. The parent compound was glucuronidated, sulphated or methylated, on 
one of the hydroxyl groups present on its phenyl ring. All the dihydrocaffeic 
acid metabolites peaked in plasma within the first 30min following ingestion, 
suggesting a metabolism possibly by the gastric or duodenal cells and by the 
liver. Using in vitro and ex vivo models of the intestinal epithelium and the 
liver, the identity and source of the metabolites detected in vivo were 
examined. The data obtained suggest that, in rats, intestinal cells are more 
able to glucuronidate dihydrocaffeic acid, whereas liver favours sulphation. 
Moreover, glucuronidation, sulphation and methylation seem to be 
regio-selective, preferably on the 3-OH of dihydrocaffeic acid. The methyl 
conjugate, dihydroferulic acid, was shown to be oxidized into ferulic acid by 
intestinal and hepatic cells, which were also able to perform the reverse 
reaction, the reduction of ferulic acid into dihydroferulic acid. As a 
conclusion, the main form of dihydrocaffeic acid circulating in plasma after its 
ingestion is a mixture of different primary and secondary metabolites.

Puerarin (daidzein-8-C-glucoside) is the major bioactive isoflavone of kudzu 
root (the root of Pueraria lobata). Its metabolic fate, however, is not 
well-known. In this study, a sensitive and specific LC-ESI-MS/MS method for the 
determination of puerarin and its metabolites daidzein, dihydrodaidzein, and 
equol was developed for their analysis in biological samples. Two new 
metabolites of puerarin, mono- and dihydroxylated derivatives, were detected in 
the urine and feces of rats after oral administration. The persistence of 
puerarin in blood and urine as the principal metabolic form for the period of 
4-72 h after oral administration suggested that puerarin is rapidly absorbed 
from the intestine without metabolism. Its presence in organs such as the brain 
suggests that this glucoside may enter tissues by specific transport pathways. 
Study of these metabolites may provide further understanding of the health 
beneficial effects of puerarin in kudzu dietary supplements.

Proanthocyanidin rich plant extracts derived from grape seed extract (GSE), 
hawthorn and cranberry are on markets for their preventive effects against 
cardiovascular diseases and uroinfections in woman. However, the importance of 
these health beneficial effects of these botanicals remains elusive due to 
incomplete understanding of uptake, metabolism and bioavailability of 
proanthocyanidins in vivo. In the present study rats were given GSE orally (300 
mg/kg, twice a day) and blood and urine were collected over a 24 h period. 
Monomeric catechins and their methylated metabolites, and proanthocyanidins up 
to trimers were detected in blood samples treated with GSE using LC-MS/MS 
operating in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. A new tetramethylated 
metabolite of dimeric proanthocyanidin (m/z 633) in GSE-treated urine was 
tentatively identified. Using LC-MS/MS, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were 
identified in the brain conclusively. These data suggested that GSE catechins 
cross the blood brain barrier and may be responsible for the neuroprotective 
effects of GSE.

Dietary polyphenolics can be converted into smaller phenolic acids (PA) by 
microorganisms in the colon and may contribute to health benefits associated 
with the parent polyphenolics. Urinary excretion of 18 PA and their conjugates 
was studied, using HPLC-MS/MS, in rats fed AIN93G-based diets containing 5% (dry 
weight basis) of either cranberry (CB), blueberry (BB), or black raspberry 
(BRB). Hippuric, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic, and 
4-hydroxybenzoic acids were excreted in greatest quantity in the urine over a 24 
h period in all diets. Primary PA excreted in the berry diets were 
4-hydroxycinnamic acid for CB; chlorogenic, ferulic, and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic 
acids for BB; and 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic, 3-hydroxybenzoic, and 
3-hydroxycinnamic acids for BRB. PA were present in conjugated form with 
cinnamic acid derivatives being 50-70% and phenylacetic acid derivatives 
conjugated <10%. Conjugated, and not just the free, PA are significant 
contributors to total urinary excretion.

Extracts of aromatic plants of Greek origin were examined as potential sources 
of phenolic compounds. RP-HPLC with UV detection was employed for the 
identification and quantification of the phenolic antioxidants, present in 
methanolic extracts. The most abundant phenolic acids were ferulic acid (1.1-280 
mg/100 g of dry sample) and caffeic acid (1.2-60 mg/100 g of dry sample). 
(+)-Catechin and quercetin were the most abundant flavonoids. Apigenin and 
luteolin were detected in high amounts in Menta pulegium and Thymus vulgaris, 
respectively. The antioxidant capacity was determined, in dried ground plants 
and in their methanol extracts, with the Rancimat test using sunflower oil as 
substrate. Both pulverized plants and extracts showed antioxidant capacity. 
Total phenolic content in the extracts was determined spectrometrically 
according to the Folin-Ciocalteu assay and ranged from 1 to 21 mg of gallic 
acid/100 g of dry sample. Antimicrobial activity of the extracts against 
selected microbes was also conducted in this study.

To fully investigate the effects of heat treatment on proteins and lipids in 
sheep milk, lipidomics and Astral-DIA proteomics combined with parallel reaction 
monitoring methods were used to analyze the changes of lipids and proteins after 
heat treatment at 65 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 15 s. A total of 79 and 381 
differential lipids and proteins were identified respectively. Lipidomics 
results show that Triacylglycerol (16:1_17:1_16:2) was unique in raw milk, 
whereas diacylglycerol (20:1_22:1) was unique in 95 °C group. Choline metabolism 
in cancer was the core metabolic pathway linked with heat treatment. 
Additionally, the collagen alpha-3(VI) chain protein (COL6A3), folate 
receptor-like domain-containing protein (FOLR1), and serpin domain-containing 
protein (JEQ12_008015) gradually disappeared with increasing heating 
temperature. The differentially expressed proteins were mainly associated with 
metabolic pathways. These analysis provide scientific connotation for the 
production of high quality dairy products and the healthy development of the 
dairy industry.

Virgin olive oils from percolation (first extraction) have been compared with 
the corresponding oils from centrifugation (second extraction). The former were 
characterized by (i) higher contents of total phenols, o-diphenols, 
hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol-aglycons, tocopherols, trans-2-hexenal, total volatiles, 
and waxes; (ii) higher values of resistance to autoxidation and of turbidity; 
(iii) higher sensory scores; (iv) higher ratios of campesterol/stigmasterol, 
trans-2-hexenal/hexanal, and trans-2-hexenal/total volatiles; (v) lower contents 
of chlorophylls, pheophytins, sterols, and aliphatic and triterpene alcohols; 
(vi) lower alcoholic index and color indices; (vii) similar values of acidity, 
peroxide index, and UV (ultraviolet) spectrophotometric indices; (viii) similar 
percentages of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, triglycerides, and 
diglycerides; and (ix) similar values of glyceridic indices. Stigmastadienes, 
trans-oleic, trans-linoleic, and trans-linolenic acid isomers were not detected 
in the two genuine oil kinds. Hence, the qualitative level of the first 
extraction oil was superior to the second extraction one.

Extraction, resolution, and determination of the trans-hydroxycinnamic acids 
(caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic) were performed in 82 orange juices 
derived from the most important blood and blond varieties grown in Italy. 
Soluble solids, acidity, and anthocyanins were also determined. Hydroxycinnamic 
acids were more abundant in blood orange than in blond juices. Ferulic acid was 
the major component in all cases, but the distribution of the four acids was 
typical in each variety. Discriminant analysis of the experimental results 
showed that these acids could be used as markers of blood and blond varieties. 
The statistical model was used to recognize some mixtures of blood and blond 
juices.

Several fresh orange juices, obtained from five different Citrus sinensis (L.) 
Osbeck varieties (three pigmented varieties, Moro, Sanguinello, and Tarocco, and 
two blond varieties, Valencia late and Washington navel), were subjected to 
antioxidant profile determination (including total polyphenols, flavanones, 
anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, and ascorbic acid). The antioxidant 
activity of these juices was then assessed by means of different ""in vitro"" 
tests (bleaching of the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical; 
peroxidation, induced by the water-soluble radical initiator 
2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride, on mixed 
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/linoleic acid unilamellar vesicles; scavenging 
activity against nitric oxide; total antioxidant status). All orange juices 
tested showed an evident antioxidant effect. Our findings indicate the 
following: (1) the antioxidant efficiency of orange juices may be attributed, in 
a significant part at least, to their content of total phenols, (2) while 
ascorbic acid seems to play a minor role; (3) the antioxidant activity of orange 
juices is related not only to structural features of phytochemicals contained in 
them, but also to their capability to interact with biomembranes; (4) finally, 
as to pigmented juices, their antioxidant efficiency appears to be widely 
influenced by the anthocyanin level. One could speculate that the supply of 
natural antioxidant phenols through daily consumption of orange juice might 
provide additional protection against in vivo oxidation of cellular 
biomolecules.

Quantitative analysis of anthocyanins was performed on a series of blood orange 
juices according to various spectrophotometric and HPLC methods, and the causes 
for different concentration resulting from the application of such procedures 
were investigated. Spectrophotometric methods utilizing aqueous ethanol as a 
solvent provided an anthocyanin content higher than that determined by HPLC. 
Discrepancies were ascribed to the use of impure standards and/or unsuitable 
calibration lines. The most consistent results with the HPLC findings were 
obtained by a method utilizing water as a solvent and cyanidin-3-glucoside as a 
standard. Actual concentration of anthocyanins in blood orange juice was 
remarkably lower than that currently determined by procedures used in the juice 
producing factories.

A study was conducted to determine the presence of resveratrol, pterostilbene, 
and piceatannol in Vaccinium berries. Samples representing selections and 
cultivars of 10 species from Mississippi, North Carolina, Oregon, and Canada 
were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Resveratrol was found in

Vaccinium ashei (rabbiteye blueberry), Vaccinium corymbosum (highbush 
blueberry), Vaccinium elliottii (Elliott's blueberry), Vaccinium macrocarpon 
(cranberry), Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry), Vaccinium stamineum (deerberry), 
Vaccinium vitis-ideae var. vitis-ideae (lingonberry), and Vaccinium vitis-ideae 
var. minor (partridgeberry) at levels between 7 and 5884 ng/g dry sample. 
Lingonberry was found to have the highest content, 5884 ng/g dry sample, 
comparable to that found in grapes, 6471 ng/g dry sample. Pterostilbene was 
found in two cultivars of V. ashei and in V. stamineum at levels of 99-520 ng/g 
dry sample. Piceatannol was found in V. corymbosum and V. stamineum at levels of 
138-422 ng/g dry sample. These naturally occurring stilbenes, known to be strong 
antioxidants and to have cancer chemopreventive activities, will add to the 
purported health benefits derived from the consumption of these small fruits.

Tea is a complex mixture containing a range of compounds from simple phenolics 
to complex thearubigins, many of which have well-recognized antioxidant 
properties. This paper describes the application of high-performance liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS(n)) methods for the rapid and routine 
analysis of more than 30 phenolics in tea. Green and black tea infusions were 
injected directly onto a reversed phase HPLC column, and the phenolics eluted 
using two different mobile phase gradients, one optimized to resolve catechin 
derivatives and the other, flavonols and theaflavins. Compounds, identified on 
the basis of their retention time, absorbance spectrum, and MS fragmentation 
pattern, included (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, theaflavin and their various 
gallate derivatives, quercetin and kaempferol mono-, di-, and triglycosides, 
quinic acid esters of gallic acid and hydroxycinnamates, and the purine 
alkaloids, caffeine and theobromine.

BACKGROUND: Proanthocyanidins, the most abundant polyphenols in chocolate, are 
not depolymerized in the stomach and reach the small intestine intact, where 
they are hardly absorbed because of their high molecular weight. In vitro and in 
vivo studies using pure compounds as substrates suggest that proanthocyanidins 
and the related catechin monomers may be degraded into more bioavailable 
low-molecular-weight phenolic acids by the microflora in the colon.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the amounts of phenolic acids 
formed by the microflora and excreted in the urine of human subjects after 
consumption of polyphenol-rich chocolate.
DESIGN: After consumption of a polyphenol-free diet for 2 d and a subsequent 
overnight fast, 11 healthy subjects (7 men and 4 women) consumed 80 g chocolate 
containing 439 mg proanthocyanidins and 147 mg catechin monomers. All urine was 
collected during the 24 h before chocolate consumption and at 3, 6, 9, 24, and 
48 h after chocolate consumption. Aromatic acids were identified in urine by gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry and were quantified by HPLC-electrospray 
ionization tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Chocolate intake increased the urinary excretion of the 6 following 
phenolic acids: m-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, ferulic acid, 
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, m-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, vanillic acid, and 
m-hydroxybenzoic acid.
CONCLUSION: The antioxidant and biological effects of chocolate may be explained 
not solely by the established absorption of catechin monomers but also by the 
absorption of microbial phenolic acid metabolites.

Beers are a source of dietary flavonoids; however, there exist differences in 
composition, alcohol concentration, and beneficial activities. To characterize 
these differences, three kinds of lager beer of habitual consumption in Spain, 
dark, blond, and alcohol-free, were assayed for total phenolic content, 
antioxidant activity, superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities, and 
in vitro inhibitory effect on DNA oxidative damage. Furthermore, their 
melanoidin content and correlation with antioxidant activity were evaluated. 
Dark beer contained the highest total phenolic (489 +/- 52 mg/L) and melanoidin 
(1.49 +/- 0.02 g/L) contents with a 2-fold difference observed when compared to 
the alcohol-free beer. For the three kinds of beer, the antioxidant activity 
measured as N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride concentration was 
strongly correlated with the total polyphenol content (R(2) = 0.91102, p < 
0.005) and with the melanoidin content (R(2) = 0.7999, p < 0.05). The results 
support a positive effect of beers on the protection of DNA oxidative damage, by 
decreasing the deoxyribose degradation, DNA scission (measured by 
electrophoresis), and inhibition of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) formation. 
Furthermore, a correlation between the total melanoidin content (R(2) = 0.7309, 
p < 0.01) and inhibition of 8-OH-dG was observed.

A quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection 
method separating 16 phenolic acids was achieved. Six columns and several mobile 
phases were investigated. Resolution was achieved with a high-purity silica 
Phenomenex Luna C18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm) and a binary gradient 
consisting of CH3OH-water (with 0.1% formic acid) and flow rate set at 0.7 
ml/min. Acids were detected and quantitation performed at wavelength 
representing the lowest energy lambda(max) for individual acids. Extraction 
procedure from wine was optimized and yields ranged from 79 to 87% based on 
internal standard recovery. To confirm our quantitative results, identical 
samples were analyzed both in-house and by a collaborating laboratory. 
Correlation of two data sets generated linear regression equations that 
approached unity (0.93-0.98) and R2 values ranging from 0.990 to 0.999.

A two-level Plackett-Burman design with 8 variables was used to evaluate 
ultrasonic treatment variables influencing the total phenolic content (TPC) 
extracted from asparagus roots. Steepest ascent method was conducted to identify 
the significance of parameters such as extraction temperature, stirring speed, 
intermission time, extraction time, ultrasonic frequency, and ultrasonic power. 
Ethanol and methanol aqueous solutions were used as extraction solvents and 
solvent's concentration, extraction time, ultrasonic power and solid: liquid 
ratio were optimized in this study. A predicted value of TPC (71.1 mg/g) was 
obtained under the optimum conditions of extraction time 120 min, ultrasonic 
power 550 W, ethanol concentration of 20% and a solid: liquid ratio of 1:100. 
Central composite design was employed to further analyse the common interactions 
between the extraction variables and to further determine the optimal values 
that would generate the maximum TPC, total flavonoids content, total saponins 
content, caffeic acid and in vitro antioxidant activities. The optimal variables 
for ethanol extraction (80 min, 50% of ethanol, 360 W and 1:40) generated higher 
than methanol (410 W for 114.9 min using 73.7% methanol at 1:24).

Phenolic compounds including phenolic aldehydes, acids and flavonoids are 
separated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with analysis time 
shorter than described in the literature. The use of a fluorescence detector in 
series with absorbance detector allowed increasing selectivity and sensitivity 
for the determination of catechin, vanillic acid, syringic acid, epicatechin and 
trans-resveratrol in wine samples. An optimised sample preparation method using 
liquid-liquid extraction with diethyl ether at pH 2.0 was used. The optimised 
method was applied to analyse wine samples with good results.

Grapevine stilbenes are a family of polyphenols which derive from 
trans-resveratrol having antifungal and antimicrobial properties, thus being 
considered as phytoalexins. In addition to their diverse bioactive properties in 
animal models, they highlight a strong potential in human health maintenance and 
promotion. Due to this relevance, highly-specific qualitative and quantitative 
methods of analysis are necessary to accurately analyze stilbenes in different 
matrices derived from grapevine. Here, we developed a rapid, sensitive, and 
specific analysis method using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography 
coupled to triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ) in MRM mode to detect 
and quantify five grapevine stilbenes, trans-resveratrol, trans-piceid, 
trans-piceatannol, trans-pterostilbene, and trans-ε-viniferin, whose interest in 
relation to human health is continuously growing. The method was optimized to 
minimize in-source fragmentation of piceid and to avoid co-elution of cis-piceid 
and trans-resveratrol, as both are detected with resveratrol transitions. The 
applicability of the developed method of stilbene analysis was tested 
successfully in different complex matrices including cellular extracts of Vitis 
vinifera cell cultures, reaction media of biotransformation assays, and red 
wine.

In this study polyphenolic compounds extracted from olive fruits of five 
registered cultivars were analyzed. A solid-liquid extraction (LSE) procedure 
with Extrelut cartridge (diatomaceous earth) using different eluents was 
developed to obtain polyphenolic compounds. HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS methods were 
applied for the quali-quantitative analysis of each fraction obtained from LSE. 
The results of this work show that the LSE procedure with diatomaceous earth 
cartridge supplies a rapid and reproducible fractioning method able to obtain a 
quantitative recovery of all compounds and to collect fractions directly 
analyzed by HPLC. A comparison among different cultivars shows significant 
quantitative differences in some polyphenols, such as verbascoside, anthocyanic 
compounds, and oleuropein derivatives.

The flavonoid composition of three phenotypes of ""Zolfino"" landraces, a typical 
bean grown in Tuscany, has been elucidated by means of HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS 
analysis. Flavonols, isoflavones, and anthocyanins have been separated and 
determined in the different samples chosen on the basis of their seed coat 
color. A flavonol that has not been previously found in Phaseolus vulgaris L. 
seeds has been characterized. The quantitative data show the presence of 
flavonols (ranging from 709 to 118 mg/kg of fresh weight), isoflavones (ranging 
from 14 to 2 mg/kg of fresh weight), and anthocyanins, in black beans only. 
These results show that this genotype could be very interesting from a 
nutritional point of view.

Hydroxytyrosol 4-beta-D-glucoside, an important phenolic compound in olive 
fruits and derived products.

García Tejero 4, 41012 Sevilla, Spain. crb@cica.es

There is increasing interest in olive polyphenols because of their biological 
properties as well as their contribution to the color, taste, and shelf life of 
olive products. However, some of these compounds remain unidentified. It has 
been shown that hydroxytyrosol 4-beta-D-glucoside 
(4-beta-D-glucosyl-3-hydroxyphenylethanol) coeluted with hydroxytyrosol 
[(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol] under reversed phase conditions in the phenolic 
chromatograms of olive pulp, vegetation water, and pomace of olive oil 
processing. A method to separate this compound from hydroxytyrosol by HPLC has 
been developed. The concentration of this glucoside increased in olive pulp with 
maturation and could be the main phenolic compound in mature olives. In 
contrast, the presence of this compound was not detected in olive oil by using 
HPLC-MS. The compound must be considered both in table olives and olive oil 
processing because of its glucose and hydroxytyrosol contribution to these 
products.

Barcelona, Spain.

The levels of trans-piceid, cis-piceid, trans-resveratrol, and cis-resveratrol 
have been measured in 36 grape juices using an HPLC system with spectral 
analysis of eluting peaks. The piceid (glucosides) were the major component in 
the grape juices. In red grape juices the average concentrations were 3.38 mg/L 
for trans-piceid, 0.79 mg/L for cis-piceid, 0.50 mg/L for trans-resveratrol, and 
0.06 mg/L for cis-resveratrol. In white grape juices the levels were, on 
average, 0.18 mg/L for trans-piceid, 0.26 mg/L for cis-piceid, and 0.05 mg/L for 
trans-resveratrol, and cis-resveratrol was not detected in any sample. Levels of 
total resveratrol (trans- and cis-resveratrol and -piceid) found in red and in 
white grape juices are similar to those described in Spanish red and white 
wines. Due to their resveratrol content, as well as other phenolics, grape 
juices may have a beneficial health effect of interest to those who cannot drink 
wine.

Yoghurt impacts on the excretion of phenolic acids derived from colonic 
breakdown of orange juice flavanones in humans.

Roowi S(1), Mullen W, Edwards CA, Crozier A.

Author information:

Glasgow, UK.

Human urine was collected over a 24 h period after the consumption of 250 mL of 
(i) water, (ii) orange juice, and (iii) orange juice plus 150 mL of full fat 
natural yoghurt. The orange juice contained 168 micromol of 
hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside and 18 micromol of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside. GC-MS 
analysis of the urine identified nine phenolic acids, five of which, 
3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylhydracrylic acid, dihydroferulic 
acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylhydracrylic acid and 3-hydroxyhippuric acid, were 
associated with orange juice consumption indicating that they were derived from 
colonic catabolism of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside. The overall 0-24 h excretion of 
the five phenolic acids was 6.7 +/- 1.8 micromol after drinking water and this 
increased significantly (p < 0.05) to 62 +/- 18 micromol, equivalent to 37% of 
the ingested flavanones, following orange juice consumption. When the orange 
juice was ingested with yoghurt excretion fell back markedly to 9.3 +/- 4.4 
micromol. This was not due to a difference in mouth to caecum transit time, as 
measured with breath hydrogen production, though possibly there may have been a 
slowing of the bulk of the meal reaching the large intestine which may then have 
altered the catabolism of the flavanones to phenolic acids by the colonic 
microbiota.

Bioavailability and catabolism of green tea flavan-3-ols in humans.

Del Rio D(1), Calani L, Cordero C, Salvatore S, Pellegrini N, Brighenti F.

Author information:
(1)Department of Public Health, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate green tea flavan-3-ol 
catabolism and plasma pharmacokinetic and urinary excretion by high-performance 
liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry to evaluate their absolute 
bioavailability by taking into account all known and some unknown catabolites 
deriving from their interaction with the gastrointestinal tract and its host 
microflora.
METHODS: A feeding study was carried out in 20 healthy human volunteers who 
ingested 400 mL of a ready-to-drink green tea containing approximately 400 μmol 
of flavan-3-ols. Urine and plasma were collected for 4 and 24h, respectively, 
and 39 relevant catabolites were identified in these biological fluids by tandem 
mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: In biological fluids, 39 relevant flavan-3-ol catabolites were 
identified. In plasma, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate was the only unmetabolized 
compound and the highest in absolute concentration compared with 
(-)-epigallocatechin and (-)-epicatechin conjugates. Colonic microflora-derived 
polyhydroxyphenyl-γ-valerolactones were by far the main urinary catabolites, 
averaging 10 times greater concentratin than flavan-3-ol conjugates. The 
calculated bioavailability was equal to 39% and it is interesting to notice the 
great variability in urinary excretion of colonic metabolites among 
participants, probably related to differences in their own colonic microflora.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that green tea catechins are more 
bioavailable than previously observed when colonic ring fission metabolites are 
taken into consideration. Regular consumption of ready-to-drink green tea 
containing flavan-3-ols allows a non-marginal exposure of the human body to 
these catabolites, somehow justifying the numerous beneficial actions described 
as linked to green tea intake.

Variance of common flavonoids by brand of grapefruit juice.

Ross SA(1), Ziska DS, Zhao K, ElSohly MA.

Author information:
(1)The National Center for Natural Products Research, Research Institute of 
Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mississippi, MS 38677, USA.

Nine commercial brands of grapefruit juice were analyzed for their flavonoid 
content by HPLC to determine if significant brand-to-brand variance in 
grapefruit juice flavonoid content exists. Flavonoid glycosides narirutin, 
naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, didymin, and poncirin have been identified 
in all the grapefruit juices examined. The aglycone quercetin was detected in 
only two brands. All the juices were free from methoxylated flavonoid aglycones. 
There was a significant difference in the amounts of total flavonoids and 
individual flavonoids in the nine brands. The concentration of total flavonoids 
ranged between 19.44 and 84.28 mg/100 ml juice. Naringin was found to be the 
major flavonoid followed by narirutin and hesperidin. Their concentrations 
ranged from 14.56 to 63.8; 2.25 to 12.20; and 0.24 to 3.12 mg/100 ml juice, 
respectively.

The alkylresorcinol content and homologue composition in selected Polish rye and 
wheat cultivars and selected whole-grain cereal products were determined in this 
study. Cereal grains and whole-grain cereal products were extracted with 
acetone, whereas bread types were extracted with hot 1-propanol. The average 
alkylresorcinol content in tested rye (approximately 1100 mg/kg DM) and wheat 
(approximately 800 mg/kg DM) grains harvested in Poland was within the range 
previously reported in Swedish and Finnish samples. The total alkylresorcinol 
content in tested cereal products available on the Polish market varied from 
very low levels in barley grain-based foods up to 3000 mg/kg DM in wheat bran. 
The total alkylresorcinol content in 14 bread samples extracted with hot 
1-propanol varied from approximately 100 mg/kg DM in whole bread made with honey 
up to approximately 650 mg/kg DM in whole-rye bread. Calculated ratios of C17:0 
to C21:0 homologues, a useful parameter previously used to distinguish between 
rye and wheat cereals and their derived products, was about 1.2-1.4 in rye 
products, about 0.2 in wheat products, and varied between 0.2 and 0.6 in 
cereal-derived products containing a mixture of whole rye and/or wheat. The data 
set obtained were subsequently compared using cluster and principal component 
analysis, which allowed the tested cereal products to be classified into two 
major groups consisting of whole-rye or whole-wheat products, respectively. On 
the basis of that approach, mixed cereal products containing rye and wheat bran 
or whole rye and wheat flour were grouped between those two well-defined 
clusters. Our work not only provides a detailed examination of alkylresorcinols 
in selected Polish rye and wheat cultivars and selected whole-grain cereal 
products, but also demonstrates that this type of analysis accompanied by the 
use of proper statistical algorithms offers an objective way to evaluate the 
quality of whole-grain rye and/or wheat and their derived products.

Cádiz, Puerto Real, Cádiz, Spain.

A fast method using high-performance liquid chromatography based on two 
monolithic columns has been developed for the simultaneous determination of 
isoflavones extracted from soybeans and derived foods. The 12 main isoflavones 
were resolved in 10 min in two coupled monolithic columns working at 35 degrees 
C using a elution gradient of acidified water (0.1% acetic acid) and methanol 
(0.1% acetic acid) at a flow rate of 5 mL min(-1). Retention time and relative 
area standard deviations were below 1% for all isoflavones. The method developed 
was successfully applied to several soy food samples and spiked samples. Total 
isoflavone concentration in sampled soy foods ranged from 34.28 mg L(-1) to 4.29 
mg g(-1).

Two new dehydrotriferulic acids and two dehydrotetraferulic acids were isolated 
from saponified maize bran insoluble fiber using size exclusion chromatography 
on Bio-Beads S-X3 followed by Sephadex LH-20 chromatography and semipreparative 
phenyl-hexyl reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography. On the basis 
of UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and one- and two-dimensional NMR 
experiments, the structures were identified as 
8-5(noncyclic)/5-5-dehydrotriferulic acid, 
8-8(tetrahydrofuran)/5-5-dehydrotriferulic acid, and 
4-O-8/5-5/8-O-4-dehydrotetraferulic acid. The second tetramer was tentatively 
identified as 4-O-8/5-5/8-5(noncyclic)-dehydrotetraferulic acid. Compounds 
containing an 8-5(noncyclic)-coupled dimeric unit probably do not exist in 
planta but are formed from their phenylcoumaran precursors containing an 
8-5(cyclic)-coupled dimeric unit during saponification. The presented 
dehydrotrimers are the first dehydrotriferulates that do not contain an 
8-O-4-coupled dimeric unit. The ferulate dehydrotetramers that are reported for 
the first time are presumed, like the dimers and trimers, to cross-link 
polysaccharides in the plant. Because both tetramers contain a 
5-5/8-O-4-dehydrotriferulate moiety, the predominant dehydrotrimer in maize 
bran, it is not possible to deduce whether tetramers are formed by coupling of a 
fourth unit to a preformed dehydrotriferulate or by 5-5-coupling of preformed 
8-O-4- and 8-5-dehydrodiferulates. Nevertheless, such compounds document 
expanded roles for ferulates in cross-linking polysaccharides in plant cell 
walls.

Quantitation of polymethoxylated flavones in orange juice by high-performance 
liquid chromatography.

Rouseff RL, Ting SV.

A quantitative high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedure for the 
determination of the five major polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) in orange juice 
has been developed. It employs a unique ternary solvent system with coupled 
UV-fluorescence detection. The dual detectors were employed to determine the 
presence of interfering substances and served as a cross check on quantitation. 
Stop flow UV and fluorescence scanning was used to identify peaks and determine 
the presence of impurities. Although all five citrus PMFs fluoresce, some HPLC 
fluorescence peaks were too small to be of much practical use. All five citrus 
PMFs could be quantitated satisfactorily with the fixed wavelength UV (313 nm) 
detector. The HPLC procedure has been used to evaluate each step in the 
preparation. The optimum extracting solvent was selected and one time consuming 
step was eliminated, as it was found to be unnecessary. HPLC values for 
nobiletin and sinensetin are in good agreement with the thin-layer 
chromatographic (TLC) values in the literature. HPLC values for the other three 
flavones were considerably lower than those reported in the literature. The HPLC 
procedure is considerably faster than the TLC procedure with equal or superior 
precision and accuracy.

The major flavanone-7-O-glycoside constituents in citrus fruit juices (naringin, 
hesperidin, neohesperidin, narirutin, and eriocitrin) were separated as 
diastereomers by multidimensional liquid chromatography. The method consisted of 
coupling two HPLC columns: a reversed-phase (RP(18)) column was used for the 
separation of flavanone glycosides, which were, then, individually switched into 
a carboxymethylated beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD)-based column and resolved as the 
corresponding stereoisomers. The method was used for the full analysis of 
flavanone glycosides in fresh hand-squeezed and commercial fruit juices by 
combining the quantitative estimation with the diastereomeric analysis. 
Quantitative data were in general consistent with previously reported data in 
this field. CC-LC isomer analysis was carried out by coupling the beta-CD column 
with a mass spectrometer operated with negative ion electrospray ionization 
(ESI-MS). The results showed that hesperidin was present in orange juices almost 
exclusively as the 2S isomer, whereas narirutin had mainly the 2R configuration. 
In grapefruit juices (2S)-naringin prevailed with the respect to the 2R isomer, 
whereas the opposite was true for narirutin. Lemon juices contained eriocitrin 
stereoisomers in equal amount (50% each), but hesperidin was almost exclusively 
found as the 2S isomer. Significant differences of the diastereomeric ratios 
were observed between freshly squeezed juices and juices from commercial 
sources.

Interindividual variation in metabolism of soy isoflavones and lignans: 
influence of habitual diet on equol production by the gut microflora.

Rowland IR(1), Wiseman H, Sanders TA, Adlercreutz H, Bowey EA.

The soy isoflavones, daidzein and genistein, and the lignans, matairesinol and 
secoisolariciresinol, are phytoestrogens metabolized extensively by the 
intestinal microflora. Considerable important evidence is already available that 
shows extensive interindividual variation in isoflavone metabolism, and we have 
investigated the extent of this variation in a crossover study of a 
soy-containing food low or high in isoflavones (each treatment period lasted for 
17 days, and the 2 treatment periods were separated by a 25-day washout period) 
in 24 healthy subjects [19 women and 5 men, mean age 30 yr, range 19-40, mean 
body mass index 22.5 +/- 3.5 (SD) kg/m2]. There was a 16-fold variation in total 
isoflavonoid excretion in urine after the high-isoflavone treatment period. The 
variation in urinary equol excretion was greatest (664-fold), and subjects fell 
into two groups: poor equol excretors and good equol excretors (36%). A 
significant negative correlation was found between the proportion of energy from 
fat in the habitual diet and urinary equol excretion (r = -0.55; p = 0.012). 
Good equol excretors consumed less fat as percentage of energy than poor 
excretors (26 +/- 2.3% compared with 35 +/- 1.6%, p < 0.01) and more 
carbohydrate as percentage of energy than poor excretors (55 +/- 2.9% compared 
with 47 +/- 1.7%, p < 0.05). Interindividual variation in the urinary excretion 
of O-desmethyl-angolensin (O-DMA) was also apparent (76-fold after the 
high-isoflavone treatment period), but there was no relationship between equol 
excretion and O-DMA excretion. Enterolactone was the major lignan metabolite in 
urine and plasma but showed less interindividual variation than equol and O-DMA. 
It is suggested that the dietary fat intake decreases the capacity of gut 
microbial flora to synthesize equol.

of the olive cultivar Chemlali from Tunisia.

Sfax, Tunisia.

For the first time the identification and quantification of phenolic compounds 
of the Olea europaea L. cv. Chemlali olive were carried out to examine their 
profile during maturation. The phenolic composition was studied by using 
reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography during all steps of fruit 
development. Oleuropein is the abundant phenolic compound in Chemlali olive, and 
its concentration increases during maturation. An indirect relationship between 
oleuropein content in olive fruit and hydroxytyrosol was observed. Weak changes 
in the amounts of the other phenolic monomers and flavonoids were also observed. 
The total phenolic content varied from 6 to 16 g/kg expressed as pyrogallol 
equivalents. Its highest level was found at the last maturation period. The 
antioxidant capacity of olive extracts was evaluated by measuring the radical 
scavenging effect on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl. The IC(50) values of the 
olive extract ranged from 3.2 to 1.5 microg/mL. There was a correlation between 
antioxidant activity and total phenolic content of samples. The antioxidant 
activity increased with maturation. This could be attributed to the increase of 
the tolal phenol level with fruit development.

This investigation was designed to characterize phenolic metabolism of the olive 
cultivar, Hardy's Mammoth, by examining its constitutive tissues. The phenolic 
profiles of pulp, seed, stone, and new and old season leaves were monitored over 
two fruiting seasons, to investigate possible relationships between tissues and 
phenol content and to determine the impact of alternate fruit bearing. No major 
qualitative differences in phenolic composition were found between the various 
tissues; however, distinct differences between the tissues with respect to 
quantifiable phenols were established. Relationships between 
2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl (3E,4E)-4-formyl-3-(2-oxoethyl)hex-4-enoate ester, 
oleuropein, and hydroxytyrosol in pulp and leaf were identified and found to be 
related to alternate bearing. Concentrations of 5-caffeoylquinic acid in old 
season leaves differed dramatically between seasons, confirming earlier studies.

Low risk of breast cancer (BC) has been proposed to be associated with high 
intake of lignans. Some plant lignans are converted to mammalian lignans, e.g., 
enterolactone (ENL), suggested to be the biologically active lignan forms. Until 
now, little attention has been paid to the possible biological activities of 
plant lignans, even though some plant lignans are absorbed and present in serum 
and urine. In this study, we have investigated the antitumorigenic and 
endocrine-modulatory activities of different plant lignans in order to clarify 
the structure-activity relationships. 7-Hydroxymatairesinol (HMR) is [corrected] 
converted to ENL, and both HMR and ENL inhibit the growth of 
7,12-dimethylbenz[a]-anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary cancer. Nortrachelogenin 
(NTG) resembles HMR, but has a hydroxyl group at C-8 instead of C-7 and is not 
converted to ENL. In DMBA-model, NTG showed no inhibition of tumor growth, but 
increased the uterine weight. Furthermore, life-long exposure to NTG increased 
uterine weight in immature females and ventral prostate weight in adult males. 
In contrast, life-long exposure to HMR had no effects on uterine or prostate 
weights at any age. Our results indicate that a difference in the position of 
one hydroxyl group results in distinct biological responses in vivo, as well as 
different lignan metabolite profiles.

Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a naturally occurring 
polyphenol with cancer chemopreventive properties in preclinical models of 
carcinogenesis, including those of colorectal cancer. Recently, a variety of 
analogues of resveratrol have been synthesised and investigated in in vitro 
assays. One analogue, 3,4,5,4'-tetramethoxystilbene (DMU 212), showed 
preferential growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic properties in transformed cells, 
when compared with their untransformed counterparts. As part of a 
chemoprevention drug development programme, the pharmacokinetic properties of 
DMU 212 were compared with those of resveratrol in the plasma, liver, kidney, 
lung, heart, brain and small intestinal and colonic mucosa of mice. DMU 212 or 
resveratrol (240 mg kg(-1)) were administered intragastrically, and drug 
concentrations were measured by HPLC. Metabolites were characterised by 
cochromatography with authentic reference compounds and were identified by mass 
spectrometry. The ratios of area of plasma or tissue concentration vs time 
curves of resveratrol over DMU 212 (AUC(res)/AUC(DMU212)) for the plasma, liver, 
small intestinal and colonic mucosa were 3.5, 5, 0.1 and 0.15, respectively. 
Thus, resveratrol afforded significantly higher levels than DMU 212 in the 
plasma and liver, while DMU 212 exhibited superior availability compared to 
resveratrol in the small intestine and colon. Resveratrol was metabolised to its 
sulphate or glucuronate conjugates, while DMU 212 underwent metabolic 
hydroxylation or single and double O-demethylation. DMU 212 and resveratrol 
inhibited the growth of human-derived colon cancer cells HCA-7 and HT-29 in 
vitro with IC(50) values of between 6 and 26 microM. In the light of the 
superior levels achieved in the gastrointestinal tract after the administration 
of DMU 212, when compared to resveratrol, the results provide a good rationale 
to evaluate DMU 212 as a colorectal cancer chemopreventive agent.

Resveratrol has been associated with reduced cardiovascular disease and reduced 
cancer risk. This phytoalexin has been reported in a number of plant species, 
including grapes, and may be one of the compounds responsible for the health 
benefits of red wine. Analytical methods for measuring resveratrol in wine and 
peanuts were adapted to isolate, identify, and quantify resveratrol in several 
cultivars of peanuts. Aqueous ethanol (80% v/v) extracts from peanuts without 
seed coats were purified over alumina/silica gel columns and analyzed by 
reversed phase HPLC using a C-18 column. Peanuts from each market type, 
Virginia, runner, and Spanish, produced in four different locations contained 
from 0.03 to 0.14 microg of resveratrol/g. Seed coats from runner and Virginia 
types contained approximately 0.65 microg/g of seed coat, which is equivalent to 
<0.04 microg/seed. Quantitative analysis of 15 cultivars representing 3 peanut 
market types, which had been cold stored for up to 3 years, indicated a range of 
0.02-1.79 microg/g of peanut compared to 0.6-8.0 microg/mL in red wines.

Tea is rich in polyphenols and has a variety of biological activities. In order 
to better understand the biological effects of tea constituents on human health, 
markers for their exposure and their metabolic fates are needed. Previously, we 
have characterized several catechin metabolites in the blood and urine, but more 
information on the metabolite profile of tea polyphenols is needed. In the 
present study, the human urinary metabolite profile of tea polyphenols was 
investigated using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass 
spectrometry with data-dependent acquisition. With data-dependent MS/MS analysis 
by collecting the MS2 and MS3 spectra of the most intense ions in the sample, we 
identified more than twenty metabolites of tea polyphenols from human urine 
samples. (-)-Epigallocatechin (EGC) glucuronide, methylated EGC glucuronide, 
methylated EGC sulfate, (-)-epicatechin (EC) glucruronide, EC sulfate, 
methylated EC sulfate, as well as the glucuronide and sulfate metabolites of the 
ring-fission metabolites of tea catechins, 
5-(3',4',5'-trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4), 
5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6) and 
5-(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6'), were the major human 
urinary metabolites of tea polyphenols. To our knowledge, this is the first 
report of the direct simultaneous analysis of the human urinary metabolite 
profile of tea polyphenols using single sample analysis. This method can also be 
used for thorough investigations of the metabolite profiles of many other 
dietary constituents.

(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant and most biologically 
active polyphenolic compound in tea, has been proposed to have many health 
beneficial effects. The metabolic fate of EGCG, however, is not well understood. 
In the present study, we identified a novel EGCG metabolite, 
7-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-EGCG-4''-O-beta-D-glucupyranoside, in a mouse urine 
sample using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass 
spectrometry. The structure of this metabolite was confirmed by analyzing the 
MSn (n = 1-4) spectra as well as comparing the MS/MS spectra of its product ions 
with those from EGCG and EGCG-4''-O-beta-D-glucupyranoside standards. To our 
knowledge, this is the first report of the identification of a glucoside 
metabolite of EGCG in mammals. Our results indicate that glucosidation 
represents a novel pathway in the metabolism of EGCG in mice.

The cortex of 14 French apple varieties (12 cider and 2 juice varieties), one 
English cider variety, and one dessert apple (i.e., Golden Delicious) were 
studied for their polyphenol composition. Total polyphenols were assayed by the 
Folin-Ciocalteu method, and the precise polyphenolic composition (monomeric 
catechins, proanthocyanidins, hydroxycinnamic acids, and dihydrochalcones) was 
obtained by HPLC following thiolysis. ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS analyses showed that 
chlorogenic acid and p-coumaroylquinic acid were methylated under the conditions 
of thiolysis. Depending on the variety, the global polyphenol concentration 
varied from 1 to 7 g per kilogram of fresh cortex. Cider varieties globally 
showed a higher polyphenol concentration than the dessert apple Golden 
Delicious, bitter varieties being the more concentrated. The proportion of the 
polyphenol classes varied greatly from one cultivar to another. For all 
varieties, procyanidins were always the predominant class. They were mainly 
constituted of (-)-epicatechin units with a small proportion of (+)-catechin as 
a terminal unit. The average degree of polymerization ranged between 4.2 and 7.5 
depending upon the variety with an exception for the sharp varieties Guillevic 
and Avrolles which showed significant concentrations of procyanidins with DPn of 
40 and 50, respectively.

The presence of resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) and its beta-glucoside, 
piceid (resveratrol-3-beta-D-glucopyranoside), together with their isomers in 
wine appears to be one of the beneficial factors conferring a protective effect 
against cardiovascular disease through red wine ingestion. A total of 42 red and 
white wines was collected in areas from Hokkaido to Kyushu in Japan. The wines 
were fractionated with a C18 Sep-pak cartridge, and the active principles were 
eluted with ethyl acetate. Crude trans- and cis-piceid were extracted from a 
Chinese medicine, 'Kojohkon' (Polygonum cuspidatum), and their retention times 
and UV absorption were confirmed by HPLC. trans- and cis-Resveratrol, and trans- 
and cis-piceid were analyzed in a short C18 HPLC column, and cis-resveratrol was 
quantified from the amount of cis-isomer converted from authentic 
trans-resveratrol that had been treated by UV irradiation. The content of piceid 
is shown as the resveratrol equivalent. The average content of total stilbene 
compounds was 4.37 mg/liter in red wines, while only 0.68 mg/liter in white 
wines. Red wines made from Pinot noir, Merlot, and Zweigeltrebe grapes all had a 
high resveratrol content.

Chemical composition and the effects of domestic processing and storage were 
studied in organically cultivated or wild growing berries, harvested in 
certificated area in Serbia. The total phenolics content in fresh berries ranged 
from 380 to 1660 mg GAE/100 g. The phenolic content decreased during the 
processing to jams, and storage in almost all samples, except in black currant. 
Among fresh berries, the highest amount of total anthocyanins was found in 
bilberry (0.61 +/- 0.03 %). Processing and storage caused decrease in 
anthocyanin content. The most ubiquitous anthocyanin aglycone was found to be 
cyanidin. Ellagic acid was detected in fresh and frozen black raspberries and 
related jams, and its content increases during thermal processing to jam. Among 
fresh berries, bilberry showed the strongest DPPH radical scavenging activity 
with an IC(50) value of 0.82 mg/ml. However, frozen as well as processed berries 
in our study still showed comparable high values of radical scavenging activity. 
After 9 months of storage all investigated jams were microbiologicaly correct. 
Regardless of the losses in the amount of total phenolics, total anthocyanins 
and radical scavenging activity, frozen berries and related jams are still 
excellent sources of nutritional substances with antioxidant potential.

A new HPLC stationary phase has been applied to the analysis of phenolic acids 
and flavonoids with diode array and mass spectrometric detection. The separation 
of 26 standard compounds was achieved within 1 h. The stationary phase displayed 
excellent resolution especially of flavonol glycosides. The analytical system 
has been used for the determination of phenolic compounds in apple pomace and 
apple juice, and in extracts of pear fruits of different cultivars. Apple pomace 
was found to be a promising source of phenolics. However, yields are affected by 
the drying conditions applied. Furthermore, the applicability of the analytical 
system for the authenticity control of apple and pear juice was demonstrated by 
determination of characteristic quercetin and isorhamnetin glycosides, and 
dihydrochalcones, respectively. Since isorhamnetin-3-glucoside was present in 
all pear cultivars investigated, the usefulness of arbutin as a specific marker 
of pear products appears to be doubtful.

component analysis) followed by supervised multivariate analysis (linear 
discriminant analysis). In an unbiased approach, in the absence of data 
preselection and filtering, the most important features explaining differences 
between coffee consumers and the control group observed showed variations in 
endogenous human hormonal steroid metabolites as well as xanthine derivatives. 
Only after a biased data treatment data revealed differences between the sample 
groups based on literature reported chlorogenic acid metabolites resulting 
directly from coffee intake. Such analysis could confirm the presence of 21 
previously reported chlorogenic acid plasma metabolites as urinary metabolites. 
The application of tandem MS molecular networking revealed the presence of five 
bioavailable chlorogenic acid derivatives in urine previously not reported, 
including both quinic acid lactone and dimethoxy caffeoyl esters. Selected 
cinnamic acids were quantified in urine.

foodstuffs.

Due to the lack of one universally applicable and commonly used reference 
method, sample preparation in isoflavone (IF) analysis has been performed by 
many different methods which renders comparison and quality assessment of 
published IF contents in foodstuffs difficult. In the present work, the impact 
of different experimental parameters on the IF concentrations determined in 
soybeans, tofu, soy drink and textured vegetable protein by different extraction 
and hydrolysis methods was assessed and IF contents obtained by optimized 
orthogonal methods were compared. Chromatographic analysis was performed by 
HPLC-UV-ESI-MS. If possible sources of error - which are also pointed out in 
this work - are avoided, IF contents obtained by extraction, acid-, base- and 
enzymatic hydrolysis are similar. However, these sample preparation methods 
differ in the amount of time, standard compounds and instruments required, 
ruggedness, and in their applicability to analysis of complex composite samples 
containing soy as minor ingredient. Enzymatic hydrolysis with Helix pomatia 
juice after extraction by sonication with first 50, then 80% aqueous 
acetonitrile in the presence of zinc sulfate heptahydrate and after adjustment 
to </=10% organic solvent turned out to be the method of choice if only aglucone 
equivalent contents are required. The advantages of this method are short 
chromatographic run times, smallest danger of coelution, lowest achievable 
limits of quantitation and therefore best suitability for work-up of complex 
composite samples and that only aglucone standards are needed for quantitation.

Investigations on anthocyanins in wines from Vitis vinifera cv. pinotage: 
factors influencing the formation of pinotin A and its correlation with wine 
age.

Schleinitzstrasse 20, 38106 Braunschweig, Germany.

Pinotage red wines were found to contain a reaction product of malvidin 
3-glucoside and caffeic acid, the so-called pinotin A. A total of 50 Pinotage 
wines from the vintages 1996-2002 were analyzed for the content of pinotin A, 
malvidin 3-glucoside, caffeic acid, and caftaric acid. Statistical analyses were 
performed to reveal variations in the content of these compounds and to 
determine the factors that influence pinotin A formation during wine aging. An 
exponential increase of the concentration of this aging product was observed 
with prolonged storage time. The most rapid synthesis of pinotin A was observed 
in 2.5-4 year old wines, although at this age malvidin 3-glucoside is already 
degraded to a large extent. This phenomenon is explained by the increased ratio 
of caffeic acid/malvidin 3-glucoside, which strongly favors the formation of 
pinotin A and makes side reactions less likely. Pinotin A formation proceeds as 
long as a certain level of malvidin 3-glucoside is maintained in the wines. In 
wines >5-6 years old degradation or polymerization of pinotin A finally exceeds 
the rate of its de novo synthesis.

Pistachio skin phenolics are destroyed by bleaching resulting in reduced 
antioxidative capacities.

Pistachio shells split naturally prior to maturity leading to their unique 
crack-shell form. Within 24 h of harvest, hull-trapped moisture may cause shell 
staining. The illegal process of bleaching has been used to restore a desirable 
white color to pistachio shells. It is not known whether bleaching adversely 
affects phytochemical levels in pistachios. Therefore, we identified for the 
first time multiple pistachio skin phenolics as quercetin (14.9 microg/g), 
luteolin (10.0 microg/g), eriodictyol (10.2 microg/g), rutin (1.6 microg/g), 
naringenin (1.2 microg/g), apigenin (0.2 microg/g), and the anthocyanins, 
cyanidin-3-galactoside (696 microg/g) and cyanidin-3-glucoside (209 microg/g). 
We investigated the effects of bleaching (0.1-50% hydrogen peroxide) on phenolic 
levels and antioxidative capacities in raw and roasted nuts. Because of their 
flavylium cation structures, anthocyanins were the most sensitive to bleaching. 
Bleaching decreased total anthocyanin levels [mug/g of skins (% hydrogen 
peroxide)]: 905 and 549 (0%); 653 and 145 (0.1%); 111 and 18.4 (5%); 6.1 and 3.2 
(25%); 0 and 0 (50%) for raw and roasted nuts, respectively. Bleaching also 
reduced antioxidative capacity [microM/g of Trolox (% hydrogen peroxide)]: 945 
and 725 (0%); 940 and 472 (0.1%); 930 and 455 (5%); 433 and 370 (25%); 189 and 
173 (50%), for raw and roasted nuts, respectively. Raw nuts preserved phenolic 
levels and antioxidant capacity better than roasted nuts, suggesting 
contributing effects of other substances and/or matrix effects that are 
destroyed by the roasting process. The destruction of bioactive phenolics in 
pistachio skins may negatively impact the potential health benefits arising from 
pistachio consumption.

Pomegranate juice (PJ), a rich source of polyphenols including ellagitannins, 
has attracted much attention due to its reported health benefits. This has 
resulted in the consumption of liquid and powder pomegranate extracts as 
alternatives to PJ. Therefore establishing the bioavailability of polyphenols 
from these extract preparations is necessary. Sixteen healthy volunteers 
sequentially consumed, with a 1-week washout period between treatments, PJ (8 
ounces, Wonderful fruit variety), a pomegranate polyphenol liquid extract 
(POMxl, 8 ounces), and a pomegranate polyphenol powder extract (POMxp, 1,000 
mg). The three interventions provided 857, 776, and 755 mg of polyphenols as 
gallic acid equivalents, respectively. Plasma bioavailability, judged based on 
ellagic acid levels over a 6-hour period, did not show statistical differences 
in area under the curve for the three interventions: 0.14 +/- 0.05, 0.11 +/- 
0.03, and 0.11 +/- 0.04 micromol . hour/L for PJ, POMxl, and POMxp, 
respectively. The time of maximum concentration was delayed for POMxp (2.58 +/- 
0.42 hours) compared to PJ (0.65 +/- 0.23 hours) and POMxl (0.94 +/- 0.06 
hours). Urolithin-A glucuronide, a urinary metabolite of ellagic acid, was not 
significantly different with the three interventions, reaching levels of 
approximately 1,000 ng/mL. This study demonstrates that ellagitannin 
metabolites, delivered from pomegranate fruits, as PJ, POMxl, and POMxp, reach 
equivalent levels with a delay in time of maximum concentration of POMxp 
compared to PJ and POMxl.

oat and wheat doughs.

The effects of Trametes hirsuta laccase and Pentopan Mono BG xylanase and their 
combination on oat, wheat, and mixed oat-wheat doughs and the corresponding 
breads were investigated. Laccase treatment decreased the content of 
water-extractable arabinoxylan (WEAX) in oat dough due to oxidative 
cross-linking of feruloylated arabinoxylans. Laccase treatment also increased 
the proportion of water-soluble polysaccharides (WSNSP) apparently due to the 
beta-glucanase side activity present in the laccase preparation. As a result of 
the laccase treatment, the firmness of fresh oat bread was increased. Xylanase 
treatment doubled the content of WEAX in oat dough and slightly increased the 
amount of WSNSP. Increased stiffness of the dough and firmness of the fresh 
bread were detected, probably because of the increased WEAX content, which 
decreased the amount of water available for beta-glucan. The combination of 
laccase and xylanase produced slight hydrolysis of beta-glucan by the 
beta-glucanase side activity of laccase and enhanced the availability of AX for 
xylanase with concomitant reduction of the amount and molar mass of WSNSP. 
Subsequently, the volume of oat bread was increased. Laccase treatment tightened 
wheat dough, probably due to cross-linking of WEAX to higher molecular weight. 
In oat-wheat dough, laccase slightly increased the proportion of WSNSP between 
medium to low molecular weight and increased the specific volume of the bread. 
Xylanase increased the contents of WEAX and WSNSP between medium to low 
molecular weight in oat-wheat dough, which increased the softness of the dough, 
as well as the specific volume and softness of the bread. The results thus 
indicate that a combination of laccase and xylanase was beneficial for the 
textures of both oat and oat-wheat breads.

University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602-7610, USA.

Vidalia onion varieties Nirvana, DPS 1032, Yellow 2025, King-Midas, and SBO 133 
grown at Vidalia, Georgia, were analyzed for flavonoid content. A 
high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with photodiode array 
detection was used for quantification. Compounds were analyzed as aglycons after 
acid hydrolysis with 1.2 M HCl. Identification of each compound was based on 
comparison of its retention time and UV spectra with those of pure commercial 
standards. Three major flavonoids, kaempferol, myricetin, and quercetin, were 
identified and quantified. Quercetin was the major flavonoid (7.70-46.32 mg/100 
g fresh weight, FW) present in all varieties, followed by myricetin (2.77-4.13 
mg/100 g FW). Minor quantities of kaempferol (1.10-1.98 mg/100 g FW) were also 
detected. The total polyphenols and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity 
(TEAC) ranged from 73.33 to 180.84 mg/100 g FW and 0.92-1.56 microM TEAC/g FW, 
respectively. A positive but weaker correlation was obtained for total 
polyphenols versus antioxidant capacity. Nevertheless, a stronger correlation 
(r(2) = 0.34) was obtained between flavonoid content versus antioxidant 
capacity. The data indicate that Vidalia onions are a rich source of quercetin, 
and they also contain myricetin and kaempferol.

Georgia 30602-7610, USA.

Blueberries and blackberries grown at various locations in Georgia were 
collected and analyzed for flavonoids, total anthocyanins, total polyphenols, 
and Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). Each sample was analyzed for 
phenolic acids (gallic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, 
and ellagic acid) and flavonoids (catechin, epicatechin, myricetin, quercetin, 
and kaempferol). A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with 
photodiode array detection was used for analysis. Compounds were analyzed as 
aglycons after acid hydrolysis with 1.2 M HCl. Identification of each compound 
was based on retention time and UV spectra by comparison with pure commercial 
standards. Phenolic acids ranged from 0.19 to 258.90 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW), 
and flavonoids ranged from 2.50 to 387.48 mg/100 g FW. Total polyphenols ranged 
from 261.95 to 929.62 mg/100 g FW, and total anthocyanins ranged from 12.70 to 
197.34 mg/100 g FW. TEAC values varied from 8.11 to a maximum of 38.29 microM/g 
FW. A linear relationship was observed between TEAC values and total polyphenols 
or total anthocyanins. The data indicate that blueberries and blackberries are 
rich sources of antioxidants.

Hydrophilic phenols are the most abundant natural antioxidants of virgin olive 
oil (VOO), in which tocopherols and carotenes are also present. The prevalent 
classes of hydrophilic phenols found in VOO are phenyl alcohols, phenolic acids, 
secoiridoids such as the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid 
linked to (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol or (p-hydroxypheny1)ethanol 
(3,4-DHPEA-EDA or p-HPEA-EDA) and an isomer of the oleuropein aglycon 
(3,4-DHPEA-EA), lignans such as (+)-1-acetoxypinoresinol and (+)-pinoresinol, 
and flavonoids. A new method for the analysis of VOO hydrophilic phenols by 
direct injection in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with the use 
of a fluorescence detector (FLD) has been proposed and compared with the 
traditional liquid-liquid extraction technique followed by the HPLC analysis 
utilizing a diode array detector (DAD) and a FLD. Results show that the most 
important classes of phenolic compounds occurring in VOO can be evaluated using 
HPLC direct injection. The efficiency of the new method, as compared to the 
liquid-liquid extraction, was higher to quantify phenyl alcohols, lignans, and 
3,4-DHPEA-EA and lower for the evaluation of 3,4-DHPEA-EDA and p-HPEA-EDA.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the interaction between buckwheat 
protein and buckwheat phenols in the process of protein extraction and to 
compare the effects of phenols on protein structure and antioxidant activity. 
With the extension of extraction time, the content of total phenol increased 
from 150.51 to 336.01 mg gallic acid equivalent/g sample. Four phenols and seven 
phenols were identified by UPLC-Q/TOF-MS as binding to proteins in non-covalent 
and covalent forms, respectively. The contribution of non-covalent and covalent 
bound phenols to the antioxidant activity of the complexes were different. 
Meanwhile, the binding of phenols changed the infrared characteristic peak of 
protein, and reduced the fluorescence intensity and surface hydrophobic value. 
The free amino and sulfhydryl content of the protein decreased with increasing 
extraction time. These findings provide valuable information for one-step 
preparation of protein-phenol complexes.

An off-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) and ultra-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and 
validated for determining procyanidins, catechin, epicatechin, dimer, and trimer 
in plasma samples. In the validation procedure of the analytical method, 
linearity, precision, accuracy, detection limits (LODs), quantification limits 
(LOQs), and the matrix effect were studied. Recoveries of the procyanidins were 
higher than 84%, except for the trimer, which was 65%. The LODs and LOQs were 
lower than 0.003 and 0.01 microM, respectively, for all the procyanidins 
studied, except for the trimers, which were 0.8 and 0.98 microM, respectively. 
This methodology was then applied for the analysis of rat plasma obtained 2h 
after ingestion of grape seed phenolic extract. Monomers (catechin and 
epicatechin), dimer and trimer in their native form were detected and quantified 
in plasma samples, and their concentration ranged from 0.85 to 8.55 microM. 
Moreover, several metabolites, such as catechin and epicatechin glucuronide, 
catechin and epicatechin methyl glucuronide, and catechin and epicatechin 
methyl-sulphate were identified. These conjugated forms were quantified, in 
reference to the respective unconjugated form, showing concentrations between 
0.06 and 23.90 microM.

Quercetin (QUE), a flavonoid widely found in vegetables and fruits, is primarily 
metabolized through phase II conjugation pathways and circulates as various 
conjugates. We previously showed that QUE and its metabolites are transferred to 
neonatal mice via breast milk. However, as the dams in that study ingested QUE 
during pregnancy, placental transfer may also had occurred. Thus, this study 
aimed to investigate the placental transfer of QUE and its metabolites by 
quantifying their concentrations before parturition. ICR mice were fed a 
standard AIN-93G diet and mated, with gestational day 0 defined as the day of 
mating. On gestational day 14, the diet was switched to 1 % (w/w) 
QUE-supplemented AIN-93G. On gestational day 17, blood, liver, and placenta 
samples were collected from pregnant dams and fetuses. QUE and its metabolites 
were quantified using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with 
quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. QUE and its metabolites were 
detected in the placenta and maternal liver, as well as in the fetal liver. The 
proportions of heteroconjugates (e.g., quercetin glucuronide sulfate and 
isorhamnetin glucuronide sulfate) in the placenta (59 %) and fetal liver (43 %) 
were lower than in maternal plasma (94 %). In contrast, monoconjugates (e.g., 
quercetin glucuronide, quercetin sulfate) and particularly free QUE were 
relatively abundant in both placenta and fetal liver. These findings suggest 
that heteroconjugates from maternal blood may be deconjugated in the placenta. 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively analyze the 
placental transfer of QUE and its metabolites to fetuses in pregnant mice.

The pharmacokinetic behavior of the soy isoflavone metabolite S-(-)equol and its 
diastereoisomer R-(+)equol in healthy adults determined by using 
stable-isotope-labeled tracers.

BACKGROUND: The nonsteroidal estrogen equol occurs as diastereoisomers, 
S-(-)equol and R-(+)equol, both of which have significant biological actions. 
S-(-)equol, the naturally occurring enantiomer produced by 20-30% of adults 
consuming soy foods, has selective affinity for estrogen receptor-beta, whereas 
both enantiomers modulate androgen action. Little is known about the 
pharmacokinetics of the diastereoisomers, despite current interest in developing 
equol as a nutraceutical or pharmaceutical agent.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare the pharmacokinetics of S-(-)equol and 
R-(+)equol by using [13C] stable-isotope-labeled tracers to facilitate the 
optimization of clinical studies aimed at evaluating the potential of these 
diastereoisomers in the prevention and treatment of estrogen- and 
androgen-dependent conditions.
DESIGN: A randomized, crossover, open-label study in 12 healthy adults (6 men 
and 6 women) compared the plasma and urinary pharmacokinetics of orally 
administered enantiomeric pure forms of S-(-)[2-13C]equol, R-(+)[2-13C]equol, 
and the racemic mixture. Plasma and urinary [13C]R-equol and [13C]S-equol 
concentrations were measured by tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Plasma [13C]equol concentration appearance and disappearance curves 
showed that both enantiomers were rapidly absorbed, attained high circulating 
concentrations, and had a similar terminal elimination half-life of 7-8 h. The 
systemic bioavailability and fractional absorption of R-(+)[2-13C]equol were 
higher than those of S-(-)[2-13C]equol or the racemate. The pharmacokinetics of 
racemic (+/-)[2-13C]equol were different from those of the individual 
enantiomers: slower absorption, lower peak plasma concentrations, and lower 
systemic bioavailability.
CONCLUSIONS: The high bioavailability of both diastereoisomers contrasts with 
previous findings for the soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein, both of which 
have relatively poor bioavailability, and suggests that low doses of equol taken 
twice daily may be sufficient to achieve biological effects.

The soy isoflavone metabolite, S-(-)equol, has selective affinity for estrogen 
receptor (ER)beta and also antagonizes in vivo the action of 
dihydrotestosterone. It is therefore of interest as a potential new therapeutic 
agent in hormone-dependent conditions and is under development as a 
nutraceutical. Our objective in this study was to define the pharmacokinetics of 
natural S-(-)equol after administration of SE5-OH, a newly developed S-(-)equol 
supplement made by incubation of the equol-producing bacterium Lactococcus 
garvieae with soy germ isoflavones. In a single-center, open-label, randomized, 
2-period crossover design study, the pharmacokinetics of S-(-)equol administered 
as single-bolus oral doses of 10 and 30 mg in the form of SE5-OH tablets was 
determined in 12 healthy postmenopausal women. S-(-)equol was measured in plasma 
and urine collected at timed intervals over a 48-h period postdosing using 
tandem MS. Equol-producer status was also determined after a soymilk challenge 
conducted after the pharmacokinetic sampling was complete. S-(-)equol was 
rapidly absorbed after oral administration and attained high plasma 
concentrations, with a plasma elimination half-life of 8 h. The maximum plasma 
concentration/dose, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 
to infinity/dose, and the fraction of dose excreted in urine (%f(e,u)) were 
similar for the 2 doses, indicating a dose-proportional response in total 
S-(-)equol pharmacokinetics. The systemic bioavailability of S-(-)equol was very 
high, as the %f(e,u) was 82% for both doses, which is greater than published 
data for the soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein. Three participants were 
determined to be equol-producers, representing a 25% frequency, and 
equol-producer status had no effect on natural S-(-)equol pharmacokinetics.

Germany.

Several phenolic acids, e.g. caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, 
gallic acid and ellagic acid, which occur naturally, are inhibitors of 
carcinogenesis. In this paper we present a new method for the simultaneous 
determination of all of these compounds, except ellagic acid, in juices by 
reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using ultraviolet 
detection and involving isocratic elution, and we have devised an HPLC method 
for the determination of ellagic acid in juices. The experimental results showed 
that cherry juice contains a high concentration of chlorogenic acid and the 
content of bound gallic acid in black and green grape juices is high compared to 
that of other phenolic acids.

Total equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and phenolic content of 26 common 
spice extracts from 12 botanical families were investigated. Qualitative and 
quantitative analyses of major phenolics in the spice extracts were 
systematically conducted by reversed-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography (RP-HPLC). Many spices contained high levels of phenolics and 
demonstrated high antioxidant capacity. Wide variation in TEAC values 
(0.55-168.7 mmol/100 g) and total phenolic content (0.04-14.38 g of gallic acid 
equivalent/100 g) was observed. A highly positive linear relationship (R2= 0.95) 
obtained between TEAC values and total phenolic content showed that phenolic 
compounds in the tested spices contributed significantly to their antioxidant 
capacity. Major types of phenolic constituents identified in the spice extracts 
were phenolic acids, phenolic diterpenes, flavonoids, and volatile oils (e.g., 
aromatic compounds). Rosmarinic acid was the dominant phenolic compound in the 
six spices of the family Labiatae. Phenolic volatile oils were the principal 
active ingredients in most spices. The spices and related families with the 
highest antioxidant capacity were screened, e.g., clove in the Myrtaceae, 
cinnamon in the Lauraceae, oregano in the Labiatae, etc., representing potential 
sources of potent natural antioxidants for commercial exploitation. This study 
provides direct comparative data on antioxidant capacity and total and 
individual phenolics contents of the 26 spice extracts.

In this study, we investigated the intestinal absorption of luteolin and 
luteolin 7-O-beta-glucoside in rats by HPLC. The absorption analysis using rat 
everted small intestine demonstrated that luteolin was converted to glucuronides 
during passing through the intestinal mucosa and that luteolin 
7-O-beta-glucoside was absorbed after hydrolysis to luteolin. Free luteolin, its 
conjugates and methylated conjugates were present in rat plasma after dosing. 
This suggests that some luteolin can escape the intestinal conjugation and the 
hepatic sulfation/methylation. LC/MS analysis showed that the main conjugate 
which circulates in the blood was a monoglucuronide of the unchanged aglycone. 
Luteolin in propyleneglycol was absorbed more rapidly than that in 0.5% 
carboxymethyl cellulose. The plasma concentration of luteolin and its conjugates 
reached the highest level 15 min and 30 min after dosing with luteolin in 
propyleneglycol, respectively. HPLC analysis also allowed us to demonstrate the 
presence of free luteolin and its monoglucuronide in human serum after ingestion 
of luteolin.

The beneficial effects of red, yellow and white onion extracts have been 
assessed by antioxidant activity and antimutagenic activity. And the effects 
compared to BHT and ascorbic acid. Total phenolic compounds and flavonoids in 
onion extracts were determined. Yellow onion extract had more organic acid and 
free sugar than those detected in the white and red onion extract. The 
scavenging activity of DPPH radical and H(2)O(2) were increased depending on the 
concentration. The antioxidant activities using beta-carotene-linoleate system 
and reducing power were increased but the effect was small to that of BHT and 
ascorbic acid. After digested, extracts showed antimutagenic activities, and it 
seems that they inhibit the mutagenicity for digesting. This study demonstrated 
that the antimutagenicities and antioxidant properties of ethyl acetate extract 
against mutagens were related to their phenols and flavonoids, which are heat 
stable and losses digestive juices are relatively low.

Cold-pressed oils are oils prepared from pressing plant materials with a screw 
or hydraulic press, yielding oils with little contamination of harmful chemicals 
and high content of nutrients and functional constituents. Cold-pressed oils 
have gained increasing recognition as food supplements for preventing and 
ameliorating body deterioration due to ageing and the progression of lifestyle 
diseases or non-communicable diseases. This article aimed to review their 
structure, bioactivity, and chromatographic analysis of the mostly found 
functional compounds in cold-pressed oils, including phytosterols, carotenoids, 
tocols (tocopherols and tocotrienols), phenolic compounds (flavonoids, phenolic 
acids, tannins, stilbenes, and lignans), and squalene.

Flavanones, the main polyphenols of citrus fruits, are thought to contribute to 
the protective effects of these fruits against cardiovascular diseases and 
cancer. The metabolism of naringin (naringenin 7-O-neohesperidoside) is studied 
here in healthy (sham-operated, ShO) and tumor-bearing (TuB) rats. The tumor was 
induced by implanting Yoshida's sarcoma in hindlimb. Both groups received for 7 
days a semi-synthetic diet containing 0.5% naringin in per feeding conditions. 
Flavanones were analyzed in plasma, liver, kidney and urine by tandem mass 
spectrometry. Naringenin conjugates (essentially glucuronides) accounted for up 
to 98% of the total flavanones in plasma. Low amounts of hesperetin (4'-O-methyl 
naringénine) and isosakuranetin (3'-hydroxy-4'-O-methylnaringenin) were also 
detected in all biological samples and accounted for 2% of the total flavanones 
in plasma. They were largely present as aglycones. The in vivo hydroxylation of 
flavanones is described here for the first time. Total concentrations of 
naringenin metabolites reached 17.3+/-2.7 microM in plasma 6 hours after the 
beginning of the meal in healthy rats and only 10.6+/-1.3 microM in TuB rats. 
The nature of metabolites was similar in both healthy and TuB rats and in 
plasma, tissues and urine. The lower concentration of flavanones in the TuB rats 
suggests that disease and more particularly cancer, may affect the 
bioavailability of flavonoids.

The phenolic compounds present in 17 samples of Portuguese commercial and three 
homemade quince jams were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, to determine 
their authenticity. Two different extraction methods were needed for the 
complete definition of quince jams profiles, one of them including an Amberlite 
XAD-2 cleaning step. These analyses showed that all the samples presented a 
similar profile composed of at least eight identified phenolic compounds, 
several unidentified characteristic procyanidin polymers, and sodium benzoate as 
preservative of quince jams. Several samples also contained arbutin, suggesting 
that these quince jam samples were fraudulently adulterated with pear puree.

The present study reports the phenolic profile and antiproliferative properties 
of quince (Cydonia oblonga Miller) leaf and fruit (pulp, peel, and seed) against 
human kidney and colon cancer cells. The phenolic profiles of quince methanolic 
extracts were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/diode 
array detector (DAD). 5-O-Caffeoylquinic acid was always one of the two major 
phenolic compounds present in all extracts, except for seed. Our results 
revealed that quince leaf and fruit extracts exhibited distinctive 
antiproliferative activities. The extracts from quince leaf showed 
concentration-dependent growth inhibitory activity toward human colon cancer 
cells (IC(50) = 239.7 +/- 43.2 microg/mL), while no effect was observed in renal 
adenocarcinoma cells. Concerning the fruit, seed extracts exhibited no effect on 
colon cancer cell growth, whereas strong antiproliferative efficiency against 
renal cancer cells was observed for the highest concentration assayed (500 
microg/mL). The antiproliferative activity of pulp and peel extracts was low or 
absent in the selected range of extract concentrations. This is the first report 
showing that C. oblonga may be useful as a cancer chemopreventive and/or 
chemotherapeutic agent.

Isoflavones and carotenoids in four experimental genotypes and Hutcheson 
cultivar soybeans were evaluated as a function of processing treatments and 
maturity. Total isoflavone and carotenoid contents were affected by genotypes 
and maturity stages (p < 0.0001). Total isoflavones ranged from 472 microg/g (in 
NTCPR93-40) to 2280 microg/g (in Hutcheson). Lutein contents ranged from 895 (in 
NTCPR93-286) to 2119 (in Honey Brown), and beta-carotene ranged from 291 (in 
Hutcheson) to 491 (in NICPR92-40) microg/100 g. Mean total isoflavone retention 
percentages in immature Hutcheson soybeans were 46% (boiling), 53% (freezing), 
and 40% (freeze-drying). Mean retentions of lutein and beta-carotene, 
respectively, were 92 and 73% in frozen, 62 and 62% in boiled, and 34 and 27% in 
freeze-dried soybeans. Boiling caused a substantial increase in daidzin, 
genistin, and genistein. The results show that post-harvest changes in total 
isoflavones and carotenoids in soybeans are influenced by processing methods, 
but genotype has an effect on isoflavone and carotenoid profiles during seed 
development.

Total anthocyanin pigments increased from 74.7 to 317 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW) 
from underripe to overripe for Marion blackberries and from 69.9 to 164 mg/100 g 
FW for Evergreen blackberries. Total phenolics did not show a marked change with 
maturity with values slightly decreasing from underripe to ripe. Antioxidant 
activities, while increasing with ripening, also did not show the marked change 
that total anthocyanins exhibited. The impact of variation due to plots, 
subsampling, sample preparation, and measurement on Marion composition was 
examined in detail. Plot-to-plot and sample differences were the major 
contributors to variation, with sample preparation being an important 
contributor for some parameters. Measurement variation was a relatively small 
component of the total variation. Total anthocyanins for 11 blackberry cultivars 
ranged from 131 to 256 mg/100 g FW (mean = 198), total phenolics ranged from 682 
to 1056 mg GAE/100 g FW (mean = 900), oxygen radical absorbance capacity ranged 
from 37.6 to 75.5 micromol TE/g FW (mean = 50.2), and ferric reducing 
antioxidant power ranged from 63.5 to 91.5 micromol TE/g FW (mean = 77.5).

Apples are an important source of flavonoids in the human diet. The effect of 
processing apples into juice on polyphenolic antioxidant content and activity is 
described. Raw juice obtained from Jonagold apples by pulping and straight 
pressing or after pulp enzyming had an antioxidant activity that was only 10 and 
3%, respectively, of the activity of the fresh apples. The levels of flavonoids 
and chlorogenic acid in the juice were reduced to between 50% (chlorogenic acid) 
and 3% (catechins). Most of the antioxidants were retained in the pomace rather 
than being transferred into the juice. Apparently, most of the antioxidant 
compounds are absorbed to the solid matter of the pomace. In apple juice, 45% of 
the total measured antioxidant activity could be ascribed to the analyzed 
antioxidants. For three apple cultivars tested (Elstar, Golden Delicious, and 
Jonagold), the processing methods had similar effects. The results indicate that 
processing can have a major impact on the bioactivity of products.

The difference in urinary excretion of mammalian and plant lignans in rats was 
determined after oral administration of equivalent doses (25 mg/kg of body 
weight) of 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR), lariciresinol (LAR), matairesinol (MR), 
and secoisolariciresinol (SECO). Twenty-four hours-urine samples were collected 
after a single dose and after administration of one dose/day for 10 days. Eight 
lignans were analysed in urine extracts using a high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method showing good sensitivity and 
repeatability. After a single dose of HMR, LAR, MR, and SECO, the main 
metabolites were 7-hydroxyenterolactone (HENL), cyclolariciresinol (CLAR), 
enterolactone (ENL), and enterodiol (END), respectively, but after 10-day 
exposure ENL was the main metabolite of all the tested lignans, showing a 
considerably higher excretion than after a single dose. Metabolic 
transformations of plant lignans into each other could also be observed.

Twenty-four plant lignans were analyzed by high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in bran extracts of 16 cereal species, 
in four nut species, and in two oilseed species (sesame seeds and linseeds). 
Eighteen of these were lignans previously unidentified in these species, and of 
these, 16 were identified in the analyzed samples. Four different extraction 
methods were applied as follows: alkaline extraction, mild acid extraction, a 
combination of alkaline and mild acid extraction, or accelerated solvent 
extraction. The extraction method was of great importance for the lignan yield. 
7-Hydroxymatairesinol, which has not previously been detected in cereals because 
of destructive extraction methods, was the dominant lignan in wheat, triticale, 
oat, barley, millet, corn bran, and amaranth whole grain. Syringaresinol was the 
other dominant cereal lignan. Wheat and rye bran had the highest lignan content 
of all cereals; however, linseeds and sesame seeds were by far the most 
lignan-rich of the studied species.

In seed extracts of five oilseed species, in bran extracts of three cereal 
species, and in seed and/or whole berry extracts of 10 berry species, the 
concentrations of a large number of lignans and the enantiomeric composition of 
selected lignans were determined. In the case of sesame and hemp seeds, the 
lignan content and composition of the whole seeds was compared to that of the 
hulled seeds. The results showed that cloudberry seeds are the third most 
lignan-rich food source after linseeds and whole sesame seeds, and that most of 
the berry species analysed were more lignan-rich than the cereal brans. The 
lignans are concentrated in the hull of the oilseeds and in the seeds of the 
berries. In most samples, secoisolarici-, pino-, medio-, and syringaresinol were 
present as a mixture of two enantiomers.

A modified high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for 
determination of trans-resveratrol (resveratrol) in peanuts and peanut products 
has been developed. Resveratrol was extracted with acetonitrile-water (90/10, 
v/v) by blending with diatomaceous earth at high speed followed by purification 
of an aliquot of the extract on a minicolumn packed with Al(2)O(3)-ODS (C(18)) 
mixture. The column was eluted with acetonitrile-water (90/10, v/v), eluate was 
evaporated under nitrogen, and residue was dissolved in HPLC mobile phase. 
Resveratrol in an aliquot of purified extract was quantitated by HPLC on silica 
gel with n-hexane-2-propanol-water-acetonitrile-acetic acid (1050/270/17/5/1, 
v/v) as a mobile phase. The recovery of resveratrol added to diatomaceous earth 
at 0.05 microg/g was 98.95 +/- 17.79%; the recovery of the standard added to 
fresh peanuts (with 0.070 microg/g natural level of resveratrol) at 0.50, 5.00, 
and 10.00 microg/g was 117.23 +/- 8.87, 100.10 +/- 2.49, and 100.45 +/- 1.51%, 
respectively. The quantitation limit of resveratrol in fresh peanuts was about 
0. 01 microg/g. Roasted peanuts had the lowest content of resveratrol of 0.055 
+/- 0.023 microg/g (n = 21), while in peanut butter its concentration was 
significantly higher, 0.324 +/- 0.129 microg/g (n = 46), and boiled peanuts had 
the highest level of 5.138 +/- 2.849 microg/g (n = 12). Resveratrol content in 
commercial peanut products was similar to the resveratrol content of the raw 
peanut fractions routinely used for making them.

The concentrations of three polyphenols ((+)-catechin, quercetin and 
trans-resveratrol) in blood serum, plasma and urine, as well as whole blood, 
have been measured after their oral and intragastric administration, 
respectively, to humans and rats. The method developed for this purpose utilized 
ethyl acetate extraction of 100 microl samples and their derivatization with 
bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) followed by gas-chromatographic 
analysis on a DB-5 column followed by mass selective detection employing two 
target ions and one qualifier ion for each compound. Total run time was 17 min 
with excellent resolution and linearity. The limits of detection (LOD) and 
quantitation (LOQ) were an order of magnitude less than for any previously 
published method, being 0.01 microg/l and 0.1 microg/l, respectively, for all 
compounds. Recovery at 1 microg/l and 10 microg/l was >80% in all instances but 
one, and was >90% in 50%. Imprecision was acceptable at 0.25 and 1.0 microg/l, 
concentrations below the LOQ of previous methods. Aglycones released from 
conjugates after hydrolysis were easily measurable. Optimal conditions for 
hydrolysis were established. After oral administration of the three polyphenols 
to humans, their conjugates vastly exceeded the concentrations of the aglycones 
in both plasma and urine. Concentrations peaked within 0.5-1.0 h in plasma and 
within 8 h in urine. During the first 24 h, 5.1% of the (+)-catechin and 24.6% 
of the trans-resveratrol given were recovered in the urine (free plus 
conjugated). This method can be proposed as the method of choice to assay these 
polyphenols and their conjugates in biological fluids.

Fig fruit has been a typical component in the health-promoting Mediterranean 
diet for millennia. To study the potential health-promoting constituents of fig 
fruits, six commercial fig varieties differing in color (black, red, yellow, and 
green) were analyzed for total polyphenols, total flavonoids, antioxidant 
capacity, and amount and profile of anthocyanins. Using reversed-phase liquid 
chromatography (RP-LC), various concentrations of anthocyanins but a similar 
profile was found in all varieties studied. Hydrolysis revealed cyanidin as the 
major aglycon. Proton and carbon NMR confirmed cyanidin-3-O-rhamnoglucoside 
(cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside; C3R) as the main anthocyanin in all fruits. Color 
appearance of fig extract correlated well with total polyphenols, flavonoids, 
anthocyanins, and antioxidant capacity. Extracts of darker varieties showed 
higher contents of phytochemicals compared to lighter colored varieties. Fruit 
skins contributed most of the above phytochemicals and antioxidant activity 
compared to the fruit pulp. Antioxidant capacity correlated well with the 
amounts of polyphenols and anthocyanins (R2 = 0.985 and 0.992, respectively). In 
the dark-colored Mission and the red Brown-Turkey varieties, the anthocyanin 
fraction contributed 36 and 28% of the total antioxidant capacity, respectively. 
C3R contributed 92% of the total antioxidant capacity of the anthocyanin 
fraction. Fruits of the Mission variety contained the highest levels of 
polyphenols, flavonoids, and anthocyanins and exhibited the highest antioxidant 
capacity.

Banana (Musa cavendish) peel, usually discarded as waste, is a polyphenol-rich 
source with antioxidant and chelating properties. This study evaluated its 
ability to mitigate ovarian toxicity induced by a heavy metal mixture (HMM) 
consisting of Hg, Mn, Pb, and Al in female rats. Animals received the HMM with 
or without banana peel extract at 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg dosages for 60 days. 
Co-treatment dose-dependently reduced ovarian metal accumulation, attenuated 
oxidative and nitrosative stress (MDA, NO), restored antioxidant enzyme 
activities (SOD, CAT, GSH, GPx), and modulated pro-inflammatory (IL-6, TNF-α), 
apoptotic (Caspase-3), and transcriptional factors (NF-κB, Nrf2). The gonadal 
endocrine profile also improved gonadotropins (FSH, LH), prolactin (PRL), and 
progesterone (P), which were normalized at the medium dose (400 mg/kg), and 
demonstrated a clear dose-related effect. Histological examination further 
revealed that this dose most effectively improved ovarian tissue. GC-MS analysis 
identified bioactive compounds including resveratrol, proanthocyanidins, and 
anthocyanidins, supporting both antioxidant and chelating actions. These 
findings demonstrate that banana peel extract exerts a dual, dose-dependent 
protective role in the gonad, limiting metal burden while enhancing redox 
defenses, and highlight its translational potential as a sustainable agro-food 
waste product in reproductive toxicology.

A phytochemical study was undertaken on tronchuda cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. 
var. costata DC) cultivated under conventional and organic practices and 
collected at different times. Six organic acids (aconitic, citric, ascorbic, 
malic, shikimic, and fumaric acids) were identified and quantified by HPLC-UV. 
Qualitative and quantitative differences were noted between internal and 
external leaves. Analysis of the phenolics of the internal leaves was achieved 
by HPLC-DAD, and the phenolic profile obtained was revealed to be distinct from 
that of the external leaves. By this means were identified and quantified 11 
compounds: 3-p-coumaroylquinic acid, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, 
kaempferol 3-O-(caffeoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 
3-O-(sinapoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 
3-O-(feruloyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside, two 
isomeric forms of 1,2-disinapoylgentiobiose, 1-sinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose, 
1,2,2'-trisinapoylgentiobiose, and 1,2'-disinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose. In 
general, internal leaves exhibited more constant chemical profiles.

Seed coat, cotyledon and embryonic axe fractions of chickpea (Cicer arietinum 
L.) and horse gram (Macrotyloma uniflorum L.) were evaluated for their phenolic 
composition in relation to antioxidant activities. Compositional analysis of 
phenolics by HPLC revealed a wide variation in the distribution of flavonols, 
isoflavones, phenolic acids and anthocyanins among these legume fractions. 
Although cotyledon fractions of both the legumes were rich in phenolic acids, 
the concentrations of flavonols such as quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin 
were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than the embryonic axe and seed coat 
fractions. Ferulic, chlorogenic, caffeic, and vanillic acids were the principal 
phenolic acids found in cotyledons. The most striking difference was the 
predominance of isoflavones in embryonic axe fractions. Although the isoflavone 
genistein was detected in all three fractions of chickpea, it was present 
exclusively in the embryonic axe fraction of horse gram at levels greater than 
daidzein. Furthermore, cyanidin, petunidin, and delphinidin were detected in 
seed coat and embryonic axe fractions but not in cotyledons. In addition to 
these three anthocyanins, malvidin was found only in the horse gram seed coat 
fraction. Seed coat fractions having higher total phenolic indexes were found to 
be the most active 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavengers 
(IC(50) 13.1 to 18.6 microg/mL) followed by embryonic axe and cotyledon 
fractions (IC(50) 15.4 to 34.2 microg/mL). Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) 
scavenging capacities of cotyledons, embryonic axe and seed coats were 12.3, 
34.1 and 78.6% for chickpea and 15.1, 56.8 and 92.6% for horse gram, 
respectively. The multiple antioxidant activity of horse gram and chickpea 
fractions was evident, as they also possessed reducing power and ferrous 
ion-chelating potency. These results contributed to the understanding of the 
relationships between major phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities of 
legumes and provided useful information for effective utilization of 
legume-milled fractions as functional food ingredients for promoting health.

Ten healthy human subjects consumed 500 mL of Choladi green tea, containing 648 
mumol of flavan-3-ols after which plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h 
period and analysed by HPLC-MS. Plasma contained a total of ten metabolites, in 
the form of O-methylated, sulphated and glucuronide conjugates of (epi)catechin 
and (epi)gallocatechin, with 29-126 nM peak plasma concentrations (C(max)) 
occurring 1.6-2.3 h after ingestion, indicative of absorption in the small 
intestine. Plasma also contained unmetabolised (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate 
and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate with respective C(max) values of 55 and 25 nM. 
Urine excreted 0-24 h after consumption of green tea contained 15 metabolites of 
(epi)catechin and (epi)gallocatechin, but (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate and 
(-)-epicatechin-3-gallate were not detected. Overall flavan-3-ol metabolite 
excretion was equivalent to 8.1% of intake, however, urinary (epi)gallocatechin 
metabolites corresponded to 11.4% of (epi)gallocatechin ingestion while 
(epi)catechin metabolites were detected in amounts equivalent to 28.5% of 
(epi)catechin intake. These findings imply that (epi)catechins are highly 
bioavailable, being absorbed and excreted to a much greater extent than most 
other flavonoids. It is also evident that flavan-3-ol metabolites are rapidly 
turned over in the circulatory system and as a consequence C(max) values are not 
an accurate quantitative indicator of the extent to which absorption occurs.

Human subjects drank coffee containing 412 mumol of chlorogenic acids, and 
plasma and urine were collected 0 to 24 h after ingestion and were analyzed by 
high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Within 1 h, some of 
the components in the coffee reached nanomole peak plasma concentrations 
(C(max)), whereas chlorogenic acid metabolites, including caffeic 
acid-3-O-sulfate and ferulic acid-4-O-sulfate and sulfates of 3- and 
4-caffeoylquinic acid lactones, had higher C(max) values. The short time to 
reach C(max) (T(max)) indicates absorption of these compounds in the small 
intestine. In contrast, dihydroferulic acid, its 4-O-sulfate, and dihydrocaffeic 
acid-3-O-sulfate exhibited much higher C(max) values (145-385 nM) with T(max) 
values in excess of 4 h, indicating absorption in the large intestine and the 
probable involvement of catabolism by colonic bacteria. These three compounds, 
along with ferulic acid-4-O-sulfate and dihydroferulic acid-4-O-glucuronide, 
were also major components to be excreted in urine (8.4-37.1 mumol) after coffee 
intake. Feruloylglycine, which is not detected in plasma, was also a major 
urinary component (20.7 mumol excreted). Other compounds, not accumulating in 
plasma but excreted in smaller quantities, included the 3-O-sulfate and 
3-O-glucuronide of isoferulic acid, dihydro(iso)ferulic acid-3-O-glucuronide, 
and dihydrocaffeic acid-3-O-glucuronide. Overall, the 119.9 mumol excretion of 
the chlorogenic acid metabolites corresponded to 29.1% of intake, indicating 
that as well as being subject to extensive metabolism, chlorogenic acids in 
coffee are well absorbed. Pathways for the formation of the various metabolites 
within the body are proposed. Urinary dihydrocaffeic acid-3-O-sulfate and 
feruloylglycine are potentially very sensitive biomarkers for the consumption of 
relatively small amounts of coffee.

Molecular definition of the taste of roasted cocoa nibs (Theobroma cacao) by 
means of quantitative studies and sensory experiments.

D-85748 Garching, Germany.

Sensory-guided decomposition of roasted cocoa nibs revealed that, besides 
theobromine and caffeine, a series of bitter-tasting 2,5-diketopiperazines and 
flavan-3-ols were the key inducers of the bitter taste as well as the astringent 
mouthfeel imparted upon consumption of roasted cocoa. In addition, a number of 
polyphenol glycopyranosides as well as a series of N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino 
acids have been identified as key astringent compounds of roasted cocoa. In the 
present investigation, a total of 84 putative taste compounds were quantified in 
roasted cocoa beans and then rated for the taste contribution on the basis of 
dose-over-threshold (DoT) factors to bridge the gap between pure structural 
chemistry and human taste perception. To verify these quantitative results, an 
aqueous taste reconstitute was prepared by blending aqueous solutions of the 
individual taste compounds in their ""natural"" concentrations. Sensory analyses 
revealed that the taste profile of this artificial cocktail was very close to 
the taste profile of an aqueous suspension of roasted cocoa nibs. To further 
narrow down the number of key taste compounds, finally, taste omission 
experiments and human dose/response functions were performed, demonstrating that 
the bitter-tasting alkaloids theobromine and caffeine, seven bitter-tasting 
diketopiperazines, seven bitter- and astringent-tasting flavan-3-ols, six 
puckering astringent N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino acids, four velvety astringent 
flavonol glycosides, gamma-aminobutyric acid, beta-aminoisobutyric acid, and six 
organic acids are the key organoleptics of the roasted cocoa nibs.

Determination of flavonoids and stilbenes in red wine and related biological 
products by HPLC and HPLC-ESI-MS-MS.

University, Innsbruck, Austria.

To investigate probable health benefits of flavonoids and stilbenes in red wine 
a new reversed-phase (RP) high-performance liquid-chromatographic (HPLC) method 
with enhanced separation efficiency and improved selectivity, sensitivity, and 
speed has been established for determination of the flavonoids quercetin, 
myricetin and kaempferol and the stilbenes cis- and trans-resveratrol, in a 
single run . UV-absorbance, fluorescence (FLD), and mass-spectrometric (MS) 
detection were also evaluated. UV-absorbance detection at 320 nm for stilbenes 
and 377 nm for flavonoids enables their determination up to the nanogram range 
with a linearity of R2>0.9999 (linear range 50 ng mL(-1)-50 microg mL(-1)). 
Calculated values of average recoveries were between 95 and 105% for all 
analytes. For resveratrol, fluorescence detection was highly selective and twice 
as sensitive as UV detection, and linearity was satisfactory (R2>0.9996; linear 
range see UV detection). For the detection of the hydrophilic glycosidic 
compounds piceid and rutin, which are coeluted with other hydrophilic 
ingredients, the validated RP HPLC system was coupled to a quadrupole ion-trap 
mass-spectrometer (MS) via an electrospray interface (ESI) with 25% ammonia 
solution as sheath liquid. MS detection was, highly linear (R2>0.9878; linear 
range 50 ng mL(-1)-50 microg mL(-1)) for all investigated analytes and the 
limits of detection were in the low nanogram range. Compared with UV detection 
MS detection resulted in a 200% increase in signal intensity for myricetin and 
400% increases for quercetin and kaempferol, but equal signal intensity for 
resveratrol. Calculated values of average recoveries were 102% for myricetin and 
79% for piceid. Collision induced dissociation (CID) was also used to obtain 
characteristic fragmentation fingerprints to facilitate qualitative and 
quantitative analysis even in complex matrices. Finally, this hyphenated 
HPLC-ESI-MS method was highly suitable and an essential improvement compared 
with UV- and fluorescence detection.

A method for quantitation of six prenylflavonoids (xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, 
desmethylxanthohumol, 6- and 8-prenylnaringenins and 6-geranylnaringenin) in 
hops and beer by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry has been developed. The method 
allows direct analysis of beer and crude methanolic extracts of hops. After HPLC 
separation, prenylflavonoids were detected by positive ion multiple-reaction 
monitoring using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a heated 
nebulizer--atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface. The accuracy and 
precision were evaluated by replicate analyses of (spiked) samples. Thirteen 
commercial beers were analysed with the method. Isoxanthohumol, formed by 
isomerization of xanthohumol during the brewing process, was the most abundant 
flavonoid in hopped beers, ranging from 0.04 to 3.44 mg/l.

The flavonol contents of 20 varieties of tomato fruit were investigated in 
relation to variety, size, season, and country of origin. Ten commonly consumed 
tomato-based food products were also assessed. Free and conjugated flavonols 
were identified and quantified using reversed-phase HPLC. Ninety-eight percent 
of flavonols detected in tomatoes were found to occur in the skin. Tomatoes 
contained, primarily as conjugates, quercetin and kaempferol. The main quercetin 
conjugate was identified as rutin (quercetin 3-rhamnosylglucoside) by LC-MS. The 
total flavonol content of the different varieties of tomato that were analyzed 
varied from 1.3 to 22.2 microgram/g of fresh weight (fw). Smaller cherry tomato 
fruits originating from warm sunny climates, such as Spain and Israel, were 
found to contain the highest concentration of flavonols. Among the tomato-based 
products investigated, tomato juice and tomato purée were rich in flavonols, 
containing 14-16 microgram/mL and 70 microgram/g fw, respectively. In contrast 
to fresh tomatoes, most tomato-based products contained significant amounts of 
free flavonols.

Teas represent a rich source of dietary antioxidants. This paper describes 
analysis of the antioxidant potential of individual tea phenolics using an 
on-line high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Tea phenolics from 
Kenyan green and black teas were identified using liquid chromatography--mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) in conjunction with the analysis of their 
2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS+) radical scavenging 
ability. Antioxidant potential of flavan-3-ols, caffeoylquinic acids, flavonols, 
and theaflavins was assessed in comparison to the synthetic vitamin E analogue 
Trolox. (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate was identified as the most potent 
antioxidant with a Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) value of 3.0, 
contributing approximately 30% of the total antioxidant capacity of green tea. 
Theaflavins retained antioxidant capacity similar to that of (-)-epicatechin 
monomers whilst conjugated flavonols did not contribute significantly to the 
antioxidant capacity of either green or black tea. After HPLC analysis of the 
antioxidant capacity of phenolics in black tea some 80% of antioxidant activity 
remained unaccounted for indicating the potential importance of thearubigens as 
antioxidants in black teas.

Eleven subjects completed a clinical trial to determine the safety/tolerability 
of freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB) and to measure, in plasma and urine, 
specific anthocyanins-cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-sambubioside, 
cyanidin-3-rutinoside, and cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside, as well as ellagic 
acid. Subjects were fed 45 g of freeze-dried BRB daily for 7 days. Blood samples 
were collected predose on days 1 and 7 and at 10 time points postdose. Urine was 
collected for 12 hours predose on days 1 and 7 and at three 4-hour intervals 
postdose. Maximum concentrations of anthocyanins and ellagic acid in plasma 
occurred at 1 to 2 hours, and maximum quantities in urine appeared from 0 to 4 
hours. Overall, less than 1% of these compounds were absorbed and excreted in 
urine. None of the pharmacokinetic parameters changed significantly between days 
1 and 7. In conclusion, 45 g of freeze-dried BRB daily are well tolerated and 
result in quantifiable anthocyanins and ellagic acid in plasma and urine.

BACKGROUND: The organic food sales have been increasing during the recent years. 
It has been hypothesised that organically grown fruits are healthier based on 
their higher content of phytochemicals. However, data on the bioavailability of 
phytochemicals from organically or conventionally produced plant foods are 
scarce.
METHODS: Two human intervention studies were performed to compare the 
bioavailability of polyphenols in healthy men after ingestion of apples from 
different farming systems. The administered apples were grown organically and 
conventionally under defined conditions and characterised regarding their 
polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity. No significant differences in the 
polyphenol content and the antioxidant capacity from the organic and 
conventional farming system were observed.
RESULTS: In the short-term intervention study, six men consumed either 
organically or conventionally produced apples in a randomized cross-over study. 
After intake of 1 kg apples, phloretin (C (max) 13 + or - 5 nmol/l, t (max) 1.7 
+ or - 1.2 h) and coumaric acid (C (max )35 + or - 12 nmol/l, t (max) 3.0 + or - 
0.8 h) plasma concentrations increased significantly (P < 0.0001) in both 
intervention groups, without differences between the two farming systems. In the 
long-term intervention study, 43 healthy volunteers consumed organically or 
conventionally produced apples (500 g/day; 4 weeks) or no apples in a 
double-blind, randomized intervention study. In this study, 24 h after the last 
dosing regime, the apple intake did not result in increasing polyphenol 
concentrations in plasma and urine compared to the control group suggesting no 
accumulation of apple polyphenols or degradation products in humans.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the two farming systems 
(organic/conventional) do not result in differences in the bioavailability of 
apple polyphenols.

An extract from flaxseed containing oligomeric structures of the phenolic 
glucosides secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), p-coumaric acid glucoside and 
ferulic acid glucoside was fractionated into three oligomeric fractions (F50, 
F60 and F70) by reversed phase liquid chromatography and further subfractionated 
by Sepharose CL-6B. The F50 fraction, which had the highest proportion of 
hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides, was also fractionated on Sephadex LH-20 
according to hydrophobicity and size. The different separations resulted in 
complex profiles of UV-absorbing molecules. HPLC analyses indicated that 
reversed-phase chromatography separated the oligomers according to composition 
of the phenolic glucosides, while the subfractionation revealed that other 
structural features of the oligomers were also important. Using the DPPH 
radical, SDG and oligomeric fractions showed similar hydrogen-donating abilities 
comparable to ferulic acid but higher than α-tocopherol, which suggests that SDG 
was the only active antioxidant.

Three phenolic glucosides, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, p-coumaric acid 
glucoside and ferulic acid glucoside, were analyzed in commercial breads 
containing flaxseed. The total phenolic glucoside content ranged from 15 to 
157mg/100g dry bread. Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside was the dominating 
phenolic glucoside with an average relative content of 62%, followed by 
p-coumaric acid glucoside (20%) and ferulic acid glucoside (18%). Strong 
positive correlations between the phenolic glucosides were found, indicating no 
major effect of raw material or bread-making process on the relative content of 
the phenolic glucosides in flaxseed.

and Forestry, Zemedelská 1, CZ-613 00 Brno, Czech Republic.

This research studies in detail the contents of phenolic compounds determined by 
the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and the antioxidant activities determined by the 
TEAC (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity), DPPH (using 
diphenyl-p-picrylhydrazyl radical), and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) 
methods, and their correlations for used standards with these methods 
(catechine, gallic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, Trolox, ascorbic acid, and 
ferrous sulfate) and extracts from several species of commonly consumed 
vegetables were studied in detail. The comparison of absolute values of 
absorption coefficients for used standards and for individual methods allows one 
to choose optimal common standards for methods to be compared. The procedures 
applied for the same sets of the extracts using identical calibration procedures 
and common standards allowed better comparison of the results obtained by the 
TEAC, DPPH, and FRAP methods. The values of content of phenolic substances and 
total antioxidant activity of the sets of samples correlate very well for all 
used methods. The very high values of antioxidant activity were found in 
intensely colored vegetables (red cabbage, red onion, etc.), and the values were 
very low in watery vegetables such as potato, marrow, and cucumber.

USA.

Consumption of fruits and vegetables has been associated with reduced risk of 
chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Phytochemicals, 
especially phenolics, in fruits and vegetables are suggested to be the major 
bioactive compounds for the health benefits. However, the phenolic contents and 
their antioxidant activities in fruits and vegetables were underestimated in the 
literature, because bound phenolics were not included. This study was designed 
to investigate the profiles of total phenolics, including both soluble free and 
bound forms in common fruits, by applying solvent extraction, base digestion, 
and solid-phase extraction methods. Cranberry had the highest total phenolic 
content, followed by apple, red grape, strawberry, pineapple, banana, peach, 
lemon, orange, pear, and grapefruit. Total antioxidant activity was measured 
using the TOSC assay. Cranberry had the highest total antioxidant activity 
(177.0 +/- 4.3 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of fruit), followed by apple, red 
grape, strawberry, peach, lemon, pear, banana, orange, grapefruit, and 
pineapple. Antiproliferation activities were also studied in vitro using HepG(2) 
human liver-cancer cells, and cranberry showed the highest inhibitory effect 
with an EC(50) of 14.5 +/- 0.5 mg/mL, followed by lemon, apple, strawberry, red 
grape, banana, grapefruit, and peach. A bioactivity index (BI) for dietary 
cancer prevention is proposed to provide a new alternative biomarker for future 
epidemiological studies in dietary cancer prevention and health promotion.

BACKGROUND: Consumer demand for products rich in phytochemicals is increasing as 
a result of greater awareness of their potential health benefits. However, 
processed products are stored for long-term and the phytochemicals are 
susceptible to degradation during storage. The objective of this study was to 
assess the storage effects on phytochemicals in thermally processed blueberries. 
Thermally processed canned berries and juice/puree were analysed for 
phytochemicals during their long-term storage.
RESULTS: The phytochemical retention of thermally processed blueberries during 
storage was not influenced by production system (conventional versus organic). 
During 13 months of storage, total anthocyanins, total phenolics and total 
antioxidant activity in canned blueberry solids decreased by up to 86, 69 and 
52% respectively. In canned blueberry syrup, total anthocyanins and total 
antioxidant activity decreased by up to 68 and 15% respectively, while total 
phenolic content increased by up to 117%. Similar trends in phytochemical 
content were observed in juice/puree stored for 4 months. The extent of changes 
in phytochemicals of thermally processed blueberries during storage was 
significantly influenced by blanching.
CONCLUSION: Long-term storage of thermally processed blueberries had varying 
degrees of influence on degradation of total anthocyanins, total phenolics and 
total antioxidant activity. Blanching before thermal processing helped to 
preserve the phytochemicals during storage of blueberries.

Anthocyanins are present in human diet due to their wide occurrence in fruits 
and beverages. They possess antioxidant activities and could be involved in 
several health effects. The aim of this study was to investigate anthocyanin 
metabolism and distribution in the digestive area organs (stomach, jejunum and 
liver) and kidney, as well as a target tissue (brain) in rats fed with a 
blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.) anthocyanin-enriched diet for 15 days. 
Identification and quantification of anthocyanin metabolites was carried out by 
HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC-DAD, respectively. The stomach exhibited only native 
blackberry anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-pentose), while 
in other organs (jejunum, liver, and kidney) native and methylated anthocyanins 
as well as conjugated anthocyanidins (cyanidin and peonidin monoglucuronides) 
were identified. Proportions of anthocyanin derivatives differed according to 
the organ considered, with the liver presenting the highest proportion of 
methylated forms. Jejunum and plasma also contained aglycone forms. In the 
brain, total anthocyanin content (blackberry anthocyanins and peonidin 
3-O-glucoside) reached 0.25 +/- 0.05 nmol/g of tissue (n = 6). The urinary 
excretion of total anthocyanins was low (0.19 +/- 0.02% of the ingested amount). 
Thus, organs of the digestive area indicated a metabolic pathway of anthocyanins 
with enzymatic conversions (methylation and/or glucurono-conjugation). Moreover, 
following consumption of an anthocyanin-rich diet, anthocyanins enter the brain.

77843-2133, USA.

Physicochemical analysis of processed strained product was performed on 10 
carrot genotypes grown in Texas (TX) and Georgia (GA). Carrots from GA 
experienced hail damage during growth, resulting in damage to their tops. 
Measurements included pH, moisture, soluble phenolics, total carotenoids, 
sugars, organic acids, and isocoumarin (6-MM). Sensory analysis was conducted 
using a trained panel to evaluate relationships between chemical and sensory 
attributes of the genotypes and in carrots spiked with increasing levels of 
6-MM. Preharvest stress conditions in GA carrots seemed to elicit a phytoalexic 
response, producing compounds that impacted the perception of bitter and sour 
flavors. Spiking 6-MM into strained carrots demonstrated the role bitter 
compounds have in lowering sweetness scores while increasing the perception of 
sour flavor. Screening fresh carrots for the phytoalexin 6-MM has the potential 
to significantly improve the sensory quality of processed products.

This investigation evaluated the content and profile of flavanoid and phenolic 
acid compounds present in nine Vaccinium species that included domestic 
blueberry cultivars and sample collections from undomesticated colonies. The 
study was focused in two areas of inquiry. The first involved extracting and 
analyzing the berries for total phenolics (TPH), total anthocyanins (ACY), and 
the antioxidant capacity. Vaccinium species differ in their polyphenolic 
content, and these high TPH and ACY levels are correlated to their antioxidant 
capacity. Second, berry extracts were analyzed by high-performance liquid 
chromatography equipped with photodiode array and mass spectrometric detectors 
to determine the content and profile of selected bioactive compounds. The 
flavanoid analytes of interest included the anthocyanidins, flavan-3-ols, and 
flavonol aglycons, as well as specific phenolic acid components. This 
semicomprehensive analysis begins to characterize the phytochemical profiles and 
illustrates the differences in the content of polyphenolic compounds present 
within these Vaccinium species.

Research), Food Toxicology Division, Mahatma Gandhi Marg, PO Box 80, 
Lucknow-226001, U.P., India.

A method using simple extraction and 2-directional high-performance thin-layer 
chromatography (HPTLC) was developed for the simultaneous determination of 
curcumin, metanil yellow, and sudan dyes in turmeric, chili, and various mixed 
curry powder formulations. The method offers resolution (Rf) of turmeric 
pigments, namely, curcumin (0.77), demethoxycurcumin (0.69), 
bis(demethoxy)curcumin (0.61), and the synthetic dye metanil yellow (0.05) by 
the first-directional mobile phase, chloroform-methanol (9 + 1, v/v). The 
resolution (Rf) of sudan I (0.30) and sudan IV (0.23) was achieved by the 
second-directional mobile phase, toluene-hexane-acetic acid (50 + 50 + 1, 
v/v/v). Natural pigments of both turmeric and chili showed no interference in 
the detection and quantification of synthetic colors. The limit of detection and 
limit of quantification values for curcumin, metanil yellow, sudan I, and sudan 
IV were 17.39, 42.90, 15.45, and 7.01 and 52.71,130.0, 46.80, and 21.24 ng/spot, 
respectively. Analysis of a few market samples showed the presence of metanil 
yellow (1.5-4.6 mg/g), sudan I (4.8-12.1 mg/g), and sudan IV (0.9-2.0 mg/g) in 
loose turmeric and chili samples, whereas the curcumin content in turmeric and 
mixed curry powder samples ranged from 6.5 to 36.4 and from 0.3 to 1.9 mg/g, 
respectively. The method is relatively simple, offers reasonable sensitivity, 
and can be used to screen a large number of samples.

Phytoestrogens may play a role in hormone-related diseases such as cancer, but 
epidemiological and clinical data are conflicting in part due to inadequate 
databases used in intake estimation. A database of nine phytoestrogens in foods 
relevant to Western diets was developed to more accurately estimate intakes. 
Foods (N = 121) available in Ontario, Canada were prepared as commonly consumed 
and analyzed for isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, glycitein, formononetin), 
lignans (secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, pinoresinol, lariciresinol), and 
coumestan (coumestrol) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. Data 
were presented on an as is (wet) basis per 100 g and per serving. Food groups 
with decreasing levels of total phytoestrogens per 100 g are nuts and oilseeds, 
soy products, cereals and breads, legumes, meat products, and other processed 
foods that may contain soy, vegetables, fruits, alcoholic, and nonalcoholic 
beverages. Soy products contain the highest amounts of isoflavone, followed by 
legumes, meat products and other processed foods, cereals and breads, nuts and 
oilseeds, vegetables, alcoholic beverages, fruits, and nonalcoholic beverages. 
Decreasing amounts of lignans are found in nuts and oilseeds, cereals and 
breads, legumes, fruits, vegetables, soy products, processed foods, alcoholic, 
and nonalcoholic beverages. The richest sources of specific phytoestrogens, 
including coumestrol, were identified. The database will improve phytoestrogen 
intake estimation in future epidemiological and clinical studies particularly in 
Western populations.

Anthocyanins are the most abundant phenolic compounds, widely distributed in 
fruits and vegetables, and exhibit potent antioxidant capacity. Humans ingest a 
significant amount of anthocyanins in the daily diet. The objective of the 
current study was to examine human absorption and metabolism of black raspberry 
anthocyanins when administered at high doses (2.69 +/- 0.085 g/day). Ten healthy 
men consumed 45 g of freeze-dried black raspberries daily for 1 week. Urine 
samples were collected over a 12 h period in 4 h intervals at day 1 and day 7. 
Urinary anthocyanins were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography 
coupled to a photodiode array detector and a tandem mass spectrometer using 
precursor ion and product ion analyses. Anthocyanins were excreted in intact 
forms and metabolized into methylated derivatives in human urine. The urinary 
excretion of anthocyanins reached a maximum concentration (1091.8 +/- 1081.3 
pmol/L, n = 10) during the 4-8 h period after black raspberry ingestion. As 
compared to the anthocyanin distribution in black raspberries, urinary cyanidin 
3-xylosylrutinoside was detected at a higher concentration than that of 
cyanidin-3-rutinoside.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) has become a critical global public health issue 
worldwide. Tartary buckwheat extracts exhibit potential therapeutic effects 
against ALD due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. However, in 
vivo pharmacokinetics and metabolite identification of tartary buckwheat 
extracts have not been clearly elucidated. Accordingly, the current manuscript 
aimed to investigate pharmacokinetics and to identify novel metabolites in 
beagle dogs following oral co-administration of tartary buckwheat extracts and 
ethanol. To support pharmacokinetic study, a simple LC-MS/MS method was 
developed and validated for simultaneous determination of quercetin and 
kaempferol in beagle dog plasma. The conjugated forms of both analytes were 
hydrolyzed by β-glucuronidase and sulfatase followed by liquid-liquid extraction 
using methyl tert-butyl ether. In addition, another effective approach was 
established using advanced ultrafast liquid chromatography coupled with a 
Q-Exactive hybrid quadrupole orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometer to 
identify the metabolites in beagle dog biological samples including urine, 
feces, and plasma. The pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that the absolute oral 
bioavailability for quercetin and kaempferol was determined to be 4.6% and 1.6%, 
respectively. Oral bioavailability of quercetin and kaempferol was limited in 
dogs probably due to poor absorption, significant first pass effect, and biliary 
elimination, etc. Using high resolution mass spectrometric analysis, a total of 
nine novel metabolites were identified for the first time and metabolic pathways 
included methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfation. In vivo pharmacokinetics 
and metabolite identification results provided preclinical support of 
co-administration of tartary buckwheat extracts and ethanol in humans.

This study reports tannin contents of various tea (19), beer (6) and wine (6) 
samples, produced or sold in Turkey under different brand names. Determinations 
were carried out by employing a previously reported UV-vis spectrophotometric 
method. The standard addition procedure was also compared to the direct 
determination procedure and found to be more reliable. The tannin contents of 
hot water extracts of tea, tea bag and herbal tea samples ranged between 
6.20-8.33, 8.03-6.59 and 2.76-6.54 percent (w/w) respectively. Tannin contents 
of beer and wine samples determined without extraction were found ranging 
between 66.36-77.26 and 67.18-107.62 micrograms/mL respectively. Iron contents 
of analysed wine samples were also found ranging between 0.36 and 10.33 ppm by 
AAS and no relation is found between tannin and iron contents.

The phenolic compounds of 25 peach, nectarine, and plum cultivars were studied 
and quantified by HPLC-DAD-ESIMS. Hydroxycinnamates, procyanidins, flavonols, 
and anthocyanins were detected and quantified. White and yellow flesh nectarines 
and peaches, and yellow and red plums, were analyzed at two different maturity 
stages with consideration of both peel and flesh tissues. HPLC-MS analyses 
allowed the identification of procyanidin dimers of the B- and A-types, as well 
as the presence of procyanidin trimers in plums. As a general rule, the peel 
tissues contained higher amounts of phenolics, and anthocyanins and flavonols 
were almost exclusively located in this tissue. No clear differences in the 
phenolic content of nectarines and peaches were detected or between white flesh 
and yellow flesh cultivars. There was no clear trend in phenolic content with 
ripening of the different cultivars. Some cultivars, however, had a very high 
phenolic content. For example, the white flesh nectarine cultivar Brite Pearl 
(350-460 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 430-550 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) and 
the yellow flesh cv. Red Jim (180-190 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 210-330 mg/kg 
procyanidins in flesh), contained 10 times more phenolics than cultivars such as 
Fire Pearl (38-50 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 23-30 mg/kg procyanidins in 
flesh). Among white flesh peaches, cultivars Snow King (300-320 mg/kg 
hydroxycinnamates and 660-695 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) and Snow Giant 
(125-130 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 520-540 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) showed 
the highest content. The plum cultivars Black Beaut and Angeleno were especially 
rich in phenolics.

Cocoa is a food rich in polyphenols, mainly the flavonoid procyanidins and 
flavan-3-ols. The improvement of the cardiovascular function in humans upon 
cocoa consumption has been specifically linked to the presence of flavan-3-ol 
derived metabolites in plasma, especially epicatechin glucuronide. In this 
context, a flavonoid-enriched cocoa-derived product could potentially exert 
stronger health benefits. The aim of the present study was to obtain a cocoa 
powder with a higher flavonoid content (mainly enriched in monomer compounds) 
and assess its flavonoid bioavailability in humans. For this purpose, an 
unfermented, nonroasted, and blanch-treated cocoa powder (A) was obtained. The 
powder contained four times more procyanidins than a conventional (B) cocoa 
powder. Powder A contained eight times more epicatechin and procyanidin B2 than 
powder B. Cocoa milk drinks were prepared with powder A (MDA) and B (MDB). The 
bioavailability of flavonoids in both drinks was assessed in a crossover 
intervention with healthy volunteers. The content of epicatechin glucuronide, 
the main metabolite detected in plasma, was five-fold higher upon consumption of 
MDA as compared with MDB. The urinary excretion of metabolites, mainly methyl 
epicatechin sulfate, was higher upon MDA consumption as compared with MDB, 
ranging from two- to 12-fold higher depending on the metabolite. These results, 
together with previous reports regarding the cardiovascular benefits linked to 
the presence of procyanidin metabolites in plasma, suggest that further clinical 
trials to validate the health benefits of a flavonoid-enriched cocoa powder are 
warranted.

All drying processes increased oil content, antioxidant activity, total phenolic 
contents, and most of the phenolic compounds in the pulp, peel and seeds of both 
ripe fruits with varied degrees (p < 0.05). In addition, the processes reduced 
the oil contents, linoleic acids, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, (+)-catechin, and 
naringenin of the pulp, antioxidant activity of the peels and seeds, and 
3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, (+)-catechin of the seeds and it enhanced all other 
parameters in the pulp, peel, and seeds of unripe fruits (p < 0.05). Comparing 
the phenolic profiles of avocado pulp, peels, and seeds of ripe and unripe 
fruits indicated that the peel and seeds are richer than the pulp and that is 
superior in unripe fruits than ripe ones. In addition, drying processes 
particularly microwave and air drying greatly enhanced the bioactive properties 
of ripe and unripe avocado fruits and could thus be used to elongate the 
shelf-life of avocado fruit products without major impact on the overall 
quality.

Consumption of flavonoid-rich foods and beverages is thought to reduce the risk 
of cardiovascular diseases. Whereas the biological activities of flavonoids have 
been characterized in vitro, there are no clear experimental data demonstrating 
that chronic dietary intake and intestinal absorption of flavonoids actually 
protects the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury. We tested whether 
long-term consumption of specific flavonoids (anthocyanins) included in normal 
food could render the heart of rats more resistant to myocardial infarction. 
Maize kernels that differed specifically in their accumulation of anthocyanins 
were used to prepare rodent food in which anthocyanins were either present or 
absent. Male Wistar rats were fed the anthocyanin-rich (ACN-rich) or the 
anthocyanin-free (ACN-free) diet for a period of 8 wk. Anthocyanins were 
significantly absorbed and detected in the blood and urine of only rats fed the 
ACN-rich diet. In Langendorff preparations, the hearts of rats fed the ACN-rich 
diet were more resistant to regional ischemia and reperfusion insult. Moreover, 
on an in vivo model of coronary occlusion and reperfusion, infarct size was 
reduced in rats that ate the ACN-rich diet than in those that consumed the 
ACN-free diet (P < 0.01). Cardioprotection was associated with increased 
myocardial glutathione levels, suggesting that dietary anthocyanins might 
modulate cardiac antioxidant defenses. Our findings suggest important potential 
health benefits of foods rich in anthocyanins and emphasize the need to develop 
anthocyanin-rich functional foods with protective activities for promoting human 
health.

Rats were fed a grape seed extract (GSE) containing (+)-catechin, 
(-)-epicatechin and dimers, trimers, tetramers and polymeric procyanidins. 
Liver, kidney, brain and gastrointestinal (GI) tract together with plasma, urine 
and faeces were collected over a 24 h period and their flavan-3-ol content was 
analysed by HPLC with tandem mass spectrometry and diode array detection. Small 
amounts of the GSE flavan-3-ols moved out of the stomach and into the 
duodenum/jejunum, and to a greater extent the ileum 1 h after ingestion, and 
into the caecum after 2 h with relatively small amounts being detected in the 
colon after 3 h. The GI tract contained the parent GSE flavan-3-ols and 
procyanidins with only trace amounts of metabolites and there were no 
indications that proanthocyanidins were depolymerised in the GI tract releasing 
monomeric flavan-3-ols. Plasma contained exclusively catechin glucuronides and 
methylated glucuronide metabolites which were also detected in the liver and 
kidneys. These metabolites were also present in urine together with sulphated 
metabolites and low amounts of the procyanidin dimers B1, B2, B3 and B4 as well 
as the trimer C2 and an unknown GSE trimer. The amounts of (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin metabolites excreted in urine relative to the quantity of the 
monomers ingested were 27 and 36 %, respectively, after 24 h. This is similar to 
the levels of urinary excretion reported to occur by other investigators after 
feeding (-)-epicatechin to rats and provides further, albeit indirect, evidence 
that the procyanidin oligomers in the GSE were not depolymerised to monomers to 
any extent after ingestion. No convincing analytical data were obtained for the 
presence of flavan-3-ol metabolites in the brain.

Polyphenolic compounds of apple may play an important role in physiologic 
functions related to human health. Different polyphenolics may have varied 
biological activities including antioxidant activity. The objective of this 
study was to investigate the profiles of polyphenolic compounds in different 
apple varieties and different parts of an apple. The total and individual 
polyphenolics differed significantly among the eight apple cultivars grown in 
Ontario, and the peels had higher concentrations than the flesh. Among the 
tested cultivars, Red Delicious and Northern Spy had the highest concentrations 
and Empire the lowest. Five major polyphenolic groups with a total of 16 
identified individual compounds were found, among which the dihydroxycinnamic 
acid esters, phloretin glycosides, and flavan-3-ols were found in both flesh and 
peel, whereas quercetin glycosides were almost exclusively found in the peel. 
Cyanidin 3-galactoside was unique to and found only in red apple peels. In both 
apple peel and flesh, the predominant group of polyphenolics was the 
procyanidins, followed by quercetin glycosides in the peel and hydroxycinnamic 
acid esters in the flesh. 3-Hydroxyphloretin 2'-xyloglucoside was newly 
identified in apple. The results obtained in this study will further the 
understanding of the polyphenolic composition of apples and their roles in 
health-promoting physiological functions.

Black rice (BR) is beneficial for the health of animals and humans. Herein, we 
investigated the pharmacokinetics of cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), a major 
anthocyanin constituent of BR, in male rats. After its intravenous 
administration, C3G was rapidly distributed throughout the body and disappeared 
from the plasma. Its cumulative urinary excretion accounted for less than 20% of 
the dose administered. After a single dose of BR extract (C3G40) containing C3G 
was orally administered (300 mg C3G/kg body weight), the C3G plasma 
concentration peaked at 30 min and then rapidly declined within 4 h. The extent 
of the cumulative urinary excretion of C3G, together with the area under the 
curve (AUC) of the plasma C3G concentration, indicated a bioavailability of 
approximately 0.5-1.5%. These results suggest that C3G was rapidly absorbed from 
the gastrointestinal tract in rats; however, its plasma concentration was very 
low. We also examined the enhancing effect of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), a 
pungent component of wasabi, on the gastrointestinal absorption of C3G in rats. 
Following the co-administration of C3G with AITC dissolved in PEG200, the 
urinary excretion and AUC of C3G were 4.5- and 2.7-fold higher than those in the 
control group (without AITC) (p<0.01), respectively. This is the first study to 
show that the gastrointestinal absorption of BR anthocyanins is promoted by 
AITC.

Hydroxytyrosol is quantitatively and qualitatively the principal phenolic 
antioxidant in olive oil. Recently it was shown that hydroxytyrosol and five 
metabolites were excreted in urine when hydroxytyrosol was dosed intravenously 
or orally in an olive oil solution to rats. The conclusive identification of 
three metabolites of hydroxytyrosol by MS/MS as a monosulfate conjugate, a 
3-O-glucuronide conjugate, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid 
(homovanillic acid) has been established in this investigation. The structural 
configurations of the glucuronide conjugate and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic 
acid were confirmed by (1)H NMR. The radical scavenging potencies of 
homovanillic acid, homovanillic alcohol, hydroxytyrosol, and the metabolites 
were examined with the radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. These studies 
showed them to be potent antioxidants with SC(50) values of 14.8 and 11.4 microM 
for homovanillic acid and homovanillic alcohol, respectively. The 
3-O-glucuronide conjugate was more potent than hydroxytyrosol, with an SC(50) of 
2.3 in comparison to 11.0 microM, and the monosulfate conjugate was almost 
devoid of radical scavenging activity.

The effect of fresh-cutting and subsequent cold storage on phenolic compounds 
from five long-term-stored potato cultivars (Agria, Cara, Liseta, Monalisa, and 
Spunta) was studied. Fresh-cutting induced the biosynthesis of three flavonols, 
which were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESIMS as quercetin 3-rutinoside, quercetin 
3-diglucoside, and quercetin 3-glucosylrutinoside. The flavonols were detected 
after a lag period of 3 days of cold storage. The content ranged from 6 to 14 
mg/100 g of fresh weight depending on the cultivar after 6 days of storage. 
Chlorogenic acid as the main caffeic acid derivative and the amino acids 
tyrosine and tryptophan were also quantified. The effect of cold storage under 
light or in dark was studied with new-season-harvested Monalisa potatoes. The 
flavonol induction was higher in fresh-cut potatoes stored under light than in 
the dark. However, caffeic acid derivatives were not affected. Domestic cooking 
such as boiling, microwaving, and frying provoked a partial loss of the 
flavonols, which were retained in the range of 4-16 mg per serving (213 g). 
Steam-cooking resulted in the highest retention of caffeic acid derivatives and 
aromatic amino acids compared with the other cooking methods studied. This means 
that due to the large amount of potatoes consumed in the Western diet, fresh-cut 
potatoes can be a significant source of health-promoting phenolics.

PURPOSE: Some studies have suggested that Glycated albumin (GA) may represent a 
useful biomarker in pregnant women for diagnosing and monitoring gestational 
diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, whether GA is a sufficiently accurate marker 
to screen GDM in a general population of pregnant women remains unclear. The 
current study aimed to investigate the role of GA in screening GDM in Chinese 
pregnant women.
METHODS: In this study, 298 Chinese women between 24-28 weeks of gestation were 
included. A total number of 247 women with normal glucose tolerance and 51 with 
GDM were identified according to the glucose levels detection. GA concentrations 
(GA%) were measured using three different kits, all of which utilized the 
ketoamine oxidase method for analysis.
RESULTS: Firstly, we found the GA% levels of the GDM group were significantly 
higher than those of healthy control. Specifically, the GA% level of the healthy 
control using Lucica, Maccura, Gcell was respectively 12.86 ± 0.8458, 
13.40 ± 0.9344 or 10.98 ± 1.009, while that of the GDM patients was respectively 
13.21 ± 1.101, 13.78 ± 1.219 and 11.44 ± 1.449. Then, the Receiving operator 
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that the areas under the curve 
(AUC) of all kits were less than 0.7 (Lucica, AUC = 0.6149; Maccura, 
AUC = 0.6140; Gcell, AUC = 0.6078), which do not provide support for the 
utilization of GA as a screening tool for GDM.
CONCLUSION: GA is not a good indicator for screening GDM initially.

BACKGROUND: Nutritional biomarkers are alternatives to traditional dietary 
assessment tools. We sought to develop a method for nutritional analysis of 
resveratrol, a phenolic compound with purported health-promoting properties, and 
to determine all resveratrol metabolites.
METHODS: We obtained LDL and urine samples from 11 healthy male volunteers who 
had consumed 250 mL of Merlot red wine. We measured resveratrol and its 
metabolites with 96-well solid-phase extraction plates coupled with HPLC-tandem 
mass spectrometry. Hexestrol was used as the internal standard. Gradient 
chromatography in multiple reaction monitoring mode was performed on a Luna 
C(18) column, maintained at 40 degrees C; m/z transitions were as follows: 
resveratrol, 227/185; resveratrol glucosides, 389/227; resveratrol glucuronides, 
403/227; resveratrol sulfates, 307/227; taxifolin, 303/285; and hexestrol, 
269/134.
RESULTS: Standard calibration curves were linear at 4.4-3289.5 nmol/L. Residual 
analyses were 100% (3.2) for trans-resveratrol and 100% (11.1) for trans-piceid. 
In both matrices, imprecision (CV) was <10.8% at all concentrations. Detection 
limits for resveratrol were 0.2 nmol/L (LDL), 0.3 nmol/L (synthetic urine), and 
4.0 nmol/L (blank urine). Resveratrol and metabolites were checked for 
stability, and no degradation was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry method enabled us to identify 
resveratrol sulfates in human LDL and to characterize the complete profile of 
resveratrol metabolism in human LDL and urine. This method provides an accurate 
index of exposure to resveratrol and its metabolites, which can be used as 
nutritional biomarkers for evaluating the biological effects of moderate wine 
intake on human health.

When discovered in the 50's, isoflavones were suspected to provoke infertility 
syndrome in sheep grazing on clover. Many others effects of these phytoestrogens 
have been documented afterwards. To determine the distribution of isoflavone 
metabolites in ewe tissues and look for a link with their physiological impact, 
two ewes were fed a diet containing 50% red clover silage (variety Pawera) for 
one month with a daily intake of 157.6 mg/kg bw of total isoflavones. Only 
aglycones were fed due to the fermentation stage of the silage. At the 
sacrifice, isoflavone metabolites and aglycones were analyzed in blood, liver, 
kidney, lung, heart, muscle, ovaries, uterus, mammary glands, suprarenal glands, 
thymus, aorta, thyroid, pituitary gland, cerebellum, olfactory lobes, and brain 
hemispheres using HPLC-Coularray and LC-MS-MS. The major compounds recovered in 
tissues were equol and daidzein, present as glucuronides. Kidney concentrations 
were 10-fold higher than in other tissues. Penetration in brain was very 
limited. Reproductive organs contained higher concentrations of isoflavones than 
heart, muscle, or thymus. Distribution of isoflavones in ewe tissues is unequal 
and may reflect specific impact in some target tissues.

Proanthocyanidins, flavonoids exhibiting cardiovascular protection, constitute a 
major fraction of the flavonoid ingested in the human diet. Although they are 
poorly absorbed, they are metabolized by the intestinal microbiota into various 
phenolic acids. An analytical method, based on an optimized 96-well plate 
solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure and liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS) for the analysis of 19 phenolic microbial 
metabolites and monomeric and dimeric flavanols in urine samples, was developed 
and validated. Human urine samples were obtained before and after ingestion of 
an acute consumption of 40 g of soluble cocoa powder and rat urines before and 
after the prolonged administration (2 weeks) of different diets composed of 
natural cocoa powder. The mean recovery of analytes using the new SPE-LC-MS/MS 
method ranged from 87% to 109%. Accuracy ranged from 87.5% to 113.8%, and 
precision met acceptance criteria (<15% relative standard deviation). 
Procyanidin B2 has been detected and quantified for the first time in human and 
rat urine after cocoa consumption. Changes in human and rat urinary levels of 
microbial phenolic acids and flavanols were in the range of 0.001-59.43 nmol/mg 
creatinine and of 0.004-181.56 nmol/mg creatinine, respectively. Major 
advantages of the method developed include reduction of laboratory work in the 
sample preparation step by the use of 96-well SPE plates and the sensitive

Nut skins are considered to be a rich source of polyphenols and may be partially 
responsible for the numerous health effects associated with nut consumption. 
However, more bioavailability studies of nut skin polyphenols are needed to 
understand the health effects derived from nut consumption. The aim of the 
present study was to determine the profiles of both phase II and 
microbial-derived phenolic metabolites in plasma and urine samples before and 
after the intake of almond skin polyphenols by healthy human subjects (n = 2). 
Glucuronide, O-methyl glucuronide, sulfate, and O-methyl sulfate derivatives of 
(epi)catechin, as well as the glucuronide conjugates of naringenin and 
glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of isorhamnetin, were detected in plasma and 
urine samples after consumption of almond skin polyphenols. The main 
microbial-derived metabolites of flavanols, such as 
5-(dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 
5-(hydroxymethoxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, were also detected in their 
glucuronide and sulfate forms. In addition, numerous metabolites derived from 
further microbial degradation of hydroxyphenylvalerolactones, including 
hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, hydroxycinnamic, hydroxybenzoic, 
and hydroxyhippuric acids, registered major changes in urine after the 
consumption of almond skin polyphenols. The urinary excretion of these microbial 
metabolites was estimated to account for a larger proportion of the total 
polyphenol ingested than phase II metabolites of (epi)catechin, indicating the 
important role of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism of highly polymerized 
almond skin polyphenols. To the authors' knowledge this study constitutes the 
most complete report of the absorption of almond skin polyphenols in humans.

The biological properties of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) polyphenols are strictly 
dependent on their bioavailability. A long-term cocoa feeding trial was 
performed with subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Subjects (n=42) 
received two sachets of 20 g of cocoa powder/day with 250 mL of skimmed milk 
each, or only 500 mL/day of skimmed milk, both for two 4-week periods. The 
phenolic metabolic profile including phase II conjugated metabolites and 
phenolic acids derived from the intestinal microbiota was determined by LC-MS/MS 
in both 24-h urine and fasting plasma. The analysis of 24-h urine revealed 
significant increases of phase II metabolites, including glucuronides and 
sulfate conjugates of (-)-epicatechin, O-methyl-epicatechin, 
5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 
5-(3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, after regular cocoa intake. 
In the case of plasma, only glucuronide conjugates of 
dihydroxyphenylvalerolactones increased. Regular consumption of cocoa also 
resulted in a significant increase in the urinary excretion of colonic 
microbial-derived phenolic metabolites, including vanillic, 
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acids, and particularly 
5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, whereas only the two latter 
metabolites showed a significant increase in fasting plasma. The results found 
herein indicate that 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 
hydroxyphenylacetic acids could be good biomarkers of the regular consumption of 
cocoa and therefore, of flavanol-rich foods.

Health effects of cocoa flavonols depend on their bioavailability, which is 
strongly influenced by the food matrix and the degree of flavanol 
polymerization. The effect of milk on the bioavailability of cocoa flavanoids 
considering phase II metabolites of epicatechin has been the subject of 
considerable debate. This work studies the effect of milk at the colonic 
microbial metabolism level of the nonabsorbed flavanol fraction that reaches the 
colon and is metabolized by the colonic microbiota into various phenolic acids. 
Twenty-one human volunteers followed a diet low in polyphenols for at least 48 h 
before taking, in a random order, 40 g of cocoa powder dissolved either in 250 
mL of whole milk or in 250 mL of water. Urine samples were collected before the 
intake and during three different periods (0-6, 6-12, and 12-24 h). Phenolic 
acids were analyzed by LC-MS/MS after solid-phase extraction. Of the 15 
metabolites assessed, the excretion of 9 phenolic acids was affected by the 
intake of milk. The urinary concentration of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, 
protocatechuic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, 4-hydroxyhippuric, hippuric, caffeic, and 
ferulic acids diminished after the intake of cocoa with milk, whereas urinary 
concentrations of vanillic and phenylacetic acids increased. In conclusion, milk 
partially affects the formation of microbial phenolic acids derived from the 
colonic degradation of procyanidins and other compounds present in cocoa powder.

A reversed-phase HPLC procedure is proposed for the determination of seven 
flavonoids (luteolin, nepetin, hispidulin, jaceosidin, cirsimaritin, 
cirsilineol, and eupatorin) in vervain samples. A simple extractive technique 
was developed, involving only extraction with ethyl ether, which allowed the 
elimination of phenolic acids, yielding a sufficiently purified flavonoid 
fraction. All of the analyzed vervain samples showed a common flavonoid pattern, 
in which hispidulin and jaceosidin were the major compounds and nepetin was the 
minor compound.

Total aliphatic and indole glucosinolates, phenolic compounds (flavonoids and 
hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives), and vitamin C contents were evaluated in freshly 
harvested broccoli (Brassica oleracea L., var. italica, cv. Marathon) 
inflorescences. These were film-wrapped and stored for 7 days at 1 degrees C to 
simulate a maximum period of commercial transport and distribution. After cold 
storage, inflorescences were kept for 3 days at 15 degrees C to simulate a 
retail sale period. For wrapping, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) of 11 microm 
thickness was used. Gas composition was about 17% O(2) and 2% CO(2) during cold 
storage and about 16% O(2) and 3-4% CO(2) during shelf life within packages. The 
predominant glucosinolates were 4-methylsulfinylbutyl-glucosinolate 
(glucoraphanin), 3-indolylmethyl-glucosinolate (glucobrassicin), and 
1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl-glucosinolate (neoglucobrassicin). The predominant 
hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives were identified as 1,2,2'-trisinapoylgentiobiose, 
1,2-diferuloylgentiobiose, 1,2'-disinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose, and 
3-O-caffeoyl-quinic (neochlorogenic acid). Results showed major losses at the 
end of both periods, in comparison with broccoli at harvest. Thus, the 
respective losses, at the end of cold storage and retail periods, were 71-80% of 
total glucosinolates, 62-59% of total flavonoids, 51-44% of sinapic acid 
derivatives, and 73-74% caffeoyl-quinic acid derivatives. Slight differences in 
all compound concentrations between storage and retail sale periods were 
detected. Distribution and retail periods had minimal effects on vitamin C. 
Weight loss was monitored at the end of both periods.

Orange juice is a very rich source of dietary flavanones. The effect of 
flavanone concentration and solubility of orange beverages on their 
bioavailability has been studied in a crossover study with 10 healthy 
volunteers. Five different beverages with different flavanone concentrations 
were evaluated. Commercial orange juices (29.2-70.3 mg of flavanones/100 mL) 
were compared with experimental orange beverages in which the flavanone 
concentration was enhanced (110.2 mg/100 mL). Hesperetin and naringenin 
glucuronides and sulfates were detected and quantified in plasma and urine. The 
study shows that the solubility of the flavanones, and particularly that of 
hesperidin, in the juice is a key factor for the bioavailability as flavanone 
excretion and the C(max) in plasma correlate well with the soluble flavanone 
concentration in the juice, whereas it has no correlation with the total 
flavanone intake. In addition, a large interindividual variation was observed, 
this being consistent for each individual after the intake of the different 
beverages, suggesting that flavanone bioavailability is also dependent on the 
occurrence of specific microbiota that is able to remove the rutinosides from 
the juice glycosides, which results in aglycones that are then absorbed from the 
gut.

The effect of storage on the total polyphenol content and individual phenolic 
compounds as well as on the hydrophilic antioxidant capacity of ketchups and 
tomato juices was studied. The total polyphenol content was determined using the 
Folin-Ciocalteu assay, and the antioxidant capacity of the hydrophilic fraction 
was determined using DPPH and ABTS(+) assays. Individual polyphenols were 
identified and quantified using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization 
tandem mass spectrometry on a triple quadrupole. All analyses were carried out 
for ketchups and tomato juices after storage for 3, 6, and 9 months. The total 
polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity of the hydrophilic fraction 
decreased during storage of ketchups and tomato juices. Ketchups, in general, 
showed a slightly greater stability during storage than tomato juices. The most 
significant decrease was observed for quercetin followed by caffeic and ferulic 
acids, whereas glycosilated polyphenols showed greater stability during storage.

Tomatoes and tomato-based products are rich in antioxidants such as carotenoids, 
vitamin C and polyphenols. The industrial processing of diced tomatoes involves 
heat treatments in which these antioxidant compounds may be potentially 
affected. In this study, we evaluate the effect of each separate step in the 
dice-making process. Three technological processes were investigated: Hot, Cold 
and Cold treated with calcium salt (CaCl2). Four stages were monitored in each 
process: (1) fresh tomatoes; (2) peeled tomatoes; (3) diced tomatoes; and (4) 
final product after sauce addition. The main tool for minimising or 
counteracting the eventual processing damage was the strategy of 
'reconstitution', achieved by adding a sauce rich in seeds and peels with high 
levels of antioxidants and phenolics to the diced tomatoes. Different analyses 
were carried out in order to evaluate the effect of each processing step. First, 
total polyphenols (TP) were evaluated using Folin-Ciocalteau (F-C) assay and 
antioxidant activity using ABTS(+) and DPPH assays. Flavonols, flavanones, 
hydroxycinnamic and phenolic acids were then quantified using liquid 
chromatography/electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry 
(HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). The combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that each processing step induces 
alterations in the antioxidant and phenolic profile, and in particular sauce 
addition and calcium treatment significantly affected the levels of antioxidants 
and phenolics during the dice-making process.

Information on phyto-oestrogen intake in various populations has been scanty 
until now, primarily because data on the content of these compounds in foods 
were lacking. We report here on expansion of the Finnish National Food 
Composition Database (Fineli) with values for the plant lignans matairesinol and 
secoisolariciresinol and the isoflavones daidzein and genistein. The values, 
expressed as aglycones, were based on food analyses (mainly GC-MS) or imputed 
from analytical data for 180 foods for lignans and 160 foods for isoflavones; 
additionally, over 1000 values were derived from the recipe database of Fineli. 
Average intake of these phyto-oestrogens was calculated using food consumption 
data of the National Dietary Survey FINDIET 1997, which was carried out in a 
random sample of the adult population in five areas in Finland. The dietary data 
were collected by 24 h recall =2862). The mean lignan intake was 434 (standard 
deviation (SD) 1575) microg/d and the mean isoflavone intake was 788 (SD 673) 
microg/d. Women had a higher lignan density (microg lignans/MJ) in their diet 
than men (P<0.05). Men had a higher mean daily isoflavone intake, 902 (SD 368) 
microg, than women, 668 (SD 963) microg (P<0.05). The sources of lignans were 
many: seeds, cereals, fruit, berries and vegetables. The main sources of 
isoflavones appeared to be processed meat products/sausages containing soya as 
an ingredient, and legumes as such. The average intake of lignans and 
isoflavones in Finland seems to be low, but intake varies throughout the 
population.

Consumers' increasing interest in the relationship between diet and health is a 
sign for food producers to pay more attention to potential health-protecting 
compounds in new product development and food processing. From a production 
chain perspective the choice of the raw material that is used is important for 
the health-protecting potential of the end product. Four apple cultivars 
(Jonagold, Golden Delicious, Cox's Orange, and Elstar), which can be used as 
fresh apples or in processed apple products, were compared with regard to 
flavonol, catechins, phloridzin, and chlorogenic acid concentrations and 
antioxidant activity. Jonagold apples possessed the highest flavonoid 
concentration and the highest antioxidant activity. To study seasonal 
differences, apples from three different harvest years were analyzed, but in 
three cultivars no effect on flavonoid concentration and antioxidant activity 
was observed. Long-term storage, both at refrigerator temperature and under 
controlled atmosphere conditions, was found not to influence flavonoid 
concentration or antioxidant activity.

The suitability of a simple and rapid isocratic RP-HPLC method with amperometric 
electrochemical detection for the simultaneous detection and quantification of 
hydroxycinnamic acids and their corresponding aroma-active volatile phenols in

Chestnut (Castanea sativa) is an important basic food in rural diets and a major 
starch crop used in a similar way to potatoes. Chestnuts are a fundamental 
economic resource in the ""chestnut regions"" not only for the fruit but also for 
the chestnut wood. Chestnuts have become increasingly important with respect to 
human health, for example, as an alternative gluten-free flour source. Chestnuts 
are also a rich source of other beneficial compounds, but there have been few 
studies on the composition during processing. In this study, we analyzed the 
chemical composition of three Portuguese cultivars at different stages of 
industrial processing. The chestnut cultivars were Longal, Judia, and Martaínha. 
All three cultivars had high moisture contents but were low in ash, crude fat, 
and crude protein contents, with high starch and low fiber contents. The free 
amino acid contents, including various essential amino acids, varied depending 
on the cultivar. All three cultivars also had a significant content of 
polyphenolics with gallic acid; ellagic acid was predominant among hydrolyzable 
and condensed tannins. Many of these compounds are known to exert significant 
positive effects on human health. The one-way analysis of variance for fresh 
chestnut shows significant differences among the three cultivars for most of the 
studied parameters. The same statistical analysis applied to each one of the two 
cultivars (Judia and Longal) sampled for the four processing steps analyzed 
indicates a significant effect of this factor in practically all of the 
constituents. On the other hand, the two-way analysis of variance shows that, 
besides the residual, the processing step and the interaction cultivar x 
processing step were the factors that more contributed for the total variation 
observed in the constituents analyzed, while the contribution of cultivar was 
much less significant.

Tallahassee, Florida 32306-1493, USA.

Commercially important edible nut seeds were analyzed for chemical composition 
and moisture sorption. Moisture (1.47-9.51%), protein (7.50-21.56%), lipid 
(42.88-66.71%), ash (1.16-3.28%), total soluble sugars (0.55-3.96%), tannins 
(0.01-0.88%), and phytate (0.15-0.35%) contents varied considerably. Regardless 
of the seed type, lipids were mainly composed of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty 
acids (>75% of the total lipids). Fatty acid composition analysis indicated that 
oleic acid (C18:1) was the main constituent of monounsaturated lipids in all 
seed samples. With the exception of macadamia, linoleic acid (C18:2) was the 
major polyunsaturated fatty acid. In the case of walnuts, in addition to 
linoleic acid (59.79%) linolenic acid (C18:3) also significantly contributed 
toward the total polyunsaturated lipids. Amino acid composition analyses 
indicated lysine (Brazil nut, cashew nut, hazelnut, pine nut, and walnut), 
sulfur amino acids methionine and cysteine (almond), tryptophan (macadamia, 
pecan), and threonine (peanut) to be the first limiting amino acid as compared 
to human (2-5 year old) amino acid requirements. The amino acid composition of 
the seeds was characterized by the dominance of hydrophobic (range = 
37.16-44.54%) and acidic (27.95-33.17%) amino acids followed by basic 
(16.16-21.17%) and hydrophilic (8.48-11.74%) amino acids. Trypsin inhibitory 
activity, hemagglutinating activity, and proteolytic activity were not detected 
in the nut seed samples analyzed. Sorption isotherms (Aw range = 0.08-0.97) 
indicated a narrow range for monolayer water content (11-29 mg/g of dry matter). 
No visible mold growth was evident on any of the samples stored at Aw < 0.53 and 
25 degrees C for 6 months.

Biofortification of staple crops is a promising, sustainable strategy to combat 
micronutrient deficiencies including iron (Fe). This study evaluated the impact 
of boiling (BLF) and fermentation (FLF) on Fe and other minerals content in 
Fe-biofortified lentil flours and analytical approaches for Fe and phytic acid 
quantification. Both treatments significantly reduced tannin, saponin, oxalate, 
and phytic acid contents. FLF presented higher content of most minerals 
including Fe (66.5 mg/kg) than BLF (61.6 mg/kg). A weak correlation (r = 0.43) 
was found between phosphovanadomolybdate and total phosphorus assay kit methods, 
whereas ICP-OES showed strong correlation (r = 0.95) with the 
hexathiocyanatoferrate technique for phytic acid and Fe contents determination, 
respectively. PCA explained 92.6 % of variation in the mineral content across 
flours. SEM-EDS provided insights into processing-induced microstructural 
alterations and confirmed ICP-OES elemental composition. Overall, processing 
appears to be an effective strategy to reduce antinutritional factors and 
increase the content of some minerals.

Olive oil phenolic compounds are potent antioxidants in vitro, but evidence for 
antioxidant action in vivo is controversial. We examined the role of the 
phenolic compounds from olive oil on postprandial oxidative stress and LDL 
antioxidant content. Oral fat loads of 40 mL of similar olive oils, but with 
high (366 mg/kg), moderate (164 mg/kg), and low (2.7 mg/kg) phenolic content, 
were administered to 12 healthy male volunteers in a cross-over study design 
after a washout period in which a strict antioxidant diet was followed. Tyrosol 
and hydroxytyrosol, phenolic compounds of olive oil, were dose-dependently 
absorbed (p<0.001). Total phenolic compounds in LDL increased at postprandial 
state in a direct relationship with the phenolic compounds content of the olive 
oil ingested (p<0.05). Plasma concentrations of tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, and 
3-O-methyl-hydroxytyrosol directly correlated with changes in the total phenolic 
compounds content of the LDL after the high phenolic compounds content olive oil 
ingestion. A 40 mL dose of olive oil promoted a postprandial oxidative stress, 
the degree of LDL oxidation being lower as the phenolic content of the olive oil 
administered increases. In conclusion, olive oil phenolic content seems to 
modulate the LDL phenolic content and the postprandial oxidative stress promoted 
by 40 mL olive oil ingestion in humans.

Hydroxytyrosol is the most potent phenolic antioxidant of olive oil and olive 
mill waste water (OMWW) and its biological activities have stimulated research 
on its potential role in cardiovascular protection. However, evidence of the 
absorption of OMWW phenolics and on their possible in vivo activity has, until 
now, never been provided. Three groups male Sprague-Dawley rats were 
administered 1, 5, or 10 mg/Kg of the OMWW extract, respectively, providing 
41.4, 207, and 414 microg/Kg of hydroxytyrosol, respectively. Urine was 
collected for 24 h and the urinary levels of hydroxytyrosol were quantified by 
mass spectrometry. Hydroxytyrosol was dose-dependently (R(2) = 0.95) absorbed 
and excreted in the urines mostly as a glucuronide conjugate. Further, the 
administration of an hydroxytyrosol-rich OMWW extract (10 mg/kg) to the rats was 
also associated with an increase of their plasma antioxidant capacity. Future 
experiments will eventually further clarify its metabolic fate and its in vivo 
actions.

Interest in the in vivo biological activities of olive oil phenolics is rapidly 
growing, and different models and vehicles of administration are used worldwide. 
Matters of practicality determine the use of rats rather than humans as the 
model of choice. Also, growing interest in nutraceuticals is leading to the 
formulation of compounds containing olive oil phenols. In this study, we 
compared metabolism and urinary excretion of hydroxytyrosol [(HT), the most 
representative phenol of olive oil] between rats and humans by evaluating 
excretion of HT and its major metabolite, homovanillyl alcohol. Also, we 
compared human excretion of HT when consumed as a natural component of extra 
virgin olive oil, when added to refined olive oil, or when added to yogurt (as 
an approximation of functional food). Urinary excretion of HT was greater in 
humans than in rats, a species with a high basal excretion of HT and its 
metabolites. The high (234% of HT administered) excretion of free HT suggests 
that hydrolysis of oleuropein administered in humans (still an unresolved issue) 
occurs in vivo. Moreover, human HT excretion was much higher after its 
administration as a natural component of olive oil (44.2% of HT administered) 
than after its addition to refined olive oil (23% of HT administered) or yogurt 
(5.8% of dose or approximately 13% of that recorded after virgin olive oil 
intake). These data suggest that the rat is not the appropriate model for the 
study of HT metabolism and that HT-containing functional foods should be 
carefully formulated.

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and red wine (RW) are two basic elements that form 
part of the so-called Mediterranean diet. Both stand out because of their high 
phenolic compound content and their potential related health benefits. The 
present study is focused on the metabolic disposition of resveratrol (RESV), 
tyrosol (TYR), and hydroxytyrosol (HT) following the consumption of EVOO, RW, 
and a combination of both. In this study, 12 healthy volunteers consumed a 
single dose of 25 mL of EVOO, 150 mL of RW, and a combination of both in a 
crossover randomized clinical trial. Urinary recovery of RESV, TYR, and HT was 
analysed in urine samples collected over a 6-h period following the intake of 
each treatment. Higher HT levels were observed following EVOO compared to RW 
(3788 ± 1751 nmols and 2308 ± 847 nmols respectively). After the combination of 
EVOO and RW, the recovery of TYR and HT metabolites increased statistically 
compared to their separate consumption (4925 ± 1751 nmols of TYR and 6286 ± 3198 
nmols of HT). EVOO triggered an increase in glucuronide conjugates, while RW 
intake raised sulfate metabolites. Marginal effects were observed in RESV 
increased bioavailability after the combination of RW with the fat matrix 
provided by EVOO.

Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and 
development of atherosclerosis. Stilbenes have been shown to protect 
lipoproteins from oxidative damage and to have cancer chemopreventive activity. 
We describe a method for the direct determination of stilbenes in several red 
wines using high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. In a 
survey of 12 commercial wines from the south of Brazil (Rio Grande del Sul), 
levels of delta-viniferin are reported for the first time in different varieties 
of red wines. Brazilian red wine contains trans-astringin, trans-piceid, 
trans-resveratrol, cis-resveratrol (in high quantity: 5 times more than the 
trans form), epsilon-viniferin, and a compound isolated for the first time in 
wine, trans-delta-viniferin. Isolation and identification of delta-viniferin was 
achieved by NMR after extraction and fractionation of red wine phenolics. 
delta-Viniferin contributes, as well as cis-resveratrol and trans-piceid, to a 
significant proportion of stilbenes in wine dietary intake, particularly with 
Merlot varieties containing an average level of 10 mg/L for delta-viniferin, 15 
mg/L for cis-resveratrol, and 13 mg/L for trans-piceid. The total stilbene 
intake from wine origin was estimated for the Brazilian population as 5.3 mg/day 
per person (on the basis of a regular wine consumption of 160 mL/day). 
delta-Viniferin can contribute to around 20% of total stilbenes in wine (average 
of 6.4 mg/L in red Brazilian wines). It would be important in the future to 
investigate the origins of the differences in wine stilbene levels in relation 
to the vine varieties, and the bioavailability of the newly extracted stilbene 
delta-viniferin in plasma after consumption of different types of wines.

Apples are a rich source of polyphenols in the human diet. However, the 
distribution of polyphenols in different apple varieties and tissues is still 
largely unclear. In this study, a new liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) strategy was developed to reveal the spatial 
distribution of polyphenols in different apple tissues and varieties. A method 
based on multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-enhanced product ion (EPI) was 
established in the information-dependent acquisition (IDA) mode for 
pseudo-target screening of major apple polyphenols. A total of 39 apple 
polyphenolic metabolites were finally identified. Qualitative and quantitative 
results showed that the variety and content of polyphenols in apple peels were 
higher than those of other tissues. In apple roots, stems, and leaves, the 
highest polyphenol variety and content were found in wild species, followed by 
cultivars and elite varieties. Dihydrochalcone substances, one kind of major 
apple polyphenols, were more abundant in apple roots, stems, and leaves. This 
strategy can be applied as a model for other agricultural products, in addition 
to revealing the distribution of polyphenols in different tissues of apples, 
which provides a theoretical basis for the utilization of polyphenol resources 
and variety selection.

The amounts of myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol were analyzed in 16 red and 
2 white berry and grape wines after acid hydrolysis using an RP-HPLC method with 
diode array detection. The red berry wines analyzed were made mainly from black 
currant, crowberry, and bog whortleberry, i.e., berries rich in flavonols. The 
red grape wines were made mainly from Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot grapes in 
several countries. The white wines studied were gooseberry and white currant 
wines and Chardonnay and Riesling wines. The amount of myricetin ranged from 3.8 
to 22.6 mg L(-1) in red berry wines and from 0 to 14.6 mg L(-1) in red grape 
wines. The amount of quercetin was from 2.2 to 24.3 mg L(-1) red berry wines and 
from <1.2 to 19.4 mg L(-1) in red grape wines. Low levels of kaempferol were 
found in all red berry wines and in 9 red grape wines. The total concentration 
of these flavonols was from 6 to 46 mg L(-1) (mean 20 mg L(-1)) in red berry 
wines and from 4 to 31 mg L(-1) (mean 15 mg L(-1)) in red grape wines. Small 
amounts of quercetin were found in white currant and gooseberry wines, whereas 
no flavonols were detected in white grape wines. These results demonstrate that

Brassica vegetables are widely consumed mostly after processing and cooking. 
These processing and cooking methods not only can affect the taste, texture, 
flavor and nutrients of these vegetables, but also influence the levels of some 
important bioactive compounds, such as glucosinolates (GLSs). Glucoraphanin 
(GLR) is the most abundant GLSs and its hydrolyzed component, sulforaphane 
(SLR), is the most powerful anti-cancer compound in brassica vegetables. In this 
review, we find out that varied treatments impact the retention of GLR and the 
formation of SLR differently. Be specific, 1) freezing can avoid the losses of 
GLR while short-time microwaving, short-time steaming and fermentation promote 
the biotransformation from GLR to SLR; 2) Boiling and blanching cause the 
largest losses of GLR and SLR, while freezing significantly protect their 
losses.; 3) Stir-frying varies the levels of GLR and SLR in different cooking 
conditions.

Five types of caneberries [evergreen blackberries (Rubus laciniatus), 
marionberries (Rubus ursinus), boysenberries (Rubus ursinus x idaeus), red 
raspberries (Rubus idaeus), and black raspberries (Rubus occidentalis)] were 
analyzed for antioxidant activity by measuring their oxygen radical absorbance 
capacity (ORAC). In addition, the berries were analyzed for total phenolics, 
anthocyanins, procyanidins, and ellagic acid content. All of the berries had 
high ORAC activity ranging from 24 to 77.2 micromol of Trolox equiv/g of fresh 
berries. Anthocyanin content ranged from 0.65 to 5.89 mg/g, and phenolics ranged 
from 4.95 to 9.8 mg/g. Black raspberries had the highest ORAC and anthocyanin 
and phenolic contents. Only red raspberries had detectable amounts of 
procyanidin oligomers (monomer, dimers, and trimers). All berries had high 
levels of ellagic acid (47-90 mg/g), but boysenberries had the highest level 
prior to hydrolysis. The results from this study indicate that these caneberries 
were high in antioxidant activity and were rich sources of anthocyanins and 
phenolics.

Resveratrol provides multiple physiologic benefits which promote healthspan in 
various model species and clinical trials support continued exploration of 
resveratrol treatment in humans. However, there remains concern regarding low 
bioavailability and wide inter-individual differences in absorption and 
metabolism in humans, which suggests a great need to develop novel methods for 
resveratrol delivery. We hypothesized that oral transmucosal delivery, using a 
lozenge composed of a resveratrol-excipient matrix, would allow resveratrol to 
be absorbed rapidly into the bloodstream. We pursued proof of concept through 
two experiments. In the first experiment, the solubility of trans-resveratrol 
(tRES) in water and 2.0 M solutions of dextrose, fructose, ribose, sucrose, and 
xylitol was determined using HPLC. Independent t-tests with a Bonferroni 
correction were used to compare the solubility of tRES in each of the solutions 
to that in water. tRES was significantly more soluble in the ribose solution 
(p = 0.0013) than in the other four solutions. Given the enhanced solubility of 
tRES in a ribose solution, a resveratrol-ribose matrix was developed into a 
lozenge suitable for human consumption. Lozenges were prepared, each containing 
146±5.5 mg tRES per 2000 mg of lozenge mass. Two healthy human participants 
consumed one of the prepared lozenges following an overnight fast. Venipuncture 
was performed immediately before and 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes following 
lozenge administration. Maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) for tRES alone 
(i.e., resveratrol metabolites not included) were 325 and 332 ng⋅mL(-1) for the 
two participants at 15 minute post-administration for both individuals. These 
results suggest a resveratrol-ribose matrix lozenge can achieve greater Cmax and 
enter the bloodstream faster than previously reported dosage forms for 
gastrointestinal absorption. While this study is limited by small sample size 
and only one method of resveratrol delivery, it does provide proof of concept to 
support further exploration of novel delivery methods for resveratrol 
administration.

Dietary factors affecting polyphenol bioavailability.

Bohn T(1).

Author information:
(1)Centre de Recherche Public - Gabriel Lippmann, Environment and 
Agro-biotechnologies Department, Belvaux, Luxembourg.

While many epidemiological studies have associated the consumption of 
polyphenols within fruits and vegetables with a decreased risk of developing 
several chronic diseases, intervention studies have generally not confirmed 
these beneficial effects. The reasons for this discrepancy are not fully 
understood but include potential differences in dosing, interaction with the 
food matrix, and differences in polyphenol bioavailability. In addition to 
endogenous factors such as microbiota and digestive enzymes, the food matrix can 
also considerably affect bioaccessibility, uptake, and further metabolism of 
polyphenols. While dietary fiber (such as hemicellulose), divalent minerals, and 
viscous and protein-rich meals are likely to cause detrimental effects on 
polyphenol bioaccessibility, digestible carbohydrates, dietary lipids 
(especially for hydrophobic polyphenols, e.g., curcumin), and additional 
antioxidants may enhance polyphenol availability. Following epithelial uptake, 
polyphenols such as flavonoids may reduce phase II metabolism and excretion, 
enhancing polyphenol bioavailability. Furthermore, polyphenols may act 
synergistically due to their influence on efflux transporters such as 
p-glycoprotein. In order to understand polyphenol bioactivity, increased 
knowledge of the factors affecting polyphenol bioavailability, including dietary 
factors, is paramount.

Fruits and leaves from different cultivars of thornless blackberry (Rubus sp.), 
red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.), black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis L.), and 
strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa D.) plants were analyzed for total antioxidant 
capacity (oxygen radical absorbance capacity, ORAC) and total phenolic content. 
In addition, fruits were analyzed for total anthocyanin content. Blackberries 
and strawberries had the highest ORAC values during the green stages, whereas 
red raspberries had the highest ORAC activity at the ripe stage. Total 
anthocyanin content increased with maturity for all three species of fruits. 
Compared with fruits, leaves were found to have higher ORAC values. In fruits, 
ORAC values ranged from 7.8 to 33.7 micromol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g of 
fresh berries (35. 0-162.1 micromol of TE/g of dry matter), whereas in leaves, 
ORAC values ranged from 69.7 to 182.2 micromol of TE/g of fresh leaves 
(205.0-728.8 micromol of TE/g of dry matter). As the leaves become older, the 
ORAC values and total phenolic contents decreased. The results showed a linear 
correlation between total phenolic content and ORAC activity for fruits and 
leaves. For ripe berries, a linear relationship existed between ORAC values and 
anthocyanin content. Of the ripe fruits tested, on the basis of wet weight of 
fruit, cv. Jewel black raspberry and blackberries may be the richest source for 
antioxidants. On the basis of the dry weight of fruit, strawberries had the 
highest ORAC activity followed by black raspberries (cv. Jewel), blackberries, 
and red raspberries.

Tea is a popular beverage almost all over the world. Many studies show that tea 
consumption is closely associated with positive health impact. Most of the HPLC 
methods used for the determination of tea constituents include gradient elution 
systems which involve expensive instrumentation. The objective of this study was 
to develop a simple, rapid precise and low cost HPLC method for the separation 
and quantification of catechins and caffeine in tea (Camellia sinensis). The 
method utilizes a phenyl column (2.1 × 150 mm) with a UV-detector (280 nm) where 
excellent chromatographic separation of tea components i.e. gallic acid (GA), 
caffeine (Caf), epicatechin (EC) and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was 
achieved. The isocratic elution system of acetonitrile, glacial acetic acid and 
deionized water (8:1:91 v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min was involved. This 
method produced excellent accuracy and precision. Within run and between run 
precision was less than 7.5 %. The equations for calibration curves were 
y = 0.117 (±0.010)x + 0.173 (±0.024), y = 0.100 (±0.003)x + 0.045 (±0.019), 
y = 0.016 (±0.001)x + 0.006 (±0.004), y = 0.025 (±0.001)x-0.025 (±0.007) for GA, 
Caf, EC and EGCG respectively. The method validation parameters prove that the 
method is efficient, a simple and adequate for the quantitative determination of 
principal components in tea samples.

Water scarcity is an ecological issue affecting over 10% of Europe. It is 
intensified by rising temperatures, leading to greater evaporation and reduced 
precipitation. Agriculture has been confirmed as the sector accounting for the 
highest water consumption globally, and it faces significant challenges relating 
to drought, impacting crop yields and food security. Sustainable practices, 
precision irrigation, and the development of drought-resistant crops are 
essential for the mitigation of this threat. Effective, innovative solutions are 
crucial for optimizing water use for intensive crops such as cultivated 
strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa). This study emphasizes the importance of 
identifying the genotypes most resilient to low water availability. Experimental 
trials involving reduced irrigation levels were set up to identify genotypes 
with a greater capacity to increase fruit quality and maintain fruit yield. 
Reduced water conditions positively influenced strawberry fruit quality, 
exhibiting improved citric acid, soluble solids, and color brightness linked to 
decreased water use, while firmness remained stable. Notably, the total phenolic 
content was most affected by stress, indicating strong antioxidant responses. 
With these interesting variations in fruit quality came a different response in 
plant yield. Plants belonging to the Lauretta and AN15,07,53 cultivars 
maintained a 98% fruit yield when grown under WS1 conditions. While the yield 
for the Francesca cultivar increased by 10% under the stressed WS1 conditions in 
comparison to the control conditions, water stress in the WS2 treatment caused a 
strong reduction in yield in all three genotypes. Overall, the findings 
emphasize the importance of identifying for each new cultivar the most 
appropriate water regime in order to amplify the quality of the fruit, thus 
maintaining high production standards and saving water.

Cultural system [hill plasticulture (HC) versus matted row (MR)] and genotype 
interactions affected strawberry fruit quality. In general, fruit soluble solids 
content, total sugar, fructose, glucose, ascorbic acid, titratable acid, and 
citric acid contents were increased in the HC system. Fruit from HC also had 
higher flavonoid contents and antioxidant capacities. Strawberry fruit contains 
flavonols as well as other phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins and phenolic 
acids. Pelargonidin-based anthocyanins such as pelargonidin 3-glucoside, 
pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside-succinate were the 
predominant anthocyanins in strawberry fruit. The content of cyanidin-based 
anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, was much 
lower than that of pelargonidin-based anthocyanins in either system. Strawberry 
fruit from the HC system had significantly higher amounts of p-coumaroylglucose, 
dihydroflavonol, quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin 3-glucuronide, kaempferol 
3-glucoside, kaempferol 3-glucuronide, cyanidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 
3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, and 
pelargonidin 3-glucoside-succinate. Fruits from plants grown in the MR system 
generally had the lowest contents of phenolic acids, flavonols, and 
anthocyanins. Strawberry fruit grown under HC conditions had significantly 
higher peroxyl radicals (ROO*) absorbance capacity (ORAC).

To identify the major metabolites of resveratrol in rat, rat urine samples were 
pretreated by using solid-phase extraction technique (SPE) with polyamide 
cartridges. And a LC-MS/MS method with electrospray ionisation (ESI), negative 
ion mode and collision induced dissociation (CID), was used to elucidate the 
structures of the major metabolites of resveratrol. According to the results of 
our experiment, we found that the main metabolites of resveratrol were 
resveratrol monoglucuronide (M1), dihydroresveratrol monosulfate (M2), 
resveratrol monosulfate (M3) and dihydroresveratrol (M4).

PURPOSE: Polygonum cuspidatum extract as a traditional Chinese medicine is 
extracted from the dried rhizome and root of Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb.et Zucc. 
Resveratrol is one of its active components. Studies were performed in rats to 
define the tissue distribution and excretion of resveratrol in urine and bile, 
and to characterize (if possible) any metabolites of resveratrol observed in 
tissues after ig 20mg/kg Polygonum cuspidatum extract.
METHOD: For tissue distribution studies, tissues (300 mg) were homogenized and 
centrifuged with methanol, and metabolites found in selected tissue extract were 
identified by LC/MS/MS. For urinary and biliary excretion experiments, urine and 
bile samples were cleaned up by using solid-phase extraction (SPE) with 
polyamide cartridges. All the concentrations of resveratrol in these biological 
samples were determined by HPLC with UV detection.
RESULT: After a single oral dose of 20mg/kg PCE in rats, resveratrol was mainly 
distributed in stomach, duodenum, liver and kidney with detectable metabolites 
resveratrol monoglucuronide and resveratrol monosulfate. The majority of the 
resveratrol was excreted as metabolites, only 0.59% and 0.027% of the dosage 
were excreted in urine and bile respectively as unchanged drug within 24h.

A sensitive ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method has 
been developed and validated for the quantification of taxifolin in rat plasma. 
Following liquid/liquid extraction by ethyl acetate, the analytes were separated 
on a Sunfire (2.1 mm x 50 mm, 3.5 microm) column and analyzed in the selected 
ion recording with a negative electrospray ionization mode. The method was 
linear over the concentration range of 6-6750 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-day 
precisions were all within 8% and accuracy ranged from 92.9% to 105.1%. The 
lower limit of quantification was 6 ng/mL. The present method was successfully 
applied to the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin 
following intravenous and oral administration to rats. The absolute 
bioavailability of taxifolin was 0.17% in rat.

To take advantage of the various pharmacologic activities of soy bean 
isoflavones, more detailed studies of the absorption and excretion rates of 
these compounds in humans and subsequent evaluation of their bioavailabilities 
are required. We conducted a pharmacokinetic study of soybean isoflavones in 
seven healthy male volunteers. After ingestion of 60 g of kinako (baked soybean 
powder, containing 103 micromol daidzein and 112 micromol genistein), changes of 
the isoflavone and metabolite concentrations in plasma, urine and feces were 
measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The plasma concentration of 
genistein increased after 2 h and reached its highest value of 2.44 +/- 0.65 
micromol/L 6 h later. The plasma concentration of daidzein peaked at 1.56 +/- 
0.34 micromol/L at the same time, but it was always lower than that of 
genistein. Peak plasma concentration of O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) and equol 
appeared after the daidzein peak in four and two subjects, respectively. In 
contrast with plasma, daidzein was the main component in urine. Urinary daidzein 
excretion started to increase shortly after the rise in its plasma concentration 
and reached 2.4 micromol/h 8 h after ingestion of kinako. Genistein excretion in 
urine paralleled that of daidzein, but the value at 6 h was about half (1.1 
micromol/h). The majority of ingested isoflavones after ingestion of kinako were 
recovered on d 2 or 3 in the feces. Total recovery of daidzein, O-DMA and equol 
from urine and feces was 54.7%, calculated from daidzein intake; 20.1% of 
administered genistein was recovered as genistein. The half-lives of plasma 
genistein and daidzein were 8.36 and 5.79 h, respectively. The individual plasma 
and urinary concentrations of equol and O-DMA were quite variable; subjects were 
classified as high and low metabolizers. The high plasma concentration of 
isoflavones for at least several hours after a single ingestion of soy protein 
suggests that these compounds may interact with macromolecules and have 
biological effects.

Taiwan, Republic of China.

The antioxidant activity of roasted coffee residues was evaluated. Extraction 
with four solvents (water, methanol, ethanol, and n-hexane) showed that water 
extracts of roasted coffee residues (WERCR) produced higher yields and gave 
better protection for lipid peroxidation. WERCR showed a remarkable protective 
effect on oxidative damage of protein. In addition, WERCR showed scavenging of 
free radicals as well as the reducing ability and to bind ferrous ions, 
indicating that WERCR acts as both primary and secondary antioxidants. The HPLC 
analyses showed that phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid) and 
nonphenolic compounds [caffeine, trigonelline, nicotinic acid, and 
5-(hydroxymethyl)furfuraldehyde] remained in roasted coffee residues. These 
compounds showed a protective effect on a liposome model system. The 
concentrations of flavonoids and polyphenolic compounds in roasted coffee 
residues were 8,400 and 20,400 ppm, respectively. In addition, the Maillard 
reaction products (MRPs) remaining in roasted coffee residues were believed to 
show antioxidant activity. These data indicate that roasted coffee residues have 
excellent potential for use as a natural antioxidant source because the 
antioxidant compounds remained in roasted coffee residues.

The consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains rich in antioxidative 
phytochemicals is associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as 
cancer, coronary heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, cataract, and 
aged-related functional decline. For example, phenolic acids are among the main 
antioxidative phytochemicals in grains that have been shown to be beneficial to 
human health. Corn (Zea mays L.) is a major staple food in several parts of the 
world; thus, the antioxidant activity of several corn types was evaluated. The 
2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl free radical (DPPH*) scavenging activity, total 
phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant capacity of lipid-soluble substances (ACL), 
oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and phenolic acid compositions of 
typical and mutant genotypes (typical-1, waxy, typical-2, and high-amylose) were 
investigated. The DPPH* scavenging activity at 60 min was 34.39-44.51% in 
methanol extracts and 60.41-67.26% in HCl/methanol (1/99, v/v) extracts of corn. 
The DPPH* scavenging activity of alkaline hydrolysates of corn ranged from 48.63 
to 64.85%. The TPC ranged from 0.67 to 1.02 g and from 0.91 to 2.15 g of ferulic 
acid equiv/kg of corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. The 
TPC of alkaline hydrolysates ranged from 2.74 to 6.27 g of ferulic acid equiv/kg 
of corn. The ACL values were 0.41-0.80 and 0.84-1.59 g of Trolox equiv/kg of 
corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. The ORAC values were 
10.57-12.47 and 18.76-24.92 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn in methanol and 
HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. ORAC values of alkaline hydrolysates ranged 
from 42.85 to 68.31 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn. The composition of phenolic 
acids in alkaline hydrolysates of corn was p-hydroxybenzoic acid (5.08-10.6 
mg/kg), vanillic acid (3.25-14.71 mg/kg), caffeic acid (2.32-25.73 mg/kg), 
syringic acid (12.37-24.48 mg/kg), p-coumaric acid (97.87-211.03 mg/kg), ferulic 
acid (1552.48-2969.10 mg/kg), and o-coumaric acid (126.53-575.87 mg/kg). Levels 
of DPPH* scavenging activity, TPC, ACL, and ORAC in HCl/methanol extracts were 
obviously higher than those present in methanol extracts. There was no 
significant loss of antioxidant capacity when corn was dried at relatively high 
temperatures (65 and 93 degrees C) postharvest as compared to drying at ambient 
temperatures (27 degrees C). Alkaline hydrolysates showed very high TPC, ACL, 
and ORAC values when compared to methanol and HCl/methanol extracts. 
High-amylose corn had a better antioxidant capacity than did typical (nonmutant) 
corn genotypes.

Crude extracts of evening primrose meal were prepared in 56% (v/v) acetone and 
separated into six fractions (I-VI) using a Sephadex LH-20 column. Qualitative 
tests for phenolic and vanillin positive compounds produced positive results for 
all fractions. Silica gel thin-layer chromatography of fractions III and V 
allowed the location and isolation of two spots containing moderate to strong 
antioxidative compounds. High-performance liquid chromatography of the spot 
isolated from fraction III showed the resolution of two structurally related 
compounds, whereas that of the spot from fraction V showed the presence of one 
compound. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electron impact mass 
spectrometry produced sufficient evidence to identify the isolated compounds as 
(+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and gallic acid. These compounds accounted for 
about 10.5 and 1.7% of the dry mass of the crude extracts and meal, 
respectively.

The lipophilic character of quercetin suggests that it can cross enterocyte 
membranes via simple diffusion. Therefore, it should be more bioavailable than 
its glucosides, which require preliminary hydrolysis or active transport for 
absorption. However, the published human studies show that quercetin is less 
bioavailable than its glucosides. Assuming that low bioavailability of quercetin 
aglycone provided to humans as a pure substance is the result of its low 
solubility in the digestive tract, we studied its bioavailability from dietary 
sources in which quercetin was dispersed in the food matrix. In a randomized 
crossover study, 9 volunteers took a single dose of either shallot flesh (99.2% 
quercetin glucosides and 0.8% quercetin aglycone) or dry shallot skin (83.3% 
quercetin aglycone and 16.7% quercetin glucosides), providing 1.4 mg quercetin 
per kg of body weight. Blood samples were collected before and after consumption 
of shallot preparations. Plasma quercetin was measured on HPLC with 
electrochemical detection after plasma enzymatic treatment. The maximum plasma 
quercetin concentration of 1.02 +/- 0.13 micromol/L was reached at 2.33 +/- 0.50 
h after shallot flesh consumption compared with 3.95 +/- 0.62 micromol/L at 2.78 
+/- 0.15 h after dry skin consumption. The area under the concentration-time 
curve after dry skin consumption was 47.23 +/- 7.53 micromol x h(-1) x L(-1) and 
was significantly higher than that after shallot flesh intake (22.23 +/- 2.32 
micromol x h(-1) x L(-1)). When provided along with dietary sources, quercetin 
aglycone is more bioavailable than its glucosides in humans. Results point to 
the food matrix as a key factor.

The isoflavone aglycon and glucoconjugate content of commercially prepared and 
""home-prepared"" high- and low-soy foods selected for use in an on-going 
nutritional study were measured by LC-MS. The daidzin, daidzein, 
6""-O-malonyldaidzin, 6""-O-acetyldaidzin, genistein, genistin, 
6""-O-malonylgenistin, 6""-O-acetylgenistin, glycitin, glycitein, 
6""-O-malonylglycitin, and 6""-O-acetylglycitin content are expressed in terms of 
individual isoflavones, total isoflavone equivalents, and milligrams of 
isoflavones per portion served. Soybeans (774 mg x kg(-1) total isoflavones) and 
soybean-containing foods had the highest isoflavone content of the foods 
examined. The low-soy foods all contained very low concentrations (<8 mg x 
kg(-1) total isoflavones) of the isoflavone aglycons and glucoconjugates. High- 
and low-soy 11 day rotating menus were constructed from the analyzed foods to 
deliver 100.0 and 0.5 mg of isoflavones per day, respectively.

BACKGROUND: Little information is currently available on the role of the gut 
microflora in modulating isoflavone bioavailability or on sex differences in 
isoflavone metabolism and bioavailability.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether chronic soy consumption influences 
isoflavone bioavailability as judged by plasma isoflavone concentrations and 
modified gut microflora activities [beta-glucoside hydrolysis and equol and 
O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) production]. We also examined whether sex 
differences in isoflavone metabolism exist.
DESIGN: A randomized, parallel, controlled study design was used to compare a 
high-soy diet (104 +/- 24 mg total isoflavones/d) with a low-soy diet (0.54 +/- 
0.58 mg total isoflavones/d) in 76 healthy young adults for 10 wk.
RESULTS: Concentrations of isoflavones and their gut microflora metabolites in 
the plasma, urine, and feces were significantly higher in the subjects who 
consumed the high-soy diet than in those who consumed the low-soy diet. 
Concentrations of O-DMA in plasma and urine were higher in the men than in the 
women. Fecal bacteria from subjects consuming both diets could convert daidzein 
to equol ex vivo. Fecal beta-glucosidase activity was significantly higher in 
the subjects who consumed the high-soy diet than in those who consumed the 
low-soy diet.
CONCLUSIONS: Although interindividual variation in isoflavone metabolism was 
high, intraindividual variation was low. Only concentrations of O-DMA in plasma 
and urine appeared to be influenced by sex. Chronic soy consumption does not 
appear to induce many significant changes to the gut metabolism of isoflavones 
other than higher beta-glucosidase activity.

The environmental impact of petroleum-based food packaging has driven growing 
interest in biodegradable and functionally active alternatives. This study 
developed a novel bioactive composite film by incorporating cinnamaldehyde 
nano-emulsions (CIN-NEs) into a pullulan (PUL)/sodium carboxymethyl cellulose 
(CMC) matrix. The film's functional properties were evaluated. SEM, FTIR, and 
XRD analyses confirmed the excellent compatibility between CIN-NEs and the 
PUL/CMC matrix, with all films displaying dense and uniform microstructures. The 
composite film incorporated with 12 % CIN-NEs (PCF-12) demonstrated a remarkable 
UV-blocking capacity. Specifically, it blocked over 99 % of UV radiation in the 
UVB (280-320 nm) and UVC (200-280 nm) regions, and more than 72 % in the UVA 
(320-400 nm) range. Furthermore, compared to the control film (PCF-0), PCF-12 
exhibited improved flexibility, with the elongation at break increasing to 
82.64 %. It also demonstrated enhanced water resistance, with the water contact 
angle increasing by 22.59°, while the moisture content and water solubility 
decreased by 3.17 % and 18.73 %, respectively. Combined with the reinforced 
antibacterial and antioxidant properties, the PCF-12 effectively extended the 
shelf life of blueberries to 8 days at room temperature, highlighting its 
potential for application in food packaging.

Anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins were characterized by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS coupled 
with a diode array and/or fluorescent detector in seven cultivars of Ribes 
nigrum (black currant) and Ribes rubrum (red currant, Red Lake), six cultivars 
of Ribes grossularia (gooseberries), Aronia melanocarpa(chokeberry), and 
Sambucus nigra (elderberry). Thirty-one different anthocyanins were detected in 
these berries, but not every anthocyanin was observed in each berry. A number of 
minor anthocyanins were identified from these berries for the first time. The 
concentrations of individual anthocyanins in all of the berries were quantified 
using relevant anthocyanidin 3-glucoside standards. Among the berries studied in 
this paper and in berries in general, chokeberry has the highest total 
anthocyanin concentrations [1480 mg/100 g of fresh weight (FW)], whereas the 
lowest total anthocyanin concentration in the berries studied was found in the 
gooseberry cv. Careless, which contained only 0.07 mg/100 g of FW. Two cultivars 
of gooseberries (Marigold and Leveller) did not contain any anthocyanins. Total 
proanthocyanidin concentrations in the berries studied ranged from 23 to 664 
mg/100 g of FW in elderberry and chokeberry, respectively. Procyanidin or 
prodelphinidin polymers were the predominant components (>65% w/w) in most of 
the berries. The lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities were measured 
by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC(FL)) procedure. The total 
antioxidant capacity varied from 21 micromol of TE/g of FW in Careless 
gooseberry to 161 micromol of TE/g of FW in chokeberry. Total phenolics in the 
berries in general paralleled hydrophilic antioxidant capacity.

Weaning pigs (7.9 +/- 1.7 kg) were fed a freeze-dried powder of marionberry (MB) 
by stomach tube to study the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins. Four 
major anthocyanins (ACNs) were found in MB: cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-glc, 
78%), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (Cy-3-rutin, 20%), pelargonidin-3-glucoside 
(Pg-3-glc, 0.4%), and 1 unknown acylated cyanidin-based ACN (UACy, 1.5%). In the 
urine, the 4 original ACNs and 11 metabolites were identified and quantified. 
The main metabolites were glucuronidated and/or methylated forms of the original 
anthocyanins. Total recovery of the 4 original ACNs plus their related 
metabolites was 0.087 +/- 0.034% for Cy-3-glc, 0.084 +/- 0.026% for Cy-3-rutin, 
0.583 +/- 0.229% for Pg-3-glc and 0.036 +/- 0.011% for UACy (mean +/- SD, n = 
3), respectively. For the individual ACNs, the amount of metabolites recovered 
from Cy-3-rutin was lower than that of the original intact Cy-3-rutin, whereas 
the amounts of metabolites from Cy-3-glc and Pg-3-glc in the urine were much 
higher than their original forms. In pig plasma, the 2 original ACNs, Cy-3-glc 
and Cy-3-rutin, and a trace of 1 metabolite (cyanidin monoglucuronide) were 
detected. The plasma concentration:dose ratio of Cy-3-rutin was higher than that 
of Cy-3-glc. Different aglycones and/or sugar moieties may influence the 
absorption and metabolism of ACNs. Cy-3-glc and Cy-3-rutin had similar apparent 
excretion rates relative to dose, whereas Pg-3-glc had a much higher total 
urinary excretion than cyanidin-based anthocyanins. Most of Cy-3-glc and 
Pg-3-glc were excreted in the form of metabolites, whereas most of the 
Cy-3-rutin was excreted in its original unmetabolized form. Urinary recovery of 
the acylated anthocyanin was lower than that of nonacylated anthocyanins.

Lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities of common foods in the United 
States.

Department of Agriculture, 1120 Marshall Street, Little Rock, Arkansas 72202, 
USA.

Both lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities were determined using the 
oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC(FL)) assay with fluorescein as the 
fluorescent probe and 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride as a peroxyl 
radical generator on over 100 different kinds of foods, including fruits, 
vegetables, nuts, dried fruits, spices, cereals, infant, and other foods. Most 
of the foods were collected from four different regions and during two different 
seasons in U.S. markets. Total phenolics of each sample were also measured using 
the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. Hydrophilic ORAC(FL) values (H-ORAC(FL)) ranged 
from 0.87 to 2641 micromol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g among all of the foods, 
whereas lipophilic ORAC(FL) values (L-ORAC(FL)) ranged from 0.07 to 1611 
micromol of TE/g. Generally, L-ORAC(FL) values were <10% of the H-ORAC(FL) 
values except for a very few samples. Total antioxidant capacity was calculated 
by combining L-ORAC(FL) and H-ORAC(FL). Differences of ORAC(FL) values in fruits 
and vegetables from different seasons and regions were relatively large for some 
foods but could not be analyzed in detail because of the sampling scheme. Two 
different processing methods, cooking and peeling, were used on selected foods 
to evaluate the impact of processing on ORAC(FL). The data demonstrated that 
processing can have significant effects on ORAC(FL). Considering all of the 
foods analyzed, the relationship between TP and H-ORAC(FL) showed a very weak 
correlation. Total hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant capacity intakes were 
calculated to be 5558 and 166 micromol of TE/day, respectively, on the basis of 
data from the USDA Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994-1996).

Aglycones and sugar moieties alter anthocyanin absorption and metabolism after 
berry consumption in weanling pigs.

Wu X(1), Pittman HE 3rd, McKay S, Prior RL.

Author information:

Children's Nutrition Center, Little Rock, AR 72202, USA.

To investigate the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins (ACNs) with 
different aglycones and sugar moieties, weanling pigs (11.4 +/- 3.8 kg) were 
fed, in a single meal, a freeze-dried powder of chokeberry, black currant, or 
elderberry at a single dose of 229, 140, or 228 mumol total ACN/kg body weight 
(BW), respectively. These berries provided ACNs with differences in aglycone as 
well as some unique differences in the sugar moieties. The relative proportions 
of the different metabolites depended upon concentrations, quantities consumed, 
and types of glycoside of ACNs in the berry. Delphinidin ACNs were not 
metabolized to any measurable extent. Cyanidin ACNs were metabolized via 
methylation and glucuronidation as well as by formation of both derivatives on 
the same ACN molecule. ACNs with either a di- or trisaccharide attached to them 
were excreted in the urine primarily as the intact form. Over 80% of the ACN 
compounds containing rutinose or sambubiose, which were excreted in the urine 
from black currant, elderberry, or Marion blackberry, were excreted as the 
intact molecule. The limited metabolism of these ACNs that did occur was via 
methylation. ACN monoglycosides other than the glucoside were metabolized via 
methylation and/or glucuronide formation. The monoglucuronide that formed 
represented a small proportion of the metabolites relative to the methylated or 
the mixed methylated and glucuronide forms of ACNs. The data clearly demonstrate 
that the aglycone and the sugar moieties can alter the apparent absorption and 
metabolism of ACNs.

Breviscapine, is the total flavonoid components (the content of scutellarin > or 
=85%) extracted from the dried whole plant of Erigeron breviscapus (VANT.) 
HAND.-MAZZ, and its preparations are generally used in the clinic for the 
treatment of cerebral and cardio-vascular diseases in China. In this paper, the 
metabolites of breviscapine in the urine of rats after oral administration were 
investigated. The ten metabolites were isolated by open-column chromatography 
and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography, and their structures 
were elucidated by MS, NMR spectroscopy including (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, and NOESY 
(nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy), enzymatic hydrolysis and chemical 
evidence. The ten metabolites were identified as 
scutellarein-6,7-di-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-1), scutellarein (M-2), 
6-O-methyl-scutellarin (M-3), 6-O-methyl-scutellarein (M-4), 
scutellarein-6-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-5), scutellarein-5-O-beta-D-glucuronide 
(M-6), scutellarin (M-7), scutellarein-7-O-sulfate (M-8), 
apigenin-5-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-9), and apigenin-4'-O-beta-D-glucuronide 
(M-10) respectively. The results of this study indicated that the metabolites of 
brevisvapine were excreted in rats urine as glucuronidated, sulfated or 
methylated forms, as well as the aglycone of scutellarin-scutellarein after oral 
administration, and the metabolic pathways were also proposed.

Soy isoflavones are potentially beneficial phytoestrogens, but their 
tissue-selective effects in women are poorly understood. We tested the 
hypothesis that soy isoflavones affect bone mineral density (BMD), which may be 
influenced by individual differences in isoflavone metabolism and serum calcium 
levels. Ninety-nine healthy premenopausal women were randomized to isoflavones 
(136.6 mg aglycone equivalence) and 98 to placebo for 5 days per week for up to 
2 years. BMD, serum calcium, and urinary excretion of daidzein and genistein 
were measured before and during treatment. In 129 adherent subjects, we found 
that isoflavone exposure, determined by urinary excretion levels, but not by 
dose assignment, interacted with serum calcium in affecting whole body BMD, but 
not hip and spine BMD. The regression coefficient was -0.042 for genistein 
excretion (GE) and 0.091 for the interaction between GE and serum calcium (all 
P < .05). Daidzein excretion had similar but marginal effect. Genistein 
significantly decreased whole body BMD only at low normal serum calcium levels 
but increased whole body BMD at higher serum calcium levels. Comparing maximum 
to minimum GE, mean changes in whole body BMD were +0.033 and -0.113 g/cm2 at 
serum calcium levels of 10 and 8.15 mg/dL, respectively. These associations were 
not evident by intention-to-treat analysis, which could not model for 
inter-individual differences in isoflavone metabolism. In summary, soy 
isoflavones decrease whole body BMD only when serum calcium is low. Isoflavones 
are dietary substances that may influence calcium homeostasis by releasing 
calcium from bone while sparing the common fracture risk sites hip and spine.

Short-term soy and probiotic supplementation does not markedly affect 
concentrations of reproductive hormones in postmenopausal women with and without 
histories of breast cancer.

MN 55108, USA.

BACKGROUND: Observational studies suggest that dietary isoflavones reduce breast 
cancer risk, and this may be caused in part by effects on endogenous hormone 
concentrations. Because intestinal bacteria metabolize isoflavones, it was 
hypothesized that consumption of probiotic bacteria would enhance the biologic 
effects of isoflavones, including effects on endogenous hormones.
DESIGN: Twenty (20) postmenopausal breast cancer survivors and 20 healthy 
postmenopausal women completed four 42-day diet periods in a randomized, 
crossover design. They received one of the following: isolated soy protein; 
isolated milk protein; soy + probiotic capsules; or milk + probiotic capsules. 
Each protein supplement provided 0.38 g protein/(kg body weight/day) (26.6 +/- 
4.5 g protein/day) and soy protein provided 0.64 mg isoflavones/(kg body 
weight/day) (44.4 +/- 7.5 mg isoflavones/day). Probiotic capsules provided 10(9) 
colony-forming units Lactobacillus acidophilus (strain DDS-1), Bifidobacterium 
longum, and 15-20 mg fructo-oligosaccharide.
MEASURES: Plasma samples were collected at baseline and after each diet for 
analysis of estrogens, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), androgens, and sex 
hormone?binding globulin (SHBG).
RESULTS: Hormone levels were not affected by soy, probiotic supplements, or 
equol producer status, and neither cancer status nor equol producer status 
altered the effects of soy or probiotics. Furthermore probiotics did not alter 
the effects of soy consumption. Soy protein tended to decrease SHBG compared to 
milk protein diets (p = 0.05), although both proteins significantly decreased 
SHBG relative to baseline (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that short-term, moderate consumption of 
isoflavone-containing soy protein and consumption of these particular probiotic 
capsules do not significantly alter reproductive hormone concentrations in 
breast cancer survivors or controls, regardless of equol producer status.

The effects of soaking, boiling and steaming processes on the total phenolic 
components and antioxidant activity in commonly consumed cool season food 
legumes (CSFL's), including green pea, yellow pea, chickpea and lentil were 
investigated. As compared to original unprocessed legumes, all processing steps 
caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH free 
radical scavenging activity (DPPH) in all tested CSFL's. All soaking and 
atmospheric boiling treatments caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in oxygen 
radical absorbing capacity (ORAC). However, pressure boiling and pressure 
steaming caused significant (p<0.05) increases in ORAC values. Steaming 
treatments resulted in a greater retention of TPC, DPPH, and ORAC values in all 
tested CSFL's as compared to boiling treatments. To obtain cooked legumes with 
similar palatability and firmness, pressure boiling shortened processing time as 
compared to atmospheric boiling, resulted in insignificant differences in TPC, 
DPPH for green and yellow pea. However, TPC and DPPH in cooked lentils differed 
significantly between atmospheric and pressure boiling. As compared to 
atmospheric processes, pressure processes significantly increased ORAC values in 
both boiled and steamed CSFL's. Greater TPC, DPPH and ORAC values were detected 
in boiling water than that in soaking and steaming water. Boiling also caused 
more solid loss than steaming. Steam processing exhibited several advantages in 
retaining the integrity of the legume appearance and texture of the cooked 
product, shortening process time, and greater retention of antioxidant 
components and activities.

The effects of soaking, boiling, and steaming processes on the phenolic 
components and antioxidant activity of black beans were investigated. All 
processed beans exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) lower antioxidant activities 
than raw beans in total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH free radical scavenging 
activity (DPPH), and oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC). Steaming 
processes resulted in a greater retention of TPC and ORAC values than the 
boiling processes. Pressure boiling shortened processing time compared to 
regular boiling, resulted in insignificant differences in TPC, but significantly 
increased in ORAC as compared to the regular boiling method. Pressure steaming 
resulted in significant decreases in TPC, DPPH, while significantly increased in 
ORAC compared to regular steaming. Greater TPC, DPPH, and ORAC values were 
detected in boiling water than in the soaking and steaming water. Mass balance 
analysis showed that boiling caused more dry solid loss than steaming. All of 
these results indicated that processing methods significantly changed contents 
and activities of antioxidant components of black beans. Steam processing 
exhibited several advantages in appearance and texture of the cooked product, 
shortening processing time, and in greater retention of TPC and antioxidant 
activities. Steam processing may be used to develop high-quality 
health-promoting black bean products.

Potatoes in the diet contribute significantly to antioxidant daily intake 
worldwide. The influence of different domestic cooking conditions, boiling, 
microwaving, and baking, on total phenolics (TP), antioxidant capacity, phenolic 
composition, and tryptophan content was studied using eight commercial potato 
varieties. The antioxidant capacity was detected by the methods of oxygen 
radical absorbance capacity assay (ORAC) and the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 
free radical (DPPH(*)) assay. The phenolic composition and tryptophan content 
were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a 
diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), whereas phenolics and tryptophan were 
identified by means of HPLC-mass spectrometry, HPLC-DAD, and authentic 
standards. Antioxidant capacity was influenced by potato variety and cooking 
conditions; however, cooked potatoes retained 68-97% ORAC value depending on 
cooking procedure and variety. Chlorogenic acid and its isomers dominated the 
phenolic composition of each variety involved in this study. ORAC and TP were 
highly and positively correlated (r = 0.9119). Norkotah ranked highest in 
chlorogenic acid content and antioxidant value. Principal component analysis 
showed different cooking processes did not influence the trend of the 
antioxidant profile of the eight potato varieties, but specific compounds exert 
influence on the antioxidant capacity. The results imply that the potato 
varieties rich in antioxidant components could be good antioxidant sources as 
activities are not greatly affected by different cooking conditions.

Toxicology, Stocking Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.

Epidemiological studies have indicated that the consumption of fruits and 
vegetables is associated with a reduced risk for the development of chronic 
diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Phytochemicals, including 
phenolics and flavonoids, are suggested to be the major bioactive compounds 
contributing to the health benefits of fruits and vegetables. Onions are a major 
source of dietary flavonoids; however, there may exist varietal differences in 
composition, concentration, and beneficial activities. To characterize these 
differences, shallots and 10 onion (Allium cepa L.) varieties commonly available 
in the United States (Western Yellow, Northern Red, New York Bold, Western 
White, Peruvian Sweet, Empire Sweet, Mexico, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley Sweet, 
and Vidalia) were evaluated for total phenolic and flavonoid contents and 
antioxidant and antiproliferative activities. Shallots contained the highest 
total phenolic content (114.7 +/- 10.0 mg/100 g of sample) among the varieties 
tested, with a 6-fold difference observed when compared to the variety with the 
lowest phenolic content (Vidalia, p < 0.05). Western Yellow onion variety 
exhibited the highest total flavonoid content (69.2 +/- 3.7 mg/100 g of onion) 
of the varieties tested, with an 11-fold difference when compared to the variety 
with the lowest flavonoid content (Western White, p < 0.05). Shallots exhibited 
the highest total antioxidant activity (45.5 +/- 2.1 micromol of vitamin C 
equiv/g of onion), followed by Western Yellow, New York Bold, Northern Red, 
Mexico, Empire Sweet, Western White, Peruvian Sweet, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley 
Sweet, and Vidalia. For all varieties, both total phenolic and flavonoid 
contents were strongly correlated with total antioxidant activity (R (2) = 
0.9668, p < 0.05; and R (2) = 0.7033, p < 0.05, respectively). The proliferation 
of HepG(2) and Caco-2 cells was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent 
fashion after exposure to the Western Yellow, shallots, New York Bold, and 
Northern Red extracts, with Western Yellow, shallots, and New York Bold 
exhibiting the highest antiproliferative activity against HepG(2) cells and New 
York Bold and Western Yellow exhibiting the highest antiproliferative activity 
against Caco-2 cells. However, the varieties of Western White, Peruvian Sweet, 
Empire Sweet, Mexico, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley Sweet, and Vidalia 
demonstrated weak antiproliferative activity against both HepG(2) and Caco-2 
cells. These results may influence consumers toward purchasing onion varieties 
exhibiting greater potential health benefits and may significantly affect future 
breeding efforts to enhance onion nutritional qualities.

To explore the metabolism of 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (1,5-DCQA) in rats, 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in parallel to diode-array detection was 
used for the rapid detection/characterization of the metabolites formed in bile, 
urine, and plasma of rats following oral administration of 1,5-DCQA (160 mg/kg). 
The methylation and glucuronidation of 1,5-DCQA occurring in vitro using rat 
liver and small intestinal microsomes and cytosols were studied in comparison 
with those occurring in vivo, and the enzymes involved were also determined. In 
addition, the anti-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) activity of three 
important metabolites was preliminarily evaluated in MT-4 cells infected with 
HIV-1. A total of 22 metabolites in vivo and in vitro were identified, including 
four isomeric O-mono-methylated metabolites (M8-M11), nine isomeric 
O-di-methylated metabolites (M3, M6, M22, and M12-M17), four isomeric 
O-mono-methyl-glucuronidated metabolites (M2 and M19-M21), four isomeric 
O-di-methyl-glucuronidated metabolites (M1, M4, M5, and M7), and one 
glucuronidated metabolite (M18). The O-methylation positions of three important 
metabolites (M8, M9, and M12) were determined (3''-, 3'-, and 3',3''-) by 
comparing with synthesized standards. The efficacy experiments showed that M8, 
M9, and M12 could inhibit HIV replication with IC(50) values of about 25, 25, 
and 46 microM, respectively. These results suggest that O-methylation and 
glucuronidation are two important metabolic pathways of 1,5-DCQA, that both rat 
liver and small intestine can catalyze such reactions by 
catechol-O-methyltransferase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and that the 
HIV-1 inhibitory activity of M8, M9, and M12 is comparable to or slightly weaker 
than that of 1,5-DCQA.

Naringenin chalcone is the main active component of tomato skin extract, which 
has an antiallergic activity. In this study, naringenin chalcone was orally 
administered to rats, and the chemical structures and levels of the major 
metabolites in the plasma and urine of rats were determined. HPLC analysis 
indicated the presence of three major metabolites in the urine. LC-MS and NMR 
analyses tentatively identified these as naringenin 
chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide, naringenin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide, and 
naringenin-4'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Naringenin chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide 
was the only metabolite detected in the plasma, and its peak plasma level was 
observed 1 h after naringenin chalcone administration. Naringenin 
chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide also inhibited histamine release from rat 
peritoneal mast cells stimulated with compound 48/80. This activity might 
contribute to the antiallergic activity of naringenin chalcone in vivo. To the 
best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to report determination 
of naringenin chalcone metabolites in rat plasma and urine.

Phytochemical phenolics in organically grown vegetables.

USA.

Fruit and vegetable intake is inversely correlated with risks for several 
chronic diseases in humans. Phytochemicals, and in particular, phenolic 
compounds, present in plant foods may be partly responsible for these health 
benefits through a variety of mechanisms. Since environmental factors play a 
role in a plant's production of secondary metabolites, it was hypothesized that 
an organic agricultural production system would increase phenolic levels. 
Cultivars of leaf lettuce, collards, and pac choi were grown either on 
organically certified plots or on adjacent conventional plots. Nine prominent 
phenolic agents were quantified by HPLC, including phenolic acids (e. g. caffeic 
acid and gallic acid) and aglycone or glycoside flavonoids (e. g. apigenin, 
kaempferol, luteolin, and quercetin). Statistically, we did not find significant 
higher levels of phenolic agents in lettuce and collard samples grown 
organically. The total phenolic content of organic pac choi samples as measured 
by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, however, was significantly higher than 
conventional samples (p < 0.01), and seemed to be associated with a greater 
attack the plants in organic plots by flea beetles. These results indicated that 
although organic production method alone did not enhance biosynthesis of 
phytochemicals in lettuce and collards, the organic system provided an increased 
opportunity for insect attack, resulting in a higher level of total phenolic 
agents in pac choi.

Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2P5, Canada.

Phenolic acids from 30 barley varieties (combination of 
hulled/hulless/two-row/six-row/regular/waxy) were investigated by HPLC following 
four different sample treatments: (a) simple hot water extraction, (b) 
extraction after acid hydrolysis, (c) acid plus alpha-amylase hydrolysis, and 
(d) acid plus alpha-amylase plus cellulase hydrolysis treatments. The benzoic 
acid (p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, and protocatechuic acids) and cinnamic acid 
derivatives (coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, and chlorogenic acids) were identified, 
and some of the phenolic acids were quantified after each above-mentioned 
treatment. The data indicated that a combination of sequential acid, 
alpha-amylase, and cellulase hydrolysis treatments might be applicable for 
release of more phenolic acids from barley.

Nutritionists recommend increasing the intake of soluble dietary fiber (SDF), 
which is very low in most cereal-based products. Conversion of insoluble DF 
(IDF) into SDF can be achieved by chemical treatments, but this affects the 
sensorial properties of the products. In this study, the possibility of getting 
a substantial increase of SDF from cereal products using a tailored preparation 
of Trichoderma enzymes is reported. Enzymes were produced cultivating 
Trichoderma using durum wheat fiber (DWF) and barley spent grain (BSG) as unique 
carbon sources. Many Trichoderma strains were screened, and the hydrolysis 
conditions able to increase by enzymatic treatment the amount of SDF in DWF and 
BSG were determined. Results demonstrate in both products that it is possible to 
triple the amount of SDF without a marked decrease of total DF. The enzymatic 
treatment also causes the release of hydroxycinnamic acids, mainly ferulic acid, 
that are linked to the polysaccharides chains. This increases the free phenolic 
concentration, the water-soluble antioxidant activity, and, in turn, the phenol 
compounds bioavailability.

PURPOSE: Resveratrol, a phenolic phytoalexin occurring in grapes, wine, peanuts, 
and cranberries, has been reported to have anticarcinogenic, antioxidative, 
phytoestrogenic, and cardioprotective activities. Because little is known about 
the metabolism of this potentially important compound, the in vitro and in vivo 
metabolism of trans-resveratrol were investigated.
METHODS: The in vitro experiments included incubation with human liver 
microsomes, human hepatocytes, and rat hepatocytes and the in vivo studies 
included oral or intraperitoneal administration of resveratrol to rats and mice. 
Methanol extracts of rat urine, mouse serum, human hepatocytes, rat hepatocytes, 
and human liver microsomes were analyzed for resveratrol metabolites using 
reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with on-line 
ultraviolet-photodiode array detection and mass spectrometric detection 
(LC-DAD-MS and LC-UV-MS-MS). UV-photodiode array analysis facilitated the 
identification of cis- and trans-isomers of resveratrol and its metabolites. 
Negative ion electrospray mass spectrometric analysis provided molecular weight 
confirmation of resveratrol metabolites and tandem mass spectrometry allowed 
structural information to be obtained.
RESULTS: No resveratrol metabolites were detected in the microsomal incubations, 
and no phase I metabolites, such as oxidations, reductions, or hydrolyzes, were 
observed in any samples. However, abundant trans-resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide and 
trans-resveratrol-3-sulfate were identified in rat urine, mouse serum, and 
incubations with rat and human hepatocytes. Incubation with beta-glucuronidase 
and sulfatase to release free resveratrol was used to confirm the structures of 
these conjugates. Only trace amounts of cis-resveratrol were detected, 
indicating that isomerization was not an important factor in the metabolism and 
elimination of resveratrol.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that trans-resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide and 
trans-resveratrol-3-sulfate are the most abundant metabolites of resveratrol. 
Virtually no unconjugated resveratrol was detected in urine or serum samples, 
which might have implications regarding the significance of in vitro studies 
that used only unconjugated resveratrol.

The composition of phenolic acids in several small berries grown in Northeastern 
Poland, namely, low-bush blueberries, black mulberries, European juneberries, 
black currants, fruits of blue-berried honeysuckle, and blackberries, was 
determined by gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS). The total 
content of phenolic acids, identified by GC-MS, ranged from 2845.8 +/- 141.0 
(black mulberries) to 5418.2 +/- 228.0 (blue-berried honeysuckle). Twenty 
phenolic acids were identified in the berries. Of these, hydroxycaffeic, m- and 
p-coumaric, and 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acids were the major phenolic acids in 
blackberries and blueberries, m-coumaric acid was the major phenolic acid in 
blue-berried honeysuckle and black currant fruits, while salicylic, caffeic, and 
m- and p-coumaric acids were the predominant phenolic acids in European 
juneberries. Syringic and veratric acids were detected only in blueberries, 
while p-hydroxybenzoic and sinapic acids were present only in black currants and 
o-coumaric acid was present in blueberries and black mulberries. The phenolic 
acids liberated from esters and glycosidic bonds were the major fractions of 
phenolic acids in the berries.

From red raspberries, ellagic acid, its 4-arabinoside, its 4' (4' '-acetyl) 
arabinoside, and its 4' (4' '-acetyl)xyloside, as well as quercetin and 
kaempferol 3-glucosides, were identified. In addition, two unidentified ellagic 
acid derivatives were detected. The free radical scavenging activity of the 
ellagic acid derivatives was evaluated by using the DPPH method and compared to 
that of Trolox. All of the isolated compounds showed antioxidant activity. The 
effect of processing to obtain jams on raspberry phenolics was evaluated. The 
flavonol content decreased slightly with processing and more markedly during 
storage of the jams. The ellagic acid derivatives, with the exception of ellagic 
acid itself, remained quite stable with processing and during 6 months of jam 
storage. The content of free ellagic acid increased 3-fold during the storage 
period. The initial content (10 mg/kg of fresh weight of raspberries) increased 
2-fold with processing, and it continued increasing up to 35 mg/kg after 1 month 
of storage of the jam. Then a slight decrease was observed until 6 months of 
storage had elapsed. The increase observed in ellagic acid could be explained by 
a release of ellagic acid from ellagitannins with the thermal treatment.

Polyphenol content, free radical scavenging capacity, and changes during storage 
over 7 months in the dark were studied in ecological and conventional red and 
white wines. In red wines, the most changeable components during storage were 
the anthocyanins since during storage anthocyanins content decreased 88% in 
conventional wine and 91% in ecological wine. Initially, the total flavonol 
contents of the conventional and ecological red wines were 163.88 +/- 2.69 and 
153.58 +/- 1.71 mg/L, respectively, and no significant variations occurred 
during storage. No differences in hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives content 
between conventional and ecological red and white wines were observed. The 
flavonol level in white wines was very low, as expected since these compounds 
are found in grape skin. The initial antioxidant activity was 5.37 +/- 0.14 and 
5.82 +/- 0.31 mM equivalents Trolox for conventional and ecological red wines, 
respectively; no significant differences were observed (p = 0.2831), and these 
values were 7-8 times higher than the antioxidant activity observed in 
conventional and ecological white wine. In contrast with other studies, the 
total concentrations of phenolic compounds in conventional and ecological red 
and white wines were not related to antioxidant activity (p > 0.05). In red 
wines, no significant differences were observed in the antioxidant activity of 
ecological and conventional red wine (p = 0.28), while in white wine significant 
differences were observed in the antioxidant activity between conventional and 
ecological white wine (p = 0.006).

BACKGROUND: Nutritional biomarkers may be better measures of dietary exposure 
than self-reported dietary data. We evaluated resveratrol metabolites, potential 
biomarkers of wine consumption, in humans after moderate consumption of 
sparkling, white, or red wines.
METHODS: We performed 2 randomized, crossover trials and a cohort study. In the 
first study, 10 healthy men consumed 30 g of ethanol/day as sparkling wine or 
gin for 28 days. In the second trial, 10 healthy women consumed 20 g of 
ethanol/day as white or red wine for 28 days. We also evaluated 52 participants 
in a study on the effects of a Mediterranean diet on primary prevention of 
cardiovascular disease (the PREDIMED Study). We used liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to analyze urinary total resveratrol 
metabolites (TRMs) and predictive values and ROC curve analyses to assess the 
diagnostic accuracy.
RESULTS: We observed significant increases in TRMs [72.4 (95% confidence 
interval, 48.5-96.2; P = 0.005), 211.5 (166.6-256.3; P = 0.005), and 560.5 
nmol/g creatinine (244.9-876.1; P = 0.005)] after consumption of sparkling, 
white, or red wine, respectively, but no changes after the washout or gin 
periods. In the cohort study, the reported daily dose of wine consumption 
correlated directly with TRMs (r = 0.654; P < 0.001). Using a cutoff of 90 
nmol/g, we were able to use TRMs to differentiate wine consumers from abstainers 
with a sensitivity of 72% (60%-84%); and a specificity of 94% (87%-100%).
CONCLUSIONS: Resveratrol metabolites in urine may be useful biomarkers of wine 
intake in epidemiologic and intervention studies.

The study was aimed at verification of the following hypothesis: differences in 
antioxidant capacity of diets consisting of different cereals and byproducts 
affect the antioxidant status of the consumers of these diets. To validate that 
hypothesis this study investigated the contents of polyphenols and 
alpha-tocopherol as well as the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in vitro of 
cereals and their fractions (barley, husked and naked oat, oat bran, and 
triticale); the nutritional and antioxidant properties of diets containing these 
cereals, applied in a 4-week feeding experiment on rats, were also assessed. 
Among the cereals examined, the highest TAC was reported for barley (13.16 
micromol of Trolox/g) and the lowest for naked oat (3.84 micromol of Trolox/g). 
Compared with cereals, the TAC of buckwheat waste was 2-3 times higher (25.2 
micromol of Trolox/g). The antioxidant capacity of diets, calculated in vitro, 
ranged from 6.35 micromol of Trolox/g for naked oat type diet to 10.51 micromol 
of Trolox/g for barley type diet. Results of an in vitro study were confirmed in 
changes of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and the level of 
thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in the serum of rats fed diets 
with the highest and lowest antioxidant capacities in vitro; the barley diet 
increased the activity of GPx (37.63 units/mL) and decreased the level of TBARS 
(4.82 microg/g), whereas the naked oat diet had an opposite effect (31.16 
units/mL and 5.91 microg/g, respectively).

The main flavonoids in grapefruit juice, naringin and narirutin, were quantified 
by LC-MS with structural differentiation by LC-MS/MS. After human consumption of 
grapefruit juice, urine samples were collected for 24 hours and screened for 
flavonoid metabolites by LC-MS. The metabolite structures (glucuronides, 
sulfates, and glucuronide sulfates) were then confirmed via their unique 
fragmentation patterns by LC-MS/MS. To further verify the identity of the common 
aglycon (naringenin) shared by the metabolites, enzymatic hydrolysis was 
performed and the resulting products were analyzed. This work demonstrates that 
LC-MS and LC-MS/MS techniques can be used for fast metabolite screening without 
extensive sample preparation.

Fuzi is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. Clinical Fuzi poisoning 
cases have frequently been reported. Glycyrrhizae Radix is often used to 
alleviate Fuzi's toxicity. However, the poisoning mechanism of Fuzi and the 
detoxication mechanism of Glycyrrhizae Radix are still not clear. We identified 
the chemical components of Fuzi at different decoction times (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 
6 h) using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight 
mass spectrometry. A total of 35 compounds were detected in the Fuzi decoction, 
including diester alkaloids, monoester alkaloids, amino acids, phenolic acids, 
organic acids, glycosides, and sugars among others. The content of diester 
alkaloids (i.e., subaconitine, neoaconitine, and aconitine) in the Fuzi 
decoction decreased after 2 h of decoction time, while the content of monoester 
alkaloids (i.e., benzoyl aconitine and benzoyl subaconitine) reached a peak at 
2 h. A total of 32 rats were randomly divided into four groups, including 8 
cases in the low-dosage Fuzi decoction group A, 8 cases in the high-dosage Fuzi 
decoction group B, 8 cases in the Fuzi and glycyrrhizae decoction group C, and 8 
cases in the control group D. The decoction was administered orally for 7 days. 
Then, a serum was obtained. The metabolites' changes were analyzed in serum 
metabolomics using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). 
Statistical analysis and pathway analysis were used to assess the effects of 
glycyrrhizae on the metabolic changes induced by Fuzi. The behavioral and 
biochemical characteristics indicated that Fuzi exhibited toxic effects on rats 
and their metabolic profiles changed. However, the metabolic profiles of the 
glycyrrhizae group became similar to those of the control group. These profiles 
showed that glycyrrhizae can effectively improve Fuzi poisoning rats. Our study 
demonstrated that the established pseudotargeted metabolomics is a powerful 
approach for investigating the mechanisms of herbal toxicity.

This is a report about the identification of key metabolites of tectorigenin in 
rat urine using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization 
ion trap tandem mass spectrometric method (HPLC-ESI-MS(n)). Six healthy rats 
were administered a single dose (80 mg/kg) of tectorigenin by oral gavage. Urine 
was sampled for 0-24 h and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the 
supernatants, then the supernatants were purified by solid-phase extraction with 
a C(18) cartridge. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a 
reversed-phase C(18) column with a gradient elution program whereas 
acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid water was used as mobile phase. Mass spectra were 
acquired in negative ionization mode and a data-dependant scan was used for the 
identification of the key metabolites of tectorigenin in the urine samples. As a 
result, four phase II metabolites and the parent drug tectorigenin were found 
and identified in rat urine for the first time.

Phenolic acids (PAs) have been shown to be beneficial to human health and are 
found most abundantly in corn bran ( approximately 4%, w/w), one of the main 
dietary fibers. This study therefore evaluated the bioavailabilities of phenolic 
antioxidants ferulic acid (FA) and p-coumaric acid (PCA) in refined corn bran 
(RCB) by determining their recovery in the plasma, urine, and feces of rats fed 
a single meal of a RCB diet containing 5% RCB or adapted to the RCB diet for 10 
days. In both studies, 0.4-0.5% of ingested FA and 1.2-2.3% of ingested PCA were 
recovered in rat urine. By contrast, approximately 81% of FA and approximately 
64% of PCA ingested with the single meal were excreted through the rat feces 
within 3 days after the ingestion. On the other hand, after rats were fed the 
RCB diet, total FA (all forms of FA) was recovered in plasma at a concentration 
of 35.0 +/- 2.0 microg/L, total FA and total PCA were excreted through urine at 
levels of 155.4 +/- 5.8 and 50.9 +/- 6.6 microg/day, respectively. These 
parameters showed no significant change (P = 0.93, 0.09, and 0.66, respectively) 
after rats were fed the RCB diet continuously for up to 10 days. These results 
suggest that the PAs in RCB are bioavailable in rats. Their bioavailabilities, 
however, are relatively low compared with their high content in RCB and not 
improved by the adaptation for 10 days to the enriched RCB diet. Additionally, 
comparison with the results of other studies revealed that high contents of FA 
and, especially, diferulic acids in cereal bran, which act as cross-links 
between bran cell wall polysaccharides, may not improve but, rather, limit the 
bioavailabilities of PAs in vivo.

Sesamin is one of the major precursors of mammalian lignans in sesame seed 
(Sesamum indicum) as observed in vitro and in rats.

Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5S 3E2, Canada.

Plant lignans occur in many foods, with flaxseed presently recognized as the 
richest source. Some plant lignans can be converted by intestinal microbiota to 
the mammalian lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, which may have protective 
effects against hormone-related diseases such as breast cancer. This study 
determined whether plant lignans in sesame seed, particularly sesamin, could be 
metabolized to the mammalian lignans. The total plant lignan concentration in 
sesame seed (2180 micromol/100 g) was higher than that in flaxseed (820 
micromol/100 g). In vitro fermentation with human fecal inoculum showed 
conversion of sesamin to the mammalian lignans, although at a lower rate (1.1%) 
compared with that of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (57.2%). However, when 
fed to female Sprague-Dawley rats for 10 d, sesamin (15 mg/kg body weight) and a 
10% sesame seed diet resulted in greater (P < 0.05) urinary mammalian lignan 
excretion (3.2 and 11.2 micromol/d, respectively), than the control (< 0.05 
micromol/d). We conclude that sesame seed is a rich source of mammalian lignan 
precursors and sesamin is one of them. From intermediate metabolites of sesamin 
identified in rat urine by GC-MS, a tentative metabolic pathway of sesamin to 
mammalian lignans is suggested.

Sciences in Lublin, 8 Skromna Street, 20-704 Lublin, Poland.

The objective of the study was to analyze the effect of total content of 
minerals in waters on the effectiveness of extraction of polyphenols and 
flavonoids and on the antioxidant properties of brews from leaves of green and 
black tea, leaves of peppermint, chamomile inflorescences, leaves of sage, and 
flowers of lavender. The process of brewing was conducted at an initial 
temperature of 95 °C, under cover, for 15 min, with the use of 10 waters 
differing in terms of mineral components. The content of total polyphenols and 
total flavonoids was determined in the brews obtained. The antioxidant 
properties were assayed with the use of stable DPPH radicals and Ferric Reducing 
Antioxidant Power (FRAP) reagent. A significant effect of water mineralization 
on the extraction of phenolic compounds and on the antioxidant properties of the 
brews obtained was observed. In the majority of cases, the highest 
concentrations of polyphenols and flavonoids were obtained in brews prepared 
with the use of deionized water and waters with medium levels of mineralization. 
It was also demonstrated that there was a significant reduction of antioxidant 
properties in brews prepared with the water that had the highest level of 
mineralization (2896 ppm), at 70% and 93%, respectively, for green and black 
teas.

Oxygen radical absorbing capacity of phenolics in blueberries, cranberries, 
chokeberries, and lingonberries.

Zheng W(1), Wang SY.

(1)Fruit Laboratory, Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Agricultural 
Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Beltsville, MD 20705, USA.

The antioxidant activity of phenolics in fruits of blueberry (Vaccinium 
corymbosum cv. Sierra), cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon cv. Ben Lear), wild 
chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa), and lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea cv. 
Amberland) was determined in this study. The phenolic constituents and contents 
among the different berries varied considerably. Anthocyanins were found to be 
the main components in all these berries. Chlorogenic acid in blueberry, 
quercetin glycosides in cranberry and lingonberry, and caffeic acid and its 
derivative in chokeberry were also present in relatively high concentrations. 
Chlorogenic acid, peonidin 3-galactoside, cyanidin 3-galactoside, and cyanidin 
3-galactoside were the most important antioxidants in blueberry, cranberry, wild 
chokeberry, and lingonberry, respectively. The contribution of individual 
phenolics to the total antioxidant capacity was generally dependent on their 
structure and content in the berries. Phenolics such as quercetin and cyanidin, 
with 3',4'-dihydroxy substituents in the B ring and conjugation between the A 
and B rings, had highly effective radical scavenging structures in blueberries, 
cranberries, chokeberries, and lingonberries. Phenolic acids such as caffeic 
acid also showed high antioxidant activity, probably due to its dihydroxylation 
in the 3,4 positions as hydrogen donors.

The purpose of this study was to examine the antioxidant properties of water and 
80% methanolic extracts of cereal grains and their different morphological 
fractions. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. Almari and cv. Henika, barley 
(Hordeum vulgare L.) cv. Gregor and cv. Mobek, rye (Secale cereale L.) cv. 
Dańkowskie Zlote, oat (Avena sativa L.) cv. Slawko and buckwheat (Fagopyrum 
esculentum Moench) cv. Kora were used. PC (L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine) liposome 
system and spectrophotometric assay of total antioxidant activity (TAA) were 
used to evaluate the antioxidative activity of extracts. Among the water 
extracts, only the one prepared from buckwheat exhibited antioxidant activity at 
the concentration analyzed. The following hierarchy of antioxidant activity was 
provided for 80% methanolic extracts originated from whole grain: buckwheat > 
barley > oat > wheat congruent with rye. The antioxidant activity was observed 
in extract prepared from separated parts of buckwheat and barley. In respect to 
hulls, the antioxidant hierarchy was as follows: buckwheat > oat > barley. The 
correlation coefficient between total phenolic compounds and total antioxidative 
activity of the extracts was -0.35 for water extracts and 0.96, 0.99, 0.80, and 
0.99 for 80% methanolic extracts originated from whole grains, hulls, pericarb 
with testa fractions and endosperm with embryo fractions, respectively.

The seeds of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench L.) were dehulled and then, 
following milling, extruded on a counter rotating, twin-screw extruder with the 
different barrel temperature profiles: 120, 160, and 200 degrees C. After 
extrusion cooking process, the following compounds were analyzed: free and 
conjugated phenolic acids, total polyphenols (TPC), tocopherols (T) and 
tocotrienols (T3), inositol phosphates (IP), reduced glutathione (GSH), and 
melatonin (MLT). The antioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase-like activity 
(SOD-like activity) were determined in the groats and extrudates. Extrusion 
caused a significant decrease in all the compounds tested, except for phenolic 
acids. The content of IP decreased by 13%, that of GSH by 42%, and that of T + 
T3 by 62%. A three-fold lower level of MLT and TPC was noted whereas the 
SOD-like activity disappeared when compared to the nonextruded material. A 
two-fold higher content of phenolic acids (free and released from ester bonds) 
was observed. In spite of the clear decrease in the investigated antioxidants, 
the extruded dehulled buckwheat seeds contained still significant content of 
bioactive compounds, which resulted in as little as an average 10% decrease of 
the antioxidant capacity.

Dartmouth, 285 Old Westport Road, North Dartmouth 02747, USA. yzuo@umassd.edu

A GC-MS method is reported for separation and characterization of widely 
different amounts of benzoic and phenolic acids as their trimethylsilyl 
derivatives simultaneously in cranberry. Fifteen benzoic and phenolic acids 
(benzoic, o-hydroxybenzoic, cinnamic, m-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxybenzoic, 
p-hydroxyphenyl acetic, phthalic, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic, vanillic, 
o-hydroxycinnamic, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic, p-coumaric, ferulic, caffeic, and 
sinapic acid) were identified in cranberry fruit in their free and bound forms 
on the basis of GC retention times and simultaneously recorded mass spectra. 
Except for benzoic, p-coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, and sinapic acids, 10 other 
phenolic acids identified have not been reported in cranberry before. The 
quantitation of the identified components was based on total ion current (TIC). 
The experimental results indicated cranberry fruit contains a high content of 
benzoic and phenolic acids (5.7 g/kg fresh weight) with benzoic acid being the 
most abundant (4.7 g/kg fresh weight). The next most abundant are p-coumaric 
(0.25 g/kg fresh weight) and sinapic (0.21 g/kg fresh weight) acid. Benzoic and 
phenolic acids occur mainly in bound forms and only about 10% occurs as free 
acid.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the most diagnosed cancer worldwide and is associated 
with various unmet supportive care needs. To address these needs, a 6-week 
virtual program called Inspire Now was developed, integrating yoga, education, 
and group support. The primary objective of this mixed-methods observational 
study was to evaluate the program's impact on quality of life (QOL). Secondary 
objectives included changes in participant-identified concerns, participants' 
qualitative experiences, and acceptability of virtual delivery.
METHODS: Eligible participants included people with primary lung cancer enrolled 
in the program. Questionnaires were administered at baseline and program 
completion. QOL and patient-identified concerns were evaluated by within-person 
changes in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung (FACT-L) and Measure 
Yourself Concerns and Wellbeing (MYCaW). Qualitative experiences and feasibility 
of virtual delivery were obtained by MYCaW and an internally developed 
questionnaire. FACT-L and MYCaW were analyzed using paired t-tests, and 
qualitative data was evaluated by an inductive thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Forty-five participants were enrolled and 31 were eligible for 
analysis. Most were female (87%), had stage IV disease (68%), and were on active 
treatment (74%). Significant improvements were observed in FACT-General and Lung 
scores (mean changes: +6.1, 95% CI 2.2- 10.0, P = .003; +5.9, 95% CI 1.1-10.7, 
P = .02, respectively). MYCaW concerns and overall wellbeing were significantly 
improved. Participants viewed the virtual format favorably. Emotional support 
and connection were the most valued aspects of the program.
CONCLUSIONS: A 6-week virtual program of yoga, education, and group support 
improved QOL, patient-specific concerns, and wellbeing for those with lung 
cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mediating role of financial toxicity in the 
relationship between perceived social support and negative emotions among 
post-surgical lung cancer patients in China.
METHODS: A total of 447 lung cancer patients from China were recruited, 
participants completed the Comprehensive Scores for Financial Toxicity (COST), 
the Negative Emotion Screening Scale (NESS), and the Perceived Social Support 
Scale (PSSS). The hypothesized relations were explored using structural equation 
modeling via the bootstrapping approach. The study methods were compliant with 
the STROBE checklist.
RESULTS: Nearly half (42.51%, n = 190) of the participants experienced financial 
toxicity. Negative emotions were negatively associated with perceived social 
support (r = -0.13) and negatively associated with financial toxicity scores (r 
= -0.50) (Note: COST is a reverse scoring scale, lower COST scores illustrate 
severe financial toxicity). Perceived social support was positively correlated 
with financial toxicity scores (r = 0.26). Financial toxicity scores negatively 
predicted negative emotions (β = -0.504). Social support and financial toxicity 
could explain 25.3% of the variance in patients' negative emotions. Social 
support positively predicted financial toxicity (β = 0.257) and explained 6.60% 
of the variance in financial toxicity. Furthermore, financial toxicity 
completely mediated the association between perceived social support and 
negative emotions (b = -0.124; 95% confidence interval: -0.182, -0.086).
CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of financial toxicity demonstrates its crucial 
role in patient outcomes. Our findings reveal that social support indirectly 
influences negative emotions through financial toxicity, establishing a clear 
pathway linking psychosocial and financial aspects of cancer care. These results 
suggest that integrated interventions targeting both financial burden and social 
support networks may be particularly effective in improving psychological 
outcomes among lung cancer patients in China's high-middle income regions. 
Future healthcare policies should prioritize comprehensive support systems that 
address this complex interplay of socioeconomic and psychological factors.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths 
worldwide, with drug resistance being a major challenge in limiting the 
available treatment options. This review focuses on the signaling pathways 
(Hedgehog, Hippo, Notch, Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK/ERK pathways) that 
are implicated in the development of drug resistance mechanisms in CRC, such as 
DNA repair systems, tumor microenvironments, autophagy, metabolic reprogramming, 
evasion of apoptosis, and efflux pumps. Furthermore, recent advancements in 
targeted and combinatorial diagnostic-therapeutic approaches are highlighted. 
This review delineates the significance of signaling cascades and their clinical 
relevance, offering novel perspectives on the formulation of therapeutic 
strategies to mitigate drug resistance. In light of the increasing prevalence of 
drug-resistant CRC and the lack of effective solutions, it addresses the 
persistent demand for improved therapeutic modalities and provides a 
comprehensive framework for forthcoming research in this domain.

Prolonged use of conventional chemotherapy has led to adverse side effects and 
drug resistance, leading to therapeutic failure in colon cancer patients. An 
alternative therapy involving natural products with least toxicity can show 
promising results in cancer therapeutics. A bioactive alkaloid Piperlongumine 
(PIP), found in our culinary spice, exhibits potential pharmacological 
relevance, especially regarding its anticancer effects. This study is an 
original research work examining the anticancer efficacy of PIP and its related 
molecular mechanisms in human colon cancer cells. The results revealed that PIP 
induces selective cytotoxicity against colon cancer cells while inhibiting 
proliferation, migration and invasion. PIP also builds up reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) that increase the oxidative stress of the cells leading to 
disruption of the mitochondrial membrane and loss of mitochondrial membrane 
potential. In addition, PIP induces cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase of the 
cell cycle and impedes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in colon cancer 
cells. Further, PIP-mediated elevated intracellular ROS induces DNA damage and 
activates the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway in colon cancer cells. PIP 
also reports an anti-tumorigenic effect on the multicellular tumor spheroids of 
colon cancer cells. Collectively, these findings validate that PIP shows 
promising anticancer potential towards colon cancer cells and is a potential 
candidate for use in combination with existing anticancer drugs.

Blockade of the programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) enhances the efficacy 
of standard chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of triple-negative early 
breast cancer (TNBC) but is associated with adverse events. This phase 2 trial 
evaluated camrelizumab (anti-PD-1) combined with chemotherapy in locally 
advanced immunomodulatory TNBC (CD8+ T-cell infiltration ≥ 10%). From October 
2022 to September 2023, 90 stage II-III TNBC patients were randomized to receive 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy ± camrelizumab (200 mg biweekly). The 
camrelizumab-chemotherapy group (n = 45) achieved a pathological complete 
response (pCR) rate of 62.2% (95% CI:46.5-76.2%) versus 42.2% (27.7-57.8%) in 
the chemotherapy-alone group (n = 45), with a 20.0% absolute increase (P = 
0.059). Grade ≥ 3 adverse events occurred in 88.9% (40/45) and 82.2% (37/45) of 
patients, respectively. Multi-omics analyses demonstrated significantly elevated 
CD8+T-cell infiltration in camrelizumab-treated pCR patients, alongside strong 
correlations between PD-L1 expression, stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes 
(sTILs), and CD8+ density. These results indicate that CD8-guided 
immunochemotherapy with camrelizumab improves pCR rates in high tumor burden 
TNBC with manageable toxicity, supporting CD8+ T-cell levels as a predictive 
biomarker for immunotherapy response.

Embryonic Transcription Factors (TFs) are often reactivated in cancer, driving 
developmental gene programs that support phenotypic plasticity. Metabolic 
adaptation fuels this plasticity by supplying energy and molecular building 
blocks for growth. RUNX2, the master regulator of bone morphogenesis, is 
ectopically expressed in epithelial cancer, promoting metastasis through 
trans-differentiation processes like Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) 
and osteomimicry. By combining omics data with functional validation, we 
demonstrated that RUNX2 drives cancer cell metabolic rewiring by repressing 
mitochondrial respiration while promoting anabolic processes. We showed that 
RUNX2 upregulates key genes of lipid biosynthesis by regulating and cooperating 
with SREBP1. In vivo expression analysis in thyroid and breast cancer patients 
confirmed that lipid metabolism and SREBF1 expression are associated with 
increased metastatic potential and clinical aggressiveness. These findings 
emphasize the RUNX2 role in cancer plasticity and indicate metabolic adaptation 
as an integral part of the trans-differentiation program induced by this TF 
during cancer progression.

The immune system plays a central role in anticancer defense by coordinating 
antitumor responses that inhibit the initiation, progression, and metastasis of 
malignancies. Emerging evidence underscores the crucial interplay between 
regulated cell death (RCD) pathways and immune activation, particularly 
immunogenic cell death (ICD). ICD refers to a specific form of regulated cell 
death in which tumor cells undergo death and release damage-associated molecular 
patterns (DAMPs) and other signaling molecules, thereby reshaping the tumor 
immune microenvironment (TIME). While the canonical RCD pathways are 
well-established, the inducers of ICD, the spatiotemporal regulation of TIME 
dynamics, and the functional states of immune cells remain incompletely 
understood. We thoroughly evaluated contemporary therapeutic approaches that 
exploit the mechanisms of RCD-driven immunomodulatory effects, including 
strategies to potentiate ICD and amplify antitumor immune responses. The novelty 
of this review lies in its dual perspective: delineating how tumor-intrinsic 
death programs reprogram the tumor TIME and how immune-cell death directly 
dictates its polarization toward immunostimulatory versus immunosuppressive 
states, ultimately shaping therapeutic outcomes. We analyzed in depth how 
different forms of RCD shape antigen presentation, guide immune cell 
infiltration, and affect checkpoint signaling, underscoring their dual potential 
to support or hinder antitumor responses. Furthermore, we summarized the current 
landscape of ICD-inducing interventions, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, 
oncolytic viruses, tumor vaccines, and nanotechnology-based platforms, 
underscoring their potential to convert immunologically ""cold"" tumors into ""hot"" 
ones and to synergize with immune checkpoint blockade. In addition, we 
highlighted promising combination strategies aimed at directly modulating immune 
cell death pathways to sustain effector cell function and overcome exhaustion, 
offering novel insights for the development of next-generation precision 
immunotherapies. By delineating the crosstalk between tumor/immune cell death 
pathways, this study provides a roadmap for developing precise immunotherapies 
that exploit RCD-TIME interactions to overcome treatment resistance.

BACKGROUND: Pathologic T4 colorectal cancer (CRC) carries a high risk of 
peritoneal recurrence despite curative resection. Early postoperative 
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) may enhance intraperitoneal 
cytotoxic exposure and improve recurrence control. We evaluated whether 
prophylactic HIPEC administered within one week of surgery improves outcomes in 
pathologic T4 (pT4) CRC.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study of consecutive 
patients with pathologically confirmed pT4 colorectal adenocarcinoma 
(2018-2022). Prophylactic HIPEC consisted of intraperitoneal 5-fluorouracil 
(650 mg/m2) perfused for 60 min at 43.0 ± 0.1 °C within one postoperative week. 
A 1:2 propensity score match yielded a balanced cohort (99 HIPEC; 198 
non-HIPEC). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS); secondary 
endpoints included overall survival (OS) and site-specific recurrence. 
Robustness of findings was examined with sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Among 690 screened patients, 471 were eligible (155 HIPEC; 316 
non-HIPEC). In the matched cohort, Kaplan-Meier comparisons were not 
statistically significant for DFS (log-rank p = 0.074) or OS (p = 0.460). In 
multivariable Cox models, HIPEC was associated with improved DFS (hazard ratio 
[HR] = 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-0.88; p = 0.012) but not OS 
(HR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.41-1.24; p = 0.237). Peritoneal, hepatic, and pulmonary 
recurrence rates were comparable between groups, while other-site recurrence was 
lower with HIPEC (5.1% in HIPEC and 13.1% in non-HIPEC; p = 0.032). Results were 
directionally consistent across sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic HIPEC delivered within one postoperative week was 
associated with improved DFS, without an observed OS advantage over the study 
interval, in patients with pT4 CRC. These data support selective use of early 
postoperative HIPEC as an adjunct to curative resection, with patient counseling 
focused on anticipated gains in recurrence control and the current uncertainty 
regarding long-term survival.

Metastatic colorectal cancer is commonly treated with oxaliplatin. However, 
patients may develop resistance to treatment over time, and currently, there are 
no validated predictive biomarkers for this resistance. A differential analysis 
of the transcriptome and DNA methylome of colorectal cancer cell lines, 
classified by their varying IC50 values for oxaliplatin, revealed that genes 
associated with resistance were enriched for interferon regulatory factor 
pathways. In contrast, sensitive genes showed enrichment for transcription, 
amino acid metabolism, development, and binding motifs of c-MyC:Max, AP1 and 
others. In univariate Cox's proportional hazard model analysis, it was found 
that UBE2H expression is linked to shorter survival time in the TCGA dataset and 
was further validated across five GEO datasets of colorectal cancer. The 
transcription of UBE2H, along with its gene body methylation, and copy number 
variation was found to be higher in resistant cell lines compared to sensitive 
ones. Additionally, UBE2H levels were higher in cancer samples than in control 
samples, while the promoter methylation is lower in cancer samples than in 
control samples. In groups with high UBE2H, there was an increased infiltration 
of eight cell types, including CD8+ T cells and type 2 T helper cells. 
Conversely, only T helper 17 cells showed reduced infiltration. Moreover, UBE2H 
expression was positively correlated with checkpoint inhibitors, CTLA4 and 
PDCD1, along with immune regulatory genes, such as FOXP3, IL10, IGFB1, CD274, 
and LAG3, etc. Analysis of single cell RNA-sequencing data revealed that UBE2H 
expression is elevated in undifferentiated and proliferative cells located at 
the base of intestinal crypts in normal colon tissue. Our findings suggest that 
UBE2H could serve as a resistance marker to oxaliplatin, as it is associated 
with methylation, the presence of proliferative and undifferentiated cancer 
cells, and immune exhaustion. The proposed analytical pipeline may also be 
applicable to other cancers and diseases.

The biological heterogeneity between left- and right-sided colorectal cancer 
(CRC) poses a significant clinical challenge and the underlying regulatory 
mechanisms remain elusive. As an emerging hallmark of cancer, the contribution 
of circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) to this side-specific heterogeneity is 
unclear. By integrating single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses, this 
study shows that tumor cells in right-sided CRC exhibit significantly higher CRD 
scores and identifies the emergence of a NONO-positive tumor-cell subpopulation 
(NONO⁺ TC) as a key molecular feature of this phenotype. Spatial analysis 
further confirms that this NONO⁺ TC forms a tightly co-localized 
microenvironment with fibroblasts in situ. Notably, cell-cell communication 
analyses indicate that NONO expression does not augment the signal-sending 
capacity of tumor cells but instead reprograms them into highly efficient signal 
receivers. These augmented incoming signals predominantly originate from the 
more pro-tumorigenic myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblast (myCAF) 
subtype, indicating that NONO⁺ TC are particularly sensitive to malignant 
stromal inputs. In conclusion, our study delineates the dual role of NONO as 
both a circadian regulator and a pro-tumorigenic signaling hub. By enhancing 
tumor-cell reception of CAF-derived signals, NONO links CRD to the formation of 
NONO⁺ TC niches and a malignant microenvironment in right-sided CRC, providing 
new mechanistic insight into the spatial heterogeneity of tumors.

This study aimed to identify reliable prognostic biomarkers and novel 
therapeutic targets for Luminal A subtype breast cancer, a prevalent subtype 
with unmet needs in overcoming endocrine resistance. Given the rising global 
incidence of breast cancer, high recurrence/drug resistance rates in Luminal A 
patients, and limited research on ferroptosis in this subtype, we analyzed 421 
Luminal A subtype breast cancer samples and 113 adjacent normal tissues from The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Differential expression analysis (log₂|fold 
change|>1, p < 0.05) and univariate Cox regression for overall survival (OS) 
identified 12 ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with 
prognostic value. Using Lasso-Cox regression (10-fold cross-validation to avoid 
overfitting), we further optimized these into a 9-gene prognostic model. 
Univariate and multivariate Cox regression confirmed the model-derived risk 
score as an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR = 3.896, 95% 
CI = 2.195-6.916, p < 0.001) in TCGA. External validation in the Molecular 
Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) cohort (584 
Luminal A samples) demonstrated consistent prognostic performance (log-rank 
p < 0.001), confirming the model's robustness. Functional enrichment analysis 
showed these genes were enriched in ferroptosis-related pathways, including 
""lipid biosynthetic process""(Gene Ontology) and ""FoxO signaling pathway"" (Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes). Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis 
revealed high-risk groups had increased infiltration of immunosuppressive cells 
(mast cells, neutrophils, regulatory T cells) and elevated type II interferon 
response, while low-risk groups had higher type I interferon response. 
Spearman's correlation analysis identified ENPP2 as a key mediator of immune 
escape, with a strong positive correlation with PD-1 (r = 0.46, p = 8.7e-24). 
This 9-gene ferroptosis-related model provides a robust tool for OS prediction 
in Luminal A subtype breast cancer and highlights ENPP2 as a potential target 
for combining ferroptosis inducers with immune checkpoint inhibitors-offering a 
novel strategy for endocrine-resistant patients.

PURPOSE: This research conducts a comparison of Totally Robotic Total 
Gastrectomy (TRTG) and Robot-Assisted Total Gastrectomy (RATG) to evaluate their 
relative outcomes in patients with advanced gastric cancer, providing evidence 
to guide individualized surgical strategy selection.
METHODS: We retrospectively gathered clinical data from patients who underwent 
either TRTG or RATG between January 2015 and December 2021, totaling 204 
participants. After applying Propensity Score Matching (PSM), the matched cohort 
consisted of 118 patients, with 59 individuals in each of the TRTG and RATG 
groups. The study then compared the short-term and long-term outcomes between 
these two groups.
RESULTS: Post-matching, there were no significant baseline differences between 
the groups. Surgery duration and anastomosis duration were both longer in the 
TRTG group than in the RATG group. However, TRTG was associated with 
significantly reduced intraoperative blood loss, shorter times to postoperative 
mobilization, flatus, and eating, decreased hospital stay, smaller incision 
sizes, and lower postoperative stress responses compared to RATG. The RATG group 
harvested a higher number of lymph nodes. No significant differences were 
observed between the two groups regarding postoperative complications, proximal 
and distal margins, nerve invasion, vascular cancer thrombus, postoperative 
drainage output, and hospitalization costs. The three-year overall survival and 
disease-free survival rates were similar between both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: TRTG offers a safer and more advantageous surgical option regarding 
short-term outcomes compared to RATG and may be considered a preferable choice 
for total gastrectomy.

OBJECTIVE: Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common malignancy among women 
worldwide. Despite advances in treatment, chemoresistance and associated 
morbidity remain significant challenges. This study aims to elucidate the role 
of acetate-dependent acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) in ovarian cancer 
progression under hypoxic conditions, identifying its potential as a therapeutic 
target.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry revealed that ACSS2 was overexpressed and 
predominantly localized to the nucleus in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma 
(HGSOC) tissues, with significantly higher H-scores compared to low-grade and 
normal tissues. Functional assays conducted on ovarian cancer cell lines (Skov-3 
and PA-1) demonstrated that ACSS2 inhibition reduced proliferation, colony 
formation, and three-dimensional spheroid growth, with greater sensitivity 
observed under hypoxic conditions. Migration and invasion assays further 
indicated that ACSS2 inhibition significantly impaired cellular motility and 
invasiveness, particularly in hypoxia. Mechanistic studies, including Western 
blotting and RT-qPCR, showed that ACSS2 inhibition modulated the PI3K pathway 
and downregulated Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 2 (HIF-2) levels as well as 
HIF-2-responsive genes expression under hypoxic conditions. These findings 
highlight the role of ACSS2 in metabolic adaptation, tumor progression, and its 
potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in ovarian cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: ACSS2 is a critical regulator of ovarian cancer growth and 
invasiveness under hypoxic stress. Targeting ACSS2 may represent a promising 
therapeutic strategy for managing ovarian cancer. Further studies are warranted 
to explore its clinical potential.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer continues to pose a significant global health burden 
for women, especially in low-resource settings. Although HPV vaccination and 
screening programs are available, public awareness remains limited. Social media 
platforms have become major sources of health information; however, the quality 
of content varies considerably. This study assesses the quality, reliability, 
and dissemination patterns of cervical cancer-related videos on YouTube, 
Bilibili, and TikTok, with a focus on how uploader characteristics influence 
information accuracy.
METHODS: On February 21, 2025, we retrieved the top 100 videos using the keyword 
""cervical cancer"" on YouTube, and its Chinese equivalent """" on Bilibili and 
TikTok. Two independent reviewers evaluated video quality using the Global 
Quality Score (GQS), Video Information and Quality Index (VIQI), modified 
DISCERN (mDISCERN), and Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT). 
Inter-rater agreement was assessed, and statistical analysis was performed using 
non-parametric tests and Spearman correlation.
RESULTS: A total of 84 YouTube videos, 82 Bilibili videos, and 91 TikTok videos 
were included. TikTok videos showed significantly higher user engagement than 
those on other platforms (p<0.001), but scored significantly lower in GQS, VIQI, 
mDISCERN, and PEMAT evaluations (p<0.001). Videos uploaded by professionals 
consistently received higher quality scores than those from non-professionals. 
(p<0.001) Although TikTok had higher uploader activity, its content was largely 
based on personal experiences, lacking scientific rigor and practical guidance. 
The video quality on TikTok and Bilibili is negatively correlated with their 
interactivity.
CONCLUSIONS: The three platforms show distinct differences in how cervical 
cancer-related health information is disseminated. TikTok demonstrates superior 
dissemination and engagement performance, whereas YouTube provides higher 
content quality and credibility. These findings underscore the importance of 
leveraging each platform's strengths to promote evidence-based health 
communication.

BACKGROUND: Small cell lung cancer is the most malignant subtype of lung cancer 
and has a poor prognosis. However, the mechanism is not well understood. The aim 
of this study was to investigate the characteristics of gene mutation in small 
cell lung cancer patients and the differences in HLA-I alleles between small 
cell lung cancer patients and healthy controls, and to explore the effects of 
gene mutations and specific HLA-I alleles on small-cell lung cancer from the 
perspective of immune regulation.
METHODS: Differences in HLA-I allele frequencies between the two groups were 
analyzed in a case-control study. Genetic testing was performed using target 
gene capture and sequencing method. The association between small cell lung 
cancer, HLA-I alleles, and gene mutation was analyzed by statistical methods.
RESULTS: The small cell lung cancer group showed significantly higher 
HLA-A*11:02 (p < 0.001, OR = 4.693, 95%CI = 1.737-12.677), B*40:01 (p = 0.020, 
OR = 1.916, 95%CI = 1.101-3.333), and B*55:02 (p = 0.037, OR = 2.565, 
95%CI = 1.027-6.408) and significantly lower B*44:03 (p = 0.015, OR = 0.196, 
95%CI = 0.046-0.843) and C*06:02 (p = 0.005, OR = 0.369, 95%CI = 0.178-0.765) 
than the control group. Haplotype analysis results showed that 
HLA-A*11:01-B*51:01 (p = 0.044, OR = 3.433, 95%CI = 0.959-12.292), 
A*02:06-C*07:02 (p = 0.005, OR = 11.459, 95%CI = 1.331-98.689), A*11:01-C*07:02 
(p = 0.007, OR = 3.040, 95%CI = 1.311-7.047), and B*46:01-C*01:02 (p = 0.048, 
OR = 2.310, 95%CI = 0.986-5.415) frequencies significantly increased and 
A*02:01-B*13:02 (p = 0.036, OR < 0.001, 95%CI = 0.000-0.918) and B*13:02-C*06:02 
(p = 0.009, OR = 0.108, 95%CI = 0.014-0.810) frequency significantly decreased 
in small cell lung cancer patients. Three-locus haplotype analysis showed that 
the differences between small cell lung cancer patients and controls were not 
statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: HLA-A*11:01, B*40:01, and B*55:02 may be the immune modulators 
associated with susceptibility and HLA-B*44:03 and C*06:02 act as the immune 
modulators associated with resistance of small cell lung cancer. Haplotypes 
HLA-A*11:01-B*51:01, A*02:06-C*07:02, A*11:01-C*07:02, and B*46:01-C*01:02 are 
positively associated with small cell lung cancer. Haplotypes A*02:01-B*13:02 
and B*13:02-C*06:02 are negatively associated with small cell lung cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a prognostic model incorporating 
microRNA-1246 (miR-1246), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1), α1-antitrypsin 
(A1AT), and inflammatory markers for predicting outcomes in early gastric cardia 
cancer after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).
METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 280 patients with early gastric cardia 
cancer who underwent ESD between January 2021 and December 2023. Patients were 
divided into a training set (n = 196) and a validation set (n = 84) at a ratio 
of 7:3. Influencing factors were screened using univariate, Least Absolute 
Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and multivariate logistic regression 
analyses in the training set. A nomogram was constructed, and the predictive 
performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves 
and calibration curves. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the 
clinical value.
RESULTS: The incidence of poor prognosis was comparable between training 
(43.88%) and validation set (34.52%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis 
identified miR-1246, HMGB-1, A1AT, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and 
Helicobacter pylori infection as independent risk factors for poor prognosis 
(All P < 0.05). The nomogram demonstrated acceptable discriminative ability, 
with AUC of 0.789 (95% CI: 0.701-0.877) in the training set and 0.735 (95% CI: 
0.638-0.835) in the validation set. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.625 
and 0.841 for the training set, and 0.481 and 0.786 for the validation set, 
respectively. Calibration curves indicated good agreement between predicted and 
observed probabilities.
CONCLUSION: The proposed prognostic model offers a practical tool for 
individualized risk assessment post-ESD. However, the clinical application 
warrants further validation in large-scale, multi-center prospective studies 
with long-term follow-up.

PURPOSE: Objectives were to develop a machine learning (ML) model based on 
electronic health record (EHR) data to predict the risk of vomiting within a 
96-hour window after admission to the pediatric oncology and hematopoietic cell 
transplant (HCT) services using retrospective data and to evaluate the model 
prospectively in a silent trial.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Admissions between 2018-06-02 to 2024-02-17 
(retrospective) and 2024-05-09 to 2024-08-05 (prospective) to the oncology or 
HCT services were included. Data source was SEDAR, a curated and validated 
approach to deliver EHR data for ML. Prediction time was 08:30 the morning 
following admission. The outcome was any vomiting within 96 h following 
prediction time. We trained models using L2-regularized logistic regression, 
LightGBM and XGBoost. Training cohorts include the target cohort and all 
inpatient admissions.
RESULTS: There were 7,408 admissions in the retrospective phase and 340 
admissions in the prospective silent trial phase. The best-performing model in 
the retrospective phase was the LightGBM model trained on all inpatients. The 
number of features in the final model was 2,859. The 
area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.730 (95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.694-0.765) for the retrospective phase and 0.716 (95% 
CI 0.649-0.784) for the prospective silent trial phase.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that data in the EHR could be used to develop a 
retrospective ML model to predict vomiting among pediatric oncology and HCT 
inpatients. This model retained satisfactory performance in a prospective silent 
trial. Future plans will include deployment into clinical workflows and 
determining if the model improves vomiting control.

BACKGROUND: Patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and cancer are at 
exceptionally high risk for recurrent thromboembolism (RTE), which includes 
venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial thromboembolism (ATE). Yet 
contemporary data from Chinese patients remain scarce.
METHODS: In this retrospective, observational study conducted at Tianjin First 
Central Hospital (June 2023-December 2024), consecutive adults with AIS and 
cancer were enrolled. The primary outcomes during 6 months follow-up were 
recurrent VTE།composite VTE (symptomatic and incidental VTE requiring 
treatment), recurrent stroke [cerebral infarction, transient ischemic attack 
(TIA), and systemic embolism (SE)], and bleeding (major bleeding and clinically 
significant non-major bleeding). Multivariable logistic regression was used to 
identify independent predictors of each endpoint.
RESULTS: Among 218 eligible patients, 49 (22.5%) had baseline VTE, of whom 45 
(91.8%) were asymptomatic. Baseline VTE was independently predicted by 
cryptogenic stroke subtype (OR 2.70; 95% CI 1.101-6.621; P = 0.030) and 
D-dimer > 1.2 µg/mL (OR 3.619; 95% CI 1.505-8.703; P = 0.004). During follow-up, 
25 patients (11.5%) experienced composite VTE, 71 patients (32.6%) experienced 
recurrent stroke, and 21 patients (9.6%) experienced bleeding. Multivariable 
analysis revealed that D-dimer > 1.2 µg/mL independently predicted recurrent VTE 
(OR 3.501; 95% CI 1.012-12.112; P = 0.048), whereas cancer metastasis portended 
recurrent stroke (OR 3.155; 95% CI 1.423-6.995; P = 0.005), and anticoagulant 
therapy was associated with an increased bleeding risk (OR 9.458; 95% CI 
1.158-77.267; P = 0.036).
CONCLUSIONS: In this Chinese cohort of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) 
and cancer, routine screening revealed venous thromboembolism (VTE) in roughly 
one-fifth of participants at baseline, most of whom were asymptomatic. 
Exploratory multivariable analyses indicated that cryptogenic stroke subtype and 
D-dimer > 1.2 µg/mL were associated with prevalent VTE, while 
D-dimer > 1.2 µg/mL also predicted recurrent VTE. These findings suggested that 
D-dimer guided VTE screening might be considered at the time of stroke 
presentation, even in the absence of symptoms. Cancer metastasis showed an 
association with recurrent stroke, whereas anticoagulant therapy was linked to a 
higher bleeding risk.

INTRODUCTION: Magnesium homeostasis is critical for cellular growth and 
metabolism, yet its pan-cancer implications remain poorly characterized. This 
study aims to comprehensively analyze magnesium homeostasis across 33 cancer 
types, exploring its role in tumorigenesis, immune regulation, and therapeutic 
potential. Key magnesium homeostasis-related genes (e.g., ANK3, CNNM2) were 
significantly downregulated in most tumors, correlating with improved prognosis. 
Magnesium homeostasis scores (MHS) were reduced in cancers and linked to lower 
tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), immune 
dysfunction, and checkpoint gene expression. Single-cell sequencing revealed 
elevated MHS in CD8 + T cells, suggesting immune modulation roles.
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight magnesium homeostasis as a regulator of 
tumor progression and immunity, with MHS serving as a prognostic biomarker. 
Targeting magnesium pathways may offer novel therapeutic strategies, warranting 
further clinical validation to advance personalized cancer therapies.

BACKGROUND: The number of risk prediction models for lymph node metastasis in 
early gastric cancer is increasing, but the quality and applicability of these 
models in clinical practice and future research remain unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review studies published on prediction models for 
the risk of lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer patients.
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.
METHODS: A search was conducted in databases. Data from selected studies were 
extracted, including study design, data sources, outcome definitions, sample 
size, predictive factors, model development, and performance indicators. The 
risk of bias in prediction models was assessed using the Prediction model Risk 
Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) checklist.
RESULTS: Fifty articles were included in this meta-analysis. Most studies used 
Logistic Regression (LR) to establish risk prediction models. The training 
model's overall c-statistic was 0.85 (95% CI (0.81-0.89)), whereas the 
validation model's overall c-statistic was 0.82 (95% CI (0.80-0.83)). The 
overall pooled accuracy rate for the training group model was 0.80 [95% CI 
(0.72-0.87)], and the overall accuracy rate for model validation was 0.71 [95% 
CI (0.61-0.79)]. Tumor size was the most common risk predictive factor. All 
studies had a high risk of bias, primarily due to inappropriate data sources.
CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the PROBAST analysis, it was determined that 
all of the studies were highly biased. Models with bigger samples, more 
stringent research methods, inclusion of multicenter samples, and external 
validations should be the focus of future studies.

PURPOSE: To explore feasibility of using a Nurse Cancer Care Coordinator (CCC) 
to synthesize cancer survivorship care data, assess degree of cancer-related 
distress, and coordinate care for American Indian (AI) patients seen in a tribal 
primary care clinic.
METHODS: A CCC from one of Choctaw Nation's primary care facility collected data 
on American Indian adults who had completed cancer treatment within the 
preceding five-years. Measures included demographics, cancer type, treatment and 
potential adverse effects, schedule of follow-up visits, behavioral risk 
assessment, global distress and checklist of distress sources, and length of 
time and frequency of attempts to complete data collection.
RESULTS: None of the participants had ever received a survivorship care plan 
(SCP). A total of 15 oncology providers were contacted to gather SCP and 
Distress Thermometer (DT) information on the 23 participants. Time to complete 
the SCP ranged from 30 to 120 min, with an average of 62 min per participant. 
The baseline DT score was 4.4 out of 10 and the average number of problems 
reported was 5.0. The top five challenges experienced by participants were 
fatigue (57%), pain (57%), worry (48%), tingling in hands/feet (33%), and sleep 
(33%).
CONCLUSIONS: A Nurse CCC embedded within a tribal clinic organized clinically 
relevant survivorship care information, but this was a labor-intensive 
undertaking. Further work is needed to determine if risk stratification could be 
used to identify subsets of patients who would most benefit from this 
intervention.

OBJECTIVE: Regular screening can reduce the burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) 
and general practice involvement has been demonstrated to improve screening 
uptake and CRC outcomes. Our study explores Australian general practice 
stakeholders' current involvement in supporting organised CRC screening through 
the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) and their views of the 
feasibility and applicability of evidence-based intervention components.
METHODS: A qualitative study was undertaken using focus groups (n = 12) with 45 
participants that included General Practitioners (GPs), practice nurses, 
practice staff and program support staff from across Australia. The Consolidated 
Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used as a guiding framework for 
deductive thematic content analysis.
RESULTS: The findings indicated that proactive GP involvement in the NBCSP is 
challenged by clinical information system limitations, time constraints, and 
competing priorities. Participants expressed a willingness to support CRC 
screening activities, understood the effectiveness of screening, but placed 
little focus on using the NBCSP as the primary method of CRC screening. An 
intervention to increase NBCSP participation involving a risk assessment tool, 
electronic reminder prompt, clinical information system and workflow 
enhancement, and education was viewed as feasible and applicable to practice if 
identified implementation challenges in the inner setting and individuals CFIR 
domains were addressed.
CONCLUSIONS: General practice stakeholders acknowledge their potential for a 
more enhanced role in supporting the NBCSP and contributing to reducing the 
impact of CRC. A multi-component general practice-led intervention to promote an 
enhanced role was perceived as acceptable. To improve feasibility and 
applicability, the intervention needs to be integrated, straightforward, 
time-efficient, and supported by incentives and a whole-of-practice approach.

BACKGROUND: Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes are essential for drug metabolism, 
xenobiotic detoxification, and procarcinogen activation, playing a pivotal role 
in both normal physiology and cancer biology. Their expression varies 
significantly across tissues and tumour types, reflecting the metabolic 
heterogeneity of cancers. Understanding these variations is critical for 
developing targeted therapies, optimizing drug efficacy, and minimizing 
toxicity. This study aimed to comprehensively profile CYP450 expression across 
colorectal cancer (CRC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), breast 
cancer, and hepatic cancer models using proteomic techniques.
METHODS: We analysed various cancer models (cell lines, xenografts, and patient 
tissue biopsies) using gel electrophoresis coupled with liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GEL-LC-MS). Equal amounts of protein were 
separated by gel electrophoresis, and the 45-65 kDa molecular weight range was 
analysed on the Orbitrap Fusion Mass Spectrometer.
RESULTS: Distinct CYP450 expression profiles were observed across cancer types. 
In CRC, CYP2W1 and CYP2S1 were highly expressed, while CYP1B1 and CYP2W1 were 
prominent in HNSCC, highlighting their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic 
targets. Breast cancer models predominantly expressed CYP2J2 and CYP2S1, whereas 
CYP3A and CYP2C subfamily members were enriched in hepatic cancer, underscoring 
their roles in xenobiotic metabolism and drug clearance.
CONCLUSION: This study provides the first comprehensive semi-quantitative 
proteomic map of CYP450 isoforms across multiple cancer models. The findings 
reveal metabolic heterogeneity and identify clinically relevant targets, 
offering a foundation for future functional studies and personalized therapeutic 
strategies.

Plant-derived exosome-like nanoparticles (ELNs) are promising bioactive carriers 
with enhanced stability and delivery capacity. This study explores the 
anti-cancer nutraceutical potential of Eutrema japonicum-derived ELNs (EJ-ELNs) 
through immune modulation and tumor suppression. EJ-ELNs were isolated using 
differential ultracentrifugation, tangential flow filtration, and cushioned 
ultracentrifugation, and characterized by transmission electron microscopy and 
nanoparticle tracking analysis. The isolated EJ-ELNs demonstrated excellent 
colloidal stability, maintaining structural integrity under simulated 
gastrointestinal fluid, enzymatic degradation (DNase, RNase, Proteinase K) and 
acidic conditions (pH 2), and diverse storage conditions (25 °C, 4 °C, -80 °C, 
and lyophilization). In vitro, EJ-ELNs promoted dendritic cell (DC) maturation 
by upregulating surface molecules and enhancing the secretion of Th1-polarizing 
cytokine, while suppressing antigen uptake via MAPK and NF-κB pathways. These 
activated DCs facilitated the differentiation of naïve T cells into 
IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells and promoted the activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. 
In vivo, oral administration of EJ-ELNs restored DC function and expanded 
polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells co-expressing CD107a, IFN-γ, IL-2, and 
TNF-α, ultimately leading to significant tumor suppression. Lipidomic and 
metabolomic profiling identified ceramide, Hex1Cer, naringenin, and genistein as 
key immunostimulatory constituents. These findings position EJ-ELNs as a novel 
anti-cancer nutraceutical candidate, offering a promising strategy for immune 
activation and tumor suppression in functional food applications.

Beetroot (Beta vulgaris L.) is a highly nutritious vegetable. While the root is 
the most consumed part, the leaves, often discarded, are rich in nutrients and 
bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds. These compounds have shown 
efficacy against cancer, including colorectal cancer, a leading cause of global 
morbidity and mortality. However, for these compounds to be effective, they must 
remain bioavailable and bioactive after gastrointestinal digestion. This study 
investigated beet leaves' antioxidant capacity and anticancer effects on the 
colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 after in vitro digestion. The digested beet 
leaf sample showed antioxidant capacity through in vitro tests (ORAC, ABTS, and 
DPPH) and also maintained DNA supercoil despite the presence of the oxidizing 
agent. There was a significant reduction in HCT116 cell's proliferation and 
colony formation, with the number and size of colonies decreasing after 
treatment with the digested material. Additionally, the digested material 
reduced the phosphorylation of S6, S6K1 and S6K2 proteins, which are important 
effectors in the mTOR pathway. Isolated apigenin significantly influenced S6 
protein activity, and while it did not reduce the number of colonies, it 
decreased their size. Thus, this study confirms that beet greens retain their 
antioxidant capacity after gastrointestinal digestion and may have potential 
anticancer effects against colorectal cancer.

Epigenetic plasticity and large-scale chromatin remodeling characterize tumor 
evolution and the emergence of subclones resistant to conventional therapies. 
Catalytically inactive class IIa HDACs (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, HDAC9) control the 
targeted recruitment of chromatin remodeling complexes, making them attractive 
therapeutic targets in oncology. In this study, we found that HDAC4 is degraded 
by the proteasome in cancer cells with impaired DNA repair by homologous 
recombination and after oxaliplatin (OXPT) treatment. Genetic screening 
identified FBXW7 as the E3 ligase responsible for HDAC4 degradation. FBXW7 
loss-of-function mutations are frequently found in patients with colorectal 
cancer (CRC) and were found associated with the development of resistance to 
OXPT. Forced degradation of Class IIa HDACs using a PROTAC-based compound 
restored OXPT sensitivity in FBXW7-mutated CRC cells, patient-derived organoids 
(PDOs), and mice. Mechanistically, removal of HDAC4 in FBXW7-mutated CRC treated 
with OXPT recreated an epigenetic state comparable to OXPT-sensitive cells. 
Furthermore, patient profiling based on the epigenetic state of the 
super-enhancers controlled by HDAC4 successfully identified a priori CRC 
patients resistant to platinum. This study supports HDAC4 as a key mediator of 
oxaliplatin resistance in FBXW7-mutated CRC and highlights the remodeling of a 
well-defined super-enhancer repertoire as part of the process of OXPT 
resensitization.

BACKGROUND: Cancers are associated with extensive reorganisation of epigenetic 
patterns, making identification of DNA methylation changes responsible for 
driving cancer development challenging. Here, we present a novel approach, 
integrative methylation mapping, which overcomes this, enabling identification 
of functionally relevant methylation-regulated genes in cancer.
METHODS: Comparison of genome-wide DNA methylation across multiple B-lymphocyte 
derived malignant/normal samples (total n = 995), enabled delineation of changes 
related to normal or cancer cell functions. Chromatin structure profiling 
(SeSAMe) analysis delineated different properties characterising the different 
categories of methylation change and lentiviral based re-expression enabled 
functional assessment of identified candidate genes.
RESULTS: This analysis determined that only 2-3% of DNA methylation changes in 
B-cell cancers are disease driven, with the overwhelming majority driven by 
normal processes, predominantly proliferation. Methylation changes associated 
with specific cancer or normal cell processes exhibited unique patterns of 
sequence context, chromatin structure and associated transcription factors. 
Furthermore, the low level of true disease-specific changes simplifies 
identification of functionally relevant methylation changes, illustrated here by 
identification and functional confirmation of SLC22A15 as a tumour suppressor in 
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.
CONCLUSIONS: This approach leads to a clearer understanding of the role of 
altered DNA methylation in haematological cancer, facilitates identification of 
cancer-relevant DNA methylation targeted genes and novel therapeutic targets.

BACKGROUND: Precision oncology using genotype-matched treatments (GMT) offers 
potential to improve survival in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
(mCRPC).
PATIENT AND METHODS: In the PROMPT study (NCT04746300), reflex tumour testing 
through next-generation sequencing was performed in treatment-naïve or 
first-line mCRPC patients. All patients received a molecular tumour board (MTB) 
recommendation for GMT based on predefined druggable targets (DT). The main 
objective was to identify clinicopathological variables associated with DT.
RESULTS: Analysis included 340 tissue samples from 307 patients, 51% of samples 
were newly biopsied. Valid results were generated in 84% (76% new, 92% archived; 
P < 0.01). DT were identified in 39% of the patients, with PI3K-AKT (26%) and 
Homologous Recombination (HR; 21%) pathways most frequently affected. Metastatic 
tissue, especially from mCRPC setting (P < 0.01), yielded higher GMT 
recommendations than primary tissue (P = 0.03). HR-associated genes were linked 
with shorter ADT-to-CRPC time (OR 3.77, 95%CI 1.62-10.32, P < 0.01). PI3K-AKT 
alterations were associated with metachronous metastatic disease (OR 0.48, 95%CI 
0.26-0.89, P = 0.021) and longer time to CRPC (OR 0.47, 95%CI 0.25-0.87, 
P = 0.017). No distinct variables predicted DT genotypes.
CONCLUSION: Molecular tumour testing should preferably be done on metastatic 
mCRPC tissue. No combination of features could robustly identify druggable 
genotypes; therefore, reflex molecular characterisation should be routine for 
every mCRPC patient.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. The process to 
develop new anti-cancer drugs is long and arduous. Therefore, additional 
strategies for drug development could involve drug repositioning, i.e., 
identifying new uses for already approved medications that have been deemed 
expendable in the oncologic treatment realm. Indeed, there are already drugs 
that have proven that they are extendable into oncology and are now Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) approved for malignancies, though they were initially 
developed for other conditions.
RECENT FINDINGS: These drugs include: all-trans retinoic acid, first approved as 
a topical agent for photo-aging, with dramatic activity in acute promyelocytic 
leukemia (APL); arsenic, a compound known for its use as a homicidal poison with 
remarkable activity in APL; thalidomide, a drug with a scandalous past as it was 
given to pregnant women and resulted in severe fetal limb deformities, which is 
now approved for multiple myeloma; and the antibiotics amoxicillin, 
clarithromycin, and metronidazole, which can result in total regression of MALT 
lymphomas (triggered by Helicobacter pylori infections). There is also a wealth 
of compounds that could be repositioned including, but not limited to 
anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-infectious compounds (anti-bacterial, anti-viral, 
anti-fungal, anti-parasitic agents), autonomic system regulators, and commonly 
used drugs such as statins or metformin, which have anti-cancer properties, 
demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies. With improvement in 
molecular technologies as well as in our understanding of cancer biology, drug 
repositioning may be exploitable for target-defined anti-neoplastic compounds 
that are already in use for non-malignant disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Financial toxicity from cancer treatment is a significant 
barrier to equitable care and an important clinical and public health concern. 
This scoping review examines global patterns in the assessment of financial 
toxicity in cancer care and compiles an inventory of domains and subdomains used 
in existing assessment tools.
RECENT FINDINGS: From 3,343 records screened, 454 studies were included. Most 
were conducted in high-income countries (81.7%, n = 371), with 93.8% focused on 
adult populations. Across 438 quantitative studies, 164 distinct financial 
toxicity questionnaires comprising 1,104 questions were identified. The 
COmprehensive Score for financial Toxicity (COST) was the most frequently used 
tool (40.4%). Only 48.2% of questionnaires had undergone validation in cancer 
populations. The majority of questions addressed material domains (51.3%), 
followed by behavioral (29.9%) and psychosocial (18.8%) aspects. The most common 
subdomains identified were health expenditure within the material domain (9.6%), 
delaying or forgoing healthcare services within the behavioral domain (12.6%), 
and perceived financial burden of healthcare costs within the psychosocial 
domain (12.8%). Findings from 32 qualitative studies aligned with these 
patterns, highlighting healthcare costs and employment loss as key concerns. 
Most studies of financial toxicity in cancer care are conducted among adults in 
high-income countries and measure material domains. Greater attention is needed 
to expand financial toxicity research in low- and middle-income countries and 
among pediatric, adolescent, and caregiver populations.

PURPOSE: Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is a type of cancer with a 
favorable prognosis, but the physical and mental well-being of patients 
following surgery, particularly during the initial treatment period, is often 
overlooked. Gaining insight into patient experiences during this phase can offer 
valuable information for developing programs aimed at promoting health-related 
behaviors among patients. This study aimed to explore the experience of patients 
with differentiated thyroid cancer from the perspectives of healthcare providers 
and patients using symptom management theory (SMT).
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with DTC patients and 
healthcare personnel. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and 
analyzed using content analysis and Colaizzi analysis. The NVivo 20 software was 
used.
RESULTS: The following five themes and associated categories were identified: 
(1) dual nature of psychological symptoms; (2) perception of somatic symptoms; 
(3) the relationship and impact of psychological and physical symptoms; (4) 
active management attempts; and (5) realistic barriers to symptom management.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that DTC patients face complex and fluctuating 
physical and mental symptoms during the initial treatment phase. These symptoms 
interact with each other and significantly reduce the patients' quality of life. 
Although some patients attempt to cope actively, common barriers such as 
insufficient awareness of symptoms, unscientific management methods, and passive 
coping result in poor symptom management outcomes. There is an urgent need to 
establish a systematic symptom management support system.

INTRODUCTION: Relugolix is the only oral androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) 
approved for advanced prostate cancer (PC). Real-world evidence on treatment 
patterns and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses of relugolix, especially 
as a function of race, remain limited. This study assessed these outcomes and 
compared differences between Black and White patients.
METHODS: Veterans Health Administration data were analyzed to identify male 
adults with PC who initiated relugolix between December 2020 and December 2023. 
Adherence to relugolix was assessed for up to 1 year after treatment initiation 
and was compared between races using generalized linear models. Discontinuation 
of relugolix, switching to another ADT, and initiating an add-on PC treatment 
were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses and compared between races using Cox 
regressions. PSA responses during relugolix treatment, including ≥ 50% and ≥ 90% 
decline from baseline and achieving < 0.2 ng/mL, were assessed among ADT-naïve 
patients.
RESULTS: A total of 507 patients were identified (141 Black and 313 White 
patients). During the first 12 months of treatment, both races had > 90% 
adherence to relugolix with no significant differences between them. During 
follow-up (median 10.7 and 12.6 months for Black and White patients, 
respectively), 27.0% Black and 21.1% White patients discontinued relugolix; 9.2% 
Black and 3.8% White patients switched to another ADT; and 11.3% Black and 10.5% 
White patients initiated an add-on PC treatment. Among ADT-naïve patients, 87.2% 
Black and 87.2% White patients achieved PSA decline ≥ 50% from baseline; 69.2% 
and 64.1% achieved ≥ 90% decline; 51.3% and 47.4% achieved PSA < 0.2 ng/mL.
CONCLUSION: Adherence to relugolix was very high during the first year of 
treatment. These data support that in the real world, patients can adhere to 
relugolix with PSA responses on par with clinical trials regardless of race. 
Black patients were more likely to discontinue or switch to another ADT than 
White patients, but the reasons for this require further study.

Cancer treatment affects every area of a patient's life. Currently available 
cancer treatment methods not only increase the chances of survival, but also 
challenge patients to return to their pre-disease lifestyle. This means that a 
patient's functioning both during and after the disease consists not only of 
satisfaction in the spheres of family life and work life, but also sexual 
functioning. The primary objective of the presented study was to assess the 
sexual functioning of female patients, taking the type of treatment, quality of 
life domains and sociodemographic factors into account. The study was conducted 
on 70 women between the ages of 32 and 84 at the Department of Oncology and 
Radiotherapy of the University Clinical Center, and the Department of Obstetrics 
and Gynecology, Gynecologic Oncology and Gynecologic Endocrinology in Gdansk, 
Poland in 2021. The results indicate that patients who experience less 
discomfort and have better ratings of their overall functioning also report 
better ratings of their sexual functioning, and are less likely to report 
irritating complaints. Women treated with radiation therapy report more 
difficulties in functioning than patients who did not receive this treatment.

Conserving mastectomy is widely used due to its cosmetic benefits and the 
possibility of undergoing immediate breast reconstruction. The types of 
incisions vary, and the best method remains a topic of debate. In this study, we 
evaluate the impact of the incision type on complication outcomes. A 
retrospective analysis was conducted, considering all conserving mastectomies 
and dividing them into groups based on the incision type. A total of 290 
patients were enrolled: 34 (11.7%) had a radial incision, 95 (32.8%) transverse 
incision with skin or NAC excision, 48 (16.6%) inframammary fold incision, 39 
(13,4%) omega incision, 37 (12.8%) periareolar incision, and 37 (12.8%) 
Wise-pattern incision. Flap ischemia, NAC necrosis, and skin necrosis had a 
higher incidence rate in patients who underwent the Wise-pattern incision and 
periareolar incision, with relative p values of <0.001, 0.041, and 0.035, 
respectively. Considering only nipple-sparing mastectomies in breast cancer 
patients, overall complications, skin necrosis, and delay in adjuvant treatments 
showed a higher incidence in patients who underwent Wise-pattern incisions. The 
relative p values were 0.001, 0.004, 0.054, and 0.001, respectively. In 
multivariate analysis, inframammary fold incision reduced the risk of nipple 
necrosis, while Wise-pattern incision increased the risk (OR 0.656; 3.611-fold 
and p value were, respectively, 0.026 and 0.038). Wise-pattern incision and 
periareolar incision increase the incidence of complications as nipple areola 
complex (NAC) and skin necrosis but do not affect reconstruction failure. 
Inframammary fold incision reduces the risk of complications. The incision 
should be customized based on the tumor location, biology and extent, breast 
volume, ptosis, type of reconstruction, and risk factors.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a significant global health concern among women. 
Digital health technologies, particularly mobile health (mHealth) with mobile 
devices and apps, have the potential to tackle challenges in breast cancer 
treatment. However, a comprehensive understanding of mHealth applications in 
breast cancer care remains limited.
METHODS: We retrieved 615 articles published between 1991 and 2025 from the Web 
of Science database and performed a bibliometric analysis using CiteSpace 
V6.4.R1. The analysis included a detailed review of publication trends, 
geographic distribution, institutional contributions, authorship patterns, and 
keyword analysis.
RESULTS: The USA was the leading country in terms of publication volume, 
followed by PR China and Australia. Research hotspots included ""breast cancer"", 
""quality of life"", and ""physical activity"". Initially, research focused on 
screening and diagnosis, but it has since shifted towards emerging technologies 
like mobile apps and patient-centered care, including a focus on 
patient-reported outcomes.
CONCLUSION: This analysis reveals the trends, impacts, and future directions of 
mHealth in breast cancer care. It can help researchers identify research gaps 
and guide healthcare providers in implementing mHealth solutions to improve 
patient outcomes.

PURPOSE: To explore the heterogeneous trajectories of subjective cognitive 
function in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, and to identify the 
demographic features and psycho-behavioral trends in different classes.
METHODS: A longitudinal study was conducted from September 2021 to May 2023 
among a total of 282 breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Data were 
collected at: before the first chemotherapy (T0), 1 month (T1), 3 months (T2), 
6 months (T3), and 9 months (T4) after the first chemotherapy. Latent class 
growth model (LCGM) was applied to identify heterogeneous trajectories of 
subjective cognitive function. Multiple logistic regression was used to explore 
the related factors of different classes. Generalized estimated equation (GEE) 
was employed to explore the trends of psycho-behavioral modes among 
participants.
RESULTS: Four heterogeneous trajectories were identified: the ""no impairment 
class"" (n = 158, 55.8%), the ""impair-recover class"" (n = 64, 22.9%), the 
""delayed recovery class"" (n = 48, 17.2%), and the ""persistent impaired class"" 
(n = 12, 4.1%). These four classes exhibited a distinct trend of subjective 
cognitive function from T0 to T4. Compared to the ""no impairment class,"" the 
""impair-recover class"" had older age (OR = 1.278, padj = 0.015), postmenopausal 
(OR = 0.085, padjusted = 0.006), higher anxiety (OR = 2.157, padjusted < 0.001), 
and depression (OR = 3.057, padjusted < 0.001); the ""delayed recovery class"" 
showed older age (OR = 2.060, padjusted < 0.001), postmenopausal (OR = 0.009, 
padjusted < 0.001), > 4 weeks of chemotherapy (OR = 0.202, padjusted = 0.036), 
receiving ACP regimen (OR = 3.182, padjusted < 0.009), higher anxiety 
(OR = 3.200, padjusted < 0.001), depression (OR = 4.837, padjusted < 0.001), and 
cancer-related fatigue (OR = 1.173, padjusted = 0.033); and the ""persistent 
impaired class"" exhibited older age (OR = 3.060, padjusted < 0.001), higher 
depression (OR = 3.293, padjusted = 0.003), greater fatigue (OR = 1.301, 
padjusted = 0.009), and lower daily activities (OR = 0.993, padjusted = 0.021). 
The psycho-behavioral pattern differed among these classes.
CONCLUSION: This study provides insights into the heterogeneous trajectories of 
subjective cognitive function in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy 
and highlights the importance of considering demographic and psycho-behavioral 
factors in identifying and managing chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
Lutetium-177/Actinium-225 prostate-specific membrane antigen tandem radioligand 
therapy ([177Lu]Lu/[225Ac]Ac-PSMA tandem RLT) and to explore clinical and 
imaging-based predictors of treatment response to support individualized patient 
selection.
METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study included 23 patients with mCRPC 
who underwent Fluor-18 ([18F]F)-PSMA-1007 positron emission tomography/computed 
tomography (PET/CT) and subsequent tandem RLT. Whole-body tumor segmentation on 
PET/CT and standard laboratory values were acquired before treatment initiation. 
Primary endpoint was partial response (PR), defined as either a decline in 
prostate specific antigen of ≥ 50% (according to prostate cancer clinical trial 
working group) or PET-based response according to Response Evaluation Criteria 
on PSMA PET/CT. Safety assessment included renal and hematological side effects 
following common terminology criteria of adverse events version 5.
RESULTS: Following two cycles of tandem RLT, 11 patients (48%) achieved a PR. 
The treatment was generally tolerated well. Grade 3 events included renal 
impairment in two (9%) and grade 3 anemia in five (22%) patients, while no Grade 
4/5 events occurred. Patients with increased PSMA expression on pretherapeutic 
PET (defined by the average mean standardized uptake value of all tumor lesions 
[SUVmean]) had a higher response rate (86%; 6 out of 7) compared to those with 
decreased SUVmean (31%; 5 out of 16). In Cox regression analysis, SUVmean was 
significantly associated with PR with a hazard ratio of 1.34 (95% CI, 1.01-1.77; 
P = 0.042). PSMA-tumor volume (P = 0.036) and total lesion-PSMA (P = 0.041) were 
also significant predictors, whereas none of the clinical parameters showed 
predictive value. Kaplan-Meier analysis further confirmed SUVmean as the 
strongest PR (P = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: [177Lu]Lu/[225Ac]Ac-PSMA tandem RLT may offer a safe, effective 
treatment option. Assessment of PSMA expression on pretherapeutic PET predicts 
response, supporting its use in guiding personalized treatment.

The diagnostic performance of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA SPECT/CT is contingent upon the 
individual attributes of the patients' prostate cancer. The aim of the study was 
to analyse these relationships in order to suggest thresholds that may guide 
diagnostic decision-making regarding the appropriate use of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA 
SPECT/CT imaging.  METHODS: A total of 143 patients with recurrent prostate 
cancer were treated with 664.0 ± 43.9 MBq of [99mTc]Tc-MIP-1404 and imaged by 
SPECT/CT. Comparisons with PSA serum level, ISUP grade, PSA doubling time and 
PSA velocity were performed. It was ensured that a familywise error rate of α 
was maintained in multiple-group comparisons.  RESULTS: Stratifying patients by 
ISUP grade revealed distinct PSA-dependent detection profiles. For patients with 
ISUP grade 1-3, the PSA-dependent detection rates at PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/ml, 
> 0.2-0.5 ng/ml,> 0.5-1.0 ng/ml, > 1.0-2.0 ng/ml,> 2.0-5.0 ng/ml and > 5.0 ng/ml 
were 15%, 25%, 50%, 60%, 60% and 94%, respectively. For patients with ISUP grade 
4-5, these were 29%, 75%, 83%, 86%, 90%, and 100%. PSA velocity did not result 
in a sharper risk stratification for using [99mTc]Tc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT.  
CONCLUSIONS: [99mTc]Tc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT is a valuable diagnostic option for 
patients with recurrent prostate cancer and ISUP grades 4-5 at PSA >0.2 ng/ml or 
PSA-DT ≤ 12 months and ISUP grades 1-3 at PSA > 0.5 ng/ml or PSA-DT ≤ 6.0 
months. If PSMA PET/CT is available, it should be preferred at ISUP grade 1 or 
PSA < 0.2 ng/ml.

PURPOSE OF THE REPORT: Metastatic triple negative breast cancer (mTNBC) is 
aggressive with drug-resistance. Evaluating new markers is an unmet need. 
Anhydrase carbonic-IX (CA-IX), a hypoxia-mediated breast tumor growth regulator, 
is important for maintaining BC stem cells within a hypoxic region. This pilot 
prospective study ""OPALESCENCE"" assessed [89Zr]Zr-DFO-89Zr-girentuximab 
(TLX250-CDx) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), in 
comparison with [18F]F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) PET/CT in mTNBC patients 
(NCT04758780).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients underwent FDG and TLX250-CDx PET/CT and 
conventional imaging (CI) if needed. Intravenous administration of 37±10% MBq 
TLX250-CDx was performed, The PET/CT was acquired at Day 3 or 5 post injection. 
Gold standard composite was based on FDG PET/CT, CI and follow-up. Tumor 
standard uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean) were measured, and tumor burden 
analyzed using total tumor volume (TTV). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was 
performed with a Bond RX (Leica) fully automated research stainer with CA-IX 
antibody (clone EP161).
RESULTS: Twelve mTNBC patients were included. Of 273 lesions confirmed with the 
gold standard, 231 were detected by TLX250-CDx and 264 by FDG PET/CT. Overall 
sensitivity of TLX250-CDx PET/CT was 87.5% with 100% sensitivity for breast, 
skin, and adrenal gland, and 88.0% and 91.9% for node and bone lesions 
respectively. In contrast to FDG PET/CT, TLX250-CDx PET/CT revealed brain 
metastases. Tumor burden evaluated with TTV was equivalent between both PET/CT 
methods. For 7/12 patients, IHC analyses showed CA-IX expression lesions from 
100% to 10% with an intensity from 3+ to 2+. No safety issue was reported after 
TLX250-CDx injection.
CONCLUSION: [89Zr]Zr-girentuximab PET/CT is a sensitive imaging method and 
offers promise for novel theranostics for mTNBC patients.

PURPOSE: Cancer pain is often undertreated, with patients frequently referred 
late to specialist services. This study aimed to develop expert-led 
recommendations to address unmet needs in the management of persistent severe 
cancer pain in Europe.
METHODS: An online questionnaire on cancer pain management was used to identify 
controversies in the clinical practice of European oncologists. A series of 
recommendations to address these controversies was then proposed and validated, 
using a Delphi-like methodology, by a joint expert panel of pain specialists and 
oncologists.
RESULTS: Consensus was reached on 13 recommendations. Key agreements focused on 
the following: (i) collaboration: establishing cancer pain committees (87% 
agreement) and shared protocols (100%), (i) education: implementing telematic 
consultations (100%) and training sessions for oncologists (100%) and (iii) 
referral: establishing clear referral criteria (100%) for patients with poor 
quality of life (QoL) (100%) or persistent pain, regardless of aetiology 
(87-100%), to ensure timely access to specialist care.
CONCLUSION: Effective cancer pain management necessitates enhanced collaboration 
between specialties, targeted education for oncologists, and locally co-created 
protocols with clear referral criteria. These measures are essential to ensure 
that patients are referred to pain specialists in a timely and appropriate 
manner, which is crucial for improving their QoL.

PURPOSE: Given the toxicity of radiation treatment for head and neck cancers, 
prehabilitation occurring between the time of diagnosis and treatment can 
improve patient health and reduce future morbidity. We developed a 
prehabilitation class to improve patient preparedness in reducing and managing 
acute radiation side effects. The study also aimed to improve patient knowledge 
of availability and access to support services offered at our institution.
METHODS: We included head and neck cancer patients that underwent radical 
radiotherapy at our institution. The prehabilitation class was an interactive, 
multi-disciplinary virtual format focusing on patients' nutritional needs, 
symptom management, exercise, and psychosocial support. Patients were invited to 
fill out a survey at their 4-6-week post-treatment follow-up appointment. 
Descriptive statistics were used to determine differences in survey responses 
between the groups, and qualitative responses were analyzed.
RESULTS: From 2020 to 2024, we surveyed 51 patients prior to implementation of a 
prehabilitation class (control group, n = 51) and 51 patients who attended the 
class (prehab group, n = 51). In both groups, patients reported a high level of 
preparedness in managing common radiation side effects. Qualitative responses 
indicated patient praise for the multidisciplinary team and available resources. 
Respondents highlighted the need for more patient education on dysgeusia and 
xerostomia.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of implementing a 
prehabilitation class for head and neck cancer patients. Patient responses 
highlight gratitude for the care received and the need for more focus on 
specific side effects. This data continues to inform changes in the ongoing 
prehabilitation classes.

Immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective in treating 
several advanced cancers, but these treatments have had limited success in 
metastatic ovarian cancer. Here we engineered liposomal nanoparticles carrying a 
poly-ʟ-arginine/poly-ʟ-glutamate coating that promotes their binding and 
retention on the surface of ovarian cancer cells. Covalent anchoring of the 
potent immunostimulatory cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) to phospholipid 
headgroups of the liposome core enabled the polymer-coated particles to 
concentrate IL-12 in disseminated ovarian cancer tumours following 
intraperitoneal administration. Shedding of the layer-by-layer coating and 
serum-protein-mediated extraction of IL-12-conjugated lipids from the liposomal 
core over time enabled IL-12 to disseminate in the tumour bed following rapid 
nanoparticle localization in tumour nodules. Optimized IL-12-polymer-coated 
nanoparticles promoted robust T cell accumulation in ascites and tumours in 
mouse models, extending survival compared with free IL-12 and sensitizing 
tumours to immune checkpoint inhibitors, eliciting strong immune responses and 
immune memory. Overall, these findings support the potential of these 
polymer-coated nanoparticles for the sustained delivery of IL-12 to disseminated 
metastatic ovarian cancer.

The high interfacial energy of nanomaterials limits their certain biomedical 
applications that require stealthiness to minimize non-specific interaction with 
biological components. While steric repulsion-based entropic stabilization-such 
as PEGylation-has long been the dominant strategy for designing stealth 
nanomaterials, its inherent softness and susceptibility to dynamic deformation 
and external forces often result in only moderate stealth performance. Here we 
report a distinct approach to achieving stealthiness by harnessing an ion-pair 
network, rather than maximizing steric repulsion. Using model polyion complex 
nanoparticles composed of equimolar charge ratios of polycations and polyanions, 
we demonstrate that increasing crosslinks between the constituent polyions 
beyond a critical threshold effectively reduces protein adsorption and 
macrophage uptake, enabling prolonged circulation with a half-life exceeding 
100 hours. Building on this, we develop an asparaginase-loaded vesicular 
nanoreactor enveloped by a semi-permeable ion-pair network sheath for asparagine 
starvation therapy. The extended circulation of these nanoreactors enables 
sustained depletion of asparagine, leading to improved therapeutic outcomes for 
metastatic breast and pancreatic cancers. Our findings open an avenue for 
improving the pharmacokinetics of nanomaterials for therapeutic delivery through 
delicately engineering stable intermolecular structures with holistic 
cooperativity.

To address the issue of reliable cancer screening, this study proposes a novel 
approach to select key features in conjunction with a stacking classifier. It 
reduces the number of features required while maintaining the same diagnostic 
accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields 
superior performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, precision, specificity, 
and AUC on each benchmark dataset. This stacked model, built from Logistic 
Regression, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree and a Multilayer Perceptron as 
meta-classifier, achieves 100% accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC using 
the selected optimal feature subsets. The findings confirm that intelligent 
feature selection helps models perform better and is easier to use in 
identification of cancer.

MYC overexpression is a well-established cancer vulnerability, yet direct 
therapeutic targeting of Myc remains a challenge. Here, we identify DL78 as a 
potent antimitotic agent with selective anticancer activity through its 
regulation of Myc. DL78 demonstrated broad efficacy by inhibiting growth across 
nine cancer types and significantly reducing tumor burden in an in vivo model of 
platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer, with no overt toxicity. 
DL78 preferentially targets chromosomally unstable, MYC-overexpressing cancer 
cells, a hallmark of high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Mechanistically, DL78 
exploits Myc's role in mitotic entry by disrupting its interaction with 
α-tubulin, leading to sustained mitotic arrest, mitotic catastrophe, and 
apoptosis while sparing nonmalignant cells. This study establishes a novel 
paradigm for Myc-targeted therapy by introducing DL78, which induces 
cancer-selective mitotic catastrophe by disrupting Myc's interaction with 
α-tubulin rather than its transcriptional activity.

Immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment (TME) profoundly inhibits 
anti-tumor immunity, presenting a formidable challenge in cancer therapeutics. 
Despite this recognized obstacle, multi-targeted immunomodulatory strategies 
remain elusive. Here we developed a novel mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vaccine 
designed to reprogram key cellular mediators of immune suppression within the 
TME, including C-C motif chemokine ligand 22 (CCL22), transforming growth 
factor-β (TGF-β), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), 
Galectin-3, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 
1 (IDO1), and arginase 1 (ARG1). This immunomodulatory vaccine was evaluated in 
a cohort of canines with spontaneous neoplasms, encompassing adrenal, hepatic, 
perianal, vulvar, and pulmonary malignancies. The vaccine demonstrated good 
tolerability, with only mild adverse events (Grade 1 anorexia, chills, and 
fatigue) observed in 25% of subjects (2/8). Remarkably, 75% of treated animals 
(6/8) achieved stable disease, with the median progression-free interval not yet 
reached a median follow-up of 168 days post-treatment initiation. Two dogs 
experienced disease progression. The overall disease control rate was 75%. In 
addition, vaccine administration reversed hematological and biochemical 
abnormalities and alleviated paraneoplastic syndromes associated with these 
malignancies. These findings demonstrate that our mRNA-LNP vaccine effectively 
exerts anti-tumor effects across various cancer types, offering a promising 
strategy for enhancing anti-tumor immunity in both veterinary and human 
oncology.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by its high aggressiveness 
and treatment resistance, with limited therapeutic options and especially a lack 
of effective targeted therapeutic strategies. This study focuses on the role and 
regulatory mechanisms of super enhancer long non-coding RNA (SE-lncRNA) in TNBC. 
Through in-depth analysis of TCGA database, we revealed the specific expression 
pattern of SE-lncRNA in TNBC, and found that downregulation of RP11-54O7.17 was 
significantly correlated with poor prognosis of TNBC patients, which was 
experimentally verified. Both in vitro and in vivo results confirmed that 
RP11-54O7.17 overexpression effectively suppressed the proliferation and 
metastasis of TNBC. Further exploration showed that RP11-54O7.17 directly 
interacted with the S100A4 protein through its conserved L2b-type repeat 
structural fragment, promoted S100A4 binding to HSP70, targeting S100A4 
degradation via the autophagy-lysosome pathway, which in turn blocked the 
activation of S100A4-STAT3 signaling axis. Moreover, RP11-54O7.17 delivered via 
liposome demonstrated significant anti-TNBC efficacy in an in vivo model without 
observing significant systemic toxicity. This study elucidates the regulatory 
role and molecular mechanism of RP11-54O7.17 in TNBC, which provides a strong 
scientific basis and potential therapeutic targets for the development of novel 
SE-lncRNA-based therapeutic strategies.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive form of lung cancer 
associated with a poor prognosis. However, there have been few advancements in 
improving the survival of SCLC patients in recent decades. This study shows that 
the S100A9 protein is highly expressed in SCLC patients and several highly 
aggressive SCLC cell lines. Furthermore, we showed that S100A9 expression 
inversely correlates with overall survival in SCLC patients. S100A9 increases 
the survival and migration of SCLC cells by activating Akt and GSK3α/β/Snail 
pathways. In addition, S100A9 reduces tumor cell autophagy through MAGE-A3. 
S100A9 depletion or pharmacological inhibition using tasquinimod reduced tumor 
growth and metastasis in vivo. Importantly, we observed that S100A9 
downregulation or tasquinimod treatment alone or combined with cisplatin reduces 
the recruitment of MDSCs. Furthermore, tasquinimod treatment alone or combined 
with cisplatin significantly enhanced tumor infiltration of activated CD8+ 
(CD69-positive) T cells. Overall, our results, for the first time, show that 
S100A9 enhances SCLC progression and metastasis by altering the tumor 
microenvironment, and its inhibition using tasquinimod alone or in combination 
with chemotherapy could be developed as a promising therapeutic strategy for 
SCLC.

Blood-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) has the potential to 
simultaneously screen for multiple deadly cancers with high positive predictive 
value. To assess real-world performance, we evaluated the Galleri® MCED test 
(GRAIL, Inc.) across 111,080 individuals (median age 58 years, 55.5% males). 
This MCED test analyzes methylation patterns of cell-free DNA to detect presence 
of a cancer signal and predict the anatomical cancer signal origin (CSO) to 
facilitate diagnostic evaluation. Cancer signal detection rate was 0.91% 
(1011/111,080), consistent with clinical studies and independent modeled values. 
Providers reported clinical outcome for 459 of 1011 individuals with cancer 
signal detected MCED tests. Of these, 258 had an invasive cancer diagnosis, 
spanning 32 cancer types. The MCED test correctly predicted the CSO in 87% of 
cases with a reported cancer type, consistent with previous clinical studies. 
CSO enabled efficient workup in most patients, with a median 39.5 days from 
result receipt to cancer diagnosis.

Adolescent and early young adult (AeYA) cancer survivors (aged 15-25 years) face 
elevated risks of depression following remission. Emerging evidence suggests 
that brain metabolic vulnerability, detectable via 18-F FDG PET/CT, may serve as 
a sentinel biomarker for latent depression risk. To investigate this hypothesis, 
we conducted a multicenter longitudinal study in two independent cohorts 
(n = 923 discovery, n = 518 validation) in which participants underwent 
sequential PET/CT scans and were followed for 3 years (mean follow-up: 
29.58 ± 10.01 months). Reduced SUVmean values in the ventral prefrontal cortex, 
hippocampus, and amygdala predominantly predicted future depression onset after 
adjusting for clinical, psychosocial, and treatment-related confounders. A 
radiomic nomogram integrating these metabolic parameters demonstrated robust 
predictive accuracy (C-index: 0.91 discovery, 0.88 validation). By identifying 
neurobiological susceptibility years before symptom emergence, this study points 
to 18-F FDG PET/CT as a clinically actionable tool for preemptive depression 
risk stratification in AeYA survivors, thus repurposing 18F-FDG PET/CT from 
tumor management surveillance to preemptive depression risk screening.

Lung cancer is one of the most devastating types of cancer, and the treatment of 
lung cancer has been facing great challenges. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), a 
new type of targeted therapy, have been widely used in cancer therapy and have 
opened up a new perspective for the treatment of lung cancer. Here, using a 
tissue-microarray-based antibody library screening, we identified the FK002 
antibody that specifically binds to the tumor cell membrane across various tumor 
types. We determined that FK002 targets epithelial membrane protein 2 (EMP2), a 
member of the tetraspanin superfamily of proteins. Subsequently, we developed 
the EMP2-directed ADC, FK002-exatecan, with a potent DNA topoisomerase I 
inhibitor (exatecan). In-depth in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown the 
efficacy and specificity of the EMP2-directed ADC. We validated that the 
FK002-exatecan ADC effectively eradicated tumors in various lung cancer cell 
lines and xenograft mouse models, including patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and 
patient-derived tumor-like cell cluster (PTC) models, as well as xenograft 
tumors. Mechanistically, FK002-exatecan specifically bound to EMP2 and was 
internalized into tumor cells, followed by intracellular trafficking to the 
lysosome and exatecan release, which induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. 
This study identifies EMP2 as a novel molecular target for lung cancer therapy 
and establishes a foundation for developing ADCs that selectively eradicate lung 
cancer cells.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the complex dynamics of help-seeking 
behaviors among breast cancer patients in China through developing an 
explanatory theoretical model.
METHODS: A Constructivist Grounded Theory (CGT) approach was employed to 
investigate breast cancer patients' help-seeking behaviors. Data collection 
occurred at a tertiary hospital in Zhejiang, China, from September 2024 to 
February 2025. We used a two-phase CGT design: Phase 1 inductively generated the 
preliminary model from patient interviews; Phase 2 employed theoretical sampling 
with nurses and non-participant observations to test negative cases, triangulate 
covert decision dynamics, and achieve category saturation. Sample size was based 
on theoretical saturation audit checks for coding consistency. Data analysis 
utilized NVivo 12.0 software following Strauss and Corbin's three-level coding 
paradigm.
RESULTS: Analysis generated the Motivate-Response-Feedback Model (MRFM), 
outlining the dynamics of breast cancer help-seeking behavior. Intrinsic 
motivators included cognitive biases, perceived disease severity, and coping 
strategies, whereas extrinsic motivators encompassed cultural stigma, healthcare 
resource allocation, and family responsibilities. Patients' behavioral responses 
manifested as active (multi-source symptom verification, cross-regional 
care-seeking) or passive (delayed consultations, condition concealment). 
Feedback processes were categorized as positive (enhanced social support, 
reduced psychological stress) and negative (economic strain, negative emotional 
states), further influencing subsequent help-seeking behaviors.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a nuanced understanding of the complex 
interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic motivators, behavioral responses, and 
feedback loops shaping breast cancer help-seeking behaviors in China. We propose 
a culture-specific MRFM that explains intention-behavior gaps via dynamic 
feedback loops rather than static determinants. The developed MRFM highlights 
the need for culturally tailored interventions to reduce stigma, improve 
resource allocation, and enhance psychological and social support. Further 
quantitative validation and research exploring the role of digital health 
interventions in facilitating timely help-seeking behaviors are recommended.

The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment imposes significant metabolic 
constraints that impair dendritic cell (DC) maturation and antigen presentation, 
ultimately undermining antitumor immunity. In colorectal cancer (CRC), elevated 
glutamine uptake by tumor cells depletes extracellular glutamine, thereby 
limiting DC functionality and disrupting T cell priming. While glutamine 
antagonists such as JHU083 inhibit tumor metabolism, they are insufficient to 
fully restore DC activity. Here, the development of T26, a bifunctional 
immunometabolic prodrug that links JHU083 with the STING agonist MSA-2 via a 
cleavable amide bond, is reported, enabling synchronized intratumoral release 
and dual targeting of glutamine metabolism and innate immune activation. In 
murine CRC models, T26 restores DC maturation, promotes CD8⁺ T cell activation, 
and reprograms tumor cell-derived extracellular vesicles to enhance antigen 
presentation and immune stimulation. Importantly, T26 significantly inhibits the 
growth and proliferation of CRC patient-derived organoids, underscoring its 
translational potential in human CRC. Notably, T26 also demonstrates strong 
synergy with chemotherapy, immune checkpoint blockade, and anti-angiogenic 
therapy, significantly improving tumor control without inducing systemic 
toxicity. These findings position T26 as a mechanistically integrated and 
translationally promising strategy to overcome glutamine-driven immune 
suppression and enhance immunotherapy efficacy in CRC and other metabolically 
dysregulated malignancies.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the diagnostic 
performance of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) using a dual-layer 
detector scanner in assessing the pathological response of peritoneal metastases 
(PMs) from non-mucinous colorectal cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with PMs from non-mucinous 
colorectal cancer who underwent preoperative DECT using a dual-layer detector 
scanner before cytoreductive surgery were prospectively included. Virtual 
monoenergetic images at 40 keV (VMI40kev), VMIs at 100 keV (VMI100kev), VMI 
slope (VMIslope), iodine concentration (IC), normalized iodine concentration 
with aorta (nICaorta) and liver (nICliver), effective Z atomic number (Zeff), 
and extracellular volume fraction (ECVf) were evaluated on PMs by two 
radiologists. Pathological response of PM was classified using the peritoneal 
regression grading score (PRGS), and classified as either good (complete 
response or major histological regression - PRGS ½) or poor (minor or no 
histological response - PRGS ¾) responses. DECT variables of PMs with good 
responses were compared to those of PMs with poor responses using 
independent-sample t-tests. Receiver operating characteristic curves were built 
to estimate the capabilities of the different DECT variables in differentiating 
between PMs with good responses (PRGS ½) and those with poor responses (PRGS ¾). 
Intra-class correlation coefficients analyses were performed to estimate 
interobserver variability in DECT variable measurements.
RESULTS: Forty-four patients (22 men median age, 62 years; age range: 35-78 
years) with 77 PM were included from September 1st 2023 to July 1st 2025. 
Thirty-nine out of 77 PMs (51 %) exhibited good response (PRGS ½) and 38 PMs (49 
%) exhibited poor response (PRGS ¾). VMI40kev, VMIslope, IC, nICaorta, nICliver, 
ECVf were significantly greater in PRGS ¾ PMs by comparison with PRGS ½ (P < 
0.05). The best AUC values to distinguish between good and poor pathological 
response of PMs were obtained with nICaorta (AUC, 0.74: 95 % confidence interval 
[CI]: 0.63-0.85) and ECVf (AUC, 0.74; 95 % CI: 0.63-0.84). ICC was > 0.8 for 
most DECT variables.
CONCLUSION: DECT using a dual-layer detector scanner provides promising 
biomarkers for predicting pathological response in non-mucinous PM after 
chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The impact of alterations beyond DNA damage 
response-homologous recombination repair (DDR-HRR) genes on outcomes with 
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor monotherapy remains unknown. This study 
aims to explore the impact of genomic features and co-occurring alterations on 
treatment outcomes in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer (mCRPC) and DDR-HRR alterations in TALAPRO-1.
METHODS: TALAPRO-1 evaluated talazoparib monotherapy in heavily pretreated 
patients with mCRPC and DDR-HRR alterations. We used tumor and saliva alteration 
results, and somatic-germline-zygosity prediction to assess genomic alterations.
KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Associations between antitumor activity and gene 
alteration origin, selected non-DDR-HRR gene alteration status, tumor mutational 
burden, and genomic loss of heterozygosity (gLOH) were explored. Objective 
response rates (ORRs) and median overall survival (OS) with 95% confidence 
intervals (Clopper-Pearson method) and p values (two-sided Fisher's exact test) 
were calculated. Commonly altered non-DDR-HRR genes included TMPRSS2, TP53, 
PTEN, androgen receptor (AR), MYC, and SPOP. ORRs were 30.0% and 34.5% in men 
with TP53 and PTEN alterations, respectively, and 28.6% and 26.8% in men without 
TP53 or PTEN alterations, respectively. In tumors bearing ATM alterations, ORR 
was greater in those with (two of four) versus without PTEN alterations (zero of 
13; p = 0.044). ORR was significantly higher for gLOH-high than for gLOH-low 
patients (53.3% vs 12.0%; p = 0.0017). The median OS for gLOH-high patients was 
23.7 mo versus 18.7 mo for gLOH-low patients (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence 
interval 0.52-1.64). Our analyses are retrospective and limited by small 
subgroup sizes.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In men with mCRPC, high gLOH status was 
associated with enhanced responses to talazoparib.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Current guidelines on bladder cancer lack consensus on 
which outcomes should be used to define cure, the optimal time point for 
measurement, and which treatments can be given with curative intent in early 
bladder cancer. Our aim was to determine the optimal definition of cure by 
assessing cure definitions used in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) 
and muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) studies.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review via Embase and Medline on 
July 10, 2024, to identify real-world evidence (RWE) studies published within 
the previous 5 yr reporting key effectiveness outcomes (time to recurrence 
[TTR], overall survival [OS], and recurrence-free survival [RFS]) of NMIBC and 
MIBC treatments.
KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Among 83 publications included in the review, 
median TTR ranged from 10 to 89 mo across seven NMIBC studies, and from 6 to 
19 mo across five MIBC studies. RFS was the first and second most commonly 
reported outcome among the NMIBC and MIBC publications, respectively. OS and RFS 
were commonly reported at 1, 2, and 5 yr among NMIBC studies, and at 3 and 5 yr 
among MIBC studies. Limitations include the use of RWE only, the 5-yr cut-off 
for the publications included, and the scarcity of relevant data.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: According to the evidence reviewed, 5-yr 
RFS appears to be a suitable definition of cure in early bladder cancer. 
Consensus on this or another surrogate outcome for measurement of cure could 
support the development of clinical trial designs and inform decision-making in 
health care from both clinician-patient and reimbursement perspectives.

Inaccurate information about prostate cancer is widespread on online social 
networks in English and Spanish and spans a variety of topics from prevention 
and screening to treatment and survivorship. Clinicians should raise awareness 
that social media can be a source of misinformation about prostate cancer, 
preemptively address prevalent myths, and actively participate in public 
dissemination of evidence-based information.

BACKGROUND: Lymfactin® is a gene-therapy vector encoding vascular endothelial 
growth factor C designed to promote lymphatic vessel growth. It is administered 
during vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) to treat breast cancer-related 
lymphedema. This study presents the final efficacy and long-term safety results 
of the Lymfactin® Phase I trial.
METHODS: Between 2016 and 2018, 12 patients with breast cancer-related 
lymphedema received a therapeutic dose of Lymfactin® injected into the VLNT flap 
with or without autologous breast reconstruction. Patients were followed up 
annually for 4 years.
RESULTS: The mean seven-day swelling volume, defined as the volume change after 
one week of compression interruption, decreased clearly compared to baseline at 
the three-year follow-up: 105.7 ±161.0 ml vs. 14.9 ± 174.2 ml. The total 
lymphedema quality of life (LQOLI) scores improved significantly from baseline 
to the three-year follow-up (p = 0.02). Within the LQOLI subdomains, physical (p 
< 0.01) and psychosocial (p = 0.01) scores showed significant improvement over 3 
years postoperatively. Six of the 12 participants reduced or discontinued 
compression garment use within 3 years postoperatively. This group exhibited 
significantly smaller upper extremity volume differences than those who 
continued regular compression use (317.8 vs. 923.2 ml, p = 0.04). No serious 
adverse events were reported, and all the patients remained alive during the 
four-year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: This prospective multicenter study demonstrated that Lymfactin® with 
VLNT is safe and well tolerated. Although volume reduction was most evident in 
the first year, half of the patients reduced or discontinued compression use, 
and quality of life improved over long-term follow up.

INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of version 2.1 of the 
prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS v2.1) compared to version 
2.0 (PI-RADS v2.0) for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), 
we analyzed a cohort using multiparametric MRI (mpMRI). PI-RADS was developed to 
standardize mpMRI acquisition and interpretation, with version 2.1 introducing 
revisions to the assessment of transition zone (TZ) lesions aimed at improving 
detection of prostate cancer (PCa).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of biopsy-naive men who underwent 
mpMRI between 2018 and 2022. Patients were grouped by interpretation under 
PI-RADS v2.0 or v2.1. The primary outcome was detection of csPCa, defined as 
Grade Group ≥2 on subsequent biopsy. Analyses were performed for the cohort and 
stratified by the region of the index lesion.
RESULTS: Of 1,427 patients, 1,144 (80.2%) underwent mpMRI evaluated under v2.1 
and 283 (19.8%) under v2.0. Compared to v2.0, the v2.1 group had more PI-RADS 5 
lesions (21% vs. 16%) and fewer PI-RADS 1 to 2 lesions (8% vs. 14%) (P = 0.004). 
csPCa detection per patient was higher in the v2.1 group (50% vs. 43%, P = 
0.04), driven by improved detection in the TZ (55.1% vs. 39.3%, P = 0.04). No 
significant difference was seen in the peripheral zone (PZ). Multivariable 
analysis showed higher csPCa detection for TZ lesions with v2.1 (OR: 1.34, 95% 
CI: 1.02-1.76, P = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: PI-RADS v2.1 was associated with csPCa detection in TZ lesions 
compared to v2.0.

PURPOSE: We investigated baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomic 
features for predicting tumor response in patients with locally advanced 
cervical cancer (LACC) at brachytherapy (BT).
METHODS: Seventy-four patients underwent baseline T2W MRI. Gross tumor volume at 
diagnosis (GTV-T initial) was delineated. Tumor radiomic features were extracted 
using TexRAD software. Feature enrichment using parameters indicative of 
response was done using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
regression. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used to generate the 
model. Response to chemo-radiotherapy was based on the criteria GTV-BT/GTV-T 
initial ratio < or >0.20 was used for classifying good versus poor responders.
RESULTS: Fifty-six radiomic features were extracted. LASSO enriched the number 
of features to 11 for the GTV-BT/GTV-T initial ratio. The SVM classifier with a 
10-fold internal cross-validation demonstrated an AUC of 0.82 and 76.8% accuracy 
when the response was assessed using the GTV-BT/GTV-T initial ratio for response 
evaluation. When SVM was modeled using clinical features, the AUC was 0.55, and 
the accuracy was 62.6% for the GTV-BT/GTV-T initial ratio, CONCLUSION: Machine 
learning model employing radiomic features extracted from pre-treatment MRI 
reliably predicted treatment response in patients with LACC.

OBJECTIVES: Lung cancer may require complex interventions such as pneumonectomy. 
This study investigates late survival after pneumonectomy and assesses the need 
for late rehospitalizations.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 479 consecutive patients with 
lung cancer undergoing pneumonectomy at our institution between 2005 and 2015. 
Survival was assessed at 3, 5, and 8 years and Cox multivariate analysis was 
used to identify independent predictors. The National anonymized medico-economic 
database (PMSI) was used to study early and late (up to 10 years after surgery) 
postpneumonectomy hospital trajectories (excluding routine follow-up visits) of 
patients in the last 2 years of the study period (n = 179).
RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 62.7 ± 9.9 years and 74.9% were men; 
56.18% had FEV1 below 80% of predicted. Stage III accounted for 62.84% of 
patients. Overall survival at 3, 5 and 8 years was 58.9%, 47.6% and 39.6%, 
respectively. Male sex, active tobacco smoking, Charlson Comorbidity Index >5, 
stage III-IV, and occurrence of Clavien Dindo≥3 postoperative complications were 
independent predictors of worse survival. After pneumonectomy, a total of 4845 
hospitalisations were recorded in 179 patients, 886 for postoperative adjuvant 
treatments. Forty-five out of the 179 patients had a late hospitalisation for 
lung cancer recurrence, with an average delay of 23.3 months. There were 25 
readmissions, involving 20/179 patients, for respiratory failure, whereas 15/179 
patients were readmitted for cardiac failure. In addition, 9/179 patients were 
readmitted for a new nonpulmonary cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the strong physiological impact, pneumonectomy has 
satisfactory short and long-term results.

INTRODUCTION: In resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), molecular testing 
is currently limited to EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements, as these guide 
approved adjuvant therapies. The role of next-generation sequencing (NGS), 
routinely used in metastatic NSCLC, remains unclear in earlier stages. The 
prevalence of other driver mutations and their impact on outcomes is not well 
established.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical, molecular, and survival data from 
patients (pts) with stage IA-IIIB NSCLC (AJCC 8th) who underwent surgery and NGS 
at our Institute from January 2020 to December 2023. The primary endpoint was 
the prevalence of driver alterations. Exploratory analyses assessed recurrence, 
disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and correlation with 
mutation status.
RESULTS: Of 221 pts, 216 were eligible. Oncogenic alterations were found in 71% 
(73% in stage I), most commonly KRAS (30%) and EGFR (26%), followed by MET exon 
14 skipping (6%), BRAF (4%), HER2 exon 20 mutations (3%), and ALK and RET 
rearrangements (1%). Alteration distribution differed by sex and smoking status. 
With a median follow-up of 20 months, 36% of pts experienced recurrence, 
including 10 stage I cases. Median time to recurrence was 14 months. Recurrence 
rates were higher in pts with driver mutant NSCLC (39.6%) versus wild-type 
(29.6%). Highest recurrence was seen in pts with oncogenic fusion positive NSCLC 
and EGFR exon 20 insertions.
CONCLUSIONS: Driver mutations were detected in 70% of resected NSCLC, including 
stage I. The recurrence patterns observed support integrating NGS into 
early-stage management and exploring tailored adjuvant therapies, even for stage 
I tumors.

Radiation therapy, a mainstay of management for prostate cancer, may lead to 
variations in rectal volume and subsequent toxicities. This study examines the 
role of bowel preparation compliance and Milk of Magnesia (MoM), on rectal 
diameter, toxicities, and volume variations during image-guided radiotherapy 
(IGRT). Through this, we aim to enhance treatment precision and reduce rectal 
toxicity, improving patient outcomes in pelvic irradiation. This prospective 
observational study, conducted at the Aga Khan University between July 2024 and 
December 2024, included prostate cancer patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy. 
Patients underwent a standardized bowel preparation protocol involving an 
antiflatulence diet and Milk of Magnesia (MoM) in an attempt to reduce rectal 
volume and toxicity, with bladder preparation requiring 500 mL of water intake 
30 minutes before scans. Daily cone beam CT (CBCT) images ensured accurate 
target coverage, and rectal parameters were monitored throughout treatment. Data 
on patient compliance, rectal volume, interfractional motion, and toxicity were 
collected using the Adaptive Radiotherapy Integrated Algorithm (ARIA) system and 
self-designed questionnaires, with statistical analyses, including mixed-model 
logistic regression, assessing the relationship between various factors and 
treatment-related toxicity, defined as significant at p < 0.05. A total of 145 
scans involving 7 prostate cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy were 
analyzed, with a mean patient age of 63.9 years and mean diagnostic serum PSA 
levels of 27.0 ng/ml. Most patients had a Gleason score of 5 and were treated 
primarily with Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT), receiving a radiation 
dose of 7800 cGy over 39 fractions. Compliance with bowel preparation protocols 
and Milk of Magnesia (MoM) was suboptimal (25.5%). Statistical analysis revealed 
a significant association between MoM compliance and reduced rectal toxicity, 
while dietary compliance, although beneficial, did not achieve significance in 
multivariable models. The mean rectal dose during treatment increased 
significantly, while individual variations in rectal diameter and volume were 
observed. This study emphasizes the importance of strict adherence to bowel 
preparation protocols and MoM in mitigating rectal toxicity and improving 
patient outcomes in pelvic irradiation for prostate cancer.

BACKGROUND: Adults aged ≥ 70 years represent approximately half of all patients 
diagnosed with colon cancer, but undertreatment in this population persists. 
Recent guidelines have aimed to reduce age-related biases in the treatment of 
colon cancer. We evaluated the age-related disparities in the receipt of 
curative-intent surgical and medical treatment of colon cancer, and their 
changes over time.
METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study of adult patients diagnosed 
with colon adenocarcinoma between 2010 and 2018 in Alberta, Canada. Surgery 
receipt was assessed in patients with stage I-III disease, while systemic 
therapy receipt was assessed in stage III to IV disease. Patients were 
stratified by age at diagnosis (< 70 and ≥ 70 years). Cox proportional hazard 
models were used to evaluate interactions between age and treatment status, and 
their associations with cancer-specific survival (CSS). Time trends associated 
with treatment receipt were identified with multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: Among the 10,838 patients included, 48% were aged ≥ 70 years. For 
surgery recipients, 5-year CSS was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.88-0.91) and 0.79 (95% CI, 
0.77-0.80) for patients < 70 and patients ≥ 70 years of age respectively. 
Systemic therapy recipients aged < 70 years had a 5-year CSS of 0.57 (95% CI, 
0.55-0.60), while individuals aged ≥ 70 years had a 5-year CSS of 0.51 (95% CI, 
0.49-0.55). The association between treatment receipt and CSS was independent of 
age for both treatment modalities (P = .17). Treatment receipt trends remained 
consistent between 2010 and 2018.
CONCLUSION: Despite evolving practice guidelines and non-age-dependent survival 
benefits, disparities persist in the receipt of treatment for older adults with 
colon adenocarcinoma.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in 
patients with early-stage estrogen receptor (ER)-low/HER2-negative breast cancer 
(BC), a population often overlooked in clinical trials. A systematic review and 
meta-analysis were conducted following preferred reporting items for systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) standards and registered with PROSPERO. 
Comprehensive searches were performed across PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, 
and major oncology conferences for studies with data on neoadjuvant 
chemoimmunotherapy in ER-low BC. The primary endpoint was the pathologic 
complete response (pCR) rate, with a secondary descriptive analysis of safety 
data. Seven studies encompassing 260 patients with ER-low BC were included (3 
cohorts and 4 clinical trials). All studies utilized humanized anti-PD-1 
antibodies, with 4 administering pembrolizumab, 1 using nivolumab, and 1 
employing camrelizumab. The overall pooled pCR rate for ER-low BC was 64.88% 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 56.72%-73.04%; I² = 37.5%). No significant 
differences in pCR rates were identified between clinical trials and cohort 
studies (P = .724). Adverse event data were reported in 2 studies, revealing 
that 34.4% of patients experienced hospitalizations, with notable rates of grade 
≥ 3 adverse events (AEs) and immune-related AEs (irAEs). Neoadjuvant 
chemoimmunotherapy shows high rates of pCR for ER-low BC, resembling 
triple-negative BC, with safety data indicating fewer severe complications than 
observed in pivotal trials.

PURPOSE: Post-traumatic growth (PTG) refers to the positive changes experienced 
after a serious life crisis or traumatic event. However, studies on PTG in 
patients with head and neck cancer in Japan remain limited. Therefore, this 
study aimed to elucidate the characteristics of PTG and its influencing factors 
in Japanese patients with head and neck cancer who underwent surgery.
METHODS: This study was conducted using a cross-sectional research design with 
self-administered questionnaires. The study included 76 adult patients with head 
and neck cancer who were being treated at a university hospital in a regional 
city in Japan, and who had undergone surgery between 6 months and 10 years 
previously. The questionnaire included the Japanese version of the PTGI-J, 
degree of psychological shock, coping strategies, and level of social support. 
Data analysis involved univariate and multivariate analyses, with PTGI-J scores 
as dependent variables.
RESULTS: The average total score on the PTGI-J among patients with postoperative 
head and neck cancer was 50.2 (standard deviation = 17.2). Multiple regression 
analysis indicated that living with children and emotion-focused coping were 
significant predictors of increased PTGI-J scores. Emotion-focused coping showed 
the strongest positive correlation with the PTGI-J total score and all 
subscales.
CONCLUSIONS: Among Japanese patients following head and neck cancer surgery, 
emotion-focused coping and living with family members, particularly children, 
were suggested to play a significant role in promoting PTG.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: As an intervention to promote PTG, it is 
important for nurses and other healthcare staff to provide supportive engagement 
that helps patients express and control their emotions. Furthermore, while 
providing appropriate information, it is necessary to strengthen relationships 
with the child-centered family and primary support system.

hepatitis B virus (HBV) as the leading cause. This study aims to systematically 
evaluate the global epidemiological burden, risk factors, and long-term trends 
of HBV-related liver cancer.
METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2021 were used to 
analyze incidence, deaths, and prevalence rates of HBV-related liver cancer 
across 204 countries and territories. Age-period-cohort (APC) models were 
applied to assess age-specific trends, period effects, and cohort impacts on 
age-standardized disease burden. Pearson correlation analyses examined the 
relationship between liver cancer burden, the socio-demographic index (SDI), and 
the universal health coverage (UHC) index. We also evaluated the influence of 
other concomitant risk factors on HBV-related liver cancer deaths. Projections 
for future death trends were generated using Bayesian APC models.
RESULTS: In 2021, there were 206,366 new cases of HBV-related liver cancer and 
181,194 deaths worldwide. Between 1990 and 2021, both the global 
age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized prevalence rate 
(ASPR) showed an upward trend. The age-standardized death rate (ASDR) declined, 
particularly in middle SDI countries, where the ASDR dropped by 21.7%. Incidence 
rates decreased among individuals under 70 years old, while death rates dropped 
for those under 75 years. Period trends revealed an increase in incidence and 
deaths from 1995 to 2000, followed by a sharp decline from 2000 to 2010, with 
death reductions being more pronounced. The downward trend was most notable 
among birth cohorts from the 1970s onward. A negative correlation was found 
between the SDI, the UHC, and liver cancer burden. The number of deaths 
attributable to risk factors increased by 97.8% from 1990 to 2021. Projections 
indicate a 30.2% reduction in HBV-related liver cancer deaths globally by 2040.
CONCLUSIONS: The global burden of HBV-related liver cancer showed significant 
regional disparities and presented ongoing global health challenges. 
Socioeconomic factors and healthcare access are closely associated with disease 
burden. Effective, region-specific interventions are essential to mitigate 
future HBV-related liver cancer burdens.

Gynecologic cancer treatments often lead to increased sexual concerns, which 
often are not addressed. Screening should be performed in a standardized fashion 
both routinely and frequently. Various treatment options are available and 
should be offered to improve quality of life. Referrals to specialty clinics can 
be made when available.

Cervical cancer continues to represent an immense burden worldwide. Fortunately, 
in all stages of the disease and therapeutic modalities there have been 
significant advances in the past 5 years with the promise of improving oncologic 
outcomes and decreasing morbidity. The introduction of immunotherapy into the 
care of patients with metastatic and recurrent cervical cancer, a disease with a 
historically poor prognosis and limited treatment options, has altered the 
standard of care.

Antibody-drug conjugates are a class of novel antineoplastic drugs that deliver 
potent cytotoxic agents directly into tumor cells by targeting tumor-specific 
antigens. Two of these drugs are currently approved for treatment of gynecologic 
cancers and many more are under investigation. Along with the expected 
toxicities associated with chemotherapy drugs, antibody-drug conjugates can 
cause more atypical adverse events; the treating oncologist should be aware of 
these toxicities and their management.

The use of secondary cytoreductive surgery before standard chemotherapy in 
recurrent ovarian cancer is controversial. Several groups have identified 
patient and disease factors that correlate with benefit from surgery. Complete 
gross resection of disease is the most important factor, and selection criteria 
have been developed and validated to predict this outcome. Recently, 3 parallel 
multicenter randomized controlled trials of secondary cytoreduction were 
reported and have shown mixed results but a meta-analysis suggests a benefit, 
particularly, in those with complete gross resection of disease.

Recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer represents a significant therapeutic 
challenge, characterized by poor responses to standard chemotherapy and limited 
survival outcomes. This chapter comprehensively reviews the biological 
mechanisms underlying platinum resistance, including alterations in DNA repair 
pathways, intracellular drug transport, evasion of apoptosis, tumor 
microenvironment adaptations, and cancer stem cell dynamics. Emerging therapies 
targeting these mechanisms are discussed in detail, along with promising 
strategies that combine these therapies. Clinical trial data are discussed to 
highlight advances in overcoming platinum resistance and the potential for 
biomarker-driven treatment approaches. The chapter emphasizes the importance of 
targeting tumor heterogeneity and resistance mechanisms through novel therapies 
and personalized strategies to improve outcomes in patients with recurrent 
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.

Objectives: The current American Joint Committee on Cancer medullary thyroid 
cancer (MTC) staging system qualitatively stratifies lymph node (LN) status 
based on involved LN compartments; however, American Thyroid Association 
guidelines note that quantitative assessment of LN metastases ""should be 
incorporated."" Several studies have proposed LN ratio (LNR) and number of 
positive LNs as prognostic parameters. We (1) assess whether there are 
prognostically significant LN thresholds, (2) estimate their association with 
MTC-specific mortality, and (3) appraise the identified thresholds using an 
institutional database. Methods: In this retrospective cohort analysis, MTC 
patients were abstracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
database (2004-20). Cox models with restricted cubic splines assessed the 
functional relationship of LNR and positive LN count with MTC-specific 
mortality. Thresholds were estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo and 
bootstrapping. Multivariable models estimated the association of the thresholds 
with mortality. The testing cohort comprised 149 patients with MTC at a single 
institution (1996-2025). Results: There were 2709 patients in the derivation 
cohort; 2098 (77.4%) had LNs examined. Mean patient age was 54.1 years, 59.1% 
were female, and 69.6% were non-Hispanic White. Mean tumor size was 23.5 mm; 
52.7% of patients with LNs examined had ≥1 positive LN. The 5-year MTC-specific 
survival was 93.3%. Threshold values of 7.8 positive LNs and a LNR of 13.8% were 
identified (nonlinearity p < 0.001 for both). Adjusted analyses revealed that ≥8 
positive LNs were associated with a significantly increased hazard of 
MTC-specific mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.54, confidence interval [CI]: 
1.09-2.17, p = 0.014, model area under the curve [AUC] 86.7%); a LNR ≥14% was 
associated with a significantly increased mortality hazard (HR: 3.308, CI: 
2.096-5.222, p < 0.001, model AUC: 87.9%). The thresholds were significantly 
associated with recurrence-free survival in the testing cohort: 5-year 
recurrence-free survival was 56.5% (CI: 39.5 - 70.4) for patients with ≥8 
positive LNs and 90.5% (CI: 82.5 - 94.9) for <8 (log-rank p < 0.001); it was 
67.9% (CI: 55 - 77.9) for patients with LNR ≥14% and 92.8% (CI: 83.6 - 97) for 
LNR <14 (log-rank p < 0.001). Conclusions: Using population-level data, we 
identified robust LN thresholds associated with MTC-specific mortality. Compared 
with a threshold of 8 positive LNs, a LNR threshold ≥14% was associated with a 
greater increase in hazard of MTC-specific mortality.

Background: Developed by members of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) 
Clinical Affairs Committee, this executive summary of the 2025 ATA guidelines 
for adult patients with differentiated thyroid cancer provides a summary of key 
points and recommendations with an emphasis on notable differences between the 
2025 and 2015 guidelines. Summary: The updated guidelines emphasize 
individualized care through the DATA framework (Diagnosis, risk/benefit 
Assessment, Treatment decisions, and response Assessment) with the goal of 
enhancing shared decision-making and personalized care. Highlights include 
expanded role of molecular diagnostics, refined risk stratification, greater 
emphasis on active surveillance and lobectomy, inclusion of ablative procedures, 
and selective use of external beam radiation therapy and chemoradiotherapy. 
De-escalation of surveillance for low-risk patients and introduction of the 
concept of complete remission are also new. Conclusions: This executive summary 
aims to provide a summary of key points and recommendations with an emphasis on 
notable differences between the 2025 and 2015 guidelines.

Background: Adjunct methadone has been used previously for cancer-related pain, 
but evidence on predictors for early response remains limited. Objective: 
Identify the prevalence and predictors of early adjunct methadone response in 
palliative care patients. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Settings/Subjects: 
Patients who initiated adjunct methadone from 2022 to 2024. Measurement: 
Univariate and multivariate Poisson regression identified prevalence and 
predictors of early response. Results: Among 42 patients, 28 (67%) achieved 
early response. They had higher baseline oral morphine equivalents, higher 
starting methadone doses, and shorter days to first titration (p < 0.05). 
Predictors included metastatic cancer (RR 3.30, p = 0.005), higher performance 
status (RR 2.58, p = 0.033), methadone daily dose >5 mg (RR 3.91, p = 0.013), 
lower baseline pain scores (RR 0.78, p = 0.025), and preserved liver function 
(RR 4.32, p = 0.009). Conclusion: Metastatic cancer patients with high 
performance status without liver damage may benefit from a higher, proactively 
titrated starting dose of adjunct methadone.

Background and Objective: Palliative care (PC) has demonstrated the ability to 
improve patient outcomes and quality of life among patients with 
life-threatening diseases. The current study aimed to investigate the impact of 
inpatient PC on health care utilization and expenditure among patients with 
advanced gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. Methods: Patients diagnosed with advanced 
GI cancer (2007-2019) were identified from the SEER-Medicare database in the 
United States. Multivariable regression with entropy balancing was used to 
analyze the association between inpatient PC and outcomes, including 
readmission, length of stay (LOS), and expenditure. Results: Among 48,100 
patients diagnosed with advanced GI cancer (colon: n = 23,080, 48.0%; pancreas: 
n = 12,280, 25.5%; rectum: n = 6497, 13.5%; biliary: n = 3551, 7.3%; liver: n = 
2692, 5.6%), 1277 (2.65%) received PC. Median patient age was 77 (72-83) with 
most being female (n = 25,687, 53.4%). Patients with PC were more likely to be 
discharged to skilled nursing facility (SNF) (42.3% vs. 17.9%) and less likely 
to get readmitted within 30 days (18.2% vs. 28.1%). On adjusted analysis, 
patients with PC had higher costs at index admission (mean difference [β]: 
$1,494, 95% confidence interval [CI] $1,394-$1,594) but lower 90-day expenditure 
(β: -$3,037, 95% CI: -$3,279 to -$2,796). PC was also linked with lower odds of 
readmission (odds ratio 0.39, 95% CI: 0.33-0.46) and cumulative 90-day LOS (β: 
-1.31, 95% CI: -1.62 to -0.99). Conclusion: Following inpatient PC, patients 
with advanced GI cancer experienced fewer readmissions, days in hospital, and 
lower costs. Integrating PC into cancer care is vital to enhance patient 
outcomes while alleviating the strain on health care resources.

BACKGROUND: This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesises evidence from 
both randomised trials and observational studies to determine whether lobectomy 
or sublobar resection offers improved outcomes for patients with stage Ia 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Studies (up to June 2025) comparing lobectomy and sublobar resection 
(segmentectomy or wedge) for clinical stage Ia NSCLC (<2 cm) were included in 
the random-effects meta-analyses. Risk of bias was assessed using Risk of Bias 2 
for randomised trials or Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of 
Interventions-I for observational studies.
RESULTS: 19 studies, including four randomised trials, were included. Overall 
survival at 5 years was comparable between lobectomy and sublobar resection 
(HR=1.00; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.19; I²=26%), as was disease-free survival (HR=1.05; 
95% CI 0.90 to 1.23; I²=0%). Sublobar resection was associated with 
significantly higher local recurrence (OR=1.86; 95% CI 1.07 to 3.25; I²=73%). No 
differences were observed in 10-year survival (OR=0.99; 95% CI 0.27 to 3.59; 
I²=86%) or postoperative change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (mean 
difference=-4.70; 95% CI -11.15 to 1.76; I²=99%). In 10 studies that mandated 
systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node sampling, sublobar resection was 
associated with improved overall survival compared with lobectomy (HR=0.81; 
95% CI 0.69 to 0.965; I²=0%).
CONCLUSION: Lobectomy and sublobar resection offer comparable long-term survival 
for patients with stage Ia NSCLC. While sublobar resection is associated with 
higher local recurrence rates, subgroup analysis suggests that when 
intraoperative systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node sampling is 
performed, sublobar resection may offer a survival advantage.

PURPOSE: This study evaluated the dynamic changes in the tumor microenvironment 
(TME) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and acquired 
resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(TKIs) using an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered spatial TME analyzer. We 
then assessed the predictive efficacy of immune-checkpoint inhibitors 
(ICIs)-based treatment.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: An AI-powered whole-slide image analyzer was used to 
segment cancer areas (CAs) and cancer stroma and to identify tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs), tertiary lymphoid structures, fibroblasts, and endothelial 
cells (ECs) in the tumor tissue. We analyzed 143 NSCLC samples after resistance 
to EGFR-TKIs from two cohorts: (1) 89 patients treated with ICI monotherapy and 
(2) 54 patients from the ATTLAS phase III trial comparing atezolizumab plus 
bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin (ABCP) versus pemetrexed plus 
carboplatin.
RESULTS: Post-TKI samples showed reduced TILs in the CA (p=0.045) and increased 
ECs in the CA (p=0.005) compared with pre-TKI samples. These changes differed 
according to EGFR mutation subtype. Higher TILs in CA were associated with a 
better overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS). 
Similarly, higher EC levels in CA correlated with improved ORR and PFS. In the 
ATTLAS cohort, these factors were associated with clinical benefits from ABCP, 
with a significant association with TILs and a marginal association with ECs.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that EGFR-TKIs affect the immune landscape of 
patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Higher TILs or ECs in the CA were 
significantly associated with a favorable response to subsequent ICI-based 
treatment.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is used alongside cytotoxic 
chemotherapy regimens to reduce the severity and duration of neutropenia and 
decrease infection risk. Here, we add to the growing body of evidence that 
aortitis can be considered a recognised side effect of G-CSF therapy.A woman in 
her 60s with breast carcinoma treated with G-CSF cover alongside adjuvant 
chemotherapy presented with intermittent fever and epigastric pain. There were 
no localising signs of infection. Results demonstrated raised inflammatory 
markers. The patient did not respond to antibiotics, and imaging showed a 
descending aortitis. She was diagnosed with G-CSF aortitis and treated with 
high-dose intravenous steroids, which resulted in clinical 
improvement.Clinicians should be aware of the link between G-CSF administration 
and the development of aortitis and should consider aortitis when a patient 
presents with fever in the absence of infection following G-CSF therapy. 
Clinicians must ensure thorough examination in such non-specific presentations.

Anaemia is a common and constant challenge in oncology. Many patients treated 
for cancer suffer from undiagnosed and untreated anaemia and may receive 
unnecessary blood transfusions, despite existing guidelines. Transfusion can 
lead to increased morbidity and mortality, longer hospital stays, and higher 
costs, all in a dose-dependent manner. Patient Blood Management (PBM) is founded 
on three key pillars: managing anaemia, reducing blood loss, and improving 
tolerance to anaemia. These strategies should be implemented before, during, and 
after surgery. PBM programmes have proven to be effective in lowering 
transfusion rates and should be applied to every patient undergoing 
cancer-related surgery. As a standard of care, PBM could significantly enhance 
patient safety and long-term outcomes in a multidisciplinary surgical and 
medical oncology context. However, adherence to these recommendations remains 
insufficient. Key considerations during cancer surgery include: 1. Preoperative 
detection of anaemia and iron deficiency (ferritin<100 µg/L and/or < transferrin 
saturation < 20%), along with potential intravenous iron supplementation 
(depending on the product available). 2. Adherence to established transfusion 
guidelines (for oncology hospitalised adult patients who are hemodynamically 
stable and have no heart conditions, transfuse only when the haemoglobin 
concentration is less than 70 g/L). 3. Prevention of iatrogenic and unnecessary 
blood loss. 4. Utilisation of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (to be 
discontinued once haemoglobin levels reach 120 g/L). 5. Administration of 
antifibrinolytic agents. 6. Use of cell-salvage techniques (with leukodepletion 
filter). A successful PBM programme requires time to reach optimal efficiency, 
and the involvement of multidisciplinary teams is essential to improve the 
quality of treatment.

The 13th edition of the Tuscany Retreat on Cancer Research and Apoptosis was 
convened on August 23rd to 30th, 2025, continuing its tradition as a biennial 
forum for scientific exchange. The Retreat brought together leading 
investigators focused on cancer biology, programmed cell death, and 
neurodegenerative disorders. Presentations and discussions encompassed diverse 
themes, including mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, advances in molecular 
signaling networks, and the identification of novel cellular targets. All topics 
were unified by their relevance to the regulation of programmed cell death and 
the pathological consequences of its disruption. Through this review, we intend 
to convey the essence of the scientific exchanges and to summarize the major 
take-home messages derived from the Retreat.

Immunostaining and cytology, commonly used to detect cervical cancer, are 
time-consuming and pathologist dependent. In this work, for the first time, we 
have developed an ELISA assay for the extraction and co-measurement of p16 and 
Ki-67 in both vaginal and cervical samples for cervical cancer screening. Novel 
custom-made antibodies were developed, and a competitive ELISA assay was 
developed and optimized based on the concentration and incubation time of 
different steps to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the final assay in 
assessing cervical samples. The as-developed ELISA assay shows high sensitivity 
and selectivity in different collection media. The LoD of the test is 0.00004 
and 0.0058 μg/mL for p16 and Ki-67, respectively. The as-developed assay can be 
used in future studies to determine protein thresholds for different lesion 
grades of cervical cancer for samples collected in different settings. These 
assays can revolutionize the cervical cancer screening management process in the 
near future.

Super-enhancers exert a versatile role in tumor development by recruiting 
distinct transcription factors. This research aimed to further reveal the 
relevance between super-enhancers and transcription factor HSF1, the underlying 
regulatory mechanisms of HSF1, and the potential clinical application value of 
HSF1 in colorectal cancer (CRC). Following molecular docking, molecular dynamics 
simulation, and in vitro and in vivo assays, we identified that pharmacological 
inhibition of HSF1 by the specific inhibitor KRIBB11 attenuated CRC formation, 
highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting HSF1 in this malignancy. 
Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, we profiled HSF1 enrichment and 
identified a strong correlation between HSF1 and super-enhancers in CRC. Through 
lncRNA microarray technology, we screened a new super-enhancer-driven lncRNA 
EXOSC10-AS1, whose expression was up to HSF1 activity. The roles of EXOSC10-AS1 
were further dissected by quantitative PCR, fluorescence in situ hybridization, 
CCK8 and colony formation assays, RNA sequencing, and Gene Ontology and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis. The results demonstrated that 
EXOSC10-AS1 was beneficial for cell proliferation by promoting ORM1 expression, 
which activated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/P70S6K signaling pathway. Notably, the 
HSF1/EXOSC10-AS1/ORM1 axis showed a compensatory elevation when using poly 
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor-Niraparib (MK-4827) in CRC cells. 
Finally, inhibiting HSF1 reinforced the anticancer effect of MK-4827 both in 
vitro and in vivo. In sum, HSF1 accelerates super-enhancer-driven lncRNA 
EXOSC10-AS1 transcription to facilitate ORM1 expression, leading to 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR/P70S6K signal activation. Targeting HSF1 is sensitive to 
synergistic combination PARP inhibitor treatment in CRC. Therefore, our study 
provides a new approach to synergize PARP inhibitor for CRC therapy.

Plasma membrane invasion indicates advanced gastric cancer (GC) with higher 
metastasis risk, making early prediction crucial. We propose bMSAO-CART, 
combining memory-guided search artemisia optimization (MSAO) and classification 
and regression tree (CART) for prediction. MSAO retains high-quality early 
solutions to accelerate convergence and was validated against 22 algorithms in 
IEEE CEC 2017 benchmarks. Using data from 1145 GC patients (681 without, 464 
with invasion), bMSAO-CART achieved 92.406% accuracy and 94.270% sensitivity. 
Six important features were identified: serum chloride, total bilirubin, 
absolute lymphocyte count, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, and triglycerides.

BACKGROUND: Age-related immunosenescence, also known as 'inflammageing', may 
impact the elderly's ability to mount immune responses against cancers and 
compromise the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). In this 
context, data on tonsillar cancer (TC), a subset of head and neck squamous cell 
cancer (HNSCC), are lacking.
AIMS/OBJECTIVES: To compare the presence/distribution and features of immune 
cells in TC, and of bulk RNA-seq in HNSCC, between the young and the elderly.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: TC tissue microarrays (TMAs) characterised by GeoMx 
digital spatial profiling were revisited and analysed, focusing on 
quantification and location of CD8+ and CD11c+ immune cells. De novo analyses of 
the TMAs targeted CD68+/CD163+ macrophages. Bulk RNA-seq and clinical data from 
patients with HNSCC were sourced from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). For all 
data, patients were stratified into age groups.
RESULTS: Immune-cell characteristics in TC were similar across young and elderly 
individuals, although the elderly exhibited higher PD-1 levels. TCGA data 
revealed increased immune checkpoint molecules PD-L1 and LAG-3 in the elderly, 
alongside immunosuppression.
CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: In the elderly, key immune cells are present in TC, 
and immune checkpoint molecules are overexpressed. This may be relevant to the 
stratification of patients for ICI.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic performance of radiomics, habitat imaging, 
and 2.5D deep learning models for MRI-based prediction of parametrial invasion 
in cervical cancer, and to evaluate the clinical utility of a multimodal 
integrated model.
METHODS: This dual-center retrospective study included 290 patients with FIGO 
stage IB1-IIB cervical cancer who underwent preoperative MRI. Patients from 
Center A (n = 227) were divided into training and validation cohorts, while 
patients from Center B (n = 63) comprised the external test cohort. Radiomic 
features were extracted, habitat imaging was performed using k-means clustering, 
and a 2.5D deep learning model incorporated adjacent slices. Feature selection 
was conducted using Pearson correlation and LASSO regression. Machine learning 
models were developed, and an integrated model was constructed. Model 
performance was evaluated using AUC and accuracy. AUCs were compared with DeLong 
tests, calibration was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and clinical 
utility was evaluated with decision curve analysis.
RESULTS: The integrated model outperformed all individual models, achieving AUCs 
of 0.973, 0.901, and 0.906 in the training, validation, and external test 
cohorts, respectively. Among individual models, the deep-learning model showed 
the highest AUCs (0.954, 0.803, 0.833), followed by habitat imaging (0.860, 
0.811, 0.843). In the external test cohort, the peritumoral radiomics model 
outperformed the intratumoral model (0.843 vs. 0.719). The clinical model showed 
the lowest performance. Hosmer-Lemeshow tests indicated good calibration, and 
decision curve analysis confirmed superior clinical utility of the integrated 
model.
CONCLUSION: The multimodal integrated model, combining radiomics, habitat 
imaging, 2.5D deep learning, and clinical features, demonstrated superior 
predictive performance for parametrial invasion in cervical cancer compared with 
individual models. This approach may enhance preoperative assessment, guide

BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of the Asian Working Group on Cachexia 
(AWGC) criteria, as a novel diagnostic standard for cachexia, remains 
underexplored. This study aims to investigate the prognostic value of the AWGC 
criteria and to propose a scoring system for stratifying the severity of 
cachexia in lung cancer patients.
METHODS: Survival curves were generated using Kaplan-Meier analysis with 
log-rank tests. Cox proportional hazards models were employed for survival 
analysis, providing hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs). Logistic regression analysis was utilized to assess the 
independent association between cachexia and 90-day mortality, presenting the 
results as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs.
RESULTS: This study enrolled a total of 3,424 lung cancer patients, comprising 
86.6% with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 13.4% with small cell lung 
cancer (SCLC). Patients with AWGC-defined cachexia had significantly poorer 
survival (55.8% vs. 39.3%, p < 0.001). Cachectic patients exhibited considerably 
worse survival rates in both SCLC (42.9% vs. 25.4%, p < 0.001) and NSCLC (57.8% 
vs. 41.4%, p < 0.001). Cox regression analysis indicated that AWGC-defined 
cachexia is an independent risk factor for survival in lung cancer patients (HR: 
1.436, 95% CI: 1.306-1.580, p < 0.001). Moreover, AWGC-defined cachexia was 
significantly associated with poor prognosis in both SCLC (HR: 1.307, 95% CI: 
1.007-1.698, p = 0.044) and NSCLC (HR: 1.377, 95% CI: 1.234-1.538, p < 0.001) 
patients. AWGC-defined cachexia was also found to be an independent risk factor 
for 90-day mortality in lung cancer patients (OR = 3.060, 95% CI: 2.254-4.155, p 
< 0.001). We developed a severity grading system for categorizing cachexia into 
Mild, Moderate, and Severe. Survival rates gradually decreased as the severity 
grading score increased (63.2% vs. 49.1% vs. 37.0% vs. 30.0%, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: AWGC-defined cachexia is an independent risk factor for both 
long-term prognosis and 90-day mortality in lung cancer patients.

Type 2 diabetes is an established bladder cancer risk factor, but any role of 
type 1 diabetes in this malignancy has remained unclear. We systematically 
sought, critically appraised, and quantitatively synthesized published estimates 
of the association between type 1 diabetes and incident bladder cancer in 
humans. Systematic review identified nine independent studies providing relevant 
data, but eight of these studies had not addressed confounding by history of 
smoking tobacco, a strong risk factor for bladder cancer. Therefore, in this 
research the quantitative synthesis of original data was implemented by 
meta-regression to detect and quantify residual confounding by tobacco smoking, 
followed by synthetic meta-analysis to combine smoking-controlled estimates. 
This analysis robustly identified four-fold greater occurrence of bladder cancer 
in those with type 1 diabetes (summary estimate 4.29 [95% confidence interval: 
2.45-7.47], 9 studies). Thus, type 1 diabetes appears to be a strong risk factor 
for bladder cancer, and it seems likely that this association was previously 
obscured by strong negative confounding by smoking. Studies addressing 
established bladder cancer risk factors together with duration and severity of 
type 1 diabetes are now warranted to better understand the role of type 1 
diabetes in bladder cancer etiology, and to inform the care of patients.

BACKGROUND: Circulating mRNA has emerged as a promising biomarker in head and 
neck cancer (HNC). These molecules provide real-time insight into the 
inflammatory tumour microenvironment and systemic immune modulation. 
Understanding inflammation-related circulating mRNAs can help link tumour 
biology with clinical outcomes.
KEY FINDINGS: Circulating mRNAs, often encapsulated within exosomes or apoptotic 
bodies, mirror key inflammatory events in the TME. They not only indicate 
tumour-driven inflammation but may also influence disease progression. Several 
transcripts such as IL6, IL10, TNFα, and HMOX1 have been associated with 
angiogenesis, immune evasion, and poor treatment response. Emerging evidence 
further supports their role as predictors of recurrence and therapy resistance.
CONCLUSION: Circulating mRNAs reflect dynamic changes in the body's immune 
system and contribute to tumour progression and treatment resistance. 
Inflammation-related circulating mRNAs hold both diagnostic and therapeutic 
potential in HNC, serving as indicators of tumour-associated inflammation and 
possible targets for anti-inflammatory or immune-modulatory therapies. 
Integrating circulating mRNA profiling with multi-omics approaches may deepen 
understanding of molecular interactions and advance precision oncology.

Magnetochemistry is opening new frontiers in the targeted treatment of breast 
cancer (BC), offering a precise and innovative way to deliver therapies exactly 
where they're needed. Beyond drug delivery, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) can 
generate localized heat under alternating magnetic fields, initiating controlled 
hyperthermia that induces apoptotic cell death in tumor tissues. MNPs, 
particularly iron-oxide-based magnetite (Fe₃O₄) and maghemite (γ-Fe₂O₃), can be 
magnetically guided toward tumor sites and subsequently activated under 
alternating magnetic field (AMFs) (typically 100-500 kHz and 10-40 kA m-1) to 
generate therapeutic heat through Néel and Brownian relaxation losses. At the 
tumor, drugs can be released in a controlled manner in response to environmental 
cues such as pH changes, enzymes, or magnetic stimuli. By harnessing this dual 
role of MNPs, as targeted carriers and thermal effectors, researchers achieve 
spatially selective, minimally invasive treatment. Mechanistically, magnetically 
induced hyperthermia elevates local temperature to 42-46 °C, which triggers 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, 
and caspase-3/9 activation-hallmarks of apoptosis in BC cells. This integrated 
approach not only concentrates drugs at the tumor but also sensitizes cancer 
cells to chemo- and radiotherapy, while minimizing systemic toxicity. Static or 
dynamic magnetic fields can be used to steer these particles, while their 
surfaces can be engineered through chemical bonding, physical encapsulation, or 
adsorption techniques. Moreover, combining magnetic targeting with 
antibody-based recognition improves specificity and therapeutic impact. While 
the promise of magnetochemistry in BC treatment is clear, ongoing research is 
essential to optimize these technologies and bring them fully into clinical 
practice.

PURPOSE: Salvage stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for intraprostatic 
recurrence of prostate cancer is under study in early phase clinical trials. 
Presently, the impact of this treatment on toxicity and health-related quality 
of life (HRQOL) is poorly defined. We present the first report in the literature 
of HRQOL and psychometric outcomes from a mature, prospective clinical trial.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: NCT03253744 was a phase I trial of focal salvage SBRT to 
doses of 40.0Gy-42.5Gy with target volume delineation guided by 18F-DCFPyL 
PET/CT and MRI. Secondary endpoints included longitudinal assessment of CTCAE 
version 5.0 adverse events (AEs) and corresponding patient-reported outcome 
measures (PROMs). PROMs included the Expanded Prostate Cancer Inventory 
Composite (EPIC)-26, American Urologic Association (AUA) Internal Prostate 
Symptom Score (IPSS), Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM), PROMIS Anxiety, 
PROMIS Depression, and PROMIS Psychosocial Illness Impact (PII)-Positive. Study 
assessments were conducted at baseline, one month, and at every three-month 
interval post-SBRT until study completion or biochemical failure.
RESULTS: Seventeen participants underwent salvage SBRT and were observed for a 
median of 24 months (min-max: 18-24 months). Toxicity assessment was completed 
in all participants, and the HRQOL response rate was 91%. GU toxicity was more 
common than GI toxicity with a 24-month cumulative incidence of G2+ AEs of 76.5% 
(95% CI: 44.6-90.0%) versus 29.4% (95% CI: 4.1%-48.1%) and G3+ AEs of 11.8% (95% 
CI: 0.0-25.8%) versus 5.9% (0.0%-16.4%). GU toxicity peaked at 12 to 15-months 
and was associated most strongly with urethral re-irradiation dose. PROMs were 
concordant with AEs, with significant differences from baseline noted in the 
AUA-SI, EPIC GU irritation, and EPIC GU incontinence scores at 3-6 months, 6-9 
months, and 9-18 months, respectively. No significant differences were noted in 
GI PROMs or PROMIS measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Salvage SBRT has a favorable treatment-related toxicity and HRQOL 
profile. Primarily GU toxicities were observed corresponding to decrements in 
PROMs.

Cancer has been correlated with psychiatrical disorders and incidence of 
depression is about 3-fold higher in oncological patients. However, there is no 
validated animal models currently describing sarcoma-associated depression. 
Herein, we evaluated a preclinical way for estimating behavioral depression-like 
parameters in Sarcoma 180-transplanted mice and investigated the therapeutic 
efficacy of current clinical antidepressants. Firstly, S-180-bearing Swiss were 
evaluated using behavioral tests between days 10-11 after S-180 transplantation: 
open field (OFT), elevated plus maze (EPM), light-dark box (LDB), tail 
suspension (TST), forced swim (FST), and sucrose preference (SPT). Next, studies 
investigated oral effects of amitriptyline (AMI), fluoxetine (FLU), or 
5-fluorouracil (5-FU, i.p.) at 10 or 20 mg/kg/day (alone or in combination) on 
behavior and oxidative/nitrosative profile of subacute-treated mice. No 
significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed about locomotor and exploratory 
activity (OFT, EPM, LDB). Meanwhile, S-180-bearing mice showed increase of 
immobility time (TST) and reduced sucrose preference in comparison with healthy 
animals (p < 0.05), typical features of depressive phenotype without alterations 
in anxiety-related parameters. These findings were associated with oxidative 
stress (malondialdehyde increasing) and antioxidant markers (superoxide 
dismutase decreasing/increasing) in the prefrontal cortex and/or hippocampus (p 
< 0.05). Such biochemical changes and depressive phenotype were partly 
attenuated by amitriptyline and fluoxetine 10 or 20 mg/kg/day for 10 days, but 
co-treatment with 5-fluoruracil did not show additional improvements. This 
physiopathological study represent a promising discovery highlighting the 
potential of non-clinical protocols to understand mesenchymal tumor-related 
depression and to develop new pharmacological tools against the multivariate 
spectrum of cancer-related diseases.

Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) plays an important role in the development and 
prognosis of lung cancer. Increasing evidence suggests that HDAC6-mediated 
regulation of autophagy may contribute to tumor progression and therapeutic 
resistance. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which HDAC6 modulates 
autophagic pathways in lung cancer remain incompletely understood and warrant 
further investigation. In this study, clinical lung cancer specimens(N = 100) 
were analyzed, revealing that HDAC6 expression was significantly associated with 
tumor stage (P = 0.012) and tumor grade (P = 0.028). High expression of HDAC6 
increased the survival risk of lung cancer patients by 3.652-fold and 
significantly reduced the survival rate (P ≤ 0.001). Our findings further 
demonstrate that HDAC6 modulates autophagy by regulating the HIF-1α/BNIP3 
signaling pathway through its deacetylase activity. Moreover, pharmacological 
inhibition of HDAC with Trichostatin A (TSA) suppressed both HDAC6 and BNIP3 
expression, decreased autophagic activity, and reduced lung tumor formation in a 
KRASG12D+/P53loxP/loxP transgenic mouse model. Collectively, these results 
reveal a novel HDAC6-HIF-1α-BNIP3 axis that governs autophagy in lung cancer and 
underscore the potential of HDAC6 as a therapeutic target for modulating 
autophagy and inhibiting lung tumor progression.

BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant therapies for high-risk PCa have shown promise but 
remain confined to clinical trials. Translating neoadjuvant approaches into 
routine care thus underscores the critical need for innovative early-phase 
neoadjuvant trials to evaluate safety and efficacy in localized disease, where 
tumors are more responsive to intervention.
METHODS: In this open-label phase 1 trial (NCT03262103), 12 patients with 
clinically localized intermediate- to high-risk PCa scheduled for radical 
prostatectomy (RP) received sequential intratumoral and intramuscular injections 
of poly-ICLC (Hiltonol®), with the primary endpoint to define a safe dose and 
schedule and one of the secondary endpoints to characterize associated adverse 
events.
FINDINGS: All patients tolerated poly-ICLC without dose-limiting toxicity or 
treatment withdrawal. Median follow-up was 4.5 years. Seventy percent of the 
evaluable patients had PSA0 (measured as PSA <0.1 ng/mL) 1 year post-RP. Gleason 
score at final pathology was downgraded in 66.7% of all patients and 70% of the 
high-risk subgroup. Tissue transcriptomic analysis revealed decreased metastasis 
signature post-treatment, with upregulation of immune cell-related and 
favorable-prognosis genes. Intratumoral and intramuscular poly-ICLC also 
enhanced immune activation signatures in the blood and increased NK cells in 
both blood and tissues. Treatment increased post-treatment infiltration of CD4+, 
CD8+, and PD-1+ T cells; CD56+ NK cells; CD20+ B cells; and tertiary lymphoid 
structure-like aggregates.
CONCLUSIONS: Intratumoral poly-ICLC immunotherapy for PCa is safe and may 
modulate the tumor microenvironment, enhancing antitumor responses. These 
findings support larger, controlled trials to assess effects on long-term 
clinical outcomes.

In this issue of Cancer Cell, Galeano Niño et al. report that tumor-infiltrating 
bacteria like Fusobacterium species induce a quiescent, chemoresistant state in 
cancer cells in the colon by disrupting epithelial contacts and suppressing 
proliferation and transcription. These studies highlight microbial-tumor 
interactions as potential modulators of therapeutic response in colon cancer.

Early-onset breast cancer (EOBC) increases annually with unclear mechanisms and 
shows poor therapeutic responses and survival rates. We identify environmental 
exposure to the common plasticizer di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) as a 
contributing factor to breast tumor initiation by impairing cancer immune 
surveillance. DEHP exposure upregulates the immune checkpoint molecule 
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) through estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) 
activation in human breast cancer cells and mouse models. Transcriptomic 
analysis reveals cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) as a key mediator of 
DEHP-induced immunosuppressive signaling. The CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib 
suppresses ERβ, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and PD-L1 expression, 
enhances anti-tumor responses, and reduces immune-related adverse events caused 
by anti-PD-1 antibody treatment in mice. While the strongest immune alterations 
appear in DEHP-exposed EOBC patients, the mechanisms extend to DEHP-associated 
breast cancer regardless of age. This study highlights immune dysregulation as a 
hallmark of DEHP-related breast carcinogenesis and supports co-targeting CDK4/6 
and PD-L1 as a therapeutic strategy.

The recessive Fanconi anemia (FA) phenotype is used to classify BRCA1 (FANCS), 
BRCA2 (FANCD1), and PALB2 (FANCN) variants with respect to dominant hereditary 
breast-ovarian cancer syndrome. We assessed its utility by examining the 
phenotypic spectrum observed in individuals with bi-allelic BRCA1, BRCA2, or 
PALB2 pathogenic variants and exploring the relationship between cancer 
presentation and allele severity score based on variant molecular features. A 
data collection instrument comprising 158 Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms 
was used to document clinical features for individuals with FA from published 
and/or prospectively collected sources (total n = 172, 43 previously 
unpublished). Distinct FA-related variants (15 BRCA1, 123 BRCA2, and 22 PALB2) 
were annotated for predicted molecular impact, location, observed splicing or 
functional impact, and potential in-frame splicing rescue and used to assign 
different permutations of allele severity scores, which were assessed for 
correlation with FA presentation features. The association of BRCA1 and BRCA2 
allele severity score with the magnitude of breast cancer risk in heterozygotes 
was evaluated using case-control analysis. Clinical features extended beyond the 
HPO list, including 84 terms related by hierarchy and 94 additional terms. The 
BRCA2 genotype severity score was associated with age at cancer diagnosis in 
individuals with FA (p = 1.8 × 10-8). A similar permutation approach revealed 
significant differences in the magnitude of breast cancer risk according to the 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 allele severity score in heterozygotes. Our findings indicate 
the potential to redefine FA ORPHA:84 HPO terms and to use an allele severity 
scoring approach to predict cancer risk in individuals with bi-allelic or 
heterozygous BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants.

IntroductionPatients with cancer may overestimate their ability to adhere to 
oral anticancer treatments (OAT) which may significantly reduce adherence rates. 
However, only few studies have investigated the specific role of personality 
traits and cognitive distortions in the definition of the adherence trajectory 
in the cancer field.MethodsThis study is nested in the Pfizer project 
(65080791), and it is a secondary, observational analysis of prospectively 
collected data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT). To avoid potential bias 
from comparing measurements across different time points, we limited the 
evaluation of associations among variables to the baseline data. 94 metastatic 
breast cancer (MBC) patients (mean age 56.8) receiving OAT for MBC have been 
enrolled. Each participant filled a set of measures assessing personality (Big 
Five), adherence (AAI-28 and MMAS-8) (© 2006 Donald E Morisky), and optimistic 
bias (VAS), and Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23).ResultsA 
discrepancy between self-oriented and other-oriented evaluation of the capacity 
to take the therapy in the doses, frequencies, and times prescribed was observed 
(P < 0.001). A negative association between adherence rate and the 
self-perception of treatment adherence was identified (P < 0.001). Further, 
conscientiousness correlated positively with the perception of risk to their own 
health (P = 0.034), and negative association between extraversion and 
self-perception of treatment adherence (P = 0.05) and between agreeableness and 
self-perception of treatment adherence have been observed (P = 
0.029).ConclusionsOur findings suggest that optimistic bias and personality may 
contribute to shaping adherence in MBC patients. Personality traits influence 
adherence both directly, by increasing the perception of health risks, and 
indirectly, by influencing coping strategies and emotion regulation. MBC 
patients having an OB may underestimate the important side effects and physical 
comorbidities, as well as difficulties in the daily management and adjustment of 
therapy due to disease progression.

Tumor hypoxia represents a fundamental barrier to effective cancer therapy, 
driving resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy while 
fostering invasion and metastasis. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), by 
substantially increasing dissolved oxygen in plasma, offers a unique approach to 
reoxygenate tumors and remodel the tumor microenvironment. Preclinical and 
clinical studies have revealed that HBOT enhances drug penetration, augments 
radiation-induced DNA damage, alleviates hypoxia-driven immunosuppression, and 
synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade. At the mechanistic level, HBOT 
modulates oxidative stress, ferroptosis, angiogenesis, and cancer stem cell 
maintenance, thereby counteracting hallmarks of therapeutic resistance. Despite 
these promising findings, controversies remain regarding its dose-response 
relationship, long-term safety, and the potential for pro-angiogenic effects 
under certain conditions. Advances in multi-omics profiling, precision imaging, 
and adaptive trial designs are expected to define optimal treatment parameters 
and identify predictive biomarkers. We propose that integrating HBOT into 
multimodal oncologic regimens could overcome hypoxia-associated resistance and 
improve patient outcomes. Positioned at the intersection of basic mechanisms and 
clinical translation, HBOT is poised to reshape strategies for personalized 
cancer therapy.

Fuelling resistance: Lipid metabolic rewiring in cancer response to chemotherapy 
and radiotherapy.

Resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy remains a major challenge in cancer 
treatment and is closely linked to treatment failure and poor patient outcome. 
While metabolic rewiring is a well-established hallmark of cancer, the specific 
role of lipid metabolism in promoting therapy resistance has only recently 
gained attention. Cancer cells modulate lipid metabolic pathways to support 
survival, maintain redox balance, enable membrane remodelling, enhance DNA 
repair, and evade cell death under therapeutic stress. They do so by altering 
fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid oxidation, and lipid storage, ultimately 
contributing to resistance to genotoxic therapies. These adaptations also 
intersect with non-apoptotic cell death pathways such as ferroptosis and 
cuproptosis, and are regulated in part by post-translational modifications 
including acetylation and lipidation. Moreover, chemotherapy and radiotherapy 
can further promote metabolic adaptations that increase lipid dependence and 
reinforce resistant phenotypes. Recognizing these metabolic dependencies has 
revealed potential molecular targets within lipid metabolism, offering new 
opportunities to overcome resistance by co-targeting metabolic plasticity 
alongside standard therapies. Therapeutic strategies that disrupt lipid-driven 
adaptations may therefore help re-sensitise resistant tumours, enhance 
therapeutic efficacy, and expand treatment options.

Ovarian cancer (OC) is the gynecological malignancy with the highest mortality, 
largely due to frequent resistance to conventional therapies. OC is 
characterized by high rates of genomic instability, often caused by DNA repair 
defects, and is commonly treated with platinum-based compounds and other 
genotoxic agents. Indeed, alterations in the DNA damage response (DDR), which 
are prevalent in many cancers, are particularly relevant in OC. Notably, 
homologous recombination deficiency is frequently observed, providing a 
rationale for strategies to enhance treatment efficacy by exploiting DNA repair 
defects. In this review, we examine the consequences of dysregulation and 
defects in the major DNA repair pathways in OC, with emphasis on their impact on 
therapy resistance, patient survival and OC risk. We also discuss current and 
emerging DDR-targeted therapies and highlight future directions for research 
aimed at improving clinical outcomes in OC.

BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks effective therapeutic 
targets and exhibits high metastatic potential, resulting in poor prognosis. 
Both STAT3 signaling and pro-survival autophagy are well-established as critical 
drivers of TNBC metastasis, yet existing therapeutic approaches primarily focus 
on single-target inhibition. Pulchinenoside E2 (PSE2), a natural compound 
isolated from Pulsatilla chinensis, has demonstrated anti-proliferative effects 
on breast cancer cells. However, its effect on TNBC metastasis and whether it 
acts concurrently with these two pathways remain unclear.
PURPOSE: To identify the key molecular targets of PSE2 and elucidate its unique 
mechanisms in suppressing TNBC metastasis.
METHODS: The anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects of PSE2 on multiple TNBC 
cell lines were assessed using Transwell assays. Network pharmacology analysis 
was used to identify overlapping genes and core targets associated with PSE2 and 
TNBC metastasis. STAT3 was identified as a key target through Western blotting, 
RNA interference, and Transwell experiments. PSE2-STAT3 interactions were 
investigated via molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and the 
cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). In vitro studies with HS-578T and 
MDA-MB-231 cells evaluated the effects of PSE2 on STAT3 and JAK2 
phosphorylation, STAT3 nuclear and mitochondrial functions, autophagy, and the 
interplay between STAT3 inhibition and autophagic regulation. In vivo, TNBC 
metastasis mouse models were used to assess PSE2's effects on hepatic and 
pulmonary metastases. Pharmacokinetic analysis evaluated the compound's clinical 
translational potential.
RESULTS: PSE2 selectively inhibited invasion and migration in TNBC cells. 
Network analysis identified 41 overlapping genes and 11 core targets, among 
which STAT3 emerged as a critical mediator of PSE2's anti-metastatic effects. 
STAT3 demonstrated the lowest binding free energy to PSE2, with binding 
confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations and CETSA. PSE2 suppressed p-JAK2 
(Tyr1007/1008) and p-STAT3 (Tyr705 and Ser727), impaired STAT3 nuclear 
transcriptional activity, and inhibited STAT3-dependent mitochondrial oxidative 
phosphorylation. Additionally, PSE2 blocked autophagic flux by impairing 
lysosomal proteolytic activity, promoting degradation of mature tissue 
proteases, and disrupting lysosomal acidity, independent of STAT3. Concurrent 
inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation and autophagy synergistically enhanced 
suppression of TNBC cell migration and invasion. In vivo, PSE2 markedly reduced 
hepatic and pulmonary metastases and exhibited prolonged retention and slower 
clearance in mice.
CONCLUSIONS: PSE2 functions as a dual inhibitor of STAT3 signaling and 
autophagy, exerting potent anti-metastatic effects in TNBC. Its mechanism 
involves suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation and induction of lysosomal 
dysfunction. These findings highlight PSE2 as a promising candidate for the 
treatment of TNBC metastasis.

BACKGROUND: Globally, lymphoma incidence has been steadily rising, with notable 
regional and gender-based variations. Understanding these trends in developing 
countries like Sri Lanka is essential to address cancer control strategies.
METHODOLOGY: Cancer incidence and mortality data from the National Cancer 
Control Program (NCCP) registries (2005-2021) were analyzed. Temporal trends in 
age-standardized rates (ASR) were assessed using Joinpoint Regression to 
estimate annual percent change (APC) and average APC (AAPC).
RESULTS: A total of new 15,577 lymphoma cases were reported with male 
predominance (60 %, n = 9346) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) being the 
predominant subtype (79 %, n = 9561). The overall incidence increased 
significantly over 16 years (AAPC: 4.1 %; p < 0.05), with a 1.4-fold rise in 
both sexes and a marked rise among 0-19-year-olds, exclusively post-2019 
(p < 0.05). NHL incidence was highest in individuals aged ≥ 60 years, with a 
2-fold rise in both gender (APC: 3.2; 95 % CI: 0.4 - 6.1; p < 0.05) during 
2011-2021. Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) showed a significant 3-fold increase in 
females, while trends in males fluctuated, with a significant average AAPC in 
both sexes from 2011 to 2021 (p < 0.05). Despite the non-significant rise in 
female incidence across most age groups, males in 40-59 and > 60 years age 
groups showed a decline. A significant rise in NHL-related deaths among males 
(p < 0.05) was noted, with a non-significant increase in females.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate an apparent rising burden of lymphoma in Sri 
Lanka, particularly among males and the elderly. However, this observed increase 
may be partly attributable to improvements in cancer diagnostics and NCCP 
reporting over time. Additionally, evolving WHO classifications and their 
gradual adoption may also have influenced the observed trends.

PURPOSE: Aromatase inhibitors are commonly used in adjuvant therapy for breast 
cancer. However, their impact on thyroid function remains unclear. This study 
aimed to evaluate thyroid function in postmenopausal women with 
oestrogen-receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer one and two years after 
initiating aromatase inhibitors.
METHODS: This prospective controlled study involved 59 postmenopausal women with 
early-stage breast cancer and 39 healthy controls. All participants underwent 
chemotherapy and aromatase inhibitor treatment, with 35 receiving locoregional 
radiotherapy. The primary outcomes included evaluation of thyroid hormones and 
thyroid-binding globulin post-chemotherapy, at one-year and two-year follow-ups 
after initiation of aromatase inhibitors. Secondary outcomes included thyroid 
autoantibodies and weight/body mass index.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in thyroid parameters between the 
patients and healthy controls pre-chemotherapy. During treatment, free-thyroxine 
levels increased at both visits (p < 0.01), and total thyroxine increased at the 
two-year visit (p = 0.02), while triiodothyronine decreased (p < 0.01 and p = 
0.03). No changes in thyroid-stimulating hormone or thyroid-binding globulin 
were observed, but albumin increased after one year (p < 0.01). Weight change 
was insignificant, and autoimmune thyroiditis prevalence was low (≤15 %). No 
differences in thyroid function between women with or without locoregional 
radiotherapy/trastuzumab were found.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that, despite statistically significant changes 
in peripheral thyroid hormones, there were no obvious clinically important 
effects observed in patients with early-stage breast cancer during the two-year 
treatment with aromatase inhibitors. The changes were not associated with 
thyroid autoimmunity, non-thyroidal illness, radiotherapy, trastuzumab therapy, 
or high-dose corticosteroids. Further research is needed to better understand 
the long-term impact of aromatase inhibitors on thyroid function in this 
population.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov 
(NCT03784651).

BACKGROUND: Feature selection is a crucial step in improving classification 
performance for high dimensional cancer datasets, which often contain numerous 
irrelevant or redundant features that can negatively impact model accuracy and 
increase computational load.
METHOD: The proposed hybrid AOA-SVM method effectively reduces the gene pool to 
a subset of highly informative features by implementing AOA's capability for 
efficient local optimization and diversity maintenance. Within the AOA 
framework, gene selection is refined through local optimization within smaller 
subgroups, followed by a shuffling phase to preserve solution diversity. This 
dual-phase strategy allows the identification of key genes that optimally 
distinguish between cancerous and healthy tissues. Selected gene subsets are 
then classified using SVM for high accuracy. The approach was evaluated on three 
major cancer datasets: leukaemia (AML, ALL), ovarian, and CNS.
RESULTS: The method demonstrated impressive performance across all datasets. In 
the ovarian dataset, the model achieved 99.12 % accuracy and an AUC-ROC score of 
98.83 % with only 15 selected genes. The leukaemia dataset achieved perfect 
classification with 100 % accuracy and an AUC-ROC score with 34 genes. For the 
CNS dataset, the approach maintained 100 % accuracy using 43 genes. These 
results validate the AOASVM method's effectiveness in producing accurate, 
informative gene subsets, enabling high-precision classification.
CONCLUSION: The AOA-SVM hybrid presents a highly accurate and computationally 
efficient tool for cancer diagnostics, demonstrating significant potential for 
application in precision medicine by identifying minimal, biologically relevant 
gene markers.

BACKGROUND: Minimal extrathyroidal extension, detected only through histologic 
examination, remains a topic of ongoing debate regarding the prognostic 
importance of differentiated thyroid cancer.
METHODS: Patients with pT1 and pT2 differentiated thyroid cancer from 2004 to 
2015 were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
database on 3 March 2025. The median follow-up period was 129 months for both 
patients with pT1 and pT2. Multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate 
differences in lymph node involvement or distant metastasis, as well as survival 
outcomes between patients with pT1 and pT2 differentiated thyroid cancer with 
and without minimal extrathyroidal extension.
RESULTS: Patients with PT1 and pT2 with minimal extrathyroidal extension had a 
significantly greater risk of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis 
compared with those without in the multivariate logistic analysis (pT1: adjusted 
odds ratio, 4.15; 95% confidence interval, 3.83-4.48; P < .001; pT2: adjusted 
odds ratio, 4.69; 95% confidence interval, 4.23-5.20; P < .001). Patients with 
pT1 with minimal extrathyroidal extension experienced a similar hazard risk of 
cancer-specific death to those without in the multivariate Cox analysis 
(adjusted hazard ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-2.21; P = .127) and 
the multivariate competing risk model (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 
1.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-2.27; P = .111) whereas patients with pT2 
with minimal extrathyroidal extension experienced a significantly greater risk 
of cancer-specific death than those without in the multivariate Cox analysis 
(adjusted hazard ratio, 2.48, 95% confidence interval, 1.77-3.49; P < .001) and 
the multivariate competing risk model (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 
2.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.72-3.63; P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Minimal extrathyroidal extension was an independent risk factor of 
lymph node involvement or distant metastasis in patients with pT1 and pT2. 
Minimal extrathyroidal extension did not significantly affect survival in 
patients with pT1, but it was an independent prognostic factor for survival in 
patients with pT2. Therefore, more aggressive treatment strategies are warranted 
for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer with minimal extrathyroidal 
extension, particularly those classified as pT2.

Diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is generally regarded as dismal with poor 
prognosis due to advanced stage at presentation and limited treatment options. 
In the last years, treatment options for patients with pancreatic cancer, even 
in advanced stages of disease, improved. Beside tailored-approaches including 
chemotherapies in neo or adjuvant intention, new targets as well as vaccination 
has been implemented into therapeutic strategies. Additionally, embedded into 
individual treatment strategies, surgical approached were refined providing the 
potential chance for cure even in metastatic disease. The aim of this review 
article is to describe current and further treatment options for patients with 
pancreatic cancer showing promising results. However, more efforts are needed to 
further improve patients' prognosis.

Lorlatinib has demonstrated significant efficacy for treating anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, its 
safety profile-particularly regarding immune-related adverse events-remains 
incompletely characterized. We describe a case of ALK-positive NSCLC complicated 
by autoimmune thyroiditis during lorlatinib therapy. The temporal link between 
lorlatinib exposure, the emergence of thyroid autoantibodies, and their 
resolution following drug withdrawal raises the possibility that lorlatinib may 
influence autoimmune responses.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality, with 
microsatellite-stable tumors exhibiting poor response to immune checkpoint 
inhibitors. Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) stabilizes programmed 
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), promoting immune evasion.
METHODS: Through screening, synthesis, and optimization, we identified an 
o-aminodiphenyl derivative, U-20, as a potent USP7 inhibitor (IC₅₀ = 83 nM). 
USP7 inhibition, PD-L1 modulation, and immune activation were evaluated using in 
vitro enzymatic and cellular assays, T-cell killing assays, and an 
immunocompetent CT26 colorectal cancer mouse model.
RESULTS: U-20 selectively bound USP7, destabilized PD-L1 via proteasome-mediated 
degradation, and increased PD-L1 polyubiquitination without affecting 
transcription. In colorectal cancer cell-T-cell co-cultures, U-20 enhanced CD8+ 
T-cell cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion (IFN-γ, TNF-α), effects abolished by 
ubiquitination-resistant PD-L1 mutants. In vivo, U-20 significantly inhibited 
tumor growth, increased intratumoral CD8+ T-cell infiltration, and elevated 
effector cytokine levels, without apparent toxicity.
CONCLUSION: U-20 effectively reprograms the colorectal cancer immune 
microenvironment by blocking USP7-mediated PD-L1 stabilization, thereby 
restoring antitumor immunity. These findings provide a preclinical rationale for 
USP7 inhibition as a novel immunotherapeutic strategy for colorectal cancer, 
particularly in microsatellite-stable disease.

High-throughput sequencing reveals that organs once considered sterile, such as 
the endometrium, actually harbor distinct microbial communities. These 
organ-specific microbiota play critical roles in disease pathogenesis, including 
cancer. Nevertheless, defining a healthy endometrial microbiota remains 
challenging due to inconsistent compositional profiles reported across studies. 
Furthermore, although endometrial dysbiosis has been linked to endometrial 
cancer (EC), multiple confounding factors influence specific microbial 
signatures, and the causal relationship between these microbes and EC 
pathogenesis remains a topic of debate. This review aims to systematically 
examine current research on the endometrial microbiota, analyze the factors 
contributing to discrepancies in study findings, and elucidate the potential

BACKGROUND: Leptomeningeal metastases (LM) at initial diagnosis are a rare 
manifestation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), historically 
associated with poor survival and limited treatment options. With the 
introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and next-generation targeted 
therapies, treatment opportunities have expanded, but real-world data on 
patients with LM remain scarce.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all patients with NSCLC 
and baseline LM registered in the Netherlands Cancer Registry between 01-01-2017 
and 31-12-2023 was performed. Demographics, disease characteristics, treatment 
patterns, and survival outcomes were analyzed. Primary endpoint was overall 
survival (OS). Cox regression analyses were performed to assess prognostic 
factors.
RESULTS: A total of 259 patients were identified: 133 (51.4 %) received best 
supportive care (BSC), 27 (10.4 %) chemotherapy-only, 59 (22.8 %) (chemo-)ICI, 
and 40 (15.4 %) targeted therapy. At diagnosis, 44.8 % of patients had a WHO 
performance status of 0-1, 47.1 % were male, and 55.2 % were aged over 65 years. 
Almost all patients (91.5 %) had non-squamous histology. Median OS for BSC, 
chemotherapy, (chemo-)ICI, and targeted therapy was 1.3 months (95 % CI: 
1.0-1.5), 8.0 months (95 % CI: 4.8-11.3), 8.3 months (95 % CI: 5.2-11.3), and 
20.5 months (95 % CI: 16.7-24.3), respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed 
treatment group, cranial radiotherapy, and number of metastatic organs as 
independent predictors of OS. Targeted therapy provided the most favorable 
outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Systemic therapies can substantially improve survival in patients 
with NSCLC with LM at diagnosis and should therefore no longer be considered an 
automatic exclusion criterion for active treatment.

Lead (Pb) is an extremely toxic heavy metal that causes various health problems 
if contaminated in foodstuffs through any segment of the environment. Highly 
sensitive, selective, portable, low detection limit, low cost and efficient 
fluorescence-based chemosensors are of much demanding for the detection of heavy 
metal ions like Pb(II). Hence with, a new 1,2,3-triazole based probe was 
synthesized via a click reaction between terminal alkyne as 
1-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)indoline-2,3-dione and organic azide as 
2-azido-N-(1,5-dimethyl-3-oxo-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H- pyrazol-4-yl) acetamide. 
After successful characterization by FT-IR, NMR, and HR-MS data, absorption and 
emission response of the probe was examined using UV-Vis and fluorescence 
spectrum. The LOD and LOQ results (1.28 μM and 4.27 μM, respectively) indicated 
that the probe may be used for the detection of toxic Pb(II) ions. A 1:1 complex 
formation between the probe and metal ions as confirmed by Job's plot was 
supported by DFT results. Molecular docking showed its potential as an 
anticancer agent against Topoisomerase IIβ and results were fairly supported by 
in-vitro biological activity against the HepG2 human liver cancer cell line.

The prostate cancer Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) diagnostic kit in 
serum facilitates effective screening and monitoring of prostate cancer. 
However, it has limitations such as complex procedures, low sensitivity, 
single-signal readout, and susceptibility to inactivation. In this study, we 
developed a sensitive dual mode biosensor for prostate cancer diagnosis, 
combining a multifunctional nanoprobe with capillary enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (CLISA). The capillary, modified with capture antibodies, acts as a swab, 
integrating in situ trace sampling and the detection process, thereby 
eliminating the separation between sampling and detection in conventional ELISA. 
A multifunctional labeling biosensor was developed using a polydopamine (PDA) 
coating strategy with gold-platinum nanostars (AuNs@Pt) as the core. This newly 
designed biosensor simultaneously exhibits peroxidase-like activity and SERS 
(surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy) enhancement effect, meanwhile 
demonstrating excellent photothermal conversion efficiency up to 74.51 %. 
Furthermore, the PDA coating serves as a physical barrier that effectively 
inhibits oxidative deactivation of the metal nanoprobes, ensuring long-term 
stability of the biosensor. Under optimal conditions, the integrated 
nanoprobe-enhanced CLISA biosensor successfully achieved sensitive and specific 
detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA). The detection limit of the SERS 
mode is 0.07 pg/mL, while the detection limit of the photothermal mode is 
0.1 pg/mL, which are both much more sensitive than the detection limit of the 
ELISA diagnostic kit (3.5 pg/mL). Based on a double-blind study involving serum 
samples from 11 prostate cancer patients and 11 healthy donors, the proposed 
biosensor demonstrated the ability to well identify prostate cancer serum 
samples. This biosensor does not require complicated procedures, making it 
potential for at-home prostate cancer screening.

In this study, a series of Entadamide A (methylthio acrylamide) derivatives 
(3a-3x) have been designed and synthesized via Steglich esterification reaction 
with various cinnamic acids, long chain fatty acids, and benzoic acids. All 
these derivatives were systematically characterized (using NMR and Mass 
spectroscopy) and evaluated for their anticancer properties against various 
cancer cells. Among the compounds synthesized, long chain fatty acid derivatives 
(especially compounds 3u and 3x) manifested excellent anticancer properties 
against the breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7) with IC50 values of 2.82 μM and 
2.18 μM. Further mechanistic investigations demonstrated that compounds 3u and 
3x significantly induced apoptosis while downregulating anti-apoptotic gene 
expression and also markedly reduced the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) markers and stemness-associated genes. Functional assays 
confirmed that treatment with compounds 3u and 3x inhibited cell migration and 
sphere-forming capability in a dose-dependent manner. In 4T1-induced orthotopic 
mouse models, both compounds, 3u and 3x significantly suppressed tumor growth 
kinetics and reduced tumour volume compared to controls. The molecular docking 
study was performed to analyse the probable binding affinities of compounds with 
ABCB1, ABCG2 and Bmi1/Ring1B-UbcH5c ubiquitin ligase complex proteins. 
Collectively, these findings indicate that the Entadamide A derivatives 3u and 
3x exert potent anti-tumour activity in breast cancer models and provide a 
strong foundation for further translational development.

PURPOSE: This study aims to assess self-care (SC) levels in Italian cancer 
patients receiving Oral Anticancer Agents (OAAs) and to identify their 
predictors, stratified by sex.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis involving 518 cancer patients 
treated with OAAs across five Italian oncology centres. Sociodemographic, 
clinical, and psychosocial data (e.g., self-care, self-efficacy, social support, 
depression, patient-centredness, mutuality) were collected using validated 
instruments. Bayesian t-tests and sex-specific regression models were performed.
RESULTS: Among 518 cancer patients treated with OAAs, men had significantly 
higher SC management scores than women, while no significant sex differences 
were found in SC maintenance or monitoring. In men, self-efficacy, mutuality, 
and depressive state strongly predicted self-care domains. In women, 
self-efficacy and perception of centrality were key predictors.
CONCLUSION: Self-efficacy plays a key role in promoting SC behaviour in cancer 
patients under OAA. However, relational and perceptual factors - such as 
centrality, mutuality and social support - play a complementary role, modulated 
by sex and stage of the SC process. Such evidence suggests the usefulness of 
personalized interventions that enhance the psycho-social dimension and sex 
differences in promoting SC.

PURPOSE: Digital communication has transformed the landscape of psychosocial 
oncology information for survivors and professionals, potentially influencing 
the unmet informational needs and supports of cancer survivors and healthcare 
professionals. This study aims to explore the psychosocial oncology information 
on social media and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) using a topic 
modeling approach.
METHODS: A qualitative design incorporating structural topic modeling (STM) was 
utilized to analyze the psychosocial oncology information from social media 
(WeChat and Rednote) and GenAI (DeepSeek and ChatGPT). Social media data 
(n = 1177) were collected using the main keywords ""cancer"" and ""psychosocial"", 
while GenAI data were collected through nine standardized prompts. STM 
identified topic prevalence, keywords, topic relations, and temporal trends 
specific to social media posts.
RESULTS: Five topics were identified from social media, highlighting caregivers' 
reflection, psychological intervention and assessment, family dynamics, and 
pediatric cancer care. Sharing caregiving reflection as an emerging trend for 
social support. STM identified seven topics in DeepSeek and five in ChatGPT, 
commonly focusing on psychological distress, coping strategies and support 
systems, healthcare professional practices, and holistic care. DeepSeek 
demonstrated more critical reflection on survivorship challenges and 
psychosocial care barriers, but identified misinformation. Social media presents 
in-depth topics, whereas GenAI offers synthesized overviews. Help-seeking 
resources were limited across both sources.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings emphasized the significance of information strategies in 
psychosocial oncology care. GenAI should be fine-tuning/training with relevant 
data for improving practices. Social media and content creators are effective 
tools for promoting evidence-based information. A hybrid model that integrates 
professional oversight, GenAI, and cloud platforms is essential to ensure 
ethical compliance with psychosocial care.

PURPOSE: Adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) is a critical component of hormone 
receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer treatment, yet many patients do not start 
these medications. Patients from racial or ethnic minority communities are less 
likely to initiate AET and are at greater risk for poor breast cancer outcomes. 
Interventions are needed to increase AET initiation. The purpose of this study 
was to adapt an existing AET adherence intervention to enhance cultural 
sensitivity and target specific barriers that patients from minority communities 
are likely to experience.
METHODS: From 8/2021-6/2022, we developed a brief, behavioral, and culturally 
sensitive intervention by following two adaptation frameworks: the ADAPT 
Guidance and the Typology of Adaptation Model. Within these frameworks, we 
conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to understand the 
barriers and facilitators to AET initiation and intervention preferences in a 
diverse sample of patient stakeholders with HR + breast cancer (N = 10).
RESULTS: The finalized intervention (""INITIATE"") includes two evidence-based, 
nurse-led telehealth sessions delivered in the weeks preceding a patient's 
planned AET start date. Culturally sensitive content includes diverse 
representation in patient materials and vignettes, tailored psychoeducation 
regarding AET non-initiation and breast cancer disparities, and the translation 
and delivery of INITIATE in both English and Spanish.
CONCLUSIONS: Tailoring an existing intervention to address culturally relevant 
barriers to AET initiation is a crucial step in optimizing patient engagement, 
improving breast cancer outcomes, and reducing breast cancer disparities. We are 
currently conducting a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability 
of the INITIATE intervention. Clinical Trials Registration # (INITIATE pilot 
study) - NCT05465408.

INTRODUCTION: Colorectal peritoneal metastases (CRPM) and retroperitoneal 
lymphatic metastases (RLM) are each considered poor prognostic indicators in 
colorectal cancer (CRC). Current data suggests that surgery for each including 
cytoreductive surgery and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC) for 
CRPM and retroperitoneal resection (RR) for RLM may improve survival. Given the 
poor prognosis of each finding individually, each condition is generally 
considered a contraindication to the other. We describe the first series of 
combined RR and CRS/HIPEC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained 
tertiary institution database comparing perioperative and oncological outcomes 
of combined RR + CRS/HIPEC to CRS/HIPEC only in CRC.
RESULTS: Included 238 CRS/HIPEC and divided to 17 with RR + CRS/HIPEC and 221 
with CRS/HIPEC only. Demographic/perioperative characteristics were similar 
including tumor characteristics and peritoneal cancer index. Longer operative 
times observed in RR + CRS/HIPEC cohort (5 versus 4 h, p = 0.024). Complications 
were similar except more postoperative bleeding events and deep vein thrombosis 
in the RR + CRS/HIPEC cohort (24 % versus 5.0 %, p = 0.024 and 12 % versus 
2.3 %, p = 0.026, respectively). This did not translate to longer length of 
stay, reoperations, or major complications. Median disease free survival was 
shorter in the RR + CRS/HIPEC cohort (7.3 versus 11.3 months, p = 0.032), but 
similar overall survival observed (29.5 versus 43.9 months, p = 0.34). Less 
retroperitoneal recurrences occurred after regional lymphadenectomy (12 %) 
compared to mass only resection (44 %).
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the safety and oncological efficacy of 
RR + CRS/HIPEC. We believe that RR + CRS/HIPEC in highly selected patients is a 
suitable option and hope this leads to larger multi-institutional studies to 
corroborate these findings.

INTRODUCTION: Immuno-oncology (I-O) therapies have significantly improved 
survival outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, 
older patients, who account for a substantial proportion of NSCLC cases, are 
frequently underrepresented in clinical trials. The complexities of aging and 
associated comorbidities highlight the need for tailored treatment strategies in 
this population. This study aimed to evaluate mortality patterns and causes of 
death among older patients with advanced NSCLC before and after the introduction 
of I-O therapies in the United States, while also investigating factors 
associated with competing risks of NSCLC-specific and other cause-specific 
deaths in both periods.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the 
2012-2019 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. 
Patients aged 65 years or older with advanced NSCLC were included and classified 
into two cohorts based on their diagnosis date: pre-I-O (January 2013 - February 
2015) and post-I-O (March 2015 - December 2017). Mortality outcomes included 
deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD), NSCLC, and other causes. Predictors 
included sociodemographic factors (e.g., race, income level) and clinical 
factors (e.g., histology, surgery history, comorbidities). Competing risk 
analyses were conducted using the Fine-Gray model, while the cause-specific Cox 
model was employed for sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Among 51,612 patients (51 % male; mean age: 77 years), more than half 
of all deaths were attributed to NSCLC (pre-I-O: 60.32 %; post-I-O: 55.96 %). 
After adjusting for covariates, mortality from CVD (sub-distribution hazard 
ratio [sHR] = 0.81; 95 % CI: 0.72-0.90) and NSCLC (sHR = 0.80; 95 % CI: 
0.79-0.82) declined in the post-I-O period compared to the pre-I-O period. 
Comorbidities related to CVD, including peripheral vascular disease (sHR = 1.52 
in pre-I-O; sHR = 1.47 in post-I-O) and cerebrovascular disease (sHR = 1.47 in 
pre-I-O; sHR = 1.44 in post-I-O) were associated with significantly increased 
CVD mortality in both periods.
DISCUSSION: This study identified significant reductions in CVD- and 
NSCLC-related mortality during the post-IO period compared to the pre-IO period 
among older patients with advanced NSCLC. However, despite these improvements, 
our findings underscore the continued need to manage comorbidities and address 
socioeconomic disparities to optimize outcomes in geriatric oncology.

The essential oil of Cotula cinerea was subjected to gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, leading to the identification of 31 chemical 
constituents. The major compounds were selected for comprehensive computational 
investigations to explore their potential anti-colorectal cancer activity. Among 
the identified constituents, cis-verbenyl acetate (CVA) exhibited the most 
favorable binding affinities across a panel of fifteen protein targets 
implicated in colorectal cancer. Notably, Tankyrase1 (PDB ID: 4OA7) and 
Tankyrase2 (PDB ID: 4UFU) emerged as the most promising targets, with docking 
scores of -9.49 and -8.46 kcal/mol, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations 
conducted over 300 nanoseconds demonstrated the structural stability and 
sustained interactions of the CVA-protein complexes, characterized by low root 
mean square deviation (RMSD) values and limited conformational fluctuations. 
These findings were corroborated by molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann 
surface area (MM-PBSA) calculations, which revealed highly favorable binding 
free energies, particularly in the CVA- TNKS2 complex (ΔGtotal = 
-45.64 kcal/mol). In silico ADMET profiling indicated high oral bioavailability 
and low predicted toxicity for CVA compared to native ligands. Furthermore, 
density functional theory (DFT) analysis provided insight into the electronic 
properties of CVA, revealing a stable electronic configuration, suitable 
frontier molecular orbital energies, and a well-distributed electrostatic 
potential surface. Thermodynamic evaluations supported its chemical stability, 
showing a consistent increase in entropy, enthalpy, and heat capacity with 
rising temperature. Collectively, these computational findings suggest that CVA 
is a thermodynamically stable, pharmacokinetically favorable, and potentially 
bioactive compound with dual-target affinity against colorectal cancer-related 
proteins, meriting further experimental validation.

Orai family members are the pore-forming subunits of the Ca2+ release-activated 
Ca2+ (CRAC) channels that mediate store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), a major 
mechanism for Ca2+ influx controlled by the filling state of the intracellular 
Ca2+ stores, that regulates a variety of cellular processes. While Orai1 plays a 
predominant role in SOCE, in luminal breast cancer cells, such as the MCF-7 cell 
line, SOCE is strongly dependent on Orai3. Using Orai1-knockout (KO) MCF-7 cells 
or silencing the expression of Orai1 by RNAi in wild-type MCF-7 or T47D cells we 
show that Orai1 plays a relevant functional role in the regulation of Orai3 
expression, thus influencing SOCE. Transfection of Orai1-KO MCF-7 cells with 
Orai1α expression plasmid induces recovery of Orai1α that initially is not 
associated to changes in Orai3 protein levels or SOCE but after 7 days results 
in recovery of Orai3 protein content and SOCE. In Orai1-deficient MCF-7 cells, 
Orai3 protein synthesis was found to be attenuated, while Orai3 endo-lysosomal 
degradation was enhanced. Furthermore, Orai1 regulates the expression of 
estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), which has been associated to Orai3 expression in 
luminal breast cancer cells. Orai1 induces NFAT2 nuclear translocation in MCF-7 
cells and NFAT2 overexpression attenuates ERα and Orai3 protein content in cells 
expressing Orai1. Our findings show that Orai1 is functionally associated with 
sustaining Orai3 synthesis and stability and ERα expression in luminal breast 
cancer cells, consequently modulating the ERα-Orai3 axis, rather than acting as 
a primary SOCE component.

BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), a therapeutic target 
for advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers (GC/GEJCs), exists as 
two functionally distinct isoforms: FGFR2-IIIb and FGFR2-IIIc. We investigated 
the clinical significance of FGFR2 splice variant distribution in advanced 
GC/GEJCs and its implications for therapeutic targeting.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Whole-transcriptome sequencing was carried out on 235 
patients with advanced GC/GEJCs enrolled in MONSTAR-SCREEN-2 (UMIN000043899). 
FGFR2-IIIc proportion was quantified using splice junction analysis, and its 
association with clinical outcomes was evaluated through survival analysis, 
comprehensive molecular profiling, and longitudinal assessment of 
treatment-induced isoform dynamics.
RESULTS: Among 209 patients with detectable FGFR2 expression, high-proportion 
FGFR2-IIIc (>0.28) was associated with significantly shorter overall survival 
compared with low-proportion FGFR2-IIIc (median 9.59 versus 16.0 months, hazard 
ratio 2.08, 95% confidence interval 1.33-3.26, P < 0.001). Multivariable Cox 
regression confirmed FGFR2-IIIc proportion as an independent predictor of poor 
prognosis (P = 0.008), superior to total FGFR2 expression levels. Longitudinal 
analysis of 33 paired pre- and post-treatment samples revealed treatment-induced 
increases in FGFR2-IIIc proportion (P = 0.0085), suggesting adaptive isoform 
switching. Notably, all tumors with elevated FGFR2 expression exclusively 
belonged to the low-IIIc group, indicating that current FGFR2-targeted therapies 
primarily benefit patients with FGFR2-IIIb-dominant expression profiles. 
High-proportion FGFR2-IIIc was significantly associated with 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and myogenesis pathway activation. 
Differential splicing analysis identified coordinated alternative splicing 
events in ESRP1-regulated targets, suggesting potential broader splicing 
dysregulation and providing mechanistic insights into the aggressive phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: FGFR2-IIIc proportion represents a clinically relevant prognostic 
biomarker in advanced GC/GEJCs. Treatment-induced isoform switching toward 
FGFR2-IIIc suggests a novel resistance mechanism requiring targeted therapeutic 
approaches. These findings underscore the importance of developing 
isoform-specific therapeutic strategies and implementing FGFR2-IIIc assessment 
in precision oncology approaches for GC/GEJCs.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to develop prediction models for acute coronary events 
(ACE) following breast cancer (BC) radiation therapy (RT).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cohort included a development set (n = 4305) and an 
external set (n = 1503) of BC patients treated with postoperative RT 
(2005-2015). Cardiac dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters were obtained from 
three-dimensional CT-based planning. Multivariable cause-specific Cox regression 
models predicted ACE, accounting for overall mortality risk. Model 1 included 
seven clinical parameters, whole heart (WH)-Dmean, and left ventricle (LV)-V5. 
Model 2 replaced WH-Dmean and LV-V5 with cardiac DVH parameters offering higher 
prognostic value. Model 3 was built by testing whether the better-performing 
model was enhanced by adding left anterior descending artery DVH parameters, 
coronary artery calcium (CAC) volumes, or CAC DVH parameters. The incremental 
value of adding a parameter (or to compare models) was assessed using the 
likelihood ratio (LR) test. Internal validation was done via bootstrapping. An 
exploratory assessment of the models' performance in an external population was 
performed.
RESULTS: At ten years, the cumulative incidence of ACE was 4.8 % and 1.4 % in 
the development and external sets, respectively. Model 2, which included WH-D1, 
LV-V6, and right ventricle (RV)-V6, did not outperform Model 1 (LR p = 0.422). 
Consequently, further model improvement was pursued by expanding Model 1 rather 
than Model 2. The resulting Model 3 incorporated the parameters from Model 1 
along with the total CAC volume, significantly enhancing predictive performance 
(LR p < 0.001). At 10 years post-RT, each model had c-indexes above 0.73 at 
internal validation, with Model 3 performing best (c-index 0.78; 95 % CI, 
0.72-0.83) CONCLUSION: A model including seven clinical parameters, WH-Dmean, 
LV-V5, and total CAC volume best predicted ACE risk and may guide RT dose 
optimisation strategies.

PURPOSE: Caring for children with cancer imposes substantial emotional, 
physical, and social burdens on parents, profoundly impairing their 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Financial toxicity (FT), resulting from 
cancer-related expenses, is a critical yet understudied determinant of 
well-being in this population. This study aimed to explore the relationship 
between FT and HRQoL in parents of children with cancer.
METHODS: Employing a cross-sectional design, this study surveyed 318 parents of 
childhood cancer patients across three tertiary hospitals in China. Data were 
collected through a demographic questionnaire, the EQ-5D-5L profile, and the 
COmprehensive Score for financial Toxicity.
RESULTS: FT was reported by 95.3 % of parents, with a median score of 11.00 
(IQR: 7.00 to 16.25). Lower levels of FT were significantly associated with 
higher EQ-5D-5L utility values (r = 0.483, p < 0.001) and better visual analog 
scale scores (r = 0.822, p < 0.001). Hierarchical regression demonstrated that 
FT independently explained an additional 3.8 % of the variance in utility values 
(β = 0.246, p = 0.001) and 10.0 % in visual analog scale scores (β = 0.498, 
p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: FT emerged as a pervasive challenge for parents of children 
undergoing cancer treatment and was significantly associated with poorer HRQoL. 
Future studies should focus on designing and evaluating financial support 
efforts to alleviate FT and enhance HRQoL among this vulnerable population.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Routine FT assessments should be incorporated into 
supportive care for parents managing childhood cancer. Targeted financial 
policies and interventions are urgently needed to improve parental well-being.

The objective of this research was to establish an LC-MS/MS method with high 
sensitivity and selectivity for the quantification of cisplatin in human plasma, 
whole blood, and cervical cancer tissue samples. This approach employed 
diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) as a derivatizing agent for cisplatin, and analyte 
detection was conducted using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The 
method demonstrated lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) of 1 ng/mL for both 
plasma and tissue, while for whole blood, the LLOQ was determined to be 5 ng/mL. 
This method demonstrated remarkable linearity (R² >0.98), precision (coefficient 
of variation <15 %), accuracy (85 %-115 %), and minor matrix effects in all 
matrices. Stability assessments confirmed the robustness of the method under 
various conditions, including freeze-thaw cycles, short-term storage, and 
reinjection. Clinical samples from cervical cancer patients treated with 
intravenous 40 mg/m² cisplatin over 1 h revealed concentrations from below the 
LLOQ to 4250 ng/mL in plasma, 55-1673 ng/mL in whole blood, and 197-1613 ng/mL 
in tissue. The successful application of this method enables precise 
pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution studies of cisplatin, facilitating 
personalized dosing strategies to improve treatment outcomes for cervical cancer 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Circ-CCDC66 (circular-Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 66) has 
been implicated in therapy resistance in colorectal and gastric cancers, but its 
role in breast cancer remains poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the functional role and underlying 
mechanism of circ-CCDC66 in breast cancer proliferation and stem cell 
spheroidization.
METHODS: The circular structure of circ-CCDC66 was verified using agarose gel 
electrophoresis and Sanger sequencing. Gene expression was assessed by RT-qPCR. 
Functional assays, including CCK-8 (Cell Counting Kit-8), colony formation, flow 
cytometry, and spheroidization, were performed following circ-CCDC66 
overexpression in breast cancer cells. RNA sequencing and bioinformatics tools 
(LNCeVar, starBase, LncACTdb 2.0, Cytoscape) were used to construct a 
circ-CCDC66-miR-4259-CCDC66 regulatory network. Western blotting, luciferase 
reporter assays, and co-immunoprecipitation-qPCR (CO-IP-qPCR) were used to 
confirm molecular interactions.
RESULTS: Circ-CCDC66 was highly expressed in breast cancer tissues and cell 
lines, particularly in MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Overexpression of 
circ-CCDC66 significantly promoted breast cancer cell proliferation and stem 
cell spheroidization. Mechanistically, circ-CCDC66 acted as a molecular sponge 
for miR-4259, thereby upregulating CCDC66 expression. This regulatory axis was 
confirmed through luciferase and CO-IP-qPCR assays.
CONCLUSIONS: circ-CCDC66 promotes breast cancer progression by regulating the 
miR-4259/CCDC66 axis. This novel pathway may serve as a potential therapeutic 
target for breast cancer treatment.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of adjuvant intraperitoneal (IP) and 
intravenous (IV) chemotherapy with location and timing of recurrence in patients 
with advanced high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study includes patients with stage III or IV 
HGSOC who underwent optimal primary cytoreductive surgery (PCS) and subsequently 
received paclitaxel and platinum-based chemotherapy, either IP or IV, at a 
tertiary care institution between 2010 and 2020. We performed adjusted 
multivariable logistic regressions to evaluate locations of first recurrence, 
and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to assess the association of 
adjuvant chemotherapy administration and progression free survival.
RESULTS: 208 patients met inclusion criteria, of whom 152 (73 %) received IP and 
56 (27 %) received IV chemotherapy. IP chemotherapy was associated with 
decreased intraperitoneal recurrence (odds radio (OR) 0.33 (95 % confidence 
interval (CI) 0.17-0.64). Extraperitoneal disease at diagnosis was the only 
factor associated with increased extraperitoneal recurrence (OR 4.09 (95 % CI 
1.84-9.10)). Presence of lymph node disease at diagnosis and gross residual 
disease at PCS were associated with increased lymph node recurrence (OR 4.54 
(95 %CI 2.35-9.04) and OR 2.43 (95 %CI 1.18-5.11) respectively). After two 
years, the risk of recurrence was lower for patients who received IP, compared 
with IV, chemotherapy (HR 0.30 (95 % CI 0.17-0.53)).
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with HGSOC after optimal PCS, IP chemotherapy is 
associated with decreased intraperitoneal recurrence and decreased risk of 
recurrence after 2 years compared with IV chemotherapy. This highlights its 
value in peritoneal restricted disease.

BACKGROUND: Black women are more likely to die from endometrial cancer (EC) than 
White women, with staggering racial disparities that have worsened with rising 
disease incidence and mortality. Our study examined the impact of neighborhood 
socioeconomic status (nSES) on EC mortality among non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and 
non-Hispanic White (NHW) U.S. women to better understand this stark mortality 
gap.
METHODS: The U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-22 cancer 
registries database was queried for all NHW and NHB women diagnosed with 
malignant EC between 2006 and 2020. Age- and multivariable-adjusted Cox 
regression was used to evaluate the association between quintiles of census 
tract-level nSES and EC mortality.
RESULTS: In multivariable-adjusted models, NHW women in the lowest nSES quintile 
had higher EC mortality than their NHW counterparts in the highest nSES quintile 
(HR: 1.43, 95 % CI: 1.36-1.50). The association was largely attenuated for NHB 
patients in the lowest and highest nSES quintiles (HR: 1.08, 95 % CI: 
0.99-1.17). In common referent models, NHB patients in the highest SES 
neighborhoods had similar mortality (HR: 1.45, 95 % CI: 1.34-1.57) to NHW 
patients in the lowest SES neighborhoods (HR: 1.34, 95 % CI: 1.28-1.41).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that higher neighborhood SES is protective 
for White but not Black patients with EC. These data suggest that relative 
affluence is not enough to overcome other factors contributing to the worse EC 
survival experienced by Black women in the US. Our study demonstrates this 
phenomenon for the first time among US women diagnosed with EC using 
national-level data.

PURPOSE: To translate and cross-culturally adapt The Cancer Dyspnoea Scale - CDS 
into Brazilian Portuguese.
METHODS: The original instrument in English was translated by a Brazilian 
Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) and a Brazilian translator, both bilingual. 
The compiled version of the two translations was back-translated by a second SLP 
and a second translator, both bilingual, native English speakers, and fluent in 
Brazilian Portuguese. The final version was analyzed by a committee of experts, 
resulting in the final version of the Escala de Dispneia Oncológica - CDS-Br. It 
was pre-tested by applying the translated scale (with the additional option of 
responding ""not applicable"") to 40 cancer patients with dyspnea complaints - 35 
initial participants and another five to confirm subsequent adjustments.
RESULTS: None of the 35 initial study participants marked ""not applicable"" in 
the 12 scale items, but some questions were raised regarding the response keys, 
which were adapted after the committee of experts rediscussed them. Five new 
participants then responded to the scale to confirm the adjustments, without the 
need for further adaptations in the formulation of the items.
CONCLUSION: The translated and cross-culturally adapted version for Brazilian 
Portuguese was called Escala de Dispneia Oncológica - CDS-Br. Adjustments were 
necessary during translation and cross-cultural adaptation to reflect the 
original version and be compatible with the target language and culture. The 
Escala de Dispneia Oncológica - CDS-Br proved to be an easy-to-apply and 
understand self-assessment tool for dyspnea in cancer patients.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Realizar a tradução e adaptação transcultural da The Cancer 
Dyspnoea Scale - CDS para o Português Brasileiro (PB).
MÉTODO: O instrumento original em inglês foi traduzido por um fonoaudiólogo 
brasileiro e um tradutor brasileiro, ambos bilíngues. A versão compilada das 
duas traduções foi retrotraduzida por um segundo fonoaudiólogo e um segundo 
tradutor, ambos bilíngues, nativos do inglês e fluentes em Português Brasileiro. 
A versão final foi analisada por comitê de especialistas, elaborando-se uma 
versão final da Escala de Dispneia Oncológica - CDS-Br. Foi realizado pré-teste 
com a aplicação da escala traduzida, acrescida da opção de resposta “não 
aplicável” em 40 sujeitos oncológicos com queixa de dispneia, sendo 35 
participantes iniciais e cinco para confirmação de ajustes posteriores.
RESULTADOS: Dos 35 participantes iniciais do estudo, nenhum assinalou a opção 
“não aplicável” para os 12 itens da escala, porém foram observados 
questionamentos sobre as chaves de resposta, que foram rediscutidos pelo comitê 
de especialistas e adaptados. Em seguida, cinco novos participantes responderam 
a escala para a confirmação dos ajustes, sem necessidade de novas adaptações na 
formulação dos itens.
CONCLUSÃO: A versão traduzida e transculturalmente adaptada para o Português 
Brasileiro foi denominada Escala de Dispneia Oncológica - CDS-Br. No processo de 
tradução e adaptação transcultural foram necessários ajustes para que reflita a 
versão original e seja compatível com a língua e cultura alvo. A Escala de 
Dispneia Oncológica - CDS-Br mostrou ser um instrumento de fácil aplicação e 
compreensão para a autoavaliação da dispneia de pacientes oncológicos.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical-epidemiological profile of 
infantile-juvenile individuals diagnosed with head and neck cancer in Northeast 
Brazil from 1985 to 2017.
METHODS: Descriptive study based on data collected from the Brazilian Hospital 
Cancer Registry System. This study included all individuals diagnosed with head 
and neck cancer, aged between zero and 19 years, with records in the Federative 
Units of Northeast Brazil, from 1985 to 2017. The collected variables included 
sociodemographic characteristics, risk factors, and tumor's clinical 
characteristics. Frequency tables with respective percentages were used for 
qualitative variables while descriptive measures such as mean and standard 
deviation were adopted for quantitative variables. Data were descriptively 
analyzed using the software Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).
RESULTS: There were 500 cases of pediatric head and neck cancer, with more cases 
registered in Bahia (31.8%). The mean age of the individuals was 13.7±4.3 years. 
The majority were male (58.0%), non-white (80.4%), with incomplete elementary 
education (57.8%), and without a partner (94.2%). Most of them were non-smokers 
(70.3%), non-alcohol consumers (68.6%), and did not have a family history of 
cancer (66.8%). The most frequent histological type was squamous cell carcinoma 
(32.1%). Tumors were predominantly located in the nasopharynx (52.4%), staged as 
T4 (36.3%), N0 (40.7%), and M0 (90.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: Cases of head and neck cancer in the infantile-juvenile population 
were predominantly found in individuals from Bahia, male, aged between 12 and 16 
years, of non-white ethnicity, incomplete elementary education degree, without a 
partner, non-smokers, non-drinkers, and without a family history of cancer. The 
most affected anatomical region was the nasopharynx, with the most frequent 
histological type being squamous cell carcinoma.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of body composition 
parameters measured via computed tomography before and after neoadjuvant 
chemoradiotherapy in predicting pathological response in patients with locally 
advanced rectal cancer.
METHODS: Eighty-four patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent 
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by curative surgery were retrospectively 
analyzed. Computed tomography images obtained before and after neoadjuvant 
chemoradiotherapy were used to assess total adipose area, visceral adipose 
tissue, subcutaneous adipose tissue, adipose tissue density, psoas muscle area, 
psoas muscle density, and mesorectal adipose volume and density at the level of 
the L3 vertebra. Pathological response was determined using the Ryan Tumor 
Regression Grade system. Baseline values and percentage changes (Δ) during 
treatment were compared between response groups.
RESULTS: Of the 84 patients, 31 (36.9%) showed a pathological response. There 
were no significant differences in demographic or clinical features between the 
groups. Among baseline body composition metrics, only psoas muscle density was 
significantly higher in the response group (p=0.015). Post-treatment analysis 
revealed a significant difference only in the percentage change in psoas muscle 
density (ΔPMD) (p=0.023). No other baseline or percentage change values for 
total adipose area, subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue, 
mesorectal adipose volume, or psoas muscle area were significantly associated 
with pathological response (p>0.05).
CONCLUSION: In patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, neither abdominal 
adipose composition nor mesorectal adipose volume nor psoas muscle area was 
predictive of response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. However, psoas muscle 
density, a potential indicator of muscle quality, may serve as a promising 
biomarker for predicting pathological response based on both baseline value and 
treatment-induced changes.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative care after McKeown esophagectomy remains challenging. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate retrograde gastric decompression and 
feeding as an alternative to nasogastric decompression and nasogastric-jejunal 
feeding.
METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed 142 esophageal cancer patients 
undergoing McKeown esophagectomy (between June 2020 and August 2022): retrograde 
gastric decompression and feeding (n=74) vs. nasogastric-jejunal (n=68). 
Outcomes included operative parameters, complications, and recovery metrics.
RESULTS: Retrograde gastric decompression and feeding required longer operative 
time (183.0±41.7 vs. 169.4±32.6 min, p=0.031) but showed comparable blood loss, 
R0 resection rates (95.9 vs. 97.1%), and lymph node yield. Gastric tube 
retention was shorter with retrograde gastric decompression and feeding (3.2±1.6 
vs. 3.6±1.4 days). Complication rates (anastomotic leak: 10.8 vs. 10.3%; 
respiratory: 16.2 vs. 16.2%) and in-hospital mortality (1.4 vs. 1.5%) were 
similar. Tube-related complications trended lower with retrograde gastric 
decompression and feeding (5.4 vs. 10.3%, p=0.276).
CONCLUSION: Retrograde gastric decompression and feeding is a safe, effective 
method for enteral nutrition and decompression post-esophagectomy.

BACKGROUND: The late diagnosis of gastric cancer, which is usually diagnosed via 
upper digestive endoscopy, may be attributed to the failure to detect precursor 
lesions. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of gastric cancer and its 
precursor lesions in individuals undergoing routine upper gastrointestinal 
endoscopies at a tertiary hospital in Brazil.
METHODS: Patients aged >40 years who had undergone diagnostic endoscopic 
examinations in 2017 at our institution were included in this retrospective 
cross-sectional study. We exclude patients with more than one examination in the 
time-period, without gastric biopsies, and those with autoimmune atrophic 
gastritis and history of gastric surgery. The histopathological findings were 
reviewed by two gastrointestinal pathologists. The Operative Link on Gastritis 
Assessment (OLGA) classification was used in cases wherein gastric mapping was 
performed. Descriptive statistical analysis for the diagnostic findings of the 
malignant precursor lesions and gastric cancer was performed using Chi-square 
test. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05.
RESULTS: Among the 1,071 patients (64.6% females; age 60±10.4 years old) who 
underwent endoscopic examinations, 277 (25.9%) were diagnosed with malignant 
precursor lesions or cancer, three (0.3%) dysplastic lesions, and 12 (1.1%) 
neoplasms. A total of 888 patients underwent gastric mapping; OLGA III and IV 
stages were observed in 46 (5.2%) patients. Chi-square test revealed significant 
correlations between dysplastic and neoplastic lesions and male sex, age >80 
years and the prevalence of chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal 
metaplasia, and age 40-49 years and the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori 
infection.
CONCLUSION: Precursor lesions for gastric cancer were observed in up to 25% of 
the patients, with a predominance of low-risk lesions. Further prospective 
studies must be conducted to evaluate the risk of gastric cancer in individuals 
with precursor lesions and formulate prevention strategies.

DNA aptamers are single-stranded DNA molecules with three-dimensional structures 
that enable high-affinity and specific binding to target molecules, offering 
significant potential for precision medicine. Recent advances in DNA 
nanotechnology have allowed the fabrication of aptamer-guided framework nucleic 
acid delivery platforms with controllable size and valence. While these 
platforms have improved tumor delivery in drug delivery, the effects of size and 
valence on delivery efficacy have not been well studied, particularly in the 
context of radionuclide-based molecular imaging and therapy. Herein, we 
fabricate a series of radionuclide-labeled anti-PTK7 aptamer-guided tetrahedron 
framework nucleic acid delivery platforms (Apt-tFNAs) with varying sizes and 
valencies. These Apt-tFNAs are well-characterized, and their cell-specific 
binding ability is demonstrated to be dependent on size and valence. Further in 
vivo study via dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) scanning reveals that 
smaller-sized tFNAs improve tumor uptake and reduce liver and kidney retention 
when valence remains constant. Finally, a single aptamer-modified tFNA with an 
edge length of 17 bp presents the best tumor delivery efficacy and effective 
therapeutic performance when combined with either chemotherapy or immunotherapy. 
This study elucidates how controllable size and valence influence delivery 
efficacy and introduces optimized Apt-tFNA constructs as promising agents for 
enhancing targeted therapeutic outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is frequently reported 
during cancer treatment, with 35% of patients experiencing cognitive issues even 
after treatment completion. Commonly reported impairments include difficulties 
with memory, attention, executive function, and processing speed, which often 
reduce daily functioning and quality of life (QoL). Despite its prevalence, CRCI 
remains underresearched across various cancer types, limiting understanding of 
the patient experience.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to synthesize the qualitative evidence regarding the 
lived experience of CRCI across cancer types. It seeks to do so by exploring how 
commonly CRCI is subjectively experienced among cancer populations. It also aims 
to explore the cognitive domains perceived as most affected and the impact on 
QoL and functional ability.
METHODS: We conducted a qualitative systematic review using the PRISMA 
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 
methodology. A comprehensive search across PubMed, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, and 
Scopus for studies published from 2013 through July 2025 was performed. Articles 
addressing the experience of CRCI using qualitative or mixed methods were 
included. Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, 
with a third reviewer resolving conflicts during the inclusion process. Two 
reviewers piloted the data extraction process by discussing and selecting 10% of 
the studies. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist was used for data 
extraction and quality assessment. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: The database search identified 11,269 papers; 51 were included for 
analysis. Breast cancer was the most represented cancer type (n=32). The 
analysis revealed 4 themes. ""Cognitive challenges"" explores the impacted 
cognitive domains such as memory, concentration, executive functions, language, 
and processing speed; ""navigating employment"" discusses challenges associated 
with return to work, support, and disclosure; ""emotional, behavioral, and 
psychological impacts"" explores emotional and psychological responses; and 
""support systems"" emphasizes the role of social and health care support. CRCI 
negatively affects QoL and functional ability, and there is lack of 
understanding and resources in place to manage its effects.
CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative systematic review highlights the significant 
disruption of CRCI in daily life, stressing the need for increased awareness, 
standardized screening, and further research into digital interventions. 
Improved management of CRCI can support survivors of cancer in reintegrating 
into their daily lives and employment.

OBJECTIVES: Ground-glass opacity component is a favourable prognostic factor in 
non-small cell lung cancer, whereas non-small cell lung cancer with interstitial 
lung abnormalities generally has poorer prognoses. We investigated the clinical 
significance of ground-glass opacity in patients with non-small cell lung cancer 
and interstitial lung abnormalities.
METHODS: Among 1319 patients who underwent pulmonary resection for clinical 
stage IA non-small cell lung cancer at two institutions between 2010 and 2020, 
we retrospectively assessed 216 patients with interstitial lung abnormalities 
based on preoperative computed tomography. Patients were divided into two 
groups: pure solid tumors without ground-glass opacity and subsolid tumors with 
ground-glass opacity.
RESULTS: Among 216 patients with interstitial lung abnormalities, 146 (68%) had 
pure solid tumors, and 70 (32%) had subsolid tumors. Subsolid tumors had 
significantly better prognoses than pure solid tumors (5-year overall survival, 
69.7% vs 48.6%, P = 0.0008; 5-year recurrence-free survival, 69.7% vs 42.3%, P 
<0.0001). Recurrence occurred in 4 patients (6%) with subsolid tumors and 41 
(28%) with pure solid tumors. Although the 5-year cumulative incidence of lung 
cancer deaths was significantly lower in subsolid tumors than in those with pure 
solid tumors (2.6% vs 23.6%, P = 0.0011), an increase in other causes of 
mortality after 2 years post-surgery in subsolid tumors resulted in a comparable 
5- year cumulative incidence of other causes of death (28.4% vs 36.1%, P = 
0.260).
CONCLUSIONS: In clinical stage IA non-small cell lung cancer with interstitial 
lung abnormalities, subsolid tumors have a lower lung cancer mortality than pure 
solid tumors; however, higher other-cause mortality after 2 years contributes to 
poorer overall survival. Optimizing comorbidity management may improve long-term 
prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Cancer-related cognitive impairment is a significant concern, yet 
data assessing long-term changes from pre-treatment baselines are limited.
METHODS: In this large nationwide study, patients with breast cancer and 
lymphoma and controls were assessed at pre-chemotherapy, post-chemotherapy, 
6-month, and 1- and 2-year follow-ups. Cognitive function was measured using 
self-reported and performance-based assessments. The analysis included 225 
participants: breast cancer (41 patients/36 controls) and lymphoma (73 
patients/75 controls). Cognitive trajectories were estimated using longitudinal 
linear mixed models, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and psychosocial 
factors. A minimal clinically important difference cut-off identified changes 
over time in perceived cognitive impairment.
RESULTS: Patients with breast cancer reported greater cognitive complaints than 
controls, with declines in FACT-Cog Total (β = -17.17, p < .001), Perceived 
Cognitive Impairment (β = -11.09, p < .001), and Perceived Cognitive Abilities 
(β = -3.60, p = .03) from pre-chemotherapy to 2-year follow-up. Declines were 
observed in memory (RAVLT Immediate Recall: β = -1.53, p = .04), and executive 
function (phone fluency: β = -1.53, p = .02) at 1 year. Patients with lymphoma 
also showed more complaints, with declines in Perceived Cognitive Impairment (β 
= -6.19, p = .01), poorer RAVLT Immediate (β = -1.62, p < .001), Delayed Recall 
(β = -1.72, p < .001), and phone fluency (β = -2.46, p < .001) from 
pre-chemotherapy to 1-year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Compared to controls, patients with breast cancer and lymphoma 
showed persistent cognitive worsening up to 1-year post-treatment, and patients 
with breast cancer reported perceived impairment at two years compared to 
controls.

PURPOSE: Comprehensive, multidisciplinary care is crucial for managing 
early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), typically treated via lung 
resection or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). We evaluated how 
variable access to on-site SBRT may be associated with clinical outcomes for 
patients with stage I NSCLC receiving surgical resection within an integrated 
healthcare system.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with stage I 
NSCLC treated with lung resection at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) 
facilities between 2006 and 2016. The VHA provides thoracic surgery at 
approximately 100 facilities, whereas lung SBRT is currently available at 
approximately 20 facilities. We compared short- and long-term outcomes for 
patients treated at surgery-only facilities versus those at facilities offering 
surgery and SBRT.
RESULTS: We identified 6,289 patients undergoing lung resection, with 4,673 
(74.3%) treated at surgery-only sites and 1,616 (25.7%) at surgery+SBRT sites. 
Sociodemographic factors were similar between cohorts. Surgery+SBRT sites showed 
higher adherence to operative quality metrics and improved patient selection. 
Short-term outcomes were better at surgery+SBRT sites with lower rates of 30-day 
major complications, 30-day mortality, and 90-day mortality. With a median 
follow-up of 6.3 years, 5-year overall survival was higher at surgery+SBRT sites 
(59.4% vs. 56.9%; adjusted hazard ratio 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.23).
CONCLUSION: Short- and long-term outcomes were better for patients with stage I 
NSCLC who underwent lung resection at facilities delivering thoracic surgery and 
SBRT. These findings support recommendations to increase SBRT availability at 
medical centers offering lung resection to ensure comprehensive 
multidisciplinary care is provided.

PURPOSE: Clinical trials play an important role in the advancement of breast 
cancer detection and treatment, in turn improving patient outcomes. However, 
less than 20% of eligible patients participate in clinical trials. Understanding 
patient perspectives regarding their decision is critical for identifying and 
addressing barriers to improve trial accessibility and engagement.
METHODS: This qualitative content analysis used semistructured interviews with 
21 female patients with breast cancer who were eligible for and declined 
clinical trial participation from July 2020 to January 2024. Interviews were 
conducted via Zoom, transcribed verbatim, and open coding was used to develop 
the codebook with NVivo V14 software. Transcribed interviews were coded 
deductively by two independent reviewers. Thematic saturation was achieved.
RESULTS: Of 21 patients, 43% and 57% declined participation in therapeutic and 
nontherapeutic trials, respectively. Three major themes with associated 
subthemes emerged as key reasons for declining participation: (1) fear, 
including fear of the unknown, concerns about side effects and potential costs 
associated, and skepticism regarding trial medication effectiveness; (2) 
mistrust, regarding medical research, historical injustices, and pharmaceutical 
companies; and (3) additional burdens of trial participation, such as time 
commitment, travel constraints, financial concerns, and existing health-related 
challenges.
CONCLUSION: Declining participation in clinical trials is complex and 
multifactorial. The most cited reasons for declining participation included 
fear, mistrust, and logistical burdens. These findings highlight the importance 
of developing targeted strategies to address both emotional and logistical 
barriers, particularly for vulnerable populations, ensuring that research 
outcomes are representative, equitable, and generalizable to all patients.

ObjectivesCancer screening among older adults above 75 years of age is frequent 
despite generally not being recommended in evidence-based guidelines. We aimed 
to describe trends in prostate, cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer 
screening after the age of 75.SettingThis descriptive cross-sectional study 
analysed the 2007, 2012, 2017, and 2022 waves of the nationwide population-based 
Swiss Health Survey. Residents of Switzerland were invited through 
state-stratified multistage probability sampling.MethodsFor each wave, we 
calculated weighted overall and sex- and age-stratified proportions of any, 
prostate, cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer screening in the past 12 
months explicitly for preventive non-symptomatic purposes among older adults 
above 75 years of age.ResultsAnalytical sample sizes ranged from 1450 (2007) to 
2276 (2022). Across waves, populations aged and had increasing education levels. 
Over time, any cancer screening in the past 12 months was undertaken by one in 
four older adults aged above 75 (25.4% in 2007; 24.3% in 2022), where 
proportions were persistently higher among men (31.8% in 2007; 28.3% in 2022) 
than women (21.3% in 2007; 20.8% in 2022). In all waves, screening decreased 
with increasing age (2022: 29.7% among people aged 76-80, 14.8% among people 
aged 86 years and above). Prostate cancer screening decreased from 26.0% (2007) 
to 21.0% (2022), with no substantial changes for other screening 
types.ConclusionsCancer screening after the age of 75 has been frequent and 
stable across time despite not being recommended, emphasising the need for 
further evidence on screening effectiveness and harms among older adults.

Updates and Review of Neoadjuvant Therapy for Resectable Pancreatic Cancer.

Cobb W, Rozefort D, Ji C, Sehgal S, Rosales A, Sehgal R.

IMPORTANCE: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a disease process that carries 
high morbidity and mortality and is suspected to supplant colorectal cancer as 
the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. 
Resectable disease is considered no tumor contact with the celiac axis, common 
hepatic artery, or superior mesenteric artery and less than 180-degrees contact 
with portal vein or superior mesenteric vein. The current standard of care for 
resectable disease is surgery.
OBSERVATIONS: There is an ongoing paradigm shift to consider neoadjuvant therapy 
for initially resectable disease and this review aims to summarize the updates 
in neoadjuvant therapy for resectable pancreatic cancer. We performed a 
literature search of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) for resectable pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma and reviewed pertinent literature for current treatment regimens, 
clinical trials comparing NAT to upfront resection, and other modalities in the 
treatment of PDAC.
CONCLUSIONS: Retrospective studies, recent completed prospective studies, and 
ongoing trials are showing an increased consideration for NAT for resectable 
PDAC compared with upfront surgery. Additionally, immunotherapy, cell therapy, 
and matrix-depleting therapy are promising new avenues in the treatment of 
pancreatic cancers.

Covalent inhibitors that are approved and marketed drugs exploit a wide array of 
warheads and reactions with amino acid side chain-based nucleophiles. 
Thiostrepton (TS) inhibits the peroxidase activity of the mitochondrial 
antioxidant protein peroxiredoxin 3 by forming a covalent crosslink between the 
two active site cysteine residues. Peroxiredoxin 3 inactivation increases 
reactive oxygen species levels, induces cancer cell death in preclinical models, 
and shows promise in an ongoing clinical trial for malignant mesothelioma using 
direct pleural infusion. We report the identification of the minimal fragment of 
TS that contains tandem dehydro-alanine (DHA) moieties and maintains anticancer 
activity while losing interactions with three alternative targets of intact TS. 
Biochemical, kinetic, cellular, and structural studies demonstrate that this 
fragment is a mechanism-based peroxiredoxin inhibitor. These findings represent 
a promising start toward a pro-oxidant approach for cancer therapy. Moreover, 
the data support that the DHA moiety should be added to the covalent warhead 
arsenal.

Lung cancer survivors experience multiple concurrent symptoms after cancer 
treatments. However, the majority of symptom research has focused on assessing 
and managing individual symptoms. Furthermore, little is known about the risk 
factors and adverse outcomes of complex symptoms in lung cancer survivors. The 
purpose of the study was to: (1) identify symptom profiles in lung cancer 
survivors; (2) determine influencing factors of the symptom profiles; and (3) 
examine differences in health outcomes among the symptom profiles. A 
cross-sectional secondary analysis of data from the Measuring Your Health 
(MY-Health) study was conducted with 526 lung cancer survivors. Symptom profiles 
were identified using latent profile analysis based on four patient-reported 
symptoms (pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depression) with custom PROMIS® 
short forms. We conducted multinomial logistic regression analysis to determine 
influencing factors of the symptom profiles and multivariate analysis of 
variance to examine differences in physical function and social function among 
the symptom profiles. Four latent class symptom profiles were identified: (1) 
Within Normal Limits (Class 1), (2) Pain with Fatigue and Sleep Disturbance 
(Class 2), (3) Depression with Fatigue and Sleep disturbance (Class 3), and (4) 
All High Symptom Burden (Class 4). Age, income, employment status, and number of 
comorbidities were the influencing factors of the symptom profiles. There were 
significant differences in physical function and social function among the 
symptom profiles. This study found that the influencing factors of the symptom 
profiles in lung cancer survivors tended to be more sociodemographic in nature, 
rather than clinical. Researchers and healthcare providers use findings such as 
these when establishing symptom management strategies for lung cancer survivors 
by integrating demographic and socioeconomic determinants of health in 
conjunction with targeted clinical variables.

INTRODUCTION: Radiotherapy is a primary treatment for intermediate and advanced 
cervical cancer (CC). Resistance to radiotherapy is a principal reason for 
treatment failure in synchronous applications, yet the molecular mechanisms 
remain poorly understood. Identifying reliable prognostic markers to predict and 
evaluate patient outcomes is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies. 
This study aims to address this need by developing a prognostic prediction model 
for concurrent radiotherapy in CC, utilizing both single-cell RNA sequencing 
(scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA sequencing data.
METHODS: The research began by screening for co-expressed genes using samples 
from two GEO datasets (GSE236738 and GSE56363). To pinpoint target genes that 
exhibit significant co-expression, both univariate and multivariate Cox 
regression analyses were conducted, facilitating the development of prognostic 
prediction models. The clinical significance of these models was confirmed 
through the analysis of 144 CC samples sourced from the TCGA database, utilizing 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves, ROC curve analyses, and Spearman's correlation 
tests to investigate the relationships between gene expression and the levels of 
immune cell infiltration. IHC assays were conducted to further validate the 
prognostic potential of the identified target genes in CC patients.
RESULTS: Prognostic models for four target genes-MPP5, SNX7, LSM12, and 
GALNT3-showed significant predictive value for the outcomes of CC patients 
undergoing radiotherapy, as demonstrated using the GSE236738 and GSE56363 
datasets. The prognostic efficacy of the model was illustrated through scatter 
plots and calibration curves. Additionally, the model exhibited significant 
associations with tumor immune infiltration, immune checkpoints, and 
chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on clinical tumor 
samples confirmed that the protein expression levels of MPP5, SNX7, LSM12, and 
GALNT3 were distinctively predictive for CC patients.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that MPP5, SNX7, LSM12, and GALNT3 are 
significantly associated with radiotherapy sensitivity in CC cells. A prognostic 
risk model based on these genes demonstrated strong predictive capabilities for 
patient outcomes in radiotherapy, suggesting these genes as effective predictors 
and potential therapeutic targets for treating CC.

Sweet syndrome, or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis is an inflammatory 
condition that may be idiopathic, paraneoplastic, parainflammatory, or drug 
associated. Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors have been implicated in Sweet 
syndrome. Herein, we describe a patient with nonsmall cell lung cancer who 
 developed Sweet syndrome in the setting of the immune checkpoint inhibitor, 
pembrolizumab. We also include a discussion of current literature of immune 
checkpoint inhibitors-induced Sweet syndrome and the histopathologic 
differential diagnosis of Sweet syndrome.

BACKGROUND: Lung and Bronchus cancer is the most fatal type of cancer in the 
United States. According to the American Cancer Society, there were more than 
127,000 deaths from lung cancer in 2023. Lung cancer care cost 23.8 billion 
dollars in 2020. In Texas, only 22.8% of lung cancer patients survived 5 years 
or more past diagnosis based on 2012-2018 data.
AIM: This study evaluates the survival length of lung and bronchus cancer 
patients in Texas using advanced statistical and machine learning methods 
applied to an 11-year cohort study from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results Program. It also quantifies the causal effect of early (localized) 
versus late (distant) stage at diagnosis on survival time of those patients. 
Additionally, it explores the influence of demographic and available clinical 
factors to assess disparities in survival across different groups.
METHODOLOGY: We performed classical survival analyses, followed by causal 
survival analysis to study the average years lost among different patient 
groups. Additionally, we performed survival random forest and survival neural 
network modeling. Finally, we conducted causal inference and causal survival 
random forest to estimate and predict the average treatment effect of 
early-stage diagnosis on lung cancer patient survival.
RESULTS: Stage and age are the two most important factors in predicting the 
survival of patients with lung and bronchus cancer. Lung cancer patients 
diagnosed with the regional stage have about twice the risk of dying as those in 
the localized stage at any time, and this risk increases as the stage advances. 
We also find that the average extended lifetime of the localized stage group was 
about 4 years compared to survivors diagnosed with the distant stage. It can 
also extend the probability of survival by up to 50%.
CONCLUSION: Our study underscores the need for early screening, diagnosis and 
improving equity in lung cancer patients care, which could lead to improved 
outcomes and reduced mortality in this high-risk population.
IMPACT: Understanding lung and bronchus cancer survival using advanced causal 
inference and predictive modeling techniques, highlights the critical importance 
of early-stage diagnosis, showing that patients diagnosed at localized stages 
have a substantially higher survival probability. This research underscores the 
necessity of promoting early screening and equitable cancer care to improve 
survival rates and healthcare outcomes for lung and bronchus cancer patients.

Interstitial fluid reflects both the organ microenvironment and tumor milieu; 
however, its direct study in vivo remains technically challenging. Here, we 
present a protocol for using murine interstitial fluid extract from lungs of 
metastasis-bearing mice as a model to recapitulate the metastatic environment ex 
vivo. This protocol outlines steps for cell preparation, tail vein injection, ex 
vivo tissue processing, and incubation, followed by detailed procedures for 
interstitial fluid isolation, in vitro cell treatment, and RNA sequencing 
(RNA-seq) analysis.

Despite the clinical success of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in cancer 
therapy, its efficacy against ""cold"" tumors like triple-negative breast cancer 
(TNBC) remains limited due to low immunogenicity and an immunosuppressive 
microenvironment. Emerging evidence suggests activating the cGAS-STING pathway 
to enhance antigen presentation is an effective strategy to turn TNBC from 
""cold"" to ""hot"". Herein, we developed a nanodrug MnO@PPC-aPD-1 that incorporates 
MnO nanoparticles and anti-PD-1 antibodies (aPD-1) to overcome these 
limitations. The MnO@PPC-aPD-1 exploits T cell homing through surface-conjugated 
aPD-1 for tumor-specific delivery. Upon reaching the acidic tumor 
microenvironment (TME), the system releases aPD-1 to block immune checkpoints 
while simultaneously activating the cGAS-STING pathway in both antigen 
presenting cells and tumor cells via MnO@PPC. This dual action not only enhances 
antigen presentation but also suppresses immunosuppressive signals including 
ENPP1, NLRC3, and non-canonical NF-κB, effectively converting ""cold"" tumors to 
""hot"". The treatment establishes a positive feedback loop by recruiting and 
activating tumor-infiltrating T cells, while generating memory T cells to 
prevent metastasis and recurrence. Our findings provide mechanistic insights 
into tumor immunogenicity modulation and demonstrate a promising approach for 
enhancing ICB efficacy in poorly immunogenic cancers. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: 
Inadequate immune activation and lack of specific targets hinder effective 
immunotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Here, we developed a 
tumor-agnostic delivery system-a T cell-hitchhiking nanodrug (MnO@PPC-aPD-1). 
This system leverages T cell homing via surface-conjugated aPD-1 for 
tumor-specific delivery, responding to the mildly acidic tumor microenvironment 
to release aPD-1 for checkpoint blockade. Concurrently, MnO@PPC activates the 
cGAS-STING pathway in both antigen-presenting cells and tumor cells. This dual 
mechanism not only enhances antigen presentation but also suppresses 
immunosuppressive signals (including ENPP1, NLRC3, and non-canonical NF-κB), 
effectively converting ""cold"" tumors to ""hot."" The therapy establishes a 
self-reinforcing cycle by recruiting and activating tumor-infiltrating T cells 
while generating memory T cells to prevent metastasis and recurrence.

High Sensitivity Sensor based on Bound State in the Continuum in Detection for 
Cancer Cells.

Cao Y, Shen L, Liu H, Ge W, Huang W, Zhang Y, Chen J, Huang P, Hou D, Zhang G.

Although terahertz (THz) metasurfaces based on bound states in the continuum 
(BIC) have garnered significant attention in biomedical applications, their 
technical implementation in high-sensitivity cancer cells detection remains a 
critical challenge. In this work, we present a THz biosensor employing dual 
split-ring resonator (DSRR) arrays quasi-bound states in the continuum (Q-BIC). 
Numerical simulations reveal a high-Q resonance dip at 2.35 THz with a detection 
sensitivity of 522 GHz/RIU. Experimentally, the performance was validated by 
detecting normal cells (murine splenocytes) and three cancer cell lines (LLC, 
LoVo, and MC38). In addition, analysis of cell type discrimination was achieved 
by integrating machine learning algorithms to project high dimensional spectral 
data into a low-dimensional space. This study establishes a label-free approach 
for long-term cellular monitoring, advancing THz technology as an innovative 
platform for practical biomedical applications.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer are a 
vulnerable population affected by disparities in survivorship care access. These 
disparities are pronounced in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) but exist 
even within high-income settings, affecting vulnerable and underserved groups. 
This expert review explores disparities in fertility preservation, psychosocial 
health, nutritional care, cardiovascular health, and secondary malignancies of 
AYA survivorship.
RECENT FINDINGS: Fertility preservation services are often inaccessible due to 
high costs, limited provider training and knowledge, cultural stigma, and 
urban-centric availability, especially in LMICs. Psychosocial distress is 
widespread, exacerbated by structural barriers, stigma, and mental health 
service scarcity. Nutritional disparities lead to malnutrition and obesity, with 
food insecurity and limited access to high-quality diets affecting treatment 
outcomes. Cardiovascular complications, including physical inactivity, are 
usually under-monitored, despite growing recognition of exercise as an essential 
part of survivorship. Approaches to standardize the monitoring of secondary 
malignancies are needed.
SUMMARY: These gaps reflect broader disparities, including limited 
infrastructure, lack of provider training, and absence of culturally tailored 
care models. Global organizations such as the Multinational Association of 
Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) can support the integration of 
resource-adapted, patient-centered supportive care guidelines into existing 
health systems. Addressing the complex and interrelated barriers faced by AYA 
survivors can improve survivorship outcomes and promote more equitable access to 
high-quality care.

Gastric cancer is a prevalent and clinically significant gastrointestinal 
malignancy worldwide. Gastric cancer is characterized by limited treatment 
efficacy and a high recurrence rate. In this study, we found that LGALS9 was 
highly expressed in gastric cancer and may contribute to disease progression by 
modulating the infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Genetic knockout of LGALS9 reversed 
T cell function, attenuated immunosuppression, and enhanced the cytotoxic 
activity of T cells to kill gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, miR-491-5p was 
identified as a potential suppressor in gastric cancer. The microRNA miR-491-5p 
regulated T cell-mediated immunity by targeting and inhibiting LGALS9, which was 
similar to the effect of LGALS9 knockout. Overall, the key target LGALS9 and its 
inhibitor miR-491-5p represent promising potential for treating gastric cancer.

BACKGROUND: ADAM12, a member of the disintegrin and metalloproteinase family, 
has been involved in multiple cancers, yet its precise role in pan-cancer 
progression still remains elusive.
METHODS: In our current study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of ADAM12 
expression, diagnosis, prognosis, genomic variations, DNA methylation, 
functional enrichment, immune infiltration as well as immunotherapy in 
pan-cancer utilizing public datasets. Additionally, a series of biological 
functional experiments of ADAM12 were performed in gastric cancer cells 
including cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation, wound healing analysis, 
and Transwell analyses.
RESULTS: ADAM12 expression was prominently elevated and correlated with 
unfavorable prognosis in most cancer types. It exhibited elevated mutation 
frequency and a negative correlation with DNA methylation promoters across 
various tumors. ADAM12 expression strongly linked to ESTIMATE, immune/stromal 
scores, immune checkpoint genes, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite 
instability (MSI) in specific cancer types. Single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing 
analysis revealed heightened ADAM12 levels in fibroblasts, highlighting its 
importance in tumor immunity. Furthermore, the predictive value of immunotherapy 
surpassed that of tumor mutational burden based on TIDE. Functional enrichment 
analysis associated ADAM12 with focal adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling, and 
ECM-receptor interactions. In vitro experiments confirmed that ADAM12 
downregulation significantly impeded proliferation, migration, and invasion of 
gastric cancer cells.
CONCLUSIONS: ADAM12 might be a valuable prognostic biomarker and a promising 
candidate for tumor immunotherapy.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a recognized risk factor for 
gastric cancer (GC), which is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths 
worldwide. As a Class I carcinogen, H. pylori plays a central role in the 
occurrence and development of GC. Recent studies have highlighted the critical 
role of metabolic reprogramming inthe gastric cancer, and H. pylori infection 
has been shown to significantly alter metabolic pathways in gastric cancer. This 
review explores the mechanisms by which H. pylori infection drives metabolic 
changes in GC, particularly in glycolysis, lipid metabolism, and amino acid 
metabolism. By altering these metabolisms, H. pylori enhances the survival, 
proliferation, and metastasis of tumor cells, and also promotes immune evasion. 
Therefore, understanding the ways in which H. pylori-induced metabolic 
reprogramming of GC cells is essential for identifying new therapeutic targets. 
By summarizing the latest research progress of these metabolic pathways, new 
strategies and directions can be provided for gastric cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: Cancer screening disparities exist among immigrants in the USA, yet 
the cancer screening behaviors of ethnic Black immigrants remains relatively 
unknown. The Garifuna, an Afro-Amerindian group, experience structural forces in 
their homelands and urban settling communities in the USA with little known of 
their cancer screening behaviors. The purpose of this study is to examine breast 
cancer screening practices among Garifuna women residing in communities within 
New York City. The study examined levels of adherence to recommended breast 
cancer screening guidelines and their association with demographic factors, 
access to healthcare services, perceptions/barriers, level of acculturation, 
identity, and breast cancer screening guideline knowledge.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey of immigrant Garifuna women, age 
50 years and older, residing in New York City. Univariate analysis described the 
survey study sample and bivariate analysis measured level of association between 
variables. Logistic regression examined the predictive nature of variables in 
explaining breast cancer screening adherence to screening guidelines.
RESULTS: Four hundred and two Garifuna women completed surveys over a 22-month 
period. Garifuna women had breast cancer screening rates of 82%, higher than the 
national screening rate of 72%. Longer length of time in the USA, access to 
healthcare, and motivation to receive screenings were significant predictors of 
receiving screening.
CONCLUSIONS: The study identified positive structural forces in the New York 
City community such as access to healthcare that may explain adherence to 
recommended breast cancer screening guidelines among immigrant Garifuna women.

PURPOSE: The approval of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors in the 
first line of treatment has transformed the therapeutic landscape of 
extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC); real-world (rw) evidence of 
clinical benefit is currently limited. In this study, we investigated the rw 
efficacy of first-line chemoimmunotherapy and the role of potential biomarkers.
METHODS/PATIENTS: We retrospectively assessed patients with SCLC receiving 
first-line chemoimmunotherapy at Sotiria Thoracic Diseases Hospital of Athens, 
Athens, Greece. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to calculate real-world 
progression-free survival (rwPFS) and real-world overall survival (rwOS). Cox 
proportional hazards regression analysis was utilized to identify associations 
between patient characteristics and outcomes.
RESULTS: 188 patients were included. Median rwPFS was 6.5 months (95% CI 
5.8-7.1 months) and median rwOS was 11.2 months (95% CI 9.1-12.0 months). rwOS 
was higher in the atezolizumab group compared with the durvalumab group (median, 
12.0 vs 9.2 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% CI 1.06-2.15; p = 0.02), 
similar results were observed for rwPFS (median, 6.5 vs. 6.0 months, HR, 1.55; 
95% CI 1.10-2.16; p = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, the difference between 
atezolizumab and durvalumab was not statistically significant, while lung, bone 
and liver metastases, ECOG PS, LDH and NLR were associated with an increased 
risk of death. Associations were utilized for the generation of a novel 
prognostic score with good discriminatory power (C-statistic: 0.73).
CONCLUSIONS: Real-world efficacy of first-line chemoimmunotherapy in patients 
with ES-SCLC is comparable to randomized trials. The association between 
prognostic scores and survival outcomes in ES-SCLC should be explored in 
prospective studies.Query.

BACKGROUND: Both alcohol fatty liver disease (AFLD) and non-alcohol fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD) are established risk factors for liver cancer development. We 
conduct a comparative analysis between AFLD and NAFLD to determine which 
condition contributes a greater burden to liver cancer incidence.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the TriNetX research network. Individuals 
aged ≥ 20 years with newly diagnosed fatty liver disease between 2008 and 2021 
were included. Participants were categorized into two groups: AFLD and NAFLD. 
Patients with a history of hepatic cirrhosis, liver cancer, hepatitis B, or 
hepatitis C before the index date were excluded. Propensity score matching was 
performed based on age, sex, and comorbidities, resulting in a balanced 1:1 
matched cohort. Comparative analyses were conducted between the AFLD and NAFLD 
cohorts to assess differences in liver cancer risk profiles.
RESULTS: A total of 13,998 AFLD and 1,165,365 NAFLD cases were analyzed. After 
propensity score matching, both cohorts consist of 13,998 individuals. At the 2- 
and 3-year follow-ups, the risk became statistically significant and showed a 
progressive increase, with relative risks approaching a two-fold elevation in 
the AFLD group. Cumulatively, by the final follow-up, AFLD patients demonstrated 
a markedly higher incidence of liver cancer (0.950% vs. 0.493%), confirming a 
sustained and significantly elevated risk even after adjustment for baseline 
characteristics.
CONCLUSION: Patients with AFLD exhibited an approximately two-fold increased 
risk of liver cancer development over a 3-year follow-up period compared to 
those with NAFLD. This finding underscores the urgent need for comprehensive 
recognition and mitigation of alcohol-associated hepatocarcinogenesis.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is characterized by molecular complexity 
and heterogeneity. The SET oncoprotein is overexpressed in B-cell chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Acting as an intrinsic inhibitor 
of the tumor suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), targeting SET has shown 
anti-cancer activity. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of 
SET antagonism in DLBCL. Overexpression of SET resulted in decreased phosphatase 
activities of PP2A and SHP-1, while activating Lyn. Conversely, SET inhibition, 
either through antagonists or siRNA, led to the activation of PP2A and SHP-1, 
resulting in the inactivation of Lyn. Analysis of public datasets revealed 
upregulation of Lyn in late-stage DLBCL samples, which was associated with a 
worse outcome. Ectopic expression of Lyn enhanced the cell viability and 
migratory capacity of DLBCL cells. Notably, Lyn inhibited PP2A and SHP-1 
phosphatase activities, suggesting the existence of a SET/PP2A/SHP-1/Lyn 
feedback loop. Immunohistochemically, SHP-1 levels were negatively correlated 
with pLyn/Lyn levels in DLBCL tissues. Overall, these results suggest that SET 
antagonism to inactivate Lyn represents an attractive approach for DLBCL 
treatment.

Statins, commonly prescribed for hypercholesterolemia, have demonstrated a range 
of anticancer properties, including the induction of apoptosis and ferroptosis, 
modulation of autophagy, and reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment. These 
effects position statins as promising candidates for drug repurposing in 
oncology. However, integrating statins into cancer care will require a precision 
medicine approach. Despite the increasing volume of preclinical data supporting 
statin anticancer effects, clinical evaluation remains limited. To date, only a 
small number of clinical trials have investigated statins in oncology, and these 
have primarily focused on moderate-intensity regimens. Emerging evidence 
suggests that certain statins may be more effective than others as anticancer 
agents, with their therapeutic activity shown to be both dose- and 
time-dependent. This review highlights key considerations for formulating a 
precision cancer medicine framework for statins. These include the chemical 
properties and pharmacokinetics of different statins, interpatient genetic 
variability affecting statin response, biomarkers of statin sensitivity, the 
need to achieve therapeutically relevant concentrations in tumor tissue, 
potential synergies with existing chemotherapeutic agents, and recent advances 
in targeted statin delivery technologies.

The Wilms' Tumor 1 (WT1) gene has attracted significant attention in oncological 
research owing to its involvement in the pathogenesis of a variety of 
malignancies. Initially identified in association with Wilms' tumor, a pediatric 
renal carcinoma, WT1 is now recognized for its broader implications in the 
etiology of multiple cancers, including leukemia, ovarian cancer, and lung 
cancer. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of the historical 
development of WT1 research, explores its mechanisms in cancer progression, and 
assesses its potential as a therapeutic target, with an emphasis on its clinical 
implications for cancer treatment strategies.

Gastric cancer (GC) represents a highly aggressive malignancy within the 
gastrointestinal tract. The expression of miR-3662 exhibits specificity across 
different tumor types, but its precise biological role in GC pathogenesis 
remains poorly understood. Based on the results of bioinformatics analysis, we 
observed that miR-3662 was significantly overexpressed in GC. Subsequently, we 
investigated the biological role of miR-3662 in regulating the malignant 
phenotype of GC cells. Bioinformatics prediction combined with dual-luciferase 
assay confirmed that CAB39L is a direct target of miR-3662. Functional gain- and 
loss-of-function experiments were conducted to explore the impact of the 
miR-3662/CAB39L axis on the malignant characteristics of GC cells, as well as 
its influence on the activation of the AMPK signaling pathway and the expression 
of key glycolytic proteins. The results demonstrated that miR-3662 
overexpression enhanced the proliferation, invasion, and migration of AGS cells, 
upregulated the expression of PFKP and LDHA, while suppressing apoptosis and 
reducing AMPK phosphorylation. Conversely, silencing miR-3662 exhibited opposing 
effects in HGC-27 cells. CAB39L expression was found to be downregulated in GC 
tissues. Upregulation of CAB39L inhibited GC cell proliferation, invasion, and 
migration, decreased the expression of PFKP and LDHA, and increased both 
apoptosis and AMPK activation. Furthermore, overexpression of CAB39L partially 
counteracted the promoting effects of high levels of miR-3662 on the malignant 
biological phenotype of GC cells. In conclusion, this study reveals that 
miR-3662 acts as a carcinogenic regulator in GC by targeting CAB39L, with the 
underlying mechanism potentially involving the modulation of AMPK activation to 
enhance cellular glycolysis.

BACKGROUND: Preneoplastic lesions (PNL) represent a state intermediate between 
normal cells and invasive cancer (IC). Individuals diagnosed with PNL are at 
increased risk of developing IC and represent a unique risk group. We estimated 
the proportion of IC that could be intercepted at multiple anatomic sites in 
individuals with PNL.
METHODS: Using a literature survey of the prevalence, latency, and probability 
of progression of PNL to IC, we undertook a sensitivity analysis across 
proportions of IC from 5%-95% that could be intercepted in a cohort of 100,000 
individuals that would be avoided if PNL interception was successful. To 
calculate the number of avoidable IC, we used data that represent 
population-based, high-risk, unselected, and selected PNL case series, and 
calculated the sensitivities and specificities of avoidable ICs.
RESULTS: Substantial invasive cancer reductions could be achieved by 
interception of PNL that precede pancreas, gastric, bladder, prostate, breast, 
colorectal, and skin cancers. Intermediate reduction in cancer incidence was 
observed for lung, and oral cancers. Limited impact on the global burden of 
cancer with interception of PNL are likely for cervical, liver, and esophageal 
cancer as well as myeloma and leukemia. Due to the estimates representing 
varying populations, impacts of a specific PNL or cancer cannot be compared with 
another.
CONCLUSION: We identified substantial variation in the impact that interception 
of PNL would have on the development of IC.
IMPACT: These results may guide research and implementation of studies intended 
to maximize the number of IC that can be avoided by interception of PNL.

BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of the depth of invasion is critical in 
determining appropriate treatment in early gastric cancer (EGC), especially when 
submucosal deep invasion (d-SM) is suspected. The diagnostic accuracy of 
conventional endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) remains limited; however, the use 
of large volumes of de-aerated water carries a risk of aspiration pneumonia.
METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated the diagnostic performance and 
safety of gel-EUS, a method that uses a transparent, viscous gel instead of 
water. A total of 81 EGC lesions suspected of submucosal invasion were 
investigated: 52 underwent conventional EUS (group W) and 29 underwent gel-EUS 
(group G). The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, safety outcomes, and 
examination time were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Gel-EUS showed significantly higher sensitivity in detecting d-SM 
cancer compared to conventional EUS (83.3% vs. 25.0%), while its specificity was 
somewhat lower (70.6% vs. 89.7%). The examination time was significantly shorter 
in group G (median 3.0 vs. 8.0 min, p < 0.001). Aspiration events occurred less 
frequently in group G (3.7% vs. 13.4%). The single aspiration case in group G 
occurred before the gel infusion. Although midazolam use was higher in group G, 
there were no significant differences in oxygen use, saturation, or blood 
pressure.
CONCLUSIONS: Gel-EUS is a safe and efficient alternative to conventional EUS, 
offering higher sensitivity, shorter examination time, and reduced aspiration 
risk. This novel approach may improve the diagnostic accuracy for deep 
submucosal invasion in EGC and assist in optimal treatment selection.

BACKGROUND: The proportion of lung cancers affecting individuals who have never 
smoked is growing, with these cancers being prone to harboring mutations in the 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Little is known about risk factors 
and prognostic indicators for EGFR-mutant cancers, with current research limited 
by the scarcity of datasets integrating genomic, clinical, and environmental 
data.
METHODS: We created the Meyer Cancer Center-Molecularly Enhanced Lung cancer 
Database (MCC-MELD) including lung cancer cases from a large catchment area in 
New York City. We identified cases through linkage to our institution's cancer 
registry and a clinician-initiated, manually curated database. We linked all 
cases to the electronic health record and in-house tumor genomic testing 
results. We used natural language processing (NLP) to extract unstructured 
genomic testing results and detailed smoking history. We linked geocoded 
addresses to detailed area-level measures.
RESULTS: MCC-MELD contains 9,573 lung cancer patients diagnosed 1988-2024, of 
whom 20% were non-Hispanic Asian, 14% were non-Hispanic Black, and 8% were 
Hispanic. We identified 1,092 (11.4%) EGFR-mutant cancers, with NLP identifying 
397 cases not identified by structured data. NLP showed high accuracy in 
ascertaining EGFR status (97%) and quantitative smoking history variables 
(90-98%). Never-smokers made up 16% of the cases in MCC-MELD.
CONCLUSIONS: MCC-MELD is an NLP-enhanced database containing clinical 
information, genomic testing results, and linkages to area-level data for lung 
cancer patients from a diverse urban setting.
IMPACT: This resource can facilitate studies on lung cancer risk factors, 
treatment patterns, and outcomes by EGFR and other driver mutation status.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the improved diagnostic efficacy of the emerging 
non-invasive microstructure imaging technique, MR cytometry, in differentiating 
benign and malignant prostate lesions, after removing perfusion effect and 
introducing histogram features.
METHODS: This study included 33 patients with prostate cancer and 39 patients 
with benign lesions, who underwent time-dependent diffusion MRI examinations, 
including pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and 
oscillating gradient spin-echo (OGSE) DWI at frequencies of 20 Hz and 40 Hz. A 
mono-exponential signal-fitting method was used to eliminate perfusion effects. 
Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC), MR-cytometry-derived microstructural 
parameters (cell diameter [Formula: see text], intracellular volume fraction 
[Formula: see text], extracellular diffusivity [Formula: see text] and 
cellularity [Formula: see text]) and corresponding histogram features were 
calculated to differentiate lesions. Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to evaluate 
the differences between benign and malignant lesions. Uni- and multi-variate 
logistic regressions were performed and calculated the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic (AUC) to quantify the diagnostic performance of 
classifiers.
RESULTS: Removal of perfusion effect improved the significance level of the 
difference in the cell diameter [Formula: see text] (from [Formula: see text] to 
[Formula: see text]), where [Formula: see text] is larger in the benign group. 
The diagnostic efficacy of a single histogram feature was comparable to that of 
the corresponding ADC or microstructural parameter mean value. Both removing 
perfusion effect and incorporating histogram features can improve the AUC of the 
combined regression models (from 0.885 to 0.918 and 0.908, respectively). 
Combining both strategies further enhanced the AUC to 0.934.
CONCLUSION: In MR cytometry analysis, removing the perfusion effect and 
incorporating histogram features of ADCs and microstructural parameters can 
provide better diagnostic efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Micro-ultrasound (micro-US; 29-MHz) offers real-time, 
high-resolution prostate imaging, but its stand-alone diagnostic accuracy 
remains uncertain. We synthesized prospective evidence to evaluate micro-US for 
classifying clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) using histopathology 
as the reference standard.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science (inception-20 
May 2025) for prospective studies assessing micro-US as an index test on a 
diagnostic pathway. Data were pooled using random-effects models on 
logit-transformed sensitivity and specificity, with an HSROC representation and 
model diagnostics. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses explored heterogeneity, 
including threshold (PRI-MUS) and spectrum effects. Clinical utility was 
appraised using Fagan nomograms and a likelihood-ratio scatter. Small-study 
effects were evaluated with Deeks' test.
RESULTS: Five prospective studies met criteria. Pooled sensitivity was 0.84 (95% 
CI 0.65-0.94) and pooled specificity was 0.41 (95% CI 0.25-0.59), indicating 
moderate discrimination on HSROC. Secondary metrics were concordant (PLR 1.45, 
95% CI 1.17-1.80; NLR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23-0.61; DOR 3.95, 95% CI 2.48-6.30). On a 
25% pre-test probability, the Fagan nomogram showed modest shifts (~ 33% after a 
positive test; ~11% after a negative), supporting a triage/rule-out role. 
Heterogeneity was substantial and strongly influenced by threshold and clinical 
spectrum differences; subgroup and meta-regression suggested that 
spectrum-related factors were associated with lower specificity, whereas no 
covariate robustly altered sensitivity (exploratory given small k). Model checks 
were acceptable, and Deeks' test showed no evidence of small-study effects 
(p ≈ 0.70).
CONCLUSION: As a stand-alone index test for csPCa classification, micro-US 
demonstrates high sensitivity but low specificity, yielding modest impact on 
post-test probability. These findings support micro-US as a complementary/triage 
(rule-out) adjunct, particularly when mpMRI is unavailable, contraindicated, or 
delayed, while highlighting the need for standardized PRI-MUS thresholds, reader 
training, and larger multicenter studies to refine specificity and clarify 
integration with MRI-based pathways.

BACKGROUND: Both acupressure and acupuncture effectively alleviate pain in 
cancer patients. Acupuncture requires specialized practitioners and is invasive, 
while acupressure is noninvasive and can be self-administered. Current 
comparative evidence remains insufficient for clear clinical recommendations.
AIMS: To investigate the relative efficacy of acupuncture versus acupressure in 
alleviating pain among cancer patients.
METHODS: This systematic review and network meta-analysis employed a Bayesian 
framework. Eight major Chinese and English databases were searched from 
inception to March 1, 2025. Two independent reviewers screened literature, 
extracted data, and assessed bias in selected studies using the Risk of Bias 2 
tool. Network meta-analysis was conducted using R software version 4.4.1.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven RCTs including 3066 patients were analyzed to compare 
eight treatments: manual acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical acupoint 
stimulation, auricular acupressure, electro-acupuncture, acupoint massage, 
auricular acupuncture, moxibustion, and placebo. Network meta-analysis revealed 
auricular acupuncture provided the greatest pain score improvement compared to 
placebo, followed by auricular acupressure and acupoint massage.
CONCLUSION: Based on our analysis, we recommend auricular acupuncture, auricular 
acupressure, and acupoint massage for managing cancer pain. While current 
studies demonstrate potential benefits, limitations include concurrent pain 
medication use and methodological inconsistencies. Future research should 
include more robust, single-intervention clinical trials to definitively 
evaluate efficacy for oncology patients.

BACKGROUND: Esophagectomy for esophageal cancer is complex and frequently 
complicated by pulmonary issues, cardiac problems, and anastomotic leakage. 
While numerous factors contribute to these complications, the specific effects 
of intraoperative hypotension (IOH) on postoperative outcomes remain poorly 
understood. This study examined the relationship between IOH severity during 
esophagectomy and subsequent complications.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study analyzed patients undergoing 
elective open transthoracic or thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal 
cancer between May 2007 and February 2020. Multiple logistic regression assessed 
IOH's association with primary outcomes (composite of major complications 
including 30-day mortality, reoperation, anastomotic leakage, pneumonia, 
reintubation, and prolonged ventilation > 48 h) and secondary outcomes of 
anastomotic leakage. Additionally, Cox regression analyzed IOH's impact on 
long-term prognosis.
RESULTS: The final cohort comprised 884 patients. The most prevalent 
postoperative complications were anastomotic leakage (25.2%) and pneumonia 
(23.4%). The 30-day mortality rate was 0.8%. No significant association existed 
between IOH and major composite outcomes across mean blood pressure (MBP) and 
systolic blood pressure thresholds. However, IOH was significantly associated 
with anastomotic leakage when MBP fell below 65 mmHg for extended periods 
(adjusted odds ratio: 1.02 per 10-min interval, 95% confidence interval: 
1.01-1.04, P = 0.01). IOH did not significantly affect long-term survival.
CONCLUSIONS: This study did not identify a significant association between 
intraoperative hypotension and composite major postoperative complications or 
long-term survival outcomes. However, intraoperative hypotension, specifically 
prolonged episodes with mean blood pressure below 65 mmHg, was significantly 
associated with the short-term complication of anastomotic leakage.

PURPOSE: Helicobacter pylori (Hp) markedly elevates the risk of gastric cancer 
(GC) through the induction of chronic inflammation, which facilitates the 
accumulation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the immune 
microenvironment of GC. CAFs contribute to the progression of GC and adversely 
affect subsequent therapeutic outcomes for patients. However, there is a paucity 
of research concerning the impact of Hp on CAFs or the identification of 
potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
METHODS: We analyzed public microRNA and transcriptome sequencing data to 
identify key microRNAs and signaling pathways in Hp + GC. We also used 
single-cell sequencing to explore cellular localization and interaction 
mechanisms. Molecular biology experiments, in vitro cell co-culture, and in vivo 
cell-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models 
validated our findings and assessed the pathway's impact on GC proliferation and 
therapeutic potential.
RESULTS: We identified the ""TLR/miR-148a-5p/CALD1/collagen VI"" signaling pathway 
in Hp-stimulated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a critical signaling 
pathway influencing the proliferation of Hp + GC. These CAFs contributed to GC 
cell proliferation by releasing substantial amounts of collagen VI, which 
interacted with tumoral SDC4 receptors. Administration of miR-148a-5p agomir in 
vivo effectively inhibited the proliferative effects and concurrently enhanced 
the efficacy of chemotherapy in Hp + GC mice models.
CONCLUSION: Hp-stimulated CAFs played a significant role in promoting tumor 
proliferation in Hp + GC. Targeting its ""TLR/miR-148a-5p/CALD1/collagen VI"" 
pathway was a promising method to ease the collagen-rich microenvironment and 
inhibit the proliferation of GC cells. Furthermore, miR-148a-5p agomir might 
serve as a safer and more efficacious chemotherapeutic sensitizer for patients 
with Hp + GC.

According to GLOBOCAN 2022 cancer incidence and mortality statistics compiled by 
the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the incidence rate of breast 
cancer (BC) ranks second among all 36 types of cancers, just after lung cancer. 
Despite great advances in breast cancer (BC) treatment-including agents such as 
Tamoxifen, Fulvestrant, Toremifene, and Raloxifene, all of which are approved 
for the systemic treatment of BC patients-these agents only prolong survival by 
a few months, and patients with advanced BC remain susceptible to drug 
resistance. Ubiquitination, a type of post-translational protein modification, 
influences cellular physiological activities by regulating protein localization, 
stability, and activity in pathways such as gene transcription and DNA damage 
signaling. The reversible process of ubiquitination, termed deubiquitination, 
refers to the release of ubiquitinated substrates through the action of 
deubiquitinases (DUBs) and other active molecules. In breast cancer, an 
increasing number of DUBs have been identified to exhibit aberrant expression, 
with specific DUBs capable of either promoting or suppressing mammary 
tumorigenesis depending on their substrates. In this review, we focused on 
several DUBs associated with breast cancer, including their structure, function, 
and relationship to BC. Among them, we focused on the USP family and OTU family, 
which are more extensively studied in BC.

ACSL3 converts long-chain fatty acids into acyl-CoA, a key step in lipid 
metabolism. Since this process is linked to cancer development and progression, 
this study investigates the specific roles and underlying mechanisms of ACSL3 
across various cancer types. We examined ACSL3 by analyzing its expression, 
transcriptomic variations, single-cell localization, prognostic significance, 
and biological roles using various databases and perspectives. We also studied 
its relationship with the immune microenvironment, epigenetic changes, and drug 
responsiveness. The effects of ACSL3 on liver cancer were investigated through 
experiments conducted both in vivo and in vitro experiments. ACSL3 was found to 
be abnormally expressed in most cancers, with a higher expression ratio in 
macrophages, and is associated with the prognosis of certain cancers, such as 
kidney cancer, esophageal cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, lung 
cancer, thyroid cancer, and ovarian/cervical cancer. Its expression is closely 
linked to immune cell infiltration, the anti-cancer immune cycle, major 
histocompatibility complex, immune checkpoints, tumor mutation burden, 
microsatellite instability, RNA modifications like m1A, m5C, and m6A, as well as 
DNA methylation. ACSL3 is commonly involved in pathways related to the tumor 
microenvironment and cell cycle across various cancers. Experiments both in 
vitro and in vivo showed that reducing ACSL3 levels significantly decreased 
liver cancer cell growth, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target. Our 
research underscores the promise of ACSL3 expression as a new biomarker for 
forecasting the outcomes of various human cancers and assessing the 
effectiveness of immunotherapy.

Carbon Nanodots Loaded with Natural Bioactive Compounds for P-gp Inhibition, 
Antimetastatic Activity, and Biosensing in 2D and 3D Breast Cancer Cells.

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women and has a major impact 
on cancer-related deaths worldwide. The combination therapy of drugs based on 
nanomaterials has emerged as an effective approach toward the different cancer 
treatments. While carbon nanodots (CDs) are mainly utilized for bioimaging, 
their potential as innovative nanocarriers remains largely untapped. Therefore, 
in this study, we synthesized biomass-derived carbon nanodots, and their 
formulation was optimized using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The 
optimized CDs were coloaded with curcumin (Cur) and quercetin (Quer) (coloaded 
carbon nanodots) as model natural bioactive compounds to evaluate their 
synergistic therapeutic effect on breast cancer. The stability of the 
synthesized CDs was tested at various pH values (4-8.5) and over time, revealing 
excellent stability for up to 120 h even under acidic or basic conditions. 
UV-vis spectroscopy, XRD, Zeta potential, and FTIR confirmed the loading of 
these bioactive molecules on carbon nanodots. It has also been found that 
loading of curcumin and quercetin on carbon nanodots increases the stability and 
bioavailability of curcumin. Antiproliferative and antimetastatic properties of 
the coloaded carbon nanodots were further studied on the MCF-7 breast cancer 
cell line. The data represent that these coloaded carbon nanodots exhibit strong 
cytotoxicity and antimigration effects against the MCF-7. Notably, coloaded 
carbon nanodots significantly enhanced the apoptosis, ROS production, nucleus 
degeneration, and tumor inhibition in vitro in comparison to single 
bioactive-loaded carbon nanodots. The enhancement occurs because the coloaded 
carbon nanodots block multidrug resistance and the metastasis of cancer cells by 
downregulating the expression of membrane-bound P-glycoprotein (P-gp), resulting 
in the accumulation of the curcumin in the cancer cells. Additionally, they also 
downregulate the BIRC gene expression, which is the biomarker for triple 
negative breast cancer cells, whereas they enhance the expression of the p53 
gene. To mimic the in vivo tumor microenvironment and address ethical concerns 
associated with animal studies, the penetration and efficacy of the coloaded CDs 
were also evaluated in 3D spheroid models of breast cancer. These models 
demonstrated efficient penetration and therapeutic action of the coloaded CDs, 
highlighting their translational potential for future cancer therapy.

Breast cancer (BrCa) frequently metastasizes to bone, severely compromising 
patient survival. Preventing metastatic spread is, therefore, a crucial 
therapeutic goal. Tumor matrix stiffness, growth factor gradients, and the bone 
microenvironment collectively influence cancer progression; however, existing in 
vitro models lack the physiological complexity to capture these interactions. To 
address this, we developed a 3D biomimetic bone metastasis-on-a-chip platform to 
recapitulate the key microenvironments involved in BrCa dissemination. This 
study aimed to develop an in vitro metastasis chip that mimics BrCa tumors, the 
vascular-like region, and the bone microenvironment, enabling investigation of 
microenvironmental factors during metastasis. Bioinks replicating tumor 
microenvironments with adjustable stiffness were synthesized, including 
methacrylated collagen (ColMA) and hyaluronic acid (HAMA). Their chemical, 
mechanical, and biocompatible properties were optimized. Selected bioinks 
mimicked BrCa stiffness, allowing tumor spheroid embedding in a two-layered 
model. The core bioink promoted BrCa proliferation, while the peripheral bioink 
enhanced stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), increasing 
metastatic potential. Furthermore, a 3D bone-like matrix composed of 
methacrylated gelatin and hydroxyapatite was integrated to simulate the 
extravasation process, facilitating BrCa cell migration and colonization within 
the bone-mimicking region. This metastasis-on-a-chip system successfully 
replicates critical stages of BrCa progression and provides a versatile in vitro 
platform for studying metastatic mechanisms and evaluating potential 
antimetastatic therapies.

Convergent and Divergent Signaling Pathways in Cancer: A Dual-Axis Model for 
Adaptive Precision Oncology.

Aliasgar Shahiwala PhD.

Despite significant advances in cancer research, the complexity of signaling 
pathways remains a major challenge in precision oncology. Tumors harbor a 
diverse array of genetic alterations; however, these often converge onto a 
limited set of core signaling pathways, notably RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK), 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM), and Wnt/β-catenin. Concurrently, these pathways diverge 
extensively downstream, driving therapeutic resistance through mechanisms such 
as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, immune evasion, and metabolic 
reprogramming. Unlike previous literature that largely provides descriptive 
accounts of pathway alterations, this review uniquely synthesizes convergent and 
divergent signaling into a clinically actionable diagnostic and therapeutic 
framework. It critically assesses current precision oncology strategies, 
identifies gaps, and proposes a dual-axis model that integrates static genomic 
profiling with dynamic signaling evolution to inform precision therapy. By 
highlighting opportunities for combination therapy informed by pathway 
interdependencies and adaptive resistance mechanisms, this perspective provides 
novel clinical insights and tangible directions for future research in 
overcoming resistance in cancer treatment.

The loss of therapeutic efficacy in breast cancer treatment remains a 
significant challenge, with increasing evidence that the tumor microenvironment 
(TME) plays a crucial role in driving resistance. Understanding how stromal 
cells remodel the TME is critical for advancing cancer treatment strategies and 
drug development. Among the key cellular components of the TME, fibroblasts are 
recognized for their pivotal role in cancer progression through extracellular 
matrix remodeling. To enable in vitro interrogation of tumor-stromal 
interactions relevant to endocrine response, a microfluidic droplet-based 3D 
coculture platform was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of uniform 
breast cancer-fibroblast coculture models. As proof of concept, this system was 
used to investigate the impact of stromal remodeling by coculturing an estrogen 
receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cell line with either primary fibroblasts 
or immortalized lung fibroblasts. Collagen I and Ki67 expressions were evaluated 
following exposure to endocrine therapy. The 3D coculture of ER+ breast cancer 
cells with primary fibroblasts resulted in two distinct spatial distributions of 
collagen I, termed ""hotspots"". One cohort exhibited a single hotspot with 
reduced collagen I expression, while the other displayed multiple hotspots with 
increased collagen I expression. Notably, the stratification of these 
populations was independent of the spheroid size. Coculture with immortalized 
fibroblasts produced similar hotspot patterns but with higher overall collagen I 
levels. Notably, during endocrine response studies, an increase in Ki67 and 
collagen I expression was found in the coculture spheroids, suggesting that 
fibroblasts contribute to proliferation and modulate endocrine response. 
Collectively, this study establishes a versatile 3D microfluidic model for 
probing tumor-stromal interactions and provides a foundation for future 
mechanistic studies of ECM-mediated remodeling in breast cancer.

Introduction In this preclinical human immune system patient-derived xenograft 
(HIS PDX) model and phase II clinical trial, we assessed evorpacept (anti-CD47 
engineered fusion protein with inactive Fc), cetuximab, and pembrolizumab 
(triple therapy) in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC). 
Materials, Patients, and Methods HIS BRGS mice with PDXs were treated with 
triple therapy or its components. Patients with refractory MSS CRC were treated 
with triple therapy in a safety run-in (Stage 1) followed by expansion (Stage 2, 
planned N=42). The co-primary objectives were to determine the recommended dose 
of evorpacept and objective response rate (vs historical control). Results In 
HIS-PDX mice, triple therapy decreased the growth of MSS CRC tumors and 
increased tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Sixteen patients were treated on the 
clinical trial across two evorpacept dose levels, including N=12 in Stage 1 and 
N=4 in Stage 2. Trial enrollment was terminated early due to safety concerns 
(one treatment-related grade 5 event each of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 
and cytokine release syndrome). Otherwise, the adverse event profile was as 
expected. Among all patients, the ORR was 6.3%; formal hypothesis testing was 
not performed. The disease control rate was 12.5%, the median progression-free 
survival was 2.3 months, and the median overall survival was 10.9 months. Blood- 
and tumor-based clinical trial correlative analyses identified innate and 
adaptive immune system activation. Conclusions While triple therapy demonstrated 
evidence of efficacy in refractory MSS CRC, safety concerns halted enrollment. 
Further investigation is necessary to determine the optimal use of CD47-targeted 
therapies in MSS CRC.

OBJECTIVES: Obesity is closely associated with the occurrence and progression of 
breast cancer. While body mass index (BMI) is widely used to diagnose obesity, 
it has certain limitations. Subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT) also serves as an 
indicator of body composition. However, studies on breast SFT are scarce. This 
study aims to investigate the relationship between BMI, breast SFT, and 
ultrasound features of breast cancer, as well as their associations with tumor 
proliferation and invasiveness.
METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the relationship between BMI and 
clinical and ultrasound characteristics in 1670 patients. Among them, breast SFT 
was measured in 470 patients using mammography and ultrasound, and the 
correlation between SFT and BMI was assessed. The relationship between 
ultrasound-measured SFT and pathological as well as ultrasound features was also 
analyzed. The correlation between breast SFT, BMI, and somatic gene mutations 
was analyzed in 234 patients.
RESULTS: Patients with BMI ≥24 kg/m2 exhibited more malignant ultrasound 
features. SFT measured by mammography was correlated with SFT measured by 
ultrasound (r = 0.565, p < .001). Both BMI and SFT measured via mammography 
(r = 0.578, p < .001) and ultrasound (r = 0.485, p < .001) showed significant 
correlations. Breast SFT varied significantly among tumors with different shapes 
(p = .025), boundaries (p < .001), and posterior echo features (p < .001). The 
area under the curve (AUC) for breast SFT predicting irregular shape, halo, and 
posterior shadowing was 0.605, 0.666, and 0.632, respectively, with cutoff 
values of 8.65, 8.35, and 8.35 mm. Patients with breast SFT ≥8.6 mm demonstrated 
significantly elevated Ki67 levels (p = .004). No differences in somatic 
mutation frequencies were found at a threshold of 8.60 mm for fat thickness or 
at a BMI of 24 kg/m2. However, at BMI ≥22 kg/m2, mutation frequencies were 
higher.
CONCLUSIONS: BMI and breast SFT are associated with malignant ultrasound 
features. While both have diagnostic value, BMI is more reliable than fat 
thickness for predicting cancer proliferation and invasion, with a BMI threshold 
of 22 kg/m2 offering higher diagnostic value than 24 kg/m2.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer has been the leading cause of cancer-related deaths 
among women in the United States since 1987, with many cases diagnosed at 
advanced stages, despite screening methods like low-dose CT scans. Although 
smoking remains the primary risk factor for lung cancer, nonsmoking women, who 
make up 20% of lung cancer cases in the United States, are also at risk. 
However, there are no established guidelines for screening nonsmoking women, 
even as lung cancer rates rise in this group.
PURPOSE: The study explores potential risk factors that may influence cancer 
staging and assesses the potential benefits of low-dose computed tomography 
(LDCT) screening for nonsmoking women.
METHODOLOGY: This retrospective chart review analyzed 300 female patients 
diagnosed with lung cancer between 2019 and 2023. Data collected included 
smoking status, age, risk factors like family history, secondhand smoke, 
pulmonary comorbidities, cancer stage, and histology.
RESULTS: A logistic regression model found that pulmonary comorbidities, a 
history of another cancer, and smoking status significantly influenced the 
likelihood of being diagnosed with advanced-stage (III or IV) lung cancer. 
Nonsmoking women with history of a lung comorbidity or history of cancer were 
more likely to be diagnosed at an earlier stage (I or II).
CONCLUSION: The study suggests that lung cancer screening (with LDCT) could 
enhance early detection and staging in high-risk nonsmoking women, especially 
those with pulmonary comorbidities or history of other cancers.
IMPLICATIONS: The results underscore the importance of expanding lung cancer 
screening criteria to include high-risk nonsmoking women, particularly those 
with pulmonary comorbidities or prior cancer history.

University, Xi'an, China.

AIMS: Notable sex-based disparities exist in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 
necessitating male-specific models for predicting lateral lymph node metastasis 
(LLNM) to guide treatment.
METHODS: We developed and validated two nomograms, based on central lymph node 
ratio (LNR) and preoperative ultrasound (US), respectively, using data from 433 
male PTC patients who underwent total thyroidectomy (TT) with central and 
lateral neck lymph node dissection. Multivariable analysis identified key risk 
factors. Model performance was evaluated using ROC curves, calibration curves, 
and decision curve analysis (DCA) across training and validation sets.
RESULTS: Male patients had 1.33-fold higher odds of central lymph node 
metastasis (CLNM) and 1.51-fold higher odds of LLNM than female patients 
(p < 0.05). Multivariable analysis identified multifocality, tumor size >20 mm, 
preoperative US nodal status, and an elevated LNR as independent risk factors 
for LLNM in males (p < 0.05). The LNR-based nomogram demonstrated superior 
predictive accuracy, with AUCs of 0.828 (training), 0.812 (internal validation), 
and 0.832 (external validation), outperforming the US-based model. Risk 
stratification using nomogram scores effectively categorized patients into three 
distinct groups with significantly different LLNM rates.
CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram based on the central LNR provides a precise and 
clinically valuable tool for the individualized prediction of LLNM in male PTC 
patients.

Purpose To evaluate the ability of habitat imaging to noninvasively assess 
high-grade prostate cancer (PCa). Materials and Methods This retrospective, 
multicenter study included patients with PCa undergoing MRI examination and 
subsequent radical prostatectomy (RP) between January 2018 and June 2024. 
Following the 2019 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) 
guidelines, patients were categorized into low- to medium-grade (ISUP ≤ 3) and 
high-grade (ISUP ≥ 4) groups, using RP results as the reference. After 
integrating multimodal imaging data of each voxel, lesions were clustered into k 
habitat subregions. RP specimens were matched to these subregions, and each 
subregion's ISUP grade was evaluated to calculate the detection rate of 
high-grade lesions. Logistic regression identified high-grade PCa-related 
variables, forming the habitat imaging-clinical imaging (HICI) predictive model. 
The model's performance was validated using the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results This study enrolled 359 male 
patients with PCa (median age, 68 years) divided into training (159 patients), 
internal test (69 patients), and external test (131 patients) sets. Habitat 1, 
which featured high cellular density, blood perfusion, and tissue structural 
complexity, showed a 92.6% (87 of 94) detection rate for high-grade PCa. 
Logistic regression identified the proportion of habitat 1 (odds ratio [OR], 
3.18; P < .001), the prostate-specific antigen level (OR, 2.71; P = .004), and 
the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score (OR, 1.69; P = .04) as 
independent risk factors. The HICI model (AUC, 0.87) outperformed the clinical 
imaging model (AUC, 0.81; P = .01). Conclusion The HICI model can noninvasively 
assess high-grade PCa. Keywords: MR-Diffusion Weighted Imaging, Prostate,

BACKGROUND: Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly 
improved overall survival (OS) for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung 
cancer (mNSCLC), there is a paucity of comparative effectiveness evidence to 
inform optimal first-line treatment selection.
OBJECTIVE: To compare OS among older patients with mNSCLC who received 
first-line atezolizumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used the 2014-2020 Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data and included patients aged 66 years 
or older, diagnosed with mNSCLC, and treated with first-line atezolizumab, 
nivolumab, or pembrolizumab. OS was compared using unadjusted, 
multivariable-adjusted, and propensity score matching (PSM) Cox proportional 
hazards models. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses by patient histology (squamous 
and nonsquamous) were also conducted.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 4,635 patients, 112 treated with 
atezolizumab, 251 with nivolumab, and 4,272 with pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab 
was associated with a significant survival advantage compared with atezolizumab 
(multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.53-0.84; PSM HR, 
0.69; 95% CI, 0.54-0.87) and nivolumab (multivariable-adjusted HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 
0.69-0.99) in both main analyses and sensitivity analyses. The OS difference 
between nivolumab and atezolizumab was inconclusive (multivariable-adjusted HR, 
0.73; 95% CI, 0.46-1.16; PSM HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.41-1.04). In subgroup analyses, 
differences in OS between pembrolizumab and nivolumab were not observed among 
patients with squamous histology (multivariable-adjusted HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 
0.65-1.11; PSM HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.89-1.49).
CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study, first-line pembrolizumab was 
associated with a significant OS benefit compared with atezolizumab and 
nivolumab among older adults with mNSCLC. For patients with squamous histology, 
OS differences between pembrolizumab and nivolumab were not observed. These 
findings support pembrolizumab as the preferred first-line treatment for older 
patients with mNSCLC, while highlighting the need for further investigation into 
the effectiveness of nivolumab specifically within squamous histology subgroups.

OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis systematically evaluated the efficacy of web-based 
interventions in reducing psychological distress in patients with cancer.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search of five major 
databases-PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane 
Library-through April 05, 2025. Following the PRISMA guidelines and the Cochrane 
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, we identified randomized 
controlled trials comparing web-based interventions to control conditions. We 
extracted standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) to quantify the effect sizes. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed 
using the I2 statistic, and predefined subgroup analyses were used to explore 
potential moderators. Two independent reviewers appraised the methodological 
quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, and the overall certainty of 
evidence was graded using the GRADE framework.
RESULTS: Twenty RCTs, including 2470 participants, met the inclusion criteria. 
Pooled analysis showed that web-based interventions significantly reduced 
psychological distress compared to controls (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI: -0.55, -0.18), 
with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 73.2%; p < 0.001). Studies assessing 
psychosocial distress as a primary outcome showed larger effects, contributing 
to heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses indicated that therapist-guided 
interventions produced greater reductions in psychosocial distress than 
self-guided approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: Web-based interventions provide a modest but significant benefit in 
alleviating psychological distress among patients with cancer, with greater 
efficacy when therapist support is included. Despite the substantial 
heterogeneity across trials, these findings underscore the scalability and 
accessibility of online mental health tools for oncology care. Future research 
should address optimal intervention components and delivery strategies to 
maximize clinical impact.

BACKGROUND: The Cancer Behavior Inventory Brief Form (CBI-B) allows assessing 
self-efficacy for coping with cancer as a personal resource of patients facing a 
diagnosis of cancer and its treatment. While psychometric analyses of CBI-B 
versions in other languages than English exist, the German version has not been 
analyzed more thoroughly in this respect yet.
AIMS: Against this background, we analyzed the factor structure, internal 
consistency, and criterion validity of the German 12-item version of the Cancer 
Behavior Inventory Brief Form, the CBI-B-D-12.
METHODS: Based on a pooled sample of N = 1034 cancer patients from various 
settings, we performed confirmative factor analyses, computed Cronbach's α and 
McDonald's ω for the 12-item summary scale, and determined criterion 
correlations with measures of patients' health-related quality of life, anxiety, 
depression, fear of progression, and fatigue.
RESULTS: With few adjustments, confirmative factor analysis revealed good fit of 
a 4-factor model identifying the same dimensions of coping self-efficacy as the 
original instrument (Maintaining Independence and Positive Attitude, 
Participating in Medical Care, Coping and Stress Management, and Managing 
Affect). With values of Cronbach's α and McDonald's ω being 0.89 and 0.88 
respectively, estimates of the scale's internal consistency were good, and 
criterion correlations further supported its validity.
CONCLUSIONS: The German 12-item version of the CBI-B represents a reliable 
measure of cancer patients' self-efficacy for coping with cancer that is valid 
in terms of factorial structure and correlations with major distress and quality 
of life criteria. It may thus be used in clinical practice and 
psycho-oncological research.

OBJECTIVE: The increasing number of young adult (YA) cancer survivors 
underscores the need for psychosocial interventions, which have been limited in 
scalability and their focus on mental health symptoms. We tested ""Achieving 
Wellness After Reaching the End-of-treatment"" (AWARE), an 8-week digital, 
coach-assisted intervention to promote hope and quality of life (QOL) in YA 
survivors.
METHODS: A 2-arm RCT compared AWARE versus attention control (AC) among 155 YA 
survivors (ages 18-39; Mage = 32.89, 87.7% female, 8.4% Hispanic, 22.6% racial 
minority) within 3 years post-treatment, all recruited online. We assessed 
feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy on hope and QOL at 
baseline, end-of-treatment (EOT), and 16-week follow-up (FU).
RESULTS: Both conditions showed high retention at EOT (94.2%; AWARE: 94.9% vs. 
AC: 93.5%) and FU (94.8%; AWARE: 96.2% vs. AC: 93.5%) and session completion (≥ 
75%). AWARE (vs. AC) participants reported greater program recommendation (90.5% 
vs. 83.3%), satisfaction (M = 4.16 vs. M = 3.68), and helpfulness of the 
educational recordings/transcripts (M = 4.07 vs. M = 3.69), reflections 
(M = 4.18 vs. M = 3.39), and coaching (M = 4.15 vs. M = 3.46, p's < 0.05). AWARE 
participants provided positive comments about program concepts/components and 
suggested more application opportunities including on key issues (e.g., guilt, 
anger, communication). Multivariable regression showed no associations between 
condition and hope or QOL; however, AWARE (vs. AC) showed greater effects on 
those with lower baseline hope, and bivariates showed AWARE's unique effects on 
hope's pathways and certain QOL dimensions at FU.
CONCLUSIONS: Feedback on AWARE was positive; yet, intervention revisions or 
greater focus on those with lower hope may enhance AWARE's utility in promoting 
hope or QOL.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), either by surgical or 
chemical castration, is the standard treatment for metastatic prostate cancer 
(PCa). ADT induces osteoporosis and increases the risk of osteoporotic 
fractures, such as hip fractures. However, the effect of castration on overall 
survival (OS) after hip fracture is unclear. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the association between ADT and OS among PCa patients with surgically 
treated low-energy hip fractures.
METHODS: Male patients with surgically treated low-energy hip fractures (ICD-10 
codes S72.0, S72.1, and S72.2) were retrospectively identified from the 
databases of Pirkanmaa Hospital District during the years 2002-2018. Patients 
with pathological hip fractures were excluded from the analysis. Patients with 
prior PCa were identified (n = 323) and categorized into three groups according 
to therapy that affects testosterone levels: no hormonal therapy (n = 94), ADT 
(n = 212), and nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) (n = 17) at the time of the 
fracture. The primary outcome was OS after hip fracture surgery. Postoperative 
OS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the difference in OS between 
groups was analyzed using Cox regression in univariable, age-adjusted, and 
multivariable-adjusted models.
RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis suggested that patients under ADT had 
shorter OS after hip fracture surgery (p = 0.006). After adjustment for 
potential confounders in Cox regression models, no clear association was 
observed between ADT (hazard ratio (HR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
0.90-1.58) or NSAA (HR 1.02 (0.59-1.78)) and OS when compared to patients with 
PCa not undergoing hormonal therapy. Higher age and comorbidities, rather than 
ADT, appeared to be associated with poorer OS.
CONCLUSIONS: In the cohort of patients with PCa, who underwent surgery for 
low-energy hip fracture, ADT or NSAA utilization was not associated with OS. 
Wide CIs allow for both modest benefit and potential harm, and the findings 
should therefore be considered inconclusive.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to demonstrate the real-life efficacy of 
BRAF and MEK inhibitors in patients with advanced thyroid cancer.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated the clinical efficacy 
of either a BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib) alone or a BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib) 
in combination with a MEK inhibitor (trametinib) in the treatment of 10 patients 
diagnosed with metastatic BRAF-mutant RAI refractory thyroid cancer. The primary 
endpoint was the investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR).
RESULTS: The median patient age was 68 years, 60% were men, and all patients 
were diagnosed with progressive BRAF V600E-mutant RAI-refractory papillary 
thyroid carcinoma (PTC). In total, 70% of the patients had been previously 
treated with multikinase inhibitors. One (1%) patient received a BRAF inhibitor 
alone and 9 (90%) patients received a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors. 
After treatment, 2 (20%) patients achieved a complete response, 5 (50%) patients 
achieved a partial response, 1 (10%) patient experienced stable disease, and 1 
(10%) patient experienced progressive disease. Seven (70%) patients had an 
objective response rate (ORR) (complete or partial response). Progression-free 
survival (PFS) was 70%, 40%, 30%, and 30% at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, 
respectively. The 12-month overall survival (OS) rate was 90%.
CONCLUSION: Dabrafenib in combination with trametinib was well tolerated and 
resulted in substantial clinical benefit, with notable PFS and sustained OS, 
even as a second-line treatment, in patients diagnosed with metastatic, 
progressive BRAF V600E-mutated, RAI-refractory thyroid cancer.

OBJECTIVE: Extranodal extension (ENE) is acknowledged as a significant 
prognostic factor associated with recurrence, distant metastasis, and reduced 
disease-specific survival in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma. However, 
the impact of the extent of extranodal extension on the clinical outcomes of 
these patients remains insufficiently understood. This study aimed to estimate 
the risk of detecting distant metastasis in patients with varying degrees of ENE 
according to a novel stratification method.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study utilizes medical records and 
slide reviews of papillary thyroid cancer patients who underwent therapeutic 
neck dissection. A new stratification system was developed, based on the 
circumferential rupture of the lymph node capsule. It is defined as Focal ENE 
when less than one-third of the lymph node capsule is ruptured and as Diffuse 
ENE when one-third or more of the capsule is involved.
RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients participated in the study, with 19% diagnosed with 
distant metastasis within a 96-month follow-up period. The presence of diffuse 
extranodal extension was associated with a risk approximately six times higher 
than in patients without ENE for the detection of distant metastasis at 96 
months, after adjustment for age group (HR = 6.41; 95% CI: 1.7-23.8; p = 0.006).
CONCLUSION: A greater extent of extranodal extension is linked to a heightened 
risk of detecting distant metastasis and should thus be considered in the 
therapeutic decision-making process.

Nano-theranostics using biodegradable polymers are effective for the diagnosis 
and treatment of intractable cancers; however, there is a need for technology 
that controls bioavailability and biodegradability without compromising 
biocompatibility. In this study, peptide nanoparticles (NPs) with controlled 
particle size and biodegradability were prepared by ionizing radiation and 
loaded with imaging agents and anticancer drugs to develop novel 
nano-theranostics for pancreatic cancer diagnosis and treatment. Peptides 
composed of histidine, glycine, glutamic acid, and an arginine-glycine-aspartic 
acid motif were synthesized by the solid-phase synthesis method. Their aqueous 
solutions were irradiated with γ-rays to produce NPs with a particle size of 
less than 50 nm, enabling penetration of the pancreatic cancer stroma. The 
radiation crosslinking of peptides, with or without the 
arginine-glycine-aspartic acid motif, in water was investigated by pulse 
radiolysis. Peptide NPs loaded with fluorescent labeling or magnetic resonance 
imaging agents were efficiently taken up by pancreatic cancer cells. 
Cisplatin-loaded peptide NPs produced by higher-dose irradiation suppress 
drug-release rates owing to their lower biodegradability. In conclusion, peptide 
NPs with controllable particle size and biodegradability were produced by 
ionizing radiation and loaded with fluorescent labeling agents, magnetic 
resonance imaging agents, and anticancer drugs to develop a new 
nano-theranostics drug for pancreatic cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Insulin resistance is an important risk factor for the development of colorectal 
cancer (CRC), and triglyceride-glucose (TyG) related indices, as emerging 
biomarkers of insulin resistance, have not been thoroughly studied in the 
context of CRC risk assessment. This study aimed to evaluate the relationships 
between three TyG-related indices-specifically triglyceride glucose-body mass 
index (TyG-BMI), triglyceride glucose-waist circumference index (TyG-WC), and 
triglyceride glucose-waist to height ratio index (TyG-WHtR)-and CRC risk within 
a large prospective cohort from the Kailuan Study (2006-2019), which included 
173,342 cancer-free participants. During a median follow-up of 14.23 years, 977 
incident CRC cases were identified. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards 
models revealed significant positive associations between the TyG-related 
indices and CRC risk: for TyG-BMI, those in the third and fourth quartiles had 
hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.22 (95% CI: 1.01-1.48) and 1.35 (95% CI: 1.11-1.64), 
respectively; for TyG-WC, the fourth quartile had an HR of 1.43 (95% CI: 
1.17-1.74); and for TyG-WHtR, the third and fourth quartiles had HRs of 1.28 
(95% CI: 1.05-1.57) and 1.37 (95% CI: 1.12-1.68), respectively. Dose-response 
analyses demonstrated linear relationships for all indices (all p for 
overall = 0.001, p for non-linear >0.05). The results show a significant 
association between elevated TyG indices and increased colorectal cancer (CRC) 
risk, suggesting that these markers may have potential value in risk 
stratification.

Epithelial ovarian cancer is a gynecological disease in which transformed cells, 
upon dissemination into the peritoneum colonize locales such as omenta and form 
metastatic foci. Colonization is an emergent outcome of the interactions between 
the invading cancer cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) of the peritoneal 
serosa. Although ECM is known to be remodeled in cancer, the dynamics in ovarian 
cancer of a major class of ECM-remodeling factors: the proteoglycans remain 
understudied. Here, we focus on Decorin, a proteoglycan with binding activity to 
the principal stromal ECM protein Collagen I and investigate its regulation of 
ovarian cancer colonization. We observe that Decorin is depleted in cancer 
deposits within omenta of cancer patients. The spreading of suspended spheroids 
of the ovarian cancer line SK-OV-3 on engineered Collagen I scaffolds is 
impaired when the latter is polymerized in the presence of Decorin. 
Decorin-supplemented Collagen I shows poorer fibrillar organization, which has 
been associated with slower kinetics of cancer cell migration. To our surprise, 
Decorin was also found to be depleted in primary tumor cells as well as in 
ovarian cancer cell lines compared with their controls. Overexpression of wild 
type Decorin, but not its glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-removed mutant in cancer cells 
decreased mean spheroid size, invasion through Collagen I matrix, and migration 
on fibronectin matrix scaffolds. Our results suggest that downregulation of an 
extracellular inhibitor of colonization occurs both in the seed and soil 
components of the metastatic toolkit; in addition, the GAG chains of Decorin may 
be crucial to its carcinomatosis-inhibiting functions.

Modifiable risk factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and excess 
weight, are associated with cancer incidence but data on their associations with 
population-based mortality among cancer patients are limited. Pooled data from 
seven health studies conducted in Finland during 1972-2015 were used to assess 
the associations of smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, physical 
inactivity, and education on mortality among 224,820 participants, of whom 
10,637 were diagnosed with colorectal, lung, pancreatic, prostate or breast 
cancer. We estimated age-standardized relative survival and relative excess 
risks of death (RER) using piecewise constant excess hazard models. Current 
smoking was associated with increased excess mortality in male pancreatic cancer 
(RER compared with never-smokers 1.54, 95% CI 1.08-2.19) and prostate cancer 
patients (1.55, CI 1.08-2.23), as well as in female lung cancer patients (1.44, 
CI 1.07-1.92). Obesity was associated with increased excess mortality in 
prostate cancer patients (1.56, CI 1.06-2.30) and physical inactivity in 
colorectal cancer (1.33, CI 1.01-1.76 in men; 1.36, CI 1.06-1.74 in women) and 
male lung cancer patients (1.15, CI 1.02-1.30). Excess mortality was 
systematically elevated among patients with low education with statistically 
significant associations for male lung and female pancreatic cancer. Several 
lifestyle-related factors were associated with increased excess mortality among 
cancer patients but not consistently over all cancer sites or in both sexes. It 
is notable that even in a Nordic welfare state with potentially equal 
healthcare, marked socioeconomic inequalities persist in mortality among cancer 
patients.

CATCH is a prospective precision oncology registry trial that exploits 
whole-genome/exome- and RNA-sequencing to enable actionable biomarker detection 
in metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients of any subtype. We herein report 
long-term follow-up of the first 558 patients consecutively recruited into CATCH 
in a monocentric setting between June 2017 and October 2021. Main outcome 
measures were the rate of implementation of molecular tumor board (MTB) 
recommended treatments and treatment response as assessed by disease control 
rate, objective response rate and PFS ratio. Out of the recruited patients, 412 
(54.9% HR+/HER2-, 31.3% TNBC, 6.8% HR-/HER2+ and 7.0% HR+/HER2+) were reviewed 
in the MTB. An appropriate molecularly guided anti-cancer treatment as 
recommended by MTB was implemented in 183 (44.4%) patients. Gene expression and 
computationally derived composite biomarkers further expanded treatment options 
in up to every second patient as compared to genomic sequencing data alone. The 
outcome was assessed in 152 patients and showed a Disease Control Rate (DCR) of 
58.6% and an Objective Response Rate (ORR) of 27.0%. One in three patients 
(32.8%) showed at least a 50% longer PFS with molecularly guided therapy 
compared to the previous standard therapy. Notably, 86.4% of the MTB-driven 
implementations were off-label. CATCH highlights the impact of 
whole-genome/exome in combination with RNA sequencing to detect clinically 
relevant biomarkers in mBC. Omics-guided targeted therapy in a real-world 
setting allows high treatment implementation rates yielding outcome benefit for 
one-third of the patients.

The complex relationship between gut microbiota and cancer therapy has received 
extensive attention, proposing gut microbiota modulation as a promising strategy 
for enhancing anticancer efficacy. In this work, tumor-repopulating cell-derived 
microparticles (3D-MPs) encapsulated with doxorubicin (DOX) are developed to 
improve cancer treatment outcomes through targeted interaction with gut 
microbiota, particularly Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK). This delivery system 
efficiently accumulates in the intestines via the integrin α5-fibronectin 
pathway, promoting AKK abundance through the pro-proliferative effects of 3D-MPs 
on AKK and the inhibitory action of DOX on competing gut bacteria, such as 
Helicobacter and Prevotella, for improved anticancer effects. Our findings 
demonstrate the potential of leveraging gut microbiota modulation to optimize 
therapeutic outcomes in cancer treatments, offering a novel approach to 
synergistic cancer therapy.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia is a prevalent and distressing issue for individuals with 
cancer, negatively impacting their overall well-being. While cognitive 
behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the recommended first-line treatment 
for insomnia in the general population, its effects on cancer populations 
warrant rigorous, ongoing evaluation. Previous meta-analyses assessing CBT-I 
against specific comparators in people with cancer have often exhibited 
methodological limitations. Furthermore, with a recent increase in randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs) in this field, an updated and comprehensive synthesis 
is necessary.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia 
(CBT-I) in people with cancer.
SEARCH METHODS: In April 2025, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and 
Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, and clinical trials registries. We 
also checked reference lists. We applied no language, publication date, or study 
setting restrictions.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all RCTs that compared the effects of CBT-I with 
other treatments in individuals diagnosed with both insomnia and cancer. We 
placed no restrictions on the specific characteristics of the CBT-I 
interventions or the comparator groups. We excluded quasi-randomised and 
cross-over trials.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used random-effects meta-analysis for our 
primary analyses. Our critical outcomes were: insomnia severity (Insomnia 
Severity Index (ISI), range 0 to 28), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index (PSQI), range 0 to 21), and serious adverse events (SAEs). Important 
outcomes were sleep diary-derived parameters: sleep onset latency (SOL), wake 
after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), and sleep efficiency (SE). We 
also analysed objective sleep parameters for the comparisons presented in the 
summary of findings (SoF) tables. We used the Cochrane risk of bias 2 (RoB 2) 
tool to assess risk of bias and the GRADE approach to assess evidence certainty. 
We interpreted findings for continuous outcomes against minimally important 
differences (MIDs).
MAIN RESULTS: We included 21 RCTs (2431 randomised participants, predominantly 
female adults). Participants had received treatment for a range of cancer types, 
with breast cancer being the most frequently studied, and most were cancer 
survivors undergoing or following cancer treatment. CBT-I was typically 
delivered via therapist-led sessions or digital programs (four to 12 weeks). We 
identified five comparisons and summarised the findings for the two primary 
comparisons, with outcomes assessed at the conclusion of CBT-I treatment. The 
risk of bias was often high. Overall, CBT-I may offer small subjective 
improvements in insomnia for cancer survivors, and the evidence certainty was 
mostly low to very low. Benefits on objective measures are less clear. CBT-I 
versus inactive control Compared to inactive control post-intervention, CBT-I 
may slightly reduce ISI scores (mean difference (MD) -5.86 points, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) -7.22 to -4.51; 14 studies, 1371 participants; very 
low-certainty evidence) and PSQI scores (MD -3.60 points, 95% CI -4.95 to -2.24; 
3 studies, 473 participants; low-certainty evidence). CBT-I may result in little 
to no difference in the occurrence of SAEs (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% CI 0.07 to 
16.77; 4 studies, 765 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Regarding 
sleep diary outcomes, CBT-I probably reduces SOL (MD -13.35 min, 95% CI -17.18 
to -9.51; 9 studies, 760 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), may reduce 
WASO (MD -15.39 min, 95% CI -25.23 to -5.56; 9 studies, 784 participants; very 
low-certainty evidence), and may improve SE very slightly (MD 7.84%, 95% CI 3.62 
to 12.06; 9 studies, 725 participants; very low-certainty evidence). CBT-I may 
result in little to no difference in TST (MD 6.43 min, 95% CI -8.30 to 21.16; 10 
studies, 899 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Regarding objective 
sleep outcomes, CBT-I may result in little to no difference in SOL (MD -4.54 
min, 95% CI -9.91 to 0.84; 2 studies, 129 participants), WASO (MD -5.08 min, 95% 
CI -10.62 to 0.46; 3 studies, 242 participants), TST (MD -11.01 min, 95% CI 
-29.35 to 7.33; 4 studies, 521 participants), and SE (MD 1.35%, 95% CI 0.08 to 
2.63; 5 studies, 571 participants). CBT-I versus aerobic activities Compared to 
aerobic activities post-intervention, CBT-I may reduce ISI scores (MD -3.53 
points, 95% CI -4.43 to -2.62; 2 studies, 406 participants; low-certainty 
evidence) and PSQI scores (MD -1.67 points, 95% CI -2.63 to -0.72; 3 studies, 
496 participants; low-certainty evidence). CBT-I may result in little to no 
difference in the occurrence of SAEs (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.36; 2 studies, 
579 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Regarding sleep diary outcomes, 
CBT-I may result in little to no difference in SOL (MD -6.15 min, 95% CI -13.07 
to 0.78; 2 studies, 131 participants; low-certainty evidence), WASO (MD -6.35 
min, 95% CI -15.30 to 2.61; 2 studies, 131 participants; low-certainty 
evidence), and TST (MD 0.40 min, 95% CI -21.10 to 21.90; 2 studies, 131 
participants; very low-certainty evidence). However, CBT-I may slightly increase 
SE (MD 4.24%, 95% CI 0.45 to 8.02; 2 studies, 131 participants; low-certainty 
evidence). Regarding objective sleep outcomes, CBT-I may result in little to no 
difference in SOL (MD 6.07 min, 95% CI -1.47 to 13.62; 2 studies, 131 
participants), WASO (MD 6.16 min, 95% CI -3.80 to 16.11; 2 studies, 131 
participants), and SE (MD -0.90%, 95% CI -2.84 to 1.04; 3 studies, 416 
participants), and may lead to shorter TST (MD -13.02 min, 95% CI -25.00 to 
-1.04; 3 studies, 416 participants).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This Cochrane review found very low-certainty to 
moderate-certainty evidence suggesting that CBT-I may offer small to very small 
improvements in patient-reported insomnia severity, sleep quality, and most 
subjective sleep diary parameters when compared with inactive controls. Against 
aerobic activities, low-certainty evidence indicates that CBT-I may also improve 
insomnia severity and sleep quality. The incidence of SAEs appeared similar 
between CBT-I and comparator groups, and the certainty of this evidence is very 
low. The decision to use CBT-I to treat insomnia in people with cancer might 
depend on the treatment's availability and cost, as well as clinicians' and 
patients' preferences. Future research requires long-term, larger, and more 
rigorously designed studies that are inclusive and diverse.

Following the publication of the above article, the authors drew to the Editor's 
attention that certain of the data in Fig. 6 on p. 74 had been assembled 
incorrectly. Specifically, the data panels showing the results of the 
SW1990/oVV/H&E and the SW1990/GEM/oVV/H&E experiments, and the 
SW1990/Gemcitabine/IHC‑Smac and the SW1990/GEM/oVV/IHC‑Smac experiments, 
respectively, contained overlapping sections, such that the data, which were 
intended to show the results of differently performed experiments, had been 
derived from the same original sources. Furthermore, upon performing an 
independent analysis of the data in the Editorial Office, it was noted that the 
data panels selected for the SW1990/oVV‑Smac/TUNEL and the 
SW1990/Gemcitabine&oVV‑Smac/TUNEL experiments also contained overlapping 
sections, and concerning the western blot data shown in Fig. 3B on p. 71, the 
Survivin protein bands were strikingly similar to data which had appeared in an 
earlier paper featuring some of the same authors in the journal Scientific 
Reports. After having re‑examined these figures, the authors realized that these 
additional cases of data duplication/re‑use were also in need of correction. The 
revised versions of Figs. 3 and 6, now showing the correct data for the 
SW1990/GEM/oVV/H&E, SW1990/GEM/oVV/IHC‑Smac and SW1990/oVV‑Smac/TUNEL 
experiments in Fig. 3, and the correct Survivin western blot data in Fig. 6, are 
shown on the next page. The authors wish to emphasize that the errors made in 
terms of the assembly of the data in these figures did not affect the overall 
conclusions reported in the paper. The authors are grateful to the Editor of 
Oncology Reports for granting them this opportunity to publish a Corrigendum, 
and apologize to both the Editor and the readership for any inconvenience 
caused. [Oncology Reports 41: 67‑76, 2019; DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6817].

CD44 serves a dual role in supporting tumor survival and promoting invasion. 
Claudin‑low breast cancer, characterized by a CD44+/CD24‑ phenotype and 
epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), displays aggressive behavior. The 
present study investigated the interaction between CD44 and TGF‑β signaling, and 
assessed the cellular effects of their combined inhibition. CD44 was knocked 
down in claudin‑low breast cancer cell lines (SUM159 and MDA‑MB‑231), and the 
TGF‑β receptor (TGFBR) inhibitor LY2109761 (LY‑61) was applied for treatment. 
Cell viability (MTT assay), apoptosis (annexin V assay), invasion (Transwell 
assay), colony formation and Smad2 phosphorylation (western blotting) were 
evaluated. CD44 knockdown reduced viability and increased apoptosis but did not 
markedly suppress invasion. Although TGF‑β stimulation enhanced Smad2 
phosphorylation, CD44 knockdown alone did not increase Smad2 activation, 
indicating that it does not directly regulate Smad2. However, LY‑61 inhibited 
TGF‑β‑induced Smad2 phosphorylation, effectively counteracting pro‑invasive 
signaling. Notably, while CD44 knockdown alone had a negligible impact on 
invasion, its combination with LY‑61 markedly reduced the invasive capacity and 
colony formation of cells compared with the control (control cells transduced 
with non‑targeting short hairpin RNA without LY‑61 treatment). LY‑61 induced S 
phase accumulation, which was more pronounced in SUM159 cells than in MDA‑MB‑231 
cells, indicating cell line‑specific effects on cell‑cycle regulation. Clinical 
data indicated that low CD44 expression was associated with improved survival in 
patients with claudin‑low breast cancer, despite its potential to enhance EMT 
signaling. These findings suggested that CD44 knockdown enhanced the response to 
TGFBR inhibition. Although CD44 depletion may increase EMT‑related signaling, 
invasion was primarily suppressed by TGF‑β blockade, and the combination with 
CD44 knockdown further enhanced the inhibition of proliferative phenotypes 
compared with either treatment alone. This dual‑targeting approach warrants 
further investigation in claudin‑low breast cancer.

attention by a concerned reader that the flow cytometric data shown in Fig. 2A 
on p. 4085 were strikingly similar to data that had either already been 
published previously in articles that were written by different authors at 
different research institutes, or were featured in articles that were submitted 
for publication to different journals at around the same time. Owing to the fact 
that the contentious data in the above article had already been published prior 
to its submission to Molecular Medicine Reports, the Editor has decided that 
this paper should be retracted from the Journal. After contacting with the

Esophageal cancer (EC), a malignant tumor occurring in the upper 
gastrointestinal tract, is the seventh most common cancer worldwide. Zinc finger 
proteins (ZNFs), the most abundant family of transcription factors in humans, 
serve an important role in the initiation and progression of various malignant 
tumors. However, the function of ZNFs in EC remains unclear. The present study 
aimed to elucidate the role of ZNF514 in the development and progression of EC 
and to investigate its underlying mechanism. The mRNA and protein expression 
levels of ZNF514 were assessed using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and 
western blotting. To assess functional roles, multiple cellular assays were 
performed, including 5‑ethynyl‑2'‑deoxyuridine incorporation, Cell Counting 
Kit‑8, wound healing, colony formation and Transwell assays. Subsequently, for 
transcriptomics analysis, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes analyses, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 
(IPA) were performed. In EC, ZNF514 exhibited high expression at both the mRNA 
and protein levels. Additionally, ZNF514 influenced the migration, invasion and 
proliferation of EC cells. Gene enrichment analyses and IPA demonstrated that 
ZNF514 knockdown significantly affected multiple signaling pathways, such as Fcγ 
receptors, the complement system, G‑protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)‑related 
receptors, the ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) pathway, Ras/MEK, PI3K/AKT, STAT3, 
nucleotide‑binding oligomerization domain‑containing protein (NOD) and NF‑κB 
pathways. In conclusion, the present study indicated that the anticancer 
mechanisms induced by ZNF514 knockdown may be related to the enhancement of Fcγ 
receptor and complement system activation, as well as the inhibition of GPCR, 
RSK, Ras/MEK, PI3K/AKT, STAT3, NOD1/2 and NF‑κB pathways.

Copper is an important trace element in the human body and plays an essential 
role in cells, where it is involved in synthesizing copper‑dependent enzymes, 
including superoxide dismutase, cytochrome c oxidase, tyrosinase, lysyl oxidase, 
dopamine‑β‑hydroxylase and other related copper‑containing enzymes. Copper 
overload or deficiency affects cell activity, leading to the development of 
neurodegenerative diseases or cancer. Neurodegenerative diseases, including 
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, as well as cancer, represent 
significant chronic health burdens. The complexity of their pathophysiological 
mechanisms, coupled with the limitations of current targeted therapies, 
complicates the development of effective treatments. This review provides a 
comprehensive overview of the current understanding of copper's regulatory 
mechanisms in health and disease, with particular emphasis on its roles in 
neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Recent advances in copper‑targeted 
therapeutic strategies, including copper chelators, ionophores and copper‑based 
nanoparticles, were highlighted. Furthermore, the clinical potential, key 
challenges and future prospects of these interventions were assessed. By 
synthesizing recent preclinical and clinical evidence, this review aims to 
contribute novel perspectives for improving the treatment of copper‑associated 
diseases.

AIM: To understand how genetic (homologous recombination repair [HRR], including 
BReast CAncer [BRCA]) testing is being embedded in clinical practice and 
identify testing challenges given global approvals of poly(adenosine 
diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) for metastatic prostate 
cancer (mPCa).
METHODS: Data from two Adelphi Real World Prostate Cancer Disease Specific 
Programmes™ (DSPs; 2020 and 11/2022-7/2023) were analyzed and compared using 
appropriate bivariate tests.
RESULTS: Genetic testing was performed among 45% (855/1899) of patients with 
mPCa (castration-sensitive [mCSPC]: 36%; castration-resistant [mCRPC]: 49%; HRR 
genes: 43% [34%; 47%]; BRCA: 42% [34%; 46%]). Testing increased from 2020: HRR 
genes by 17% (p < 0.01); BRCA by 18% (p < 0.01). HRR gene and BRCA mutations 
were reported in 16% (mCSPC: 13%; mCRPC: 18%) and 15% (13%; 16%) of patients, 
respectively. In the 2022-2023 DSP, 56% of physicians indicated they were more 
likely to conduct HRR gene testing following PARPi availability. Patient 
refusal, costs, reimbursement issues, low sample availability, and result delays 
were testing challenges. Among 40% of patients who spoke with physicians about 
testing, 83% were tested, and 49% reported knowing results helped.
CONCLUSIONS: Understanding physicians' and patients' experiences with, and 
challenges surrounding, genetic testing for PCa may facilitate better 
clinical-management interactions.

Plain Language Summary: What is this article about?Genetic testing for some 
genes (e.g., homologous recombination repair [HRR], including BReast CAncer 
[BRCA]) may help guide treatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer 
(mPCa). Testing rates and results, and physicians’ and patients’ views of 
testing, were studied using data from real-world surveys conducted in 2020 and 
11/2022–7/2023.What were the results?Almost half of patients with mPCa had 
genetic testing, about four in 10 had HRR gene or BRCA testing, and testing 
increased between surveys. Patients seeing medical oncologists were tested more 
often than patients seeing urologists. As per guideline recommendations, tested 
patients were younger, had worse disease, and were more likely to have a family 
history of cancer than non-tested patients. About four in 10 patients had HRR 
gene mutations, and almost all had BRCA mutations, indicating HRR gene testing 
beyond BRCA was not yet well-established and/or captured in patients’ records. 
Many physicians reported that BRCA test results were essential before starting 
treatment. Patient refusal was an increasing challenge to testing; other 
challenges were testing costs, testing reimbursement issues, low sample access, 
and test result delays. Notably, six in 10 patients did not or could not 
remember talking to their physicians about testing; among patients who did, most 
were tested and half said knowing results helped.What do the results of the 
study mean?Increased understanding of physicians’ and patients’ experiences with 
genetic testing may help physician-patient discussions about testing and PCa 
management, which likely would benefit from educational materials and tools.

BACKGROUND: Wound healing complications remain significant concerns following 
thoracoscopic surgery for lung cancer. Perioperative hematological indicators, 
particularly platelet counts and inflammatory markers, are crucial factors 
influencing wound healing. Given these gaps, we retrospectively investigated the 
effect of these indicators on postoperative wound healing outcomes in lung 
cancer surgery.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 200 patients who underwent 
thoracoscopic surgery for lung cancer. We assessed platelet counts, IL-6, IL-10, 
TNF-α, and other hematological markers. Patients were stratified by platelet 
counts into high and low groups. Correlations between these hematological 
parameters and clinical outcomes, including intraoperative blood loss, 
hospitalization duration, and wound healing status, were analysed.
RESULTS: Higher perioperative platelet counts were significantly associated with 
reduced intraoperative bleeding (p = 0.015) and shorter hospital stays 
(p = 0.019). The high platelet count group showed better Activities of Daily 
Living (ADL) scores three days post-surgery (p < 0.01). Elevated IL-6 levels 
preoperatively correlated with adverse wound healing outcomes (p < 0.05). 
Logistic regression analysis indicated that elevated IL-6 was a predictive 
marker for poor wound healing (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.15-1.48). Other markers, 
including IL-10 and TNF-α, were elevated postoperatively in the low platelet 
count group, indicating a heightened inflammatory response.
CONCLUSION: Perioperative platelet counts and inflammatory markers, particularly 
IL-6, significantly influence wound healing in lung cancer surgery. Higher 
platelet counts were associated with better early postoperative outcomes, while 
elevated IL-6 levels predict adverse wound healing events. Preoperative IL-6 
screening could flag patients who benefit from intensified anti-inflammatory 
care; multicentre trials with longer follow-up are warranted.

INTRODUCTION: Internet-based interventions have become a necessity in providing 
care. To assess quality-of-life perceptions among women living with breast 
cancer (BC) receiving any type of internet-based treatments.
METHODS: The present systematic review and meta-analysis were registered in 
PROSPERO with the ID no. CRD42024498834. All internet-based interventional 
studies among women living with BC assessing their quality of life perceptions 
before and after the intervention or between the usual and the intervention 
group were included. We consulted the British Nursing Database, CINHAL, Embase, 
Medline, Nursing & Allied Database, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science 
databases. Quality of life perceptions were assessed thanks to the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) and the EORTC-QLQ-core 
Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30).
RESULTS: The heterogeneity test findings of the eight studies exploring the 
FACT-B suggested that there was a significant heterogeneity among the selected 
studies (I2 = 68%, p = 0.002). The FACT-B mean score among women living with BC 
was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.08-0.53). The heterogeneity test among the four studies 
exploring the EORTC-QLQ-C30 score revealed that there was a significant 
heterogeneity among the selected studies (I2 = 74%, p = 0.009). The 
EORTC-QLQ-C30 mean score was 0.24 (95% CI: -0.11 to 0.58).
CONCLUSION: Internet-based interventions could ameliorate quality of life 
perceptions since most of the enrolled participants revealed as complicated the 
home community management allowing regular participation.

Profiling Inhibitor Scaffolds for the Cancer Target Jumonji-C Domain-Containing 
Protein 6.

The human 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase Jumonji-C domain-containing protein 
6 (JMJD6) catalyzes post-translational C-5 lysyl residue hydroxylation in 
multiple proteins. Aberrant JMJD6 catalysis is associated with the upregulation 
of androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7), which confers resistance towards 
antiandrogens used for prostate cancer treatment; JMJD6 is thus a promising 
cancer target. To date, few small-molecule JMJD6 inhibitors are reported, likely 
in part reflecting a lack of robust assays to monitor effects of small molecules 
on catalysis by isolated JMJD6. The use of solid-phase extraction coupled to 
mass spectrometry assays is described to screen scaffolds for the development of 
selective JMJD6 inhibitors. The results reveal that the reported JMJD6 
inhibitors WL12, SKLB325, and Compound 7p manifest relatively inefficient JMJD6 
inhibition in vitro. By contrast, some, but not all, clinically used inhibitors 
of the human hypoxia-inducible factor-α prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing 
proteins (PHDs) efficiently inhibit isolated JMJD6, in particular Enarodustat 
and Desidustat. The results identify attractive scaffolds for the development of 
selective, cell permeable JMJD6 inhibitors and suggest that JMJD6 inhibition is 
a potential off-target effect of PHD inhibitors in clinical use.

Fibrosis is a significant barrier to drug delivery in pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and contributes to its dismal prognosis. Pancreatic 
stellate cells (PSCs) drive fibrosis by excessively secreting extracellular 
matrix proteins such as collagen I. Collagen I is thought to physically obstruct 
the delivery of macromolecules, such as albumin, antibodies, and nanomedicines. 
Apart from its structural role, collagen signals through dedicated cell surface 
receptors, such as the discoidin domain receptors (DDR) 1/2. However, whether 
and how collagen signaling contributes to fibrotic barrier generation remains 
uncharacterized. Here, a 3D culture model of PDAC fibrosis constructed from 
patient PSCs is used to assess the contribution of DDR1/2-mediated collagen 
signaling. DDR1/2 inhibition diminishes collagen I expression in PSCs to enhance 
macromolecular delivery. Moreover, MEK inhibitors exacerbate the fibrotic 
barrier by up-regulating collagen I, an effect reversed by inhibiting DDR1/2. 
Through isoform-specific targeting, inhibiting DDR1, but not DDR2, is shown to 
be effective. Downstream of DDR, the involvement of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is 
demonstrated, particularly alternative mTOR complexes involving MEAK7 and GIT1. 
Altogether, the results show in vitro that DDR1-mediated collagen signaling 
exacerbates the fibrotic barrier and may be targeted to enhance macromolecular 
drug delivery in PDAC.

BACKGROUND: Cancer patients experience significant psychological and 
physiological challenges, affecting their treatment outcomes and overall 
wellbeing. Traditional gardening benefits mental health and quality of life but 
is often impractical, requiring alternatives. This pilot study evaluated the 
impact of indoor hydroponic gardening on cancer patients' mental health and 
quality of life.
METHODS: A case-crossover pilot study included 36 adult cancer patients from the 
Houston Methodist Cancer Center, with participants serving as their own control 
through repeated measurements. Participants received AeroGarden hydroponic 
systems and engaged in an 8-week gardening intervention. Mental wellbeing, 
mental distress, quality of life, fruit and vegetable consumption, and pain 
management were assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks using validated 
scales. Data were analyzed using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to 
account for within-subject correlations over time.
RESULTS: The study included 36 cancer patients with a mean age of 57.5 years. 
Significant improvements were observed in mental wellbeing scores 
(p-trend = 0.042), depression subscale scores (p-trend = 0.003), and global 
quality of life (p-trend < 0.001) over the 8 weeks. Emotional and social 
functioning scores also improved significantly (p-trend = 0.001 and 
p-trend = 0.010, respectively), along with increased fruit and vegetable intake 
(p-trend = 0.028). While overall pain management scores showed a decreasing 
trend, these changes were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that indoor hydroponic vegetable gardening 
can significantly improve mental health and quality of life in cancer patients, 
suggesting it as an alternative to traditional gardening. Future studies with 
larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm these 
findings and explore long-term benefits.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors of 
the male genitourinary system. The occurrence of metastasis significantly 
influences treatment strategies and prognosis. However, current risk assessments 
for metastatic disease primarily rely on single imaging or pathological 
indicators, which are often limited by suboptimal accuracy and considerable 
individual variability.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a high-performance predictive model for 
prostate cancer metastasis by integrating semiquantitative parameters from 
[18F]PSMA-1007 PET/CTwith key clinicopathological features.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from prostate cancer patients, 
includingPSMA PET/CT-derived features (SUVmax, SUVmean, PSMA-TVp, TL-PSMAp) and 
clinical-pathological variables (age, tPSA, Gleason score). Five machine 
learningalgorithms-Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, 
Naive Bayes, and XGBoost-were evaluated for metastasis prediction performance. 
Model performance was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and area 
under the ROC curve (AUC). Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) were applied to 
interpret the most effective model.
RESULTS: Among the five algorithms, the XGBoost model achieved an accuracy of 
90.32%, sensitivity of 90.0%, specificity of 94.74%, and an AUC of 0.8977. SHAP 
analysis identified PSMA-TVp, TL-PSMAp as the most important predictors, 
followed by SUVmax, tPSA, and Gleason score. These findings highlight the key 
role of PSMA-derived tumor burden in metastasis prediction. Force plots further 
revealed the individual-level contributions of features, supporting the model's 
clinical interpretability.
CONCLUSION: The XGBoost-based multimodal model integrating PET/CT 
semiquantitative parameters with clinicopathological data demonstrated excellent 
accuracy and interpretability in predicting prostate cancer metastasis. This 
approach has strong potential for clinical application and may provide a 
valuable tool for personalized treatment decision-making.

Metachronous colorectal cancers (mCRC) occur in ~3.4% of cases within 10 years 
of initial diagnosis, with risks elevated in hereditary conditions like Lynch 
syndrome. We report a case of a 78-year-old male with a history of left-sided 
colon cancer (pT2N0M) resected in 2015 without adjuvant therapy, presenting in 
2024 with a proximal ascending colon mass. The initial tumor was poorly 
differentiated adenocarcinoma, MLH1 and PMS2-deficient, and exhibited BRAF 
overexpression. The metachronous tumor was a moderately differentiated 
adenocarcinoma with a tumor mutational burden of 58 mutations/megabase and a 
BRAF V600E mutation. At the time of the second colon cancer diagnosis, germline 
testing was negative for Lynch syndrome, and Pembrolizumab was initiated due to 
the mismatch repair-deficient (MMR) status. The patient had a remarkable 
response to immunotherapy, with complete resolution of the colonic tumor on 
subsequent colonoscopies 3 and 6 months after initiation of immunotherapy with 
single-agent Pembrolizumab. Despite the absence of familial predisposition, 
microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) and MMR-deficient tumors confer 
increased mCRC risk. Surveillance remains critical post-resection, particularly 
in patients with MSI-H and MMR-deficient tumors, even without Lynch syndrome. 
Further studies are needed to elucidate mCRC risks and outcomes in non-Lynch 
syndrome, MSI-H colorectal cancer cohorts.

This study, based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 data, 
systematically analyzed the changes in the disease burden of early-onset 
pancreatic cancer (EOPC) attributable to high fasting plasma glucose (HFPG) and 
high body mass index (HBMI) among the global population aged 15-49 years from 
1990 to 2021 and predicted the mortality trends up to 2030. The results show 
that metabolic risk factors have a significant impact on EOPC: In 2021, the 
global deaths from EOPC attributable to HFPG reached 3,334 cases, 2.3 times 
higher than in 1990 with the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and 
age-standardized disability rate (ASDR) had average annual growth rates of 1.50% 
and 1.47%. The ASMR and ASDR growth rates attributable to HBMI were even higher 
(1.69% and 1.76%). The steepest ASMR increases occurred in low-middle 
socio-demographic index (SDI) regions with an average annual growth of 2.86%), 
while the highest absolute burdens were observed in East Asia, high-income North 
America, and Western Europe. Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model predictions 
indicate that by 2030, the ASMR related to HBMI will continue to rise in both 
sexes (from 0.90 to 1.65 per 100,000 in males and from 1.43 to 1.93 per 100,000 
in females), and the HBMI may exert a greater impact on females than HFPG. The 
study reveals the ""double burden"" phenomenon of metabolic risks: high-SDI 
regions have a high absolute burden due to the accumulation of long-term 
metabolic diseases, while low-middle SDI regions experience significant growth 
rates due to rapid urbanization and a lack of medical resources. Gender 
difference analysis shows that males generally have a higher ASMR than females, 
but the upward trend of metabolic-related mortality rates in females is more 
severe. The interaction between behavioral pattern changes in young people and 
metabolic abnormalities further exacerbates the risk. This study provides 
temporospatial evidence for the prevention and control of global EOPC, 
emphasizing the need to strengthen interventions for metabolic diseases in 
middle-and low-income regions, optimize the allocation of medical resources, and 
prioritize gender- and youth-specific interventions to curb the global spread of 
this aggressive cancer.

BACKGROUND: The Pediatric Organ Dysfunction Information Update Mandate (PODIUM) 
proposed consensus criteria to define organ dysfunction in critically ill 
children. However, utilization of the PODIUM criteria in pediatric oncology 
patients and those who have received hematopoietic cell transplantation or 
cellular therapy (post-HCT/CAR) may inaccurately classify organ dysfunction in 
these patients due to differences in organ dysfunction etiology, 
pathophysiology, and risk factors for adverse outcomes. To address this gap, we 
report a study protocol to systematically review the performance of the PODIUM 
criteria for pediatric cancer and/or those treated with HCT and determine if 
adjustments are needed.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study will be to [1] identify evidence-based 
criteria for organ dysfunction predicting adverse outcomes among pediatric 
oncology and post-HCT patients, [2] use these findings to inform adapted 
consensus criteria (PODIUM-Onc) for organ dysfunction tailored to this high-risk 
population through a multidisciplinary modified Delphi process, and [3] describe 
knowledge gaps to guide future research.
DATA SOURCE AND SEARCH STRATEGY: We will perform a systematic literature review 
of studies published since January 1, 2004, using the following databases: 
MEDLINE (via PubMed), CINAHL (via EBSCO), EMBASE (via Elsevier), and Web of 
Science (via Clarivate). Search results will be filtered using a pediatric 
search hedge and further refined to children (0 to 21 years old) during or up to 
1 year after treatment for cancer or HCT/CAR for malignancy. Publications 
without original data (e.g., comments, editorials, letters, notes, conference 
materials), studies with ≤ 10 patients, and those preceding January 1, 2004, 
will be excluded.
STUDY SELECTION: We will include original studies in any language published 
since January 1, 2004, that meet all eligibility criteria and for which a full 
text is available.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data extraction will include information related to study 
characteristics, hospital characteristics, underlying population 
characteristics, patient population characteristics, and outcomes.
DATA SYNTHESIS: We will extract and report data on the study, hospital, and 
patient characteristics, outcomes, and risk of bias.
CONCLUSION: By systematically reviewing and analyzing organ-specific factors 
associated with patient outcomes and synthesizing these findings through a 
modified Delphi consensus process, we aim to create consensus criteria that will 
be clinically relevant for pediatric oncology patients and HCT patients. These 
criteria will provide a foundation to guide clinical care and to support future 
research in this vulnerable patient population.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the influencing factors on the failure of sentinel lymph 
node (SLN) imaging in breast cancer by percutaneous injection contrast-enhanced 
ultrasound (CEUS).
METHODS: Clinical data including basic characteristics, medical history, 
ultrasound technical parameters, and laboratory findings were collected from the 
patients, and the pathological results of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) were 
used as the gold standard for all patients. Logistic regression was used to 
analyze all influencing factors. The performance of the model was assessed using 
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), P<0.05 was 
statistically significant. Nomogram was developed for the assessment of risk 
prediction.
RESULTS: A total of 1356 patients were included, of which 92.48% (1254/1356) had 
successful imaging and 7.52% (102/1356) had failed imaging. Logistic regression 
analysis showed that the quadrant location of tumor [(OR = 1.54, 95%CI: 1.01, 
2.36)], the history of previous breast surgery [(OR = 3.05, 95%CI: 1.62, 5.72)], 
the metastasis of SLN [(OR = 2.68, 95%CI: 1.72, 4.15)], the history of 
neoadjuvant therapy [(OR = 2.90, 95% CI: 1.57, 5.37)], and the clinical 
prognostic stage [(OR = 3.50, 95% CI: 1.70, 7.22)] were the independent 
influencing factors of CEUS failure, with a statistically significant difference 
(P<0.05). The AUC of its predictive model in the training set was 0.72 (95% CI: 
0.65-0.78), and the AUC of the predictive model in the validation set was 0.71 
(95% CI: 0.61-0.81).
CONCLUSIONS: The quadrant location of tumor, the history of previous breast 
surgery, the metastasis of SLN, the clinical prognostic stage and the history of 
previous neoadjuvant therapy were the independent influencing factors for the 
failure of CEUS for SLN imaging in breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) is an uncommon, benign histiocytic 
condition with an unclear underlying cause. It typically manifests as painless, 
bilateral, and significantly enlarged cervical lymph nodes. However, extranodal 
involvement can also occur, affecting the skin, nasal cavity, bones, orbital 
tissues, and central nervous system (CNS). Moreover, involvement of the 
respiratory system is observed in approximately 2% of cases.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 75-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with a 
one-week history of lumbar and back pain. Chest computed tomography (CT) 
identified a nodule located in the lung upper right lobe, characterized by 
spiculated margins and proximal bronchial atresia, raising suspicion for lung 
cancer. The patient subsequently underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy. 
Postoperative histopathological examination and immunohistochemical analysis 
confirmed the diagnosis of RDD.
CONCLUSION: Pulmonary RDD is rare and can be easily mistaken for other tumors or 
inflammatory diseases because of its nonspecific clinical and radiological 
features. Definitive diagnosis requires histopathological evaluation and 
immunohistochemical analysis.

School, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China.

Systematic lymph node dissection (SLND) has long been widely accepted and 
established as a standard surgical procedure for lung cancer. In recent years, 
with the increased detection rate of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) and the advancement of minimally invasive surgery and enhanced recovery 
concepts, approaches to lymph node dissection have undergone a notable shift. 
Previous studies have indicated that extensive removal of non-metastatic lymph 
nodes may offer uncertain clinical benefits. As a result, alternative strategies 
such as lobe-specific lymph node dissection (L-SLND) and lymph node sampling 
have gained attention among thoracic surgeons. In recent years, neoadjuvant 
chemoimmunotherapy for NSCLC has achieved remarkable success, with 
tumor-draining lymph nodes (TdLNs) playing a pivotal role in the efficacy of 
immunotherapy. Lymph node preservation strategies may synergize with 
immunotherapy by maintaining systemic immune surveillance. Conversely, the 
removal of non-metastatic lymph nodes could disrupt systemic immunity and exert 
secondary effects on primary tumors or potential micrometastases. This review 
summarizes the evolution of lymph node dissection strategies in lung cancer 
surgery and, in the context of encouraging outcomes with immunotherapy, provides 
new perspectives on future directions for balancing oncological control with 
immune preservation.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer, the deadliest gynecologic malignancy, is marked by 
high recurrence and poor prognosis. Exosome-like nanovesicles (ELNVs) derived 
from decocted traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas encapsulate key 
bioactive components, and show promising therapeutic efficacy with good 
biocompatibility and targeting ability. However, research on ELNV extraction 
methodologies remains limited. Yiqi Huoxue Jiedu Decoction (YQHXJDD), an 
empirically validated TCM formula for ovarian cancer, lacks systematic 
investigation into its ELNV isolation protocols and therapeutic mechanisms. This 
study took YQHXJDD as the research subject, with a focus on extracting ELNVs 
from this TCM formula and validating their anti-ovarian cancer activity.
METHODS: YQHXJDD was extracted using varied decoction protocols. ELNVs were 
enriched by gradient and ultracentrifugation, resuspended in phosphate-buffered 
saline, and were characterized by size and concentration using transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The number 
of ELNVs enriched per dose of YQHXJDD was calculated to screen the decoction 
method that maximized ELNV yield and aligned with clinical medication practices. 
The colloidal stability of YQHXJDD ELNVs was evaluated via zeta potential 
measurement, and the bioactive components of YQHXJDD ELNVs were identified using 
untargeted metabolomics and RNA sequencing. An ID8-Luc peritoneal tumor-bearing 
mouse model was established and randomized into three groups: model, YQHXJDD, 
and YQHXJDD ELNVs. Mice received oral gavage for 3 consecutive weeks. Tumor 
burden was monitored via in vivo small animal imaging. Immunofluorescence was 
used to quantify CD86, CD206, CD4, and CD8 fluorescence in omental tumors. 
Luminex xMAP® Multiplex Assay was used to detect 36 cytokines/chemokines in 
serum, and flow cytometry was used to analyze splenic immune cell proportions 
and activity.
RESULTS: The creation efficiency of ELNVs formed during decoction is the highest 
with the optimal protocol, which is identified for maximizing YQHXJDD ELNV yield 
and involves 40 min of high-heat treatment followed by an additional 30 min of 
low-heat treatment. Zetaview-based zeta potential analysis demonstrated that 
YQHXJDD ELNVs by this protocol had an average zeta potential of -35.52 mV, 
indicating favorable colloidal stability. Untargeted metabolomics analysis 
revealed ""Lipids and lipid-like molecules"" as the most abundant metabolite 
superclass (34.98% of total metabolites), while ""Carboxylic acids and 
derivatives"" represented the dominant subclass (11.66%). Regarding small RNAs, 
those enriched in YQHXJDD ELNVs were confirmed to be typical, functionally 
active small RNAs. Notably, miR8783 and other miRNAs exhibited significantly 
high expression, along with high conservation and abundance across samples, 
suggesting they might act as core regulators of YQHXJDD ELNV biological 
functions. In in vivo assessments, compared with the model group, YQHXJDD ELNVs 
significantly inhibited ovarian cancer growth and metastasis, increased tumor 
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels in mouse peripheral blood, and positively 
regulated the M1/M2 macrophage ratio and CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio in omental 
tissues (all P < 0.05). However, YQHXJDD ELNVs had no significant effect on the 
proportions of splenic effector T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, activated 
CD8+ T cells, and activated NK cells (all P ≥ 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The decoction ELNVs isolated from YQHXJDD can inhibit the growth and 
dissemination of ovarian cancer. The miRNAs and lipid components encapsulated in 
these ELNVs are presumed to be the critical mediators of these anti-ovarian 
cancer effects.

Cancer therapy and cancer drug discovery and development have been historically 
focused on specific cancers (tissue/organ of origin). However, with advances in 
molecular biology and multi-omics of cancer, there is a trend to develop 
pan-cancer therapeutic modalities. In targeted therapy, pan-cancer strategies 
target common molecular alterations across different cancer types and specific 
cancer strategies are tailored to the unique biological characteristics of 
individual tumor types. Each approach offers distinct advantages and 
limitations, and understanding these differences is critical in the era of 
precision oncology. Targeting key molecular drivers in cancer has significantly 
changed drug development, allowing for broad-spectrum therapeutic strategies 
that address shared oncogenic pathways across various tumor types. Among these 
drivers, RAS, PCNA, and MDM2 have become critical targets due to their roles in 
a broad-spectrum of cancer biology, e.g., cell proliferation, survival, and 
genomic stability. Advances in molecularly guided therapies have led to 
promising approaches for disrupting these pathways, offering new opportunities 
for cancer treatment. Despite significant progress in the past, challenges such 
as drug resistance, tumor heterogeneity, and toxicity remain obstacles to 
widespread clinical success. This review explores the historical development, 
current advancements, and future directions of RAS, PCNA, and MDM2-targeted 
therapies, emphasizing their potential to reshape cancer treatment through 
pan-cancer approaches using biomarker-driven technologies, combination 
strategies, and next-generation inhibitors. These advancements pave the way for 
more effective and durable therapies across a wide range of malignancies.

BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests metabolic syndrome (MetS) exacerbates 
sarcopenia progression and compromises nutritional interventions, yet its dual 
role as both etiological driver and therapeutic effect modifier remains 
uncharacterized. This study investigated MetS-related sarcopenia pathophysiology 
and assessed its impact on nutritional therapy efficacy in advanced gastric 
cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a dual-phase investigation combining 
Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis of European-ancestry GWAS data 
(n = 654,783) with retrospective evaluation of 65 sarcopenic gastric cancer 
patients receiving chemotherapy and enteral nutrition. MR evaluated causal 
relationships between individual components of MetS and sarcopenia phenotypes, 
while clinical analyses compared outcomes by MetS status (IDF/AHA criteria).
RESULTS: MR analysis of MetS components identified paradoxical causal effects: 
waist circumference increased appendicular lean mass (OR = 1.480, p < 0.001) but 
impaired walking speed (OR = 0.864, p < 0.001). In the clinical cohort, MetS 
patients exhibited accelerated nutritional decline with 2.6-fold greater weight 
loss (-1.70 vs. - 0.66 kg, p = 0.01), attenuated muscle preservation (48.1% vs. 
73.7% SMI improvement, p = 0.066), and reduced median PFS (75.0 vs. 84.5 days, 
p = 0.061). Protein trajectories revealed MetS-specific catabolic patterns, 
particularly transferrin depletion (Δ = -0.26 vs. - 0.05 g/L, p = 0.0004).
CONCLUSION: The integration of genetic and clinical findings shows that MetS 
components causally contribute to sarcopenia pathogenesis, and that the 
composite MetS phenotype confers nutritional therapy resistance. This 
establishes MetS's dual role as a driver of disease and a modifier of treatment 
efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Individuals undergoing lung cancer surgery often face significant 
postoperative challenges, underscoring the importance of identifying effective 
preoperative rehabilitation strategies to support recovery.
AIM: To identify rehabilitation interventions that can be implemented during the 
preoperative period for individuals with lung cancer undergoing thoracic 
surgery.
DESIGN: Scoping review guided by the Arksey and O'Malley methodological 
framework.
METHODS: The research question guiding this review was ""What rehabilitation 
interventions should be implemented in the preoperative period for individuals 
with lung cancer undergoing surgery?"" A comprehensive search was performed 
across five databases: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, CINAHL, ScienceDirect, and 
PubMed. The review included studies that addressed rehabilitation interventions 
before thoracic surgery for individuals with lung cancer.
RESULTS: A total of 19 articles met the inclusion criteria. The findings 
indicate that combining aerobic endurance, resistance, and respiratory training 
with preoperative education improves outcomes. In addition, nutritional 
counseling and brief relaxation/emotion-regulation strategies appear to be 
valuable components of multimodal prehabilitation programs, though evidence is 
limited.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative rehabilitation interventions have the potential to 
enhance functional reserve, reduce postoperative complications, and accelerate 
recovery in individuals undergoing lung resection for lung cancer.

OBJECTIVE: Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) infection is a recognized 
pathogenic factor in colorectal cancer (CRC), and extracellular vesicles (EVs) 
are key mediators within the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular 
composition of large extracellular vesicles (lEVs) derived from P. 
gingivalis-infected cancer cells remains poorly characterized. This study aimed 
to comprehensively define the molecular cargo alterations in lEVs secreted by 
CRC cells in response to P. gingivalis infection.
METHODS: An integrated multiomics approach was employed to analyze lEVs secreted 
by P. gingivalis-infected HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. miRNA sequencing and 
quantitative proteomics were used to profile miRNA and protein expression, 
respectively. Bioinformatic analyses identified differentially expressed 
molecules. Mechanistic studies involving immunoblotting and autophagy inhibition 
were conducted to validate and explore key findings.
RESULTS: P. gingivalis infection induced significant cargo remodeling in 
HCT116-derived lEVs. miRNA sequencing identified 223 miRNAs, among which 28 were 
differentially expressed. Notably, six novel miRNAs were specifically 
upregulated in lEVs from infected cells. Quantitative proteomics revealed 1,210 
significantly altered proteins. Strikingly, 981 proteins were downregulated, 
including the critical antitumor immune regulator STING (stimulator of 
interferon genes). STING downregulation in infected HCT116 cells was confirmed, 
and P. gingivalis infection was shown to promote STING degradation via 
autophagy, explaining its reduced incorporation into lEVs.
CONCLUSION: This integrated multiomics analysis demonstrates that P. gingivalis 
infection profoundly remodels the molecular landscape of CRC cell-derived lEVs. 
The specific depletion of immune-stimulating factors, most notably STING, within 
lEVs suggests a novel mechanism by which this pathobiont may contribute to 
immune evasion and promote tumor progression in P. gingivalis-associated 
colorectal cancer.

Emphysematous cystitis (EC) is a rare, gas-forming bladder wall infection, most 
commonly caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli) and typically seen in diabetic or 
immunocompromised patients. We report a case of a 50-year-old female with breast 
cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy who presented with hematuria, nausea, 
and vomiting. Imaging and laboratory workup revealed EC and concurrent 
osteomyelitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). She was treated 
with extended antibiotic therapy, leading to stabilization of the osteomyelitis. 
This report highlights the unusual role of P. aeruginosa, a less common 
gas-producing organism, in the pathogenesis of EC. We also review two additional 
cases of EC in oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy, with the underlying 
microbe being Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), and treated with 
appropriate antibiotics. These cases further emphasize the significance of EC in 
patients with metastatic cancer undergoing chemotherapy to prompt early 
investigation and guide treatment.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, 
highlighting the need for effective chemopreventive measures. Statins, commonly 
prescribed for cardiovascular disease, have demonstrated potential anti-cancer 
effects; however, epidemiological evidence remains inconsistent. This systematic 
review evaluates the relationship between statin usage and CRC risk, focusing on 
clinical outcomes. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a thorough search 
through PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase for relevant studies. Sixteen 
studies met our inclusion criteria, encompassing clinical and epidemiological 
research. Using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, 
we synthesized the data and assessed bias risk. Most studies (11/16) indicated a 
protective effect of statins, with risk reductions between 12% to 24% (e.g., 95% 
adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 0.87; CI: 0.83 to 0.91). However, conflicting 
findings were noted, including an increased risk of proximal CRC with long-term 
statin use (HR: 2.17) and neutral effects on metastatic CRC. Overall, statins 
show moderate chemopreventive effects against CRC, particularly in specific 
molecular subtypes. Discrepancies in outcomes may be attributed to differences 
in statin type, duration, and tumor biology. Future research should focus on 
biomarker-stratified randomized trials to refine statin-based prevention 
strategies.

Leishmaniasis is a tropical disease caused by Leishmania species, affecting 
millions of people worldwide and contributing to substantial morbidity and 
mortality. Advances in genetic engineering technologies, particularly 
CRISPR/Cas9, plasmid shuffling, and DiCre-based systems, have significantly 
enhanced our understanding of Leishmania biology. These approaches have enabled 
precise gene editing, functional analysis of essential genes, and the 
development of genetically attenuated strains with potential applications in 
vaccine design and drug discovery. Gene editing tools have also allowed the 
identification of key virulence factors and pathways involved in parasite 
survival and modulation of the host immune system. These insights have opened 
new directions for therapeutic strategies against leishmaniasis. Interestingly, 
recent findings highlight notable similarities between leishmaniasis and cancer, 
including immune checkpoint involvement, chronic inflammation, and shared 
molecular targets. Leishmania's ability to influence host immune responses and 
epigenetic mechanisms mirrors certain cancer-related processes. Moreover, 
compounds originally developed for cancer treatment, such as miltefosine and 
topoisomerase inhibitors, have shown effectiveness against Leishmania, 
supporting the potential for cross-applications. This review outlines recent 
developments in Leishmania genetic engineering and explores how these 
advancements can contribute to both anti-leishmanial and anti-cancer therapies. 
By emphasizing overlapping biological pathways and therapeutic targets, this 
work suggests innovative approaches to address two major global health 
challenges.

Nanoparticle-Mediated Ferroptosis for Cancer Therapy: Mechanisms and Therapeutic 
Strategies.

and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Lodz, 90-236, Poland.

Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, is increasingly 
leveraged in nanomedicine to sensitise tumours and overcome drug resistance. 
Driven by the Fenton reaction, ferroptosis results in lipid peroxidation through 
elevated intracellular iron levels and excessive production of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS). In this review, we outline the molecular markers of ferroptosis 
and define the criteria necessary to attribute ferroptosis induction to 
nanoparticles (NPs). We emphasise the importance of distinguishing targeted 
ferroptosis from non-specific ROS-mediated nanotoxicity and other types of 
programmed cell death. This distinction requires the use of lipophilic 
radical-trapping antioxidants (eg, ferrostatin-1, liproxstatin-1), iron 
chelators, and evidence implicating glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) or the 
system Xc- antiporter. Morphology is considered supportive but non-diagnostic, 
requiring converging evidence from both biochemical and genetic sources. We then 
compare various nanosystems designed to induce ferroptosis, such as iron-based 
nanoparticles, lipid nanocarriers, light-triggered nanoparticles, and 
magnetically induced nanocarriers, highlighting mechanistic patterns, efficacy 
determinants, and common pitfalls that often occur during biological 
investigations. Finally, we discuss translational challenges, including tumour 
microenvironment heterogeneity, NP protein corona dynamics, clearance and 
off-target effects. We aim to provide a framework that links NP design to 
ferroptotic mechanisms and clinically relevant outcomes, offering clear criteria 
and priorities for future research.

Cancer, a globally prevalent and life-threatening disease, remains a major area 
of focus in biomedical research. However, its substantial heterogeneity and 
complex pathogenesis continue to pose significant challenges for accurate 
diagnosis and effective treatment. The rapid advancement of epigenomic 
sequencing technologies has opened avenues by uncovering the epigenetic 
hallmarks and underlying pathology of cancer. As a result, these technologies 
have become invaluable tools in advancing cancer diagnostics and connecting 
research with clinical applications. This review briefly overviews epigenomic 
modifications and their significance in cancer diagnostics, highlighting 
potential epigenomic biomarkers with clinical applicability. We also examine 
emerging techniques in bulk and single-cell sequencing approaches, alongside 
spatial tools, highlighting their integration with multiomics technologies for 
cancer diagnostics. Particular attention is given to the analysis of key 
epigenetic characteristics, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and 
chromatin accessibility. Additionally, we summarize the diagnostic applications 
of these technologies and evaluate their current adoption in clinical settings. 
Challenges, limitations, and future directions for advancing epigenomic 
sequencing toward routine clinical diagnostics are also discussed. This review 
aims to provide scientists and clinicians with a comprehensive resource, 
encouraging further exploration and adoption of epigenomic sequencing 
technologies to drive progress in precision medicine.

Oral mucositis is a frequent and debilitating side effect in patients undergoing 
radiotherapy for head and neck cancers, often leading to pain, nutritional 
compromise and treatment interruptions. A prospective observational research was 
conducted on 60 patients undergoing radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy. 
46.7% of patients developed Grade 3-4 mucositis. Severe mucositis was 
significantly associated with low BMI (p = 0.031), hemoglobin <11 g/dL (p = 
0.007), tumor site (p = 0.016) and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (p = 0.001). 
Mucositis severity is influenced by nutritional and treatment-related factors. 
Early identification and targeted supportive interventions can improve clinical 
outcomes and reduce treatment disruptions.

University, New Delhi, India.

Accurate colorectal cancer diagnosis from histopathological images is crucial 
for effective treatment. Therefore, it is of interest to describe a novel 
framework that combines self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) with 
Grad-CAM-based interpretability for classifying hyperplastic polyp (HP) and 
sessile serrated adenoma (SSA). A ResNet50 encoder is first pre-trained using 
SSCL to learn rich feature representations from unlabeled images, minimizing the 
need for manual annotations which are then fine-tuned in a supervised setting, 
achieving a classification accuracy of 85.86%. Grad-CAM is used to generate 
visual explanations, highlighting critical regions influencing the model's 
decisions. This interpretable, data-efficient approach outperforms conventional 
CNN methods, offering improved diagnostic accuracy and enhanced trust in 
automated pathology.

diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Immunohistochemistry was 
used to assess markers including Ki-67, p53, EGFR and CK5/6. High Ki-67 and p53 
positivity were significantly associated with higher tumor grade and lymph node 
involvement. EGFR and CK5/6 expression correlated with basal-like features and 
poor differentiation. Data suggest that molecular profiling in TNBC may guide 
prognosis and targeted therapies.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of 
CT-based Peritoneal Cancer Index (CT-PCI) scores and serum CA-125 levels, 
assessed before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), in relation to 
surgical outcomes and survival among patients with advanced-stage epithelial 
ovarian cancer (EOC).
METHODS: This retrospective study included 96 patients with advanced EOC who 
received NACT followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) at Hanoi Medical 
University Hospital and the National Cancer Hospital (K Hospital), Vietnam, 
between 2019 and 2024. CT-PCI scores and CA-125 levels were assessed both pre- 
and post-NACT. The associations between these changes and surgical outcomes, 
particularly optimal cytoreduction, were analyzed.
RESULTS: The mean age was 59.17 years (SD = 9.78), with 94.8 % of patients 
diagnosed with high-grade serous carcinoma and 51.0 % classified as FIGO stage 
IIIC. Median CT-PCI scores decreased from 14.0 (IQR: 7.0-19.0) to 4.0 (IQR: 
2.0-8.0), and median CA-125 levels declined from 1248 U/ml (IQR: 389-2855) to 
31.25 U/ml (IQR: 16.75-147.3) post-treatment (both p < 0.01). Optimal 
cytoreduction was achieved in 84.4 % of cases. Post-NACT CT-PCI scores and 
CA-125 levels > 35 U/ml were significantly associated with suboptimal 
cytoreduction (cOR = 1.15, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.27, p = 0.01; and cOR = 5.26, 95 % 
CI: 1.38-33.00, p = 0.02, respectively). Median progression-free survival was 
20.5 months; median overall survival was 36.7 months.
CONCLUSION: Post-treatment CT-PCI scores and CA-125 levels are valuable 
prognostic indicators in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. Their reduction 
following NACT correlates significantly with improved progression-free and 
overall survival. These findings support their potential role in informing 
clinical decision-making and tailoring personalized treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are increasingly used in 
gynecologic oncology, with the DUO-E regimen-carboplatin, paclitaxel, and 
durvalumab-recently approved in Japan for advanced or recurrent endometrial 
cancer. However, ICI-related myocarditis (ICI-M) is a rare but potentially fatal 
adverse event requiring prompt recognition and treatment.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 74-year-old woman with advanced endometrial cancer 
developed ICI-M following four cycles of DUO-E therapy. Sixteen days 
post-treatment, she presented with fever and fatigue. Markedly elevated troponin 
I (39.8 ng/mL), new-onset complete right bundle branch block, and a reduced left 
ventricular ejection fraction (40 %) raised suspicion for ICI-M. Endomyocardial 
biopsy revealed diffuse CD8 + T-cell infiltration and myocyte necrosis, 
consistent with active myocarditis. High-dose methylprednisolone (1 g/day) was 
promptly initiated, resulting in rapid cardiac recovery and clinical 
stabilization. Chemotherapy was successfully resumed after steroid tapering.
CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of ICI-M during DUO-E therapy for 
endometrial cancer. It underscores the importance of early clinical suspicion, 
rapid multidisciplinary collaboration, and timely intervention in managing 
ICI-M, particularly in high-risk patients. Continuous vigilance is warranted 
throughout the course of ICI therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Ovarian cancer metastasis to the pericardium is rare. Surgical 
resection of such metastases is exceptionally uncommon, with only limited cases 
reported in the literature.
CASE REPORT: We report a case of platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer 
treated with surgical resection, including massive diaphragmectomy and 
pericardiectomy. The surgery involved removing an 8 cm diaphragmatic lesion and 
a 5 cm pericardial defect, which was intentionally enlarged to 7 cm to prevent 
incarceration. A patch repair was used for the large diaphragm defect. 
Postoperatively, the patient recovered well and subsequently underwent 
chemotherapy and targeted therapy without complications.
CONCLUSION: Ovarian cancer metastasis to the central tendon of the diaphragm can 
involve the pericardium, requiring complex and high-risk surgery. Such cases 
necessitate a multidisciplinary approach led by a team of experienced 
gynecologic oncologists.

OBJECTIVES: To report a rare case of immune checkpoint inhibitor 
(ICI)-associated myocarditis, myositis, and myasthenia gravis (MMM syndrome) in 
a patient with advanced endometrial cancer treated with dostarlimab, 
highlighting the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, in addition to the 
importance of biomarker-informed treatment selection.
METHODS: We report the case of a 75-year-old woman with unresectable stage IIIC2 
endometrial adenocarcinoma and mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency treated with 
carboplatin and paclitaxel, followed by dostarlimab. After initiation of 
dostarlimab, the patient presented with neuromuscular and cardiac symptoms, 
leading to the diagnosis of myocarditis, myositis, myasthenia gravis (MMM) 
syndrome requiring hospitalization. A multidisciplinary care including 
neurologic, cardiac, and critical care management was required.
RESULTS: The patient developed MMM syndrome 81 days after starting dostarlimab, 
presenting with bilateral ptosis, dysphagia, diplopia and respiratory 
compromise. Evaluation revealed elevated troponins, elevated creatine kinase, 
and a positive acetylcholine receptor antibody. Cardiac MRI confirmed 
myocarditis. Management included high-dose steroids, mycophenolate, IVIG, 
abatacept, and tofacitinib, with initial stabilization.
CONCLUSIONS: MMM syndrome is a rare but life-threatening complication of ICI 
therapy. Early recognition and multidisciplinary management are crucial. This 
case underscores the importance of weighing the risks and benefits of initiating 
immunotherapy and utilizing biomarker-driven clinical decisions.

INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality 
globally, with acute pulmonary embolism (APE) significantly worsening the 
prognosis of affected patients. Inflammatory pathways are increasingly 
recognized for their dual role in both oncogenesis and thrombotic events. This 
study aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of specific inflammatory 
biomarkers, particularly neutrophil-mediated mechanisms, in lung cancer patients 
complicated by APE.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on 90 lung cancer 
patients admitted to the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University 
between January 2019 and December 2022. Propensity score matching (PSM) was 
employed to ensure balanced demographic and clinical covariates. Multivariate 
logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors 
of APE occurrence and disease severity.
RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression identified elevated neutrophil count 
as an independent predictor of APE occurrence (adjusted OR = 3.068, 95% CI: 
1.472-6.394, p = 0.003). In the subgroup analysis of APE patients, hyperuricemia 
(UA >260.1 μmol/L; OR = 1.017, 95% CI: 1.002-1.033, p = 0.028) and a reduced 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR < 318.83; OR = 0.990, 95% CI: 0.981-0.999, 
p = 0.037) were significantly associated with increased disease severity and ICU 
admission. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis validated the 
strong discriminative capacity of neutrophil count (AUC = 0.952), UA 
(AUC = 0.782), and PLR (AUC = 0.792) in stratifying APE risk and clinical 
outcomes.
DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight neutrophilia as a potential biomarker for APE 
susceptibility in lung cancer patients. Furthermore, elevated uric acid levels 
and a diminished PLR may serve as valuable indicators of disease severity in 
this high-risk population. The study underscores the critical need to integrate 
these inflammatory markers into standardized clinical risk assessment frameworks 
to optimize therapeutic strategies and improve patient management.

BACKGROUND: This study explores the risk factors for ureteral stricture and 
tumor recurrence after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) in 
patients with paraureteral bladder cancer, aiming to provide references for 
clinicians in their treatment practices.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 164 patients with 
paraureteral bladder cancer who underwent TURBT from April 2017 to July 2024, 
among whom 133 patients had complete clinical data and follow-up data. 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify 
the risk factors for ureteral stricture and tumor recurrence after TURBT in 
paraureteral bladder cancer.
RESULTS: The incidence of ureteral stricture after TURBT in patients with 
paraureteral bladder cancer was 11.28% (15/133), and the recurrence rate of 
bladder cancer within 1 year after surgery was 21.80% (29/133). Multivariate 
logistic regression analysis showed that diabetes mellitus (p = 0.021) and tumor 
diameter (p = 0.002) were independent risk factors for ureteral stricture within 
1 year after TURBT. Additionally, multivariate logistic regression analysis 
revealed that sex (p = 0.021), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.008), and pathological T 
stage (p = 0.002) were independent risk factors for bladder tumor recurrence 
within 1 year after TURBT.
CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus and tumor diameter are independent risk factors 
for ureteral stricture within 1 year after TURBT in patients with paraureteral 
bladder cancer. Sex, diabetes mellitus, and pathological T stage are independent 
risk factors for bladder tumor recurrence within 1 year after TURBT in these 
patients.

Opioids are indispensable for managing cancer-related pain but carry risks such 
as immunosuppression, increased susceptibility to infections, and potential 
tumour progression. Balancing effective pain relief with these risks remains a 
critical challenge. This review examines the dual role of opioids in cancer pain 
management, highlighting their benefits, risks, and ethical implications while 
exploring strategies to mitigate adverse effects. Through a comprehensive 
literature review, we analysed mechanisms of opioid-induced immunosuppression, 
infection risks, tumour progression, and ethical prescribing practices. 
Additionally, strategies such as multimodal analgesia, opioid rotation, and 
personalised medicine were evaluated. Findings indicate that while opioids 
effectively alleviate cancer pain, they may suppress immune function, elevate 
infection risks, and potentially promote tumour progression. Mitigation 
strategies, including multimodal approaches, immunomodulatory interventions, and 
adherence to ethical principles (beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and 
justice), are essential for safe opioid use. In conclusion, opioids remain vital 
for cancer pain management but require judicious application to minimise risks. 
Future research should prioritise non-opioid alternatives and immunomodulatory 
therapies to enhance patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is a particularly aggressive 
tumor. Major responses to chemotherapy in TNBC do not necessarily correlate with 
better survival, indicating a need for further research into treatment 
strategies and underlying molecular mechanisms. This study is aimed at assessing 
the profile of Triple Negative Breast Cancer.
METHODOLOGY: This study retrospectively evaluated the profile of TNBC patients 
at Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja. Sociodemographic data, 
tumour grade, and type of chemotherapy administered were abstracted from the 
hospital's cancer register. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 
version 27.0, with associations between sociodemographic characteristics, tumour 
grade, and type of therapy established using chi-square tests. Key relationships 
were considered statistically significant at p-values ≤ 0.05.
RESULT: A total of three hundred and thirty (330) patients were recruited. The 
mean age of presentation was 49.96 ± 11.39 years, with the minimum and maximum 
ages of 22 and 80 years, respectively. The most represented age group was 
between 41-50 years, constituting about a third of all the patients. About three 
quarters of the tumours were moderately differentiated. Correlating tumour grade 
with the age of the patients was statistically significant, p value =0.05.
CONCLUSIONS: Triple-negative breast Cancers remain a moderately differentiated 
tumour and are seen predominantly in the middle-aged group.

BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy is now a cornerstone of first-line treatment for 
advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer (G/GEJC). However, optimal 
second-line options after progression on first-line immunotherapy are undefined. 
Given the established efficacy of cadonilimab in the first-line setting, this 
real-world study evaluated its combination with chemotherapy as a second-line 
treatment.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective study of patients with 
advanced G/GEJC progressing after first-line immunotherapy. Patients received 
either cadonilimab plus chemotherapy (Cohort A, n=50) or chemotherapy alone 
(Cohort B, n=62) as second-line therapy between October 2022 and April 2025. The 
primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included 
progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control 
rate (DCR), and safety.
RESULTS: Cohort A showed significantly improved outcomes. Median PFS was 4.9 
months (95% CI: 3.9-6.0) in Cohort A vs 3.8 months (95% CI: 2.8-4.8) in Cohort B 
(p=0.024). Median OS was 10.3 months (95% CI: 8.8-11.8) vs 7.4 months (95% CI: 
6.9-7.9), respectively (p=0.046). ORR was 34.0% vs 17.7% (p=0.048), and DCR was 
74.0% vs 54.8% (p=0.036). Safety was comparable between cohorts, with no 
treatment-related deaths.
CONCLUSION: Cadonilimab plus chemotherapy significantly improved efficacy 
outcomes versus chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced G/GEJC after 
first-line immunotherapy progression, with a manageable safety profile. This 
suggests cadonilimab based therapy is a promising second-line strategy. Further 
prospective randomized studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality and 
morbidity worldwide. Despite significant advancements in diagnostic techniques 
and therapeutic modalities such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, 
there is an urgent need for innovative therapeutic approaches due to severe 
adverse reactions, escalating multidrug resistance, an increased risk of tumor 
recurrence, and the complexity of the tumor microenvironment (TME). 
Nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems have emerged as a novel strategy for 
lung cancer treatment by enhancing drug targeting, reducing toxic side effects, 
and improving bioavailability. Chitosan (CS) has emerged as a promising 
candidate material for anticancer drug delivery carriers due to its unique 
physicochemical properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. This review 
summarizes recent research progress on CS nanocarriers for lung cancer treatment 
and elucidates their challenges and future prospects for clinical 
transformation.

INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer (LC) accounts for 26.4% of all cancer deaths in Hong 
Kong (HK). Lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) 
can reduce LC mortality. The cost-effectiveness of LDCT screening in high-risk 
individuals on the basis of smoking history has previously been investigated. 
However, nearly half of patients with LC in HK never smoke, indicating a 
different LC epidemiology compared with Western countries, where most LC cases 
are associated with smoking. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis for LCS, 
utilizing local data and expanding the target population to include we not only 
high-risk individuals identified on the basis of smoking history but also those 
identified through other risk factors.
METHODS: A decision tree combined with a state-transition Markov model was 
developed to simulate identification, diagnosis, and treatments for high-risk 
individuals, from a health care provider perspective. The selection criteria and 
screening effectiveness for high-risk individuals on the basis of smoking 
history were obtained from the Dutch-Belgian Lung Cancer Screening Study, 
targeting heavy smokers aged 50 to 74 years; whereas the Taiwan Lung Cancer 
Screening in Never-Smoker Trial was used to model high-risk individuals on the 
basis of factors other than smoking history. Local LC survival and cost data 
were used to populate the model. The willingness-to-pay threshold used in the 
study was US$24,302 to US$40,202 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
RESULTS: Screening led to additional early LC detected, and LC mortality 
reduction, compared with no screening. Over a lifetime horizon, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio for high-risk individuals on the basis of smoking 
history was US$14,122 per QALY. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for 
high-risk individuals on the basis of factors other than smoking history was 
lower at US$9610 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: LCS with LDCT can be considered cost-effective in HK for high-risk 
individuals on the basis of smoking history and factors other than smoking 
history, contributing to the health benefits of the population. Our findings 
support a population-based LCS for all high-risk individuals identified through 
criteria beyond smoking history.

Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) containing cancer information has become a key biomarker 
for cancer liquid biopsy. Current next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology 
for cfDNA detection often fail to capture multiomics information, such as 
fragmentomics, epigenetics, and genetics, in a single assay. Recently, Oxford 
Nanopore Technologies (ONT) has demonstrated advantages in acquiring cfDNA's 
multiomics data by a single sequencing run. In this review, we summarize the 
recent advancements in library preparation and bioinformatic analyses for cfDNA 
methylation, copy number variations (CNVs), as well as other biomarkers derived 
from cfDNA sequencing on the ONT platform. Furthermore, we highlight the latest 
research progress in the clinical applications of multi-dimensional cfDNA 
features and outline the future directions of nanopore cfDNA sequencing. 
Overall, this review updates the understanding of cfDNA detection using nanopore 
sequencing, providing valuable insights for studies of cfDNA in cancer.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of a pan-cancer 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel for 
predicting treatment response and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients 
with advanced solid tumors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 41 patients with advanced solid tumors, 
including gastric cancer (n=13), non-small cell lung cancer (n=10), head and 
neck cancer (n=9), esophageal cancer (n=7), breast cancer (n=1), and colon 
cancer (n=1), were prospectively enrolled and included in the analysis. ctDNA 
was analyzed at three time points: pretreatment (41 patients), post-treatment 
evaluation (37 patients), and follow-up (18 patients).
RESULTS: Among 41 patients analyzed at pretreatment, 35 (85.4%) exhibited tier 1 
or 2 somatic variants in ctDNA, with TP53 being the most frequently mutated 
gene. At the post-treatment evaluation, ctDNA was assessed in 37 patients (3 
with rapid deterioration and 1 lost to follow-up were not evaluable). Newly 
emerging variants after treatment were strongly associated with poor clinical 
outcomes. Consistent with the Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox proportional hazards 
regression confirmed that post-treatment ctDNA positivity was significantly 
associated with inferior PFS (HR 10.5, 95% CI 1.4-80.0, P=0.024). At follow-up, 
18 patients were evaluable, while the others were not due to follow-up loss, 
rapid deterioration, or study termination. ctDNA positivity at post-treatment 
evaluation was significantly associated with shorter PFS (median PFS, 5.0 months 
[95% CI: 2.0-12.0] vs not reached; HR, 4.87; 95% CI: 1.69-14.09; P = 0.0035).
CONCLUSION: Longitudinal monitoring of ctDNA using a pan-cancer NGS panel 
provides meaningful prognostic information in patients with advanced cancers. 
Post-treatment ctDNA dynamics may better reflect disease progression than 
baseline ctDNA status alone, highlighting the need for further validation in 
larger cohorts, particularly in gastric, lung, head and neck, and esophageal 
cancers.

Plain Language Summary: Cancer cells can release small fragments of their DNA 
into the bloodstream, known as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). These fragments 
can be detected through a blood test, often called a “liquid biopsy.” By 
monitoring changes in ctDNA over time, doctors can better understand how a 
patient’s cancer is responding to treatment. In this study, we analyzed blood 
samples from 41 patients with advanced cancers, including stomach, lung, and 
esophageal cancers. Using a genetic test called next-generation sequencing 
(NGS), we examined cancer-related DNA changes at three time points: before 
treatment, after the first round of treatment, and during follow-up care. We 
then assessed how these changes related to the time patients lived without their 
cancer worsening, a measure known as progression-free survival (PFS). We found 
that over 85% of patients had significant cancer-related DNA changes before 
starting treatment. After treatment, many patients developed new mutations, 
which were associated with shorter PFS. In contrast, patients without new ctDNA 
changes after treatment generally had better outcomes. These results suggest 
that ctDNA monitoring after treatment may provide better information about a 
patient’s status than testing before treatment alone. Ongoing blood-based 
monitoring could help guide future treatment decisions. However, larger studies 
are needed to validate these findings.

Membrane proteins on extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from clinical serum 
samples have emerged as promising biomarkers for cancer screening, early 
diagnosis and prognosis. However, high-throughput profiling of multiple EV 
proteins with high sensitivity and high selectivity is challenge for clinical 
applications. In this work, we synthesized a polymer capable of chelating a set 
of lanthanide ions labeled at the terminal of DNA aptamers. These lanthanide 
ions-labeled aptamers have high affinity for specific EV proteins. By utilizing 
ICP-MS, multiplex profiling was performed for four specific proteins on the 
surface of EVs with high sensitivity and selectivity for CRC diagnosis. Precise 
diagnosis of EVs from CRC patients were achieved with an accuracy of 89.9%, 
sensitivity of 86.3%, and specificity of 100%. This method features high 
sensitivity, low background, and rapid detection, demonstrating potential 
clinical application for in vitro diagnosis with blood samples.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is still the leading cause of 
cancer-related death. With the recognizing the importance of long non-coding RNA 
(LncRNA) in development and cancer, it is urgently to identify new LncRNA and 
understand the mechanism to develop novel therapeutic strategies.
METHODS: Nine CRC cell lines, 52,146 and 285 cases of normal colorectal mucosa, 
adenoma and CRC samples were utilized. Northern blot, rapid amplification of 
cloned cDNA ends, RNA pulldown, Mass spectrum, RNA immunoprecipitation, 
CRISPR/Cas9, fluorescence in situ hybridization assays and xenograft mice model 
were employed.
RESULTS: Lnc5q21.2 is identified to be a novel long intergenic non-coding RNA 
and its full length is 668 nt. Lnc5q21.2 is mainly located in cell nucleus and 
its expression is regulated by N6-methyladenine (6mA) modification. Compared to 
adjacent tissue, the levels of Lnc5q21.2 were increased significantly in CRC 
samples (P < 0.001), with a progression tendency from noncancerous colorectal 
mucosa, adjacent tissue, adenoma to CRC samples (P < 0.001). Lnc5q21.2 highly 
expression is associated with alcohol consumption and poor prognosis (both P < 
0.05). Lnc5q21.2 promotes cell proliferation, migration, invasion and cell cycle 
progression. Lnc5q21.2 activates Wnt signaling by interacting with homeobox A10 
(HOXA10) and down regulating empty spiracles homeobox 2 expression. Further 
study demonstrates that Lnc5q21.2 promotes DNA damage repair by enhancing ATR 
signaling. Lnc5q21.2 sensitizes CRC cells to ATR inhibitor both in vitro and in 
vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: Lnc5q21.2 is a novel lncRNA. Lnc5q21.2 promotes ATR pathway by 
activating Wnt signaling via interacting with HOXA10. Lnc5q21.2 sensitizes CRC 
cells to ATR inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sex steroid hormones have been hypothesized to be 
associated with the risk of gastric cancer (GC); however, it has not been widely 
validated in prospective studies. We aimed to investigate the associations 
between sex steroid hormone metabolites and the risk of gastric cancer and 
precancerous lesions in a prospective cohort of Chinese men.
METHODS: Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and 
electrochemical luminescence immunoassay, we examined 20 sex steroid hormone 
metabolites and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in serum from 470 eligible 
men, including high-grade lesions or GC (n = 32), intestinal metaplasia (IM, n = 
146), and 1:2 matched normal participants (n = 292) from 2007 to 2012. IM and 
normal participants were further followed up until December 2021, during which 
32 new GC cases were identified with a median follow-up of 11.8 years. 
Associations between baseline sex steroid hormone metabolites and IM, high-grade 
lesions and gastric cancer were assessed using logistic regression, and 
associations between sex steroid hormone metabolites and incident GC risk were 
assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression in the prospective analysis.
RESULTS: In the cross-sectional analysis, androstenedione levels were 
potentially associated with IM risk and significantly associated with high-grade 
lesions or GC risk (ORcontinuous = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.01-5.95). Higher 
concentrations of 17α-hydroxypregnenolone (ORcontinuous = 2.35, 95% CI: 
1.13-4.88), progesterone (ORcontinuous = 2.68, 95% CI: 1.09-6.61), and estrone 
(ORcontinuous = 5.36, 95% CI: 1.28-22.52) were also associated with an increased 
risk of high-grade lesions or GC. Furthermore, significant positive associations 
between GC risk and serum levels of SHBG (HRcontinuous = 2.57, 95% CI: 
1.04-6.36), epitestosterone (HRcontinuous = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.07-4.15) and 
pregnenolone (HRcontinuous = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.03-1.63) were identified in the 
follow-up study focusing on participants diagnosed as normal or IM. Notably, the 
subgroup analyses stratified by H. pylori status revealed similar associations 
between androstenedione, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, progesterone, estrone, SHBG, 
pregnenolone, and GC risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Several sex hormone metabolites were significantly associated with 
gastric cancer and its precancerous lesions, indicating a role for sex hormones 
in gastric carcinogenesis and potentially providing novel biomarkers for the 
identification of high-risk populations and risk prediction for GC.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the association between early 
testosterone (T) response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and clinical 
outcomes in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 366 mHSPC patients treated at 
The People's Hospital Bozhou and The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang 
Medical University. The participants were stratified by 1-month testosterone 
response: response group (T < 50 ng/dL) and non-response group (T > 50 ng/dL). 
The response group was further subdivided into ultra-low (T < 20 ng/dL) and low 
(20-50 ng/dL) response groups. Comparative analyses of baseline characteristics, 
progression to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and 
survival outcomes were carried out.
RESULTS: No significant intergroup differences were observed in Gleason score, 
tumor stage, prostate volume, initial PSA, PSA density, perineural invasion, 
visceral metastasis, or hazard level (all P > 0.05). However, the T non-response 
group exhibited a higher tumor load prevalence (76.77% vs. 60.10%, P = 0.004). 
The T non-response group demonstrated shorter mCRPC progression time (13.38 ± 
8.88 vs. 20.40 ± 11.91 months, P < 0.001), though no difference emerged between 
the T ultra-low and low response subgroups (20.59 ± 11.91 vs. 20.86 ± 12.19 
months, P = 0.876). Survival analysis revealed superior 3-year survival in T 
responders (P = 0.024), with T ultra-low responders showing significant 
advantages in both overall survival (P = 0.010) and 3-year survival (P = 0.001) 
compared to T low responders.
CONCLUSION: Ultra-low T levels (<20 ng/dL) after 1-month ADT can be used as a 
reference standard for predicting survival outcomes and may guide treatment 
optimization in mHSPC.

BACKGROUND: Currently, reliable and convenient markers for identifying patients 
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who benefit from neoadjuvant 
immunochemotherapy remains elusive. Established static biomarkers, such as 
programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and tumor mutational burden 
(TMB), exhibit limitations in capturing dynamic changes in the immune 
microenvironment and predicting treatment efficacy compared to dynamic 
biomarkers. This study aims to evaluate the value of dynamic peripheral blood 
markers in predicting pathological complete response (pCR) and survival outcomes 
in patients with NSCLC undergoing neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy.
METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, clinicopathological data, along with 
baseline and post-treatment laboratory results, were examined from 113 patients 
with NSCLC who received neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy between October 2019 and 
April 2023. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
algorithm was employed to identify candidate dynamic peripheral blood markers, 
which were then further refined using logistic regression. An integrated 
nomogram model incorporating the optimal biomarkers was developed to predict 
individual pCR. Event-free survival (EFS) was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier 
method, with comparisons performed via the Log rank test.
RESULTS: Dynamic alkaline phosphatase (dALP) and dynamic 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) emerged as independent predictors of pCR 
following neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy, as confirmed by LASSO and multivariate 
logistic regression. A predictive model, incorporating dNLR, dALP, degree of 
differentiation, and smoking history, demonstrated strong predictive capability 
(AUC = 0.745). Internal validation through bootstrapped resampling yielded a 
mean AUC of 0.728 (95% CI 0.686-0.749). Survival analysis revealed that patients 
who achieved pCR had significantly better EFS, and those with low dNLR and dALP 
values exhibited superior EFS compared to the high-value group.
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that dNLR and dALP can serve as independent 
predictors of pCR and EFS in patients with NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant 
immunochemotherapy. The pCR prediction model incorporating these two markers 
showed excellent predictive performance, providing valuable clinical guidance 
for selecting patients who are most likely to benefit from neoadjuvant 
immunochemotherapy.

BACKGROUND: The prognostic implications of systemic inflammatory markers in 
mismatch repair-proficient (pMMR) advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) treated with 
immunotherapy combined with targeted therapy remain unclear. This study aimed to 
identify key clinical and inflammatory markers predictive of overall survival 
(OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and to construct a nomogram for 
individualized outcome prediction.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 216 pMMR advanced CRC patients 
treated with camrelizumab plus bevacizumab between January 2020 and December 
2022. Baseline clinical variables and inflammatory indices, including 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), cancer-inflammation prognostic index 
(CIPI), and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), were analyzed. Patients 
were randomly assigned to a training set (n = 139) or a validation set (n = 77). 
Independent prognostic factors for OS and PFS were identified via multivariable 
Cox regression. A nomogram was constructed and internally validated using 
bootstrap resampling (1,000 iterations).
RESULTS: Elevated body mass index (≥25 kg/m2) was independently associated with 
improved OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.430; 95% CI: 0.185-0.980; p = 0.047), while 
elevated CIPI (>828.8) and carcinoembryonic antigen (>5 ng/mL) were associated 
with poorer OS (HR = 1.810, p = 0.045; HR = 2.440, p = 0.025, respectively). For 
PFS, SII ≥ 663.9 predicted worse outcomes (HR = 2.720; 95% CI: 1.200-6.200; 
p = 0.016). The nomograms demonstrated moderate discrimination with 
optimism-adjusted C-indices of 0.610 (PFS) and 0.650 (OS), and calibration 
curves showed good agreement. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed significantly 
poorer OS and PFS in high-risk groups defined by nomogram scores (p < 0.001 for 
both).
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the prognostic significance of both clinical 
and inflammatory markers in pMMR advanced colorectal cancer undergoing 
immunotherapy combined with targeted therapy. The developed nomogram facilitates 
individualized survival prediction, offering clinicians a practical tool to 
tailor treatment and follow-up strategies for improved patient management.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype defined by the 
absence of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 expression. It 
accounts for 10-20% of breast cancer cases, predominantly affecting younger 
women, and is associated with poor prognosis due to high recurrence rates and 
limited therapeutic options. Past treatment strategies relied solely on 
chemotherapy, but challenges such as metastatic potential and chemoresistance 
persisted. Recent advancements in neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy aim to address 
these limitations by combining chemotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, 
with promising clinical trial results demonstrating improved response rates and 
survival outcomes. A central focus is placed on biomarker-based immune 
monitoring strategies, encompassing both tissue-based biomarkers-such as 
programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, microsatellite instability, 
tumor mutational burden, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and gene 
expression signatures-and blood-based biomarkers, including gene expression 
profiling, comprehensive immunophenotyping, and cytokine profiling. In addition, 
an emerging role of advanced imaging technologies, such as immuno-positron 
emission tomography (immuno-PET) and radiomics, could permit real-time immune 
monitoring. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current 
landscape of immune monitoring in TNBC, highlighting its challenges, predictive 
and prognostic value, and potential to guide clinical decision-making. By 
addressing key immune response biomarkers, technical limitations, and emerging 
technologies, we seek to outline strategies for optimizing treatment and 
enhancing personalized medicine approaches for TNBC patients. Future integration 
of innovative monitoring techniques holds promise for improving patient 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: While the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab has improved 
outcomes for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the leading cause of cancer 
death in China, its standard fixed-dose regimen is costly. Given that studies 
demonstrate comparable efficacy between fixed and weight-based dosing, we aimed 
to compare the economic impact of these two dosing regimens in China.
METHODS: We conducted a one-year budget impact analysis from the Chinese payer 
perspective comparing fixed-dose (200 mg Q3W) versus weight-based (2 mg/kg Q3W) 
pembrolizumab regimens. Model parameters, including lung cancer epidemiology, 
treatment costs and market penetration rates, were derived from published 
studies and open-access databases. Scenarios with and without institutional vial 
dose-sharing were analyzed, and comprehensive one-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed to assess model robustness.
RESULTS: The standard fixed-dose regimen was projected to have an annual cost of 
$6.67 billion. In a dose-sharing scenario, the weight-based regimen reduced 
annual drug consumption by 34.41%, resulting in a total saving of $2.29 billion. 
This lowered the annual cost per patient from $86,392 to $56,661. Without 
dose-sharing, the weight-based regimen still yielded an annual saving of $76.93 
million. PSA confirmed the robustness of these findings, showing a 50% 
probability of achieving savings greater than $2.09 billion in the dose-sharing 
scenario.
CONCLUSION: Adopting a weight-based dosing strategy for pembrolizumab, 
especially when optimized with vial-sharing protocols, offers substantial and 
achievable annual cost savings for the Chinese healthcare system without 
compromising therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, this regimen should be considered 
as a potential first-line treatment option for patients with advanced NSCLC.

M2-type pyruvate kinase (PKM2) serves as the key rate-limiting enzyme in aerobic 
glycolysis within tumor cells, where its aberrantly high expression in numerous 
human malignancies facilitates tumor progression by enhancing glycolytic flux 
through diverse signaling pathways. Beyond its metabolic function, extensive 
studies have established PKM2 as a critical non-metabolic signaling regulator 
implicated in multiple oncogenic processes, including tumor proliferation, 
invasion, migration, immune evasion, and resistance to chemotherapy. The 
elucidation of PKM2-mediated oncogenic pathways has spurred the development of 
targeted therapeutic strategies, positioning PKM2 as a promising target in 
cancer therapy. However, comprehensive reviews addressing the relationship 
between PKM2 and tumorigenesis remain limited. This review systematically 
examines the biological functions of PKM2, the signaling mechanisms through 
which it exerts its effects in malignant tumors, and the latest advances in the 
development of PKM2-targeted therapeutics, offering insights into potential 
directions for future drug discovery.

BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is prevalent in patients undergoing gynecologic cancer 
surgery and may compromise postoperative immune competence. However, its 
specific association with early immune recovery remains unclear, and validated 
predictive tools are lacking.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 1,245 women who underwent 
curative surgery for cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer between March 2021 
and September 2023. Preoperative nutritional status was assessed using the 
Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), and patients were 
stratified into well-nourished and malnourished groups. Poor immune recovery was 
defined as lymphocyte count <1.0 ×109/L on postoperative day 3 (POD3). 
Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors, 
and a nomogram was developed and internally validated using ROC analysis, 
calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: Malnourished patients had a significantly higher risk of poor immune 
recovery (36.6% vs. 16.1%, P < 0.001) and postoperative complications. In 
multivariate analysis, malnutrition (adjusted OR: 2.41; 95% CI: 1.82-3.22), low 
BMI, anemia, elevated CRP, advanced FIGO stage, open surgery, preoperative 
lymphopenia, and older age were independently associated with poor immune 
recovery. The final model demonstrated good discrimination (AUC = 0.821; 95% CI: 
0.798-0.845) and clinical utility. The nomogram provides individualized risk 
estimates to guide perioperative immunonutrition strategies.
CONCLUSION: Malnutrition is an independent risk factor for impaired early immune 
recovery after gynecologic cancer surgery. Our predictive model offers a 
clinically applicable tool to identify high-risk patients and support 
personalized perioperative management. Future prospective validation is 
warranted.

FoxO3a is closely associated with the occurrence and development of tumors. The 
present study aimed to evaluate the effect of FoxO3a on apoptosis in breast 
cancer, and to clarify the regulation of the protein digestion and absorption 
pathway in two breast cancer cell lines, through interfering with the expression 
of FoxO3a. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were selected as the focal cells to study, and 
small interfering (si)RNA transfection technology was used to knockdown the 
expression of FoxO3a in both cell types. Clinical antitumor drugs were selected 
to treat cancer cells transfected with negative control sequences (si-NC) and 
sequences targeting FoxO3a (si-FoxO3a) in order to determine both the number of 
apoptotic cells and their morphology, and to assess migration levels using a 
wound healing assay. The cells were divided into si-NC and si-FoxO3a dosing 
groups for proteomics analyses, which were conducted using the differentially 
expressed proteins (DEPs) and the common signaling pathways were investigated. 
Finally, key proteins were validated using western blotting. First, the baseline 
expression levels of FoxO3a in two types of breast cancer cells were validated, 
confirming the presence of FoxO3a expression in both cell types. Next, FoxO3a 
was knocked down. Drug concentrations of tamoxifen (25 µmol/ml) and doxorubicin 
(30 µmol/ml) were selected for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. 
si-FoxO3a reduced tumor cell death, and the apoptosis rate of cells treated with 
si-FoxO3a was notably decreased, indicated by Hoechst staining with reduced 
brightness. There was also a notable increase in scratch healing rate. After 
screening of DEPs by proteomics analysis, Gene Ontology enrichment analyses 
revealed common molecular functions of DEPs in both breast cancer cell lines at 
the cellular component and molecular function levels, predominantly 
extracellular space and L-glutamine transmembrane transporter activity. Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional enrichment analysis demonstrated 
that the main signaling pathway involved in apoptosis of both cell lines after 
FoxO3a knockdown was the protein digestion and absorption pathway. 
Protein-protein interaction mapping results showed a close relationship between 
DEPs. Focal DEPs were validated, and the findings were consistent with the 
proteomics results. Overall, the results demonstrated that si-FoxO3a inhibited 
the apoptosis of breast cancer cells through the protein digestion and 
absorption signaling pathway.

OBJECTIVE: Deaths not associated with primary lung cancer (other deaths) and 
secondary malignancies affect long-term survival after surgery for early-stage 
non-small cell lung cancer. The JCOG0802 trial suggested that segmentectomy may 
lower the risk of such deaths. This study examined the relationship between the 
incidence of other deaths and surgical procedures.
METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study included patients with clinical 
stage 0 or IA non-small cell lung cancer who underwent segmentectomy or 
lobectomy between 2013 and 2016. Other deaths were defined as deaths from causes 
unrelated to the original lung cancer. Guideline-concordant treatment was 
assessed based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines.
RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival was 90.7%, with a median follow-up of 5.6 
years. Among 122 total deaths, 51 (41.8%) were other deaths. Segmentectomy (n = 
241) was associated with a lower rate of other deaths (2.5% vs 5.9%) than 
lobectomy (n = 758), including deaths from other malignancies (1.2% vs 2.6%) and 
nonmalignancy-related deaths (1.2% vs 3.3%). These findings remained consistent 
after adjusting for patient characteristic imbalances between the groups. 
Further, the rate of guideline-concordant treatment for secondary malignancies 
was higher in the segmentectomy group than in the lobectomy group (71.4% vs 
63.8%), with a 9.8% higher rate for second primary lung cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Segmentectomy was associated with a lower incidence of deaths not 
associated with primary lung cancer than lobectomy. The higher rate of 
guideline-concordant treatment for secondary malignancies in the segmentectomy 
group may partially explain the reduced incidence of deaths from secondary 
malignancies.

OBJECTIVE: Lung cancer screening reduces mortality, but the role of 
socioeconomic factors in screening rates is unclear. We used the Distressed 
Communities Index to evaluate how socioeconomic distress impacts lung cancer 
screening.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients screened for lung cancer at a 
single institution from July 25, 2016, to January 18, 2024. Distressed 
Communities Index scores ranged from 0 (no distress) to 100 (severe distress) 
and were grouped into quintiles. County-level US Census data were used for 
comparison.
RESULTS: Of 864 patients who underwent screening, 39%, 18%, 16%, 11%, and 16% 
were in the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth quintiles, respectively. 
Patients in distressed quintiles had increased rates of active cigarette use (P 
= .016), minority race (P = .002), and Medicaid health insurance (P < .001). 
Patients from the highest distress communities were overrepresented in 
screenings (screened: 16.2% vs county: 10.0%, P < .001), whereas those in 
mid-tier (screened: 16.4% vs county: 19.7%, P = .015) and at-risk (screened: 
11.1% vs county: 13.7%, P = .026) communities were marginally underrepresented. 
The screened population was predominantly of non-Hispanic White race (screened: 
85.0% vs county: 53.3%, P < .001). Hispanic (screened: 5.9% vs county: 30.6%, P 
< .001) and Asian (screened: 1.6% vs county: 4.5%, P < .001) populations, but 
not Black populations (screened: 5.3% vs county: 5.5%, P = .882), were 
underrepresented. Time to biopsy and malignancy rates were similar across 
Distressed Communities Index quintiles and racial groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Minorities face disparities in lung cancer screening access, but 
when screened, they have outcomes similar to those of nonminorities. The 
Distressed Communities Index effectively identified communities that could 
benefit from targeted interventions to improve screening access.

Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), also known as Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS), is a 
congenital growth disorder characterized by intrauterine and postnatal growth 
retardation, craniofacial disproportion, asymmetry, and other distinctive 
features. It was first described by Alex Russell and Henry Silver in the 50s of 
the 20th century. Its broad range of manifestations makes its true incidence 
difficult to determine. While gastrointestinal anomalies such as 
gastroesophageal reflux disease and esophagitis have been reported in SRS 
patients, an association with colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been described. 
Here, we present the case of a 31-year-old man with SRS who was referred to us 
for constipation. A rectal biopsy revealed moderately differentiated 
adenocarcinoma, and a staging CT scan demonstrated multiple lung and hepatic 
nodules.

Choroidal metastasis is a rare but significant manifestation of systemic 
malignancies, most commonly originating from breast and lung cancers. Metastatic 
spread to the choroid from colorectal cancer (CRC) is exceedingly uncommon, with 
limited cases reported in the literature. However, it poses a significant 
diagnostic and therapeutic challenge when it occurs. 33 years old female with 
Adenocarcinoma of the colon T3N0M0 initially treated curatively, developed lung 
metastasis 18 months later. At 23 months post-diagnosis, she presented with 
blurred vision and severe pain. Ophthalmologic exam and imaging (OCT, 
ultrasonography, MRI) confirmed a choroidal lesion with retinal detatchment. A 
comprehensive review of available case reports and series of choroidal 
metastases originating from colorectal cancer was conducted. Data on patient 
demographics, symptoms, diagnostic modalities, treatment options, and outcomes 
were analyzed. Choroidal metastasis from CRC serves as a red flag for extensive 
disease and the most common presenting symptom is visual impairment, including 
blurred vision, scotomas, or diplopia. Clinically significant implications of 
this case are indication of advanced systemic spread, need for prompt 
multidisciplinary evaluation through clinical examination, fundoscopic findings, 
and imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), 
ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) andtreatment options which 
include external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), systemic chemotherapy, and targeted 
therapies to control ocular symptoms and improve visual function. Early 
recognition allows for integrated systemic and ocular care, and targeted local 
therapy can meaningfully improve visual outcomes.

A 69-year-old man followed post lung cancer surgery for 6 years presented with 
back pain. His imaging revealed a pleural abscess and rib osteomyelitis along 
with the surgical site. Therefore, bone biopsy and culture were performed and 
the organism was diagnosed as Mycobacterium abscessus by PCR method. As such, 
the combination antibiotics therapy initiated with imipenem, amikacin, and 
clarithromycin, and then continued with faropenem, minocycline, clarithromycin, 
and moxifloxacin for 20 months, successfully surpassing the disease without 
additional surgery. Although the number of non-tuberculosis mycobacterial 
infection has been increasing, osteomyelitis caused by M. abscessus is extremely 
rare. This time, we describe the clinical course and current treatment strategy 
for M. abscessus.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive and treatment-resistant 
malignancy with a poor prognosis. Among the multifactorial mechanisms implicated 
in the progression of PDAC, oxidative stress, defined as an imbalance between 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defenses, has emerged as a crucial 
regulator of tumor behavior. While ROS can promote tumorigenesis via genomic 
instability, oncogenic signaling, and immune evasion, it also exhibits 
tumor-suppressive potential by inducing apoptosis and disrupting cancer cell 
metabolism. This dual role of ROS in PDAC is tightly influenced by the tumor 
mutational landscape, particularly KRAS gene mutations, metabolic reprogramming, 
and the tumor microenvironment. In PDAC, the generation of ROS promotes 
chemoresistance, activates hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, and facilitates 
desmoplastic stromal remodeling via pancreatic stellate cells and 
cancer-associated fibroblasts. Conversely, the therapeutic increase of ROS 
beyond tolerable levels induces cancer cell death through apoptosis and 
autophagy. This review comprehensively summarizes the dual role of ROS in PDAC, 
with particular emphasis on the molecular mechanisms underlying redox 
regulation. In addition, ROS-targeting therapeutic agents are categorized into 
clinically approved drugs, investigational agents, and natural compounds, and 
their relevance in redox biology is discussed. Finally, emerging therapeutic 
strategies that leverage redox vulnerabilities are outlined, and future research 
directions are proposed for the development of redox-modulating PDAC therapies.

Based on mRNA Expression Profiles of 57 Patient-Derived Colorectal Cancer 
Stem-Like Cell (CRC-SC) Lines Compared With Normal Colonic Epithelial Stem-Like 
Cells (NCE-SCs), we Identified Five CRC Subtypes. The First Subtype of CRC-SCs 
Showed Markedly Increased Expression of MUC12, PIGR, PLA2G2A, SLC4A4, and ZG16, 
Which Were Barely Detectable in the Other Subtypes. Importantly, Their 
Expression Correlated With Favorable Outcomes in Both the Discovery Cohort and 
Independent Two Test Cohorts From Public Databases. The Remaining Four Subtypes 
Showed High Expression of DEFA6, BST2, MAGEA6, or IGF2 Compared With NCE-SCs. 
Although the Expression of Each Gene Individually Influenced Patient Outcomes, 
Additional Co-Expressed Genes Within Each Subtype Were Also Associated With 
Prognosis. Furthermore, Integrating the Five Subtype-Specific Signatures 
Produced a Practical Prognostic Indicator, Designated as the General Colorectal 
Cancer Signature (GCS), and Provided Individualized Predictive Signatures for 
Each Patient. The Clinical Significance of GCS Was Further Validated in a Novel 
Orthotopic Xenograft Mouse Model, Which Recapitulated Patient Outcomes: CRC-SCs 
With Low GCS Scores Developed Distinct Liver and Lung Metastases, Whereas Those 
With High Scores Did Not. Apparent Associations Were Observed Between Activating 
RAS/RAF Mutations and BST2 Expression, and Between the Absence of SMAD4 Mutation 
and IGF2 Expression, but These Had no Significant Impact on Patient Survival, 
Suggesting That Driver Gene Mutations May Not Directly Influence GCS. 
Collectively, Our Findings Provide a Comprehensive Overview of Clinically 
Relevant Molecular Subtypes of CRC-SCs, Representing the Current Landscape of 
CRC Molecular Expression Subtypes. They Also Enable Rapid, Low-Cost Outcome 
Prediction and Suggest Potential Targets for Therapeutics Development.

Disruptor of Telomeric Silencing 1-Like (DOT1L) has emerged as a critical 
epigenetic regulator in cancer, primarily because of its role as the sole 
histone methyltransferase responsible for histone H3 at lysine 79 methylation. 
This modification affects transcriptional activation, DNA repair, and cell cycle 
progression. Its dysregulation is associated with both hematological and solid 
tumors. In Mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemia, DOT1L maintains 
aberrant gene expression patterns at loci such as HOXA and MEIS1, supporting 
leukemic stem cell survival and driving oncogenesis. In solid tumors, DOT1L 
influences diverse processes, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, 
angiogenesis, and cell cycle regulation, contributing to tumor growth and 
metastasis. Therapeutic strategies targeting DOT1L using inhibitors, such as 
EPZ-5676, have shown promise in preclinical and clinical studies, highlighting 
their potential as versatile targets for precision oncology. This review 
summarizes the recent findings on DOT1L's involvement in cancer development and 
its potential as a therapeutic target.

Rodent models for evaluating new cancer immunotherapies often fail to fully 
recapitulate the complexity of immune interactions that occur in cancer 
patients. Companion dogs with spontaneously developing cancers more closely 
resemble humans immunologically than rodents. This resemblance results in part 
because their immune systems have been educated early by repeated vaccinations 
and viral and bacterial infections, with further sculpting later in life by 
tumors that typically take months to develop. Moreover, dogs possess all of the 
major leukocyte subsets present in humans, both in circulation and within tumor 
tissues. The major canine cancer models most relevant to evaluating new cancer 
immunotherapies include osteosarcoma, glioma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, 
uroepithelial cancer, and head and neck cancers. Each of these cancers 
recapitulates to varying degrees the genetics, histology, and biological 
behaviors of the human analogous cancers. Immune therapies under active 
investigation in companion dogs include chimeric antigen receptor T-cell 
therapies, myeloid cell-targeted therapies, radioimmunotherapy, and tumor 
vaccines. Results of these ongoing studies are expected to accelerate the 
translation to humans of promising therapy combinations, while also identifying 
approaches that are ineffective or associated with unacceptable immunological 
toxicities.

Lung cancer remains a significant contributor to cancer mortality for several 
reasons. First, lung cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease. When 
combined with the dramatic resistance to treatment mediated by a tumor 
microenvironment (TME) that is inherently immunosuppressive, this explains the 
continued high mortality associated with lung cancer. The new era of treating 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), as well as 
achieving long-lasting treatment responses, is driven by immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD- 1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4. This treatment revolution 
may, in the future, be applied to isolated cases of relapse and recurrent 
disease, resulting in sustained therapeutic responses. In this review, we 
outline recent advances, including novel agent combinations and combination 
regimens tested in clinical trials that have become milestones, such as 
Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, Durvalumab, and emerging bispecific combinations. 
Targeted therapeutic delivery is now possible through nanotechnology and 
biomaterials, such as polymer nanoparticles and smart hydrogels, which allow 
high local drug concentration at the tumor site while reducing systemic 
toxicity. Predictive biomarkers, including PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational 
burden (TMB), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and radiomic features, are 
increasingly used to select patients and assess treatment responses in real 
time. Despite these advances, resistance to immunotherapy and immunerelated 
adverse events (irAEs) remain major challenges, emphasizing the need for ongoing 
innovation in personalized management, toxicity mitigation, and treatment 
strategies. Industry leaders are now exploring artificial intelligence to 
optimize treatment selection and predict adverse events and outcomes early. 
Ultimately, improved survival rates and enhanced patient experiences may be 
achieved through the integration of novel biomarkers, precision technologies, 
and more effective immunotherapies for lung cancer patients. Significant 
research is still required to overcome resistance mechanisms, optimize 
combination therapies, and enable individualized care in this rapidly advancing 
field.

The emergence of virus-like particles (VLPs) in cancer represents a promising 
research avenue for effective targeted therapies. VLPs structurally resemble 
viruses but lack genetic material and offer distinct advantages in cancer 
therapy, including targeting specific cancer cells, inducing immune responses, 
and delivering therapeutic payloads. Conventionally, VLPs can trigger apoptosis, 
stimulate immune-mediated cytotoxicity, or transport anticancer agents. Viral 
and non-viral-based VLPs have shown potential for cancer treatment, exhibiting 
preclinical efficacy which is observed in animal models. Furthermore, 
early-phase clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of 
VLP-based therapies, with limited efficacy in some cases. Despite these 
advancements, challenges such as immunogenicity, scalability, and delivery 
issues persist, necessitating further research to optimize VLP-based cancer 
therapies. Future directions encompass innovative strategies such as combination 
therapies and personalized medicine approaches to enhance the efficacy and 
clinical utility of VLPs. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the 
status of VLP-based cancer therapy, elucidating its mechanisms of action, types 
of VLPs utilized, preclinical and clinical studies, and challenges and future 
directions in this field. In conclusion, VLP-based cancer therapy has immense 
potential as a novel therapeutic modality, offering hope for improved outcomes 
and enhanced quality of life for patients with cancer in the future.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a common tumor in women, which significantly 
impacts their health and quality of life. The incidence of breast cancer has 
been increasing globally.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the preferences of Chinese women 
regarding breast cancer screening (BCS) during the COVID-19 pandemic and examine 
how these preferences influence their screening choices.
METHOD: The online DCE (Discrete Choice Experiment) questionnaire was designed 
through Sawtooth Lighthouse Studio (9.8.1) with the following selected 
attributes: acceptable hospital distances, acceptable hospital grades, duration 
of each screening, main screening method, total acceptable length of screening, 
and total cost of screening. Data were analyzed with a mixed logistic analysis 
after the data collection was completed. A latent class analysis was also 
performed to observe the screening preferences of participants, their 
willingness to pay, and to infer whether the distribution of preferences between 
the different parties was statistically significant.
RESULTS: A total of 397 people filled out the questionnaire, and 325 people met 
the inclusion criteria after being screened by trap questions. Each attribute is 
important in shaping participants' preferences for BCS provision. People 
preferred ""Ultrasound Screening,"" ""No side effects,"" higher medical 
reimbursement rates, and lower costs.
CONCLUSION: These findings provide valuable insights into the thoughts and 
preferences of participants regarding BCS. Healthcare providers should take 
these preferences into consideration to improve patient compliance and enhance 
the effectiveness and safety of clinical care.

CD47/signal-regulatory protein α (SIRPα) signaling enables malignant cells to 
evade macrophage-mediated phagocytosis, offering a promising strategy for cancer 
therapy via immune checkpoint blockade. However, this strategy is widely debated 
due to several safety risks revealed by clinical studies, including anemia. 
Here, a CD47-SIRPα immune checkpoint treatment is investigated that mitigates 
anemic side effects by selectively interfering with the costabilization of CD47 
and integrin αvβ3 on cancer cell surfaces, a phenomenon absent in erythrocytes. 
Multiplexed immunofluorescence analysis of 119 clinical breast cancer tissues 
reveals this costabilization. The engineered peptide PSFL-NK13 effectively 
disrupts this costabilization, which enhances macrophage phagocytosis and delays 
tumor growth, without causing anemia or promoting angiogenesis. Thus, a stable 
interaction is identified between integrin αvβ3 and CD47 on the cancer cell 
membrane that facilitates immune evasion and demonstrates that targeting this 
interaction offers a safer therapeutic strategy for various tumors.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) patients often have nutritional risks or 
malnutrition, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) tends to exacerbate 
malnutrition. Body composition parameters are associated with the prognosis of 
GC patients. Little is known about body composition changes during NAC and its 
role in clinical outcomes.
METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a Phase 3, open-label, multicentre, 
randomized clinical trial (RCT) (NCT01364376), assessing the usefulness, safety 
and efficacy of S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) vs. fluorouracil, leucovorin and 
oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as a perioperative chemotherapy regimen for patients with 
locally advanced GC. Pre-NAC and post-NAC computer tomography (CT) were 
collected to evaluate the prognostic role of skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and 
their dynamic change. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) 
rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: A total of 583 patients from 12 Chinese hospitals were enrolled. After 
exclusion, 423 patients who proceeded to surgery were used for further analysis. 
The median age was 60 (IQR: 54, 66) years, and 133 patients (31.4%) were female. 
Prior to NAC, 132 (31.2%) patients were diagnosed with sarcopenia. There was no 
significant difference in overall survival between sarcopenia and non-sarcopenia 
patients (p = 0.363). During NAC, most patients suffered skeletal muscle (SM) 
loss (n = 268, 63.4%), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) loss (n = 236, 55.8%) 
and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) loss (n = 254, 60.0%). Patients with SAT loss 
> 12.5% had significantly worse PFS (p = 0.005) and OS (p = 0.003) than those 
without. Patients with VAT loss > 15% had significantly worse PFS (p = 0.003) 
and OS (p = 0.004) than the stable or gain group. Patients with SMI loss > 4.7% 
had significantly worse PFS (p = 0.043) and showed a tendency of reduced OS 
(p = 0.181) than those without. In patients without sarcopenia, the incidence of 
grade 3/4 neutropenia in the FOLFOX group was higher than that of the SOX group 
(p = 0.019). In patients with myosteatosis, the incidence of Grade 3/4 
thrombocytopenia in the SOX group was higher than that of the FOLFOX group 
(p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: In this RCT study, patients with GC experience significant losses of 
muscle and adipose tissue during NAC. A high level of adipose tissue or muscle 
loss during NAC is prognostic of reduced survival in patients with locally 
advanced GC. Assessing and monitoring body composition can predict prognosis and 
effectively guide individual nutrition intervention and the prevention of 
complications.

Monoclonal antibodies are revolutionizing the landscape of current cancer 
treatment, bringing hope to patients with incurable cancers. B7-H3 (CD276) is an 
attractive therapeutic target for antibody-based therapy due to its low or 
absent expression in normal tissues and high expression in various types of 
tumors, including prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and high-mortality 
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In recent years, various 
B7-H3-targeting antibodies have been developed for cancer treatment, with a few 
making their way to clinical trials. One of the lessons learned from these 
practices is that for effective anticancer treatment, further modification of 
drug-like properties, particularly serum half-life, is crucial. In this project, 
we developed a humanized anti-B7-H3 antibody of strong affinity (KD = 0.545 nM) 
through a combined mouse immunization and phage display selection, followed by 
complementary-determining region grafting. Based on this work, we endeavored to 
further improve its half-life through engineering its constant fragment (Fc) by 
substituting two key amino acids, M428L and N434S. The resulting antibody, 
namely, A172-Hu3-LS, exhibited improved affinity to the neonatal Fc receptor 
(FcRn) while retaining its cytotoxicity against ESCC cells. Further 
investigation in the human FcRn transgenic mice demonstrated that this 
Fc-optimized antibody had a prolonged in vivo half-life (7.9 days) and potent 
antitumor activity. The significance of this Fc-engineering method lies in its 
ability to enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of therapeutic antibodies and 
holds potential for optimizing other therapeutic antibodies, paving the way for 
more effective and durable cancer treatments. While ESCC was the focus of this 
study, the broad expression of B7-H3 in various cancers suggests that this work 
may contribute to the treatment of other B7-H3-expressing tumors.

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) emerge as a potent cancer therapeutic strategy 
by enabling precise antigen recognition and efficient intracellular delivery of 
cytotoxic payloads. In this study, 7-ethyl-9-fluorocamptothecin (A2), a 
camptothecin derivative, which demonstrates potent tumor-suppressive effects 
across cellular models, patient-derived organoids (PDOs), and cell line-derived 
xenograft/patient-derived xenograft (CDX/PDX) models is identified. Through 
pull-down/mass spectrometry analysis, MAD2L1 is identified as the direct target 
of A2. A2 specifically binds to the Lys73 site of MAD2L1, activating the 
cGAS-STING pathway and thereby inducing apoptosis in bladder cancer cells. To 
address the dose-limiting toxicity caused by A2's insufficient targeting 
capability, LZU-WZLYCS01, a novel FGFR3-targeting ADC for bladder cancer with A2 
as its cytotoxic payload is developed. LZU-WZLYCS01 exhibits precise 
FGFR3-dependent targeting, with significantly reduced antitumor activity in both 
FGFR3-knockout cell models and xenograft models. Moreover, in vivo fluorescence 
imaging demonstrates the potent tumor-targeting capability of LZU-WZLYCS01. 
LZU-WZLYCS01 demonstrates remarkable bystander effects in an in vitro co-culture 
model, along with potent tumor growth inhibition in PDOs and CDX/PDX models 
while maintaining favorable safety. Notably, LZU-WZLYCS01 shows superior 
antitumor efficacy to gemcitabine-cisplatin (GC) chemotherapy and 
maintains significant activity in GC-resistant PDX models. These 
findings present a promising therapeutic candidate for targeted bladder cancer 
treatment.

Chimeric antigen receptor-natural killer (CAR-NK) cells are emerging as a 
promising platform for allogeneic, cell-based immunotherapy. Among available 
sources, NK cells derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) provide a renewable 
and scalable option that overcomes the limitations of primary NK cells. Human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a membrane protein frequently 
overexpressed in many solid tumors, is an attractive target for cancer 
immunotherapy. In this study, we designed a green fluorescent protein 
(GFP)-linked anti-HER2 CAR construct and introduced it into PSCs via lentiviral 
transduction. Three stable PSC-derived clones (CAR-A, CAR-B, and CAR-C) were 
established, each co-expressing anti-HER2 CAR with GFP. After differentiation 
under xeno-free and feeder-free culture conditions, CAR expression was 
maintained in NK cells. The resulting PSC-derived CAR-NK cells displayed 
phenotypic and functional features comparable to wild-type PSC-derived NK cells, 
while showing markedly enhanced cytotoxicity against HER2-positive cancer cell 
lines. These findings demonstrated the potential of the use of PSC-derived 
anti-HER2 CAR-NK cells as a robust and scalable immunotherapy. In addition, this 
platform could be extended to produce CAR-NK cells directed against a wide range 
of tumor-associated antigens.

BACKGROUND: Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) status in rectal cancer (RC) without 
lymph node metastasis (LNM) can significantly influence the patient's treatment 
decisions. This study aims to develop and validate a combined model based on MRI 
radiomics features integrated with clinical immune-inflammatory biomarkers for 
the prediction of LVI status in RC without LNM. The Shapley Additive Explanation 
(SHAP) method was employed to visualize the prediction process and enhance 
interpretability for clinical application.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from 257 RC patients without LNM from 
two centers. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were 
performed on clinical data to identify independent predictors of LVI. Volumes of 
interest were manually delineated on T2WI and ADC sequences, and corresponding 
radiomic features were extracted. A combined model was constructed by combining 
rad-score and clinical immune-inflammatory biomarkers, and the SHAP was used to 
visualize the prediction process.
RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) of the combined model was based on 
intratumoral features (training vs. testing vs. validation datasets: 0.813 vs. 
0.854 vs. 0.807). The AUC of the combined model was based on both intra- and 
peritumoral features (training vs. testing vs. validation datasets: 0.855 vs. 
0.841 vs. 0.860). After comparison, the combined model (C + Q) based on intra- 
and peritumoral MRI radiomics features integrated with clinical 
immune-inflammatory biomarkers demonstrated better predictive performance.
CONCLUSION: The combined model (C + Q) has great potential in the non-invasive 
prediction of LVI in RC without LNM, providing a basis for stratified management 
and individualized treatment decisions for RC patients.

INTRODUCTION: Esophageal cancer (EC) ranks 7th globally in cancer mortality, 
with smoking being a major preventable risk factor, particularly for squamous 
cell carcinoma predominant in Asia. This study quantifies the global burden of 
smoking-attributable EC among males using 2021 Global Burden of Disease data 
(1990-2021) and projects trends to 2040.
METHOD: Data on deaths and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for global 
burden of smoking-attributable EC among males were derived from the Global 
Burden of Diseases (GBD) Study 2021, along with the corresponding 95% 
uncertainty intervals (UIs). We analyzed with Joinpoint regression, 
age-period-cohort modeling for risk stratification, decomposition analysis, and 
Bayesian prediction.
RESULTS: Global smoking-attributable EC deaths and DALYs among males decreased, 
concentrated in middle-to-high SDI regions. Age-standardized DALY rates (ASDR) 
declined significantly, with sharpest reductions in medium-SDI regions. East 
Asia bore disproportionate burden in China and Mongolia. Critical inflection 
occurred in 2004 by joinpoint and age-period-cohort analysis from 1990 to 2021. 
Mortality peak at 80-90 years and disability peak at 60-80 years. Decomposition 
analysis showed population growth and aging increased burden, offset by 
epidemiological improvements. Predictive analysis indicated stable-to-declining 
ASRs through 2040, contingent on sustained tobacco control in high-risk regions.
CONCLUSION: The analysis indicated a global downward trend in EC attributable to 
smoking among males. While absolute burdens rise due to demographic pressures, 
declining ASRs reflect tobacco control progress. The 2004 inflection underscores 
policy impact, and East Asia's outsized burden necessitates targeted 
interventions. Our research underscores the profound influence of high BMI on EC 
attributable to smoking among males and provides a research foundation for 
future public health decision-making.

BACKGROUND: Primary liver cancer (PLC) ranks as the third leading cause of 
cancer-related mortality worldwide, posing a serious global public health 
burden. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common subtype, accounting 
for approximately 75%-85% of all PLC cases. In recent years, environmental 
pollution has emerged as a potential risk factor for PLC. However, a systematic 
bibliometric analysis of global research trends in this field remains lacking. 
This study aims to perform a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to explore 
global trends in the field of environmental pollution and PLC research from 2000 
to 2025.
METHODS: We conducted a bibliometric analysis using the Web of Science Core 
Collection database, covering studies published from January 2000 to March 2025. 
CiteSpace was used to analyze publication trends, global collaborations, and key 
research areas through network visualizations and co-occurrence analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 562 publications were included in this study, with China and 
the United States identified as the leading contributors. Prominent institutions 
in this field include the National Institutes of Health (USA), National Cancer 
Institute (USA), and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Among journals, 
Environmental Health Perspectives, Hepatology, and Cancer Research were the most 
frequently cited, indicating a close connection between environmental science 
and oncology. Keyword analysis revealed that research focuses not only on 
traditional pollutants such as air pollution and heavy metals, but also on 
emerging exposures including volatile organic compounds and drinking water 
contaminants. Mechanistic studies remain at the core of this field, with 
frequently occurring terms such as ""oxidative stress"", ""gene expression"", and 
""inflammation"". Meanwhile, clinical research-related keywords like 
""epidemiology"" and ""follow-up"" have become increasingly prominent in recent 
years, indicating a growing emphasis on population-based risk assessment.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the growing research interest in the link 
between environmental pollution and PLC. Cross-disciplinary collaborations 
between environmental science, medicine, and public health are increasingly 
influencing the development of this field. Future research should focus on 
elucidating the carcinogenic mechanisms of pollutants and enhancing 
translational applications in public health.

BACKGROUND: Imidacloprid (IMI) has been widely used in agriculture and is 
increasingly infiltrating urban environments. This study aimed to investigate 
the role of IMI in the development of bladder cancer (BCa) and its potential 
molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: IMI-related genes were obtained from the CTD database. Differentially 
expressed IMI-related genes (DEIRGs) in BCa were identified through differential 
analysis of RNA-seq data from TCGA database, followed by KEGG and GO enrichment 
analyses to explore their biological functions. Ten machine learning algorithms 
and their combinations were applied to construct prognostic models based on 
DEIRGs in TCGA cohort, with external validation in two independent cohorts 
(GSE13507 and GSE31684). Multivariate Cox regression analyses were further used 
to develop a DEIRG-based risk score model for patient risk stratification. Drug 
sensitivity analyses were performed using the pRRophetic R package. Molecular 
docking was conducted using the CB-Dock2 tool. Colony formation, wound healing, 
and transwell invasion assays were used to evaluate the biological behaviors of 
BCa cells. Real-Time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) and 
western blot analyses were performed to evaluate the expression levels of key 
genes.
RESULTS: A total of 138 DEIRGs were identified, which were enriched in pathways 
including insulin resistance, chemical carcinogenesis, cAMP, FoxO, and AMPK 
signaling. Machine learning models based on these genes demonstrated robust 
prognostic performance across all three cohorts. Five key genes (SREBF1, PRELP, 
TGFBI, TNFAIP2 and TACR3) were further selected via multivariate Cox regression, 
and patients in the high-risk group exhibited significantly worse prognosis than 
those in the low-risk group (all p < 0.05). A nomogram integrating the risk 
score and clinicopathological features enabled individualized survival 
prediction. The high-risk group was more sensitive to drugs such as 
Rizavasertib, Saracatinib, and Motesanib, whereas the low-risk group was more 
sensitive to drugs such as Rucaparib, Veliparib, and Axitinib. Molecular docking 
demonstrated strong binding affinity of IMI to these five target proteins. In 
vitro experiments further showed that IMI at occupational exposure 
concentrations (10 ng/mL) in urine significantly promoted the proliferation, 
migration, and invasion of BCa cells. RT-qPCR and western blot analyses 
confirmed that IMI exposure upregulated the expression of SREBF1, PERLP, and 
TGFBI, and downregulated the expression of TNFAIP2, while having no significant 
effect on TACR3 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that IMI may promote BCa development and sheds 
light on potential molecular mechanisms. Moreover, a DEIRG-based risk 
stratification model may facilitate personalized treatment decisions for BCa 
patients.

Breast cancer (BC) presents persistent therapeutic challenges due to tumor 
heterogeneity, therapy resistance, and immune dysfunction, further compounded by 
emerging evidence of microbiome involvement in disease progression. Pathogenic 
bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum have been implicated in modulating 
immune evasion, remodeling the extracellular matrix, and influencing therapy 
outcomes. Conventional microbiome-modulating strategies (e.g., antibiotics, 
probiotics) suffer from non-specificity and potential dysbiosis. Nanomaterial 
(NM)-based microbiome modulation offers a transformative alternative by 
enabling: targeted elimination of tumor-associated pathogens (e.g., 
Gal/GalNAc-functionalized nanoparticles for F. nucleatum), bacterial 
membrane-coated nanoplatforms for precision antimicrobial delivery, and 
multifunctional nanosystems that modulate the tumor microenvironment (TME) while 
preserving beneficial microbiota. This review explores NM-based microbiome 
modulation across BC contexts, including localized drug delivery, 
immunomodulation, and microbial niche editing. Highlighted strategies include 
lipid-based antimicrobial nanoparticles (NP), metallic NPs enhancing therapy 
sensitivity, and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)-inspired nanoformulations 
for microbiome balance. Synergies with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and 
radiotherapy are evaluated, alongside preclinical findings demonstrating 
improved tumor control and microbiome resilience. Finally, challenges in 
clinical translation, including toxicity, immunogenicity, and scalability, are 
discussed, with future directions emphasizing smart nanosystems capable of 
microbiome-responsive, biomarker-guided, and immune-integrated interventions in 
BC therapy.

Type I interferon (IFN) has long been known as a critical component of the 
molecular machinery that first responds to viral infection in multicellular 
eukaryotes. More recently, type I IFN signaling has also emerged as a common 
process in the microenvironment of naturally developing neoplasms, as well as 
tumors responding to (immuno)therapy. In this setting, robust, acute but 
ultimately resolving type I IFN responses appear to support natural and 
therapy-driven cancer immunosurveillance by a number of mechanisms, including an 
accrued propensity of malignant cells to arrest their proliferation and undergo 
apoptotic cell death, as well as broad immunostimulatory effects on CD8+ 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs) 
and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Conversely, weak, indolent and 
ultimately non-resolving type I IFN responses de facto facilitate tumor 
progression, not only by promoting stemness in malignant cells (which is 
associated with increased metastatic dissemination and resistance to therapy), 
but also by favoring the establishment of a highly immunosuppressive lymphoid 
and myeloid tumor microenvironment. Here, we provide a critical discussion of 
the context-dependent impact of type I IFN signaling on cancer progression and 
response to treatment, focusing on the tumor-intrinsic and extrinsic factors 
that may account for such a heterogeneity.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly revolutionizing the landscape of 
oncological research and the advancement of personalized clinical interventions. 
Progress in three interconnected areas, including the development of methods and 
algorithms for training AI models, the evolution of specialized computing 
hardware, and increased access to large volumes of cancer data such as imaging, 
genomics, and clinical information, has converged, leading to promising new 
applications of AI in cancer research. AI applications are systematically 
organized according to specific cancer types and clinical domains, encompassing 
the elucidation and prediction of biological mechanisms, the identification and 
utilization of patterns within clinical data to improve patient outcomes, and 
the unraveling of the complexities inherent in epidemiological, behavioral, and 
real-world datasets. When applied in an ethical and scientifically rigorous 
manner, these AI-driven approaches hold the promise of accelerating progress in 
cancer research and ultimately fostering improved health outcomes for all 
populations. We review examples demonstrating the integration of AI within 
oncology, highlighting cases where deep learning has adeptly addressed 
challenges once deemed insurmountable, while also discussing the barriers that 
must be surmounted to facilitate broader adoption of these technologies.

Ammonia has long been regarded as the end-toxic product of hepatic metabolism. 
Under normal physiological conditions, ammonia is metabolized through the urea 
cycle; however, its metabolic imbalance is closely related to various diseases, 
including hepatic encephalopathy, liver fibrosis, and cancer. Ammonia-induced 
cell death, specifically the selective death of immune cells, has emerged in 
recent years as a new form of cell death in the field of tumor biology, offering 
a new perspective on the regulation of tumor cell fate. This review creatively 
focuses on the role of ammonia in tumorigenesis, development, and treatment 
resistance. We systematically reviewed the sources and dynamic balance of 
ammonia in the tumor microenvironment and found that it plays a key role in 
tumor metabolic reprogramming by regulating glutamine metabolism, mitochondrial 
function, and lysosomal stability in tumor cells. Ammonia can also induce the 
selective death of immune cells, reshape the immune cell map in the tumor 
microenvironment, and regulate the anti-tumor immune response. Mechanistically, 
we analyzed the multi-level network of ammonia metabolism regulation, including 
the role of glutamine synthetase, the mTOR signaling pathway, and epigenetic 
modification in ammonia death. In addition, this review emphasizes the 
importance of ammonia as a potential target for cancer therapy and proposes 
multimodal strategies combining metabolic regulation and immunotherapy to 
achieve precision in cancer treatment. Finally, the comprehensive map of ammonia 
in the tumor ecosystem was constructed, highlighting its potential clinical 
value as a new anti-cancer target.

BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype with 
poor prognosis and limited targeted therapies. The Hippo signaling pathway, 
critical in tumor progression, may harbor key genes influencing TNBC behavior. 
However, the specific genes and their clinical significance remain unclear.
METHODS: We analyzed the GSE45827 dataset from the GEO database using 
differential gene expression analysis (DEG) and weighted gene co-expression 
network analysis (WGCNA) to identify TNBC-related genes. We enriched Hippo 
pathway-related genes from the MsigDB database and literature to identify 
candidate genes (HRGs) that may affect TNBC progression. The Boruta algorithm 
further screened for core genes, which were validated by immunohistochemistry in 
TNBC and other breast cancer tissues. Finally, we explored the biological and 
pharmacological significance of the target through drug prediction, molecular 
docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and in vitro experiments.
RESULTS: DEG analysis identified 2,888 differentially expressed genes, and WGCNA 
yielded 276 TNBC-associated genes. Intersection analysis with 70 hypoxia-related 
genes (HRGs) revealed four key genes: TEAD4, WWTR1, AREG, and SOX11. TEAD4 was 
confirmed as the central gene influencing TNBC progression. Immunohistochemical 
results showed strong TEAD4 expression in TNBC tissues, with negligible 
expression in adjacent normal tissues or other breast cancer subtypes. Drug 
prediction and molecular docking identified irinotecan as a potential 
TEAD4-targeting agent. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stable 
binding and favorable dynamics of the irinotecan-TEAD4 complex. Both TEAD4 
knockdown and irinotecan treatment significantly suppressed TNBC cell migration 
and invasion. The combination of TEAD4 knockout and irinotecan produced a more 
pronounced inhibitory effect, underscoring the therapeutic potential of 
targeting TEAD4 in TNBC.
CONCLUSIONS: Through comprehensive analysis, we identified TEAD4 as a key gene 
in TNBC with high expression specificity. Irinotecan may be a potential targeted 
drug for TEAD4, offering a new therapeutic strategy for TNBC and potentially 
improving patient outcomes. Further experimental verification is required.

BACKGROUND: Descriptive data on gastric cancer (GC) from African countries are 
limited. We describe the prevalence, clinicopathological features, short-term 
outcomes and factors associated with gastric cancer at Muhimbili National 
Hospital (MNH), which is a tertiary-level facility in Tanzania.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled consenting patients aged ≥ 18 years 
who underwent diagnostic upper endoscopy at MNH from September 2023 to February 
2024. The participants were followed up for 90 days to determine whether they 
died or developed gastrointestinal bleeding or gastric outlet obstruction. 
Sociodemographic and clinicopathological data were collected through a 
questionnaire and analysed via SPSS software. The prevalence of gastric cancer 
and short-term outcomes are expressed as proportions. Logistic regression 
analysis was used to test the significance of the associations between predictor 
variables and gastric cancer. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: A total of 870 patients were included, 459 (52.8%) of whom were male. 
The mean (± SD) age of the participants was 53.3 (± 17.4) years. GC was observed 
in 77 (8.9%) patients, with a male to female ratio of 0.83:1 and a mean age of 
59.4 (± 10.6) years. The symptoms associated with GC were upper abdominal pain 
in 71(92.2%), weight loss 39(50.6%), abdominal fullness 24(31.2%), and vomiting 
23(29.9%). H. pylori antibody testing was positive in 63 (81.8%) GC patients. 
The antrum was the most common location for GC in 51 (66.2%) patients, with 
ulcerative morphology in 47 (61.0%) patients. Histologically, 72 patients 
(96.1%) had adenocarcinomas. H. pylori infection (aOR 4.711; 2.493-8.902; 
P < 0.001), and cigarette smoking (aOR 2.477; 1.453-4.221; P = 0.001) were 
independently associated with GC. The 90-day mortality rate was 45.5% (35/77). 
Within the 90-day follow-up period, 88.3% (68/77) of the patients received 
palliative care, and 9.1% (7/77) were eligible for curative treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of gastric cancer among patients undergoing upper 
gastrointestinal endoscopy at Muhimbili National Hospital is high. Most patients 
have advanced disease at presentation, and the 90-day mortality rate is high. 
Cigarette smoking and H. pylori infection were independently associated with GC 
in this population.

BACKGROUND: Asbestos is a well-established occupational carcinogen, with strong 
evidence linking its exposure to lung cancer. Despite increasing awareness of 
its health risks, asbestos continues to be used in many countries. We aimed to 
evaluate the global burden of lung cancer attributable to occupational asbestos 
exposure and to analyze its epidemiological patterns across time and by regions, 
sex, and age.
METHODS: We utilized lung cancer data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
2021 database, including information on new cases, deaths, and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), along with their age-standardized rates 
by gender and age groups. Temporal trends were examined using Joinpoint 
regression models with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The timeline data on 
global asbestos bans were retrieved from the International Ban Asbestos 
Secretariat.
RESULTS: We observed, approximately 25 years after the complete ban on asbestos 
use, a declining trend for lung cancer incidence, as well as for mortality and 
DALYs due to asbestos exposure. In 2021, occupational asbestos exposure 
accounted for 9.4% of global lung cancer deaths and 7.2% of DALYs. Between 1990 
and 2021, the number of asbestos-related lung cancer deaths increased from 0.13 
million to 0.19 million, while DALYs rose from 2.58 million to 3.34 million. The 
highest deaths and DALYs were observed in regions with high Socio-demographic 
Index (SDI), though the most rapid increases occurred in lower SDI regions. Over 
time, lung cancer burden shifted towards older populations, especially those 
aged over 70.
CONCLUSIONS: We found, for the first time, that a complete ban on asbestos with 
a lag time of 25 years could effectively reduce lung cancer incidence along with 
asbestos-related deaths and DALYs. These findings underscore the urgent need for 
a complete ban on asbestos (especially chrysotile).

BACKGROUND: The management of positive lateral margins (pLMs) after endoscopic 
submucosal dissection (ESD) to treat early gastric cancer (EGC) remains 
controversial. We implemented a sequential therapeutic protocol for post-ESD pLM 
management; this protocol involved progressing from argon plasma coagulation 
(APC) and hot biopsy forceps-mediated avulsion to the hybrid endoscopic mucosal 
resection-hot avulsion (EMR-HA) technique. This study compared the outcomes of 
EMR-HA with those of thermal ablation (hot avulsion/APC) in the management of 
residual tumors measuring ≤ 1 cm with pLMs after gastric ESD, and both 
recurrence prevention and therapeutic efficacy were assessed.
METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study (2015-2023) of 1,601 ESD procedures, 92 
cases of pLMs with residual tumors that had maximum diameters ≤ 1 cm were 
analyzed. The therapeutic modalities were stratified as follows: hot avulsion 
(n = 25), APC (n = 41), and EMR-HA (n = 26). Statistical analyses were performed 
with one-way ANOVA, chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests, as well as 
Kaplan‒Meier analysis.
RESULTS: EMR-HA resulted in a lower recurrence rate of 11.5% (3/26; median 
follow-up of 63 months, IQR 41-66), showing superior efficacy to both hot 
avulsion (44% recurrence, 11/25; P = 0.013) and APC (36.6% recurrence, 15/41; 
P = 0.046). The thermal ablation cohort exhibited significantly shorter median 
recurrence intervals (hot avulsion: 20 months; APC: 18 months) than the negative 
lateral margin cohort (32 months; P < 0.05). Among the 42 patients who 
experienced recurrence, complete resection was achieved via re-ESD in 84.6% of 
patients (22/26), with a median disease-free survival time of 34.5 months (IQR 
19.2-56).
CONCLUSIONS: EMR-HA demonstrates clinically superior recurrence control compared 
to thermal ablation techniques, with extended therapeutic durability and reduced 
reintervention rates. The findings suggest its potential clinical utility as an 
endoscopic treatment option. Additionally, re-ESD provides reliable salvage for 
recurrent lesions.

INTRODUCTION: Globally, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and 
the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. This study describes the 
clinical and epidemiological profile of patients with colorectal cancer 
diagnosed at the Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital, the only 
hospital with onco-surgery services in Bhutan.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study based on the review of records of 
patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 2018 and 2024 at the National 
Referral Hospital, Thimphu.
RESULTS: There were 182 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancers in the 
six-year period. The highest proportions were observed in the Trashigang (28, 
15.4%), Pema Gatshel (15, 8.2%), Mongar (14, 7.7%), Samtse (14, 7.7%) and 
Sarpang (14, 7.7%) districts. The mean age at diagnosis was 61.5 ± 15.6 years; 
almost half were males (95, 52.2%) and 82 (45.1%) were ≥ 65 years. The common 
presenting symptoms were abdominal pain (48, 26.4%), altered bowel habits (35, 
19.2%), and per rectal bleeding (33, 18.1%). The predominant location of the 
tumour was in the middle/lower rectum (43, 23.6%) and the right colon (40, 
22.0%). The majority of the patients were diagnosed with Stage III (59, 32.4%) 
and Stage IV (16, 8.8%) diseases. The dominant histology pattern was 
adenocarcinoma (38, 20.9%). The common form of treatment offered was surgery 
with chemotherapy (74, 40.7%).
CONCLUSION: Higher proportion of colorectal cancers were reported among older 
adults and with Stage III or IV disease. This study reports the baseline 
description of patients with colorectal cancer in Bhutan.

BACKGROUND: High grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common and lethal 
subtype of ovarian cancer, yet its prognosis has remained unchanged in the past 
3 decades. HGSC is known to have evolved immune evasion strategies to promote 
survival, but these mechanisms are not well understood. Podocalyxin (PODXL), a 
CD34-related sialomucin, is often expressed in HGSC patients with poor 
prognosis. We have recently reported that PODXL promotes the formation of 
compact and chemoresistant HGSC spheroids to boost their survival.
METHODS: In this current study, we investigated whether PODXL may also influence 
HGSC spheroid susceptibility to NK cell infiltration and cytotoxicity. We 
co-cultured HGSC spheroids with primary human NK cells isolated from peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and examined the impact on these spheroids 
following 24, 48 and 72 h of co-culture. We first used a cell line model of HGSC 
spheroids employing Kuramochi cells, which express the highest level of PODXL 
among known HGSC cell lines. To study the impact of PODXL levels, we compared 
spheroids of control and PODXL knockout (PODXL-KO) cells that we have previously 
engineered. We then validated the data in primary cancer spheroids derived from 
ascites of HGSC patients that express high and low levels of PODXL.
RESULTS: In both the cell line and primary HGSC spheroid models, co-culture of 
spheroids expressing lower levels of PODXL resulted in more NK cell infiltration 
and cytotoxicity, while spheroids expressing higher levels of PODXL were 
resistant to destruction and showed more proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data suggest that PODXL may play an important 
role in aiding immune evasion in HGSC, at least partly by conferring resistance 
to NK cell infiltration and the related cytotoxicity.

BACKGROUND: Voxel-based analysis (VBA) is an analytic approach to evaluate 
correlations between local dose and the development of different toxicities. 
DVHs are used for toxicity prediction as well. Compared with DVH, no contours 
are required for VBA technique, and results tell specific voxels that may be 
related to the toxicity instead of the whole contoured area. The VBA has been 
used on different cancer sites and for different toxicities. Most of these 
studies included patients treated with photon; all published studies were based 
on planned dose, and VBA tools used were developed in-house. In our study, 
patient cohort was treated with proton, our VBA tool was developed based on 
RayStation, and doses fed to the VBA tool were delivered doses with constant and 
two variable RBE models.
PURPOSE: To develop a VBA tool with RayStation scripting to evaluate 
correlations between spatial dosimetry and acute dysphagia in oropharyngeal 
cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy.
METHODS: Forty-two oropharyngeal cancer patients treated with 
intensity-modulated proton therapy were included. All patients received 
bilateral neck irradiation and had no prior HN surgery or radiation. 
Clinician-graded acute dysphagia was recorded using CTCAE v5.0. Each patient's 
dose was estimated as a weighted sum of doses based on the planning CT and 
subsequent quality assurance CTs acquired during treatment for dosimetric effect 
evaluation related to anatomic changes. A constant and two-variable RBE model 
provided estimations of biological doses. Each cumulative dose was mapped into a 
synthetic CT (common coordinate system) that represents this patient cohort. The 
cohort was split into toxicity and non-toxicity groups according to their 
toxicity grade. Permutation tests with maximum statistic strategy were performed 
on mapped doses to find locations with significant dose differences between the 
two groups. A loosened p-value threshold (0.1) was selected for sensitive 
cluster identification to conservatively include more area in identified 
clusters. The non-dosimetric variables (age and sex) on toxicity were studied 
with the Mann-Whitney U test.
RESULTS: No sensitive cluster was detected with acute dysphagia grade ≥ 3 
grouping criterion. For grade ≥ 2, one or two clusters, depending on RBE models 
(one within the oral cavity and the other at the anterior-inferior part of the 
larynx), were identified. For non-dosimetric variables, only a marginal 
correlation (p = 0.07) between age and acute dysphagia was detected with 
grade ≥ 2.
CONCLUSION: In the patient cohort evaluated in this study, our VBA tool 
highlighted oral cavity and larynx subregions that may be related to the acute 
dysphagia development during definitive radiation for oropharyngeal cancer. 
Optimization of treatment plans to reduce dose to these areas may allow for a 
reduction in acute dysphagia in future patients.

PURPOSE: The Breast Cancer Study Group of the Italian Association of 
Radiotherapy and Clinical Oncology (AIRO) conducted a survey aiming to provide 
an overview of the policies on radiation therapy (RT) dose and fractionation for 
whole breast irradiation (WBI), partial breast irradiation (PBI), chest wall 
(CW) irradiation and regional nodal irradiation (RNI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In February 2023, 183 Italian RT centres were invited to 
answer a survey: after a first section investigating general aspects, the 
questionnaire focused on radiation oncologists' (ROs) attitude regarding breast 
cancer post-operative RT dose and fractionation. Surveyed ROs were also asked to 
express their interest in being involved in prospective trials evaluating 
post-operative ultra-hypofractionated RT (ultra-HF).
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty/183 (65.6%) centres answered the survey. 
Regarding WBI 99.1% of ROs prescribed moderate hypofractionated (HF) RT and 
70.3% ultra-HF RT, sequential administration is the preferred choice for 
delivering tumour bed boost (60.4% of centres). Moderate HF was the preferred 
choice for CW irradiation and RNI in 60.3% and 63.6% of centres, respectively. 
PBI was adopted in clinical practice in only 57.5% of centres. Furthermore, 
29.1% of centres are already involved and 34.6% would like to be involved in 
prospective studies evaluating ultra-HF RT.
CONCLUSION: Hypofractionated RT is widely adopted for WBI, while its use in 
post-mastectomy RT (PMRT) appears uneven. Adoption of ultra-HF RT is high for 
WBI, but it is not a standard for CW irradiation and RNI. Regarding PBI, the 
survey highlighted the need for enhanced expertise to improve its adoption.

Distinguishing follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) from follicular adenoma (FTA) 
preoperatively remains a significant challenge in thyroid nodule management. 
This study aims to develop and validate a novel, interpretable deep learning 
model that explicitly leverages the critical diagnostic feature-tumor margins-to 
address this issue. A total of 577 patients, 435 females and 142 males (mean 
age, 51.05 ± 8.31), were collected from two different centers. A total of 4358 
thyroid US images were prospectively collected, with 3140 images from one center 
randomly divided into the training set and the validation set with a ratio of 
4:1 for training the deep learning (DL) model, while 1218 images from the other 
center were viewed as a test dataset for the evaluation. We propose an 
end-to-end graph convolutional network that constructs a graph representation 
from ultrasound image patches, explicitly modeling the structural relationships 
between features, particularly at the tumor boundary. The model is optimized 
using a maximum code rate reduction (MCR2) loss to enhance feature 
discrimination. The overall prediction accuracy and AUC of the independent test 
set and validation dataset were 90.13%, 82.10%, 92.35%, and 87.36%, 
respectively, achieving significant and consistent improvement compared to other 
deep learning baselines. Our proposed model could diagnose FTC with good 
performance. By successfully incorporating domain knowledge and validating on 
multicenter data, this study represents a significant step toward reliable 
AI-assisted diagnosis of thyroid cancer.

Recent advancements in deep learning have substantially improved medical imaging 
analysis. However, medical diagnosis often requires the integration of data from 
multiple modalities, and existing deep learning approaches frequently lack 
interpretability in multimodal contexts. These limitations lead to challenges in 
trust and reliability when making critical medical decisions. Current methods 
often rely on post-hoc explanations, which provide limited and sometimes 
unreliable insights. To address these challenges, we propose ProtoMM, a 
prototype-based multimodal model for medical data analysis that emphasizes 
interpretability. ProtoMM utilizes self-explanatory prototypes and transparent 
inference processes, providing reliable case explanations. By employing 
multimodal fusion, the model enhances inter-modal interactions, learning 
representative cases through prototype layers. We introduce two prototype layer 
levels: an aggregate layer that treats multimodal data as a unified prototype 
case and a singleton layer that distinguishes between individual modalities. We 
demonstrate the efficacy of ProtoMM in survival prediction tasks, where it 
achieves a Concordance Index (C-Index) of 0.793 ± 0.027. This result is 
comparable to state-of-the-art black-box models, yet our model provides fully 
interpretable insights into its decision-making process.

BACKGROUND: For stage IVB gastric cancer, recently, systemic cancer therapy 
(including cytotoxic chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and molecular 
targeted agents) is the standard treatment based on biomarker testing. If these 
treatments are successful and the tumor becomes resectable, conversion surgery 
may be considered, though its significance remains unclear. In cases showing 
clinical complete response (cCR), the necessity of surgery is further debated.
METHODS: This retrospective single-center study included patients with cStage 
IVB gastric cancer who received chemotherapy or systemic cancer therapy, 
regardless of undergoing conversion surgery, between 2013 and 2023. Patients 
were stratified by objective tumor response on imaging (cCR or others). Those 
achieving cCR were further divided into two groups: non-OP (follow-up without 
surgery) and OP (underwent conversion surgery) for survival comparison.
RESULTS: Among 1591 patients treated with systemic chemotherapy, 51 (3.2%) 
achieved cCR (33 non-OP; 18 OP). In the cCR cohort, the median follow-up was 57 
months. The 3-year overall survival (OS) was 97% in the non-OP group and 86% in 
the OP group (P = 0.44), respectively. Among the entire population, conversion 
surgery was performed in 121 patients (7.6%), in whom pathological CR (pCR) was 
seen in 17 (14%). This included 10 patients with cCR and seven without cCR. 
Three-year OS of pCR patients was 93%.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested the potential for long-term survival without 
surgery in patients showing cCR. However, further investigation is needed 
regarding accurate methods to assess tumor disappearance.

OBJECTIVES: In this study, we developed a multi-modal CT-based machine learning 
model to predict the response of gastric cancer (GC) patients to first-line 
chemotherapy combined with PD-1 inhibitors and performed external validation and 
multi-model comparisons.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 348 
patients with GC who underwent immunotherapy. The patients were categorized into 
an internal validation cohort (center A, n = 272) and an external validation 
cohort (center B, n = 76). Pre-treatment clinical and CT radiomics features were 
extracted to develop three models: a clinical model, a radiomics model and a 
clinical-radiomics model. The classifiers included logistic regression (LR), 
linear support vector classification (Linear SVC), support vector machine, and 
random forest.
RESULTS: A total of 19 radiomics signatures and 5 clinical feature signatures 
were selected. In the radiomics model, the Linear SVC algorithm achieved an area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.88 and 0.76 in 
internal and external validation sets, respectively. In both the clinical model 
and the clinical-radiomics model, the LR algorithm demonstrated high and stable 
predictive performance in the internal (AUC = 0.89 and 0.94) and external 
validation datasets (AUC = 0.76 and 0.85). Among all models in the external 
validation dataset, the clinical-radiomics model utilizing LR outperformed all 
other classifiers.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical-radiomics model, in combination with the LR algorithm, 
provides a reliable and effective method for predicting the early response of 
advanced GC patients treated with programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors 
combined with chemotherapy.
CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: CT radiomics and laboratory parameters were used 
to evaluate early prediction of response to PD-1 inhibitors combined with 
chemotherapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer. This clinical-radiomics 
model provides a novel approach to predict immunotherapy efficacy and prognosis.
KEY POINTS: Evaluating the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors combined with 
chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer using only clinical data is limited. 
Only some patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with the PD-1 inhibitors 
combined with chemotherapy achieved complete regression. This clinical-radiomics 
model showed good performance for predicting gastric cancer response to 
chemotherapy combined with PD-1 inhibitors.

PURPOSE: Psychosexual development disruption and sexual dysfunction are widely 
recognized as profoundly distressing long-term side effects of childhood cancer. 
However, the specific sexual challenges faced by young adult childhood cancer 
survivors (CCS) remain poorly understood. This study used qualitative methods to 
characterize the impacts of cancer on CCS' sexuality and explore the 
simultaneous reports of both sexual dysfunctions and overall sexual 
satisfaction.
METHOD: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 41 Spanish 
childhood cancer survivors with a history of a solid tumour diagnosis (ages 
19-28, M = 21.9, SD = 1.79). Reflexive Thematic Analysis identified key themes 
related to cancer's impact on their sexuality.
RESULTS: The interviews revealed three key themes characterizing cancer's impact 
on CCS' sexuality: negative (physical and psychological), positive 
(psychological), and no impact. A fourth theme described an apparent 
inconsistency in participants' testimonies, as they often asserted that cancer 
had no impact while also acknowledging that it had, in fact, influenced their 
sexuality.
CONCLUSION: Several interconnected factors likely explained why CCS appeared 
unaware of cancer's impact on their sexuality. These included the developmental 
age at the time of diagnosis, a tendency to not relate sexual experiences to 
their cancer history, a shift in priorities towards survival, a reluctance to 
explore sexuality due to distressing negative impacts, and a potential need to 
protect their self-image. Importantly, cancer often positively reshaped their 
concept of sexuality, emphasizing emotional intimacy and mature relationships. 
This contributed to high levels of sexual satisfaction that CCS deemed more 
significant than any negative impact.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Follow-up care should consistently address 
sexuality, even without patient-reported difficulties, be individualized, 
multidisciplinary, and encompass both physical and psycho-affective dimensions.

PURPOSE: To investigate the extent and practice of home-based treatment for 
patients with hematologic malignancies in Denmark.
METHODS: This nationwide exploratory study was conducted at all Danish 
hematologic departments (n = 9). Each site received an online questionnaire for 
the collection of data on the type of therapy administered as home-based 
treatment, the specific treatments with details on target populations, patient 
criteria, implementation status, and practice for clinical management.
RESULTS: Six types of therapy were offered as home-based treatments across the 
Danish hematologic departments: chemotherapy, immunoglobulin, immunotherapy, 
hydration therapy, antibiotics, and parenteral nutrition. In total, 17 
treatments were offered, with the majority being provided to patients with 
multiple myeloma. Immunoglobulin and antibiotics were most often provided at 
home. Variations were identified regarding patient criteria for receiving 
home-based treatment, including personal resources and social networks, use of 
intravenous accesses and infusion pumps, and timing of initiation of home-based 
treatment.
CONCLUSION: There is variation in the implementation of home-based treatment for 
patients with hematologic malignancies in Denmark, including different criteria 
and practices. To fully realize the benefits of home-based treatment, it is 
imperative to address access disparities, standardize practices, and enhance 
support for patients and caregivers. Continued research, collaboration, and 
policy development are essential to ensure that all patients have equitable 
access to high-quality home-based treatment options.

Membrane mimicking protein nanodiscs are nanoscale structures composed of a 
lipid bilayer and a scaffold protein that forms a circular disc-like structure. 
These NDs are designed to mimic the natural cell membrane and are used as a 
platform to study membrane-associated proteins, such as those involved in signal 
transduction or drug transport. In cancer therapeutics, NDs have been developed 
as a promising nano-formulation for delivering macromolecules, such as drugs or 
nucleic acids, to cancer cells. The NDs can be functionalized with targeting 
ligands, such as antibodies or peptides, to specifically bind to cancer cells 
and deliver therapeutic payloads. One advantage of ND-based formulations is 
their ability to protect macromolecules from degradation and enhance their 
pharmacokinetics and bioavailability. Additionally, the use of NDs as a delivery 
vehicle allows for the precise control of drug release, which can improve 
efficacy while reducing toxic side effects. Overall, membrane mimicking protein 
NDs show great potential as a versatile platform for macromolecular delivery in 
cancer therapeutics, with the ability to precisely target cancer cells and 
enhance the therapeutic effect of drugs or nucleic acids. In this review, we 
discuss the structural components, stability issues, synthetic strategies, 
limitations, therapeutic advancements, and future challenges associated with the 
clinical implication of ND's anti-cancer therapies.

ultrasensitive determination of CYFRA21-1 as a lung cancer biomarker. The 
sensing mechanism of the CL aptasensor is  based on the incorporation of luminol 
into a cobalt-based metal-organic framework (MOF), also called ZIF-67, to 
generate a composite of the luminol@ZIF-67. This composite was then 
functionalized with a CYFRA21-1 specific aptamer (luminol@ZIF-67-apt) as signal 
probe. ssDNA was immobilized on PVP/NiO nanocomposite, allowing hybridization 
with the aptamer by complementary base pairing. In the presence of CYFRA 21-1, 
the luminol@ZIF-67-apt/PVP/NiO-ssDNA ternary complex could be assembled and 
induced intense chemiluminescence emission. Under the optimized conditions, the 
sensor showed a broad linear detection range  from 10⁻5 to 104 ng/mL, with a 
detection limit (LOD) of 3.7 × 10⁻5 ng/mL. Reproducibility (RSD = 3.81%) and 
long-term stability were observed, with signals retained to 98.22% and 97.87% 
over 20 and 33 days, respectively. Recovery experiments in spiked human serum 
samples ranged from 96.00% to 99.30%, and RSDs from 3.41% to 4.07%, indicating 
good stability and potential in complex biological matrices. Such a strategy 
holds great promise for ultrasensitive detection of CYFRA 21-1 for clinical 
bioanalysis.

BACKGROUND: Sexual dysfunction (SD) is a recognized complication of rectal 
cancer surgery, even minimally invasive surgery (MIS), and can significantly 
impact postoperative quality of life. This study aimed to identify risk factors 
for SD and develop a predictive nomogram in a multicenter prospective setting.
METHODS: This sub-analysis of the LANDMARC study initially enrolled 399 male 
patients who underwent laparoscopic (Lap) or robotic (Ro) rectal cancer surgery 
at 49 Japanese institutions between December 2019 and October 2022. After 
excluding patients who underwent transanal total mesorectal excision, total 
pelvic exenteration, prostate or seminal vesicle resection, surgical conversion, 
preoperative SD, or incomplete SD assessment, 300 patients were included in the 
final analysis. SD was defined as the presence of either erectile dysfunction or 
ejaculation dysfunction at 12 months postoperatively based on patient-reported 
questionnaires.
RESULTS: SD was observed in 129 (43.0%) patients. Multivariate analysis 
identified advanced age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.041; p = 0.01) and the Lap approach 
(compared with Ro surgery; OR: 1.795; p = 0.02) as independent risk factors for 
SD. A nomogram was constructed using variables selected by Least Absolute 
Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression. The model demonstrated modest 
discriminative ability (area under the curve: 0.672) with reasonable calibration 
in the intermediate-risk group.
CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age and Lap surgery were associated with an increased risk 
of postoperative SD after MIS for rectal cancer. Therefore, Ro surgery may offer 
protective advantages. Although the predictive accuracy of the nomogram was 
limited, it may aid preoperative counseling and raise awareness of postoperative 
sexual outcomes.

Bladder cancer is a highly prevalent disease in the Western World, and the 
treatment paradigm is actively evolving. For decades, the most commonly used 
standard of care for localized muscle-invasive disease has been neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy followed by open radical cystectomy with urinary diversion. 
Considering the high postoperative morbidity of this procedure, efforts have 
focused on improving patient outcomes. Over the past decade, substantial 
advances have been introduced in imaging, prehabilitation, perioperative care, 
robotic surgery and organ-sparing techniques. Bladder preservation after 
complete clinical response to neoadjuvant treatment or after trimodal treatment 
is increasingly being implemented. In addition, novel biomarkers are 
increasingly being used to monitor treatment response and select patients for 
adequate therapy. Last, innovative approaches, such as intraoperative imaging, 
sentinel lymph-node biopsy or the use of artificial intelligence, are currently 
under investigation.

Bladder cancer exhibits marked spatial heterogeneity in gene expression and 
immune infiltration. In this exploratory pilot study, we integrate multiplex 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH) with AI-assisted digital pathology to 
characterize the spatial distribution of a previously validated three-gene 
arsenic-responsive risk model (NKIRAS2, AKTIP, HLA-DQA1). Initially identified 
in arsenic-exposed individuals and associated with bladder cancer risk, this 
gene panel achieved 94% training and 75% validation AUC in prior genomic models 
(PMC8760535). We analyzed five bladder tumor specimens using whole-slide mFISH 
imaging and HoverNet-based nuclear segmentation to quantify gene expression at 
single-cell resolution. Spatial profiling revealed elevated expression scores in 
tumor-adjacent regions, with a strong positive correlation to tumor grade 
(Pearson's r = 0.83). These gene-enriched regions exhibited spatial clustering 
of tumor cells. Additionally, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density was 
inversely correlated with tumor grade, suggesting immune exclusion in high-grade 
tumors. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of combining spatial 
transcriptomics with AI-driven histopathological analysis for biomarker 
validation. This integrative framework provides a foundation for future 
population-scale studies leveraging spatial omics to evaluate arsenic-associated 
gene signatures and assess their relevance in bladder cancer risk stratification 
and disease progression.

Recent studies have demonstrated that for various diseases, incorporating 
polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for other traits and diseases into the PRS-based 
risk prediction model may improve predictive performance - known as Multiple 
Polygenic Score (MPS) approach. We aimed to examine whether the MPS approach 
improves colorectal cancer (CRC) risk prediction. We included 2,187 non-CRC PRSs 
from the polygenic Score (PGS) Catalog and used machine learning (ML) models to 
select the most predictive non-CRC PRSs, utilizing individual-level data from 
31,257 CRC cases and 33,408 controls. An independent dataset from the Genetic 
Epidemiology Research in Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort (4,852 cases and 
67,939 controls) was randomly split into subsets for model estimation and 
validation. The model combined MPS with two existing CRC-PRSs based on known 
loci and genome-wide genotyping. We then assessed model performance by 
calculating the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) in the validation 
set and performed 1,000 bootstrapped iterations to evaluate AUC improvements. 
The ML model selected 337 non-CRC PRSs predictive of CRC risk. Adding MPS to the 
CRC-PRSs significantly improved AUC by 0.017 (95% CI: 0.011-0.022, p < 0.0001) 
when combined with known-loci CRC-PRS, 0.005 (95% CI: 0.002-0.007, p = 0.0005) 
with genome-wide CRC-PRS, and 0.004 (95% CI: 0.002-0.006, p = 0.0005) with both 
the known loci and genome-wide CRC-PRSs. These findings demonstrate MPS's 
potential to refine CRC risk prediction models and highlight opportunities for 
further advancements in risk prediction.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is characterized by aggressive progression, 
chemoresistance, and immune evasion, largely driven by its hypoxic tumor 
microenvironment (TME). The extensive desmoplastic reaction in PC, characterized 
by dense stromal fibrosis, exacerbates hypoxia by impairing blood flow, creating 
a hostile environment that limits therapeutic efficacy. Hypoxia-induced 
microRNAs (HypoxamiRs) have emerged as critical regulators of these processes, 
modulating cellular pathways that promote tumor survival and therapy resistance. 
HypoxamiRs exert their effects by interacting with hypoxia-inducible factors, 
including HIF-1α and HIF-2α. Beyond their direct impact on tumor cells, 
HypoxamiRs modulate the behavior of immune and stromal cells within the hypoxic 
TME. Key contributors to hypoxia, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts, 
pancreatic stellate cells, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells, 
facilitate HypoxamiR transfer via exosomes. This review explores the 
multifaceted roles of HypoxamiRs in key processes such as immune modulation, 
chemoresistance, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), autophagy, 
angiogenesis, and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer. We also highlight the complex 
interplay between HypoxamiRs and other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in regulating 
hypoxia-driven pathways. Investigating these complex interactions provides 
critical insights for developing novel therapeutic strategies to overcome 
chemoresistance and immune evasion in pancreatic cancer.

In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth 
factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), the emergence of 
acquired resistance remains a significant challenge. Elucidating the underlying 
mechanisms of resistance is crucial for developing novel strategies to overcome 
or delay therapeutic escape. To this end, this study aimed to identify key 
drivers of EGFR-TKIs resistance and explore actionable targets for intervention. 
We investigated resistance mechanisms by integrating CRISPR/Cas9-based 
genome-wide screening with tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomic analysis, and 
virtually screened bioactive small molecule libraries to identify compounds 
capable of restoring EGFR-TKIs sensitivity. The multi-omics approach revealed 
that CCT2 is a critical mediator of resistance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs in 
lung cancer, with higher expression of CCT2 observed in resistant cells compared 
to sensitive cells. Mechanistically, CCT2 recruits tripartite motif-containing 
protein 28 (TRIM28) to catalyze SUMO2 modification of thioredoxin-related 
transmembrane protein 1 (TMX1), inhibiting its ubiquitination and enhancing 
protein stability. This post-translational modification (PTM) promotes 
TMX1-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) clearance, thereby conferring 
resistance. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition with the compound HY-10127, 
identified through virtual screening, effectively restored EGFR-TKIs sensitivity 
in resistant cell lines and delayed the development of resistance in xenograft 
models. The findings establish the CCT2/TRIM28/TMX1/ROS axis as a novel 
resistance mechanism in EGFR-mutated lung cancer, and targeting this pathway 
with HY-10127 represents a promising strategy to overcome resistance to 
third-generation EGFR-TKIs, providing preclinical rationale for clinical 
translation. These discoveries advance our understanding of molecular resistance 
mechanisms and offer potential therapeutic targets for improving lung cancer 
prognosis.

Emerging evidence suggests that lineage-specifying transcription factors control 
the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We have discovered a 
transcription factor switching mechanism involving the poorly characterized 
orphan nuclear receptor HNF4G and the putative pioneer factor FOXA1, which 
drives PDAC progression. Using our unbiased protein interactome discovery 
approach, we identified HNF4A and HNF4G as reproducible, FOXA1-associated 
proteins, in both preclinical models and Whipple surgical samples. In the 
primary tumor context, we consistently find that the dominant transcription 
factor is HNF4G, where it functions as the driver. A molecular switch occurs in 
advanced disease, whereby HNF4G expression or activity decreases, unmasking 
FOXA1's transcriptional potential. Derepressed FOXA1 drives late-stage disease 
by orchestrating metastasis-specific enhancer-promoter loops to regulate the 
expression of metastatic genes. Overall survival is influenced by HNF4G and 
FOXA1 activity in primary tumor growth and in metastasis, respectively. We 
suggest that the existence of stage-dependent transcription factor activity, 
triggered by molecular compartmentalization, mediates the progression of PDAC.

Bladder cancer is the second most common malignancy of the urogenital system, 
with non-muscle-invasive forms being the most prevalent. While therapy with 
intravesical instillation of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is widely used, it 
shows variable efficacy and notable side effects, which prompts the need for new 
treatments. This study introduces a nanoscale biotherapy against bladder cancer 
using bacterial extracellular vesicles (bEVs) from Escherichia coli. In an 
orthotopic syngeneic rat model of bladder cancer with luciferase-tagged tumour 
cells, intravesical bEVs treatment significantly inhibited tumour growth 
compared to the gold standard therapy: BCG. Indeed, compared to BCG, bEVs 
treatment led to superior tumour regression, with 60% of treated animals showing 
complete tumour clearance versus 20% in the BCG-treated group. Moreover, we 
observed strong local immune activation, namely T cell infiltration and mucosal 
lymphoid aggregates, which negatively correlated with tumour size, suggesting 
that bEVs efficacy is due, at least in part, to their ability to induce a strong 
antitumor immune response. Notably, bEVs caused no mortality or systemic 
toxicity. Altogether, the present study constitutes a striking illustration of 
translational medicine, where the properties of a bacterial compound can be 
harnessed for patient benefit.

Lymphoma histopathological diagnosis is complex due to rare subtypes, 
morphological overlaps, and poor tumor differentiation. In this paper, an 
AI-based system using deep transfer learning and simulated federated learning is 
developed to classify two lymphoma types i.e. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) 
and Follicular Lymphoma (FL) from a dataset of 4500 histopathological images. 
Six models (VGG-16, VGG-19, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, DenseNet161, and Inception 
V3) were evaluated across four data thresholds (0.05 to 0.2). These models used 
fine-tuned convolutional layers to automatically extract high-level image 
features relevant to tissue morphology; the extracted features were processed 
internally through each model's classifier, forming an end-to-end classification 
pipeline. DenseNet161 achieved the best classification performance across 
thresholds, while Inception V3 showed the highest accuracy (97.5%) and lowest 
RMSE (0.393) in the testing phase using deep learning. A simulated federated 
learning setup was also explored, where Inception V3 again outperformed other 
models, indicating its robustness in decentralized learning scenarios. The 
reported evaluation metrics loss, accuracy, precision, RMSE, F1 score, and 
recall, are derived from the testing phase, ensuring an accurate assessment of 
generalization performance. The findings highlight the efficacy of deep transfer 
learning in early and accurate lymphoma detection, with Inception V3 and 
DenseNet161 demonstrating strong performance across both learning paradigms. 
However, since federated learning was not fully deployed in a real-world 
distributed environment, its broader applicability remains a subject for future 
exploration.

Overcoming resistance to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors is an 
urgent challenge for ovarian cancer treatment. Here, we investigated RECQL1, a 
RecQ helicase involved in homologous recombination repair, as a potential target 
for overcoming PARP inhibitor resistance in this disease. Patients with 
platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer treated with the PARP inhibitor 
olaparib between March 2018 and December 2021 were included. 
Immunohistochemistry assays were conducted to assess RECQL1 protein expression 
patterns in surgically resected ovarian cancer tissues. The effect of RECQL1 
knockdown on olaparib resistance was evaluated in vitro using ovarian cancer 
cells transfected with an anti-RECQL1 siRNA. Among 44 patients, those with no 
response to olaparib had significantly higher RECQL1 expression levels compared 
with responders (P = 0.020). Kaplan-Meier curves showed significantly shorter 
overall survival in the high RECQL1 expression group than in the low expression 
group (median, 26.0 months vs. not reached; P = 0.027). Multivariate analysis 
revealed high RECQL1 expression to be a significant prognostic factor for 
shorter overall survival (P = 0.036). RECQL1 knockdown significantly enhanced 
the sensitivity to olaparib in two ovarian cancer cell lines. Overall, RECQL1 
plays a critical role in PARP inhibitor resistance and is a promising 
therapeutic target to improve ovarian cancer patient outcomes.

Approximately half of high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs) demonstrate 
homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) with characteristic genomic 
rearrangements. However, the impact of HRD on centromeres and transposable 
elements remains largely unexplored in HGSOC since conventional short-read 
sequencing is unable to interrogate these repetitive regions. We employed Oxford 
Nanopore long-read sequencing (LRS) to investigate genomic and epigenetic 
alterations in these regions. Pre-treatment archival cryopreserved tumor and 
matched blood samples were obtained for six patients with HGSOC. 
High-molecular-weight DNA was sequenced using Oxford Nanopore R10.4 flow cells 
and aligned to both the GRCh38 and the telomere-to-telomere T2T-CHM13 reference 
genome. Pathogenic gene mutations, allele-specific copy number variations, 
structural variants, and CpG methylation were analyzed. All six tumors had 
pathogenic TP53 mutations. Two carried germline BRCA1 mutations, while three 
showed CCNE1 amplifications. HRD scores and mutational signatures associated 
with HRD were elevated in the BRCA1-mutated tumors. Centromeric regions were 
significantly hypomethylated in tumors and their methylation profiles distinctly 
separated HRD tumors from non-HRD tumors. LINE1 and ERV transposable elements 
showed marked hypomethylation in tumors without germline BRCA1 mutations. 
Chromosome arm-specific telomere lengths were significantly shortened in tumors. 
Allele-specific hypermethylation in the TERT hypermethylated oncological region 
was detected in three tumors. LRS uncovered HRD-related genomic and epigenomic 
alterations in previously inaccessible repetitive regions of HGSOC, including 
centromeric and transposable element hypomethylation. These findings highlight 
the potential of such abnormalities as novel biomarkers for HGSOC and warrant 
further application of the methods to larger cohorts in future studies.

Glycolysis is crucial for maintaining cancer stemness. This study demonstrated 
the role of the glycolytic enzyme alpha-enolase (ENO1) in glycolysis and 
stemness in gastric cancer (GC). High ENO1 expression was associated with poor 
prognosis and promoted malignant phenotypes and stem-like characteristics in 
patients with GC. Mechanistically, ENO1 directly stimulates lactate and ATP 
production by regulating glycolysis, affecting lactate homeostasis and 
intracellular ATP pools, and coregulating the AMPK/mTOR and PI3K/AKT signaling 
pathways. This ultimately drives GC stemness, epithelial‒mesenchymal transition 
(EMT)-related marker expression, self-renewal, migration, and invasion. Notably, 
the increase in the intracellular ATP pool can directly activate the PI3K/AKT 
pathway in a concentration-dependent manner, thereby further stimulating 
glycolysis to form a positive feedback loop. The functional role of lactate 
depends on the simultaneous presence of glycolysis-derived ATP to 
synergistically activate the PI3K/AKT pathway. Lactate homeostasis can also 
promote tumor stemness by increasing overall plactylation levels. Furthermore, 
pharmacological studies revealed that metformin combined with copanlisib 
significantly inhibited tumors by blocking the energy metabolism pathways 
PI3K/AKT and AMPK/mTOR. Our findings are the first to reveal the multifaceted 
role of ENO1 in mediating intracellular signaling and metabolic regulation to 
enhance stemness in GC. By establishing cell models with varying metabolite 
concentrations, we identified differential regulation of the PI3K/AKT and 
AMPK/mTOR pathways through lactate homeostasis and intracellular ATP pools, 
further confirming the metabolic crosstalk mechanism. Rationally, targeting 
multiple nodes along the ENO1-ATP/lactate-AMPK/PI3K/AKT-mTOR axis may be 
effective for GC treatment, as indicated by the significant suppression of tumor 
growth by metformin (which inhibits ATP production) plus syrosingopine (which 
disrupts lactate homeostasis). In conclusion, the complex interplay between 
metabolism and tumor stemness offers novel therapeutic directions and potential 
treatment strategies for GC.

Cancer diagnosis at an early stage is crucial for improving overall health 
outcomes. However, existing cancer diagnostic techniques are mostly invasive and 
tend to identify the disease only in its advanced stages. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), 
which are small non-coding RNAs involved in gene expression regulation, are 
stable in serum as circulating miRNAs and have potential as non-invasive 
biomarkers. However, their application in pan-cancer diagnostics and 
therapeutics is still largely unexplored. We developed Serum-MiR-CanPred, a deep 
learning framework using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on serum miRNA 
expression data from 20,271 samples across 12 cancer types and healthy controls 
from GEO databases. The model achieves robust pan-cancer classification 
(AUC = 96.87%, accuracy = 96%) with a consensus set of 88 miRNAs. Validation 
using external datasets demonstrated its generalizability and clinical 
potential. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) identified hsa-miR-5100 as a key 
biomarker, dysregulated in cancers including lung, bladder, and gastric 
carcinomas. Pathway analysis linked these miRNAs to cancer-related processes 
like VEGFA-VEGFR2 signalling. Molecular docking of pre-mir-5100 with rDock, 
identified AC1MMYR2 as a potential high-affinity ligand, with binding stability 
confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS In conclusion, 
Serum-MiR-CanPred integrates explainable AI with molecular modelling, advancing 
miRNA-based diagnostics and drug discovery for precision oncology.

The PRIMARY score was implemented in Prostate Cancer Molecular Imaging 
Standardized Evaluation (PROMISE) version 2 to improve accuracy for the 
diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer using prostate-specific 
membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET). We reviewed overall 
survival (OS) for patients who underwent PSMA PET for initial staging to 
evaluate the prognostic value of PRIMARY in a large, international, multicenter 
cohort. The cohort comprised 1889 patients who underwent PSMA PET for initial 
staging of prostate cancer at investigator sites across Europe and Australia 
between 2012 and 2021. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) 
were calculated for PRIMARY scores to identify predictors of OS. Complete-case 
head-to-head comparisons were conducted for Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data 
System (PI-RADS) versus PRIMARY scores, and cT stage versus PRIMARY scores. We 
present preliminary findings up to January 31, 2025, when 231 deaths had 
occurred. PRIMARY score 5 (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.3; p = 0.045) was associated 
with shorter OS. Improvements in C index values confirmed the added prognostic 
value of the PRIMARY score when combined with PI-RADS or cT stage. PRIMARY score 
5 on initial PSMA PET is prognostic for shorter OS. There is ongoing long-term 
follow-up in the PROMISE registry (NCT06320223, promise-pet.org).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted 
radioligand [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 is an approved treatment for metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, identification of genomic 
biomarkers associated with treatment efficacy remains a critical unmet need.
METHODS: We used a customized 78-gene panel to analyse circulating tumour DNA 
(ctDNA) from 150 patients with mCRPC included in a prospective 
[177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 registry.
KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Undetectable ctDNA was a significant and positive 
prognostic biomarker at both baseline (before treatment) and at week 6 (before 
cycle 2 of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617). Quantification of the baseline ctDNA fraction 
enhanced prognostic stratification irrespective of high or low PSMA expression 
on position emission tomography imaging. Undetectable ctDNA at week 6 was linked 
to a superior treatment benefit independent of prostate-specific antigen 
response. FOLH1 alterations were identified as a potential novel therapeutic 
resistance mechanism.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our data highlight the potential utility 
of ctDNA in optimising patient selection, improving therapeutic monitoring, and 
dissecting genomic mechanisms of resistance to [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617, and further 
prospective validation is warranted.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have clinical benefits in 
patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer, particularly those with 
deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) status. However, real-world data on the 
efficacy of the combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in Asian 
populations remain scant.
METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study enrolled 98 Asian patients with 
stage III to IVB or recurrent endometrial cancer treated at National Taiwan 
University Hospital between January 2022 and February 2025. The patients 
received either carboplatin-paclitaxel alone or in combination with 
pembrolizumab. The pimary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS). The secondary outcomes included adverse events (AEs). 
Subgroup analyses based on mismatch repair status and pembrolizumab dose (100 mg 
vs. 200 mg) were conducted.
RESULTS: The rates of disease progression (12.5 % vs. 28.8 %) and mortality 
(3.1 % vs. 12.1 %) were lower in the pembrolizumab group than in the 
chemotherapy alone group. Multivariate analysis revealed a trend toward improved 
PFS for pembrolizumab treatment (hazard ratio [HR] 0.36; p = 0.08) and a 
significant interaction with mismatch repair status (HR 0.13; p = 0.05). 
AEs-including rash, myalgia, and autoimmune thyroid disease-occurred more 
frequently in the pembrolizumab group. No significant differences in efficacy or 
AEs were found between the two pembrolizumab dosing groups.
CONCLUSION: Pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy may provide clinical 
benefits, particularly in patients with dMMR status, as the first-line treatment 
for endometrial cancer. Lower dosing may also be feasible in Asian populations, 
although further validation is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Bowel obstruction is considered a poor prognostic factor in colon 
cancer. Therefore, these patients are generally treated with adjuvant 
chemotherapy following resection of the primary tumour. However, the benefit of 
adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II obstructive colon cancer, and the impact of 
bridge-to-surgery strategies are insufficiently known.
METHODS: This was a nationwide cohort study of patients who underwent resection 
of left-sided obstructive colon cancer (LSOCC) with curative intent in 75 
hospitals between 2009 and 2016. Potential predictors for receiving adjuvant 
chemotherapy were included in a multivariable model. The impact of adjuvant 
chemotherapy on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), corrected 
for age, ASA-score, and 30-day postoperative complications, was determined using 
Cox regression analyses, with pTN stratification.
RESULTS: Of 2151 included patients, 39.7% received adjuvant chemotherapy. 
Independent predictors of receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were age, ASA score, 
pT and pN1-2 categories, and Clavien-Dindo grade III-IV postoperative 
complications, but not a bridge-to-surgery strategy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was 
independently associated with better DFS (HR: 0.61; 95% CI, 0.51-0.72) and OS 
(HR: 0.49; 95% CI, 0.40-0.61) in the overall population. In pT3N0 LSOCC, 
adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with DFS or OS. In patients with pT4N0 
LSOCC however, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved DFS (HR: 0.53, 
95% CI, 0.29-0.95) and OS (HR: 0.42, 95% CI, 0.20-0.86). No differences in DFS 
or OS were observed between patients who received single-agent versus doublet 
chemotherapy were found.
CONCLUSION: A bridge-to-surgery strategy did not influence adjuvant chemotherapy 
receipt in patients with LSOCC. Obstruction is considered a risk factor in stage 
II, but no survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy is seen for the pT3N0 
subgroup.

The aim of the study was to analyze the interinstitutional differences in the 
planning process/approach of regional nodal irradiation (RNI) in breast cancer 
patients in expert centres. Based on a predefined risk constellation, the left 
breast and the axillary, periclavicular and internal mammarian lymph node areas 
had to be irradiated. The study focused on left-sided RNI. One CT dataset (free 
breathing) each of a regular (R) adipose (A) and a slender patient (S) were 
centrally selected and all target volumes (CTV: level II, III, IV + internal 
mammary artery chain region-IMC, left breast, PTV and OARs) were contoured 
according to the ESTRO recommendations. A total dose of 50.4/1.8 Gy was set as 
the dosage with free choice of technique/inclinic constraints. Dose files were 
analyzed centrally as DICOM files (CTV: D95%, D50%, D1% and V95%; OAR: D1%, 
Dmean, V20Gy, V30Gy, V40Gy and the absolute V95% of normal tissue outside the 
PTV). A total of 18 data sets were analyzed. Differences of almost 10 Gy in TV 
coverage were significant (p < 0.05). This was evident between patients e.g., 
for CTV_IMC D95%/D50% S:47.1Gy ± 1.9/50.1Gy ± 0.6; R:39.4Gy ± 8.4/47.6Gy ± 4; 
A:38.3Gy ± 10.4/47.9Gy ± 4.4) and PTV_IMA D95%/D50% (S:37.6Gy ± 3.9/49.7Gy ± 
0.8; R:27.9Gy ± 7.8/46.9Gy ± 3.3; A:25.6Gy ± 9.7/47.5Gy ± 2.8). Patient-related 
dose differences were also significant for OAR`s: Dmean heart (S:4.6Gy ± 1.1; 
N:6.1Gy ± 1.2; A:7.9Gy ± 2.1), humeral head (S:8.3Gy ± 2.7; N:3.8Gy ± 0.7; 
A:6.4Gy ± 1.7), and thyroid (S:17.7Gy ± 2.7; N:14.3Gy ± 1.6; A:27.9Gy ± 4.5). 
Patient anatomical factors and institutional planning differences create 
significant dosimetric variations in breast cancer radiation therapy, 
emphasizing the need for personalized planning approaches that incorporate 
patient-specific constraints and age-dependent risk considerations.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) remains the most common type of cancer and the 
leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women despite the widespread screening 
programs and personalized treatment options. Current age-based screening 
programs are suboptimal missing high-risk young women. The ""Be RIGHT with breast 
cancer risk management"" (BRIGHT) study evaluated a genetic risk-based 
personalized BC screening service model in real-world healthcare settings, 
focusing on younger women excluded from standard screening.
METHODS: The BRIGHT study included 800 healthy Estonian women aged 35 to 49 
using telemedicine and home-based testing. Participants underwent polygenic risk 
score (PRS) testing and based on the questionnaire those meeting the monogenic 
pathogenic variant (MPV) testing criteria were referred to clinical geneticists. 
All women received personalized genetic risk-based clinical recommendations, and 
if needed, referral to BC screening. Participants' and healthcare professionals' 
feedback was collected.
RESULTS: 330 (41.3%) women with elevated polygenic risk received recommendations 
to start screening earlier than the current standard. 124 (15.5%) women were 
advised to begin BC screening immediately, among whom one was diagnosed with 
stage 0 cancer and one with a precancerous lesion. Of the 90 participants 
completing MPV testing, four (4.4%) were MPV-positive. Feedback indicated high 
satisfaction with the digital approach and a clear understanding of results and 
recommendations.
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of a 
personalized genetic risk-based BC screening model. It has the potential to 
enhance BC screening programs, particularly for younger women and those at 
higher genetic risk, while avoiding unnecessary interventions for low-risk 
individuals.

INTRODUCTION: The potential anxiety invoked by diagnostic imaging procedures 
intensifies in cancer diagnoses, with the term 'scanxiety' originating from the 
additional fear associated with cancer imaging. This emphasises the importance 
of a person-centred approach to care. This scoping review mapped the literature 
regarding imaging-related anxiety, 'scanxiety', and person-centred care.
METHODS: Databases used were Cinahl Plus; Proquest; PubMed; Scopus; Web of 
Science; PsycINFO, and Cochrane. Broad search terms were utilised to maximise 
results, with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Limiters were English 
language articles within the previous 10 years. Further to systematic filtering 
and critical appraisal, 60 studies were included.
RESULTS: Findings were organised in four themes: 'Quantification and causes of 
anxiety'; 'The nature of imaging procedures'; 'Perceptions of 
Person-centredness'; and 'Service and staffing factors'. MRI and PET/CT cause 
the highest procedural stress. Fear of results causes greater, and more 
sustained, anxiety in cancer patients than other groups, creating complex 
emotional needs. The physiological effects of anxiety can adversely affect image 
quality and ability to complete scans. Human interaction is central to managing 
anxiety, but service pressures and staff emotional labour influence care 
delivery. Most existing person-centred care research in imaging relates to 
generic populations, with limited focus on how diagnostic radiography staff can 
support people with cancer.
CONCLUSION: Although the psychosocial needs of those undergoing cancer imaging 
are greater than in other diagnoses, more research is needed into the benefits 
of a person-centred approach and the support and education needs of staff 
working in this field.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Understanding experiences of cancer imaging, from 
both patient and staff perspectives, including any facilitators and barriers to 
care, would support development of a model for person-centred care in this 
specialist area.

BACKGROUND: T3 gallbladder cancer includes diverse invasive tumors. However, 
distinct prognostic outcomes may be observed among T3 gallbladder cancer 
confined to a localized range despite sharing the same classification.
METHODS: We analyzed patients with T3 gallbladder cancer who underwent surgery 
from 2002 to 2021. They were divided into 4 groups on the basis of the invasion 
site: liver, serosa, extrahepatic bile duct, and adjacent organs. We compared 
their clinicopathologic, perioperative, and prognostic data.
RESULTS: We identified 216 patients with T3 gallbladder cancer. The median 
survival times for patients with tumors invading only the serosa (n = 54), liver 
(n = 94), bile duct (n = 50), and adjacent organs (n = 18) were 25.8, 26.6, 
18.7, and 12.4 months, respectively. Patients with liver and serosa invasion 
showed comparable oncologic outcomes (P = .44), similar to those with bile duct 
and adjacent organ invasion (P = .41). The combined liver/serosa invasion group 
had better median survival than the bile duct/organ invasion group (26.6 months 
vs 17.3 months, P < .001). Combined bile duct/organ invasion was associated with 
more frequent nodal metastasis (71.2% vs 53.8%, P < .001), a greater proportion 
of N2 (33.3% vs 8.5%, P < .001), and more frequent R1 resection (21.9% vs 4.8%, 
P < .001). In addition, bile duct/organ invasion was an independent prognostic 
factor for poorer survival (hazard ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 
1.13-2.67, P = .008), as was nodal metastasis (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.08-2.24, P = .018).
CONCLUSIONS: Gallbladder cancers confined to the liver and serosa exhibited a 
more favorable prognosis, highlighting needed subclassification within T3 
gallbladder cancer.

Advances in minimally invasive surgical techniques and precision oncology 
paradigms have significantly optimized the management of colorectal cancer 
(CRC). The advent of endoscopic superminimally invasive surgery (ESMIS) has led 
to comprehensive evaluations of its proteomic impact in patients with CRC. This 
prospective study utilized Olink plasma proteomic profiling to delineate 
ESMIS-versus laparoscopic surgery (LS)-associated molecular variations in CRC 
cohorts, with validation via immunofluorescence (IF), immunohistochemistry 
(IHC), and Western blotting (WB) methodologies. The results demonstrated that 
ESMIS significantly attenuated the surgical invasiveness. Calcitonin (CALCA) and 
platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGFC) emerged as potential biomarkers for 
invasive damage assessment, while amnionless (AMN), low-density lipoprotein 
receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), 
receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase eta (PTPRJ), and 
fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase TIGAR were identified as novel diagnostic indicators 
for CRC. IF, IHC, and WB analyses corroborated Olink findings, confirming 
significantly decreased AMN, LRP1, FOXO1, and PTPRJ expression in malignant 
cells and tissues. Future investigations of minimally invasive CRC therapies 
should prioritize cellular proliferation, metabolic reprogramming, stress 
response, and apoptosis. Collectively, these findings establish a molecular 
foundation for precision surgery and provide novel insights into the CRC 
pathophysiology and iatrogenic organ damage mechanisms.

Esophageal cancer, ranking 18th in incidence and 14th in mortality in the United 
States, has a low 5-year survival rate of around 20%. The 2 main histologic 
subtypes are esophageal adenocarcinoma, prevalent in Western countries and 
linked to obesity and gastroesophageal reflux disease, and esophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma, more common worldwide and associated with lifestyle risk factors 
like tobacco and alcohol. Accurate staging using endoscopic ultrasound, computed 
tomography, and PET scans guides treatment decisions, with multimodal approaches 
including surgery, chemoradiotherapy, and systemic therapies. Ongoing research 
into molecular targets and immunotherapies promises further improvements in 
management and survival for esophageal cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; ERBB2) is 
overexpressed or amplified in 15-20% of gastric cancers (HER2+ GC). Within 
individual HER2+ GCs, HER2/ERBB2 expression is often variable. Although HER2 
therapeutic targeting improves outcomes for HER2+ GC patients, acquired 
resistance is frequent.
OBJECTIVE: To spatially interrogate HER2+ GC interpatient and intrapatient 
heterogeneity and resistance mechanisms associated with HER2-targeting agents 
(trastuzumab, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd)).
DESIGN: Spatial transcriptomic analysis (GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler) was 
applied to >1500 regions of interest in 30 GCs-these contained 15 HER2+ GCs 
treated with trastuzumab and T-DXd subsequently. Analysis of patient-matched 
samples with acquired trastuzumab or T-DXd resistance revealed escape 
mechanisms. Results were validated by immunohistochemistry, independent cohorts 
and patient-derived xenografts and organoids.
RESULTS: HER2+ tumours exhibited PD-L1 expression within the spatial tumour 
microenvironment. We observed increased expression of CLDN18.2, a promising 
therapeutic target, in trastuzumab-resistant tumours. One-third of HER2+ GC 
patients developed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) on trastuzumab 
resistance, associated with PD-L1 and CCL2 upregulation. Another third of 
trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ GC patients activated the endoplasmic 
reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway including genes such as GOLM1. 
HLA loss and increases in oxidative phosphorylation pathways were observed in 
T-DXd-resistant GCs.
CONCLUSION: Our results delineate multiple acquired resistance mechanisms to 
trastuzumab and T-DXd in HER2+ GC in vivo. This information may guide trials 
combining trastuzumab or T-DXd with new agents to enhance the efficacy and 
durability of HER2 blockade.

Key Laboratory of Otorhinolaryngology (Shandong University), Jinan 250012, 
China.

Objective: To develop a deep learning model based on 3D super-resolution 
reconstruction technology and to analyze its feasibility and effectiveness in 
predicting paraglottic space invasion in hypopharyngeal cancer. Methods: A 
retrospective study was conducted involving 382 patients with hypopharyngeal 
squamous cell carcinoma treated at Qilu Hospital of Shandong University between 
January 2014 and December 2020. The cohort included 364 males and 18 females, 
with a mean age of 62±7 years. Patients were divided into a training set (n=300) 
and a test set (n=82) based on enrollment time. A generative adversarial network 
was used to perform 3D super-resolution reconstruction on contrast-enhanced CT 
images, improving spatial resolution by 16 times. A 2.5D deep learning strategy 
was employed to construct Resnet-NR and Resnet-SR models based on conventional 
and super-resolution images, respectively, to predict whether the paraglottic 
space was invaded. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC). A multi-reader 
multi-case study was conducted to assess the impact of the artificial 
intelligence (AI) model on clinicians' diagnostic capabilities. Results: The 
super-resolution model Resnet-SR achieved the highest accuracy in both the 
training set (AUC=0.87, 95%CI: 0.84-0.90) and the test set (AUC=0.88, 95%CI: 
0.81-0.96), significantly outperforming traditional clinical indicators (T 
stage, N stage, tumor diameter, and pathological differentiation degree) (AUC 
range: 0.55-0.70, all P<0.05). In comparison, the conventional-resolution model 
Resnet-NR achieved AUCs of 0.81 (95%CI: 0.77-0.84, P=0.005) and 0.80 (95%CI: 
0.71-0.89, P=0.184) in the training and test sets, respectively. Using Resnet-SR 
to assist clinical decision-making improved the diagnostic accuracy of junior 
physicians (AUC=0.793 without AI assistance vs. AUC=0.871 with AI assistance, 
P=0.012) and significantly reduced diagnosis time for clinicians of all 
experience levels (86.5 s without AI assistance vs. 82.5 s with AI assistance, 
t=2.01, P=0.032). Conclusion: This study successfully develops a deep learning 
model based on 3D super-resolution reconstruction technology, which can assist 
in preoperative prediction of paraglottic space invasion in hypopharyngeal 
cancer. The AI-assisted tool improves diagnostic accuracy for junior physicians 
and enhances diagnostic efficiency for clinicians across all experience levels.

Publisher: 目的： 构建一种基于3D超分辨率重建技术的深度学习模型，并分析其用于预测下咽癌声门旁间隙受侵的可行性和有效性。 方法： 
回顾性收集2014年1月至2020年12月山东大学齐鲁医院收治的382例下咽鳞状细胞癌患者，其中男性364例，女性18例，年龄（62±7）岁，按照入组时间划分为训练集（n=300）和测试集（n=82）。采用生成对抗网络对下咽癌增强CT图像进行3D超分辨率重建，将空间分辨率提高了16倍。进一步采用2.5D深度学习策略，分别基于常规图像和超分图像构建Resnet-NR和Resnet-SR模型，预测肿瘤声门旁间隙是否受侵。采用受试者工作特征（ROC）曲线以及曲线下面积（AUC）等对模型性能进行评价。最后，采用多读者多病例研究评价人工智能（AI）模型对临床医师的辅助诊断能力。 
结果： 
超分辨率模型Resnet-SR在训练集（AUC=0.87，95%CI：0.84~0.90）和测试集（AUC=0.88，95%CI：0.81~0.96）中具有最高的准确性，显著优于传统临床指标（T分期、N分期、肿瘤直径和病理分化程度）（AUC为0.55~0.70，P值均<0.05）。作为对比，常规分辨率模型Resnet-NR在训练集和测试集的AUC分别为0.81（95%CI：0.77~0.84，P=0.005）和0.80（95%CI：0.71~0.89，P=0.184）。利用Resnet-SR辅助临床决策，可提高低年资医师诊断的准确度（AI辅助前AUC=0.793，AI辅助后AUC=0.871，P=0.012），并显著提高各年资医生的诊断速度（AI辅助前86.5 
s，AI辅助后82.5 s，t=2.01，P=0.032）。 结论： 
本研究成功构建一种基于3D超分辨率重建技术的深度学习模型，可用于协助术前判断下咽癌声门旁间隙是否受侵犯。利用该AI辅助工具可改善低年资医生的诊断准确率，提高各年资医生的诊断速度。.

Objective: To compare the survival outcomes of different subsequent treatment 
regimens in patients with locally advanced hypopharyngeal squamous cell 
carcinoma (HPSCC) who achieved partial response (PR) after neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy based on the gross tumor volume regression rate (GTVRR). Methods: 
This retrospective study included patients with locally advanced HPSCC treated 
at the Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Beijing Tongren Hospital, from 
January 2011 to December 2023. The cohort included 135 males and 3 females, aged 
from 35 to 77 years. All patients received 2-3 cycles of TPF regimen 
(paclitaxel+cisplatin+5-fluorouracil) neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Subsequent 
treatments included concurrent chemoradiotherapy or surgery combined with 
postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy. The impacts of different subsequent 
treatment modalities on the survivals and prognoses of patients were compared 
based on GTVRR thresholds of 50% and 70%. The χ2 test was used to analyze 
influencing factors; survival analysis and intergroup comparisons were performed 
using the Kaplan-Meier method and Log-rank test; prognostic factors were 
assessed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Results: The 
5-year OS and PFS rates were 56.5% and 47.9%, respectively, while, the 10-year 
OS and PFS rates were 25.8% and 21.2%, respectively. The median OS was 75 
months, and the median PFS was 48 months. The laryngeal function preservation 
rate for the entire cohort was 83.3%. The patients who underwent surgery 
combined with postoperative radiotherapy had significantly better OS and PFS 
outcomes than those treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (P<0.05). 
Stratification based on GTVRR revealed that the surgery plus postoperative 
radiotherapy regimen was particularly effective for PR patients with a GTVRR of 
30%-70%, showing significantly better OS and PFS compared to the concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy group (P<0.05). Conclusion: The optimal subsequent treatment 
for PR-HPSCC may be surgery-based comprehensive treatment, particularly for 
patients with a GTVRR of 30%-70%. This study offers valuable insights for the 
stratified treatment of HPSCC, which could contribute to improving overall 
patient prognosis.

Publisher: 目的： 根据大体肿瘤体积退缩率（GTVRR）比较新辅助化疗达到部分缓解（PR）的局部中晚期下咽癌患者不同后续治疗方案对生存预后的影响。 
方法： 
回顾性分析2011年1月至2023年12月于首都医科大学附属北京同仁医院头颈外科就诊，行新辅助化疗后PR的138例中晚期下咽癌患者，男性135例，女性3例，年龄35~77岁。患者均接受2~3周期TPF方案（紫杉醇+顺铂+5氟尿嘧啶）新辅助化疗，后续行同步放化疗，或者手术联合术后辅助放疗。根据GTVRR阈值50%和70%，比较不同后续治疗方案对患者生存预后的影响。采用χ2检验分析影响因素，Kaplan-Meier法及Log-rank检验进行生存分析和组间比较，Cox单因素及多因素分析评估预后因素。 
结果： 
入组患者5年总生存（OS）率和无进展生存（PFS）率分别为56.5%和47.9%，10年OS率和PFS率分别为25.8%和21.2%，中位OS为75个月，中位PFS为48个月。全组患者的喉功能保留率达到83.3%（115/138）。Cox多因素分析结果显示保喉手术、年龄、T分期和淋巴结转移是影响患者预后的关键因素，淋巴结转移对PFS有显著不利影响，而保喉手术则有助于改善患者的OS和PFS（P值均<0.05）。在后续治疗方案比较中，手术联合术后放疗组的OS和PFS均优于同步放化疗组（P值均<0.05）。根据GTVRR分层分析，手术联合术后放疗的治疗方案尤其适用于GTVRR达到30%~70%的PR患者，其OS和PFS优于同步放化疗组（P值均<0.05）。 
结论： 新辅助化疗疗效达PR的下咽癌患者，最佳后续治疗方案可能是以手术为主的综合治疗，尤其适用于GTVRR为30%~70%者。.

Objective: To assess the impact of induction chemotherapy sensitivity on the 
prognosis and larynx preservation rates in patients with locally advanced 
hypopharyngeal cancer and to identify risk factors influencing induction 
chemotherapy sensitivity. Methods: This study included patients with locally 
advanced (stage III-IV) hypopharyngeal cancer who received induction 
chemotherapy as initial treatment at the Eye & ENT Hospital of Fudan University 
between August 2017 and September 2022. Based on the Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, enrolled patients were classified into 
the sensitive group and the resistant group according to their response to 
induction chemotherapy. Chi-square tests and Log-rank tests were used to compare 
the objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), progression-free 
survival (PFS), and laryngeal preservation rate (LPR) between groups. Propensity 
score matching (PSM) was employed to accurately evaluate the impact of induction 
chemotherapy sensitivity on prognosis in real-world settings. Univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk 
factors for induction chemotherapy resistance in locally advanced hypopharyngeal 
cancer. Results: A total of 197 patients with locally advanced hypopharyngeal 
cancer who received induction chemotherapy as initial treatment were included 
in, comprising 195 males and 2 females, with ages ranging from 36 to 74 years. 
Among them, 155 patients (78.68%) were classified into the sensitive group and 
42 patients (21.32%) into the resistant group. The overall response rate (ORR) 
of induction chemotherapy in this cohort was 78.68%, with a five-year OS rate of 
63.7%. The sensitive group had significantly better OS (mOS 6.32 vs. 5.05 year), 
PFS (mPFS 5.71 vs. 3.09 year) and a significantly higher LPR (91.6% vs. 69.0%) 
(P<0.05). After propensity score matching, all covariates were balanced between 
the two groups, and the sensitive group showed significant improvement in OS 
(P<0.05), while, no significant difference was observed in PFS and LPR between 
the two groups. Logistic regression analysis revealed that risk factors for 
induction chemotherapy failure in locally advanced hypopharyngeal cancer 
included: smoking status (OR [95%CI]=4.751 [1.887-11.961]), tumor location in 
the posterior pharyngeal wall (OR [95%CI]=2.988 [1.264-7.063]), and cN2-3 stage 
(OR [95%CI]=3.641 [1.109-11.954]) (P<0.05). Conclusions: Induction chemotherapy 
sensitivity significantly affects the prognosis of locally advanced 
hypopharyngeal cancer, which is influenced by various risk factors, including 
smoking status, tumor sublocation, and clinical N stage.

Publisher: 目的： 评估诱导化疗敏感性对局晚期下咽癌的预后及保喉率的影响，同时分析影响诱导化疗敏感性的风险因素。 方法： 
以2017年8月至2022年9月在复旦大学附属眼耳鼻喉科医院选择诱导化疗作为初始治疗的局晚期（Ⅲ-Ⅳ期）下咽癌患者为研究对象。根据实体瘤疗效评价标准（RECIST）1.1将入组患者分为诱导化疗敏感组和耐药组，比较客观缓解率（ORR）、总体生存期（OS）、无进展生存期（PFS）及保喉率。利用倾向性评分匹配分析以评估诱导化疗敏感性在真实世界中对局晚期下咽癌的预后影响。采用单因素和多因素Logistic回归分析筛选并鉴定局晚期下咽癌诱导化疗耐药的危险因素。 
结果： 
共纳入197例选择诱导化疗作为初始治疗的局晚期下咽癌患者，男性195例，女性2例，年龄36~74岁，其中敏感组155例（78.68%），耐药组42例（21.32%）。本队列中诱导化疗的ORR为78.68%，5年OS率为63.7%。敏感组患者OS（中位OS：6.32年比5.05年）、PFS（中位PFS：5.71年比3.09年）和保喉率（91.6%比69.0%）显著优于耐药组（P值均<0.05）。倾向性得分匹配后，所有协变量在2组之间得到平衡，敏感组在OS上表现出显著的改善（P<0.05），而2组间PFS和保喉率差异无统计学意义（P值均>0.05）。多因素分析显示，未戒烟［OR（95%CI）为4.751（1.887~11.961）］、肿瘤位于喉咽后壁［OR（95%CI）为2.988（1.264~7.063）］以及cN2-3期［OR（95%CI）为3.641（1.109~11.954）］是局晚期下咽癌诱导化疗失败的危险因素（P值均<0.05）。 
结论： 本研究发现诱导化疗敏感性显著影响局晚期下咽癌预后，且敏感性受多种危险因素影响，包括吸烟状态、肿瘤亚区和临床N分期。.

Objective: To evaluate preoperative high-resolution thin-layer cervical enhanced 
CT used to predict the venous route of the submental flap reflux vein and its 
relationship with adjacent structures in order to guide the anatomical 
understanding and protection of submental flap in pharyngeal cancer surgery. 
Methods: Sixty consecutive patients with pharyngeal cancer who underwent 
submental flap repair surgery in our department from March 2022 to December 
2024, as well as 60 patients who were accepted neck dissection suffering other 
cancers, were selected. Before surgery, high-resolution cervical enhanced CT 
scans were performed, and the position of the transverse section of the facial 
vein in the venous phase horizontal image gradually variation tendency was 
focused layer by layer. The direction and adjacent relationship of the submental 
flap reflux veins were determined and recorded. Combined with 60 patients with 
other head and neck tumors who underwent neck dissection in our department 
during the same period (a total of 120 cases, 240 sides), the classification and 
management of the draining veins of Fang's mental flap were conducted. Type Ⅰ 
mainly drains into the internal jugular vein; Type Ⅱ mainly drains into the 
external jugular vein and Type Ⅲ mainly drains into the anterior jugular vein 
(often accompanied by an external jugular draining branch). The status and 
proportion of venous drainage were analyzed. Results: Vascular predictive 
coincidence rate was 98.3% (59/60) among the 60 patients with pharyngeal cancer. 
Only one patient was predicted to have a simple return to the external jugular 
vein. However, during the operation, in addition to the main return to the 
external jugular vein, a small portion also returned to the internal jugular 
vein. Submental flap reflux vessels were classified into three types based on 
intraoperative submental flap venous return in 60 cases of laryngopharyngeal 
cancer, in conjunction with the analysis of venous return patterns from 240 
cervical CT scans. Type Ⅰ mainly refluxed to the internal jugular vein, 
accounting for 42.1%. Type Ⅱ mainly refluxed to the external jugular vein 
(47.9%). Type Ⅲ mainly refluxed to the anterior jugular vein (10.0%). The total 
detection rate of CT reading of 240 venous reflux was 98.7% (237/240). Vascular 
predictive coincidence rate was 97.9%(235/240). Conclusion: The detailed 
analysis of submental venous return vessels can accurately predict the direction 
of reflux veins and its surrounding areas by preoperative high-resolution 
enhanced CT scan. This provides reliable guidance for the anatomy and protection 
of the submental flap reflux veins during surgery.

下咽癌是一种具有高度侵袭性、相对少见的头颈部恶性肿瘤，预后普遍较差，且多数确诊时已进展至局部晚期。传统外科手术虽有助于提升生存率，但往往以牺牲喉功能为代价，严重影响患者的生存质量。近年来，随着多学科诊疗模式的推广和个体化治疗理念的深化，下咽癌的治疗目标已从单纯追求生存率，逐渐转向在保证肿瘤根治不降低生存率的同时最大限度保留喉功能；根据患者的肿瘤分期、生物学特性和患者体质等，采用个体化的治疗方案，而不是一律手术或同步放化疗。本文针对下咽癌个体化治疗选择中的关键方法和问题进行述评，内容包括：早期病变中经口机器人手术的适用人群与局限性，局部晚期下咽癌手术与非手术治疗的策略选择与相关争议，诱导化疗、生物标志物及影像组学在筛选适合非手术治疗患者中的应用，诱导化疗后手术范围的个体化抉择，以及免疫治疗在局部晚期和复发/转移性下咽癌中的当前应用与挑战。本文强调，基于多学科讨论，整合肿瘤临床分期、分子生物学特征、患者意愿及功能保护需求，制订个体化治疗方案，是实现喉功能保留与生存质量提升的核心路径。未来仍需开展更多高质量前瞻性研究，建立精准疗效预测模型，以推动下咽癌诊疗向个体化与精准化方向迈进。.

Although tumor volume and new lesions (NLs) have been investigated previously as 
measures of response, the clinical impact of changes in tumor uptake on 
prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET remains largely unknown. Methods: 
This multicenter retrospective study investigated the clinical impact of changes 
in tumor uptake and volume on PSMA PET during [177Lu]Lu-PSMA in metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The primary outcomes were the 
associations of changes in SUVmax (ΔSUVmax) and SUVmean (ΔSUVmean), changes in 
total tumor volume (ΔTTV), and occurrence of NLs with prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) progression-free survival (PSA-PFS) and overall survival (OS). The study 
included patients with mCRPC who received [177Lu]Lu-PSMA between 2014 and 2019. 
PSMA PET/CT was performed at baseline and after 2 cycles of therapy. Whole-body 
analyses (SUVmax, SUVmean, TTV, and NLs) were performed and calculated using 
qPSMA software. Results: In total, 124 patients with mCRPC (median age, 73 y; 
interquartile range, 67-76 y) were included in the study. Whole-body ΔTTV and 
the occurrence of NLs were significantly associated with shorter PSA-PFS (hazard 
ratio [HR], 5.7; 95% CI, 3.59-9.06; and HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4-1.8; P < 0.0001) 
and with OS (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.61-3.43; and HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.4; P < 
0.001). Patient-based analysis showed that ΔSUVmax and ΔSUVmean were not 
associated with outcome (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99-1.00; P = 0.30; and HR, 0.90; 
95% CI, 0.99-1.00; P = 0.11). Region-based analysis found that only ΔSUVmax in 
visceral lesions was significantly associated with PSA-PFS (P = 0.007) but not 
with OS. Conclusion: Only ΔTTV and the occurrence of NLs provided significant 
prognostic value and should be considered when evaluating treatment response to 
[177Lu]Lu-PSMA therapy.

BACKGROUND/AIM: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a key driver in 
bladder cancer progression. This study investigated the tumor-suppressive role 
of miR-124-3p and its regulatory effect on EGFR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: TSGH8301 and T24 bladder cancer cells were treated with 
the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib or transfected with an miR-124-3p mimic. Cell 
viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion were assessed using MTT, 
colony formation, and transwell assays. EGFR targeting was confirmed via Western 
blot, immunofluorescence, and luciferase reporter assays.
RESULTS: Erlotinib and miR-124-3p both reduced cell viability and proliferation. 
miR-124-3p significantly inhibited EGFR phosphorylation and expression, 
suppressed migration and invasion, and downregulated the EGFR downstream targets 
MMP2, MMP9, and VEGF-A. Luciferase assays confirmed the direct binding of 
miR-124-3p to EGFR 3'UTR.
CONCLUSION: miR-124-3p suppresses bladder cancer cells progression by directly 
targeting and inactivating EGFR, thereby impairing cell proliferation, 
migration, and invasion. These findings highlight miR-124-3p as a potential 
therapeutic agent in EGFR-driven bladder cancer.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Cancer and its treatments often lead to patient malnutrition. 
The aim of the study was to identify the difficulties that cancer patients face 
in relation to their nutrition, to determine the importance of nutrition in 
their daily lives and to identify the reasons for their weight loss. In 
addition, the study aimed to capture the perspectives of the healthcare 
professionals and determine how the nutritional status of the individual 
patients plays a role in everyday clinical practice.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using an interview guide with open questions, structured 
interviews were conducted with ten patients who had suffered unintentional 
weight loss of more than 5% in the last three to six months, five nurses, and 
five doctors on an oncology ward in Bad Hersfeld hospital. Responses were 
analysed qualitatively using Mayring's content analysis method.
RESULTS: All patients reported diet-related symptoms. The main causes cited were 
side effects of treatment. All patients had questions about their nutrition. 
Healthcare professionals indicated that the patients considered the problem of 
malnutrition to be high, but that there was no uniform treatment concept or 
general screening. Perceptions of interdisciplinary communication were mixed. 
There was a lack of information regarding sources of information and counselling 
services among both professional groups.
CONCLUSION: Standardised interviews should be conducted as part of treatment to 
identify individual patient problems. As there has been no standardised approach 
to detection, prevention and treatment, an interdisciplinary reassessment and 
discussion of treatment issues is required to understand and address the complex 
problem of malnutrition.

BACKGROUND/AIM: The adverse side effects associated with chemotherapeutic agents 
have prompted the exploration of natural compounds as adjuvants to chemotherapy, 
offering more effective therapeutic alternatives. Licoricidin, a bioactive 
constituent of licorice, possesses diverse pharmacological properties. However, 
the antitumor mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of Licoricidin 
combined with paclitaxel in cervical cancer remain unclear and further 
investigations are warranted.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell growth and apoptosis were assessed using the MTT 
assay and Annexin V/PI staining. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was evaluated 
using the ER-ID assay. The expression of apoptosis- and ER stress-related 
proteins in response to the combined treatment was analyzed using western 
blotting.
RESULTS: Combined treatment with licoricidin and paclitaxel effectively 
inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in human HeLa and C-33A cells. We 
further revealed that this combined treatment increased the expression of 
apoptotic proteins (c-PARP, Bax, and DR5) while decreasing the expression of 
pro-caspase proteins (pro-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-9) in HeLa cells. In 
addition, the combined treatment induced ER stress, as evidenced by decreased 
expression levels of ERp44, ERp57, and ERp72, whereas the expression of GRP78 
was increased in HeLa cells.
CONCLUSION: The combination of licoricidin and paclitaxel induced ER 
stress-mediated apoptosis and may serve as a potential antitumor therapeutic 
strategy against human cervical cancer cells.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for most lung cancer 
cases and has high mortality, especially in advanced stages. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) 
and immunoregulatory genes such as suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) 
play critical roles in cancer progression and immune evasion. miR-30d-5p is 
known to act as a tumor suppressor by down-regulating oncogenic pathways, while 
SOCS3 modulates immune responses and tumor microenvironment interactions. This 
study aimed to evaluate the clinical relevance of circulating miR-30d-5p and 
serum SOCS3 protein levels in patients with NSCLC versus healthy controls and to 
assess their potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 35 patients with NSCLC 
and 26 healthy individuals. miR-30d-5p expression was measured using RT-qPCR, 
and SOCS3 protein levels were determined using ELISA. Statistical comparisons 
were performed, and diagnostic performance was evaluated using Receiver 
Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The correlation between SOCS3 and 
miR-30d-5p was assessed with Spearman's rank test.
RESULTS: SOCS3 levels were significantly elevated in patients with NSCLC 
(120.84±117.62 pg/ml) compared to controls (16.88±11.91 pg/ml, p<0.0001). 
Contrarily, miR-30d-5p expression was significantly decreased (fold change: 
0.24, p<0.002). A moderate negative correlation was observed between SOCS3 and 
miR-30d-5p levels (ρ=-0.439, p=0.025). ROC analysis displays good diagnostic 
accuracy for both SOCS3 [area under curve (AUC)=0.821] and miR-30d-5p 
(AUC=0.878). SOCS3 levels increased significantly with clinical stage.
CONCLUSION: Increased SOCS3 and decreased miR-30d-5p expression were observed in 
patients with NSCLC, indicating their involvement in tumor progression and 
immune disruption. The inverse correlation between these biomarkers suggests a 
regulatory interaction that may influence the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. These 
findings highlight the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of targeting the 
miR-30d-5p/SOCS3 axis in NSCLC.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome that adversely affects the 
prognosis of patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Although anamorelin has been 
shown to improve appetite and body weight, the optimal timing of its initiation 
remains unclear. This study evaluated the effects of the timing of anamorelin 
initiation on nutritional recovery and clinical outcomes in patients with 
gastrointestinal cancer cachexia.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 42 patients with gastric 
(n=17) or colorectal cancer (n=25) complicated by cachexia who received 100 mg 
of anamorelin once daily between August 2021 and December 2024. Changes in body 
weight, food intake, and nutritional status were assessed before and after 
anamorelin administration, and overall survival was analyzed according to the 
type of cancer.
RESULTS: Initially, patients had experienced a mean body weight loss of 
15.9±1.7% relative to the pre-diagnosis baseline. After four weeks, mean body 
weight increased by 2.9% (p<0.001), food intake improved significantly from 
30.5%±0.3% to 57.1%±0.5% (p<0.001), and the Patient-Generated Subjective Global 
Assessment short form (PG-SGA SF) score decreased from 12.3±0.4 to 10.3±0.9 
(p=0.003). The median overall survival was 17.9 months for gastric cancer and 
36.8 months for colorectal cancer, with no significant difference between the 
two groups (p=0.089).
CONCLUSION: Anamorelin improved body weight, food intake, and nutritional status 
in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer cachexia. However, the modest 
degree of recovery suggests that earlier administration, before substantial 
weight and muscle loss, may maximize therapeutic benefits, support treatment 
continuity, and potentially improve survival outcomes. Therefore, early 
intervention should be considered in the clinical management of cancer cachexia.

BACKGROUND/AIM: This study investigated the prognostic impact of human epidermal 
growth factor-2 receptor (HER2) status on the survival of patients with 
metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective study included 168 
patients diagnosed with recurrent or de novometastatic TNBC between April 2013 
and September 2024. Patients were categorized into two groups: HER2-negative 
(n=121, 72%) and HER2-low (n=47, 28%). Clinicopathological features and survival 
outcomes were compared between groups.
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 44 months [95% confidence interval 
(CI)=35.7-52.2]. All patients received systemic chemotherapy as part of their 
first-line treatment. The median progression-free survival (PFS) in all patients 
was 9 months (95%CI=7.7-10.3 months). The median overall survival (OS) in all 
patients was 22 months (95%CI=17.4-26.5 months). Higher Ki67 value at diagnosis 
was a significant poor prognostic factor for median OS (29 months vs. 15 months, 
p<0.001). HER2-negative patients had significantly worse median OS than HER2-low 
patients (19 months vs. 33 months, p=0.026). In multivariate analysis, the 
HER2-low group had significantly longer median OS than the HER2-negative group 
[hazard ratio=0.64 (95%CI=0.42-0.98), p=0.040].
CONCLUSION: HER2-low expression was associated with significantly improved 
survival compared with HER2-negative status in metastatic TNBC. These findings 
highlight HER2 status as a potential prognostic factor, particularly relevant in 
settings with limited access to novel therapies such as immunotherapy or 
antibody-drug conjugates.

BACKGROUND/AIM: This study aimed to assess the time advantages of delivering 
adjuvant hypofractionated radiotherapy (AH-RT) before third-generation adjuvant 
chemotherapy (A-CT), compared to the standard sequence (A-CT before AH-RT), in 
node-positive breast cancer (BC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 45 patients with node-positive BC treated with 
AH-RT before third-generation A-CT at our institution between 2022 and 2023 (EXP 
group) were retrospectively enrolled and matched with a control group of 45 
patients treated with standard sequencing (CTRL group). The primary endpoints 
were as follows: gain in time to RT initiation and overall treatment time, RT 
delay, RT interruptions, which were compared between the two groups. Propensity 
score matching was performed. Univariate and multivariate Cox-proportional 
hazards models were generated. Data from the multivariate analysis were 
confirmed by Pearson's covariance test, assuming p<0.001.
RESULTS: A significant reduction in the time to AH-RT initiation and overall 
adjuvant treatment time was recorded in the EXP group. In the EXP group, the 
mean duration of the entire adjuvant treatment was 35 (29-40) weeks after 
surgery vs. 42 (39-50) weeks for the CTRL group (p=0.032). Hematological G2-G3 
toxicity was responsible for RT delay (p=0.022) in the CTRL group. Multivariate 
analysis confirmed that acute skin toxicity was significantly associated with RT 
delay and interruption in the AH-RT15 CTRL arm (p=0.033) in the CTRL group. 
Pearson's covariance test confirmed these effects for the CTRL group (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Treatment with AH-RT before third-generation A-CT was found to be 
safe with a low acute toxicity profile in node-positive breast cancer, providing 
an advantage in shortening the time from surgery to AH-RT initiation as well as 
the overall adjuvant treatment time.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) due to metastatic breast cancer 
is common and debilitating. Effective, long-term treatment options have 
side-effects that reduce patients' quality of life. Preclinical models are 
valuable tools for testing novel analgesics, but new methods that are 
translationally and clinically relevant are necessary. This study aimed to 
assess spontaneous pain-like behavior of home cage activity and wheel running in 
Digital Ventilated Cages®.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty BALB/cAnNHsd mice were housed in Digital 
Ventilated Cages® from Tecniplast® with GYM500 home cage running wheels. Ten 
mice underwent 4T1-Luc2 mammary gland adenocarcinoma cell inoculation into the 
right femur to establish CIBP and another ten mice underwent a sham procedure. 
Mice were assessed by limb use and static weight bearing to determine the 
development of CIBP and this was compared to the dark-phase home cage activity 
and wheel running in the Digital Ventilated Cages®.
RESULTS: The 4T1-Luc2-inoculated mice displayed pain-like behavior in limb-use 
and weight-bearing tests, demonstrating a preference for the contralateral limb. 
The limb-use scores were compared with home cage activity and wheel running. 
Reduced wheel running distance corresponded to reduced limb-use scores, with the 
shortest wheel running distances corresponding to the lowest scores. However, 
this behavioral pattern was not observed in home-cage activity, which remained 
consistent throughout the study.
CONCLUSION: Wheel running behavior appears to be affected by the development of 
metastatic breast cancer. Wheel running in a Digital Ventilated Cage® may be a 
useful behavioral assessment of spontaneous pain-like behavior of CIBP and may 
be useful to assess analgesic efficacy.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a type of lung cancer with 
a high mortality rate. Many molecular and biochemical mechanisms are involved in 
its development, among which the suppression of tumorigenicity-2 protein (ST2) 
signaling pathway. Soluble ST2 (sST2) competes with transmembrane ST2 (ST2 
ligand) for IL-33 binding. Activation of IL-33/ST2 pathway leads to M2 
macrophage polarization, which promotes tumor progression. Since Caspase-3 is 
implicated in the regulation of IL-33 activity, the present study aimed to 
analyze the serum levels of IL-33, sST2, and caspase-3 in non-small cell lung 
cancer patients, compare them with control samples, and simultaneously 
investigate their predictive capacity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, sST2 protein, IL-33, and caspase-3 levels 
were investigated using the ELISA method in serum samples collected from 25 
patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer and 25 completely healthy 
volunteer individuals. In the study, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic power of the biomarkers.
RESULTS: Serum IL-33 levels were found to be significantly elevated in patients 
compared to the control group (p<0.0001). Similarly, the patient group showed 
significantly higher caspase-3 serum levels than the control group (p<0.030). 
While sST2 serum levels were higher in the patient group, the difference did not 
reach statistical significance. The ROC analysis for IL-33 showed an area under 
the curve (AUC) value of 0.838 [95% confidence interval (CI)=0.725-0.952, 
p<0.05], indicating that IL-33 is good diagnostic capability for NSCLC. The AUC 
value for Caspase-3 was 0.678 (95% CI=0.525-0.832, p=0.023), while for sST2, the 
AUC value was 0.499 (95% CI=0.333-0.665, p>0.05).
CONCLUSION: NSCLC patients are characterized by increased IL-33 and caspase-3 
serum levels. These findings suggest that these markers could serve as valuable 
diagnostic and prognostic indicators, in addition to being potential therapeutic 
targets.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) is a significant concern for 
patients with breast cancer (BC). Although scalp-cooling therapy has shown 
efficacy in reducing scalp hair loss, its effects on eyebrow and eyelash 
preservation have been unclear.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study of 154 
patients with BC who received perioperative chemotherapy from 2016 to 2024. 
Seventeen of these patients underwent scalp cooling using the Paxman Scalp 
Cooling System (Paxman, Houston, TX, USA). Patient-reported outcomes were 
assessed via questionnaires evaluating the degree of hair loss at the scalp, 
eyebrows, eyelashes, and body hair.
RESULTS: Scalp cooling significantly reduced the incidence of severe hair loss 
(score 4-5) at the scalp (p<0.001). Although the differences in eyebrow and 
eyelash hair loss were not significant (p=0.095 and p=0.199, respectively), a 
trend toward reduced severe alopecia was observed. No protective effect was 
observed for body hair (p=0.446).
CONCLUSION: Scalp-cooling therapy is effective for preventing severe scalp hair 
loss and may offer partial protection against eyebrow and eyelash alopecia. 
These findings support its broader application in BC care to enhance patients' 
quality of life.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Sideroflexin 4 (SFXN4) is important for mitochondrial function 
and relatively unstudied in relation to cancer. The aim of the study was to 
examine the SFXN4 gene and protein expression in patients with colorectal cancer 
(CRC) to identify associations with various clinicopathological parameters and 
evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic significance.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: SFXN4 protein and mRNA expression in cancer and paired 
normal tissues was determined in patients with CRC using enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and RT-qPCR. Immunohistochemical staining was used 
to study the cell type origin of the SFXN4 expression. SFXN4 was silenced in 
HT-29 cells and several genes known to be involved in colorectal carcinogenesis 
were examined on mRNA level by RT-qPCR.
RESULTS: The protein and mRNA level of SFXN4 was 35 and 19% higher in tumor 
tissue compared to those in normal paired tissue (p<0.05). Non-mucinous type 
expressed 21% higher protein level compared to levels in the mucinous type 
(p<0.05). Immunohistochemistry revealed SFXN4 cytoplasmic staining mainly in the 
epithelial cells in cancer and normal tissue. A 19% higher SFXN4 mRNA level was 
observed in smaller tumors and in left colon compared to right colon cancer 
(p<0.05). Silencing of SFXN4 in HT-29 cells resulted in an up-regulation of IL-8 
by 63% and increased proliferation (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate the importance of SFXN4 in colorectal 
carcinogenesis and extended studies are necessary to elucidate its role as a 
prognostic biomarker.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Lymphovascular invasion is a well-established poor prognostic 
factor following limited resection in lung cancer patients. Therefore, 
predicting the presence of lymphovascular invasion based on clinical factors may 
facilitate the selection of the most appropriate surgical procedure. The aim of 
the present study was to identify preoperative predictive factors associated 
with pathological lymphovascular invasion.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 248 primary lung cancer patients with cN0, 
computed tomography findings of ≤2.0 cm overall diameter, were included in this 
retrospective study. The presence of lymphovascular invasion was evaluated on a 
pathological basis, using resection specimens for factors of lymphatic and 
vascular invasions. Positive results for one or both factors were defined as 
positive for lymphovascular invasion. The diagnosis of lymphatic invasion was 
examined using immunostaining for D2-40. The presence of vascular invasion was 
evaluated using the elastic van Gieson staining method.
RESULTS: Univariate analysis indicated that the presence of a smoking history, a 
consolidation tumor ratio (CTR) >0.5, an elevated CYFRA, and a tumor in the 
hilar location were significant predictive factors for lymphovascular invasion. 
In multivariate analysis, the CTR >0.5, elevation of CYFRA, and tumor hilar 
location were independent predictive factors for lymphovascular invasion. A 
statistically significant correlation between tumor location and lymphovascular 
invasion was also observed in both the adenocarcinoma and squamous cell 
carcinoma subgroups.
CONCLUSION: Central lesions tended to exhibit higher frequency of lymphovascular 
invasion. Therefore, the expansion of limited resection for centrally located 
tumor lesions in small-sized NSCLC should be carefully considered.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Anamorelin, a ghrelin receptor agonist, increases body weight 
and lean body mass (LBM); however, its effects on the gut microbiota remain 
unclear. Furthermore, the predictive value of nutritional scores, such as the 
Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score, for anamorelin response is not 
established. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of anamorelin on body 
weight, quality of life (QOL), and gut microbiota in patients with advanced 
cancer and cachexia, and to clarify the predictive role of nutritional 
indicators.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This single-center prospective observational study 
enrolled cachectic patients (non-small cell lung, pancreatic, gastric, or 
colorectal cancer) receiving anamorelin 100 mg/day with dietary counseling. 
Outcomes included change in body weight (baseline, 3, 6, 12 weeks), QOL (EORTC 
QLQ-C15-PAL), and gut microbiota diversity. The association between the baseline 
CONUT score and weight gain (>0 kg at 6 weeks) was analyzed.
RESULTS: Sixteen patients were analyzed. Body weight significantly increased 
from baseline at weeks 3, 6, and 12 (mean change at 12 weeks: +2.61±0.72 kg, 
p=0.008). In the eight patients assessed for QOL, the overall scale showed no 
significant change. The score for appetite loss (Q8) was 2.125±0.835 at 0 weeks 
vs. 1.375±0.744 at 6 weeks (unadjusted p=0.033). Gut microbiota alpha and beta 
diversity showed no significant change. A high baseline CONUT score (≥5) was 
associated with failure to gain weight in six weeks compared to a score <5 
(87.5% of non-gainers had a high score vs. 12.5%; unadjusted p=0.01).
CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, anamorelin significantly increased body weight 
and suggested an improvement in appetite in patients with cancer and cachexia. 
No significant changes in overall QOL or gut microbiota diversity were detected 
at 6 weeks. The finding that a high baseline CONUT score may predict a lack of 
short-term weight gain warrants further investigation.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Prostate cancer is a multifactorial disease influenced by both 
genetic and environmental factors. Previous studies have identified a 
correlation between p21 expression and the clinical severity of prostate cancer. 
However, the contribution of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), 
which encodes p21, to prostate cancer susceptibility remains unclear. This study 
aimed to evaluate the association between CDKN1A polymorphisms rs1801270 and 
rs1059234 and the risk of prostate cancer in a Taiwanese population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 218 patients with prostate cancer and 436 
cancer-free controls were genotyped for CDKN1A rs1801270 and rs1059234 using the 
PCR-RFLP method. Genotypic distributions were analyzed for associations with 
prostate cancer risk overall and stratified by age and smoking status.
RESULTS: No significant association was observed between either CDKN1A rs1801270 
or rs1059234 genotypes and overall prostate cancer risk (both p>0.05). However, 
stratified analysis showed that individuals aged <55 years carrying the 
rs1801270 variant genotypes (AC and AA) had a significantly increased risk of 
early-onset prostate cancer [odds ratio (OR)=2.16 and 2.51, 95% confidence 
interval (CI)=1.25-3.71 and 1.37-4.61, p=0.0069 and 0.0041, respectively]. 
Additionally, among non-smokers, carriers of the rs1059234 variant genotypes (CT 
and TT) exhibited a significantly reduced prostate cancer risk (OR=0.27 and 
0.36, 95%CI=0.11-0.64 and 0.14-0.98, p=0.0042 and 0.0739, respectively), 
indicating a potential gene-environment interaction.
CONCLUSION: While CDKN1A rs1801270 and rs1059234 may not serve as general 
predictive markers for prostate cancer susceptibility, they appear to modulate 
prostate cancer risk under specific age and smoking contexts. These findings 
merit further validation in larger and ethnically diverse populations and may 
contribute to more refined risk stratification and personalized prevention 
strategies.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Bacterial translocation (BT) is linked to increased 
postoperative infections in oncologic patients undergoing major abdominal 
surgery. This study evaluated the prognostic value of BT, serum endotoxin, and 
zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) for postoperative infections in patients with colon 
cancer undergoing open or laparoscopic colectomy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-one patients (40 open, 31 laparoscopic colectomy) 
were analyzed. Mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and liver tissue were cultured for 
BT detection. Serum endotoxin and ZO-1 were measured preoperatively and 24 h 
post-operation and compared with 12 healthy controls. Postoperative infections 
and hospital length of stay (HLOS) were recorded.
RESULTS: Postoperative infection rates did not differ between groups (p=0.16); 
however, open surgery patients had longer HLOS (p<0.001). BT rates were similar 
between groups. Endotoxin levels increased on Day 1 in both open (p=0.03) and 
laparoscopic (p=0.04) groups vs. controls. Serum ZO-1 was significantly higher 
preoperatively (p<0.001) and remained elevated postoperatively, with no group 
differences. BT was the only independent risk factor for infection [OR 95% 
confidence interval (CI)=17.45 (2.65-36.8), p=0.01], while endotoxin and ZO-1 
showed low prognostic accuracy. Open surgery and infections were independent 
predictors of prolonged HLOS (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Open and laparoscopic colectomy show similar infection rates. Serum 
ZO-1 and endotoxin are not reliable infection predictors. BT, detected via MLN 
and liver cultures, is an independent infection risk factor and may aid in 
identifying high-risk patients for enhanced postoperative surveillance and early 
intervention.

BACKGROUND/AIM: The standard of care for patients with muscle-invasive bladder 
cancer (MIBC) is treatment with radical cystectomy (RC) and perioperative 
platinum-based chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant). Perioperative treatment 
can improve overall survival (OS), and the most robust evidence favors 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The RealBLADDER study assessed the efficacy and 
safety of perioperative chemotherapy in patients with MIBC in an Italian 
real-world setting.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: RealBLADDER enrolled patients with MIBC treated with 
perioperative chemotherapy from June 2018 to June 2023. The primary endpoint was 
the rate of non-invasive downstaging (NID) (ypT0/pTis/pTaN0 or <ypT1N0) and 
complete pathological response (pCR) (yp0N0), defined as the absence of residual 
tumor cells in the bladder and lymph nodes at the pathological examination after 
NAC. Secondary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS), OS and surgical 
outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 173 eligible patients were identified. One hundred and 
thirty-seven patients (79.2%) received NAC and 36 (20.8%) received adjuvant 
chemotherapy (AC). The NID rate was 36.8%, and pCR achieved in 33.6% of patients 
treated with NAC. The rate of surgical morbidity and mortality were 20.9% and 
0%, respectively. The 12-month DFS was 73.7% [95% confidence interval 
(CI)=0.672-0.808]. The 12-month OS rate in the entire population was 92.1% 
(95%CI=0.880-0.963). Compared to AC, DFS was improved in patients treated with 
NAC (p=0.019).
CONCLUSION: NAC is associated with an improved DFS compared to AC, a high rate 
of NID and pCR and low rate of surgical morbidity and mortality, supporting NAC 
as the preferred perioperative strategy for MIBC in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND/AIM: To compare survival outcomes and radiation-related toxicities 
between conventional radiotherapy (CvT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy 
(VMAT) in patients with early glottic cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed 81 patients with Tis-T2N0 glottic cancer who 
underwent definitive radiotherapy between 2010 and 2018. CvT (N=47) was 
delivered using two opposing lateral beams (70 Gy in 35 fractions), while VMAT 
(N=34) utilized two arcs (65.25 Gy in 29 fractions). Hypothyroidism was defined 
as an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level with or without a decrease in 
free T4 or T3 levels.
RESULTS: The overall median follow-up time was 80.0 months and was longer in the 
CvT group (116.0 months) than in the VMAT group (45.3 months). Five-year local 
failure-free survival (95.4% vs. 84.5%, p=0.088), regional failure-free survival 
(93.0% vs. 94.1%, p=0.481), locoregional failure-free survival (90.9% vs. 84.7%, 
p=0.319), and overall survival (89.4% vs. 90.7%, p=0.575) were comparable 
between the CvT and VMAT groups, respectively. No increase in regional failure 
was observed in the VMAT group despite exclusion of the anterior level III neck. 
Most local failures in the VMAT group occurred near the original tumor site and 
were associated with T2 disease (p=0.015). Hypothyroidism occurred more 
frequently in the CvT group (53.5%) than in the VMAT group (25.9%, p=0.043). 
Carotid artery events were noted in three patients treated with CvT (6.4%), with 
none in the VMAT group.
CONCLUSION: VMAT demonstrated comparable survival outcomes to CvT while 
significantly reducing the incidence of hypothyroidism and potentially lowering 
carotid artery events. VMAT may be considered a preferred modality to improve 
quality of life in patients with early glottic cancer.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a highly tumorigenic cell population present in 
many malignancies and cancer cell lines, frequently exhibiting resistance to 
conventional chemotherapeutic agents. In this brief review, we discuss the 
ability CSCs to transdifferentiate into endothelial cells by expressing markers 
of the vascular endothelium. We highlight the similarities between mechanisms 
found in embryonic and tumor development, emphasizing mechanisms that enable 
CSCs to adopt an endothelial phenotype. Correlations with cellular and molecular 
mechanisms favoring CSC-to-endothelial transition, but also the impact on 
vasculogenic mimicry and antiangiogenic/antivascular drug resistance are also 
debated.

Background: The number of retrieved lymph nodes (rLN) is an important surgical 
metric associated with survival in cancer. However, its association with 
oncological outcomes in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) with 
lateral lymph node (LN) metastasis (N1b disease) has not been investigated. 
Methods: This retrospective cohort study included patients with PTC and N1b 
disease (N = 1003) who underwent lateral neck dissection and categorized them by 
total number of rLNs. We investigated the association of the categories with 
recurrence or cancer-specific mortality (CSM) using multivariable Cox 
proportional hazard models. The optimal number of rLNs associated with low 
recurrence rate or CSM were identified using restricted cubic spline analysis. 
Survival analyses across subgroups were performed according to adequate (the 
estimated total number of rLN at which CSM appeared to be lowest) and inadequate 
groups. Results: At initial surgery, the median total number of rLNs and 
positive number of LNs was 36.0 (25.0-49.0) and 9.0 (5.0-14.0), respectively. 
During a median follow-up of 90.0 (73.0-129.0) months, recurrence and CSM were 
detected in 165 and 30 patients, respectively. A higher total number of rLNs was 
inversely associated with the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for recurrence (0.50, 
0.51, 0.33, and 0.28; p for trend = 0.001) and CSM (0.33, 0.13, 0.02, and 0.04; 
p for trend 0.002). The estimated total number of rLNs associated with the 
lowest recurrence rate and CSM were 32 and 33, respectively. Compared with the 
inadequate rLNs group, the adequate rLNs group (≥33 total rLNs) showed better 
prognosis in the entire group (aHR 0.51 [0.35-0.73], p < 0.001; recurrence) (aHR 
0.14 [0.04-0.47], p = 0.001; CSM) and various subgroups. Conclusions: rLNs are 
associated with recurrence and CSM in patients with PTC and N1b disease, with 
outcomes appearing to improve at approximately 32-33. This finding suggests that 
rLNs may serve as a potential quality indicator for neck dissection in PTC. Our 
finding is mostly applicable to more aggressive disease, and further prospective 
confirmatory research is warranted.

Breast cancer is very prevalent. Although detection and treatment of primary 
disease has improved significantly, 20-30% of patients will develop recurrent 
metastatic disease; this stage being associated with poor survival. Small 
extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are emerging as critical mediators of 
intercellular communication in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we 
investigate the mechanisms by which sEVs derived from neutrophils treated with 
the cholesterol metabolite, 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), influence breast 
cancer progression. Interestingly, sEVs released from 27HC treated neutrophils 
enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem-like properties in 
breast cancer cells. This resulted in a striking loss of adherence, increased 
migratory capacity and resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy. When exploring the 
potential mechanism, we found that EVs from 27HC-treated neutrophils had altered 
microRNAs (miR) expression. Decreased miRs within 27HC-sEVs, particularly of the 
let-7 family, resulted in activation of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway in 
recipient cancer cells, suggesting that this may be a predominant pathway for 
adopting stem-like properties. Our findings underscore a novel mechanism by 
which a cholesterol metabolite can modulate neutrophils and thereby contribute 
to breast cancer pathophysiology through EV-mediated intercellular 
communication. This work represents the first steps in developing this axis for 
potential therapeutic interventions.

Obesity increases the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) development, accelerates 
disease progression and is associated with decreased disease-free survival. 
Obesity adversely affects the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) leading to increased 
secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs). However, the crosstalk between VAT 
and CRC tumor cells still remains unclear. EVs are lipid-membraned particles 
that transfer cargo to and/or induce signaling in other cells. Here, we 
characterized human VAT-derived non-obese (N-OB) and obese (OB) EVs and 
investigated the functional interaction between CRC cells and VAT-derived EVs. 
EVs were isolated from VAT obtained from obese (BMI>30) and non-obese patients 
(BMI<30). Unbiased proteomics revealed that compared to N-OB EVs, OB EVs were 
enriched with glycolytic enzymes like triose phosphate isomerase (TPI1). This 
enrichment was associated with increased TPI1 protein levels in CRC cells and 
elevated glycolytic activity. OB EV-treated cells also exhibited increased 
stemness-associated genes, 3D-spheroid formation and Apcmin/+ tumoroid 
self-renewal capacity. In vivo, mice with an adipocyte-specific knockout of EV 
cargo sorting protein, Tsg101 (Tsg101ΔAd), have altered EV cargo composition 
with reduced glycolytic enzyme levels. Functionally, Tsg101ΔAd-EVs were able to 
protect against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced increase in glycolysis and stem-like 
ability. Moreover, Apcmin/+:Tsg101ΔAd mice were protected against HFD-induced 
enhanced tumorigenesis. Collectively, this study identifies adipocyte EVs, and 
its metabolic cargo, as an important regulator of CRC cell metabolism and 
function, promoting intestinal tumorigenesis.

BACKGROUND: Several studies demonstrate the survival benefit of neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy and immunotherapy (chemo-IO) for patients with operable Non-Small 
Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) versus chemotherapy alone. Persistent uncertainty 
exists regarding real-world reproducibility of these findings, as granular data 
outside clinical trials remain limited.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed prospectively maintained lung cancer 
registries and thoracic surgery databases from two high-volume Canadian thoracic 
oncology centers. Inclusion criteria were patients with proven clinical stage 
II-III NSCLC, who received at least 1 cycle of neoadjuvant chemo-IO. Survival 
curves were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier test, and receiver operating curve 
analysis was performed to predict pathological complete response after 
neoadjuvant treatment according to standardized uptake value reduction.
RESULTS: A total of 78 patients were included, with a median follow-up of 12.3 
months. Adverse events from neoadjuvant chemo-IO occurred in 54% of patients, of 
which 47% were grade 1-2 and 14% grade 3. Pathological complete response was 24% 
for a cohort where PD-L1 TPS ≥50% was present in 46% of patients. A sensitivity 
analysis on 39 patients with Positron Emission Tomography scans before and after 
chemo-IO demonstrated that a 70% reduction in standardized uptake value max 
significantly correlated with pathological Complete Response (AUC 0.89; p=0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the safety and short-term efficacy of 
neoadjuvant chemo-IO. Reduction in standardized uptake value on Positron 
Emission Tomography scans was associated with pathological complete response, 
indicating its potential as a surrogate biomarker pending further validation.

Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is the main modifiable risk factor for skin cancer, 
causing direct DNA damage. Genetic factors influence UV-mediated skin cancer 
risk by modulating the skin's response to UVR, typically seen as acute 
inflammation (sunburn) or a delayed increase of melanin production (tanning). 
Although biologically distinct, most studies to date have not differentiated 
between these outcomes, conflating their genetic risk profiles. The purpose of 
this study was to compare the genetics of tanning and sunburn. We analyzed 
genetic data from 24,163 participants in the QSkin cohort, which separately 
measured tanning and sunburn propensity. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
was preformed to identify associated loci, estimate heritability and genetic 
correlation. A multi-trait analysis was conducted to enhance discovery power, 
incorporating published GWAS from UK Biobank. 16 genomic risk loci were 
identified for tanning and sunburn; 8 loci overlapped. Heritability was 37% for 
tanning and 28% for sunburn. The genetic correlation coefficient was -0.92 [95% 
confidence interval -0.99, -0.85]. Multi-trait analysis identified 108 risk 
loci, of which 63 were shared. Most genetic variants affected both traits, 
suggesting a similar underlying biological pathway. Overall, our analysis found 
no evidence to suggest that the genetic structure of tanning differs 
substantively from that of sunburn.

The concept of ""HER2-negative"" breast cancer is evolving, with the recognition 
of HER2-low and HER2-ultralow subsets. These subsets are clinically relevant 
regarding treatment with the antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan 
(T-DXd), which has shown survival benefit in patients with metastatic carcinoma 
with minimal HER2 protein expression that lack HER2 gene amplification by in 
situ hybridisation (ISH). In clinical trials using T-DXd, HER2-low was defined 
as immunohistochemistry (IHC) score 1+ or IHC score 2+ without HER2 gene 
amplification. HER2-ultralow was defined as faint or barely perceptible, 
incomplete membrane staining in >0 to ≤10% of tumour cells (IHC score 0+/with 
membrane staining) and HER2-null as complete absence of staining (IHC score 
0/absent membrane staining). These results now necessitate more detailed 
evaluation and reporting of traditional ""HER2-negative"" results to identify 
patients with metastatic breast cancer who may benefit from T-DXd therapy. Both 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA) have extended regulatory approval of T-DXd to patients with metastatic 
breast cancer showing HER2-low or HER2-ultralow expression. Updated clinical 
management guidelines now, therefore, incorporate the spectrum of HER2 results 
into treatment selection algorithms in the metastatic setting. To align 
histopathologic practice with these developments, the College of American 
Pathologists (CAP) has issued a new biomarker-reporting template that recommends 
explicit distinction between IHC 0/absent membrane staining and IHC 0+/with 
membrane staining. Key concerns among pathologists include assay variability, 
scoring reproducibility and quality assurance standards for accurately detecting 
such low levels of HER2 expression. This manuscript provides expert consensus, 
evidence-based practical recommendations for identifying and reporting tumours 
with HER2-low and HER2-ultralow expression. We emphasise standardised testing 
protocols, validated assays, robust internal and external controls, and focused 
training for pathologists. A universal structured pathology report is proposed 
to highlight the accurate distinction between IHC 0 (null), IHC 0+ (ultralow), 
and HER2-low expression.

BACKGROUND: Delayed time to treatment is a key determinant of poor survival 
among patients with lung cancer. Factors affecting timeliness of lung cancer 
treatment are multilevel in nature. Most interventions target only one level of 
influence. Existing evidence-based interventions (EBIs) that work in one setting 
may fail to work in a different setting due to poor fit in the new setting or 
deviations from the original intervention. Our study evaluated the feasibility 
of adopting a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) evidence-based multilevel 
intervention (EBMLI) within an academic health system.
METHODS: The VHA EBMLI is a multilevel lung cancer care coordination program 
previously employed by the VHA targeting the individual-, provider team-, and 
organization- level. The intervention effectively reduced time to treatment for 
Veterans with lung cancer over 7 years with significant individual level 
reductions by about 50%. We conducted a survey of providers across 5 sites on 
the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility towards the EBMLI using the 
following validated scales: 1) Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM, score 
range: 1-5); 2) Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM, 1-5); 3) Feasibility 
of Intervention Measure (FIM, 1-5); 4) Implementation Climate Scale (ICS, 0-4) 
and; 5) Implementation Leadership Scale (ILS, 0-4).
RESULTS: 45 providers consented to participate in the survey and 36 (mean age 
46±11 years) across 5 sites completed the survey. Most had MD or PhD degrees 
(46%) and were physicians (42%), had >10 years healthcare experience (49%) with 
20±20 patients with lung cancer seen per week, of which 60% of providers saw 
only adult patients. Mean scores on the scales were: AIM (4.1±0.8), IAM 
(4.0±0.8), FIM (4.1±0.8), ICS (2.7±0.7), ILS (3.2±0.9).
CONCLUSION: While the proposed EBMLI may be well received by providers and 
leadership, acknowledgement of contexts affecting organizational climate is 
needed to assure feasibility of the adaptation, implementation and 
sustainability of the VHA EBMLI.

BACKGROUND: Areca nut is classified as a Group I carcinogen for oral cavity 
malignancies by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Cultivation of 
the substance and oral cancer incidences have risen considerably in recent 
years. The assessment of areca nut-related health risk awareness is an 
increasingly imperative global health topic.
METHODS: A systematic review of the Medline, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane 
databases was undertaken in search of prospective survey studies evaluating 
areca nut-related health literacy in adults. The primary outcome of interest was 
the percentage of respondents that were unaware that areca nut products cause 
oral cancer. A random effects meta-analysis was used to calculate pooled 
weighted averages. Subgroup analyses stratifying by healthcare education level, 
geography and publication year were performed using a Chi-square test.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight articles with a total of 13,440 respondents were included 
in the analysis. Collectively, 50% (95% CI: 40%-60%, I2 99·5%) of respondents 
did not identify areca nut products in general as a risk factor for oral cancer. 
Only five studies specifically inquired about the carcinogenicity of areca nut 
without additives. Collectively, 80% (95% CI: 63%-96%, I2 99·3%) of these 
respondents did not know that pure areca nut is a carcinogen. There were no 
significant discrepancies on subgroup analyses by healthcare education level, 
geography or date of publication.
CONCLUSION: An international collection of evidence substantiates drastic areca 
nut-related health literacy deficiencies internationally.
POLICY SUMMARY: There is an urgent need for healthcare professionals in areca 
nut regions to launch formalized educational campaigns. Medically-accurate, 
culturally-sensitive warning labels are strongly indicated.

PURPOSE: Financial toxicity has garnered increasing attention due to the 
financial ""toxic effect"" of cancer therapy. This study was conducted to provide 
an overall research landscape on financial toxicity from chronological, 
geographical, socioeconomic and epidemiological perspectives.
DESIGNS: Publications on financial toxicity were retrieved from the Web of 
Science Core Collection. IBM SPSS 26.0 was used to analyze the correlation 
between the number of publications and socioeconomic and epidemiological 
factors. VOSviewer, CiteSpace, Scimago Graphica and Pajek were used for 
country/region collaboration, reference cocitation, keyword cooccurrence, and 
keyword burst analysis.
RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2024, 501 publications were identified, with the 
number of publications increasing annually. The annual number of publications 
was highly positively correlated with the annual cancer incidence rate, 
prevalence rate, death rate, and disability-adjusted life years (R2 = 0.907, 
0.820, 0.836, 0.808, respectively). The number of publications in different 
countries was highly positively correlated with total health spending, 
government health spending, and out-of-pocket health spending (R2 = 0.955, 
0.906, 0.746, respectively). The top journal was Supportive Care in Cancer (79 
publications). Research hotspots focus on the impact of financial toxicity on 
quality of life and psychological distress, the measurement and cost burden of 
financial toxicity, its impact on health outcomes, and the employment and health 
impact of financial toxicity. Research frontiers focused on the financial stress 
and young adult.
CONCLUSIONS: The increasing number of publications on financial toxicity 
highlights its growing recognition as an important issue in healthcare. Health 
professionals and governments should address the high costs of cancer care and 
explore interventions to reduce its impact on patients and healthcare spending.

PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of SIRT7 on the development of cervical 
cancer and its relationship with cuproptosis in cervical cancer.
METHOD: Hela and SiHa cells were transfected with lentiviruses for SIRT7 
overexpression and knockdown. The effects of SIRT7 on cervical cancer cell 
proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration were analyzed using CCK8, 
plate cloning, flow cytometry, Transwell assays, and scratch assays. To verify 
the relationship between SIRT7 and cuproptosis, we utilized cuproptosis 
inhibitors and activators. Immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscope, 
flow cytometry, ELISA, and western blot were used to analyze copper ion content, 
mitochondrial ultrastructure, cellular reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial 
membrane potential, pyruvate levels, cell viability and the cuproptosis-related 
proteins.
RESULTS: SIRT7 enhanced the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HeLa and 
SiHa cells, inhibited apoptosis, and suppressed cervical cancer growth. Knocking 
down SIRT7 caused cuproptosis of HeLa and SiHa cells, characterized by increased 
Cu2+ content, disrupted mitochondrial structure, decreased membrane potential, 
elevated ROS production, and upregulation of cuproptosis proteins SLC31A1 and 
HSP70, and downregulation of FDX1, LIAS and DLAT. Low SIRT7 expression's effect 
on cuproptosis was reduced by TTM. SIRT7 overexpression inhibited cuproptosis, 
unlike SIRT7 knockdown. SIRT7 overexpression's inhibitory effect on cuproptosis 
is altered by rhSLC31A1.
CONCLUSION: SIRT7 was recognized as an oncogene in cervical cancer, which 
boosted cervical cancer cell proliferation and invasion, lowered intracellular 
copper levels, and prevented cuproptosis. SIRT7 downregulation triggered 
cuproptosis, inhibiting tumor cell growth.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory and insulinemic dietary patterns have been associated 
with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, but generalizability across diverse 
populations with heterogeneous food supplies and dietary behaviors has not been 
established.
OBJECTIVE: We harmonized disparate dietary and covariate data on a large scale 
to compute the reverse Empirical Dietary Index for Hyperinsulinemia-rEDIH, 
reverse Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Pattern-rEDIP, and Healthy Eating Index 
(HEI)-2015 scores, and tested their associations with CRC risk.
METHODS: We leveraged data among 501,892 women and 407,390 men from six cohorts 
across the U.S. (NIH-AARP, MESA, PLCO, SCCS) and Europe (EPIC, ATBC) with 
varying sociodemographic characteristics, participating in the Consortium of 
Metabolomics Studies. We harmonized nomenclature and nutritional information for 
more than 800 unique food items across cohorts. We used multivariable-adjusted 
Cox regression, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors, to 
calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the 
associations between the dietary indices and CRC risk per cohort, then 
meta-analyzed the estimates.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 14.9 years, 16,525 incident CRC cases were 
diagnosed. Participants in the highest quintile of rEDIH (low-insulinemic diet) 
had an 18% reduced risk of CRC (HR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.86) compared to those 
in the lowest quintile. For the same comparison, similar risk reductions were 
observed for rEDIP (anti-inflammatory diet) (HR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.89) and 
HEI-2015 (overall dietary quality) (HR 0.80; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.85). Heterogeneity 
between cohorts in the meta-analyzed estimates was low for rEDIH (I2=22.3%) 
compared to rEDIP (I2=62.5%) and HEI-2015 (I2=83.9%).
CONCLUSION: Using carefully harmonized data from nearly one million individuals 
in the U.S. and Europe, we observed significant CRC risk reduction with habitual 
intake of low-insulinemic and anti-inflammatory dietary patterns, comparable to 
higher overall dietary quality. Study findings underscore the utility of these 
dietary patterns for global cancer prevention efforts.

The activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathways holds immense 
potential for cancer immunotherapy. Nevertheless, the challenge lies in 
achieving precise and efficient STING activation within tumors while avoiding 
systemic immunotoxicity. Here, we develop a novel nanotherapeutic platform, 
termed HAL@SyBVs, by simply electroporating FDA-approved prodrug 
5-aminolevulinate hydrochloride (HAL) into the synthetic bacterial vesicles 
(SyBVs), which allows for the spatiotemporal orchestration of STING pathways. 
Following systemic injection, HAL@SyBVs target tumor tissues, where HAL induces 
the confined biosynthesis and accumulation of sonosensitizer protoporphyrin IX 
(PpIX) within mitochondria. Upon ultrasound irradiation, PpIX-induced reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) trigger the release of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), thereby 
achieving precise STING activation. Simultaneously, SyBVs enhance STING 
signaling by impeding its degradation, thereby amplifying the immune response. 
This intelligent synergy effectively ameliorates the immunosuppressive tumor 
microenvironment and elicits a robust antitumor T cell immune response, 
resulting in comprehensive tumor regression without apparent adverse effects.

PURPOSE: To apply a Quality and Safety Continuous Process Improvement approach 
guided by Continuous Quality Improvement and Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles to 
develop, refine and assess a digital reminder program's effect on Screening 
Mammography Missed Care Opportunity (SM-MCO) rates.
METHODS: Study conducted at two FQHCs and a mobile mammography unit. The 
pre-PDSA period was October 2020-June 2023, and the post-PDSA period was July 
2023-January 2025. PDSA 1 launched a multilingual Short Messaging System (SMS) 
reminder across all sites. PDSA 2 standardized reminder process. PDSA 3 
implemented an SM educational video. The primary outcome assessed the PDSA 
cycles' effect on SM-MCO rates. The secondary outcome assessed digital 
engagement. QI SPC p-chart tracked appointment-level data. Univariate and 
logistic regression analyses assessed primary and secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: 18,654 appointments were included in the analysis; average age was 
56.8. (SD = 9.6 years) and 51.9% identified as Hispanic. The overall SM-MCO rate 
declined from 29.2% pre-PDSA to 26.9% post-PDSA (p<0.001). Appointments with SMS 
had a 35% SM-MCO rate, compared to 21.7% without (p<0.001). Appointments with 
digital engagement had an SM-MCO rate, 21.7% compared to 40.4% without 
engagement (p<0.001). Appointments that received and viewed the video had an 
SM-MCO rate of 11.5% compared to 26.9% without it (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Although a modest decrease in overall SM-MCOs rate was observed, 
SM-MCO rates were higher among appointments that received SMS reminders but 
lower among appointments with digital engagement, underscoring the digital 
divide complexity. QI frameworks can continuously monitor and refine digital 
strategies to increase access to radiology.

This retrospective study was designed to demonstrate the clinical utility of two 
diagnostic tests, the FoundationOneCDx (F1CDx) and Exact Sciences Resolution 
homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) (Resolution HRD assay) as clinical 
trial-enrollment assays to identify mCRPC patients harboring homologous 
recombination repair (HRR) gene alterations. Tumor tissue and plasma collected 
from mCRPC patients in the Phase 3 MAGNITUDE study were tested using the F1CDx 
tissue assay and/or the Resolution HRD plasma assay. Patients with HRR 
alterations were randomized (1:1) to receive niraparib (NIRA) and abiraterone 
acetate (AA)+prednisone (NIRA+AAP) or placebo and AAP (PBO+AAP; NCT03748641). 
Efficacy was based on radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS; primary 
endpoint), time-to-symptomatic progression (TSP), time-to-cytotoxic chemotherapy 
(TCC), and overall survival (OS) as secondary endpoints (interim analysis 1). Of 
423 HRR patients, 291 (68.8%) were HRR positive (HRR+) by F1CDx (BRCA+:162 
[38.2%]), and 38 (8.9%) were HRR negative (HRR-) by F1CDx but HRR+ by Resolution 
HRD assay. Also, 277/423 (65.5%) were HRR+ by Resolution HRD assay (BRCA+:150 
[35.5%]) and 124 (29.3%) were HRR- by Resolution HRD assay but HRR+ by F1CDx 
assay. Clinically meaningful benefits for all endpoints were comparable for 
BRCA+ and HRR+ patients detected by either tissue or plasma assays. These 
results demonstrated the clinical utility of both tissue and plasma assays in 
identifying patients for NIRA+AAP treatment.

PURPOSE: To report outcomes of cryoablation and microwave ablation (MWA) of 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in and adjacent to previously radiated lung.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included consecutive 
patients who underwent percutaneous cryoablation or MWA of NSCLC located in or 
adjacent to lung radiation fibrosis from 04/2015 to 10/2024. Adverse events 
(graded according to the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) 
classification system) within 30 days after ablation and hospital length of stay 
(HLOS) were compared between modalities using logistic regression. Local tumor 
progression-free survival (LTPFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared 
between modalities using log-rank testing.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (14 women; median age, 76 years) underwent 24 
ablations (18 cryoablations, 6 MWA) of 23 NSCLCs (median diameter 21 mm, one 
tumor per patient). Adverse events grade ≥3 occurred following 2 cryoablations 
(11%), including hemothorax and intercostal neuralgia, and 2 MWA sessions (33%), 
including pain and fatigue (p=0.238). Two pneumothoraces requiring drainage (SIR 
Grade 2) occurred following cryoablations (11%). Median HLOS was 1 day for both 
groups (p=0.730). LTPFS was 80% at 12-months and 66% at 24-months and higher for 
cryoablation (p=0.022). After a median imaging follow-up of 12 months (IQR, 
10-23), eleven patients died. OS was 80% at 12-months and 57% at 24-months with 
no significant difference observed between ablation modalities (p=0.527).
CONCLUSION: Differences in safety and effectiveness were observed following 
percutaneous cryoablation and MWA of NSCLC located in or adjacent to previously 
radiated lung, though statistical certainty is limited by sample size.

Over the past decades, significant advancements have been made in various 
medical fields; however, ovarian cancer (OC) remains inadequately addressed, 
predominantly relying on relatively toxic cytostatic treatments. In this study, 
we applied newly developed poly(β-amino) esters (PBAEs) for siRNA delivery. As 
recent literature has shown, the introduction of a hydrophobic, unsaturated 
fatty acid together with polycationic spermines as the PBAE side chains are 
leading to a favourable transfection efficiency, and the resulting materials 
form a unique class of micelleplexes, termed micelle-embedded polyplexes 
(mPolyplexes). Here, such mPolyplexes were modified post-particle formation with 
the approved monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab for HER2 targeting, as supported by 
a receptor binding analysis through fluorescence shift assay. Physicochemical 
analysis revealed suitable hydrodynamic diameters of modified mPolyplexes, as 
determined by dynamic light scattering. Improved cellular uptake when targeted 
with Trastuzumab was optimized by applying Design of Experiment (DoE). We 
demonstrated superior gene silencing efficiency of EGFR as well as PLK1, both 
involved in OC progression, with knockdown values exceeding 82% and 70%, 
respectively. These findings were corroborated by a relevant cell migration 
assay. The macroscopic impact after PLK1 silencing on epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) was visualized using confocal microscopy. This work addresses 
critical questions in the field of ovarian cancer therapy and confirms the 
suitability of siRNA encapsulating PBAE nanocarriers as promising non-viral 
vectors.

Radiotherapy remains a standard treatment for prostate cancer (PCa), inducing 
tumor cell death and apoptosis. However, its efficacy depends on various 
factors, including tumor cell metabolism. In this study, we investigated whether 
alterations in proline metabolism influence the response of prostate cancer 
cells to radiation. The radiosensitivity of LNCaP and C4-2 cells after X-ray 
irradiation was assessed using colony formation and tumor-sphere assays, while 
Matrigel invasion assays evaluated in vitro cell invasion. We then examined the 
effect of radiation on proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) expression and MAPK/p-MAPK 
signaling via Western blotting. To further explore the role of proline 
metabolism in radiation response, we tested the impact of exogenous proline 
supplementation and PRODH knockdown on radiation efficacy in LNCaP and C4-2 
cells using the same assays. Finally, in vivo validation was performed using 
xenograft tumor models in nude mice to determine how proline and PRODH 
modulation influences radiation outcomes. Our results demonstrated that X-ray 
irradiation significantly inhibited prostate cancer cell growth and invasion. 
However, this effect was attenuated by exogenous proline supplementation. 
Following irradiation, proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) expression was upregulated, 
while phosphorylated MAPK (p-MAPK) levels were downregulated. Notably, the 
suppressive effect of proline on radiation efficacy was abolished upon PRODH 
knockdown, suggesting a key role for proline metabolism in radiation response. 
In vivo studies further supported these findings: X-ray irradiation effectively 
suppressed tumor growth in xenograft mouse models, but this therapeutic effect 
was diminished when mice were treated with proline solution. These observations 
align with our in vitro data, reinforcing the modulatory role of proline 
metabolism in radiosensitivity. While radiotherapy demonstrates robust antitumor 
effects in prostate cancer, our findings reveal that proline metabolism 
significantly impairs radiation efficacy in both cellular and animal models.

CONTEXT.—: On May 14, 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 
self-collected vaginal samples for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, expanding 
cervical cancer screening access.
OBJECTIVE.—: To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of HPV 
self-collection through community outreach programs targeting underscreened 
populations in Oregon.
DESIGN.—: From October 2024 to June 2025, women aged 25 to 65 years were 
recruited through local organizations. Following instruction by pathologists, 
participants completed self-collection by using Copan swabs, which were 
transferred to ThinPrep media for high-risk HPV testing using the Cobas 8800 
system. Postcollection surveys assessed user experience.
RESULTS.—: Among 156 participants (mean age, 47.1 years), 87 (55.8%) identified 
as Hispanic and 69 (44.2%) as non-Hispanic. Racial groups included Hispanic 
White (87; 55.8%), Asian (33; 21.1%), Black (16; 10.3%), non-Hispanic White (14; 
9.0%), Pacific Islander (2; 1.3%), and nondisclosed (4; 2.5%). All tests were 
valid; 10 participants (6.4%) were HPV-positive, including 1 with HPV-18 and 9 
with non-16/18 types. Follow-up cytology showed 1 case of atypical squamous 
cells of undetermined significance and 2 negative results; the remainder are 
pending follow-up. Of 129 survey respondents, 8 (6.2%) had received the HPV 
vaccine. Overall, 117 (90.7%) found the self-collection kit easy to use, 114 
(88.4%) would recommend it, and 91 (70.6%) were likely to choose self-collection 
over clinician-collected samples for future testing. Common feedback included 
convenience, comfort, and privacy.
CONCLUSIONS.—: HPV self-collection is a practical, user-friendly, and accessible 
screening option. Pathologist-led outreach may help close screening gaps. This 
study represents the first academic center-led implementation of FDA-approved 
self-collection in US community settings.

BACKGROUND: Abemaciclib, a potent CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor, has shown antitumour 
activity in prostate cancer models and in patients with metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have been heavily treated. We 
aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of abemaciclib in combination with 
abiraterone in patients with mCRPC.
METHODS: CYCLONE 2 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 
study done in 89 hospitals and academic and private research centres in 12 
countries. All study parts had identical eligibility criteria, and used block 
randomisation with the same stratification factors (previous docetaxel 
treatment, presence of measurable disease, and type of progression). 
Participants were adults aged 18 years and older with histologically confirmed 
adenocarcinoma of the prostate and metastatic disease as documented by bone 
scans, CT scans, or MRI scans, and radiographic or PSA progression during 
continuous androgen deprivation therapy. Previous docetaxel for metastatic 
castration-sensitive prostate cancer was permitted; previous abiraterone, 
apalutamide, enzalutamide, darolutamide, or CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors were 
exclusionary. The trial was conducted in three parts. Part 1 was a four-arm, 
placebo-controlled safety and dose-finding lead-in to determine the recommended 
phase 2 dose of abemaciclib with abiraterone. Participants were randomly 
assigned (2:2:1:1) to receive abiraterone (1000 mg orally once daily) and 
prednisone or prednisolone (5 mg orally twice daily) with either abemaciclib at 
150 mg or 200 mg orally twice daily or with matching placebo (150 mg or 200 mg 
twice daily). In part 2 and part 3, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to 
standard abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone plus either abemaciclib at 
the recommended phase 2 dose or matching placebo. Patients, investigators, and 
sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome, 
investigator-assessed radiographic progression-free survival, was analysed in 
the intention-to-treat (participants from all study parts) population. Patients 
who received at least one dose of abiraterone, abemaciclib, or placebo were 
included in the safety population. This trial is registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03706365, and is completed.
FINDINGS: Between Nov 26, 2018, and July 20, 2022, 515 patients were screened 
for eligibility, 393 of whom were randomly assigned, 206 patients to abemaciclib 
plus abiraterone and 187 to placebo plus abiraterone. The median age was 70·0 
years (IQR 63·0-76·0). 289 (74%) of 393 patients identified as White, 80 (20%) 
as Asian, 17 (4%) as Black or African American, and seven (2%) as multiple race 
or not reported. The highest tested dose of 200 mg abemaciclib administered 
twice daily was chosen as the recommended phase 2 dose. The median follow-up 
time was 26·3 months (IQR 22·1-48·2) for the abemaciclib plus abiraterone group 
and 25·6 months (22·1-40·8) for the placebo plus abiraterone group. The primary 
endpoint of radiographic progression-free survival was not met: radiographic 
progression-free survival events were reported in 92 (45%) of 206 patients in 
the abemaciclib plus abiraterone group and 95 (51%) of 187 patients in the 
placebo plus abiraterone group (HR 0·83 [95% CI 0·62-1·11]; p=0·21). Median 
radiographic progression-free survival was 22·0 months (95% CI 19·3-27·5) for 
abemaciclib plus abiraterone and 20·3 months (16·5-24·4) for placebo plus 
abiraterone. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events reported in the 
abemaciclib plus abiraterone group were anaemia (28 [14%] of 206 vs eight [4%] 
of 185 in the placebo plus abiraterone group), neutropenia (26 [13%] vs one 
[1%]), and alanine aminotransferase increase (18 [9%] vs 12 [6%]). Serious 
adverse events occurred in 91 (44%) of 206 patients in the abemaciclib plus 
abiraterone group and in 68 (37%) of 185 patients in the placebo plus 
abiraterone group. There were three treatment-related deaths due to interstitial 
lung disease in the abemaciclib plus abiraterone group.
INTERPRETATION: Dual inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6 and the androgen receptor 
pathway with abemaciclib plus abiraterone did not improve radiographic 
progression-free survival compared with abiraterone alone in the CYCLONE 2 study 
population with mCRPC. Safety of the combination was consistent with the 
previously reported safety of the individual drugs. Additional research is 
required to identify effective combination therapies for patients with mCRPC, 
especially in those presenting with adverse prognostic characteristics.

BACKGROUND: Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd) is a novel antibody-drug conjugate 
targeting HER3, which is overexpressed in CNS metastases of metastatic breast 
cancer. We aimed to evaluate the activity and safety of HER3-DXd in patients 
with metastatic breast cancer and brain metastases that are newly diagnosed or 
progressing after local therapy.
METHODS: TUXEDO-3 trial is a multicohort, multicentre, open-label, single-arm 
phase 2 trial, done in six sites in Spain and Austria. In this cohort (1 of 3), 
we enrolled adults (≥18 years) with histologically documented breast cancer and 
radiologically documented metastatic disease, newly diagnosed brain metastases 
or brain metastases progressing after local treatment, at least one measurable 
brain lesion of ≥10 mm, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance 
status of 0-2. Patients received HER3-DXd 5·6 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 
weeks. The threshold for the primary endpoint was at least 15% of patients 
having intracranial response according to Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology 
Brain Metastases criteria. Activity and safety analyses were done in the full 
analysis population (ie, all participants who received at least one dose of 
HER3-DXd). This trial (ClinicalTrials.govNCT05865990 and European Union Clinical 
Trials Register 2023-503251-10-00) is ongoing and is no longer enrolling 
patients.
FINDINGS: Between Dec 12, 2023, and July 8, 2024, 21 evaluable female patients 
(five with luminal breast cancer, nine with HER2-positive breast cancer, and 
seven with triple-negative breast cancer) were recruited. 15 (71%) were White; 
race was not reported in the remaining six patients. The median number of 
previous treatment lines for advanced disease was 4 (IQR 2-4). Median treatment 
duration was 3·0 months (IQR 0·7-7·7), and median follow-up was 4·9 months (IQR 
3·6-8·5). The primary endpoint was met with five (24%) of 21 patients having 
intracranial responses irrespective of the breast cancer subtype (overall 
response rate 23·8%, 95% CI 8·2-47·1). The most common grade 3 or worse 
treatment-emergent adverse events were neutropenia in three (14%) patients, 
diarrhoea in two (10%) patients, and asthenia and vomiting in one (5%) patient 
each. Serious adverse events occurred in six (29%) patients, with one (5%) 
patient having grade 2 pneumonitis related to the study treatment. No 
treatment-related deaths were reported.
INTERPRETATION: HER3-DXd showed promising clinical activity in patients with 
metastatic breast cancer and active brain metastases, and could offer a novel 
therapeutic option in this setting.

BACKGROUND: Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd) is a novel antibody-drug conjugate 
targeting HER3, which is overexpressed in CNS metastases of advanced 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to evaluate the activity and safety 
of HER3-DXd in patients with advanced NSCLC and newly diagnosed brain metastases 
or brain metastases progressing after local therapy.
METHODS: TUXEDO-3 is a multicohort, multicentre, open-label, single-arm phase 2 
trial. In this cohort (2 of 3), we enrolled adults (aged ≥18 years) with 
histologically documented squamous or non-squamous NSCLC, radiologically 
documented metastatic disease, newly diagnosed brain metastases or progressing 
brain metastases after local treatment, at least one brain lesion, no need for 
immediate local therapy, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance 
status of 0-2. Patients received HER3-DXd 5·6 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 
weeks. The threshold to meet the primary endpoint was at least 15% of patients 
having an intracranial response according to Response Assessment in 
Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases criteria. Activity and safety analyses were done 
in the full analysis set, which included all participants who received at least 
one dose of HER3-DXd. This trial (ClinicalTrials.govNCT05865990 and European 
Union Clinical Trials Register 2023-503251-10-00) is ongoing but no longer 
enrolling patients.
FINDINGS: Between Dec 27, 2023, and Sept 6, 2024, 20 patients were recruited; 
ten (50%) were female and ten (50%) were male. 16 (80%) of 20 patients were 
White; race was not reported in the remaining four patients. 13 (65%) of the 20 
patients had brain metastases progressing after local therapy and seven (35%) 
had untreated brain metastases; five (25%) had activating driver mutations. 
Median follow-up was 5·3 months (IQR 2·0-8·5). The primary endpoint was met, 
with six (30%) of 20 patients having intracranial responses (objective response 
rate 30·0%, 95% CI 11·9-54·3). The six responders had non-squamous advanced 
NSCLC (two [33%] with untreated brain metastases and four [67%] with progressing 
brain metastases), of whom one (17%) had an activating driver mutation (KRAS 
G12C). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 16 (80%) patients, the most 
common of which were nausea (seven [35%] patients), and diarrhoea and asthenia 
(each six [30%] patients). The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were 
neutropenia in three (15%) patients and febrile neutropenia in two (10%). There 
were no treatment-related deaths, and no new safety signals were identified.
INTERPRETATION: HER3-DXd showed promising clinical activity in patients with 
advanced NSCLC and active brain metastases, and could represent a novel 
treatment option in this setting.

Treatment of head and neck cancer in older patients is particularly complex, as 
they are more prone to side effects and treatment-related toxicity due to 
age-related physiological changes. Nevertheless, they should still receive care 
based on the best available standards and protocols, since alternative 
approaches may increase the risk of treatment failure and mortality. The core 
issue lies in the lack of evidence-based protocols tailored to the specific 
needs of older patients, as most clinical trials seam to focus on younger 
populations. The objective of this study was to determine the rate of patients 
over 65 years of age included in clinical trials of treatments for head and neck 
cancer. In this context, the study aims to shed light on the proportion of 
clinical evidence that can be safely extrapolated to the treatment of older 
patients with head and neck cancer. To achieve this, we analyzed the age 
distribution of patients enrolled in clinical trials cited by the National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) in the NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025: Head 
and Neck Cancers. Less than one-fourth of patients enrolled in the 
NCCN-referenced clinical trials were over 65 years of age, reinforcing concerns 
about the applicability of current protocols to this population. To address this 
gap, the most effective strategy is to promote the generation and dissemination 
of evidence-based data that actively includes older adults worldwide.

BACKGROUND: Phase I trials represent the initial step in the clinical evaluation 
of a new drug or new drug combination. The main characteristics and designs of 
phase I trials have changed throughout the years to better support the 
development of drugs with different specificities compared with traditional 
chemotherapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed early-stage investigator-initiated clinical 
trials conducted by the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) within 
the last 20 years at a patient and clinical trial level. For efficacy analysis, 
patients were grouped into advanced/metastatic solid tumors, nonadvanced solid 
tumors, and lymphoma.
RESULTS: The study included 295 patients from 20 clinical trials. Systemic drug 
combinations were the most common treatment modality (39.3%), followed by 
multimodal treatments (29.8%) and monotherapy (24.7%). Dose-limiting toxicities 
were observed in 8.8% of patients [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.8% to 12.6%]. 
Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 60.3% of patients (95% CI 54.5% to 66.0%), 
most frequently in those receiving combinations (74.1%). No treatment-related 
deaths were observed. In advanced solid tumors, the overall response rate was 
25.8% (95% CI 18.4% to 34.4%), with a median progression-free survival of 5.8 
months (95% CI 4.8-8.0 months) and an overall survival of 1.5 years (95% CI 
1.2-2.2 years). Nonadvanced solid tumors demonstrated a median progression-free 
survival of 78.8 months, while overall survival was not reached (NR) (95% CI 
62.3-NR months). The overall response rate in lymphoma patients was 81.3% (95% 
CI 67.4% to 91.1%), with a median progression-free survival of 30.8 months and 
an overall survival was NR (95% CI 10.8-NR months).
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the safety profile, efficacy outcomes, and 
diversity of treatments in SAKK-conducted phase I trials, providing valuable 
insights into the investigator-initiated early clinical trials landscape in 
Switzerland.

BACKGROUND: The paradigm of molecular negative hyperselection, beyond RAS and 
BRAF, identifies metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with the greatest 
benefit from anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) agents. We 
hypothesize that applying this model to stage III colon cancer (CC) might 
identify a subgroup deriving benefit from anti-EGFRs in the adjuvant setting.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used a 'simplified PRESSING panel' grouping genomic 
alterations related to anti-EGFR primary resistance in mCRC, to select the 
proficient mismatch repair or microsatellite stable (pMMR/MSS) population of the 
randomized phase III PETACC-8 clinical trial, testing adjuvant FOLFOX ± 
cetuximab in resectable stage III CC. Patients without any tumor alterations in 
RAS/BRAF, or the simplified PRESSING panel were defined as 'hyperselected' (HS), 
whereas those with at least one such alteration were considered 'gene altered' 
(GA).
RESULTS: Of 1421 eligible patients, 536 (37.7%) were HS and 885 (62.2%) GA. HS 
patients were more frequently male, with distal tumor of lower stage and grade. 
HS patients showed improved 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) (81% versus 68%) 
and overall survival (OS) (89% versus 77%) as compared with GA patients. A 
statistically significant interaction was observed for RFS between molecular 
profile and treatment (P = 0.05). Among HS patients, adding cetuximab to FOLFOX 
yielded a 5-year RFS of 83% versus 78% with FOLFOX alone [hazard ratio (HR) 
0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-1.19, P = 0.28]. Adding distal tumor 
location further improved the HR to 0.72 (P for interaction = 0.03). No 
significant interaction for OS was observed. In GA patients, the addition of 
cetuximab to FOLFOX was detrimental for RFS and OS.
CONCLUSIONS: HS was prognostic for RFS and OS in patients with resected stage 
III pMMR/MSS CC and associated with a trend toward improved RFS with the 
addition of cetuximab to adjuvant FOLFOX. Conversely, cetuximab seems 
detrimental in patients with GA tumors. These data may help to improve patient

Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women, 
driving the need for novel therapeutic agents. Here, we report an integrated in 
silico-in vitro screening pipeline to identify natural products with anticancer 
activity against key breast cancer targets. A library of 187,119 commercially 
available natural compounds from the ZINC database was subjected to molecular 
docking against five proteins implicated in breast tumorigenesis: mutant 
PIK3CA-E545K, overexpressed ESR1, mutant ERBB4-Y1242C, overexpressed EGFR, and 
overexpressed ERBB2. The top 15 compounds (C1-C15) were selected based on 
binding affinity and commercial availability, then evaluated for cytotoxicity in 
breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, SK-BR-3) and a normal fibroblast 
line (CCD-1064Sk). Several hits (most notably C3-C7 and C10) demonstrated potent 
binding (affinities ≤ -8.6 kcal/mol) with favorable selectivity indices 
(SI ≥ 2.0). A clear correlation between more negative docking scores and 
enhanced cytotoxicity supported the predictive value of our virtual screen. 
Structure-activity relationship analysis highlighted planarity and hydrophobic 
substituents as key drivers of activity. These findings validate our hybrid 
approach and identify promising natural-product leads for further preclinical 
evaluation in breast cancer models.

Novel thiazole derivatives 6, 7, 8 were designed and synthesized by 
cyclocondensation of compound 2 with 2-bromo-1-arylethan-1-one. This study 
focuses on the synthesis and characterization of the Cs/PAAC nanogel loaded with 
compounds 2, 6, 7 and 8. Their zeta potential values which remained negative 
-2.7, -6.3, -7.9 and - 3.9 mV respectively indicated their nanogel stability. 
Derivatives 2, 6, 7, 8 and their nanogels were examined against HCT-116, MCF-7, 
A549 and HepG2 using sorafenib and erlotinib as reference cytotoxic drugs. 
Generally, derivative 8 exhibited the highest anticancer activities while 
derivative 2 exhibited the lowest activities on the tested cell lines. 
Derivatives 8, 6 and 7 presented the uppermost cytotoxicity against HepG2 with 
IC50 = 6.35, 7.05 and 7.15 μM, consistently. The delivery nanogels considerably 
augmented our compounds cytotoxicity. Compound 8 nanogel enhanced cytotoxicity 
with decreased IC50 by 34.65 % (HepG2), 34.35 % (A549), 28.57 % (MCF-7) and 
32.43 % (HCT116). Similarly, compound 7 nanogel improved anticancer activities 
with decreased IC50 by 32.17 % (HepG2), 30.61 % (A549), 26.01 % (MCF-7) and 
26.54 % (HCT-116). Moreover, compound 6 nanogel enhanced cytotoxicity, with 
decreased IC50 by 31.91 % (HepG2), 29.80 % (A549), 26.47 % (MCF-7) and 26.88 % 
(HCT116). Additionally, cytotoxicity of 8, 7, 6, 2 and their nanogels were 
identified against VERO normal cells with IC50 = 25.55-37.10 μM. Also all 
products were assessed for dual inhibition of VEGFR-2 and EGFRT790M. Compounds 
8, 6, 7 and their nanogels revealed very good inhibitions of VEGFR-2 at 
IC50 = 0.90-1.20 μM. As well, they highly inhibited EGFRT790M at 
IC50 = 0.25-0.50 μM. Furthermore, our compounds showed good in silico calculated 
ADMET profile.

PURPOSE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks effective therapeutic 
targets, leading to poor prognosis. Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is overexpressed in TNBC 
and associated with tumor progression. This study aimed to develop a theranostic 
pair of 68Ga-/177Lu-labeled DOTA-conjugated octapeptide (DOTA-ANXA2-8mer2) for 
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and targeted radionuclide therapy 
(TRT) of ANXA2-positive TNBC.
METHODS: Two ANXA2-targeted radiotracers-DOTA-ANXA2-8mer1 and DOTA-ANXA2-8mer2 
were synthesized and labeled with 68Ga and 177Lu successfully. A series of cell 
assays was performed to identify the binding affinity and ANXA2 specificity in 
vitro. PET imaging, SPECT imaging, and biodistribution studies were performed to 
evaluate the pharmacokinetics in breast cancer animal models. The cancer 
treatment efficacy of 177Lu-DOTA-ANXA2-8mer2 was evaluated in 4T1 tumor-bearing 
mice.
RESULTS: The dimer exhibited high radiochemical purity, stability, and strong 
affinity for ANXA2. In vitro cell uptake studies showed that the radiotracers 
effectively targeted ANXA2 in 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, and 
68Ga-DOTA-ANXA2-8mer2 showed the highest targeting efficacy. In the MDA-MB-231 
tumor model, PET/CT imaging showed that 68Ga-DOTA-ANXA2-8mer2 was taken up at 
higher rates than 68Ga-DOTA-ANXA2-8mer1, and it exhibited favorable 
pharmacokinetics and safety profiles. 68Ga-DOTA-ANXA2-8mer2 was thus selected 
for subsequent clinical trials. PET imaging showed specific tumor uptake of 
68Ga-DOTA-ANXA2-8mer2 in ANXA2-positive xenografts (4.44 ± 0.21 %ID/g at 1 h), 
significantly reduced by blocking. Treatment with 177Lu-DOTA-ANXA2-8mer2 
(11.1 MBq) suppressed tumor growth (397.77 ± 63.72 mm3 vs. 1644.92 ± 192.56 mm3 
in controls, p < 0.001) and prolonged survival (median survival: 41.2 vs 
26.8 days in controls; p < 0.001). SPECT and biodistribution confirmed 
tumor-selective accumulation. No significant hematological or organ toxicity was 
observed. Immunohistochemistry revealed reduced ANXA2, CD31, and Ki-67 
expression post-therapy.
CONCLUSION: Two ANXA2-targeted radiotracers have been developed and evaluated in 
vitro and in vivo. The ANXA2 dimer exhibits satisfactory ANXA2-binding affinity 
and specificity, along with favorable in vivo pharmacokinetics. The 
68Ga-/177Lu-DOTA-ANXA2-8mer2 theranostic pair enables non-invasive 
ANXA2-targeted PET imaging and effective TRT in TNBC models with minimal 
toxicity, supporting its clinical potential for precision management of 
ANXA2-positive breast cancer.

OBJECTIVE: International guidelines recommend exercise-based rehabilitation in 
advanced cancer, however planning and implementation of rehabilitation is 
complex. Through engagement with people with metastatic breast cancer, clinical 
and academic physiotherapists, multidisciplinary team members and health service 
managers, we explored the intervention elements and the implementation planning 
of a primary care, exercise-based cancer rehabilitation intervention.
DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Using a World Café and interpretive description 
design, we held two workshops. In workshop one (n = 9), the Template for 
Intervention Description and Replication checklist was used to identify 
intervention components. In workshop two (n = 23), the Practical, Robust 
Implementation and Sustainability Model guided implementation planning. Written 
data were collected using whiteboards. Discussions were audio-recorded, 
transcribed and analysed by two authors.
RESULTS: Workshop one highlighted the need for physiotherapists with oncology 
training to deliver individually-tailored, primary care-based interventions. 
Workshop two added that the role of physiotherapists with specialist oncology 
training would be to coordinate the delivery of adaptable interventions in an 
integrated manner, across care settings to respond to evolving needs of people 
with metastatic breast cancer, which include managing disease symptoms and 
treatment side-effects, and improving and maintaining quality of life and 
independence. Key implementation elements recommended include: evidence-based 
assessment and treatment; careful monitoring of patient and service outcomes; 
appropriate governance structures; service sustainability through ongoing 
training and supervision of physiotherapists, and oncologist support.
CONCLUSIONS: A primary care, exercise-based cancer rehabilitation intervention 
requires physiotherapists with specialist oncology training to coordinate and 
provide an adaptable, integrated interventions that respond to needs of people 
with metastatic breast cancer. CONTRIBUTION OF THE PAPER.

BACKGROUND: Population-based data from real-world sources on metastatic breast 
cancer (mBC) patient outcomes by HER2 status are limited, particularly in 
Canada. To meet this need, we examined treatment patterns, outcomes, and 
healthcare resource utilization in HER2-positive (HER2+) mBC in a real-world 
Canadian setting.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective longitudinal cohort consisted of all 
patients in Alberta, Canada diagnosed with de novo metastatic or recurrent HER2+ 
breast cancer between 2010 and 2019. Patient data were obtained from the 
provincial cancer registry, electronic medical records, and other administrative 
databases.
RESULTS: 758 patients with HER2+ mBC were included, of which 461 (60.8 %) were 
recurrent cases. Taxane + trastuzumab + pertuzumab was the most frequent (61.7 
%) first-line regimen, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) was the most frequent (74.8 
%) second-line regimen, and capecitabine + lapatinib was the most frequent (52.9 
%) third-line regimen. Median overall survival from first-, second-, and 
third-line chemotherapy was 41.9 months (95 % CI: 36.9-51.2), 18.8 months (95 % 
CI: 15.4-24.3), and 12.9 months (95 % CI: 11.0-16.8), respectively, with no 
meaningful differences between de novo and recurrent patients.
CONCLUSION: Uptake of guideline-recommended regimens in each line of therapy was 
lower in recurrent patients although survival was similar to de novo patients. 
These findings highlight the need for consensus on treatment regimens for de 
novo and recurrent HER2+ patients, effective first-and second-line management, 
and novel therapies to improve outcomes. MICROABSTRACT Our study evaluated 
real-world treatment patterns, clinical outcomes, and healthcare utilization in 
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (mBC) in Alberta, Canada. Among 758 
patients, survival was similar between new diagnoses and recurrent cases, 
despite lower uptake of guideline-recommended therapies in recurrent patients. 
Our findings highlight the need for consensus on treatment strategies and novel 
therapies to improve mBC outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Metabolite lactic acid is closely related to the metabolism and 
polarization of macrophages in cancers. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), the 
core regulator of ferroptosis driven by lipid peroxidation and iron 
accumulation, has been reported as an oncogene in colon cancer. This study 
explored the role of lactic acid in GPX4-mediated ferroptosis and macrophage 
polarization in colon cancer.
METHODS: Cell proliferation and apoptosis were respectively detected by CCK-8, 
EdU and flow cytometry. Ferroptosis markers were assessed by assay kits, qRT-PCR 
and Western Blot. Mitochondrial dysfunction was measured by JC-1 assay. 
Bioinformatics tools analyzed the correlation between GPX4 and immune cell 
infiltration. qRT-PCR and flow cytometry analyzed macrophage polarization. A 
tumorigenic model was constructed in nude mice, followed by histopathological 
analyses.
RESULTS: Lactic acid promoted cell proliferation, inhibited cell apoptosis, and 
suppressed ferroptosis, while Erastin exerted the opposite effects and reversed 
the in vitro impacts of lactic acid on the proliferation, apoptosis and 
ferroptosis in CRC cells. The suppressive role of lactic acid on cell apoptosis 
and ferroptosis was also restored by GPX4 interference, indicating that the 
functions of lactic acid in colon cancer might be mediated by GPX4-dependent 
ferroptosis. GPX4 was associated with immune cell infiltration and its knockdown 
inhibited M2 macrophage polarization that was promoted by lactic acid both in 
vitro and in vivo. The pro-tumorigenic effects of lactic acid in vivo were also 
partially abrogated by GPX4 silencing, indicating that through targeting GPX4, 
lactic acid might alter immune cell infiltration to accelerate colon cancer 
tumorigenesis.
DISCUSSION: Lactic acid was demonstrated to regulate tumor microenvironment and 
drive tumor growth in colon cancer via mediating GPX4-dependent ferroptosis. 
Targeting GPX4 and tumor metabolism could provide a new approach in anti-colon 
cancer therapies based on ferroptosis induction. However, the role of lactic 
acid needs to be verified in clinical settings and the specific regulatory 
mechanism between lactic acid and GPX4 remains to be further identified. 
Moreover, the in vivo model relies solely on subcutaneous xenografts in nude 
mice, which do not recapitulate immune-competent tumor microenvironments.
CONCLUSION: Lactic acid might regulate GPX4-mediated ferroptosis to promote M2 
macrophage polarization, contributing to tumor growth and immune escape in colon 
cancer.

BACKGROUND: Body composition is emerging as a prognostic factor in cancer, with 
metformin showing potential antitumour effects in patients with obesity and 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to determine which specific body 
composition components drive survival differences in different patient subgroups 
and explore underlying molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we analysed 1275 patients with 
confirmed NSCLC diagnosis and available chest CT imaging for body composition 
analysis at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Six body composition parameters 
(muscle density and volume, visceral adipose tissue [VAT], subcutaneous adipose 
tissue [SAT], VAT/SAT ratio, and intramuscular adipose tissue [IMAT]) were 
quantified using validated CNN-based segmentation algorithms from baseline CT 
scans. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), assessed from diagnosis 
until death or last follow-up. Associations with OS were analysed using 
multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, followed by subgroup analyses by 
sex, BMI, diabetes, and metformin use. Circulating cytokine levels (n = 93) and 
oncogenic driver mutations (n = 646) from the imaging cohort and comprehensive 
tumour mutation profiles from an independent Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer 
Center cohort (n = 5363) were analysed for mechanistic insights.
FINDINGS: Muscle volume demonstrated a dose-response relationship with OS (T2 
vs. T1: HR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65-0.94; T3 vs. T1: HR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.57-0.88) 
and the effect was intensified in patients with a BMI ≥25 kg/m2 (T2 vs. T1: HR = 
0.64, 95% CI: 0.49-0.85; T3 vs. T1: HR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.41-0.77) and with 
diabetes (T2 vs. T1: HR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39-0.97; T3 vs. T1: HR = 0.50, 95% CI: 
0.30-0.84). Higher SAT volume (T2 vs. T1: HR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.26-0.88; T3 vs. 
T1: HR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.21-0.83) and IMAT (T2 vs. T1: HR = 0.52, 95% CI: 
0.28-0.97; T3 vs. T1: HR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.22-0.82) predicted prolonged OS 
specifically in patients who have used metformin. Genomic analysis revealed that 
KRAS mutation was significantly enriched in patients with higher SAT, VAT and 
BMI ≥25 kg/m2 while EGFR mutation was enriched in patients with lower SAT, IMAT 
and BMI <25 kg/m2.
INTERPRETATION: Higher muscle volume consistently predicts improved survival in 
patients with NSCLC, with enhanced effects in patients with elevated BMI or 
diabetes. Increased adipose tissue components benefit only metformin users, 
suggesting drug-specific metabolic interactions. Our work demonstrates the 
clinical utility of detailed body composition and suggests opportunities for 
personalised treatment approaches based on comprehensive body composition 
profiles rather than BMI alone.

OBJECTIVE: Uterine cancer has no routine screening. Early diagnosis requires 
timely/appropriate evaluation of symptoms - most commonly postmenopausal 
bleeding (PMB). We examined initial place of care for PMB and its association 
with uterine cancer stage at diagnosis.
METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database 
with linked American Medical Association Physician Professional Data, we 
identified 15,443 patients aged ≥66 with uterine cancer who presented with PMB. 
Initial place of care was categorized as: office visit to an 
obstetrician/gynecologist, office visit to a physician of another specialty, or 
emergency department (ED) visit. Multivariable regressions were used to analyze 
the relationship between patient characteristics, initial place of care, and 
stage at diagnosis.
RESULTS: Mean age of patients in the sample was 74.5 and 83.1 % were 
non-Hispanic White. 61.0 %, 27.8 %, and 11.2 % of patients had their first PMB 
claim filed from an office visit to an obstetrician/gynecologist, an office 
visit to a physician of another specialty, and an ED visit, respectively. Their 
median (10th-to-90th percentile) duration from first PMB claim to uterine cancer 
diagnosis was 20 (0-134), 32 (6-169), and 14 (0-92) days, respectively 
(P < 0.001). Patients whose first PMB claim was from an ED visit were more 
likely to have advanced stage cancer (e.g., adjusted OR [95 % CI] for having 
distant stage = 1.44 [1.16-1.80] compared to obstetrician/gynecologist visits 
and 1.31 [1.04-1.66] compared to other physician visits).
CONCLUSIONS: Initial place of care for PMB was associated with duration to 
diagnosis. Patients using ED as initial place of care tended to have more 
advanced uterine cancer.

OBJECTIVE: Estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) platinum-resistant recurrent 
epithelial ovarian cancer (PROC) patients following second-line platinum-based 
chemotherapy failure face the dilemma of limited therapeutic options. We aimed 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of letrozole plus anlotinib for these 
patients.
METHODS: We conducted a single-arm phase 2 study (NCT04720807) evaluating 
letrozole plus anlotinib in ER-positive PROC patients following second-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy failure. Patients received oral anlotinib 10 mg 
daily (days 1-14, q21d) and continuous oral letrozole 2.5 mg. Treatment was 
continued until disease progression, death, intolerant toxicity, or patient 
withdrawal. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) according 
to RECIST version 1·1 and the GCIG criteria.
RESULTS: Between January 2021 and December 2023, 30 patients were assessed for 
eligibility, and 27 patients were enrolled. The median age was 62 years (range 
50-79). Seven patients achieved a partial response, while no patients showed a 
complete response, resulting in an ORR of 25·9 % (95 % CI, 11·8 %-46·6 %). The 
disease control rate was 74·1 % (95 % CI, 53·4 %-88·1 %). The median 
progression-free survival was 4·57 months (95 % CI, 4·07-9·66). Most adverse 
events were Grade 1-2 and manageable. Patients with a primary platinum-free 
interval exceeding 6 months, lower baseline CA-125 levels (<500 IU), or higher 
ER expression levels (≥ 25 % stained positive for ER) showed a statistically 
significant treatment benefit.
CONCLUSION: The combination of letrozole plus anlotinib demonstrated promising 
efficacy and manageable toxicity in the treatment of ER-positive PROC patients 
following second-line platinum-based chemotherapy failure.

OBJECTIVE: Although rare, malignant ovarian germ cell tumors (MOGCTs) account 
for 70 % of ovarian malignancies in women younger than 30 years. Given the 
rarity of MOGCTs and the limited population-based data, this study aims to 
examine national treatment patterns and survival in women with MOGCTs, with a 
focus on fertility-sparing surgery.
METHODS: This nationwide population-based study included all women (≥18 years) 
diagnosed with MOGCTs 2008-2022 in the Swedish Quality Register for Gynecologic 
Cancer. Main outcome was 5- and 10-year survival. Cox proportional regression 
models were used in univariable and adjusted survival analyses.
RESULTS: The study population included 184 women: 43 with dysgerminomas and 141 
with non-dysgerminomas (including 59 immature teratomas, 33 teratomas with 
malignant transformation, 27 yolk sac tumors, and 22 other subtypes). All but 
one of the women underwent primary surgery; 54 % had fertility-sparing surgery, 
and no residual disease was achieved in 89 %. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given to 
53 %. During a median follow-up of 5.6 years (range 0.1-15 years), 18 women 
died. No deaths occurred in women with fertility-sparing surgery. Ten-year 
relative survival was 95 % (95 % CI 88-103) and overall survival 88 % (95 % CI 
82-93). Older age at diagnosis was associated with poorer survival (per year: HR 
1.09, 95 % CI 1.05-1.14, p < 0.001), as was FIGO stage IV versus stage I (HR 58, 
95 % CI 13-265, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: MOGCTs had excellent survival outcomes in this nationwide 
population-based study, and fertility-sparing surgery was deemed safe. Future 
efforts should focus on improving outcomes in older women and those with stage 
IV disease.

BACKGROUND: Limited data exist comparing direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) with 
warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and cancer.
OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the comparative safety and 
efficacy of DOACs versus warfarin in AF patients with cancer.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of 5 electronic databases identified studies 
comparing DOACs with warfarin in this patient population. The primary outcomes 
assessed were ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, major hemorrhage, and 
mortality. Secondary outcomes included myocardial infarction, any hemorrhage, 
intracranial hemorrhage, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Analysis was conducted 
using RevMan 5.4, with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) 
calculated.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies (3 randomized controlled trials, 11 cohort studies) 
were included. Patients with AF and cancer treated with DOACs had significantly 
lower odds of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.67-0.90, p = 
0.001), major hemorrhage (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.70-0.86, p < 0.00001), and mortality 
(OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.69-0.82, p < 0.00001) compared to warfarin. DOACs also showed 
significantly lower odds of myocardial infarction (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.58-0.94, p 
< 0.01), intracranial hemorrhage (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.68-0.81, p < 0.00001), and 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.69-0.98, p = 0.03). There was no 
significant difference in the overall risk of any hemorrhage (OR 0.94; 95% CI 
0.81-1.10, p = 0.46).
CONCLUSIONS: DOACs demonstrated lower rates of ischemic stroke, systemic 
embolism, and major hemorrhage compared with warfarin in AF patients with 
cancer. Future research should focus on the relative efficacy of DOACs across 
cancer subtypes and stages.

To address the persistent challenges associated with prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) screening, a multicenter study was conducted to evaluate whether urinary 
microRNAs, in combination with the free-to-total PSA (f/tPSA) ratio, could 
improve prostate cancer (PCa) detection while minimizing unnecessary biopsies. 
The study included 307 men divided into three groups: 112 with confirmed PCa, 98 
diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and 97 healthy controls 
(HCs). Researchers measured serum PSA levels, inflammatory markers, and five 
urinary extracellular vesicle-derived miRNAs: miR-21-5p, miR-141-3p, miR-205-5p, 
miR-375, and miR-222-3p The analysis revealed distinct patterns of miRNA 
expression in the samples. The levels of miR-21-5p and miR-375 were 
significantly elevated in patients with PCa compared to those in the BPH and 
control groups (P < 0.001), whereas that of miR-205-5p was markedly reduced (P < 
0.001). The f/tPSA ratio demonstrated superior discriminatory ability compared 
to standard PSA testing, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.829. However, 
integrating multiple biomarkers, including miR-21-5p, miR-375, free-to-total PSA 
ratio, PSA density, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, further enhanced 
diagnostic accuracy. This combined model outperformed conventional approaches, 
yielding an AUC of 0.947 (95 % CI: 0.923-0.971) with 92.9 % sensitivity and 88.7 
% specificity (P < 0.001). Notably, it exhibited exceptional performance within 
the PSA ""gray zone"" (4-10 ng/mL), a range where traditional screening methods 
often lead to diagnostic uncertainty and difficult biopsy decisions.

PURPOSE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) offer durable responses in lung 
cancer patients lacking actionable mutations or with resistance to prior 
therapies. However, predicting their efficacy and associated immune-related 
adverse events (irAEs), such as severe pneumonitis, remains a clinical 
challenge. This study investigated the predictive value of positron emission 
tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)-derived metabolic parameters for 
pneumonitis and other irAEs in lung cancer patients treated with ICIs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 151 patients with advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received ICIs as first-line treatment, 
either as monotherapy or in combination. Pre-treatment PET/CT was used to 
measure SUVmax at the primary tumor, tumor-uninvolved peripheral lung, and 
metastatic sites. Pneumonitis and irAEs were assessed using clinical and 
radiological findings.
RESULTS: Pneumonitis, severe pneumonitis (grade ≥3), and irAEs occurred in 
26.5%, 19.9%, and 37.1% of patients, respectively. A peripheral SUVmax cutoff of 
>1.1 significantly predicted pneumonitis (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.720, p 
<0.001). High peripheral SUVmax was associated with higher rates of pneumonitis 
(42.9% vs. 12.3%, p <0.001), severe pneumonitis (31.4% vs. 9.9%, p=0.001), and 
irAEs (46.4% vs. 29.5%, p=0.038). In multivariate analysis, high peripheral 
SUVmax independently predicted pneumonitis (odds ratio [OR]: 4.621; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.868-11.431; p=0.001), severe pneumonitis (OR: 2.848; 
95% CI: 1.043-7.779; p=0.041), and irAEs (OR: 2.509; 95% CI: 1.114-5.504; 
p=0.022).
CONCLUSION: Baseline peripheral SUVmax on PET/CT may serve as a noninvasive 
biomarker for predicting immune-related pneumonitis and other irAEs in NSCLC 
patients receiving ICIs, supporting early risk identification.

PURPOSE: In Taiwan, head and neck cancer (HNC) ranks among the five most 
prevalent cancers in men. HNC tumours can impair the patient's ability to ingest 
food following treatment, which may lead to cachexia. Currently, in Taiwan, no 
study has investigated the association between the risk of cachexia and the 
patients' clinical characteristics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analysed data from the 
cancer registry database of Show-Chwan Memorial Hospital between 2021-2022. We 
evaluated 115 patients who underwent initial treatment and assessed the presence 
of cachexia 6 months after treatment. Clinical data were collected and compared 
between patients with cachexia and those without cachexia to explore the 
associated risk factors in the HNC population.
RESULTS: In the database, oral cancer constituted the primary diagnosis for 70% 
of cases. According to pathological assessments, most patients presented with 
locally advanced disease and moderate tumour differentiation. No correlation was 
observed between patient-reported complications, risk behaviours, and the 
incidence of cachexia. Notably, patients who underwent concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy exhibited a 3.8-fold higher risk of developing cachexia.
CONCLUSION: Concurrent chemotherapy is the leading risk factor of 
treatment-induced cachexia. The results of this study could help clinicians 
manage this issue adequately and devise solutions to limit its incidence.

INTRODUCTION: Angiogenesis inhibition is an effective therapeutic strategy for 
patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Natural products serve as 
critical sources of antiangiogenic inhibitors. Betula platyphylla Suk (birch 
bark) is a Chinese medicine that can clear heat, detoxify, relieve cough and 
resolve phlegm. This herb has attracted increasing attention because of its 
antitumor effects. Betulin is a crucial active ingredient of Betula platyphylla 
Suk and has been shown to have antitumor effects through the induction of 
apoptosis and ferroptosis. However, its antiangiogenic effect remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the antiangiogenic of betulin in 
NSCLC and elucidate the underlying mechanism.
METHODS: Endothelial cell, pericyte, aortic ring, chorioallantoic membrane, 
zebrafish and xenograft models were used to evaluate the antiangiogenic effect 
of betulin. RNA- sequencing, RT-qPCR, and western blotting were employed for 
target validation. RNA stability assays, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation-PCR, 
luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were 
performed to explore the underlying mechanism.
RESULTS: Betulin obviously suppressed tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth in 
both lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous carcinoma models. Further research 
revealed that betulin suppressed angiogenesis by inhibiting N6-methyladenosine 
of paired box 2 (PAX2) mRNA and subsequently reducing PAX2 mRNA stability. 
Betulin also dissociated PAX2 from the VEGF-A promoter and subsequently reduced 
VEGF-A expression, leading to the blockade of VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that betulin is a novel angiogenesis inhibitor 
with potential clinical application for NSCLC therapy. Our study also suggested 
that PAX2 is a potential therapeutic target for tumor angiogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Peritoneal metastasis (PM) is the predominant mode of gastric cancer 
(GC) dissemination in patients. The underlying mechanisms remain incompletely 
understood, and therapeutic interventions are highly challenging. The preemptive 
interventions of GCPM is particularly important.
PURPOSE: This study investigated the role and mechanism of galectin-1 within the 
GC microenvironment in promoting PM and evaluated the inhibitory effects of 
dihydroartemisinin(DHA) on galectin-1-induced PM.
METHODS: Through immunohistochemical analysis of clinical samples, database 
mining, and animal model experiments utilizing lentivirus-transfected GC cells, 
we investigated the promoting effect of galectin-1 on GCPM. Transcriptomic 
analysis was conducted to identify potential pathways through which galectin-1 
facilitates GCPM, with subsequent validation performed using clinical specimen 
analysis and both in vitro and in vivo experimental approaches. IC50 of DHA on 
GC cell lines with LGALS1 overexpression was determined via CCK8 assay. The 
inhibitory effect of DHA on galectin-1-induced GCPM, along with its underlying 
mechanism, was further confirmed through in vitro experiments and in vivo animal 
model interventions. Finally, molecular docking assay was employed to 
investigate the preliminary mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of DHA on 
galectin-1.
RESULTS: Galectin-1 functions as a key regulatory factor in GCPM and has a 
significant impact on patient outcomes. It promotes ferroptosis resistance in GC 
cells by activating the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, thereby 
facilitating PM. Moreover, DHA has been shown to target this signaling pathway, 
effectively inhibiting galectin-1-induced ferroptosis resistance and PM.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this study is the first to elucidate the mechanism 
by which galectin-1 promotes PM through enhancement of ferroptosis resistance 
and to explore the potential of DHA as an inhibitor of this process, thus 
providing novel strategies for preventing GCPM.

Mismatch repair deficiency or microsatellite instability (dMMR/MSI-H) is an 
established biomarker in early-stage colon cancer and metastatic colorectal 
cancer. However, its prognostic significance in early-stage rectal cancer 
patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy remains uncertain. We aimed to fill 
this gap by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available 
evidence. PubMed, Embase and Scopus were systematically searched from inception 
to 11/03/2025 for studies comparing the outcome of dMMR/MSI-H and MMR 
proficient/microsatellite stable (pMMR/MSS) rectal cancer patients treated with 
neoadjuvant therapy. Studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors were excluded. Data 
on pathologic complete response (pCR), pathologic tumor regression grade (pTRG), 
disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were extracted. Pooled 
odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with their 95 % confidence interval 
(95 % CI) were calculated using a random effects model. After screening 705 
records, 26 retrospective studies were included, the majority of patients being 
treated with long-course chemoradiotherapy. There was a significant association 
between dMMR/MSI-H status and pCR (OR 1.50 [95 % CI: 1.04-2.14]; p = 0.03), 
while no association was found for pTRG (OR 0.77 [95 % CI: 0.44-1.34]; 
p = 0.326), DFS (HR 1.00 [95 % CI: 0.50-2.01]; p = 0.998) and OS (HR 1.42 [95 % 
CI: 1.00-2.01]; p = 0.051). Despite the limited data, subgroup analyses did not 
appear to reveal any significant difference by type of neoadjuvant treatment. In 
conclusion, patients with dMMR/MSI-H rectal cancer treated with standard 
neoadjuvant therapy are more likely to achieve a pCR than those with pMMR/MSS 
tumors.

BACKGROUND: Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), a bioactive saponin from Astragalus 
membranaceus, demonstrates strong anti-tumor effects across various cancers by 
modulating circular RNAs (circRNAs).
METHODS: Utilizing gene microarray analysis, we identified circ_0124787 as the 
most abundantly expressed circRNA in ovarian carcinoma tissues. ELISA assays 
showed that the secretion of IL-1β was significantly increased in the 
supernatants of SKOV3 and ID8 ovarian cancer cell lines which overexpressing 
circ_0124787. As a pivotal pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1β enhances γδT17 cell 
proliferation and amplifies inflammatory signaling, which promotes the tumor 
progression. TargetScan predicted miR-6875-3p as a putative target of 
circ_0124787, and this prediction was validated by dual-luciferase reporter 
assays. Functional studies demonstrated that circ_0124787 acts as a competitive 
endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by sponging miR-6875-3p, thereby derepressing its 
downstream effector IL-1β. Critically, inhibition of miR-6875-3p completely 
abolished the anti-tumor efficacy of AS-IV, thereby establishing the 
indispensability of this circRNA-miRNA axis for its therapeutic activity.
RESULTS: Our results describe a novel AS-IV/circ_0124787/miR-6875-3p/IL-1β 
pathway that can decrease the proportion of γδT17 cell to suppress ovarian 
cancer.

Conventional CAR-based immunotherapy has demonstrated promising efficacy in 
hematological malignancies. However, the inherently low transduction efficiency 
of viral vectors in innate immune cells, particularly natural killer (NK) cells, 
represents a significant barrier to the broader application of CAR-based 
immunotherapies. To overcome these limitations, in this study, we developed a 
nonviral platform, recombinant chimeric antigen receptor fusion protein 
(CliCAR), that rapidly converts immune cells into CAR-expressing cells without 
gene editing. CliCAR protein was rapidly internalized and localized to the cell 
membrane of NK cells, allowing it to exhibit CAR-like functions without genetic 
modification. As a result, CliCAR-NK cells exhibited selective cytotoxicity 
against HER2-positive cancer cells and enhanced immune activation, including 
increased levels of IFN-γ, perforin, and granzyme B. In vivo experiments, 
CliCAR-NK cells significantly suppressed HER2-positive tumor growth without 
observable toxicity in a xenograft model, supporting its therapeutic potential. 
Through this study, we introduce the CliCAR system as a novel protein-based CAR 
expression strategy that eliminates the need for genetic engineering and viral 
vector-mediated delivery. The ability to confer CAR function without gene 
editing provides a safe, rapid, and customizable strategy to produce potent, 
off-the-shelf immune cell therapies applicable to a broad range of tumor types, 
including solid tumors.

Quantitative assessment of treatment response in Advanced Prostate Cancer (APC) 
with bone metastases remains an unmet clinical need. Whole-Body 
Diffusion-Weighted MRI (WB-DWI) provides two response biomarkers: Total 
Diffusion Volume (TDV) and global Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (gADC). 
However, tracking post-treatment changes of TDV and gADC from manually 
delineated lesions is cumbersome and increases inter-reader variability. We 
developed a software to automate this process.&#xD;&#xD;Approach: Core 
technologies include: (i) a weakly-supervised Residual U-Net model generating a 
skeleton probability map to isolate bone; (ii) a statistical framework for 
WB-DWI intensity normalisation, obtaining a signal-normalised b=900s/mm² (b900) 
image; and (iii) a shallow convolutional neural network that processes outputs 
from (i) and (ii) to generate a mask of suspected bone lesions, characterised by 
higher b900 signal intensity due to restricted water diffusion. This mask is 
applied to the gADC map to extract TDV and gADC statistics. We tested the tool 
using expert-defined metastatic bone disease delineations on 66 datasets, 
assessed repeatability of imaging biomarkers (N=10), and compared software-based 
response assessment with a construct reference standard, defined as 
multidisciplinary consensus based on ≥12 months of imaging, clinical, and 
laboratory follow-up (N=118).&#xD;&#xD;Main results: Average dice score between 
manual and automated delineations was 0.6 for lesions within pelvis and spine, 
with an average surface distance of 2mm. Relative differences for 
log-transformed TDV (log-TDV) and median gADC were 8.8% and 5%, respectively. 
Repeatability analysis showed coefficients of variation of 4.6% for log-TDV and 
3.5% for median gADC, with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.94 or 
higher. The software achieved 80.5% accuracy, 84.3% sensitivity, and 85.7% 
specificity in assessing response to treatment. Average computation time was 90s 
per scan. &#xD;&#xD;Significance: Our software enables reproducible TDV and gADC 
quantification from WB-DWI scans for monitoring metastatic bone disease 
response, thus providing potentially useful measurements for clinical 
decision-making in APC patients&#xD.

Breast cancer is one of the most significant cancers affecting women. The link 
between smoking and breast cancer development, along with its effects on 
treatment, needs further investigation for clear validation. Our previous study 
using breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models revealed that 
prolonged nicotine exposure accelerates HER2-positive tumor progression and 
reduces trastuzumab efficacy. In this study, RNA sequencing of nicotine-exposed 
PDX tumors revealed the 50 most altered differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 
with PPI networks analyzed via STRING. Higher fibronectin (FN1) expression in 
cancer cells is linked to worse survival in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) 
patients (**p < 0.01). To investigate the effects of nicotine on aggressive 
breast cancer, our study utilized the TNBC-PDX and MDA-MB-231 cell models. Our 
results revealed that prolonged nicotine exposure promoted tumor growth, 
increased FN1 protein levels, enhanced cell adhesion and metastasis-related 
proteins, and diminished the efficacy of Cisplatin. Our previous research 
emphasized the therapeutic potential of natural compounds in combating 
nicotine-induced breast cancer. Prolonged nicotine (10 mM) exposure for 17 
generations (p17), followed by 24-hour treatment with 15 μM Inotilone, reduced 
FN1 protein expression and significantly inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell migration 
(**p < 0.01). To validate the tumor-suppressive effects of Inotilone and its 
inhibition of nicotine-induced FN1 overexpression beyond TNBC cells, we utilized 
a HER2 + HCC-1954 breast cancer xenograft model in NSG mice, which showed 
significantly reduced tumor growth upon intraperitoneal Inotilone treatment 
(40 mg/kg every four days) compared to controls (**p < 0.01). In conclusion, 
Inotilone demonstrates promise as an adjunctive therapy for breast cancer by 
effectively downregulating FN1 expression and mitigating tumor progression 
associated with prolonged nicotine exposure in vivo.

PURPOSE: Despite medical advancements, early-stage breast cancer continues to 
impose significant emotional, physical and psychosocial strain on women. 
Understanding their evolving experiences and needs across the cancer trajectory 
is critical for developing culturally sensitive, patient-centered interventions 
to enhance quality of life.
METHODS: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted with 20 women diagnosed 
with Stage 0-IIIA breast cancer who had completed curative-intent treatment. 
Participants were purposively recruited from an outpatient oncology clinic in a 
public hospital. Semi-structured interviews, guided by Lazarus and Folkman's 
stress and coping model, were conducted between August 2021 and August 2022. 
Qualitative data were analyzed thematically, and descriptive statistics 
summarized participant characteristics.
RESULTS: Four core themes emerged: (i) Initial Reactions to Diagnosis and 
Treatment Decisions, (ii) Psychosocial and Physical Burdens of the Cancer 
Experience, (iii) Multidimensional Support Systems, and (iv) Inner Strength and 
Transformative Coping. Participants reported distress at diagnosis, evolving 
informational and emotional needs, and significant reliance on emotion- and 
meaning-focused coping. Cultural and religious beliefs shaped treatment 
decisions and adjustment. Fear of recurrence, body image concerns, and periods 
of social withdrawal were common but rarely disclosed to clinicians. Family 
involvement in decision making was notable, reflecting collectivist values.
CONCLUSION: Women with early-stage breast cancer in Singapore face complex and 
evolving psychosocial challenges shaped by sociocultural context. Healthcare 
professionals should provide timely, tailored information and integrate 
psychosocial support across the cancer trajectory. Recognizing cultural values, 
supporting patient autonomy, and involving family appropriately can enhance 
person-centered and culturally responsive cancer care.

PURPOSE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesise existing 
evidence of the effectiveness of Computerised Cognitive Training (CCT) in 
enhancing cognitive functions and quality of life (QOL) in cancer survivors with 
Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI).
METHODS: Eight electronic (CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, 
ProQuest Social Science Database, Web of Science) and four grey literature 
databases were searched from inception till December 31, 2023. Two reviewers 
independently screened and extracted data before appraising the risk of bias and 
the overall quality of findings. Meta-analyses, sensitivity and subgroup 
analyses were carried out using the RevMan 7.2.0 Software. Cochrane GRADE 
assessed the overall quality assessment.
RESULTS: Ten randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 949 participants were 
included. The meta-analyses revealed that CCT was statistically significant, 
with small effect sizes for improving executive function at follow-up 
(standardised mean difference (SMD) = 0.26, 95 % CI [0.11, 0.41], P = 0.0008), 
working memory post-intervention (SMD = 0.25, 95 % CI [0.08, 0.43], P = 0.003), 
and working memory at follow-up (SMD = 0.30, 95 % CI [0.14, 0.46], P = 0.0003).
CONCLUSIONS: CCT exhibited effectiveness in enhancing executive functions (at 
follow-up) and working memory in Cancer Survivors with CRCI, highlighting its 
potential as a valuable addition to standard care pathways in oncology settings. 
Future research should explore expanding CCT delivery to platforms such as 
mobile phones and tablets to provide critical insights into optimising CT 
interventions to enhance user engagement.

PURPOSE: To examine the pathways between activity behaviors, emotional distress, 
and subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) in middle-aged and older breast cancer 
patients (BCs) receiving chemotherapy.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, patients were recruited via convenience 
sampling at a tertiary hospital in Guangzhou, China. SCI, depressive symptoms, 
anxiety symptoms, physical activity, and sedentary behavior were assessed using 
the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function, the 10-item 
version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the Brief 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and the short form of the International 
Physical Activity Questionnaire. Structural equation modelling was conducted to 
test a hypothesized path model with depressive and anxiety symptoms as 
mediators.
RESULTS: A total of 356 BCs (mean age = 54.07 years) were included. Depressive 
symptoms showed a strong association with higher SCI (β = 0.441, P < 0.001). 
Physical activity showed an indirect association with lower SCI through reduced 
depressive symptoms (β = -0.079, 95 %CI: -0.146 to -0.031). Physical activity 
was also negatively related to anxiety symptoms (β = -0.113, P < 0.05). After 
excluding anomalous cases, anxiety symptoms were additionally found to be 
significantly associated with SCI (β = 0.142, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the potential relevance of depressive 
symptoms in the experience of SCI among middle-aged and older BCs receiving 
chemotherapy. The observed indirect association suggests that patients with low 
physical activity levels may warrant particular attention, as they may be at 
greater risk for depressive symptoms and cognitive complaints. Further 
interventional studies are needed to examine the potential benefit of physical 
activity for emotional well-being and SCI in this population.

PURPOSE: Cytotoxic drugs (CDs) pose considerable occupational health risks to 
oncology nurses due to their carcinogenic, genotoxic, and teratogenic 
properties. This study investigates the prevalence of CD-related symptoms among 
German oncology nurses and assesses the implementation of safety measures in 
clinical practice.
METHODS: A mixed-methods, cross-sectional survey was conducted among 400 
oncology nurses attending 14 CD safety training courses in Germany. Quantitative 
data captured demographics, symptom prevalence, and workplace safety measures, 
while qualitative data were derived from open-ended questions on specific 
exposure events. Descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis 
(Mayring method) were applied.
RESULTS: One-third (33.75 %) of nurses reported symptoms attributed to CD 
handling, mainly skin reactions (51.58 %), headaches (41.48 %), and altered 
taste sensations (28.15 %). Qualitative data revealed that exposure mainly 
occurred during CD administration (35 %) and was linked to improper management 
(56 %), especially through defective or incorrectly handled infusion systems. 
Protective measures were inconsistently applied: while 80.47 % of institutions 
had SOPs, 64.12 % provided safety training, no site implemented all recommended 
measures. Only 60.42 % of the nurses used cytotoxic-proof gloves; other PPE 
components were rarely used. Subgroup analyses indicated that nurses with 
CD-related symptoms were more likely to work in settings with fewer technical 
and organizational safeguards.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights critical gaps in CD safety protocols in German 
oncology practice. Inadequate training, insufficient technical controls, and 
inconsistent PPE use contribute to occupational exposure risks. Enhancing 
protective strategies, promoting a strong safety culture, and improving 
institutional accountability are essential to safeguard oncology nurses and 
reduce CD related health risks.

PURPOSE: To assess the implementation of Digital Therapeutics in the care of 
cancer patients and survivors by synthesising the best available evidence 
regarding their efficacy in improving health outcomes compared to usual care or 
placebo control groups.
METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, a comprehensive search of 
literature published between 2018 and 2023 was conducted in PubMed, Embase, 
Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, WHO Publications, 
ISRCTN, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomised controlled trials published in 
English were eligible for inclusion if they employed Digital Therapeutics to 
treat adult cancer patients and survivors. Two independent reviewers conducted 
the database searches, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment according to 
Cochrane's guidelines. Meta-analyses were conducted using the RevMan Web 
software. This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO CRD42023491190.
RESULTS: Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. Digital Therapeutics 
demonstrated a significant reduction in fear of cancer recurrence (SMD = -0.43, 
p < 0.00001) and in fatigue (SMD = -0.23, p = 0.0005). Additionally, there was a 
significant reduction in Depression (SMD = -0.37, p < 0.00001) and Anxiety 
(SMD = -0.32, p = 0.0002) symptoms, along with significant improvements in 
Quality of Life (SMD = 0.23, p = 0.002) from Digital Therapeutics use. No 
publication bias was detected.
CONCLUSION: Given their benefits, the continued development of Digital 
Therapeutics for cancer patients and survivors is warranted. Future research 
should explore the geographical and socio-demographic influences on the 
accessibility of such interventions to meet the diverse needs of cancer 
populations worldwide.

As a key regulatory enzyme in mitochondria, YME1L is crucial for regulation of 
mitochondrial dynamic balance and metabolic plasticity in tumors. Yet its role 
in non-small cell lung cancer (NACLC) and underlying mechanism are still 
unclear. In this study, we found YME1L was highly expressed at both protein and 
RNA levels in NSCLC tissues, which was consistent with the result of database 
analysis. The bioinformatics analysis also showed that YME1L expression 
negatively correlated with survival rate. The significance of YME1L was 
investigated through gain- and loss-of-function studies in vivo and vitro. As 
expected, the protease activity was consistent with the expression of YME1L. 
Knockdown of YME1L significantly inhibited mitochondrial activity, proliferation 
and migration of NACLC cell lines, and suppressed the growth of xenografted 
tumors in nude mice. While over-expression of YME1L promoted the development of 
tumors. Further study revealed that YME1L increased the proportion of S-phase 
and reduced the number of G0/G1 ratio in NSCLC cells, suggesting the strong 
proliferation activity. Mechanically, knockdown of YME1L decreased the 
expression of Gαi1 and the phosphorylation of Akt, and on the contrary, YME1L 
over-expression increased the Gαi1 expression and Akt activation, which in turn 
stimulated cell proliferation, migration and survival, and promoted the 
progression of NSCLC. In this study, we revealed that YME1L played a novel 
oncogenic role in promoting NSCLC tumorigenesis and progression via the 
mitochondria-Gαi1-AKT axis, providing a new target for the treatment of lung 
cancer.

In pursuit of novel therapeutic strategies for complex multifactorial diseases 
such as cancer, a set of isatin hydrazone/1,2,3-triazole hybrids was rationally 
designed and synthesized to target multiple cancer-related pathways, including 
COX-2, VEGFR-2, and tumor-associated carbonic anhydrases (CA IX and XII). In 
vitro COX-2 inhibition assays revealed eight hybrids with nanomolar potency 
(IC50 = 50-90 nM), comparable to celecoxib, with compounds 5h and 5j exhibiting 
comparable selectivity indices to celecoxib. For VEGFR-2 inhibition, compound 5f 
surpassed sunitinib (IC50 = 64 vs. 92 nM), while 5j retained ∼75 % of its 
activity. Compounds 5f, 5j, and 5l were potent and selective inhibitors of hCA 
IX (Kᵢ = 27.3-37.2 nM). Cytotoxicity screening identified 5h and 5j as the most 
active against MCF7, A549, Caco-2, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines 
(IC50 = 1.3-12.49 μM) with good safety in normal WI-38 cells. Mechanistic 
studies on 5j indicated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction via 
upregulation of Caspase-9 and Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2. Compound 5j was 
also subjected to additional cell-based evaluations, including wound-healing, 
cell viability assays under hypoxic conditions, and PGE2 quantification, which 
further supported its multi-target profile. The in vitro human plasma stability 
of compound 5j was confirmed, exhibiting a half-life (t1/2) of approximately 
7 h. In vivo, 5j significantly reduced tumor growth in an MDA-MB-231 xenograft 
model, comparable to 5-FU. Docking simulations confirmed favorable interactions 
with COX-2, VEGFR-2, and hCA IX, supporting the observed biological activities.

For the development of anticancer drugs, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) 
has become an attractive target. With superior binding affinity and cytotoxic 
effects, dimeric molecules exhibit greater anti-tumor efficacy than monomers, 
positioning them as promising candidates for next-generation anticancer drugs. 
In this investigation, the pharmacological skeleton of active molecules as 
PARP-1 inhibitors served as the basis for the design and synthesis of a series 
of thiosemicarbazone dimers, and their anticancer properties were assessed. 
Compound 13, one of the dimers, exhibited nanomolar activity against PARP-1 
(IC50 = 64.98 ± 2.46 nM) and inhibited the growth of BRCA mutant cells, 
especially the BRCA1 mutant breast cancer HCC-1937 cell line 
(IC50 = 0.88 ± 0.21 μM). The mechanism study demonstrated that compound 13 
inhibited PAR formation, induced PARP-1-DNA trapping, and DSBs on 
HCC-1937 cells. The flow cytometry analysis's findings showed that compound 13 
caused HCC-1937 cells to enter a G2/M phase arrest. It has also been shown that 
compound 13 triggers apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In vivo 
studies showed a reduction in the growth of HCC-1937 xenografts following 
treatment with compound 13, with an acceptable safety profile. In conclusion, 
compound 13 demonstrated favorable preliminary activity, especially those that 
have BRCA mutations.

Traditional proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have emerged as a powerful 
strategy in cancer therapy by selectively degrading tumor-associated proteins, 
thereby inhibiting tumor proliferation and metastasis. However, their clinical 
translation remains limited due to challenges such as off-target effects, low 
cellular uptake, and insufficient tumor penetration. To address these 
limitations, light-activated PROTACs have been developed by integrating the 
spatiotemporal precision of phototherapy with conventional PROTACs. The 
photo-switchable PROTACs and photocaged PROTACs allow precise activation in 
tumor tissues while minimizing toxicity to healthy cells. Light-activated 
PROTACs not only precisely control the release of PROTACs but also 
synergistically treat tumors in conjunction with phototherapy. These innovations 
significantly reduce off-target effects and enhance therapeutic specificity. 
Here, we outline the mechanisms of light-activated PROTACs systems and review 
therapeutic strategies that utilize light-activated PROTACs in conjunction with 
PROTAC for tumor treatment. These systems not only exert anti-tumor effects by 
stimulating reactive PROTAC, but their combination with phototherapy, which 
presents a promising approach that could overcome current limitations and may 
advance the clinical application of PROTAC-based cancer therapies.

Ovarian cancer is a highly lethal gynecological malignancy that poses a 
significant threat to women's health. Current treatments for patients with 
clinical recurrence and drug resistance are limited, underscoring the urgent 
need for new therapeutic strategies. SIRT2, one subtype of sirtuin protein 
family, has been shown to promote tumor cell proliferation, migration, and 
invasion by regulating multiple signaling pathways through deacetylation. In 
this study, we discovered that knockdown of SIRT2 significantly inhibited the 
migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells. To develop targeted therapies, 
we designed and synthesized a series of SIRT2-targeted PROTACs based on the 
small molecule inhibitor Tenovin-6. These PROTACs exhibited potent SIRT2 
degradation capability and significant anti-proliferative activity in several 
ovarian cancer cell lines. Among them, W10 demonstrated the most potent 
anti-proliferative activity both in vitro and in vivo, with an IC50 value of 
0.08 ± 0.04 μmol/L and a selectivity index (SI) of 33.00. W10 significantly 
suppressed clonogenic formation and migration, induced cell cycle arrest, and 
promoted apoptosis. Mechanistically, W10 inhibited the AKT/mTOR signaling 
pathway by indirectly degrading SIRT2 and blocking downstream protein 
phosphorylation, thereby disrupting the signaling cascade and suppressing tumor 
development.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a highly metastatic oral cancer subtype is 
associated with a poor prognosis, chemoresistance and low survival rate. Failed 
clinical outcomes by conventional chemotherapeutic drugs have proposed chemokine 
receptor inhibitors as novel chemotherapeutic agents. CXCR2, a key 
pro-inflammation regulator supporting cell proliferation, metastasis, and 
chemoresistance, is overexpressed in OSCC. Autophagy plays a dual role during 
cancer progression. At the late stage of OSCC, autophagy facilitates cell 
survival and chemoresistance. Under chemotherapeutic stress, polyploidization of 
tumour cells leads to the formation of polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) that 
help in tumour relapses and metastasis. The present work is focused on the 
rational design and development of a fluorinated squaramide-based CXCR2 
inhibitor as a chemotherapeutic agent against OSCC. Cell-free IL-8 receptor 
binding assay and computational analysis, along with cell-based protein 
expression analysis, projected compound 5 as a potent CXCR2 inhibitor. 
Mechanistically, compound 5 mediated CXCR2-Ca2+ signalling inhibition halted 
autophagic flux; subsequently facilitating ROS-mediated apoptotic cell death. In 
addition, compound 5 downregulated the CXCR2-NLRP3 canonical inflammation 
signalling. Moreover, compound 5 primed CAL27 cells exhibited enhanced 
chemosensitization towards cisplatin. Furthermore, compound 5 induced 
autophagy-dependent cell death in drug-resistant OSCC-derived PGCCs. Preliminary 
in vivo pharmacokinetic studies have also marked its safety for further 
pre-clinical application, indicating compound 5 as the hit CXCR2 inhibitor 
against OSCC. The outcomes of our investigation revealed the synthesis and 
screening of a potent fluorinated squaramide-based CXCR2 inhibitor as a robust 
next-generation chemotherapeutic agent for personalized and precision oncology 
with an insight into OSCC treatment.

BACKGROUND: Although the use of telehealth has declined since the pandemic, it 
remains a popular mode of care delivery across the cancer care continuum. 
Understanding telehealth in the context of cancer care is essential, as its 
benefits and challenges may differ among diverse population groups and 
geographic areas.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine patterns of telehealth utilization across 
the cancer care continuum and to identify factors associated with the receipt of 
telehealth in a large patient population. This study also aimed to assess the 
telehealth's impact on key health care delivery outcomes.
METHODS: We used an annualized retrospective cohort design using patient data 
from the Johns Hopkins Health System (JHHS), a large regional academic health 
center in Maryland. The study analyzed electronic health record (EHR) data 
covering the period from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2023. Chronic 
conditions were defined through the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG) 
System, which identifies comorbidities based on the International Classification 
of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification, codes in the electronic 
health record. In addition, we used publicly available geospatial data (eg, 
internet connectivity, rural-urban commuting area) to assess telehealth receipt 
associations. Statistical modeling, including generalized estimating equations, 
was used to evaluate variations in telehealth utilization and outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 124,974 adult patients receiving cancer-related care at 
Johns Hopkins Health System were identified during the study period. Telehealth 
users were significantly older (52.2% aged ≥65 years, 19,942 patients) compared 
to nonusers (48.7%, 42,209 patients). In addition, these users were more likely 
to be male (45.4%, 17,365 patients vs 40.2%, 34,839 patients) and to identify as 
White (70.8%, 27,071 patients vs 64.7%, 56,122 patients). Telehealth users also 
had a higher prevalence of comorbidities, with 61.5% (23,503 patients) reporting 
3 or more chronic conditions compared to 38.0% (33,000 patients) among nonusers. 
A positive correlation was noted between rural-urban commuting area codes and 
telehealth service utilization (ρ=0.36; P<0.05), indicating higher usage in more 
rural areas. Conversely, average maximum download and upload speeds showed an 
inverse relationship with telehealth utilization (ρ=-0.22; P<0.05; and ρ=-0.34; 
P<0.05, respectively). Adjusted analyses indicated that concurrent telehealth 
use was associated with reduced odds of emergency department visits (0.916, 95% 
CI 0.884-0.948) and hospitalizations (0.830, 95% CI 0.799-0.863), acknowledging 
the potential influence of residual confounding.
CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth has emerged as a crucial mode of care delivery for 
patients with complex conditions such as cancer. Understanding usage patterns 
and factors influencing telehealth across the cancer care continuum, including 
geographic barriers, is vital to optimizing its implementation and ensuring 
health care systems meet the diverse needs of patients with cancer in a 
value-based care environment.

Psychological trauma is a universal experience among humans; when suffered 
during developmental ages it might affect development and be at the base of 
psychopathology. Having a parent diagnosed with cancer is a highly distressing 
experience for a child and may influence the development of future 
psychopathology. This PRISMA-adhering systematic review focused on studies of 
children with a parent diagnosed with cancer and reporting psychiatric diagnoses 
or clinically significant symptoms assessed with validated instruments. The 
review included 25 studies spanning from 1994 to 2025. Studies found increased 
prevalence of anxiety, depressive, and posttraumatic stress disorder in children 
and adolescents with a parent affected by cancer compared to controls. 
Internalizing problems were higher than externalizing problems in children and 
adolescents, especially girls. There have been few implemented programs for 
children with a parent with cancer, despite recognition of higher 
psychopathological risk. The few psychotherapeutic trials yielded results with 
small effect sizes, while there is a dearth of pharmacological trials that does 
not allow drawing conclusions. There is need to prioritize programs that take 
care of children with parents with cancer so to reduce future psychopathology. 
Psychotherapeutic interventions must target the internalizing and externalizing 
symptoms and address the posttraumatic aspects of the child's suffering.

PURPOSE: Quantifying changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) during treatment 
can rapidly identify patients responding to therapy, but accurate interpretation 
requires an understanding of variability in ctDNA levels in the absence of 
treatment. This analysis of 360 patients with advanced epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) characterized ctDNA 
level changes in paired pretreatment samples and evaluated factors associated 
with variability.
METHODS: Screening and cycle 1, day 1 (C1D1) pretreatment samples from 132 
previously untreated and 228 previously treated patients in the FLAURA and AURA3 
trials, respectively, had ctDNA quantified using next-generation sequencing 
(Guardant360/GuardantOMNI NGS panel; mean variant allele frequency [VAF] or 
EGFR-mutant VAF) and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR, Biodesix) 
EGFR assays.
RESULTS: In FLAURA and AURA3, ≥20% reductions in ctDNA levels (panel mean VAF) 
from screening to C1D1 occurred in 31/132 (23.5%) and 43/228 (18.9%) patients 
with paired pretreatment plasma samples, respectively, including ≥50% reductions 
in 12 (9.1%) and 23 (10.1%) patients, and 100% reductions (ctDNA clearance) in 0 
and 5 (2.2%) patients. Background variability was not fully accounted for by 
intra-NGS or NGS-ddPCR technical variability or other potential sources of 
variability; larger changes were associated with low VAF and low cell-free DNA 
(cfDNA) input.
CONCLUSION: Intrapatient ctDNA variability over time in EGFR-mutant advanced 
NSCLC includes changes that may confound interpretation of treatment activity, 
depending on the magnitude of change used to indicate molecular response. These 
findings demonstrate that evaluation of on-treatment changes must account for 
potential background variability, including technical variability because of 
factors such as cfDNA input level and tumor-related VAF, and that baseline 
samples should be obtained as close as possible to treatment initiation to 
minimize the impact of background variability.

PURPOSE: Salivary gland cancers (SGCs) are rare and comprise multiple histologic 
entities. In the recurrent or metastatic (R/M) setting, there is limited 
evidence for effective systemic anticancer treatment for most subtypes, 
affecting prognosis and quality of life. Molecular analysis of SGCs holds 
promise to more accurately classify SGC subtypes and to determine novel 
therapeutic targets.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with R/M SGC underwent tumor biopsy and 
blood sampling to perform whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of tumor and germline as 
part of their standard-of-care management. Small somatic mutations, structural 
alterations, copy number variation, and mutational signatures were processed 
using WGS pipelines alongside germline testing. Alterations were correlated to 
clinical features and fed back to clinical team to inform treatment decisions.
RESULTS: WGS quality control was acceptable in 14 of 15 patients (adenoid cystic 
carcinoma [AdCC, n = 10], salivary duct carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma [n = 
1]; clear cell myoepithelial carcinoma [n = 1]; epithelial-myoepithelial 
carcinoma [n = 1]; and acinic cell carcinoma [n = 1]). Genomic 
rearrangements/fusions were present in 12 of 14. Rearrangements involving MYB 
and or NFIB were identified in 8 of 10 patients with AdCC. One patient harbored 
a clinically actionable FGFR1-pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 fusion and responded to 
fibroblast growth factor receptor-targeted therapy, in addition to enabling 
histologic reclassification. Other fusions included EWSR1-ATF1 and CRTC1-MAML2, 
which also aided definitive histologic classification. Small somatic alterations 
were identified in all but one patient. There were no pathogenic germline 
mutations.
CONCLUSION: WGS in SGC is achievable in clinically relevant timeframes, 
providing genomic information for deeper understanding of disease 
pathophysiology, to clarify histologic subtype and can identify actionable 
genomic targets which may not be found through routine sequencing technologies. 
Further use of WGS has the potential to improve care for patients with SGC.

PURPOSE: Precision oncology trials have generally focused on tumor testing to 
identify actionable alterations. The National Cancer Institute-Children's 
Oncology Group Pediatric MATCH trial incorporated return of germline results to 
assess feasibility of reporting in a cooperative group setting and characterize 
germline cancer predisposition in patients with refractory cancers.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor and blood DNA from patients 1-21 years of age with 
treatment-refractory solid tumors, non-Hodgkin lymphomas, or histiocytic 
disorders underwent cancer gene panel sequencing. Clinical germline reports 
returned to 151 study sites included pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) 
germline variants found in 38 cancer predisposition genes (CPGs). European 
Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) recommendations for germline follow-up of 
tumor variants in CPGs were assessed.
RESULTS: Both tumor and germline reports were completed for 1,167 patients 
(87.5% of enrolled). A total of 295 tumor reports (25%) included 361 CPG 
variants of which 70 variants (19.4%) were found in the germline sample. Three 
additional germline-only CPG variants resulted in 73 (6.3%) of 1,167 germline 
reports containing variants across 21 CPGs previously associated with pediatric 
and/or adult cancers. Among frequently mutated CPGs in tumors, concurrent 
germline findings ranged from 8/32 NF1 (25.0%) and 25/163 TP53 (15.3%) to zero 
of 27 ALK and 18 PTEN tumor variants. ESMO guidelines recommended clinical 
follow-up for 110 (30.5%) of 361 tumor CPG variants which included 40 (57.1%) of 
70 germline variants.
CONCLUSION: Coordinated germline and tumor panel testing was feasible and 
revealed P/LP CPG variants in 6.3% of the Pediatric MATCH cohort. Tumor variant 
fraction, germline association of CPG with tumor type, and adult-oriented 
guidelines were not predictive of germline status, emphasizing the need for 
systematic germline follow-up after tumor genomic testing for pediatric 
patients.

PURPOSE: This study examined the association between COVID-19 and cancer 
incidence by sex in Manitoba, Canada.
METHODS: We used a population-based quasi-experimental study design and an 
interrupted time-series analysis to compare the rate of new cancer diagnoses 
between males and females before (January 2015 until December 2019) and after 
the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020 until December 2022).
RESULTS: A total of 16,200 females and 20,631 males diagnosed with cancer 
between 2015 and 2022 in Manitoba were included. Colon cancer incidence 
decreased by 34% for males and females from April to September 2020. Incidence 
then remained stable for males but decreased by 22% from October 2021 to 
December 2022 for females. Brain and CNS cancer incidence decreased by 37% for 
males during 2021 and 2022 but only for females during the last quarter of 2020 
and the first quarter of 2021 (77%). Urinary cancer decreased by 18% for males 
from April 2020 to December 2022 but was stable for females. Head and neck 
cancers decreased by 22% for males during 2020, but was stable for females. As 
of December 2022, the largest estimated cumulative differences in the number of 
cases occurred for males diagnosed with brain and CNS cancer (31.6% deficit for 
males, 76 cases), urinary cancer (18.4% deficit, 186 cases), and endocrine 
cancer (52.4% surplus, 56 cases), and females diagnosed with colon cancer (19.7% 
deficit, 187 cases).
CONCLUSION: Sex-based differences in the association between age-standardized 
cancer incidence and the COVID-19 pandemic exist for several cancer sites. 
Sex-based differences on postpandemic cancer incidence, especially for brain, 
CNS, urinary, and colon cancers, need follow-up because of the ongoing deficits 
documented in this study.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Ischemic stroke and cancer often coexist. The aim of 
this study was to determine the prevalence of cancer among patients with stroke, 
their antithrombotic treatment patterns, and the risk of subsequent 
thromboembolic events in a large population-based cohort.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from Optum's deidentified 
Clinformatics Data Mart Database to assess the 6-month risk of recurrent 
thromboembolic and major bleeding events identified using validated 
International Classification of Diseases code algorithms, among adults with 
active cancer hospitalized with ischemic stroke between October 2020 and 
September 2021. In addition, we explored the risk of recurrent thromboembolic 
events stratified by anticoagulant exposure. Landmark analyses were undertaken 
with anticoagulant exposure status based on dispensations in the week after 
hospital discharge. Propensity score matching aimed to minimize selection bias 
between the groups. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox proportional 
hazard models with robust variance estimators to account for clustering within 
propensity score-matched pairs.
RESULTS: Among 86,365 patients identified with ischemic stroke, 10.2% had active 
cancer (most common types: 34% genitourinary, 25% gastrointestinal, 23% 
hematologic). After applying eligibility criteria, 4,781 patients were included 
in the main analysis (median age 74 [interquartile range 68-81] years; 48% 
female). Anticoagulants were dispensed to 14.7% of patients. The incidence of 
thromboembolic event recurrence and major bleeding events was 38.4 (95% CI 
35.4-41.6) and 20.9 (95% CI 18.8-23.4) per 100 person-years, respectively. After 
propensity score matching, the risk of thromboembolism recurrence was not 
statistically different between those with and without anticoagulant 
prescription (HR 1.21; 95% CI 0.91-1.61). Anticoagulant prescription was also 
not associated with a higher risk of major bleeding events (HR 1.13; 95% CI 
0.78-1.63).
DISCUSSION: In this large-scale study, approximately 10% of patients with 
ischemic stroke had active cancer and they faced a markedly elevated short-term 
risk of recurrent thromboembolism and major bleeding events. Anticoagulants were 
infrequently prescribed after discharge and did not differentially affect the 
rate of ischemic or bleeding outcomes compared with alternative treatment 
strategies, although confounding by indication is likely. Clinical trials are 
required to further assess optimal antithrombotic strategies in this high-risk 
population.

PURPOSE: Active surveillance (AS) is a standard management strategy for low-risk 
prostate cancer (PCa), but a significant proportion of patients ultimately 
experience disease progression. Metformin, a commonly prescribed antidiabetic 
agent, has demonstrated antitumor activity in preclinical studies and 
observational data, prompting investigation into its potential to delay PCa 
progression.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Metformin Active Surveillance Trial (MAST) was a 
multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial 
evaluating the efficacy of metformin in men with low-risk, localized PCa managed 
with AS. Eligible participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either 
metformin (850 mg twice daily) or placebo and were followed for up to 36 months. 
The primary end point was time to progression, defined as therapeutic and/or 
pathologic progression. Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed using 
Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: A total of 408 patients were randomly assigned (205 metformin, 203 
placebo). After a median follow-up of 36 months, 144 participants experienced 
progression (70 metformin, 74 placebo), with no significant difference in PFS 
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.09 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.52]; P = .59). Negative biopsy rates 
at 36 months were 41.0% (metformin) versus 31.1% (placebo; P = .181). In 
prespecified subgroup analysis, metformin was associated with increased 
pathologic progression among obese patients (BMI ≥ 30; HR, 2.36 [95% CI, 1.21 to 
4.59]; P = .0092).
CONCLUSION: Metformin did not reduce progression in men with low-risk PCa on AS. 
The observed adverse effect in obese patients merits further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) 
require frequent surveillance and adjuvant intravesical therapy, which may be 
less accessible in rural area. Utilizing the Stats Canada Remoteness Index (RI), 
we sought to investigate the effect of rurality/remoteness on the presentation, 
management, and surveillance of high risk NMIBC and cancer specific outcomes 
such as survival and rate of progression.
METHODS: The Canadian Bladder Cancer Information System (CBCIS) database was 
used to identify all patients diagnosed with high risk NMIBC (defined as HG Ta, 
any T1 disease, CIS) on initial transurethral resection of bladder tumor 
(TURBT). Using the manual classification method, rural areas were defined as a 
RI ≥ 0.15. Exclusion criteria included patients with non-urothelial histology, 
unknown T stage, or evidence of nodal or distant metastases at time of 
diagnosis.
RESULTS: Among 2838 high-risk NMIBC patients, 71% were urban and 30% rural. 
Rural patients were more likely than urban patients to present with high grade 
(HG) T1 tumors (42% vs. 37%, p=0.059). Repeat TURBT was performed within 90 days 
for HG T1 disease in 29% of urban and 23% of rural patients (p=0.04). Rural 
patients were less likely than urban patients to receive induction BCG (52% vs. 
69%, p<0.0001). 5-yr progression free survival to MIBC was significantly lower 
among rural patients (80% vs 85%; p=0.048).
CONCLUSIONS: Rural patients with high-risk NMIBC were significantly less likely 
to meet quality indicator benchmarks for guideline concordant surveillance and 
management, although overall rates are low indicating a potential area of 
quality improvement efforts.

The treatment paradigm of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has evolved with the 
emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Two ICI-based regimens have 
gained regulatory approval worldwide in unresectable HCC as first line treatment 
based on the IMBrave150 and HIMALAYA trial. Other regimens such as 
camrelizumab-rivoceranib and ipilimumab-nivolumab also demonstrated improvement 
in overall survival as compared to multi-targeted agents in recent phase III 
clinical trials. With the growing amount of evidence, it is imperative for 
clinicians to decide the most suitable ICI therapy for each patient based on 
their disease status and tolerability. Furthermore, ICI in combination with 
locoregional treatment such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been 
shown to prolong the progression-free survival as compared to TACE alone. In 
early-stage HCC, the role of ICI has been studied in both the adjuvant and 
neoadjuvant setting. In this narrative review, we will highlight the major 
advancement of ICI in different stages of HCC and their implication in real 
world practice. The unmet need in the special population of liver cancer 
patients and the management of immune-related hepatitis will also be addressed.

Plain Language Summary: Drug treatment of liver cancer is changing rapidly with 
a new class of medicine targeted at stimulating the immune system called 
immunotherapy. Immunotherapy in combination with another class of drug which can 
stop the blood vessel growth, is now recognized as the one of the most 
appropriate ways to treat patients with late stage liver cancer by many doctors. 
Other ways such as using two different immunotherapeutic drugs together, or 
immunotherapy plus drugs that interfere with specific targets on cells, had also 
been shown to help patients live longer than before. Research is trying to 
combine immunotherapy with a technique killing cancer cells by injecting 
chemotherapy to the blood vessel supplying the liver, which is a traditional 
method to treat intermediate stage liver cancer. In early liver cancer patients 
eligible for surgery, using immunotherapy before and after the procedure is also 
under testing, in order to lower the chance of disease coming back. There are 
also challenges associated with use of immunotherapy, for example it can cause 
side effects in which the immune system attacks normal liver cells instead of 
cancer cells. Given the drug profile of immunotherapy is complicated, doctors 
need to be familiar with the pros and cons of it when treating liver cancer 
patients.

The identification and detection of specific autophagy signaling pathways in 
live cancer cells are critical to modulate chemotherapy sensitivity in cancer 
treatments. However, conventional autophagy signaling pathway detection 
approaches are challenged by specificity and sensitivity. Here, with the 
synthesis of ZnO nanoparticle (NP)-DNA nanospheres (ZnO-DNA NSs) using 
palindromic DNA sequence scaffolds, we propose a new strategy for sensitive 
detection of a specific autophagy signaling pathway in cancer cells via 
simultaneously imaging the upstream miRNA-34a and downstream autophagy-related 
4B cysteine peptidase (ATG4B). The miRNA-34a-responsive, Zn2+-dependent I-R3 
DNAzyme (I-Dz) and ATG4B-specific peptide-DNA signal probes are integrated into 
the ZnO-DNA NSs. Upon readily being delivered into cancer cells, the acid 
microenvironment leads to the dissolution of ZnO NPs to release the Zn2+ 
cofactor for I-Dz. Subsequently, miRNA-34a and ATG4B initiated cyclic cleavage 
of the signal probes to yield distinct fluorescence for highly sensitive 
detection of miRNA-34a and ATG4B, thereby achieving specific autophagy pathway 
detection. Besides, the dynamic concentration interplay between miRNA-34a and 
ATG4B upon drug stimulation can also be monitored by the ZnO-DNA NSs to realize 
effective discrimination of drug-sensitive and -resistant cancer cells to access 
chemoresistance reversion, revealing the robust potential of ZnO-DNA NSs for 
detecting different autophagy pathways and screening potent therapeutic drugs.

Cardiac troponin I for early detection of cancer therapy-related cardiac 
dysfunction after chemotherapy: a diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis.

Lin N, Xie L, An L, Wei G.

Introduction Early myocardial injury during chemotherapy may precede declines in 
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). We assessed the diagnostic accuracy 
of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) for early detection of cancer therapy-related 
cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD). Methods We conducted a diagnostic test-accuracy 
meta-analysis of prospective cohorts measuring cTnI within 3 months after 
chemotherapy initiation following PRISMA-DTA. Searches were conducted across 
PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, and Wanfang databases through August 
2025. A bivariate random-effects hierarchical summary receiver operating 
characteristic (HSROC) model estimated pooled sensitivity and specificity with 
confidence/prediction regions; risk of bias was appraised using QUADAS-2. 
Clinical implications were illustrated with Fagan nomograms at prespecified 
pre-test probabilities (10% and 20%). Results A total of 5 prospective cohort 
studies were included. The HSROC summary operating point yielded pooled 
sensitivity 0.669 (95% CI 0.444-0.836) and specificity 0.839 (95% CI 
0.634-0.940). The corresponding positive likelihood ratio was 4.15 and negative 
was 0.39. At a 10% pre-test probability, post-test probabilities were 32% after 
a positive result and 4% after a negative result; at a 20% pre-test probability, 
they were 51% and 9%, respectively. Leave-one-out analyses indicated stable 
estimates. Conclusions Within the first 3 months of chemotherapy, cTnI shows 
moderate sensitivity and high specificity for early CTRCD detection. These 
performance characteristics support cTnI as a confirmatory biomarker to inform 
risk-stratified surveillance alongside imaging under standardized assay 
procedures.

BACKGROUND: Axillary node clearance is the current standard of care in patients 
with node-positive breast cancer undergoing primary surgery, despite a lack of 
evidence to demonstrate survival benefit and high rates of life-changing 
morbidity. Targeted axillary dissection (TAD) may be a safe alternative to 
axillary node clearance, but there is no agreement how primary TAD should be 
performed. TADPOLE-TOGETHER aimed to use international consensus methods to 
agree the key components of primary TAD to promote standardized introduction and 
evaluation of the technique within the TADPOLE trial.
METHODS: A scoping review and key stakeholder interviews were used to generate a 
longlist of possible procedure steps for inclusion in the Delphi questionnaire. 
Two rounds of an international online survey were then used to agree the 
mandatory, optional, and prohibited steps of TAD, together with any 
standardization and training required. The final approach to primary TAD was 
agreed at an online consensus meeting.
RESULTS: Thirteen potential steps of a TAD procedure were identified from the 
literature and expert interviews, together with information regarding 
standardization and training. Some 244 surgeons with global representation 
participated in the Round 1 survey, of whom 161 (66.0%) participated in Round 2. 
Seven mandatory steps of primary TAD, including localization and removal of the 
involved node, combined with a sentinel node biopsy, were agreed upon and 
ratified by 42 surgeons from the UK, Europe, and Asia who attended the consensus 
meeting.
CONCLUSION: Robust international consensus methods have been used to agree how 
primary TAD should be performed, promoting safe and transparent introduction and 
evaluation of the technique.

Organ-specific cancer risks following exposure to radiation can be explained by 
a shift of spontaneously arising cancers toward younger ages.

Hiroshima, Japan.

INTRODUCTION: Cancer risks of radiation are commonly made to evaluate an 
increase in mortality or incidence of cancers above background levels in 
subjects of the same age. However, the increased risk can also be evaluated by 
assuming a dose-dependent earlier onset expressed by a parallel shift of the 
mortality or incidence rate toward younger ages, which eventually results in 
life shortening.
METHODS: Organ-specific relative risks for cancer was estimated by assuming that 
exposure to radiation increases the risk due to tissue reactions which 
subsequently facilitate an earlier onset of naturally occurring cancers. In this 
case, the years of earlier onset X can be obtained by examining the equation 
showing that the mortality or incidence rate for all cancers at age 70 in the 
1 Gy-exposed group equals the rate at age 70 + X in the control group. In the 
present study, assuming that the X can be applied to all organs, organ-specific 
relative risk (RR)/Gy values were calculated as the ratio of the mortality or 
incidence rate at age 70 + X vs. at age 70 in the control group.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The RR/Gy values thus obtained agreed closely with the 
epidemiologically estimated RR/Gy in major organs (stomach, colon, lung, liver 
etc.) while no clear evidence for an increased risk has been observed in the 
Life Span Study of atomic bomb survivors for pancreas, gallbladder, and kidney 
although the age-related patterns for the incidence or mortality of the control 
subjects are similar to those for the major organs. Possible reasons for the 
discrepancy are discussed.

Within clinical practice, information sources such as clinical guidelines ensure 
practitioners apply evidence-based information, supporting both effectiveness 
and safety of the prescribed medicines. Paediatric cancer - a leading cause of 
death in children - is a complex condition, thus is an area where clinical 
guidelines are important to give guidance on, e.g., recommended doses, drug 
dispensing, and toxicity monitoring measures. However, exploring clinical 
guidelines/information sources and their content regarding medicine-pertaining 
aspects is rarely done despite the fact they directly inform patient care. This 
comment summarises the main findings of a document analysis study aimed to 
describe available documents and their content for Scotland-based paediatric 
prescribers in oncology wards and provides insights into the documents' 
comprehensiveness and consistency. The analysis covered three clinical 
indications which are either highly prevalent or troublesome in practice: 
emesis, tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), and Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP) 
prophylaxis.

Prior studies have shown that approximately 40% of estrogen receptor positive 
(ER+) breast cancer (BC) patients harbor immune signaling defects in their blood 
at diagnosis, and the presence of these defects predicts overall survival. 
Therefore, it is of interest to quantitatively characterize and measure 
signaling errors in immune signaling systems in these patients. Here we propose 
a novel approach combining communication theory and signal processing concepts 
to model ligand discrimination in immune cells in the peripheral blood. We use 
the model to measure the specificity of ligand discrimination in the presence of 
molecular noise by estimating the probability of error, which is the probability 
of making a wrong ligand identification. We apply our model to the JAK/STAT 
signaling pathway using high dimensional spectral flow cytometry measurements of 
transcription factors, including phosphorylated STATs and SMADs, in immune cells 
stimulated with several cytokines (IFNγ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-4, and IL-10) from 19 
ER+ breast cancer patients and 32 healthy controls. In addition, we apply our 
model to 10 healthy donor samples treated with a clinically approved JAK1/2 
inhibitor. Our results show reduced ligand identification accuracy and higher 
levels of molecular noise in BC patients as compared to healthy controls, which 
may indicate altered immune signaling and the potential for immune cell 
dysfunction in these patients. Moreover, the inhibition of JAK1/2 produces a 
unique pattern of signaling dysfunction, inducing increased ligand detection 
error rates and reduced signal-to-noise ratios for most immune cell subtypes. 
These results suggest a means to improve the use of signaling kinase inhibitor 
therapies by identifying patients with favorable ligand discrimination 
specificity profiles in their immune cells.

Global public health facing serious challenges due to the incidence of cancer 
and the growth of treatment resistance. Mer-tyrosine kinase plays a crucial role 
in cell biology and correlated with many cancers such as Epithelial ovarian 
cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, Metastatic melanoma, and Acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML). Hence the identification of novel drug for MERTK protein is 
extreme important. In this research, we used computational techniques, molecular 
operating environment (MOE 2015) for virtual screening with drug like natural 
compounds library. We used known compound UNC2025 as positive control and one 
million compounds was retrieved from different databases (OTAVA, ZINC, ChEMBL) 
and docked with MERTK protein. Out of million compounds the 4 top hit inhibitors 
chosen from docking were further screened for ADMET profiling confirming their 
compliance with drug designing and toxicological principle and subjected to 
molecular dynamic (MD) simulation and MM-PBSA analysis. The results of these 
analyses showed that only four compounds that make strong interactions with 
MERTK protein via highest binding affinity hydrogen bond and hydrophobic 
contacts (lig1, lig2, lig3, lig4). The computed binding affinity ranges from 
-22.977 to -18.707 kcal/mol. The increased helix and reduced β-sheet contents in 
MERTK on the binding of top hit candidates depicted the higher structural 
stability of MERTK, rather than MERTK alone and MERTK-UNC2025. The study finds 
critical residues which serve a vital part in binding with the inhibitor and the 
active site of the MERTK protein, i.e., Phe598, Gly599, Lys619, Arg629, Glu633, 
Glu637, Arg722, Asp723, Arg727, Asp741, Gly743, Leu744, Lys746, Arg758, Ala760, 
and Lys761 through decomposed binding free energy analysis. This study focuses 
on the pursuit of several MERTK protein targets, which could have consequences 
for the development of novel therapeutics for various cancers.

We discovered that Plakophilin 3 (PKP3) was expressed only at the apical 
membrane of duct cells in the pancreas, and its expression was induced in 
acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM), pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), 
and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. PKP3 was predominantly 
localized on the cell membrane in ADM and both in the membrane and cytoplasm in 
PanIN, while PDAC cells expressed PKP3 in the nucleus rather than in the 
cytoplasm or membrane. PKP3 expression transformed acinar cells into duct-like 
cells and promoted the malignant behavior of PDAC cells. Mechanistically, PKP3 
upregulated FOXM1 expression by inhibiting FOXM1 ubiquitylation. Genetic 
ablation of PKP3 blocked ADM formation, PanIN and PDAC. Increased PKP3 
expression predicted poor survival of patients with PDAC disease. Thus, PKP3 is 
transformed from a desmosomal protein into an oncogenic molecule that promotes 
PDAC development through FOXM1 stabilization. This PKP3-FOXM1 signaling axis is 
a potential target for intervention in early-stage PDAC.

PURPOSE: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) can be assessed on 18F-FDG PET/CT in 
oncology patients. We evaluated the proportion of oncology patients referred for 
PET/CT imaging in whom systematic CAC scoring could reclassify cardiovascular 
(CV) risk and modify primary cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention strategies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 190 cancer patients 
undergoing 18F-FDG PET/CT in oncological indications at our institution between 
June and July 2024. Data on CV risk factors, personal/family CVD history, and 
current treatments were collected. CAC scores were assessed visually and 
automatically on CT scans. Patients' CV risk was reclassified according to CAC 
scores and compared with their current lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) and 
cardiology follow-up.
RESULTS: A total of 190 subjects were analyzed (mean age 65 ± 13 years, 64% 
female, mean Framingham Risk Score 17.2 ± 9.2%). Patients were categorized as 
follows according to CAC: 24.7% (N = 47) no CAC, 36.8% (N = 70) mild, 21.6% 
(N = 41) moderate, and 16.8% (N = 32) severe CAC. Among them, 56.3% (N = 107) 
had a previous consultation with a cardiologist, 30.0% (N = 57) were on LLT, and 
6.8% (N = 13) had a history of CVD. Based on CAC scoring, 43% (N = 81) could be 
reclassified in a different CVD risk category and 49% (N = 93) required changes 
in primary CVD prevention through LLT adjustments or initiating follow-up for 
high risk of CVD.
CONCLUSION: Systematic CAC assessment on PET/CT imaging could enhance CV risk 
stratification and prevention in oncology patients.

INTRODUCTION: Electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing devices (EBVS) and 
ultrasonic devices (US) - collectively known as advanced hemostasis devices 
(AHDs) - are considered equally feasible in laparoscopic procedures. However, US 
devices have been demonstrated to be more susceptible to abnormal heat 
accumulation when activation cycles are rapidly repeated, causing results from 
laparoscopic procedures to be poorly translated to vulvar cancer surgery. In 
this study, we aimed to determine whether EBVS and US are comparable in terms of 
peri- and postoperative morbidity in vulvar cancer surgery.
METHODS: This retrospective single-center study comprised patients who underwent 
a primary vulvectomy, partial vulvectomy, or radical local resection with an AHD 
in Tampere University Hospital, Finland, in 2011-2023. Our primary outcome 
measure was the Clavien-Dindo grade, which measures the incidence and severity 
of postoperative complications in the early (30-day) postoperative period. 
Secondary outcome measures were blood loss, postoperative blood transfusions, 
operative time, the total volume of groin drain output, and length of hospital 
stay.
RESULTS: Eighty-six patients were included (EBVS n = 45, US n = 41). 
Postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grades II - V) were significantly 
less common in the EBVS group compared to the US group (60% vs 85% in the EBVS 
and US groups, respectively; p = 0.015). The difference was driven by a 
discrepancy in grade II complications (49% vs 71%), which consisted primarily of 
infections in both groups. In a multivariable regression analysis adjusting for 
the extent of surgery, the use of an EBVS device was independently associated 
with a lower likelihood of postoperative complications compared to US (aOR 0.3, 
95%CI 0.1-0.9 for EBVS vs US; p = 0.030). Both the amount of operative blood 
loss (median (IQR) 50 (45-200) ml vs 150 (88-400) ml; p = 0.005) and length of 
hospital stay (median (interquartile range) 6 (4-8) vs. 8 (6-10) days; 
p = 0.002) were lower in the EBVS group, but surgical device did not 
independently predict the highest quartile of either variable. The amount of 
postoperative blood transfusions, operative time, or groin drain output did not 
significantly differ between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The data from this study suggests electrothermal bipolar vessel 
sealing devices could reduce early postoperative complications, especially those 
related to the surgical site, in vulvar cancer surgery compared to ultrasonic 
devices. Prospective studies are needed to ensure the generalizability of the 
results.

Cancer patients admitted to intensive care unit - a six-year retrospective 
analysis.

[Article in English]

Kraft Rovere R, Pires de Souza ME, Rodrigues Chamse Ddine Y, Hilgert SF, Cidral 
DL, Efraim Stein C, De Lima SA.

BACKGROUND: Literature about critically ill cancer patients admitted to 
intensive care units (ICUs) is scarce. The decision to recommend ICU admission 
is complex and usually involves many subjective factors, making it an intricate 
issue for both medical oncologists and intensive care physicians. As oncologic 
and supportive measure treatments improve, a question that becomes increasingly 
relevant is which patients should be admitted to the ICU, as the natural history 
of cancer is clearly shifting and newer admission parameters should be 
established.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients with 
a diagnosed malignancy admitted to our ICU from 2008 to 2014. Data were 
collected from electronic medical records and analyzed to establish factors 
associated with outcomes including length of stay, complications, mechanical 
ventilation requirements, and mortality.
RESULTS: We surveyed a total of 165 consecutive patients, of which 79 (47.9%) 
were female and 86 (52.1%) were male. Patients with solid tumors (N = 93) were 
significantly older than those with non-solid tumors (N = 68) (60.12 ± 15.86 vs. 
45.43 ± 17.42 years; P &lt; 0.001). The most common reason for ICU admission was 
respiratory failure (55.76%), followed by septic shock (21.82%). Mechanical 
ventilation was strongly associated with mortality (P &lt; 0.001), with 98.2% of 
deaths occurring in ventilated patients. Complications during ICU stay were 
associated with significantly longer length of stay (P &lt; 0.001), particularly 
for patients with solid tumors.
CONCLUSION: Given the high heterogeneity of cancer patients, it is difficult to 
establish definitive guidelines for ICU admission. Our findings demonstrate that 
traditional criteria such as age or tumor type alone should not determine ICU 
admission decisions. Instead, decisions should be based on comprehensive 
clinical judgment for each individual case. Further studies are warranted to 
develop evidence-based guidelines for critically ill cancer patients.

The role of art-making as a part of treatment in women with breast cancer.

[Article in English]

Zbiňovská E, Hobzová H.

BACKGROUND: Comprehensive treatment of patients with cancer includes various 
forms of psychosocial support aimed at improving the quality of life of 
patients. Psychosocial interventions help manage psychological distress and 
physiological symptoms associated with cancer and its treatment. These 
interventions include art therapy, conducted by a qualified art therapist, and 
independent art-making, which does not require the presence of a therapist. Both 
interventions have proven to be effective ways to improve psychological and some 
physiological symptoms in patients. Current research suggests that art 
interventions enable patients to express and process their emotions, reduce 
stress, and enhance emotional well-being. Art therapy and art-making have the 
potential to significantly reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, pain, and 
fatigue in patients. Benefits are also seen in the development of coping 
strategies, strengthening feelings of control, and improving interpersonal 
relationships. Randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews confirm 
positive effects on psychological resilience and overall quality of life. 
However, research highlights the need for higher methodological quality and 
addressing heterogeneity in applied art interventions.
AIM: The aim of this paper is to present current knowledge on the effects of art 
therapy and independent art-making on psychological and physiological symptoms 
in cancer patients. The work focuses on identifying the therapeutic potential of 
these interventions and evaluating their impact on patients' quality of life. 
Our intention is to contribute to a deeper understanding of the effects of 
art-making in the context of psycho-oncological care and to support its 
implementation into treatment strategies.

OBJECTIVE: Distant metastasis (DM) of gastric cancer (GC) represents a 
significant health challenge due to its high mortality rates, necessitating 
advancements in early detection and management strategies. The objective of this 
study was to create a machine learning (ML) model that is interpretable for 
preoperative prediction of DM in GC.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 1,009 GC patients, of which 769 were from 
Zhejiang Cancer Hospital as development cohort and 240 from Zhejiang Provincial 
Hospital of Chinese Medicine as external test cohort. Nine clinical features, 
and four composite indices derived from ten laboratory indicators were selected 
as candidate features. The dataset was balanced using the borderline Synthetic 
Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and the Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN) 
under-sampling method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to 
identified key metastasis-related features. Based on the identified features, we 
developed predictive models incorporating five ML algorithms, with performance 
evaluated via receive operating characteristic (ROC) curves, recall, 
precision-recall (PR) curves. Ultimately, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) 
analysis were applied to rank the feature importance and explain the final 
model.
RESULTS: Univariate and multivariate analyses identified five metastasis-related 
features: cT stage, cN stage, differentiation grade, PLR and TMI. Logistic 
Regression emerged as the optimal predictive model with the highest area under 
the curve (AUC) of 0.942 (95% CI: 0.922-0.962), Recall of 0.895 (95% CI: 
0.843-0.947), and AUPRC of 0.889 (95% CI: 0.867-0.911) among five models. 
Additionally, the internal and external test cohorts recorded AUC values of 
0.935 (95% CI: 0.897-0.972) and 0.879 (95% CI: 0.833-0.926), respectively. The 
SHAP analysis revealed the features that played a significant role in the 
predictions made by the model.
CONCLUSION: This ML model integrates clinical features and composite indices to 
predict GC metastasis risk, supported by an online tool to guide preoperative 
decision-making.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze risk factors of nodal (N) metastases in patients 
undergoing video-assisted mediastinal lymphadenectomy (VAMLA).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Results and clinical efficiency of video-assisted 
mediastinal lymphadenectomy (VAMLA) were analyzed between August 2020 and 
December 2024. There were 110 patients. The median of age was 65 years. Men 
prevailed (90:20). Central cancer was detected in 33 (32.4%) patients. More than 
half of patients (62.7%) had squamous cell cancer.
RESULTS: Change of clinical stage was noted in 58 patients (52.7%) (decrease - 
46 (41.8%), increase - 12 (10.9%) cases). Among 55 patients who underwent 
PET/CT, false-positive result was detected in 30 (54.5%), false-negative result 
- in 4 (7.3%) patients, coincidence of stage - in 21 (38.2%) patients. 
Predictors of metastases were clinical and anatomical form of tumor, 
histological type of tumor and standardized uptake value (SUV) of mediastinal 
lymph nodes. After multivariate analysis, we created prognostic model with high 
discriminatory ability.
CONCLUSION: Clinical and anatomical form of tumor, histological type and SUV of 
mediastinal lymph nodes have the highest prognostic significance regarding 
N-metastases of NSCLC. After large-scale studies and clinical validation of 
prognostic model, these data will clarify the indications for invasive staging 
based on risk factors and reduce the number of diagnostic interventions.

INTRODUCTION: Pesticides are recognized endocrine disruptors that may influence 
breast cancer risk and progression, yet their impact on disease characteristics 
according to menopausal status remains unclear, particularly in rural 
populations with high exposure levels. This study aimed to evaluate the impact 
of pesticide exposure on the clinicopathological profile of breast cancer among 
rural women, with a focus on differences between premenopausal and menopausal 
patients.
METHODS: A cohort of 189 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer at a cancer 
hospital in southwestern Paraná State, Brazil, was retrospectively analyzed. 
Pesticide exposure was determined through a validated questionnaire, classifying 
women as exposed or unexposed. Menopausal status was recorded from medical 
charts and categorized as premenopausal or menopausal. Clinicopathological 
features were compared across groups.
RESULTS: Pesticide-exposed premenopausal patients presented more cases of low 
histological grade tumors than unexposed women did (46.28% vs 23.14%, 
respectively, p = .0081). Additionally, more exposed patients had angiolymphatic 
emboli (15.22% to unexposed and 47.83% to exposed, p = .0170). Patients exposed 
at menopause had more tumors without estrogen receptor expression (13.16% 
unexposed and 28.95% exposed, p = .022) and a lower ki67 index (23.08%) than 
unexposed patients (6.15%, p = .0055), with a prevalence of tumors larger than 
2 cm (11.82% unexposed and 21.82% exposed, p = .0481). A multivariable 
regression analysis was performed and showed both age (β = 0.03698, 95% CI: 
-1.013 to 1.108) and BMI (β = 0.1293, 95% CI: -0.5552 to 0.8120) had no 
significant effects. Conclusion: These findings suggest that chronic pesticide 
exposure during critical windows of breast development may alter disease 
presentation according to menopausal status. Given the high pesticide burden in 
a rural cohort, it is important to consider environmental exposures in breast 
cancer prognosis, especially among vulnerable populations.

Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) for patients with rectal cancer is intended to reduce 
the risk of local recurrence and distant metastasis while preserving quality of 
life. Choosing the optimal approach after NAT is complex, requiring a 
personalized plan that considers the unique characteristics of each patient and 
their tumor, as well as the resources and capabilities of the treating 
institution. Advances in treatment, guided by insights from randomized clinical 
trials and increasing acceptance of organ preservation strategies, also known as 
nonoperative management or the watch-and-wait approach, emphasize the importance 
of precise treatment response assessment and multidisciplinary communication. A 
comprehensive evaluation using digital rectal examination, endoscopy, and MRI 
with a dedicated rectal cancer protocol ensures accurate clinical and 
locoregional response assessment. This integrative approach enables clinicians 
to make decisions regarding organ preservation, surgery, treatment 
de-escalation, or even additional NAT, with MRI having a critical role in 
surgical planning when resection is needed. The authors provide a comprehensive 
guide for interpreting postneoadjuvant rectal cancer MRI and applying the 
Society of Abdominal Radiology Colorectal and Anal Cancer Disease-focused Panel 
(SAR DFP) synoptic MRI restaging report template. The aim is to improve the 
quality, consistency, and clarity of MRI interpretations across different 
readers and institutions. Each section corresponds to the SAR DFP synoptic MRI 
restaging report template, addressing common areas of confusion and providing 
essential background material to ensure that clinically relevant information is 
clearly communicated to the treatment team, supporting effective decision making 
and enhancing patient outcomes. ©RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available

Bladder cancer is a common malignancy with high rates of recurrence and 
progression. Chemotherapy is employed at various stages of treatment to improve 
patient outcomes and survival; however, it is sometimes ineffective and often 
associated with significant side effects. Moreover, growing evidence suggests 
that chemotherapy may paradoxically enhance tumor invasiveness and metastatic 
potential in certain cancer types. These concerns underscore the need to better 
understand the impact of chemotherapy and to develop personalized prognostic 
strategies for managing bladder cancer. Here, we present an organoid biosensing 
platform designed to evaluate chemotherapy-induced effects in a patient-specific 
manner. Freshly isolated tumor organoids and self-assembled microtumors derived 
from transurethral resection of bladder tumors are cultured within a 
tumor-on-gel biomimetic microenvironment. By integrating live single cell 
nanobiosensors with 3D time-lapse microscopy, the platform enables real-time 
detection of molecular biomarkers and rapid assessment of tumor invasiveness. We 
demonstrate the platform's capability to evaluate cisplatin-induced invasion in 
bladder cancer organoids at the individual patient level. These findings 
highlight the potential of this organoid biosensing system to investigate 
patient-specific risks of chemotherapy-induced invasion and to guide more 
personalized approaches to bladder cancer treatment.

Breast cancer is still a major global health issue and calls for innovative 
approaches for both early detection and effective treatment. Because of their 
distinct optical characteristics, biocompatibility, and ease of surface 
functionalization, carbon nanodots (CANDs), a novel class of carbon-based 
nanomaterials, have become effective agents in cancer nanomedicine. This review 
comprehensively explores the synthesis, physicochemical characteristics, and 
functionalization strategies of CANDs relevant to oncological applications. The 
review entails their mechanisms of action, including cellular uptake, tumor 
microenvironment (TME) modulation, and reactive oxygen species generation. CANDs 
offer remarkable potential in breast cancer diagnosis through fluorescence 
imaging, photoacoustic and MRI enhancement, and biosensing, with advances toward 
point-of-care diagnostics. Therapeutically, CANDs serve as carriers for drug, 
gene, and siRNA delivery, and enable modalities such as photothermal, 
photodynamic, and chemo-phototherapy, with emerging applications in 
immunotherapy. Additionally, theranostic systems integrating diagnostic and 
therapeutic functionalities are highlighted. The review also addresses clinical 
progress, patents, and translational challenges while projecting future 
directions involving AI and hybrid nanodots, paving the way for next-generation 
breast cancer management.

INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity 
and mortality worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting 
for > 85% of cases. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has played an integral 
role in NSCLC management, particularly in combination with chemotherapy. 
Although the safety and efficacy of TCM injections have been widely studied, 
comprehensive pharmacoeconomic evaluations remain limited.
AIM: This review aimed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness 
of five TCM injections, Marsdenia tenacissima, Aidi, Kanglaite, Kangai, and 
Shenqi Fuzheng, in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced 
NSCLC.
METHOD: A systematic literature review identified 165 randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) published between 2000 and 2024. A Bayesian network meta-analysis 
(NMA) was performed to compare the objective response rates (ORR) and adverse 
events (AEs) among the five TCM injections plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy 
alone. A decision tree model with a 6-month time horizon was constructed from 
the healthcare system perspective, incorporating direct medical costs, including 
drug administration, monitoring, and AE management. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated based on incremental ORR 
improvements. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to 
test the robustness of the model.
RESULTS: All five TCM injections combined with chemotherapy demonstrated 
superior ORR compared with chemotherapy alone. Kanglaite injection showed the 
highest ORR improvement (12.5%) and lowest incidence of leukopenia and hepatic 
dysfunction. However, Kangai injection exhibited the lowest ICER of $19.56 per 
1% ORR gain, indicating the highest cost-effectiveness. The ICERs for the 
remaining regimens were $43.38 (Marsdenia tenacissima), $29.68 (Aidi), $56.94 
(Kanglaite), and $28.08 (Shenqi Fuzheng) per 1% ORR. Sensitivity analyses 
confirmed the robustness of these findings, with ORR and injection costs 
identified as the key drivers.
CONCLUSION: Among the five TCM injections evaluated, Kangai injection combined 
with chemotherapy has emerged as the most cost-effective regimen for advanced 
NSCLC. These findings support the integration of TCM into evidence-based cancer 
care, and highlight the need for further pharmacoeconomic research, particularly 
in real-world clinical settings.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review explores the use of perioperative immunotherapy 
for early-stage non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), highlighting key recent 
developments in the field, questions that remain, and perspectives on their 
future use.
RECENT FINDINGS: Immunotherapy has seen a recent expansion of its use to 
earlier-stage settings, previously limited to advanced/metastatic cancers, with 
widespread regulatory adoption of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) into the 
perioperative setting of resectable early-stage (IB-IIIA) NSCLC. However, 
questions remain regarding the efficacy of different drug regimens, their 
duration and scheduling, and, in particular, combinations with other therapies. 
The use of ICIs alongside molecularly targeted therapy has prompted 
well-evidenced concerns around toxicity and efficacy, with focus shifting to 
alternative strategies. Promising findings are seen with the revolutionary use 
of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) in various cancer fields, prompting growing 
interest and a number of trials investigating their use, including combined with 
immunotherapy, within lung cancer. While promising as a therapy, the full 
potential of perioperative immunotherapy still remains to be realised, to be 
aided by further research into optimisation of treatment regimens and 
combinatorial strategies.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer globally, 
with 25-30% of patients eventually developing liver metastases (CRLM). These 
metastases worsen prognosis, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary 
management. Within multidisciplinary teams (MDTs), radiologists do more than 
interpret images, facilitating accurate staging, resectability assessment, and 
therapy guidance. This systematic review assesses radiologists' impact and 
advanced imaging's role in CRLM.
METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Epub, Cochrane Central, Embase, and 
Scopus (inception-August 31, 2023). Eligible studies involved adult CRC patients 
with CRLM, MDTs including radiologists, and reported on treatment decisions, 
survival, or imaging's influence.
RESULTS: From 13,043 references, 9 studies (8 retrospective, 1 prospective) met 
inclusion, with 2342 patients across six countries. PET/CT altered management in 
up to 10.6% of cases by detecting additional lesions or changing staging. In one 
study, virtual MDTs prevented unnecessary referrals in 43.9% of patients. 
Several studies suggested improved survival outcomes associated with MDT-based 
care. Radiologists contributed to staging, resectability evaluations, and 
decisions on liver-directed therapies. However incomplete data, variability in 
imaging protocols, and inconsistent reporting remained obstacles.
CONCLUSION: Radiologists' expanding MDT role enhances CRLM management through 
improved disease characterization and treatment planning. However, definitive 
survival benefits remain uncertain due to retrospective designs, small sample 
sizes, and methodological heterogeneity. Prospective studies with standardized 
imaging protocols and consistent data integration are needed to better quantify 
radiologists' contributions. Virtual MDTs have promise in broadening access to 
specialist input, potentially improving outcomes and resource utilization in CRC 
with liver metastases.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant tumor of the digestive tract, and 
chemotherapy resistance along with adverse reactions during treatment present 
significant challenges in clinical practice. Therefore, there is an urgent need 
to find effective and low-toxicity therapeutic agents. Ferroptosis, a recently 
discovered form of cell death, has attracted attention as a potential new cancer 
treatment strategy. Microwave dynamic therapy (MWDT), as a promising anticancer 
agent, has been shown to significantly inhibit various malignancies, including 
CRC. However, the role of MWDT in ferroptosis and its underlying mechanisms have 
not been fully explored. In this study, we demonstrated that MWDT treatment 
significantly increased levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO), reactive oxygen 
species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and Fe2⁺, while significantly decreasing 
glutathione (GSH) levels. Ferrostatin-1 partially inhibited these effects. 
Further research revealed that MWDT effectively inhibited tumor growth both in 
vitro and in vivo by inducing ferroptosis. At the molecular level, 
overexpression of PTK2B reversed the ferroptosis induced by MWDT. PTK2B 
interacted with STAT3 and enhanced its phosphorylation at Tyr705, promoting the 
nuclear translocation of p-STAT3 (Tyr705). In the nucleus, p-STAT3 bound to the 
GPX4 promoter region and promoted GPX4 transcription. MWDT inhibited PTK2B 
expression, suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation, and subsequently downregulated 
GPX4 transcription, thereby inducing ferroptosis. Our findings are the first to 
demonstrate that MWDT mediates ferroptosis in CRC via the PTK2B/STAT3/GPX4 axis, 
offering novel theoretical insights for its comprehensive treatment.

Liver cancer due to hepatitis B (LCHB) presents a major public health challenge, 
particularly in younger populations. To date, comprehensive analyses of the 
global burden and changing trends of LCHB in young adults aged 15-49 years are 
understudied. We collected prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) between 1990 and 2021 from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
Study 2021. Percentage change and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) were 
calculated to quantify temporal trends. The future burden to 2030 was projected 
using the Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model. From 1990 to 2021, the global 
prevalence, mortality, and DALYs cases of LCHB in young adults increased by 
49.72%, 18.70%, and 16.08%, while the age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR), 
age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), and age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) 
declined, with EAPCs of - 0.66%, - 1.49%, and - 1.54%, respectively. The sex 
ratio remained consistent at 5:1 (male to female). The middle and high-middle 
SDI regions bore heavier burden than other SDI regions. In 2021, East Asia 
recorded the highest cases and age-standardized rate of prevalence, mortality, 
and DALYs. The younger age groups exhibited lower disease burden compared to 
older ones. New case numbers are predicted to increase globally, particularly in 
China. While the absolute cases of prevalence, mortality, and DALYs for LCHB in 
young adults have increased globally, the ASPR, ASMR, and ASDR have declined 
over the past 32 years. Temporal trend varied by region, country, sex, and age 
group, with the global burden expected to present ongoing challenges.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is called “the king of cancer” because of its high 
degree of malignancy, poor prognosis, and lack of effective treatment. It 
encompasses multiple subtypes, with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) 
representing its most prevalent form. An increasing number of studies have shown 
that tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) is associated with the 
proliferation, migration, and invasion capabilities of various cancers. However, 
the mechanism of TRIM21 function in pancreatic cancer remains to be further 
studied.This study explored the mechanisms of TRIM21 in pancreatic cancer 
through bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments and assessed its 
potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.
METHODS: Using the GEPIA 2 platform, which incorporates TCGA, GTEx, and CPTAC 
datasets along with GEO data, we analyzed the expression levels of TRIM21 mRNA 
or protein across pan-cancer and specifically in PAAD. The HPA database was 
utilized to examine differential TRIM21 protein expression between PAAD patient 
samples and normal tissues, while Western blotting was employed to assess 
differences in TRIM21 expression between pancreatic cancer cell lines and normal 
cells. TIMER 2.0 was applied to investigate the correlation between TRIM21 
expression and clinical parameters, and the Kaplan-Meier plotter was used to 
evaluate its prognostic significance. The cBioPortal database was leveraged to 
analyze the relationship between TRIM21 and immune infiltration in PAAD. The 
impact of TRIM21 on PAAD cell viability, proliferation, and migration was 
assessed through colony formation, CCK-8, and wound healing assays, 
respectively. Flow cytometry was used to measure apoptosis rates and cell cycle 
distribution. Associations between TRIM21 and pathway genes or proteins in PAAD 
patients were determined using either TIMER 2.0 or Western blot analysis.
RESULTS: Analysis of GEPIA 2 and GEO datasets revealed that TRIM21 expression is 
significantly higher in pancreatic cancer tissues compared to non-tumor tissues. 
Consistent findings were obtained from immunohistochemical data in the HPA 
database. Examination of the cBioPortal database indicated that TRIM21 is 
associated with immune infiltration in PAAD. When TRIM21 was specifically 
knocked down using siRNA in PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells, cell viability, 
proliferation, colony formation, and migration were reduced compared to negative 
control cells, while apoptosis was significantly increased. TRIM21 knockdown 
induced noticeable cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and decreased Cyclin D1 
expression. Furthermore, analysis via TIMER 2.0 demonstrated a strong 
correlation between TRIM21 and the expression of genes related to the 
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in PAAD patients. Western blot analysis showed 
that Wnt3a and β-catenin expression decreased in the knockdown group compared to 
the NC group. Additionally, GSK3β expression was increased, while c-Myc 
expression was reduced.
CONCLUSIONS: TRIM21 knockdown reduced PANC-1 cell proliferation and migration, 
induced apoptosis, and affected cell cycle progression. Moreover, TRIM21 
knockdown may affect cell growth by influencing the expression of proteins 
related to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Therefore, TRIM21 is expected to be a 
biomarker for the prognosis evaluation of pancreatic cancer and a potential 
therapeutic target.

BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer survivors (CCSs) are at increased risk of long-term 
treatment-related complications. Although international guidelines support 
risk-based long-term follow-up (LTFU) care, its standardized implementation in 
China has been limited. To address this gap, the National Children's Medical 
Center-Shanghai convened a multidisciplinary expert panel to develop 
disease-based LTFU care plans tailored to the Chinese healthcare context.
METHODS: Guided by established international frameworks (Children's Oncology 
Group, International Guideline Harmonization Group, and PanCareFollowUp), an 
expert group representing 25 institutions across China developed consensus-based 
LTFU care plans for common pediatric cancer patients and post-hematopoietic cell 
transplant survivors. Each care plan includes core components: a treatment 
summary, risk stratification for late effects, recommended surveillance, 
psychosocial evaluation, and lifestyle guidance. The panel also developed a 
consensus on the specific roles of oncologists, primary care providers, and 
subspecialists.
RESULTS: Finalized care plans provide structured, risk-adapted follow-up 
pathways for CCSs. The model emphasizes multidisciplinary collaboration, 
clinical feasibility, and scalability across diverse settings. As part of the 
care process, a centralized survivorship database has been integrated to 
facilitate clinical use and data collection. This system supports the generation 
of standardized treatment summaries and longitudinal documentation of late 
effects across the continuum of survivorship care. Tools, such as clinician 
checklists and survivor education templates, were also developed to support 
clinical use and promote consistency across institutions. A list of outcome 
metrics was proposed to evaluate the implementation outcomes of this initiative.
CONCLUSIONS: This expert consensus establishes an innovative, nationally 
coordinated, disease-specific LTFU care framework for CCSs in China. This study 
provides a practical foundation for improving survivorship care quality and 
guiding clinical practice nationwide. This model can serve as a blueprint for 
other low- and middle-income countries seeking to strengthen LTFU care for CCSs.

BACKGROUND: Cancer prognosis in older adults is complicated by age-related 
vulnerabilities such as frailty, which may impact the performance of traditional 
prognostic tools, which may not accurately reflect risk in this population.
AIMS: This study aimed to assess whether frailty modifies the association 
between a modified performance status (PS) -constructed from days spent in bed, 
physical activity, and disability-and mortality risk in older adults with 
cancer.
METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the Mexican Health and Aging Study 
(MHAS), including individuals ≥50 years with incident cancer and active 
treatment, with follow-up through 2021. A frailty index (FI) was calculated 
using a 33-item deficit accumulation model. Modified PS was constructed using 
data on days in bed, functional limitations, and physical activity. Participants 
were stratified into low (<0.25) and high (≥0.25) frailty levels. Cox regression 
and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to assess associations with all-cause 
mortality.
RESULTS: Among 318 participants (mean age 68.0 years; 62.6% women), frailty and 
performance status were both associated with mortality. In individuals with low 
frailty, modified PS categories 2 and 4 were significantly associated with 
higher mortality (HR 5.46 [95% CI: 1.24-24.04], and HR 8.01 [1.50-42.66], 
respectively). Among those with high frailty, only age remained a significant 
predictor of mortality (HR 1.04 [1.00-1.07]).
DISCUSSION: Frailty significantly modifies the prognostic value of performance 
status. In frail older adults with cancer, the predictive utility of performance 
status tools is reduced.
CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating frailty assessment may enhance risk stratification 
and clinical decision-making in older adults with cancer.

INTRODUCTION: The Choosing Wisely (CW) guidelines in 2016 recommended against 
routine sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for women 70 years and older with 
early-stage, low-risk breast cancer. We sought to examine trends in SLNB before 
and after CW guidelines along with the subsequent impact on adjuvant therapy.
METHODS: The National Cancer Database was used to identify women aged 70 years 
and older with clinical stage I, ER/PR+, HER2- breast cancer between 2010 and 
2021. We evaluated annual percent change (APC) in rates of SLNB by Joinpoint 
log-linear regression and used a multivariable logistic regression model to 
identify predictors of receipt of SLNB in the post-CW cohort. We also assessed 
rates of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation stratified by receipt of SLNB in 
the post-CW cohort.
RESULTS: Our study demonstrated an annual decrease in the percentage of women 
undergoing SLNB after 2016, with an APC of -4.1% (p < 0.001); however, a 
majority of patients meeting de-escalation criteria (68.7%) still underwent SLNB 
in 2021. Women older than 75 (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.30-0.32) and with a 
Charlson-Deyo score of 3 or greater (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.60-0.70) were least 
likely to undergo SLNB, while treatment at nonacademic centers was associated 
with SLNB (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.63-1.76). Post-CW, there were no significant change 
in rates of adjuvant chemotherapy. However, receipt of adjuvant radiation 
therapy significantly increased in patients for whom SLNB was omitted with an 
APC of +15.0%, with each additional year of diagnosis after 2016 associated with 
increased odds of radiation receipt (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.11-1.17).
CONCLUSIONS: Though there has been significant progress made in de-escalating 
surgical management of early-stage breast cancer in older patients, most 
patients are still undergoing SLNB. Moreover, patients in whom SLNB is being 
omitted appear more likely than before to receive adjuvant radiation. More work 
is needed to provide quality, uniform and cost-effective care for all patients.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/ERBB2) is a well-established 
therapeutic target in breast and gastric cancers, but its relevance in prostate 
cancer (PC) remains unresolved. Although HER2 gene amplification is relatively 
uncommon in PC, heterogeneous overexpression has been observed, particularly in 
advanced and castration-resistant PC (CRPC), where it is frequently associated 
with aggressive clinicopathological features. Experimental studies portray HER2 
as a signaling hub, mediating crosstalk with androgen receptor (AR) signaling to 
sustain tumor growth under androgen-deprived conditions. Concurrent activation 
of the HER2-PI3K-AKT axis further promotes cell survival, proliferation, and 
therapeutic adaptation. Moreover, HER2 cooperates with epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) and NF-κB pathways, reinforcing tumor plasticity and resistance 
mechanisms. Despite these compelling biological insights, clinical translation 
has been disappointing. Early trials with Trastuzumab, Lapatinib, and Pertuzumab 
yielded minimal benefit, underscoring patient heterogeneity, pathway redundancy, 
and the lack of biomarker-guided stratification. Lessons from these failures 
highlight the need for precision oncology approaches that integrate molecular 
profiling and rational therapeutic combinations. Recent advances, including 
next-generation HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies, 
and CAR-T cell therapies, as well as strategies combining HER2 inhibition with 
AR signaling blockade, PI3K/AKT inhibitors, or immunotherapy, offer renewed 
promise. HER2 in PC thus represents a paradox: biologically significant but 
clinically underexploited. Reframing HER2 within the AR-PI3K signaling network 
and leveraging biomarker-driven strategies may finally unlock its therapeutic 
potential. This review critically examines HER2 in PC, analyzing its mechanistic 
roles, therapeutic potential, and the challenges that shape its value as both a 
prognostic biomarker and actionable target.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the Quantitative-PRIMARY 
(Q-PRIMARY) model based on the PRIMARY score for diagnosing clinically 
significant prostate cancer (csPCa) using [18F]PSMA-1007 PET/CT.
METHODS: A total of 324 consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled and 
retrospectively analyzed. Cohort assignment was based on the availability of 
in-house multiparametric MRI: a training cohort (n = 222, no in-house MRI) and 
an internal validation cohort (n = 102, with in-house MRI). Histopathology from 
systematic 12-core biopsy or radical-prostatectomy specimens served as the 
reference standard. We developed the Q-PRIMARY model by integrating visual 
PRIMARY scores with quantitative SUV-based thresholds (ΔSUVpeak, SUVmax, SUVR) 
for each PRIMARY category (scores 2-4).
RESULTS: There were 27, 41, 33, and 46 patients in the four groups, with 
positive lesions found in 62%, 62%, 53.53%, and 65.08%, respectively. Optimal 
diagnostic parameters for csPCa included ΔSUVpeak, SUVmax, SUVratio (SUVR), and 
SUVmax. The areas under the curve (AUC) ranged from 0.888 to 0.944, with high 
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative 
predictive value (NPV). The Q-PRIMARY demonstrates superior diagnostic accuracy 
and clinical benefits compared to MRI PI-RADS, with more stable performance in 
AUC (0.978 vs. 0.768), sensitivity (97.18% vs. 92.96%), specificity (96.77% vs. 
54.84%), PPV (98.60% vs. 82.50%), NPV (93.70% vs. 77.30%), and clinical decision 
curve analysis (DCA).
CONCLUSION: In this selected high-risk cohort, the [18F]PSMA-1007 PET/CT 
Q-PRIMARY framework delivered high diagnostic performance and complemented 
multiparametric MRI. External prospective validation is warranted before 
clinical adoption.

miRNA-21-5p and miRNA-155-5p have emerged as two promising biomarkers in body 
fluids during the early stages of lung cancer. This study focused on designing a 
dual-target optical biosensor for the simultaneous detection of miRNA-21 and 
miRNA-155. DNA hairpin probes and metal nanoclusters are the materials used in 
this design. Light-emitting gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) and copper-silver 
nanoclusters (Cu/AgNCs) were located on hairpin probes to achieve 
fluorescence-based detection. The biosensor leverages the distinct fluorescence 
properties of these nanoclusters to detect target miRNAs (miRNA-21 enhances the 
emission of Cu/AgNCs, while miRNA-155 quenches the emission of AuNCs). The 
biosensor demonstrated remarkable sensitivity toward miRNA-21 and miRNA-155. 
Detection limits were 1 pM and 5 pM, and linear response ranges were 15-140 pM 
and 15-125 pM for miRNA-21 and miRNA-155, respectively. The response of the 
nanobiosensor was validated by RT-qPCR as the gold standard method in analyses 
of miRNAs in human serum samples and lung cancer cells. The obtained results 
confirmed the accuracy and reliability of the biosensor. Compared to existing 
biosensors, the proposed design avoids complex surface modifications and enzyme 
usage, ensuring cost-effectiveness and operational simplicity.

BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making (SDM) is a key component of patient-centered 
cancer care; however, its implementation remains poorly understood in 
resource-limited settings like Bangladesh. The purpose of this survey is to 
assess the prevalence of SDM, identify its associated factors, and evaluate its 
impact on patient satisfaction within this context.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using convenience sampling 
between May and July 2024 at a tertiary care specialized cancer hospital in 
Bangladesh. Eligible participants were adult patients with cancer who had 
received at least two cycles of chemotherapy or radiation therapy and had the 
physical and decisional capacity to participate. Chi-square tests assessed 
bivariate associations, and multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for age, 
education, and treatment modality, identified independent predictors of SDM 
participation.
RESULTS: Among 231 participants (mean [SD] age, 51.6 [13.2] years), 55% were 
women and 91% were not in formal employment. Overall, 32% of patients reported 
participating in SDM, whereas 59% expressed a preference for it. Patients with 
no formal education had 85% lower odds of participating in SDM compared to those 
with schooling (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.06–0.38; P < 0.001). Compared to the youngest group, middle-aged patients had 
89% lower odds of participating in SDM (AOR, 0.11; 95% CI 0.04–0.31; P < 0.001), 
and older patients had 95% lower odds (AOR, 0.05; 95% CI 0.01–0.18; P < 0.001). 
Working patients had over four times the odds of engaging in SDM compared to 
non-working patients (AOR, 4.24; 95% CI 2.25–10.17; P = 0.001). Actual 
involvement in SDM, desire for additional information, and preferred 
decision-making role were significantly associated with satisfaction (P < 0.001 
for all).
CONCLUSIONS: The significant disconnect between patients' high preference for 
and low participation in SDM highlights a critical gap in patient-centered 
oncology care in Bangladesh. Systemic barriers, such as severe time constraints 
and low health literacy, must be addressed through targeted interventions, 
including clinician training and the development of low-literacy decision aids, 
to advance equitable cancer care.

PURPOSE: Employment for cancer survivors impacts psychological, physical, and 
financial wellbeing. Existing systematic reviews of factors associated with 
employment outcomes are limited to specific cancer types, determinants, 
outcomes, and/or settings. This scoping review spanning one decade of 
international research aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of factors 
associated with employment outcomes in cancer survivors.
METHODS: Systematic scoping review methodology was used to identify primary 
studies conducting multivariate analysis of factors associated with any 
employment outcome (negative: reduced or less timely, productive, sustained, or 
satisfying employment or positive: maintained/return or more timely, productive, 
sustained, or satisfying employment) in adult cancer survivors (January 2014 to 
March 2024). Data were extracted on population, setting, outcomes, and 
associated factors.
RESULTS: Across 185 included studies, factors frequently associated with 
negative employment outcomes included older age, female sex, advanced cancer 
stage, some cancer types, and receipt of chemotherapy. Factors frequently 
associated with positive employment outcomes included higher education, more 
advantaged insurance status, some cancer types, and higher physical function. 
Research gaps were identified in specific populations/settings at risk of poorer 
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Modifiable and nonmodifiable factors associated with employment 
outcomes require screening and targeted interventions in clinical settings as 
well as the development of healthcare delivery, workplace, and national policies 
and resources. Future research should address gaps in people with advanced 
cancer, vulnerable groups, and lower resource settings.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Survivors at risk for negative outcomes 
should be identified and offered relevant, tailored information and resources 
regarding the impact of cancer and treatment on employment outcomes.

Ensuring universal and equitable access to supportive cancer care is essential 
for improving patient outcomes and quality of life. Digital health interventions 
have emerged as promising tools to address barriers in supportive cancer care by 
enabling remote symptom management, real-time patient monitoring, behavior 
change support, and enhanced communication with healthcare providers. However, 
despite their potential, challenges remain in their design, evaluation, and 
implementation. Methodological concerns, fragmented stakeholder engagement, and 
a lack of standardized frameworks have limited their effectiveness and 
widespread adoption. This paper explores strategies to optimize the design, 
development, and evaluation of digital health interventions for supportive 
cancer care. It highlights the shift from traditional intervention frameworks to 
user-focused approaches, such as co-design, which actively involve patients and 
stakeholders in the design process. While these approaches enhance usability and 
relevance, their application remains inconsistent. Furthermore, evaluation 
challenges persist due to the limited use of rigorous methodologies. To advance 
digital health in supportive oncology, a hybrid model integrating international 
digital health standards with pathology-specific adaptations is proposed. This 
approach ensures interoperability while addressing the unique needs of 
supportive cancer care. Clear, actionable guidelines, co-design, and robust 
evaluation frameworks are critical to ensuring these interventions are 
accessible, effective, and sustainable in clinical practice. Addressing systemic 
barriers, including data security, access equity, and real-world implementation, 
is essential to realizing the full potential of digital health in supportive 
cancer care.

Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) of HER2 expression and HER3 upregulation have 
been associated with resistance to HER2-targeted therapies. However, their 
predictive role in the neoadjuvant setting remains controversial. We 
retrospectively analyzed 59 patients with HER2-positive invasive breast 
carcinoma treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and anti-HER2 agents at the 
Agostino Gemelli University Hospital (2018-2020). HER2 ITH was assessed on 
pre-treatment biopsies and residual tumors (when applicable) by 
immunohistochemistry and SISH. HER3 expression was also evaluated using IHC and 
categorized as negative, low, or high. The association with pathological 
complete response (pCR) and event-free survival (EFS) was assessed. pCR was 
achieved in 49.2% of patients. HER2 ITH was present in 23.7% of biopsies and was 
significantly associated with a lower pCR rate (p = 0.005). In multivariate 
analysis, HER2 ITH (OR 0.156, p = 0.030), HER2 score (3 + vs 2 + , OR 9.63, 
p = 0.044), and PgR negativity (OR 0.306, p = 0.029) emerged as independent 
predictors of pCR. HER3 expression did not significantly correlate with pCR or 
EFS, although a non-significant trend toward reduced EFS was observed in 
HER3-high cases. HER2 ITH negatively impacts pathological response to 
neoadjuvant therapy in HER2-positive breast cancer and may serve as a potential 
predictive biomarker. HER3 expression, while not significantly associated with 
outcome in this cohort, warrants further investigation as a possible contributor 
to therapeutic resistance. Standardized assessment protocols for both markers 
could improve patient stratification, guide treatment intensification, and 
support the integration of novel targeted agents in HER2-positive breast cancer.

Conflict of interest statement: Declarations: This study was conducted in 
accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines andthe Declaration of Helsinki 
(1975, revised in 2013). The clinical information had been retrieved from the 
patient’s medical records and pathology reports. Patients’ initials or other 
personal identifiers did not appear in any image. Finally, all samples were 
anonymized before histology and immunohistochemistry. Due to the retrospective 
nature of the study, our institution did not deem the approval of an ethical 
committee as necessary because the analyzed data were collected as part of 
diagnosis, and patients were diagnosed and treated according to 
national/international guidelines and agreements. Our analysis looked 
retrospectively at the treated patient outcomes. This was achieved internally as 
part of an audit/evaluation to improve our quality of care. Conflict of

PURPOSE: Both MRI and PSMA PET/CT are often utilized for staging of 
intermediate-risk (IR) and high-risk (HR) prostate cancer (PCa). Recent studies 
found that PSMA PET/CT was superior to MRI in correctly identifying final 
pathological tumor stage, dominant nodule, extraprostatic extension (EPE), and 
small areas of clinically significant PCa. We sought to determine if PSMA PET/CT 
was superior to MRI in both locoregional staging of PCa and potential focal 
therapy planning.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed our prospectively collected, IRB-approved 
database of all patients who underwent prostatectomy at one institution between 
10/1/2019-2/29/2024. Patients were excluded if they did not pre-operatively 
undergo both MRI and PSMA PET/CT. 2 × 2 tables were used to compare each 
modality to the ""gold standard"" of prostatectomy specimen in both the proper 
detection of laterality and presence of EPE. Sensitivities and specificities 
were compared using a chi-squared test. HR v. IR groups were compared using a 
Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for 
categorical variables. Results were considered significant at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: 580 patients underwent prostatectomy within the specified timeframe. 78 
patients met inclusion criteria. MRI was more sensitive in the detection of EPE 
than PSMA PET/CT (23.5% v. 7.8%, p = 0.0294). MRI and PSMA PET/CT were similar 
in the specificity of EPE detection. In the identification of laterality, MRI 
was more specific (86.7% v. 56.7%, p = 0.0099), while sensitivities were similar 
between the modalities.
CONCLUSIONS: MRI was superior to PSMA PET/CT in the proper detection of both EPE 
and laterality in patients with IR and HR PCa.

Tn Hitchhiker Vaccines for High-Affinity Antibody Production and Targeted Cancer 
Cell Binding.

The development of effective cancer vaccines relies on the ability to generate a 
strong and specific humoral immune response against tumor-associated antigens. 
The Tn antigen, a truncated O-glycan overexpressed by various carcinomas, is a 
potent immunotherapeutic target. In this study, we evaluate the antibody 
specificity elicited in mice by the Tn-DSPE-PEG-2000 amphiphilic vaccine, along 
with initial insights into its cellular processing using a lysosomal assay.The 
vaccine is found to undergo lysosomal escape, thereby facilitating cytoplasmic 
antigen delivery, which is a crucial step for effective antigen presentation. 
ELISA studies show that the individual components of Tn antigen construct are 
essential for the antibody recognition. Specific binding of the serum-anti-Tn 
antibodies to Tn-positive MCF-7 cells is assessed by confocal microscopy, 
whereas negligible binding is observed in Tn-negative HEK293 cells, thereby 
supporting the high specificity of the immune response. Flow cytometry validates 
the strong reactivity of serum antibodies toward Tn-expressing cells and surface 
plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis enables quantification of the high-affinity 
interactions between serum anti-Tn antibodies and the Tn antigen. The study 
establishes (i) the specificity of antibody generated by Tn-DSPE-PEG-2000 and 
(ii) the structural requirement of the antigen for the anti-Tn antibody 
recognition.

IMPORTANCE: Emerging evidence suggests that cholesterol plays a role in breast 
cancer (BC) metabolism, raising the possibility that cholesterol-lowering 
medications, such as statins, may improve BC prognosis.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between postdiagnosis statin initiation 
and BC mortality using an emulated target trial approach.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This observational cohort study using a 
target trial framework included 96 924 women diagnosed with stage I to III BC 
from 2000 to 2021 from Nationwide Danish registries, including the Danish Breast 
Cancer Group's clinical database and the Danish National Prescription Registry. 
Women with prior invasive BC or prediagnosis use of cholesterol-lowering 
medication were excluded. Eligible patients were duplicated into a cloned cohort 
and assigned to 1 of 2 treatment strategies: statin initiation within 36 months 
postdiagnosis or no statin initiation. Patients were followed up until deviation 
from the assigned strategy, emigration, death, 10 years of follow-up, or October 
5, 2022.
EXPOSURES: Initiation of any statin within 36 months after BC diagnosis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was BC mortality. Secondary 
outcomes included all-cause mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were 
estimated using inverse probability of censoring weighted (IPCW) Cox regression 
models with a robust variance estimator.
RESULTS: A total of 66 952 patients with BC were enrolled in the emulated target 
trial (17 152 [27.6%] were aged 50-59 years); 4851 (7.2%) initiated statins 
within 36 months after diagnosis. Over 606 266 person-years of follow-up, 9130 
patients died from BC and 19 679 from any cause. The 10-year risk of breast 
cancer mortality was 11.8% among statin initiators and 13.5% among 
noninitiators, corresponding to a risk difference of 1.7% (95% CI, 0.5% to 
3.0%). A similar difference was observed for all-cause mortality (23.3% vs 
24.5%; risk difference, 1.2%; 95% CI, -0.1% to 2.5%). IPCW analysis yielded an 
HR of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.95) for BC mortality and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.85 to 
1.00) for all-cause mortality among statin initiators vs noninitiators.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, among 66 952 women with early 
BC, postdiagnosis statin initiation was associated with a modest reduction in BC 
and all-cause mortality. These findings support further investigation into the 
potential role of statins as an adjunct to standard adjuvant BC treatment.

IMPORTANCE: Growing evidence suggests that physical activity protects against 
digestive system cancers (DSCs). However, it remains largely unknown whether 
consistently reaching the physical activity guidelines (≥7.5 metabolic 
equivalent task [MET]-hours/week) is associated with lower DSC risk or whether a 
much higher level is needed.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between physical activity and DSC risk and 
mortality with a focus on the optimal amount and long-term consistency in 
performing the recommended level over a long period of time.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based cohort study includes 
data from 3 large US prospective cohorts: Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, 
1988-2020; Nurses' Health Study, 1988-2021; and Nurses' Health Study II, 
1991-2021. Data analysis was performed between October 2024 and May 2025. 
Participants were men and women free from cancer and cardiovascular disease at 
baseline.
EXPOSURES: Total levels of leisure-time physical activity were assessed with 
biennial validated questionnaires and expressed in MET-hours per week. 
Consistency was calculated as the percentage of follow-up years meeting the 
recommended level (≥7.5 MET-hours/week).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: DSCs included cancers of digestive tract (mouth, 
throat, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, and rectum) and digestive 
accessory organs (pancreas, gallbladder, and liver).
RESULTS: During up to 32 years of follow-up of 231 067 men and women (median 
age, 43 [IQR, 36-55] years), a total of 6538 incident DSCs and 3791 DSC deaths 
were documented. Higher physical activity levels were associated with lower DSC 
risk (≥45 vs <3 MET-hours/week; hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.93; 
P < .001 for trend) and mortality (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62-0.83; P < .001 for 
trend). The inverse associations were evident for both digestive tract and 
accessory organ cancers: the HRs comparing greater than or equal to 45 vs 3 
MET-hours/week were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.75-0.97) for digestive tract cancer risk and 
0.73 (95% CI, 0.58-0.92) for digestive accessory organ cancer risk. The 
traditional dose-response analysis suggested the lowest DSC risk was achieved at 
approximately 50 MET-hours/week. However, when long-term consistency was 
considered, compared with those with minimal activity, consistently reaching the 
guideline at moderate levels (median, 16.9 [IQR, 13.6-20.5] MET-hours/week) over 
3 decades was associated with substantial reductions in DSC risk (HR, 0.83; 95% 
CI, 0.75-0.90), whereas that performing much higher amounts (median, 38.5 [IQR, 
28.5-53.8] MET-hours/week) was not associated with further benefit (HR, 0.87; 
95% CI, 0.81-0.93).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, traditional dose-response analysis 
suggested that approximately 50 MET-hours/week was associated with optimal DSC 
risk reduction. After incorporating long-term consistency, maintenance of a 
moderate level approximately 17 MET-hours/week over 3 decades was associated 
with achieving optimal benefit in reducing DSC risk.

University, Uppsala, Sweden.

IMPORTANCE: Hormonal contraceptives are widely used but how breast cancer risk 
differs by hormonal content remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the difference in breast cancer risk associated with 
different hormonal contraceptive formulations.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This Swedish nationwide, population-based 
cohort study was conducted using linked national registers. All adolescent girls 
and women aged 13 to 49 years residing in Sweden as of January 1, 2006, with no 
history of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, 
bilateral oophorectomy, or infertility treatment were included and followed up 
from 2006 to 2019. Individuals were censored on meeting an exclusion criterion, 
reaching age 50 years, or study end, whichever occurred first. Data were 
analyzed from November 2023 to August 2025.
EXPOSURE: Ever use and duration of use of hormonal contraceptives, categorized 
by hormone formulations and route of administration.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Time-dependent Cox regression was used to estimate 
hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for incident cases of in situ and invasive 
breast cancer.
RESULTS: Among 2 095 130 adolescent girls and women (median [IQR] age at 
diagnosis, 45 [41-48] years) who were followed up for 21 020 846 person-years, 
16 385 breast cancer cases occurred. Ever use of any hormonal contraceptive was 
associated with increased breast cancer risk (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.20-1.28), 
corresponding to 1 additional case per 7752 (95% CI, 5350-14 070) users, with 
both combined (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.07-1.17) and progestin-only formulations (HR, 
1.21; 95% CI, 1.17-1.25) being associated. Higher risk was associated with oral 
desogestrel-only formulations (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.13-1.23) and oral 
desogestrel-combined formulations (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.08-1.31), as well as 
implants containing etonogestrel, desogestrel's active metabolite (HR, 1.22; 95% 
CI, 1.11-1.35), compared to levonorgestrel-containing combined pills (HR, 1.09; 
95% CI, 1.03-1.15) and levonorgestrel, 52 mg, intrauterine system (HR, 1.13; 95% 
CI, 1.09-1.18). No statistically significant increased risk was observed for 
medroxyprogesterone acetate injection, etonogestrel vaginal ring, or combined 
oral drospirenone, despite having many users.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings of this cohort study highlight that breast 
cancer risk varies substantially by progestin content in hormonal 
contraceptives, providing valuable insights to support more informed 
contraceptive prescription.

BACKGROUND: With the adoption of safer outpatient cancer care practices, much of 
cancer care has transitioned to outpatient settings, decreasing the need for 
inpatient systemic therapy (IST) which is associated with poorer end-of-life 
outcomes. We evaluated reasons for IST use, palliative care (PC) utilization, 
and outcomes among IST recipients to inform guidelines on appropriate IST use.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all IST 
admissions at an academic center from January 2016 to December 2017. Patients 
were stratified by solid tumor (ST) vs hematological malignancies (HM). We 
recorded IST urgency, response, mortality, and other variables. Descriptive 
statistics and odds ratios were estimated from logistic regression models with 
mixed-effect to account for multiple admissions per patient.
RESULTS: We analyzed 893 admissions (19% ST) among 620 patients. HM patients 
required frequent elective IST admissions than ST (p<.0001). ST patients more 
often received IST for non-urgent indications (p = 0.0032) during non-cancer 
related admissions. ST patients had fewer responses to IST compared to HM (36% 
vs 70%; p < 0.0001). PC services were more likely utilized for ST vs HM patients 
(48% vs 14%; p<.0001); and were associated with increased rates of health care 
proxy assignment, code status change and hospice discharge. Early 60-day 
mortality was higher for ST vs HM patients (17.3% vs 5.8%; p < 0.001) and most 
patients (55%) died inpatient during the index admission.
CONCLUSION: IST was overutilized in ST patients with poor response rates and 
significant early mortality. PC service utilization rates remain low but 
improved end-of-life transition planning.

The antiproliferative effect of [AuCl(tmp-terpy)](PF6)2 (1), 
[PtCl(tmp-terpy)](CF3SO3) (2), [MnCl2(tmp-terpy)] (3), and 
4'-(3,4,5-trimethoxy-phenyl)-2,2':6',2″-terpyridine (tmp-terpy) was analyzed in 
sensitive and doxorubicin-resistant (DoxR) colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines 
and in normal primary human fibroblasts. Comprehensive studies were performed 
for 1 and tmp-terpy, showing the strongest cytotoxicity in HCT116DoxR 2D cells 
and having the capability to induce the loss of cell viability in 3D HCT116DoxR 
spheroids. Complex 1 internalizes CRC-resistant cancer cells and increases the 
number of reactive oxygen species (ROS), triggering cell death by apoptosis and 
autophagy. Changes in protein expression levels of HCT116DoxR cells exposed to 1 
and tmp-terpy primarily affect protein folding, apoptosis, and stress response, 
consistent with the observed induction of programmed cell death and ROS. The 
combination of 1 or tmp-terpy with oxaliplatin (OX) and cisplatin (Cis) shows 
cytotoxic effects in 3D CRC-resistant spheroids. No in vivo toxicity in a 
chicken embryo is observed, even when 1 is combined with an OX and Cis.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is generally perceived as a major stressor. Occasionally, 
patients are able to accept their diagnosis and prognosis, and it is not 
uncommon for patients who initially experience great distress to eventually 
learn to accept their disease. A deeper understanding of acceptance can enable 
clinicians to better support patients in achieving a more peaceful state of 
mind. The purpose of this literature review was to provide a comprehensive 
overview of existing research on acceptance in patients with cancer.
RECENT FINDINGS: Study selection resulted in the inclusion of 54 studies. All 
studies except one were published after the year 2000. Acceptance was defined in 
terms of cognition, emotion, behavior, spiritual processes, social processes, or 
other terms. Acceptance focused on disease, illness, cancer, poor 
prognosis/imminent death, or was not specified, and was measured by interview or 
questionnaire. Evidence was found for a range of factors associated with 
acceptance.
CONCLUSIONS: Acceptance is a relatively new field of research, characterized by 
significant heterogeneity in both its definition and focus, as well as the 
hypothesized determinants and outcomes. To advance this field, it is essential 
to develop a generally accepted definition of acceptance and to consistently 
specify its focus. The present scoping review provides a solid foundation for 
this endeavor.

BACKGROUND: Total mesorectal excision (TME) is the standard surgical treatment 
for rectal cancer. Transanal local excision (TLE) after neoadjuvant 
chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) is an organ-preserving option, avoiding morbidity of 
TME. This study compared TLE versus TME following nCRT.
METHODS: We searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane 
databases, Google Scholar, and CINHAL to 30 April 2025. Eligible studies were 
adults with nonmetastatic mid or low rectal cancer treated with nCRT followed by 
TLE or TME. Outcomes included local recurrence, disease free survival (DFS), 
overall survival (OS), and postoperative complications. Risk of bias was 
assessed using Cochrane RoB 2 for randomized trials and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale 
(NOS) for cohorts.
RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included. TLE was associated with higher local 
recurrence in cohorts (RR = 1.823; 95% CI = 1.222-2.720; p = 0.003), but no 
difference in RCTs (RR = 1.248; 95% CI = 0.618-2.518; p = 0.537). DFS 
(HR = 1.121; p = 0.174) and OS (HR = 1.032; p = 0.830) did not differ. 
Postoperative morbidity was lower after TLE (RR = 0.429; p = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: Strengths include robust search, study quality and number of 
patients, while heterogeneity in nCRT protocol, follow up, and complication 
reporting are limitations. Higher recurrence in TLE in cohorts but not in RCTs 
suggests safety of TLE when strict selection criteria are applied.

Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent cancer and the second leading cause of 
cancer-related mortality among women. Early detection and treatment can 
significantly improve survival rates. The potential application of small 
extracellular vesicles (sEVs) as biomarkers for early BC diagnosis has gained 
increasing attention, primarily due to their promise as a minimally invasive 
detection method. However, the specific protein signatures of sEVs are still not 
well understood. This study compared the proteomes of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A 
cells with their respective sEVs and conducted cross-comparisons between the two 
cell types and their sEV populations. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that 
MDA-MB-231 cell-derived sEVs are enriched with proteins involved in cancer 
growth and proliferation pathways. The proteins from these pathways can offer a 
valuable resource for triple-negative BC (TNBC) biomarkers. In this study, three 
proteins were selected based on their unique presence in MDA-MB-231 cell-derived 
sEVs and their association with pathways related to BC: peroxidasin homolog 
(PXDN), glutathione hydrolase 5 proenzyme (GGT5), and plasminogen activator 
inhibitor 1 (SERPINE1). These proteins were validated using synthetic 
heavy-labeled peptides and mass spectrometry-based parallel reaction monitoring, 
as well as Western blot analysis. This study highlights the potential of 
sEV-based proteins as noninvasive biomarkers for early TNBC detection, laying 
the groundwork for future diagnostic studies.

The genomic instability associated with cancer can result in the formation of 
extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA), which contributes to tumor 
heterogeneity, gene amplification, tumor evolution, and drug resistance. 
However, most studies on eccDNA have been conducted on tumor tissue or cancer 
cell lines, and limited research has been done on eccDNA in plasma. In this 
study, we investigated eccDNA in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by 
sequencing plasma eccDNA from 32 epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated 
NSCLC patients before and during treatment with osimertinib, as well as plasma 
eccDNA from five healthy individuals. Plasma eccDNA was identified in all 
samples but with significantly higher levels in cancer patients than healthy 
controls. EGFR-overlapping eccDNA, eccDNA that contains part of or the whole 
EGFR gene, was detected in the majority of samples both at baseline and during 
treatment. High levels of EGFR-overlapping eccDNA during osimertinib treatment 
were associated with significantly shorter progression-free survival and overall 
survival. Plasma eccDNA represents a newly identified type of biomarker for 
monitoring treatment efficacy.

PURPOSE: Microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancers (CRCs), in contrast to 
microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) CRCs, have few mutations and are 
insensitive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). CRCs treated with targeted 
agents often acquire a high number of genomic alterations at progression. We 
asked if targeted therapy could be used to generate a high tumor mutational 
burden (TMB) in MSS CRC and sensitize these tumors to ICB.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In patients with MSS metastatic CRC treated with targeted 
therapy, we evaluated baseline and progression TMB and response to ICB for 
patients whose tumors developed high TMB. We determined types of alterations, 
mutational signatures, neoantigenicity, and clonality associated with emergent 
genomic alterations in cases of acquired high TMB.
RESULTS: Among 26 cases, nine acquired high TMB at progression. Three of these 
patients received ICB but none had a response. In the TMB-high cases, we found 
no induction of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or programmed death-ligand 1 
expression. Acquired genomic alterations consisted predominantly of single 
nucleotide variants, were enriched for single-base substitution 17a/b mutational 
signature, and did not enhance predicted major histocompatibility complex class 
I binding. TMB was higher in plasma, driven by highly subclonal acquired 
alterations, compared to tissue samples which harbored few resistance 
alterations.
CONCLUSION: A substantial number of MSS CRCs acquire high TMB following targeted 
therapy. However, this change is not associated with sensitization to ICB. The 
high TMB is due to subclonal alterations unique to individual disease sites that 
are inadequate to elicit a robust antitumor immune response.

Small molecule KRASG12C(OFF) inhibitors that bind to the inactive GDP-bound 
state of KRAS have demonstrated efficacy in patients with KRASG12C mutant 
tumors, yet responses tend to be transient due to emergence of on-treatment 
resistance. Recently, RAS(ON) G12C-selective inhibitors, which bind to the 
active GTP-bound state of RAS, were described, and elironrasib is undergoing 
evaluation in multiple clinical trials. Here, we generated resistant cell lines 
and patient-derived xenograft models to KRASG12C(OFF) and RAS(ON) G12C-selective 
inhibitors and interrogated resistance mechanisms using a multi-omics strategy 
consisting of phosphoproteomics, whole exome sequencing, and RNA-sequencing 
combined with functional testing using small molecule and CRISPR screens and 
RAS(ON) inhibitors being evaluated in clinical trials. Two models reactivated 
RAS signaling, either via KRASG12C gene amplification or NRASG13R mutation, and 
were vulnerable to dual inhibition by RAS(ON) G12C-selective and RAS(ON) 
multi-selective inhibitors, RMC-4998 and RMC-7977. Two models, which lacked any 
discernable genomic alteration, acquired resistance associated with increased 
receptor tyrosine kinase activity and downstream persistent RAS activity and 
were sensitive to RAS-GTP inhibition by RMC-7977. Finally, one model displayed 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition, loss of RAS dependance, and acquired reliance 
on cell cycle kinases and proteins associated with DNA damage response. This 
work highlights KRASG12C-selective inhibitor resistant states that parallel and 
complement clinical findings and demonstrate that a large subset could be 
overcome with a RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitor as a standalone agent or in 
combination with other therapies.

INTRODUCTION: Peripheral neuropathy is a well-known complication in patients 
undergoing taxane chemotherapy. Several measures to prevent this condition have 
been tried, but none have yielded conclusive results.
METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were searched 
for randomized (RCTs) and self-controlled (SCTs) trials comparing cryotherapy 
with standard care in patients with breast cancer undergoing taxane-based 
chemotherapy and reporting any of the following outcomes: (1) 
chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) or (2) adverse events.
RESULTS: A total of 395 patients from ten studies were included, all female. The 
age of participants ranged from 49.8 to 56.1 years. Incidence of any-grade CIPN 
was not significantly different between groups (RCTs RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.21-1.66; 
p = 0.320; SCTs RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.10-1.62; p = 0.198). No difference was 
observed in adverse events leading to discontinuation of cryotherapy (RCTs RR 
0.72; 95% CI 0.17-3.05; p = 0.660; SCTs RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.51-2.34; p = 0.821).
CONCLUSIONS: Cryotherapy was not statistically superior to the standard of care 
in reducing CIPN, without an increased risk of adverse events leading to 
discontinuation of cryotherapy. These findings underscore the need for further 
studies with more rigorous methodologies to definitively validate or rule out 
this finding.

INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer, due to its heterogeneous nature and variable 
response to current systemic treatment, can be a great concern. Deregulation of 
the DNA Damage Response (DDR) pathway genes due to mutation and expression 
increases cancer risk, progression, and metastasis. The current study was 
designed to check the expression deregulation patterns of the selected DDR 
pathway genes (ATM, CHEK1, and CHEK2) at the protein level.
MATERIAL & METHOD: Immunohistochemistry-based expression profiling was conducted 
in 102 histopathological confirmed breast cancer-diagnosed tissues and their 
adjacent uninvolved control tissues.
RESULTS: Downregulated expression of the selected DDR pathway (ATM, CHEK1, and 
CHEK2) proteins was observed in breast tumor tissues compared to control 
tissues. Downregulated protein expression of the DDR pathway genes (ATM, CHEK1, 
and CHEK2) correlates with aggressive breast cancer phenotypes and increased 
tumor burden. The selected proteins showed significant diagnostic potential 
having strong area under curve values for CHEK2 (0.828, p < 0.0001), CHEK1 (775, 
p < 0.0001) and ATM (0.725, < 0.0001) proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that dysregulated expression of these 
three proteins leads toward poor survival outcomes, suggesting their role to be 
used as a better and more effective diagnostic and prognostic marker for early 
diagnosis and effective treatment of breast cancer patients.

Plain Language Summary: In Pakistan, breast cancer is increasing uncontrollably 
which is quite alarming. Despite advancement in different treatment options, it 
is a serious concern and finding new and effective diagnostic methods is 
essential. DNA Damage Response (DDR) pathways have been found linked with 
different diseases including cancer. However, limited data is available about 
expression variation of DDR proteins in breast cancer patients. The current 
study therefore aims to study the role of selected DDR proteins (ATM, CHEK1, and 
CHEK2) in breast cancer. One hundred and two breast cancer diagnosed tumor 
tissues and their adjacent healthy control tissue were labeled using these 
specific proteins by Immunohistochemistry method. The selected proteins showed 
under expression in breast tumor tissues, whereas over expression was observed 
in normal breast tissues. The study findings revealed early diagnostic and 
better prognostic values for breast cancer.

Pelvic lymph node metastasis (PLNM) significantly affects the prognosis of 
cervical cancer (CC). However, current imaging examinations and serum squamous 
cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) testing are inadequate for assessing the pelvic 
lymph node status in CC. To identify accurate noninvasive biomarkers for 
diagnosing PLNM and minimizing unnecessary postoperative lymphadenectomy and its 
associated complications, we performed a comprehensive proteomic and metabolomic 
analysis of plasma from 124 patients with CC, along with a proteomic analysis of 
60 paired tissue samples. Through machine learning methods, we identified 
potential plasma biomarkers (TTR, MASP2, APOD, and 7α-hydroxy-cholestene-3-one) 
and constructed a diagnostic model. In the validation cohort, the diagnostic 
model combined with SCCA exhibited a higher sensitivity (72.4%) than SCCA 
(64.3%) and imaging examination (14.3%). The plasma protein biomarkers were 
consistently validated in paired tissue samples. Additionally, immune 
infiltration analysis demonstrated that CD4 and CD8 T cells were highly 
infiltrated in the PLNM group, suggesting a potentially enhanced response to 
immunotherapy. Here, we established a biomarker panel for PLNM and highlighted 
the altered immune characteristics associated with PLNM, offering valuable 
insights for the development of immunotherapy strategies for patients with PLNM.

During surgery for thoracic esophageal cancer, the resected esophagus remains in 
the thoracic cavity, allowing fluid to leak from the specimen. If this fluid 
contains cancer cells, they may spread throughout the cavity. However, the 
presence and prognostic impact of free cancer cells in leaked fluid from the 
esophagus (LF-E) remain unclear. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 96 
patients with thoracic esophageal cancer who underwent radical subtotal 
esophagectomy. After the thoracic procedure, the esophagus was placed in a bag 
and removed following the abdominal and cervical procedures. Fluid collected 
from the bag, combined with saline used to rinse the specimen, was defined as 
LF-E and examined cytologically. We evaluated the clinicopathological 
characteristics and prognosis of LF-E-positive (LF-E [+]) patients. LF-E (+) was 
observed in 5 of 96 patients (5.2%), all of whom had pT3 or higher squamous cell 
carcinoma with nodal metastasis and vascular invasion. Among the 44 patients 
with pT3-4a disease, those in the LF-E (+) group had significantly poorer 
regression-free survival (RFS) (P < 0.001) and overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001) 
than those in the LF-E-negative group. Multivariate Cox regression analysis 
identified LF-E positivity as an independent prognostic factor for RFS (hazard 
ratio [HR]: 4.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21-16.2, P = 0.026) and OS 
(HR: 11.9, 95% CI: 2.04-69.1, P = 0.008). The presence of free cancer cells in 
LF-E indicated a poor prognosis in patients with pT3 or higher esophageal 
cancer. LF-E positivity may serve as a new prognostic biomarker.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized small cell lung cancer 
(SCLC) treatment, yet a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of global research 
trends is lacking. This study examines publication patterns, key contributors, 
and emerging research focuses on ICIs in SCLC using bibliometric tools. We 
analyzed 809 articles from the Web of Science Core Collection (1997-2025) with 
VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and Bibliometrix. Publications grew at 9.11% annually, 
with China (304 articles), the USA (201), and Japan (101) as top contributors. 
Leading institutions included the University of Texas System (105 articles) and 
UTMD Anderson Cancer Center (84). Frontiers in Oncology (38 articles) and 
Thoracic Cancer (32) were prominent journals. Key researchers were Wang J (21 
articles, 1,706 citations) and Reck M (15 articles, 4,341 citations). Keyword 
analysis identified four clusters: (1) ICI mechanisms and immune-related 
molecules, (2) chemotherapy combinations, (3) clinical trial designs, and (4) 
ICI efficacy/safety. Burst terms included overall survival, radiation therapy, 
and placebo. Emerging trends highlight multimodal strategies, ICI-radiation 
synergy, and open-label trials. Research hotspots focus on ICI mechanisms, 
combination therapies, trial optimization, and safety. Future directions should 
explore predictive biomarkers, novel combinations, and tailored protocols to 
improve SCLC outcomes. This study provides a roadmap for advancing ICI research 
in SCLC, emphasizing global collaboration and translational innovation.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer remains one of the most prevalent cancers among men 
worldwide, particularly in the context of metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (mCRPC), which poses significant treatment challenges. PARP 
inhibitors offer a promising therapeutic option for patients with homologous 
recombination repair (HRR) deficiencies.
METHODS: This study systematically analyzed 630 registered clinical trials 
related to prostate cancer and PARP inhibitors as of April 25, 2025. A total of 
109 trials were included, focusing on key information such as year of 
initiation, trial phase, targeted populations, and study designs.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate a significant increase in clinical trials 
involving PARP inhibitors from 2012 to 2025. Multi-national collaborative 
studies accounted for 39.4% of the trials, with the United States being the 
principal contributing country. The majority of trials are concentrated on 
targeting PARP1 and PARP2 at various phases of development.
CONCLUSIONS: PARP inhibitors have demonstrated breakthrough advancements in the 
treatment of mCRPC; however, challenges such as resistance and the need for 
personalized therapies persist. Future research should emphasize target 
identification and the exploration of combination therapy strategies to enhance 
clinical efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Adapting interventions to meet the needs and desires of the target 
population is essential to improve intervention uptake and sustainability. 
Herein, we describe the adaptation of Total Wellness, an evidence-based 
lifestyle intervention promoting cancer prevention. We applied NCI's Guidelines 
for Choosing and Adapting Programs and Kreuter's guidelines to culturally tailor 
our program for Black and Hispanic adults.
METHODS: We targeted two adaptations to make the program available to the public 
through an urban recreation system: (i) tailoring class materials to include 
non-cancer-affected individuals and (ii) adding cultural adaptation to meet the 
needs of Black and Hispanic communities residing in an urban city.
RESULTS: One hundred community members (58 Black and 42 Hispanic) participated 
in the adaptation phase through eight focus groups (N = 27), 48 surveys, and a 
4-week pilot (n = 25).
DISCUSSION: The adaptation of the Total Wellness program provides key insights 
into centring community perspectives on nutrition and exercise, cancer 
prevention awareness, and program model components into the translation of an 
evidence-based intervention (EBI) for a real-world setting to improve access for 
underserved communities.

Plain Language Summary: Our goal was to adapt a successful program for a 
different audience. We applied NCI’s Guidelines for Choosing and Adapting 
Programs and Kreuter’s guidelines for cultural adaptation to solicit community 
input to inform program changes. Total Wellness was adapted in two main ways: 
(i) tailoring class materials to include non-cancer-affected individuals and 
(ii) adding cultural adaptation to meet the needs of Black and Hispanic 
communities residing in an urban city. One hundred community members (58 Black 
and 42 Hispanic) provided input on program changes through eight focus groups 
(N = 27), 48 surveys, and a 4-week pilot (n = 25). The adaptation of Total 
Wellness considers how the community feels on nutrition and exercise, cancer 
prevention awareness, and program components to provide a relevant program for 
their community.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play important roles in the progression of 
hepatocarcinoma, while the mechanism underlying the pro-invasive transformation 
of normal fibroblasts (NFs) to CAFs remains poorly defined. lncDILC is a long 
non-coding RNA previously identified to be downregulated in liver cancer stem 
cells. Here, we found that lncDILC was also significantly downregulated in liver 
cancer CAFs compared with NFs. Knockdown of lncDILC in NFs facilitated their 
conversion into CAFs, and enhanced the ability to promote the migration and 
invasion of liver cancer cells. Conversely, overexpression of lncDILC in CAFs 
ameliorated their invasive characteristics, and suppressed cancer cell 
metastasis. Moreover, we found miR-6071 acted as a target of lncDILC, and 
functioned as a transcriptive suppressor of zinc finger protein 395 (ZNF395), 
which exhibited an inhibitory effect on the pro-invasive conversion of 
fibroblasts. Overexpression of ZNF395 reversed the pro-invasive effects induced 
by lncDILC knockdown. These results elucidate a pathway of 
lncDILC-miR-6071-ZNF395 that suppresses the NF-CAF conversion, suggesting new 
therapeutic targets for the strategies for the treatment of liver cancer.

OBJECTIVES: Cervical cancer represents a significant public health concern 
worldwide, particularly among women of reproductive age. According to data from 
the Cancer Registry of the Republic of Serbia for the year 2022, cervical cancer 
is the fourth most common cancer in women, with an age-standardized incidence 
rate (ASIR) of 24.8/100,000 and the fourth leading cause of mortality, with an 
age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) of 10.2/100,000. This study aimed to 
analyse the association between socio-demographic factors, unmet healthcare 
needs, and cervical cancer screening use among women in Serbia.
METHODS: Research was conducted as a cross-sectional study on a sample of 3,980 
women aged 25-64 in Serbia. Three types of questionnaires were used as a 
research instrument. The association of missed cervical smear tests in the last 
3 years with independent variables was examined by univariate and binary 
logistic regression model.
RESULTS: According to socio-demographic characteristics, the likelihood of 
missing a cervical smear test in the last 3 years increased with age, being 
highest among older women (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.88-1.94), lower-income 
categories (OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.74-1.78), and women with the lowest levels of 
education (OR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.47-1.52). The logistic regression model revealed 
significant territorial disparities, with the highest predicted probability for 
women from South and East Serbia (OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.70-1.76). Additionally, 
distance/transportation and financial constraints were significantly associated 
with missed cervical smear tests in the last 3 years (OR = 2.05, 95% CI: 
1.99-2.11; OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.08-1.12, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic disparities in cervical cancer screening remain a 
challenge. This study highlights the need to allocate resources to areas in need 
of improvement and also to conduct comprehensive evaluations of screening 
systems, which can lead to significant reductions in cervical cancer incidence 
and mortality.

Ovarian cancer remains one of the most lethal gynaecological malignancies, with 
paclitaxel resistance being a major therapeutic challenge that limits treatment 
efficacy and patient survival. We found that although the BARD1 level was not 
signi-ficantly altered in patients with ovarian cancer (OC), patients with 
higher BARD1 levels had increased survival time, suggesting that the 
down-regulation of BARD1 may be related to the paclitaxel sensitivity. Through 
examining the expression of BARD1 in tumour samples from paclitaxel responders 
and non-responders, we observed that the BARD1 level was significantly reduced 
in non-responders. CYP2C8 was up-regulated in non-responders. Also, the BARD1 
level was negatively correlated with the level of CYP2C8. BARD1 over-expression 
in OC cells could repress the CYP2C8 expression, while knockdown of BARD1 could 
up-regulate CYP2C8 expression, which could be rescued by H2A-Ub. Results from 
gain and loss of functional experiments indicated that BARD1 functions as a 
tumour suppressor during paclitaxel treatment, and BARD1 down-regulation 
increased the IC50 of paclitaxel from 2.46 nM to 5.33 nM in SK-OV-3 cells and 
from 3.11 nM to 7.51 nM in CaoV-3 cells. We are the first to demonstrate that 
the down-regulation of BARD1 contributes to paclitaxel resistance via 
up-regulating CYP2C8 in patients with OC, which provides a potent target for 
clinical OC treatment.

Prostate cancer (PCa) represents the most common malignancy among men in many 
countries, including the Czech Republic. While most cases are sporadic, 
approximately 10 % are attributed to hereditary factors, particularly germline 
pathogenic variants in genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, ATM, and CHEK2. These 
variants are associated with higher disease susceptibility, aggressive tumour 
behaviour and earlier onset of the disease. In parallel, modifiable and 
non-modifiable risk factors - including age, ethnicity, lifestyle, obesity, 
exposure to environmental carcinogens - also play an important role in the 
development and progression of PCa. This review summarizes the current state of 
knowledge on both genetic and non-genetic risk factors for PCa and emphasizes 
their relevance for clinical risk stratification, early detection strategies and 
prevention. The paper also provides an overview of the implications of 
hereditary PCa in the context of targeted therapy, particularly PARP inhibitors 
and immunotherapy, and discusses how somatic tumour profiling may refine the 
therapeutic decision-making. By integrating epidemiological data, molecular 
diagnostic and recent clinical advances, this review enhances understanding of 
the genetic underpinnings of PCa and advocates for a comprehensive, precision 
medicine approach in PCa management. The review emphasizes the importance of 
early identification of high-risk individuals through germline genetic testing 
and polygenic risk assessment, which can guide screening and personalized 
treatment and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

Nowadays, cancer remains a global leading cause of death, with therapeutic 
advances often hindered by drug resistance and adverse side effects. The 
integration of nanotechnology with immunotherapy has emerged as a promising 
approach to enhance specificity and efficacy of oncological treatments. A key 
immunotherapeutic target is the so-called programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), a 
protein that enables tumors to evade immune surveillance and increase their 
chemotherapy resistance. Interestingly, RNA interference using small interfering 
RNA (siRNA) targeting PD-L1, has shown potential in reactivating anti-cancer 
immune responses. However, efficient delivery of siRNA still faces challenges in 
terms of stability, cellular uptake, and/or targeted release. In this study, we 
developed a multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform based on gold nanorods 
(GNRs) surface-engineered through a layer-by-layer assembly with poly(styrene 
sulfonate), poly(L-lysine), and hyaluronic acid, to provide enhanced stability 
and active targeting towards CD44 receptors overexpressed in cancer cells. 
Within the polymeric multilayers PD-L1 siRNA, doxorubicin and indocyanine green 
were loaded for multimodal therapeutic activity. The anti-tumor effect, siRNA 
transfection efficiency and cell death mechanism of the nanoplatform was 
evaluated on HeLa cells expressing PD-L1 and CD44 and Balb/3T3 fibroblasts. The 
surface-engineered GNRs-based nanosystem efficiently transfected PD-L1 siRNA and 
allowed subsequent application of multimodal chemo-, photodynamic and 
photothermal therapy with enhanced cytotoxicity.

OBJECTIVE: Skeletal metastasis is not only associated with pain but also 
constitutes a prevalent cause of mortality in patients with prostate cancer 
(PC). Accurate evaluation of skeletal disease status is essential in the 
management of PC. This study examines the concordance between 
99mTc-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and 99mTc-Methylene 
Diphosphonate (MDP) scans for detecting skeletal metastases in PC patients.
METHODS: This prospective study evaluated 18 participants with 
histopathologically confirmed PC from July 2022 to July 2024. All patients 
underwent 99mTc-PSMA and 99mTc-MDP single-photon emission computed 
tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) within an average interval of 9.5 
days. Lesions were categorized on an ordinal scale. The Wilcoxon signed-rank 
test was employed for statistical comparison.
RESULTS: The median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at the time of the study was 
85.9ng/ml. The disease was predominantly advanced, with 14 patients (74%) 
exhibiting stage 4b. The Gleason scores were 8-10 (n = 16) and 7 (n = 2). Total 
244 skeletal lesions were detected. 99mTc-MDP identified 233 lesions (95.5%), 
whereas 99mTc-PSMA identified 176 lesions (72.1%). The disparity in lesion count 
across scans was not statistically significant (Z = 1.6, P = 0.11). Area under 
the curve for receiver operating characteristic analysis of 99mTc-PSMA for 
skeletal lesion detection was 0.878, signifying high diagnostic precision.
CONCLUSION: The 99mTc-PSMA scan exhibited comparable efficacy to 99mTc-MDP bone 
scintigraphy in identifying skeletal metastases in PC. The capability to 
identify both skeletal and supplementary soft tissue metastases, together with 
its potential theragnostic applications, establishes 99mTc-PSMA scan as a viable 
comprehensive imaging solution, especially in resource-constrained settings with 
limited PSMA PET/CT access and poor patient affordability.

BACKGROUND: Radioembolization is classically used in patients with 
hepatocellular carcinoma and secondary hepatic malignancies like colorectal 
cancer and neuroendocrine tumors. Up to now, data for other hepatic metastasized 
tumor entities are rare, and it is not clear which clinical and imaging features 
could predict the outcome.
METHODS: Data of 60 patients exceptionally treated with radioembolization 
through the decision of an interdisciplinary board with tumor entities usually 
not treated by radioembolization were retrospectively analyzed. Hepatic features 
on cross-sectional preprocedural imaging, for example, like 
hypervascularization, hepatic tumor burden, maximum diameter, and clinical data, 
were also analyzed during follow-up. Predictive factors were calculated.
RESULTS: Univariate Cox regression showed a significant impact of different 
features on overall survival, for example, primary malignancy histology in the 
case of sarcoma, with 25 months median vs. 6 months median overall survival 
(P = 0.015). Multivariate Cox regression revealed the two key factors for 
overall survival: arterial hypervascularization more than rim enhancement (15 
vs. 6 months, P = 0.011, hazard ratio: 0.339) and hepatic tumor burden below 10% 
(18 vs. 5 months, P < 0.001, hazard ratio: 1.04).
CONCLUSION: Preprocedural hypervascularization of liver malignancies and hepatic 
tumor burden are overall survival predicting factors in tumor entities rarely 
treated by radioembolization. Consideration of these factors can help to carry 
out suitable patient selection in the interdisciplinary board for 
radioembolization.

BACKGROUND: Risk-adapted treatment strategies have been recommended for rectal 
cancer patients. In our previous phase II study, neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 
CAPOX resulted in substantial tumor responses and encouraging survival outcomes 
for locally advanced rectal cancer patients.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the survival outcomes of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with 
locally advanced rectal cancer.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis.
SETTING: This study was conducted at two high-volume hospitals in China (West 
China Hospital and Yunnan Cancer Hospital).
PATIENTS: Patients who were diagnosed with rectal cancer staged as clinical 
T3a-bN0-1M0 (low rectal cancer) or T3a-c/T4aN0-1M0 (middle or high rectal 
cancer) without involved mesorectal fascia and who underwent neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal 
excision between 2015 and 2021 were retrospectively included.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was disease-free survival. The 
secondary outcomes included overall survival, metastasis-free survival, and 
local recurrence. Propensity score matching was used to minimize selection bias.
RESULTS: This multicenter study included 346 patients (191 receiving neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy and 155 receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy). One hundred 
eighteen pairs were matched according to propensity score. Neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy was associated with improved disease-free survival (hazard ratio 
0.51, p = 0.04), metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio 0.47, p = 0.046), and 
overall survival (hazard ratio 0.36, p = 0.03). The rate of local recurrence was 
similar between the groups, with 1 case reported in each group.
LIMITATIONS: Potential selection bias and small number of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy appears to be safe and is associated with 
better survival outcomes compared with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for 
patients who were clinically staged as T3a-bN0-1M0 (low rectal cancer) or 
T3a-c/T4aN0-1M0 (middle/high rectal cancer) without involved mesorectal fascia. 
Our findings provide insights for further investigations of neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy as an alternative treatment strategy for these patients. See Video

BRAF V600E-mutant colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a distinct molecular 
subtype with considerable heterogeneity in tumor biology and therapeutic 
response. Although gene expression-based classifications (BM1/BM2 subtypes) 
provide valuable insights into underlying molecular and immune features, their 
clinical application is limited by the need for high-throughput sequencing. This 
study aims to establish an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based classification 
system to enable practical subtype stratification and aid prognostic and 
therapeutic evaluation. Using two independent cohorts (public dataset, n = 218; 
institutional cohort, n = 122), we performed differential expression analysis, 
machine learning modeling, and clinical feasibility evaluation. Fourteen 
candidate markers were identified, and a decision tree algorithm selected CD8 
and ARHGEF17 as optimal classifiers. Based on these markers, two IHC-based 
subtypes were established: iBM1 (CD8+/ARHGEF17-) and iBM2 (CD8- with any 
ARHGEF17 expression or CD8+/ARHGEF17+). The IHC-based subtypes showed 
concordance with transcriptomic BM subtypes (training: 82.69%, κ = 0.55; 
validation: 72.22%, κ = 0.44; prospective: 83.33%, κ = 0.57). Transcriptomic 
profiling revealed enrichment of immune activation and epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition in iBM1, and cell cycle-related pathways in iBM2. In clinical 
validation, iBM1 was associated with poorer survival but greater sensitivity to 
immune checkpoint inhibitors. This IHC-based classification provides a practical 
and accessible approach for BM subtype stratification, reflecting underlying 
molecular and immune characteristics, and may support prognostic assessment and 
therapeutic decision-making in BRAF V600E-mutant CRC.

PURPOSE: Lung cancer remains a leading cause of mortality globally. This study 
aims to 1) investigate the effects of the Community Empowerment for Lung Cancer 
Prevention Program on participants' knowledge of lung cancer, including risk 
factors, symptoms, screening, treatment, and prevention; and 2) explore lessons 
learned, challenges, and recommendations from program implementation.
DESIGN: A quasi-experimental with one-group pretest and posttest design, 
followed by focus group discussions.
METHODS: A purposive sample of 132 adults aged 18 and above participated in a 
one-day educational program. Participants completed a pretest before and a 
posttest after the program. Focus group discussions were conducted at one and 
three months after the program with nine community leaders, guided by an 
interview protocol.
RESULTS: After the program, participants demonstrated significantly higher 
knowledge compared to before the program. Community leaders were trained to 
disseminate knowledge, with focus group discussions conducted at 1- and 3-month 
follow-ups, revealing that crowded living conditions increased exposure to 
cigarette smoke. Long-term smokers struggled to quit despite awareness. Family 
influence, especially from children and grandchildren, was a strong motivator 
for cessation. Leaders emphasized the need for consistent education campaigns 
and suggested practical strategies such as smoker registration, mobile chest 
X-ray services for older adults, and youth-targeted activities. Financial and 
legal barriers were identified as key obstacles.
CONCLUSIONS: Community-specific strategies are essential for lung cancer 
prevention. Promoting awareness, self-monitoring, and preventive behaviors can 
reduce risk.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Community leaders and family members play crucial roles in 
smoking cessation. Results suggest that sustained education and culturally 
relevant messaging are critical to community empowerment for lung cancer 
prevention.

Cancer cells exhibit metabolic flexibility between anaerobic glycolysis and 
oxidative phosphorylation. Preclinical data showed that metformin, an oxidative 
phosphorylation inhibitor, combined with fasting-induced hypoglycemia led to 
activation of the PP2A-GSK3ß-Mcl1 axis and inhibition of tumor growth. A 
window-of-opportunity trial was designed to evaluate the effect of metformin and 
nightly fasting on proliferation in invasive breast cancer (IBC) or DCIS. The 
primary endpoint is the pre/post treatment change of Ki67 in cancer tissue and 
the co-primary endpoint is the difference in post-treatment Ki67 in cancer 
adjacent DCIS or high-risk lesions. Participants with hormone receptor positive 
IBC or DCIS candidates to surgery are being accrued and randomized to either: 1) 
fasting for ≥ 16 hours nightly, plus nutritional counseling and daily metformin 
with Continuous Glucose Monitoring, or 2) Continuous Glucose Monitoring. The 
intervention lasts 4-6 weeks with gradual metformin ramp up to limit 
gastrointestinal disturbances. The safety of the combination was evaluated as a 
primary interim endpoint. The frequency of Dose Limiting Toxicity (≥G3 adverse 
events related to treatment) was assessed in the first 14 participants in the 
experimental arm. Most adverse events were low grade (G1: 50; 90.9%) and 
unrelated to the treatment (G1: 26 unrelated; 52%). No one discontinued 
treatment due to toxicity and no Dose Limiting Toxicities were observed, so the 
escalation phase of metformin was significantly shortened from 7 days to 3 days. 
The results of this project will expand knowledge of this prevention approach 
and possibly provide the basis for large-scale primary prevention studies in 
at-risk women.

BACKGROUND: Blood-based cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation testing has emerged as 
a promising approach for multi-cancer early detection (MCED), holding the 
potential to improve cancer survival rates. However, traditional bisulfite-based 
methods often encounter sensitivity limitations in detecting early-stage 
malignancies or certain cancer types. In the INSPECTOR study, we developed a 
MCED and cancer signal origin (CSO) system specifically designed for early-stage 
or hard-to-detect cancers, including those of the lung, breast, colorectum, 
liver, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and ovary.
METHODS: We established a comprehensive methylation marker discovery database (n 
= 6,342) by integrating public datasets (n = 4,699) and in-house samples (n = 
1,643), all processed using human TET (hTET) enzyme-assisted whole-methylome 
sequencing (GM-seq). This enabled the design of a targeted panel encompassing 
155,362 methylated CpG sites. Leveraging hTET-assisted high-depth 
next-generation sequencing (NGS), our blood test achieved a median unique depth 
of 1,093×. Multicenter case-control cohorts, including various pathological 
subtypes, were used for training, validation, and independent validation of MCED 
and CSO models, and to verify the clinical feasibility.
RESULTS: Clinical validation was conducted across multi-center case-control 
cohorts, including 1,071 participants in the training set, 581 in the validation 
set, and 824 in the independent validation set. The MCED assay demonstrated 
robust performance with a specificity of 99.1% and sensitivity of 83.2% in the 
training set, 99.0% and 81.8% in the validation set, and comparable results in 
the independent validation set (99.0% specificity, 81.9% sensitivity). Notably, 
sensitivity reached 65.5% for stage I cancers, 79.7% for stage II, and 71.3% for 
stages I-II combined. The sensitivities for different cancer types were as 
follows: esophageal (79.2%), gastric (76.1%), colorectal (86.2%), pancreatic 
(66.7%), liver (100.0%), lung (72.9%), breast (88.9%), and ovarian (87.9%). The 
CSO model exhibited strong accuracy, with top-1 cancer origin prediction rates 
of 87.9% (validation) and 87.4% (independent validation), rising to 95.1% and 
94.5% for top-2 predictions, respectively. For stage I cancers specifically, the 
top-1 accuracy was 85.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the efficacy of the hTET-assisted cfDNA 
methylation sequencing system across diverse cancer types, particularly in early 
stages. Enzyme-assisted NGS test of methylated cfDNA thus enhances the clinical 
utility of non-invasive blood-based screening.

Hepatic intercellular communication is the driving force for the progression of 
chronic Hepatitis B virus (CHB)-associated hepatopathologies, with the dynamic 
molecular mechanisms largely unknown. Combining scRNA-seq and spatial 
transcriptomic analysis, the kinetic landscape of the liver microenvironment 
across time and space in AAV-HBV mice, which develop from inflammation to 
ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma is generated. Kupffer cells (KCs), 
originally resided within the peri-portal area, are persistently recruited to 
the HBV-enriched peri-central region via increased CXCL9 produced by endothelial 
cells, facilitating the interaction between KCs and HBV+ hepatocytes to induce 
LXRα deficiency-mediated lipid metabolism disorders (LMD) in KCs. In turn, KCs 
with LMD elicited cancer stem cell formation from HBV+ hepatocytes via Stat3 
pathway, activated by the chemokine network within the crosstalk. Moreover, 
miR-155-mediated post-transcriptional regulation and ASGR1-dependent degradation 
collaboratively regulated LXRα downregulation in KCs. LXRα deficiency in KCs is 
also detected in the tumor tissues of HBV+ patients compared to that of the 
normal and tumor-adjacent tissue. Importantly, LXRα upregulation in KCs 
constrained fibrosis and cancer stem cell formation. For the first time, the 
role of KC zonation in disease progression has been revealed, highlighting LXRα 
in KCs as a promising target for the early intervention in the transition from 
CHB-induced inflammation to cancer.

Cellular geometry is tightly associated with the function of a cell. During 
tumour progression, cancer cells undergo changes in phenotypes and biological 
behaviour with deformations in cellular morphology. However, whether the 
morphological diversity of cancer cells correlates with the cellular phenotype, 
and the underlying mechanism of morphology-related function in cancer cells is 
still unclear. Here, we simplified the cellular morphology by clustering cancer 
cells into three categories based on two-dimensional cellular morphological 
features. The silence of caveolin-1 (Cav-1), the primary constituent of membrane 
caveolae, reproduced the morphological evolutionary behaviour of cancer cells, 
which is similar to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. The 
attenuation of dorsal stress fibres, the assembly of focal adhesions and the 
disorder of transverse arc fibres and their regulatory signals are demonstrated 
as the main morphological evolutionary tools of cancer cells. Moreover, a 
modified vertex model theoretically reconfirmed the evolutionary process of 
cellular morphology. Small GTPases and focal adhesion kinase signalling were 
implicated in Cav-1 knockdown-induced cytoskeletal remodelling and focal 
adhesion assembly. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that 
Cav-1-dependent morphological changes are closely associated with the 
self-renewal capacity of breast cancer cells. Overall, our work highlights new 
insight into the morphological diversity and the correlation between cellular 
shape and phenotype of cancer cells, and provides evidence that Cav-1 could 
affect cancer cell properties such as self-renewal capacity through maintaining 
the morphological stability.

AIMS: Effective non-communicable diseases prevention and risk reduction require 
a personalised approach tailored to individuals' characteristics. This work 
package of the Joint Action PreventNCD focuses on prevention at the individual 
level, providing evidence on the role that genetic susceptibility, as well as 
behavioural risk factors (such as tobacco use, or physical inactivity) play in 
prevention, and integrating the outcomes into a holistic approach for the 
prevention of cancer and other non-communicable diseases. An overview of 
existing personalised risk-stratified prevention strategies in the area of 
cancer and major non-communicable diseases will be provided, together with their 
ethical, legal and social implications. Finally, we will contribute to the 
development of a health communication framework for the prevention of 
non-communicable diseases, building on the risk communication strategies used 
during COVID-19 pandemic period.
METHODS: To achieve the aims of this work package, a combination of different 
methods will be used, spanning from literature reviews, to public engagement 
activities, to innovative pilot studies covering different genetic and 
behavioral risk factors driving cancer and some other non-communicable diseases 
(namely, genetic susceptibility, tobacco and nicotine consumption, and physical 
inactivity).
CONCLUSIONS: The interventions and activities in this work package will provide 
evidence on how the adoption of prevention strategies based on the concept of 
'personalisation' and 'risk stratification' can contribute to alleviating the 
burden of cancer and non-communicable diseases by targeting the right population 
with the right intervention.

BACKGROUND: This prospective, observational study evaluated the real-world 
safety of osimertinib in a broad Chinese population with non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Chinese NSCLC patients who received osimertinib were enrolled and 
followed up for 12 months. The primary endpoint was the incidence of adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs).
RESULTS: From 20 April 2020 to 1 August 2022, 1,700 patients were enrolled from 
30 centers, with 706 (41.5%) patients ≥65 years old. Osimertinib was 
administered as first-line, second-line, third/later-line and adjuvant therapy 
in 44.9%, 34.2%, 14.3% and 4.5% of the patients, respectively. ADRs, adverse 
events (AEs), Grade ≥3 AEs, and serious AEs were reported in 627 (36.9%), 959 
(56.4%), 165 (9.7%), and 102 (6.0%) patients, respectively. AEs of special 
interests occurred in 59 (3.5%) patients, with 41 (2.4%) and 19 (1.1%) reporting 
QTc prolongation and interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis-like events, 
respectively. The safety profiles in patients ≥65 years old and those usually 
not included in randomized clinical trials were similar to that in the total 
population.
CONCLUSION: This largest real-world safety study of osimertinib in China 
demonstrated that osimertinib was well-tolerated in a broad NSCLC population, 
including patients usually not included in randomized clinical trials, without 
new safety signals identified.

OBJECTIVE: The overall CRC screening adherence rate remains suboptimal, with 
only 58% of screen-eligible individuals in the United States up to date with 
screening. This analysis reports on real-world adherence, test outcomes, and 
turnaround times for the initial large-scale clinical implementation of a 
blood-based CRC screening test.
METHODS: Providers ordered the commercially-available, blood-based Shield 
laboratory developed test (Guardant Health) in their clinics, based on an 
intended use population of individuals at average risk for CRC, aged 45 years or 
older. Retrospective review of laboratory orders and test turnaround times for 
the first 20,000 age-eligible patients was conducted; adherence rate was defined 
as the number of unique blood samples received out of the number of unique 
clinical test orders.
RESULTS: For the first 20,000 age-eligible patients with a test order, 61% were 
female individuals; median age was 59 years (range, 45-99). From 20,000 
patients, 18,901 provided a blood sample, resulting in 94.5% adherence. Test 
positivity rate was 9.2%. Median times from placement of an order to blood 
sample receipt in the testing laboratory and from blood sample receipt in the 
testing laboratory to a results report were 1 day (range, 0-182) and 15 days 
(range, 0-83), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Real-world adherence to a blood-based CRC screening test was 95% for 
the first 20,000 patients, with short median turnaround times for test 
completion by the patient and results return. These results support the ability 
of blood-based options to improve adherence.

INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrating into the 
healthcare field, particularly in lung cancer care, including screening, 
diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. While these applications offer promising 
advancements, they also raise complex challenges that must be addressed to 
ensure responsible implementation in clinical practice. This scoping review 
explores the ethical and legal aspects of AI applications in lung cancer.
METHODS: A search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane 
Library, PROSPERO, OAIster, and CABI. A total of 581 records were initially 
retrieved, of which 20 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the 
review. The PRISMA guidelines were followed.
RESULTS: The most frequently reported ethical concern was data privacy. Other 
recurrent issues included informed consent, no harm to patients, algorithmic 
bias and fairness, transparency, equity in AI access and use, and trust. The 
most frequently raised legal concerns were data protection and privacy, although 
issues relating to cybersecurity, liability, safety and effectiveness, the lack 
of appropriate regulation, and intellectual property law were also noted. 
Solutions proposed ranged from technical approaches to calls for regulatory and 
policy development. However, many studies lacked comprehensive legal analysis, 
and most included papers originated from high-income countries. This highlights 
the need for a broader global perspective.
DISCUSSION: This review found that data privacy and protection are the most 
prominent ethical and legal concerns in AI applications for lung cancer care. 
Deep Learning (DL) applications, especially in diagnostic imaging, are closely 
tied to data privacy, lack of transparency, and algorithmic bias. Hybrid and 
multimodal AI systems raise additional concerns regarding informed consent and 
the lack of proper regulations. Ethical issues were more frequently addressed 
than legal ones, with limited consideration for global applicability, 
particularly in low- and lower middle-income countries. Although technical and 
policy solutions have been proposed, these remain largely unvalidated and 
fragmented, with limited real-world feasibility or scalability.

OBJECTIVE: The RATIONALE-312 trial demonstrated that the combination of 
tislelizumab with chemotherapy significantly improved the survival benefits for 
patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). In this study, 
we used two models to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tislelizumab in 
combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for ES-SCLC patients 
from the perspective of China's healthcare system.
METHODS: Based on the RATIONALE-312 trial data, a Markov model and a partitioned 
survival (PS) model were developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
tislelizumab in combination with chemotherapy as first-line treatment for 
ES-SCLC. The models set a 3-week cycle length and 10-year time horizon. Cost and 
utility values were obtained from the drug data service platform and published 
studies. Primary outcomes measured in the models included total costs, 
life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Furthermore, one-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to verify robustness of the models.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the ICERs based on the Markov model and the 
PS models of tislelizumab group were CNY 216,041.10/QALY and CNY 
206,915.66/QALY, respectively, compared with placebo group. One-way sensitivity 
analysis showed that the most influential parameters on the ICER were the 
utility of progression-free survival, and the cost of etoposide. The PSA 
indicated that at the current willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of CNY 268,074 
per QALY, the probability of tislelizumab being cost-effective in two models was 
93.60 and 86.70%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: At the current WTP threshold in China, the combination of 
tislelizumab and chemotherapy may be cost-effective as a first-line treatment 
for patients with ES-SCLC.

BACKGROUND: Salivary proteomics is a non-invasive, low-cost, and real-time 
diagnostic approach increasingly applied in cancer research. Salivary biomarkers 
hold particular promise for the early identification of gastric cancer (GC). 
This study aimed to detect salivary proteins altered in GC and evaluate their 
potential as novel non-invasive biomarkers.
METHODS: We analyzed salivary proteomes from GC patients (group 1: n = 12; group 
2: n = 13) and healthy controls (n = 11) using isobaric tags for relative and 
absolute quantitation (iTRAQ). Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were 
identified and functionally annotated using gene ontology (GO), Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, and protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) networks. Candidate proteins were further validated by 
parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), and prognostic significance was assessed 
through Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 671 proteins with unique peptide segments were identified. 
Among them, 124 and 102 proteins were significantly differentially expressed in 
GC groups 1 and 2, respectively, compared with controls. Fifty-six overlapping 
DEPs were detected between the two GC groups, including 24 upregulated and 32 
downregulated proteins. Functional enrichment and PRM validation highlighted 
four key proteins (S100A8, S100A9, CST4, CST5) with consistent differential 
expression. Interestingly, CST4 and CST5 were downregulated in saliva but 
upregulated in GC tissue and blood.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that salivary proteins, particularly 
S100A8, S100A9, CST4, and CST5, hold significant potential as non-invasive 
biomarkers for gastric cancer detection. These results provide new insights into 
saliva-based diagnostics and highlight the importance of cross-comparison with 
tissue and blood expression profiles.

PURPOSE: This study evaluated the geometric and dosimetric uncertainties during 
online adaptive radiotherapy (ART) for prostate cancer.
METHODS: Sequential cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans from 52 sessions 
involving 13 patients were analyzed. An ART plan was generated using CBCT1, 
followed by a verification scan (CBCT2) acquired 13.1 ± 3.0 minutes before 
treatment delivery. New contours (prostate, seminal vesicles, bladder, rectum, 
and bowel) were delineated on CBCT2 and transferred to CBCT1 for dose 
distribution analysis. Three dimensional contour variations were quantified, new 
planning target volume (PTV) margins were calculated, and their dosimetric 
benefits were assessed.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in the high-dose volumes (V60 
Gy and V57 Gy) of the bladder and rectum (P > 0.05). PTV margins were 2.6 mm, 
2.4 mm, and 2.6 mm in the lateral, vertical, and longitudinal directions for the 
prostate, and 3.9 mm, 3.8 mm, and 4.3 mm for the seminal vesicles, respectively. 
These margin reductions led to a 37% reduction in the dose to the surrounding 
critical organs, while maintaining consistent target coverage.
CONCLUSION: This study supports symmetric PTV margins of 3 mm for the prostate 
and 4.5 mm for the seminal vesicles in online ART, thereby contributing to the 
development of optimized treatment strategies for prostate cancer.

China.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the dose dependency of asymptomatic 
radiation pneumonitis (aRP) in patients with lung cancer following radiotherapy, 
focusing on the predictive value of dosimetric parameters.
METHODS: This study included 72 patients with primary lung cancer who underwent 
radiotherapy between January 2019 and June 2022. The patients were divided into 
an aRP group (n = 30) and a non-RP group (n = 42). The physical dose was 
converted to an equivalent dose using the Linear-Quadratic (LQ) model, with an 
α/β value of 3. Three lung structures were defined, and the corresponding 
dose-volume histogram parameters were collected. The Mann-Whitney U test was 
used to compare dose parameters between the two groups, and multivariate 
logistic regression was performed to remove correlations among different 
parameters. A logistic function and receiver operating characteristic curve were 
constructed to predict aRP. This study analyzed the impact of different clinical 
characteristics on the aRP incidence.
RESULTS: The lungs-planning target volume (PTV) V15(Gy) was ultimately 
identified as the best predictive parameter. Significant dose-response 
relationships were observed, with V15(Gy) achieving an area under the curve of 
0.666 ± 0.067 (P = 0.017). The optimal cutoff value for lungs-PTV V15(Gy) was 
21.1%, below which the incidence of aRP decreased significantly. Immunotherapy 
has been identified as an independent risk factor for aRP.
CONCLUSION: The occurrence of aRP in patients with lung cancer after 
radiotherapy has a clear dose dependency, with lungs-PTV, V15(Gy) being the best 
dose parameter for prediction, and the optimal cutoff value based on this study 
was 21.1%.

OBJECTIVE: Radiation recall pneumonitis (RRP) is a localized inflammatory 
reaction occurring in previously irradiated lung regions, typically triggered by 
certain anticancer agents. In clinical settings, we have observed that COVID-19 
infection may also act as a precipitating factor for RRP. However, its true 
incidence and possible risk factors remain poorly defined.
METHODS: Lung cancer patients who received radiotherapy and were diagnosed with 
COVID-19 between November 2022 and February 2023 were included. RRP was defined 
as pulmonary changes limited to the previously irradiated regions, occurring at 
least 6 months after radiotherapy. Patients medical records and radiation dose 
distribution data were analyzed to identify potential contributing factors to 
RRP.
RESULTS: The study included 140 patients who underwent thoracic radiotherapy 
with a minimum six-month interval before COVID-19 diagnosis. Among these, 62 
patients (44.2%) developed RRP, and 45% of these experienced grade ≥ 2 
pneumonitis. No radiotherapy dose-related factors were significantly associated 
with RRP. However, statistical analysis showed that RRP incidence was 
significantly associated with baseline T-stage (P = 0.034) and the time interval 
from radiotherapy completion to COVID-19 infection (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: A 44.2% incidence of COVID-19-related RRP was identified, which is 
notably higher than previously reported. While radiotherapy dosimetry did not 
correlate with RRP risk, baseline T-stage and timing of COVID-19 infection after 
radiotherapy were significantly associated with its occurrence.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are pivotal stromal components that shape 
the tumor microenvironment through their remarkable heterogeneity and dynamic 
functions. This review comprehensively examines the biology of CAFs, starting 
with their diverse cellular origins and induction mechanisms via key signaling 
pathways. We highlight the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of CAF subsets and 
propose an updated classification system that encompasses eight functionally 
distinct subtypes based on recent single-cell transcriptomic studies. The 
tumor-promoting roles of CAFs are explored in depth, including their 
contributions to tumor behavior through novel mechanisms such as neutrophil 
extracellular traps formation, and multidrug resistance via metabolic 
reprogramming. A major focus is placed on CAF-mediated immunotherapy resistance 
through immune checkpoint regulation, recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, 
and metabolite secretion. This review also highlights key technologies that are 
advancing CAF research, including patient-derived 3D models, artificial 
intelligence-enhanced spatial multiomics, clustered regularly interspaced short 
palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-engineered mouse systems, and machine learning 
approaches for analyzing CAF heterogeneity and function. Finally, we evaluate 
therapeutic strategies targeting CAF activation, secreted factors, and immune 
crosstalk, while critically analyzing ongoing clinical trials. Overall, this 
review not only clarifies the biology of CAFs but also provides a translational 
framework for developing next-generation stromal-targeted therapies to overcome 
treatment resistance in cancer.

University (Dongguan People's Hospital) Dongguan Guangdong China.

Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, with incidence rising 
steadily worldwide. Although most cases are differentiated thyroid carcinomas 
with excellent prognosis, a small subset, such as anaplastic thyroid cancer, 
demonstrates aggressive behavior and poor survival outcomes. Recent decades have 
witnessed a transformation in thyroid cancer diagnostics and management, driven 
by improvements in high-resolution ultrasound, fine-needle aspiration biopsy, 
molecular profiling, and standardized risk stratification systems such as the 
Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System. Despite these advances, overdiagnosis 
and overtreatment remain key clinical challenges. Accurate risk stratification 
and management strategies are critical, especially for distinguishing indolent 
nodules from aggressive subtypes. This review provides a comprehensive overview 
of thyroid cancer pathogenesis, clinicopathological classification, diagnostic 
approaches, and evolving therapeutic strategies, ranging from active 
surveillance to targeted and immunotherapy-based treatments. By integrating 
molecular diagnostics with conventional parameters, the article underscores how 
precision medicine can reduce treatment burden, improve outcomes, and guide 
personalized care. This review offers valuable insight into the biological 
complexity of thyroid cancer and highlights the need for continued refinement of 
diagnostic criteria and therapeutic frameworks in clinical practice.

Alkaloids exhibit a wide range of anticancer activities, including the induction 
of apoptosis, regulation of autophagy, arrest of the cell cycle, inhibition of 
angiogenesis, and disruption of oncogenic signaling pathways. Among these 
compounds, piperine, a piperidine alkaloid derived from black pepper, 
demonstrates multifaceted activity against colorectal cancer (CRC). Preclinical 
studies indicate that piperine induces apoptosis through mitochondrial and 
reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated mechanisms, arrests the cell cycle at the 
G0/G1 and S phases, and suppresses oncogenic signaling pathways, such as 
Wnt/β-catenin, STAT3/Snail-EMT, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. Furthermore, it 
modulates inflammatory and oxidative stress responses by inhibiting NF-κB and 
activating Nrf2/Keap1 signaling while reducing angiogenesis via Src/EGFR-IL-8 
regulation. These multi-targeted actions result in decreased proliferation, 
migration, invasion, and metastasis of CRC cells. In addition to its intrinsic 
anticancer properties, piperine serves as a potent natural bio-enhancer. 
Combination studies revealed synergistic effects with chemotherapeutics 
(celecoxib, apatinib), radiotherapy, and nutraceuticals (curcumin, resveratrol, 
and cannabinoids), significantly enhancing therapeutic efficacy and overcoming 
drug resistance. However, its pharmacokinetic limitations-poor aqueous 
solubility, rapid metabolism, and low oral bioavailability-pose challenges to 
its clinical application. Pharmacokinetic analyses reveal high lipophilicity, 
extensive distribution, and rapid elimination, necessitating innovative 
strategies to improve systemic stability. Recent advancements include 
nano-formulations (liposomal, polymeric, and lipid-polymer hybrids) and 
structural analogs, which increase solubility, stability, bioavailability, and 
targeted delivery, thereby increasing anticancer efficacy. A comparative 
evaluation with other alkaloids indicates that while piperine exhibits moderate 
direct cytotoxicity relative to agents such as camptothecin or berberine, its 
unique value lies in its broad pathway modulation ability and synergistic 
potential as an adjuvant. Collectively, mechanistic insights, pharmacologic 
evaluations, and combinational strategies establish piperine as a promising 
multifunctional agent for CRC prevention and therapy. Nonetheless, standardized 
preclinical methodologies, detailed pharmacokinetic profiling, and 
well-structured early-phase clinical trials are critical to validate its 
translational potential and facilitate its integration into colorectal cancer 
management.

BACKGROUND: Pentoxifylline (PTX) has demonstrated potential in alleviating 
several adverse effects induced by chemotherapy in preclinical and limited 
clinical investigations. Nonetheless, its efficacy in mitigating the overall 
toxicity associated with doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and taxane (AC/T) 
regimen in breast cancer patients remains uncertain.
METHODOLOGY: This study is an open labelled clinical trial in which the 
participants were randomly assigned to receive either PTX (400 mg three times 
daily) with the standard chemotherapy regimen or standard chemotherapy alone. 
The outcomes of the present study include the occurrence of grade 2 or higher 
peripheral sensory neuropathy and mucositis evaluated according to common 
terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE v5.0).
RESULTS: A total of 106 patients completed the study (PTX: 52; control: 54). The 
incidence of grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy was higher during the 
taxane regimen and was notably reduced in the PTX group relative to controls 
(75% vs. 90.7%, P = 0.03), accompanied by an extended duration until grade 2 or 
higher neuropathy onset in the PTX arm (log-rank P < 0.0001). PTX significantly 
decreased the occurrence of grade 2 or higher mucositis during both the AC and 
taxane phases (P = 0.01 and P = 0.04, respectively) without causing notable 
differences in hematological toxicities or affecting cardiac, renal, or hepatic 
functions.
CONCLUSION: The co-administration of PTX with AC/T chemotherapy in breast cancer 
patients significantly decreases the incidence and postpones the onset of grade 
2 or higher peripheral neuropathy and the incidence of mucositis without causing 
additional risks for the patients.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at

BACKGROUND: Out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) remains a major barrier to 
accessing timely and quality palliative care services in India, particularly 
among low-income urban populations. Limited public funding for home-based 
palliative care further exacerbates the financial burden on families.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the OOPE for home-nursing-family palliative care among 
cancer patients and examine the association of expenditure patterns with 
sociodemographic factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted 
among 400 cancer patients receiving palliative care from a governmental tertiary 
care center in Hyderabad. Data on direct medical, non-medical, and indirect 
costs were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire.
RESULTS: The median total monthly OOPE was ₹4240, with direct non-medical 
expenses (transportation and caregiver wage loss) forming the bulk of the costs. 
Higher expenditure was significantly associated with advanced-stage cancer and 
the absence of government financial assistance (P < 0.05). Female patients and 
lower socioeconomic strata were more likely to experience catastrophic health 
spending.
CONCLUSION: Cancer patients receiving palliative care in Hyderabad face 
substantial OOPE, mainly driven by non-medical costs. Strengthening financial 
protection mechanisms and expanding public funding for community palliative 
services is crucial.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer surgery is a cornerstone in the management of breast 
cancer. The choice of anesthesia can impact surgical outcomes, patient recovery, 
and overall satisfaction.
OBJECTIVES: This study compares the efficacy and safety of combined segmental 
spinal epidural anesthesia (CSSEA) versus general anesthesia (GA) in breast 
cancer surgeries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized comparative study was conducted with 120 
patients undergoing elective breast cancer surgeries, divided into two groups: 
CSSEA (n = 60) and GA (n = 60). Key metrics assessed included intraoperative 
hemodynamic stability, postoperative pain scores, nausea incidence, and hospital 
stay duration.
RESULTS: The CSSEA group showed significantly lower intraoperative blood 
pressure fluctuations, reduced postoperative pain scores at 1, 3, and 6 hours, 
and lower nausea incidence compared to the GA group. Hospital stay was also 
shorter in the CSSEA group.
CONCLUSION: CSSEA offers a viable and potentially superior alternative to GA for 
breast cancer surgeries, with better intraoperative hemodynamic stability, 
postoperative pain management, and faster recovery.

America.

The incidence of diabetes is markedly increasing worldwide. In addition to 
cardiovascular complications, many epidemiological studies have demonstrated 
that diabetic patients have a markedly increased risk of developing many types 
of cancer and several meta-analyses have found that metformin, the most commonly 
prescribed medication for type 2 diabetes, is associated with a lower risk of 
developing several cancers. Therefore, the suggested mechanism of metformin in 
the reduction of breast cancer will be discussed in this review.

BACKGROUND: Hardly any study has been reported in the literature related to the 
occurrence of potentially malignant disorders with respect to the usage of 
smokeless forms of quid.
AIM: To assess the prevalence of potentially malignant disorders and clinical 
correlation with the consumption of smokeless forms of quid.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted among 1800 smokeless quid 
chewers. Detailed habit history of chewing tobacco, arecanut, and both tobacco 
and arecanut was taken. Identification of quid-induced potentially malignant 
disorders was done, which were recorded, namely, homogenous leukoplakia, Betel 
chewer's mucosa, quid-induced lichenoid reaction, Oral submucous fibrosis, 
Tobacco pouch keratosis, and Oral Cancer.
RESULTS: Prevalence of homogenous leukoplakia, betel chewer's mucosa, 
quid-induced lichenoid reaction, oral submucous fibrosis, tobacco pouch 
keratosis, and oral cancer was reported to be (14.1%), (2.5%), (1.2%), (28.4%), 
(26.5%), and (0.2%), respectively. 55% chewers had been using quid containing 
both tobacco and arecanut had been found to be more prone to the occurrence of 
potentially malignant disorders as compared to others chewing tobacco 25.8% and 
arecanut alone 19.2% and the difference was reported to be statistically 
significant.
CONCLUSION: Further studies should be done to find out the actual composition of 
the type and forms of quid, along with its concentration, to analyze their role 
in the occurrence of quid-induced potentially malignant disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Understanding quality of life (QOL) and changes in pain severity 
over time is important to quantify cancer patients' treatment outcomes. However, 
this information is limited, especially in lower-middle-income countries. This 
study aimed to prospectively assess QOL, QOL domains, and pain severity over 
time in patients with advanced breast cancer in Indonesia.
METHODS: Women with advanced breast cancer (n = 160) who were referred to the 
palliative oncology unit were enrolled in the study. They completed the European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL Questionnaire for advanced 
cancer patients (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL) and the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain 
severity at three assessment points, namely, at baseline (T0) and at 3- (T1) and 
6-month (T2) follow-ups. The repeated-measures analysis of variance model was 
used to assess changes over time after adjusting for age, place of residence, 
marital status, and Karnofsky Performance Status score. Change over time was 
classified into three groups, namely, deterioration, improvement, or a small 
difference.
RESULTS: The descriptive analysis showed that the patients' EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL 
mean scores for overall QOL and the functional scales (physical and emotional 
functioning) were fair to good at all assessment points (range: 60-70 points) 
and substantially better at T0 compared to T1 and T2. In addition, most of the 
scores for the symptom scales of the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL indicated lessening 
symptom burden (<10 points), except for pain and fatigue (20-30 points). At the 
same time, overall QOL, emotional functioning, fatigue, dyspnea, appetite loss, 
constipation, and VAS score remained stable over time. Exceptions were found for 
physical functioning (a medium to large deterioration with scores of -16.5 and 
-19.8 points, respectively) and insomnia (a medium improvement with a score of 
-13.4 points), with clinically relevant changes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings from a 6-month longitudinal study show that palliative 
oncology treatment benefitted patients with advanced breast cancer in this 
health facility across several symptom scales.

METHODS: A review of 16 studies from PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science 
(1990-2023) was conducted.
RESULTS: Patients treated with HDR-EBT alone had a pathological complete 
response (pCR) rate of 23.7%-35.3% (mean: 24.3%), anal preservation rate of 
12.2%-74.9% (mean: 41.8%), and 5-year progression-free survival rate of 
64.6%-65.4% (mean: 65.3%). When combined with concurrent long-term radiotherapy 
and chemotherapy, pCR rates improved from 18.1%-55.0% (mean: 31.0%), with anal 
preservation rates of 39.6%-51.4% (mean: 45.3%). However, overall survival did 
not significantly improve.
CONCLUSION: Integrating advanced techniques such as intensity-modulated 
radiation therapy (IMRT) with HDR-EBT shows promise. This approach particularly 
benefits patients ineligible for surgery or those adopting a watch-and-wait 
strategy after complete clinical remission, thus highlighting the potential of 
HDR-EBT in this treatment landscape.

Positron emission tomography (PET) with gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane 
antigen (68Ga-PSMA) has emerged as a promising imaging modality for evaluating 
prostate cancer (PC). Quantification of tumor volume is crucial for staging, 
radiotherapy treatment planning, response assessment, and prognosis in PC 
patients. This review provides an overview of the current methods and challenges 
in the assessment of regional and total tumor volumes using 68Ga-PSMA PET. 
Traditional manual segmentation methods are time-consuming processes that are 
further challenged by inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence 
(AI)-based segmentation techniques offer a promising solution to these 
challenges. AI algorithms, such as deep learning-based models, have shown 
remarkable performance in automating tumor segmentation tasks with high accuracy 
and efficiency. This review discusses the principles underlying AI-based 
segmentation algorithms, including convolutional neural networks, and their 
applications in PC imaging. Furthermore, the advantages of AI-based segmentation 
are highlighted, such as improved reproducibility, faster processing times, and 
potential for personalized medicine. Despite these advancements, AI-based 
segmentation faces significant challenges, including the need for standardized 
protocols, extensive validation studies, and seamless integration into clinical 
workflows. Addressing these limitations is essential for the widespread adoption 
of AI-based segmentation in 68Ga-PSMA PET for PC, ultimately advancing the field 
and improving patient care.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the dosimetric parameters and 
hematological toxicity (HT) associated with bone marrow-sparing (BMS) 
intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in patients diagnosed with 
International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIIC cervical 
cancer undergoing extended-field radiation therapy (EFRT).
METHODS: Patients with cervical cancer presenting with common iliac or 
para-aortic lymph node metastases require EFRT, which often results in grade 3 
HT. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed data of 84 patients with FIGO stage 
IIIC cervical cancer who underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy (EFRT, 
brachytherapy, and weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2) at Harbin Medical University 
Cancer Hospital, including 40 who received BMS-IMRT and 44 who received normal 
IMRT. Dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters and estimated treatment times were 
compared. We also compared acute HT between the normal and BMS groups.
RESULTS: Dosimetric analysis demonstrated that BMS-IMRT significantly reduced 
the mean volume of bone marrow receiving ≥10, ≥20, ≥30, and ≥40 Gy without 
affecting the target coverage of planning target volume and sparing the organs 
at risk. Within the BMS-IMRT group, 37.5% of the patients developed grade ≥3 HT, 
with an increase in HT (HT3+ = 61.4%) in patients receiving normal-IMRT (P = 
0.029).
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with cervical cancer treated with EFRT, BMS-IMRT 
represents a feasible treatment approach that may mitigate HT and facilitate the 
uninterrupted administration of concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of 
breast cancer associated with high recurrence rates and poor survival outcomes. 
Growing evidence suggests that systemic inflammation plays a critical role in 
tumor progression and immune evasion. The pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV), a 
composite index derived from peripheral blood counts, has emerged as a potential 
biomarker of host immune and inflammatory status.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of preoperative PIV 
in Chinese cases with TNBC following curative surgical resection.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 312 TNBC cases treated at 
a tertiary center in China between January 2015 and March 2020. PIV was 
calculated as (neutrophil count × platelet count × monocyte count)/lymphocyte 
count using preoperative blood tests. According to a ROC-derived cutoff value of 
353, cases were stratified into low and high PIV groups. Kaplan-Meier curves and 
Cox regression analyses were used to analyze survival outcomes, like 
disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Confounders for 
multivariate adjustment were selected based on clinical relevance and univariate 
significance (p < 0.10). Model performance was evaluated using Harrell's 
concordance index (C-index).
RESULTS: Cases with a high PIV showed significantly worse survival outcomes. The 
5-year OS was 62.5% in the high PIV group compared with 71.6% in the low PIV 
group. High PIV was also associated with shorter DFS (median 36.8 vs. 45.2 
months, p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis confirmed high PIV as an independent 
predictor of poor OS (HR, 1.75; p = 0.003) and DFS (HR, 1.61; p = 0.009), even 
after adjusting for tumor stage, nodal status, and histologic grade.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative PIV is an independent and accessible prognostic 
biomarker in Chinese cases with TNBC following surgery. Its integration into 
clinical risk models may aid in identifying high-risk cases and tailoring 
postoperative management strategies for them.

BACKGROUND: Although hormone therapy is a cornerstone in the treatment of breast 
cancer, low therapeutic adherence is commonly reported, and there is limited 
evidence on the predictors that contributes to improving adherence in this 
population.
OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with adherence to hormone therapy in 
women with breast cancer, in an oncology clinic in Medellín-Colombia (2019- 
2023).
METHODS: Cross-sectional analytical study. Women >18 years old with hormone 
receptor-positive breast cancer who were undergoing hormone therapy were 
included. The MMAS-8 scale was used to measure and classify therapeutic 
adherence into three levels: low, medium, and high. Data was analyzed by 
multinomial logistic regression.
RESULTS: One hundred seventy-eight patients with a median age of 64.0 years were 
included. 50.0% were treated with tamoxifen. The prevalence of non-adherence was 
48.9%. 70.2% had adverse effects of hormone therapy, and forgetfulness was the 
main reason for discontinuation (76.19%). Age was associated with therapeutic 
adherence, with older women being the most adherent (83.5%). Women with adverse 
effects, stage III-IV, low socioeconomic and educational level, and a lack of 
support network had lower therapeutic adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of moderate and low therapeutic adherence is 
demonstrated in younger women from lower socioeconomic and educational 
backgrounds. Preventive strategies are needed to mitigate factors that 
negatively influence therapeutic adherence.

1) Por qué se realizó este estudio? Este estudio se realizó partiendo de una 
inquietud entre el personal clínico de la institución, al observar que las 
pacientes, principalmente las más jóvenes y con plan de medicina prepagada o 
póliza, no se adherían a la terapia hormonal pese a los beneficios que este tipo 
de tratamiento les ofrecía. Al indagar en la literatura, vimos el vacío de 
conocimiento en cuanto a esta población, tanto en la caracterización 
sociodemográfica como clínica. 2) Cuales fueron los resultados mas relevantes 
del estudio? Con nuestro estudio encontramos una alta prevalencia en 
presentación de efectos adversos del tratamiento, principalmente en los grupos 
de baja y mediana adherencia terapéutica. También observamos que las pacientes 
con condiciones sociodemográficas más favorecedoras mostraron una mejor 
adherencia terapéutica. También pudo confirmarse que el olvido es la principal 
causa por la cual las pacientes dejan de tomar el medicamento. 3) Que aportan 
estos resultados? Estos hallazgos brindan información clínica y sociodemográfica 
valiosa sobre esta población, así como evidencia relevante sobre comportamientos 
y barreras que impactan en su adherencia terapéutica. Este conocimiento resulta 
fundamental para orientar el diseño e implementación de estrategias, 
intervenciones o programas enfocados en mejorar la adherencia al tratamiento

ANTECEDENTES: La terapia hormonal es clave para tratar el cáncer de mama, pero 
se reporta baja adherencia terapéutica y existe poca evidencia sobre los 
predictores que contribuyen a mejorar esta adherencia terapéutica en esta 
población.
OBJETIVO: Identificar factores asociados a la adherencia a la terapia hormonal 
en mujeres con cáncer de mama, en una Clínica Oncológica de Medellín-Colombia.
MÉTODOS: Estudio transversal analítico. Se incluyeron mujeres >18 años con 
cáncer de mama con receptores hormonales positivos, en tratamiento con terapia 
hormonal. Se aplicó la escala MMAS-8 para medir y clasificar a las mujeres en 
baja, mediana y alta adherencia terapéutica. Los datos fueron analizados 
mediante regresión logística multinomial.
RESULTADOS: Se incluyeron 178 pacientes, con edad mediana de 64.0. El 50.0% 
estaba siendo tratado con tamoxifeno. La prevalencia de adherencia incompleta 
fue de 48.9%. El 70.2 % presentó efectos adversos por la terapia hormonal y el 
olvido fue el principal motivo por el que las pacientes dejaban de tomar el 
medicamento (76.2%). La edad se asoció con la adherencia terapéutica, siendo las 
mujeres mayores las más adherentes (83.5%). Las mujeres que presentaron efectos 
adversos, que pertenecían a estadios III-IV, a niveles socioeconómicos y 
educativos bajos y no contaban con red de apoyo mostraron tener menor adherencia 
terapéutica.
CONCLUSIÓN: Se evidencia elevada prevalencia de mediana y baja adherencia 
terapéutica en las mujeres más jóvenes, de estratos socioeconómicos y niveles 
educativos más bajos. Se requieren estrategias preventivas que mitiguen factores 
que impactan negativamente en la adherencia terapéutica.

Transcription factors represent one of the major groups of proteins, whose 
suppression leads to tumor growth arrest. Different types of cancer express a 
specific set of transcription factors that create and maintain unique patterns 
of gene expression. In prostate cancer cells, one of the key transcriptional 
regulators is the HOXB13 (Homeobox B13) protein. HOXB13 is known to be an 
important regulator of embryonic development and terminal cell differentiation. 
HOXB13 regulates the transcription of many genes in normal and transformed 
prostate cells and is also capable of acting as a pioneer factor that opens 
chromatin in the regulatory regions of genes. However, little is known about the 
protein partners and functions of HOXB13 in prostate cells. In the present 
study, we searched for protein partners of HOXB13 by immunoaffinity purification 
followed by high-throughput mass spectrometric analysis (IP/LC-MS) using the 
PC-3 prostate cancer cell line as a model. The main partners of HOXB13 were 
found to be transcription factors with different types of DNA-binding domains, 
including the TBX3, TBX2, ZFHX4, ZFHX3, RUNX1, NFAT5 proteins. Using the DepMap 
resource, we have shown that one of the identified partners, the TBX3 protein is 
as critical for the growth and proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines in 
vitro as HOXB13. Analysis of individual prostate cancer cell lines revealed that 
knockout of both genes, HOXB13 and TBX3, leads to the death of the same lines: 
VCaP, LNCaP (clone FGC), PC-3 and 22Rv1. Thus, HOXB13 and TBX3 can be considered 
together as potential targets for the development of specific inhibitors that 
suppress prostate cancer cell growth.

Publisher: Транскрипционные факторы относятся к одной из главных групп белков, 
подавление активности которых приводит к остановке роста опухолей. В различных 
типах рака экспрессируется определенный набор транскрипционных факторов, которые 
создают и поддерживают специфические паттерны экспрессии генов. В клетках рака 
простаты ключевым транскрипционным регулятором является белок HOXB13 (Homeobox 
B13). Известно, что HOXB13 – важный регулятор эмбрионального развития и 
терминальной клеточной дифференцировки. Он регулирует транскрипцию многих генов 
в нормальных и трансформированных клетках простаты, а также способен действовать 
как пионерный фактор, который открывает хроматин в регуляторных областях генов. 
Однако данных о белковых партнерах и функциях HOXB13 в клетках рака простаты 
очень мало. В настоящей работе мы провели поиск белковых партнеров HOXB13 
методом иммуноаффинной очистки с последующим высокопроизводительным 
масс-спектрометрическим анализом (IP/LC-MS), используя в качестве модели 
клеточную линию рака простаты PC-3. Было обнаружено, что основными партнерами 
HOXB13 являются транскрипционные факторы с разными типами ДНК-связывающих 
доменов, в том числе белки TBX3, TBX2, ZFHX4, ZFHX3, RUNX1, NFAT5. С помощью 
ресурса DepMap мы показали, что один из установленных партнеров, белок TBX3, как 
и HOXB13, критически важен для роста и пролиферации клеточных линий рака 
простаты in vitro. Анализ отдельных клеточных линий рака простаты выявил, что 
нокаут обоих генов, HOXB13 и TBX3, приводит к гибели одних и тех же линий: VCaP, 
LNCaP (clone FGC), PC-3 и 22Rv1. Таким образом, HOXB13 и TBX3 могут совместно 
рассматриваться как потенциальные мишени для создания специфических ингибиторов, 
подавляющих рост клеток рака простаты.

Research on the association between the development of cancer cachexia and 
dietary nutrient intake remains insufficient. We discussed the screening of 
dietary intake risks for cancer cachexia and further investigated the impact of 
vitamin K on the prognosis of cancer cachexia survivors. We ultimately analyzed 
3489 NHANES participants across 10 cycles. Multivariate logistic regression 
analysis and restricted cubic spline (RCS) methods were used to explore the 
relationship between the intake of most dietary nutrients and the incidence of 
cancer cachexia. Further, multivariate Cox regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier 
survival analysis, and RCS analysis were employed to examine the association 
between vitamin K intake and mortality among cancer cachexia survivors. The 
multivariate logistic regression model revealed that vitamin K, dietary fiber, 
β-carotene, food folate, and magnesium might increase the risk of cancer 
cachexia. In contrast, energy, α-carotene, retinol, lycopene, iron, and copper 
might reduce the risk of cancer cachexia. Further RCS analysis showed an inverse 
U-shaped relationship between vitamin K intake and the incidence of cancer 
cachexia. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the high vitamin K 
intake group could reduce the risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.71; 95% CI, 
0.60-0.84; p < 0.0001) and cardiac mortality (HR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54-0.84; 
p = 0.03) among cancer cachexia survivors. The intake of various dietary 
nutrients is associated with the incidence of cancer cachexia. In particular, 
there is an inverse U-shaped relationship between vitamin K intake and the 
incidence of cancer cachexia, and high vitamin K intake may reduce the risk of 
all-cause and cardiac mortality in cancer cachexia survivors.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the dose-response 
relationship between the Hemoglobin-Albumin-Lymphocyte-Platelet (HALP) score, 
which reflects the combined inflammatory and nutritional status, and 
progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), as well as sarcopenia in 
patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 1,441 CRC patients who 
underwent surgery. HALP score was calculated as Hemoglobin (g/L) × Albumin (g/L) 
× Lymphocyte count (109/L) / Platelet count (109/L). Survival analysis was 
carried out using Kaplan - Meier curves and Cox regression analysis. Logistic 
regression analysis was employed to analyze the relationship between the HALP 
and sarcopenia. HALP - based nomograms were developed to predict 1 - and 5 - 
year PFS and OS.
RESULTS: Kaplan - Meier analysis showed that patients with low HALP scores had 
worse PFS (51.2% vs 63.3%, p < 0.001) and OS (54.1% vs 66.0%, p < 0.001). For 
every standard deviation increase in HALP scores, the HR for PFS decreased by 
13.3% (HR = 0.867, 95% CI = 0.780-0.963, p = 0.008), and for OS by 15.2% (HR = 
0.848, 95% CI = 0.759-0.948, p = 0.004). Multivariate Cox regression analysis 
confirmed HALP as an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS. Logistic 
regression analysis indicated that low HALP scores were an independent predictor 
of sarcopenia (OR = 0.550, 95% CI = 0.420-0.963, p < 0.001). The HALP-based 
nomograms demonstrated strong predictive performance for prognosis, with 
C-indexes of 0.726 (PFS) and 0.728 (OS) and 5-year AUCs exceeding 0.76.
CONCLUSION: Low HALP scores are independent risk factors for PFS, OS, and 
sarcopenia in CRC patients, highlighting HALP's potential for clinical 
application in CRC management and may thus assist in personalized treatment 
decisions.

The assessment of nuclear structural changes is considered a potential biomarker 
of metastatic cancer. However, accurately measuring nuclear elasticity remains 
challenging. Traditionally, nuclear elasticity has been measured by indenting 
the cell membrane with a bead-attached atomic force microscopy (AFM) probe or 
aspirating isolated nuclei with a micropipette tip. However, indentation using a 
bead-attached probe is influenced by the cell membrane and cytoskeleton, while 
measurements of isolated nuclei do not reflect their intact state. In this 
study, we employed Nanoendoscopy-AFM, a technique in which a nanoneedle probe is 
inserted into a living cell to directly measure nuclear elasticity and map its 
distribution. Our findings show that nuclear elasticity increases under serum 
depletion but decreases when serum-depleted cells are treated with TGF-β, which 
induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, we found that 
changes in nuclear elasticity correlate positively with trimethylation levels of 
histone H4 at lysine 20, rather than with nuclear lamins expression levels. 
These findings suggest that alterations in chromatin structure underlie changes 
in nuclear elasticity during the progression of cancer.

BACKGROUND: Regorafenib targets tumor angiogenesis and oncogenic signaling by 
inhibiting multiple kinases involved in angiogenesis, oncogenesis, and the tumor 
microenvironment. Chemotherapy of FOLFIRI causes direct cytotoxic damage to 
tumor cells.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of regorafenib plus FOLFIRI 
with uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) genotyping-guided 
irinotecan dose escalation in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) 
who had received second- or third-line systemic therapy.
DESIGN: A total of 153 patients were randomized (at a ratio of 2:1) to receive 
either regorafenib plus FOLFIRI (experimental group, 102 patients) or 
regorafenib alone (control group, 51 patients).
METHODS: Both groups received regorafenib (120 mg daily) for 21 consecutive days 
in 28-day cycles. In addition, the experimental group received FOLFIRI with 
UGT1A1 genotyping-guided irinotecan dose escalation. The primary outcome was 
progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary outcomes were overall survival 
(OS), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse events.
RESULTS: The final cohort included 116 patients. The experimental group 
exhibited significant improvement in PFS (p = 0.016) but marginally significant 
improvements in DCR (p = 0.055). Specifically, PFS improved significantly for 
experimental group patients carrying wild-type rat sarcoma virus (RAS; 
p = 0.003) and those carrying left-sided colon tumors (p = 0.015). A trend 
toward improved OS was noted in experimental group patients carrying wild-type 
RAS (p = 0.096). No significant between-group difference was observed in the 
incidence of severe adverse events (all p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that regorafenib plus FOLFIRI significantly 
improved PFS in patients with mCRC and offers a safety profile similar to that 
of regorafenib alone. This regimen may be particularly beneficial for patients 
with mCRC carrying wild-type RAS and those carrying left-sided tumors. However, 
larger phase III randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm the 
efficacy and safety of this combination therapy before adoption into standard 
practice.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov registry: NCT03880877 
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=NCT03880877).

Plain Language Summary: A new promising combination treatment for metastatic 
colorectal cancer This study explored a new treatment strategy for metastatic 
colorectal cancer (mCRC) in patients whose disease progressed after prior 
therapies. We investigated combining regorafenib, a drug that targets cancer 
growth and blood vessel development, with FOLFIRI chemotherapy, which directly 
kills cancer cells. The FOLFIRI regimen was tailored using a UGT1A1 genetic test 
to personalize irinotecan dosing. In this trial, 153 patients were randomly 
assigned to receive either regorafenib plus FOLFIRI or regorafenib alone. Our 
findings show that the regorafenib plus FOLFIRI group had significantly longer 
progression-free survival (PFS), meaning their cancer was controlled for a 
longer period. This benefit was even more pronounced in patients with wild-type 
RAS tumors and those with left-sided colon tumors. Importantly, the combination 
therapy did not significantly increase severe side effects compared to 
regorafenib alone. These results suggest that combining regorafenib with FOLFIRI 
could offer a valuable new option for mCRC patients, particularly those with 
wild-type RAS and left-sided tumors. However, larger studies are needed to 
confirm these findings and establish this combination as a standard treatment.

Radioresistance results in relapse and treatment failure in locally advanced 
colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. HMGB1 is reportedly associated with 
radioresistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer. 
However, its role in the response of CRC to radiotherapy has not been fully 
elucidated. Thus, we explored the role and underlying mechanism of HMGB1 in CRC 
radioresistance. The total amount of HMGB1 and its translocation from the 
nucleus to the cytoplasm increased after irradiation. Functional studies 
revealed that HMGB1 enhanced the proliferation and autophagy of CRC cells after 
irradiation. Mechanistically, HMGB1 can regulate the transcription factor 
ZNF460, which combines with the BECN1 promoter to promote the release of BECN1 
into the cytoplasm after irradiation. Moreover, HMGB1 directly interacts with 
BECN1 in the cytoplasm, thereby resulting in CRC radioresistance. Finally, the 
protein expression levels of BECN1, which was positively correlated with HMGB1, 
were significantly increased in human CRC tissues and associated with TNM stage 
and poor prognosis in patients with CRC. Our findings revealed that HMGB1 plays 
a vital role in CRC radioresistance by regulating autophagy through binding with 
BECN1. Given the efficacy of HMGB1 modulation in CRC suppression and 
radioresistance, HMGB1 has emerged as a potential therapeutic molecule for CRC 
treatment.

Region, Guilin, China.

BACKGROUND: Cadonilimab, a bispecific antibody targeting programmed cell death 
protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), was 
the first agent of its class to demonstrate promising therapeutic efficacy in 
combination with chemotherapy for patients diagnosed with advanced gastric or 
gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GC/GEJC). This economic evaluation 
aimed to determine whether cadonilimab plus chemotherapy offers cost-effective 
benefits compared to chemotherapy alone from both the U.S. and Chinese 
healthcare payer perspectives. In addition, we estimated the pricing thresholds 
at which cadonilimab would be considered economically viable as a first-line 
treatment.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov model comprising three health states, 
progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD), and death, spanning a 
10-year time horizon. The clinical efficacy data were sourced from the 
randomized phase 3 COMPASSION-15 trial. The cost and utility parameters were 
derived from existing literature. The model calculates total costs, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs). Subgroup, scenario, and sensitivity analyses were performed, and price 
simulations explored cost-effective thresholds at defined willingness-to-pay 
(WTP) levels.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the cadonilimab plus chemotherapy provided 
an incremental gain of 0.33 QALYs at an additional cost of $16,797.61, resulting 
in an ICER of $50,582.10 per QALY, above the WTP threshold of China of 
$40,354.27 per QALY. In the U.S. setting, although the combination therapy 
achieved a slightly higher incremental QALY gain of 0.35 QALYs, the substantial 
additional cost of $101,275.06 resulted in an unfavorable ICER of $290,498.45 
per QALY, exceeding the U.S. WTP threshold of $150,000.00. Among Chinese 
patients with a PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) ≥5, the ICER was lower at 
$37,499.27/QALY, rendering the therapy cost-effective. Simulations identified 
cadonilimab pricing below $209.54/125 mg (China) and $826.46/125 mg (the U.S.) 
as necessary for cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSION: Cadonilimab combined with chemotherapy may be cost-effective in 
Chinese patients with elevated PD-L1 expression. However, its broader use in 
other patient subgroups or countries requires significant price reductions. 
These findings provide important guidance for future reimbursements and pricing 
decisions.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most frequently occurring cancer 
worldwide and the second major contributor to tumor-related mortality, 
frequently metastasizes to the liver due to its unique vascular and anatomical 
features, making liver metastasis a critical therapeutic challenge. Metabolic 
syndrome (MS) is a cluster of conditions characterized by insulin resistance as 
the core feature, specifically manifesting as obesity, diabetes, hypertension 
and dyslipidemia, exacerbates CRC progression through multifaceted mechanisms. 
MS induces mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, 
and Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) methylation abnormalities, collectively 
promoting tumor cell proliferation and invasion. In the liver microenvironment, 
MS-driven metabolic disturbances foster fatty liver formation, alter pH via 
hyperglycemia, and enhance tumor energy supply. Pro-inflammatory factors and 
oxidative stress damage hepatocytes and endothelial cells, while immune 
dysregulation facilitates tumor immune escape. Angiogenic abnormalities further 
support metastatic growth. Recent studies highlight the strong correlation 
between metabolic disorders and colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM). 
Metabolomics has emerged as a pivotal tool for identifying novel biomarkers, 
offering insights for early diagnosis and prognosis optimization. This article 
aims to review the metabolic changes in CRLM by exploring metabolic 
reprogramming, the role of MS in driving CRLM, and the critical importance of 
metabolomics in CRLM. By providing scientific evidence, this review seeks to 
identify novel therapeutic targets and develop personalized treatment strategies 
for patients with CRLM. Furthermore, it aims to further advance the in-depth 
exploration of CRLM-related mechanisms and promote the rapid development of 
clinical translation.

Technology, Vellore, India.

INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of 
cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection and precise diagnosis are 
crucial in improving patient outcomes. Traditional histological evaluation 
through manual inspection of stained tissue slides is time-consuming, prone to 
observer variability, and susceptible to inconsistent diagnoses.
METHODS: To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid deep learning system 
combining Swin Transformer, EfficientNet, and ResUNet-A. This model integrates 
self-attention, compound scaling, and residual learning to enhance feature 
extraction, global context modeling, and spatial categorization. The model was 
trained and evaluated using a histopathological dataset that included serrated 
adenoma, polyps, adenocarcinoma, high-grade and low-grade intraepithelial 
neoplasia, and normal tissues.
RESULTS: Our hybrid model achieved impressive results, with 93% accuracy, 92% 
precision, 93% recall, and 93% F1-score. It outperformed individual 
architectures in both segmentation and classification tasks. Expert annotations 
and segmentation masks closely matched, demonstrating the model's reliability.
DISCUSSION: The proposed hybrid design proves to be a robust tool for the 
automated analysis of histopathological features in CRC, showing significant 
promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in clinical settings.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative frailty in prostate cancer patients represents a 
significant public health concern, as its persistent nature not only impedes 
recovery but also elevates the risk of adverse clinical outcomes. This study 
systematically evaluates the prevalence of postoperative frailty and 
investigates its determinants to establish an evidence-based foundation for 
developing targeted nursing interventions.
METHODS: From October 2024 to March 2025, a convenience sampling method was 
employed to select patients undergoing radical prostatectomy in the urology 
department of a certain tertiary hospital in Wuxi as the research subjects. 
General information questionnaires' the VES-13 frailty scale, Karnofsky 
Performance Status Scale, Sleep Dysfunction Rating Scale, Social Support Rating 
Scale and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale were used for investigation. Univariate 
analysis and binary logistic regression were employed to analyze the influencing 
factors of frailty in postoperative prostate cancer patients.
RESULTS: Among 306 prostate cancer postoperative patients, 39.5% experienced 
frailty. Binary logistic regression showed that age, intraoperative blood loss, 
functional status, exercise frequency (≥3 times/week), anxiety, and social 
support level were the main influencing factors of frailty (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The incidence of postoperative frailty in prostate cancer patients 
is high and influenced by various factors. It is recommended that nursing staff 
actively assess and identify patients, taking proactive measures taking 
proactive measures to intervene and improve or reverse frailty status.

BACKGROUND: Esophageal cancer (EC) is a significant global health concern. 
Chinese medicine injections (CMIs) are widely utilized as adjunctive therapies 
for EC. This network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to compare the efficacy and 
safety of various CMIs in combination with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) 
for the treatment of EC.
METHODS: Relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were comprehensively 
searched in eight electronic databases until August 2024. The quality of 
eligible RCTs was assessed via the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RoB 2.0). 
Bayesian NMA was conducted through R 4.2.1 and Stata 15.1, with treatment 
regimens ranked based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). 
The quality of evidence was evaluated using CINeMA.
RESULTS: 54 studies encompassing 4,201 patients and 13 types of CMIs were 
included. Astragalus polysaccharide injection (HQDT) combined with CCRT (SUCRA: 
86.7%) ranked highest for improving clinical effectiveness rate. Kanglaite 
injection (KLT) combined with CCRT (SUCRA: 85.1%; 90.1%) was optimal for 
enhancing performance status and one-year survival rate. Kangai injection (KA) 
combined with CCRT (SUCRA: 97.2%) achieved the greatest improvement in CD3+ 
levels. Aidi injection (AD) combined with CCRT (SUCRA: 99.9, 99.9%) was most 
effective in increasing CD4+ and CD8+ levels, while Fufangkushen injection 
(FFKS) combined with CCRT (SUCRA: 99.9%) yielded the greatest improvement in the 
CD4+/CD8+ ratio. Based on descriptive statistics, all regimens demonstrated 
favorable safety profiles, with no serious adverse events (AEs) reported.
CONCLUSION: CMIs combined with CCRT appear to provide superior therapeutic 
efficacy over CCRT alone in the treatment of EC. In particular, HQDT, KLT, KA, 
AD, and FFKS exhibited the most pronounced benefits across key clinical 
outcomes. Nevertheless, the findings shall be validated in multicenter, 
better-designed RCTs.

Medical College, Beijing, China.

BACKGROUND: Accurate preoperative staging of gastric cancer (GC) is essential 
for guiding treatment strategies. However, reliable noninvasive tools for 
distinguishing early-stage from advanced-stage GC remain limited.
METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 434 patients with GC. Eleven 
supervised machine learning algorithms were developed using preoperative 
laboratory parameters and engineered ratio features capturing inflammatory, 
metabolic, and tumor-related profiles. CatBoost showed superior performance and 
was selected for SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based interpretation. A 
forward feature selection strategy identified an optimal nine-feature panel. 
Model performance was evaluated by area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with 
robustness validated through repeated 10-fold cross-validation and 1000 
bootstrap iterations.
RESULTS: Among 434 patients, 251 (57.8%) had stage I and 183 (42.2%) had stages 
II-III disease. Incorporating biologically informed ratio features significantly 
enhanced model performance; CatBoost's AUC improved from 0.802 to 0.981. 
SHAP-based selection yielded a compact, interpretable nine-feature model. The 
final CatBoost model achieved a mean AUC of 0.9499 (95% confidence interval 
(CI): 0.9421-0.9570), with high consistency across cross-validation folds. SHAP 
analysis identified uric acid (UA) and APTT as key predictors, and interaction 
analysis revealed stable multivariate relationships, supporting the model's 
biological plausibility.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a robust, interpretable machine learning model for GC 
staging using routine blood tests and derived ratio features. The model 
demonstrated excellent discrimination, interpretability, and clinical utility, 
offering a practical tool for personalized risk stratification and treatment 
planning.

INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is a type of hormone-driven cancer, and pregnancy 
may increase the risk of recurrence in patients due to hormone surge. Our study 
was designed to explore the cancer outcomes of premenopausal women who had 
primary breast cancer and who became pregnant at any time after diagnosis.
METHODS: Searches were conducted in ten databases until July 2024, with no 
language restrictions. We analyzed aggregate data across all study populations 
and performed subgroup analyses by stage, estrogen receptor status, BRCA 
mutation status, HER2 status, previous treatment, lymph node status, interval 
between pregnancy and diagnosis, pregnancy type, reproductive status, and 
breastfeeding status.
RESULTS: Fifty-two studies were included. The pregnancy group had longer overall 
survival (n = 18) [RR = 1.09 (1.06, 1.12), P < 0.001]. Nine studies reported the 
same results [HR = 0.60 (0.48, 0.73), P < 0.001]. The disease-free survival (n = 
7) of the pregnancy group was not significantly longer [HR = 0.90 (0.79, 1.02), 
P = 0.111]. The pregnancy group had longer breast cancer-specific survival (n = 
3) [HR = 0.55 (0.40, 0.76), P < 0.001]. The pregnancy group had a lower 
recurrence rate (n = 17) [RR = 0.61 (0.55, 0.68), P < 0.001]. The pregnancy 
group had a higher loco-regional recurrence rate, although the difference was 
not statistically significant (n = 4) [RR = 1.04 (0.74, 1.47), P = 0.814]. The 
pregnancy group had a lower distant recurrence rate (n = 5) [RR = 0.50 (0.37, 
0.68), P < 0.001]. The pregnancy group had a higher contralateral breast cancer 
rate, although the difference was not statistically significant (n = 3) [RR = 
1.06 (0.76, 1.48), P = 0.742].
DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that pregnancy after breast cancer does not 
lead to adverse cancer outcomes. Stage, estrogen receptor status, therapy choice 
(hormone, chemotherapy, or endocrine therapy combined with chemotherapy), and 
reproductive status are not associated with overall survival. BRCA2 mutation may 
negatively affect disease-free survival in pregnant patients with breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION: The development of therapy resistance and the formation of distant 
metastases represent clinical unmet needs for patients with advanced prostate 
cancer (PCa). The use of drugs for other indications, i.e. drug repurposing, 
shows great promise for cancer treatment. Drug repurposing could allow new 
cancer treatments to be introduced relatively quickly and at lower costs. 
Penfluridol, an approved antipsychotic drug, has strong cytolytic effects in 
multiple cancers.
METHODS: In this study, we have investigated the potential anti-tumor effects of 
penfluridol in preclinical and 'near-patient' PCa models.
RESULTS: Penfluridol significantly reduced the viability of a panel of human PCa 
cells, induced apoptosis by increasing caspase-3/7 levels and decreased the 
number of PCa stem cells in vitro. Penfluridol reduced the viability and induced 
cytotoxic effects in three-dimensional cultures and in ex vivo cultured PCa 
tissue slices (patient-derived xenograft, freshly isolated PCa biopsies). 
Moreover, penfluridol significantly reduced the viability of docetaxel-resistant 
PCa cells and exerted synergistic effects in combination with docetaxel in 
docetaxel-resistant PCa.
DISCUSSION: In conclusion, penfluridol exhibited cytotoxic effects in multiple 
preclinical PCa models. Further research is warranted to address the 
translational value of our findings.

INTRODUCTION: In January 2021, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) received 
conditional approval in the European Union for the treatment of human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2-positive) unresectable or metastatic 
breast cancer in patients who had previously received two or more prior 
anti-HER2-based regimens. In March 2021, a named patient program (NPP) was 
initiated to enable eligible patients to access T-DXd when not yet locally 
available. This European, multicenter, multinational, observational, single-arm 
data collection study included heavily pretreated patients with HER2-positive 
metastatic breast cancer who received T-DXd under the NPP and was intended to 
generate real-world insights from routine clinical practice.
METHODS: Patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer 
who had received ≥2 prior anti-HER2-based regimens and were treated with T-DXd 
(5.4 mg/kg) under the NPP (DS8201-0002-EAP-MA) were eligible for inclusion in 
the study. Participation in the data collection was optional and independent of 
eligibility for the NPP. The primary endpoint was real-world time to treatment 
discontinuation. Secondary endpoints included real-world progression-free 
survival, prior HER2-targeted treatment patterns, reasons for T-DXd treatment 
discontinuation, safety, and antiemetic prophylaxis prior to T-DXd initiation. 
Adverse events were collected via a pharmacovigilance system.
RESULTS: In total, 256 patients (from centers across Ireland, Italy, and Spain) 
participated in the study. At data cutoff (March 28, 2024), 243 patients (94.9%) 
had discontinued treatment. The primary endpoint of median (95% confidence 
interval [CI]) real-world time to treatment discontinuation was 13.0 (11.2, 
15.2) months. Median (95% CI) real-world progression-free survival was 15.2 
(11.9, 17.3) months. The median number (range) of prior anti-HER2 lines of 
therapy in the metastatic setting was 3 (0-6). The main reason for T-DXd 
treatment discontinuation was disease progression (46.1%). Use of an antiemetic 
regimen with prophylactic intent was reported in 80.9% of patients. No new 
safety signals were identified.
CONCLUSION: Results from this real-world study are consistent with the clinical 
benefit observed with T-DXd in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast 
cancer in phase II/III clinical trials in the third-line setting and beyond.

BACKGROUND: The conventional approach for the treatment of locally advanced head 
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) entails the combination of surgery with 
radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. However, the survival rate of patients has 
not improved. This is frequently attributed to the strong invasive and 
metastatic capabilities of the tumor, which makes it prone to recurrence. In 
recent years, neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy has emerged as a focal point of 
research. This is primarily due to its remarkable enhancement of the 
pathological response rate and patient survival. The objective of this study was 
to conduct a retrospective analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in locally advanced HNSCC.
METHODS: The clinical data of 82 patients with HNSCC, who underwent surgery 
subsequent to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy during the period from January 1, 
2019, to May 31, 2024, were retrospectively incorporated in this study. Analyses 
were conducted on the pathological response rate, survival data, and adverse 
events associated with the treatment.
RESULTS: This study enrolled 82 patients in total. The oral cavity was the site 
of malignancies in 41, 50.0% of the cases. Nearly half of the patients (32, 
39.0%) were treated with two cycles of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, while the 
remaining patients received three or more cycles. 78 patients (95.1%) achieved 
R0 resection and 65 patients (79.3%) achieved objective response rate (ORR). The 
pathological complete response (pCR) rate was 25.6% [95% confidence interval 
(CI), 15.3%-35.1%], and the major pathological response (MPR) rate was 41.5% 
(95% CI, 30.4%-52.0%). All patients demonstrated good tolerance of neoadjuvant 
therapy, with a grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse event rate of 14.6%. After a 
median follow-up of 16 (3-48) months, the 1-year disease-free survival rate was 
80.5% (95%CI: 72.4%- 88.6%) and the 1-year overall survival rate was 93.7% 
(95%CI: 88.7%-99.14%).
CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy significantly improves the 
pathological response rate and R0 resection rate in patients with locally 
advanced HNSCC with a low incidence of treatment-related adverse events, and our 
findings suggest its potential as a treatment strategy for locally advanced 
HNSCC.

BACKGROUND: The role of postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in 
non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) prognostic evaluation remains unclear. 
Additionally, the dynamic changes in CEA levels during the perioperative period 
have not been fully characterized.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed stage I-IIIA NSCLC patients who underwent 
curative resection. A latent class growth mixed model was employed to categorize 
patients into distinct CEA trajectory groups. The Kaplan-Meier method assessed 
the relationship between CEA trajectory groups and recurrence-free survival 
(RFS) and overall survival (OS). Multivariate analysis of perioperative CEA 
levels in relation to RFS and overall survival OS was performed using Cox 
proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS: A total of 5733 patients were included in our study. Elevated 
postoperative CEA levels were associated with higher risks of recurrence (HR = 
2.64, 95% CI: 1.65-4.23) and mortality (HR = 3.34, 95% CI: 2.09-5.80) compared 
to normal CEA levels. Furthermore, patients with normal preoperative CEA but 
elevated postoperative levels also had higher risks of recurrence (HR = 3.00, 
95% CI: 1.77-5.10) and mortality (HR = 3.30, 95% CI: 1.79-6.07). Three CEA 
trajectory categories were identified: low-stable, early-rising, and 
later-rising. Compared to the low-stable group, the early-rising group had 
significantly higher risks of recurrence (HR = 10.84, 95% CI: 5.57-21.10) and 
mortality (HR = 13.37, 95% CI: 5.45-32.81). The later-rising group had lower, 
but still significant, risks of recurrence (HR = 3.56, 95% CI: 1.62-7.81).
CONCLUSION: Continuous postoperative monitoring of CEA levels in NSCLC patients 
is essential, especially for those with elevated postoperative CEA levels.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) may rarely present with atypical symptoms, particularly 
in the context of metastatic disease. While the most common sites of metastasis 
include the liver, lungs, peritoneum, and lymph nodes, osseous metastases are 
uncommon, and mandibular involvement is exceedingly rare. We report a case of a 
57-year-old male who presented with several weeks of isolated jaw pain. Imaging 
revealed a destructive mass in the right mandible, and histopathology confirmed 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of colorectal origin. Abdominal imaging and 
colonoscopy identified a fungating, partially obstructing sigmoid mass with 
synchronous liver metastases. Due to extensive disease, surgical resection was 
not pursued. The patient was initiated on systemic chemotherapy with folinic 
acid, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) and bevacizumab, with early 
biochemical and clinical response. This case demonstrates that oral metastasis 
of CRC portends a poor prognosis. Therefore, high clinical suspicion, timely 
diagnosis, and initiation of systemic therapy are essential to optimize patient 
outcomes and maintain quality of life.

Delayed Diagnosis of Non-Bacterial Thrombotic Endocarditis in a Patient With 
Metastatic Lung Cancer.

Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is characterised by sterile 
vegetations on cardiac valves and is most frequently associated with malignancy 
or chronic inflammatory disorders. Diagnosis is challenging, as clinical signs 
typically manifest after embolic complications. We report the case of a 
42-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction and lacunar stroke 
earlier in the year, who presented with chronic cough, progressive dyspnoea, and 
fatigue. On admission, he was tachycardic and tachypneic, with a diastolic 
murmur and bibasal crackles. Laboratory tests revealed normocytic anaemia and 
thrombocytopenia. Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) excluded 
pulmonary embolism but demonstrated a large pericardial effusion, confirmed on 
transthoracic echocardiography, along with severe aortic regurgitation and a 
mobile echodensity on the aortic valve suspicious for vegetation. 
Pericardiocentesis drained 940 mL of haemoserous fluid, and cytology 
subsequently confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of probable pulmonary origin. 
Further imaging revealed bilateral renal and splenic infarcts. Serial blood 
cultures were negative. Given the combination of sterile vegetations, systemic 
embolisation, and advanced malignancy, a diagnosis of NBTE was made. The patient 
was managed supportively, with surgical intervention deferred in view of 
disseminated malignancy and poor prognosis. His condition deteriorated rapidly, 
and he died several days after discharge. This case illustrates the importance 
of considering NBTE in patients presenting with recurrent embolic events, 
particularly in the context of malignancy. Prompt recognition and initiation of 
anticoagulation may reduce the risk of further embolic complications, although 
prognosis remains poor in cancer-associated NBTE.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Male breast cancer (MBC) is very rare, and previous 
reports of brain metastases (BM) from MBC are limited. To date, the genetic 
characteristics of MBC with BM have not been explored. In addition, there is 
only a single case report documenting the use of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) 
for MBC BM. The aim of this study was to summarize genetic alterations 
associated with BM in patients with MBC and evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
SRS in this population.
METHODS: Four male patients with a total of 20 MBC BMs treated with SRS were 
retrospectively reviewed. We defined treatment response as complete response, 
partial response, stable disease, and local progression (LP), per Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. The Kaplan-Meier method 
was used to estimate cumulative incidence rate of LP.
RESULTS: The median overall survival was 16.3 months (95% confidence interval: 
1.4-31.3 months). The mean age at treatment was 59 years (IQR: 56-60.5 years). 
Three patients had estrogen receptor-positive lesions, whereas one patient had 
triple-negative disease. Three patients had notable pathogenic alterations 
(including in AURKA, BRCA1, BRCA2, CCND1, CHEK2, ERBB2, FLT3, RAF1, and SPINK1). 
The median lesion size was 5.7 mm (IQR: 3.9-8.6 mm). The median delivered dose 
was 23 Gy (IQR: 22-24 Gy). Follow-up imaging at 3 months showed a reduction in 
median lesion size (3.3 mm). The percentage of lesions which were classified as 
complete response:partial response:stable disease:LP was 0%:45%:55%:0%, 
respectively. Cumulative 6-month and 12-month local control rates were 100% and 
100%, respectively. Only one lesion demonstrated LP at the last follow-up (15 
months).
CONCLUSION: This is the first report of genetic profiling of MBC with BM and 
excellent SRS outcomes. The receptor status and genetic alterations across our 
patients with MBC BM suggest heterogeneity in disease. Larger studies are needed 
to further explore MBC BM characteristics and treatment outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea is a common condition worldwide, and 
prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer among men. However, the link 
between OSA and prostate cancer remains unclear. This study aims to explore the 
relationship between OSA and prostate cancer.
METHODS: Initially, a multivariable regression analysis was conducted to control 
for potential confounders and assess the impact of OSA on the risk of developing 
prostate cancer. Subsequently, age-stratified analyses were performed to further 
investigate the relationship between OSA and prostate cancer across different 
age groups. Finally, Mendelian randomization was employed to evaluate the causal 
relationship between OSA and prostate cancer risk.
RESULTS: The multivariable regression analysis of the NHANES data showed no 
significant association between OSA and prostate cancer after controlling for 
age, smoking habits, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, 
alcohol consumption, body mass index (OR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.46-1.48; p = 0.49). 
However, age-stratified analysis revealed a significant negative correlation 
between OSA and prostate cancer in the younger population (<60 years) (OR = 
0.07; 95% CI: 0.01-0.74; p = 0.03), whereas no significant association was found 
in the elderly population (≥60 years) (OR = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.69-1.49; p = 0.96). 
Finally, our Mendelian randomization results did not find a causal relationship 
between OSA and prostate cancer (OR = 0.992; 95% CI: 0.876-1.124; p = 0.906).
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that while there is no significant association 
between OSA and prostate cancer in the overall analysis, a significant negative 
correlation exists in the younger population. The lack of significant 
association in the Mendelian randomization analysis may be due to the inability 
to perform age stratification. Further prospective studies and mechanistic 
research are needed to better understand the biological mechanisms underlying 
this association.

PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of clinical radiomics models in predicting 
microsatellite instability-high status in endometrial cancer and to identify 
patients who may benefit from immunotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-two patients with endometrial 
cancer who were consecutively admitted to Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital between 
January 2021 and April 2022 were retrospectively recruited, and 64 were 
excluded. Of the remaining 158 patients, 110 and 48 were randomly divided into 
the training and test sets, respectively. Regions of interest were delineated, 
and radiomic features were extracted from dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted, 
T2-weighted, and apparent diffusion coefficient images. The intraclass 
correlation coefficients, Spearman correlation analysis, Mann-Whitney U test, 
and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were 
employed for feature selection in radiomics models' development. Seven clinical 
risk factors were incorporated into the clinical models. Finally, the 
clinical-radiomics models integrating clinical risk factors and radiomic 
features were constructed. Clinical, radiomics, and clinical-radiomics models 
were developed in the training set using logistic regression (LR), random forest 
(RF), and support vector machine (SVM). The performance of the models was 
evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration 
curves, and decision curve analyses (DCA).
RESULTS: Four clinical factors (progesterone receptor, tumor suppressor gene 
p53, diabetes, and carbohydrate antigen 153) and 15 radiomic features were 
recognized as key predictors of microsatellite instability-high status in 
endometrial cancer. The clinical-radiomics models developed using the SVM 
classifier exhibited the best performance in the test set, achieving an area 
under the curve (AUC) of 0.997, sensitivity of 1.000, specificity of 0.936, and 
accuracy of 0.952. DCA demonstrated that the SVM-based clinical-radiomics model 
achieved a greater net clinical benefit than the clinical and radiomics models 
across threshold probabilities ranging from 0 to 0.405 and 0.585 to 1, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: The clinical-radiomics nomogram constructed using the SVM classifier 
exhibited robust predictive performance for microsatellite instability-high 
status in endometrial cancer. This nomogram may assist in identifying patients 
with endometrial cancer who are likely to benefit from immunotherapy, thereby 
providing a tool for personalized immune management.

Exploration of the barriers, enablers and experiences of opioid management for 
chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) in the general practice setting within the United 
Kingdom: A meta-synthesis.

BACKGROUND: There is insufficient evidence to indicate using opioids in the 
management of chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP), yet ongoing prescribing is 
prevalent and remains a global public health matter. Inappropriate long-term 
prescribing of opioids is associated with side effects and adverse events. This 
article explores the significant barriers and enablers during opioid management 
indicated for CNCP within general practice, in the United Kingdom, and proposes 
recommendations to optimise practice.
METHODS: A systematic literature review of the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
CINAHL, Web of Science and Science Direct were searched. Titles, abstracts and 
full texts were screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Papers were 
evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme qualitative appraisal 
tool.
RESULTS: From 1027 citations, 6 papers were included (n practitioners = 168 and 
n patients = 52). Four key themes were identified: three barriers and one 
enabler. Barriers: general practice healthcare model constraints, relationships 
in primary care and attitudes towards CNCP management. Enabler: 
multidisciplinary team set up.
CONCLUSION: A change in culture from both service providers and service users is 
required to fully embrace the multidisciplinary team observed in general 
practice. Movement away from the traditional model of doctor led management 
needs to occur. Future policies need to prioritise reducing the long waiting 
times observed for specialist pain services. Non-pharmacological opportunities 
and services should also be developed to support patients.

JD(1), DeCamp MM(1).

Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin.

BACKGROUND: Stage I lung cancer is increasingly being treated with sublobar 
resection. However, it is unknown whether patients with airspace invasion derive 
similar benefits. We therefore analyzed the association between tumor spread 
through air spaces (STAS) and survival.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on 421 patients who 
underwent a lung cancer resection between 2018 and 2022 at an academic 
institution. Baseline characteristics were compared between patients who did and 
did not have STAS. Overall survival and disease recurrence were analyzed using 
Kaplan-Meier and Cox models.
RESULTS: Of 421 patients who underwent lung cancer resection, 97 (23%) had STAS. 
There was no difference in STAS based on comorbidities or pulmonary function, 
however, patients with STAS were more likely to have higher pack-year smoking 
histories (47 vs 40 years, P = .041). Patients with STAS were more likely to 
have adenocarcinoma (91% vs 78%, P = .049), larger tumor size (2.6 vs 2.2 cm, P 
= .016), and lymphovascular invasion (46% vs 32%, P = .012). In patients with 
stage I disease, those with STAS who underwent sublobar resection had decreased 
overall survival compared with those without STAS (P = .042) or those who 
underwent lobectomy, regardless of the presence or absence of STAS. Five-year 
overall survival was 73% for stage I patients with STAS who underwent sublobar 
resection compared with 87% in patients without STAS, and 90% in patients 
without STAS who underwent lobectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stage I disease, STAS is associated with decreased 
overall survival in patients who undergo sublobar resection; however, STAS does 
not affect overall survival after lobectomy.

Swyer-James-MacLeod syndrome (SJMS) is characterized by unilateral hyperlucency 
of the lung on chest roentgenogram, unilateral reduction in vascularity on chest 
computed tomography, and unilateral loss of perfusion on pulmonary 
ventilation/perfusion scan. The prevalence of SJMS is reported to be 0.01%, with 
most cases occurring in children and only a few cases in adults. Therefore, SJMS 
associated with primary lung cancer is extremely rare. We present a case of left 
upper lobe lung cancer with SJMS by performing robot-assisted thoracoscopic left 
pneumonectomy.

Evidence regarding the safety of thoracic surgery after COVID-19 is 
insufficient. The postoperative complication rate is high in patients with 
comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who undergo 
thoracic surgery. Herein we report a woman with advanced lung cancer associated 
with severe pulmonary dysfunction with a percentage of predicted forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second of 44.5% and percentage of predicted diffusion 
capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide of 38.9% due to chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease detected after COVID-19. Curative resection was safely 
performed with perioperative management including respiratory physiotherapy, 
inhalation therapy, and adequate preoperative waiting period.

Lung cancer-associated obstructive pneumonia and pulmonary abscess represent 
critical oncologic complications. Effective management hinges on dynamically 
balancing primary tumor control with secondary infection management. Recent 
major advances in targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and novel anti-infective 
technologies have driven a shift towards integrated, multidimensional clinical 
strategies.This review details diagnostic and therapeutic progress for these 
conditions, emphasizing the critical balance between controlling severe 
infections and managing antitumor therapy toxicities, alongside recent advances 
in nanomedicine for pulmonary infections.

Autophagy is a process of engulfing cytoplasmic proteins or organelles, thereby 
fulfilling cells' metabolic needs and the renewal of specific organelles. Given 
its key roles in tumor progression, autophagy has attracted tremendous attention 
in cancer therapies. Notably, there is a megatrend to integrating autophagy 
regulation into mainstream treatments. This review focuses on 
autophagy-targeting nanomedicine (ApT-NM) to modulate autophagy in tumor 
therapy, including the unmodified and functionalized nanoparticles that target 
tumors by carrying autophagy modulators. On the one hand, it can reverse 
treatment resistance by inhibiting protective autophagy, and on the other hand, 
it can promote the death of cancer cells through type II apoptosis by inducing 
autophagy. Moreover, advanced nanoplatforms combining various treatments (such 
as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, photothermal therapy, and photodynamic therapy, 
etc.) have also been summarized. Last, the future perspectives and directions 
for ApT-NM research are provided, hoping to emphasize this rising filed and 
promote the development of ApT-NM.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) triggers immunogenic cell death (ICD) within the 
tumor microenvironment, consequently enhancing tumor immunotherapy. However, the 
maximum absorption wavelengths of first and second-generation PDT 
photosensitizers limit the penetration depth of therapeutics, resulting in 
insufficient anti-tumor outcomes. This study reports a custom-designed polymer, 
PTSQ, which exhibits significant absorption in the near-infrared region (NIR) 
window and fluorescence emission spectra within the NIR II range, demonstrating 
excellent PDT efficiency. Additionally, PTSQ self-assembles into nanomicelles, 
exhibiting outstanding siRNA delivery. To further enhance tumor immunotherapy, 
we introduce an immune checkpoint blockade strategy and prepared PTSQ/siPD-L1 
complexes. We present a novel approach to tumor treatment by combining NIR 
light-activated PDT and ICD to enhance siPD-L1 therapy. At the cellular level, 
PTSQ/siPD-L1 complexes exhibit potent induction of ICD while concurrently 
suppressing PD-L1 gene expression. In vivo, these complexes significantly impede 
the growth of CT26, 4T1, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors. This effect 
is achieved by promoting in situ ICD, which reverses tumor environment and 
activates immune cells in tumors and spleens, including T cells, dendritic cells 
(DCs), and macrophages. Overall, this study offers insights for the development 
of NIR II-guided cancer immunotherapy and underscores the efficacy of PDT in 
conjunction with checkpoint blockade for cancer treatment.

Korea.

This study presents a comparative dosimetric and efficiency analysis of 
volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for large planning target volumes (PTVs) 
(≥1000 cm³), contrasting plans from a flattening filter-free (FFF) Halcyon 
system with a conventional flattened filter (FF) Clinac iX. Retrospective plans 
for 11 rectal cancer patients were evaluated for key dosimetric parameters, 
monitor unit (MU) requirements, and treatment times. While all plans achieved 
comparable PTV coverage, FF plans demonstrated marginally superior dose 
homogeneity. Conversely, Halcyon's FFF plans yielded superior organ-at-risk 
(OAR) sparing, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in mean OAR 
doses. Despite necessitating a substantial MU increase, the 3-arc VMAT treatment 
time was reduced by approximately 62% versus the conventional FF platform. In 
conclusion, for large-volume PTVs, Halcyon-based FFF VMAT offers equivalent 
target coverage with enhanced OAR sparing and markedly accelerated delivery, 
establishing it as a highly efficient and clinically valuable modality.

INTRODUCTION: Ionizing radiation causes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage 
through both direct and indirect mechanisms. This study aimed to investigate and 
quantify the biological response of ion beams in biological matter and the 
radiation-induced DNA damage using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The study 
provides insights into the potential benefits of novel helium ion beams in 
charged-particle cancer therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Geant4-DNA MC toolkit was used to study the 
biological response to radiation and the resulting DNA damage. The MCF-7 breast 
adenocarcinoma cancer cell line was simulated. Helium ion beams with varying 
linear energy transfer values were irradiated onto the cancer cell line.
RESULTS: The radiobiological endpoints, in terms of damage yield and the 
single-strand break (SSB)/double-strand break (DSB) ratio, for the MCF-7 cancer 
cell line were retrieved and compared with published simulation-based studies 
and experimental studies. The damage yield and SSB/DSB ratio in this study were 
in good agreement with published simulation-based studies. However, the DSB 
yield in this study was higher than the experimental results from published 
studies.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the capabilities of the Geant4-DNA MC 
techniques in providing a mechanistic understanding of radiation-induced DNA 
damage in human cancer cell lines and quantifying the resulting DNA damage.

INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in females worldwide. 
Radiation therapy has occupied a very important role in the treatment of women 
with breast cancer in early as well as in advanced stage. Various modern states 
of art radiotherapy techniques are being used for the treatment of breast 
cancer.
OBJECTIVES: The main objective of the study was to compare three different 
radiotherapy treatment planning techniques, namely three-dimensional conformal 
radiotherapy (3DCRT), field-in-field forward planned intensity modulated 
radiotherapy (FIF-FP-IMRT), and inversely planned IMRT (IP-IMRT) in terms of 
various dosimetric parameters.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study involved 150 postmastectomy breast 
cancer patients. Treatment plans with three different planning techniques were 
generated for each patient and were compared for various dosimetric parameters 
of tumor and normal structures.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed for most 
of the dosimetric parameters on comparing three planning techniques.
CONCLUSION: Most of the parameters were found in favor of IP-IMRT. FIF-FP-IMRT 
and IP-IMRT has been found better than 3DCRT.

AIM: This study aims to evaluate and compare the impact of dosimetric parameters 
on lungs, heart, and associated normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) 
values among three different right (RT) prescription doses in patients with 
synchronous bilateral breast cancer (SBBC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: For retrospectively selected five patients diagnosed with 
SBBC, volumetric-modulated arc therapy treatment plans were developed across 
three different fractionation schedules: ultra-hypofractionated (UHF) (26 
Gy/5#), hypofractionated (HF) (40.05 Gy/15#), and conventional fractionation 
(CF) (50 Gy/25#). The dosimetric parameters, including conformity index (CI), 
coverage index, homogeneity index, D95%, and V105%, along with the doses to 
organ at risk (OAR) (lung, heart, left anterior descending artery), were 
assessed. NTCP models were used to estimate the risks of complications.
RESULTS: The dose-volume parameters for OAR exhibited a parabolic trend (χ2) 
with the prescribed dose, showing significant statistical differences across 
various fractionation schedules (P = 0.985, P < 0.001). NTCP models indicated a 
reduction in risks with UHF compared to CF and HF, with probabilities of grade 
≥2 radiation pneumonitis ranging from 2.69% to 6.80% and symptomatic fibrosis 
probabilities from 22.45% to 38.91%, both of which increased from UHF to CF. The 
calculations for biological effective dose and equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions 
showed greater biological effectiveness for late-responding tissues in CF, while 
the impact on tumor control remained more uniform across different fractionation 
schemes.
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence in favor of hypofractionation for 
breast cancer radiotherapy, showing promise in minimizing normal tissue side 
effects.

PURPOSE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common condition with 
respiratory obstructive impairment, and is often treated by primary care 
physicians. Because COPD is a high-risk factor for lung cancer, chest computed 
tomography (CT) is used to screen for early cancer detection. However, it is 
difficult for primary care physicians to conduct regular CT examinations. In the 
western Yokohama area, we have established a system of collaboration between 
primary care physicians and our hospital to manage COPD patients. We 
hypothesized that routine standard-dose CT examinations could detect lung cancer 
at early stage in COPD patients managed by primary care physicians via COPD 
coordinated system.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 114 COPD patients who visited Yokohama Seibu Hospital 
between January 2013 and March 2020 for the purpose of COPD consultation, we 
selected the 70 in whom either abnormal shadows had been detected or negative 
imaging findings confirmed on chest CT over a 5-year period.
RESULTS: Nodules were detected in 15 patients (21.4%) during the course of the 
study, with six of these founded to have lung cancer. Five of the six had were 
operable as early-stage cancer, and one had advanced small cell lung cancer and 
received chemotherapy. Detection of operable cases was difficult with chest 
X-rays.
CONCLUSION: Routine chest CT may contribute to the early-stage detection of 
cancer in patients with COPD managed by primary care physicians in collaboration 
with hospitals.

Traditional Thai herbal medicine has been used for centuries to treat various 
diseases, including cancer. One notable formulation, Santakatpuakaln (STK), has 
been employed to manage cancers, particularly of the gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract, such as liver and colorectal cancers (CRCs). Despite its historical use, 
scientific validation of its efficacy and safety remains vastly limited. In this 
study, we prepared an ethanol extract of STK and evaluated its anticancer 
properties in vitro. STK demonstrated significant cytotoxic activity against CRC 
cell lines (HCT15, NCI-H508, HT29, and HCT116) and the liver cancer cell line 
HepG2 while sparing noncancerous colonic epithelial cells (FHC), suggesting a 
potential therapeutic window. The cytotoxic activity of STK was accompanied by 
apoptosis. Additionally, STK inhibited tumor spheroid growth and suppressed 
HCT116 cell migration in transwell assays, indicating both cytotoxic and 
antimigratory effects. These findings support the traditional use of STK in 
cancer management and warrant further investigation into its active compounds, 
mechanisms of action, and therapeutic potential.

BACKGROUND: De novo metastatic breast cancer (dnMBC) is diagnosed when breast 
cancer has spread at presentation and accounts for 5-10% of cases. The benefit 
of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) after primary tumor surgery in this setting 
remains uncertain.
METHODS: We conducted a review and meta-analysis of observational studies 
published between 2013 and 2024. Two databases (PubMed and Embase) were searched 
and the review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The aim was to evaluate whether 
PORT improves overall survival (OS) in dnMBC patients undergoing surgery. The 
PICOTS framework was applied. Studies were eligible if they compared surgery 
with or without PORT. OS was analyzed at three and five years as a binary 
outcome. The study was not registered prospectively.
RESULTS: Five studies were included qualitatively; three were eligible for 
quantitative synthesis (N=8,557). PORT was associated with improved OS at three 
years (OR=0.62; 95% CI: 0.56-0.68) and five years (OR=0.65; 95% CI: 0.60-0.71). 
Benefits were most evident in patients with bone-only metastases and luminal A 
tumors. No consistent survival advantage was seen in HER2+ or triple-negative 
disease.
CONCLUSIONS: PORT may offer a survival advantage for selected dnMBC patients 
undergoing surgery. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these 
findings and define optimal candidates.

In this article, we proposed a simplified mathematical model of primary tumor 
growth that involves four cell populations: Two types of cancer cells with 
different levels of immunogenicity, and the immune response in its two 
components, innate and adaptive. By varying the proliferation rate of 
non-immunogenic cancer cells and the innate immune stimulation parameter, and 
applying biparametric numerical continuation techniques, we identified distinct 
stability regions that revealed scenarios of tumor escape and latency. A closed 
curve of supercritical Hopf bifurcation points was also detected, delineating 
the parameter region in which limit cycles emerged. By examining the population 
maxima of each cell type at steady state, we identified parameter values at 
which both immunogenic and non-immunogenic tumor cell populations remain in 
stable equilibrium at modest levels, sustained by an immune response that does 
not escalate to intensities associated with immunological damage.

Dissolvable microneedle-based transdermal superficial technique demonstrates 
promised integrative potential for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) therapy, 
yet their insufficient mechanical strength restricts to puncture, attributed to 
the high-density tumor stroma and elasticity of TNBC, limiting long-distance 
therapeutics penetration and profound treatment in situ, posing a significant 
barrier to achieving effective therapy for TNBC management. Inspired by 
biomineralization, herein, a novel strategy is presented for a robust 
microneedle involving manganese phosphate biomimetic mineralization, which is 
characterized by a homogeneous inorganic-organic intercross modification, 
achieving high mechanical strength and solubility. Furthermore, the chemotherapy 
drug, doxorubicin (DOX), can be facilely integrated into this biomimetic 
process, facilitating chemoimmunological microneedles (MD-MN). Subsequently, the 
MD-MN provides high robustness for tumor injection followed by releasing 
manganese and DOX within the tumor, and the manganese can reduce tumor stroma 
and enhance deep DOX infiltration, exerting significant cancer cell apoptosis. 
Furthermore, manganese elements can reverse the immunosuppressive 
microenvironment by activating cGAS-STING, which taken together, constructs a 
boosted cascade chemoimmunological therapy for TNBC. These achievements present 
a successful integrative strategy for circulated cascade chemoimmunological 
treatment for TNBC, indicating a great potential of biomineralization-based 
cancer medicine, further demonstrating insights into biomimetic physiological 
reactions for material construction and translational medicine.

PURPOSE: This study aims to compare the effectiveness and safety of standard and 
reduced initial doses of regorafenib in patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer (mCRC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted 
using the Taipei Medical University Clinical Research Database. Patients aged 
20 years or older who received regorafenib for mCRC between January 2014 and 
December 2021 were included. Patients were divided into standard initial dose 
(160 mg) and reduced initial dose (< 160 mg) groups. Time-to-treatment 
discontinuation (TTD), overall survival (OS), and the incidence of five common 
adverse events were compared between groups.
RESULTS: Among 266 patients, 58 received the standard initial dose and 208 
received the reduced initial dose; the median TTD was 68.0 days and 64.5 days, 
respectively (p = 0.25). The median OS was 9.7 months for the standard-dose 
group and 6.7 months for the reduced-dose group (p = 0.01). In the multivariate 
Cox analysis, the reduced initial dose was associated with shorter survival 
(hazard ratio 1.66 [95% confidence interval 1.22-2.30]). Hand-foot skin reaction 
and total bilirubin elevation were less common in the reduced-dose group 
(p = 0.01 and 0.03, respectively). Excluding concurrent anti-cancer drug users 
led to a similar median OS between the two dosing groups (p = 0.12).
CONCLUSION: No difference in TTD was observed between the dosing groups. The 
reduced-dose group had a shorter OS but fewer adverse events. For patients who 
can tolerate standard doses of regorafenib, a combination of regorafenib and 
other anti-cancer drugs may be beneficial but would require further 
investigation.

In Switzerland, breast cancer screening takes the form of organised programmes 
or opportunistic screening. Current programmes cover fifteen out of twenty-six 
cantons, offer a standardised framework and strict quality control with periodic 
evaluations. Opportunistic screening broadens access but without systematic 
quality control, data or equity of access. In both cases, screening leads to 
earlier detection and reduced mortality of breast cancer but exposes patients to 
the risks of false positives and overdiagnosis. Abstaining from screening 
increases the risk of late diagnosis and heavy treatment. An interprofessional 
approach involving primary care physicians, specialists and public health actors 
is essential to inform women and offer them high-quality screening that is 
better integrated into their care pathway.

Publisher: En Suisse, le dépistage du cancer du sein se décline sous forme 
organisée ou opportuniste. Les programmes actuels couvrent 15 cantons, offrent 
un cadre standardisé, une équité d’accès et un contrôle strict de qualité avec 
des évaluations périodiques. Le dépistage opportuniste élargit l’accès, mais 
sans contrôle systématique de la qualité ni des données. Dans les deux cas, le 
dépistage mène à une détection plus précoce et une réduction de la 
morbi-mortalité, mais expose aux risques de faux positifs et de surdiagnostics. 
L’abstention de dépistage accroît le risque de diagnostic tardif et de 
traitements lourds. Une approche interprofessionnelle associant médecins de 
première ligne, spécialistes et acteurs de santé publique est essentielle pour 
informer et proposer aux femmes un dépistage de qualité, mieux intégré dans leur 
parcours de soins.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify personal, systemic, and 
specifically, geosocial risk factors of breast cancer screening nonadherence and 
to assess how machine learning techniques can improve cancer screening rates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 21 543 women aged 50 to 74 with a 
primary care provider at 15 family medicine clinics in southcentral Pennsylvania 
between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2022. Demographics and healthcare 
utilization data were geocoded to Census blocks for neighborhood socioeconomic 
measures and analyzed using multiple logistic regression to assess association 
with adherence to breast cancer screening guidelines. Area deprivation index 
(ADI) was extracted using machine learning to integrate factors such as poverty, 
employment, education, and housing quality as a measure.
RESULTS: The study identified women in minority groups (aOR: 0.659, P < .01) 
have decreased odds of being screened for breast cancer, with the exception of 
Hispanic individuals (aOR: 1.456, P < .01). Uninsured individuals (aOR: 0.334, 
P < .01) and those on Medicaid (aOR: 0.793, P < .01) are at a greater risk of 
non-adherence to screening. Lastly, ADI and screening rates are inversely 
proportional.
CONCLUSIONS: Social determinants of health influence a person's likelihood of 
being screened for breast cancer. Identifying barriers to screening in these 
individuals, and ways in which they compound, is a crucial step in improving 
screening adherence.

BACKGROUND: The noninvasive prediction of pathological high-risk factors in 
stage I NSCLC patients before surgery remains an area for further investigation, 
and circulating stem cancer cells are a potential predictive diagnostic 
indicator. Identifying these factors preoperatively can guide treatment 
decisions and may improve outcomes. Here, we aim to explore CD133-positive 
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in stage I patients of NSCLC to predict 
pathological high-risk factors of patients, thereby aiding clinical 
decision-making.
METHODS: A total of 192 Stage I NSCLC patients were finally enrolled and 
underwent surgical intervention. We assessed the level of CD133-positive CTCs by 
employing the telomerase reverse Transcriptase-Based CTC Detection method. The 
Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator method (LASSO) and logistic 
regression were used to analyze the association between CD133-positive CTCs with 
pathological high-risk factors and construct a diagnostic model.
RESULTS: Among all the enrolled patients, postoperative pathology confirmed that 
12 patients had pathological high-risk factors, while 180 patients had no 
high-risk factors. The median count of CD133-positive CTCs before surgery in 
patients with high-risk factors was recorded at 1.58 ± 1.83, significantly 
higher than 0.767 ± 1.13 observed in the group without high-risk factors 
(p = 0.048). Following feature selection by LASSO regression and multivariate 
logistic regression, it was determined that CD133-positive CTCs, CT imaging 
nodule features, and elevated CEA levels can be combined as diagnostic 
indicators for pathological high-risk factors in NSCLC patients. The ROC curve 
derived from internal bootstrap validation, alongside the calibration and DCA 
plots, affirmed the model's accuracy and predictive capability. After follow-up, 
we found that patients without high-risk pathological factors showed better PFS 
(p = 0.044).
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that CD133-positive CTCs were associated with 
pathological high-risk factors, and the detection of CD133-positive CTCs may 
assist treatment decision-making for patients of NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION: Cancer patients are increasingly turning to cannabis products to 
modulate physical and psychological symptoms despite limited evidence supporting 
their efficacy. We aimed to explore cancer patients' self-reported anxiety and 
depression symptoms in response to cannabis use.
METHODS: This longitudinal study examined how patient-reported anxiety and 
depression symptoms varied according to the dose, ratio of tetrahydrocannabinol 
(THC) to cannabidiol (CBD), and route of administration of cannabis products 
among cancer patients. Change in self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms 
was evaluated in 1962 cancer patients after 30 days of enrollment in the 
Minnesota Medical Cannabis Program.
RESULTS: Anxiety scores improved more in patients taking higher doses of CBD 
(> 14.3 mg/day) compared to those taking lower doses (< 4.6 mg/day) and among 
patients using enteral cannabis products. Depression scores also improved more 
for patients taking enteral products.
DISCUSSION: Anxiety scores varied according to the dose of cannabis, the ratio 
of THC to CBD, and the route of administration of cannabis products. In 
contrast, depression scores only varied according to the route of 
administration.
CONCLUSIONS: This study of cancer patients in Minnesota suggests that patterns 
of cannabis use that include relatively higher doses of CBD taken enterally may 
improve the quality of life of cancer survivors who report anxiety and 
depression. This study constructs a foundation for future research to improve 
the tailoring of cannabis-related educational materials to patients' needs and 
inform the training of healthcare professionals on how to recommend cannabis 
products for cancer survivors.

PROCEDURE: Retrospective chart review identified children diagnosed with cancer 
at less than 19 years old (2010-2020), who received a cranial radiation therapy 
(CRT) or craniospinal irradiation (CSI) dose of ≥18 Gy or a total body 
irradiation (TBI) dose of ≥12 Gy, and had at least 2 years of post-RT follow-up. 
Logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 
confidence intervals (CI) for outcomes based on demographic and clinical 
predictor variables.
RESULTS: We identified 214 eligible patients. The odds of not being treated 
after a GHD diagnosis were 20.48-times greater (95% CI: 1.15-364) in 
non-Hispanic Blacks than in non-Hispanic Whites. CCS living in neighborhoods 
with the highest ADI quartile (i.e., greatest socioeconomic disadvantage) had 
higher odds (OR = 3.98, 95% CI: 1.05-15.10) of not completing an endocrine visit 
than those in lower ADI quartiles. Those who received CRT and those diagnosed 
with cancer at age ≥12 years had lower odds of being screened, referred to 
endocrine, and prescribed growth hormone than those who received TBI and those 
who were diagnosed at age less than 5 years, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed differences based on socioeconomic status, RT type, and 
age of cancer diagnosis in the likelihood of GHD screening, evaluation, 
diagnosis, and treatment, suggesting the need to investigate contributors to 
these disparities.

The gut microbiome has emerged as an important modulator of cancer progression 
and therapy response, yet the role of its fungal component, the gut mycobiome, 
remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the 
relationship between intestinal fungi and cancer, with a particular focus on the 
potential influence of the gut mycobiome on the efficacy of immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (ICIs). Drawing from both human studies and preclinical models, we 
discuss evidence linking fungal dysbiosis to altered immune responses and 
therapy outcomes in cancer patients. Specific fungal taxa, such as Candida and 
Malassezia, have been associated with changes in the tumor microenvironment and 
modulation of host immunity. We also review the proposed mechanisms through 
which fungi may impact antitumor immunity, including interactions with immune 
receptors and production of bioactive metabolites. Although research in this 
field is still in its early stages, emerging data suggest that the gut mycobiome 
may serve as a biomarker for immunotherapy response and a potential target for 
therapeutic intervention. A better understanding of host-fungus interactions in 
the gut could contribute to the development of personalized strategies to 
improve the effectiveness and safety of cancer immunotherapy.

Gastric cancer (GC) remains a major cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, 
driven by late-stage diagnoses and poor survival outcomes. Leukemia inhibitory 
factor (LIF) and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) are increasingly 
recognized as critical players in GC pathophysiology, though their exact roles 
are not fully understood. LIF, a multifunctional cytokine in the interleukin-6 
family, signals through the LIFR/gp130 complex and activates oncogenic pathways 
such as JAK/STAT3, MAPK/ERK, and Hippo-YAP. Emerging evidence indicates that LIF 
drives tumor progression by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition, immune 
evasion, and chemoresistance. Clinically, high LIF expression is associated with 
poor prognosis, peritoneal metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy and 
immunotherapy. This review explores the molecular mechanisms of LIF/LIFR 
signaling in GC, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and 
therapeutic target. MINI ABSTRACT CONCLUSION: The LIF/LIFR pathway contributing 
to gastric cancer is complex with context-dependent pro- versus anti-tumorigenic 
roles in GC progression, marking it as a significant biomarker and target for 
future therapies.

OBJECTIVE: Using a socio-ecological perspective that includes consideration for 
the effects of the built environment, this study investigated the association 
between neighborhood-level measures of childhood trauma, adult cancer prevention 
behaviors, and cancer mortality in Philadelphia.
METHODS: Cancer registry data and five neighborhood-level risk factors, 
including three measures related to trauma and two indices related to adherence 
to cancer prevention guidelines, were utilized. Multivariate linear regression 
analyses were performed to assess how risk factors relate to variation in cancer 
mortality. Associations between each of the neighborhood risk factors and high 
cancer mortality were identified and visualized geospatially.
RESULTS: Trauma and adherence to cancer prevention guidelines together accounted 
for 50% of the variation in neighborhood cancer mortality in Philadelphia. 
Neighborhoods near each other were likely to have common prevalent risk factors, 
and the majority of neighborhoods with the highest cancer mortality rates were 
also high in trauma measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Results expand upon prior research in this area to the neighborhood 
level, suggesting that neighborhoods with high cancer mortality are more likely 
to have high levels of trauma and low cancer prevention behaviors. 
Neighborhood-level measures of trauma can be used to prioritize and tailor 
trauma-informed cancer prevention efforts.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality 
worldwide. Although immunotherapy has revolutionized lung cancer treatment, its 
efficacy is often hindered by primary and acquired immune resistance. Increasing 
evidence indicates that metabolic reprogramming plays a crucial role in tumor 
progression and the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment 
in both non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer.
METHODS: This review comprehensively summarizes recent preclinical and clinical 
findings on the metabolic alterations associated with immune suppression in lung 
cancer. The major metabolic pathways-glycolysis, lipid metabolism, and amino 
acid metabolism-were systematically analyzed, focusing on their regulatory 
enzymes, signaling pathways, and interactions with immune responses.
RESULTS: Metabolic reprogramming profoundly influences tumor-immune 
interactions. Enhanced glycolysis, dysregulated lipid synthesis and oxidation, 
and altered amino acid metabolism collectively contribute to immune evasion by 
impairing T-cell activation, promoting regulatory immune cell populations, and 
modulating cytokine and checkpoint molecule expression.
CONCLUSION: Targeting tumor metabolic remodeling offers a promising strategy to 
overcome immune resistance and improve the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy 
in lung cancer. Continued efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms linking 
metabolism and immunity may pave the way for novel combination therapies with 
durable clinical benefits.

BACKGROUND: Employment is a critical determinant of quality of life, social 
reintegration, and financial stability for breast cancer survivors. 
International studies have shown that return-to-work (RTW) rates vary widely, 
ranging from 27% to over 80% within the first 3 years postdiagnosis, and are 
strongly influenced by sociodemographic and systemic factors. In Brazil, 
however, there is a scarcity of data on employment outcomes after breast cancer, 
despite pronounced disparities in healthcare access between public and private 
systems. Understanding these dynamics is crucial to identify vulnerable groups 
and to inform strategies that promote equitable reintegration into the 
workforce.
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter cross-sectional study including 454 women 
with nonmetastatic ER+ breast cancer who were employed at diagnosis and 
receiving endocrine therapy. Employment status, sociodemographic and clinical 
variables, and quality-of-life scores were collected through patient-reported 
questionnaires and medical records. Univariate and multivariate generalized 
logit models were applied.
RESULTS: Among 774 participants, 454 (67.1%) were employed at diagnosis. Of 
these, 87 (19.2%) continued working during treatment, 233 (51.54%) stopped and 
returned, and 134 (29.29%) stopped and did not return. Compared with privately 
treated patients who remained employed, those treated in public hospitals had 
significantly higher odds of stopping work and returning (OR = 5.93) and of 
stopping work and not returning (OR = 2.39). Younger age (≤ 60 years) was 
associated with permanent work interruption (OR = 2.39). Lower education was 
associated with temporary interruption (OR = 3.12). Treatment duration ≥ 2 years 
was associated with not returning to work (OR = 2.18).
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment in public hospitals, lower education, younger age, and 
prolonged treatment were associated with a higher risk of job loss. Addressing 
barriers and fostering workplace adaptations is vital for improving 
return-to-work rates among cancer survivors, as nearly one-third do not return 
to work within 2 years postdiagnosis.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the persistent activation of the PI3K/AKT 
signaling pathway in various cancers, with a focus on upstream coactivators that 
drive tumor growth and contribute to therapeutic resistance.
METHODS: An integrated overview of four disparate tumorigenic coactivators of 
PI3K/AKT signaling, namely, TMEPAI (a transmembrane adaptor protein), SALL4 (a 
zinc-finger transcription factor), TCL1B (an oncoprotein coactivator), and TGF-β 
(a cytokine ligand) was identified and analyzed through a comprehensive 
literature review. Their mechanistic insights, signaling interactions, and 
therapeutic opportunities were also summarized.
RESULTS: The study outcomes demonstrate that each of these coactivators 
contributes to PI3K/AKT pathway hyperactivation and cancer progression through 
distinct mechanisms, such as the downregulation of negative regulators or direct 
enhancement of AKT activation. Emerging therapeutic approaches targeting these 
coactivators through gene silencing, small-molecule inhibitors, and 
peptide-based interventions were also outlined, along with associated challenges 
such as drug specificity, toxicity, and resistance.
CONCLUSION: By synthesizing evidence across these diverse molecules, this review 
highlights the convergent impact of multiple molecular classes on the PI3K/AKT 
pathway and outlines future perspectives for leveraging these insights in 
targeted cancer therapies.

BACKGROUND: The impact of commonly used non-cancer medications on breast cancer 
outcomes remains underexplored in large datasets.
AIMS: To evaluate the associations between commonly used non-cancer medications 
and survival as well as adverse events in patients with breast cancer.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Individual participant data from 19 breast cancer clinical 
trials (n = 23,211) were pooled. Cox proportional hazards models and logistic 
regression analyses were used to assess associations between medication use and 
overall survival, progression-free survival and grade ≥ 3 adverse events. 
Analyses were adjusted for demographic, cancer and comorbidity factors.
RESULTS: Proton pump inhibitor use was associated with poorer overall survival 
(HR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08-1.30), progression-free survival (HR 1.11, 95% CI: 
1.02-1.21) and an increased risk of grade ≥ 3 adverse events (OR 1.36, 95% CI: 
1.21-1.53). Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors/ARBs and calcium channel blockers were 
linked with higher adverse event rates but showed no significant impact on 
survival. Statins and metformin demonstrated no significant associations with 
either survival or adverse events.
CONCLUSION: These findings emphasise the need for careful management of 
concomitant medications in breast cancer care and support ongoing research to 
optimise treatment safety and efficacy.

INTRODUCTION: Guidelines recommend starting average-risk colorectal cancer (CRC) 
screening at age 45 years, and thereafter repeating screening tests at regular 
intervals. However, US screening rates are currently suboptimal. This study 
evaluated adherence to repeat CRC screening with the non-invasive multi-target 
stool DNA (mt-sDNA) test among US adults.
METHODS: This was a retrospective claims-based analysis of individuals aged 
45-75 years at average risk for CRC who had previously completed the mt-sDNA 
test. Individuals received the repeat mt-sDNA kit based on a point-of-care 
order. The primary outcome was adherence, defined as the return of a kit with a 
valid result within 1 year. Secondary outcomes included rates of follow-up 
colonoscopy.
RESULTS: The analysis included 352,253 patients. Most patients were female 
(62.1%), White (60.9%), had no comorbidities (76.5%), and underwent one earlier 
mt-sDNA test (98.1%). Overall adherence for repeat screening was 86.2%. In 
logistic regression analysis, higher household income ($100,000-$200,000: 2.05; 
1.49-2.77; > $200,000: 2.46; 1.75-3.40; both vs. < $25,000) and receipt of 
digital outreach (1.36; 1.33-1.40 vs. no digital communications) were associated 
with higher adherence to repeat screening. Mean (95% CI) time to a successful 
result was 35.6 (35.4-35.7) days. Among patients who tested positive, 75.8% 
underwent colonoscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large real-world study, adherence to repeat screening with 
the mt-sDNA test was high. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the 
mt-sDNA test in improving CRC screening adherence.

BACKGROUND: Self-advocacy is crucial for cancer patients, as it allows them to 
express their needs and engage in treatment decisions. This skill enhances the 
quality of care and life satisfaction. Accurately measuring self-advocacy and 
supporting patients with lower skills is essential to improving treatment 
outcomes and promoting patient-centered care. Accurate measurement of 
self-advocacy is vital for identifying patients with lower skills and providing 
support to enhance treatment outcomes and patient-centered care. This study 
aimed to investigate the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the 
Self-Advocacy Scale in Cancer Patients (SACS).
METHODS: This methodological study used a cross-sectional design with 339 cancer 
patients selected through convenience sampling. It examined the scale's face, 
content, construct validity, and reliability after translation and cultural 
adaptation.
RESULTS: The original English version of the Self-Advocacy in Cancer 
Survivorship Scale (SACS) consisted of 29 items, five of which were removed 
based on content validity results. This reduction resulted in the Persian 
version (SACS-P) containing 24 items. These items were grouped into three 
dimensions: informed decision-making, effective communication with healthcare 
providers, and connected strength. The scale showed satisfactory validity, with 
exploratory factor analysis (EFA) revealing three latent factors that accounted 
for 52.85% of the total variance. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed 
the adequacy of the three-factor model. The overall Cronbach's alpha was 0.89, 
and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.75 with a 95% confidence 
interval. Convergent validity was supported by a moderate correlation (r = 0.49) 
with the Persian version of the Patient Self-Advocacy Scale for chronic 
illnesses (PSAS-P).
CONCLUSIONS: The SACS-P (24-item) is a reliable and valid instrument for 
assessing self-advocacy in cancer patients in Iran, suitable for use in both 
research and clinical settings.

Association Between Body Roundness Index and Cancer Risk, With Further 
Stratification by Cardiometabolic Disease Status: Findings From Three National 
Longitudinal Cohorts.

Luo P(1), Lian Y(1).

Author information:
(1)School of Medicine, University of Galway, Galway, Ireland.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the association between body roundness index 
(BRI) and overall cancer incidence in a large population-based cohort and 
explores the consistency of this association in individuals with and without 
cardiometabolic disease (CMD).
DESIGN: A prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Data for this study was extracted from three cohorts: the English 
Longitudinal Study of Aging, the Health and Retirement Study, and the China 
Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study.
PARTICIPANTS: Among 33,624 individuals aged 50 and older, 2999 reported a cancer 
diagnosis.
MEASUREMENTS: BRI was calculated using measured height and waist circumference, 
while cancer and CMD were based on self-reported physician diagnoses. Restricted 
cubic spline curves assessed nonlinearity and identified BRI cutoff points. Cox 
proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between BRI 
and cancer incidence, with subgroup and interaction analyses conducted by CMD 
status.
RESULTS: A non-linear relationship was identified between BRI and cancer 
incidence, with an inflection point at BRI = 5.06. Participants with BRI > 5.06 
had a 10% higher risk of cancer (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.02-1.19) compared to those 
with BRI ≤ 5.06, while increases in BRI below this threshold were not 
significantly associated with risk. This remained consistent across 
CMD-stratified analyses. No significant interaction was detected between BRI and 
CMD status.
CONCLUSION: BRI is associated with cancer risk in a non-linear manner, with 
increased risk above a defined threshold, irrespective of CMD status. These 
findings highlight the potential of BRI as a simple tool for cancer risk 
screening in older adults.

BACKGROUND: BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase B (BUB1B) has been 
found to participate in cancer progression. Nevertheless, the function and 
mechanism of BUB1B in ovarian cancer (OC) remain unknown.
METHOD: Based on datasets GSE14407, GSE18520, and the TCGA combined GTEx 
database, the differently expressed genes (DEGs) between OC tissues and 
para-carcinoma tissues were identified. These DEGs were subjected to 
protein-protein interaction analysis to obtain hub genes, with BUB1B serving as 
a candidate for further study. Subsequently, the prognostic value was analyzed. 
To elucidate the role of BUB1B, knockdown experiments were conducted in vitro 
and in vivo to assess alterations in malignant behaviors, while β-catenin 
expression was quantified by qRT-PCR and western blot. Moreover, the 
Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor LGK974 was utilized to demonstrate whether the 
effects of BUB1B are mediated by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
RESULTS: High BUB1B expression was observed in OC tissues and cell lines, and it 
was identified as a hub DEG with prognostic value in OC. Following BUB1B 
knockdown, cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor growth and 
metastasis were suppressed in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, BUB1B knockdown 
inhibited the expression of β-catenin and inactivated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. 
In addition, BUB1B overexpression promoted the malignant behavior of OC cells, 
which was inhibited by LGK974.
CONCLUSION: BUB1B is an oncogene whose expression level is negatively correlated 
with the prognosis of OC patients. Mechanically, BUB1B promotes the progression 
of OC via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Our study offers a potential therapeutic 
target for OC treatment.

BACKGROUND: The histological differentiation of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
(NSCLC) is a critical prognostic factor that influences therapeutic strategies 
and patient outcomes. However, conventional assessment methods relying on 
postoperative pathology or biopsy are invasive and limited by sampling bias. 
Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to develop a non-invasive, 
imaging-based approach for accurate preoperative differentiation evaluation.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 184 NSCLC patients with preoperative 
chest CT scans and confirmed pathological differentiation grades from 2022 to 
2024. Radiomics features were extracted using PyRadiomics, followed by feature 
selection via the LASSO algorithm. A novel three-task binary classification 
strategy was proposed to replace conventional trinary classification, including 
low vs. non-low, moderate vs. non-moderate, and high vs. non-high 
differentiation. Four machine learning models-GBDT, RF, XGBoost, and 
LightGBM-were constructed and evaluated using ROC analysis, confusion matrices, 
and SHAP-based interpretability analysis.
RESULTS: The GBDT model achieved the highest AUC (0.849) in the low 
differentiation classification task, while the RF model outperformed others in 
predicting high differentiation (AUC = 0.7188). The moderate differentiation 
task showed relatively poor performance across all models (AUC < 0.55). SHAP 
analysis revealed that features such as original_firstorder_Kurtosis, 
glrlm_RunEntropy, and wavelet-HLL_firstorder_Median played key roles in 
differentiating tumor grades, highlighting their biological relevance and 
potential utility in clinical interpretation.
DISCUSSION: The proposed multi-binary strategy improved classification 
granularity and interpretability. Ensemble learning models demonstrated robust 
performance across tasks, especially for extreme differentiation levels.
CONCLUSION: This study, which combines radiomics with a multi-task machine 
learning framework, demonstrates prediction and can improve the accuracy and 
interpretability of preoperative lung cancer differentiation. The proposed model 
provides a non-invasive, quantitative tool with the potential to support 
individualized clinical decision-making. Further multicenter validation and 
multimodal data integration are warranted to enhance its clinical applicability.

Despite recent advances in both preclinical and cancer therapies, the growing 
problem of treatment resistance remains one of the most critical challenges in 
oncology. To overcome the drawbacks of current oncologic treatments, there is a 
pressing need for new approaches and potential therapeutic strategies. The 
interaction between the host microbiome and cancer has recently attracted 
significant research. Among the various routes of microbiome-cancer interaction, 
microbiome- derived exosomes also offer an intriguing avenue. Exosomes, which 
are small extracellular vesicles, originate from several distinct types of 
cells, including microbiome-associated cells. These vesicles participate in 
intra- and intercellular communication as well as alteration of the tumour 
microenvironment. Emphas In light of their possible functions as treatment 
response modifiers and mediators, this review seeks to explain an intricate link 
between cancer therapy resistance and exosomes produced from the microbiome. 
Preclinical studies reveal that microbiome-derived exosomes operate through 
horizontal transfer of resistance-conferring enzymes and TLR4/MYD88-dependent 
signalling, demonstrating 2-5 fold upregulation of resistance-associated miRNAs 
in drug-resistant models. Clinical evidence shows Akkermansia muciniphila 
improves anti-PD-1 immunotherapy outcomes. Fusobacterium nucleatum- derived 
vesicles promote oxaliplatin resistance through autophagy activation. We 
investigate how microbiota-derived exosomes might leverage resistance to 
conventional cancer treatments and their consequences for these treatments. 
However, limitations include inter-individual microbiome variability, 
challenging isolation protocols, and regulatory hurdles under FDA guidelines. We 
examine the possible applications of microbiome-derived exosomes as therapeutic 
and diagnostic tools, thereby reflecting the applicability of these findings in 
clinical practice. This offers an interesting path for new therapeutic 
approaches meant to solve treatment resistance and raise patient survival.

BACKGROUND Reliable venous access is critical for breast cancer chemotherapy, 
yet the optimal choice between peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) 
and implantable port catheters (IPC) remains unclear. This meta-analysis 
compares complication risks associated with these devices in patients with 
breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS A systematic review of randomized controlled 
trials and observational studies was conducted using EMBASE, Cochrane Library, 
PubMed, and ScienceDirect (up to March 2025). Inclusion criteria focused on 
patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy, with outcomes including 
thrombosis, infection, and catheter-related complications. Five studies (n=1125 
patients) were analyzed using the R software, with pooled risk ratios (RR) and 
95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated. Publication bias, as assessed by 
Egger's and Begg's tests, and heterogeneity (I²) were evaluated, and a 
leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the robustness of 
the pooled effect estimates. The quality of the included studies was assessed 
using the ROBINS-I, Jadad scale, and GRADE tools. P<0.05 was considered as 
statistically significant. RESULTS Pooled analysis demonstrated an increased 
complication risk with PICC, compared with IPC (RR=1.75, 95% CI: 1.24-2.46), 
driven by higher thrombosis and infection rates. No publication bias (Egger's 
P=0.411; Begg's P=0.624) was observed. Two large studies showed statistically 
significant risks, favoring IPC, while smaller studies reported non-significant 
trends. CONCLUSIONS IPC is associated with fewer complications in patients with 
breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy, particularly for non-short-term 
treatment. Clinical decisions should prioritize IPC for high-risk patients. 
These findings advocate for IPC use in updated clinical guidelines to enhance 
safety and outcomes in breast cancer treatment.

PURPOSE: The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General (FACT-G) 
questionnaire is frequently used to assess health-related quality of life 
(HRQOL) in cancer patients. However, data obtained using the FACT-G cannot be 
directly used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The newly 
developed FACT Eight Dimensions (FACT-8D) is a preference-based measure that 
generates health utilities scores from 9 of the 27 FACT-G items, representing 
eight HRQOL domains (Nausea, Pain, Fatigue, Sleep, Work, Worry, Sadness, Support 
from family/friends). This study aimed to create a Japanese FACT-8D value set.
METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of the Japanese general population 
recruited participants via a Japanese online panel, quota sampled by age (≥ 18 
years) and sex. FACT-8D valuation data were collected with a discrete choice 
experiment. The valuation task required each participant to consider 16 pairs of 
hypothetical health states, randomly assigned per participant from 800 
choice-sets. Preference weights were obtained from conditional logit models by 
dividing estimated HRQOL coefficients by the life duration coefficient.
RESULTS: Data from 2320 participants were used to assess sample 
representativeness and estimate the Japanese value set. All preference weights 
other than Worry Level 2 were negative and increased in absolute terms in 
progressively higher levels of adverse HRQOL impact. The most influential 
domains for health utilities were Pain and Nausea, followed by Work problems. 
Fatigue, Sleep, Support, Sadness, and health Worry had moderate influences on 
health utilities. The lowest score, for the pit state [55555555], was − 0.60. 
This value is much lower than that of the EORTC QLU-C10D pit state [4444444444], 
-0.22. Health states were consistently scored higher in the USA, Australia and 
the UK than in Japan. Canadian health states are generally lower than for Japan, 
but not universally so.
CONCLUSIONS: We established the Japanese FACT-8D value set based on the 
internationally common protocol. The value set provides another option for 
quantifying health utilities for cancer outcomes. This contributes to improving 
the feasibility of deriving health utilities from the widely used FACT-G.

BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is considered a highly 
heterogeneous disease. Androgen receptor (AR)-positive TNBC is a subtype with 
distinct molecular features. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the 
modulation of the AR signaling pathway in TNBC is still elusive.
RESULTS: BPTF-associated protein of 18 kDa (BAP18) was significantly upregulated 
in AR-positive TNBC samples and was positively correlated with advanced disease 
stage and poor prognosis. BAP18 was shown to act as a transcriptional 
corepressor of AR in AR-positive TNBC cells and is involved in the promotion of 
AR-positive TNBC. Mechanically, BAP18 associates with AR and the SIN3A/HDAC 
subcomplex. BAP18 facilitates the recruitment of SIN3A/HDAC to androgen response 
elements (AREs) in the promoter regions of P21 and PTEN, subsequently leading to 
a reduced level of histone H4 acetylation on AREs.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that BAP18, which acts as a novel AR corepressor, 
is involved in AR-positive TNBC progression, suggesting that BAP18 could be a 
potential therapeutic target for AR-positive TNBC patients.

Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) exhibits strong immune evasion and plays a 
critical role in regulating metabolic reprogramming within prostate cancer. High 
infiltration of CD36 + M2 tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) and elevated CD47 
expression in NEPC cells are often associated with poor progression-free 
survival in cancer patients. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate 
CD36 + M2 TAM infiltration and high CD47 expression in tumour cells within the 
prostate cancer tumour microenvironment (TME) is essential. Using cell models 
and two animal models, we discovered that the IL-8/CXCR2 pathway increases 
acetyl-CoA levels through metabolic reprogramming, which subsequently increases 
CD47 expression via acetylation. Moreover, this pathway modulates the membrane 
localization of CD47 by stimulating tumour cells to secrete palmitic acid and 
utilize palmitoylation mechanisms, thereby protecting tumour cells from 
macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. The IL-8/CXCR2 pathway also reshapes the 
metabolic microenvironment of the TME, increasing the infiltration of ω-3/6 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the TME, which promotes the recruitment 
of CD36 + M2 TAMs. Preclinical studies in both NSG and C57BL/6 animal models 
demonstrated that targeting CXCR2 restored TAM phagocytic activity and 
significantly reduced tumour growth. These findings suggest that CXCR2-targeted 
immunotherapy holds promising therapeutic potential for prostate cancer and 
underscores its importance in translational medicine.

BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional (3D) culture captures key features of tumor 
architecture and microenvironmental signaling. Because microRNAs (miRNAs) are 
central post-transcriptional regulators, we asked whether 3D growth would reveal 
disease-relevant lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA programs in BT-474 luminal breast cancer 
cells.
METHODS: BT-474 cells were profiled with GeneChip miRNA 4.0 microarrays to 
compare 3D versus 2D conditions. We then performed an integrative analysis 
consisting of: (i) extracting miRNA-mRNA interactions from miRNet and ENCORI 
(predicted and curated) for the differentially expressed miRNAs; (ii) 
identifying inverse miRNA-mRNA pairs (miRNA downregulated with target mRNA 
upregulated, or the reverse) using public mRNA data from BT-474 3D versus 2D 
cultures so that pairs were consistent with regulatory repression; and (iii) 
retaining only those miRNA-mRNA pairs that also appeared in miRNet/ENCORI. In a 
separate step, we examined public luminal breast tumor datasets versus BT-474 2D 
cultures to determine which 3D-identified miRNAs showed a similar direction of 
expression change in luminal tumors, thereby prioritizing signals with putative 
in vivo relevance. Finally, to enhance biological plausibility, we incorporated 
an lncRNA layer by leveraging their miRNA ""sponge"" (ceRNA) activity, and we 
assembled an integrated miRNA-mRNA-lncRNA network. Key miRNAs from this network 
were then evaluated for expression in external TCGA cohorts and for diagnostic 
potential using area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis.
RESULTS: Our data reveal a reprogramming of miRNA expression between 3D and 2D 
cultures. Using a threshold of FC > 1.5 and p < 0.05, we found 75 miRNAs 
upregulated and 82 downregulated in 3D relative to 2D. To strengthen biological 
interpretation, we integrated our miRNA expression data with public mRNA 
profiles from BT-474 cells cultured in 3D versus 2D. We then cross-referenced 
interactions reported in miRNet and ENCORI, retaining only miRNA-mRNA pairs 
showing inverse regulation. This integrative layer yielded a pathway-level view 
in which 3D-modulated miRNAs collectively favored proliferative programs, 
ESR1/estrogen signaling, MAPK/JNK activity, cell-cycle control, and 
extracellular-matrix remodeling, with relative attenuation of EGFR/TGF-β 
signaling. Together, the inferred miRNA-mRNA network supports a shift toward a 
more tumor-like, transcriptionally active state in 3D. To reinforce 
translational relevance, we cross-referenced public luminal breast tumor 
datasets with BT-474 2D cultures and identified 14 miRNAs in common, with the 
same direction of change as observed in 3D cultures. From these, we assembled 
co-regulatory networks linking miRNAs to their mRNA targets and to lncRNAs. This 
analysis highlighted four key miRNA nodes: miR-92a-3p, miR-539-5p, miR-18a-5p, 
and miR-130a-3p, which are connected to 58 mRNAs and modulated by 12 lncRNAs. 
The hubs converge on pathways for growth and survival via the RTK-MAPK axis, 
estrogen signaling, and fibronectin/adhesion-mechanotransduction processes, 
depicting a proliferative, mechano-responsive phenotype. Additionally, these 
miRNAs emerged as potential biomarker candidates: in TCGA datasets, miR-539-5p, 
miR-18a-5p, and miR-130a-3p are repressed in luminal breast tumors compared to 
normal breast tissue, each showing moderate to good diagnostic performance 
(AUC ~ 0.70-0.80).
CONCLUSION: Overall, this study highlights the utility of 3D cultures in 
investigating the biology of breast cancer, emphasizing the critical interplay 
between lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs. Our findings provide insights into the 
discovery of novel potential biomarkers, underscoring the importance of 
integrating both in vitro 3D culture and in vivo expression data for a more 
accurate identification of miRNAs with possible applications in cancer 
therapies.

BACKGROUND: Given limited and conflicting data, this systematic review and 
meta-analysis investigate the impacts of statin use on survival outcomes and 
adverse events in patients with cancer receiving radiotherapy.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and 
PubMed (January 2000 to June 2024) included studies on adults (≥ 18 years) with 
histologically confirmed cancer receiving oral statins during radiotherapy. 
Overall survival (OS) rates and radiotherapy-related adverse effects were 
compared between statin users and non-users using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (95%CIs). Meta-regression explored the effects of cancer 
type and statin intensity on OS rates, reported as coefficients (β) and 95%CI.
RESULTS: Of 21 studies (19 cohort studies and two randomized trials), OS rates 
did not significantly differ between statin users and non-users (OR: 1.29; 
95%CI: 0.99, 1.69) or by statin intensity (β: 0.20; 95%CI: -1.22, 1.62; 
p = 0.60), but significantly by cancer types (β: -0.29; 95%CI: -0.45, -0.13; 
p < 0.01). Statin use was associated with improved survival in oesophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), head and neck SCC, glioblastoma, and prostate 
cancer, but with reduced survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 
brain metastases. Statin users had a higher risk of major adverse cardiac events 
(OR: 2.22; 95%CI: 1.38, 3.59) in NSCLC and ≥ grade 2 mucositis (OR: 26.00; 
95%CI: 4.09, 165.10) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma but lower risks of 
ischemic stroke (OR: 0.80; 95%CI: 0.67, 0.95) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and 
rectal toxicity (OR: 0.45; 95%CI: 0.23, 0.88) in prostate cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Survival outcomes did not significantly differ by statin use or 
intensity but varied by cancer type. Statin users had lower risks of ischemic 
stroke and rectal toxicity. Further studies are needed to control for 
confounding biases.

BACKGROUND: The tumor microenvironment (TME) in gastric cancer (GC) exhibits 
immunosuppressive features that facilitate tumor advancement and obstruct the 
effectiveness of immunotherapy. The role of tripartite motif 32 (TRIM32) in the 
TME has not been extensively studied.
METHODS: GC mouse model was utilized along with flow cytometry analysis, 
transwell assays, and immunohistochemistry to investigate the impact of TRIM32 
on tumor progression and macrophage. To uncover the mechanisms by which TRIM32 
operates within the GC microenvironment, various molecular and biochemical 
methods were utilized, including RNA-sequencing, western blotting, quantitative 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, coimmunoprecipitation, and 
immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: TRIM32 originating from tumors was found to be linked to poor prognosis 
and notably associated with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in. In vitro 
experiments revealed that TRIM32 induced TAMs recruitment and M2-like 
polarization. Mechanismly, TRIM32 interacted with Phosphodiesterase 9 A (PDE9A) 
and activated the downstream phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B 
(PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway. Additionally, the reprogramming of TAMs by TRIM32 
diminished the resistance to anti-PD-1 treatment in GC models.
CONCLUSION: TRIM32/PDE9A axis promotes immune evasion in tumors and hinders the 
effectiveness of anti-PD-1 treatment by inducing TAMs recruitment and M2-like 
polarization in GC. This research provides insight into the role of TRIM32 in 
modulating tumor immunity and suggests that TRIM32 could be a promising target 
to overcoming resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in GC.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PC) is an epithelial malignant tumor that occurs in 
the prostate. N6 methylpurine (m6A) methylation regulates the tumor immune 
microenvironment. This study aimed to investigate the expression of m6A 
regulatory factor in PC and its relationship with prognosis.
METHODS: PC tissues and adjacent tissues were collected from PC patients who 
underwent surgical resection. The content of m6A regulator YTH m6A RNA binding 
protein 1 (YTHDF1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) was 
examined using Immunohistochemistry (IHC). The survival prognosis was predicted 
through Kaplan Meier survival curve. The patients were grouped into good and 
poor prognosis group according to whether recurrence and metastasis occurred 
within the 62 months of follow-up. Logistic regression analysis was adopted to 
analyze the risk factors.
RESULTS: YTHDF1 and IGFBP2 were localized in the cytoplasm of PC tissues. The 
positive expression rate of YTHDF1 in cancer tissues was 69.81% (37/53), which 
was much higher than the 33.96% (18/53) in adjacent tissues (P < 0.01). The 
positive expression rate of IGFBP2 in cancer tissues was 62.26% (33/53), which 
was markedly higher than the 28.30% (15/53) in adjacent tissues (P < 0.01). The 
proportion of TNM stage III + IV, high Gleason score and PSA > 15 ng/mL was 
visibly higher in patients with positive expression of YTHDF1 than in patients 
with negative expression of YTHDF1 (P < 0.05). The proportion of TNM stage 
III + IV, high Gleason score and PSA > 15 ng/mL in IGFBP2 positive patients was 
sensibly higher than that in IGFBP2 negative patients (P < 0.05). YTHDF1 
positive group had a median survival time of 35 months, which was evidently 
shorter than 44 months of YTHDF1 negative group (P < 0.05). The IGFBP2 positive 
group had a median survival time of 32 months, which was clearly shorter than 
45 months of IGFBP2 negative group (P < 0.05). In addition, TNM stage, Gleason 
score, PSA, YTHDF1 and IGFBP2 were independent risk factors for poor prognosis 
of PC (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: YTHDF1 and IGFBP2 were independent risk factors for poor prognosis 
of PC patients. They may be involved in the progression of prostate cancer, and 
serve as potential biomarkers for evaluating the prognosis of patients. However, 
its clinical translation value needs to be further verified by large sample and 
multi-center studies.

BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia, the progressive depletion of skeletal muscle mass and 
strength, worsens daily living outcomes and survival in individuals diagnosed 
with cancer. It arises from complex interactions between primary malignancy, 
antineoplastic interventions, and treatment-related sequelae, making early risk 
assessment a clinical priority. The body roundness index (BRI), an 
anthropometric metric superior to body mass index in body composition profiling, 
has shown diagnostic utility across metabolic and cardiovascular domains. 
However, its prognostic value in cancer-associated sarcopenia remains 
underexplored. This bicontinental study pioneers the clinical validation of BRI 
for sarcopenia prediction, proposing an objective quantification framework to 
optimize early screening and personalized therapeutic strategies in oncological 
practice.
METHODS: A cross-national dual-cohort design was implemented, using data from 
the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey multi-cancer cohort 
(n = 1,688) and a Chinese gastrointestinal oncology cohort (n = 713). 
Multivariable logistic regression adjusted demographics, lifestyle, 
comorbidities, cancer-related characteristics, and laboratory markers to examine 
the independent association between BRI and sarcopenia. Subgroup analyses with 
race- and cancer type-specific interaction terms were conducted to assess effect 
modification patterns, whereas nonlinear relationships were examined using 
smooth curve fitting and threshold effect models to identify critical 
thresholds. A predictive tool was developed and validated through receiver 
operating curve analysis and decision curve analysis to assess its diagnostic 
performance and clinical utility.
RESULTS: BRI was positively associated with sarcopenia risk in both cohorts (US: 
odds ration [OR] = 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.48-1.77, P < 0.001; 
Chinese: OR = 2.39, 95% CI = 1.82-3.15, P < 0.001), with distinct threshold 
effects observed (US cohort critical BRI value = 6.73; Chinese cohort critical 
BRI value = 3.01). The predictive model showed good performance (US cohort area 
under the curve (AUC): 0.80 training, 0.82 validation; Chinese cohort AUC: 0.66 
training, 0.78 validation). Decision curve analysis for both cohorts exhibited 
broad clinical applicability.
CONCLUSION: This study is the first to establish BRI independently predicts 
sarcopenia risk in patients with cancer. Additionally, a BRI-based model 
integrating sex and age combines the advantages of accuracy, specificity, and 
cost-effectiveness, demonstrating significant clinical utility.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the world's deadliest cancer, and surgery offers cure 
for over 75% of patients. However, postoperative delirium (POD) impairs 
recovery, accelerates cognitive decline, and increases mortality. Despite 
evidence that multicomponent prevention can avert 30-40% of POD, its incidence 
and predictors in lung cancer surgery remain under-studied.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults (≥ 18 years) 
undergoing elective lung cancer surgery resection from 2010 to 2019 using the 
U.S. National Inpatient Sample. Emergency admissions, rib fractures, and 
preexisting delirium or dementia were excluded. POD was identified by ICD-9/10 
codes. We extracted demographics, comorbidities, perioperative complications, 
length of stay, and costs. Wilcoxon rank-sum and χ² tests compared groups, and 
univariable and multivariable logistic regression-with stepwise selection and 
Bonferroni correction-identified independent POD predictors. Analyses were 
performed in R, with P < 0.05.
RESULTS: Among 30,813 resections, 1,499 patients (4.86%) developed POD. Age ≥ 71 
years (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.75-2.51) and 61-70 years (OR 1.59; 1.35-1.88), female 
sex (OR 1.12; 1.01-1.24), teaching-hospital status (OR 1.38; 1.21-1.57), and 
more extensive resections (lobectomy OR 1.43; 1.28-1.60; pneumonectomy OR 2.58; 
2.06-3.23) increased POD risk, whereas urban hospitals were protective (OR 0.71; 
0.55-0.91). Preoperative neurological disorders (OR 5.62; 5.02-6.29), psychoses 
(OR 1.62; 1.35-1.95), fluid-electrolyte disorders (OR 1.27; 1.14-1.42), and 
hypertension (OR 1.21; 1.08-1.36) were independent predictors. Postoperative 
arrhythmia, deep-vein thrombosis, stroke, shock, urinary infection, and 
hypoxemia further elevated risk; chronic pulmonary disease and respiratory 
failure were protective.
CONCLUSIONS: POD complicates nearly 5% of lung cancer resections. Key 
demographic, clinical, and institutional factors identify high-risk patients who 
may benefit from targeted, multicomponent prevention strategies in thoracic 
surgery.

BACKGROUND: Unilateral absence of the pulmonary artery (UAPA) is a rare 
congenital cardiac malformation. The occurrence of lung cancer associated with 
UAPA is extremely rare, resulting in limited clinical cases and experience.
CASE PRESENTATION: This report presents the case of a 72-year-old female patient 
with contralateral primary lung cancer complicated by unilateral absence of the 
left pulmonary artery who underwent surgical treatment. Such patients are 
particularly prone to intractable hypoxemia during surgery and face elevated 
risks of postoperative pulmonary hypertension, a situation that poses 
significant challenges for both surgical intervention and anesthetic management. 
Through comprehensive preoperative evaluations encompassing cardiopulmonary 
function and airway status, a thoracoscopic wedge resection of the right lower 
lobe was performed with bronchial blocker-assisted airway management. A tailored 
anesthetic protocol was implemented to maintain hemodynamic stability throughout 
the procedure. Postoperative care featured rigorous monitoring and meticulous 
nursing management. The surgery was successfully completed, with the patient 
discharged on postoperative day 5. Histopathological examination confirmed the 
diagnosis of typical carcinoid.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with UAPA complicated by contralateral lung cancer, 
precise isolation of the target lung lobe using a bronchial blocker, combined 
with comprehensive preoperative evaluation and strict postoperative monitoring, 
can effectively ensure surgical safety and provide key references for the 
diagnosis and treatment of similar rare cases.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies globally. 
Despite advances in early screening and treatment, the burden of GC has 
decreased. But, its incidence and mortality rates remain high in East Asia, 
particularly in China, Japan, and South Korea.
METHODS: This study based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 database, 
analyzes trends in GC burden from 1990 to 2021 and identifies key driving 
factors in China, Japan, South Korea, and globally. The Bayesian 
Age-Period-Cohort (BAPC) model was used for future predictions.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2021, the global GC burden showed a significant downward 
trend. The ge-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized mortality 
rate (ASMR) decreased from 24.76/100,000 to 14.33/100,000 (EAPC=-1.81 [95% CI: 
-1.88,-1.75]) and 22.01/100,000 to 11.20/100,000 (EAPC=-2.26 [95% CI: 
(-2.34,-2.18]), respectively. China's ASIR decreased from 48.03/100,000 to 
29.05/100,000 (EAPC=-1.64 [95% CI: -1.82,-1.47]). South Korea and Japan showed 
more significant reductions, with South Korea's ASIR dropping from 71.18/100,000 
in 1990 to 25.76/100,000 in 2021 (EAPC=-3.54 [95% CI: -3.68,-3.41]), the fastest 
decline among all regions. Japan's ASIR decreased from 64.05/100,000 to 
25.54/100,000 (EAPC=-2.98 [95% CI: -3.05,-2.92]). The decomposition analysis 
indicated that population aging was the major driver of the GC burden. Risk 
factors such as high-salt diet and smoking were strongly associated with GC.
CONCLUSION: The findings emphasize the importance of early screening, health 
interventions, lifestyle changes and dietary adjustments in reducing GC burden, 
especially in high-risk countries.

BACKGROUND: Occult pleural dissemination (PD) in non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) patients is likely to be missed on computed tomography (CT) scans, 
associated with poor survival, and generally contraindicated for radical 
surgery. This study aimed to develop and compare the performance of 
radiomics-based machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and fusion models to 
preoperatively identify occult PD in NSCLC patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 326 NSCLC patients from three Chinese 
high-volume medical centers (2016-2023) were retrospectively collected and 
divided into training (n = 216), internal test (n = 54), and external test 
(n = 56) cohorts. Ten radiomics-based ML models and eight DL models were trained 
using CT images at the maximum cross-sectional slice of the primary tumor. 
Moreover, another two fusion models (prefusion and postfusion) were developed 
using feature-based and decision-based methods. The receiver operating 
characteristic curve (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) were mainly used to 
compare the predictive performance of the models.
RESULTS: The GBM (AUC: 0.821) and DenseNet121 (AUC: 0.764) models achieved the 
highest AUC among ML and DL models in the external test cohorts, respectively. 
The postfusion model, integrating the output probabilities from GBM and 
DenseNet121 models, showed superior performance (AUC: 0.828-0.978) compared to 
the prefusion model (AUC: 0.817-0.877). Moreover, the postfusion model 
demonstrated the highest degree of sensitivity (82.1-97.2%) among all models 
across the three cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: The postfusion model, which integrates radiomics-based ML and DL 
models, can serve as a sensitive diagnostic tool to predict occult PD in NSCLC 
patients, thereby helping to avoid unnecessary surgeries.

BACKGROUND: A cancer diagnosis can significantly disrupt patients' social lives, 
leading to strained relationships and increased social isolation. Many encounter 
uneasy interactions or feel judged by others, amplifying loneliness and a sense 
of exclusion. While existing research has predominantly focused on clinical 
outcomes, the social relationship challenges faced by cancer patients have not 
been fully explored. Consequently, this study aims to synthesize qualitative 
studies that examine the social relationship experiences of cancer patients and 
survivors, offering a deeper insight into this important aspect of their lives.
METHODS: This study employed a qualitative meta-synthesis approach. A 
comprehensive search for relevant articles was conducted across international 
databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct) and national 
databases (SID, Noormags, Magiran). Qualitative studies published in English or 
Persian in peer-reviewed journals with full-text availability and that focused 
on the patient perspective were included. The Critical Appraisal Skills 
Programme checklist for qualitative research was used to evaluate study quality. 
The qualitative meta-synthesis was conducted utilizing a thematic synthesis 
approach as outlined by Thomas and Harden (2008).
RESULTS: Twenty qualitative studies involving 396 participants from diverse 
countries employed a variety of data collection and analytical methods. The 
analysis identified eight key themes. These themes include interpersonal strain 
due to excessive pity and misplaced sympathy, difficulties in disclosing 
information, challenges in seeking support, perceived gaps in social support, 
social isolation and reintegration challenges, understanding stigma and 
rejection, marital and intimate challenges during illness, and practical 
assistance requirements.
CONCLUSION: This review provides comprehensive insights into the social 
relationship challenges experienced by cancer patients and survivors, offering 
valuable information for the development of targeted interventions to address 
these challenges.

INTRODUCTION: Early detection of breast cancer enhances the likelihood of 
effective treatment and prevention, thereby reducing the disease burden. Despite 
its significance, breast cancer screening services in Ghana are underutilised, 
with variations across the 16 regions. This study estimated the uptake of breast 
cancer screening and examined its associated factors in Ghana.
METHODS: A weighted sample of 15,014 women of reproductive age from the 2022 
Ghana Demographic and Health Survey was analysed. A spatial map illustrated 
regional variations in breast cancer screening uptake. Multilevel binary 
logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with screening 
uptake. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 
reported, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: The national prevalence of breast cancer screening was 18.4% [17.2, 
19.6], with regional variations. The likelihood of screening increased with age, 
peaking among women aged 45-49 (aOR = 4.88; 95% CI = 3.58-6.66). Women with 
secondary (aOR = 1.76; 95% CI = 1.39-2.24) and higher (aOR = 4.25; 95% CI = 
3.15-5.75) education, those who were employed (aOR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.03-1.51), 
insured (aOR = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.38-2.41), or had recent health facility visits 
(aOR = 1.53; 95% CI = 1.33-1.77) were more likely to be screened. Media exposure 
via radio (aOR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.03-1.42), newspaper (aOR = 1.41; 95% CI = 
1.16-1.71), and internet use (aOR = 1.34; 95% CI = 1.14-1.59) increased 
screening odds, while rural residence (aOR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.52-0.82) and 
Islamic affiliation (aOR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.61-0.98) reduced the odds. Women in 
Bono East, Oti, Savannah, and Upper West regions were less likely to be 
screened.
CONCLUSION: The study reveals low participation in breast cancer screening in 
Ghana, with notable regional disparities. Major factors associated with breast 
cancer screening included women's age, level of education, wealth index, 
religious affiliation, employment status, health insurance coverage, recent 
health facility visits, media exposure, place of residence and region. 
Culturally and religiously sensitive screening interventions are essential for 
addressing regional and religious variations. Expanding Ghana's national health 
insurance to cover breast cancer screening will enhance access. Awareness 
campaigns, conducted through both traditional and digital platforms, are crucial 
for boosting participation.

BACKGROUND: Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is a variant of 
autonomic dysfunction (AD) defined by an increase in heart rate (HR) ≥ 30 bpm 
within 10 minutes (min) of a change from the supine to an upright position, in 
the absence of orthostatic hypotension. Many studies suggest that AD is common 
in active cancer patients and is associated with variable symptoms and decreased 
survival. Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that POTS can be associated 
with active cancer and might contribute to some of these patients' symptoms and 
survival.
METHODS: Consecutive 220 active cancer patients aged 19-59 were enrolled. They 
were asked to lay flat for 5-10 min then to stand for 10 min without support. 
Total of 5 blood pressure (BP) and HR readings were taken (immediately before 
standing up then immediately after, and at 3, 6, and 10 min while standing). All 
patient's symptoms were recorded.
RESULTS: 213 patients were included. Age was 48 ± 8, 76% were females,18% had 
metastasis and 43% were on chemotherapy. 55% reported symptoms of AD, with 
symptoms associated with standing were reported in 28%. Baseline HR was 
76 ± 13 bpm, and systolic BP was 129 ± 20. Upon standing, HR increased by 
10 ± 3 bpm and systolic BP dropped by 1.3 ± 0.4. Immediately after standing, 47 
(22%) Patients developed symptoms.18 patients (8.5%) met the criteria for POTS, 
where HR increased by 37 ± 5 with an increase in systolic BP by -1.6 ± 6. 
Patients with POTS had higher HR upon standing (p = 0.000), HR at 3 min 
(p = 0.005), HR at 6 min (p = 0.002), and HR at 10 min (p = 0.000). In contrast, 
baseline HR and BP showed no significant difference between patients with and 
without POTS (p = 0.74 and 0.11). After 16.9 ± 5.5 months, there was no 
statistical deterrence in all-cause mortality between POTS and non-POTS 
patients.
CONCLUSION: POTS and orthostatic intolerance are prevalent in active cancer, 
where onset of symptoms started after cancer diagnosis in many patients. These 
patients have a significant association with higher HR upon standing and overall 
prognosis comparable to that of patients without POTS.

Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) have introduced as a cornerstone of 
regenerative medicine, owing to their immunomodulatory properties and 
therapeutic potential in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Although, their 
clinical application is often restricted due to immune rejection and 
heterogeneity in immunoregulatory responses. The advent of Clustered Regularly 
Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) 
technology has revolutionized MSC engineering, enabling precise genetic 
modifications to enhance their immunological efficacy. This review explores how 
CRISPR-mediated editing of MSCs can mitigate immunogenicity, amplify 
anti-inflammatory functions, and repurpose MSCs for targeted immunotherapy. Key 
strategies include knockout of β2-microglobulin to evade T-cell recognition, 
augmentation of anti-inflammatory mediators like interleukin (IL)-10 and 
TNF-alpha stimulated gene/protein 6 (TSG-6), and disruption of pro-inflammatory 
pathways such as toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/NF-κB. In addition, 
CRISPR-engineered MSCs demonstrate promise in reshaping tumor microenvironments 
and combating bacterial infections through enhanced innate immunity. Despite 
challenges including off-target effects and delivery optimization, 
CRISPR-tailored MSCs represent a transformative approach to overcoming 
immunological barriers, paving the way for universal, off-the-shelf therapies in 
rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and beyond.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine postoperative prognostic factors in 
patients with T2 gallbladder cancer (GBC) to determine factors linked to 
survival outcomes. The results can inform clinical decision-making and guide 
personalized treatment plans.
METHODS: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases were 
retrieved up to March 12, 2025. The included articles were scored via the 
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The data were analyzed via Stata 15.0.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies (n = 8,095) were included. Factors associated with 
worse overall survival (OS) included age > 60 years (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.02, 
95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00–1.05) and hepatic-side tumors (HR = 2.89, 95% 
CI: 2.14–3.90). There was a non-significant trend toward poorer OS with male sex 
(HR = 1.41, 95% CI: 0.89–2.23). Several associations became significant after 
sensitivity analyses eliminated sources of heterogeneity: lymph node (LN) 
metastasis (HR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.56–3.07), perineural invasion (PNI) (HR = 2.29, 
95% CI: 1.74–3.03), simple cholecystectomy (SC) (HR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.00–2.13), 
and extended cholecystectomy (EC), the latter of which was protective 
(HR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.52–0.87). Additional protective factors included LN 
dissection (HR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.38–0.86) and R0 resection (HR = 0.21, 95% CI: 
0.05–0.91). For disease-free survival (DFS), LN metastasis (HR = 2.46, 95% CI: 
1.50–4.04) and PNI (HR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.36–3.04) were independent predictors of 
a poor outcome, which was confirmed again after sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: For postoperative patients with T2 GBC, factors, including age > 60 
years, male gender, hepatic lateral tumor, LN metastasis, PNI, and SC were 
linked to worse OS. LN metastasis and PNI significantly affected DFS. EC and LN 
dissection may improve prognosis.

Although chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells have demonstrated remarkable 
efficacy against hematologic malignancies, their effectiveness in solid tumors 
is limited by poor tumor infiltration and severe cytokine release syndrome 
(CRS). CAR-macrophage (CAR-M) therapy has emerged as a promising alternative, 
leveraging the innate tumor-homing capacity of macrophages while enabling 
antigen-specific phagocytosis and immune activation without triggering CRS. 
Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) represents an ideal therapeutic target 
due to its high expression in prostate cancer cells. In this study, we 
engineered PSMA-specific CAR-M with potent anti-tumor activity against prostate 
cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. PSMA-specific CAR-M exhibited strong 
antigen-dependent phagocytic capability and underwent polarization toward a 
pro-inflammatory, tumoricidal phenotype upon PSMA recognition. Mechanistically, 
interaction with PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells induced metabolic 
reprogramming, characterized by enhanced glycolytic activity and suppressed 
oxidative phosphorylation, which reinforced the anti-tumor function of CAR-M. 
Our findings highlight PSMA-targeted CAR-M therapy as a promising 
immunotherapeutic approach for prostate cancer.

BACKGROUND: The risk of breast cancer has been associated with various lifestyle 
factors, yet the evidence regarding how lifestyle modifications affect this risk 
remains limited. This study examines the relationship between changes in the 
Healthy Lifestyle Index (HLI) and postmenopausal breast cancer risk in women 
participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC).
METHODS: HLI scores (ranging from 0 to 16) were computed based on smoking 
habits, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), and physical activity 
levels, using data from baseline and follow-up questionnaires, which were 
separated by a median interval of 10  (IQR: 5.2-12.0) years. Among the 125,746 
women included in the analyses, 2,175 developed breast cancer over a median 
follow-up period of nearly 4  (IQR: 2.9-8.4) years starting from the date of the 
second lifestyle questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to 
estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) for the relationship 
between changes in HLI and postmenopausal breast cancer risk, analysed both 
overall and by estrogen receptor (ER) status. Individual components of the HLI 
were also analysed, with sensitivity analyses addressing potential reverse 
causation by delaying the start of follow-up by 1 to 3 years.
RESULTS: Each unit increase in the HLI-reflecting a healthier lifestyle-was not 
associated with the overall risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Among 
individual components, only a one-unit increase in the BMI score, corresponding 
to a shift towards a healthier BMI, was inversely associated with overall 
(HR = 0.936; 95% CI 0.880-0.996) and ER-positive (HR = 0.930; 95% CI 
0.865-1.000) postmenopausal breast cancer risks.
CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle changes, as measured by the HLI, during mid-adulthood 
were not significantly associated with the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. 
More specifically, the results of this study suggested that a shift towards a 
healthier BMI may contribute to breast cancer prevention. Further research 
involving diverse and larger study populations and lifestyle assessments at 
earlier life stages could provide deeper insights.

BACKGROUND: China is among the largest contributors to the global cervical 
cancer burden. Problems such as insufficient vaccine supply, high vaccine 
prices, and insufficient policy support hindering vaccine popularization need to 
be solved.
METHODS: In the present study, we employed a qualitative research methodology to 
retrieve and organize policy documents on cervical cancer from 31 provincial and 
central governments by the documentation method.
RESULTS: The current relevant action program of the Chinese government places 
strong emphasis on screening and treatment; however, the absence of a consistent 
national HPV vaccination policy remains the most critical gap in China's 
strategy to achieve elimination.
DISCUSSION: Based on the findings of this study, several key recommendations 
emerge to advance China's political commitment to the Global Strategy to 
Accelerate the Elimination of Cervical Cancer.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, cancer has become a hot topic in the field of 
health management, and its etiology may be related to a variety of factors. 
Current research suggests that daytime napping duration is associated with 
variety of diseases, but few studies have explored the relationship between 
daytime napping duration and the risk of pan-cancer. Therefore, we based our 
study on the CHARLS database and Mendelian Randomization (MR) to investigate the 
relationship between daytime napping duration and pan-cancer risk.
METHODS: This study is based on the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal 
Study (CHARLS) and Mendelian Randomization (MR). We first used Mendelian 
Randomization to explore the causal relationship between daytime napping and 
pan-cancer. Cox proportional regression was used to investigate the relationship 
between daytime napping duration and the risk of pan-cancer. The RCS curve is 
used to display the non-linear relationship between daytime napping duration and 
pan-cancer risk.
RESULTS: Among 6 166 Chinese participants, compared with those who never napped, 
the overall cancer risk decreased by 31.0% (HR = 0.690), 33.9% (HR = 0.661), and 
41.4% (HR = 0.586) for individuals who napped 1-30 min, 31-60 min, and over 
60 min, respectively. Restricted cubic splines indicated a linear inverse 
association between nap duration and cancer risk (P for non-linear = 0.552), and 
sensitivity analyses yielded consistent results.
CONCLUSION: Longer daytime napping duration was associated with a lower overall 
cancer risk. After adjusting for multiple confounders, people who napping over 
60 min remained linked to an approximately 40% reduction in cancer risk. Our 
study found an inverse association between daytime napping duration and cancer 
risk, but larger sample sizes and objective sleep measurements are still needed 
for validation.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the strength and validity of the 
evidence for reported associations between multiple factors and colorectal 
cancer (CRC) survival.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 
from inception to 20 June 2024 for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of 
observational studies on factors and CRC prognosis. The quality of the 
methodology was evaluated using A Measurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews 
2 (AMSTAR-2).
RESULTS: 90 meta-analyses investigated 191 associations (123 main evidence and 
68 supplementary evidence) with CRC overall survival (OS). Factors were 
categorized into: demographic characteristic, perioperative condition, pathology 
of neoplasia, clinical laboratory indicators, comorbidities, behavior patterns 
and others. Totally, 6 associations were recommended as strong evidence (class 
I). While the presence of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) (hazard ratio 
[HR] = 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32-0.51) denoted a better OS 
outcome, the existence of log odds of positive lymph nodes (LODDS) (HR = 3.49, 
95% CI 2.88-4.23), liver cirrhosis (HR = 3.10, 95% CI 2.68-3.59) and the 
increment of metastatic lymph node ratio (mLNR) (HR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.39-1.88), 
pretreatment neutrophils-lymphocytes ratio (NLR) (HR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.83-2.58) 
and pretreatment lymph node ratio (LNR) (HR = 3.13, 95% CI 2.36-4.15) were 
considered as poor predictors of OS. Notably, 2 strong evidence was also found 
in supplementary evidence including extranodal tumor deposits (ENTDs) 
(HR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.46-2.04) and absolute monocyte count (AMC) (HR = 1.83, 95% 
CI 1.47-2.29).
CONCLUSION: Beyond high-risk pathological signs of lymph node status and ENTDs, 
optimizable and cost-effective laboratory indicators, such as CIN, NLR, LNR and 
AMC, may effectively predict the prognosis of CRC. Furthermore, our study 
provides valuable insights for stratified CRC patient management, reinforcing 
the development of evidence-based prognostic survival strategies and 
recommendations.

BACKGROUND: Treating advanced ovarian cancer (OC) is challenging due to the 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This study investigates tumor-immune 
cell interactions using organotypic spheroid models that simulate the in vivo 
microenvironment.
METHODS: A dual-model spheroid system was established combining serous 
adenocarcinoma SKOV-3 cells with monocytes, pro-inflammatory (MΦ1) or 
anti-inflammatory (MΦ2) macrophages, or their derived exosomes (EXOs). In Model 
A, immune cells or EXOs were co-seeded with tumor cells to replicate early 
heterotypic aggregation. In Model B, immune cells or EXOs were introduced 24 h 
post-spheroid formation to simulate immune infiltration into established 
spheroids. Spheroid morphology was quantified by diameter and circularity, while 
the distribution of immune cells and EXOs was assessed via fluorescence 
intensity profiling in 2D and 3D. epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
marker expression was analyzed to assess tumor cell phenotypic changes.
RESULTS: Spheroids formed with SKOV-3 cells and ThP-1 monocytes developed a 
dense monocyte-enriched outer layer. Macrophage subtypes differentially 
influenced spheroid morphology: MΦ2 macrophages promoted the formation of 
multiple, loosely organized spheroids and increased N-cadherin expression, 
indicative of enhanced EMT. Similarly, MΦ-EXOs modulated EMT marker expression, 
underscoring the contribution of both direct cell interactions and paracrine 
signaling in regulating spheroid dynamics.
CONCLUSIONS: Macrophages and their exosomes play a critical role in modulating 
the architecture and functional behavior of spheroids, reflecting two key 
aspects of OC progression: the formation of immune cell-enriched spheroids in 
ascitic fluid and tumor-immune interactions at peritoneal metastatic sites. This 
model provides a clinically relevant platform for preclinical testing of 
therapeutic strategies targeting peritoneal dissemination in OC.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Despite 
the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly those targeting 
PD-1/PD-L1 pathways, a significant number of patients exhibit either primary 
resistance or acquire resistance over time. While genomic and epigenetic 
mechanisms contribute to this resistance, increasing evidence points to the 
pivotal role of immunometabolism—the interface of cellular metabolism and immune 
regulation. This review focuses on how altered metabolic states in both immune 
cells and cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) within the lung tumor microenvironment 
contribute to ICI resistance. We discuss key metabolic pathways involved in 
immune suppression, the metabolic plasticity of CSCs, and how these factors 
interact to shape a metabolically hostile tumor niche for immune effector cells. 
Finally, we explore emerging therapeutic strategies targeting immunometabolism 
to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: Early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) is crucial for improving 
patient survival. This innovative multi-center study aims to develop a 
non-invasive blood-based assay using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentomics to 
differentiate CRC from advanced colorectal adenomas and non-cancerous colorectal 
and other digestive diseases.
METHODS: A total of 167 CRC patients and 227 with benign colorectal conditions 
were divided into training and validation cohorts (1:1 ratio). Plasma cfDNA 
underwent Low-depth whole-genome sequencing to profile three fragmentomics 
features, which were integrated into a stacked ensemble model. The model was 
validated on 69 CRC patients and 96 benign controls, with an additional cohort 
of 31 advanced adenoma patients included to assess its performance in 
differentiating advanced adenomas from benign cases.
RESULTS: The model achieved an AUC of 0.926, with sensitivity of 91.3% and 
specificity of 82.3% in validation. Sensitivities were consistently high across 
CRC stages (I: 94.4%, II: 86.4%, III: 91.3%, IV: 100%). Notably, the model 
demonstrated exceptional accuracy in distinguishing advanced adenomas from 
benign cases, achieving an AUC of 0.846 and sensitivity of 67.7%, outperforming 
traditional blood tests.
CONCLUSIONS: This multi-center study underscores a significant advancement in 
liquid biopsy technology, offering a highly accurate and non-invasive approach 
for early CRC detection and differentiation of advanced colorectal adenomas.

BACKGROUND: SLAMF8 functions as a cancer-promoting immune checkpoint and could 
be targeted for therapy in multiple cancer types. Its effect on the immune 
microenvironment and metastasis of prostate cancer (PCa) is not well understood.
METHOD: We analyzed SLAMF8 distribution in PCa and normal tissues using TIMER 
and examined its role in drug sensitivity and immunotherapy for PCa. The 
prognostic value and clinical relevance of SLAMF8 in PCa were assessed using 
multiple datasets. GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses identified dysregulated pathways 
in tumors with varying SLAMF8 levels. Tumor purity and immune cell infiltration, 
and their correlation with SLAMF8 overexpression, were analyzed and confirmed in 
PCa samples. Additionally, CCK-8, flow cytometry, and transwell assays evaluated 
the viability, apoptosis, and invasion capacity of SLAMF8-overexpressing PCa 
cells. Allograft models in C57BL/6 mice were used to study the effects of SLAMF8 
overexpression on tumor growth and immune cell infiltration.
RESULTS: Compared to non-tumor tissues, SLAMF8 was overexpressed in PCa tumors. 
High SLAMF8 levels are linked to poor distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), 
higher Gleason scores (GS), and advanced T stage. SLAMF8 expression in PCa 
tumors negatively correlates with tumor purity but positively correlates with 
the infiltration of B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. SLAMF8 
overexpression in prostate cancer cells promoted cell growth, lowered apoptosis 
rates, and boosted invasion in vitro, alongside hastening tumor development in 
mice. This study demonstrates that SLAMF8 enhances PCa metastasis via the 
TLR4-NF-κB pathway. SLAMF8 is a potential predictor of distant metastasis and a 
promising target for PCa immunotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies globally, 
imposing a substantial disease burden. Its inherent heterogeneity complicates 
prognosis and treatment, underscoring the need for accurate survival prediction 
models to guide personalised clinical decision-making. Existing studies on 
breast cancer survival prediction models based on gene expression have largely 
focused on predefined subsets of genes, such as biologically-relevant, 
differentially-expressed or protein-coding genes, potentially overlooking 
critical but uncharacterised genomic contributors. To probe deeper beyond 
well-characterised biological pathways and differential gene expression, this 
study adopts an unbiased, hypothesis-free approach by conducting machine 
learning-based survival analysis on the entire transcriptome, rather than 
restricted gene subsets, to identify a novel gene signature for the development 
of a robust and accurate risk score model for breast cancer survival prediction.
METHODS: The clinical and transcriptome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Breast 
Cancer (TCGA-BRCA) were analysed. Feature selection was conducted using 
univariate Cox, LASSO Cox regression and stepwise selection. The selected gene 
signature was then used to construct a risk score model, following which model 
performance was evaluated using AUC(t), Kaplan-Meier curves (with the Log-Rank 
test), Harrell's C-index and calibration plots. The Molecular Taxonomy of Breast 
Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) and Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GSE96058) cohorts served as external validation sets.
RESULTS: Here, we present Breast Cancer Genie (BRCAGenie), a 43-gene polygenic 
risk score model that can reasonably predict breast cancer survival using gene 
expression, achieving three-year and five-year AUC(t) scores of 0.736 and 0.751 
respectively in the TCGA unseen test set and significant separation of the 
Kaplan-Meier curves. When age at diagnosis was included, the three-year and 
five-year AUC(t) scores of the combined BRCAGenie model improved to 0.812 and 
0.814 respectively in the unseen test set. The identified signature demonstrates 
promising biological relevance, with many genes supported by existing cancer 
literature, and others representing potentially novel biomarkers. To facilitate 
clinical application, the BRCAGenie calculator was developed: 
https://jiaweilee.shinyapps.io/breast_cancer_survival_43/ .
CONCLUSIONS: The development of an accurate breast cancer polygenic risk score 
model for survival prediction enables robust prognostic stratification for 
personalised clinical decision-making. Through our unbiased, hypothesis-free 
approach, we have identified novel breast cancer prognostic biomarkers with the 
potential to be clinically validated and translated into relevant diagnostics 
and therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy (RC) with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and 
pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is standard for muscle-invasive bladder 
cancer (MIBC). While PLND improves staging and local control, the optimal extent 
is debated. This study used the SEER database (2000–2021) to evaluate lymph node 
yield's (LNY) prognostic significance.
METHODS: We included 12,698 patients who underwent PLND, stratified by LNY 
quartiles (cutoffs at 12, 19, and 29). Inverse probability of treatment 
weighting (IPTW) was applied to balance baseline characteristics. Cox 
regression, Kaplan–Meier curves, and competing risk models assessed the impact 
of LNY on overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). A prognostic 
nomogram incorporating LNY was developed and validated using LASSO regression, 
the area under the curve (AUC) and calibration plots.
RESULTS: The optimal threshold for LNY was determined to be 12, with LNY ≥ 12 
associated with a 17% reduction in all-cause mortality risk (HR 0.83, 95% CI 
0.79–0.88). An increase in LNY was correlated with improvements in OS and CSS, 
with the 5-year OS rate increasing from 46.0% to 55.6%. A nonlinear relationship 
between LNY and all-cause mortality risk was observed, as the protective effect 
diminished after exceeding 39.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the establishment of LNY threshold of 12 as an 
indicator of surgical completeness; an LNY of 20–39 may be associated with a 
sustained protective effect. However, excessive LNY may not yield additional 
benefits. Clinical decision-making should consider patient characteristics and 
healthcare accessibility to optimize outcomes for bladder cancer.

PKCδ is a key isoform in the PKC subgroup of AGC-kinase proteins, known to be 
involved in various cellular processes. Dysregulation of its expression has been 
linked to multiple malignancies. Notably, PKCδ overexpression has been 
associated with breast cancer progression and poor prognosis. Previous research 
has shown that PKCδ phosphorylates specific serine residues on target proteins, 
leading to tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, the molecular mechanisms of 
PKCδ-driven breast cancer pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. 
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the most common genetic variants, can 
contribute to cancer susceptibility by causing structural and functional changes 
in proteins. This study aimed to identify oncogenic non-synonymous variants in 
PKCδ and assess their impact on protein structure, stability, conservation, 
dynamics, and interactions. Analyzing a dataset of 613 non-synonymous variants 
with various computational and in silico tools based on sequence and structure 
approaches, four variants, including V114G, C189R, C189Y, W608R, were identified 
as highly oncogenic. Molecular dynamics simulations showed increased structural 
deviations and flexibility in these variants compared to the native protein, 
potentially leading to changes in structure, stability, and biophysical 
properties. These variants disrupted normal PKCδ function by causing surface 
distortion, changing net charge, and perturbing intramolecular interactions with 
STAT3, which may activate PKCδ in a non-canonical manner. The study also found 
an association between the oncogenic non-synonymous SNP W608R, located within 
the highly conserved AGC kinase domain, and breast cancer, with the TT genotype 
significantly linked to increased risk (OR = 2.7; RR = 1.6, p < 0.0001). 
Although further functional validation in cellular models is necessary, this 
research provides a foundation for future studies on the impact of oncogenic 
PKCδ variants in breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer affects millions of women and while treatment can be 
lifesaving, it also has numerous side effects, including those related to sexual 
function, which often impact the ability to experience pleasure from sex. This 
study aimed to understand how breast cancer survivors define sexual activity, 
identify important aspects, and ascertain perceived impacts of treatment on 
sexual activity and function, particularly related to pleasure.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with women who were breast 
cancer survivors at least one-year post-radiation. Priority populations were 
oversampled (racial/ethnic/sexual/gender minorities, those aged over 65 or under 
45). The sample included 23 participants: 11 Non-Hispanic White, 8 Non-Hispanic 
Black, 2 Non-Hispanic Asian, 2 Hispanic/Latinx, and 1 transgender participant. 
Mean age was 58.6 years (range 34-77, SD = 12.2).
RESULTS: Four themes were identified: 1) Sexual activity is defined broadly, and 
intimacy and pleasure are key. Participants defined sex in broad terms and 
highlighted the importance of being close with partners and pleasure. Sex was 
important across the lifespan and among participants from different backgrounds, 
2) Few anticipated sexual side effects: Although treatment side effects were 
common, few expected them, 3) Clinician communication is lacking or mistimed: 
Participants did not remember conversations about potential side effects because 
they did not happen, or they were not in a mental space to process them, 4) 
Sexual health side effects are plentiful and for many, long-lasting. Changes to 
breast sensitivity and ability to achieve orgasm were reported. Breast cancer 
survivors conceptualized sexual activity through a broad lens and highlighted 
the importance of sex, particularly pleasure and intimacy. Participants reported 
a variety of negative effects from treatment that impacted pleasure, and 
patient/clinician communication on sexual health was perceived to be lacking.
CONCLUSION: Clinicians may improve survivors' quality of life by acknowledging 
clinical origins of sexual dysfunction, prioritizing pleasure and intimacy in 
the development of interventions to prevent or mitigate sexual side effects and 
fostering open communication.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the impact of different ROI delineation 
strategies on the axillary lymph nodes metastasis (ALNM) prediction model by 
analyzing two-dimensional ultrasound images of lymph nodes. In addition, we 
integrated clinical and pathological information to construct a comprehensive 
model, and based on this model, developed a nomogram for individualized 
assessment of the probability of ALNM.
METHODS: A total of 146 axillary lymph nodes were randomly divided into a 
training set and a testing set at a ratio of 8:2. Clinical and pathological 
features were selected using univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
analyses, followed by the construction of a clinical prediction model. Radiomic 
features were extracted from both the internal and surrounding regions of the 
two-dimensional ultrasound images of the axillary lymph nodes. The least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was then used to 
select and retain the optimal features, followed by the construction of a 
radiomic prediction model. A combined prediction model was developed by 
integrating the clinical and radiomic models, and a nomogram was created for the 
combined prediction model.
RESULTS: The clinical status of axillary lymph nodes was an independent 
predictor for metastasis. The clinical prediction model based on the status of 
axillary lymph nodes achieved an AUC of 0.728 in the testing set. The radiomic 
prediction model based on the LASSO logistic regression algorithm with a 1 mm 
extended region had the highest AUC of 0.856 in the testing set. The combined 
prediction model integrating the clinical and optimal radiomic models achieved 
an AUC of 0.841 in the testing set, with a sensitivity of 77.4% and an accuracy 
of 79.5%. This combined model outperformed the individual clinical and radiomic 
models and was more effective in predicting axillary lymph node metastasis.
CONCLUSION: This study developed a predictive model for ALNM based on ultrasound 
images of ALNs and their peripheral extended regions. The results demonstrated 
that the combined model incorporating both the lymph node and a 1-mm peripheral 
extension yielded the best predictive performance. Furthermore, a comprehensive 
integrated model was established by incorporating clinical and pathological 
characteristics, which effectively enhanced the prediction of ALNM.

INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer in males is rare, accounting for just 0.5% to 1% 
according to World Health Organization data. This is the first reported case of 
IESCM from breast cancer in an African male, which makes it noteworthy. 
Furthermore, unlike previously reported cases in females, this case involved 
L1-L2 metastasis with sphincter dysfunction and a subsequent relapse leading to 
mortality, thereby expanding the documented spectrum of IESCM presentations and 
outcomes.
CASE PRESENTATION: This is a case of a 77-year-old male with invasive ductal 
carcinoma of the left breast and intradural extramedullary spinal cord 
metastasis diagnosed via Magnetic Resonance Imaging after presenting with 
neurological symptoms 4 years post-mastectomy. He eventually passed away 
following a right Deep Venous Thrombosis, which led to bilateral pulmonary 
embolism after his second relapse.
CONCLUSION: Late presentation most likely contributed to the worsening of 
symptoms and poor prognosis. This report overstates the importance of prompt 
access to healthcare and the essence of thorough investigations, especially in 
breast cancer, where neurological symptoms may point to a metastatic diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: An increased risk of infection has been suggested for patients with 
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) treated with atezolizumab plus 
nab-paclitaxel based on the IMpassion130 trial.
METHODS: This Japanese postmarketing study aimed to compare the incidence of 
severe infections in patients with TNBC treated with atezolizumab plus 
nab-paclitaxel versus nab-paclitaxel alone. Anonymized patient records regarding 
medical claims and laboratory tests were extracted from the Japanese Medical 
Data Vision database. Patients with a drug index date of November 27, 2019,-May 
31, 2022, were included in the analysis. Based on the published literature, 
severe infections were declared when a patient had a confirmed diagnosis of 
infection, a hospitalization record, infection as the primary reason for 
hospitalization, and a record of immunological infection tests. In the 
sensitivity analysis, the definition of severe infections was modified as a 
combination of confirmed infection diagnosis and intravenous antibacterial drug 
prescription records.
RESULTS: Overall, 321 and 319 patients were included in the exposure 
(atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel) and control (nab-paclitaxel alone) groups, 
respectively. After adjusting for standardized mortality/morbidity ratio 
weighting, the baseline characteristics were balanced between the groups. The 
incidence rate ratio (exposure/control) of severe infections was estimated at 
3.29 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93-13.53) originally and 1.05 (95% CI: 
0.56-1.84) in the sensitivity analysis. Additional analyses supported the 
appropriateness of the revised definition of severe infections.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results did not indicate a significant increase in the 
risk of severe infections with atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel in daily 
clinical practice. Further research is required.

PURPOSE: Many childhood cancer survivors (CCS) do not attend long-term follow-up 
(LTFU) care. We examined (1) the involvement of mothers and fathers, (2) their 
attitudes towards LTFU, (3) how they motivated their adult children to attend, 
(4) and parents' perceptions of the healthcare professionals involved and the 
decision to end LTFU care.
METHODS: A population-based sample (Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry) of parents 
of long-term CCS (> 5 years post-diagnosis, ≥ 20 years at study) responded to a 
questionnaire. Multiple-choice and open-ended questions were analysed using 
descriptive statistics, chi2 comparisons, and qualitative content analyses.
RESULTS: Of 302 families, 190 fathers (40.7%) and 276 mothers participated. One 
in four (26.1%) parents were involved in LTFU, providing medical, 
preventative/practical, and emotional support (mothers > fathers, p = 0.013). 
Parents of LTFU attenders were pleased with attendance (94.3%), providing them 
with reassurance about their child's health. Parents of non-attenders did not 
wish their child attended LTFU (74.7%), because of their perceptions (e.g., 
'being cured'), respect for the child's decision, or the need to move on. 
Parents (53.5%) motivated attenders (mothers > fathers, p = 0.002) by talking 
about importance, helping to schedule, and reminding. General practitioners 
(64.3%) and adult oncologists (31.9%) most often provided LTFU. The decision to 
end LTFU was made by the treating physician (53.4%), survivors (18.4%), or 
shared decision-making (17.5%).
CONCLUSION: There is unused potential for parents to motivate their children to 
participate in LTFU. The variety of LTFU models can be difficult to navigate; 
thus, working to improve visibility and encouragement might help increase 
attendance.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide and often 
necessitates a mastectomy. Many patients choose breast reconstruction (BR) to 
restore appearance and self-image. Common techniques include implant-based and 
autologous reconstruction, such as with the latissimus dorsi flap (LDF). This 
systematic review compares LDF and implant-based reconstructions to guide 
clinical decision-making and improve patient care.
METHODS: This systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA 
guidelines using PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and VHL databases. Studies 
were included if they involved breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy 
followed by either LDF or implant-based reconstruction. Study quality was 
assessed using STROBE guidelines.
RESULTS: Out of 785 articles initially identified, 19 articles met the inclusion 
criteria. LDF and implant-based reconstructions had distinct indications, 
complication profiles, and long-term outcomes, with LDF reconstruction linked to 
lower revision rates, more natural aesthetic outcomes, and higher patient 
satisfaction despite donor site morbidity and more postoperative complications. 
Implant-based reconstruction had higher rates of revision and lower patient 
satisfaction, but is less invasive and associated with fewer postoperative 
complications.
CONCLUSION: LDF reconstruction is associated with lower revision rates, more 
natural aesthetic outcomes, and greater patient satisfaction despite higher 
donor site morbidity and increased postoperative complications. In contrast, 
implant-based reconstruction offers a less invasive option with fewer 
complications but is linked to higher revision rates and lower satisfaction. 
Optimal reconstruction outcomes require an individualized approach that 
carefully considers patient preferences, oncological factors, and procedural 
risks to support informed decision-making and enhance quality of life. This 
paper addresses a common clinical decision point in breast cancer care by 
directly comparing two widely used breast reconstruction techniques: LDF and 
implant-based reconstruction. Evidence-based insight into long-term outcomes, 
revision rates, and patient satisfaction is provided, which can help clinicians 
better counsel patients on their reconstruction options. This systematic review 
fills a gap in the literature by synthesizing data across multiple studies to 
guide future research and improve individualized breast reconstruction 
planning.  LEVEL OF EVIDENCE III: This journal requires that authors assign a

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate preoperative MRI risk factors for 
metastatic disease in patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy 
(nCRT) and curative surgery, followed or not by adjuvant chemotherapy (ChT).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single-center post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical 
trial data to evaluate the effect of adjuvant ChT in comparison to observation 
in patients with rectal cancer receiving nCRT and surgical resection. 
Preoperative MRI variables were retrospectively reviewed by three observers. 
Clinical, surgical, and pathological variables were included in univariate and 
multivariate analysis, and metastasis risk was assessed. A subgroup analysis was 
further performed to evaluate the effect of ChT on metastasis incidence in both 
good and poor responders to neoadjuvant treatment.
RESULTS: A total of 132 patients (54% female, median age 55 years) were 
included. Poor mrTRG (HR = 2.53, 95% CI 1.32-5.65) and stage pIII disease (HR 
1.94, 95% CI 1.09-3.45) were associated with increased metastatic risk. Although 
the rate of metastasis was lower in the treated group (9.1%) than in the control 
group (26.1%) among the patients who achieved a good response (mrTRG 1-2), the 
difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.19). The subgroup analysis 
revealed no difference in metastasis rates between patients with poor response 
receiving or not receiving adjuvant ChT.
CONCLUSION: Response assessed by mrTRG is a preoperative prognostic factor 
associated with increased metastasis-free survival. MRI restaging could not 
predict the clinical benefits of adjuvant oxaliplatin-based ChT.
KEY POINTS: Question To patients who have rectal cancer, the prediction of risk 
for metastatic disease during baseline staging to indicate systemic chemotherapy 
remains challenging. Findings MR-assessed poor tumor regression grade after 
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (mrTRG3-5) and pathological postoperative nodal 
positivity are associated with increased metastatic risk. Clinical relevance The 
unpredictable response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is a significant driver 
of prognosis. The metastasis rates among good and poor responders receiving or 
not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were similar. Challenges remain in selecting 
the population that will benefit from additional treatment.

A lack of diversity in the biomedical research workforce significantly affects 
our ability to address the public health burden and financial costs associated 
with cancer health disparities. To address this issue, we created the Meharry 
Cancer Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP). The Meharry Cancer SURP is 
a 10-week intensive research experience designed to expose undergraduate 
students to the area of cancer health disparities; provide students with a 
greater understanding of basic, clinical and translational cancer research; and 
to inspire participants to pursue cancer-focused careers. During the first six 
years of the program a nationwide search was performed to identify and select 
10-17 participants per year. Students performed research projects with 
experienced investigators at either Meharry Medical College or Vanderbilt-Ingram 
Cancer Center. Each student participated in a week-long cancer biology mini 
course to ensure students understood fundamental concepts common to all cancers 
and relevance to the study of health disparities. They also attended research 
seminars given by oncologists and cancer researchers and career development 
sessions designed to provide information on cancer-focused career options and 
the tools required to submit competitive applications to medical and/or PhD 
graduate schools. Together these activities increased student awareness of 
cancer research and cancer health disparities. They also provided opportunities 
for participants to become part of the larger cancer research community.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic and predictive significance of 
supradiaphragmatic lymph node (SDLN) positivity detected by 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG 
PET/CT) in patients undergoing primary cytoreductive surgery for advanced 
epithelial ovarian cancer.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to PRISMA 
2020 guidelines and registered with PROSPERO. Studies reporting on overall 
survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and complete cytoreduction (R0) 
in patients with and without 18F-FDG PET/CT-detected SDLN metastases were 
identified through comprehensive database searches conducted on December 18, 
2024. Data from five retrospective, single-center studies comprising a total of 
605 patients were included in the quantitative synthesis. Meta-analyses were 
performed using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: SDLN positivity on 18F-FDG PET/CT was significantly associated with 
worse survival outcomes and lower resection rates. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) 
for OS was 1.60 (95% CI 1.19-2.25, p = 0.002) and for PFS 1.53 (95% CI 
1.19-1.96; p = 0.0009), indicating poorer prognosis in SDLN-positive patients. 
The odds of achieving complete cytoreduction were significantly reduced in this 
group (OR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.15-0.68, p = 0.003). While heterogeneity was low for 
progression-free and overall survival (I2 = 0%), moderate heterogeneity was 
observed in the analysis of complete cytoreduction (I2 = 54%). None of the 
included studies provided histologic confirmation of 18F-FDG PET/CT-positive 
SDLNs.
CONCLUSIONS: 18F-FDG PET/CT-detected SDLN positivity is associated with worse 
survival and lower resectability in advanced ovarian cancer. Due to lacking 
histologic confirmation and retrospective data, prospective validation is 
needed.

Contrary to tumor-infiltrating T cells with dysfunctional mitochondria, 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) preserve their mitochondrial activity in the 
nutrient-limited tumor microenvironment (TME) to sustain immunosuppression. Here 
we identify TNF receptor-associated protein-1 (TRAP1), a mitochondrial HSP90 
chaperone, as a metabolic checkpoint that restrains oxidative respiration and 
limits macrophage suppressive function. In the TME, TRAP1 is downregulated 
through TIM4-AMPK signaling, and its loss enhances immunoinhibitory activity, 
limits proinflammatory capacity and promotes tumor immune escape. 
Mechanistically, TRAP1 suppression augments electron transport chain activity 
and elevates the α-ketoglutarate/succinate ratio, remodeling mitochondrial 
homeostasis. The resulting accumulation of α-ketoglutarate further potentiates 
JMJD3-mediated histone demethylation, establishing transcriptional programs that 
reinforce an immunosuppressive state. Restoring TRAP1 by targeting TIM4 and 
JMJD3 reprograms TAMs, disrupts the immune-evasive TME and bolsters antitumor 
immunity. These findings establish TRAP1 as a critical regulator integrating 
metabolic and epigenetic control of suppressive TAM function and position the 
TRAP1 pathway as a promising target for cancer immunotherapy.

This study focuses on improving the detection of breast cancer at an early 
stage. The common approach for diagnosing breast cancer is mammography, but it 
is quite tedious as it is subject to subjective analysis. To address these 
challenges, the research will explore how the mammogram analysis employs deep 
learning-based techniques to enhance the screening process. Various computer 
vision models, including Visual Geometry Group (VGG) 19, Inception V3, and 
custom 20 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, are investigated 
using the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) mammogram dataset. 
The research community widely uses the DDSM for mammographic image analysis. In 
the domain of CNNs, the models have demonstrated considerable promise due to 
their efficacy in various tasks, such as image recognition and classification. 
It is also seen that the CNN model performance is enhanced through 
hyperparameter optimization. However, manually tuning hyperparameters is 
laborious and time-consuming. To overcome this challenge, automatic 
hyperparameter optimization of CNNs uses population-based metaheuristic 
approaches. This automation mitigates the time required for finding optimal 
hyperparameters and boosts the CNN model's efficacy. The proposed approach 
involves using the Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) algorithm to optimize 
CNN to enhance breast cancer detection. BFO optimizes hyperparameters such as 
filter size, number of filters, and hidden layers in the CNN model. The 
experiments show that the proposed BFO-CNN method outperforms other 
state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, showing improvements of 7.62% for 
VGG 19, 9.16% for InceptionV3, and 1.78% for the custom CNN-20 layer model. In 
conclusion, this work aims to leverage deep learning techniques and automatic 
hyperparameter optimization to enhance breast cancer detection through mammogram 
analysis. The BFO-CNN model has much potential to improve breast cancer 
diagnosis accuracy compared to conventional CNN architecture.

Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer and the leading cause of 
cancer-related deaths in Saudi Arabia. However, this malignancy can be tackled 
effectively with early detection, resulting in better patient outcomes and 
reduced mortality rates. Breast screening, whether self-screening or clinical 
screening, plays a pivotal role in early BC detection. Hence, understanding, 
knowledge, and perception of BC and its risk factors are very important in early 
BC diagnosis. The current study has been conducted to assess the understanding, 
knowledge, perception, and attitude of educated population of Asir region 
towards BC and its risk factors. The study was conducted among the participants 
aged 18 or above in various institutions of the Asir region in KSA using an 
online pre-validated questionnaire to assess the understanding, knowledge, and 
perception of BC and its risk factors. The study was completed by a total of 979 
participants. The proportion of participants who demonstrated adequate knowledge 
and positive perception regarding the role of breast self-examination and early 
detection was greater than 50%, indicating an overall satisfactory level of 
breast cancer awareness among the study population. However, in identifying the 
risk factors of BC, < 50% of participants correctly identified the 8 correct 
risk factors out of 12. When analyzing the association of BC awareness with 
demographic characteristics, the results revealed that females had 2.012 times 
higher odds of BC awareness than males. Additionally, participants with higher 
education qualifications had 3.867 times higher odds of BC awareness than those 
with bachelor's degrees. Also, the results show that demographic factors like 
female sex, age, marital status, urban residence, occupation (administrative 
staff), and higher education level were associated with the level of knowledge 
about breast cancer risk factors. Participants demonstrated generally good 
knowledge and perception of breast cancer, particularly regarding early 
detection and available screening tools. However, awareness of breast cancer 
risk factors was notably limited. Therefore, there is a clear need for targeted 
and region-specific awareness programs to enhance understanding and promote 
early intervention.
