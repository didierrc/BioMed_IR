In this study the impact of achenes on polyphenolic compounds, ascorbic acids, 
and antioxidant activities in strawberry purees at production and after storage 
at 6 and 22 degrees C for 8 and 16 weeks was investigated. Strawberry purees 
were made from flesh, berry, and achene-enriched homogenate and contained 0, 
1.2, and 2.9% achenes, respectively. At production, strawberry purees made from 
flesh contained more anthocyanins, p-coumaroyl glycosides, and ascorbic acids, 
whereas increasing achene levels caused increasing levels of ellagic acid 
derivatives, proanthocyanidins, flavonols, total phenolics (TP), and antioxidant 
activities. In addition, the anthocyanins, TP, and ferric reducing ability power 
(FRAP) in purees with more achenes were better retained during storage. Ascorbic 
acids and anthocyanins declined rapidly during storage, whereas other 
polyphenols and antioxidant activities were more stable; that is, the 
contributions from anthocyanins and ascorbic acids to TP and antioxidant 
activities decreased. The findings that achenes contributed significantly to 
polyphenol content and stability of strawberry purees may be interesting in a 
nutritional and, thus, commercial, perspective.

Epicatechin is a flavan-3-ol that is commonly present in green teas, red wine, 
cocoa products, and many fruits, such as apples. There is considerable interest 
in the bioavailability of epicatechin after oral ingestion. In vivo studies have 
shown that low levels of epicatechin are absorbed and found in the circulation 
as glucuronides, methylated and sulfated forms. Recent research has demonstrated 
protective effects of epicatechin and one of its in vivo metabolites, 
3'-O-methyl epicatechin, against neuronal cell death induced by oxidative 
stress. Thus, we are interested in the ability of ingested epicatechin to cross 
the blood brain barrier and target the brain. Rats were administered 100 mg/kg 
body weight/d epicatechin orally for 1, 5, and 10 d. Plasma and brain extracts 
were analyzed by HPLC with photodiode array detection and LC-MS/MS. This study 
reports the presence of the epicatechin glucuronide and 3'-O-methyl epicatechin 
glucuronide formed after oral ingestion in the rat brain tissue.

Wheat grain is recognized as a good source of potentially health-enhancing 
components such as dietary fiber, phenolics, tocopherols, and carotenoids. 
Anthocyanins, another group of bioactive compounds, are found in blue and purple 
wheat grains. In the present study, a blue aleurone spring wheat line ""Purendo 
38"" with relatively high content of total anthocyanins was used to investigate 
the composition and stability of anthocyanins over three crop years. Commercial 
cultivars of purple (Konini) and red (Katepwa) wheats were included in the 
study. Separation of anthocyanins by high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) showed that each wheat had a distinct anthocyanin profile. Four major 
anthocyanins were separated from blue wheat extracts as compared to five 
anthocyanins in purple wheat. Cyanidin 3-glucoside was the predominant 
anthocyanin in purple wheat, whereas it was the second major anthocyanin in blue 
wheat. The predominant anthocyanin in blue wheat, making up approximately 41% of 
the total anthocyanin content, remains to be structurally unidentified. Blue 
wheat anthocyanins were thermally most stable at pH 1. Their degradation was 
slightly lower at pH 3 as compared to pH 5. Increasing the temperature from 65 
to 95 degrees C increased degradation of blue wheat anthocyanins. Addition of 
SO(2) during heating of blue wheat had a stabilizing effect on anthocyanin 
pigments. The optimal SO(2) concentrations were 500-1000 ppm for whole meals and 
1000-3000 ppm for isolated anthocyanins. Further studies are underway to 
identify and verify individual anthocyanins in blue wheat and their potential 
end uses.

Anthocyanin pigments from a wide variety of edible and ornamental black, blue, 
pink, purple, red, and white wheat, barley, corn, rice, and wild rice were 
identified and quantified to evaluate their potential as natural colorants or 
functional food ingredients. The total anthocyanin contents varied significantly 
and exhibited a range of 7-3276 microg/g. Some grains, such as red rice and 
black rice, contained a limited number of pigments, whereas others, such as 
blue, pink, purple, and red corns, had complex anthocyanin profiles. Of the 42 
anthocyanin compounds observed, 9 were characterized by comparison of the 
spectroscopic and chromatographic properties with those of authentic standards. 
The remaining compounds were tentatively identified on the basis of 
spectroscopic properties and electrospray ionization mass spectra. The most 
abundant anthocyanins were cyanidin 3-glucoside in black and red rices and in 
blue, purple, and red corns, pelargonidin 3-glucoside in pink corn, and 
delphinidin 3-glucoside in blue wheat.

Monomeric and oligomeric procyanidins present in cocoa liquors and chocolates 
were separated and quantified in four different laboratories using a 
normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with 
fluorescence detection. Procyanidin standards through decamers were obtained by 
extraction from cocoa beans, enrichment by Sephadex LH-20 gel permeation 
chromatography, and final purification by preparative normal-phase HPLC. The 
purity of each oligomeric fraction was assessed using HPLC coupled to mass 
spectrometry. A composite standard was then prepared, and calibration curves 
were generated for each oligomeric class using a quadratic fit of area sum 
versus concentration. Results obtained by each of the laboratories were in close 
agreement, which suggests this method is reliable and reproducible for 
quantification of procyanidins. Furthermore, the procyanidin content of the 
samples was correlated to the antioxidant capacity measured using the ORAC assay 
as an indicator for potential biological activity.

Epidemiologic studies revealed low mortality in hormone-dependent cancer in 
Japanese women and men consuming a traditional diet. We previously found that 
certain diphenolic food components, lignans and isoflavonoids, which are 
converted to biologically active hormone-like substances by intestinal 
microflora, may be cancer-protective agents. Therefore, we studied urinary 
excretion of these compounds (enterolactone, enterodiol, daidzein, equol, and 
O-desmethylangolensin) in 10 women and 9 men in a rural village south of Kyoto, 
Japan. The subjects consumed a typical low-fat diet with much rice and soy 
products, fish, and vegetables. An isotope-dilution gas chromatographic-mass 
spectrometric method was used for the assays. The urinary excretion of lignans 
was low but that of the isoflavonoids was very high. The excretion of 
isoflavonoids correlated with soybean-product intake. The low mortality in 
breast and prostate cancer of Japanese women and men, respectively, may be due 
to the high intake of soybean products.

The health-promoting effects of whole-grain consumption have been attributed in 
part to their unique phytochemical contents and profiles that complement those 
found in fruits and vegetables. Wheat is an important component of the human 
diet; however, little is known about the phytochemical profiles and total 
antioxidant activities of milled fractions of different wheat varieties. The 
objectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of phytochemicals 
(total phenolics, flavonoids, ferulic acid, and carotenoids) and to determine 
hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity in milled fractions (endosperm 
and bran/germ) of three different wheat varieties, two of which were grown in 
two environments. Grain samples of each of the wheat varieties were milled into 
endosperm and bran/germ fractions. Each fraction was extracted and analyzed for 
total phenolics, ferulic acid, flavonoids, carotenoid contents, and hydrophilic 
and lipophilic antioxidant activities. Total phenolic content of bran/germ 
fractions (2867-3120 micromol of gallic acid equiv/100 g) was 15-18-fold higher 
(p < 0.01) than that of respective endosperm fractions. Ferulic acid content 
ranged from 1005 to 1130 micromol/100 g in bran/germ fractions and from 15 to 21 
micromol/100 g in the endosperm fractions. The bran/germ fraction flavonoid 
content was 740-940 micromol of catechin equiv/100 g. On average, bran/germ 
fractions of wheat had 4-fold more lutein, 12-fold more zeaxanthin, and 2-fold 
more beta-cryptoxanthin than the endosperm fractions. Hydrophilic antioxidant 
activity of bran/germ samples (7.1-16.4 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g) was 
13-27-fold higher than that of the respective endosperm samples. Similarly, 
lipophilic antioxidant activity was 28-89-fold higher in the bran/germ fractions 
(1785-4669 nmol of vitamin E equiv/g). Hydrophilic antioxidant activity 
contribution to the total antioxidant activity (hydrophilic + lipophilic) was 
>80%. In whole-wheat flour, the bran/germ fraction contributed 83% of the total 
phenolic content, 79% of the total flavonoid content, 51% of the total lutein, 
78% of the total zeaxanthin, 42% of the total beta-cryptoxanthin, 85% of the 
total hydrophilic antioxidant activity, and 94% of the total lipophilic 
antioxidant activity. Our results showed that different milled fractions of 
wheat have different profiles of both hydrophilic and lipophilic phytochemicals. 
These findings provide information necessary for evaluating contributions to 
good health and disease prevention from whole-wheat consumption.

This study presents the effects of soaking, cooking, and industrial dehydration 
treatments on phenolic profile and also on antioxidant properties in Pardina 
lentil. HPLC-PAC and HPLC-MS (ESI) analysis identified a total of 35 phenolic 
compounds in raw and processed lentil flours, corresponding to catechins and 
procyanidins (69% of the total of identified phenolic compounds), flavonols 
(17%), flavones, and flavanones (5%), and hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic 
compounds (5 and 4%, respectively). During the industrial process, catechins and 
procyanidins, flavonols, flavones, and flavanones decreased, while 
hydroxybenzoic compounds exhibited an important increase. In addition, raw 
lentils showed high values of the antioxidant activity (66.97 μmol Trolox/g); 
although the thermal processing promotes decreased, the levels of antioxidant 
activity were still relevant. Thus, the significant occurrence of bioactive 
phenolic compounds along with the interesting antioxidant capacity of dehydrated 
lentil flours make them useful for daily inclusion in the human diet as 
ready-to-use for special meals to specific populations.

Fresh and sun-dried dates of three native varieties from Oman, namely, Fard, 
Khasab, and Khalas, were examined for their antioxidant activity and total 
contents of anthocyanins, carotenoids, and phenolics, as well as free and bound 
phenolic acids. All results are expressed as mean value +/- standard deviation 
(n = 3) on a fresh weight basis. Fresh date varieties were found to be a good 
source of antioxidants (11687-20604 micromol of Trolox equiv/g), total contents 
of anthocyanins (0.24-1.52 mg of cyanidin 3-glucoside equiv/100 g), carotenoids 
(1.31-3.03 mg/100 g), phenolics (134-280 mg of ferulic acid equiv/100 g), free 
phenolic acids (2.61-12.27 mg/100 g), and bound phenolic acids (6.84-30.25 
mg/100 g). A significant (p < 0.05) amount of antioxidants and carotenoids was 
lost after sun-drying of dates, whereas the total content of phenolics and free 
and bound phenolic acids increased significantly (p < 0.05). Anthocyanins were 
detected only in fresh dates. Date varieties had different levels and patterns 
of phenolic acids. Four free phenolic acids (protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, 
syringic acid, and ferulic acid) and nine bound phenolic acids (gallic acid, 
protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, 
syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and o-coumaric acid) were 
tentatively identified. Of the date varieties studied, Khalas, which is 
considered to be premium quality, had higher antioxidant activity, total 
carotenoids, and bound phenolic acids than other varieties. These results 
suggest that all date varieties serve as a good source of natural antioxidants 
and could potentially be considered as a functional food or functional food 
ingredient, although some of their antioxidant constituents are lost during 
sun-drying.

Four different colored carrots, orange, purple with orange core, yellow, and 
white, were examined for their content of phenolics, antioxidant vitamins, and 
sugars as well as their volatiles and sensory responses. A total of 35 volatiles 
were identified in all carrots, 27 positively. White carrot contained the 
highest content of volatiles, followed by orange, purple, and yellow. In total, 
11, 16, 10, and 9 phenolic compounds were determined for the first time in 
orange, purple, yellow, and white carrots, respectively. Of these, chlorogenic 
acid was the most predominant phenolic compound in all carrot varieties. 
Differences (p < 0.05) in relative sweetness, the contents of vitamin C and 
alpha- and beta-carotenes, and certain flavor characteristics were observed 
among the colored carrot varieties examined. Purple carrots contained 2.2 and 
2.3 times more alpha- and beta-carotenes (trace in yellow; not detected in 
white) than orange carrots, respectively. Purple carrot may be used in place of 
other carrot varieties to take advantage of its nutraceutical components.

The effect of roasting on taste-active components of 18 native hazelnut 
varieties, grown in the Giresun province of Turkey, was assessed. Samples were 
examined for their sugars, organic acids, condensed tannins, and free phenolic 
acids. Six sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose, myo-inositol, raffinose, and 
stachyose), seven organic acids (oxalic, maleic, citric, malic, lactic, 
succinic, and acetic), and one phenolic acid (gallic acid) were positively 
identified in natural and roasted hazelnut varieties; among these, sucrose, 
malic acid, and gallic acid predominated, respectively. Total sugars among 
hazelnut varieties ranged from 1.99 to 4.94 g/100 g, organic acids from 0.96 to 
2.72 g/100 g, condensed tannins from 3.99 to 40.56 mg of catechin equivalents/g, 
and gallic acid from 0.159 to 0.871 mg/100 g. Differences existed in the sugar 
and organic acid contents between natural and roasted hazelnut varieties, but 
they did not follow any particular trend. Significant losses (p < 0.05) in 
condensed tannins ( approximately 97.3%) and gallic acid ( approximately 66.7%) 
were noted when the hazelnuts were roasted. The present work suggests that 
roasting resulted in significant loss in condensed tannins and gallic acid due 
to the removal of the brown skin. The effect of roasting on sugars and organic 
acids was not noteworthy.

An analytical method based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) and followed by 
liquid chromatographic separation and ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) is 
proposed for the determination of 10 phenolic compounds which participate on 
beer stability and sensory properties in alcohol-free beers. Acetonitrile was 
found to be the most appropriate solvent for the elution of polyphenolic 
compounds adsorbed on C18 cartridges. The performance of the method was assessed 
by the evaluation of parameters such as absolute recovery (generally higher than 
60%), repeatability (lower than 10%), linearity (r2 higher than 0.993) and 
limits of quantitation (ranging from 1 to 37 microg/L); no matrix effects were 
observed. The polyphenol content of different Spanish alcohol-free beers is 
presented. Five phenolic compounds such as protocatechuic, p-coumaric, ferulic, 
caffeic acids, and (+)-catechin were identified at levels lower than 10 mg/L.

Polyphenols in the peel and pulp of 15 Basque cider apple varieties were 
determined by accelerated solvent extraction followed by reversed phase 
high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. It was 
observed that the polyphenolic composition in apple peel depended on varieties, 
whereas the main classes of phenolic compounds in apple pulp were flavan-3-ols 
and hydroxycinnamic acids in all cases, representing both together between 86 
and 95% of total polyphenols assayed.

The polyphenolic compositions of 31 Basque cider apple cultivars were determined 
in pulp, peel, and juice by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode 
array detection analysis of crude extracts and after thiolysis. Total 
polyphenols are distributed in a wide concentration range depending on the 
cultivar. Procyanidins are the class of polyphenols that present major 
concentrations in apple. Their average degrees of polymerization range from 4 to 
8 depending on the cultivar. Apple cultivars were technologically classified 
into bitter and nonbitter categories using different classification systems 
obtained by applying several pattern recognition techniques, such as principal 
component analysis, K-nearest neighbors, soft independent modeling of class 
analogy, partial least-squares, and multilayer feed-forward-artificial neural 
networks, to apple pulp, peel, or juice data (individual polyphenol 
concentrations, total procyanidin content, and the average degree of 
polymerization of procyanidins). Bitter apple cultivars present higher contents 
of flavan-3-ols and/or dihydrochalcones than nonbitter cultivars. Detailed 
knowledge of the polyphenolic profile of each apple cultivar affords information 
about their susceptibility to oxidation, their sensory properties (bitterness, 
astringency), and their possible influence on the characteristics and quality of 
the final product (juice, cider) when apples are processed.

Six selected phenolic aglycons (caffeic and ellagic acids, kaempferol, 
quercetin, myricetin, and morin) in nine types of berries, and their changes as 
influenced by jam processing, have been evaluated using optimized HPLC with 
diode-array detection. The berry samples, fresh and after jam processing, were 
analyzed, and the total amounts of selected phenolics as aglycons were 
identified and determined by acid hydrolysis. Their contents in fresh and jam 
samples did not indicate appreciable changes; therefore, the influence of jam 
processing on these selected phenolics in berries was suggested to be small, and 
was mostly present in berries as several conjugated forms that were 
glycosylated, esterified, etc., in the samples. The total phenolic content of 
each sample was also determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The three samples 
of each berry, namely fresh, jam, and acid hydrolysate of the berry, had similar 
total phenolic contents. On the other hand, the scavenging effect on the 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was measured, and acid hydrolysates 
showed stronger activity than that of the fresh and jam-processed samples for 
all of the berry types.

Disposition of citrus flavonoids was evaluated after single oral doses of pure 
compounds (500 mg naringin and 500 mg hesperidin) and after multiple doses of 
combined grapefruit juice and orange juice and of once-daily grapefruit. 
Cumulative urinary recovery indicated low bioavailability ( < 25%) of naringin 
and hesperidin. The aglycones naringenin and hesperitin were detected in urine 
and plasma by positive chemical ionization-collisionally activated dissociation 
tandem mass spectrometry (PCI-CAD MS/MS). After juice administration, PCI-CAD 
MS/MS detected naringenin, hesperitin, and four related flavanones, tentatively 
identified as monomethoxy and dimethoxy derivatives. These methoxyflavanones 
appear to be absorbed from juice. Absorbed citrus flavanones may undergo 
glucuronidation before urinary excretion.

The ellagic acid, total phenolic, and vitamin C contents in four raspberry 
cultivars (Heritage, Autumn Bliss, Rubi, and Zeva) grown in Spain were detected 
and quantified by HPLC in fresh, just frozen, and stored fruits at -20 degrees C 
for a one year period. Ellagic acid [207-244 mg kg(-)(1) of fresh weight (fw)], 
total phenolic (137-1776 mg kg(-)(1) of fw), and vitamin C (221-312 mg kg(-)(1) 
of fw) contents in raw material were higher in the late cultivars Zeva and Rubi 
than in the early cultivars Autumn Bliss and Heritage. The freezing process 
slightly affected the values of extracted ellagic acid, total phenolic, and 
vitamin C content. At the end of long-term frozen storage (12 months), no 
significant change of total phenolic content extracted was observed, but 
significant decreases of 14-21% in ellagic acid and of 33-55% in vitamin C were 
quantified. Free radical scavenging capacity measured as antiradical efficiency 
(AE) depends on the seasonal period of harvest. Late cultivars, Rubi (6.1 x 
10(-)(4)) and Zeva (10.17 x 10(-)(4)), showed higher AE than early cultivars, 
Heritage (4.02 x 10(-)(4)) and Autumn Bliss (4.36 x 10(-)(4)). The freezing 
process produced a decrease of AE values in the four cultivars ranging between 4 
and 26%. During the frozen storage, the AE values reached after the freezing 
process remained unchanged.

The quantitative and qualitative evolution of the anthocyanins and volatile 
compounds of four raspberry cultivars (cvs. Heritage, Autumn Bliss, Zeva, and 
Rubi) growing in Spain were analyzed raw, just frozen, and during long-term 
frozen storage at -20 degrees C for a 1 year period. HS-SPME coupled with GC-MS 
and HPLC techniques were employed to study the evolution of the volatile 
compounds and the individual anthocyanins, respectively. The volatile aroma 
composition changes produced by the freezing process and long-term frozen 
storage were minimal. Only a significant increase in extraction capacity was 
obtained for alpha-ionone (27%) and for caryophyllene (67%) in Heritage at 12 
months of storage. The stability of anthocyanins to freezing and frozen storage 
depends on the seasonal period of harvest. Heritage and Autumn Bliss (early 
cultivars) were less affected by processing and long-term frozen storage (1 
year), and the total pigment extracted showed the tendency to increase 17 and 
5%, respectively. Rubi and Zeva (late cultivars) suffered a decreased trend on 
the total anthocyanin content of 4% for Rubi and 17.5% for Zeva. Cyanidin 
3-glucoside most easily suffered the degradative reactions that take place 
during processing and the storage period.

A number of potential antioxidants have been evaluated for their effect on 
formation of radicals in beer using the electron spin resonance (ESR) lag phase 
method. Sulfite was found to be the only compound that was able to delay the 
formation of radicals, whereas phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids, 
catechin, epicatechin, and proanthocyanidin dimers had no effect on the 
formation of radicals. Ascorbate, cystein, and cysteamin were on the other hand 
found to be prooxidants. It is suggested that antioxidants must be able to 
either scavenge peroxides or trap metal ions in order to be effective in beer. 
The effectiveness of sulfite is suggested to be a consequence of its 
two-electron nonradical producing reaction with peroxides.

Phenolic compounds are secondary plant metabolites which have long been 
associated with flavor and color characteristics of fruits and vegetables. These 
phenolic compounds attract great interest due to their postulated health 
protecting properties. However, adequate intakes and absorption rate of phenolic 
compounds are necessary for these beneficial effects. Until now, little is known 
about alterations of phenolic compounds content by the cooking process. In the 
present study, the influence of different volumes of cooking water on the amount 
of selected phenolic marker compounds resting in the vegetables was assessed. In 
zucchini, rutin was quantified as a marker for flavonoid glycosides. Chlorogenic 
acid, representative of phenolic acids was analyzed in carrots. In beans, rutin 
and quercitrin, both belonging to flavonoid glycosides, were investigated. In 
potatoes, chlorogenic and caffeic acid were determined. The cooking of zucchini, 
beans and carrots with smaller amounts of water resulted in significant higher 
content of phenolic phytochemicals in the vegetables compared to cooking with 
larger water volumes. For potatoes, which showed great variations in content of 
phenolic acids after cooking, no significant differences in phenolic acids was 
observed. It can be concluded from these observations, that real intakes of 
phenolic compounds from cooked vegetables are lower and that the amounts 
consumed are therefore overestimated.

The contents of pnenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers were quantified by 
HPLC analysis after alkaline hydrolysis in kernels of 17 rye (Secale cereale L.) 
varieties grown in one location in Denmark during 1997 and 1998. Significant 
variations (P < 0.05) with regard to the concentration of the analyzed 
components were observed among the different rye varieties and also between 
different harvest years. However, the content of phenolic acids in the analyzed 
rye varieties was narrow compared to cereals such as wheat and barley. The 
concentration of ferulic acid, the most abundant phenolic acid ranged from 900 
to 1170 microgram g(-1) dry matter. The content in sinapic acid ranged from 70 
to 140 microgram g(-1) dry matter, p-coumaric acid ranged from 40 to 70 
microgram g(-1) dry matter, and caffeic, p-hydroxybenzoic, protocatechuic, and 
vanillic acids were all detected in concentrations less than 20 microgram g(-1) 
dry matter. The most abundant ferulic acid dehydrodimer 8-O-4 -DiFA was 
quantified in concentrations from 130 to 200 microgram g(-1) dry matter followed 
by 8,5 -DiFA benzofuran form (50-100 microgram g(-1) dry matter), 5,5 -DiFA

Major brands of cocoa powder products present in the Spanish market were 
analyzed for monomeric flavanols [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] and 
flavonols [quercetin-3-glucuronide, quercetin-3-glucoside (isoquercitrin), 
quercetin-3-arabinoside, and quercetin]. In addition, the influence of the 
manufacturing process of cocoa powder products, in particular, the 
alkalinization treatment ( Dutching), on the original content of these 
flavonoids has been studied. (-)-Epicatechin was in the range of 116.02-730.26 
microg/g, whereas (+)-catechin was in the range of 81.40-447.62 microg/g in the 
commercial cocoa products studied. Among flavonols, quercetin-3-arabinoside and 
isoquercitrin were the major flavonols in the cocoa powder products studied, 
ranging from 2.10 to 40.33 microg/g and from 3.97 to 42.74 microg/g, 
respectively, followed by quercetin-3-glucuronide (0.13-9.88 microg/g) and 
quercetin aglycone (0.28-3.25 microg/g). To our knowledge, these results are the 
first quantitative data in relation to the content of individualized flavonol 
derivatives in commercial cocoa powder products. The alkalinization treatment 
resulted in 60% loss of the mean total flavonoid content. Among flavanols, 
(-)-epicatechin presented a larger decline (67%, as a mean percentage 
difference) than (+)-catechin (38%), probably because of its epimerization into 
(-)-catechin, a less bioavailable form of catechin. A decline was also confirmed 
for di-, tri-, and tetrameric procyanidins. In the case of flavonols, quercetin 
presented the highest loss (86%), whereas quercetin-3-glucuronide, 
quercetin-3-arabinoside, and isoquercitrin showed a similar decrease (58, 62, 
and 61%, respectively). It is concluded that the large decrease found in the 
flavonoid content of natural cocoa powder, together with the observed change in 
the monomeric flavanol profile that results from the alkalinization treatment, 
could affect the antioxidant properties and the polyphenol biovailability of 
cocoa powder products.

Phenolic and orthodiphenolic compounds together with carotenoids, tocopherols, 
pigments, and fatty acids were tested for their antioxidant effect in 79 samples 
of virgin olive oils cv. Picual and Hojiblanca. A linear regression based on the 
oleic/linoleic ratio and the contents of phenols and tocopherols showed a good 
correlation (adjusted-R(2) = 0.91) with the stability measured by Rancimat, 
later verified with an external text set (adjusted-R(2) = 0.95). A tentative 
study on the percentage contribution of each chemical variable to stability is 
discussed. The contribution of phenolic and orthodiphenolic compounds was around 
51%, the composition of fatty acids 24%, and in less percentage 
alpha-tocopherol, carotenoids, and chlorophylls. No effect, or very little, was 
shown by beta- and gamma-tocopherols.

The objective of this work was to quantify the flavonoids present in foods most 
commonly consumed by the Brazilian population. The predominant flavonoids found 
in largest abundance in all of the analyzed vegetables were glycosides of 
quercetin. In lettuce, a small amount of luteolin was also detected. In sweet 
pepper, quercetin and luteolin were both present. White onion [48-56 mg/100 g of 
fresh weight (FW), expressed as aglycon], red onion (40-100 mg/100 g of FW), red 
lettuce (67-67.2 mg/100 g of FW), arugula (41-118 mg/100 g of FW), and chicory 
(18-38 mg/100 g of FW) were highest in total flavonoids. In fruits, the highest 
concentrations of flavonoids were found in the peel (125-170 mg/100 g of FW) and 
pulp (35-44 mg/100 g of FW) of oranges and in some apple varieties (14-36 mg/100 
g of FW). Variability in flavonoid content due to time of harvesting was high 
for leafy vegetables and red onions. The estimated ingestion by Brazilian 
population ranged from 60 to 106 mg/day.

Phenolic and volatile compounds of extra virgin olive oil (Olea europaea L. Cv. 
Cornicabra) with regard to fruit ripening and irrigation management.

de Castilla-La Mancha, Ciudad Real, Spain.

This study investigated the effect of both the degree of ripening of the olive 
fruit and irrigation management-rain-fed, two different regulated deficit 
irrigations (RDI), the method proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations (known as FAO), and 125 FAO (125% FAO)-on the phenolic and 
volatile composition of Cornicabra virgin olive oils obtained during two crop 
seasons. Secoiridoid phenolic derivatives greatly decreased upon increase of 
both irrigation and ripening, for example, the 3,4-DHPEA-EDA content decreased 
from 770 to 450 mg/kg through fruit ripening under rain-fed conditions and from 
676 to 388 mg/kg from rain-fed conditions to FAO irrigation treatment (at a 
ripeness index of approximately 4). Moreover, secoiridoid derivatives of 
hydroxytyrosol decreased more than those of tyrosol. The levels of major 
volatile components decreased in the course of ripening but were higher in 
irrigated olive oils: for example, the E-2-hexenal content ranged between 4.2 
and 2.6 mg/kg (expressed as 4-methyl-2-pentanol) over fruit maturation under 
rain-fed conditions and between 8.0 and 3.5 mg/kg under FAO scheduling. It is 
important to note that where water was applied only from the beginning of August 
(RDI-2), when oil begins to accumulate in the fruit, the resulting virgin olive 
oil presented a phenol and volatile profile similar to those of the FAO and 125 
FAO methods, but with a considerable reduction in the amount of water supplied 
to the olive orchard.

The antioxidant catechin content of chocolate is four times that of tea. 
Chocolate contributed 20% of the catechin intake in a representative sample of 
the Dutch population, and tea contributes 55%. Epidemiological assessments of 
health effects of tea should include other foods that are sources of catechins.

Procyanidins are a subclass of flavonoids found in commonly consumed foods that 
have attracted increasing attention due to their potential health benefits. 
However, little is known regarding their dietary intake levels because detailed 
quantitative information on the procyanidin profiles present in many food 
products is lacking. Therefore, the procyanidin content of red wine, chocolate, 
cranberry juice and four varieties of apples has been determined. On average, 
chocolate and apples contained the largest procyanidin content per serving 
(164.7 and 147.1 mg, respectively) compared with red wine and cranberry juice 
(22.0 and 31.9 mg, respectively). However, the procyanidin content varied 
greatly between apple samples (12.3-252.4 mg/serving) with the highest amounts 
on average observed for the Red Delicious (207.7 mg/serving) and Granny Smith 
(183.3 mg/serving) varieties and the lowest amounts in the Golden Delicious 
(92.5 mg/serving) and McIntosh (105.0 mg/serving) varieties. The compositional 
data reported herein are important for the initial understanding of which foods 
contribute most to the dietary intake of procyanidins and may be used to compile 
a database necessary to infer epidemiological relationships to health and 
disease.

Catechins, compounds that belong to the flavonoid class, are potentially 
beneficial to human health. To enable an epidemiological evaluation of 
catechins, data on their contents in foods are required. HPLC with UV and 
fluorescence detection was used to determine the levels of (+)-catechin, 
(-)-epicatechin, (+)-gallocatechin (GC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), 
(-)-epicatechin gallate (ECg), and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) in 8 
types of black tea, 18 types of red and white wines, apple juice, grape juice, 
iced tea, beer, chocolate milk, and coffee. Tea infusions contained high levels 
of catechins (102-418 mg of total catechins/L), and tea was the only beverage 
that contained GC, EGC, ECg, and EGCg in addition to (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin. Catechin concentrations were still substantial in red wine 
(27-96 mg/L), but low to negligible amounts were found in white wine, 
commercially available fruit juices, iced tea, and chocolate milk. Catechins 
were absent from beer and coffee. The data reported here provide a base for the 
epidemiological evaluation of the effect of catechins on the risk for chronic 
diseases.

Secondary phenolic metabolites play an important role in plant defense 
mechanisms, and increasing evidence indicates that many are important in human 
health. To date, few studies have investigated the impact of various 
agricultural practices on levels of secondary plant metabolites. To address this 
issue, the total phenolic (TP) content of marionberries, strawberries, and corn 
grown by sustainable, organic, or conventional cultural practices were measured. 
Additionally, the effects of three common postharvest processing treatments 
(freezing, freeze-drying, and air-drying) on the TP content of these 
agricultural products were also investigated. Statistically higher levels of TPs 
were consistently found in organically and sustainably grown foods as compared 
to those produced by conventional agricultural practices. In all samples, 
freeze-drying preserved higher levels of TPs in comparison with air-drying.

The relationship between resveratrol (RES) bioavalability and its effect on 
tumor growth was investigated. Tissue levels of RES were studied after i.v. and 
oral administration of trans-resveratrol (t-RES) to rabbits, rats, and mice. 
Half-life of RES in plasma, after i.v. administration of 20 mg t-RES/kg b.wt., 
was very short (e.g., 14.4 min in rabbits). The highest concentration of RES in 
plasma, either after i.v. or oral administration (e.g., 2.6 +/- 1.0 microM in 
mice 2.5 min after receiving 20 mg t-RES/kg orally), was reached within the 
first 5 min in all animals studied. Extravascular levels (brain, lung, liver, 
and kidney) of RES, which paralleled those in plasma, were always < 1 nmol/g 
fresh tissue. RES measured in plasma or tissues was in the trans form (at least 
99%). Hepatocytes metabolized t-RES in a dose-dependent fashion (e.g., 43 nmol 
of t-RES/g x min in the presence of 20 microM tRES), which means that the liver 
can remove circulating RES very rapidly. In vitro B16 melanoma (B16M) cell 
proliferation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was inhibited by 
t-RES in a concentration-dependent fashion (100% inhibition of tumor growth was 
found in the presence of 5 microM t-RES). Addition of 10 microM H(2)O(2) to B16M 
cells, cultured in the presence of 5 microM t-RES, reactivated cell growth. Oral 
administration of t-RES (20 mg/kg twice per day; or included in the drinking 
water at 23 mg/l) did not inhibit growth of B16M inoculated into the footpad of 
mice (solid growth). However, oral administration of t-RES (as above) decreased 
hepatic metastatic invasion of B16M cells inoculated intrasplenically. The 
antimetastatic mechanism involves a t-RES (1 microM)-induced inhibition of 
vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in the hepatic sinusoidal 
endothelium (HSE), which consequently decreased in vitro B16M cell adhesion to 
the endothelium via very late activation antigen 4 (VLA-4).

The antioxidant activity of wheatgrass, which is consumed as a dietary 
supplement, was estimated at different levels. The methods employed include FRAP 
(ferric reducing antioxidant power), ABTS 
(2,2'-azobis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and DPPH 
(1,1'-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) assays. Aqueous and ethanol extracts of 
wheatgrass grown under different conditions over a period of 6, 7, 8, 10 and 15 
days were used. Lipid peroxidation and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) 
were determined and utilized to check the potency of a few selected extracts. 
Different conditions used for growth were (1) tap water, (2) tap water with 
nutrients, (3) soil and tap water, and (4) soil with nutrients. For comparison, 
a commercially available wheatgrass tablet was analysed. To explain the reasons 
behind the observed differences, the total phenolic and flavonoid contents of 
the extracts were measured. These contents increased with growth under all the 
conditions. The ethanol extracts were found to have a higher phenolic and 
flavonoid content than the aqueous extracts. The highest FRAP values occurred on 
day 15 of growth under condition 4, the values being 0.463 and 0.573 mmol of 
ascorbic acid and Trolox equivalents/100 g fresh wheatgrass for aqueous and 
ethanol extracts, respectively. In the aqueous extracts no specific trend was 
observed with the DPPH assay for the different conditions nor for the growth 
period. In the case of ethanol extracts, however, it increased with the growth 
period and the wheatgrass grown in condition 4 was found to be the most 
effective. These extracts were also found to inhibit significantly 
ascorbate-Fe2+ induced lipid peroxidation in rat liver mitochondria. The ORAC 
values of aqueous and ethanol extracts of day 10 with condition 4 were found to 
be 39.9 and 48.2, respectively, being higher than those reported for many 
natural extracts or vegetables.

The effects of product and preparation variables on the in-cup chemical 
composition of tea extracts is of interest because the appearance and taste 
characteristics and the possible health effects of a tea liquor arise from the 
chemical components extracted from the leaf during tea preparation. A 
comprehensive study was therefore undertaken to determine the contributions of 
product and preparation variables on the total soluble solids, caffeine, and 
polyphenol contents of tea extracts. The results of this study show that the 
variety, growing environment, manufacturing conditions, and grade (particle 
size) of the tea leaves each influence the tea leaf and final infusion 
compositions. In addition, the composition of the tea infusion was shown to be 
influenced by whether the tea was contained in a teabag and, if so, the size and 
material of construction of the bag. Finally, the preparation method, including 
the amounts of tea and water used, infusion time, and amount of agitation, was 
shown to be a major determinant of the component concentrations of tea beverages 
as consumed. An illustration of the variation introduced by these product and 
preparation factors is provided by comparing solids, caffeine, and polyphenol 
contents of green and black tea infusions when commercial products are prepared 
according to the instructions given on their packaging.

The major flavanone-7-O-glycoside constituents in citrus fruit juices (naringin, 
hesperidin, neohesperidin, narirutin, and eriocitrin) were separated as 
diastereomers by multidimensional liquid chromatography. The method consisted of 
coupling two HPLC columns: a reversed-phase (RP(18)) column was used for the 
separation of flavanone glycosides, which were, then, individually switched into 
a carboxymethylated beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD)-based column and resolved as the 
corresponding stereoisomers. The method was used for the full analysis of 
flavanone glycosides in fresh hand-squeezed and commercial fruit juices by 
combining the quantitative estimation with the diastereomeric analysis. 
Quantitative data were in general consistent with previously reported data in 
this field. CC-LC isomer analysis was carried out by coupling the beta-CD column 
with a mass spectrometer operated with negative ion electrospray ionization 
(ESI-MS). The results showed that hesperidin was present in orange juices almost 
exclusively as the 2S isomer, whereas narirutin had mainly the 2R configuration. 
In grapefruit juices (2S)-naringin prevailed with the respect to the 2R isomer, 
whereas the opposite was true for narirutin. Lemon juices contained eriocitrin 
stereoisomers in equal amount (50% each), but hesperidin was almost exclusively 
found as the 2S isomer. Significant differences of the diastereomeric ratios 
were observed between freshly squeezed juices and juices from commercial 
sources.

Sorghum procyanidins were characterized and quantified from two brown sorghum 
varieties and their processed products by normal phase HPLC with fluorescence 
detection. The DP of the procyanidins was determined by thiolysis. 
Quantification was done by using purified oligomeric and polymeric cocoa 
procyanidins as external standards. Sorghum procyanidins were composed mostly of 
high MW (DP > 10) polymers. Significant differences were observed in levels as 
well as distribution of the different MW procyanidins between the sorghums. 
Processing of the sorghum brans into cookies and bread significantly reduced the 
levels of procyanidins; this effect was more pronounced in the higher MW 
polymers. Cookies had a higher retention of procyanidins (42-84%) than bread 
(13-69%). Extrusion of sorghum grain resulted in an increase in the levels of 
procyanidin oligomers with DP </= 4 and decrease in polymers with DP >/= 6. This 
suggests a possible breakdown of the high MW polymers to the lower MW 
constituents during extrusion. Processing changes not only the content of 
procyanidins in sorghum products but also the relative ratio of the different 
molecular weights.

The aims of the present study were to determine the level of (-)-epicatechin 
(EC) and its metabolites in rat plasma after oral administration of cocoa powder 
and to evaluate the protective effect of cocoa powder in terms of suppressing 
the oxidation of plasma components. Rats were orally administered 1 g cocoa 
powder/kg body weight, containing 7.80 mg EC, and their blood was collected 
before administration and at designated time intervals thereafter. The EC and 
its metabolites in plasma were treated with beta-glucuronidase and/or sulfatase, 
then analysed by HPLC and by liquid chromatography-MS. Several EC-related 
compounds were detected in plasma such as free EC, and glucuronide, sulfate, and 
glucuronide-sulfate conjugates of non-methylated or methylated EC. All EC 
metabolites showed a maximum concentration in plasma at 30-60 min 
post-administration. Glucuronide conjugates of both non-methylated and 
methylated EC were found in high concentration in plasma. Moreover, 
administration of cocoa powder significantly reduced the accumulation of lipid 
peroxides in plasma and significantly reduced the consumption of 
alpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with 
2,2'-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH (25 mmol/l)) or CuSO(4) 
(100 micromol/l) compared with that in the case of plasma obtained before 
administration. The total EC concentration in plasma was negatively correlated 
with the level of accumulation of lipid peroxides in plasma oxidized by 
treatment with AAPH (25 mmol/l) and was positively correlated with the level of 
residual alpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with CuSO(4) (100 
micromol/l). These results indicate that EC in cocoa powder was absorbed from 
the digestive tract, that various conjugated forms of EC were generated in the 
digestive tract and distributed to the plasma, and that these enhanced the 
antioxidative activity of plasma.

(-)-Epicatechin is a major polyphenol component of cocoa powder. The absorption 
and urinary excretion of (-)-epicatechin following administration of different 
levels of either cocoa powder (150, 750, and 1500 mg/kg) or (-)-epicatechin (1, 
5, and 10 mg/kg) were evaluated in rats. Both the sum of plasma (-)-epicatechin 
metabolites at 1 h postadministration and peak plasma concentrations increased 
in a dose-dependent fashion. The sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in urine, 
excreted within 18 h postadministration, also increased with dose. Moreover, the 
sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites excreted in urine reached the same level in 
both (-)-epicatechin and cocoa powder administration groups for equivalent 
amounts of (-)-epicatechin. These results suggest that, in the dose range 
examined in this study, bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin following 
administration of either (-)-epicatechin or cocoa powder shows dose dependence 
and that the various compounds present in cocoa powder have little effect on the 
bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin in cocoa powder.

We compared levels of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and their metabolites in 
rat plasma and urine after oral administration. Rats were divided into four 
groups and given (+)-catechin (CA group), (-)-epicatechin (EC group), a mixture 
of the two (MIX group) or deionized water. Blood samples were collected before 
administration and at designated time intervals thereafter. Urine samples were 
collected 0-24 h postadministration. (+)-Catechin, (-)-epicatechin and their 
metabolites in plasma and urine were analyzed by HPLC-mass spectrometry after 
treatment with beta-glucuronidase and/or sulfatase. After administration, 
absorbed (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were mainly present in plasma as 
metabolites, such as nonmethylated or 3'-O-methylated conjugates. In the CA and 
MIX groups, the primary metabolite of (+)-catechin in plasma was glucuronide in 
the nonmethylated form. In the EC and MIX groups, in contrast, the primary 
metabolites of (-)-epicatechin in plasma were glucuronide and sulfoglucuronide 
in nonmethylated forms, and sulfate in the 3'-O-methylated forms. Urinary 
excretion of the total amount of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in the EC group was 
significantly higher than the amount of (+)-catechin metabolites in the CA 
group. The sum of (+)-catechin metabolites in the urine was significantly lower 
in the MIX group than in the CA group, and the sum of (-)-epicatechin 
metabolites in the MIX group was also significantly lower than in the EC group. 
These results suggest that the bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin is higher than 
that of (+)-catechin in rats, and that, in combination, (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin might be absorbed competitively in the gastrointestinal tract of 
rats.

metabolized conjugated and/or methylated (-)-epicatechin internally in the rat. 
Moreover, PB2 reduces the accumulation of lipid peroxide in plasma oxidized by

Rosmarinic acid (RA) is contained in various Lamiaceae herbs used commonly as 
culinary herbs. Although RA has various potent physiological actions, little is 
known on its bioavailability. We therefore investigated the absorption and 
metabolism of orally administered RA in rats. After being deprived of food for 
12 h, RA (50 mg/kg body weight) or deionized water was administered orally to 
rats. Blood samples were collected from a cannula inserted in the femoral artery 
before and at designated time intervals after administration of RA. Urine 
excreted within 0 to 8 h and 8 to 18 h post-administration was also collected. 
RA and its related metabolites in plasma and urine were measured by LC-MS after 
treatment with sulfatase and/or beta-glucuronidase. RA, mono-methylated RA 
(methyl-RA) and m-coumaric acid (COA) were detected in plasma, with peak 
concentrations being reached at 0.5, 1 and 8 h after RA administration, 
respectively. RA, methyl-RA, caffeic acid (CAA), ferulic acid (FA) and COA were 
detected in urine after RA administration. These components in plasma and urine 
were present predominantly as conjugated forms such as glucuronide or sulfate. 
The percentage of the original oral dose of RA excreted in the urine within 18 h 
of administration as free and conjugated forms was 0.44 +/- 0.21% for RA, 1.60 
+/- 0.74% for methyl-RA, 1.06 +/- 0.35% for CAA, 1.70 +/- 0.45% for FA and 0.67 
+/- 0.29% for COA. Approximately 83% of the total amount of these metabolites 
was excreted in the period 8 to 18 h after RA administration. These results 
suggest that RA was absorbed and metabolized as conjugated and/or methylated 
forms, and that the majority of RA absorbed was degraded into conjugated and/or 
methylated forms of CAA, FA and COA before being excreted gradually in the 
urine.

Erratum in
    Eur J Nutr. 2005 Feb;44(1):9.

BACKGROUND: Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural polyphenolic substance contained 
in many Lamiaceae herbs such as Perilla frutescens. Previous studies have shown 
RA has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activity. However, little is known on 
the absorption, metabolism, degradation and excretion of RA.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study in healthy humans was to determine the 
absorption, metabolism, and urinary excretion of RA after a single intake of 
perilla extract (PE).
METHOD: Six healthy men (mean age 37.2 +/- 6.2 y and mean body mass index 22.0 
+/- 1.9 kg/m(2)) were enrolled in the study that was a crossover design 
involving single intakes of PE containing 200 mg RA and placebo with a 10 day 
interval between treatments. Blood samples were collected before intake and at 
designated time intervals, while urine samples were collected over the periods 
0-6 h, 6-24 h and 24-48 h after intake. RA and its related metabolites in plasma 
and urine were measured by LC-MS.
RESULTS: RA, methylated RA (methyl-RA), caffeic acid (CAA), ferulic acid (FA) 
and a trace of m-coumaric acid (COA) were detected in the urine after intake of 
PE. In plasma, RA, methyl-RA and FA were detected, with maximum levels obtained 
0.5, 2 and 0.5 h after intake of PE, respectively. The majority of these 
components in both plasma and urine were present as conjugated forms 
(glucuronide and/or sulfated). The proportion of RA and its related metabolites 
excreted in the urine was 6.3 +/- 2.2% of the total dose, with approximately 75% 
of these components being excreted within 6 h after intake of PE.
CONCLUSIONS: RA contained in PE was absorbed, conjugated and methylated 
following intake, with a small proportion of RA being degraded into various 
components, such as conjugated forms of CAA, FA and COA. These metabolites were 
then rapidly excreted in the urine.

BACKGROUND: Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols such as catechins and 
procyanidins and has been shown in various models to inhibit LDL oxidation and 
atherogenesis.
OBJECTIVE: We examined whether long-term intake of cocoa powder alters plasma 
lipid profiles in normocholesterolemic and mildly hypercholesterolemic human 
subjects.
DESIGN: Twenty-five subjects were randomly assigned to ingest either 12 g 
sugar/d (control group) or 26 g cocoa powder and 12 g sugar/d (cocoa group) for 
12 wk. Blood samples were collected before the study and 12 wk after intake of 
the test drinks. Plasma lipids, LDL oxidative susceptibility, and urinary 
oxidative stress markers were measured.
RESULTS: At 12 wk, we measured a 9% prolongation from baseline levels in the lag 
time of LDL oxidation in the cocoa group. This prolongation in the cocoa group 
was significantly greater than the reduction measured in the control group 
(-13%). A significantly greater increase in plasma HDL cholesterol (24%) was 
observed in the cocoa group than in the control group (5%). A negative 
correlation was observed between plasma concentrations of HDL cholesterol and 
oxidized LDL. At 12 wk, there was a 24% reduction in dityrosine from baseline 
concentrations in the cocoa group. This reduction in the cocoa group was 
significantly greater than the reduction in the control group (-1%).
CONCLUSION: It is possible that increases in HDL-cholesterol concentrations may 
contribute to the suppression of LDL oxidation and that polyphenolic substances 
derived from cocoa powder may contribute to an elevation in HDL cholesterol.

Kakkalide is a major isoflavonoid from the flowers of Pueraria lobata (Willd.) 
Ohwi, possessing the protective effect against ethanol-induced intoxication and 
hepatic injury. The metabolism of kakkalide was investigated in rats. Thirteen 
metabolites were isolated by using solvent extraction and repeated 
chromatographic methods and identified by using spectroscopic methods including 
UV, IR, mass spectrometry, NMR, and circular dichroism experiments. Four new 
compounds were identified as irisolidone-7-O-glucuronide (M-1), 
tectorigenin-7-O-sulfate (M-2), tectorigenin-4'-O-sulfate (M-3), and biochanin 
A-6-O-sulfate (M-4) together with nine known compounds identified as irisolidone

(M-10), genistein (M-11), daidzein (M-12), and equol (M-13). The metabolic 
pathway of kakkalide was proposed, which is important to understand its 
metabolic fate and disposition in humans.

Phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of extra-virgin olive oils 
extracted from several Italian varieties were studied at production and during 
storage. The antioxidant activity was measured according to the following tests: 
in the aqueous phase, by radical scavenging of the 
2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical cation; and 
in the lipid phase, using the beta-carotene bleaching method. The phenolic 
content was not correlated to the oxidation indices (peroxide value and 
spectrophotometric constants). The phenolic contents and profiles of the various 
cultivars showed remarkable differences. The phenolic content was strongly 
correlated with the antioxidant activity measured according to the beta-carotene 
test and weakly correlated with the radical scavenging ability.

In the present paper, the following extraction techniques have been used for 
extracting isoflavonoids from the species Matricaria recutita, Rosmarinus 
officinalis, Foeniculum vulgare, and Agrimonia eupatoria L.: supercritical fluid 
extraction (SFE), pressurized fluid extraction, matrix solid phase dispersion, 
ultrasonic extraction in an ultrasonic bath (USE) and by means of an ultrasonic 
homogeniser (HOM), extraction by means of Soxhlet apparatus (SOX), and solid 
phase extraction. Experimental optimization of all techniques has been carried 
out using a soybean flour. Subsequent analyses of the extracts were carried out 
by liquid chromatography with UV detection. The maximum yields of daidzein and 
genistein were obtained by extraction with the SOX, USE, and HOM techniques. The 
maximum yields of apigenin and biochanin A from herb samples were obtained by 
SFE.

Some leafy vegetables were studied for their nutritional composition, 
antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities. The aerial parts of 
Coriandrum sativum, Spinacia oleracea, Trigonella corniculata and Trigonella 
foenum-graecum showed lower inhibitory concentration values (4.1-7.9 mg/ml), 
efficiency concentration values (178-321 mg/mg DPPH) and higher values of 
anti-radical power (0.31-0.51) as compared with their seeds. Thermal treatment 
reduced the total phenolic contents, antioxidant and free radical scavenging 
activities. The leaves of C. sativum were found with good amounts of caffeic 
acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid and chlorogenic acid.

Four trichothecene-producing strains of Fusarium graminearum were grown on three 
maize grain fractions, whole grain, degermed grain, and the germ, to determine 
the effect of natural substrates on mycotoxin production. Monitoring the 
ergosterol content after 25 days of incubation indicated that fungal growth on 
all grain fractions was comparable. Trichothecene (TCT) production was highest 
on degermed grain, less on whole grain, and very low or nondetectable on the 
germ; similar results were found with four different strains. It was concluded 
that inhibitor(s) of TCT biosynthesis were present in maize germ. The presence 
of phenolic compounds was investigated in the different fractions. The 
hydroxamate 4-acetylbenzoxazolin-2-one (4-ABOA), a known inhibitor of mycotoxin 
production, was found in the degermed and whole grain fractions but not in the 
germ. Therefore, the TCT inhibition observed on the maize germ fraction used in 
our study is clearly not linked to 4-ABOA. Other soluble phenolic compounds were 
found at a much higher concentration in the germ than in the two other 
fractions. The inhibition property of the soluble ester-bound extracts was 
tested in liquid culture. A possible role for these compounds is discussed.

Dietary non-tocopherol antioxidants present in extra virgin olive oil increase 
the resistance of low density lipoproteins to oxidation in rabbits.

Consumption of a range of dietary antioxidants may be beneficial in protecting 
low density lipoprotein (LDL) against oxidative modification, as studies have 
demonstrated that antioxidants other than vitamin E may also function against 
oxidation of LDL in vitro. In the present study, the effect of polyphenol 
antioxidants on the susceptibility of LDL to copper-mediated oxidation was 
investigated after feeding semi-purified diets to 3 groups of New Zealand white 
(NZW) rabbits. All diets comprised 40% energy as fat with 17% energy as oleic 
acid. Dietary fatty acid compositions were identical. Oils with different 
polyphenol contents were used to provide the dietary source of oleic 
acid-refined olive oil, extra virgin olive oil and Trisun high oleic sunflower 
seed oil. Polyphenolic compounds (hydroxytyrosol and p-tyrosol) could only be 
detected in the extra virgin olive oil. Vitamin E was equalised in all diets. 
LDL oxidizability in vitro was determined by continuously monitoring the 
copper-induced formation of conjugated dienes after 6 weeks of experimental diet 
feeding. The lag phase before demonstrable oxidation occurred was significantly 
increased in the high polyphenol, extra virgin olive oil group (P < 0.05) when 
compared with combined results from the low polyphenol group (refined olive oil 
and Trisun), even though the LDL vitamin E concentration in the high polyphenol 
group was significantly lower. The rate of conjugated diene formation was not 
influenced by the presence of dietary polyphenols. Results demonstrate that 
antioxidants, possibly phenolic compounds which are present only in extra virgin 
olive oil, may contribute to the endogenous antioxidant capacity of LDL, 
resulting in an increased resistance to oxidation as determined in vitro.

In order to selectively remove caffeine from green tea, a microwave-enhanced 
vacuum ice water extraction (MVIE) method was proposed. The effects of MVIE 
variables including extraction time, microwave power, and solvent to solid radio 
on the removal yield of caffeine and the loss of total phenolics (TP) from green 
tea were investigated. The optimized conditions were as follows: solvent (mL) to 
solid (g) ratio was 10:1, microwave extraction time was 6 min, microwave power 
was 350 W and 2.5 h of vacuum ice water extraction. The removal yield of 
caffeine by MVIE was 87.6%, which was significantly higher than that by hot 
water extraction, indicating a significant improvement of removal efficiency. 
Moreover, the loss of TP of green tea in the proposed method was much lower than 
that in the hot water extraction. After decaffeination by MVIE, the removal 
yield of TP tea was 36.2%, and the content of TP in green tea was still higher 
than 170 mg g(-1). Therefore, the proposed microwave-enhanced vacuum ice water 
extraction was selective, more efficient for the removal of caffeine. The main 
phenolic compounds of green tea were also determined, and the results indicated 
that the contents of several catechins were almost not changed in MVIE. This 
study suggests that MVIE is a new and good alternative for the removal of 
caffeine from green tea, with a great potential for industrial application.

Total alcoholic extract of Desmodium gangeticum, which exhibited significant 
anti-inflammatory activity, was evaluated for the possible mode of action by 
studying its antioxidant potential in adjuvant-induced arthritic rats. Activity 
guided fractionation and isolation were carried out. The phenolics fraction 
showed maximum potency. Solid phase extraction followed by preparative HPLC of 
the active phenolic fraction yielded for the first time two potent antioxidant 
compounds, caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid, from this plant. The biological 
antioxidant defense system, involving superoxide dismutase, glutathione and 
catalase, showed a significant increase with their levels close to the normal 
control with a decrease in the lipid peroxide content upon administration of D. 
gangeticum extract (100 mg kg(-1)) and its phenolics (50 mg kg(-1)) in arthritic 
rats, thereby indicating the extracts antioxidant property under arthritic 
conditions.

Daidzein is an estrogenic isoflavone present in many plants and therefore 
consumed in relatively high doses by humans. Daidzein has a low affinity for the 
estrogen receptor (3 orders of magnitude lower than estradiol) and has been 
demonstrated to have estrogenic effects in rodents after administration of high 
doses. We have studied the disposition and biotransformation of daidzein in rats 
fed a diet low in isoflavone content. Four male and four female Fischer 344 rats 
were orally administered 100 mg/kg daidzein; excreted urine and feces were 
collected for 96 h and unchanged daidzein as well as formed metabolites were 
quantified by HPLC. In urine of male rats, daidzein, daidzein-glucuronide, and 
daidzein-sulfate were excreted; in females, only unchanged daidzein and 
daidzein-glucuronide were present. Total urinary excretion of daidzein accounted 
for < 10% of dose in both males and females. The major pathway of daidzein 
elimination was excretion of unchanged daidzein with feces. Reductive 
daidzein-metabolites likely formed by intestinal microflora (equol, 
O-desmethylangolensin) were excreted with feces in small amounts (< 5% of dose). 
Excretion of daidzein and metabolites with urine and feces was rapid with 
elimination half-lives of less than 12 h; daidzein concentrations in urine and 
feces were below the limit of detection 36 h after daidzein administration. The 
results suggest that daidzein is only poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal 
tract in rodents. Absorbed daidzein is rapidly eliminated both unchanged and as 
conjugates with urine. The inefficient absorption of daidzein from the 
gastrointestinal tract and the rapid excretion may explain the weak 
estrogenicity of daidzein seen in vivo in rodents when compared to other 
estrogenic chemicals with comparatively low affinity to the estrogen receptor.

A novel gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) method was 
developed, using an ion trap mass spectrometer, for the simultaneous 
determination of olive oil bioactive components, elenolic acid, hydroxytyrosol, 
and tyrosol, in rat urine. Samples were analyzed by GC-MS/MS prior to and after 
enzymatic treatment. A solid phase extraction sample pretreatment step with 
greater than 80% analytical recoveries for all compounds was performed followed 
by a derivatization reaction prior to GC-MS/MS analysis. The calibration curves 
were linear for all compounds studied for a dynamic range between 1 and 500 ng. 
The limit of detection was in the mid picogram level for tyrosol and elenolic 
acid (300 pg) and in the low picogram level for hydroxytyrosol (2.5 pg). The 
method was applied to the analysis of rat urine samples after sustained oral 
intake of oleuropein or extra virgin olive oil as a diet supplement.

A microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) method has been applied for the first time 
to the extraction of the main lignan, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), 
and the two most concentrated hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in flaxseed. The 
effects of microwave power, extraction time and alkaline treatment were 
investigated. It was shown that a 3 min MAE resulted in an SDG content of 
16.1+/-0.4 mg/g, a p-coumaric acid glucoside content of 3.7+/-0.2 mg/g and a 
ferulic acid glucoside content of 4.1+/-0.2 mg/g. These values were compared 
with those obtained using conventional extraction methods and the results 
demonstrated that MAE was more effective in terms of both yield and time 
consumption.

The variation in flavonoid concentration and composition was investigated in 
baby spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) cv. Emilia sown on three occasions, each 
harvested at three growth stages at 6-day intervals. After harvest, leaves were 
stored in polypropylene bags at 2 or 10 degrees C. Flavonoids were analyzed by 
reversed phase HPLC. Twelve flavonoid peaks were detected. The main flavonoid, 
making up on average 43% of the total flavonoid concentration, was identified as 
5,3',4'-trihydroxy-3-methoxy-6:7-methylenedioxyflavone-4'-glucuronide. Four 
other flavonoids each contributed 7-12% of the total flavonoid content. Total 
flavonoid content was relatively stable during normal retail storage conditions, 
although some of the individual flavonoid compounds showed considerable 
variation. The youngest plants had the highest flavonoid concentration, 
indicating that by harvesting the baby spinach a few days earlier than the 
current commercial stage of harvest, the flavonoid concentration in the product 
may be increased and the content of potentially health-promoting compounds 
enhanced.

Technomimetic NMR experiments were performed in accordance with the lye 
treatment adopted during table olive industrial procedures for the debittering 
process causing oleuropein degradation. The site selective hydrolysis of the two 
ester groups, characterizing the biophenolic secoiridoid molecule, was shown to 
be dependent on the different reactivities of these functionalities. The process 
is controlled by the experimental conditions exerted on the olive pulp and 
determined by the buffering capacity of the olive mesocarp and by the epicarp 
molecular components influencing the reactant penetration into the fruit pulp. 
The overall hydrolytic process of oleuropein, the bitter principle of olives, 
using the technomimetic experimental mode, gave rise to its catabolic 
derivatives, hydroxytyrosol, 11-methyloleoside, and the monoterpene glucoside, 
technomimetically produced, isolated, and structurally characterized by (1)H, 
(13)C, and COSY spectroscopy as the oleoside.

Qualitative and quantitative differences among the constituents in various 
fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill., family Apiaceae) teas prepared by classical 
infusion, microwave decoction, and dissolution are reported. Different 
commercial starting materials, such as fruit (unbroken and crushed), four herbal 
teas, and two instant herbal teas were evaluated. Chlorogenic acid (1), 
quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide (2), p-anisaldehyde (3), and trans-anethole (4) 
were identified by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS as constituents of fennel teas. No 
coumarins, which are characteristic constituents of plants of Apiaceae family, 
were found. Trans-anethole (4), the main constituent of the essential oil, was 
present in all teas. In addition p-anisaldehyde (3), a degradation product of 
trans-anethole, was also identified in all teas with the exception of two 
samples. Chlorogenic acid (1) and quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide (2) were also 
present in all teas. In addition, minor unidentified flavonol constituents were 
found in two teas. Quality, activity, and safety of the content of the 
investigated preparations are also discussed.

Unprocessed olives are well-known sources of phenolic antioxidants with 
important biological properties. Processing methods to prepare table olives may 
cause a reduction of valuable phenols and may deprive the food of precious 
biological functions. The present work was undertaken to evaluate table olives 
produced in Greece as sources of biophenols. Commercially available olives were 
analyzed for their total phenol content by using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and 
for individual phenols by RP-HPLC. Samples were Spanish-style green olives in 
brine, Greek-style naturally black olives in brine, and Kalamata olives in 
brine. Most of the types of olives analyzed were found to be good sources of 
phenols. Hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and luteolin were the prevailing phenols in 
almost all of the samples examined. High levels of hydroxytyrosol were 
determined mainly in Kalamata olives and Spanish-style green olives, cultivar 
Chalkidiki (250-760 mg/kg).

There is high current interest in the chemopreventive potential of Brassica 
vegetables (cruciferae), particularly due to their content in glucosinolates 
(GL), which upon myrosinase hydrolysis release the corresponding isythiocyanates 
(ITC). Some ITCs, such as sulforaphane (SFN) from broccoli ( Brassica oleacea 
italica), have been found to possess anticancer activity through induction of 
apoptosis in selected cell lines, as well as indirect antioxidant activity 
through induction of phase II detoxifying enzymes. Japanese daikon ( Raphanus 
sativus L.) is possibly the vegetable with the highest per capita consumption 
within the Brassicaceae family. Thanks to a recently improved gram scale 
production process, it was possible to prepare sufficient amounts of the GL 
glucoraphasatin (GRH) as well as the corresponding ITC 4-methylthio-3-butenyl 
isothiocyanate (GRH-ITC) from its sprouts. This paper reports a study on the 
cytotoxic and apoptotic activities of GRH-ITC compared with the oxidized 
counterpart 4-methylsulfinyl-3-butenyl isothiocyanate (GRE-ITC) on three human 
colon carcinoma cell lines (LoVo, HCT-116, and HT-29) together with a detailed 
kinetic investigation of the direct antioxidant/radical scavenging ability of 
GRH and GRH-ITC. Both GRH-ITC and GRE-ITC reduced cell proliferation in a 
dose-dependent manner and induced apoptosis in the three cancer cell lines. The 
compounds significantly ( p < 0.05) increased Bax and decreased Bcl2 protein 
expression, as well as producing caspase-9 and PARP-1 cleavage after 3 days of 
exposure in the three cancer cell lines. GRH-ITC treatment was shown to have no 
toxicity with regard to normal human lymphocytes (-15 +/- 5%) in comparison with 
SFN (complete growth inhibition). GRH and GRH-ITC were able to quench the 
2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical, with second-order rate constants of 14.0 
+/- 2.8 and 43.1 +/- 9.5 M(-1) s(-1), respectively (at 298 K in methanol), 
whereas the corresponding value measured here for the reference antioxidant 
alpha-tocopherol was 425 +/- 40 M (-1) s (-1). GRH reacted with H2O2 and 
tert-butyl hydroperoxide in water (pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C, with rate constants 
of 1.9 +/- 0.3 x 10(-2) and 9.5 +/- 0.3 x 10(-4) M(-1) s (-1) (paralleling 
recently developed synthetic antioxidants) being quantitatively (>97%) converted 
to GRE. It is demonstrated that GRH-ITC has interesting antioxidant/radical 
scavenging properties, associated with a selective cytotoxic/apoptotic activity 
toward three human colon carcinoma cell lines, and very limited toxicity on 
normal human T-lymphocytes.

Health-promoting properties such as antioxidative, anticarcinogenic, and 
cholesterol-lowering effects are described for mangiferin and hesperidin, the 
major phenolic compounds present in Cyclopia genistoides (honeybush). However, 
knowledge of their metabolic fate and their absorption from the gastrointestinal 
tract is very limited. The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations 
of mangiferin, hesperidin, and their metabolites in plasma, urine, and feces 
samples from pigs consuming an extract of Cyclopia genistoides. Pigs were 
administered up to 74 mg mangiferin per kilogram of body weight and 1 mg 
hesperidin per kilogram of body weight per day for 11 days. Plasma samples were 
collected at various time points on days 9 and 11 of the study and days 1 and 2 
after termination of extract administration. Urine and feces were collected in 
fractions for 24 hours. In the plasma samples, the aglycone of mangiferin 
(norathyriol) was detected. Mean plasma concentrations ranged from 7.8 to 11.8 
mumol/L. Six metabolites of mangiferin and hesperidin were detected in the 
urine, including methyl mangiferin, norathyriol, its monoglucuronide, 
hesperetin, hesperetin monoglucuronide, and eriodictyol monoglucuronide. Between 
26.0% and 30.8% of the administered dose of hesperidin and only between 1.4% and 
1.6% of mangiferin could be detected in the urine on days 9 and 11 of the study. 
Approximately 8.2% of the administered dose of mangiferin was determined in the 
feces. The main metabolite was norathyriol. Neither hesperidin nor metabolites 
ascribed to hesperidin intake were detected. The results suggest that formation 
of norathyriol from mangiferin occurs in vivo, and specific metabolites were 
identified in blood and excretion products in urine and feces. This study will 
aid in investigating the physiological functions of the parent compounds in 
vivo.

BACKGROUND: Despite decades of research on the relation between soy and breast 
cancer, questions regarding the absorption, metabolism, and distribution of 
isoflavones in breast tissue largely remain unanswered.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the potential health effects of isoflavone consumption 
on normal breast tissue; isoflavone concentrations, metabolites, and 
biodistribution were investigated and compared with 17beta-estradiol exposure.
DESIGN: In this dietary intervention study, healthy women were randomly 
allocated to a soy milk (n = 11; 16.98-mg genistein and 5.40-mg daidzein 
aglycone equivalents per dose), soy supplement (n = 10; 5.27-mg genistein and 
17.56-mg daidzein aglycone equivalents per dose), or control (n = 10) group. 
After a run-in period > or = 4 d, 3 doses of soy milk or soy supplements were 
taken daily for 5 d before an esthetic breast reduction. Blood and breast 
biopsies were collected during surgery and analyzed with liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: After soy administration, genistein and total daidzein concentrations, 
which were expressed as aglycone equivalents, ranged from 135.1 to 2831 nmol/L 
and 105.1 to 1397 nmol/L, respectively, in hydrolyzed serum and from 92.33 to 
493.8 pmol/g and 22.15 to 770.8 pmol/g, respectively, in hydrolyzed breast 
tissue. The major metabolites identified in nonhydrolyzed samples were 
genistein-7-O-glucuronide and daidzein-7-O-glucuronide, with an overall 
glucuronidation of 98%. Total isoflavones showed a breast adipose/glandular 
tissue distribution of 40:60, and their mean (+/-SEM) derived 17beta-estradiol 
equivalents toward estrogen receptor beta were 21 +/- 4-fold and 40 +/- 10-fold 
higher than the 17beta-estradiol concentrations in adipose (0.283 +/- 0.089 
pmol/g, P < 0.001) and glandular (0.246 +/- 0.091 pmol/g, P = 0.001) fractions, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: After intake of soy milk and soy supplements, isoflavones reach 
exposure levels in breast tissue at which potential health effects may occur.

Olive oil is the main source of fat in the Mediterranean diet, and its 
consumption has been related to a low incidence of coronary heart disease and 
certain cancers. Recent findings demonstrate that olive oil phenolics are 
powerful in vitro and in vivo antioxidants and display other biological 
activities that could partially account for the observed healthful effects of 
the Mediterranean diet. A detailed method optimization plan was carried out to 
separate the most popular phenols in olive oil for four separation parameters: 
buffer concentration, buffer pH, applied voltage and temperature. Consequently, 
an analytical method capable of separating 21 different phenols and polyphenols 
by capillary zone electrophoresis was developed; the separation was performed 
within 10 min, using a 40 cm x 50 microm capillary, with a 45 mM sodium 
tetraborate buffer (pH 9.60), at 27 kV and 30 degrees C. The optimized method 
was applied to methanolic extracts of several Italian extra-virgin olive oils 
obtained by different technologies in order to characterize and to compare their 
antioxidant profile. Positive correlations of phenolic compounds found by 
capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and two colorimetric indexes (total 
polyphenols and o-diphenols) were found and discussed.

Phenolic compounds are found in both free and bound forms in cereals. The 
majority is in the insoluble bound form, that is, bound to cell wall material, 
such as ferulic acid and its derivatives. The antioxidant properties of the 
phenolic compounds in grains are associated with the health benefits of grains 
and grain products. The extraction capacity of several solvent mixtures, for 
extracting free phenols from barley flours, and the possibility of employing a 
rapid automated solvent extraction method were studied. The extraction yield of 
each method was evaluated by correlating several spectrophotometric indices 
(absorption at 280, 320, and 370 nm and total phenolic compounds by the 
Folin-Ciocalteu method) with the antioxidant activities of the barley extracts 
(scavenging activity by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl method). Interesting 
results were obtained when ethanol and acetone-based extraction mixtures were 
employed to extract free phenols. A comparison was made between alkaline and 
acid hydrolysis. The extraction yield of bound phenolic compounds increased when 
the digestion time for alkaline hydrolysis was prolonged.

Capillary electrophoresis (CE) can be effectively used as a fast screening tool 
to obtain qualitative and semiquantitative information about simple and complex 
phenolic compounds of extra virgin olive oil. Three simple phenols (tyrosol, 
hydroxytyrosol, and vanillic acid), a secoiridoid derivative (deacetoxy 
oleuropein aglycon), and two lignans (pinoresinol and acetoxypinoresinol) were 
detected as the main compounds in extra virgin olive oils by high-performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). 
Spectrophotometric indices, radical scavenging activity, and oxidative stability 
of extra virgin olive oil samples obtained from olives hand-picked at different 
ripening degrees were statistically correlated with the CZE and HPLC 
quantification. The concentration of phenols in extra virgin olive oil decreased 
with ripeness of olive fruits. The high correlations found between CZE and the 
other analytical results indicate that CE can be applied as a rapid and reliable 
tool to routinely determine phenolic compounds in extra virgin olive oils.

The red grape constituent resveratrol possesses cancer chemopreventive 
properties in rodents. The hypothesis was tested that, in healthy humans, p.o. 
administration of resveratrol is safe and results in measurable plasma levels of 
resveratrol. A phase I study of oral resveratrol (single doses of 0.5, 1, 2.5, 
or 5 g) was conducted in 10 healthy volunteers per dose level. Resveratrol and 
its metabolites were identified in plasma and urine by high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and quantitated by high-performance 
liquid chromatography-UV. Consumption of resveratrol did not cause serious 
adverse events. Resveratrol and six metabolites were recovered from plasma and 
urine. Peak plasma levels of resveratrol at the highest dose were 539 +/- 384 
ng/mL (2.4 micromol/L, mean +/- SD; n = 10), which occurred 1.5 h post-dose. 
Peak levels of two monoglucuronides and resveratrol-3-sulfate were 3- to 8-fold 
higher. The area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) values for 
resveratrol-3-sulfate and resveratrol monoglucuronides were up to 23 times 
greater than those of resveratrol. Urinary excretion of resveratrol and its 
metabolites was rapid, with 77% of all urinary agent-derived species excreted 
within 4 h after the lowest dose. Cancer chemopreventive effects of resveratrol 
in cells in vitro require levels of at least 5 micromol/L. The results presented 
here intimate that consumption of high-dose resveratrol might be insufficient to 
elicit systemic levels commensurate with cancer chemopreventive efficacy. 
However, the high systemic levels of resveratrol conjugate metabolites suggest 
that their cancer chemopreventive properties warrant investigation.

The fate of anthocyanins and ellagitannins in rats was monitored following 
ingestion of raspberry juice. After 1 h low nM concentrations of unmetabolised 
anthocyanins were present in plasma but these declined by 2 h and after 4 h they 
were no longer detectable. For the first 2 h there was an almost full recovery 
of anthocyanins as they passed from the stomach through the duodenum/jejunum and 
into the ileum. After 3 h less than 50% were recovered, and the levels declined 
rapidly thereafter. Excretion of raspberry anthocyanins in urine over a 24 h 
period was equivalent to 1.2% of the amount ingested. Trace quantities of 
anthocyanins were detected in the caecum, colon and faeces and they were absent 
in extracts of liver, kidneys and brain. Urine also contained a number of 
phenolic acids but most were present in quantities well in excess of the 918 
nmol of anthocyanins present in the ingested juice. These findings indicate that 
raspberry anthocyanins per se are poorly absorbed, probably prior to reaching 
the ileum, and that substantial amounts pass from the small to the large 
intestine where they are degraded by colonic bacteria. Ellagitannins disappeared 
in the stomach without accumulation of ellagic acid.

A healthy diet involves eating fruit and vegetables on a daily basis, the 
benefits of which are in part linked to the ingestion of bioactive compounds 
including polyphenols. As a convenient means of delivering additional 
polyphenols to the diet, a polyphenol-rich (P-R) juice drink was prepared and 
the bioavailability of its diverse spectrum of constituents investigated. Ten 
human volunteers followed a low-flavonoid diet for 2 days before drinking 350 mL 
of the P-R beverage. Plasma and urine were collected for 24 h and analyzed by 
HPLC-PDA-MS. The plasma pharmacokinetics and recoveries of urinary metabolites 
of flavan-3-ols, flavanones, dihydrochalcones and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, both 
in terms of their identity and quantity, were, in most instances, not markedly 
different to those reported in other feeding studies with green tea, orange 
juice, apple cider and coffee. This indicates that the combination of 
polyphenolic compounds in the P-R beverage are absorbed and excreted to a 
similar extent whether fed individually or together in a single beverage. It is 
concluded that the P-R beverage can deliver the intended blend of bioavailable 
polyphenols, which would normally require consumption of several different 
plant-derived foods.

Eight avenanthramides, amides of anthranilic acid (1) and 5-hydroxyanthranilic 
acid (2), respectively, and the four cinnamic acids p-coumaric (p), caffeic (c), 
ferulic (f), and sinapic (s) acid, were synthesized for identification in oat 
extracts and for structure-antioxidant activity studies. Three compounds (2p, 
2c, and 2f) were found in oat extracts. As assessed by the reactivity toward 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), all avenanthramides except 1p showed 
activity. Initially, the antioxidant activity of the avenanthramides decreased 
in a similar order as for the corresponding cinnamic acids, that is: sinapic > 
caffeic > ferulic > p-coumaric acid. The avenanthramides derived from 2 were 
usually slightly more active than those derived from 1. All avenanthramides 
inhibited azo-initiated peroxidation of linoleic acid. 1c and 1s were initially 
the most effective compounds. The relative order of antioxidant activities was 
slightly different for the DPPH and the linoleic acid assays run in methanol and 
chlorobenzene, respectively.

We have determined the absorption, conjugation and excretion of 
naringenin-7-O-rutinoside (narirutin) compared to the corresponding glucoside in 
an orange juice matrix in human subjects. Healthy volunteers (eight men and 
eight women), in a double blind, randomised, crossover study, consumed orange 
juice with (1) natural content of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside; (2) 
alpha-rhamnosidase-treated to yield naringenin-7-O-glucoside. Blood was sampled 
at twelve time points and three fractions of urine were collected over 24 h. The 
area under the plasma-time curve of naringenin from (2) 
alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice was increased about 4-fold (P < 0.0001), 
peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 5.4-fold higher (P < 0.0001) and Tmax was 
decreased from 311 to 92 min (P = 0.002) compared to untreated orange juice (1), 
indicating a change in absorption site from the colon to the small intestine. 
Furthermore, the amount in urine was increased from 7 to 47 % (P < 0.0001) of 
the dose after consumption of the alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice (2). 
All urine samples contained both naringenin-7- and -4'-O-glucuronides. In 
addition, to examine the effect of dose and alpha-rhamnosidase treatment on 
hesperetin conjugate profiles, a further treatment where (3) orange juice 
fortified with three times the original content of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside was 
used. Five hesperetin metabolites (3'-O-glucuronide; 7-O-glucuronide; 
5,7-O-diglucuronide; 3',7-O-diglucuronide; 3'-O-sulphate) were present after all 
treatments (1-3), with the same profile of the conjugates. The present data show 
that bioavailability of naringenin is increased by conversion from rutinoside to 
glucoside, but the profile of the conjugates of flavanones formed and excreted 
in urine is neither affected by the absorption site nor by a 3-fold change in 
dose.

Extraction methods to determine olive oil phenols are not exhaustive. A 
procedure to test their effectiveness, based on the treatment of the extracted 
oil with 2 N HCl followed by analysis of phenols in the aqueous phase, has been 
developed. It was concluded, using this test, that 15-40% of phenols remained 
unextracted when the liquid/liquid extraction method with 80% methanol was 
applied. Solid phase extraction (C(18) cartridge) succeeded in retaining most of 
the phenols in the cartridge, but the recovery yield from the sorbent material 
was low. However, a new extraction method, based on the use of 
N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as an extraction solvent, achieved a complete 
extraction of phenols from oils. The proposed method requires a lower amount of 
oil, solvents, energy, and labor than the traditional ones. Because of the low 
concentration of phenols in the DMF extract, the highly sensitive 
electrochemical detector (EC) technique was studied. All of the phenols detected 
by the traditional UV detectors were also detected by EC using a coulometric 
array system. A rapid and complete analytical methodology of phenols in olive 
oil has been proposed based on coupling DMF extraction and EC detection.

Oranges are rich sources of flavonoids that are bioactive and may protect 
against age-related diseases. The absorption of orange flavanones may be 
affected by factors such as processing and subject anthropometric variables, and 
the bioactivity of the absorbed phytochemicals depends on how they are 
metabolised during absorption. In a randomised cross-over study, twenty subjects 
consumed a single portion of orange fruit (150 g) or juice (300 g) that 
contained the flavanones narirutin and hesperidin, and an additional 109 
subjects across a broad age range (18-80 years) consumed the juice. Flavanone 
metabolites were measured in regularly collected samples of plasma and urine. 
After consumption of fruit or juice, flavanone conjugates, but not the 
aglycones, were detected in plasma and urine. The flavanone conjugates were 
shown to include the 7- and 4'-O-monoglucuronides of naringenin, the 7- and 
3'-O-monoglucuronides of hesperetin, two hesperetin diglucuronides and a 
hesperetin sulfo-glucuronide, but no aglycones or rutinosides. Analysis of the 
plasma pharmacokinetic and urinary excretion data on a dose-adjusted basis 
indicated no difference in absorption or excretion of either flavanone between 
the fruit and juice matrices. In the extended urinary excretion dataset the 
individual variation was very large (range 0-59 % urinary yield). There was a 
small but significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the excretion of hesperetin (but 
not naringenin) with increasing age (P < 0.05), but the effects of sex, BMI and 
contraceptive pill use were shown not to be associated with the variation in 
flavanone excretion.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data showed that tomato and tomato product (sauce, 
paste) consumption is associated with a protective effect against the 
development of some chronic-degenerative diseases. Tomato antioxidant bioactive 
molecules such as carotenoids and polyphenols could be responsible, at least in 
part, for the healthy effect observed. The bioavailability of these compounds is 
an essential requirement to sustain their in vivo role. While it is well known 
that many factors can influence the bioaccessibility of carotenoids from the 
food matrix, there is little information about the factors affecting phenolic 
compounds' bioaccessibility.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This investigation was carried out to evaluate the effect of 
domestic cooking on the bioavailability in humans of antioxidant molecules after 
the administration of a test meal containing cherry tomatoes.
METHODS: A cross-over design was conducted. Subjects (3 females and 2 males) 
consumed experimental meals containing fresh and cooked cherry tomatoes. Blood 
collection was performed at different time intervals (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h).
RESULTS: Carotenoid and phenol plasma concentrations were measured. Plasma 
levels of lycopene and beta-carotene were not significantly different with 
respect to the baseline after ingestion of both the test meals, while plasma 
concentrations of naringenin and chlorogenic acid increased significantly with 
respect to the baseline (P<0.05) after administration of cooked cherry tomatoes, 
but not after administration of fresh cherry tomatoes.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated that domestically cooked tomatoes 
significantly increase naringenin and chlorogenic acid plasma levels. 
Considering that both naringenin and chlorogenic acid are widely studied for 
their potential healthy properties, evidence of their bioavailability and of the 
factors influencing their bioaccessibility is an important tool to sustain the 
possibility that these polyphenols play a biological role in human physiology.

The carotenoid and phenolic acid contents in fresh, stored and processed 
(blanched, frozen and boiled) spinach were comparatively determined by 
spectrophotometric and HPLC analyses. The major carotenoids identified after 
HPLC analysis in saponified samples were lutein (37-53μg/kg), β-carotene 
(18-31μg/kg), violaxanthin (9-23μg/kg) and neoxanthin (10-22μg/kg). These 
carotenoids were all affected by storage and/or heating. The content of 
carotenoids was best preserved after storage for one day at 4°C. The total 
phenolic content in the fresh spinach was 2088mg GAE/kg FW. After LC-MS analysis 
three phenolic acids were identified and quantified. These being ortho-coumaric 
acid (28-60mg/kg FW), ferulic acid (10-35mg/kg) and para-coumaric acid 
(1-30mg/kg) depending on the sample type. After storage of spinach at different 
temperatures (4°C or -18°C) the amount of total phenolic compounds decreased by 
around 20%, while the amount of individual phenolic acids increased by four 
times on average.

The polyphenol trans-resveratrol (t-RES) is present as 
t-RES-3-O-beta-D-glycoside, termed piceid, in several plant-derived foods. 
Although data on the metabolism and on in vivo effects of t-RES have been 
reported, quantitative data on the metabolites formed after dietary intake of 
t-RES or piceid are still lacking. In this study, 85.5 mg of piceid per 70 kg of 
body weight (bw) were administered to healthy volunteers in a bolus dose. t-RES 
metabolites formed in plasma and urine were identified and quantified by 
LC-MS/MS, NMR, and HPLC-DAD analysis using chemically synthesized t-RES 
conjugate standards. In addition, the amount of t-RES metabolites bound 
noncovalently to plasma proteins was determined for the first time in humans. 
The metabolites identified and quantified were t-RES-3-sulfate, 
t-RES-3,4'-disulfate, t-RES-3,5-disulfate, t-RES-3-glucuronide and 
t-RES-4'-glucuronide, with t-RES-sulfates being the dominant conjugates in 
plasma and urine. Besides these metabolites, two novel t-RES-C/O-conjugated 
diglucuronides have been identified and quantified in plasma and urine. 
Moreover, it could be shown that up to 50% of the plasma t-RES-3-sulfate, 
t-RES-disulfates, and the novel t-RES-C/O-diglucuronides were bound to proteins. 
Total recovery of the dietary administered piceid in urine ranged between 13.6 
and 35.7%.

BACKGROUND: Reduced lipoprotein oxidizability by red wine phenols has been 
proposed as the basis for a relatively lower incidence of coronary heart disease 
in red wine drinkers. We showed previously that caffeic and protocatechuic acids 
isolated from red wine exhibit antioxidant activity in vitro. However, there is 
no information in the literature on the absorption of these compounds after red 
wine ingestion.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether certain phenolic acids can be 
detected in the circulation after red wine consumption and if their presence has 
an acute effect on serum and LDL oxidation ex vivo.
DESIGN: Twelve healthy male nonsmokers consumed red wine, phenol-stripped red 
wine, dealcoholized red wine, or water, each at a separate visit, in random 
order and 1 wk apart. Beverages were consumed over 30 min and blood was sampled 
just before beverage consumption and 1, 2, and 4 h after consumption. Plasma 
caffeic, protocatechuic, and 4-O-methylgallic acids were measured by gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry. We also measured copper-induced serum and LDL 
oxidizability ex vivo and serum uric acid.
RESULTS: Caffeic acid and 4-O-methylgallic acid concentrations increased 
significantly (P < 0.025) after consumption of red wine and dealcoholized red 
wine compared with water or phenol-stripped red wine. Uric acid increased 
significantly (P < 0.001) after ingestion of red wine, phenol-stripped red wine, 
and dealcoholized red wine. There was no effect on ex vivo serum or LDL 
oxidation after any of the beverages.
CONCLUSION: Although red wine and dealcoholized red wine consumption acutely 
increase plasma phenolic acid and serum uric acid concentrations, the increase 
is insufficient to influence ex vivo lipoprotein oxidation.

PURPOSE: The flavones apigenin and tricin, which occur in leafy vegetables and 
rice bran, respectively, possess cancer chemopreventive properties in 
preclinical rodent models. Their pharmacology is only poorly understood. We 
compared their tissue levels in mice in vivo and their metabolism in liver 
fractions in vitro.
METHODS: Mice received apigenin or tricin (0.2%) with their diet for 5-7 days, 
and flavone levels were compared in the plasma, liver and gastrointestinal 
mucosa using HPLC-UV. Flavone metabolism was investigated in murine and human 
liver microsomes or cytosol in vitro co-incubated with uridine 
5'-diphosphoglucuronic acid or 3'-phosphoadenosine-5' phosphosulfate. Flavone 
metabolites were characterized by on-line HPLC-mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: After dietary administration of flavones for 7 days, levels of tricin 
in plasma, liver and mucosa exceeded those of apigenin by 350, 33 and 100%, 
respectively. Apigenin was more rapidly glucuronidated than tricin in liver 
microsomes, whilst tricin underwent swifter sulfonation than apigenin in liver 
cytosol. For either flavone the rate of glucuronidation was much faster than 
that of sulfonation. Flavone monoglucuronides and monosulfates were identified 
as metabolites in microsomal and cytosolic incubations, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: When consumed with the diet in mice tricin seems to be more 
available than apigenin in blood and tissues. Differences in their 
glucuronidation may account for their differential availability. Thus tricin may 
have a pharmacokinetic advantage over apigenin. This type of information may 
help decide which flavonoids to select for clinical development.

Although lettuce may provide relatively low levels of antioxidative 
phytochemicals which may contribute to human health, lettuce leaf extracts in 
fact contained compounds with high specific peroxyl radical scavenging 
activities. After determining the extraction conditions that minimized phenolic 
oxidation and produced the highest oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) 
values, the phenolic compounds from red leaf lettuce were separated by 
reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The primary 
phenolic compounds in the leaf tissue extracts were mono- and dicaffeoyltartaric 
acid (CTA and DCTA), mono- and dicaffeoylquinic acid (CQA and DCQA), quercetin 
3-malonylglucoside (QMG), quercetin 3-glucoside (QG), cyanidin 
3-malonylglucoside (CMG), and an unknown phenolic ester (UPE). Significant 
levels of DCQA were only found after wounding. Using the new fluorescein-based 
ORAC assay procedures, fractions from the HPLC analyses were assayed for peroxyl 
radical absorbance capacity. Using absorbance to estimate concentration, the 
decreasing order of contribution to the total ORAC value of an extract from 
wounded tissue was QMG > DCQA > CMG > DCTA > UPE > QG > CTA. The decreasing 
order of the specific peroxyl radical scavenging activities was CMG > QG > DCTA 
> DCQA > QMG > UPE > CQA > CTA. Since the concentrations of plant flavonoid and 
phenolic acid esters are sensitive to environmental factors, this information 
may be used to develop pre- and postharvest conditions which increase the 
dietary benefits of leaf lettuce.

Diosmetin (3',5,7-trihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone) is the aglycone of the flavonoid 
glycoside diosmin (3',5,7-trihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone-7-ramnoglucoside). 
Diosmin is hydrolyzed by enzymes of intestinal micro flora before absorption of 
its aglycone diosmetin. A specific, sensitive, precise, accurate and robust HPLC 
assay for the simultaneous determination of diosmin and diosmetin in human 
plasma was developed and validated. Plasma samples were incubated with 
beta-glucuronidase/sulphatase. The analytes were isolated by liquid-liquid 
extraction with tert-butyl methyl ether at pH 2, and separated on a C(18) 
reversed-phase column using a mixture of methanol/1% formic acid (58:42, v/v) at 
a flow rate of 0.5ml/min. APCI in the positive ion mode and multiple reaction 
monitoring (MRM) method was employed. The selected transitions for diosmin, 
diosmetin and the internal standard (7-ethoxycoumarin) at m/z were: 
609.0-->463.0, 301.2-->286.1 and 191, respectively. A good linearity was found 
in the range of 0.25-500ng/ml (R(2)>0.992) for both compounds. The intra-batch 
assay precision (CV) for diosmin and diosmetin ranged from 1.5% to 11.2% and 
from 2.8% to 12.5%, respectively, and the inter-batch precision were from 5.2% 
to 11.5% and 8.5% to 9.8%, respectively. The accuracy was well within the 
acceptable range the accuracies (from -2.7% to 4.2% and -1.6% to 3.5% for 
diosmin and diosmetin, respectively). The mean recoveries of diosmin, diosmetin 
and the internal standard were 87.5%, 89.2% and 67.2%. Stability studies showed 
that diosmin and diosmetin were stable in different conditions. Finally, the 
method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of diosmin in 
healthy volunteers following a single oral administration (Daflon).

BACKGROUND: Anthocyanins are potent antioxidants that are widely distributed in 
fruit, vegetables, and red wines. Anthocyanin products are also prescribed as 
medicines in many countries for treating various diseases. However, the 
pharmacokinetics of dietary anthocyanins are not known in humans because these 
glycosides were long considered nonabsorbable.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether anthocyanins can 
be absorbed as glycosides and to evaluate their pharmacokinetics in humans.
DESIGN: Four healthy elderly women consumed 720 mg anthocyanins. A series of 
blood and urine samples were collected before and after consumption of the 
anthocyanins. Anthocyanins were measured in plasma and urine by combining an 
octadecylsilane solid-phase extraction for sample preparation and an HPLC system 
with diode array for anthocyanin separation and detection. The structures of 
anthocyanins as glycosides in plasma and urine were further confirmed by using 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Anthocyanins were detected as glycosides in plasma and urine. The 
maximum plasma concentration of total anthocyanins varied from 55.3 to 168.3 
nmol/L, with an average of 97.4 nmol/L, and was reached within 71.3 min. The 
elimination of plasma anthocyanins appeared to follow first-order kinetics. The 
elimination half-life of plasma total anthocyanins was calculated to be 132.6 
min. Most anthocyanin compounds were excreted in urine during the first 4 h. The 
excretion rate of total anthocyanins was 77 microg/h during the first 4 h and 13 
microg/h during the second 4 h.
CONCLUSION: Anthocyanins are absorbed in their unchanged glycated forms in 
elderly women.

French wines are abundant sources of phenolic compounds. The content of several 
catechins, i.e., (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4, 
trimers C1, and trimer 2 (T2), of 160 French wines was determined by HPLC with 
UV detection. Red wines (n = 95) were found to have high levels of catechins, 
ranging from 32.8 to 209.8 mg/L (mean concentration 114.5 mg/L) for 
(+)-catechin, from 22.1 to 130.7 mg/L (mean concentration 75.7 mg/L) for 
(-)-epicatechin, from 7.8 to 39.1 mg/L (mean concentration 25.4 mg/L) for B1, 
from 18.3 to 93 mg/L (mean concentration 47.4 mg/L) for B2, from 21.4 to 215.6 
mg/L (mean concentration 119.6 mg/L) for B3, from 20.2 to 107.2 mg/L (mean 
concentration 81.9 mg/l) for B4, from 8.6 to 36.9 mg/L (mean concentration 26.3 
mg/L) for C1, and from 26.7 to 79.3 mg/L (mean concentration 67.1 mg/L) for T2. 
White and rosé wines (n = 57 and n = 8) were found to have low levels of 
(+)-catechin (mean concentrations 9.8 and 10.6 mg/L, respectively) and 
(-)-epicatechin (mean concentrations 5.3 and 6.5 mg/L, respectively). These data 
provide a basis for the epidemiological evaluation of catechin intake by the 
consumption of French wine.

A capillary zone electrophoresis method has been carried out to determine and 
quantitate some compounds of the polyphenolic fraction of virgin olive oil which 
have never previously been determined before using capillary electrophoresis, 
such as elenolic acid, ligstroside aglycon, oleuropein aglycon, and 
(+)-pinoresinol. The compounds were identified using standards obtained by 
semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A detailed method 
optimization was performed to separate the phenolic compounds present in olive 
oil using a methanol-water extract of Picual extra-virgin olive oil, and 
different extraction systems were compared (C18-solid phase extraction (SPE), 
Diol-SPE, Sax-SPE and liquid-liquid extraction). The optimized parameters were 
30 mM sodium tetraborate buffer (pH 9.3) at 25 kV with 8 s hydrodynamic 
injection, and the quantitation was carried out by the use of two reference 
compounds at two different wavelengths.

Mesembryanthemum edule L. is an edible and medicinal halophyte widespread in 
Tunisia seashore. In this study, parameters of oxidative stress, phenolic 
compounds and antioxidant activities were comparatively investigated in two 
M. edule provenances (Jerba and Bizerte, respectively sampled from arid and 
humid bioclimatic stages). Plants were subjected to 0, 300 and 600mM NaCl 
treatment under glasshouse conditions. Results showed that M. edule response to 
salinity depends on provenance (P), salt treatment (T) and their interaction 
(P×T). (T) affected more significantly the oxidative stress parameters and 
antioxidant activities than (P) and (P×T). Conversely, (P) was much affluent for 
tannin polymerization degree and interaction between the two factors (P×T) was 
more determinants for analyzed antioxidant parameters. The higher salt tolerance 
of Jerba plants was associated with low levels of malondialdehyde and of 
electrolyte leakage mainly at 600mM NaCl. Besides, antioxidant activities of 
Jerba provenance, were more efficient than Bizerte. In addition, avicularin was 
the major phenolic in both provenances. This compound concentration increased 
with salinity in Jerba shoots, while it was reduced in Bizerte especially at 
600mM NaCl. Overall, the higher salt tolerance of plants from Jerba provenance, 
and to a lower extent of those from Bizerte, may be partly related to their 
better capacity to limit oxidative damage when salt-challenged, and this is 
likely the result of redistribution in phenolic composition. Besides, abiotic 
factors such as salinity could be determinant in antioxidant potentiality of 
this medicinal plant.

Beans were pearled to evaluate the feasibility of increasing antioxidant 
activity and phenolic antioxidants. Phenolics were concentrated mostly in the 
hull fraction at about 56 mg of catechin equivalents per gram of sample. The 
methanolic extracts of the pearled bean samples were screened for antioxidant 
potential using the beta-carotene-linoleate and the 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in vitro model systems. The pearled 
material, also referred to as milled samples, exhibited antioxidant activity 
that correlated with phenolic content and inhibited DPPH significantly in a 
dose-dependent manner. Phenolics and antioxidant activities were also examined 
in chromatographic fractions of methanolic extracts of manually obtained hulls 
that represented a model used previously to ascertain antimutagenic activity. 
Fractions extracted with ethyl acetate/acetone and acetone displayed antioxidant 
activity, which implies potent free radical scavenging activity with 
antimutagenic activity.

The capabilities of spectrophotometric and electrochemical detection techniques 
were investigated for the high-performance liquid chromatographic determination 
of flavonoids. Liquid chromatographic analyses were performed on eleven 
compounds belonging to three different classes of flavonoids: flavanone 
glycosides, flavone and flavonol aglycones. Separation of all compounds examined 
was carried out under reversed-phase conditions on a C18 narrow-bore column for 
UV detection, whereas for electrochemical detection, a C18 standard-bore column 
was used. UV analyses were carried out at 280 nm for flavanones and at 265 nm 
for flavones and flavonols, whereas controlled-potential coulometric 
measurements were performed using a porous graphite electrode. Analytical 
performances of the methods were compared in terms of linearity, limits of 
detection (LODs) and precision. Linearity over two orders of magnitude and LODs 
at low-ppm levels (0.06-1 mg/l) were demonstrated for all techniques considered. 
Instrumental precision in terms of relative standard deviation was found to be 
between 0 and 5% for the liquid chromatography (LC)-UV system and between 0.6 
and 10% for the LC-electrochemical detection (ED) system. The methods developed 
were applied to the analysis of flavanones and flavonols in a real sample, such 
as an extract of orange juice. Even though quercetin glycoside is mostly present 
in orange juice as rutin, other different glycosides of this flavonol could be 
present; on this basis, the hydrolysis of all glycosides to aglycone allows one 
to obtain more accurate data on the flavonol concentration in orange juice. To 
avoid sample degradation and to increase extraction efficiency, quercetin 
hydrolysis was optimized using a central composite design to investigate the 
effects of acid concentration and hydrolysis time on extraction recovery.

The present study aims first to compare the antioxidant microconstituent 
contents between organically and conventionally grown tomatoes and, second, to 
evaluate whether the consumption of purees made of these tomatoes can 
differently affect the plasma levels of antioxidant microconstituents in humans. 
When results were expressed as fresh matter, organic tomatoes had higher vitamin 
C, carotenoids, and polyphenol contents (except for chlorogenic acid) than 
conventional tomatoes. When results were expressed as dry matter, no significant 
difference was found for lycopene and naringenin. In tomato purees, no 
difference in carotenoid content was found between the two modes of culture, 
whereas the concentrations of vitamin C and polyphenols remained higher in 
purees made out of organic tomatoes. For the nutritional intervention, no 
significant difference (after 3 weeks of consumption of 96 g/day of tomato 
puree) was found between the two purees with regard to their ability to affect 
the plasma levels of the two major antioxidants, vitamin C and lycopene.

High-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) coupled 
with electronspray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to detect the flavonoid 
profile in lemon juices obtained from the main Sicilian cultivars (Femminello 
comune, Monachello, and Interdonato). Significant amounts of an unusual 
constituent were found in the lemon juice of the above-mentioned cultivars 
together with eriocitrin, hesperidin, and diosmin. Following purification by 
preparative HPLC, the structure was assigned as 6,8-di-C-glucopyranosyldiosmetin 
by means of DAD-UV, ESI-MS-MS, and (1)H NMR analysis. Three other minor 
components were also detected. One of these presented a flavone nature, and 
spectral data and literature references both suggested a 
6,8-di-C-glucopyranosylapigenin structure. The different contents of eriocitrin, 
hesperidin, diosmin, and above minor components in the cultivars allow juices to 
be readily differentiated.

A clinical study was conducted to investigate the dose response and metabolism 
of strawberry anthocyanins. In a crossover study design, 12 healthy adults 
consumed each of 3 strawberry treatments. The treatments were 100 g, 200 g, and 
400 g of pureed strawberries, delivering 15 micromol, 30 micromol, and 60 
micromol anthocyanin, respectively. Urine samples were collected for 24 h after 
each dose and samples were analyzed by HPLC with diode array detection and ion 
trap MS. Pelargonidin 3-glucoside was the major anthocyanin form in the 
treatments, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside and 3 metabolites of pelargonidin 
3-glucoside (detected as monoglucuronides) were excreted in urine after 
ingestion. One predominant monoglucuronide form was detected in urine in masses 
10-fold higher than the other 2 monoglucuronide forms. Increasing dose resulted 
in increasing appearance of anthocyanins in urine, and the mass of each 
pelargonidin monoglucuronide increased in urine with increasing dose. These 
results suggest that pelargonidin 3-glucoside absorption and metabolism are not 
saturated at masses < or = 60 micromol, thus showing that more strawberry 
anthocyanin can be absorbed with increasing dose.

Greenhouse-grown tree ripe (TR) and mature green (MG) mangoes (cv. Irwin) were 
exposed to high electric field treatment before 20 and 30 days of storage at 5 
degrees C. MG fruits were allowed to ripen at room temperature after 
low-temperature storage. Fruit physical quality attributes, ascorbic acid, 
carotene, quercetin, total phenols, and antioxidant capacity were estimated 
before and after the storage period. Antioxidant capacity of fruit juice was 
estimated using the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. Fruit 
firmness decreased significantly during storage. Titratable acidity decreased 20 
days after storage. Total soluble solids did not change during storage. 
Antioxidant capacity of fruits remained unchanged up to 20 days of storage 
period and decreased thereafter. Total phenol and carotenes increased during 
storage. Antioxidant capacity of fruits was significantly correlated only to 
ascorbic acids. Peel color and carotenes were higher in TR fruits, whereas 
titratable acidity and firmness were higher in MG fruits. There was no 
significant difference in other parameters between the stages of picking. 
Electric field pretreatment affected the respiration and antioxidant capacity of 
TR fruits and did not have any significant affect on other parameters. TR 
mangoes of cv. Irwin are more suitable for low-temperature storage and can be 
successfully stored for up to 20 days at 5 degrees C without any significant 
losses in functional properties and quality attributes.

In this study the main chemical parameters, ascorbic acid and polyphenol 
content, and antioxidant activity of two varieties of prunes, dried by 
high-temperature (85 + 70 degrees C) and low-temperature (60 degrees C) 
procedures, were monitored during storage. Ascorbic acid content was higher in 
the prunes dried at 60 degrees C but significantly decreased in both varieties 
during storage. The different classes of polyphenols analyzed (cinnamates, 
anthocyanins, flavonols) showed different stabilities during storage. 
Neochlorogenic acid decreased only in the President variety, whereas chlorogenic 
acid increased in both varieties; anthocyanins, present only in the President 
prunes, disappeared in the first months of storage, and the flavonol content 
fell significantly in both cultivars during the year of the study. Drying 
temperature significantly affected the polyphenol content, with different 
effects according to the class of polyphenols. Antioxidant activity showed a 
significant increase at the end of the storage period and in the President 
variety was higher in the sample dried at the higher temperature.

A sensitive, rapid, efficient, and reliable method for the separation and 
determination of phenolic acids by capillary zone electrophoresis has been 
carried out. A detailed method optimization was carried out to separate 14 
different compounds by studying parameters such as pH, type and concentration of 
buffer, applied voltage, and injection time. The separation was performed within 
16 min, using a 25 mM sodium borate buffer (pH 9.6) at 25 kV with 8 s of 
hydrodynamic injection. With this method and using a liquid-liquid extraction 
system, with recovery values around 95%, it has been possible to detect small 
quantities of phenolic acids in olive oil samples. This is apparently the first 
paper showing the quantification of this specific family of phenolic compounds 
in virgin olive oil samples.

Fourteen phenolic acids have been selectively determined in olive-oil samples 
using the co-electrosmotic capillary electrophoresis mode with UV detection 
after the LLE extraction system. A polycationic surfactant (hexadimetrine 
bromide, HDB), which dynamically coats the inner surface of the capillary and 
causes a fast anodic electroosmotic flow, was added to the electrolyte. The main 
factors affecting co-electroosmotic flow (EOF) such as type of modifier, 
concentration, and influence of organic solvents have been studied. Other 
parameters such as pH, type, and concentration of buffer, applied voltage, and 
injection time were also optimised using hydrodynamic injection for 8 s and UV 
detection at 210 nm. The composition optimum of the running buffer used was a 
20% 2-propanol, 0.001% HDB, and 50 mM sodium borate at a pH value of 9.6. The 
method has been applied to determination and quantification of fourteen phenolic 
acids at ppb levels in olive oil samples after a liquid-liquid extraction.

We have recently demonstrated, in humans, the bioavailability of hydroxytyrosol 
(3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol; HT), one of the major antioxidant components of 
virgin olive oil. In particular, we reported that this compound is present in 
lipoproteins involved in atherosclerotic processes and is excreted in the urine 
mainly as glucuronide-conjugate. The aim of the present study was to elucidate, 
in humans, the metabolic fate of HT after ingestion of virgin olive oil. After 
administration of virgin olive oil, 24-hour urine collections of healthy 
volunteers were prepared for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses in 
order to identify and quantify HT and its metabolites homovanillic alcohol 
(HVA1c) and homovanillic acid (HVA). The results indicate that this compound 
undergoes the action of catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), enzymes involved 
in the catecholamine catabolism, resulting in an enhanced excretion of HVA1c. We 
also found a significant increase of HVA, indicating an oxidation of the 
ethanolic residue of HT and/or of HVA1c in humans. The excretion of both 
metabolites significantly correlated with the dose of administered HT.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Punicalagin is an antioxidant ellagitannin of pomegranate 
juice. This compound is responsible for the high antioxidant activity of this 
juice. Nothing is known about the bioavailability and metabolism of punicalagin 
or other food ellagitannins. The present work aims to evaluate the 
bioavailability and metabolism of punicalagin in the rat as an animal model.
DESIGN: Two groups of rats were studied. One fed with standard rat diet (n = 5) 
and another with the same diet plus 6 % punicalagin (n = 5). Samples of urine 
and faeces were taken during 37 days and plasma every week. The different 
metabolites were analysed by HPLC-MS-MS.
RESULTS: The daily intake of punicalagin ranged from 0.6 to 1.2 g. Values around 
3-6 % the ingested punicalagin were excreted as identified metabolites in faeces 
and urine. In faeces, punicalagin is transformed to hydrolysis products and 
partly metabolites by the rat microflora to 6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one 
derivatives. In plasma, punicalagin was detected at concentrations around 30 
microg/mL, and glucuronides of methyl ether derivatives of ellagic acid were 
also detected. 6H-Dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one derivatives were also detected 
especially during the last few weeks of the experiment. In urine, the main 
metabolites observed were the 6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one derivatives, as 
aglycones or glucuronides.
CONCLUSION: As only 3-6 % of the ingested punicalagin was detected as such or as 
metabolites in urine and faeces, the majority of this ellagitannin has to be 
converted to undetectable metabolites (i. e. CO(2)) or accumulated in 
non-analysed tissues, however with only traces of punicalagin metabolites being 
detected in liver or kidney. This is the first report on the absorption of an 
ellagitannin and its presence in plasma. In addition, the transformation of 
ellagic acid derivatives to 6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one derivatives in the rat is 
also confirmed.

Ellagitannins (ETs) are dietary polyphenols, containing ellagic acid (EA) 
subunits, with antioxidant and cancer chemopreventive activities that might 
contribute to health benefits in humans. However, little is known about their 
metabolic fate. We investigate here the metabolism of different dietary ETs and 
EA derivatives in humans. Forty healthy volunteers were distributed in four 
groups. Each group consumed, in a single dose, a different ET-containing 
foodstuff, i.e., strawberries (250 g), red raspberries (225 g), walnuts (35 g), 
and oak-aged red wine (300 mL). After the intake, five urine fractions (F) were 
collected at 8 (F1), 16 (F2), 32 (F3), 40 (F4), and 56 (F5) h. Neither ETs nor 
EA were detected in urine after LC-MS/MS analysis. However, the microbial 
metabolite 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one (urolithin B) conjugated 
with glucuronic acid was detected along the fractions F3-F5 in all of the 
subjects, independently of the consumed foodstuff. The mean percentage of 
metabolite excretion ranged from 2.8 (strawberries) to 16.6% (walnuts) regarding 
the ingested ETs. Considerable interindividual differences were noted, 
identifying ""high and low metabolite excreters"" in each group, which supported 
the involvement of the colonic microflora in ET metabolism. These results 
indicate that urolithin B (a previously described antiangiogenic and 
hyaluronidase inhibitor compound) is a biomarker of human exposure to dietary 
ETs and may be useful in intervention studies with ET-containing products. The 
antioxidant and anticarcinogenic effects of dietary ETs and EA should be 
considered in the gastrointestinal tract whereas the study of potential systemic 
activities should be focused on the bioavailable urolithin B derivatives.

Stoichiometric and kinetic values of phenolics against DPPH 
(2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) were determined for Andean purple corn (Zea mays 
L.) and red sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas). Both crops had higher antioxidant 
capacity and antiradical kinetics than blueberries and higher or similar 
anthocyanin and phenolic contents. The second-order rate constant (k(2)) was 
1.56, 1.12, 0.57, and 0.26 (mg antiradical/mL)(-1) s(-1) for red sweetpotato, 
Trolox, purple corn, and blueberry, respectively. On the molar basis of active 
hydroxyl groups, k(2)' showed the same order as for k(2). Corn cob and 
sweetpotato endodermis contributed the most in phenolic compounds and 
antioxidant capacity. Both crops studied can be considered as excellent novel 
sources of natural antioxidants for the functional food and dietary supplement 
markets.

Nineteen phenolic compounds including hydroxybenzoic acids, hydroxycinnamic 
acids, flavonoids, phenolic alcohols, and phenolic aldehydes have been 
identified and quantified in two monovarietal champagnes, Chardonnay and Pinot 
Noir, by using a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
system coupled with diode array detection. The identification of four 
hydroxycinnamic tartaric esters (caftaric, coutaric, fertaric, and 
2-S-glutathionylcaftaric acids), two flavanonols (astilbin and engeletin), and 
some other compounds was confirmed by HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry. 
Caftaric acid and tyrosol were the major phenols. Hydroxybenzoic acids and 
flavonoids were present at low concentrations. The phenolic compositions of 2000 
and 2001 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir vary quantitatively according to the year and 
the variety, but the chemical natures of the molecules are the same. The total 
phenolic content determined by colorimetric measurement ranges from 176 to 195 
mg/L of gallic acid equivalent and is similar to that described in white wines.

The antioxidant potential of eight clingstone peach cultivars was investigated 
by determining phenolic compounds and inhibition of low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) oxidation. Cultivars low in polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were also selected to 
minimize enzymatic browning. Inhibition of LDL oxidation varied from 17.0 to 
37.1% in peach flesh extract, from 15.2 to 49.8% in whole peach extract, and 
from 18.2 to 48.1% in peel extract. Total phenols were 432.8-768.1 mg/kg in 
flesh extract, 483.3-803.0 mg/kg in whole extract, and 910.9-1922.9 mg/kg in 
peel extract. The correlation coefficient between relative LDL antioxidant 
activity and concentration of total phenols was 0.76. Peel PPO activity was 
higher than flesh activity in most cultivars. The lowest PPO and specific 
activities were found in the Walgant cultivar, followed by Kakamas and 18-8-23. 
These three cultivars combine the desirable characteristics of strong 
antioxidant activity, low PPO activity, and lower susceptibility to browning 
reactions.

Liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) 
with positive and negative ion detection was used for the identification of 
flavonoids in Hakmeitau beans, a black seed cultivar of cowpea (Vigna sinensis). 
Gradient elution with water and acetonitrile, both containing 2% formic acid, 
was employed in chromatographic separation. The peaks were identified by 
comparison of the retention times and the UV-vis spectroscopic and mass 
spectrometric data with authentic standards and/or literature data. The 
identified flavonoids included six anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-O-galactoside, 
cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, malvidin 3-O-glucoside, 
peonidin 3-O-glucoside, and petunidin 3-O-glucoside) and four flavonol/flavonol 
glycosides (kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, quercetin, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, and 
quercetin 3-O-6' '-acetylglucoside). The tentatively identified flavonoids 
included two anthocyanins (malvidin 3-O-acetylglucoside and peonidin 
3-O-malonylglucoside) and three flavonol glycosides (myricetin-3-O-glucoside, 
quercetin 7-O-glucoside, and quercetin-3-O-diglucoside). These flavonoids are 
present in seed coats, and the contents of anthocyanins and flavonol glycosides 
were 20.7 and 2.0 mg/g, respectively.

Inhibition of thioredoxin reductase but not of glutathione reductase by the 
major classes of alkylating and platinum-containing anticancer compounds.

Mammalian thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is important for cell proliferation, 
antioxidant defense, and redox signaling. Together with glutathione reductase 
(GR) it is the main enzyme providing reducing equivalents to many cellular 
processes. GR and TrxR are flavoproteins of the same enzyme family, but only the 
latter is a selenoprotein. With the active site containing selenocysteine, TrxR 
may catalyze reduction of a wide range of substrates, but can at the same time 
easily be targeted by electrophilic compounds due to the extraordinarily high 
reactivity of a selenolate moiety. Here we addressed the inhibition of the 
enzyme by major anticancer alkylating agents and platinum-containing compounds 
and we compared it to that of GR. We confirmed prior studies suggesting that the 
nitrosourea carmustine can inhibit both GR and TrxR. We next found, however, 
that nitrogen mustards (chlorambucil and melphalan) and alkyl sulfonates 
(busulfan) efficiently inhibited TrxR while these compounds, surprisingly, did 
not inhibit GR. Inhibitions were concentration and time dependent and apparently 
irreversible. Anticancer anthracyclines (daunorubicin and doxorubicin) were, in 
contrast to the alkylating agents, not inhibitors but poor substrates of TrxR. 
We also found that TrxR, but not GR, was efficiently inhibited by both 
cisplatin, its monohydrated complex, and oxaliplatin. Carboplatin, in contrast, 
could not inhibit any of the two enzymes. These findings lead us to conclude 
that representative compounds of the major classes of clinically used anticancer 
alkylating agents and most platinum compounds may easily target TrxR, but not 
GR. The TrxR inhibition should thereby be considered as a factor that may 
contribute to the cytotoxicity seen upon clinical use of these drugs.

Recent studies indicate that anthocyanin intake conveys a variety of health 
benefits, which depend on absorption and metabolic mechanisms that deliver 
anthocyanins and their bioactive metabolites to responsive tissues. The 
anthocyanin bioavailability of red cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata) 
was evaluated as reflected by urinary excretion of anthocyanins and anthocyanin 
metabolites. Twelve volunteers consumed 100, 200, and 300 g of steamed red 
cabbage (containing 1.38 micromol of anthocyanins/g of cabbage) in a crossover 
design. Anthocyanin concentration in cabbage extract and urine was measured by 
HPLC-MS/MS. Six nonacylated and 30 acylated anthocyanins were detected in red 
cabbage, and 3 nonacylated anthocyanins, 8 acylated anthocyanins, and 4 
metabolites were present in urine. Mean 24 h excretion of intact anthocyanins 
increased linearly from 45 (100 g dose) to 65 nmol (300 g dose) for acylated 
anthocyanins and from 52 (100 g dose) to 79 nmol (300 g dose) for nonacylated 
anthocyanins. Urinary recovery of intact anthocyanins (percent of anthocyanin 
intake) decreased linearly from 0.041% (100 g dose) to 0.020% (300 g dose) for 
acylated anthocyanins and from 0.18% (100 g dose) to 0.09% (300 g dose) for 
nonacylated anthocyanins. Anthocyanin metabolites consisted of glucuronidated 
and methylated anthocyanins. The results show that red cabbage anthocyanins were 
excreted in both intact and metabolized forms and that recovery of nonacylated 
anthocyanins in urine was >4-fold that of acylated anthocyanins.

Absorption of cyanidin-based anthocyanins is not fully understood with respect 
to dose or anthocyanin structure. In feeding studies using whole foods, 
nonacylated anthocyanins are more bioavailable than their acylated counterparts, 
but the extent to which plant matrix determines relative bioavailability of 
anthocyanins is unknown. Using juice of purple carrots to circumvent matrix 
effects, a feeding trial was conducted to determine relative bioavailability of 
acylated and nonacylated anthocyanins and to assess dose-response effects. 
Appearance of anthocyanins in plasma was measured in 10 healthy adults for 8 h 
following consumption of purple carrot juice. Each subject consumed 50, 150, and 
250 mL of juice containing 76 micromol (65 mg), 228 micromol (194 mg), and 380 
micromol (323 mg) of total anthocyanins, respectively. Acylated anthocyanins 
comprised 76% of total anthocyanins in the juice, yet their bioavailability was 
found to be significantly less than that of nonacylated anthocyanins. Peak 
plasma concentrations of nonacylated anthocyanins were 4-fold higher than that 
for acylated anthocyanins. Absorption efficiency declined across the doses 
administered. Because the treatments were consumed as juice, it could be 
discerned that the difference in bioavailability of acylated versus nonacylated 
anthocyanins was not primarily caused by interactions with the plant matrix.

Understanding how the environment and production and cultivation practices 
influence the composition and quality of food crops is fundamental to the 
production of high-quality nutritious foods. In this 3-year study, total 
phenolics, percent soluble solids, ascorbic acid, and the flavonoid aglycones 
quercetin, kaempferol, and luteolin were measured in two varieties of tomato 
(Lycopersicon esculentum L. cv. Ropreco and Burbank) and two varieties of bell 
peppers (Capsicum annuum L. cv. California Wonder and Excalibur) grown by 
certified organic and conventional practices in a model system. Significantly 
higher levels of percent soluble solids (17%), quercetin (30%), kaempferol 
(17%), and ascorbic acid (26%) were found in Burbank tomatoes (fresh weight 
basis; FWB), whereas only levels of percent soluble solids (10%) and kaempferol 
(20%) were significantly higher in organic Ropreco tomatoes (FWB). Year-to-year 
variability was significant, and high values from 2003 influenced the 3-year 
average value of quercetin reported for organic Burbank tomatoes. Burbank 
tomatoes generally had higher levels of quercetin, kaempferol, total phenolics, 
and ascorbic acid as compared to Ropreco tomatoes. Bell peppers were influenced

Green tea cateachins (GTC). namely (-) epicatechin (EC), (-) epicatechin gallate 
(ECG), (-) epigallocatechin (EGC), and (-) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), have 
been studied extensively for their wide-ranging biological activities. The goal 
of the present study was to examine the stability of GTC as a mixture under 
various processing conditions. The stability study demonstrated that GTC was 
stable in water at room temperature. When it was brewed at 98 degrees C for 7 h, 
longjing GTC degraded by 20%. When longjing GTC and pure EGCG were autoclaved at 
120 degrees C for 20 min, the epimerization of EGCG to (-) gallocatechin gallate 
(GCG) was observed. The relatively high amount of GCG found in some tea drinks 
was most likely the epimerization product of EGCG during autoclaving. If other 
ingredients were absent, the GTC in aqueous solutions was pH-sensitive: the 
lower the pH, the more stable the GTC during storage. When it was added into 
commercially available soft drinks or sucrose solutions containing citric acid 
and ascorbic acid, longjing GTC exhibited varying stability irrespective of low 
pH value. This suggested that other ingredients used in production of tea drinks 
might interact with GTC and affect its stability. When canned and bottled tea 
drinks are produced, stored, and transported, the degradation of GTC must be 
taken into consideration.

Procyanidins are phenolic oligomers, mainly composed of (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin units that exhibit certain sensorial and physiological 
properties of interest (e.g., astringency and bitterness of food, antioxidant 
activity, etc.). This paper shows the development of a micellar electrokinetic 
chromatography (MEKC) method for the separation of three procyanidin dimers (B1, 
B2, and B3), their monomers ((+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin), and the cis- and 
trans-forms of p-coumaric acid. Separation conditions are optimized in terms of 
buffer pH, SDS concentration, and washing routine between injections. The best 
results in terms of peak resolution and reproducibility between separations were 
obtained with a MEKC running buffer at pH 5 with 100 mM SDS and a washing 
routine that includes a rinse step with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide. Using this new 
MEKC method it is possible to separate in less than 5 min the seven substances. 
More interestingly, it is demonstrated that the low pH used in this MEKC method 
allows one to obtain clean electropherograms when samples are injected. The 
method is shown to be reproducible between different days with relative standard 
deviation (RSD) values lower than 1% for migration times and lower than 7% for 
peak areas (3 days, 24 injections). The usefulness of this procedure to 
determine these compounds in effluents from food processing (i.e., soaking water 
from lentils, white beans and black beans) and in food by-products (i.e., almond 
peels) considered as potential procyanidin sources is demonstrated. To our 
knowledge, this is the first report of separation and determination of 
procyanidins in food samples done by capillary electrophoresis.

The alkylresorcinol (AR) content of Swedish wheat grain samples, as well as of 
cereal ingredients and cereal foods containing wheat and rye, was determined. 
The average total AR content in Swedish wheat was 412 microg/g (ranging between 
227 and 639 microg/g), which is lower than that in Swedish rye analyzed in a 
previous study. The relative composition of AR homologues was consistent for 
wheat samples and differed markedly from that of rye. Notably, the ratio of the 
homologues C17:0/C21:0 was approximately 0.1 in wheat and approximately 1.0 in 
rye, indicating that it can be used to distinguish between those two cereals. 
The AR content in cereal foods commonly consumed in Sweden varied widely, from 
nondetectable levels in white wheat flour and products not containing the outer 
parts of wheat and/or rye to >900 microg/g in some whole grain rye products. AR 
content in cereal foods was calculated from their recipes using average AR 
values for the cereal ingredients determined in this study. As there was a good 
correlation between calculated and analyzed AR levels in cereal foods (R2 = 
0.91), it is possible to estimate the proportion of whole grain wheat and/or rye 
in a given cereal product on the basis of AR content and C17:0/C21:0 ratio. ARs 
appear to be good markers of whole grain wheat and rye in foods, and their 
analysis may be an objective way to identify foods rich in whole grain wheat 
and/or rye or brans thereof.

Scutellarin is widely used in treating various cardiovascular diseases. Few data 
are available regarding its metabolism and pharmacokinetics in humans. The 
objectives of this study were to develop methods to identify major metabolites 
of scutellarin in human urine and plasma and to determine simultaneously the 
parent drug and its major metabolites in human plasma for pharmacokinetic 
studies. Four metabolites were detected in urine samples by liquid 
chromatography coupled with electrospray multi-stage mass spectrometry (MS), but 
only one of them was found in plasma. Its structure was confirmed as 
scutellarein 6-O-beta-D-glucuronide by MS, NMR, and UV absorbance spectra. The 
plasma concentrations of scutellarin and the major metabolite were 
simultaneously determined using liquid chromatography-tandem MS. After a single 
p.o. administration of 60 mg of scutellarin to 20 healthy subjects, the plasma 
concentrations of scutellarin were very low, and its plasma concentration-time 
curve was also anomalous. Plasma concentration of the major metabolite was 
comparatively high, and the peak plasma concentration was 87.0 +/- 29.1 ng/ml. 
The Tmax was late (7.85 +/- 1.62 h), and part of individual pharmacokinetic 
profiles showed double peaks, which indicated scutellarin could be absorbed into 
the intestine after hydrolysis to its aglycone by bacterial enzymes. This was 
followed by reconjugation in the intestinal cell and/or liver with glucuronic 
acid catalyzed by the phase II enzyme, which showed regioselectivity and species 
difference. The regioselectivity of glucuronoconjugation for scutellarin may be 
of importance for pharmacological activity. Plasma concentration of 
isoscutellarin can be used as a biomarker of scutellarin intake.

To investigate whether the bioavailability of isoflavones could be an 
alternative to fermented soy foods, the conjugated forms of soy nutritional 
supplement (containing 98% acetyl glucoside isoflavones) were consumed by eight 
human volunteers (three were Asian people and five were British). Their daily 
urine samples were collected before and after a 5-week consumption of 
supplementation period. Conjugated isoflavones of genistein, daidzein and 
glycitein were hydrolyzed by enzyme, extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether and 
analysed using liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass 
spectrometry. Daidzein, genistein, glycitein, dihydrogenistein, dihydrodaidzein 
and O-desmethylangolensin were identified and quantified simultaneously with 
high recoveries. The levels of free isoflavones and total isoflavones were 
compared, and isoflavone glucuronides were identified much higher than the 
corresponding sulfates or aglycone isoflavones. This method provided the 
measurement of isoflavones with high sensitivity and specificity and simplified 
the sample pre-treatment procedure. The limitation of detections of 
dihydrodaidzein, 3'-hydroxydaidzein, glycitein, daidzein, genistein, 
dihydrogenistein and O-desmethylangolensin were 37, 23.5, 12.2, 15.4, 14.8, 2.20 
and 0.31 pmol, respectively. Only 0.5 ml of urine sample was needed.

In this work, liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem ion-trap mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) was used to investigate the in-vivo and in-vitro 
metabolism of tectoridin. After oral administration of a single dose (100 mg 
kg(-1)) of tectoridin to healthy rats, faeces and urine samples were collected 
for 0-48 h and 0-24 h, respectively. Tectoridin was also incubated with rat 
intestinal flora and rat liver microsomes. Samples from in-vivo and in-vitro 
metabolism studies were purified using a C(18) solid-phase extraction cartridge, 
then separated using a reverse-phase C(18) column with methanol/ water (30:70, 
v/v, adjusted to pH 10.0 with ammonia water) as mobile phase and detected by an 
on-line MS(n) system. The structure of the metabolites was elucidated by 
comparing their molecular weights, retention times and full-scan MS(n) spectra 
with those of the parent drug. The results revealed six metabolites of 
tectoridin in urine (tectorigenin, hydrogenated tectorigenin, mono-hydroxylated 
tectorigenin, di-hydroxylated tectorigenin, glucuronide-conjugated tectorigenin 
and sulfate-conjugated tectorigenin); three metabolites in faeces (tectorigenin, 
di-hydroxylated tectorigenin and sulfateconjugated tectorigenin); one metabolite 
in the intestinal flora incubation mixture (tectorigenin), and four in the liver 
microsomal incubation mixture (tectorigenin, hydrogenated tectorigenin, 
mono-hydroxylated tectorigenin and di-hydroxylated tectorigenin). Except for 
tectorigenin, all other metabolites of tectoridin are reported for the first 
time.

Total anthocyanin pigments increased from 74.7 to 317 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW) 
from underripe to overripe for Marion blackberries and from 69.9 to 164 mg/100 g 
FW for Evergreen blackberries. Total phenolics did not show a marked change with 
maturity with values slightly decreasing from underripe to ripe. Antioxidant 
activities, while increasing with ripening, also did not show the marked change 
that total anthocyanins exhibited. The impact of variation due to plots, 
subsampling, sample preparation, and measurement on Marion composition was 
examined in detail. Plot-to-plot and sample differences were the major 
contributors to variation, with sample preparation being an important 
contributor for some parameters. Measurement variation was a relatively small 
component of the total variation. Total anthocyanins for 11 blackberry cultivars 
ranged from 131 to 256 mg/100 g FW (mean = 198), total phenolics ranged from 682 
to 1056 mg GAE/100 g FW (mean = 900), oxygen radical absorbance capacity ranged 
from 37.6 to 75.5 micromol TE/g FW (mean = 50.2), and ferric reducing 
antioxidant power ranged from 63.5 to 91.5 micromol TE/g FW (mean = 77.5).

Flavonols are polyphenolic secondary plant metabolites that are present in 
varying levels in commonly consumed fruits, vegetables and beverages. Flavonols 
have long held an interest for nutritionists, which has increased following a 
Dutch study in the early 1990's showing that dietary intake of flavonols was 
inversely correlated with the incidence of coronary heart disease. The main 
factors that have hindered workers in the field of flavonol research are (i) the 
accurate measurement of these compounds in foods and biological samples, and 
(ii) a dearth of information on their absorption and metabolism. This review 
aims to highlight the work of the authors in attempting to clarify the 
situation. The sensitive and selective HPLC procedure to identify and quantify 
common flavonols and their sugar conjugates is described. In addition, the 
results of an on-going screening program into the flavonol content of common 
produce and beverages are presented. The bioavailability of dietary flavonols is 
discussed with reference to an intervention study with onions, as well as pilot 
studies with tea, red wine and cherry tomatoes. It is concluded that flavonols 
are absorbable and accumulate in plasma and that consuming high 
flavonol-containing varieties of fruits and vegetables and particular types of 
beverages could increase their circulatory levels.

Epidemiological studies have shown that consumption of fruits and vegetables is 
associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases. Increased consumption of 
fruits and vegetables containing high levels of phytochemicals has been 
recommended to prevent chronic diseases related to oxidative stress in the human 
body. In this study, 10 common vegetables were selected on the basis of 
consumption per capita data in the United States. A more complete profile of 
phenolic distributions, including both free and bound phenolics in these 
vegetables, is reported here using new and modified methods. Broccoli possessed 
the highest total phenolic content, followed by spinach, yellow onion, red 
pepper, carrot, cabbage, potato, lettuce, celery, and cucumber. Red pepper had 
the highest total antioxidant activity, followed by broccoli, carrot, spinach, 
cabbage, yellow onion, celery, potato, lettuce, and cucumber. The phenolics 
antioxidant index (PAI) was proposed to evaluate the quality/quantity of 
phenolic contents in these vegetables and was calculated from the corrected 
total antioxidant activities by eliminating vitamin C contributions. 
Antiproliferative activities were also studied in vitro using HepG(2) human 
liver cancer cells. Spinach showed the highest inhibitory effect, followed by 
cabbage, red pepper, onion, and broccoli. On the basis of these results, the 
bioactivity index (BI) for dietary cancer prevention is proposed to provide a 
simple reference for consumers to choose vegetables in accordance with their 
beneficial activities. The BI could be a new alternative biomarker for future 
epidemiological studies in dietary cancer prevention and health promotion.

Peanuts are consumed mostly as processed products. Although the effect of 
processing on isoflavone composition of legumes has been extensively studied, 
there has been no such study on peanuts. The objective of this study was to 
evaluate the effect of processing (boiling, oil- and dry-roasting) on the 
phytochemical composition of peanuts. Boiling had a significant effect on the 
phytochemical composition of peanuts compared to oil- and dry-roasting. Boiled 
peanuts had the highest total flavonoid and polyphenol content. The biochanin A 
and genistein content of boiled peanut extracts were two- and fourfold higher, 
respectively. trans-Resveratrol was detected only in the boiled peanuts, with 
the commercial product having a significantly (p < or = 0.05) higher 
concentration. Ultraviolet and mass spectrometry chromatograms for the boiled 
peanut extracts show the presence of four additional peaks that were not 
observed in the raw peanut extracts.

Peanuts have been reported to contain bioactive phytochemicals, particularly 
isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, and biochanin A) and trans-resveratrol. 
Currently, limited data are available regarding the levels of these bioactive 
compounds in peanuts with variations in reported levels. The purpose of this 
study was to compare four methods of extraction [stirring, sonication, Soxtec, 
and microwave-assisted sonication (MAS)] for runner peanuts. Quantification of 
the selected compounds was conducted by reverse-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography (RP-HPLC). The results showed that the MAS and Soxtec methods 
extracted significantly higher amounts of the phytochemicals. Also, the defatted 
peanuts gave significantly higher amounts of the phytochemicals compared to the 
nondefatted peanuts. The high levels of the isoflavones may be attributed to 
heat-induced conversion of conjugate glycosides to aglycons. The MAS and Soxtec 
methods may be used for total isoflavone content quantitation, while sonication 
or stirring may be the method of choice for quantitation of isoflavone 
composition (aglycons and glycoside conjugates) in peanuts.

To study the effect of polyphenolics on antioxidant capacities of plums, the 
amounts of total phenolics, total flavonoids and individual phenolic compounds, 
and vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC) of eleven plum cultivars 
was determined. There was a good linear relationship between the amount of total 
phenolics and total antioxidant capacity (r2 = 0.9887). The amount of total 
flavonoids and total antioxidant capacity also showed a good correlation (r2 = 
0.9653). Although the summation of individual antioxidant capacity was lower 
than the total antioxidant capacity of plum samples, there was a positive 
correlation (r2 = 0.9299) of total antioxidant capacity of plum samples with the 
sum of the VCEACs calculated from individual phenolics. Chlorogenic acids and 
glycosides of cyanidin, peonidin, and quercetin were major phenolics among 
eleven plum cultivars. The antioxidant capacity of chlorogenic acids and 
anthocyanins showed higher correlation (r2) of 0.7751 and 0.6616 to total VCEAC, 
respectively, than that of quercetin glycosides (r2 = 0.0279). Chlorogenic acids 
were a major source of antioxidant activity in plums, and the consumption of one 
serving (100 g) of plums can provide antioxidants equivalent to 144.4-889.6 mg 
of vitamin C.

To study the effect of polyphenolics on antioxidant activities of cabbages, the 
amounts of total phenolics, total flavonoids, antioxidant capacity and 
individual phenolic compounds in raw and processed cabbages were determined. 
Fresh and pickled red cabbages exhibited the highest total phenolic contents 
(393.1+/-10.8 mg and 366.3+/-3.6 mg gallic acid equivalents/100 g fresh sample, 
respectively). Fresh and pickled red cabbages were also highest in flavonoids 
(108.1+/-9.3 mg and 72.4+/-4.4 mg catechin equivalents/100 g fresh sample, 
respectively). The antioxidant capacity (expressed as vitamin C equivalent 
antioxidant capacity) ranged from 57.1 to 695.6 mg vitamin C equivalents/100 g 
fresh sample, where raw and pickled red cabbages exhibited the highest 
antioxidant capacity. There was a good linear relationship between the total 
phenolics and antioxidant capacity (r2=0.9743), and between the total flavonoids 
and antioxidant capacity (r2=0.9557); however, the relationship between the 
ascorbic acid content and antioxidant capacity was very low (r2=0.1442). The 
antioxidant capacity of raw and processed cabbages was highly correlated with 
their contents of polyphenolics. Kaempferol, quercetin, and apigenin were the 
major flavonoids existing in cabbages except for raw and pickled red cabbages, 
where cyanidin was the predominant flavonoid (73.6-117.7 mg/kg). In the red 
cabbages, cyanidin was the major contributor to the antioxidant capacity as well 
as the content of total phenolics and flavonoids.

Most methods for detecting isoflavones in biological samples do not measure the 
concentration of sulfate conjugates. An LC-MS method is reported here to 
estimate urinary concentrations of genistein and daidzein, their sulfate and 
glucuronide conjugates and other major metabolites. Human and rat urine samples 
were extracted with diethyl ether, or pre-digested with sulfatase and/or 
beta-glucuronidase followed by extraction. The isoflavones were separated using 
gradient LC methods and detected by negative single ion monitoring on an MS 
system using a heated nebulizer atmospheric pressure chemical ionization 
interface. CVs for inter- and intra-assay variability were generally < 20 and 
10%, respectively. Preliminary studies using these procedures demonstrate 52+/-4 
and 26+/-4% of genistein in rat urine was found as the aglycone and sulfate 
conjugates, respectively, compared to 0.36 and 4%, respectively, in human urine. 
This method is suitable for the study of isoflavone sulfate conjugates in 
biological fluids.

A method has been developed for the analysis of phytoestrogens and their 
conjugates in human urine using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization 
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Stable isotopically labeled 
[13C(3)]daidzein and [13C(3)]genistein were synthesized and used as internal 
standards for isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Free aglycons and intact 
glucuronide, sulfate, diglucuronide, disulfate, and mixed sulfoglucuronide 
conjugates of isoflavones and lignans were observed in naturally incurred urine 
samples. Sample pretreatment was not necessary, other than addition of internal 
standards and pH adjustment. Urine was injected directly onto the analytical 
column. The limits of detection were generally <50ng/ml, precision was generally 
<10% CV for conjugates. Total hydrolyzed daidzein and genistein were measured 
against quality assurance urine sample and were accurate to within 12%. The 
accuracy of conjugate measurement can not be ascertained, as no reference 
samples are available. The mean sum of daidzein and its conjugates was within 
20% of the hydrolyzed value. Concentrations of the free aglycons of up to 22% of 
genistein and 18% of daidzein were observed. The average pattern was ca. 54% 
7-glucuronide, 25% 4(')-glucuronide, 13% monosulfates, 7% free daidzein, 0.9% 
sulfoglucuronides, 0.4% diglucuronide, and <0.1% disulfate. Selective enzymatic 
deconjugation with glucuronidase and mixed glucuronidase/sulfatase were used to 
validate the accuracy of the quantitation of the intact daidzein conjugates. 
There were no apparent sex differences, or conditioning effects on the 
conjugation profile of isoflavones after chronic dosing.

Fish and fish products (14 samples), Indian foods and meals (10 samples), spices 
(30 samples) and beers (10 samples) were analysed for their phytoestrogen 
content, and a number of significant non-soya sources of dietary phytoestrogens 
were identified. No isoflavones were detected in unprocessed, farmed or ocean 
fish, but some samples of processed fish products contained soya isoflavones, 
which are assumed to come from coatings or protein addition. Additionally, some 
processed fish products contained, genistein glycocongugates not derived from 
soya. Genistein was detected in Indian meals such that, for example, a single 
portion of a vindalooo curry contained 11 mg genistein. The origin was most 
likely from the spices used, since the analysis of curry powders, chilli powder, 
crushed red chillies, garam masala and tandoori powder revealed that some 
contained genistein at more than 100 mg kg(-1). Cumin was the most likely source 
material, although not all individual samples of cumin tested contained high 
levels of genistein. Prenylnaringenin phytoestrogens were determined in UK 
hop-based beers at mean concentrations of 0.21 mg(-1) 6-prenylnaringenin and 
0.06mg(-1) 8-prenylnaringenin. The beers also contained traces of daidzein, 
genistein and biochanin A. The significance of 'hidden soya' in processed foods 
and these non-soya sources of phytoestrogens is that UK dietary intake of 
phytoestrogens must be assumed to be higher than estimated previously and that 
some sources of phytoestrogens remain poorly characterized.

The release of ferulic acid and the subsequent thermal or enzymatic 
decarboxylation to 4-vinylguaiacol are inherent to the beer production process. 
Phenolic, medicinal, or clove-like flavors originating from 4-vinylguaiacol 
frequently occur in beer made with wheat or wheat malt. To evaluate the release 
of ferulic acid and the transformation to 4-vinylguaiacol, beer was brewed with 
different proportions of barley malt, wheat, and wheat malt. Ferulic acid as 
well as 4-vinylguaiacol levels were determined by HPLC at several stages of the 
beer production process. During brewing, ferulic acid was released at the 
initial mashing phase, whereas moderate levels of 4-vinylguaiacol were formed by 
wort boiling. Higher levels of the phenolic flavor compound were produced during 
fermentations with brewery yeast strains of the Pof(+) phenotype. In beer made 
with barley malt, ferulic acid was mainly released during the brewing process. 
Conversely, 60-90% of ferulic acid in wheat or wheat malt beer was hydrolyzed 
during fermentation, causing higher 4-vinylguaiacol levels in these beers. As 
cereal enzymes are most likely inactivated during wort boiling, the additional 
release of ferulic acid during fermentation suggests the activity of feruloyl 
esterases produced by brewer's yeast.

Phenolic acids (chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic, ellagic, and 
syringic acid) as well as syringaldehyde and juglone were identified in ripe 
fruits of 10 walnut cultivars: Adams, Cisco, Chandler, Franquette, Lara, Fernor, 
Fernette, Alsoszentivani 117 (A-117), Rasna, and Elit. Analyses were done using 
a high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a diode array detector. 
Significant differences in the contents of identified phenolics were observed 
among cultivars. Phenolics were determined separately in the kernel and in the 
thin skin of the walnut, termed the pellicle. Not only in the kernel but also in 
the pellicle did syringic acid, juglone, and ellagic acid predominate (average 
values of 33.83, 11.75, and 5.90 mg/100 g of kernel; and 1003.24, 317.90, and 
128.98 mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively), and the contents of ferulic and 
sinapic acid (average values of 0.06 and 0.05 mg/100 g of kernel and 2.93 and 
2.17 mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively) were the lowest in all cultivars. The 
highest differences in the sum of all identified phenolics were observed between 
Rasna and Fernette fruits; in Rasna there were >2-fold higher contents of 
identified phenolics in both kernel and pellicle. It was found that the walnut 
pellicle is the most important source of walnut phenolics. The ratio between the 
contents in pellicle and kernel varied by at least 14.8-fold for caffeic acid 
(cv. Adams) and by up to 752.0-fold for p-coumaric acid (cv. Elit).

Biotransformation of the phytoestrogen [14C]genistein was investigated in male 
and female rats by application of narrow-bore radio-HPLC-MSn (LCQ, Finnigan) to 
determine intermediates in metabolism. Urine contained five metabolites, 
Gm1-Gm5, 24 h after dosing by gavage with [14C]genistein (4 mg kg(-1)). 
Structural analysis following ESI revealed molecular ions [M+H]+ of m/z 447, 
449, 273, and 271 for metabolites Gm2, Gm3, Gm5 and genistein, respectively and 
an [M-H]- of m/z 349 for Gm4. Metabolite structure was deduced by evaluation of 
product ion spectra derived from unlabelled and [14C]-labelled ions and 
sensitivity to treatment with beta-glucuronidase. These studies indicated 
identity of metabolites with genistein glucuronide (Gm2), dihydrogenistein 
glucuronide (Gm3), genistein sulphate (Gm4) and dihydrogenistein (Gm5). 
Detection of the beta-glucuronidase resistant major metabolite Gm1 by ESI was 
poor and so was analysed by negative ion APCI; this revealed a deprotonated 
molecular ion of m/z 165 which had chromatographic and mass spectral properties 
consistent with authentic 4-hydroxyphenyl-2-propionic acid, a novel metabolite 
of genistein. In vitro metabolism studies with anaerobic caecal cultures derived 
from male and female rats revealed metabolism of genistein to Gm1 via Gm5 and an 
additional metabolite (Gm6) which was identified from product ion spectra as 
6'-hydroxy-O-desmethylangolensin. Biotransformation of genistein by both 
isolated hepatocytes and precision-cut liver slices was limited to 
glucuronidation of parent compound. Commonality of genistein metabolites found 
in rats with those reported in man suggest similar pathways of 
biotransformation, primarily involving gut micro-flora.

Anthocyanins are potent antioxidants that may possess chronic disease preventive 
properties. Here, rapid, reliable, and reproducible solid-phase extraction, 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and mass spectrometry techniques 
are described for the isolation, separation, and identification of anthocyanins 
in human plasma and urine. Recoveries of cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) were 91% 
from water, 71% from plasma, and 81% from urine. Intra- and interday variations 
for C3G extraction were 9 and 9.1% in plasma and 7.1 and 9.1% in urine and were 
less than 15% for all anthocyanins from a standardized bilberry extract 
(mirtoselect). Analysis of mirtoselect by HPLC with UV detection produced 
spectra with 15 peaks compatible with anthocyanin components found in 
mirtoselect within a total run time of 15 min. Chromatographic analysis of human 
urine obtained after an oral dose of mirtoselect yielded 19 anthocyanin peaks. 
Mass spectrometric analysis employing multiple reaction monitoring suggests the 
presence of unchanged anthocyanins and anthocyanidin glucuronide metabolites.

A HPTLC-densitometric method, based on an external standard approach, was 
developed in order to obtain a novel procedure for routine analysis of 
secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) in flaxseed with a minimum of sample 
pre-treatment. Optimization of TLC conditions for the densitometric scanning was 
reached by eluting HPTLC silica gel plates in a horizontal developing chamber. 
Quantitation of SDG was performed in single beam reflectance mode by using a 
computer-controlled densitometric scanner and applying a five-point calibration 
in the 1.00-10.00 microg/spot range. As no sample preparation was required, the 
proposed HPTLC-densitometric procedure demonstrated to be reliable, yet using an 
external standard approach. The proposed method is precise, reproducible and 
accurate and can be employed profitably in place of HPLC for the determination 
of SDG in complex matrices.

The validation of a HPTLC-densitometric method for the determination of 
secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) in flaxseed was performed improving the 
reproducibility of a previously reported HPTLC densitometric procedure by the 
use of fully wettable reversed phase plates (silica gel 60 RP18W F(254S), 
10cmx10cm) with MeOH:HCOOH 0.1% (40:60, v/v) mobile phase. The analysis required 
only the alkaline hydrolysis in aqueous medium of undefatted samples and 
densitometry at 282nm of HPTLC runs. The method was validated following the 
protocol proposed by the Société Francaise des Sciences et Techniques 
Pharmaceutiques (SFSTP) giving rise to a dependable and high throughput 
procedure well suited to routine application. SDG was quantified in the range of 
321-1071ng with RSD of repeatability and intermediate precision not exceeding 
3.61% and accuracy inside the acceptance limits. Flaxseed of five cultivars of 
different origin was elected as test-bed.

Six strawberry cultivars grown on the same commercial plantation in Brazil were 
evaluated for their chemical composition and quality attributes at the ripe 
stage. The profiles of the main soluble sugars, ascorbic acid, and anthocyanins 
were also obtained during the developmental stages. Results showed significant 
differences among cultivars in all of the investigated parameters. Cv. 
Campineiro showed an average value for texture of 0.63 N, half the value found 
for cv. Oso Grande. Anthocyanin content ranged from 13 (cv. Campineiro) to 55 
(cv. Mazi) mg/100 g. Total ascorbic acid found for cv. Campineiro (85 mg/100 g) 
was twice the amount found in cv. Dover (40 mg/100 g). Fructose was the 
predominant soluble sugar in almost all cultivars. The proportion among the main 
soluble sugars (fructose, sucrose, and glucose) was similar for Oso Grande and 
Toyonoka cultivars. The flavonol content (quercetin plus kaempferol derivatives) 
ranged from 2.7 to 7.1 mg/100 g, with a mean value of 6.1 mg/100 g, whereas free 
ellagic acid ranged from 0.9 to 1.9 and total phenolics varied from 159 to 289 
(mean 221) mg/100 g.

Dynamics of lipid oxidation and antioxidant depletion in Mediterranean fish 
stored at different temperatures.

Numerous changes occur post-mortem in fish, affecting its chemical composition 
and nutritional quality. In the present paper we describe the effect of storage 
on ice or at -30 degrees C or -80 degrees C on 10 species of Mediterranean fish. 
Water and lipid soluble antioxidants, lipid pattern and products of oxidative 
attack on lipids, proteins and DNA were quantified for 7 consecutive days on 
homogenates of fish light muscle. The earliest events were oxidation of 
ubiquinol and vitamin C, which disappeared almost completely within 48 hours. 
Ubiquinol oxidation gave rise to an initial increase of ubiquinone, which peaked 
at the second day: thereafter ubiquinone itslef decreased, more rapidly and to a 
greater extent than vitamin E. The decrease in antioxidants was accompanied by 
significant oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. TBARS significantly 
increased beginning from the third day of storage in all species and were linked 
to a significant reduction in the n-3 PUFA of triglycerides (TG) and 
phospholipid fractions (PL). A remarkable elevation of protein carbonyls and 
8OHdG occurred approximately 24 hours later than PUFA oxidation. For SOD, GPX 
and GSH significant depletions occurred for all species only at 6th or 7th day, 
but the final values were always higher than 50% compared to the initial ones. 
Deep-freezing of the same species at -30 degrees C and -80 degrees C for up to 
12 months did not significantly affect the levels of enzymatic antioxidants, the 
redox couple GSH/GS-SG, n-3 and n-6 PUFA of TG and PL fractions of the light 
muscle. The only antioxidants, which at -30 degrees C and -80 degrees C appeared 
to be degraded after 6 and 12 months were ubiquinol and vitamin C. As expected 
their degradation was higher at -30 degrees C than at -80 degrees C. In fact the 
average decrease for ubiquinol at -80 degrees C was 42% at 6 and 12 months 
respectively, whereas at -30 degrees C the decrease was 61% and 87% For vitamin 
C the average decrease at -80 degrees C was 36% and 67% at 6 and 12 months 
respectively, and at -30 degrees C it was 61% and 82%. Vitamin E was 
considerably more stable than ubiquinol and vitamin C. The relative stability of 
the antioxidants, with the exceptions of ubiquionols, vitamin C and, to a 
certain extent, vitamin E, was accompanied by a very limited increase in 
oxidation products. In addition no significant hydrolysis of TG and PL fractions 
were observed throughout the storage time. The dynamics of lipid, protein and 
DNA oxidation is discussed in the light of depletion of the various antioxidant 
systems.

Simultaneous determination of alcohols, amines, amino acids, flavonoids, and 
purine and pyrimidine bases in bottled beer samples directly without any 
pre-treatment was carried out by capillary zone electrophoresis with diode-array 
detection. Electrolyte conditions such as pH, composition and concentration of 
the buffer, working voltage and type and time of injection were checked. The 
best separation of the cited analytes was achieved in 70 mM sodium borate 
solution and pH 10.25. The detection limits were from 2.1 to 5.6 mg L(-1) for 
the 18 compounds studied. The developed method is rapid, sensitive and 
quantitative and has been applied to seven types of international bottled beers 
of different origins bought locally.

Human bioavailability of the flavonoid dihydrochalcones is little understood, 
and no evidence exists for C-glycosyl flavonoid absorption in humans. The 
present study uses catechol-O-methyltransferase to generate methylated 
metabolites of aspalathin (a C-glycosyl dihydrochalcone from rooibos tea). One 
of the methylated forms, both with and without glucuronidation, was detected 
using LC-MS/MS in the urine of human subjects (n = 6), demonstrating that 
deglycosylation is not a prerequisite for C-glycosyl flavonoid absorption. 
Methylation is catalysed by both intestine and liver cytosolic extracts. The 
results show that flavonoid C-glycosides are methylated and glucuronidated in 
vivo in an intact form in humans.

Noncovalent complexes were used for structural determination and isomer 
differentiation of flavonoid glucuronides. Several flavonoid glucuronides 
including naringenin-7-O-glucuronide, synthesized here for the first time, were 
used as test compounds. Electrospray ionization quadrupole ion trap mass 
spectrometry with collision-induced dissociation (CID) was used to analyze 
complexes of the form [Co(II) (L-H) (Aux)]+ and [Co(II) (L-H) (Aux)2]+, in which 
L is the flavonoid glucuronide and Aux is a phenanthroline-based ligand. These 
complexes yielded characteristic fragmentation patterns that facilitated 
assignment of the substitution position of the glucuronides. The methods were 
adapted to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with 
postcolumn cobalt complexation and were tested on extracts from biological 
fluids. The metabolites naringenin-7-O-glucuronide and 
naringenin-4'-O-glucuronide were detected in human urine following the 
consumption of grapefruit juice. Isomeric quercetin glucuronides were identified 
and differentiated after spiking rat plasma at the 1 microM level, proving that 
the new methods are effective at biologically relevant concentrations.

Phenolic compounds in kiwifruit pulp were separated and characterized by 
reversed-phase HPLC, and the effect of juice processing on the phenolic 
composition was studied. Fractionation of phenolic compounds was achieved 
through selective elution from C-18 cartridges prior to preconcentration and 
subsequent separation by HPLC. Strongly acidic compounds were identified as 
derivatives of coumaric and caffeic acids, including chlorogenic acid, 
protocatechuic acid, and a derivative of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. The weakly 
acidic fraction contained epicatechin, catechin, and procyanidins (B3, B2, or B4 
and oligomers). Flavonols were present as the glycosides of quercetin 
(glucoside, rhamnoside, and rutinoside) and kaempferol (rhamnoside and 
rutinoside). Phenolic compounds were present, at levels of <1-7 mg/L, in 
clarified juice. The concentration of phenolics was highest after 
high-temperature short-time treatment (HTST) of juice. Hydrolysis of 
hydroxycinnamic acids occurred after enzyme addition and HTST treatment. The 
flavonol glycoside composition is the best identifier of kiwifruit juice.

The position of conjugation of the flavonoid quercetin dramatically affects 
biological activity in vitro, therefore it is important to determine the exact 
nature of the plasma metabolites. In the present study, we have used various 
methods (HPLC with diode array detection, LCMS, chemical and enzymic synthesis 
of authentic conjugates and specific enzymic hydrolysis) to show that quercetin 
glucosides are not present in plasma of human subjects 1.5 h after consumption 
of onions (a rich source of flavonoid glucosides). All four individuals had 
similar qualitative profiles of metabolites. The major circulating compounds in 
the plasma after 1.5 h are identified as quercetin-3-glucuronide, 
3'-methylquercetin-3-glucuronide and quercetin-3'-sulfate. The existence of 
substitutions in the B and/or C ring of plasma quercetin metabolites suggests 
that these conjugates will each have very different biological activities.

A LC-MS method was developed for the determination of coumarin, vanillin, and 
ethyl vanillin in vanilla products. Samples were analyzed using LC-electrospray 
ionization (ESI)-MS in the positive ionization mode. Limits of detection for the 
method ranged from 0.051 to 0.073 microg mL(-1). Using the optimized method, 24 
vanilla products were analyzed. All samples tested negative for coumarin. 
Concentrations ranged from 0.38 to 8.59 mg mL(-1) (x =3.73) for vanillin and 
0.33 to 2.27 mg mL(-1) (x =1.03) for ethyl vanillin. The measured concentrations 
are compared to values calculated using UV monitoring and to results reported in 
a similar survey in 1988. Analytical results, method precision, and accuracy

The phytochemical profiles (total phenolics, anthocyanins, ferulic acid, 
carotenoids) and antioxidant activities of five types of corn (white, yellow, 
high carotenoid, blue, and red) processed into masa, tortillas, and tortilla 
chips were studied. The nixtamalization process significantly (p < 0.05) reduced 
total phenolics and antioxidant activities when compared to raw grains. 
Nixtamalized grains exhibited higher concentration of free phenolics and soluble 
conjugated ferulic acid and had lower concentrations of bound phenolics and 
ferulic acid than unprocessed grains. Among processed products, there was little 
difference in the phytochemical contents and antioxidant activities. Among types 
of corn, the highest concentrations of total phenolics, ferulic acid, and 
antioxidant activity were observed in the high-carotenoid genotype followed by 
the regular yellow counterpart. The white corn contained the lowest amount of 
total phenolics and antioxidant activity. The pigmented blue corn had the 
highest anthocyanin concentration followed by the red counterpart. These 
findings suggest that lime-cooking significantly reduced the phytochemical 
content of nixtamalized products but released phenolics and ferulic acid.

OBJECTIVE: To establish a method for determining isofraxidin concentrations in 
Sarcandra glabra and Qingrexiaoyanning capsules with high-performance liquid 
chromatographic-mass spectrometry.
METHODS: Isofraxidin was extracted from Sarcandra glabra and Qingrexiaoyanning 
capsules with acetic ether and chloroform, respectively, and separated by 
isocratic reversed-phase chromatography. The mass spectrometric system was 
operated in multiple reaction monitoring mode. A pair of ions: precursor ion m/z 
223 with product ion m/z 162 were chosen for the quantification of the analyte.
RESULTS: The retention time of isofraxidin was 6.60 min, and the calibration 
curve was linear over a concentration range from 484 to 9 680 ng/ml. The average 
recovery was 96.7% and RSD 4.49%, with detection limit of 1 ng/ml.
CONCLUSION: The method is rapid, selective and sensitive for determining 
isofraxidin in Sarcandra glabra and Qingrexiaoyanning capsules.

The biological benefits of olive oil in preventing the oxidation of low density 
lipoprotein (LDL) would seem to be linked to its high monounsaturated fatty acid 
contents, but also to its respective phenolic compounds contents. One 
prerequisite to assess the in vivo physiological significance of phenolic 
compounds is to determine their presence in human LDL following the ingestion of 
virgin olive oil. In this work, olive oil phenolic metabolites were identified 
using high-performance liquid chromatography in tandem with electrospray mass 
spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) detection, after solid phase extraction (SPE). 
Quantitative methods were developed in carrying out linearity, precision, 
sensitivity and recovery tests. The results from two methods of LDL separation 
were compared and shorter LDL isolation procedure showed a better recovery for 
antioxidants compounds in LDL. The metabolites identified in LDL were: 
hydroxytyrosol monoglucuronide, hydroxytyrosol monosulfate, tyrosol glucuronide, 
tyrosol sulfate and homovanillic acid sulfate. The fact that olive oil phenolic 
metabolites are able to bind LDL strengthens claims that these compounds act as 
in vivo antioxidants.

In human LDL, the bioactivity of olive oil phenols is determined by the in vivo 
disposition of the biological metabolites of these compounds. Here, we examined 
how the ingestion of 2 similar olive oils affected the content of the metabolic 
forms of olive oil phenols in LDL in men. The oils differed in phenol 
concentrations as follows: high (629 mg/L) for virgin olive oil (VOO) and null 
(0 mg/L) for refined olive oil (ROO). The study population consisted of a 
subsample from the EUROLIVE study and a randomized controlled, crossover design 
was used. Intervention periods lasted 3 wk and were preceded by a 2-wk washout 
period. The levels of LDL hydroxytyrosol monosulfate and homovanillic acid 
sulfate, but not of tyrosol sulfate, increased after VOO ingestion (P < 0.05), 
whereas the concentrations of circulating oxidation markers, including oxidized 
LDL (oxLDL), conjugated dienes, and hydroxy fatty acids, decreased (P < 0.05). 
The levels of LDL phenols and oxidation markers were not affected by ROO 
consumption. The relative increase in the 3 LDL phenols was greater when men 
consumed VOO than when they consumed ROO (P < 0.05), as was the relative 
decrease in plasma oxLDL (P = 0.001) and hydroxy fatty acids (P < 0.001). Plasma 
oxLDL concentrations were negatively correlated with the LDL phenol levels (r = 
-0.296; P = 0.013). Phenols in LDL were not associated with other oxidation 
markers. In summary, the phenol concentration of olive oil modulates the 
phenolic metabolite content in LDL after sustained, daily consumption. The 
inverse relationship of these metabolites with the degree of LDL oxidation 
supports the in vivo antioxidant role of olive oil phenolics compounds.

Trypsin inhibitors (TI), tannins, and lectins appear to have a role in 
preventing chronic diseases in humans. The genetic variability of these traits 
in common bean needs to be ascertained in order to increase levels through 
breeding. The variability of TI, tannin, and lectins was determined in five bean 
cultivars grown at five locations in Mexico. TI and tannins contents in colored 
beans that belong to the Jalisco race were higher (11.1-11.9 trypsin units 
inhibited (TUI)/mg and 29.0-38.1 mg catechin equivalent (CE)/g, respectively) 
than cultivars of the Durango race (7.9-8.3 TUI/mg and 16.8-19.9 CE/mg, 
respectively). Bayo Victoria, a Durango race cultivar, had three times more 
lectins than levels reported for soybean. Cultivar influenced TI and tannins 
contents (p < 0.001), whereas site affected lectins (p < 0.001). An increase in 
levels of TI and tannins could be enhanced through breeding.

A rapid HPLC-diode array detection (DAD) method was developed for the routine 
analysis of 16 anthocyanins in wine. Direct injection of filtered wine samples 
followed by selective detection at 520 nm allowed quantitation of these 
compounds in red wines. The method was linear for malvidin-3-glucoside over the 
range 5-250ppm, and the limit of detection for this compound was 0.18 ppm. A 
volatile mobile phase is used, which enables hyphenation to mass spectrometry 
(MS). With HPLC-MS, a total of 44 pigments could be identified in South African 
wines. Obtained mass spectra are discussed for a series of representative wine 
constituents and results are compared with literature references. An attempt was 
made to differentiate between different cultivars according to the anthocyanin 
content using stepwise forward linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

The effect of wild blueberry consumption on anthocyanin (ACNs) distribution and 
metabolism in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was investigated. Thirty-two rats were 
fed for 4 or 8 weeks with a control (C) or a wild blueberry-enriched diet (8%) 
(WB). Anthocyanin profile in plasma, urine, feces, brain, and liver was 
evaluated by LC-MS/MS, and significantly increased in urine and not in feces 
after 8 weeks on the WB diet compared to that in 4 weeks, but no anthocyanins 
were detected in plasma, liver, and brain samples either in the C or WB groups. 
Metabolites of ACNs were detected in the plasma, urine, feces, and tissues of 
both the C and WB groups, but the urinary excretion of hippuric acid increased 
significantly after 4 and 8 weeks of WB consumption. Thus, it seems that ACNs 
are metabolized by the intestinal microflora to respective phenyl-alkyl acids, 
which can be further metabolized to benzoic acid. In conclusion, ACNs are 
bioavailable in rats, and the extent of their metabolism and excretion is based 
on diet duration. Additionally, urinary hippuric acid content could represent a 
potential biomarker of ACNs absorption and metabolism in the SD rat under the 
present experimental conditions.

We describe a liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation tandem mass 
spectrometry method for the qualitative and quantitative determination of the 
secoiridoid oleuropein and its bioactive metabolite hydroxytyrosol in rat plasma 
and urine. Samples were prepared by liquid-liquid extraction using ethyl acetate 
with a recovery for both compounds of about 100% in plasma and about 60% in 
urine. The chromatographic separation was performed with a RP-ODS column using a 
water-acetonitrile linear gradient. The calibration curve was linear for both 
biophenols over the range 2.5-1000 ng/ml (LOD 1.25 ng/ml) for plasma and 5-1000 
ng/ml (LOD 2.5 ng/ml) for urine. Plasma concentrations of oleuropein and 
hydroxytyrosol were measured after oral administration of a single dose (100 
mg/kg) of oleuropein. Analysis of treated rat plasma showed the presence of 
unmodified oleuropein, reaching a peak value of 200 ng/ml within 2 h, with a 
small amount of hydroxytyrosol, whereas in urine, both compounds were mainly 
found as glucuronides.

The present work is devoted to studies of the radical scavenging properties of 
lignins, which are recognized as efficient antioxidants of natural origin. 
Radical scavenging efficiency of a series of lignins isolated from deciduous and 
coniferous wood species and 10 lignin related monomeric compounds were examined 
against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH*) radical in homogeneous conditions 
using ESR and spectrophotometry methods. Some structure-activity relationships 
are proposed, pointing out the importance of the non-etherified OH phenolic 
groups, ortho-methoxy groups, hydroxyl groups and the double bond between the 
outermost carbon atoms in the side chain for increasing scavenger activity. 
Analysis of rate constants for the lignins-DPPH* interaction revealed the 
contribution of polymer molecular weight and pi-polyconjugation systems. The 
pi-conjugation systems of lignins operate as catalysts/activators of the 
interaction with DPPH*. Heterogeneity in terms of component composition 
(carbohydrate admixtures) and polydispersity is the factor which can decrease 
drastically the antioxidant efficiency of isolated lignins. The connection of 
the antibacterial effect of kraft lignin with radical scavenging activity of its 
soluble fraction was assumed.

OBJECTIVE: Because consumption of teas may be associated with potential health 
benefits due to its content in polyphenols and in Western countries the 
consumption of tea is equally divided between the hot and the ready-to-drink 
(RTD) cold versions of this typical beverage, the aim of this work was to study 
the absorption and metabolism of flavan-3-ols in human volunteers after the 
ingestion of a commercial RTD tea.
METHODS: A feeding study was carried out in 20 healthy human volunteers and 
urine samples were collected for 24h after tea ingestion. Flavan-3-ols-derived 
molecules were identified and quantified in urine samples by high-performance 
liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection.
RESULTS: Eight relevant metabolites were identified in urine, all modified 
flavan-3-ols with the exception of unmetabolized gallic acid. The urinary 
excretion of flavan-3-ols was equal to 7.2% of the intake with tea. Gallic acid, 
which was abundant in the RTD tea used in this study, reached a 4.5% of the 
drunken amount.
CONCLUSIONS: The bioavailability values observed are in agreement with previous 
reports, although the dosage of polyphenols ingested in this study is remarkably 
lower. Moreover, the use of a group of 20 volunteers, more than the average 
number of subjects used for usual human acute-feeding studies involving 
polyphenols, provides additional credibility to the results. After drinking the 
RTD ice tea used in this study, the internal compartments are exposed to 
non-marginal doses of flavanols and flavanol metabolites up to 24h.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate green tea flavan-3-ol 
catabolism and plasma pharmacokinetic and urinary excretion by high-performance 
liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry to evaluate their absolute 
bioavailability by taking into account all known and some unknown catabolites 
deriving from their interaction with the gastrointestinal tract and its host 
microflora.
METHODS: A feeding study was carried out in 20 healthy human volunteers who 
ingested 400 mL of a ready-to-drink green tea containing approximately 400 μmol 
of flavan-3-ols. Urine and plasma were collected for 4 and 24h, respectively, 
and 39 relevant catabolites were identified in these biological fluids by tandem 
mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: In biological fluids, 39 relevant flavan-3-ol catabolites were 
identified. In plasma, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate was the only unmetabolized 
compound and the highest in absolute concentration compared with 
(-)-epigallocatechin and (-)-epicatechin conjugates. Colonic microflora-derived 
polyhydroxyphenyl-γ-valerolactones were by far the main urinary catabolites, 
averaging 10 times greater concentratin than flavan-3-ol conjugates. The 
calculated bioavailability was equal to 39% and it is interesting to notice the 
great variability in urinary excretion of colonic metabolites among 
participants, probably related to differences in their own colonic microflora.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that green tea catechins are more 
bioavailable than previously observed when colonic ring fission metabolites are 
taken into consideration. Regular consumption of ready-to-drink green tea 
containing flavan-3-ols allows a non-marginal exposure of the human body to 
these catabolites, somehow justifying the numerous beneficial actions described 
as linked to green tea intake.

harvested in Tenerife (Canary Islands). The free phenolic compounds found in the 
potato samples were (+)-catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric 
acid, and ferulic acid. Potato samples belonging to Colorada cultivar, ssp. 
andigena, had mean concentrations of total phenolic compounds and chlorogenic 
acid higher than those found for Kerr's Pink and Cara cultivars, ssp. tuberosum, 
and for Negra cultivar, S. x chaucha. In contrast, p-coumaric acid was not 
detected in any potato samples of the Colorada cultivar. Traditional potatoes 
presented a higher mean concentration of ferulic acid than recently imported 
potatoes. A significant and negative correlation was established between 
(+)-catechin and p-coumaric acid. A considerable contribution to the daily 
intake of flavonoids was observed with the actual consumption of potatoes.

In order to examine the vital reaction in wounds, catecholamines, serotonin 
(5-HT) and their metabolites in the incised skin wounds of guinea pigs were 
analyzed simultaneously by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using 
electrochemical detection (ECD). The principal changes in the levels of these 
compounds in vital wounds were as follows: a considerable decrease in 
norepinephrine (NE) content was observed 12-24 h after injury which persisted to 
at least 7 days. 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) decreased slightly for 
up to 30 min and then showed no significant difference compared with postmortem 
levels. Epinephrine and dopamine were barely detected by the HPLC-ECD method 
employed. 5-HT concentrations which showed an increase up to 24 h showed maximum 
levels 800 microns from the wound edge at 10 and 30 min after injury. 
5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) was significantly higher than the postmortem 
level over almost the entire period of these experiments. A 5-HIAA content of at 
least twice the postmortem level was observed 800 microns from the wound edge of 
a 10-min-old vital wound. Therefore, 5-HIAA is a likely candidate as a new 
marker for evaluating the vital reaction in wounds. The vital characteristics of 
NE, DOPAC, 5-HIAA and 5-HT in 10-min-old wounds persisted for up to 12 h at room 
temperature after death. These results suggest that the HPLC-ECD method used 
here is very useful for simultaneous examination of the vital reaction in wounds 
from the earliest to the later stages of the wound-healing period.

Processed fruits and vegetables have been long considered to have lower 
nutritional value than their fresh commodities due to the loss of vitamin C 
during processing. This research group found vitamin C in apples contributed < 
0.4% of total antioxidant activity, indicating most of the activity comes from 
the natural combination of phytochemicals. This suggests that processed fruits 
and vegetables may retain their antioxidant activity despite the loss of vitamin 
C. Here it is shown that thermal processing elevated total antioxidant activity 
and bioaccessible lycopene content in tomatoes and produced no significant 
changes in the total phenolics and total flavonoids content, although loss of 
vitamin C was observed. The raw tomato had 0.76 +/- 0.03 micromol of vitamin C/g 
of tomato. After 2, 15, and 30 min of heating at 88 degrees C, the vitamin C 
content significantly dropped to 0.68 +/- 0.02, 0.64 +/- 0.01, and 0.54 +/- 0.02 
micromol of vitamin C/g of tomato, respectively (p < 0.01). The raw tomato had 
2.01 +/- 0.04 mg of trans-lycopene/g of tomato. After 2, 15, and 30 min of 
heating at 88 degrees C, the trans-lycopene content had increased to 3.11+/- 
0.04, 5.45 +/- 0.02, and 5.32 +/- 0.05 mg of trans-lycopene/g of tomato (p < 
0.01). The antioxidant activity of raw tomatoes was 4.13 +/- 0.36 micromol of 
vitamin C equiv/g of tomato. With heat treatment at 88 degrees C for 2, 15, and 
30 min, the total antioxidant activity significantly increased to 5.29 +/- 0.26, 
5.53 +/- 0.24, and 6.70 +/- 0.25 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of tomato, 
respectively (p < 0.01). There were no significant changes in either total 
phenolics or total flavonoids. These findings indicate thermal processing 
enhanced the nutritional value of tomatoes by increasing the bioaccessible 
lycopene content and total antioxidant activity and are against the notion that 
processed fruits and vegetables have lower nutritional value than fresh produce. 
This information may have a significant impact on consumers' food selection by 
increasing their consumption of fruits and vegetables to reduce the risks of 
chronic diseases.

Sweet lupin Lupinus albus seed flour (SLSF), two sweet lupin protein isolates 
(SLPI-I and SLPI-II) and sweet lupin seed protein concentrate (SLSPC) were added 
to wheat flour (WF) in an amount of 3, 6, 9 and 12% of wheat flour. The effects 
of lupin products supplementation on physical dough properties were studied 
using a Brabender farinograph. Loaves were prepared from the various blends 
using the straight dough procedure and then evaluated for volume, crust and 
crumb colour, crumb texture, flavour and overall quality. Water absorption, 
development time and dough weakening were significantly (P < 0.05) increased as 
the lupin product levels increased in all doughs; however, dough stability 
decreased. Lupin products could be added to WF up to 9% level (SLPI-I and 
SLPI-II) and 6% level (for other lupin products), without any observed 
detrimental effect on bread sensory properties. No significant (P > 0.05) 
differences were recorded in loaf volume between control and breads containing 
SLPI-I and II (up to 9% level) and SLSPC (up to 3% level). Addition of lupin 
products increased the content of protein and total essential amino acids, 
especially lysine. The addition also improved in-vitro protein digestibility.

Dietary phenolic compounds, ubiquitous in vegetables and fruits and their juices 
possess antioxidant activity that may have beneficial effects on human health. 
The phenolic composition of six commercial apple juices, and of the peel (RP), 
flesh (RF) and whole fresh Red Delicious apples (RW), was determined by high 
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and total phenols were determined by 
the Folin-Ciocalteau method. HPLC analysis identified and quantified several 
classes of phenolic compounds: cinnamates, anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols and 
flavonols. Phloridzin and hydroxy methyl furfural were also identified. The 
profile of phenolic compounds varied among the juices. The range of 
concentrations as a percentage of total phenolic concentration was: hydroxy 
methyl furfural, 4-30%; phloridzin, 22-36%; cinnamates, 25-36%; anthocyanins, 
n.d.; flavan-3-ols, 8-27%; flavonols, 2-10%. The phenolic profile of the Red 
Delicious apple extracts differed from those of the juices. The range of 
concentrations of phenolic classes in fresh apple extracts was: hydroxy methyl 
furfural, n.d.; phloridzin, 11-17%; cinnamates, 3-27%; anthocyanins, n.d.-42%; 
flavan-3-ols, 31-54%; flavonols, 1-10%. The ability of compounds in apple juices 
and extracts from fresh apple to protect LDL was assessed using an in vitro 
copper catalyzed human LDL oxidation system. The extent of LDL oxidation was 
determined as hexanal production using static headspace gas chromatography. The 
apple juices and extracts, tested at 5 microM gallic acid equivalents (GAE), all 
inhibited LDL oxidation. The inhibition by the juices ranged from 9 to 34%, and 
inhibition by RF, RW and RP was 21, 34 and 38%, respectively. Regression 
analyses revealed no significant correlation between antioxidant activity and 
either total phenolic concentration or any specific class of phenolics. Although 
the specific components in the apple juices and extracts that contributed to 
antioxidant activity have yet to be identified, this study found that both fresh 
apple and commercial apple juices inhibited copper-catalyzed LDL oxidation. The 
in vitro antioxidant activity of apples support the inclusion of this fruit and 
its juice in a healthy human diet.

Common bean effects on health have been related to its dietary fiber content and 
other active compounds. This study assessed the content of flavonoids, 
coumestrol, phenolic acids, galactooligosaccharides, and phytic acid in wild and 
cultivated Mexican common bean seeds (raw and cooked) and that of flavonoids, 
coumestrol, and phenolic acids in germinated bean seeds. The presence of 
isoflavones in raw bean seeds was not confirmed by the UV spectra. Quercetin, 
kaempferol, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and vanillic 
acid mean contents were 10.9, 52.3, 10.1, 9.6, 5.4, and 18.2 microg/g, 
respectively; raffinose, stachyose, verbascose, and phytic acid mean contents 
were 8.5, 56.3, 5.5, and 11.5 mg/g, respectively, in raw seeds. All compounds 
were affected by autoclaving, and germination resulted in a de novo synthesis of 
flavonols, phytoestrogens, and phenolic acids. The impact on health of common 
bean seed is affected by dietary burden, specific compounds content, and 
processing. On the other hand, germinated bean seed or beans sprouts may be 
sources of antioxidants and phytoestrogens.

Six flavonoids have been isolated and identified in buckwheat grain. These are 
rutin, orientin, vitexin, quercetin, isovitexin, and isoorientin. Rutin and 
isovitexin are the only flavonoid components of buckwheat seeds while hulls 
contain all six identified compounds. The total flavonoid concentration in the 
seeds was 18.8 and in the hulls 74 mg/100 g of dry matter. Dehulling the grain 
by using different temperature regimes resulted in drastic reductions of the 
total flavonoid concentration in the grain (by 75% of the control) and smaller 
but significant (15-20%) reduction in the hulls.

In this work, a new CE method with diode array detection (DAD) was developed for 
the monitoring and quantitation of flavonoids in different beans treated and 
untreated with UV-B radiation. Flavonoid concentration was monitored in 
UV-B-treated and untreated sprouts of three common beans (Zolfino ecotype, cv. 
Verdone, cv. Lingua di Fuoco) and one soybean (cv. Pacific). After acid 
hydrolysis of extracts, the CE-DAD method provides reproducible quantitative 
determinations of daidzein, glycitein, genistein, and kaempferol at ppm level in 
these natural matrices within a relatively short time (less than 16 min). Total 
flavonoid content determined by CE-DAD was 159 +/- 8, 26 +/- 2, 13 +/- 1, and 
1.3 +/- 0.3 microg/g fresh weight for untreated sprouts of Pacific soybean, 
Verdone bean, Zolfino bean, and Lingua di Fuoco bean, respectively. UV-B 
treatment caused no significant quantitative effect on Pacific soybean sprouts, 
whereas it enhanced the total isoflavone content by 1.5, 1.8, and 3.2-fold in 
Verdone, Zolfino, and Lingua di Fuoco beans, respectively. The proposed method 
shows (i) the potentialities of bean sprouts as a natural source of bioactive 
compounds (antioxidants); (ii) the technological role of UV-B treatment for 
sprout isoflavone enrichment; and (iii) the good capabilities of CE-DAD to 
monitor this process.

Column liquid chromatography on a C18-bonded silica column with 
water-methanol-acetic acid as eluent was used to determine polyphenols and 
caffeine in tea. Without any pretreatment, catechin, epicatechin gallate, 
epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epicatechin and caffeine were 
separated successfully within 15 min. The detection limits (S/N = 3) of 
polyphenols studied were 1.8-24 mg/l at a detection wavelength 270 nm. The 
linear range of the peak area calibration curves for the analytes were over two 
orders of magnitude with a correlation coefficient of 0.996-0.999. Using this 
method, some Chinese tea samples were analyzed with a good reproducibility (RSD 
are below 5%).

Phenolic compounds in loquat fruit were identified as 5-caffeoylquinic acid 
(chlorogenic acid), neochlorogenic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, 5-p-feruloylquinic 
acid, protocatechuic acid, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, epicatechin, o-coumaric acid, 
ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid. Neochlorogenic acid was found to be dominant 
in the early stages of loquat fruit development. Both the concentrations and 
types of phenolic compounds were high in young fruit but then decreased steadily 
during growth. However, the concentration of chlorogenic acid increased during 
ripening and became predominant in ripe fruit. The large rise in chlorogenic 
acid concentration appears to be a characteristic of loquat fruit ripening. In 
all of the cultivars tested, the types of phenolic compounds were similar but 
the total phenolic content varied from 81.8 to 173.8 mg/100 g of fresh pulp. In 
the biosynthetic pathway of chlorogenic acid, the enzyme activities of 
phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (CL), and 
hydroxycinnamoyl CoA:quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (CQT) were high at the 
early stage of growth, diminished to low levels approximately 3 weeks prior to 
harvest, but then rose to a peak at 1 week before harvest. The changes of these 
enzyme activities seemed to be associated with variations in chlorogenic acid 
concentration during development, maturation, and ripening of loquat fruit.

Flavonoids are components of fruits, vegetables and wines. An abundance of 
flavonoids in the diet is correlated with reduced heart disease mortality, 
suggesting that they act as protective nutrients. However, little is known about 
the absorption and metabolism of flavonoids after normal foods are consumed. 
This study measured the levels of one abundant flavonoid, (+)-catechin, and its 
metabolites in plasma after five male and four female volunteers consumed 120 mL 
of red wine (RW) one day and de-alcoholized red wine (DRW) on a separate day. 
Each wine sample contained 35 +/- 1 mg catechin (mean +/- SEM). Plasma levels of 
catechin and its metabolite 3'-O-methylcatechin (3'MC) were determined by gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of the trimethylsilylated (TMS) 
derivatives. Glucuronide and sulfate conjugates were determined after enzymatic 
hydrolysis. Before RW or DRW consumption, plasma levels of catechin, 3'MC and 
all conjugates were <2 nmol/L. After 1 h, average levels of catechin, 3'MC and 
all conjugates increased to 91 +/- 14 nmol/L (RW) and 81 +/- 11 nmol/L (DRW). At 
1 h, 21 +/- 1% of the metabolites were methylated and <2% of catechin and 3'MC 
were unconjugated. Catechin was present as both a sulfate conjugate and a 
conjugate containing both glucuronide and sulfate residues. 3'MC was present 
primarily as a glucuronide conjugate. At every time point, catechin was present 
almost exclusively as metabolites, and these levels were independent of ethanol. 
Therefore, if flavonoids are protective nutrients, the active forms are likely 
to be metabolites, which are far more abundant in plasma than the forms that 
exist in foods.

The possibility of proving the undeclared addition of pumpkin puree in apricot 
nectars and jams has been investigated by using the phenol compound fingerprint 
and sensory evaluation. The cheaper pumpkin admixtures in apricot nectars and 
jams could not be detected by the sensory evaluation, particularly if present in 
quantities of <15%. The lower admixtures of pumpkin puree in apricot nectars and 
jams could be detected by the presence of syringic acid, a phenolic compound 
characteristic of the investigated pumpkins (Cucurbita pepo cv. Gleisdorff and 
Table Gold, Cucurbita maxima cv. Turkinja, and Cucurbita moschata cv. Argenta). 
Syringic acid was isolated from pumpkin puree and determined by using HPLC with 
diode array detection. By using the phenolic profile, undeclared pumpkin 
admixture (> or =5%) in the apricot nectars and jams could be proven.

Lentils (Lens culinaris L.) are a popular food in many countries. However, 
little is known about their phenolic composition. Because polyphenols in lentils 
are located essentially in their seed coat, the objective of this work was to 
study the composition of proanthocyanidins, the major group of polyphenols, in 
this part of the tissue. The use of C(18) Sep-Pak cartridges permitted the 
fractionation of lentil seed coat extract into monomer, oligomer, and polymer 
proanthocyanidin fractions. Subsequent thiolysis of oligomer and polymer 
fractions followed by HPLC analysis allowed the mean degree of polymerization 
(mDP) and the structural composition of proanthocyanidins to be determined. A 
fractionation of lentil seed coat extracts on a polyamide column followed by 
HPLC and HPLC-DAD-MS analyses was used to identify the individual 
proanthocyanidins. The results showed that the major monomeric flavan-3-ol was 
(+) catechin-3-glucose, with lesser amounts of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin. 
In the oligomer fraction, various dimer, trimer, and tetramer proanthocyanidins 
constituted of catechin, gallocatechin, and catechin gallate units were 
identified, and several procyanidins and prodelphinidins from pentamers to 
nonamers constitute the polymer fraction. The most abundant proanthocyanidins in 
the seed coat of lentils are the polymers (65-75%), with a mDP of 7-9, followed 
by the oligomers (20-30%), with a mDP of 4-5.

Anthocyanins and derived components of red wines were determined by microHPLC 
using a 1 mm ID HPLC column coupled on-line with an MS detector equipped with an 
ESI (ElectroSpray Ionisation) source. The use of microcolumn HPLC greatly 
enhanced detection performance, allowing direct identification of components 
present in the fraction. Nineteen anthocyanins were detected. Fifteen were 
identified, two were tentatively identified, and only the aglycon of the 
remaining two components was certainly identified. Six anthocyanin-derived 
pigments, supposedly formed during wine maturation, were also investigated and 
found in a wine sample. The analysis of red wine anthocyanins was also carried 
out by injecting a large sample volume onto a 0.32 mm ID HPLC column, using the 
column focusing technique, in order to decrease the limit of detection and 
quantification of components present in a very small amounts.

Four high yielding and early maturing cultivars of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) 
namely UPAS-120, ICPL-87, ICPL-151 and, especially, Manak, contained significant 
amounts of polyphenols (1075 to 1328 mg/100g), which may limit their 
utilization. The effectiveness of soaking (6, 12 and 18 h, 30 degrees C), 
soaking and dehulling, ordinary cooking, pressure cooking and germination (24, 
36, 48 h, 30 degrees C) in reducing the levels of polyphenols was investigated. 
A decrease in the polyphenolic contents varying from 4 to 26 percent in 
different pigeon pea cultivar was achieved. Pressure cooking of soaked-dehulled 
seeds was found to be the most effective method, followed by sprouting for 48 h, 
ordinary cooking of soaked-dehulled seeds, and pressure cooking of soaked whole 
seeds followed by sprouting for 36 h.

Eight varieties of lettuce (Lactuca sativum) and three varieties of endive 
(Cichorium endivia) were analyzed for flavonoid composition and content. Total 
flavonoid contents, expressed as units of aglycon for fresh material, were in 
the ranges of 0.3-229 microg/g for lettuce and 44-248 microg/g for endive. Five 
quercetin conjugates [quercetin 3-O-galactoside, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, 
quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, quercetin 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside, and quercetin 
3-O-rhamnoside] and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide were measured in the green-leafed 
lettuce and an additional two cyanidin conjugates [cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and 
cyanidin 3-O-[(6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] in the red-leafed varieties. Three 
kaempferol conjugates [kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-glucuronide, and 
kaempferol 3-O-[6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] were measured in each of the endive 
varieties. The presence and identity of kaempferol 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside in 
endive was shown for the first time. Shredding of lettuce leaf followed by 
exposure to light produced significant losses of the flavonoid moiety in the 
green oak leaf (94%), red oak leaf (43%), iceberg (36%), green batavia (25%), 
lollo biondo (24%), and lollo rosso (6%) samples, whereas cos and green salad 
bowl samples did not show an overall loss. Shredding of endive also produced 
loss of the flavonoid moiety in escarole (32%), fine frisee (13%), and coarse 
frisee (8%). Significant demalonation was observed for both the quercetin and 
cyanidin glucosides in lettuce, whereas a similar degradation of the kaempferol 
analogue was found in endive tissue. Storage of whole heads of both lettuce and 
endive in the dark at 1 degrees C and 98% humidity for 7 days resulted in losses 
of total flavonol glycosides in the range of 7-46%. The identification of the 
amounts, position of substitution, and nature of the sugars is important for 
understanding the potential bioavailability and biological activities of 
flavonoids in salads.

We determined the uptake and excretion of low doses of polyphenols in six 
subjects who each consumed 1.1 L of an alcoholic cider beverage. Over a 24-h 
period, no phloretin was detected in plasma (detection limit = 0.036 
micromol/L), but 21 +/- 5% of the dose (4.8 mg) was excreted in the urine. In 
contrast, from a low dose of 1.6-mg quercetin equivalents, no quercetin was 
found in urine or plasma, but 3'-methyl quercetin was detected in plasma [C(max) 
(maximum concentration) = 0.14 +/- 0.19 micromol/L; range: 0 to 0.44 
micromol/L]. No flavanol monomers (dose of free (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin 
= 3.5 mg) were detected in urine or plasma (detection limit: 0.01 micromol/L). 
Caffeic acid (total dose including esters = 11 mg) was detected only in plasma 
within 2 h, with C(max) = 0.43 +/- 0.3 micromol/L (range: 0.18 to 0.84 
micromol/L). An almost 3-fold increase in hippuric acid was detected in 24-h 
urine (74 +/- 29 micromol/L; range: 38-116 micromol/L), compared with a prestudy 
value of 19 +/- 9 micromol/L. These data show that polyphenols are taken up from 
cider, that phloretin is excreted in the urine and suggest that low doses of 
quercetin are extensively methylated in humans.

Berries are known to contain phenolic substances (i.e., flavonoids and phenolic 
acids), which comprise two large and heterogeneous groups of biologically active 
nonnutrients. This investigation evaluated the content and profile of the 
phenolic compounds present in six different berries found in Northern Europe. 
The latter included bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), cowberry (Vaccinium 
vitis-idaea), cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccus), strawberry (Fragaria ananassa), 
black currant (Ribes nigrum), and red currant (Ribes rubrum). The study was 
focused on two areas. The first involved the extraction and analysis of berries 
for total phenolic content and determination of their antioxidant activity. The 
total phenolic level of berries was correlated with their antioxidant activity. 
Second, the berry extracts were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis to 
determine the content and profile of selected bioactive compounds. The analytes 
of interest included trans-resveratrol, cinnamic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric 
acid, quercetin, and morin.

Antioxidant capacity, as measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), 
and total phenolic and total anthocyanin contents were evaluated in fruit 
tissues of 87 highbush blueberry (Vacciniumcorymbosum L.) and 
species-introgressed highbush blueberry cultivars. ORAC and phenolic levels were 
evaluated in leaf tissues of the same materials. Average values for ORAC, 
phenolics, and anthocyanins in fruit were 15.9 ORAC units, 1.79 mg/g (gallic 
acid equivalents), and 0.95 mg/g (cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents), 
respectively. Cv. Rubel had the highest ORAC per gram of fresh weight values, at 
31.1 units, and cv. Elliott had the highest values on the basis of ORAC per 
square centimeter of surface area. In leaf tissue, values for both ORAC and 
phenolics were significantly higher than in fruit tissue, with mean values of 
490 ORAC units and 44.80 mg/g (gallic acid equivalents), respectively. Leaf ORAC 
had a low, but significant, correlation with fruit phenolics and anthocyanins, 
but not with fruit ORAC. An analysis of ORAC values versus calculated midparent 
values in 11 plants from the 87-cultivar group in which all parents were tested 
suggested that, across cultivars, ORAC inheritance is additive. An investigation 
of ORAC values in a family of 44 cv. Rubel x Duke seedlings showed negative 
epistasis for ORAC values, suggesting Rubel may have gene combinations 
contributing to ORAC that are broken up during hybridization.

Citrus flavonoids have been investigated for their biological activity, with 
both anti-inflammatory and -carcinogenic effects being reported. However, little 
information is known on the bioavailability of these compounds in vivo. The 
objectives of this study were to determine the tissue distribution of naringenin 
after gastric gavage of [3H]-naringenin to rats. Unlabelled naringenin was also 
used to quantify the levels of naringenin and its major metabolites in tissues 
and eliminated in the urine and faeces. Significant radioactivity was detected 
in the plasma as well as all tissues examined 2h post-gavage. After 18h, higher 
levels of radioactivity were retained in plasma and tissues (55% of the 
administered radioactivity). Investigation of the nature of metabolites, using 
unlabelled naringenin, revealed that the glucuronides were the major components 
in plasma, tissues and urine, in addition to the colonic metabolite 
3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid, detected in the urine. The aglycone was the 
form extensively retained in tissues after 18h post-gavage. Total identified 
metabolites detected after 18h in most tissues were only 1-5% of the levels 
detected after 2h. However, the brain, lungs and heart retained 27, 20 and 11%, 
respectively, relative to the total metabolites detected at 2h. While 
radioactive detection suggests increased levels of breakdown products of 
naringenin after 18 h versus 2 h, the products identified using unlabelled 
naringenin are not consistent with this, suggesting that a predominant 
proportion of the naringenin breakdown products at 18 h are retained as smaller 
decomposition molecules which cannot yet be identified.

The effects of cooking treatments (boiling, autoclaving and microwave cooking) 
and germination on the nutritional composition and antinutritional factors of 
chickpeas were studied. Cooking treatments and/or germination caused significant 
(p < 0.05) decreases in fat, total ash, carbohydrate fractions, antinutritional 
factors, minerals and B-vitamins. Germination was less effective than cooking 
treatments in reducing trypsin inhibitor, hemagglutinin activity, tannins and 
saponins; it was more effective in reducing phytic acid, stachyose and 
raffinose. Cooking treatments and germination decreased the concentrations of 
lysine, tryptophan, total aromatic and sulfur-containing amino acids. However, 
cooked and germinated chickpeas were still higher in lysine, isoleucine and 
total aromatic amino acid contents than the FAO/WHO reference. The losses in 
B-vitamins and minerals in chickpeas cooked by microwaving were smaller than in 
those cooked by boiling and autoclaving. Germination resulted in greater 
retention of all minerals and B-vitamins compared to cooking treatments. In 
vitro protein digestibility, protein efficiency ratio and essential amino acid 
index were improved by all treatments. The chemical score and limiting amino 
acid of chickpeas subjected to the various treatments varied considerably, 
depending on the type of treatment. Based on these results, microwave cooking 
appears to be the best alternative for legume preparation in households and 
restaurants.

A HPLC method was developed for the analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside 
(SDG) and hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in milled defatted flaxseed flour. 
Direct extraction by 1 M NaOH for 1 h at 20 degrees C resulted in a higher yield 
than that obtained by hydrolysis of alcoholic extracts. An internal standard, 
o-coumaric acid, was used and the method was found to be easy, fast, and with 
good repeatability. On dry matter basis, different samples of flaxseeds varied 
considerably in their content of (+)-SDG (11.9-25.9 mg/g), (-)-SDG (2.2-5.0 
mg/g), p-coumaric acid glucoside (1.2-8.5 mg/g), and ferulic acid glucoside 
(1.6-5.0 mg/g).

Creatine, creatinine and carnosine have been analyzed by hydrophilic interaction 
chromatography (HILIC) in seven different pork muscles of different metabolic 
type (Semimembranosus, Biceps femoris, Gluteus maximus, Longissimus dorsi, 
Gluteus medius, Trapezius and Masseter). As reported in previous literature, 
carnosine contents are related with the type of metabolism, being higher in 
those muscles with glycolytic metabolism. Creatine and creatinine also showed 
significantly higher concentrations in glycolytic muscles such as 
Semimembranosus, Biceps femoris, Gluteus maximus and Longissimus dorsi. 
Masseter, a red oxidative muscle, was characterized by the lowest contents of 
creatine, creatinine and carnosine and, finally, Gluteus medius and Trapezius, 
both intermediate muscles, had also intermediate contents of these studied 
compounds. Finally, a correlation between initial content of creatine and 
creatinine formation after cooking has been verified using pure standards and 
two different metabolic type muscles, Longissimus dorsi and Masseter, obtaining 
slightly higher creatinine amounts in Longissimus dorsi, probably due to its 
higher initial creatine content and its lower pH.

Oat milling fractions were examined for concentrations of total phenolics, 
tocols, and phenolic acids and in vitro antioxidant activity to determine their 
potential as dietary antioxidants. Methanolic extracts of pearling fractions, 
flour and aspirations from flaking, and trichomes had high, intermediate, and 
low antioxidant activities, respectively, evaluated by the beta-carotene 
bleaching method. Pearling fractions were also highest in total phenolics and 
tocols. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, vanillin, p-coumaric 
acid, and ferulic acid were identified and quantified by HPLC. Three 
avenanthramides and an unidentified ferulate derivative were also detected. 
Total phenolic content was significantly correlated with antioxidant activity, 
and regression equations that predicted antioxidant activity from phenolic and 
tocol concentrations were calculated. Antioxidant activity, evaluated by 
beta-carotene bleaching, was correlated with measures of oxygen radical 
absorbance capacity and low-density lipoprotein oxidation. These data indicate a 
potential for oat products, especially those enriched in outer layers of the 
groat, to contribute to dietary intakes of antioxidant phytonutrients.

The polyphenolic composition of 62 wild and weedy Mexican bean collections from 
diverse origins, grouped by their seed coat color, was assessed. According to 
spectrophotometric analysis, the range of total phenols, condensed tannins, and 
total anthocyanins presented wide differences. Furthermore, the phenolic acid, 
flavonoid, and anthocyanin profiles were analyzed using HPLC. Ferulic was the 
main phenolic acid. Kaempferol and quercetin were the main flavonoids, and the 
isoflavones daidzein and coumestrol were found in only low levels in few 
collections. Delphinidin was the main anthocyanidin found, followed by 
petunidin, cyanidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, and peonidin. The wide variation 
observed in polyphenolic contents was more related to their genotype than to the 
color factor. These results show that some wild and weedy beans are good sources 
of phenolic compounds for use in breeding programs focused on nutrition and 
health.

Isoflavone phytoestrogens found in soybeans are the most widely studied 
phytochemicals in human diets and soy infant formulas. The health benefits of 
the isoflavones daidzein and genistein have been reported, and concerns about 
potential adverse effects have also been raised. However, the results of direct 
analysis of isoflavones and their metabolites in biological fluids after 
consumption of soy-containing diets are scarce. This study describes an LC/MS/MS 
method for the analysis of isoflavones and their metabolites in the urine of 
female rats fed diets made with soy protein isolate. Five isoflavones (daidzein, 
genistein, glycitein, dihydrodaidzein, and O-desmethylangolensin) were 
identified by comparison with authentic standards. Seventeen conjugates of 
isoflavones were characterized in the urine, the most unusual being genistein 
5-glucuronide and four glucuronide conjugates of reductive metabolites of 
daidzein. The application of LC/MS/MS to analyze isoflavone metabolites is 
simple and sensitive, and appears to be an excellent method for determining the 
bioavailability and metabolism of food phytochemistry.

Naringin is a flavonoid that exists in many plants and traditional Chinese 
medicines. In this study, a highly sensitive and specific electrospray 
ionization (ESI) liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) 
method was developed for quantification of naringin and its two metabolites, 
naringenin and naringenin glucuronide. Naringin and naringenin were extracted 
from rat plasma with ethyl acetate, using hesperidin as an internal standard. 
Components in the extract were separated on a 100 mm x 2.0 mm Betabasic 5 microm 
C18 ODS column by isocratic elution with 70% methanol. The components were 
analyzed in the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode in the precursor/product 
ion pair of m/z 581.3/273.4 for naringin, m/z 273.4/153.1 for naringenin and m/z 
611.5/303.4 for hesperidin, respectively. Linear calibration curves were 
obtained in the range of 5-1000 ng/ml, using 0.1 ml rat plasma. The within-day 
coefficients of variation (CVs) were 3.1, 1.8 and 2.2% for naringin, 3.0, 3.3, 
3.1% for naringenin at 5, 50 and 500 ng/ml (n=5). The between-day CVs were 3.4, 
1.7 and 4.9% for naringin and 4.0, 3.0, 4.6% for naringenin (n=5) at 5, 50 and 
500 ng/ml respectively. A formulation based on PEG400 was used and orally 
administered to Sprague-Dawley male rats. Plasma drug concentrations were 
measured by this method and the pharmacokinetics was analyzed by WinNonlin 
computer software. Plasma concentration-time profiles of naringin were found to 
increase quickly and decline rapidly within 2 h and could not be detected after 
24 h. Naringenin and naringenin glucuronide occurred slower and the T(max) were 
about 9 and 7.5 h later, respectively.

The market for decaffeinated coffees has been increasingly expanding over the 
years. Caffeine extraction may result in losses of other compounds such as 
chlorogenic acids (CGA) and, consequently, their 1,5-gamma-quinolactones (CGL) 
in roasted coffee. These phenolic compounds are important for flavor formation 
as well as the health effects of coffee; therefore, losses due to decaffeination 
need to be investigated. The present study evaluates the impact of 
decaffeination processing on CGA and CGL levels of green and roasted arabica 
coffees. Decaffeination produced a 16% average increase in the levels of total 
CGA in green coffee (dry matter), along with a 237% increase in CGL direct 
precursors. Different degrees of roasting showed average increments of 5.5-18% 
in CGL levels of decaffeinated coffee, compared to regular, a change more 
consistent with observed levels of total CGA than with those of CGL direct 
precursors in green samples. On the other hand, CGA levels in roasted coffee 
were 3-9% lower in decaffeinated coffee compared to regular coffee. Although 
differences in CGA and CGL contents of regular and decaffeinated roasted coffees 
appear to be relatively small, they may be enough to affect flavor 
characteristics as well as the biopharmacological properties of the final 
beverage, suggesting the need for further study.

Unbalanced diets generate oxidative stress commonly associated with the 
development of diabetes, atherosclerosis, obesity and cancer. Dietary flavonoids 
have antioxidant properties and may limit this stress and reduce the risk of 
these diseases. We used a metabolomic approach to study the influence of 
catechin, a common flavonoid naturally occurring in various fruits, wine or 
chocolate, on the metabolic changes induced by hyperlipidemic diets. Male Wistar 
rats ( n = 8/group) were fed during 6 weeks normolipidemic (5% w/w) or 
hyperlipidemic (15 and 25%) diets with or without catechin supplementation (0.2% 
w/w). Urines were collected at days 17 and 38 and analyzed by reverse-phase 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF). Hyperlipidic diets led to a 
significant increase of oxidative stress in liver and aorta, upon which catechin 
had no effect. Multivariate analyses (PCA and PLS-DA) of the urine fingerprints 
allowed discrimination of the different diets. Variables were then classified 
according to their dependence on lipid and catechin intake (ANOVA). Nine 
variables were identified as catechin metabolites of tissular or microbial 
origin. Around 1000 variables were significantly affected by the lipid content 
of the diet, and 76 were fully reversed by catechin supplementation. Four 
variables showing an increase in urinary excretion in rats fed the high-fat 
diets were identified as deoxycytidine, nicotinic acid, dihydroxyquinoline and 
pipecolinic acid. After catechin supplementation, the excretion of nicotinic 
acid was fully restored to the level found in the rats fed the low-fat diet. The 
physiological significance of these metabolic changes is discussed.

Foods of plant origin contain a large number of phytochemicals that may 
positively affect health. Phytochemicals are largely excreted in urine as 
metabolites that are formed in host tissues or by the microbiota and constitute 
a great proportion of the urinary metabolome. The latter can be characterized by 
a metabolomics approach. In this work, we compared the metabolism of lignins to 
that of the structurally related ferulic acid (FA) and sinapic acid (SA). Five 
groups of rats (n = 5) were fed for 2 d a purified diet alone [control (C)] or 
supplemented with lignin-enriched wheat bran (3% of the diet, wt:wt), poplar 
wood lignins (0.42%), FA (0.42%), or SA (0.42%). The metabolomes of urine 
samples collected after 1 and 2 d of supplementation were analyzed by 
high-resolution MS (liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight). Comparing 
metabolic fingerprints by gathering semiquantitative information on several 
hundreds of metabolites and using multivariate statistical analysis (partial 
least squares for discriminant analysis) showed the similarity between both 
lignin-supplemented and C groups and confirmed that lignins are largely inert 
and not absorbed in the body. One the other hand, metabolic fingerprints of the 
2 phenolic acid-supplemented groups were clearly distinct from the C group. 
Differences between the groups were mainly from nonmetabolized FA and SA and 
metabolites excreted in urine. Thirteen of them were identified as sulfate 
esters and glucuronide and glycine conjugates of the same phenolic acids, and of 
dihydrosinapic, vanillic, and benzoic acids. This study shows that metabolomics 
allows the identification of new metabolites of phytochemicals and can be used 
to distinguish individuals fed different phytochemical-containing foods.

Anthocyanins are phenolic compounds widely distributed in fruits and vegetables. 
Their consumption has been shown to prevent some chronic diseases. Anthocyanin 
metabolism, however, is still not fully understood. The aim of this work was to 
evaluate the bioavailability of anthocyanins in humans consuming a meal 
containing strawberries and to identify possible metabolites in urine. Six 
healthy volunteers (three women and three men) consumed a meal containing 200 g 
strawberries (providing 179 micro mol pelargonidin-3-glucoside). Urine samples 
were collected before and after the meal and rapidly treated by solid-phase 
extraction. Identification and quantification of anthocyanin metabolites were 
carried out by HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC with UV-visible detection, respectively. 
In addition to pelargonidin-3-glucoside, five anthocyanin metabolites were 
identified in urine: three monoglucuronides of pelargonidin, one sulfoconjugate 
of pelargonidin and pelargonidin itself. Total urinary excretion of strawberry 
anthocyanin metabolites corresponded to 1.80 +/- 0.29% (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) of 
pelargonidin-3-glucoside ingested. More than 80% of this excretion was related 
to a monoglucuronide. Four hours after the meal, more than two-thirds of 
anthocyanin metabolites had been excreted, although urinary excretion of the 
metabolites continued until the end of the 24-h experiment. This study 
demonstrated that anthocyanins were glucuro- and sulfo-conjugated in humans and 
that the main metabolite of strawberry anthocyanins in human urine was a 
monoglucuronide of pelargonidin.

The consumption of anthocyanins has been shown to prevent certain chronic 
diseases. However, anthocyanin metabolism has not yet been fully elucidated. The 
aim of this study was to evaluate anthocyanin urinary excretion in humans 
receiving a meal containing blackberries and to identify possible metabolites in 
urine. Five healthy volunteers were fed 200 g of blackberries (960 mumol of 
anthocyanins). Urine samples were collected and rapidly treated by solid-phase 
extraction. Anthocyanin metabolites were identified and quantified by 
HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC with UV-vis detection, respectively. In addition to 
native cyanidin 3-glucoside, several other anthocyanin metabolites were 
identified in the urine: methylated glycosides, glucuronides of anthocyanidins 
and anthocyanins, a sulfoconjugate of cyanidin, and anthocyanidins. Total 
urinary excretion of blackberry anthocyanin metabolites was 0.160 +/- 0.020% (n 
= 5) of the amount of anthocyanins ingested. Monoglucuronides of anthocyanidins 
represented >60% of this excretion. Urinary excretion of anthocyanins was 
maximal between 2 and 4 h after the meal, but continued during the 24 h of the 
experiment. This study highlighted the influence of aglycon structure on 
anthocyanin urinary excretion. It demonstrated that anthocyanins are not only 
methylated but also glucuroconjugated and sulfoconjugated in humans and that the 
main metabolites of blackberry anthocyanins in human urine were anthocyanidin 
monoglucuronides.

Anthocyanins are natural pigments that could be involved in various health 
effects. Red oranges are an important dietary source of anthocyanins, including 
cyanidin 3-glucoside (Cy 3-glc) and an acylated derivative, cyanidin 
3-(6''-malonyl)-glucoside (Cy 3-malglc). The aim of this study was to evaluate 
the absorption and metabolism of red orange anthocyanins in rats fed an 
anthocyanin-enriched diet for 12 d (approximately 2.8 micromol anthocyanins/d). 
Furthermore, the absorption of these anthocyanins was studied in both the 
stomach and intestine using in situ models in rats. Anthocyanin metabolites were 
identified and quantified by HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem MS and 
HPLC-diode array detection, respectively. The red orange anthocyanins, Cy 3-glc 
and Cy 3-malglc, as well as their respective methylated derivatives, were 
recovered in urine after red orange juice intake. The 24 h urinary excretion of 
total anthocyanins was low (0.081 (SEM 0.009) % of the ingested amount). 
However, a high proportion (about 20 %) of red orange anthocyanins was absorbed 
from the stomach. More Cy 3-malglc than Cy 3-glc was absorbed in the intestine. 
This study thus indicated that red orange juice anthocyanins were rapidly 
absorbed from both stomach and small intestine, and then excreted in the urine 
as intact and methylated forms. Moreover, the absorption and metabolism of 
acylated anthocyanins and non-acylated anthocyanins were similar.

Anthocyanins are natural dietary pigments that could be involved in various 
health effects. However their mechanisms of absorption are still not fully 
understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of glucose on 
anthocyanin absorption in rats. We first studied anthocyanin bioavailability in 
rats that received by gastric intubation approximately 53 micromol cyanidin 
3-glucoside (Cy 3-glc) equivalents from a red orange extract with or without 
2.51 mmol glucose. Neither 24-h urinary anthocyanin excretion nor plasma 
anthocyanin concentration was significantly affected by simultaneous ingestion 
of glucose. The influence of glucose (12, 42 or 72 mM) on intestinal absorption 
of Cy 3-glc (pure or from a red orange extract; approximately 12.3 microM) was 
further studied using an in situ intestinal perfusion model. Absorption of pure 
Cy 3-glc from the intestinal lumen was not significantly affected by the amount 
of glucose. However, intestinal absorption of Cy 3-glc from the red orange 
extract (6.49 +/- 1.44%, n = 6) was significantly less than that of pure Cy 
3-glc (17.5 +/- 1.3%, n = 7) (p < 0.01) suggesting that the red orange extract 
contained other components that were able to interfere with Cy 3-glc intestinal 
absorption. This study has thus shown that glucose did not interfere with 
anthocyanin glucoside absorption.

Anthocyanins are natural dietary pigments that could be involved in various 
health effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of 
anthocyanins to various organs (bladder, prostate, testes, heart and adipose 
tissue) in rats fed with a blackberry anthocyanin-enriched diet for 12 days. 
Identification and quantification of anthocyanins were carried out by HPLC-DAD. 
The urinary excretion of total anthocyanins (native anthocyanins and their 
metabolites) was low (0.20 +/- 0.03%, n = 8). Proportions of anthocyanin 
derivatives (methylated anthocyanins and glucurono-conjugated derivatives) 
differed according to the organ considered. The bladder contained the highest 
levels of anthocyanins followed by the prostate. Prostate, testes and heart 
contained native cyanidin 3-glucoside and a small proportion of cyanidin 
monoglucuronide. Cyanidin 3-glucoside and methylated derivatives were present in 
adipose tissue. Thus, anthocyanin feeding in rats resulted in a wide 
distribution of anthocyanin derivatives to several organs. Identification of 
target tissues of anthocyanins may then help to understand the mechanisms of 
action of anthocyanins in vivo.

In this study, the effects of three common cooking practices (i.e., boiling, 
steaming, and frying) on the artichoke phenolic compounds pattern were evaluated 
by LC-MS/MS analysis. The variation of carotenoids, antioxidant capacity, and 
artichoke physical properties after cooking was also investigated. The major 
phenolic compounds present in the raw sample were 5- O-caffeoylquinic and 
1,5-di- O-caffeoylquinic acids; after cooking treatments, an increase of the 
overall caffeoylquinic acids concentration due to the formation of different 
dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers was observed. Steamed and fried samples showed 
similar patterns of dicaffeoylquinic concentrations, which were higher with 
respect to the boiled samples. On the other hand, all cooking practices, 
particularly frying, decreased flavonoid concentration. The antioxidant capacity 
of cooked artichokes, measured by three different assays, enormously increased 
after cooking, particularly after steaming (up to 15-fold) and boiling (up to 
8-fold). The observed cooking effect on the artichoke antioxidant profile is 
probably due to matrix softening and increased extractability of compounds, but 
the increase of antioxidant capacity is much higher than the increase of 
antioxidant concentration. These results suggest that some common cooking 
treatments can be used to enhance the nutritional value of vegetables, 
increasing bioaccessibility of health-promoting constituents.

A phytochemical study was undertaken on tronchuda cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. 
var. costata DC) cultivated under conventional and organic practices and 
collected at different times. Six organic acids (aconitic, citric, ascorbic, 
malic, shikimic, and fumaric acids) were identified and quantified by HPLC-UV. 
Qualitative and quantitative differences were noted between internal and 
external leaves. Analysis of the phenolics of the internal leaves was achieved 
by HPLC-DAD, and the phenolic profile obtained was revealed to be distinct from 
that of the external leaves. By this means were identified and quantified 11 
compounds: 3-p-coumaroylquinic acid, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, 
kaempferol 3-O-(caffeoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol

1,2,2'-trisinapoylgentiobiose, and 1,2'-disinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose. In 
general, internal leaves exhibited more constant chemical profiles.

The present study explored the bioavailability and brain deposition of a grape 
seed polyphenolic extract (GSPE) previously found to attenuate cognitive 
deterioration in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma 
pharmacokinetic response of major GSPE phenolic components was measured 
following intragastric gavage of 50, 100, and 150 mg GSPE per kg body weight. 
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis identified gallic acid 
(GA), catechin (C), and epicatechin (EC) in plasma of rats gavaged acutely with 
GSPE. Additionally, 4-methylgallic acid (4-OMeGA), 3'-methylcatechin (3'-OMeC), 
and 3'-methylepicatechin (3'-OMeEC) were identified as circulating metabolites 
of GSPE phenolic constituents. Cmax for individual GSPE constituents and their 
metabolites increased in a dose-dependent fashion (with increasing GSPE oral 
dose). Repeated daily exposure to GSPE was found to significantly increase 
bioavailability (defined as plasma AUC0-8h) of GA, C, and EC by 198, 253, and 
282% relative to animals receiving only a single acute GSPE dose. EC and C were 
not detectable in brain tissues of rats receiving a single GSPE dose but reached 
levels of 290.7 +/-45.9 and 576.7 +/- 227.7 pg/g in brain tissues from rats 
administered GSPE for 10 days. This study suggests that brain deposition of GA, 
C, and EC is affected by repeated dosing of GSPE.

The simultaneous determination of 19 phenolic compounds was performed directly 
in wort and beer by a combination of reverse-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography coupled with coulometric array detection. Chromatographic 
separation was achieved with an appropriate gradient of flow and a binary 
solvent based on phosphate buffer, methanol, and acetonitrile in a 45-min run. 
Eight serial coulometric detectors were used for on-line generation of 
voltammetric data to resolve coeluting compounds. The method was reliable and 
sensitive, the regression coefficient of standard calibration curves is 0.972 < 
or = r < or = 1.000, and the standard deviation value ranges from 0.010 to 0.129 
mg/L for wort and from 0.002 to 0.332 mg/L for beer. The mean concentrations of 
phenolic acids were 22.1 and 33.8 mg/L, respectively, in worts and beers 
produced in Italy. These amounts represent 5 and 10% of the non-tannic, 
non-flavonoid phenols in wort and beer, respectively.

In vitro studies show that some individual minor polar phenolic compounds (MPC) 
present in virgin olive oil prevent oxidation of human low-density lipoproteins 
(LDL), but few data are available on the antioxidant effect of whole oil 
extract. Thus, whole virgin olive extracts were studied to determine whether 
they maintain the antioxidant activity and whether this last is linked to MPC 
composition of a single virgin oil. Using HPLC-DAD the MPC content in Taggiasca 
and Seggianese virgin olive oils was measured. Taggiasca oil was less rich in 
total MPC (208.5 mg/L) than Seggianese oil (441.9 mg/L). In addition, the major 
compounds of Taggiasca oil were lignan derivatives, whereas the major compounds 
in Seggianese oils were secoiridoid derivatives. Moreover, Taggiasca oil was 
practically free of 5-hydroxytyrosol and 5-hydroxytyrosol derivatives, 
deacetoxy-oleuropein aglycone and oleuropein aglycone. The antioxidant activity 
of the oils on human LDL was evaluated by measuring malondialdehyde and 
conjugate diene generation induced by copper ions. In both tests, the oil 
extracts dose-dependently reduced malondialdehyde and conjugate diene 
generation. Moreover, antioxidant potency correlated with total MPC; thus, 
Seggianese extract was more active. The two oils differed quantitatively and 
qualitatively, and these differences influenced their biological activities; 
thus clinical trials focused on studying the effects of olive oils should 
specify the oils used.

A fast, precise and selective diode array HPLC method is presented for the 
extraction and analysis of soy isoflavonoids from foods and from human urine, 
plasma, and breast milk in support of mechanistic and epidemiologic studies 
assessing the potential cancer protective role of soya or isoflavones. Solid 
phase or solvent extraction was chosen for isolation, and enzymatic or acid 
hydrolysis procedures were used for aglycone production depending on the matrix 
to be analyzed. C-18 reversed-phase HPLC was applied to selectively separate and 
quantitate daidzein (1), glycitein (3), and genistein (4), including their 
malonyl (a) and acetyl (b) esters, and their mammalian metabolites equol (6) and 
O-desmethylangolensin (7), as well as formononetin (2), biochanin-A (5), and 
coumestrol (8) using a gradient elution system. UV absorbance scans and 
authentic standards were applied for identification purposes, additional to 
fluorometric monitoring, electrochemical detection, and GC/ MS analysis after 
trimethyl silylation. Detection limits of 20-microl injections were found to be 
1.09, 0.53, 3.28, and 1.00 pmoles for daidzein, genistein, equol, and 
O-desmethylangolensin (DMA), respectively, by monitoring at the individual 
compound's absorption maximum. The proposed method was applied to monitor 
isoflavone levels in soy foods and in human plasma, urine and breast milk after 
challenge with roasted soybeans. Implications of the presented results on the 
potential activity of isoflavones to prevent cancer by exposing newborn infants 
to these agents are discussed.

Hawaii. Six raw and 11 cooked food groups traditionally consumed in Singapore 
and 8 food groups consumed in Hawaii were analyzed by reversed-phase 
high-pressure liquid chromatography with diode array detection. Mean total 
isoflavone levels varied between 35 and 7500 ppm, with the lowest values found 
in soy milk and burgers and the highest levels observed in soybean and its seeds 
and in supplements. Total isoflavone levels and conjugation patterns varied as a 
function of soybean variety, storage conditions, and food processing. A large 
contribution to the differences in total isoflavone content between food groups 
was due to the water content in foods and to leaching of polar analytes into the 
water phase during boiling. Soy protein drinks and traditional soy foods were 
found to possess very similar isoflavone amounts considering usual serving 
sizes.

Seven healthy females and six males consumed daily 256 mg of vitamin C, 271 mg 
of flavanones (mainly as glycosides), 6 mg of carotenoids (mainly xanthophylls 
and cryptoxanthins), and 0.16 mg of folate by incorporation of daily three times 
236 mL of not from concentrate orange juice (OJ) into their habitual diet. At 
the end of 3 weeks, mean vitamin C, folate, carotenoid, and flavanone plasma 
concentrations increased significantly relative to baseline by 59% (p < 0.001), 
46% (p = 0.018), and 22% (p < 0.001), and 8-fold (p = 0.045), respectively. 
Flavanones were excreted in urine 9-fold more at the end of the intervention (p 
= 0.01) but returned to baseline 2 days after study completion. After the 3 week 
intervention, plasma concentrations of vitamins A and E did not change. 
8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine in white blood cells declined by 16% (p = 0.38; n = 11), 
and in individuals with high baseline concentrations by 29% (p = 0.36; n = 7), 
respectively. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-/high-density lipoprotein 
(HDL)-cholesterol ratios decreased but cholesterol (HDL, LDL, total) and 
thiobarbituric acid reactive substance plasma concentrations did not change 
significantly. We conclude from this pilot study that OJ is an excellent food 
source to enhance circulating concentrations of valuable hydrophilic as well as 
lipophilic phytochemicals.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between 
dietary intake of phytoestrogens estimated by a food frequency questionnaire 
(FFQ) with urinary metabolites.
METHODS: Participants were 26 premenopausal, Caucasian women aged 25 to 42 
years. Dietary intake of isoflavones (genistein and daidzein) and lignans 
(secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol) were estimated by a 53-item 
interviewer-administered FFQ on two occasions, reflecting 'habitual' (previous 2 
months) and 'recent' (previous 2 days) dietary intake. Isoflavone (genistein, 
daidzein) and lignan (enterolactone, enterodiol and secoisolariciresinol) 
concentrations were measured in 24-hour urine samples by gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry. Correlations between FFQ (habitual and recent, separately) and 
urinary metabolite values were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients.
RESULTS: Mean habitual isoflavone and lignan intakes were 13.7 mg/day and 13.8 
mg/day, respectively. Mean urinary concentrations of isoflavones and lignans 
were 17.4 micromol/day and 20.6 micromol/day, respectively. Recent and habitual 
isoflavone intakes were correlated with urinary excretion of metabolites (r = 
0.64, p < 0.001 and r = 0.54, p = 0.004, respectively). Urinary excretion of 
lignans was also modestly correlated with recent and habitual lignan intakes (r 
= 0.46, p = 0.02 and r = 0.40, p = 0.05, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of this FFQ as a measure of dietary 
isoflavone and lignan intake in epidemiological studies.

The antioxidant activities of a commercial brewed coffee were investigated by 
measuring malonaldehyde (MA) formation from oxidized cod liver oil using a gas 
chromatographic method (MA-GC assay) and a thiobarbituric acid method (TBA 
assay). The highest antioxidant activity obtained by the MA-GC assay was from 
regular whole brewed coffee (97.8%) at a level of 20%, and the highest 
antioxidant activity obtained by the TBA assay was from decaffeinated whole 
brewed coffee (96.6%) at a level of 5%. Among 31 chemicals identified in a 
dichloromethane extract, guaiacol, ethylguaiacol, and vinylguaiacol exhibited 
antioxidant activities, which were comparable to that of alpha-tocopherol. Among 
nine chlorogenic acids (three caffeoylquinic acids, three feruloylquinic acids, 
and three dicaffeoylquinic acids) identified, 5-caffeoylquinic acid contained 
the greatest amount both in regular (883.5 microg/mL) and in decaffeinated 
(1032.6 microg/mL) coffees; it exhibited 24.5% activity by the MA-GC assay and 
45.3% activity by the TBA assay at a level of 10 microg/mL. Caffeic and ferulic 
acids showed moderate antioxidant activities in both assays.

It has been suggested that the isoflavone, genistein,, may have some role as a 
chemopreventive agent against cancer in humans. Levels of genistein and its 
beta-glucoside conjugate, genistin, ingested in soybeans and related bean 
products by the Japanese were quantified by HPLC, to estimate daily intake of 
these compounds. Amounts of genistein and genistin in soybeans, soy nuts and soy 
powder were in the range of 4.6 to 18.2 and 200.6 to 968.1 micrograms/g food, 
respectively. The values for soy milk and tofu (bean curd) were 1.9 to 13.9 and 
94.8 to 137.7 micrograms/g food, respectively. Levels of isoflavones in 
fermented soybean products, miso (bean paste) and natto (fermented soybeans), 
were 38.5 to 229.1 micrograms/g food for genistein and 71.7 to 492.8 
micrograms/g food for genistin. Thus, the level of genistein in the fermented 
soybean products was higher than in soy beans and soybean products such as soy 
milk and tofu. From these observations, it is suggested that the beta-glycosyl 
bond of genistin is cleaved to produce genistein by microbes during fermentation 
to yield miso and natto. Soy sauce was also found to contain both isoflavones, 
but at levels lower than in miso and natto. On the basis of these data for 
average annual consumption of soybeans and related products, daily intake of 
genistein and genistin by the Japanese is calculated to be 1.5-4.1 and 6.3-8.3 
mg/person, respectively. These levels are much higher than those for Americans 
or Western Europeans, whose mortality rates for breast, colon and prostate 
cancers are greater than the Japanese.

This study aimed to determine the effect of bread making steps on the stability 
of aflatoxin. Sakha 8 wheat and Gemaiza 5 wheat cultivars, were used in the 
present study. They were inoculated with a dense spore suspension of toxigenic 
fungal species of Aspergillus flavus and a non toxigenic species of Aspergillus 
ochraceus singly and combined. Aflatoxin concentration was determined in the 
whole wheat grain, after milling, after fermentation, and after bread-baking 
process. Results showed that the highest reduction percentage for the total 
aflatoxins (81, G1 and G2), was in Sakha 8 (32.96%) (single treatment), Gemaiza 
5 (19.54%) (single treatment ), Gemaiza 5 (18.65%) (combined treatment), and 
finally in Sakha 8 (16.49%) (combined treatment). There was no significant 
difference (p < 0.05) in aflatoxins content between Sakha 8 and Gemaiza 5 
treated singly and in a combined way before and after milling process. In the 
mean time, the percentage of AFB1, AFG1 and AFG2 were reduced by 31.98%, 44.53% 
and 35.35%, respectively, while the total aflatoxins concentration were reduced 
by 41.17% after baking. Results also showed the presence of a significant 
difference at p < 0.05 among the whole grain, after milling and after baking 
concerning AFG1, AFG2 and the total aflatoxins content. No significant 
difference was found in case of AFB1.

Seed coats and cotyledons from 25 Brazilian and 3 Peruvian bean cultivars were 
investigated in relation to their phenolic profiles and antioxidant capacity. 
Condensed tannins, anthocyanins, and flavonols such as kaempferol and quercetin 
glycosides were mostly found in seed coats. Cotyledons were rich in phenolic 
acids, such as ferulic, sinapic, chlorogenic, and other hydroxycinnamic acids. 
In general, the seed coat color pattern and the type of cultivar showed an 
important influence on the variability of phenolic profiles and levels, 
respectively. Total phenolics and antioxidant capacity assessed by the DPPH 
method were higher in seed coats than in cotyledons. The antioxidant capacity 
had a significant correlation with condensed tannins for all samples and with 
total anthocyanins in black and red seed coats, whereas in cotyledons, it was 
more related to the total phenolic content.

Analysis of phenolics and flavonoids in juice beverages using reversed-phase 
HPLC with coulometric array detection is described. Sixteen serial coulometric 
detectors were used for on-line resolution of co-eluting compounds and 
generation of voltammetric data. Within each class of compounds, oxidation 
potential corresponded to specific substitution patterns where: catechol < 
methoxycatechol < monohydroxyl < methoxyl. Twenty-seven standard compounds were 
resolved in a 45-min run. The limits of detection were in the low ng/ml range 
with a linear response range of at least three orders of magnitude. Intra-run 
retention time variation was < 1% (R.S.D.) and adjacent sensor response ratios 
varied by < 5% (R.S.D.). The utility of this technique in generating 
multivariate data for differentiation of juices and juice mixtures is shown.

The concentrations of trans-resveratrol, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and 
quercetin were evaluated by means of high-performance liquid 
chromatography-diode array detection in red wines obtained from Aglianico, 
Piedirosso, and Nerello Mascalese grapes. The trans-resveratrol and epicatechin 
concentrations did not differ significantly between experimental wines. The 
concentration of quercetin in Nerello Mascalese wines was more than twice that 
observed in Aglianico and Piedirosso wines. Nerello Mascalese wines also 
significantly differed from other wines in the (+)-catechin content, which was 
significantly higher than those found in the other two wines. During maceration, 
the maximum extraction of trans-resveratrol was reached after 12 days for 
Aglianico and Piedirosso, after which a decline was observed. On the contrary, 
in the case of Nerello Mascalese, the concentration of trans-resveratrol 
increased steadily throughout the whole maceration process. After 2 days of 
maceration, the maximum concentration of quercetin was observed in Aglianico 
must, whereas the maximum quercetin extraction was reached after 12 days for 
Piedirosso and 17 days for Nerello Mascalese. The maximum levels of (+)-catechin 
and (-)-epicatechin were generally observed after 12 days of maceration for all 
wines, although a decline of (-)-epicatechin occurred after maximum extraction 
in Aglianico and Piedirosso wines. Following marc pressing, a significant 
increase in the concentration of trans-resveratrol for Aglianico, (+)-catechin 
and (-)-epicatechin for Piedirosso, and (-)-epicatechin for Nerello Mascalese 
was observed.

The phenol content and antioxidant activity of extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) 
differing in their origins and degradation degrees were studied. The 
o-diphenolic compounds typical of olive oil, namely, the oleuropein derivatives 
hydroxytyrosol (3',4'-dihydroxyphenylethanol, 3',4'-DHPEA), the dialdehydic form 
of elenolic acid linked to 3',4'-DHPEA (3',4'-DHPEA-EDA), and an isomer of 
oleuropein aglycon (3',4'-DHPEA-EA), were analyzed by HPLC. The antioxidant 
activity was studied by (a) the xanthine oxidase (XOD)/xanthine system, which 
generates superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide; (b) the diaphorase 
(DIA)/NADH/juglone system, which generates superoxide radical and semiquinonic 
radical; and (c) the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) test. Results 
showed that EVOOs with a low degradation level (as evaluated by acidity, 
peroxide number, and spectroscopic indices K(232), K(270), and deltaK according 
to the EU Regulation) had a higher content of 3',4'-DHPEA-EDA and a lower 
content of 3',4'-DHPEA than oils having intermediate and advanced degradation 
levels. EVOOs with a low degradation degree were 3-5 times more efficient as 
DPPH scavengers and 2 times more efficient as inhibitors of the XOD-catalyzed 
reaction than oils with intermediate and advanced degradation levels. The 
DIA-catalyzed reaction was inhibited by EVOOs having low or intermediate 
degradation levels but not by the most degraded oils.

Epidemiological studies suggest that a moderate consumption of anthocyanins may 
be associated with protection against coronary heart disease. The main dietary 
sources of anthocyanins include red-coloured fruits and red wine. Although 
dietary anthocyanins comprise a diverse mixture of molecules, little is known 
how structural diversity relates to their bioavailability and biological 
function. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the absorption and 
metabolism of the 3-monoglucosides of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin 
and malvidin in humans and to examine both the effect of consuming a red wine 
extract on plasma antioxidant status and on monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 
production in healthy human subjects. After a 12-h overnight fast, seven healthy 
volunteers received 12 g of an anthocyanin extract and provided 13 blood samples 
in the 24 h following the test meal. Furthermore, urine was collected during 
this 24-h period. Anthocyanins were detected in their intact form in both plasma 
and urine samples. Other anthocyanin metabolites could also be detected in 
plasma and urine and were identified as glucuronides of peonidin and malvidin. 
Anthocyanins and their metabolites appeared in plasma about 30 min after 
ingestion of the test meal and reached their maximum value around 1.6 h later 
for glucosides and 2.5 h for glucuronides. Total urinary excretion of red wine 
anthocyanins was 0.05+/-0.01% of the administered dose within 24 h. About 94% of 
the excreted anthocyanins was found in urine within 6 h. In spite of the low 
concentration of anthocyanins found in plasma, an increase in the antioxidant 
capacity and a decrease in MCP-1 circulating levels in plasma were observed.

Wheat bran contains several ester-linked dehydrodimers of ferulic acid, which 
were detected and quantified after sequential alkaline hydrolysis. The major 
dimers released were: 
trans-5-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-7-methoxy-2, 3- 
dihydrobenzofuran-3-carboxylic acid (5-8-BendiFA), 
(Z)-beta-[4-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-methoxyphenoxy]-4-hydroxy-3-methox ycinnamic 
acid (8-O-4-diFA) and (E,E)-4,4'-dihydroxy-5,5'-dimethoxy-3,3'-bicinnamic acid 
(5-5-diFA). trans-7-hydroxy-1-(4-hydroxy-3methoxyphenyl)-6-methoxy-1,2-dihydro - 
naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (8-8-diFA cyclic form) and 
4,4'-dihydroxy-3,3'-dimethoxy-beta,beta'-bicinnamic acid (8-8-diFA non cyclic 
form) were not detected. One of the most abundant dimers, 8-O-4-diFA, was 
purified from de-starched wheat bran after alkaline hydrolysis and preparative 
HPLC. The resultant product was identical to the chemically synthesised 
8-O-4-dimer by TLC and HPLC as confirmed by 1H-NMR and mass spectrometry. The 
absorption maxima and absorption coefficients for the synthetic compound in 
ethanol were: lambda max: 323 nm, lambda min: 258 nm, epsilon lambda max (M-1 
cm-1): 24,800 +/- 2100 and epsilon 280 (M-1 cm-1): 19,700 +/- 1100. The 
antioxidant properties of 8-O-4-diFA were assessed using: (a) inhibition of 
ascorbate/iron-induced peroxidation of phosphatidylcholine liposomes and; (b) 
scavenging of the radical cation of 2,2'-azinobis 
(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) relative to the water-soluble 
vitamin E analogue, Trolox C. The 8-O-4-diFA was a better antioxidant than 
ferulic acid in both lipid and aqueous phases. This is the first report of the 
antioxidant activity of a natural diferulate obtained from a plant.

The application of hydrostatic high pressure on an industrial line of nectarine 
(Prunus persica L.) purées was assessed in comparison with the traditional 
thermal treatment of pasteurization. Changes after thermal processing (85 °C, 5 
min) and after high-pressure processing (HPP: 450 or 600 MPa for 5 or 10 min) 
and during the refrigerated storage (60 d) of an industrially produced nectarine 
purée were evaluated. Conventional heat pasteurization as well as HPP showed 
similar microorganisms' inactivation and maintained the microbial stability of 
purées until the end of the refrigerated storage (60 d). In general, thermally 
treated purée and HP-treated purée at 600 MPa showed more intense color changes 
after processing than the other treatment. In addition, thermally treated purée 
showed more intense color changes during storage than HPP. The highest 
carotenoids extractability was found in those purées treated at the lowest 
high-pressure-treatment intensity and holding time (450 MPa/5 min), but at the 
end of the storage (day 60), no differences in individual or total carotenoid 
levels were found between the purées. HPP at 600 MPa/10 min showed the highest 
polyphenols content after the treatment and during the storage. At day 0, 
significantly higher values were found of total antioxidant activity in purée 
HP-treated at 450 MPa/10 min than in untreated purée; while at the end of the 
storage, HP-treated purée at 600 MPa/10 min had the highest antioxidant 
activity. Hydrostatic high-pressure application in the industrial line of 
nectarine purée presented some advantages compared to the thermal treatment; 
however, some of the changes found were lessen during the storage period. In 
addition, more studies need to be carried out for HP-treatment intensity 
optimization.

Propolis has various biological activities such as antibacterial, antiviral, 
antioxidant, immunostimulating and antiinflammatory, which are generally 
ascribed to the polyphenolic fraction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
absorption of the main polyphenols [caffeic acid (CA), pinobanksin-5methyl ether 
(P-5ME), pinobanksin (Pb), chrysin (C), pinocembrin (P), galangin (G), 
pinobanksin-3-acetate, pinobanksin esters and caffeic acid phenylethyl ester 
(CAPE)] from a dewaxed and standardized extract of propolis (EPID). Fifteen 
healthy volunteers consumed 5 mL EPID in water, corresponding to 125 mg of 
flavonoids. Blood samples were collected before, each hour for 8 h and 24 h 
after EPID intake. After deconjugation by beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase the 
plasma samples were analyzed by a selective liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method using morin as internal standard (I.S.). A 
kinetic profile characterized by two t(max), respectively at 1 h and about 5 h 
post-ingestion, was observed in all the subjects. The two peaks may be due to 
enterohepatic cycling. Among the various polyphenols ingested, only P-5ME, Pb, 
C, P and G were detected in plasma and C(max)t(1h) were 65.7 +/- 13.3, 46.5 +/- 
12.7, 79.5 +/- 18.6, 168.1 +/- 16.3 and 113.7 +/- 16.8 ng/mL, respectively. 
These levels decreased significantly after 8 h and were no longer detectable 24 
h after EPID intake. The recovery of the extraction for CA, Pb, C, P, G and I.S. 
from spiked plasma was 95.2 +/- 3.1, 93.1 +/- 3.6, 91 +/- 2.5, 96.4 +/- 4.2, 
93.4 +/- 2.4 and 85.5 +/- 2.4%, respectively. The results of this study evidence 
that flavonoids from EPID are absorbed, metabolized and Pb-5ME and G seem to 
have apparent absorption, measured as (AUC/dose), higher than C, P and Pb.

In the extracts of fresh raw and frozen broccoli, caffeic, ferulic, sinapinic 
acids and kaempferol were identified. Boiling reduced the amounts of caffeic 
acid and kaempferol in both samples. The concentration of polyphenols was 
2.69mg/g fresh mass and 0.96mg/fresh mass in fresh raw broccoli and frozen raw 
broccoli, respectively. Boiling significantly decreased the amounts of phenolic 
compounds in fresh broccoli (1.58mg/g of fresh mass). In the case of frozen 
broccoli, boiling increased the concentration of polyphenols by 38%. Fresh 
broccoli extract neutralized free radicals by 19.87%. Boiling significantly 
reduced its antiradical activity (to 15.06%). Samples of frozen broccoli had a 
27.06% antiradical ability. Boiling did not change the antiradical activity in 
frozen broccoli case. Hydrothermal processing significantly influenced on the 
ability of the extracts to inhibit the decolorization of β-carotene emulsion. 
The extract of fresh broccoli had a higher activity when uncooked. Boiling 
seemed to increase this activity in the case of frozen broccoli samples. The 
results of the studies on the ability of broccoli extracts to inhibit linoleic 
acid autooxidation were ambiguous and depended on the method applied. No 
correlation was found between the content of phenolic compounds and the 
antioxidant activity of the extracts, regardless of the experimental variant and 
technique used.

The content of anthocyanins, flavonols, and carbohydrates of Tropea red onions 
(Allium cepa L.) was determined by HPLC and HPLC-MS. Cyanidin derivatives 
constitute >50% of total anthocyanins, but delphinidin and petunidin 
derivatives, which have not been reported in red onions thus far, were also 
detected. The flavonoid distribution in the different layers of the bulbs 
indicates that, after homelike peeling, the edible portion contains 79% of the 
total content of quercetin 4'-glucoside but only 27% of the anthocyanins. 
Storage of onions for 6 weeks in different conditions, all of them mimicking 
home storage habits, resulted in a decrease to 64-73% of total anthocyanins. The 
same trend was verified for the total antioxidant activity, which was reduced to 
29-36%. A decrease in glucose and fructose content correlated with anthocyanin 
degradation was also observed. Storage at low temperature seems to better 
preserve the onion anthocyanins.

Salt-tolerant plants grow in a wide variety of saline habitats, from coastal 
regions, salt marshes and mudflats to inland deserts, salt flats and steppes. 
Halophytes living in these extreme environments have to deal with frequent 
changes in salinity level. This can be done by developing adaptive responses 
including the synthesis of several bioactive molecules. Consequently, several 
salt marsh plants have traditionally been used for medical, nutritional, and 
even artisanal purposes. Currently, an increasing interest is granted to these 
species because of their high content in bioactive compounds (primary and 
secondary metabolites) such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, carotenoids, 
vitamins, sterols, essential oils (terpenes), polysaccharides, glycosides, and 
phenolic compounds. These bioactive substances display potent antioxidant, 
antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumoral activities, and therefore 
represent key-compounds in preventing various diseases (e.g. cancer, chronic 
inflammation, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disorder) and ageing processes. 
The ongoing research will lead to the utilisation of halophytes as a new source 
of healthy products as functional foods, nutraceuticals or active principles in 
several industries. This contribution focuses on the ethnopharmacological uses 
of halophytes in traditional medicine and reviews recent investigations on their 
biological activities and nutraceuticals. The work is distributed according to 
the different families of nutraceuticals (lipids, vitamins, proteins, 
glycosides, phenolic compounds, etc.) discussing the analytical techniques 
employed for their determination. Information about the claimed health promoting 
effects of the different families of nutraceuticals is also provided together 
with data on their application.

Using liquid/liquid extraction, three fractions were obtained from an Italian 
red wine containing single polyphenolic subfractions: (1) phenolic acids and 
quercetin-3-glucuronide, (2) catechins and quercetin-3-glucoside, and (3) 
anthocyanins. Beside the scavenging capacity of the different fractions against 
hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals, the in vitro inhibition of low density 
lipoprotein oxidation and platelet aggregation (two main events in the 
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis) were tested. The antioxidant activity of the 
fractions has been compared with that of the original red wine before and after 
dealcoholization. The anthocyanin fraction was the most effective both in 
scavenging reactive oxygen species and in inhibiting lipoprotein oxidation and 
platelet aggregation. This higher activity can be explained by both its high 
concentration in red wine and its antioxidant efficiency, which, at least for 
peroxyl radical scavenging, was three times as high as that of the other two 
fractions. Our results suggest that anthocyanins could be the key component in 
red wine in light of the protection against cardiovascular diseases, although 
this hypothesis needs in vivo evidence.

BACKGROUND: Aqueous extracts of most medicinal plants traditionally employed in 
Portugal (at the ratio of 1 g plant: 110 mL water) have been assayed for total 
antioxidant capacity and phenol content, in order to elucidate their claimed 
medicinal features.
RESULTS: The antioxidant activity was assessed by the ABTS(•+) method; the 
ascorbic acid equivalent values ranged from 1.4280 ± 0.1261 g L(-1) for avocado 
(Persea americana (Lauraceae)) obtained by infusion of powder, down to 0.0027 ± 
0.0012 g L(-1) for olive (Olea europaea (Oleaceae)) obtained by infusion of 
leaves. Total phenol content was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure; 
the gallic acid equivalent values ranged from 0.5541 ± 0.0289 g L(-1) for 
avocado obtained by infusion of powder, down to 0.0053 ± 0.0014 g L(-1) for 
olive obtained by boiling leaves. A good correlation between total antioxidant 
capacity and total phenol content was found.
CONCLUSION: The method of powder infusion should be chosen if high concentration 
of antioxidants are sought. On the other hand, a high antioxidant capacity and a 
high phenol content correlate well with the empirically established (and widely 
publicised) capacity to treat respiratory infections. Copyright © 2007 Society

The effect of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) and cooking on the flavonoids 
and vitamin C content (ascorbic + dehydroascorbic acid; AA + DHAA) of fresh-cut 
spinach was evaluated. The total flavonoid content (approximately 1000 mg 
kg(-)(1) f.w.) remained quite constant during storage in both air and MAP 
atmospheres, while vitamin C (750 mg kg(-)(1)f.w.) was better preserved in 
MAP-stored spinach. AA was transformed to DHAA during storage, and its 
concentration was higher in MAP-stored tissues. The free-radical scavenging 
activity of the isolated flavonoids was tested, and only those flavonoids with 
either a dihydroxyl grouping or acylated with ferulic acid showed significant 
activity. A decrease in the total antioxidant activity was observed during 
storage, particularly important in MAP-stored spinach. The higher content of 
DHAA and lower content of both AA and antioxidant flavonoids in the MAP-stored 
samples could explain this antioxidant activity decrease. Boiling extracted 50% 
of total flavonoids and 60% vitamin C in the cooking water. However, flavonoid 
glucuronides were extracted more in the cooking water than the other glycosides. 
The vitamin C content of the cooked tissue was higher in those samples stored in 
MAP.

The antioxidant activity of pomegranate juices was evaluated by four different 
methods (ABTS, DPPH, DMPD, and FRAP) and compared to those of red wine and a 
green tea infusion. Commercial pomegranate juices showed an antioxidant activity 
(18-20 TEAC) three times higher than those of red wine and green tea (6-8 TEAC). 
The activity was higher in commercial juices extracted from whole pomegranates 
than in experimental juices obtained from the arils only (12-14 TEAC). HPLC-DAD 
and HPLC-MS analyses of the juices revealed that commercial juices contained the 
pomegranate tannin punicalagin (1500-1900 mg/L) while only traces of this 
compound were detected in the experimental juice obtained from arils in the 
laboratory. This shows that pomegranate industrial processing extracts some of 
the hydrolyzable tannins present in the fruit rind. This could account for the 
higher antioxidant activity of commercial juices compared to the experimental 
ones. In addition, anthocyanins, ellagic acid derivatives, and hydrolyzable 
tannins were detected and quantified in the pomegranate juices.

Hand-squeezed navel orange juice contains 839 mg/L phenolics, including 
flavanones, flavones, and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. The flavanones are 
the main phenolics in the soluble fraction (648.6 mg/L) and are also present in 
the cloud fraction (104.8 mg/L). During refrigerated storage of fresh juice (4 
degrees C), 50% of the soluble flavanones precipitate and integrate into the 
cloud fraction. Commercial orange juices contain only 81-200 mg/L soluble 
flavanones (15-33%) and the content in the cloud is higher (206-644 mg/L) 
(62-85%), showing that during industrial processing and storage the soluble 
flavanones precipitate and are included in the cloud. An in vitro simulation of 
orange juice digestion shows that a serving of fresh orange juice (240 mL) 
provides 9.7 mg of soluble hesperidin 
(4'-methoxy-3',5,7-trihydroxyflavanone-7-rutinoside) and 4.7 mg of the 
C-glycosylflavone vicenin 2 (apigenin, 6,8-di-C-glucoside) for freshly squeezed 
orange juice, whereas pasteurized commercial juices provide 3.7 mg of soluble 
hesperidin and a higher amount of vicenin 2 (6.3 mg). This means that although 
orange juice is a very rich source of flavanones, only a limited quantity is 
soluble, and this might affect availability for absorption (11-36% of the 
soluble flavanones, depending on the juice). The flavanones precipitated in the 
cloud are not available for absorption and are partly transformed to the 
corresponding chalcones during the pancreatin-bile digestion.

Orange juice manufactured at industrial scale was subjected to digestion under 
in vitro gastrointestinal conditions (pH, temperature, and enzyme and chemical 
conditions) to evaluate the influence of individual industrial processing 
treatments on flavanone solubility, stability, and ability to permeate through a 
membrane under simulated physiological conditions. Four industrial processes 
including squeezing, standard pasteurization, concentration, and freezing were 
evaluated. Hand squeezing was compared with industrial squeezing. After in vitro 
gastrointestinal digestion of the orange juices, the flavanones able to permeate 
through a dialysis membrane, and those remaining in the retentate were evaluated 
by HPLC as were those present in the insoluble fraction. In all of the assayed 
orange juices, a high content of precipitated chalcones ( approximately 70% of 
the total flavanones) was formed under the physiological conditions of the 
gastrointestinal tract. Hand squeezing provided a higher concentration of 
flavanones in the permeated fraction and lower transformation to chalcones than 
industrial squeezing. Standard pasteurization did not influence the solubility 
and permeability of the orange juice flavanones and chalcones. Industrial 
concentration did not affect the amount of flavanones able to permeate but 
decreased the chalcones produced. Juices produced from frozen orange juice 
contained considerably smaller amounts of both soluble flavanones and insoluble 
chalcones.

Blood orange juice has a high content in anthocyanins, especially represented by 
delphinidin-3-glucoside (D3G), cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) and 
cyanidin-3-(6-malonylglucoside) (CMG). An LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous 
determination of D3G and C3G in human plasma and urine was developed and 
validated. After sample preparation by SPE, chromatographic separation was 
performed with an RP-C(18) column, using a water/methanol linear gradient. The 
quantitation of target compounds was determined by multiple reaction monitoring 
(MRM) mode, using ESI. The method showed good selectivity, sensitivity (LOD = 
0.05 and 0.10 ng/mL for C3G in plasma and urine, respectively; LOD = 0.10 ng/mL 
for D3G in plasma and urine), linearity (0.20-200 ng/mL; r >or= 0.998), intra- 
and interday precision and accuracy (<or= 14.6%) and satisfactory recoveries 
(80.0-110.4%) for the target compounds in both plasma and urine. Stability of 
analytes in plasma and urine has been investigated in detail. This method was 
successfully applied to the determination of D3G, C3G and CMG levels in human 
plasma and urine after the ingestion of a single dose (500 mL) of blood orange 
juice.

The concentrations of 11 phenols and 5 furans were measured in 12 categories of 
distilled spirits by HPLC methodology, together with the total antioxidant 
status (TAS) of the same beverages. Ellagic acid was the phenol present in 
highest concentration in all beverages. Moderate amounts of syringaldehyde, 
syringic acid, and gallic acid, as well as lesser amounts of vanillin and 
vanillic acid, were measurable in most samples of whiskey, brandy, and rum but 
were largely undetectable in gin, vodka, liqueurs, and miscellaneous spirits. 
5-(Hydroxymethyl)furfural was the predominant furan in the former three 
beverages, notably cognac, with 2-furaldehyde the next highest, but these were 
undetectable in most of the latter beverages. Highest TAS values were given by 
armagnac, cognac, and bourbon whiskey, all three of which tended toward the 
highest concentrations of phenols. Negative TAS values were exhibited by rum, 
vodka, gin, and miscellaneous spirits in line with the low or undetectable 
phenol concentrations in these beverages. Wood aging is the most likely source 
of phenols and furans in distilled spirits. Those beverages exposed to this 
treatment contain significant antioxidant activity, which is between the ranges 
for white and red wines, with the potential to augment the antiatherosclerotic 
functions attributable to the ethanol that they contain.

This study presents the phenolic compounds profile of commercial Cornicabra 
virgin olive oils from five successive crop seasons (1995/1996 to 1999/2000; n = 
97), determined by solid phase extraction reversed phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography (SPE RP-HPLC), and its relationship with oxidative stability, 
processing conditions, and a preliminary study on variety classification. The 
median of total phenols content was 38 ppm (as syringic acid), although a wide 
range was observed, from 11 to 76 ppm. The main phenols found were the 
dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to tyrosol (p-HPEA-EDA; 9 +/- 7 ppm, as 
median and interquartile range), oleuropein aglycon (8 +/- 6 ppm), and the 
dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA-EDA; 5 +/- 
8 ppm). In many cases the correlation with oxidative stability was higher when 
the sum of the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol 
(3,4-DHPEA-EDA) and oleuropein aglycon (r (2) = 0.91-0.96) or the sum of these 
two and hydroxytyrosol (r (2) = 0.90-0.97) was considered than was observed with 
HPLC total phenols (r (2)= 0.91-0.95) and especially with colorimetric 
determination of total polyphenols and o-diphenols (r (2) = 0.77-0.95 and 
0.78-0.92, respectively). 3,4-DHPEA-EDA, p-HPEA-EDA, the aglycons of oleuropein 
and ligstroside, and HPLC total phenols content presented highly significant 
differences (p = 0.001-0.010) with respect to the dual- and triple-phase 
extraction systems used, whereas colorimetric total polyphenols content did not 
(p = 0.348) and o-diphenols showed a much lower significant difference (p = 
0.031). The five variables that most satisfactorily classified the principal 
commercial Spanish virgin olive oil varieties were 1-acetoxypinoresinol, 
4-(acetoxyethyl)-1,2-dihydroxybenzene (3,4-DHPEA-AC), ligstroside aglycon, 
p-HPEA-EDA, and RT 43.3 contents.

The concentration of hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA) and its secoiridoid derivatives 
(3,4-DHPEA-EDA and 3,4-DHPEA-EA) in virgin olive oil decreased rapidly when the 
oil was repeatedly used for preparing french fries in deep-fat frying 
operations. At the end of the first frying process (10 min at 180 degrees C), 
the concentration of the dihydroxyphenol components was reduced to 50-60% of the 
original value, and after six frying operations only about 10% of the initial 
components remained. However, tyrosol (p-HPEA) and its derivatives (p-HPEA-EDA 
and p-HPEA-EA) in the oil were much more stable during 12 frying operations. The 
reduction in their original concentration was much smaller than that for 
hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives and showed a roughly linear relationship with 
the number of frying operations. The antioxidant activity of the phenolic 
extract measured using the DPPH test rapidly diminished during the first six 
frying processes, from a total antioxidant activity higher than 740 micromol of 
Trolox/kg down to less than 250 micromol/kg. On the other hand, the 
concentration of polar compounds, oxidized triacylglycerol monomers (oxTGs), 
dimeric TGs, and polymerized TGs rapidly increased from the sixth frying 
operation onward, when the antioxidant activity of the phenolic extract was very 
low, and as a consequence the oil was much more susceptible to oxidation. The 
loss of antioxidant activity in the phenolic fraction due to deep-fat frying was 
confirmed by the storage oil and oil-in-water emulsions containing added 
extracts from olive oil used for 12 frying operations.

This study investigated the effect of both the degree of ripening of the olive 
fruit and irrigation management-rain-fed, two different regulated deficit 
irrigations (RDI), the method proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations (known as FAO), and 125 FAO (125% FAO)-on the phenolic and 
volatile composition of Cornicabra virgin olive oils obtained during two crop 
seasons. Secoiridoid phenolic derivatives greatly decreased upon increase of 
both irrigation and ripening, for example, the 3,4-DHPEA-EDA content decreased 
from 770 to 450 mg/kg through fruit ripening under rain-fed conditions and from 
676 to 388 mg/kg from rain-fed conditions to FAO irrigation treatment (at a 
ripeness index of approximately 4). Moreover, secoiridoid derivatives of 
hydroxytyrosol decreased more than those of tyrosol. The levels of major 
volatile components decreased in the course of ripening but were higher in 
irrigated olive oils: for example, the E-2-hexenal content ranged between 4.2 
and 2.6 mg/kg (expressed as 4-methyl-2-pentanol) over fruit maturation under 
rain-fed conditions and between 8.0 and 3.5 mg/kg under FAO scheduling. It is 
important to note that where water was applied only from the beginning of August 
(RDI-2), when oil begins to accumulate in the fruit, the resulting virgin olive 
oil presented a phenol and volatile profile similar to those of the FAO and 125 
FAO methods, but with a considerable reduction in the amount of water supplied 
to the olive orchard.

partially ripe and ripe stages and during storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C (room 
temperature) and 1-2 degrees C (cool temperature). Neochlorogenic and 
p-coumaroylquinic acids were the main hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, but 
chlorogenic acid was also identified in all cultivars. The 3-glucoside and 
3-rutinoside of cyanidin were the major anthocyanins. Peonidin and pelargonidin 
3-rutinosides were the minor anthocyanins, and peonidin 3-glucoside was also 
present in cvs. Burlat and Van. Epicatechin was the main monomeric flavan-3-ol 
with catechin present in smaller amounts in all cultivars. The flavonol rutin 
was also detected. Cultivar Saco contained the highest amounts of phenolics [227 
mg/100 g of fresh weight (fw)] and cv. Van the lowest (124 mg/100 g of fw). 
Phenolic acid contents generally decreased with storage at 1-2 degrees C and 
increased with storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C. Anthocyanin levels increased at 
both storage temperatures. In cv. Van the anthocyanins increased up to 5-fold 
during storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C (from 47 to 230 mg/100 g of fw). Flavonol 
and flavan-3-ol contents remained quite constant. For all cultivars the levels 
of phenolic acids were higher in 2001 and the anthocyanin levels were higher in 
2002, which suggest a significant influence of climatic conditions on these 
compounds.

Chlorogenic acid, the ester of caffeic acid with quinic acid, is one of the most 
abundant polyphenols in the human diet with coffee, fruits and vegetables as its 
major sources. Its antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties have been well 
established in animal studies. However, little is known about its gut absorption 
and metabolism. In the present work, four groups of rats (n = 8) were fed a diet 
supplemented with chlorogenic, caffeic or quinic acids (250 micromol/d) or an 
unsupplemented diet for 8 d. Parent compounds and their metabolites were 
estimated in urine (24-h collection) and plasma by HPLC-electrospray 
ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Significant differences in their levels 
were observed among the groups. The recovery of chlorogenic acid in urine was 
low (0.8%, mol/mol), and the total urinary excretion of caffeic acid liberated 
by hydrolysis of chlorogenic acid and its tissular methylated metabolites 
(ferulic and isoferulic acids) did not account for >0.5% (mol/mol) of the dose 
ingested. On the other hand, the metabolites of microbial origin, namely, 
m-coumaric acid and derivatives of phenylpropionic, benzoic and hippuric acids, 
represented the major compounds in both urine and plasma. Hippuric acid largely 
originated from the transformation of the quinic acid moiety, and all other 
metabolites from the caffeic acid moiety. These microbial metabolites accounted 
for 57.4% (mol/mol) of the chlorogenic acid intake. Such a high abundance of 
microbial metabolites shows that the bioavailability of chlorogenic acid depends 
largely on its metabolism by the gut microflora. Their potential importance in 
explaining the biological effects of dietary polyphenols is emphasized.

Procyanidins are major dietary polyphenols made of elementary flavan-3-ol 
(epi)catechin units. They have antioxidant properties and may contribute to 
health benefits in humans, but little is known about their metabolic fate. We 
compared here the metabolism of procyanidin dimer B3, trimer C2, and polymer 
isolated from willow tree catkins to that of catechin monomer in rats. These 
compounds were administered in the rat diet (0.1%, w/w) for 5 d and their 
metabolites estimated in 24 h urine. In rats fed procyanidins, neither parent 
compound nor catechin derivatives could be detected in contrast to animals fed 
catechin monomer, which excreted large amounts of catechin and its 
3'-O-methylated form (25.7 +/- 0.6%). On the other hand, 16 metabolites of 
microbial origin were detected and identified as phenylvaleric, phenylpropionic, 
phenylacetic, and benzoic acid derivatives. Their total yields significantly 
decreased from the catechin monomer (10.6 +/- 1.1%) to the procyanidin dimer 
(6.5 +/- 0.2%), trimer (0.7 +/- 0.1%), and polymer (0.5 +/- 0.1%). Therefore, 
the degree of procyanidin polymerization has a major impact on their fate in the 
body characterized by a poor absorption through the gut barrier and a limited 
metabolism by the intestinal microflora as compared to catechin. This will have 
to be considered to explain the health effects of procyanidins. The contribution 
of their microbial metabolites should also be further investigated.

The fate of anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and ellagitannins was studied following 
the consumption of 300 g of raspberries by healthy human volunteers and subjects 
with an ileostomy. Postingestion plasma and urine from the former and ileal 
fluid and urine from the latter group were collected and analyzed by 
HPLC-PDA-MS(2). Plasma from the healthy volunteers did not contain detectable 
quantities of either the native raspberry polyphenolics or their metabolites. 
The three main raspberry anthocyanins were excreted in urine in both healthy and 
ileostomy volunteers 0-7 h after ingestion, in quantities corresponding to <0.1% 
of intake. This indicates a low level of absorption in the small intestine. With 
ileostomy volunteers 40% of anthocyanins and 23% of the ellagitannin sanguiin 
H-6 were recovered in ileal fluid with the main excretion period being the first 
4 h after raspberry consumption. The recovery of ellagic acid in ileal fluid was 
241%, indicating hydrolysis of ellagitannins in the stomach and/or the small 
intestine. Urinary excretion of ellagic acid and an ellagic acid-O-glucuronide 
was <1% of intake. No intact or conjugated forms of ellagitannins were detected 
in urine from either healthy subjects or ileostomy volunteers. However, in 
healthy subjects, but not the ileostomists, ellagitannins were catabolized with 
the appearance of urolithin A-O-glucuronide, two of its isomers, and urolithin 
B-O-glucuronide in urine collected 7-48 h after raspberry consumption. There was 
marked variation in the urolithin profile of individual volunteers, indicating 
differences in the colonic microflora responsible for ellagitannin degradation.

Recent studies have shown that dietary fiber and polyphenols of vegetables and 
fruits improve lipid metabolism and prevent the oxidation of low density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which hinder the development of 
atherosclerosis. The goal of this study was to measure the total polyphenol and 
dietary fiber contents of some tropical fruits (i.e., pineapple, wax apple, 
rambutan, lichi, guava, and mango) and compare the results to the content of 
these substances in the better characterized persimmon. It was found that lichi, 
guava, and ripe mango (cv. Keaw) have 3.35, 4.95, and 6.25 mg of total 
polyphenols in 100 g fresh fruit, respectively. This is significantly higher 
than in persimmon, pineapple, wax apple, mature green mango, and rambutan [P < 
0.0005 for pineapple (Smooth Cayene variant), wax apple, persimmon, rambutan, 
mature green mango (cv. Keaw); the value of P < 0.001 is found only for 
pineapple (Phuket, Queen variant)]. The same relationship was observed for the 
contents of gallic acid and of dietary fiber. It can be supposed that among the 
studied fruit, lichi, guava, and ripe mango may be preferable for dietary 
prevention of atherosclerosis.

Dietary fibers, major phenolics, main minerals, and trace elements in persimmons 
and apples were analyzed and compared in order to choose a preferable fruit for 
an antiatherosclerotic diet. Fluorometry and atomic absorption spectrometry 
following microwave digestion were optimized for the determination of major 
phenolics and minerals. Total, soluble, and insoluble dietary fibers, total 
phenols, epicatechin, gallic and p-coumaric acids, and concentrations of Na, K, 
Mg, Ca, Fe, and Mn in whole persimmons, their pulps, and peels were 
significantly higher than in whole apples, pulps, and peels (P < 0.01-0.0025). 
Conversely, the contents of Cu and Zn were higher in apples than in persimmons. 
In persimmons and apples all of the above components were higher in their peels 
than in whole fruits and pulps. The relatively high contents of dietary fibers, 
total and major phenolics, main minerals, and trace elements make persimmon 
preferable for an antiatherosclerotic diet.

Polish garlic and white and red onions were subjected to blanching, boiling, 
frying, and microwaving for different periods of time, and then their bioactive 
compounds (polyphenols, flavonoids, flavanols, anthocyanins, tannins, and 
ascorbic acid) and antioxidant activities were determined. It was found that 
blanching and frying and then microwaving of garlic and onions did not decrease 
significantly the amounts of their bioactive compounds and the level of 
antioxidant activities ( P > 0.05). The HPLC profiles of free and soluble ester- 
and glycoside-bound phenolic acids showed that trans-hydroxycinnamic acids 
(caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic) were as much as twice higher in 
garlic than in onions. Quercetin quantity was the highest in red onion among the 
studied vegetables. The electrophoretic separation of nonreduced garlic and 
onion proteins after boiling demonstrated their degradation in the range from 50 
to 112 kDa.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the present work was to evaluate the phytochemical 
profile and the antioxidant activity of strawberry fruit (cv. Camarosa) upon 
postharvest ripening at room temperature (20 °C) and to correlate them with 
qualitative attributes.
RESULTS: 'Camarosa' fruit retained an appreciable postharvest performance for up 
to 1 day shelf life; thereafter substantial quality deterioration was observed. 
An increased phenolic content, mainly attributed to hydroxycinnamic acids, 
flavonols and anthocyanins, was monitored after 3 days maintenance at 20 °C. The 
chromatographic fingerprint of athocyanins showed that pelargonidin-3-glucoside 
was the major anthocyanin, which increased with the increase of shelf life 
period, while cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside were found at 
lower concentrations. The potent radical scavenging activity, evaluated with 
four in vitro assays, showed a higher antioxidant capacity after 3 and 1 days of 
shelf life. In addition, the antioxidant effect of strawberry fruit extracts on 
lipid substrates and on an emulsion system showed a significant inhibition in 
the formation of conjugated diene hyperoxides. Interestingly, no direct 
correlation between the phytochemical profile and the quality attributes exist.
CONCLUSION: 'Camarosa' fruit had acceptable quality attributes for fresh 
consumption and at the same time a high phytochemical content up to 1 day shelf 
life. The over-ripe fruit continued to be an excellent reservoir of natural 
antioxidants, pointing to its potential use as food antioxidant and nutritional 
supplement.

Quercetin-4'-glucoside is a major flavonol in onions, and this study 
investigated the absorption and fate of radiolabeled quercetin-4'-glucoside in 
rats. Rats ingested [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside and the distribution of 
radioactivity throughout the body was determined after 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 h. The 
gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, and plasma were extracted, and 
radiolabeled components were identified and quantified using high-performance 
liquid chromatography with on-line radioactivity detection and tandem mass 
spectrometry. Two hours after dosing, all the [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside 
had been metabolized. More than 85% of the ingested radioactivity was present in 
the gastrointestinal tract at all time points with approximately 6% being 
absorbed and present in blood and internal organs, primarily the liver and 
kidneys. More than 95% of the absorbed radioactivity was in the form of >20 
different methylated glucuronated and/or sulfated quercetin conjugates. Five 
hours after ingestion, the main radiolabeled metabolites were quercetin 
diglucuronides in the gut, liver, and kidneys and glucuronyl sulfates of 
methylated quercetin in plasma. The main site of quercetin metabolism seemed to 
be the gastrointestinal tract. Quercetin metabolites may have a major influence 
on the gut mucosal epithelium and on colonic disease.

Quercetin and quercetin glycosides from food or dietary supplements appear in 
body tissues almost exclusively as glucuronated, sulfated, and methylated 
quercetin conjugates, suggesting that the in vivo bioactivity of quercetin may 
be due to its metabolites. In this study, pre- and postabsorptive metabolism of 
orally ingested quercetin was examined by comparing the metabolite pattern in 
gastrointestinal (GI) tissues, contents, and internal tissues. F344 rats (n = 6) 
were fed for 6 wk a diet containing 0.45% quercetin and the metabolite patterns 
were determined in the tissues and contents of stomach, small intestine, cecum, 
and colon and in liver, kidney, and plasma using LC-MS/MS. GI contents contained 
predominantly unmetabolized quercetin at 94-100%, whereas quercetin in GI 
tissues was present as 11 different sulfated, glucuronated, and methylated 
metabolites at 32% in stomach, 88% in small intestine, 27% in cecum, and 46% in 
colon. Quercetin was further metabolized postabsorption and found in liver, 
kidney, and plasma almost exclusively as sulfated methyl-quercetin glucuronide. 
The unique pattern of quercetin metabolites in each GI tissue indicates 
extensive biotransformation before absorption and distribution in rats.

Flavonoids, a subclass of polyphenols, are major constituents of many 
plant-based foods and beverages, including tea, wine and chocolate. 
Epidemiological studies have shown that a flavonoid-rich diet is associated with 
reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. The majority of the flavonoids survive 
intact until they reach the colon where they are then extensively metabolized 
into smaller fragments. Here, we describe the development of GC-MS-based methods 
for the profiling of phenolic microbial fermentation products in urine, plasma, 
and fecal water. Furthermore, the methods are applicable for profiling products 
obtained from in vitro batch culture fermentation models. The methods 
incorporate enzymatic deconjugation, liquid-liquid extraction, derivatization, 
and subsequent analysis by GC-MS. At the level of individual compounds, the 
methods gave recoveries better than 80% with inter-day precision being better 
than 20%, depending on the matrix. Limits of detection were below 0.1 microg/ml 
for most phenolic acids. The newly developed methods were successfully applied 
to samples from human and in-vitro intervention trials, studying the metabolic 
impact of flavonoid intake. In conclusion, the methods presented are robust and 
generally applicable to diverse biological fluids. Its profiling character is 
useful to investigate on a large scale the gut microbiome-mediated 
bioavailability of flavonoids.

A rapid and sensitive capillary electrophoretic method for analysis of 
resveratrol in wine was established. The protocol consists of sample preparation 
using a C-18 solid-phase extraction cartridge. Baseline separation of trans- and 
cis-resveratrol from other compounds in wine was achieved in approximately 8 min 
using a micellar mode. The limits of detection for trans- and cis-resveratrol 
were 0.1 and 0.15 micromol/L, respectively. Recovery rates for trans-resveratrol 
using the protocol described ranged from 94.6 +/- 8.5 to 101.9 +/- 7.2%. These 
procedures were used to analyze the trans- and cis-resveratrol levels in 26 
wines. It was found that the concentration of trans-resveratrol ranged from 
0.987 to 25.4 micromol/L, whereas the concentration of cis-resveratrol was much 
lower.

Proanthocyanidins (PAs) have been shown to have potential health benefits. 
However, no data exist concerning their dietary intake. Therefore, PAs in common 
and infant foods from the U.S. were analyzed. On the bases of our data and those 
from the USDA's Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII) of 
1994-1996, the mean daily intake of PAs in the U.S. population (>2 y old) was 
estimated to be 57.7 mg/person. Monomers, dimers, trimers, and those above 
trimers contribute 7.1, 11.2, 7.8, and 73.9% of total PAs, respectively. The 
major sources of PAs in the American diet are apples (32.0%), followed by 
chocolate (17.9%) and grapes (17.8%). The 2- to 5-y-old age group (68.2 
mg/person) and men >60 y old (70.8 mg/person) consume more PAs daily than other 
groups because they consume more fruit. The daily intake of PAs for 4- to 
6-mo-old and 6- to 10-mo-old infants was estimated to be 1.3 mg and 26.9 mg, 
respectively, based on the recommendations of the American Academy of 
Pediatrics. This study supports the concept that PAs account for a major 
fraction of the total flavonoids ingested in Western diets.

In the United States, commercially available foods, including cocoa and 
chocolate, are being marketed with statements referring to the level of 
antioxidant activity and polyphenols. For cocoa-containing foods, there has been 
no comprehensive survey of the content of these and other chemistries. A survey 
of cocoa and chocolate-containing products marketed in the United States was 
conducted to determine antioxidant activity and polyphenol and procyanidin 
contents. Commercially available samples consisted of the top market share 
products in each of the following six categories: natural cocoa, unsweetened 
baking chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet baking chips, milk chocolate, and 
chocolate syrup. Composite samples were characterized using four different 
methods: oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), vitamin C equivalence 
antioxidant capacity (VCEAC), total polyphenols, and procyanidins. All composite 
lots were further characterized for percent nonfat cocoa solids (NFCS) and 
percent fat. Natural cocoas had the highest levels of antioxidant activities, 
total polyphenols, and procyanidins followed by baking chocolates, dark 
chocolates and baking chips, and finally milk chocolate and syrups. The results 
showed a strong linear correlation between NFCS and ORAC (R (2) = 0.9849), total 
polyphenols (R (2) = 0.9793), and procyanidins (R (2) = 0.946), respectively. On 
the basis of principal component analysis, 81.4% of the sample set was 
associated with NFCS, antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, and procyanidins. 
The results indicated that, regardless of the product category, NFCS were the 
primary factor contributing to the level of cocoa antioxidants in the products 
tested. Results further suggested that differences in cocoa bean blends and 
processing, with the possible exception of Dutching, are minor factors in 
determining the level of antioxidants in commercially available cocoa-containing 
products in the United States.

A validated method was developed for the simultaneous determination of the 
hydroxycinnamates caffeic acid (CA), dihydrocaffeic acid (DHCA), ferulic acid 
(FA), dihydroferulic acid (DHFA), and isoferulic acid (IFA) in human plasma as 
metabolites derived from coffee consumption. The method includes a protein 
precipitation step prior to enzymatic hydrolysis of the conjugated metabolites 
(sulfate, glucuronide, and/or ester) back to their aglycone forms. After 
liquid-liquid extraction, the reconstituted extract was analysed by 
high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to negative electrospray 
ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. Calibration curves were constructed from 
spiked human plasma samples in the range of 0-4800 nM for each of the targeted 
analytes. Two internal standards, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid (500 nM) 
and 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid (200 nM), were spiked at the beginning of the 
sample preparation and before analysis, respectively. Good performance data were 
obtained with limits of detection and quantification of the five 
hydroxycinnamates ranging between 1-15 nM and 3-50 nM, respectively. Within and 
between-days precisions were respectively calculated between 8-18% and 8-30% (at 
50 nM added initially), between 6-9% and 6-12% (at 200 nM), and between 5-9% and 
5-9% (at 500 nM). Precision calculated from different analysts ranged from 18% 
to 44% (at 50 nM), from 8% to 16% (at 200 nM), and from 4% to 8% (at 500 nM). 
Using this method, we determined plasma levels in humans and measured the 
efficiency of deconjugation using our enzymatic cocktail.

Five French cider apple varieties were compared on the basis of their detailed 
polyphenol profile in the cortex and in the juices. Among the factors studied, 
variety was the most important variability factor in fruits, whereas polyphenol 
profiles showed an overall stability from one year to another, and a limited 
decrease of polyphenol concentration was observed during the starch regression 
period of fruit maturation. In juices, procyanidins remained the preponderant 
polyphenol class with concentrations up to 2.4 g/L even in centrifuged juices. 
Compared to the fruits, the average degree of polymerization of procyanidins was 
significantly reduced in the juice. Centrifugation of the crude juice had only 
minor effects on the polyphenol composition. For one variety, highly polymerized 
procyanidins with average degrees of polymerization of 25 were shown to be 
soluble in the centrifuged juice at a concentration of close to 1.2 g/L. 
Oxygenation of the juices during processing resulted in a significant decrease 
of all classes of native polyphenols. Catechins and procyanidins were 
particularly affected by oxidation, whereas caffeoylquinic acid was partly 
preserved. The transfer of polyphenols after pressing was maximal for 
dihydrochalcones and minimal for procyanidins with extraction yield values close 
to 80 and 30%, respectively.

Blackberries are a rich source of polyphenolics, particularly anthocyanins, that 
may contribute to the reduced risk of chronic disease; however, as with most 
berries, the fresh fruit are only seasonally available. With most of the 
blackberries consumed as frozen or in thermally processed forms after long-term 
storage, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of processing and 
6 months of storage on the anthocyanins and antioxidant capacity of blackberries 
that were individually quick-frozen (IQF), canned-in-syrup, canned-in-water, 
pureed, and juiced (clarified and nonclarified). Monomeric anthocyanins, percent 
polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity by oxygen radical absorbance capacity 
(ORAC FL) and photochemiluminescence (PCL) were determined postprocessing (1 
day) and after 1, 3, and 6 months of storage. Processing resulted in increases 
in polymeric color values (up to 7%) and losses in monomeric anthocyanins (up to 
65%). For most products, processing also resulted in losses in antioxidant 
capacity (by ORAC FL and PCL). Storage at 25 degrees C of all processed products 
resulted in dramatic losses in monomeric anthocyanins with as much as 75% losses 
of anthocyanins throughout storage, which coincided with marked increases of 
percent polymeric color values of these products over 6 months of storage. There 
were no changes in ORAC FL or PCL for processed products throughout long-term 
storage. No significant changes in antioxidant capacity or anthocyanin content 
were observed in IQF fruit during long-term storage at -20 degrees C.

Changes in blackberry ellagitannin composition in response to juicing (clarified 
and nonclarified), pureeing, canning (in water or syrup), and freezing as well 
as changes in processed products during 6 months of storage were investigated. 
Canning, pureeing, and freezing had little effect on ellagitannins, but 
processing berries into nonclarified and clarified juices resulted in total 
ellagitannin losses of 70 and 82%, respectively, due to removal of 
ellagitannin-rich seeds in the presscake. Minimal changes in total ellagitannin 
content were observed during storage of thermally processed products, but 
compositional changes indicative of ellagitannin depolymerization were apparent. 
The ellagitannin content and composition of frozen berries remained stable over 
6 months of storage. Ellagitannins are well retained in canned, pureed, and 
frozen blackberries, but methods are needed to prevent losses during juice 
processing and/or exploit the ellagitannin-rich coproducts.

The steryl ferulate contents of rye and wheat grains and their milling fractions 
were analyzed using a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic 
(HPLC) method. HPLC-mass spectrometry was used for identification. In addition, 
steryl ferulates of some selected milling byproducts were determined. The total 
steryl ferulate contents of rye and wheat grains were 6.0 and 6.3 mg/100 g, 
respectively. Uneven distribution of steryl ferulates in the grains led to 
considerable differences in the milling products; their steryl ferulate contents 
ranged from trace amounts in flours with low ash content to 20 and 34 mg/100 g 
in rye and wheat brans, respectively. Campestanyl ferulate and sitostanyl 
ferulate were the main components, followed by campesteryl ferulate and 
sitosteryl ferulate, whereas sitosterol was the main component in total sterols. 
Among the other samples, a byproduct of rice milling (pearling dust) was the 
best source of steryl ferulates, its total steryl ferulate content being 119 
mg/100 g, whereas no measurable amounts of steryl ferulates were measured in oat 
bran or pearling dust of barley. The results indicated that rye and wheat and 
especially their bran fractions are comparable to corn as steryl ferulate 
sources.

The amounts of quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol aglycons in 25 edible 
berries were analyzed by an optimized RP-HPLC method with UV detection and 
identified with diode array and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry 
detection. Sixteen species of cultivated berries and nine species of wild 
berries were collected in Finland in 1997. Quercetin was found in all berries, 
the contents being highest in bog whortleberry (158 mg/kg, fresh weight), 
lingonberry (74 and 146 mg/kg), cranberry (83 and 121 mg/kg), chokeberry (89 
mg/kg), sweet rowan (85 mg/kg), rowanberry (63 mg/kg), sea buckthorn berry (62 
mg/kg), and crowberry (53 and 56 mg/kg). Amounts between 14 and 142 mg/kg of 
myricetin were detected in cranberry, black currant, crowberry, bog 
whortleberry, blueberries, and bilberry. Kaempferol was detected only in 
gooseberries (16 and 19 mg/kg) and strawberries (5 and 8 mg/kg). Total contents 
of these flavonols (100-263 mg/kg) in cranberry, bog whortleberry, lingonberry, 
black currant, and crowberry were higher than those in the commonly consumed 
fruits or vegetables, except for onion, kale, and broccoli.

Effects of domestic processing and storage on the flavonols quercetin, 
myricetin, and kaempferol in five berries were studied using an optimized 
RP-HPLC method with UV and diode array detection after an acid hydrolysis of the 
corresponding glycosides. In fresh berries, the total content of flavonols was 
highest in lingonberry (169 mg/kg) and black currant (157 mg/kg), intermediate 
in bilberry (41 mg/kg) and strawberry (17 mg/kg), and lowest in red raspberry 
(9.5 mg/kg). Cooking strawberries with sugar to make jam resulted in minor 
losses (quercetin 15%, kaempferol 18%). During cooking of bilberries with water 
and sugar to make soup, 40% of quercetin was lost. Traditional preservation of 
crushed lingonberries in their own juice caused a considerable (40%) loss of 
quercetin. Only 15% of quercetin and 30% of myricetin present in unprocessed 
berries were retained in juices made by common domestic methods (steam-extracted 
black currant juice, unpasteurized lingonberry juice). Cold-pressing was 
superior to steam-extraction in extracting flavonols from black currants. During 
9 months of storage at 20 C, quercetin content decreased markedly (40%) in 
bilberries and lingonberries, but not in black currants or red raspberries. 
Myricetin and kaempferol were more susceptible than quercetin to losses during 
storage.

We evaluated the absorbability of anthocyanins in humans and rats administered 
with a beverage prepared from an extract of the tuber of purple sweet potato 
(Ipomoea batatas Cultivar Ayamurasaki), or with an anthocyanin concentrate. Two 
major anthocyanin components, cyanidin 
3-O-(2-O-(6-O-(E)-caffeoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside)-5-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside) 
and peonidin 
3-O-(2-O-(6-O-(E)-caffeoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside)-5-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside), 
were detected in the plasma and urine of both rats and humans by HPLC or liquid 
chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The plasma concentration of 
anthocyanins in humans reached a maximum 90 minutes after ingestion, and the 
recovery of anthocyanins in the urine was estimated as 0.01-0.03%. These results 
indicate that acylated anthocyanins could be selectively absorbed after 
ingesting food.

Purification of polar fractions from cacao liquor extracts gave 17 phenolics 
including four new compounds. The new compounds were characterized as a 
C-glycosidic flavan, an O-glycoside of a dimeric and two O-glycosides of 
trimeric A-linked proanthocyanidins, on the basis of spectroscopic data. 
Isolated polyphenols showed inhibitory effects on nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate-dependent lipid peroxidation in microsomes and on the 
autoxidation of linoleic acid. These effects were attributed to the 
radical-scavenging activity in the peroxidation chain reactions, based on the 
findings that the cacao polyphenols effectively scavenged the 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical.

Cassia bark or cortex cinnamomi, the dried stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia Presl. 
(Lauraceae), is a popular natural spice and a commonly used herb in traditional 
Chinese medicine. However, adulterants are frequently found in the market. In 
this study, 44 samples of Cassia bark including bark from seven related 
Cinnamomum species were collected from fields and market. Four characteristic 
components, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, and coumarin were 
determined by RP-HPLC, and a fingerprint comprised of five markers was 
established. These results showed that cassia barks contained high contents of 
cinnamaldehyde (13.01-56.93 mg/g). The highest content of cinnamaldehyde (up to 
93.83 mg/g) was found in debarked cortex, which is traditionally regarded as 
having the best quality in local herb shops. In contrast, the adulterants from 
the other Cinnamomum species, C. wilsonii Camble, C. japonicum Sieb., C. mairei 
Levl. and C. burmanii (Nees) Blume, contained low contents of cinnamaldehyde 
(<2.00 mg/g). The content of cinnamaldehyde in C. loureirii Nees was comparable 
to that in C. cassia. It is suggested that five characteristic peaks by HPLC are 
suitable for distinguishing genuine cassia bark from the adulterants and could 
be applied in the quality control of this commodity.

The antiradical activity of dry beans was evaluated in order to assess the 
validity of this test and to correlate the results with those achieved with the 
Folin-Ciocalteu method and with a rapid spectrophotometric method for the 
analysis of total flavonoids. Four landraces (12 samples) of common beans 
(Phaseolus vulgaris L.), collected in two regions of Italy (Tuscany and 
Basilicata) in three different years, were analyzed. The EC50 values ranged from 
39 to 2810 mg sample/mg 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazil radical. The phenolic 
content of each sample was expressed as gallic acid equivalents; it changed from 
1.17 to 4.40 mg/g. The flavonoid content, expressed as mg of (+)-catechin per g 
of dry seeds, ranged from 0.24 to 1.43 mg/g. The qualiquantitative composition 
of polyphenols has been also elucidated by means of high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC)-diode array detection and HPLC/MS. These investigations 
showed that rapid tests can contribute to assessing the quality of functional 
food.

Epidemiological studies suggest an inverse association between soy intake and 
prostate cancer (Pca) risk. We have previously observed that soy isoflavone 
genistein induces apoptosis and inhibits growth of both androgen-sensitive and 
androgen-independent Pca cells in vitro. To determine the clinical effects of 
soy isoflavones on Pca we conducted a pilot study in patients with Pca who had 
rising serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Patients with Pca were 
enrolled in the study if they had either newly diagnosed and untreated disease 
under watchful waiting with rising PSA (group I) or had increasing serum PSA 
following local therapy (group II) or while receiving hormone therapy (group 
III). The study intervention consisted of 100 mg of soy isoflavone (Novasoy) 
taken by mouth twice daily for a minimum of 3 or maximum of 6 mo. Forty-one 
patients were enrolled (4 in group I, 18 in group II, and 19 in group III) and 
had a median PSA level of 13.3 ng/ml. Thirty-nine patients could be assessed for 
response. Soy isoflavone supplementation was given for a median of 5.5 (range 
0.8-6) mo per patient. Although there were no sustained decreases in PSA 
qualifying for a complete or partial response, stabilization of the PSA occurred 
in 83% of patients in hormone-sensitive (group II) and 35% of hormone-refractory 
(group III) patients. There was a decrease in the rate of the rise of serum PSA 
in the whole group (P = 0.01) with rates of rise decreasing from 14 to 6% in 
group II (P = 0.21) and from 31 to 9% in group III (P = 0.05) following the soy 
isoflavone intervention. Serum genistein and daidzein levels increased during 
supplementation from 0.11 to 0.65 microM (P = 0.00002) and from 0.11 to 0.51 
microM (P = 0.00001), respectively. No significant changes were observed in 
serum levels of testosterone, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, or 5-OHmdU. These data suggest 
that soy isoflavones may benefit some patients with Pca.

Dietary supplements manufactured from red clover are widely marketed to provide 
the beneficial health effects of isoflavones without changing the original diet. 
In this study the metabolism of formononetin and biochanin A, the principal 
isoflavones of red clover, was studied in human subjects. Seven women ingested 
four red clover dietary supplements, and the metabolites of the isoflavones were 
identified in their urine samples. The structures of trimethylsilyl derivatives 
of the metabolites were established by GC-MS. New reduced metabolites of 
formononetin (dihydroformononetin and angolensin) and biochanin A 
(dihydrobiochanin A and 6'-hydroxyangolensin) were identified in urine samples 
using authentic reference compounds. Possible metabolic pathways are presented 
for the red clover isoflavones formononetin and biochanin A.

Soy isoflavones have recently gained considerable interest due to their possible 
health benefits. However, detailed studies on the metabolism of isoflavones are 
lacking. The aims of the investigation presented here were (1) to study the in 
vitro intestinal metabolism of isoflavones and their hydroxylated analogues 
3'-OH-daidzein, 6-OH-daidzein, 8-OH-daidzein, and 3'-OH-genistein and (2) to 
characterize the structures of some earlier identified urinary metabolites of 
soy isoflavones, for which no authentic reference compounds have been available. 
Isoflavone standards (1-2 mg) were fermented with human fecal flora (16.7%) for 
24 h. Metabolites formed during the fermentation were tentatively identified by 
interpretation of the mass spectra of trimethylsilylated compounds obtained by 
GC-MS. Compounds having hydroxyl groups at 5-position (i.e., genistein and 
3'-OH-genistein) were completely converted to metabolites that could not be 
detected by the methods used in this study. The metabolism of daidzein and its 
hydroxylated analogues, 3'-OH-daidzein, 6-OH-daidzein, and 8-OH-daidzein, 
occurred to a much lesser extent. Minor amounts of reduced metabolites (i.e., 
isoflavanones and alpha-methyldeoxybenzoins) of these compounds were tentatively 
identified in fermentation extracts. The retention times and the mass spectra of 
reduced isoflavone metabolites, obtained from in vitro fermentations of pure 
compounds, were utilized to identify unknown urinary metabolites of soy 
isoflavones. Four novel isoflavone metabolites were identified in human urine 
collected after soy supplementation: 3' '-OH-O-desmethylangolensin, 
3',4',7-trihydroxyisoflavanone, 4',7,8-trihydroxyisoflavanone, and 
4',6,7-trihydroxyisoflavanone.

Strawberries are known to contain antioxidants, but the significance of 
ingesting antioxidant-rich fruits remains to be established. In order to 
determine whether the consumption of strawberries impacted measures of in vivo 
antioxidant capacity, frozen strawberries (250 g) were administered daily for 3 
weeks to 21 healthy female volunteers. Compliance was confirmed by quantitating 
pelargonidin-glucuronide, urolithin A-glucuronide, and 
2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3-[(2)H]furanone-glucuronide in plasma and urine by 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and antioxidant capacity in serum 
measured by the increase in lag phase of low-density lipoprotein after copper 
sulfate exposure, DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes, and activity of phase II 
enzymes. Among these measures lipid peroxidation lag time increased by 20% (P < 
.01), whereas other measures did not change significantly. The potent 
antioxidant defenses in humans make determination of changes due to dietary 
ingestion in healthy individuals difficult. In summary, daily consumption of 
strawberries resulted in a modest but significant increase in antioxidant 
capacity in a healthy population.

We determined whether nine common herbs (basil, chili, cilantro, dill, garlic, 
ginger, lemongrass, oregano, and parsley) and one herb mixture (Italian Herbs) 
retain the antioxidant capacity (AC) and content of phenolics and characteristic 
marker compounds during processing to dry and paste forms. Oregano exhibited the 
highest AC among the herbs tested in dry and fresh forms. Compared with fresh 
herbs, the AC in dry form was decreased in garlic, chili, dill, oregano and 
parsley and paste form of oregano and basil. With the exception of dried garlic 
and lemongrass in fresh and paste form, all herbs in dry, paste, and fresh form 
contained significant AC. The AC was correlated significantly to the total 
phenolic content in both dry and fresh form. However, there was no significant 
correlation between the AC and the concentration of chemical marker compounds. 
In summary, processed herbs contribute significant amounts of AC to the diet.

The phenolic profile of strawberry fruits (Fragaria x ananassa Duch., Rosaceae) 
was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array 
detection. A peak displaying retention time and UV spectral data identical to 
those of phloridzin (phloretin 2'-O-beta-d-glucoside), a dihydrochalcone 
glucoside so far considered characteristic of apples, was monitored. For further 
characterization, crude extracts of strawberries were purified on polyamide, and 
the target compound was isolated by preparative and analytical HPLC. Structure 
elucidation was performed on the basis of APCI- and ESI-MS in the negative ion 
mode as well as by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy using authentic phloridzin for 
comparison. The d-configuration of the sugar moiety was established by HPLC 
analysis of the corresponding acyclic 
1-deoxy-1-(N-acetyl-alpha-methylbenzylamino)alditol acetate. Apart from its 
chemotaxonomic relevance, this first report on the occurrence of phloridzin in 
strawberries is of particular interest for the authenticity control of 
strawberry products such as juices, jams, and fruit preparations since 
phloridzin has so far been used for the detection of fraudulent admixtures.

The flavonoids, naringin and naringenin and the furanocoumarin, bergapten 
(5-methoxypsoralen), were detected in some fresh grapefruit and commercial 
grapefruit juices but were not detected in other fruit juices tested (orange; 
orange with apple base; dark grape; orange and mango with apple base; orange, 
peach, passion fruit juice). The contents of these three grapefruit constituents 
in commercial juice and fresh grapefruit varied from brand to brand and also 
from lot to lot. Juice was prepared from the fresh fruit via different methods 
(by hand, squeezer or blender). The naringin content, after hand-squeeze, ranged 
from 115 to 384 mg/l. With hand-squeeze juice production, bergapten was not 
detected (less than 0.5 mg/l) in two varieties of grapefruit, and naringenin was 
usually not in detectable levels (less than 2 mg/l) in three varieties. All 
three constituents were present in New Zealand grapefruit preparations 
(including juice by hand-squeeze) and different lots showed variation in content 
(1.5-, 2.3- and 4.7-fold for naringin, naringenin and bergapten, respectively). 
Differences in the concentrations of these three constituents, which have 
potential for drug interaction, may contribute to the variability in 
pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 drugs and some contradictory results of drug 
interaction studies with grapefruit juice.

Lignans, derived from flaxseed, are phyto-oestrogens being increasingly studied 
for their health benefits. An 8-week, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study was conducted in fifty-five hypercholesterolaemic 
subjects, using treatments of 0 (placebo), 300 or 600 mg/d of dietary 
secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) from flaxseed extract to determine the 
effect on plasma lipids and fasting glucose levels. Significant treatment 
effects were achieved (P < 0.05 to < 0.001) for the decrease of total 
cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and glucose concentrations, as well as 
their percentage decrease from baseline. At weeks 6 and 8 in the 600 mg SDG 
group, the decreases of TC and LDL-C concentrations were in the range from 22.0 
to 24.38 % respectively (all P < 0.005 compared with placebo). For the 300 mg 
SDG group, only significant differences from baseline were observed for 
decreases of TC and LDL-C. A substantial effect on lowering concentrations of 
fasting plasma glucose was also noted in the 600 mg SDG group at weeks 6 and 8, 
especially in the subjects with baseline glucose concentrations > or = 5.83 
mmol/l (lowered 25.56 and 24.96 %; P = 0.015 and P = 0.012 compared with 
placebo, respectively). Plasma concentrations of secoisolariciresinol (SECO), 
enterodiol (ED) and enterolactone were all significantly raised in the groups 
supplemented with flaxseed lignan. The observed cholesterol-lowering values were 
correlated with the concentrations of plasma SECO and ED (r 0.128-0.302; P < 
0.05 to < 0.001). In conclusion, dietary flaxseed lignan extract decreased 
plasma cholesterol and glucose concentrations in a dose-dependent manner.

Gallic acid is one of the main phenolic components of black tea. The objective 
of this study was to identify urinary gallic acid metabolites with potential for 
use as markers of black tea intake. In an initial study, nine compounds, 
assessed by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, were found to increase 
in concentration in urine after 3 cups of black tea over 3 h. A subsequent study 
employed a controlled crossover design in which 10 subjects consumed 5 cups per 
day of black tea or water for 4 weeks in random order. Twenty-four hour urine 
samples were collected at the end of each period. Of the 9 candidate compounds 
identified in the initial study, only 3 were present at higher concentrations in 
urine of all 10 subjects during tea-drinking in comparison to water-drinking 
periods. These compounds were identified as 4-O-methylgallic acid, 
3-O-methylgallic acid, and 3, 4-O-dimethylgallic acid, all methyl ether 
derivatives of gallic acid. It is suggested that these compounds have the 
potential to be used as markers of black tea intake.

Tea and coffee are rich in polyphenols with a variety of biological activities. 
Many of the demonstrated activities are consistent with favourable effects on 
the risk of chronic diseases. 4-O-methylgallic acid (4OMGA) and isoferulic acid 
are potential biomarkers of exposure to polyphenols derived from tea and coffee 
respectively. 4OMGA is derived from gallic acid in tea, and isoferulic acid is 
derived from chlorogenic acid in coffee. Our major objective was to explore the 
relationships of tea and coffee intake with 24 h urinary excretion of 4OMGA and 
isoferulic acid in human subjects. The relationships of long-term usual (111 
participants) and contemporaneously recorded current (344 participants) tea and 
coffee intake with 24 h urinary excretion of 4OMGA and isoferulic acid were 
assessed in two populations. 4OMGA was related to usual (r 0.50, P<0.001) and 
current (r 0.57, P<0.001) tea intake, and isoferulic acid was related to usual 
(r 0.26, P=0.008) and current (r 0.18, P<0.001) coffee intake. Overall, our 
present results are consistent with the proposal that 4OMGA is a good biomarker 
for black tea-derived polyphenol exposure, but isoferulic acid may be of limited 
usefulness as a biomarker for coffee-derived polyphenol exposure.

There is considerable interest in coloured fruits and berries as sources of 
biologically active anthocyanins. To examine the relationship between the oral 
dose and the amount excreted for anthocyanins from a food source across a 
physiological range of doses, volunteers were fed, in random order, four 
portions (100-400 g) of fresh strawberries as part of a standard breakfast. 
Urine was collected at 2 h intervals up to 8 h, and for the period 8-24 h. Fresh 
strawberries contained pelargonidin-3-glucoside as the major anthocyanin with 
smaller amounts of cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside. 
Anthocyanins were detected in the urine of all volunteers for all doses, 
predominantly as pelargonidin glucuronide and sulphate metabolites. There was a 
strong, linear relationship between oral dose and anthocyanin excretion 
(Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient = 0.692, p < 0.001, n = 40) 
which indicated that on an average, every additional unit of dose caused 0.0166 
units of excretion. Within individuals, dose -- excretion data fitted a linear 
regression model (median R(2) = 0.93). We conclude that strawberry anthocyanins 
are partially bioavailable in humans with a linear relationship between oral 
dose and urinary excretion for doses up to 400 g fresh fruit.

The effect of fruit maturation on changes in carotenoids, flavonoids, total 
soluble reducing equivalents, phenolic acids, ascorbic acid, and antioxidant 
activity (AOX) in different pepper types (Capsicum annuum, Capsicum frutescens, 
and Capsicum chinese) was determined. Generally, the concentration of these 
chemical constituents increased as the peppers reached maturity. Peppers 
contained high levels of L-ascorbic acid and carotenoids at maturity, 
contributing 124-338% of the RDA for vitamin C and 0.33-336 RE/100 g of 
provitamin A activity, respectively. Levels of phenolic acids, capxanthin, and 
zeaxanthin generally increased during maturation, whereas the level of lutein 
declined. Flavonoid concentrations varied greatly among the pepper types 
analyzed and were negatively correlated to AOX under the conditions of the 
beta-carotene-linoleic assay. Model systems were used to aid in understanding 
the relationship between flavonoids and AOX. Significant increases in AOX were 
observed in pepper juice models in response to increasing dilution factors and 
the presence of EDTA, indicating a pro-oxidant effect due to metal ions in the 
system. In vitro models demonstrated that increasing levels of flavonoids in 
combination with constant levels of caffeic and ascorbic acid gave a resultant 
AOX that was either additive of the two compounds or competitive in their 
ability to scavenge peroxyl radicals. The model systems were in good agreement 
with the chemical composition of the pepper cultivars and reflected the 
interactions affecting AOX. More research is needed to understand the complex 
interactions that occur among various antioxidants present in pepper extracts.

Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of 11 commercial cultivars and 
15 advanced breeding lines of spinach were determined over two growing seasons 
known to vary in biotic and abiotic stresses. Flavonoid composition and content 
of fall-grown commercial cultivars and advanced breeding lines were also 
determined. Over-winter spinach, which was planted in late fall and harvested in 
the spring, had much higher levels of total phenolics and antioxidant capacity 
than spinach planted in early fall and harvested in late fall, indicating that 
growing conditions, as well as biotic and abiotic stresses, influenced phenolic 
metabolism. Genotype also appeared to play an important role in affecting 
phenolic metabolism and antioxidant capacity in spinach. Advanced breeding lines 
of spinach, which show increased disease resistance, had higher levels of total 
phenolics, individual and total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity than 
commercial cultivars. Our results indicate that plant breeders can select for 
increased phenolic content to increase antioxidant capacity in spinach 
cultivars, or the crops can be grown in different seasons or under certain 
stress conditions to elevate levels of antioxidants.

Fresh blueberries were processed into sugar and sugar-free jams and stored for 6 
months at 4 and 25 degrees C. The jams were analyzed immediately after 
processing and over 6 months of storage for polyphenolic content, percent 
polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity. Processing resulted in losses of 
anthocyanins, procyanidins, chlorogenic acid, and ORAC in both jam types, but 
flavonols were well retained. Marked losses of anthocyanins and procyanidins 
occurred over 6 months of storage and were accompanied by increased polymeric 
color values. Chlorogenic acid levels also declined during storage, but 
flavonols and ORAC changed little. Jams stored at 4 degrees C retained higher 
levels of anthocyanins, procyanidins, and ORAC and had lower polymeric color 
values than jams stored at 25 degrees C. Sugar-free jams retained higher levels 
of anthocyanins and had lower polymeric color values than sugar jams late during 
storage. Blueberry jams should be refrigerated to better retain polyphenolics 
and antioxidant capacity.

Several recent reports have been published indicating that the antioxidant 
activity of olive oil and tea leaves is not stable over product shelf lives of 
about one year. We have measured the antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, 
flavan-3-ols monomers, and procyanidin levels in milk and dark chocolate, in 
cocoa powder, and in cocoa beans. Results show that for the cocoa products 
studied, antioxidant activity, and flavan-3-ol levels are stable over typical 
shelf lives of one year under controlled storage and over 2 years in ambient 
storage in the laboratory. We also show that 80 year old cocoa powder and 116 
year old cocoa beans still show very high levels of antioxidant activity and 
flavan-3-ol content.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of consumption of fermented and unfermented 
soy products on excretion of urinary isoflavonoid phytoestrogens and lignans in 
healthy men.
DESIGN: A randomized, crossover trial consisting of two 9-day feeding periods 
following 5 days of baseline data collection.
SUBJECTS: Healthy men, aged 20 to 40 years, were recruited from the University 
of Minnesota Twin Cities community. Of the 22 subjects who began the study, 17 
completed all feeding periods.
INTERVENTIONS: Fermented soy product (112 g tempeh) or unfermented soy (125 g 
soybean pieces) was consumed during each controlled feeding period.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Urine samples collected while subjects consumed their 
habitual diets and on the last 3 days of each feeding period were analyzed for 
isoflavonoid and lignan content by isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED: Comparisons of isoflavonoid and lignan excretion 
were analyzed using the general linear model procedure. Orthogonal contrasts 
were used to determine treatment differences of interest.
RESULTS: Urinary excretion of isoflavonoids (equol, O-desmethylangolensin 
[O-DMA], daidzein, genistein) was higher and excretion of lignans (enterodiol, 
enterolactone) was lower when subjects consumed soy-supplemented diets than when 
they consumed their habitual diets (P < .05). Urinary isoflavonoid excretion and 
lignan excretion were similar when subjects consumed tempeh and soybean pieces 
diets; however, recovery of daidzein and genistein was significantly higher when 
subjects consumed the tempeh diet than when they consumed the soybean pieces 
diet (P < .002). When fed soy, 5 of 17 subjects excreted high amounts of equol. 
These five subjects tended to excrete less O-DMA and daidzein than the 12 
subjects who excreted low amounts of equol (P < .06).
CONCLUSIONS: Fermentation of soy decreased the isoflavone content of the product 
fed but increased the urinary isoflavonoid recovery. This finding suggests that 
fermentation increases availability of isoflavones in soy.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of vegetable, fruit, and legume consumption on 
urinary isoflavonoid phytoestrogen and lignan excretion.
DESIGN: After 4 days of data collection, during which subjects consumed their 
habitual diets, subjects were randomly placed on four 9-day controlled 
experimental diets with each subject receiving each diet in a random order.
SUBJECTS: Seven men and three women, aged 20 to 35 years, were recruited from 
the University of Minnesota Twin Cities community.
INTERVENTIONS: All subjects consumed four experimental diets in an assigned 
random order: a controlled basal diet, a legume/allium diet (containing garbanzo 
beans, garlic, and onions), and diets low or high in vegetables and fruits 
(containing apples, pears, potatoes, and carrots).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Urine samples that were collected while subjects consumed 
their habitual diets and during the last 3 days of each feeding period were 
analyzed for isoflavonoid and lignan content using isotope dilution gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED: The effect of vegetable and fruit intake on 
urinary isoflavonoid and lignan excretion was analyzed using the general linear 
model procedure. Post hoc comparisons were made using Duncan's multiple range 
test.
RESULTS: Subjects excreted more of the lignan enterodiol on the high 
vegetable/fruit diet compared with the basal and legume/allium diets (P = .03); 
more of the isoflavonoids O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA), genistein, and sum of 
isoflavonoids on the legume/allium diet compared with the other controlled diets 
(P < .05); and more of the isoflavan equol on the basal and legume/allium diets 
compared with the high vegetable/fruit diet (P < .01). Subjects who excreted 
higher levels of equol on the basal and legume/allium diets also consumed more 
of the milk-based pudding provided as part of the controlled diets.
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary lignan and isoflavonoid excretion changed in response to 
alterations in vegetable, fruit, and legume intake under controlled dietary 
conditions.

Dietary estrogens, such as lignans, are similar in structure to endogenous sex 
steroid hormones and may act in vivo to alter hormone metabolism and subsequent 
cancer risk. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of dietary 
intake of a lignan-rich plant food (flaxseed) on urinary lignan excretion in 
postmenopausal women. This randomized, cross-over trial consisted of three 
7-week feeding periods during which 31 healthy postmenopausal women, ages 52-82 
years, consumed their habitual diets plus 0, 5, or 10 grams of ground flaxseed 
per day. Urine samples collected for 2 consecutive days during the last week of 
each feeding period were analyzed for lignan content (enterodiol, enterolactone, 
and matairesinol) by isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. 
Compared with the 0-gram flaxseed diet, consumption of 5 or 10 grams of flaxseed 
significantly increased excretion of enterodiol by 1,009 and 2,867 nmol/day, 
respectively; significantly increased excretion of enterolactone by 21,242 and 
52,826 nmol/day, respectively; and significantly increased excretion of total 
lignans (enterodiol + enterolactone + matairesinol) by 24,333 and 60,640 
nmol/day, respectively. Excretion of matairesinol was not significantly altered 
by flaxseed consumption. Consumption of flax, a significant source of dietary 
estrogens, in addition to their habitual diets increased excretion of enterodiol 
and enterolactone, but not matairesinol, in a dose-dependent manner in this 
group of postmenopausal women. Urinary excretion of lignan metabolites is a 
dose-dependent biomarker of flaxseed intake within the context of a habitual 
diet.

The study focused on the effects of processing and storage on the stability of 
flaxseed-derived secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) added to various bakery 
products. The SDG concentration of doughs, baked rye breads, graham buns, and 
muffins was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array 
detection; the baked products were analyzed immediately after baking and upon 
storage at room temperature for 1 week and at -25 degrees C for 1 and 2 months, 
respectively. Added SDG was found to withstand normal baking temperatures in all 
bakery products. SDG also was a relatively stable compound during storage. 
Similarly, the content of SDG in flax buns containing fat-free flaxseed meal was 
unaffected by storage. We conclude that cereal-based bakery products can be 
supplemented with flaxseed-derived SDG.

Peanut and its derivatives, especially peanut butter, are extensively consumed 
in many countries, mainly in the United States, which is also the major exporter 
of these products. trans-Resveratrol is present in peanuts, and recently this 
compound has been quantified in peanut butter. It is well-known that there are 
beneficial effects of trans-resveratrol and its glucoside, the piceid, in 
health. The absorption of trans-resveratrol has been proven in animals, and 
certain studies show that the absorption of some phenols is enhanced by 
conjugation with glucose, so that it could be possible that trans-piceid would 
be more absorbed than its aglycon (trans-resveratrol). In our work, we have 
identified the presence of trans-piceid in peanut butter with a new method to 
quantify trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid (3-beta-glucose of 
trans-resveratrol). This fact is very interesting because the glucosilated form 
could be more easily absorbed by the intestinal gut; in this way trans-piceid 
would exercise its beneficial function more efficiently than trans-resveratrol. 
To our knowledge, this is the first time that trans-piceid has been quantified 
in peanut butter. Resveratrol and piceid contents in natural peanut butters were 
found to be significantly higher than those in blended peanut butters.

Anthocyanins, kind of flavonoids (FL) found in plants and vegetables, are known 
to have varieties of physiological functions. In the present study, we examined 
absorption and metabolism of delphinidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside (Dp3G) in rats. 
Dp3G appeared in the plasma at 15 min after oral administration as an intact 
glucosidic form. The plasma level also showed another peak at 60 min. One 
metabolite peak was detected in the plasma and the structure was assigned as 
4'-O-methyl Dp3G (MDp3G) by NMR and MS. The metabolite was also identified in 
several tissues as a major metabolite especially in the liver. No 3'-O-methyl 
Dp3G was detected in any tissues, therefore, 4'-OH methylation is the main path 
of Dp3G metabolism in rats. This finding generalized the metabolic formation of 
FL having pyrogallol B ring because it has been reported that FL having catechol 
structure produced 3'-O-methyl-derivatives, but FL having pyrogallol structure 
produced 4'-O-methyl-derivatives.

We previously determined that five rather hydrophobic metabolites appeared in 
blood plasma after oral administration of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 
but a group of hydrophilic metabolites still remained unidentified. In the 
present study, 12 hydrophilic metabolites found were collected from urine and 
plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and then 
analyzed by tandem MS spectrometry. From the MS spectra, four metabolites out of 
12 were assigned as glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and six 
out of 12 were glucuronides of the primary metabolites of cyanidin 
3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside). 
Extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and O-methyl 
cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside showed their maximum plasma concentrations 
at 15 and 60 min (or 30 min) after oral administration, respectively. Their 
maximum plasma concentrations ranged from 15 to 70 nM. From the profile of 
urinary-excreted anthocyanins after intravenous administration, it was deduced 
that extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and O-methyl 
cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside were mainly produced in the liver rather 
than by intestinal flora. The area under the plasma concentration curve was 0.25 
micromol min/L for extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside 
and 0.14 micromol min/L for O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 
respectively, when evaluated as cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside equivalent, 
indicating that extended glucuronidation is a critical pathway in cyanidin 
3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside metabolism in rats.

To clarify how structural diversity of anthocyanins relates to their in vivo 
function, bioavailability was precisely studied in rats using bilberry 
(Vaccinium myrtillus L.) extract (Bilberon 25) as an anthocyanin source that 
contains 15 different anthocyanins. The bilberry extract was orally or 
intravenously administered to rats, and the plasma levels of each anthocyanin 
were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. As the result, all 
anthocyanins except peonidin 3-O-alpha-L-arabinoside were detectable in the 
blood plasma. The plasma concentration of anthocyanins as a whole reached the 
maximum level of 1.2 microM at 15 min after oral administration of 400 mg/kg 
bilberry extract (153.2 mg/kg as anthocyanins) and then decreased with time. 
Uptake and decay profiles of each anthocyanin in the plasma were almost the same 
for all anthocyanins except a few with their maximum after 30 min. Among the 
anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone, the plasma level after 15 min of oral 
administration was as follows: galactoside > glucoside > arabinoside. Plasma 
clearance of anthocyanins after intravenous administration clearly showed that 
arabinoside disappeared more rapidly than glucoside and galactoside. On the 
other hand, when anthocyanins carrying the same sugar moiety were compared, the 
half disappearance time of plasma anthocyanins was in the following order: 
delphinidin > cyanidin > petunidin = peonidin > malvidin. The bioavailability of 
anthocyanins was in the range of 0.61-1.82% and was 0.93% as the anthocyanin 
mixture. The bioavailability of anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone was in 
the following order: Galactoside showed the highest followed by glucoside and 
arabinoside for cyanidin and delphinidin, but arabinoside and galactoside showed 
a higher bioavailability than glucoside for petunidin and malvidin. Anthocyanins 
recovered in urine and bile during the first 4 h after intravenous 
administration were only 30.8 and 13.4%, respectively. Anthocyanin profiles in 
tissues were quite different from those in blood plasma. The major anthocyanins 
distributed in liver and kidney were the O-methyl anthocyanins such as peonidin, 
malvidin, and other O-methyl anthocyanins derived from delphinidin, cyanidin, 
and petunidin-glycosides.

Total and free phenolic contents of 16 commonly consumed fruits (comprising 9 
apples, 4 pears, and one each of peach, plum, and kiwi fruit cultivars) were 
measured by Folin-Ciocalteu assay. Total phenol contents varied from 272 to 475 
mg of CtE/100 g of fresh weight. Of the apple cultivars studied, Braeburn and 
Empire had the highest and lowest total phenol content, respectively. The apple 
cultivars ranked in the following decreasing order: Braeburn > Red Delicious > 
Crisp Pink > Granny Smith > Royal Gala > Bramley > Golden Delicious > Fuji > 
Empire. Among pear cultivars, the order was Forelle > Taylor's > Peckham's > 
Conference. Peach and plum equally had high contents. The percentage of 
conjugated phenolics ranged between 3 (Red Delicious) and 77% (Empire) of the 
total phenols. Comparison of different cultivars of the same fruit and between 
different fruits showed broad variations in both phenolic content and in vitro 
antioxidant activity; a weak correlation (R(2) = 0.58) was observed between the 
phenolic content of the fruits and the total antioxidant activity, as estimated 
by the FRAP assay. The calculated dietary intake of total, free, and conjugated 
phenols from average per capita consumption of apples and pears in different 
regions of the U.K. varied between 104-126, 53-64, and 51-62 mg of CtE/day, 
respectively.

Fresh aerial parts of different chicory varieties: green chicory (c.v. 
""Catalogna""), two red chicory varieties (""radicchio rosso di Chioggia"" and 
""radicchio rosso di Treviso""), and Witloof or Belgian endive were analyzed by 
HPLC/DAD/MS. The chromatographic fingerprint was diagnostic for each variety. A 
monocaffeoyl tartaric acid, chlorogenic acid, and chicoric acid were detected in 
all the varieties, while cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-(6'' malonyl) 
glucoside, and cyanidin 3-O-(6'' malonyl) glucoside were the main phenolic 
compounds in the red varieties. The flavonoidic compounds, quercetin 
3-O-glucuronide and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide, were absent in the Witloof sample. 
The phenolic compounds from total leaves were the same as those obtained from 
only the colored parts; nevertheless, the total amount was remarkably lower with 
a decrease of up to 80% for Belgian endive. Chemical stability at high 
temperature was observed for the phenolic fraction from the green variety after 
decoction at 100 degrees C for 30 min.

Polyphenolic content and radical-scavenging activities (RSA) of four sweet 
potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) cultivars were characterized after storage at 
optimal (15 degrees C) or low temperature (5 degrees C) for 0, 13, 26, and 37 
days. The polyphenolic content increased during storage in three cultivars but 
not in 'Murasakimasari'. The change in 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl 
radical-scavenging activity (DPPH-RSA) correlated very well with polyphenolic 
content. The increases in polyphenolics and the RSA in 'Benimasari' were 
significantly greater during storage at 5 degrees C than at 15 degrees C. The 
main polyphenolic components in all cultivars were chlorogenic acid (ChA) and 
3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (3,5-diCQA). ChA level increased more at 5 degrees 
C than at 15 degrees C, whereas that of 3,5-diCQA was greater at 15 degrees C. 
Caffeoylquinic acids and RSA in 'Murasakimasari', which contains a large amount 
of anthocyanin in flesh tissue, were extremely high at the beginning of storage 
and remained nearly constant or decreased over time. A non-caffeoylquinic acid 
component that increased during storage, especially in 'J-Red' at 15 degrees C, 
was purified by successive chromatographic steps. The isolate was identified as 
caffeoyl sucrose [CSu, 6-O-caffeoyl-(beta- 
d-fructofuranosyl-(2-->1))-alpha-D-glucopyranoside] by fast atom 
bombardment-mass spectroscopy (FAB-MS), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). These results suggest that storage under 
cultivar-dependent, controlled temperature is one approach for increasing 
desirable physiologic function associated with RSA of polyphenolic compounds in 
sweet potato roots.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the absorption of a citrus flavonoid, 
naringin, as its glycosylated form. Six healthy volunteers (three males and 
three females) were studied. After a single oral administeration of 500 mg of 
naringin, intact naringin was isolated from 2-4 h urine. Isolated naringin was 
identified by the LC/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), MS/MS, 
and MS/MS/MS techniques. The cumulative urinary excretion of naringin and its 
metabolites (naringenin and naringenin glucuronides) was determined by HPLC for 
0-24 h. Approximately 0.02% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as 
unchanged naringin, whereas urinary recoveries of naringenin and naringenin 
glucuronides were approximately 0.4 and 3.6% of the administered dose, 
respectively. It was concluded that trace amounts of orally administered 
naringin can be absorbed as the glycoside. However, it is not clear whether the 
glycoside is cleaved before or after absorption to generate naringenin.

Sterol ferulate, free sterol, and 5-alk(en)ylresorcinol constituents of wheat, 
rye, and corn bran oils were studied. Among the sterol ferulates, one novel 
compound, 24-methylenecholestanol ferulate (7), along with six known compounds, 
namely, 24-methylcholestanol ferulate (1), 24-methylcholesterol ferulate (2), 
2-methyllathosterol ferulate (3), stigmastanol ferulate (4), sitosterol ferulate 
(5), and schottenol ferulate (6), were isolated and characterized. Five known 
free sterols, namely, 24-methylcholesterol (8), stigmastanol (9), sitosterol 
(10), schottenol (11), and stigmasterol (12), were isolated and identified. 
5-Alk(en)ylresorcinols were found in wheat and rye bran oils but not in corn 
bran oil. Of these, one new compound, 5-n-(2'-oxo-14'-Z-heneicosenyl) resorcinol 
(19), and seven known compounds, namely, 5-n-heptadecyl- (13), 5-n-nonadecyl- 
(14), 5-n-heneicosyl- (15), 5-n-tricosyl- (16), 5-n-pentacosyl- (17), 
5-n-(14'-Z-nonadecenyl)- (18), and 5-n-(2'-oxoheneicosyl)resorcinols (20), were 
isolated and characterized. These compounds were evaluated with respect to their 
inhibitory effects on the induction of Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) 
by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells, which is known to 
be a primary screening test for antitumor promoters. Four compounds, 1, 2, 4, 
and 11, showed potent inhibitory effects on EBV-EA induction.

Methods were developed for the analysis of natural antioxidants including 
phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beverages and plant extracts using gradient 
HPLC with multi-channel electrochemical coulometric detection. Suitability of 
various reversed-phase columns for this purpose was compared; pH and mobile 
phase gradients were optimized with respect to the separation selectivity and 
sensitivity of detection. Because of different target compounds in various 
sample types, the overlapping resolution maps and the normalized resolution 
product approaches described earlier were used to select optimum columns and 
gradients to suit the analysis of the individual sample types. The methods were 
applied to the analysis of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beer, wine, tea, 
and yacon extracts. 32 phenolic compounds were identified and determined, 
including derivatives of benzoic and cinnamic acids, flavones, and a few related 
glycosides. Eight-channel CoulArray detection offers high selectivity and 
sensitivity with limits of detection in the low microg L(-1) range, at least an 
order of magnitude lower than single-channel coulometric detection using the 
Coulochem detector. No special sample pretreatment is necessary and, because of 
the compatibility of the CoulArray detector with gradient elution, phenolic 
antioxidants of different polarities can be determined in a single run. In 
addition to the retention times, the ratios of the areas of the pre-dominant and 
post-dominant peaks to the area of the dominant peak can be used for improved 
identification of natural antioxidants.

Commercially available curcumin, a bright orange-yellow color pigment of 
turmeric, consists of a mixture of three curcuminoids, namely, curcumin, 
demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin. These were isolated by column 
chromatography and identified by spectroscopic studies. The purity of the 
curcuminoids was analyzed by an improved HPLC method. HPLC separation was 
performed on a C(18) column using three solvents, methanol, 2% AcOH, and 
acetonitrile, with detection at 425 nm. Four different commercially available 
varieties of turmeric, namely, Salem, Erode, Balasore, and local market samples, 
were analyzed to detect the percentage of these three curcuminoids. The 
percentages of curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin as 
estimated using their calibration curves were found to be 1.06 +/- 0.061 to 5.65 
+/- 0.040, 0.83 +/- 0.047 to 3.36 +/- 0.040, and 0.42 +/- 0.036 to 2.16 +/-

curcuminoids are 2.34 +/- 0.171 to 9.18 +/- 0.232%.

It has been shown that thermal processing of tomatoes and sweet corn results in 
increased antioxidant activities despite the loss of vitamin C. Until now, it is 
unclear whether this positive effect of thermal processing occurs with all crop 
produce. Therefore, analysis of a root vegetable (beets) and of a legume (green 
beans) was undertaken to address this question. Antioxidant activity of beets 
processed under typical commercial processing conditions remained constant 
despite an 8% loss of vitamin C, a 60% loss of color, and 30% loss of dietary 
folate. There was a slight but significant 5% increase in phenolic content of 
processed beets. In contrast, vitamin C and dietary folate content of green 
beans remained constant, whereas a 32% reduction in phenolic compounds occurred 
after typical commercial processing conditions. The antioxidant activity of 
green beans was reduced by 20%. These findings along with previous works suggest 
that the effects of thermal processing vary with the respective produce crop 
type. It also reinforces the concept that optimal health benefits may be 
achieved when a wide variety of plant foods (fruits, vegetables and whole 
grains) and preparation methods are incorporated into the diet.

The metabolic fate of the dietary isoflavones daidzein and genistein was 
investigated in human volunteers challenged with soya. Urinary diphenols, 
isolated by partition chromatography on Sephadex LH-20, were characterized and 
identified by profile capillary gas chromatography (GC) and electron ionization 
mass spectrometry (GC-EIMS) analysis of the trimethylsilyl ether (TMS) 
derivatives. Novel isoflavonic phytoestrogens found in the urine of volunteers 
were those of tetrahydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, 
6'-hydroxy-O-demethylangolesin and 2-dehydro-O-demethylangolensin. Other known 
diphenols identified were those of equal, dehydrodaidzein, O-demethylangolensin, 
daidzein, genistein, glycitein, and the lignan enterolactone. Two other urinary 
isomers with a fragmentation pattern closely resembling that of the persilylated 
TMS ethers of cis/trans-isomers of tetrahydrodaidzein, were characterized based 
on the elucidation of fragments associated with the loss of a non-phenolic-OTMS 
functional group in ring-C. These are fragments presented in the persilylated 
mass spectra of isoflavan-4-ols and isoflav-3-ene-4-ols, demonstrated here by a 
combination of simple and tandem mass spectrometry study of the deuterated 
persilylated TMS ethers of dihydrodaidzein. In a similar study we also present 
the data on the structural identification and fragment elucidation of the 
keto/enol tautomers of the TMS ether derivatives of the dihydro derivatives of 
daidzein and genistein, observed in the urine of volunteers and considered 
probable products of the derivatization process. Finally, the GC and GC-MS data 
of two unknown isoflavonoids and that of a lignan-like compound are presented 
together with those of dihydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, tetrahydrodaidzein and 
2-dehydro-O-demethylangolensin. The latter four were obtained here as products 
of small scale chemical synthesis in a preliminary study on the tentative 
identification of urinary isoflavonoids in human volunteers challenged with 
soya.

A method was developed for the analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside 
(SDG) in flaxseeds. The analytical method involves extraction of defatted 
flaxseed flour with dioxane/ethanol, aqueous base-hydrolysis, solid-phase 
purification of an SDG-containing fraction, and quantitative analysis by 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Pure SDG was isolated from 
flaxseed using different column chromatographic methods and used, as external 
standard, for the calibration of the method and for quantification. The method 
was then applied to study the variation in SDG content in flaxseeds from 14 
cultivars grown in Sweden and 15 cultivars grown in Denmark. The SDG content 
varied between 11.7 and 24.1 mg/g in defatted flaxseed flour and between 6.1 and 
13.3 mg/g in whole flaxseeds.

A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separation method with 
photo-diode array (PDA) and mass spectrometric (MS) detection was developed to 
determine and quantify flavonols, flavones, and flavanones in fruits, vegetables 
and beverages. The compounds were analysed as aglycones, obtained after acid 
hydrolysis of freeze-dried food material. Identification was based on retention 
time, UV and mass spectra by comparison with commercial standards, and the UV 
peak areas were used for quantitation of the flavonoid contents. Examples of 
HPLC-MS, analyses of orange pulp, tomato, and apple are presented. The method 
has been used to screen foods on the Danish market, and the contents of 
flavones, flavonols, and flavanones were measured.

A field experiment and two oxidation experiments in the laboratory were carried 
out. The content of the major anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-G) and 
cyanidin-3-sambubioside (Cy-3-Sa), in the fresh fruits from the 13 cultivars 
were from 361 to 1266 and from 269 to 656 mg/100 g, respectively. The two minor 
anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-sambubioside-5-glucoside (Cy-3-Sa-5-G) and 
cyanidin-3.5-diglucoside (Cy-3.5-dG), occurred in concentrations between 5 and 
47 mg/100 g. The content of ascorbic acid and quercetin in the fresh fruits of 
the cultivars varied from 6 to 25, and from 29 to 60 mg/100 g, respectively. 
Purging of the elderberry juice with N2 and/or addition of ascorbic acid reduced 
the oxidative degradation rate of the two major anthocyanins and quercetin. 
Ascorbic acid protected the anthocyanins, but not quercetin from oxidative 
degradation. Mixing of fruits with air during processing and even a low content 
of oxygen in the juice before tapping must be avoided by appropriate steps 
during processing. Improvement of the nutritional value of the elderberry juice 
and increased protection of anthocyanins against oxidative degradation may 
potentially be obtained by selection of cultivars with a high content of 
ascorbic acid.

The antioxidative activity of a total of 92 phenolic extracts from edible and 
nonedible plant materials (berries, fruits, vegetables, herbs, cereals, tree 
materials, plant sprouts, and seeds) was examined by autoxidation of methyl 
linoleate. The content of total phenolics in the extracts was determined 
spectrometrically according to the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure and calculated as 
gallic acid equivalents (GAE). Among edible plant materials, remarkable high 
antioxidant activity and high total phenolic content (GAE > 20 mg/g) were found 
in berries, especially aronia and crowberry. Apple extracts (two varieties) 
showed also strong antioxidant activity even though the total phenolic contents 
were low (GAE < 12.1 mg/g). Among nonedible plant materials, high activities 
were found in tree materials, especially in willow bark, spruce needles, pine 
bark and cork, and birch phloem, and in some medicinal plants including heather, 
bog-rosemary, willow herb, and meadowsweet. In addition, potato peel and 
beetroot peel extracts showed strong antioxidant effects. To utilize these 
significant sources of natural antioxidants, further characterization of the 
phenolic composition is needed.

Thirty-seven plant organs, traditionally used as drugs, collected in Pakistan, 
were extracted with 70% acetone and analyzed for their total phenolics 
concentration and antioxidant potential. Seven extracts showed more than 85% 
inhibition of lipid peroxidation in vitro as compared with blank. Butylated 
hydroxytoluene (BHT) (IC50 = 233.6 microg/l +/- 28.3) was the strongest 
antioxidant in our test system. The IC50 results indicate that the extracts of 
Nymphaea lotus L. flowers, Acacia nilotica (Linn.) Delile beans, Terminalia 
belerica Roxb. fruits, and Terminalia chebula Retz. (fruits, brown) were 
stronger antioxidants than alpha-tocopherol, while Terminalia chebula Retz. 
(fruit coat), Terminalia chebula Retz. (fruits, black) and Ricinus communis L. 
leaves were weaker antioxidant extracts than alpha-tocopherol and BHT. Total 
phenolics concentration, expressed as gallic acid equivalents, showed close 
correlation with the antioxidant activity. High performance liquid 
chromatographic analysis with diode array detection at 280 nm, of the seven 
extracts indicated the presence of hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, 
hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, flavonol aglycones and their glycosides as 
main phenolics compounds. This information, based on quick screening methods, 
enables us to proceed towards more detailed chemical and pharmacological 
understanding of these plant materials.

Focusing on 17 constituents, the polyphenol profiles of juices freshly made from 
various dessert (n = 4) and cider apple cultivars (n = 7) as well as 
commercially available apple juices (n = 24) were investigated using 
high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection (HPLC-DAD) and 
(HPLC)-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI(neg)-MS/MS) 
analyses. Significant differences in the total polyphenol content as well as the 
profiles of the apple cultivars under study were observed. For dessert apples 
the total polyphenol content ranged from 154 to 178 mg/L, whereas for 'old' 
German cider apple cultivars 261-970 mg/L were determined. Boskoop showed the 
highest (970 mg/L) and Granny Smith the lowest (154 mg/L) polyphenol content of 
the freshly prepared samples under study. Hydroxycinnamic acids, with 
chlorogenic acid as dominating constituent, ranged from 57 to 68 mg/L as well as 
from 134-593 mg/L in juices made from dessert apples and that from cider apples, 
respectively. Dessert apple juices showed lower contents of dihydrochalcones 
(10-35 mg/L) and flavan-3-ols (50-95 mg/L) compared to that of cider apples 
(34-171 mg/L and 70-393 mg/L, respectively). Quercetin and its derivatives were 
found from 0.4-4 mg/L and 0.4-27 mg/L in juices made from dessert apples and 
that of cider apples, respectively. Compared with freshly made juices, lower 
contents of polyphenols were determined in the commercial samples under study. 
Amounts ranging from 110-459 mg/L, dominated by chlorogenic acid with 
concentrations from 53-217 mg/L, were determined. Information about 
cultivar-typical apple polyphenol content and profile is important for 
bioactivity studies and, consequently, essential for the development of 
consumer-relevant products with particular nutritional functionalities.

Fresh strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.), raspberries (Rubus idaeus 
Michx.), highbush blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum L.), and lowbush blueberries 
(Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton) were stored at 0, 10, 20, and 30 degrees C for 
up to 8 days to determine the effects of storage temperature on whole fruit 
antioxidant capacity (as measured by the oxygen radical absorbing capacity 
assay, Cao et al., Clin. Chem. 1995, 41, 1738-1744) and total phenolic, 
anthocyanin, and ascorbate content. The four fruit varied markedly in their 
total antioxidant capacity, and antioxidant capacity was strongly correlated 
with the content of total phenolics (0.83) and anthocyanins (0.90). The 
antioxidant capacity of the two blueberry species was about 3-fold higher than 
either strawberries or raspberries. However, there was an increase in the 
antioxidant capacity of strawberries and raspberries during storage at 
temperatures >0 degrees C, which was accompanied by increases in anthocyanins in 
strawberries and increases in anthocyanins and total phenolics in raspberries. 
Ascorbate content differed more than 5-fold among the four fruit species; on 
average, strawberries and raspberries had almost 4-times more ascorbate than 
highbush and lowbush blueberries. There were no ascorbate losses in strawberries 
or highbush blueberries during 8 days of storage at the various temperatures, 
but there were losses in the other two fruit species. Ascorbate made only a 
small contribution (0.4-9.4%) to the total antioxidant capacity of the fruit. 
The increase observed in antioxidant capacity through postharvest phenolic 
synthesis and metabolism suggested that commercially feasible technologies may 
be developed to enhance the health functionality of small fruit crops.

Olive oil and fruit samples from six cultivars sampled at four different 
maturity stages were discriminated into cultivars and maturity stages. The 
variables-volatile and phenolic compounds-that significantly (p < 0.01) 
discriminated cultivars and maturity stage groups were identified. Separation by 
stepwise linear discriminant analysis revealed that Manzanilla olive cultivar 
was separated from cultivars Leccino, Barnea, Mission, Corregiola, and Paragon, 
whereas cultivars Corregiola and Paragon formed a cluster. The volatile 
compounds hexanol, hexanal, and 1-penten-3-ol were responsible for the 
discrimination of cultivars. All maturity stages were discriminated, with the 
separation of early stages attributed to oil phenolic compounds, tyrosol and 
oleuropein derivatives, whereas the volatile compounds (E)-2-hexenal, hexanol, 
1-penten-3-ol, and (Z)-2-penten-3-ol characterized the separation of all 
maturity stages and in particular the late stages. Hexanol and 1-penten-3-ol 
characterized the separation of both cultivars and maturity stages.

Virgin olive oils produced at wide ranges of malaxation temperatures (15, 30, 
45, and 60 degrees C) and times (30, 60, 90, and 120 min) in a complete 
factorial experimental design were discriminated with stepwise linear 
discriminant analysis (SLDA) revealing differences with processing conditions. 
Virgin olive oils produced at 15 and 60 degrees C for 30 min showed the most 
significant (p < 0.01) differences. Discrimination was based upon volatile and 
phenolic compounds detected in olive oils, peroxide value (PV), free fatty acids 
(FFA), ultraviolet (UV) absorbances, and oil yield. There were different 
discriminating variables for processing conditions illustrating the dependence 
of virgin olive oil quality on malaxation time and temperature. Volatile 
compounds were the dominant discriminating variables. Common oxidation 
indicators of olive oil (PV, K232, and K270) were not among the variables that 
significantly (p < 0.01) changed with malaxation time and temperature. Variables 
that discriminated both malaxation time and temperature were hexanal, 
3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ethyl alcohol-decarboxymethyl elenolic acid dialdehyde 
(3,4-DHPEA-DEDA) and FFA, whereas 1-penten-3-ol, E-2-hexenal, octane, tyrosol, 
and vanillic acid significantly (p < 0.01) changed with temperature only and 
Z-2-penten-1-ol, (+)-acetoxypinoresinol, and oil yield changed with time only. 
Virgin olive oil quality was significantly influenced by malaxation temperature, 
whereas oil yield discriminated malaxation time. This study demonstrates the two 
modes of hexanal formation: enzymatic and nonenzymatic during virgin olive oil 
extraction.

It is unknown whether the bioavailability of isoflavones is affected by the 
concomitant ingestion of glucosides or aglycones. This study was designed to 
investigate the effects of soymilk-based beverages containing different types of 
isoflavones on their absorption, excretion, and metabolism. Twelve healthy 
volunteers consumed 3 kinds of soymilk: untreated soymilk, 
beta-glucosidase-treated soymilk, and fermented soymilk. Blood samples were 
collected after 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 24 h. Urine samples were 
collected from 0 to 48 h. Concentrations of isoflavones and daidzein metabolites 
in serum and urine were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
After the ingestion of soymilk, the total concentration of isoflavones in serum 
rose slowly and reached a maximum of 0.94 +/- 0.39 micromol/L at 6.0 +/- 1.2 h. 
However, beta-glucosidase-treated soymilk and fermented soymilk increased the 
serum isoflavone concentration significantly more quickly with maximum 
concentrations at 1.0 h of 1.75 +/- 0.33 micromol/L and 2.05 +/- 0.32 
micromol/L, respectively. The urinary excretion of isoflavones after ingesting 
of these aglycone-enriched preparations was significantly greater than after 
consumption of untreated soymilk up to 8 h after injection, but not thereafter. 
The total and individual concentrations of isoflavones in serum and urine did 
not differ when subjects consumed the 2 aglycone-enriched soymilks. However, in 
equol producers (n = 5), the ingestion of ESM tended to increase urinary 
excretion of equol compared with the consumption of FSM (P = 0.08). These 
results demonstrated that the isoflavone aglycones of soymilk were absorbed 
faster and in greater amounts than their glucosides in healthy adults and that 
the metabolism of isoflavones might be affected by the type of soymilk consumed.

The polyphenolics of raisins were extracted, separated by HPLC, and 
characterized by their UV-vis spectra, and their concentrations measured. Color 
measurements and browning indices were also determined. Samples (n = 20) 
included sun-dried, dipped, and golden raisins. Comparisons were also made with 
fresh and frozen Thompson Seedless grapes. Golden raisins (which are treated 
with SO(2)) had the highest amount of hydroxycinnamic acids and the highest 
lightness values. In comparison with fresh grapes, percent losses of the two 
major hydroxycinnamics (caftaric and coutaric acids) in sun-dried, dipped, and 
golden raisins were on the order of 90%. Flavonols were not influenced by 
processing as much as hydroxycinnamics, while procyanidins and flavan-3-ols were 
completely degraded in all raisin samples. Formation of hydroxymethylfurfural 
and loss of amino acids in sun-dried and dipped raisins are ascribed to Maillard 
browning reactions.

This study was designed to determine the total phenols (TP) and total 
antioxidant activity (TAA) of some liquid and solid plant foods that are 
commonly consumed in Turkey. Total phenols were analysed according to the 
Folin-Ciocalteu method and antioxidant activities of these compounds in aqueous 
phase were assessed by measuring their direct ABTS.- radical scavenging 
abilities. Total phenols varied from 68 to 4162 mg/l for liquid foods and from 
735 to 3994 mg/kg for solid foods. TAA of liquid and solid foods ranged between 
0.61-6.78 mM and 0.63-8.62 mM, respectively. Total antioxidant activities of 
foods were well correlated with total phenols (r2 = 0.95). According to content

The bioavailability of polyphenols in human and rodents has been discussed 
regarding their biological activity. We found different metabolite profiles of 
quercetin in rat plasma between two administration procedures. A single 
intragastric administration (50 mg/kg) resulted in the appearance of a variety 
of metabolites in the plasma, whereas only a major fraction was detected by free 
access (1% quercetin). The methylated/non-methylated metabolites ratio was much 
higher in the free access group. Mass spectrometric analyses showed that the 
fraction from free access contained highly conjugated quercetin metabolites such 
as sulfo-glucuronides of quercetin and methylquercetin. The metabolite profile 
of human plasma after an intake of onion was similar to that with intragastric 
administration in rats. In vitro oxidation of human low-density lipoprotein 
showed that methylation of the catechol moiety of quercetin significantly 
attenuated the antioxidative activity. These results might provide information 
about the bioavailability of quercetin when conducting animal experiments.

In the present study we investigated the metabolic conversion of cyanidin 
glycosides in human subjects using solid-phase extraction,HPLC-diode array 
detector, MS, GC, and enzymic techniques. Volunteers consumed approximately 20 g 
chokeberry extract containing 1.3 g cyanidin 3-glycosides (899 mg cyanidin 
3-galactoside, 321 mg cyanidin 3-arabinoside, 51 mg cyanidin 3-xyloside and 50 
mg cyanidin 3-glucoside). Blood samples were drawn at 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h 
post-consumption of the extract. Urine samples were also collected at 0, 4-5,and 
22-24h. We have confirmed that human subjects have the capacity to metabolise 
cyanidin 3-glycosides, as we observed at least ten individual anthocyanin 
metabolites in the urine and serum. Average concentrations of anthocyanins and 
anthocyanin metabolites in the urine reached levels of 17.9 (range 14.9-20.9) 
l.mol/l within 5 h post-consumption and persisted in 24h urine samples at levels 
of 12.1 (range 11.1-13.0) nmol/l. In addition, average total levels of 
anthocyanins and anthocyanin metabolites detected in the serum were observed at 
5917 (range 197.3-986.1) nmol/ within 2h post-consumption. Cyanidin 
3-galactoside accounted for 55.4% (9.9(range 7-2-12-6) l.mol/) and 66.0% (390.6 
(range 119.4-661-9) nmol V) of the detected anthocyanins in the urine and serum 
samples,respectively. The metabolites were identified as glucuronide conjugates, 
as well as methylated and oxidised derivatives of cyanidin 3-galactoside and 
cyanidin glucuronide. Conjugation probably affects the biological activity of 
anthocyanins and these metabolic products are likely in part responsible for the 
reported health benefits associated with the consumption of anthocyanins.

Anthocyanins are reported to have many ""health promoting"" properties; however, 
despite numerous reports of their bioactivities, their absorption and metabolism 
in humans are poorly understood. The objective of this research was to detail 
the pharmacokinetic parameters of anthocyanins after the administration of a 
721-mg oral dose of cyanidin 3-glycosides from chokeberry extract to human 
subjects. Solid-phase extraction, preparative-HPLC, preparative-TLC, HPLC-diode 
array detection, HPLC-MS, and NMR were utilized to isolate, identity, and 
quantify anthocyanins in 0- to 7-h (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 h) serum and 0- to 
24-h urine samples (total individual urine voids over 24 h). The cumulative 
concentration of total anthocyanins (parent and metabolites) detected in the 
serum (0-7 h) was 376.65 +/- 16.20 (nmol x h)/L (area under the concentration 
time curve), reaching a maximum concentration (C(max) = 96.08 +/- 6.04 nmol/L) 
within 2.8 h. The parent anthocyanins represented only 32.0% [120.63 +/- 2.85 
(nmol x h)/L] of the total anthocyanins detected with 68.0% [256.02 +/- 5.23 
(nmol x h) identified as conjugated metabolites. Additionally, the total urinary 
excretion of anthocyanins over 24 h was 1071.54 +/- 375.46 microg, reaching a 
maximal rate of excretion (R(max) = 202.74 +/- 85.06 microg/h) at 3.72 +/- 0.83 
h. Parallel to the serum data, only 32.5% (347.85 +/- 60.61 microg) of the 
anthocyanins excreted in the urine (total 24 h) were the parent compounds with 
67.5% (723.69 +/- 92.59 microg) occurring as conjugated metabolites. The 
metabolites were identified as glucuronidated and methylated derivatives of the 
parent cyanidin 3-glycosides. The above results indicate that cyanidin 
3-glycosides are rapidly absorbed and metabolized extensively following a 
moderate-to-high oral dose in humans.

The influence of different types of winemaking technology on the contents of 
catechins, proanthocyanidins, and anthocyanins in Tinta Miúda red wines was 
studied. The Tinta Miúda red wines were made by fermentation with carbonic 
maceration, fermentation with stem contact, and fermentation without stem 
contact, respectively. The analysis of individual catechins, procyanidins, and 
anthocyanins in these wines was performed by HPLC, and quantification of total 
catechins, total oligomeric proanthocyanidins, total polymeric 
proanthocyanidins, and total anthocyanins was carried out by spectrophotometric 
methods. The wine made by carbonic maceration contained the highest amounts of 
both catechins and oligomeric and polymeric proanthocyanidins, followed by the 
wine made by fermentation with stem contact, whereas the wine made by 
fermentation without stem contact contained the lowest of these compounds. On 
the other hand, the concentrations of total anthocyanins and nearly all 
individual anthocyanins in the carbonic maceration wine were lower than those in 
the wines made by fermentation with stem contact and fermentation without stem 
contact. These results indicated that, although the carbonic maceration 
technique could retain higher amounts of catechins and proanthocyanidins in 
wine, it did not favor retaining or stabilizing anthocyanins in wine.

soy or pea protein concentrate on nutrient digestibility and performance of 
young pigs.

An experiment was conducted to compare different dietary vegetable sources of 
starch and protein on the coefficient of apparent total tract digestibility 
(CATTD) of energy and nutrients and performance of piglets from 29 to 60 d of 
age. The experiment was completely randomized with 6 treatments arranged 
factorially with 3 sources of starch (cooked-flaked corn, cooked-flaked rice, 
and pea starch) and 2 sources of protein [soy protein concentrate (SPC) and pea 
protein concentrate (PPC)]. The pea starch and the PPC used were obtained by 
dehulling and grinding pea seeds to a mean particle size of 30 microm. Each 
treatment was replicated 6 times (6 pigs per pen). For the entire experiment, 
piglets fed cooked rice had greater ADG than piglets fed pea starch with piglets 
fed cooked corn being intermediate (471, 403, and 430 g/d, respectively; P < 
0.05). Protein source did not have any effect on piglet performance. The CATTD 
of DM, OM, and GE were greater (P < 0.05) for diets based on cooked rice than 
diets based on cooked corn with diets based on pea starch being intermediate. 
Crude protein digestibility was not affected by source of starch but was greater 
for the diets based on SPC than for diets based on PPC (0.836 vs. 0.821; P < 
0.01). Protein source did not affect the digestibility of any of the other 
dietary components. It is concluded that cooked rice is an energy source of 
choice in diets for young pigs. The inclusion of PPC in the diet reduced protein 
digestibility but had no effects on energy digestibility or piglet performance. 
Therefore, the finely ground starch and protein fractions of peas can be used in 
substitution of cooked corn or SPC, respectively, in diets for young pigs.

Levels of total phenol, catechins, and caffeine in teas commonly consumed in the 
United Kingdom have been determined using reversed phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography. Tea bags or tea leaves were purchased from local supermarkets 
and extracted in boiling water for 5 min. The resulting data showed considerable 
variability in both total phenols [80.5-134.9 mg/g of dry matter (DM) in black 
teas and 87-106.2 mg/g of DM in green teas] and catechins (5.6-47.5, 51.5-84.3, 
and 8.5-13.9 mg/g of DM in black, green, and fruit teas, respectively); this was 
most probably a result of differing agronomic conditions, leaf age, and storage 
during and after transport, as well as the degree of fermentation. Caffeine 
contents of black teas (22-28 mg/g of DM) were significantly higher than in less 
fermented green teas (11-20 mg/g of DM). The relative concentration of the five 
major tea catechins ranked EGCG > ECG > EC > EGC > C. The estimated U.K. dietary 
intakes of total tea catechins, calculated on the basis of an average tea 
consumption of three cups of tea (200 mL cup, 1% tea leaves w/v), were 61.5, 
92.7, and 405.5 mg/day from fruit teas, black teas, and green teas, 
respectively. The coefficients of variation were 19.4, 88.6, and 17.3%, 
respectively, indicating the wide variation in these intakes. The calculated 
caffeine intake ranged between 92 and 146 mg/day. In addition, many individuals 
will consume much larger quantities of tea, of various strengths (as determined 
by the brewing conditions employed). This broad spread of U.K. daily intakes 
further emphasizes the need for additional research to relate intake and effect 
in various population groups.

Black tea, green tea, red wine, and cocoa are high in phenolic phytochemicals, 
among which theaflavin, epigallocatechin gallate, resveratrol, and procyanidin, 
respectively, have been extensively investigated due to their possible role as 
chemopreventive agents based on their antioxidant capacities. The present study 
compared the phenolic and flavonoid contents and total antioxidant capacities of 
cocoa, black tea, green tea, and red wine. Cocoa contained much higher levels of 
total phenolics (611 mg of gallic acid equivalents, GAE) and flavonoids (564 mg 
of epicatechin equivalents, ECE) per serving than black tea (124 mg of GAE and 
34 mg of ECE, respectively), green tea (165 mg of GAE and 47 mg of ECE), and red 
wine (340 mg of GAE and 163 mg of ECE). Total antioxidant activities were 
measured using the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) 
and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assays and are 
expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacities (VCEACs). Cocoa 
exhibited the highest antioxidant activity among the samples in ABTS and DPPH 
assays, with VCEACs of 1128 and 836 mg/serving, respectively. The relative total 
antioxidant capacities of the samples in both assays were as follows in 
decreasing order: cocoa > red wine > green tea > black tea. The total 
antioxidant capacities from ABTS and DPPH assays were highly correlated with 
phenolic content (r2 = 0.981 and 0.967, respectively) and flavonoid content (r2 
= 0.949 and 0.915). These results suggest that cocoa is more beneficial to 
health than teas and red wine in terms of its higher antioxidant capacity.

The simultaneous determination of 19 phenolic compounds was performed directly 
in wort and beer by a combination of reverse-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography coupled with coulometric array detection. Chromatographic 
separation was achieved with an appropriate gradient of flow and a binary 
solvent based on phosphate buffer, methanol, and acetonitrile in a 45-min run. 
Eight serial coulometric detectors were used for on-line generation of 
voltammetric data to resolve coeluting compounds. The method was reliable and 
sensitive, the regression coefficient of standard calibration curves is 0.972 < 
or = r < or = 1.000, and the standard deviation value ranges from 0.010 to 0.129 
mg/L for wort and from 0.002 to 0.332 mg/L for beer. The mean concentrations of 
phenolic acids were 22.1 and 33.8 mg/L, respectively, in worts and beers 
produced in Italy. These amounts represent 5 and 10% of the non-tannic, 
non-flavonoid phenols in wort and beer, respectively.

A series of eight green, eight oolong, and 17 black teas have been analyzed for 
polyphenol content by absorbance at 272 nm and cyclic voltammetry response at an 
inert carbon electrode, a new method developed to provide a rapid measure of 
easily oxidizable polyphenols in beverages. The chain-breaking antioxidant 
activity of the teas has also been determined during the chain oxidation of 
methyl linoleate in a pH 7.4 micellar solution, for which realistic kinetic 
parameters have been derived. While higher mean values were obtained for green 
teas than for oolong and black teas, the differences were not large, and the 
spread of values within each type was considerable. The absorbance at 272 nm 
correlated well with the cyclic voltammetry response only for green teas and 
black teas taken on their own. The cyclic voltammetry measure and the 
antioxidant activity correlated well only for the green teas, where the 
polyphenol content is dominated by epigallocatechin gallate.

Total phenolics, total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity of 11 cultivars of 
fresh plums were determined using spectrophotometric methods. Identification and 
quantification of individual polyphenolics were performed using reversed-phase 
high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with a diode array detector. The 
total phenolic contents of various cultivars widely varied from 125.0 to 372.6 
mg/100 g expressed as gallic acid equivalents. The level of total flavonoids in 
fresh plums ranged between 64.8 and 257.5 mg/100 g expressed as catechin 
equivalents. Antioxidant capacity, expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant 
capacity (VCEAC), ranged from 204.9 to 567.0 mg/100 g with an average of 290.9 
mg/100 g of fresh weight. Cv. Beltsville Elite B70197 showed the highest amounts 
of total phenolics and total flavonoids and the highest VCEAC. A positive 
relationship (correlation coefficient r (2)() = 0.977) was presented between 
total phenolics and VCEAC, suggesting polyphenolics would play an important role 
in free radical scavenging. The level of IC(50) value of superoxide radical 
anion scavenging activity of the plum cultivars ranged from 13.4 to 45.7 mg of 
VCEAC/100 g. Neochlorogenic acid was the predominant polyphenolic among fresh 
plums tested. Flavonols found in plum were commonly quercetin derivatives. Rutin 
was the most predominant flavonol in plums. Various anthocyanins containing 
cyanidin aglycon and peonidin aglycon were commonly found in all plums except 
for cv. Mirabellier and NY 101.

Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) contains abundant lignans including lipid-soluble 
lignans (sesamin and sesamolin) and water-soluble lignan glycosides (sesaminol 
triglucoside and sesaminol diglucoside) related to antioxidative activity. In 
this study, near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to develop a 
rapid and nondestructive method for the determination of lignan contents on 
intact sesame seeds. Ninety-three intact seeds were scanned in the reflectance 
mode of a scanning monochromator. This scanning procedure did not require the 
pulverization of samples, allowing each analysis to be completed within minutes. 
Reference values for lignan contents were obtained by high-performance liquid 
chromatography analysis. Calibration equations for lignans (sesamin and 
sesamolin) and lignan glycosides (sesaminol triglucoside and sesaminol 
diglucoside) contents were developed using modified partial least squares 
regression with internal cross-validation (n = 63). The equations obtained had 
low standard errors of cross-validation and moderate R2 (coefficient of 
determination in calibration). The prediction of an external validation set (n = 
30) showed significant correlation between reference values and NIRS predicted 
values based on the SEP (standard error of prediction), bias, and r2 
(coefficient of determination in prediction). The models developed in this study 
had relatively higher values (more than 2.0) of SD/SEP(C) for all lignans and 
lignan glycosides except for sesaminol diglucoside, which had a minor amount, 
indicating good correlation between the reference and the NIRS estimate. The 
results showed that NIRS, a nondestructive screening method, could be used to 
rapidly determine lignan and lignan glycoside contents in the breeding programs 
for high quality sesame.

Ready to drink (RTD) teas are a growing segment in the beverage category, 
brought about by improvements in the flavor of these products and healthy market 
trends driven by consumers. The presented results evaluated the antioxidant 
phytochemical stability of RTD teas from aqueous infusions of traditional green 
tea (Camellia sinensis) and a botanical tea from yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria) 
as influenced by packaging materials during cold storage. Two common packaging 
materials for RTD products are glass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and 
have been compared to a retortable pouch (RP), an emerging packaging material 
for various types of food since it is durable, inexpensive, lightweight, and 
easy to sterilize. Storage stability was then evaluated for each aqueous 
infusion prepared at 10 g/L at 90 °C for 10 min and evaluated at 3 °C in the 
absence of light over 12 weeks. Analyses included quantification and 
characterization of individual polyphenolics by high-performance liquid 
chromatography-photodiode array and liquid chromatography-electrospray 
ionization-mass spectrometry as well as changes in total antioxidant capacity. 
For green tea, concentrations of the three major flavan-3-ols, epigallocatechin 
gallate, epigallocatechin, and epicatechin gallate were better retained in glass 
bottles as compared to other packages over 12 weeks. In yaupon holly, 
chlorogenic acid and its isomers that were the predominant compounds were 
generally stable in each packaging material, and a 20.6-fold higher amount of 
saponin was found as compared to green tea, which caused higher stability of 
flavonol glycosides present in yaupon holly during storage. The antioxidant 
capacity of green tea was better retained in glass and PET versus RP, whereas no 
differences were again observed for yaupon holly. Results highlight the 
superiority of oxygen-impervious glass packaging, but viable alternatives may be 
utilizable for RTD teas with variable phytochemical compositions.

Flaxseed (FS) is a nutritional supplement with high concentrations of (n-3) 
fatty acids and lignans that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. 
The use of FS in the prevention or treatment of acute lung disease is unknown. 
In this study, we evaluated diets with high FS content in experimental murine 
models of acute lung injury and inflammation. The kinetics of lignan 
accumulation in blood, following 10% FS supplementation, was determined using 
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Mice were fed isocaloric control 
and 10% FS-supplemented diets for at least 3 wk and challenged by hyperoxia (80% 
oxygen), intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide, or acid aspiration. 
Bronchoalveolar lavage was evaluated for white blood cells, neutrophils, and 
proteins after a 24 h postintratracheal challenge of hydrochloric acid or 
lipopolysaccharide, or after 6 d of hyperoxia. Lung lipid peroxidation was 
assessed by tissue malondialdehyde concentrations. The plasma concentrations of 
the FS lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, were stable after mice had eaten 
the diets for 2 wk. Following hyperoxia and acid aspiration, bronchoalveolar 
lavage neutrophils decreased in FS-supplemented mice (P = 0.012 and P = 0.027, 
respectively), whereas overall alveolar white blood cell influx tended to be 
lower (P = 0.11). In contrast, neither lung injury nor inflammation was 
ameliorated by FS following lipopolysaccharide instillation. Lung 
malondialdehyde levels were lower in hyperoxic mice than in unchallenged mice (P 
= 0.0001), and decreased with FS treatment following acid aspiration (P = 
0.011). Dietary FS decreased lung inflammation and lipid peroxidation, 
suggesting a protective role against pro-oxidant-induced tissue damage in vivo.

With a view to analyse multiresidues of pesticides in soil samples, a new 
ultrasonic solvent extraction (USE) was compared to the European Norm DIN 12393 
for foodstuff (extraction with acetone, partitioning with 
ethylacetate/cyclohexane and clean-up with gel permeation chromatography (GPC)), 
the QuECheRS method and a pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) method. Pesticides 
were analysed with both GC-MS and HPLC-MS/MS. The reference materials were the 
EUROSOIL 7 and its subsoil SO26 as well as a sea sand. All the substances were 
observed to be linear in the range of 4-800 ng g(-1) for the European Norm DIN 
12393, 7-1400 ng g(-1) for the USE method and 20-4000 ng g(-1) for the QueCheRS 
and the PLE methods. Limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification 
(LOQ) were with HPLC between 0.006 and 0.23 ng g(-1) and between 0.022 and 0.77 
ng g(-1), respectively, with the exception of diuron (LOD up to 11.8 ng g(-1); 
LOQ up to 39.2 ng g(-1)). With GC they ranged from 3.0 to 87.5 ng g(-1) and from 
10 to 292 ng g(-1), respectively. All substances could be recovered with USE as 
well as with the QuECheRS method; the European Norm DIN 12393 could not recover 
carbendazim and metamitron; the PLE carbendazim, metamitron and monolinuron. For 
the remaining substances, recoveries at a 500 ng g(-1) fortification level 
ranged from 10.9 to 96.3% with the USE. In comparison, the QuECheRS method was 
the most efficient extraction method with recoveries from 27.3 to 120.9%. It was 
followed by the European Norm DIN 12393 with recoveries between 6.8 and 108.1% 
and the PLE with recoveries from 12.2 to 153.2%. Recoveries were higher from the 
EUROSOIL 7 than from the SO 26. The repeatability expressed in term of standard 
deviation was below 20% for all substances and all materials.

A fast and effective dynamic sonication assisted ethanol extraction method was 
developed for extracting phenolic acids from basil, oregano, rosemary, sage, 
spearmint and thyme of the Lamiaceae family. The results were compared with 
results obtained by conventional solvent extraction techniques. A comprehensive 
two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC x LC) system interfaced to 
electrospray ionisation time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry was then 
optimised for analysis and quantification of the herb extracts. The optimised LC 
x LC system employed a combination of C18 and cyano columns. The relative 
standard deviations for the retention times were better than 0.05% (rosmarinic 
acid 0.1%) and those for the peak areas 2-14% (2 mg/l, n=3). Limits of detection 
were 18-90 ng/ml. The LC x LC-MS method was applied to the quantitative analysis 
of phenolic acids, and the results were compared with those obtained with 
conventional LC-MS.

A highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method with 
electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED) was developed for the determination of 
isoflavones. Electrochemical behaviour of daidzein and genistein was studied on 
carbon paste electrode (CPE) by adsorptive transfer stripping square wave 
voltammetry. The obtained electrochemical results were used for the development 
of HPLC-ED method. Furthermore, isoflavones were separated on an Atlantis dC18 
column using a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile (solvent A) and 0.15M 
acetate buffer of pH 5.5 (solvent B) at a flow rate 0.4 mL/min. A linear 
gradient profile (solvent B) was at 0-2 min 87%; 22 min 60%; 27 min 50%; 31 min 
45%; 47 min 87%. Full scan of multi-channel coulometric detection was tested and 
optimal potential at 450 mV was chosen for our purposes. Calibration curves were 
linear (daidzein R(2) = 0.9993 and genistein R(2) = 0.9987). The detection limit 
for daidzein/genistein was 480/394 pg/mL (1.8/1.5 nM) and per column 2.4/1.9 pg. 
Isoflavones extracted from soybean products (farina, meat, milk) by the 
accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) procedure and isoflavones present in human 
urine were determined by the HPLC-ED method.

Isoflavones are biologically active compounds occurring naturally in a variety 
of plants, with relatively high levels found in soybeans. Twelve laboratories 
participated in a collaborative study to determine the aglycon isoflavone 
content of 8 test samples of soy and foods containing soy. The analytical method 
for the determination of isoflavones incorporates a mild saponification step 
that reduces the number of analytes measured and permits quantitation versus 
commercially available, stable reference standards. Test samples were extracted 
at 65 degrees C with methanol-water (80 + 20), saponified with dilute sodium 
hydroxide solution, and analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography with UV 
detection at 260 nm. Isoflavone results were reported as microg/aglycon/g or 
microg aglycon equivalents/g. The 8 test samples included 2 blind duplicates and 
4 single test samples with total isoflavone concentrations ranging from 
approximately 50 to 3000 microg/g. Test samples of soy ingredients and products 
made with soy were distributed to collaborators with appropriate reference 
standards. Collaborators were asked to analyze test samples in duplicate on 2 
separate days. The data were analyzed for individual isoflavone components, 
subtotals of daidzin-daidzein, glycitin-glycitein, and genistin-genistein, and 
total isoflavones. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for repeatability was 
1.8-7.1%, and the RSD for reproducibility was 3.2-16.1% for total isoflavone 
values of 47-3099 microg/g.

BACKGROUND: The effects of industrial tomato paste processing and long-term (12 
months) ambient storage on the content and stability of quercetin, kaempferol, 
ascorbic acid (AA), dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA), β-carotene and lycopene were 
evaluated in a commercially produced tomato paste.
RESULTS: The initial thermal treatment (hot break; 93 °C for 5 min) resulted in 
significant reductions in quercetin (54%), kaempferol (61%), AA (63%) and 
β-carotene (30%), whereas subsequent processing steps (e.g. evaporation and 
sterilization) did not result in marked changes in these compounds. Lycopene was 
stable during hot break but decreased by 20% through evaporation and 
sterilization. The ratio of DHAA:vitamin C increased during hot break to 23%, 
whereas the ratio of DHAA:vitamin C remained relatively low in subsequent 
processing steps, indicating that AA was not oxidized. AA decreased with 
prolonged storage, with only 13% remaining at 12 months. The carotenoids and 
quercetin remained stable through 12 months of ambient storage.
CONCLUSIONS: Tomato pomace contained significant amounts of carotenoids and 
flavonoids, indicating that it may be an underutilized processing byproduct.

After intravenous administration of (-)-epicatechin gallate to Wistar male rats, 
its biliary metabolites were examined. Deconjugated forms of (-)-epicatechin 
gallate metabolites were prepared by beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase treatment and 
purified by HPLC. Five compounds were subjected to FAB-MS and NMR analyses. 
These metabolites were shown to be (-)-epicatechin gallate, 
3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, 4' 
'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, and 3',4' '-di-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin 
gallate. After oral administration, five major metabolites excreted in rat urine 
were purified in their deconjugated forms and their chemical structures 
identified. They were degradation products from (-)-epicatechin gallate, 
pyrogallol, 5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, 
4-hydroxy-5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)valeric acid, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic 
acid, and m-coumaric acid. Time course analysis of the identified 
(-)-epicatechin gallate metabolites showed that (-)-epicatechin gallate and its 
conjugate appeared in the plasma with their highest levels 0.5 h after oral 
administration; their levels rapidly decreased, and then they disappeared by 6 
h. The degradation products, mainly in their conjugated forms, emerged at 6 h, 
peaked at 24 h, and disappeared by 48 h. In urine samples, (-)-epicatechin 
gallate and its methylated metabolites were hardly detected and the degradation 
products began to be excreted in the 6-24 h period, peaked in the 24-48 h 
period, and then began to disappear. The most abundant metabolite in both the 
plasma and the urine was found to be the conjugated form of pyrogallol. On the 
basis of these results, a possible metabolic route of (-)-epicatechin gallate 
orally administered to the rat is proposed.

We have investigated the inhibitory effects of polyphenols from natural 
products, such as green tea, bilberry, grape, ginkgo, and apple, on rainbow 
trout gelatinase activities. Gelatinases from the skin, muscle, and blood of 
rainbow trout contained serine proteinase, metalloproteinase, and other 
proteinase activities as measured by gelatin zymography. The polyphenols of 
green tea caused the strong inhibition of some gelatinase activities when 
compared with those of the other products. This inhibition was quite similar to 
that of metalloproteinase by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, suggesting that 
the effects of green tea polyphenols on proteinase activities are specific for 
metalloproteinases. The major catechins of green tea polyphenols were then 
separated and identified by reverse-phase chromatography to be 
(-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (-)-epigallocatechin, (-)-epicatechin 
gallate, and (-)-epicatechin. The effects of these catechins on gelatinase 
activities were examined; the most potent inhibitor of metalloproteinase 
activities was found to be EGCG. These results have indicated that green tea 
polyphenols including EGCG are useful for regulating metalloproteinase 
activities of fish meat.

The effects of maturation (green, pink, and ripe) on phenolic composition of 
strawberry cultivars Camarosa, Dorit, Chandler, and Osmanli and their hybrids 
were investigated using a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. 
p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, ellagic acid, cyanidin-3-glucoside, 
pelargonidin-3-glucoside, kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin were individually 
quantified for each stage. The highest amounts of anthocyanins were obtained 
from ripe fruits whereas ellagic acid was found as the main phenolic in the 
green fruits. Phenolic concentrations were found statistically different in 
green and ripe fruits. One hybrid was found to have higher phenolic contents 
than the other genotypes. The p-hydroxybenzoic and p-coumaric acid levels 
changed during maturation, but no differences in contents of flavonoids in green 
and ripe fruit were detected.

A HPLC method coupled with coulometric electrode array detection for the 
determination of matairesinol in flax seed is described. The defatted sample was 
spiked with bisphenol A (internal standard), refluxed for 75 min in a mixture of 
ethanol-bidistilled water-12 M hydrochloric acid (2:2:1, v/v/v) to extract 
matairesinol conjugates and to hydrolyze them simultaneously. The extract was 
diluted with mobile phase [250 ml acetonitrile-750 ml buffer (730 ml bidistilled 
water, 20 ml glacial acetic acid adjusted to pH 3 with 5 M sodium hydroxide)] 
and injected into the HPLC system. Matairesinol was separated from other 
compounds on a reversed-phase column (Lichrospher 60 RP-Select B, 250 x 4 mm, 5 
micro m) and detected in a coulometric electrode array detector using a 
flow-rate of 0.8 ml/min. The potentials of the eight electrodes were set on 
+150, +200, +250, +300, +350, +400, +550 and +600 mV against modified palladium 
electrodes. The content of matairesinol determined in seven samples varies 
between 7 and 28.5 micro g/g. The limit of quantitation is 5 micro g/g.

Buckwheat leaves and young parts of the plant are consumed in some countries as 
a vegetable. Green flour, obtained by milling of the dried plants, is used as a 
natural food colorant. The distribution of vitamin E, squalene, epicatechin, and 
rutin (as the most important antioxidants) within buckwheat plants, as well as 
changes of their content within leaves during the growing season, were 
determined by GC-MS and HPLC analyses. alpha-Tocopherol was found as the main 
component of vitamin E in all parts of the plant; epicatechin and squalene were 
also detected. For the use of buckwheat as an antioxidant source in the human 
diet, the most suitable part of the plants seems to be the leaves and the 
flowers at the stage of full flowering due to the considerable amounts of rutin 
and epicatechin. alpha-Tocopherol content correlates positively with 
temperature, drought, and duration of solar radiation. Certain differences 
appear among varieties of buckwheat, especially in their squalene and rutin 
contents.

Aspalathin, a flavonoid in Aspalathus linearis (rooibos), is absorbed by pig 
intestine as a C-glycoside.

Aspalathin, a dihydrochalcone and C-glycoside, is the most abundant flavonoid in 
rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which is well known as an herbal tea in many 
countries. Aspalathin appears to have in vitro antioxidative and antimutagenic 
effects. To understand the effects of aspalathin in the body, research on the 
absorption in the intestinal tract, metabolism in the body, and identification 
of circulating metabolites in vivo is required. We investigated the metabolism 
of aspalathin to identify the parent compound and related metabolites in urine 
and plasma after orally administering a rooibos extract (16.3% aspalathin by 96 
g rooibos extract, which equates to 1.1 kg dried rooibos material), produced 
from unfermented rooibos plant material, to pigs over a period of 11 days (oral 
dosage, 157-167 mg aspalathin per kg body weight daily). On days 7 and 11 of the 
study and days 1 and 2 after termination, urine was collected in 24-hour 
fractions, and plasma samples were collected at various time points. To our 
knowledge, this is the first time aspalathin metabolites have been identified in 
vivo, by presenting evidence of the absorption of aspalathin. Six substances 
identified in the urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were 
identified; these represent aspalathin and the metabolites methylated 
aspalathin, glucuronidated aspalathin glucuronidated and methylated aspalathin, 
a glucuronidated aglycone of aspalathin, as well as a metabolite of eriodictyol. 
The latter compound was methylated and contained 2 glucuronic acid moieties. 
This study showed that aspalathin can be absorbed by the intestine as 
C-glycoside as well as being cleaved in an aglycone and sugar moiety. The major 
metabolite in the enzymatically treated samples was methylated aspalathin. 
Between 0.1% and 0.9% of the administered dose of aspalathin could be detected 
in the urine on days 7 and 11 of the feeding study. No metabolites or aspalathin 
were found in plasma samples. The identification of the metabolites in vivo 
enables investigations to determine the biological potential of rooibos 
extracts.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of soy isoflavone supplementation on bone 
mineral density (BMD) and markers of bone turnover in postmenopausal women.
METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we used a 
crossover design to test the effect of soy isoflavone (110 mg/day) (1.3:1.0:0.22 
ratio of genistein/daidzein/ glycitein) on bone formation, bone resorption, bone 
mineral content (BMC), and BMD for 6 months.
RESULTS: Postmenopausal women (n = 19), mean age 70.6 +/- 6.3 years and mean 
time since menopause 19.1 +/- 5.5 years, were given isoflavone supplements for 6 
months. There was a 37% decrease in urinary concentrations of type 1 collagen 
alpha1-chain helical peptide (HP), a marker of bone resorption, during the 
isoflavone supplementation compared with baseline (p < 0.05) and a significant 
difference in mean (SE) HP excretion levels when isoflavone was compared with 
placebo (43.4 +/- 5.2 vs. 56.3 +/- 7.2 microg/mmol creatinine [cr], p < 0.05). 
With isoflavone supplementation, mean spine BMD at L2 and L3 was significantly 
greater when treatment was compared with control, with a difference between 
means of 0.03 +/- 0.04 g and 0.03 +/- 0.04 g (p < 0.05), respectively. There 
were nonsignificant increases from baseline for total spine BMC (3.5%), total 
spine BMD (1%), total hip BMC (3.6%), and total hip BMD (1.3%) with the 
isoflavone treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Soy isoflavone, in isolated form, was effective in this study to 
significantly decrease bone resorption in postmenopausal women. Further 
investigation needs to be done to evaluate the long-term effects of soy 
isoflavone on bone mass and fracture risk.

Phytoestrogens are a group of polyphenolic plant metabolites that can induce 
biological responses. Their bioactivity is based on their similarity to 
17beta-estradiol and their ability to bind to the beta-estrogen receptor. 
Although epidemiological data are inconclusive, phytoestrogens are considered to 
be beneficial for a variety of conditions, for example, hormone-related cancers 
like breast and prostate cancer. To investigate the biological effects of these 
compounds and to assess the exposure of larger cohorts or the general public, 
reliable data on the phytoestrogen content of food is necessary. Previously, 
food analysis for phytoestrogens was performed using either HPLC-UV or GC/MS. 
Here, we describe the development of the first generic method for the analysis 
of phytoestrogens in food, using automated solid-phase extraction and liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The presented method shows a good 
reproducibility and can be easily adapted to other phytoestrogens if required.

Dietary phytoestrogens may be involved in the occurrence of chronic diseases. 
Reliable information on the phytoestrogen content in foods is required to assess 
dietary exposure and disease risk in epidemiological studies. However, there is 
little information on isoflavone, lignan, and coumestrol content of cereals and 
cereal-based foods, leading to an underestimation of intake. This is the first 
study of phytoestrogens (isoflavones: biochanin A, daidzein, formononetin, 
genistein, glycitein; lignans: matairesinol, secoisplariciresinol; coumestrol) 
in a comprehensive selection of 101 cereals and cereal-based foods-including 
breads, breakfast cereals, biscuits, pasta and rice-consumed in the UK using a 
sensitive LCMS technique with 13C-labelled internal standards. Phytoestrogens 
were detected in all foods analyzed; bread contained the highest amount of 
phytoestrogens-many as isoflavones-with an average content of 375 +/- 67 
microg/100 g wet weight (excluding soya-linseed bread with 12,000 microg/100 g). 
Most other foods contained less than 100 microg/100 g, many as lignans. Our 
study shows that all foods analyzed contained phytoestrogens, with the highest 
amount found in breads, making them one of the main sources of dietary 
phytoestrogens in the UK. These results will allow a more accurate estimation of 
exposure to dietary phytoestrogens.

The distribution of total phenolics and main betacyanins in red beetroot (Beta 
vulgaris) root was determined. Also, the subsequent effects of cold storage on 
the content of total phenolics, main betacyanins (betanin and isobetanin), and 
the main known ferulic acid ester 
(beta-D-fructofuranosyl-alpha-D-(6-O-(E)-feruloylglucopyranoside) were 
determined in the peel, which is the root part containing the largest amount of 
total phenolics. The content of total phenolics in the red beetroot water 
extracts was determined according to a modification of the Folin-Ciocalteu 
method and expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE). The compounds of interest 
were identified by HPLC-ESI-MS and NMR techniques, and the contents of compounds 
were determined by HLPC analyses. The total phenolic contents in various root 
parts were found to decrease in the order peel, crown, flesh. Significant 
differences in the contents of total phenolics and individual compounds were 
found when the effect of cold storage (5 degrees C, 0-196 days) on the 
constituents of the peel from intact roots was examined. In addition to the 
betacyanins of red beetroot peel found in our earlier study, tentative 
identifications of betanidin and feruloylamaranthin were made.

The soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein are found in high concentrations in 
human plasma and urine after soy consumption. However, in vitro and in vivo data 
regarding the oxidative metabolism of isoflavones in humans are scarce. 
Therefore, we have studied the oxidative metabolites of these compounds formed 
in human liver microsomes and excreted in urine of male and female humans 
ingesting soy products for 2 days. Human liver microsomes transformed the soy 
isoflavone daidzein to three monohydroxylated and three dihydroxylated 
metabolites according to GC/MS analysis. On the basis of a previous study with 
rat liver microsomes and with the help of reference substances, these 
metabolites were identified as 6,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 
7,3',4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 7,8,4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 
7,8,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, 6,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, and 
6,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone. Significant amounts of the same metabolites 
except 6,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone were also found in urine of female and 
male volunteers after soy intake. Genistein was metabolized by human liver 
microsomes to six hydroxylation products. The main metabolites were the three 
aromatic monohydroxylated products 5,6,7,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, 
5,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone and 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone. The 
aliphatic monohydroxylated metabolite 2,5,7,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone and two 
aromatic dihydroxylated metabolites, 5,7,8,3',4'-pentahydroxyisoflavone and 
5,6,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyisoflavone, were formed in trace amounts. The same 
hydroxylated genistein metabolites except the aliphatic hydroxylated one could 
also be detected in human urine samples. Methylated forms of the catechol 
metabolites, which were generated by incubations with 
catechol-O-methyltransferase in vitro could be detected only in trace amounts in 
the urine samples. This implies that this reaction does not play a major role in 
the biotransformation of the hydroxylated daidzein and genistein metabolites in 
vivo. Most of these oxidative metabolites are described as human in vivo 
metabolites for the first time. Their biological significance remains to be 
established.

Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of two tree spinach species 
(Cnidoscolus chayamansa McVaugh and C. aconitifolius Miller.) were determined in 
raw and cooked leaf extracts. Antioxidant capacity was assessed by the oxygen 
radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, and flavonoid glycoside composition 
was quantified by HPLC and identified by GC. Total phenolics and antioxidant 
capacity were higher in raw than in cooked leaf extracts. The ORAC values were 
strongly correlated with total phenolic content (r = 0.926) in all leaf 
extracts. The major flavonoids isolated from the leaf extracts were 
kaempferol-3-O-glycosides and quercetin-3-O-glycosides. C. aconitifolius leaves 
contained more varieties of the flavonoid glycosides than C. chayamansa. Cooking 
reduced antioxidant activity and phenolic content and resulted in losses of some 
kaempferol glycoside and quercetin glycoside residues in leaf extracts. The 
results of this study indicate that tree spinach leaves are a rich source of 
natural antioxidants for foods.

Lignans and isoflavonoid phytoestrogens, produced from plant precursors by 
colonic bacteria, may protect against certain cancers. We examined the effects 
of flaxseed consumption on urinary lignans and isoflavonoids. Eighteen women 
consumed their usual omnivorous diets for three menstrual cycles and their usual 
diets supplemented with flaxseed powder (10 g/d) for three cycles in a 
randomized crossover design. Three-day urine samples from follicular and luteal 
phases were analyzed for lignans and isoflavonoids by isotope-dilution gas 
chromatography--mass spectrometry. Excretion of the lignans enterodiol and 
enterolactone increased with flaxseed from 1.09 +/- 1.08 and 3.16 +/- 1.47 to 
19.48 +/- 1.10 and 27.79 +/- 1.50 mumol/d, respectively (P < 0.0002). Enterodiol 
and enterolactone excretion varied among subjects in response to flaxseed (3- to 
285-fold increase). There were no differences in excretion of isoflavonoids 
(daidzein, genistein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin) or the lignan 
matairesinol with flaxseed. Excretion was not altered by phase of menstrual 
cycle or duration of flaxseed consumption.

The total alkylresorcinol (AR) content and relative homologue composition of 21 
durum wheat (Triticum durum) kernel samples, as well as 5 pasta products and the 
corresponding flour mixtures, were determined. Durum wheat contained on average 
455 microg/g ARs, and the average relative homologue composition was C17:0 
(0.4%), C19:0 (14%), C21:0 (58%), C23:0 (21%), and C25:0 (6.5%). The homologue 
composition was found to be relatively consistent among samples, with durum 
wheat being different from common wheat by having a higher proportion of the 
longer homologues. No differences in content or homologue composition were 
observed in pasta products compared to flour ingredients, showing that 
alkylresorcinols are stable during pasta processing. The ratio of the homologues 
C17:0 to C21:0 was < or =0.02 for whole grain durum wheat products, which is 
different from those of common wheat (0.1) and rye (0.9).

The aim of this study was to identify and optimize the critical process 
parameters of the newly developed Supercell quasi-continuous coater for optimal 
tablet coat quality. Design of experiments, aided by multivariate analysis 
techniques, was used to quantify the effects of various coating process 
conditions and their interactions on the quality of film-coated tablets. The 
process parameters varied included batch size, inlet temperature, atomizing 
pressure, plenum pressure, spray rate and coating level. An initial screening 
stage was carried out using a 2(6-1(IV)) fractional factorial design. Following 
these preliminary experiments, optimization study was carried out using the 
Box-Behnken design. Main response variables measured included drug-loading 
efficiency, coat thickness variation, and the extent of tablet damage. Apparent 
optimum conditions were determined by using response surface plots. The process 
parameters exerted various effects on the different response variables. Hence, 
trade-offs between individual optima were necessary to obtain the best 
compromised set of conditions. The adequacy of the optimized process conditions 
in meeting the combined goals for all responses was indicated by the composite 
desirability value. By using response surface methodology and optimization, 
coating conditions which produced coated tablets of high drug-loading 
efficiency, low incidences of tablet damage and low coat thickness variation 
were defined. Optimal conditions were found to vary over a large spectrum when 
different responses were considered. Changes in processing parameters across the 
design space did not result in drastic changes to coat quality, thereby 
demonstrating robustness in the Supercell coating process.

Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and 
development of atherosclerosis. Levels of phenolics, major catechins 
[(+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, procyanidin dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4], phenolic 
acids (gallic acid and caffeic acid), caftaric acid, malvidin-3-glucoside, 
peonidin-3-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-glucoside were quantified by HPLC with UV 
detection for 54 French varietal commercial wines taken from southern France to 
study the antioxidant capacity and the daily dietary intake of these compounds 
for the French population. The highest antioxidant capacity was obtained with 
red wines and ranged from 12.8 mmol/L (Grenache) to 25.2 mmol/L (Pinot Noir). 
For white wines, Chardonnay enriched in phenolics by special wine-making was 
found to have an antioxidant capacity of 13.8 mmol/L, comparable to red wine 
values. For red wines classified by vintages (1996-1999) antioxidant capacities 
were approximately 20 mmol/L and then decreased to 13.4 mmol/L for vintages 
1995-1991. Sweet white wines have 1.7 times more antioxidant capacity (3.2 
mmol/L) than dry white wines (1.91 mmol/L). On the basis of a still significant 
French wine consumption of 180 mL/day/person, the current daily intake of 
catechins (monomers and dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4) averaged 5 (dry white wine), 
4.36 (sweet white wines), 7.70 (rosé wines), 31.98 (red wines), and 66.94 (dry 
white wine enriched in phenolic) mg/day/resident for the French population. Red 
wine, and particularly Pinot Noir, Egiodola, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, and 
Merlot varieties, or Chardonnay enriched in phenolics during wine-making for 
white varieties contribute to a very significant catechin dietary intake.

Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and 
development of atherosclerosis. Stilbenes have been shown to have cancer 
chemopreventive activity and to protect lipoproteins from oxidative damage. A 
method for the direct determination of stilbene oligomers (viniferin and 
pallidol) as well as astilbin in different types of wine using high-performance 
liquid chromatography with UV detection is described. In a survey of 21 
commercial wines from the south of France, levels of pallidol and viniferin are 
reported for the first time in different types of wines. Viniferin was found to 
be present only in red and botrytized sweet white wines with levels between 0.1 
and 1.63 mg/L; pallidol was not found in dry and sweet white wines but only in 
wines made by maceration with stems, with levels between 0.38 and 2.22 mg/L. 
Highest levels of astilbin were found in Egiodola (15.13 mg/L), Merlot (11.61 
mg/L), and Cabernet Sauvignon (8.24 mg/L) for red wines and in Sauvignon (5.04 
mg/L) for white varietal wines. Astilbin levels are highest for recent vintages, 
but pallidol is not found in older vintages. During noble rot development in 
Sauvignon or Sémillon grapes from the Sauternes area, levels of trans-astringin, 
trans-resveratrol, trans-piceid, and pallidol are quite low (<0.5 mg/kg of 
grapes). Viniferin and astilbin levels become optimum at 2 and 30 mg/kg, 
respectively, during spot grape and speckle grape stages.

A straightforward stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) for the quantitative 
determination of the di- and trihydroxybenzenes catechol (1), pyrogallol (2), 
3-methylcatechol (3), 4-methylcatechol (4), and 4-ethylcatechol (5) in foods by 
means of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed. With or 
without sample preparation involving phenylboronyl solid phase extraction, the 
method allowed the quantification of the target compounds in complex matrices 
such as coffee beverages with quantification limits of 9 nmol/L for 
4-ethylcatechol, 24 nmol/L for catechol, 3-methyl-, and 4-methylcatechol, and 31 
nmol/L for pyrogallol. Recovery rates for the analytes ranged from 97 to 103%. 
Application of the developed SIDA to various commercial food samples showed that 
quantitative analysis of the target compounds is possible within 30 min and gave 
first quantitative data on the amounts of di- and trihydroxybenzenes in coffee 
beverage, coffee powder, coffee surrogate, beer, malt, roasted cocoa powder, 
bread crust, potato crisps, fruits, and cigarette smoke and human urine. Model 
precursor studies revealed the carbohydrate/amino acid systems as well as the 
plant polyphenols catechin and epicatechin as precursors of catechol and 
5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, caffeic acid as a precursor of catechol and 
4-ethylcatechol, and gallocatechin, epigallocatechin, and gallic acid as 
precursors of pyrogallol.

Maize bran heteroxylan samples were extracted in various conditions of severity. 
Their ferulate and diferulate content was investigated by GC-MS of methyl 
ester-TMSi derivatives. When extracted by 0.5 M NaOH in mild conditions, the 
heteroxylan sample contained a low level of ferulic acid (0.032% by wt.) and the 
main diferulate surviving alkaline extraction was found to be the 8-8' 
diferulate. On peroxidase treatment, this sample nevertheless produced a firm 
and brittle gel without any change in the diferulate profile. Typical lignin 
structures, mainly comprising syringyl units interconnected through beta-O-4, 
beta-1 and beta-beta interunit bonds, were evidenced in the maize bran sample. 
More importantly, these lignin structures were found to be tightly associated 
with the alkali-extracted heteroxylans. Thioacidolysis revealed the occurrence 
of 0.1-0.5% (by wt.) lignin structures in heteroxylan fractions extracted in 
mild or severe conditions, before and after purification of the polysaccharides. 
The gelling potential of the heteroxylan fractions was not only dependent on 
their ferulate level, but also influenced by associated lignin structures. These 
results argue for the occurrence of covalent linkages between heteroxylan chains 
and lignin structures which could participate in the peroxidase-driven gelation 
of feruloylated polysaccharides. They demonstrate the role of low lignin levels 
in the organization of native or reconstructed polysaccharide networks.

Whether the beneficial effects of pomegranate are due to the ellagitannins or to 
their microbiota-derived urolithins is not known. Our objectives were to 
evaluate the effects of pomegranate intake and its main microbiota-derived 
metabolite urolithin-A (UROA) on colon inflammation and to assess whether UROA 
is the main anti-inflammatory compound. In addition, the effect of the 
inflammation on the phenolic metabolism was also explored. Male Fisher rats were 
fed with 250 mg kg(-1) day(-1) pomegranate extract (PE) or 15 mg kg(-1) day(-1) 
UROA for 25 days. Dextran sodium sulfate (5%) (DSS) was administered for the 
five last days and then rats were euthanized. DSS is a well-known model of 
inflammatory bowel disease. Colon tissue damage, microbiota changes, antioxidant 
status, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), nitric oxide production, inducible nitric 
oxide synthase (iNOS), prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES), gene expression 
(microarrays and RT-PCR) and polyphenol metabolism (LC-MS-MS) were evaluated. 
Both PE and UROA decreased inflammation markers (iNOS, cycloxygenase-2, PTGES 
and PGE(2) in colonic mucosa) and modulated favorably the gut microbiota. The 
G(1) to S cell cycle pathway was up-regulated in both groups. UROA group showed 
various down-regulated pathways, including that of the inflammatory response. 
PE, but not UROA, decreased oxidative stress in plasma and colon mucosa. Only 
UROA preserved colonic architecture. The normal formation of urolithins in 
PE-fed rats was prevented during inflammation. Our results suggest that UROA 
could be the most active anti-inflammatory compound derived from pomegranate 
ingestion in healthy subjects, whereas in colon inflammation, the effects could 
be due to the nonmetabolized ellagitannin-related fraction.

Spectrophotometric determination of tannins in tea and beer samples with 
iron(III) and 1,10-phenanthroline as reagents.

Lau OW, Luk SF, Huang HL.

A simple and accurate spectrophotometric method is proposed for the 
determination of tannins in tea and beer samples based on the reduction of 
iron(III) to iron(II) by tannins at 80 degrees C for 20 min. The iron(II) was 
then reacted with 1,10-phenanthroline at pH 4.4 to form a coloured complex. 
Background correction could be effected by precipitating the tannins in the 
sample solution twice with gelatin and kaolin. Absorbance measurements were made 
at 540 nm and the calibration graph was linear from 0 to 5.5 micrograms ml-1 of 
tannic acid with a slope of 0.213 A p.p.m.-1. The precision for the 
determination of tannins in a tea sample containing 9.45% of tannins was 1.8%. 
Most of the ingredients commonly found in tea and beer samples do not interfere 
with the determination. Several tea and beer samples were analysed for their 
tannin content using the proposed method.

The effect of olive stone removal before processing on the degradation level, 
secoiridoid and tocopherol contents, and antioxidant activity of monovarietal 
extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) was studied. EVOOs were extracted from olives of 
the Leccino, Moraiolo, Frantoio, Pendolino, Taggiasca, and Colombaia varieties 
both in the presence and in the absence of the stones. The degradation level of 
EVOOs was evaluated by acidity, peroxide number, and spectroscopic indices 
K(232) and K(270), according to EU regulation. The secoiridoid compounds typical 
of EVOO, namely, the oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives, hydroxytyrosol, 
tyrosol, and tocopherols were analyzed by HPLC. The antioxidant activity was 
evaluated by the xanthine oxidase/xanthine system, generating superoxide radical 
and hydrogen peroxide, and by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl 
test. Results showed that EVOOs obtained from both stoned and destoned olives 
had a very low degradation level, which was not affected by destoning. Destoning 
lowered slightly the alpha-tocopherol content in EVOOs but increased the total 
secoiridoid content and the antioxidant activity of EVOOs (up to 3.5-fold). 
However, these effects were variety-dependent and negligible in some conditions. 
It was concluded that a better knowledge of the reactions occurring during olive 
processing, and particularly on the involvement of endogenous pulp and stone 
enzymes, is essential to predict the effect of destoning on EVOO quality.

The degradation of secoiridoid, tocopherol, and antioxidant activity in extra 
virgin olive oils (EVOOs) was studied during 8 months of storage in closed 
bottles in the dark, at 40 and 25 degrees C. Picual, Arbequina, Taggiasca, and 
Colombaia monovarietal EVOOs possessing quite different fatty acid and 
antioxidant contents were used. The secoiridoid aglycones, namely, the 
oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives, and alpha-tocopherol decreased following 
pseudo-first-order kinetics. In all EVOOs oleuropein derivatives were less 
stable than the corresponding ligstroside derivatives and alpha-tocopherol. 
Accordingly, overall antioxidant activity decreased following pseudo-first-order 
kinetics, with rate constants ranging from 0.85 x 10(-)(3) to 4.1 x 10(-)(3) 
days(-)(1) at 40 degrees C and from 0.8 x 10(-)(3) to 1.5 x 10(-)(3) days(-)(1) 
at 25 degrees C. According to both the antioxidant activity and the hydrolysis 
and oxidation indices established by EU regulation to assess EVOO quality, 
Colombaia oil was the least stable, followed by Taggiasca, Arbequina, and Picual 
oils. Despite antioxidant degradation, EVOOs with high antioxidant contents were 
still ""excellent"" after 240 days of storage at 40 degrees C. These data led to 
the conclusion that the beneficial properties of EVOOs due to antioxidant 
activity can be maintained throughout their commercial lives.

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with photodiode array detection 
was applied for the characterization of anthocyanins in red-fleshed Budd Blood 
(Citrus sinensis) orange. More than seven anthocyanin pigments were separated 
within 30 min by using a binary gradient (0.1% H(3)P0(4) in water and 0.1% 
H(3)PO(4) in acetonitrile) elution on a Prodigy ODS column. Separations by 
reversed-phase HPLC and semipreparative HPLC on a Prodigy 10-microm ODS Prep 
column, and acid and alkali hydrolyses were used for identification of 
anthocyanins. The primary anthocyanins in Budd Blood orange grown in Florida 
were cyanidin-3-(6""-malonylglucoside) (44.8%) followed by cyanidin-3-glucoside 
(33.6%). Two other minor pigments were also acylated with malonic acid. 
Malonated anthocyanins represented the major proportion (>51%) of anthocyanins 
in Budd Blood orange. Total anthocyanin contents and juice color parameters (CIE 
L,a,b) were compared with six other Florida-grown blood oranges.

The contribution of each phytochemical to the total antioxidant capacity of 
apples was determined. Major phenolic phytochemicals of six apple cultivars were 
identified and quantified, and their contributions to total antioxidant activity 
of apples were determined using a 
2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging assay 
and expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC). Average 
concentrations of major phenolics and vitamin C in six apple cultivars were as 
follows (mg/100 g of fresh weight of apples): quercetin glycosides, 13.20; 
procyanidin B(2), 9.35; chlorogenic acid, 9.02; epicatechin, 8.65; phloretin 
glycosides, 5.59; vitamin C, 12.80. A highly linear relationship (r (2) > 0.97) 
was attained between concentrations and total antioxidant capacity of phenolics 
and vitamin C. Relative VCEAC values of these compounds were in the order 
quercetin (3.06) > epicatechin (2.67) > procyanidin B(2) (2.36) > phloretin 
(1.63) > vitamin C (1.00) > chlorogenic acid (0.97). Therefore, the estimated 
contribution of major phenolics and vitamin C to the total antioxidant capacity 
of 100 g of fresh apples is as follows: quercetin (40.39 VCEAC) > epicatechin 
(23.10) > procyanidin B(2) (22.07) > vitamin C (12.80) > phloretin (9.11) > 
chlorogenic acid (8.75). These results indicate that flavonoids such as 
quercetin, epicatechin, and procyanidin B(2) rather than vitamin C contribute 
significantly to the total antioxidant activity of apples.

Two huckleberry species, Vaccinium membranaceum and Vaccinium ovatum, native to 
Pacific Northwestern North America, were evaluated for their total, and 
individual, anthocyanin and polyphenolic compositions. Vaccinium ovatum had 
greater total anthocyanin (ACY), total phenolics (TP), oxygen radical absorbing 
capacity (ORAC), and ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) than did V. 
membranaceum. The pH and degrees Brix were also higher in V. ovatum. Berry 
extracts from each species were separated into three different 
fractions--anthocyanin, polyphenolic, and sugar/acid-by solid-phase extraction. 
The anthocyanin fractions of each species had the highest amount of ACY, TP, and 
antioxidant activity. Each species contained 15 anthocyanins (galactoside, 
glucoside, and arabinoside of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin, and 
malvidin) but in different proportions. Their anthocyanin profiles were similar 
by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection 
(LC-DAD) and high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array and 
mass spectrometry detections (LC-DAD-MS). Each species had a different 
polyphenolic profile. The polyphenolics of both species were mainly composed of 
cinnamic acid derivatives and flavonol glycosides. The major polyphenolic 
compound in V. membranaceum was neochlorogenic acid, and in V. ovatum, 
chlorogenic acid.

In vitro trials have indicated various potential health effects of lingonberries 
( Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.). Most of these studies have been performed with 
berry extract or juice, and the detailed chemical structures of active compounds 
in these products have not been elucidated. Lingonberry contains 
cyanidin-3-galactoside as its main anthocyanin. Absorption and metabolism of the 
compound is not fully understood, and no studies of anthocyanin metabolism have 
been performed with lingonberries. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
urinary excretion of cyanidin-3-galactoside and its metabolites in young and 
healthy subjects receiving a breakfast containing 300 g of lingonberries. A 
fast, selective, and sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (uHPLC-MS/MS) method was optimized for 
the analysis of the anthocyanin metabolites in urine. Both intact 
cyanidin-3-galactoside and its methylated and glucuronidated metabolites were 
identified from urine samples. The two metabolites represented >50% of cyanidin 
excreted in urine. Maximal excretion appeared between 4 and 8 h after the meal. 
Also, the compounds were absorbed more slowly than reported previously in 
several studies.

The aim of this study was to compare some bioactive compounds in apples, peaches 
and pears and their influence on lipids and antioxidant capacity in rats. The 
content of total polyphenols (g/100g) was 0.23 +/- 0.03; 0.22 +/- 0.03 and 0.68 
+/- 0.1 in peeled fruits and 0.48 +/- 0.04, 0.47 +/- 0.04 and 1.2 +/- 0.12 in 
peels of peaches, pears and apples, respectively. Caffeic, p-coumaric and 
ferulic acids and the total radical-trapping antioxidative potential (TRAP) 
values in peeled apples and their peels were significantly higher than in 
peaches and pears, respectively. Contrarary, no significant differences in the 
content of dietary fiber among the studied fruits were found. The content of all 
studied indices in peels was significantly higher than peeled fruits (p < 0.05 
). A good correlation between the total polyphenols and the TRAP values was 
found in all fruits. Diets supplemented with apples and to a less extent with 
peaches and pears have improved lipid metabolism and increased the plasma 
antioxidant potential especially in rats fed with added cholesterol. The highest 
content of biologically active compounds and the best results in the experiment 
on rats makes apple preferable for dietary prevention of atherosclerosis and 
other diseases.

Flavanone glycosides (FGs) and polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) have been 
studied in pigmented orange (Citrus sinensis) juices and second-pressure 
extracts (SPEs) by high-performance liquid chromatography and diode array 
detector. Detection was performed simultaneously at two different wavelengths: 
278 nm (for determination of FGs) and 325 nm (for determination of PMFs). 
Qualitative distribution patterns of FGs and PMFs in juices and SPEs were 
similar, although the quantitative results are quite different. An increased 
narirutin/hesperidin ratio after centrifugation and the presence of high amounts 
of PMFs in SPEs, which remain unchanged after centrifugation, were observed. 
Therefore, a simple and affordable procedure to distinguish an orange juice from 
SPEs was proposed.

Tea is a popular beverage consumed worldwide. The metabolic fate of its major 
constituents, catechins, however, is not well-known. In this study, two catechin 
metabolites were detected in the urine and plasma of human volunteers after 
ingestion of green tea. These metabolites were identified by LC/ESI-MS and NMR 
as (-)-5-(3',4', 5'-trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4) and (-)-5-(3', 
4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6). The renal excretion of M4 and M6 
had a 3 h lag time and peaked 7.5-13.5 h after ingestion of a single dose of 
green tea, while (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and (-)-epicatechin peaked at 2 h. 
M4 and M6 were two major tea metabolites with urinary cumulative excretions as 
high as 8-25 times the levels of EGC and (-)-epicatechin in some of our 
subjects, and accounted for 6-39% of the amounts of ingested EGC and 
(-)-epicatechin. Both the metabolites appeared to be produced by intestinal 
microorganisms, with EGC and (-)-epicatechin as the precursors of M4 and M6, 
respectively. Repeated ingestion of green tea produced a slight accumulative 
effect of the metabolites. They were also detected in the plasma, exhibiting 
kinetics similar to those of the urinary metabolites, and in the feces. Study on 
these metabolites may help us further understand the cancer chemopreventive 
actions and other beneficial effects of tea.

Tea has been proposed to have beneficial health effects which have been 
attributed to the polyphenolic compounds known as catechins. The bioavailability 
and biotransformation of these compounds, however, are not clearly understood. 
In this study, we used liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass 
spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS) to determine urinary glucuronidated and sulfated tea 
catechins and their metabolites (including methylated and ring-fission 
metabolites) based on the detection of deprotonated molecular ions and aglycone 
fragment ions. The compound resolution was achieved both chromatographically and 
mass spectroscopically. After green tea administration, the major conjugates 
appeared in human, mouse, and rat urine samples were identified as 
monoglucuronides and monosulfates of (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and 
(-)-epicatechin. We also found O-methyl-EGC-O-glucuronides and -O-sulfates and 
O-methyl-epicatechin-O-sulfates in human urine. 
(-)-5-(3',4',5'-Trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4) and 
(-)-5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6), the ring-fission 
metabolites of EGC and (-)-epicatechin, respectively, were also predominantly in 
monoglucuronide and monosulfate forms in the urine. In comparison to rats, the 
urinary metabolite profiles of tea catechins in mice resemble more closely to 
those in humans. This is the first report describing direct simultaneous 
analysis of multiple tea catechin conjugates in urine samples. This method will 
allow more thorough investigations of the biotransformation of tea polyphenols.

To identify and quantify biologically active components in rat serum after 
orally administrating the decoction of Bulpleurum falcatum L. and Fractus 
aurantii, one of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and 
validated. The HPLC separation was carried out on a Waters Nova Pak C(18) column 
using acetonitrile and water as mobile phase after the sample of rat serum was 
cleaned up with solid-phase extraction. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization 
in the negative ion mode and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) method was 
developed to determine the active components. Three flavonoids of hesperidin, 
neohesperidin and naringin were identified in the serum by comparing their 
retention times and three independent SRM precursor/product ion transitions with 
those of corresponding reference standards. The concentrations of naringin, 
hesperidin and neohesperidin in rat serum determined by SRM measurement were 
16.3, 11.9 and 14.3 ng/ml, respectively, after orally administrating the 
decoction of B. falcatum L. and F. aurantii. This method was validated in terms 
of recovery, linearity, accuracy and precision (intra- and interday variation). 
The recoveries from spiked control samples were 93.0, 89.3 and 91.2% for 
hesperidin, neohesperidin and naringin, respectively. Linearity in rat serum was 
observed over the range of 2.0-50.0 ng/ml. Percent bias (accuracy) and precision 
were well within the acceptable range and the relative standard deviation 
(R.S.D.) of the measured rat serum samples was less than 10% (n=5).

Nobiletin, a major component of citrus polymethoxyflavones, has many potential 
significant health benefits. While the biological activities of nobiletin have 
been widely reported, its in vitro and in vivo metabolic fate has been rarely 
studied. To explore the biotransformation mechanism of nobiletin we conducted an 
investigation into its metabolic profile in mouse urine, by various analytical 
techniques. Due to sample amount limitations for isolating and characterizing an 
individual metabolite, two possible nobiletin metabolites were prepared in a 
similar multi-step organic synthetic route: 
3'-hydroxy-5,6,7,8,4'-pentamethoxyflavone (3'-demethylnobiletin) and 
4'-hydroxy-5,6,7,8,3'-pentamethoxyflavone (4'-demethylnobiletin). Normal phase 
(silica gel) and C(18) reverse phase chromatography, as well as liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry, were employed in the 
separation of 3'-demethylnobiletin and 4'-demethylnobiletin, however, without 
success due to the structural similarities of these mono-demethylated 
nobiletins. Using a chiral packed column eluted under supercritical fluid 
chromatography (SFC) conditions, a clear separation was achieved. Thus, by 
comparing the SFC profiles of metabolite mixtures with the synthesized standard 
compounds, the major nobiletin metabolite of mouse urine is identified as 
4'-demethylnobiletin, whereas 3'-demethylnobiletin is a minor metabolite. In 
this study, the concentration of 4'-demethylnobiletin in mouse urine is 28.9 
microg/mL.

The polyphenolic compositions of three heartnut (Juglans ailanthifolia var. 
cordiformis) varieties (Imshu, Campbell CW1, and Campbell CW3) were examined and 
compared with those of two Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.) varieties (Combe 
and Lake). The nuts were defatted, extracted, and separated into three different 
fractions, the free phenolic acid (FPA), acid-hydrolyzable phenolic acid (AHPA), 
and bound phenolic acid (BPA) fractions. The total phenolic contents (TPCs) in 
both FPA and AHPA of the Persian walnuts were significantly higher (P < 0.001) 
than those of the heartnuts, but not in the BPA (P = 0.20). LC-ESI-MS(n)() 
studies revealed that except for the FPA fraction, the major polyphenolics in 
both heartnut and Persian walnut were ellagic acid and valoneic acid dilactone. 
Persian walnuts contained an average of 0.29 and 1.31 mg of ellagic acid/g nut 
in the 80% methanol extractable fractions FPA and AHPA, respectively. Heartnuts 
contained an average of 0.16 and 0.60 mg of ellagic acid/g nut in the respective 
fractions. Bound ellagic acid in the residue was 0.93 and 0.70 mg/g of nut in 
the Persian walnut and in the heartnut, respectively. Valoneic acid dilactone 
was tentatively identified and quantified as milligrams of ellagic acid 
equivalent per gram of nut. These components were found to contribute to the 
strong total antioxidant activities measured using ferric reducing antioxidant 
power and photochemiluminescence methods.

Flaxseed contains the largest amount of lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside 
(SDG) oligomers and is the richest dietary source of SDG. SDG oligomers in the 
flaxseed extract are often hydrolyzed to break the ester linkages for the 
release of SDG and the glycosidic bonds for the release of secoisolariciresinol 
(SECO). The hydrolysates of SDG oligomers are complicated because of the 
production of esters in an alcohol-containing medium. In this study, a new 
gradient reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has 
been developed to be suitable for the separation and determination of: (1) SDG 
oligomers extracted from the defatted flaxseed powder by a 70% aqueous methanol 
solution; (2) SDG oligomers and their alkaline hydrolysates, including SDG, 
p-coumaric acid glucoside and its methyl ester, ferulic acid glucoside and its 
methyl ester in an alkaline hydrolytic solution; and (3) the succedent acid 
hydrolysates, including secoisolariciresinol monoglucoside (SMG), SECO, 
anhydrosecoisolariciresinol (anhydro-SECO), p-coumaric acid and its methyl 
ester, ferulic acid and its methyl ester, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (HMF) and 
its degradation product in an acid hydrolytic solution. The content of SDG 
oligomers in a defatted flaxseed powder was found to be 38.5 mg/g on a dry 
matter basis, corresponding to a SDG content of 15.4 mg/g, which was determined 
after alkaline hydrolysis. Furthermore, this study presented a major reaction 
pathway for the hydrolysis of SDG oligomers.

Preferred age for assessment of qualitative and quantitative characteristics of 
the essential oil of tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) seedlings prior to

An analytical method for determining the quality and hence the chemical variety 
status of tea tree transplants is described. The key to the procedure was found 
to be the leaf age of the test material. Investigation at very early development 
stages was seen to give misleading results due to the sequential onset of 
different monoterpenoid biogenetic pathways. For example, in the first few 
leaves, the high concentration of terpinolene in the terpinen-4-ol variety 
suggests that the terpinolene variety is under investigation. However, 
1,8-cineole percent concentrations in plantation tree leaf were approximately 
1.6 times lower than those measured for seedlings prior to transplant. 
Consequently, the use of a plantation cineole indicator is proposed for 
estimating plantation cineole from seedling leaf analyses. Although recent 
investigations enable the chemotype status to be predicted with some certainty, 
it is now proposed that analysis of leaf set 10 at the age of 6 weeks (seedling 
age approximately 17 weeks) provides an unambiguous analysis and correlates 
seedling quality with mature plantation quality. In addition, the oil yield of 
mature tea tree leaf was found, by steam distillation, to be approximately 5 
times higher than that of seedling leaf.

Dietary phytoestrogens have a number of biological effects, including endocrine 
disruption, antioxidant potential, and protein tyrosine kinase inhibition. 
Secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin are lignan phytoestrogens found 
in foodstuffs, especially flaxseed. Normally they are glycosidically linked to 
carbohydrates and in the large intestine are deconjugated from the carbohydrate 
portion by bacteria. The aglycone lignans can be further modified to form the 
mammalian phytoestrogens enterodiol, enterolactone, and enterofuran, which are 
absorbed into the body and excreted in urine. To assess the health implications 
of phytoestrogens in general populations, knowledge of the quantity in the foods 
eaten is necessary. This article describes a simple preparative procedure for 
the assay of secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin in foodstuffs 
after hydrolytic removal of any conjugated carbohydrate. The difficulties in the 
practical application of the assay procedure are illustrated and discussed. 
Analytical results indicating the concentration of secoisolariciresinol, 
matairesinol, and shonanin in a number of foodstuffs are presented. Also, the 
mass spectral data of a putative mammalian phytoestrogen, called enterofuran, 
identified in urine are presented.

A screening method using LC-DAD-ESI/MS was applied to the analysis of flavonoids 
in celery, Chinese celery, and celery seeds (Apium graveolens L. and varieties). 
Fifteen flavonoid glycosides were detected in the three celery materials. They 
were identified as luteolin 7-O-apiosylglucoside, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, 
apigenin 7-O-apiosylglucoside, chrysoeriol 7-O-apiosylglucoside, chrysoeriol 
7-O-glucoside, and more than 10 malonyl derivatives of these glycosides. The 
identification of the malonyl derivatives was confirmed by their conversion into 
glycosides upon heating and by comparison of some of the malonates with 
malonates that had previously been identified in red bell pepper and parsley. 
The concentrations of the glycosides and the malonyl glycosides in the three 
materials were estimated by comparison to aglycone standards. This is the first 
report of the presence of these glycosylated flavonoid malonates in celery.

Two commercial samples of soft (70% Canadian Eastern soft red spring and 30% 
Canadian Eastern soft white winter) and hard (90% Canadian western hard red 
spring and 10% Canadian Eastern hard red winter) wheats were used to obtain 
different milling fractions. Phenolics extracted belonged to free, soluble 
esters and insoluble-bound fractions. Soluble esters of phenolics and 
insoluble-bound phenolics were extracted into diethyl ether after alkaline 
hydrolysis of samples. The content of phenolics was determined using 
Folin-Ciocalteu's reagent and expressed as ferulic acid equivalents (FAE). The 
antioxidant activity of phenolic fractions was evaluated using Trolox equivalent 
antioxidant capacity, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging, reducing 
power, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, inhibition of oxidation of human 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and DNA, Rancimat, inhibition of 
photochemilumenescence, and iron(II) chelation activity. The bound phenolic 
content in the bran fraction was 11.3 +/- 0.13 and 12.2 +/- 0.15 mg FAE/g 
defatted material for hard and soft wheats, respectively. The corresponding 
values for flour were 0.33 +/- 0.01 and 0.46 +/- 0.02 mg FAE/g defatted sample. 
The bound phenolic content of hard and soft whole wheats was 2.1 (+/-0.004 or 
+/-0.005) mg FAE/g defatted material. The free phenolic content ranged from 0.14 
+/- 0.004 to 0.98 +/- 0.05 mg FAE/g defatted milling fractions of hard and soft 
wheats examined. The contribution of bound phenolics to the total phenolic 
content was significantly higher than that of free and esterified fractions. In 
wheat, phenolic compounds were concentrated mainly in the bran tissues. In the 
numerous in vitro antioxidant assays carried out, the bound phenolic fraction 
demonstrated a significantly higher antioxidant capacity than free and

quantification and antioxidant activity evaluation of grains and cereals is 
essential.

Cocoa-phytochemicals have been related to the health-benefits of cocoa 
consumption. Metabolomics has been proposed as a powerful tool to characterize 
both the intake and the effects on the metabolism of dietary components. Human 
urine metabolome modifications after single cocoa intake were explored in a 
randomized, crossed, and controlled trial. After overnight fasting, 10 subjects 
consumed randomly either a single dose of cocoa powder with milk or water, or 
milk without cocoa. Urine samples were collected before the ingestion and at 
0-6, 6-12, and 12-24-h after test-meals consumption. Samples were analyzed by 
HPLC-q-ToF, followed by multivariate data analysis. Results revealed an 
important effect on urinary metabolome during the 24 h after cocoa powder 
intake. These changes were not influenced by matrix as no global differences 
were found between cocoa powder consumption with milk or with water. Overall, 27 
metabolites related to cocoa-phytochemicals, including alkaloid derivatives, 
polyphenol metabolites (both host and microbial metabolites) and 
processing-derived products such as diketopiperazines, were identified as the 
main contributors to the urinary modifications after cocoa powder intake. These 
results confirm that metabolomics will contribute to better characterization of 
the urinary metabolome in order to further explore the metabolism of 
phytochemicals and its relation with human health.

The aim of this study was to compare the amount and activity of phytonutrients 
in raw, grilled, and boiled eggplant fruit using chemical measures and a 
biological assay of oxidative bursts in human neutrophils. The thermally treated 
samples showed various changes in their chemical composition (dry matter, 
soluble solids, acidity, and the amount of alcohol insoluble substances) due to 
the cooking processes and were much richer in the main phenolic compounds such 
as chlorogenic and caffeic acids, which are known to be antioxidants. 
Consequently, their free radical scavenging activity was significantly higher, 
especially that of superoxide anion. The biological assay of oxidative bursts 
from human neutrophils in the presence of 
N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine confirmed the greater activity of 
extracts of the cooked eggplants with respect to raw eggplants. Successive 
extract dilutions showed a significant activity up to 1.25 microg/mL after 
cooking, while raw fruits resulted in an activity up to 10.00 microg/mL. These 
results showed that the thermal treatment commonly used before consumption can 
increase the content and biological activity of antioxidant compounds of 
eggplants.

Flavonoids are phytochemicals that are widespread in the human diet. Despite 
limitations in their bioavailability, experimental and epidemiological data 
suggest health benefits of flavonoid consumption. Valid biomarkers of flavonoid 
intake may be useful for estimating exposure in a range of settings. However, to 
date, few useful flavonoid biomarkers have been identified. In this study, we 
used a metabolite profiling approach to examine the aromatic and phenolic 
profile of plasma and urine of healthy men after oral consumption of 200 mg of 
the pure flavonoids, quercetin, (-)-epicatechin, and epigallocatechin gallate, 
which represent major flavonoid constituents in the diet. Following enzymatic 
hydrolysis, 71 aromatic compounds were quantified in plasma and urine at 2 and 5 
h, respectively, after flavonoid ingestion. Plasma concentrations of different 
aromatic compounds ranged widely, from 0.01 to 10 micromol/L, with variation 
among volunteers. None of the aromatic compounds was significantly elevated in 
plasma 2 h after consumption of either flavonoid compared with water placebo. 
This indicates that flavonoid-derived aromatic compounds are not responsible for 
the acute physiological effects reported within 2 h in previous human 
intervention studies involving flavonoids or flavonoid-rich food consumption. 
These effects are more likely due to absorption of the intact flavonoid. Our 
urine analysis suggested that urinary 4-ethylphenol, benzoic acid, and 
4-ethylbenzoic acid may be potential biomarkers of quercetin intake and 
1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene, 4-O-methylgallic acid, 3-O-methylgallic acid, and 
gallic acid may be potential markers of epigallocatechin gallate intake. 
Potential biomarkers of (-)-epicatechin were not identified. These urinary 
biomarkers may provide an accurate indication of flavonoid exposure.

Yellow plums (Prunus domestica L) conventionally and organically grown in the 
same farm were selected to study the influence of different agronomic practices 
on antioxidant vitamins (ascorbic acid, vitamin E, beta-carotene) and phenolics 
(total polyphenols, phenolic acids, flavonols) concentration. Conventional plums 
were grown on tilled soil. Three organic cultivations were performed: tilled 
soil, soil covered with trifolium, and soil covered with natural meadow. 
Differences in macronutrients were marginal, whereas antioxidant vitamins and 
phenolic compounds concentration markedly differed among cultivations. Ascorbic 
acid, alpha-, gamma-tocopherols, and beta-carotene were higher in organic plums 
grown on soil covered with natural meadow. The highest phenolic acids content 
was detected in plums grown on soil covered with trifolium. Total polyphenols 
content was higher in conventional plums. Quercetin was higher in conventional 
plums, but myrecitin and kaempferol were higher in organic plums. Under the same 
cultivar and climate conditions, the type of soil management turned out of 
primary importance in influencing the concentration of health-promoting 
compounds.

We describe a reversed-phase HPLC method that uses gradient elution and diode 
array detection to determine four biologically active phenolic constituents of 
red wines: gallic acid, trans-resveratrol, quercetin and rutin. The method 
permits direct injection without sample pre-treatment. ODS Hypersil served as 
the stationary phase; the gradient was formed by acetic acid, methanol, and 
water. Each analysis required an equilibration period of 10 min and a run time 
of 50 min for completion. Previously, total phenols were analysed according to 
the Folin-Ciocalteu method, using gallic acid as the standard, and the results 
are given as gallic acid equivalent.

White, blue, red and purple corns (Zea mays L.) were lime-cooked to obtain masa 
for tortillas. The total phenolics and anthocyanins content, antioxidant 
activity expressed as total reducing power (TRP), peroxyl radical bleaching 
(PRAC), total antioxidant activity (TAA) and quinone reductase (QR) induction in 
the murine hepatoma (Hepa 1 c1c7 cell line) as a biological marker for phase II 
detoxification enzymes were investigated. Among the extracts prepared from raw 
corn varieties the highest concentration of total phenolics, anthocyanins, 
antioxidant index and induction of QR-inducing activity were found in the 
Veracruz 42 (Ver 42) genotype. The nixtamalization process (masa) reduced total 
phenolics, anthocyanins and antioxidant activities and the ability for QR 
induction when was compared to raw grain. Processing masa into tortillas also 
negatively affected total phenolics, anthocyanin concentration, antioxidant 
activities, and QR induction in the colored corn varieties. The blue variety and 
its corresponding masa and tortillas did not induce QR. Ver 42 genotype and 
their products (masa and tortilla) showed the greatest antioxidant activity and 
capacity to induce QR.

High-performance liquid chromatography/diode-array detection (HPLC/DAD), 
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC/TOFMS) and quadrupole ion trap mass 
spectrometry (HPLC/QIT-MS) were used for separation, identification and 
structural analysis of lignans in Schisandra chinensis and rat plasma after oral 
administration of the herbal extract. Six lignans in Schisandra chinensis 
extract were identified unambiguously by comparing the retention time, their 
characteristic ultraviolet (UV) absorption and accurate mass measurement. A 
formula database of known lignans in Schisandra chinensis was established, 
against which the other 15 lignans were identified effectively based on the 
accurate extract masses and formulae acquired by HPLC/TOFMS. In order to 
distinguish the isomers, multi-stage mass spectrometry (ion trap mass 
spectrometry, MSn) was also used. The fragmentation behavior of the lignans in 
the ion trap mass spectrometer was studied by the six lignan standards, and 
their fragmentation rules in MSn spectra were summarized. These deduced 
fragmentation rules of lignans were successfully implemented in distinguishing 
the three groups of isomers in Schisandra chinensis by HPLC/QIT-MS. By using the 
three different analytical techniques, 21 lignans in Schisandra chinensis were 
identified within 30 min. After oral administration of the extract, 11 lignans 
in rat plasma were detected and identified by comparing their retention time, 
characteristic UV absorption and accurate mass measurement of peaks in 
HPLC/TOFMS chromatograms of the herbal extract. Finally, HPLC/TOFMS fingerprints 
of Schisandra chinensis in vitro and rat plasma in vivo were established. It is 
concluded that a rapid and effective method based on three analytical techniques 
for identification of chemical components was established, which is useful for 
rapid identification of multiple components in Schisandra chinensis in vitro and 
in vivo. In addition, it can provide help for further pharmacology and action 
mechanism study of lignans in Schisandra chinensis.

Reliable and economical quantification of micronutrients in diets and human is a 
critical component of successful epidemiological studies to establish 
relationships between dietary constituents and chronic disease. Legumes are one 
of the major dietary components consumed by populations worldwide. Consumption 
of legumes is thought to play a major role in lowering breast and prostate 
cancer risk. In this study, a simplified method that uses solid-phase extraction 
and gas chromatography was developed to measure isoflavones at levels down to 10 
micrograms/5ml. With the use of this method, 12.5 g miso (a soybean paste), 12 
ounces Isomil, and 12 ounces soymilk had daidzin/daidzein levels of 2, 5, and 
12.4 mg, respectively, and genistin/genistein levels of 3, 6.5, and 13.7 mg, 
respectively. In these products, most of the isoflavones were present as 
glucosides. With the same method, urinary levels of isoflavones in six 
15-17-year-old subjects were determined after soymilk ingestion. Each subject 
was placed on unrestricted nonsoya diets, and three 12-ounce portions of soymilk 
were given at 12-h intervals. Males excreted 15.02 +/- 2.74 (SD) mg of daidzein 
glucuronides/sulfates [mean recovery, 40.4 +/- 7.4% (SD)] by 24 h after the 
third soymilk ingestion, whereas females excreted 25.56 +/- 5.10 mg (68.7 +/- 
13.7%) of daidzein conjugates, which was more than males (P = 0.02). Males and 
females excreted 7.73 +/- 1.95 mg and 9.11 +/- 0.84 mg of genistein 
glucuronides/sulfates (20% recovery of genistin intake), respectively, in the 
urine. Most of the isoflavones were excreted within 24 h after 
ingestion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Recent interest in food phenolics has increased greatly, because of their 
antioxidant and free radical scavenging abilities. Popular beverages in the 
world include tea, coffee, cocoa, beer, wine and fruit/vegetable juices. All of 
these beverages contain phenolic compounds. In present study total polyphenol 
content and in vitro antioxidant properties were investigated in 16 red wines, 5 
white wines, 5 lager beers, 3 dark beers, 17 fruit juices and 5 vegetable 
juices. High polyphenol content was measured in red wines (1720 +/- 546 mg x 
L(-1)) and in some fruit juices such as elderberry and prunes (5,680 and 1,807 
mg x L(-1), respectively). The concentration of polyphenols was between 159 and 
5,680 mg x L(-1) in fruit juices and between 255 and 696 mg x L(-1) in vegetable 
ones, while low level of phenolics was observed in dark and lager beers and 
white wines (473, 376 and 392 mg x L(-1), respectively). All samples exhibited 
significant antioxidant properties such as hydrogen-donating ability, reducing 
power, chelating ability and total antioxidant status (TAS) value. These 
antioxidant properties strongly correlated with the total polyphenol content of 
the beverages.

The contribution of the chemical composition to the flavor of cocoa liquor from 
an Ecuadorian selfed population of clone EET 95 was investigated. Polyphenols, 
purine alkaloids, organic acids, and sugars were quantified, and the key sensory 
characteristics of cocoa were scored by a trained panel. Despite the short bean 
fermentation (2 days) commonly used for Arriba cocoa, acetic acid content was 
closely correlated to liquor pH, demonstrating its essential role in cocoa 
liquor acidification. Polyphenols were positively correlated to astringency, 
bitterness, and the green note and negatively correlated to the fruity 
character. Alkaloid and polyphenol levels fluctuated significantly within the 
selfed progeny and tended to be lower than those of the heterozygous clone EET 
95 (inbreeding effect). These results support the idea that polyphenols might be

Sample preparation is often overlooked and is frequently considered as ""a means 
to an end"". This systematic study with a phenolic-enriched substrate, eggplant 
(Solanum melongena L.), was undertaken to evaluate the substantial variations in 
the extraction techniques, solvents, and parameters as described in the 
published literature. Direct comparison of over 10 extraction procedures or 
conditions was performed to show the importance and influence of sample 
preparation on the assay of phenolic compounds. Chlorogenic acid (CA) was the 
most abundant phenolic acid accounting for >75% of the total phenolic acids 
content extracted from the eggplant sample. Optimum extraction of CA and total 
phenolics (TP) from Black Bell cultivar of eggplant were obtained when 
extractions were performed with a mixture of MeOH/H2O at a ratio of 80:20% v/v 
using a pressurized liquid extractor (PLE) at 100 degrees C. The amount of CA 
and TP extracted from eggplant by the previously reported procedures using a 
wrist shaker, rotary shaker, stirring, sonication, or reflux with different 
extraction solvents (acetone or varying composition of MeOH/H2O solvent 
mixtures) varied significantly between 5 and 95% as compared to PLE. The 
predominant phenolic acids in the free phenolic acid fraction of Black Beauty 
cultivar of eggplant were CA isomers. However, caffeic acid isomers were the 
major phenolic acids extracted from the base-hydrolyzed fraction. The total 
amount of caffeic acid extracted from the Italian Neon cultivar was more that 
twice that of four other eggplant cultivars (Orient Express, Calliope Zebra 
Stripe, Orient Charm Neon, and Black Beauty).

As a step to develop a cryopreservation method for zebrafish oocytes, we 
investigated the cryobiological properties of immature oocytes at stage III by 
examining their ability to mature and to develop into hatching embryos after 
fertilization. When oocytes were chilled at -5°C for 30min, the maturation rate 
decreased, but the rates of fertilization and hatching were not significantly 
different from those of controls. When oocytes were exposed to hypotonic 
solutions for 60min at 25°C, the rates of maturation, fertilization, and 
hatching decreased in a solution with 0.16Osm/kg or below. When oocytes were 
exposed to hypertonic solutions (containing sucrose) at 25°C for 30min, the 
maturation rate decreased in solution with 0.51Osm/kg, whereas the hatching rate 
decreased with lower osmolality (0.40Osm/kg). In an experiment on the toxicity 
of cryoprotectants (∼10%, at 25°C), it was found that glycerol and ethylene 
glycol were toxic both by the assessment of maturation and hatching. Propylene 
glycol, DMSO and methanol were less toxic by the assessment of maturation, but 
were found to be toxic by the assessment of hatching. Methanol was the least 
toxic, but it was less effective to make a solution vitrify than propylene 
glycol. Therefore, a portion of methanol was replaced with propylene glycol. The 
replacement increased the toxicity, but could be effective to reduce chilling 
injury at -5°C. These results clarified the sensitivity of immature oocytes to 
various cryobiological properties accurately, which will be useful for realizing 
cryopreservation of zebrafish oocytes.

Hypericum perforatum is a medicinal plant species containing many polyphenolic 
compounds, namely flavonoids and phenolic acids. Since polyphenolic compounds 
have a high antioxidant potential, in this study we evaluated the effect of H. 
perforatum in an animal model of acute inflammation, carrageenan-induced 
pleurisy. We report here that H. perforatum extract (given at 30 mg/kg orally, 
bolus prior to carrageenan) exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects in an animal 
model of acute inflammation. Injection of carrageenan into the pleural cavity of 
mice elicited an acute inflammatory response characterized by fluid accumulation 
in the pleural cavity which contained a large number of neutrophils (PMNs) as 
well as an infiltration of PMNs in lung tissues and subsequent lipid 
peroxidation (as determined by thiobarbituric acid-reactant substance 
measurement) and increased production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, 
(TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1 beta). All parameters of inflammation 
were attenuated by H. perforatum extract. Furthermore, carrageenan induced an 
upregulation of the expression of adhesion molecules ICAM-1, as well as an 
increase in the amounts of nitrotyrosine and poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), as 
determined by immunohistochemical analysis of lung tissues. The degree of 
staining for the ICAM-1, nitrotyrosine, and PAR was significantly reduced by H. 
perforatum extract. Additionally, we demonstrate that these inflammatory events 
were associated with the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and 
signal transducer and activator transcription-3 (STAT-31) activation in the 
lung. NF-kappaB and STAT-3 activation were significantly inhibited by H. 
perforatum extract treatment. Taken together, our results indicate that 
prevention of the activation of NF-kappaB and STAT-3 by H. perforatum extract 
reduces the development of acute inflammation.

A highly sensitive and specific electrospray ionization (ESI) liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method for quantitation of 
naringenin (NAR) and an explanation for the double peaks phenomenon was 
developed and validated. NAR was extracted from rat plasma and tissues along 
with the internal standard (IS), hesperidin, with ethyl acetate. The analytes 
were analyzed in the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode as the 
precursor/product ion pair of m/z 273.4/151.3 for NAR and m/z 611.5/303.3 for 
the IS. The assay was linear over the concentration range of 5-2500 ng/mL. The 
lower limit quantification was 5 ng/mL, available for plasma pharmacokinetics of 
NAR in rats. Accuracy in within- and between-run precisions showed good 
reproducibility. When NAR was administered orally, only little and predominantly 
its glucuronidation were into circulation in the plasma. There existed double 
peaks phenomenon in plasma concentration-time curve leading to the relatively 
slow elimination of NAR in plasma. The results showed that there was a linear 
relationship between the AUC of total NAR and dosages. And the double peaks are 
mainly due to enterohepatic circulation.

High-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode array and 
electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (MS) detection was used to study 
phenolic compounds in berries of black, green, red, and white currants (Ribes 
spp.). UV-visible spectrometry was a valuable tool for the identification of the 
class of the phenolic compound, whereas MS and MS-MS fragmentation data were 
useful for further structural characterization. Distinct similarities were found 
in the relative distribution of conjugated forms of phenolic compounds among the 
four currants. Phenolic acids were found mainly as hexose esters. Flavonol 
glycosides and anthocyanin pigments were mainly found as 3-O-rutinosides and 
second as 3-O-glucosides. However, cyanidin 3-O-sambubioside and quercetin 
hexoside-malonate were notable phenolic compounds in red currant. Flavonol 
hexoside-malonates were identified and quantified in the berries of currants for 
the first time.

High-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode array and 
electrospray ionization mass spectrometric detection was used to study soluble 
and insoluble forms of phenolic compounds in strawberries, raspberries (red and 
yellow cultivated and red wild), arctic bramble, and cloudberries. 
Hydroxycinnamic acids were present as free forms in cloudberries and mainly as 
sugar esters in the other berries. Quercetin 3-glucuronide was the typical 
flavonol glycoside in all of the berries studied. The composition of the 
predominant anthocyanins can be used to distinguish the studied red Rubus 
species from each other since cyanidin was glycosylated typically with 
3-sophorose (56%) in cultivated red raspberry, with 3-sophorose (30%) and 
3-glucose (27%) in wild red raspberry, and with 3-rutinose (80%) in arctic 
bramble. Ellagic acid was present as free and glycosylated forms and as 
ellagitannins of varying degrees of polymerization. Comparable levels of 
ellagitannins were obtained by the analysis of soluble ellagitannins as gallic 
acid equivalents and by the analysis of ellagic acid equivalents released by 
acid hydrolysis of the extracts.

Phytochemicals such as polyphenols and carotenoids are gaining importance 
because of their contribution to human health and their multiple biological 
effects such as antioxidant, antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic and cytoprotective 
activities and other therapeutic properties. Mango peel is a major by-product in 
pulp industry and it contains various bioactive compounds like polyphenols, 
carotenoids and others. In the present study, the protective effect of peel 
extracts of unripe and ripe mango fruits of two varieties namely, Raspuri and 
Badami on hydrogen peroxide induced hemolysis, lipid peroxidation, degradation 
of membrane proteins and its morphological changes are reported. The oxidative 
hemolysis of rat erythrocytes by hydrogen peroxide was inhibited by mango peel 
extract in a dose dependent manner. The IC(50) value for lipid peroxidation 
inhibition on erythrocyte ghost membrane was found to be in the range of 
4.5-19.3 microg gallic acid equivalents. The mango peel extract showed 
protection against membrane protein degradation caused by hydrogen peroxide. 
Morphological changes to erythrocyte membrane caused by hydrogen peroxide were 
protected by mango peel extract. The results demonstrated that mango peel 
extracts protected erythrocytes against oxidative stress and may impart health 
benefits and it could be used as a valuable food ingredient or a nutraceutical 
product.

A method was developed to determine the flavanols prodelphinidin B3, procyanidin 
B3, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin by high-performance liquid chromatography, 
using dual-channel electrochemical detection. This method was especially suited 
to the direct analysis of beer samples and to analysis of acetone extracts of 
barley samples, and was capable of determining proanthocyanidins and catechins 
at levels of 0.1-5.0 mg l-1. The use of dual-channel electrochemical detection 
also enabled unambiguous peak identification by measurement of collection 
efficiencies. This method offered improved sensitivity and selectivity compared 
with ultraviolet detection, and sample preparation procedures were greatly 
simplified. The method was applied to the comparison of stabilized and 
unstabilized lagers, and to the analysis of different barley varieties grown in 
Ireland.

The aromas of three espresso coffee (EC) samples from different botanical 
varieties and types of roast (Arabica coffee, Robusta natural blend, and Robusta 
Torrefacto blend (special roast by adding sugar)) were studied by static 
headspace GC-MS and sensory flavor profile analysis. Seventy-seven compounds 
were identified in all of the EC samples. Among them, 13 key odorants have been 
quantified and correlated with their flavor notes by applying multivariate 
statistical methods. Some correlations have been found in the EC samples: some 
aldehydes with fruity flavors, diones with buttery flavors, and pyrazines with 
earthy/musty, roasty/burnt, and woody/papery flavors. By applying principal 
component analysis (PCA), Arabica and Robusta samples were separated 
successfully by principal component 1 (60.7% of variance), and Torrefacto and 
Natural Robusta EC samples were separated by principal component 2 (28.1% of 
total variance). With PCA, the aroma characterization of each EC sample could be 
observed. A very simple discriminant function using some key odorants was 
obtained by discriminant analysis, allowing the classification of each EC sample 
into its respective group with a success rate of 100%.

Is there a feedback between N availability in siliceous and calcareous soils and 
Cistus albidus leaf chemical composition?

The effects of the Mediterranean shrub Cistus albidus on N cycling were studied 
in two siliceous (granitic-derived and schistic-derived) and one calcareous soil 
differentiated by their texture and acidity. We aimed to find out whether soils 
under C. albidus were affected by the release of C compounds from the canopy, 
and whether phenolic compound production in C. albidus changed depending on the 
soil N availability. Calcareous soils, with higher clay content and polyvalent 
cations, had a higher organic matter content but lower net N mineralization 
rates than siliceous soils, and C. albidus growing therein were characterized by 
lower foliar N and phenolic compound concentrations. Under C. albidus, all types 
of soils had higher phenolic compound concentrations and polyphenol oxidase 
activity. C. albidus presence and leachate addition decreased net N 
mineralization and increased soil respiration in siliceous soils, and these 
changes were related to a higher soil C/N ratio under the canopy. In calcareous 
soils, however, no significant effects of plant presence on N cycling were 
found. In the studied plant-soil system it is not likely that higher phenolic 
compound concentrations were selected during evolution to enhance nutrient 
conservation in soil because (1) higher phenolic compound concentrations were

Phenolic compounds in 46 Spanish cider apple varieties were determined by 
RP-HPLC with direct injection. Several pattern recognition procedures, including 
principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and 
partial least squares (PLS-1), were applied to the data in an attempt to 
classify the samples into bitter and nonbitter categories. Reliable decision 
rules were obtained by both LDA and PLS-1. LDA achieved 91.3 and 85.7% correct 
classification respectively, for internal and external evaluation of the model.

PURPOSE: Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), an anthocyanin component of fruits and 
berries, possesses cancer chemopreventive properties in mouse models of 
carcinogenesis. Its pharmacokinetics and metabolism in mice have hitherto not 
been studied.
METHODS: C57BL6J mice received C3G by either gavage at 500 mg/kg or tail vein 
injection at 1 mg/kg. Blood, urine, bile and heart, lung, kidney, liver, 
prostate, brain and gastrointestinal (gi) mucosal tissues were obtained up to 2 
h after administration. Levels of C3G and its anthocyanin metabolites were 
determined by HPLC with visible detection. Metabolites were identified by 
LC/MS/MS.
RESULTS: After oral administration peak concentrations of anthocyanins occurred 
within 30 min after administration. Levels were highest in the urine and gi 
mucosa. In the gi mucosa and liver the predominant flavonoid species after oral 
administration was C3G, whilst after iv dosing the majority of anthocyanins was 
C3G metabolites. After oral or iv administration, C3G half-lives in the 
different biofluids and tissues ranged from 0.7 to 1.8 h and 0.3 to 0.7 h, 
respectively. Systemic bioavailabilities for parent C3G and total anthocyanins 
were 1.7 and 3.3%, respectively. The major metabolites of C3G were products of 
methylation and glucuronidation. Cyanidin was a minor metabolite in the gut.
CONCLUSION: C3G and its metabolites were recovered from murine tissues which may 
be targets for cancer chemopreventive intervention. Anthocyanin levels achieved 
in the gi mucosa, prostate and the kidneys were of an order of magnitude 
consistent with pharmacological activity.

Pharmacokinetics of trans-resveratrol in its aglycone (RES(AGL)) and glucuronide 
(RES(GLU)) forms were studied following intravenous (15 mg/kg i.v.) and oral (50 
mg/kg p.o.) administration of trans-resveratrol in a solution of 
beta-cyclodextrin to intact rats. In addition, the enterohepatic recirculation 
of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) was assessed in a linked-rat model. Multiple plasma and 
urine samples were collected and concentrations of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) were 
determined using an electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
spectrometry method. After i.v. administration, plasma concentrations of 
RES(AGL) declined with a rapid elimination half-life (T(1/2), 0.13 h), followed 
by sudden increases in plasma concentrations 4 to 8 h after drug administration. 
These plasma concentrations resulted in a significant prolongation of the 
terminal elimination half-life of RES(AGL) (T(1/2TER), 1.31 h). RES(AGL) and 
RES(GLU) also displayed sudden increases in plasma concentrations 4 to 8 h after 
oral administration, with T(1/2TER) of 1.48 and 1.58 h, respectively. RES(AGL) 
bioavailability was 38% and its exposure was approximately 46-fold lower than 
that of RES(GLU) (AUC(inf), 7.1 versus 324.7 micromol.h/l). Enterohepatic 
recirculation was confirmed in the linked-rat model since significant plasma 
concentrations of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) were observed in bile-recipient rats at 
4 to 8 h. The percentages of the exposures of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) that were 
due to enterohepatic recirculation were 24.7 and 24.0%, respectively. The 
fraction of drug excreted in the urine over a period of 12 h was negligible. 
These results confirm that RES(AGL) is bioavailable and undergoes extensive 
first-pass glucuronidation, and that enterohepatic recirculation contributes 
significantly to the exposure of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) in rats.

Sweet peppers (Capsicum annuum L.) cv. Vergasa have been studied at four 
maturity stages (immature green, green, immature red, and red). The individual 
phenolics (hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids), vitamin C (ascorbic acid and 
dehydroascorbic acid), and individual carotenoids were characterized and 
quantified. Five hydroxycinnamic derivatives and 23 flavonoids were 
characterized and quantified from the pericarp of sweet pepper by 
high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray 
ionization-mass spectrometry. Identification was carried out by their UV 
spectra, chromatographic comparisons with authentic markers, identification of 
hydrolysis products, and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Hydroxycinnamic 
derivatives, O-glycosides of quercetin, luteolin, and chrysoeriol, and a large 
number of C-glycosyl flavones have been characterized. Some of these compounds 
were found for the first time in nature. Clear differences in the individual and 
total phenolic content were detected between the different maturity stages. 
Immature green pepper had a very high phenolic content while green, immature 
red, and red ripe peppers showed a 4-5-fold reduction. Ascorbic acid was the 
main form of vitamin C, and its content increased as the pepper reached 
maturity. The red ripe stage had a relevant impact on the carotenoids content. 
Thus, immature green peppers showed the highest content of polyphenols, while 
red ripe fruits had the highest content of vitamin C and provitamin A.

The phloretin-O-glycosides, phloretin-2'-O-glucoside and 
phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside, are thought to be unique to apples and 
apple products. To investigate the metabolism and bioavailability of these 
compounds, nine healthy and five ileostomy human subjects consumed 500 mL of 
Thatchers Redstreak apple cider containing 46 micromol of 
phloretin-O-glycosides. Over the ensuing 24 h period, plasma, urine, and ileal 
fluid were collected prior to analysis by high-performance liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The sole metabolite present in 
quantifiable amounts in plasma was phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, which reached a 
peak concentration (C(max)) of 73 nmol/L and 0.6 h after ingestion (T(max)) with 
the healthy subjects, and statistically similar values were obtained with the 
ileostomy volunteers. Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide was also detected in urine 
along with two additional phloretin-O-glucuronides and a 
phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate. The quantity of phloretin metabolites 
excreted in urine represented 5.0 + or - 0.9% of intake in healthy volunteers 
and 5.5 + or - 0.6% in ileostomy volunteers. The similarity in the excretion 
levels of the two groups and the rapid plasma T(max) indicate absorption of the 
dihydrochalcones in the small intestine. Of the two major phloretin-O-glycosides 
in cider, only phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside was recovered in ileal 
fluid in quantities corresponding to 22% of intake. The absence of 
phloretin-2'-O-glucoside in ileal fluid suggests that it is more readily 
absorbed than phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside. 
Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, two other phloretin-O-glucuronides, one 
phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate, two phloretin-O-sulfates, and the aglycone 
phloretin were also detected in the ileal fluid. This implies that the wall of 
the small intestine contains beta-glycosidase, sulfuryltransferase, and 
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities and that, as well as being absorbed, 
sizable amounts of the phloretin metabolites that are formed efflux back into 
the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. The overall recovery of the 
dihydrochalcones and their metabolites in the ileal fluid was equivalent to 
38.6% of intake.

The present study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of three different grapefruit 
flavanone forms in dog plasma and demonstrated their absorption after an oral 
intake of a grapefruit extract; pharmacokinetic parameters of these forms were 
also determined. Ten healthy beagles were administered 70 mg citrus flavonoids 
as a grapefruit extract contained in capsules, while two additional dogs were 
used as controls and given an excipient. The grapefruit flavanone naringin, 
along with its metabolites naringenin and naringenin glucuronide, was detected 
in dog plasma. Blood samples were collected between 0 and 24 h after 
administration of the extract. Naringin reached its maximun plasma concentration 
at around 80 min, whereas naringenin and naringenin glucuronide reached their 
maximun plasma concentrations at around 20 and 30 min, respectively. Maximum 
plasma concentrations of naringin, naringenin and naringenin glucuronide 
(medians and ranges) were 0.24 (0.05-2.08), 0.021 (0.001-0.3) and 0.09 
(0.034-0.12) micromol/l, respectively. The areas under the curves were 23.16 l 
(14.04-70.62) min x micromol/for nariningin, 1.78 (0.09-4.95) min x micromol/l 
for naringenin and 22.5 (2.74-99.23) min x micromol/l for naringenin 
glucuronide. The median and range values for mean residence time were 3.3 
(1.5-9.3), 2.8 (0.8-11.2) and 8.0 (2.3-13.1) h for naringin, naringenin and 
naringenin glucuronide, respectively. The results of the present study 
demonstrate the absorption of grapefruit flavanones via the presence of their 
metabolites in plasma, thus making an important contribution to the field since 
the biological activities ascribed to these compounds rely on their specific 
forms of absorption.

The present study evaluates for the first time in dogs, the kinetics of green 
tea catechins and their metabolic forms in plasma and urine. Ten beagles were 
administered 173 mg (12.35 mg/kg body weight) of catechins as a green tea 
extract, in capsules. Blood samples were collected during 24 h after intake and 
urine samples were collected during the following periods of time: 0-2, 2-6, 6-8 
and 8-24 h. Two catechins with a galloyl moiety and three conjugated metabolites 
were detected in plasma. Most of the detected forms in plasma reached their 
maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) at around 1 h. Median Cmax for ( - 
)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), ( - )-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), ( - 
)-epigallocatechin glucuronide (EGC-glucuronide), ( - )-epicatechin glucuronide 
(EC-glucuronide), ( - )-epicatechin sulphate (EC-sulphate) were 0.3 (range 
0.1-1.9), 0.1 (range 0-0.4), 0.8 (range 0.2-3.9), 0.2 (range 0.1-1.7) and 1 
(range 0.3-3.4) micromol/l, respectively. The areas under the plasma 
concentration v. time curves (AUC0 --> 24) were 427 (range 102-1185) micromol/l 
x min for EGC-glucuronide, 112 (range 53-919) micromol/l x min for EC-sulphate, 
71 (range 26-306) micromol/l x min for EGCG, 40 (range 12-258) micromol/l x min 
for EC-glucuronide and 14 (range 0.1-124) micromol/l x min for ECG. The values 
of mean residence time (MRT0 --> 24) were 5 (range 2-16), 2 (range 1-11), 10 
(range 2-13), 3 (range 2-16) and 2.4 (range 1-18) h for EGCG, ECG, 
EGC-glucuronide, EC-glucuronide and EC-sulphate, respectively. In urine, 
catechins were present as conjugated forms, suggesting bile excretion of EGCG 
and ECG. Green tea catechins are absorbed following an oral administration and 
EGC-glucuronide is the metabolic form that remains in the organism for a longer 
period of time, suggesting that this compound could suffer an enterohepatic 
cycle.

To study the potential hepatic metabolism of olive oil phenols, human hepatoma 
HepG2 cells were incubated for 2 and 18 h with hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and 
hydroxytyrosyl acetate, three phenolic constituents of olive oil. After 
incubation, culture media and cell lysates were hydrolyzed with 
beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase and analyzed by LC-MS. In vitro methylation, 
glucuronidation, and sulfation of pure phenols were also performed. Methylated 
and glucuronidated forms of hydroxytyrosol were detected at 18 h of incubation, 
together with methylglucuronidated metabolites. Hydroxytyrosyl acetate was 
largely converted into free hydroxytyrosol and subsequently metabolized, yet 
small amounts of glucuronidated hydroxytyrosyl acetate were detected. Tyrosol 
was poorly metabolized, with <10% of the phenol glucuronidated after 18 h. Minor 
amounts of free or conjugated phenols were detected in cell lysates. No sulfated 
metabolites were found. In conclusion, olive oil phenols can be metabolized by 
the liver as suggested by the results obtained using HepG2 cells as a hepatic 
model system.

Four cultivars (Bronowicka Ostra, Cyklon, Tornado, and Tajfun) of pepper fruit 
Capsicum annuum L. were studied for phenolics contents and antioxidant activity. 
Two fractions of phenolics, flavonoids (with phenolic acids) and capsaicinoids, 
were isolated from the pericarp of pepper fruit at two growth stages (green and 
red) and were studied for their antioxidant capacity. Both fractions from red 
fruits had higher activities than those from green fruits. A comparison of the 
capsaicinoid fraction with the flavonoid and phenolic acid fraction from red 
fruit with respect to their antioxidant activity gave similar results. Phenolic 
compounds were separated and quantified by LC and HPLC. Contents of nine 
compounds were determined in the flavonoid and phenolic acid fraction: 
trans-p-feruloyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, 
trans-p-sinapoyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, quercetin 
3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside-7-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside, trans-p-ferulyl 
alcohol-4-O-[6-(2-methyl-3-hydroxypropionyl] glucopyranoside, luteolin 
6-C-beta-d-glucopyranoside-8-C-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside, apigenin 
6-C-beta-d-glucopyranoside-8-C-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside, lutoeolin 
7-O-[2-(beta-d-apiofuranosyl)-beta-d-glucopyranoside], quercetin 
3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside, and luteolin 
7-O-[2-(beta-d-apiofuranosyl)-4-(beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-6-malonyl]-beta-d-glucopyranoside. 
The main compounds of this fraction isolated from red pepper were sinapoyl and 
feruloyl glycosides, and the main compound from green pepper was 
quercetin-3-O-l-rhamnoside. Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were the main 
components of the capsaicinoid fraction. A high correlation was found between 
the content of these compounds and the antioxidant activity of both fractions. 
Their antioxidant activities were elucidated by heat-induced oxidation in the 
beta-carotene-linoleic acid system and the antiradical activity by the 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) decoloration test. The highest antioxidant 
activity in the beta-carotene-linoleic acid system was found for 
trans-p-sinapoyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, which was lower than the activity of 
free sinapic acid. Quercetin 3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside had the highest 
antiradical activity in the DPPH system, which was comparable to the activity of 
quercetin. The activities of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were similar to that 
of trans-p-feruloyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside in the DPPH model system.

Several anthocyanin-derived pigments that showed UV-visible spectra different 
from those of the original grape anthocyanins were detected by HPLC-DAD analysis 
in 1-year-old bottled Port wines from the Douro region. Among these, three 
malvidin 3-glucoside derived pigments were detected in large amounts, 
representing approximately 60% of the total anthocyanidin monoglucosides 
content. These pigments were isolated, purified, and identified by LSI-MS and 
NMR ((1)H, DQF-COSY, ROESY, HSQC, and HMBC) techniques. The major pigment is 
malvidin 3-glucoside pyruvic adduct, previously characterized, and the other two 
corresponded to its respective acetyl and coumaroyl glucoside derivatives. The 
latter is reported for the first time in red wines.

A method using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous analysis of nine 
chlorogenic acids (CGAs), three isomers each of caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs), 
feruloylquinic acids (FQAs) and dicaffeoylquinic acids (dCQAs), and their two 
metabolites, caffeic acid (CA) and ferulic acid (FA), in human plasma. In 
simultaneous multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) measurements using ESI-MS/MS 
with a negative ion mode, a deprotonated molecular ion derived from each of the 
11 molecules was used as a precursor ion while three diagnostic product ions 
characteristic for each were selected for the qualitative analysis. To obtain 
maximal intensities for all diagnostic product ions, the collision energy was 
optimized for each one. LC separation was achieved under conditions of a 
reversed-phase Inertsil ODS-2 column combined with a gradient elution system 
using 50mM acetic acid with 3% acetonitrile aqueous solution and 50 mM acetic 
acid with 100% acetonitrile. In the quantitative analysis, one of the three 
diagnostic product ions for each of the 11 molecules was selected. Application 
of simultaneous LC-ESI-MS/MS MRM measurements to analyze the 11 standards spiked 
into blank human plasma indicated that all diagnostic product ions were detected 
without any interference, and that the sensitivity, linearity and recovery of 
this method were acceptable. When using this method to analyze those 11 
molecules in the plasma after oral ingestion of 250 ml of a drink containing a 
green coffee bean extract (300 mg CGAs), all 11 molecules were identified and 
CQAs, FQAs and FA were quantified. CQAs, FQAs and dCQAs in human plasma were 
detected for the first time. This method should be useful to understand the 
biological and pharmacological effects of CGAs, such as improvement of human 
hypertension.

Hesperidin is a biologically effective flavonoid. Several studies have reported 
that dietary hesperidin was converted to conjugated metabolites, such as 
hesperetin-glucuronides and sulfoglucuronides, during absorption and metabolism. 
However, the chemical structures of the conjugated metabolites, especially the 
sites of glucuronidation and sulfoglucuronidation in plasma, were unconfirmed. 
Therefore, the concentrations of the metabolites conjugated at various sites in 
plasma could not be individually quantified. In the present study, we identified 
the chemical structures and concentrations of the major conjugated metabolites 
in rat plasma after oral administration of hesperidin. Two 
hesperetin-glucuronides were prepared and identified as 
hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Using 
these authentic compounds, the concentrations of 
hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide in rat 
plasma were individually determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
In rat plasma, hesperetin-glucuronides were primarily comprised of 
hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. The 
concentration of hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide was slightly higher than that 
of hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Furthermore, not only hesperetin 
conjugates but also homoeriodictyol conjugates were observed in rat plasma. The 
present study is the first report elucidating the chemical structures and 
changes in individual concentrations in rat plasma of glucuronides derived from 
orally administered hesperidin.

Anthocyanins (ACs) are phenolic compounds that are distributed widely in fruits 
and vegetables. Although consumption of these compounds has been shown to 
improve visual function, the distribution of ACs in ocular tissue has not been 
examined in detail. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the ocular 
distribution of blackcurrant anthocyanins (BCAs) in rats and rabbits after oral, 
intravenous (i.v.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration. Identification and 
quantification of ACs were carried out using high-performance liquid 
chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) and 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV-visible detection, 
respectively. BCAs were identified in the plasma and whole eye after oral and 
i.p. administration in rats. No other peaks were detected in either plasma or 
ocular tissues after administration when the absorbance of the eluate was 
monitored at 520 nm. This finding indicates that intact forms of ACs were 
present in rats after administration of BCA. In rats given i.p. administration, 
the concentration of total ACs in the whole eye and some ocular tissues was 
higher than that measured in plasma. These results suggested that ACs detected 
in the ocular tissues were not due to residual blood. Following i.v. 
administration in rabbits, four ACs were identified in the plasma and several 
ocular tissues including the aqueous humor, cornea, sclera, choroid, ciliary 
body, iris and retina. A small amount of ACs was also detected in the vitreous 
and lens. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that BCAs were absorbed and 
distributed in ocular tissues as intact forms. Our data show clearly that intact 
forms of BCAs pass thorough the blood-aqueous barrier and blood-retinal barrier 
in both rats and rabbits.

Despite extensive literature describing the biological effects of polyphenols, 
little is known about their absorption from diet, one major unresolved point 
consisting of the absorption of the bound forms of polyphenols. In this view, in 
the present work we studied the absorption in humans of phenolic acids from 
coffee, a common beverage particularly rich in bound phenolic acids, such as 
caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid. Coffee brew was analyzed for 
free and total (free + bound) phenolic acids. Chlorogenic acid 
(5'-caffeoylquinic acid), a bound form of caffeic acid, was present in coffee at 
high levels, while free phenolic acids were undetectable. After alkaline 
hydrolysis, which released bound phenolic acids, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, 
and high levels of caffeic acid were detected. Plasma samples were collected 
before and 1 and 2 h after coffee administration and analyzed for free and total 
phenolic acid content. Two different procedures were applied to release bound 
phenolic acids in plasma: beta-glucuronidase treatment and alkaline hydrolysis. 
Coffee administration resulted in increased total plasma caffeic acid 
concentration, with an absorption peak at 1 h. Caffeic acid was the only 
phenolic acid found in plasma samples after coffee administration, while 
chlorogenic acid was undetectable. Most of caffeic acid was present in plasma in 
bound form, mainly in the glucuronate/sulfate forms. Due to the absence of free 
caffeic acid in coffee, plasma caffeic acid is likely to be derived from 
hydrolysis of chlorogenic acid in the gastrointestinal tract.

The contents of free and total phenolic acids and alk(en)ylresorcinols were 
analyzed in commercial products of eight grains: oat (Avena sativa), wheat 
(Triticum spp.), rye (Secale cerale), barley (Hordeum vulgare), buckwheat 
(Fagopyrum esculentum), millet (Panicum miliaceum), rice (Oryza sativa), and 
corn (Zea mays). Avenanthramides were determined in three oat products. Free 
phenolic acids, alk(en)ylresorcinols, and avenanthramides were extracted with 
methanolic acetic acid, 100% methanol, and 80% methanol, respectively, and 
quantified by HPLC. The contents of total phenolic acids were quantified by HPLC 
analysis after alkaline and acid hydrolyses. The highest contents of total 
phenolic acids were in brans of wheat (4527 mg/kg) and rye (4190 mg/kg) and in 
whole-grain flours of these grains (1342 and 1366 mg/kg, respectively). In other 
products, the contents varied from 111 mg/kg (white wheat bread) to 765 mg/kg 
(whole-grain rye bread). Common phenolic acids found in the grain products were 
ferulic acid (most abundant), ferulic acid dehydrodimers, sinapic acid, and 
p-coumaric acid. The grain products were found to contain either none or only 
low amounts of free phenolic acids. The content of avenanthramides in oat flakes 
(26-27 mg/kg) was about double that found in oat bran (13 mg/kg). The highest 
contents of alk(en)ylresorcinols were observed in brans of rye (4108 mg/kg) and 
wheat (3225 mg/kg). In addition, whole-grain rye products (rye bread, rye flour, 
and whole-wheat flour) contained considerable levels of alk(en)ylresorcinols 
(524, 927, and 759 mg/kg, respectively).

The contents of soluble and total phenolic acids were analyzed in samples of 29 
berries and berry products, 24 fruits and fruit peels, and 12 beverages. 
Variation of phenolic acids in berries was also studied. Soluble phenolic acids 
were extracted with methanolic acetic acid, and a tentative quantification was 
performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The total phenolic 
acid content was determined by HPLC after alkaline and acid hydrolyses. The 
content of total phenolic acids as aglycones in the above samples varied from 0 
(pear cider) to 103 mg/100 g fresh weight (rowanberry). Besides rowanberry, the 
best phenolic acid sources among berries were chokeberry (96 mg/100 g), 
blueberry (85 mg/100 g), sweet rowanberry (75 mg/100 g), and saskatoon berry (59 
mg/100 g). Among fruits, the highest contents (28 mg/100 g) were determined in 
dark plum, cherry, and one apple variety (Valkea Kuulas). Coffee (97 mg/100 g) 
as well as green and black teas (30-36 mg/100 g) were the best sources among 
beverages. Caffeic acid dominated in all of these samples except in tea brews. 
Variation in the phenolic acid contents of the berries was either small or 
moderate.

A sensitive and specific method for the quantitative analysis of 
N-2-chloroethylaziridine (CEA), a volatile cytotoxic metabolite of 
cyclophosphamide, has been developed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry 
and stable isotope dilution techniques. The high volatility problem of CEA 
during isolation procedure was overcome by the combined use of a 
deuterium-labeled analog as the internal standard and a Snyder 
column-concentrator assembly. The assay was found to be linear from 16.7 to 2667 
ng/ml in rat plasma with a routine detection limit of 5 ng/ml. The within-run 
precision at 33, 333 and 1333 ng/ml (n = 6) was found to be 4.8, 4.9, and 6.1%, 
respectively. The between-run precision was 6.4% (n = 6). The dichloromethane 
extraction recoveries at 33, 333, and 1333 ng/ml were found to be 101, 98, and 
91%, respectively (all at n = 6). However, the overall recovery through 
extraction and evaporation was only 18.3, 15.2, and 27.7% at 33, 333, and 1333 
ng/ml levels, respectively. The analytical method was used to evaluate the 
generation of CEA from its precursors in sodium phosphate buffer, in cell 
culture media, and the degradation of CEA in these media. In pH 7.4, 0.067 M 
sodium phosphate buffer at 37 degrees C, both phosphoramide mustard (PM) and 
nornitrogen mustard (NNM) were degraded in an apparent first-order fashion with 
half-lives of 24.8 and 14.5 min, respectively. The generated CEA was rather 
stable in this buffer and degraded with a half-life of 20 h. It was found that 
32% PM and 91% NNM were converted to CEA in pH 7.4, 0.067 M sodium phosphate 
buffer at 37 degrees C, respectively, and 41% PM was transformed into CEA in 
RPMI 1640 tissue culture media containing 10% FBS at 37 degrees C. The generated 
CEA was very stable in the culture media with a degradation half-life of 265 h.

Tea is a beverage consumed widely throughout the world. The existence in tea of 
chemopreventing compounds possessing antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic and 
antioxidative properties has been reported. High intakes of tea and foods 
containing flavonoids have recently been shown to be negatively correlated to 
the occurrence of CHD. However, tea may contain other compounds with similar 
activities. Using a new gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method we 
measured lignans and isoflavonoids in samples of twenty commercial teas (black, 
green and red varieties) and, for comparison, six coffees. Both unbrewed and 
brewed tea were investigated. The analysis of the teas yielded relatively high 
levels of the lignans secoisolariciresinol (5.6-28.9 mg/kg; 15.9-81.9 mumol/kg) 
and matairesinol (0.56-4.13 mg/kg; 1.6-11.5 mumol/kg) but only low levels of 
isoflavonoids. Because the plant lignans, as well as their mammalian metabolites 
enterolactone and enterodiol, have antioxidative properties and these mammalian 
lignans occur in high concentrations in plasma, we hypothesize that lignan 
polyphenols may contribute to the protective effect of tea on CHD.

Gradient reversed-phase HPLC was used to obtain quantitative estimates of the 
levels of free and conjugated myricetin and quercetin in 65 red wines from 
Italy, Chile, France, California, Australia, Bulgaria, Spain, Romania, New 
Zealand, Brazil, Morocco, and Hungary. The concentrations of total flavonols 
ranged from 4.6 to 41.6 mg L(-1). High total flavonol levels appear to be 
associated with the use of thick-skinned grape varieties, such as Cabernet 
Sauvignon, with a high skin:volume ratio, which were left to ripen fully in 
sunny conditions before harvest and which were extracted efficiently by modern 
methods of vinification. Some Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon wines contained up to 
40 mg of total flavonols L(-1), which was higher than the levels detected in 
Cabernet Sauvignon from France, California, and Australia. The flavonol content 
of 1989 and 1990 Cabernet Sauvignon from Bulgaria was <6 mg L(-1). Chilean 
Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Pinot Noir all contained consistently higher 
concentrations of flavonols than their counterparts from different geographical 
regions.

Anthocyanins, the red/blue pigments found in plants, are polyphenolic compounds 
consumed by humans and are part of a normal diet. Recent studies have shown that 
anthocyanins have substantial bioactivity including antioxidant activity and 
therefore may have beneficial effects on human health. Anthocyanins are a group 
of over 500 compounds of diverse structures containing different core phenolic 
aglycons and conjugated with sugars in a variety of glycosylation patterns. In 
this study, we have investigated the bioabsorption of 15 anthocyanins with 
structures containing different aglycons and conjugated sugars extracted from 
blueberry, boysenberry, black raspberry, and blackcurrant in both humans and 
rats. Intact and unmetabolized anthocyanins were detected in urine of rats and 
humans following dosing for all molecular structures investigated, thus 
demonstrating that anthocyanins with diverse molecular structure and from 
different dietary sources are bioavailable at diet relevant dosage rates. In 
addition, the relative concentrations of anthocyanins detected in urine 
following dosing varied, indicating that differences in bioavailability are due 
to variations in chemical structure. Our results suggest that the nature of the 
sugar conjugate and the phenolic aglycon are both important determinants of 
anthocyanin absorption and excretion in rats and humans.

A method was developed to determine the flavanols prodelphinidin B3, procyanidin 
B3, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin by high-performance liquid chromatography, 
using dual-channel electrochemical detection. This method was especially suited 
to the direct analysis of beer samples and to analysis of acetone extracts of 
barley samples, and was capable of determining proanthocyanidins and catechins 
at levels of 0.1-5.0 mg l-1. The use of dual-channel electrochemical detection 
also enabled unambiguous peak identification by measurement of collection 
efficiencies. This method offered improved sensitivity and selectivity compared 
with ultraviolet detection, and sample preparation procedures were greatly 
simplified. The method was applied to the comparison of stabilized and 
unstabilized lagers, and to the analysis of different barley varieties grown in 
Ireland.

A library of C-16 modified artemisinin analogs was prepared and their 
antimalarial as well as antileishmanial activities were evaluated. Synthesis of 
these compounds involved the conversion of artemisinin to its phenol derivatives 
7 and 12, and subsequent parallel derivatization by introducing new chemical 
groups through ester, carbamate, sulfate, phosphate and isourea linkages. 
Comparison of in vitro antimalarial activities showed that C9-beta artemisinin 
analogs (8a-f) are more potent than the corresponding C9-alpha diastereomers 
(9a-f); however, their antileishmanial activities were in the same range. Many 
of the 10-deoxoartemisinin analogs studied here showed promising antiparasitic 
activities. For example, compounds 13a-e are approximately three times more 
active against drug resistant W2 strain of P. falciparum, compared to 
artemisinin (IC(50), approximately 0.2 - 0.6 nM; cf. artemisinin = 1.6 nM). 
Further, a number of compounds in this series were notably leishmanicidal, with 
activities comparable to or better than pentamidine (e.g., 13g and 13j). 
Detailed in vivo studies involving these active compounds are underway to 
identify lead candidates for further development.

The possible beneficial effects of tea consumption have attracted a great deal 
of attention. Many of the biological effects have been attributed to tea 
catechins, but the metabolic fate of these compounds is not clear. In the 
present study, a major metabolite observed in human blood and urine samples 
after green tea administration was identified as a O-methylated derivative of 
(-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) by comparison with products from chemical and 
enzymatic O-methylation of EGC. The structure of this metabolite was elucidated 
as 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epigallocatechin (4'-O-MeEGC) by (1)H and (13)C NMR and 
heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity experiment. The human plasma level of 
4'-O-MeEGC reached its peak value within the first 2 h following tea ingestion. 
Its maximum concentration was 4 to 6 times higher than that of EGC. The 
half-lives of EGC and 4'-O-MeEGC in the blood were 1.02 +/- 0.07 and 4.39 +/- 
1.14 h, respectively. The amount of 4'-O-MeEGC excreted in urine was about 3 
times higher than that of EGC, and 88% of 4'-O-MeEGC was excreted in urine 
within 8 h. The present structural information and concentration-time profile of 
this metabolite provide the basis for understanding the biotransformation of EGC 
and for future elucidation of its biological activities.

(-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant tea catechin, has been 
proposed to be beneficial to human health based on its strong antioxidative and 
other biological activities in vitro. Inadequate knowledge regarding the 
bioavailability and biotransformation of EGCG in humans, however, has limited 
our understanding of its possible beneficial health effects. In this study, 
4',4' '-di-O-methyl-EGCG (4',4' '-DiMeEGCG) was detected in human plasma and 
urine by LC/MS/MS following green tea ingestion. Both 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and EGCG 
reached peak plasma values (20.5 +/- 7.7 and 145.4 +/- 31.6 nM, respectively, in 
4 subjects) at 2 h after the dose. The half-lives of 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and EGCG 
were 4.1 +/- 0.8 and 2.7 +/- 0.9 h, respectively. The cumulative urinary 
excretion of 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG during a 24 h period was 140.3 +/- 48.6 microg, 
about 5-fold higher than that of EGCG, but the excreted 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and 
EGCG in urine only accounted for about 0.1% of ingested EGCG. 
(-)-5-(3',4',5'-Trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4) and 
(-)-5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6), along with another 
possible ring-fission metabolite, 
(-)-5-(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6'), were detected in human 
urine after green tea ingestion. The cumulative excretion of M4, M6', and M6 
during a 24 h period ranged from 75 microg to 1.2 mg, 0.6 to 6 mg, and 0.6 to 10 
mg, respectively. The combined excretion of all three ring-fission metabolites 
accounted for 1.5-16% of ingested catechins. M4, M6', and M6 were all observed 
after the ingestion of pure EGCG or EGC by human subjects, whereas only M6 was 
produced after EC ingestion. These metabolites as well as monomethylated EGCG 
were detected in mice and rats after tea or EGCG administration, and the tissue 
levels reflected the rather low bioavailability of EGCG in rats. The presently 
characterized methylated EGCG metabolites and ring-fission products exist in 
substantial quantities and may contribute to the biological activities of tea.

Estimation of dietary intake of polyphenols is difficult, due to limited 
availability of food composition data and bias inherent to dietary assessment 
methods. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the associations between 
the intake of polyphenol-rich foods and the urinary excretion of several 
phenolic compounds and therefore explore whether these phenolic compounds could 
be used as a biomarker of intake. Fifty-three participants of the SU.VI.MAX 
study (a randomised primary-prevention trial evaluating the effect of daily 
antioxidant supplementation on chronic diseases) collected a 24 h urine and a 
spot urine sample and filled a dietary record during a 2 d period. Thirteen 
polyphenols and metabolites, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, m-coumaric acid, 
gallic acid, 4-O-methylgallic acid, quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, 
hesperetin, naringenin, phloretin, enterolactone and enterodiol, were measured 
using HPLC-electrospray ionisation-MS-MS. In spot samples apple consumption was 
positively correlated to phloretin, grapefruit consumption to naringenin, orange 
to hesperetin, citrus fruit consumption to both naringenin and hesperetin, with 
r coefficients ranging from 0.31 to 0.57 (P < 0.05). The combination of fruits 
and/or fruit juices was positively correlated to gallic acid and 
4-O-methylgallic acid, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, hesperetin, naringenin and 
phloretin (r 0.24-0.44, P < 0.05). Coffee consumption was positively correlated 
to caffeic and chlorogenic acids (r 0.29 and 0.63, P < 0.05 respectively). Black 
tea and wine consumption were positively correlated with gallic and 
4-O-methylgallic acids (r 0.37-0.54, P < 0.001). The present results suggest 
that several polyphenols measured in a spot urine sample can be used as 
biomarkers of polyphenol-rich food intake.

OBJECTIVE: Estimation of dietary intake of polyphenols is difficult, due to 
limited availability of food composition data and bias inherent to dietary 
assessment methods. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether we 
could detect polyphenols and their metabolites in a spot urine sample in a 
free-living human population and whether it was related to those observed in 
24-h urine samples, for potential use as a biomarkers of polyphenol intake.
SUBJECTS: Four 24-h urine samples and two spot urine samples were collected from 
154 participants of the SU.VI.MAX cohort (a randomized primary-prevention trial 
evaluating the effect of daily antioxidant supplementation on chronic diseases) 
in two separate studies over, respectively, a 7- and 2-day periods. Thirteen 
polyphenols and metabolites (chlorogenic acid (CGA), caffeic acid (CA), 
m-coumaric acid (mCOU), gallic acid (GA), 4-O-methylgallic acid (MeGA), 
quercetin (Q), isorhamnetin (MeQ), kaempferol (K), hesperetin (HESP), naringenin 
(NAR), phloretin (PHLOR), enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) were measured 
using HPLC-ESI-MS-MS.
RESULTS: Correlations between the urinary excretion levels were observed. The 
most significant were explained by metabolic filiations (CGA/CA, CA/mCOU, 
GA/MeGA, Q/MeQ, NAR/PHLOR, ENL/END) or co-occurrence in a same food source 
(NAR/HESP). Concentrations in spot samples correlated with those in 24-h urine 
sample (P<0.02, except for CA and for MeQ). Intra-individual variations were 
smaller than inter-individual variations for all polyphenols (P<0.01) except for 
MeGA and for PHLOR.
CONCLUSION: These results show that these polyphenols and metabolites are useful 
biomarkers for polyphenol intake.

disease-preventive effects. The pomegranate (Punica granatum L.), which is rich 
in several polyphenols, has been used for centuries in ancient cultures for its 
medicinal purposes. The potential health benefits of pomegranate polyphenols 
have been demonstrated in numerous in vitro studies and in vivo experiments. 
This study investigated the absorption and antioxidant effects of a standardized 
extract from pomegranate in healthy human volunteers after the acute consumption 
of 800 mg of extract. Results indicate that ellagic acid (EA) from the extract 
is bioavailable, with an observed C(max) of 33 ng/mL at t(max) of 1 h. The 
plasma metabolites urolithin A, urolithin B, hydroxyl-urolithin A, urolithin 
A-glucuronide, and dimethyl ellagic acid-glucuronide were identified by HPLC-MS. 
The antioxidant capacity measured with the oxygen radical absorbance capacity 
(ORAC) assay was increased with a maximum effect of 32% after 0.5 h, whereas the 
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was not affected. The inflammation 
marker interleukin-6 (IL-6) was not significantly affected after 4 h after the 
consumption of the extract. Overall, this study demonstrated the absorbability 
of EA from a pomegranate extract high in ellagitannin content and its ex vivo 
antioxidant effects.

Studies were conducted on the flavonoids (myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, 
luteolin, and apigenin) contents of 62 edible tropical plants. The highest total 
flavonoids content was in onion leaves (1497.5 mg/kg quercetin, 391.0 mg/kg 
luteolin, and 832.0 mg/kg kaempferol), followed by Semambu leaves (2041.0 
mg/kg), bird chili (1663.0 mg/kg), black tea (1491.0 mg/kg), papaya shoots 
(1264.0 mg/kg), and guava (1128.5 mg/kg). The major flavonoid in these plant 
extracts is quercetin, followed by myricetin and kaempferol. Luteolin could be 
detected only in broccoli (74.5 mg/kg dry weight), green chili (33.0 mg/kg), 
bird chili (1035.0 mg/kg), onion leaves (391.0 mg/kg), belimbi fruit (202.0 
mg/kg), belimbi leaves (464.5 mg/kg), French bean (11.0 mg/kg), carrot (37.5 
mg/kg), white radish (9.0 mg/kg), local celery (80.5 mg/kg), limau purut leaves 
(30.5 mg/kg), and dried asam gelugur (107.5 mg/kg). Apigenin was found only in 
Chinese cabbage (187.0 mg/kg), bell pepper (272.0 mg/kg), garlic (217.0 mg/kg), 
belimbi fruit (458.0 mg/kg), French peas (176.0 mg/kg), snake gourd (42.4 
mg/kg), guava (579.0 mg/kg), wolfberry leaves (547.0 mg/kg), local celery (338.5 
mg/kg), daun turi (39.5 mg/kg), and kadok (34.5 mg/kg). In vegetables, quercetin 
glycosides predominate, but glycosides of kaempferol, luteolin, and apigenin are 
also present. Fruits contain almost exclusively quercetin glycosides, whereas 
kaempferol and myricetin glycosides are found only in trace quantities.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of three common 
cooking practices (i.e., boiling, steaming, and frying) on phytochemical 
contents (i.e., polyphenols, carotenoids, glucosinolates, and ascorbic acid), 
total antioxidant capacities (TAC), as measured by three different analytical 
assays [Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), total radical-trapping 
antioxidant parameter (TRAP), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)] and 
physicochemical parameters of three vegetables (carrots, courgettes, and 
broccoli). Water-cooking treatments better preserved the antioxidant compounds, 
particularly carotenoids, in all vegetables analyzed and ascorbic acid in 
carrots and courgettes. Steamed vegetables maintained a better texture quality 
than boiled ones, whereas boiled vegetables showed limited discoloration. Fried 
vegetables showed the lowest degree of softening, even though antioxidant 
compounds were less retained. An overall increase of TEAC, FRAP, and TRAP values 
was observed in all cooked vegetables, probably because of matrix softening and 
increased extractability of compounds, which could be partially converted into 
more antioxidant chemical species. Our findings defy the notion that processed 
vegetables offer lower nutritional quality and also suggest that for each 
vegetable a cooking method would be preferred to preserve the nutritional and 
physicochemical qualities.

Flavonoids and related plant compounds in fruits and vegetables are of 
particular importance as they have been found to possess antioxidant and free 
radical scavenging activity. The HPLC-based quantitative procedure, with 
improved extraction and hydrolysis, was used to analyze the content of the 
flavonols quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol in 10 black currant cultivars 
from organic farms and in 5 cultivars from conventional farms. Myricetin was the 
most abundant flavonol, and its amount varied significantly among cultivars, 
from 8.9 to 24.5 mg x 100 g(-1) (fresh weight). The quercetin levels in black 
currant also varied widely among the cultivars, from 5.2 to 12.2 mg x 100 g(-1). 
The kaempferol levels in black currant cultivars were low, ranging from 0.9 to 
2.3 mg x 100 g(-1). The sum of these major flavonols varied widely among black 
currant cultivars. No consistent differences in the contents of flavonols were 
found between the same black currant cultivars grown in organic and conventional 
ways. The high variability in the levels of flavonols in different cultivars 
offers possible avenues for identifying and selecting cultivars rich in certain 
flavonols for the special production of berries for industrial use.

Considerable epidemiological evidence suggests a link between the consumption of 
diets rich in fruits and vegetables and a decreased risk of cardiovascular 
disease and cancers. Anthocyanins have received attention as important dietary 
constituents that may provide health benefits and contribute antioxidant 
capacity beyond that provided by essential micronutrients such as ascorbate, 
tocopherols, and selenium. The emergence of renewed interest by industrial 
countries in traditional herbal medicines and the development of 'functional 
foods' are stimulating the need for more information regarding the 
bioavailability and efficacy of plant polyphenols. Flavonoids represent a 
numerous group of secondary plant metabolites based on the structure of a pyran 
ring flanked by two or more phenyl rings and varying subtly in the degree of 
unsaturation and the pattern of hydroxylation or methylation. Flavonoids also 
vary in the type of sugar attached or the degree of polymerization. 
Anthocyanins, potent flavonoid antioxidants widely distributed in fruits, 
vegetables and red wines, normally occur in nature as glycosides, a form not 
usually considered as bioavailable. We have examined the bioavailability and 
pharmacokinetics of anthocyanins in humans. Anthocyanins were detected as 
glycosides in both plasma and urine samples. The elimination of plasma 
anthocyanins appeared to follow first-order kinetics and most anthocyanin 
compounds were excreted in urine within 4 h after feeding. The current findings 
appear to refute assumptions that anthocyanins are not absorbed in their 
unchanged glycosylated forms in humans.

Limited information is available concerning the qualitative and quantitative 
composition of polyphenolic compounds, especially flavonoids, in almonds. We 
determined total phenols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids in California almond 
(Prunus dulcis) skins and kernels among the principal almond varieties (Butte, 
Carmel, Fritz, Mission, Monterey, Nonpareil, Padre, and Price) with 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/electrochemical detection and UV 
detection. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry under identical HPLC 
conditions was utilized to verify identities of the predominant flavonoids and 
phenolic acids. Total phenols ranged from 127 (Fritz) to 241 (Padre) mg gallic 
acid equivalents/100 g of fresh weight. The analyses were compiled to produce a 
data set of 18 flavonoids and three phenolic acids. The predominant flavonoids 
were isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside and isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside (in 
combination), catechin, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, epicatechin, 
quercetin-3-O-galactoside, and isorhamnetin-3-O-galactoside at 16.81, 1.93, 
1.17, 0.85, 0.83, and 0.50 mg/100 g of fresh weight almonds, respectively. Using 
the existing approach of calculating only the aglycone form of flavonoids for 
use in the U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrient database, whole almonds would 
provide the most prevalent aglycones of isorhamnetin at 11.70 (3.32), kaempferol 
at 0.60 (0.17), catechin at 1.93 (0.55), quercetin at 0.72 (0.20), and 
epicatechin at 0.85 (0.24) mg/100 g of fresh weight (mg/oz serving), 
respectively. These data can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of 
action underlying the relationship between almond consumption and health-related 
outcomes and provide values for whole and blanched almonds suitable for 
inclusion in nutrient databases.

Enterolignans (enterodiol and enterolactone) can potentially reduce the risk of 
certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Enterolignans are formed by the 
intestinal microflora after the consumption of plant lignans. Until recently, 
only secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol were considered enterolignan 
precursors, but now several new precursors have been identified, of which 
lariciresinol and pinoresinol have a high degree of conversion. Quantitative 
data on the contents in foods of these new enterolignan precursors are not 
available. Thus, the aim of this study was to compile a lignan database 
including all four major enterolignan precursors. Liquid chromatography-tandem 
mass spectrometry was used to quantify lariciresinol, pinoresinol, 
secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol in eighty-three solid foods and twenty-six 
beverages commonly consumed in The Netherlands. The richest source of lignans 
was flaxseed (301,129 microg/100 g), which contained mainly 
secoisolariciresinol. Also, lignan concentrations in sesame seeds (29,331 
microg/100 g, mainly pinoresinol and lariciresinol) were relatively high. For 
grain products, which are known to be important sources of lignan, lignan 
concentrations ranged from 7 to 764 microg/100 g. However, many vegetables and 
fruits had similar concentrations, because of the contribution of lariciresinol 
and pinoresinol. Brassica vegetables contained unexpectedly high levels of 
lignans (185-2321 microg/100 g), mainly pinoresinol and lariciresinol. Lignan 
levels in beverages varied from 0 (cola) to 91 microg/100 ml (red wine). Only 
four of the 109 foods did not contain a measurable amount of lignans, and in 
most cases the amount of lariciresinol and pinoresinol was larger than that of 
secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol. Thus, available databases largely 
underestimate the amount of enterolignan precursors in foods.

In the United States, commercially available foods, including cocoa and 
chocolate, are being marketed with statements referring to the level of 
antioxidant activity and polyphenols. For cocoa-containing foods, there has been 
no comprehensive survey of the content of these and other chemistries. A survey 
of cocoa and chocolate-containing products marketed in the United States was 
conducted to determine antioxidant activity and polyphenol and procyanidin 
contents. Commercially available samples consisted of the top market share 
products in each of the following six categories: natural cocoa, unsweetened 
baking chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet baking chips, milk chocolate, and 
chocolate syrup. Composite samples were characterized using four different 
methods: oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), vitamin C equivalence 
antioxidant capacity (VCEAC), total polyphenols, and procyanidins. All composite 
lots were further characterized for percent nonfat cocoa solids (NFCS) and 
percent fat. Natural cocoas had the highest levels of antioxidant activities, 
total polyphenols, and procyanidins followed by baking chocolates, dark 
chocolates and baking chips, and finally milk chocolate and syrups. The results 
showed a strong linear correlation between NFCS and ORAC (R (2) = 0.9849), total 
polyphenols (R (2) = 0.9793), and procyanidins (R (2) = 0.946), respectively. On 
the basis of principal component analysis, 81.4% of the sample set was 
associated with NFCS, antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, and procyanidins. 
The results indicated that, regardless of the product category, NFCS were the 
primary factor contributing to the level of cocoa antioxidants in the products 
tested. Results further suggested that differences in cocoa bean blends and 
processing, with the possible exception of Dutching, are minor factors in 
determining the level of antioxidants in commercially available cocoa-containing 
products in the United States.

Fifty-four different extracts of nine Bolivian plants belonging to the family 
Asteraceae were evaluated for their radical scavenging activity by the DPPH*, 
NBT/hypoxanthine superoxide, and (*)OH/luminol chemiluminescence methods, and 
for their antioxidant activity by the beta-carotene bleaching test. The total 
phenolic content was also determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method, and the 
oxidative stability by the Rancimat test. Both remarkably high phenolic content 
and radical scavenging and antioxidant activities were found mainly in the ethyl 
acetate fractions among the different plant extracts. Some ethyl acetate and 
even some defatted crude extracts exhibited activities comparable to those of 
commercial extracts/compounds, thus making it possible to consider some of the 
studied plants as a potential source of antioxidants of natural origin.

Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated antioxidant properties of some virgin 
olive oil phenolic compounds. One of the prerequisites to extrapolate these data 
to an in vivo situation is the knowledge of their bioavailability in humans. In 
the present work we describe an analytical method which enables us to perform 
hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol quantitative determinations in human urine. This 
method was successfully used in bioavailability studies of both phenolic 
compounds after acute olive oil administration. Virgin olive oil was 
administered to healthy volunteers after a low phenolic diet. The dose 
administered of both phenolic compounds was estimated in reference to free forms 
of hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol present in virgin olive oil extracts before and 
after being submitted to hydrolytic conditions. These conditions mimic those 
occurring during digestion. Urine samples were collected before and after acute 
olive oil intake and analyzed by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
Hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol urinary recovery increased in response to olive oil 
administration, obtaining maximal values in the first 4 h. Our results further 
indicate that hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol are mainly excreted in conjugated form, 
since only 5.9 +/- 1.4% (hydroxytyrosol) and 13.8 +/- 5.4% (tyrosol) of the 
total amounts excreted in urine were in free form.

BACKGROUND: Animal and in vitro studies suggest that phenolic compounds in 
virgin olive oil are effective antioxidants. In animal and in vitro studies, 
hydroxytyrosol and its metabolites have been shown to be strong antioxidants. 
One of the prerequisites to assess their in vivo physiologic significance is to 
determine their presence in human plasma.
METHODS: We developed an analytical method for both hydroxytyrosol and 
3-O-methyl-hydroxytyrosol in plasma. The administered dose of phenolic compounds 
was estimated from methanolic extracts of virgin olive oil after subjecting them 
to different hydrolytic treatments. Plasma and urine samples were collected from 
0 to 12 h before and after 25 mL of virgin olive oil intake, a dose close to 
that used as daily intake in Mediterranean countries. Samples were analyzed by 
capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry before and after being subjected 
to acidic and enzymatic hydrolytic treatments.
RESULTS: Calibration curves were linear (r >0.99). Analytical recoveries were 
42-60%. Limits of quantification were <1.5 mg/L. Plasma hydroxytyrosol and 
3-O-methyl-hydroxytyrosol increased as a response to virgin olive oil 
administration, reaching maximum concentrations at 32 and 53 min, respectively 
(P <0.001 for quadratic trend). The estimated hydroxytyrosol elimination 
half-life was 2.43 h. Free forms of these phenolic compounds were not detected 
in plasma samples.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed analytical method permits quantification of 
hydroxytyrosol and 3-O-methyl-hydroxytyrosol in plasma after real-life doses of 
virgin olive oil. From our results, approximately 98% of hydroxytyrosol appears 
to be present in plasma and urine in conjugated forms, mainly 
glucuronoconjugates, suggesting extensive first-pass intestinal/hepatic 
metabolism of the ingested hydroxytyrosol.

new extraction technique for organic compounds in aqueous samples, in which 
analytes are extracted from the sample directly into an open tubular capillary 
by repeated draw/eject cycles of sample solution. Daidzein, genistein and their 
glucosides tested in this study were clearly separated within 8 min by HPLC 
using an XDB-C8 column with diode array detection. In order to optimize the 
extraction of these compounds, several in-tube SPME parameters were examined. 
The glucosides daidzin and genistin were analyzed as aglycones after hydrolysis 
because the glucosides were not concentrated by in-tube SPME. The optimum 
extraction conditions for daidzein and genistein were obtained with 20 
draw/eject cycles of 40 microl of sample using a Supel-Q porous layer open 
tubular capillary column. The extracted compounds were easily desorbed from the 
capillary by mobile phase flow, and carryover was not observed. Using the 
in-tube SPME-HPLC method, the calibration curves of these compounds were linear 
in the range 5-200 ng/ml, with a correlation coefficient above 0.9999 (n = 18), 
and the detection limits (S/N = 3) were 0.4-0.5 ng/ml. This method was 
successfully applied to the analysis of soybean foods without interference 
peaks. The recoveries of aglycones and glucosides spiked into food samples were 
above 97%.

Eriocitrin, a flavonoid glycoside present in lemon fruit, is metabolized in vivo 
to a series of eriodictyol, methylated eriodictyol, 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic 
acid, and their conjugates. Plasma antioxidant activity increased following oral 
administration of aqueous eriocitrin solutions to rats. Eriocitrin metabolites 
were found in plasma and renal excreted urine through HPLC and LC-MS analyses. 
Eriocitrin was not detected in plasma and urine, but eriodictyol, 
homoeriodictyol, and hesperetin in their conjugated forms were detected in 
plasma of 4.0 h following administration of eriocitrin. In urine for 24 h, both 
nonconjugates and conjugates of these metabolites were detected. 
3,4-Dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, which is metabolized from eriodictyol by 
intestinal bacteria, was detected in slight amounts with each form in 4.0-h 
plasma and 24-h urine. Eriocitrin was suggested to be metabolized by intestinal 
bacteria, and then eriodictyol and 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic of its metabolite 
were absorbed. Following administration of eriocitrin, plasma exhibited an 
elevated resistance effect to lipid peroxidation. Eriocitrin metabolites 
functioning as antioxidant agents are discussed.

An HPLC method was developed and validated for the quantification of sesaminol 
triglucoside and a sesaminol diglucoside in sesame seeds. These two lignans were 
isolated, and their structures were characterized by mass and nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy. Defatted sesame flour was extracted first with 85% 
ethanol for 5 h followed by 70% ethanol for 10 h at room temperature using 
naringenin as internal standard. Analysis of 65 different samples of sesame 
seeds indicated that the content of sesaminol triglucoside ranged from 36 to 
1560 mg/100 g of seed (mean 637 +/- 312) and that of sesaminol diglucoside 
ranged from 0 to 493 mg/100 g of seed (mean 75 +/- 95). No significant 
difference was found between sesaminol glucoside contents in black and white 
seeds.

The monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric flavan-3-ol composition of wines, grape 
seeds, and skins from Vitis vinifera L. cv. Graciano, Tempranillo, and Cabernet 
Sauvignon has been studied using (1) fractionation by polyamide column 
chromatography followed by HPLC/ESI-MS analysis, (2) fractionation on C(18) 
Sep-Pak cartridges followed by reaction with vanillin and acid-catalyzed 
degradation in the presence of toluene-alpha-thiol (thiolysis). The content of 
monomers ((+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin), procyanidin dimers (B3, B1, B4, and 
B2), trimers (T2 and C1), and dimer gallates (B2-3-O-gallate, B2-3'-O-gallate, 
and B1-3-O-gallate) ranged from 76.93 to 133.18 mg/L in wines, from 2.30 to 8.21 
mg/g in grape seeds, and from 0.14 to 0.38 mg/g in grape skins. In wines, the 
polymeric fraction represented 77-84% of total flavan-3-ols and showed a mean 
degree of polymerization (mDP) value of 6.3-13.0. In grapes, the polymeric 
fraction represented 75-81% of total flavan-3-ols in seeds and 94-98% in skins 
and showed mDP values of 6.4-7.3 in seeds and 33.8-85.7 in skins. All the 
monomeric flavan-3-ols and oligomeric procyanidins found in wines were also 
present in seeds, although differences in their relative abundances were seen. 
The skin polymeric proanthocyanidins participated in the equilibration of the 
wine polymeric proanthocyanidin fraction, especially contributing to the polymer 
subunit composition and mDP.

Mutagenic heterocyclic amines (HAs) are formed at low levels during cooking of 
meat and fish, and some of them are considered to be possible human carcinogens. 
The formation of HAs may be affected by the presence of synthetic or naturally 
occurring antioxidants. In the present study the effect of virgin olive oil 
(VOO) phenolic compounds, identified and quantified by LC-MS, on the formation 
of HAs in a model system was evaluated. An aqueous solution of creatinine, 
glucose, and glycine was heated in the presence of two samples of VOO differing 
only in the composition of phenolic compounds. The addition of VOO to the model 
system inhibited the formation of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline 
(IQx), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), and 
2-amino-3,7,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx) by between 30 and 50% 
compared with the control. Fresh-made olive oil, which contained a high amount 
of dihydroxyphenylethanol derivatives, inhibited HA formation more than a 
1-year-old oil did. The inhibition of HA formation was also verified using 
phenolic compounds extracted from VOO.

Biochanin A (BCA) is a dietary isoflavone present in legumes, most notably red 
clover, and in many herbal dietary supplements. BCA has been reported to have 
chemopreventive properties and is metabolized to the isoflavone genistein (GEN), 
BCA conjugates, and GEN conjugates. The metabolites may contribute to the 
chemopreventive effects of BCA. The absorption, metabolism, and disposition of 
BCA have not been determined in rats. Our objective was to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics and metabolism of BCA in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were 
administered BCA by intravenous injection (1 and 5 mg/kg), by intraperitoneal 
injection (5 and 50 mg/kg), and orally (5 and 50 mg/kg). Plasma and bile samples 
were enzymatically hydrolyzed in vitro to determine conjugate concentrations for 
BCA and GEN. Equilibrium dialysis was used to determine protein binding. The BCA 
and GEN concentrations in plasma, urine, and bile were determined by liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The pharmacokinetic 
parameters of BCA were analyzed by noncompartmental analysis. Significant levels 
of BCA conjugates and GEN conjugates were detected in plasma and bile. Both BCA 
and GEN were found to have a high clearance and a large apparent volume of 
distribution; the bioavailability of both was poor (<4%). Reentry peaks were 
evident after oral administration of both BCA and GEN, suggesting enterohepatic 
cycling. The free fraction of BCA in rat plasma was 1.5%. A 2-compartment model 
that included both linear and nonlinear clearance terms and enterohepatic 
recirculation best described the plasma data. This represents the first 
evaluation of the dose-dependent pharmacokinetics and metabolism of BCA in rats.

The purpose of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetics of quercetin 
aglycone as well as its conjugated metabolites and to develop a population 
pharmacokinetic model for quercetin that incorporates enterohepatic 
recirculation. The stability of quercetin in different matrices at various 
temperatures and pH, and the quercetin content of six capsules of the herbal 
preparation Quercetin-500 Plus were determined by HPLC. Subjects received 
quercetin 500 mg three times daily and blood and urine samples were obtained. 
The concentration of quercetin aglycone and conjugated metabolites were assayed 
using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. Pharmacokinetic 
parameters were determined using noncompartmental analysis with WinNonlin. A 
population compartment model incorporating input from the gallbladder was 
developed to account for the enterohepatic recirculation observed with 
quercetin. The oral clearance (CL/F) was high (3.5 x 10(4)l/h) with an average 
terminal half-life of 3.5 h for quercetin. The plasma concentration versus time 
curves exhibited re-entry peaks. A one-compartment model that included 
enterohepatic recirculation best described the plasma data. This represents the 
first comprehensive evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and enterohepatic 
recirculation of quercetin in humans. Population pharmacokinetic models adapted 
for enterohepatic recirculation allowed an assessment of the magnitude and 
frequency of the enterohepatic recirculation process.

Extrusion cooking and amylase addition are two processing methods used for the 
preparation of high energy dense (ED) gruels of suitable consistency. A 
quantitative study of energy and nutrient intakes of 67 infants aged 6 to 10 
months in rural areas in Vietnam was carried out to compare the effects of these 
processes used alone or in combination. Twice a day, for a period of four days 
each, infants successively ate four gruels prepared from different flours based 
on a blend of rice, sesame and soybean: an instant flour obtained by extrusion 
cooking (gruel A), a ready-to-cook flour obtained by extrusion cooking plus 
alpha-amylase addition (gruel B), a flour produced by milling crude rice, sesame 
and roasted soybean plus alpha-amylase addition (gruel C) and without amylase 
(control gruel D). Gruels A, B and C had a high ED of respectively 94, 122 and 
124 kcal/100 g while the control gruel D had a low ED (59 kcal/100 g). The 
intakes of the four gruels were inversely linked to their ED. However, despite 
the fact that gruels B and C had similar ED, larger intakes were obtained with 
gruel B, which was attributed to better acceptability. The average energy 
intakes of high ED gruels A, B and C, respectively 112, 134 and 117 kcal/meal, 
were significantly higher than that of gruel D (81 kcal/meal). Of the three 
processing methods, the one combining extrusion cooking and amylase addition 
gave the best results in terms of gruel acceptability and energy intake.

A simple and reproducible method for qualitative and quantitative analysis of 
phenolic compounds in virgin olive oils by solid-phase extraction (SPE), high 
performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), and 
HPLC-mass spectrometry (MS) in tandem mode was developed. The polar fraction was 
obtained from samples of three different virgin olive oils. Detection and 
quantification were performed at 280, 240, and 320 nm. For identification 
purposes, HPLC-MS/MS was equipped with turbo ion spray source in the 
negative-ion mode. Twenty compounds of twenty-three detected and quantified were 
characterized. The method showed satisfactory linearity (r > 0.99), good 
recovery, satisfactory precision, and appropriate limits of detection (LOD) and 
quantification (LOQ).

The intake of alkylresorcinols and lignans in Spain is unknown due to the lack 
of information on the content of these compounds in particular foods. This paper 
describes the development of the first alkylresorcinol and lignan database 
adapted to the Spanish diet, including foods items especially relevant for this 
population. The values of alkylresorcinols and lignans in common foods and 
beverages were collected from scientific publications in refereed journals, and 
other foods particularly consumed in Spain, for which values were not available, 
were analyzed by standardized protocols and included into the database. The 
Alignia database presents the content of alkylresorcinols in 88 food items and 
the lignan content of 593 foods and beverages. Using the database, the intake of 
lignans in Spain, calculated using data from the Food Composition Panel based on 
household consumption, was estimated to be 0.76 mg/day.

The presence of stilbenes in wine is becoming an important issue due to their 
claimed relation to a low incidence in coronary diseases and their increasing 
implication as cancer chemopreventive and neuroprotective agents. Total 
resveratrol content, quantified as glucoside and aglycone forms of resveratrol, 
has been determined in a survey of 45 Monastrell monovarietal Spanish red wine 
types (around 135 wine samples), belonging to Alicante and Bullas appellations. 
The average between ratio glucoside/aglycone forms of resveratrol in these wines 
was considerably high, ranging from 82 to 91% of resveratrol in its glycosidic 
form. This characteristic was observed in a high percentage of the studied 
wines, which were made under different winemaking procedures, and from different 
vintages (1995-2002). In addition, wines made using macerative fermentations 
with double amount of solid parts (""doble pasta"") reached the highest levels of 
total stilbene content expressed as resveratrol equivalent, i.e., 30 mg/L 
(average of 18.8 mg/L). It can be concluded that high resveratrol glucoside 
concentration and low free isomer content can be considered characteristics of 
the Monastrell variety, as it happens to red wines deriving from other varieties 
grown at warm climates. This fact, also observed for other French and Portuguese 
red varieties, might play an important role in food habits involving these types 
of wines.

Plasma levels of the lignans enterodiol and enterolactone, and also the 
isoflavonic phyto-oestrogens daidzein, equol and genistein, are reported for 
postmenopausal Australian women consuming a traditional diet supplemented with 
linseed, soya flour or clover sprouts. Analysis was performed by gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry, after enzymatic hydrolysis and ion-exchange 
chromatography. Following linseed supplementation, combined levels of 
enterolactone and enterodiol reached 500 ng/ml, whereas after soya flour or 
clover sprouts the respective concentrations of equol, daidzein and genistein 
reached 43, 312 and 148 ng/ml. Not all subjects were able to produce equol from 
daidzein. The possible relationship and role of these weak dietary oestrogens as 
restraining factors in the development of hormone-dependent cancers in Asian 
populations is discussed.

Fruits from 107 genotypes of Vaccinium L., Rubus L., and Ribes L., were analyzed 
for total anthocyanins (ACY), total phenolics (TPH), and antioxidant capacities 
as determined by oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC) and ferric reducing 
antioxidant power (FRAP). Fruit size was highly correlated (r = 0.84) with ACY 
within Vaccinium corymbosum L., but was not correlated to ACY across eight other 
Vaccinium species, or within 27 blackberry hybrids. Certain Vaccinium and Ribes 
fruits with pigmented flesh were lower in ACY, TPH, ORAC, and FRAP compared to 
those values in berries with nonpigmented flesh. ORAC values ranged from 19 to 
131 micromol Trolox equivalents/g in Vaccinium, from 13 to 146 in Rubus, and 
from 17 to 116 in Ribes. Though ACY may indicate TPH, the range observed in 
ACY/TPH ratios precludes prediction of ACY from TPH and vice versa for a single 
genotype. In general, TPH was more highly correlated to antioxidant capacity 
than ACY was. This study demonstrates the wide diversity of phytochemical levels 
and antioxidant capacities within and across three genera of small fruit.

The health-promoting effects of whole-grain wheat likely derive from phenolic 
compounds and other antioxidants that also make wheat a potential source of 
functional food ingredients. The objective of this study was to determine the 
effects of genotype and growing environment on the phenolic contents and 
antioxidant activities of alcohol-soluble extracts from commercial wheat 
cultivars. Total phenolic contents (TPCs), antioxidant activities (AOAs), and 
concentrations of six phenolic acids were measured in six red- and white-grained 
hard spring wheat genotypes grown at four diverse locations in Western Canada 
during the 2003 crop year. There were significant differences among genotypes 
and environments for TPC, AOA, and concentrations of all the phenolic acids 
measured. The predominant indicators of antioxidant potential, i.e., TPC, AOA, 
and ferulic acid (FA) concentration were highly intercorrelated (r > 0.72). For 
these indices, the Canada Western (CW) Red Spring wheat cultivars Neepawa and AC 
Elsa had the highest levels, whereas an analogous CW hard white spring wheat 
cultivar, AC Snowbird, had the lowest levels. Grain color did not appear to be a 
factor in the expression of antioxidant-related parameters. For both TPC and 
AOA, as well as for vanillic acid, syringic acid, and ferulic acid, 
environmental effects were considerably larger than genotype effects. Neither 
growing temperature nor rainfall from anthesis to maturity appeared to be 
related to the environmental variation that was observed. Genotype x environment 
interaction was small for all parameters compared with genotype and location 
effects and was significant only for TPC. Genotype variation for antioxidant 
properties indicates that it would be possible to select for these quantitative 
traits in a breeding program. However, the significant environmental variation 
observed would delay and/or complicate this process.

Samples of commercially prepared white, whole wheat, flax, and multigrain breads 
were analyzed by a rapid RP-HPLC method for the presence of the lignan 
secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG). SDG was detected only in products 
containing flax, with concentrations ranging from 0.06 to 1.98 microM/g of DW 
(19-602 microM/loaf). Full-fat flax meal, powdered aqueous alcohol extracts of 
flax seed, and SDG were added to a white bread mix and baked into loaves in a 
domestic bread maker. Quantitative recovery of SDG from the test breads was 
observed when SDG was added; however, when flax meal or aqueous alcohol extracts 
were added, only 73-75% of the theoretical yield of SDG was recovered. SDG was 
also detected in commercially prepared flax cookies, bagels, and muffins with 
concentrations ranging from 0.26 to 2.93 microM/g of DW. The extent of grinding 
of the flax seed was also shown to have a significant effect on the recovery of 
SDG from both flax meal breads and baked goods, with extraction of SDG from 
finely ground samples greater than that from course material.

A HPLC-MS procedure for the sensitive and specific analysis of the black tea 
flavonoid theaflavin in human plasma and urine was developed. Levels were 
measured after enzymatic deconjugation, extraction into ethyl acetate, and 
separation by HPLC, using tandem mass spectrometry as a detecting system. Two 
healthy volunteers consumed 700 mg theaflavins, equivalent to about 30 cups of 
black tea. The maximum concentration detected in blood plasma was 1.0 microg 
l(-1) in a sample collected after 2 h. The concentration in urine also peaked 
after 2 h at 4.2 microg l(-1). Hence, only minute amounts of theaflavins can be 
detected in plasma and urine samples of healthy volunteers after ingestion.

Scottish-grown red raspberries are a rich source of vitamin C and phenolics, 
most notably, the anthocyanins cyanidin-3-sophoroside, 
cyanidin-3-(2(G)-glucosylrutinoside), and cyanidin-3-glucoside, and two 
ellagitannins, sanguiin H-6 and lambertianin C, which are present together with 
trace levels of flavonols, ellagic acid, and hydroxycinnamates. The antioxidant 
capacity of the fresh fruit and the levels of vitamin C and phenolics were not 
affected by freezing. When fruit were stored at 4 degrees C for 3 days and then 
at 18 degrees C for 24 h, mimicking the route fresh fruit takes after harvest to 
the supermarket and onto the consumer's table, anthocyanin levels were 
unaffected while vitamin C levels declined and those of elligitannins increased, 
and overall, there was no effect on the antioxidant capacity of the fruit. It is 
concluded, therefore, that freshly picked, fresh commercial, and frozen 
raspberries all contain similar levels of phytochemicals and antioxidants per 
serving.

It is essential to have a thorough knowledge of the bioavailability and 
metabolism of dietary flavonols to understand their role in disease prevention. 
Lightly fried onions containing 275 micromol flavonols, principally 
quercetin-4'-glucoside and quercetin-3,4'-diglucoside, were fed to healthy human 
volunteers and plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period. Samples were 
analysed by HPLC with diode array and tandem mass spectrometric detection. Five 
flavonol metabolites, quercetin-3'-sulphate, quercetin-3-glucuronide, 
isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide, a quercetin diglucuronide and a quercetin 
glucuronide sulphate, were detected in plasma in quantifiable amounts with trace 
quantities of six additional quercetin metabolites. Sub-micromolar peak plasma 
concentrations (Cmax) of quercetin-3'-sulphate, quercetin-3-glucuronide, 
isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide and quercetin diglucuronide were observed 0.6-0.8 h 
after ingestion. In contrast, the Cmax of quercetin glucuronide sulphate was 2.5 
h. The elimination half-lives (t1/2) of quercetin-3'-sulphate, 
quercetin-3-glucuronide and quercetin diglucuronide were 1.71, 2.33 and 1.76 h 
respectively, while the t1/2 of isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide was 5.34 h and that 
of quercetin glucuronide sulphate was 4.54 h. The profile of metabolites 
excreted in urine was markedly different to that of plasma with many of the 
major urinary components, including quercetin-3'-glucuronide, two quercetin 
glucoside sulphates and a methylquercetin diglucuronide, absent or present in 
only trace amounts in the bloodstream indicative of substantial phase II 
metabolism. Total urinary excretion of quercetin metabolites was 12.9 micromol, 
corresponding to 4.7 % of intake. If these samples had been subjected to 
hydrolysis, as in many previous studies, only quercetin and isorhamnetin would 
have been detected and quantified. The bioactivity of these metabolites should 
be considered.

The bioavailability of dietary phytochemicals may be influenced by the food 
matrix in which they are consumed. In this study the impact of a full-fat yogurt 
on the bioavailability and metabolism of orange juice flavanones was 
investigated. Human plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period after the 
consumption of 250 mL of orange juice containing a total of 168 micromol of 
hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside and 12 micromol of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside, with and 
without 150 mL of full-fat yogurt. The juice also contained 1 g of paracetamol 
and 5 g of lactulose. HPLC-MS(2) analysis revealed the accumulation of 
hesperetin-7-O-glucuronide, and an unassigned hesperetin-O-glucuronide 
metabolite in plasma reached a peak concentration (C(max)) of 924 +/- 224 
nmol/L, 4.4 +/- 0.5 h (T(max)) after orange juice ingestion. The T(max) is 
indicative of absorption in the colon. When the juice was consumed with yogurt, 
neither the C(max) at 661 +/- 170 nmol/L nor the T(max) at 5.1 +/- 0.4 h were 
significantly different from those obtained with juice alone. The two hesperetin 
glucuronides were also excreted in urine along with a third 
hesperetin-O-glucuronide, two hesperetin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfates, a 
hesperetin-O-diglucuronide, a naringenin-O-diglucuronide, and, tentatively 
identified, naringenin-7-O-glucuronide and naringenin-4'-O-glucuronide. This 
indicates the occurrence of substantial, postabsorption, phase II metabolism 
prior to urinary excretion. The quantity of flavanone metabolites excreted 0-5 h 
after orange juice ingestion was significantly reduced by yogurt, but over the 
full 0-24 h urine collection period, the amounts excreted, corresponding to ca. 
7.0% of intake, were not affected by the addition of yogurt to the drink. Nor 
did yogurt have a significant effect on gastric emptying, as determined by 
plasma paracetamol levels, or on the mouth to cecum transit time of the head of 
the meal, assessed by measurement of lactulose-derived breath hydrogen. There is 
also a discussion of the merits of studies of the absorption and metabolism of 
flavanones based on direct analysis of metabolites by HPLC-MS and the more 
traditional indirect approach where samples are treated with a mollusc

Plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period after the consumption by 
humans of 200 g of strawberries, containing 222 micromol of pelargonidin-3- 
O-glucoside, with and without cream. The main metabolite, a pelargonidin- 
O-glucuronide, reached a peak plasma concentration ( C max) of 274 +/- 24 nmol/L 
after 1.1 +/- 0.4 h ( t max) when only strawberries were ingested. When the 
strawberries were eaten with cream, the C max was not statistically different 
but the t max at 2.4 +/- 0.5 h was delayed significantly ( p < 0.001). The 
pelargonidin- O-glucuronide, along with smaller quantities of other metabolites, 
was also excreted in urine in quantities corresponding to ca. 1% of anthocyanin 
intake. The quantities excreted over the 0-24 h collection period were not 
influenced significantly by cream. However, the 0-2 h excretion of anthocyanin 
metabolites was significantly lower when the strawberries were eaten with cream, 
whereas the reverse occurred during with the 5-8 h excretion period. In keeping 
with these observations, measurement of plasma paracetamol and breath hydrogen 
revealed that cream delayed gastric emptying and extended mouth to cecum transit 
time.

The study of human metabolism of 
endo-8[bis(2-chlorophenyl)methyl]-3-(2-pyrimidinyl)-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-ol 
(SCH 486757) after a 200-mg oral dose of the drug to healthy volunteers in the 
first-in-human study is presented. The structural elucidation of two unique 
metabolites, which were detected in the process of metabolite characterization 
in human plasma and urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), is 
described. These metabolites (M27 and M34) were initially detected in human 
plasma at high levels (>35% of the LC-MS response of the parent drug). 
Additional LC-MS experiments (hydrogen/deuterium exchange and accurate mass 
measurement) were used to determine structures of metabolites. It was found that 
both metabolites were formed through a loss of the C-C bridge from the tropane 
moiety with the conversion into a substituted pyridinium compound. This 
metabolic process has not been reported previously. Because of the apparent high 
abundance of metabolites based on the LC-MS response, actual circulating amounts 
of these metabolites relative to the parent drug were determined 
semiquantitatively to evaluate their coverage in preclinical species. With the 
use of reference standards, it was shown that the LC-MS response of M27 and M34 
in human plasma was much higher than that of the parent compound. Actual amounts 
of M27 and M34 metabolites were less than 5% of the level of the parent drug; 
therefore, additional assessment was not required.

A national sampling plan was developed to select the most widely used 
isoflavone-containing foods in the United States. Foods were selected based on 
their retail volume and sampled in five geographical areas representing seven 
metropolitan areas. Isoflavones were analyzed from composite samples, raw and 
cooked, and reported by brand. Quality control measures were evaluated 
throughout the study. Isoflavone levels ranged from 1 microg/g in soy sauces to 
540 microg/g in tempeh. Soymilk and tofu represented the major portion of soy 
foods evaluated. These data will appear in the electronic version of USDA

A fresh vegetable juice has become a new functional food available for dieting 
and health. However, it poses a microbiological hazard to the consumer because 
it is distributed and consumed without any cooking. In this study, we applied 
the radiation sterilization of fresh vegetable juice, and the effectiveness of 
gamma irradiation for inactivating Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli 
in the carrot and kale juice was investigated. D((10)) values of S. typhimurium 
in the carrot and kale juice were 0.445+/-0.004 and 0.441+/-0.006 kGy, while 
those of E. coli were 0.301+/-0.005 and 0.299+/-0.006 kGy. The test organisms 
(inoculated at 10(7) cfu/ml) were eliminated by irradiation at 3 kGy. The total 
phenol contents of the irradiated juice during 3 days of storage at a cold chain 
temperature (10 degrees C) increased significantly (P<0.05), while those of the 
non-irradiated juice decreased (P<0.05). The antioxidant capacity of the 
irradiated carrot juice was higher than that of the non-irradiated control. 
Therefore, it was concluded that irradiation treatments of carrot and kale juice 
improve the microbiological safety with maintaining or even enhancing the 
antioxidative activity.

Neochlorogenic acid (3-CQA) and cryptochlorogenic acid (4-CQA), isolated from 
prune (Prunus domestica L.), were identified by NMR and MS analyses. In 
addition, the quantity of chlorogenic acid isomers in prune were measured by 
HPLC. These isomers, 3-CQA, 4-CQA, and chlorogenic acid (5-CQA), were contained 
in the ratio 78.7:18. 4:3.9, respectively. 4-CQA was identified and quantified 
in prune for the first time, and relatively high amounts of this isomer were 
characteristic. Antioxidative activities of the chlorogenic acid isomers, such 
as scavenging activity on superoxide anion radicals and inhibitory effect 
against oxidation of methyl linoleate, were also evaluated. Each isomer showed 
antioxidative activities which were almost the same.

Despite extensive literature describing the biological effects of polyphenols, 
little is known about their absorption from diet, one major unresolved point 
consisting of the absorption of the bound forms of polyphenols. In this view, in 
the present work we studied the absorption in humans of phenolic acids from 
coffee, a common beverage particularly rich in bound phenolic acids, such as 
caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid. Coffee brew was analyzed for 
free and total (free + bound) phenolic acids. Chlorogenic acid 
(5'-caffeoylquinic acid), a bound form of caffeic acid, was present in coffee at 
high levels, while free phenolic acids were undetectable. After alkaline 
hydrolysis, which released bound phenolic acids, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, 
and high levels of caffeic acid were detected. Plasma samples were collected 
before and 1 and 2 h after coffee administration and analyzed for free and total 
phenolic acid content. Two different procedures were applied to release bound 
phenolic acids in plasma: beta-glucuronidase treatment and alkaline hydrolysis. 
Coffee administration resulted in increased total plasma caffeic acid 
concentration, with an absorption peak at 1 h. Caffeic acid was the only 
phenolic acid found in plasma samples after coffee administration, while 
chlorogenic acid was undetectable. Most of caffeic acid was present in plasma in 
bound form, mainly in the glucuronate/sulfate forms. Due to the absence of free 
caffeic acid in coffee, plasma caffeic acid is likely to be derived from 
hydrolysis of chlorogenic acid in the gastrointestinal tract.

In spite of the wide literature describing the biological effects of phenolic 
compounds, scarce data are available on their absorption from diet. In the 
present work, we studied the absorption in humans of phenolic acids from beer, a 
common beverage rich in different phenolic acids with related chemical 
structures. Beer was analyzed for free and total (free+bound) phenolic acids. 
Ferulic, caffeic and sinapic acids were present in beer mainly as bound forms, 
while 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and p-coumaric acid were present mainly as free 
forms. Vanillic acid was present equally in the free and bound forms. Plasma 
samples were collected before and 30 and 60 min after beer administration and 
analyzed for free and conjugated phenolic acid content. A significant two- to 
fourfold increase in plasma levels of phenolic acids was detected with peak 
concentrations at 30 min after beer ingestion. 4-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid was 
present in plasma mainly as nonconjugated forms while p-coumaric acid was 
present equally as nonconjugated and conjugated forms. Ferulic, vanillic and 
caffeic acids were present in plasma predominantly as conjugated forms, with a 
slight prevalence of sulfates with respect to glucuronates. Our results indicate 
that phenolic acids from beer are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and 
are present in blood after being largely metabolized to the form of glucuronide 
and sulfate conjugates. The extent of conjugation is related to the chemical 
structure of phenolic acids: the monohydroxy derivatives showing the lowest 
conjugation degree and the dihydroxy derivatives showing the highest one.

The phenolic composition, aroma compounds, and organic acid content of 83 
vinegars have been determined. Multivariate analysis techniques have been used 
to classify these vinegar samples according to raw material (white wine, red 
wine, apple, honey, alcohol, balsamic, and malt) and production process (with 
and without aging in wood). Cluster analysis grouped the samples according to 
production process. Only apple and balsamic vinegars were separated from wine 
vinegars. Alcohol, honey, and malt vinegars were grouped with no aged wine 
vinegars. Linear discriminate analysis allowed a 88% differentiation according 
to raw material and 100% according to aging in wood. Besides, from the results 
obtained, a major role of the volatile compounds in the differentiation of the 
vinegar samples according to their aging period in wood can be seen.

The antioxidant polyphenols in cacao liquor, a major ingredient of chocolate and 
cocoa, have been characterized as flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidin oligomers. 
In this study, various cacao products were analyzed by normal-phase HPLC, and 
the profiles and quantities of the polyphenols present, grouped by molecular 
size (monomers to approximately oligomers), were compared. Individual cacao 
polyphenols, flavan-3-ols (catechin and epicatechin), and dimeric (procyanidin 
B2), trimeric (procyanidin C1), and tetrameric (cinnamtannin A2) 
proanthocyanidins, and galactopyranosyl-ent-(-)-epicatechin (2alpha-->7, 
4alpha-->8)-(-)-epicatechin (Gal-EC-EC), were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC 
and/or HPLC/MS. The profile of monomers (catechins) and proanthocyanidin in dark 
chocolate was similar to that of cacao liquor, while the ratio of flavan-3-ols 
to the total amount of monomeric and oligomeric polyphenols in the case of pure 
cocoa powder was higher than that in the case of cacao liquor or chocolate.

(-)-epicatechin is one of the most potent antioxidants present in the human 
diet. Particularly high levels are found in black tea, apples, and chocolate. 
High intake of catechins has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular 
diseases. There have been several reports concerning the bioavailability of 
catechins, however, the chemical structure of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in 
blood, tissues, and urine remains unclear. In the present study, we purified and 
elucidated the chemical structure of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in human and 
rat urine after oral administration. Three metabolites were purified from human 
urine including (-)-epicatechin-3'-O-glucuronide, 
4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-3'-O-glucuronide, and 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-5 
or 7-O-glucuronide, according to 1H- and 13C-NMR, HMBC, and LC-MS analyses. The 
metabolites purified from rat urine were 3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin, 
(-)-epicatechin-7-O-glucuronide, and 
3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-7-O-glucuronide. These compounds were also detected 
in the blood of humans and rats by LC-MS. The presence of these metabolites in 
blood and urine suggests that catechins are metabolized and circulated in the 
body after administration of catechin-containing foods.

Apoptosis-induced directed fractionation and purification was used to identify 
the bioactive components of hard clams (HC), Meretrix lusoria. Two stereoisomers 
of epidioxysterol were previously identified as the active compounds in the 
ethyl acetate fraction (HC-EA). The molecular mechanism of HC-EA-induced 
apoptosis was also investigated in this study. Dissipation of mitochondrial 
membrane potential, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into cytosol, and 
subsequent induction of pro-caspase-9 and -3 processing preceded apoptosis in 
HL-60 cells, confirmed by DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, changes in 
the cell membrane and the appearance of a sub-G1 DNA peak. Furthermore, 
treatment with HC-EA caused a rapid loss of intracellular glutathione content 
and stimulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Antioxidants such as catalase, 
N-acetylcysteine, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and superoxide dismutase, but not 
allopurinol and diphenylene iodonium, significantly inhibited HC-EA-induced cell 
death. Apoptosis was completely prevented by a pan-caspase inhibitor, 
z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (z-VAD-FMK). The induction of apoptosis by M. 
lusoria may prove to be a pivotal mechanism for its cancer chemopreventive 
action.

Catechins are polyphenolic plant compounds (flavonoids) that may offer 
significant health benefits to humans. These benefits stem largely from their 
anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, and antimutagenic properties. Recent 
epidemiological studies suggest that the consumption of flavonoid-containing 
foods is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Chocolate is a 
natural cocoa bean-based product that reportedly contains high levels of 
monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric catechins. We have applied solid-liquid 
extraction and liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical 
ionization-mass spectrometry to the identification and determination of the 
predominant monomeric catechins, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin, in a baking 
chocolate Standard Reference Material (NIST Standard Reference Material 2384). 
(+)-Catechin and (-)-epicatechin are detected and quantified in chocolate 
extracts on the basis of selected-ion monitoring of their protonated [M + H](+) 
molecular ions. Tryptophan methyl ester is used as an internal standard. The 
developed method has the capacity to accurately quantify as little as 0.1 
microg/mL (0.01 mg of catechin/g of chocolate) of either catechin in chocolate 
extracts, and the method has additionally been used to certify (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin levels in the baking chocolate Standard Reference Material. This 
is the first reported use of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry for the 
quantitative determination of monomeric catechins in chocolate and the only 
report certifying monomeric catechin levels in a food-based Standard Reference 
Material.

Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

BACKGROUND: The mammalian lignans enterolactone and enterodiol are produced in 
the colon by the action of bacteria on the plant precursor secoisolariciresinol 
diglycoside, which is found in high concentrations in flaxseed.
OBJECTIVE: Two experiments were conducted to determine 1) whether there is a 
dose response in urinary lignan excretion with increasing flaxseed intake, 2) 
whether flaxseed processing affects lignan excretion, 3) peak plasma lignan 
concentrations, and 4) plasma lignan concentrations after chronic 
supplementation.
DESIGN: Nine healthy young women supplemented their diets with 5, 15, or 25 g 
raw or 25 g processed (muffin or bread) flaxseed for 7 d during the follicular 
phase of their menstrual cycles. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected 
at baseline and on the final day of supplementation. As an adjunct to the 
25-g-flaxseed arm, subjects consumed the supplement for an additional day and 
blood and urine samples were collected at specific intervals. All blood and 
urine samples were analyzed for enterolactone and enterodiol by gas 
chromatography-mass spectroscopy.
RESULTS: A dose-dependent urinary lignan response to raw flaxseed was observed 
(r = 0.72, P < 0.001). The processing of flaxseed as a muffin or bread did not 
affect the quantity of lignan excretion. Plasma lignan concentrations were 
greater (P < or = 0.05) than baseline by 9 h after flaxseed ingestion 
(29.35+/-3.69 and 51.75+/-7.49 nmol/L, respectively). The total plasma area 
under the curve was higher on the eighth than on the first day (1840.15+/-343.02 
and 1027.15+/-95.71 nmol x h/L, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Mammalian lignan production from flaxseed precursors is dependent on 
time and dose but not on processing.

Hesperidin is the predominant polyphenol consumed from citrus fruits and juices. 
However, hesperidin is proposed to have limited bioavailability due to the 
rutinoside moiety attached to the flavonoid. The aim of this study was to 
demonstrate in human subjects that the removal of the rhamnose group to yield 
the corresponding flavonoid glucoside (i.e., hesperetin-7-glucoside) will 
improve the bioavailability of the aglycone hesperetin. Healthy volunteers 
(n=16) completed the double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Subjects 
randomly consumed hesperetin equivalents supplied as orange juice with natural 
hesperidin (""low dose""), orange juice treated with hesperidinase enzyme to yield 
hesperetin-7-glucoside, and orange juice fortified to obtain 3 times more 
hesperidin than naturally present (""high dose""). The area under the curve (AUC) 
for total plasma hesperetin of subjects consuming hesperetin-7-glucoside juice 
was 2-fold higher than that of subjects consuming the ""low"" dose hesperidin 
juice [3.45+/-1.27 vs. 1.16+/-0.52 mmol/(L.h), respectively, P>0.0001]. The AUC 
for hesperetin after consuming the hesperetin-7-glucoside juice was improved to 
the level of the ""high"" dose hesperidin juice [4.16+/-1.50 mmol/(L.h)]. The peak 
plasma concentrations (C(max)) of hesperetin were 4-fold higher (2.60+/-1.07 
mmol/L, P<0.0001) after subjects consumed hesperetin-7-glucoside juice compared 
with those consuming ""low"" dose hesperidin juice (0.48 +/- 0.27 mmol/L), and 
1.5-fold higher than those consuming ""high"" dose hesperidin juice (1.05+/-0.25 
mmol/L). The corresponding T(max) was much faster (0.6+/-0.1 h, P<0.0001) after 
subjects consumed hesperetin-7-glucoside juice compared with ""low"" dose 
(7.0+/-3.0 h) and ""high"" dose (7.4+/-2.0 h) hesperidin juices. The results of 
this study demonstrated that the bioavailability of hesperidin was modulated by 
enzymatic conversion to hesperetin-7-glucoside, thus changing the absorption 
site from the colon to the small intestine. This may affect future interventions 
concerning the health benefits of citrus flavonoids.

The phenolic and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values have been 
measured in six fresh and frozen vegetables (beet green, spinach, broccoli, 
carrot, onion, and celery) from the same cultivar by analyzing the whole juice 
(WJ) and the acetonic extract of the squeezed pulp. To exploit the effect of the 
acid environment on the stability and recovery of the phenolics, perchloric acid 
(PCA) was added directly to WJ and to the pulp before the extraction with 
acetone. In both fresh and frozen vegetables, PCA markedly increased the 
recovery of phenolics extracted from the pulp, but PCA had no effect on the WJ. 
Four of six frozen vegetables showed lower phenolic and ORAC values than the 
fresh vegetables, whereas in the other two cases, values were significantly 
higher compared to fresh samples. Among the fresh vegetables, beet green showed 
the highest ORAC and phenolic values; however, when measured in two different 
cultivars of beet green, the ORAC value showed as much as 4.5-fold variation, 
whereas total phenolics and flavonoids showed 1.2- and 3.5-fold variations, 
respectively. The results show that total phenolics and ORAC, compared in fresh 
and frozen vegetables, represent an index of the mildness of blanching in the 
industry of frozen vegetables and provide a measure of the gap in antioxidants 
in the diet of people who consume frozen instead of fresh vegetables. The plant 
genotype is an important source of variability in the ORAC value, which can be 
conveniently used to increase the intake of antioxidants from vegetables.

Vegetables are the most important sources of phenolics in the Mediterranean 
diet. Phenolics, especially flavonoids, are suggested as being essential 
bioactive compounds providing health benefits. In this study, twenty-seven 
vegetables, fifteen aromatic herbs and some spices consumed in Central Italy 
(the Marches region) were studied to reveal total phenolic, flavonoid and 
flavanol content as well as their antioxidant capacity measured by the oxygen 
radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. A comparison in terms of antioxidant 
capacity was made between different salads, as well as between salads to which 
aromatic herbs had been added. Lemon balm and marjoram at a concentration of 1.5 
% w/w increased by 150 % and 200 % respectively the antioxidant capacity of a 
salad portion. A 200 g portion of a salad enriched with marjoram corresponded to 
an intake of 200 (SD 10) mg phenolics and 4000 (SD 300) ORAC units (micromol 
Trolox equivalents). Olive oils and wine or apple vinegars were the salad 
dressings that provided the highest increase in antioxidant capacity. Among the 
spices tested, cumin and fresh ginger made the most significant contribution to 
the antioxidant capacity. The results are useful in surveying the antioxidant 
parameters of vegetables, herbs and spices produced and consumed in our 
geographical area as well as in quantifying the daily intake of phenolics and 
ORAC units. The results can be used in public health campaigns to stimulate the 
consumption of vegetables able to provide significant health protection in order 
to prevent chronic diseases.

A mandarin-type citrus fruit, ponkan (Citrus reticulata), was processed by 
in-line, chopper pulper, and hand-press extractions to investigate the effect of 
extraction method on the concentrations of bioactive compounds in processed 
juice. Concentrations of polymethoxylated flavones (tangeretin, nobiletin, and 
sinensetin) and beta-cryptoxanthin in juice, and inhibitory activities against 
arachidonate cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenases of the juice extract were 
analyzed. The juice processed by hand-press extraction contained the largest 
amounts of nobiletin (3.56 mg/100 mL), tangeretin (4.10 mg/100 mL), and 
sinensetin (0.13 mg/100 mL). Concentrations of beta-cryptoxanthin were 0.66, 
0.59, 0.55, and 0.50 mg/100 mL in chopper pulper, in-line (5/64 in.), in-line 
(8/64 in.) and hand-press juices, respectively. Both extracts of in-line juices 
showed greater inhibitory activity toward platelet 12-lipoxygenase than the

The moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages has been associated with 
protection against the development of coronary heart disease. Although alcohol 
itself can help prevent coronary heart disease through a number of mechanisms, 
red wine appears to offer protection above and beyond that attributable to 
alcohol alone. Red wine is a complex fluid containing grape, yeast, and 
wood-derived phenolic compounds, the majority of which have been recognized as 
potent antioxidants. The aim of this study was to investigate the major phenolic 
contributors to the antioxidant activity of wine. To this end, four wines were 
followed during the first 7-9 days of vinification. Individual phenolic 
compounds were quantified by HPLC, and antioxidant activity was determined by 
electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The extraction of the phenolics was found 
to be influenced by vinification procedure, grape quality, and grape variety. 
Although fermenting wines reached a total phenolic content comparable to that of 
a bottled wine after 9 days of vinification, the antioxidant activity was 
significantly lower than that of a finished wine. This suggests that the larger 
polyphenolic complexes and condensation products that appear during aging make a 
sizable contribution to the overall antioxidant activity of red wines.

High-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) and mass spectrometric (MS) 
procedures were developed to determine lignans in flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) 
and chaparral (Larrea tridentata). Flaxseed contains high levels of 
phytoestrogens. Chaparral has been associated with acute nonviral toxic 
hepatitis and contains lignans that are structurally similar to known estrogenic 
compounds. Both flaxseed and chaparral products have been marketed as dietary 
supplements. A mild enzyme hydrolysis procedure to prevent the formation of 
artifacts in the isolation step was used in the determination of 
secoisolariciresinol in flaxseed products. HPLC with ultraviolet spectral (UV) 
or MS detection was used as the determinative steps. HPLC procedures with UV 
detection and mass spectrometry were developed to characterize the phenolic 
components, including lignans and flavonoids, of chaparral and to direct 
fractionation studies for the bioassays.

Pea flour (Pisum sativum) is a relatively cheap protein source and it is 
scarcely utilized in making widely consumed products. It provides a good 
opportunity to improve the amino acidic profile. The purpose of this study was 
to determine the effect of the enzymatic inactivation of pea on bread 
characteristics, made with levels of 5, 10 and 15% of pea flour. Protein and 
lysine contents were determined and then chemical score obtained considering 
lysine as limiting amino acid. Sensory evaluation was carry out by six trained 
panelists using quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA) and analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) at p = 0.05. Residual lipoxygenase activity was 48.6% when heat 
treatment was made during 1 minute, and only 2.1% when the heat treatment was 
carry out during 1.5 minutes. Highest specific volumes of bread were obtained 
with pea flour treated during 1 minute. The sensory evaluation by panel 
determined that pea flour at a level of 5% could be successfully substituted for 
both heat treatments. But pea flour substitution at levels of 10 and 15% had 
adverse effects on specific volume and sensory characteristics.

Cranberry, which is rich in polyphenols, including anthocyanins and 
proanthocyanidins, has been found to have various effects beneficial to human 
health, including prevention of urinary tract infections. These effects have 
been associated with polyphenols in the fruit. We investigated the excretion of 
anthocyanins in human urine after ingestion of cranberry juice. Eleven healthy 
volunteers consumed 200 ml of cranberry juice containing 650.8 microg total 
anthocyanins. Urine samples were collected within 24 h before and after 
consumption. Six of 12 anthocyanins identified in cranberry were quantified in 
human urine by HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization and tandem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS-MS). Among these, peonidin 3-O-galactoside, the second 
most plentiful anthocyanin in the juice, was found most abundantly in urine 
within 24 h, corresponding to 41.5 nmol (56.1% of total anthocyanins). The 
urinary levels of anthocyanins reached a maximum between 3 and 6 h after 
ingestion, and the recovery of total anthocyanins in the urine over 24 h was 
estimated to be 5.0% of the amount consumed. This study found high absorption 
and excretion of cranberry anthocyanins in human urine.

Changes occurring in the concentrations of alpha-tocopherol, total phenols, and 
complex phenols linked to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol (fractions FII and FIV) and 
p-hydroxyphenylethanol (FIII) during storage of virgin olive oil under 
environmental conditions were studied. Under diffused light, alpha-tocopherol 
was decomposed by 79% in 4 months, whereas <45% of the phenols were lost during 
the same period. Among the phenols, FII showed the least stability, and 
decreased by 72% in 6 months. Total phenols, FIII, and FIV recorded reductions 
in the range of 57-63% in 6 months. When the oil was stored in the dark, 
alpha-tocopherol, total phenols, FIII, and FIV exhibited similar profiles of 
degradation, reducing by 39-45% in the first 6 months and 50-62% in 12 months. 
FII was the least stable compound in the dark and recorded a loss of 64% in 6 
months and 79% in 12 months. The levels of the above antioxidants were further 
related to peroxide formation. Remaining levels of these compounds at PV = 20 
meq/kg ranged between 50 and 73% under diffused light and between 40 and 62% in 
the dark.

Four cultivars of strawberries (Senga Sengana, BFr77111, Elsanta, and Honeoye) 
were studied for their content of antioxidants, total antioxidant capacity, and 
low molecular weight carbohydrates in relation to harvest year, ripening stage, 
and cold storage. For ascorbic acid, chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, and total 
antioxidative capacity, measured in both water-soluble and water-insoluble 
extracts, there was a 2-5-fold variation among cultivars. Unripe berries 
contained lower concentrations of chlorogenic acid and p-coumaric acid and also 
quercetin and kaempferol compared with riper berries. During cold storage for up 
to 3 days, relatively few changes in the concentration of the different 
antioxidants occurred. The concentrations of several investigated parameters 
were interrelated, for example, for ascorbic acid and water-soluble antioxidant 
capacity and for ellagic acid and water-insoluble antioxidant capacity. The 
dominating sugars in strawberries were fructose and glucose, but considerable 
amounts of sucrose were also present, and their contents varied among cultivars, 
giving a predicted glycemic index of approximately 81. Verbascose, raffinose, 
and stachyose were found in only minor amounts. The study shows that the 
concentration of a number of bioactive compounds in strawberries varied 
according to cultivar, ripening stage, and storage. This information should make 
it possible to select strawberries with an optimal content of bioactive 
compounds.

Dietary phenols are antioxidants, and their consumption might contribute to the 
prevention of cardiovascular disease. Coffee and tea are major dietary sources 
of phenols. Dietary phenols are metabolized extensively in the body. Lack of 
quantitative data on their metabolites hinders a proper evaluation of the 
potential biological effects of dietary phenols in vivo. The aim of this study 
was to identify and quantify the phenolic acid metabolites of chlorogenic acid 
(major phenol in coffee), quercetin-3-rutinoside (major flavonol in tea) and 
black tea phenols in humans, and determine the site of metabolism. Healthy 
humans (n = 20) with an intact colon participated in a dietary controlled 
crossover study, and we identified and quantified approximately 60 potential 
phenolic acid metabolites in urine. Half of the ingested chlorogenic acid and 
43% of the tea phenols were metabolized to hippuric acid. Quercetin-3-rutinoside 
was metabolized mainly to phenylacetic acids, i.e., 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid 
(36%), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (8%) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic 
acid (5%). In contrast, in seven humans without a colon, we found only traces of 
phenolic acid metabolites in urine after they had ingested chlorogenic acid and 
quercetin-3-rutinoside. This implies that the colonic microflora convert most of 
these dietary phenols into metabolites that then reach the circulation. 
Metabolites of dietary phenols have lower antioxidant activity than their parent 
compounds; therefore, the contribution of dietary phenols to antioxidant 
activity in vivo might be lower than expected from in vitro tests.

The antiradical activity of dry beans was evaluated in order to assess the 
validity of this test and to correlate the results with those achieved with the 
Folin-Ciocalteu method and with a rapid spectrophotometric method for the 
analysis of total flavonoids. Four landraces (12 samples) of common beans 
(Phaseolus vulgaris L.), collected in two regions of Italy (Tuscany and 
Basilicata) in three different years, were analyzed. The EC50 values ranged from 
39 to 2810 mg sample/mg 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazil radical. The phenolic 
content of each sample was expressed as gallic acid equivalents; it changed from 
1.17 to 4.40 mg/g. The flavonoid content, expressed as mg of (+)-catechin per g 
of dry seeds, ranged from 0.24 to 1.43 mg/g. The qualiquantitative composition 
of polyphenols has been also elucidated by means of high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC)-diode array detection and HPLC/MS. These investigations 
showed that rapid tests can contribute to assessing the quality of functional 
food.

The antioxidant components of cacao liquor, which is a major ingredient of 
chocolate, were isolated with column chromatography and high-performance liquid 
chromatography. Quercetin and its glucoside were identified by spectrometric 
methods. Clovamide and deoxyclovamide were characterized by (1)H and (13)C NMR 
and MS spectrometry. Their antioxidative activity was measured by peroxide value 
of linoleic acid and thiobarbituric acid reactive-substance value of erythrocyte 
ghost membranes and microsomes. In the bulk oil system, clovamide had the 
strongest antioxidative activity but was less active in the other experiments. 
In the case of the two hydrophilic systems, flavans such as quercetin and 
epicatechin were more potently effective than the glucosides. It is considered 
that chocolate is stable against oxidative deterioration due to the presence of 
these polyphenolic compounds.

Furocoumarins represent a family of natural food constituents with phototoxic 
and photomutagenic properties. They are found mainly in plants belonging to the 
Rutaceae and Umbilliferae such as celery, carrots, and parsnips. Parsnips 
(Pastinaca sativa L.) have become more and more popular as a vegetable, e.g., as 
a constituent of or ingredient in baby food. Previous work has shown that 
microbial infection of parsnip roots can result in a dramatic increase in 
furocoumarin levels. In this study, freshly harvested parsnips were stored as 
whole roots, pieces (cubes), or homogenate at +4 degrees C or -18 degrees C over 
various time periods under standard conditions. It was found that furocoumarin 
concentrations (sum of five furocoumarins: angelicin, isopimpinellin, 
5-methoxypsoralen, 8-methoxypsoralen, and psoralen) in freshly harvested 
parsnips, analyzed by HPLC after extraction with diethyl ether and sequential 
solid phase (reversed-phase and silica) extraction, was generally lower than 2.5 
mg/kg, and storage of parsnips in any form investigated at -18 degrees C over up 
to 50 days did not lead to a marked increase in furocoumarin levels. In 
contrast, storage of whole parsnips, but not of cubes or homogenate, at +4 
degrees C resulted in a marked biphasic increase of furocoumarin concentrations 
after 7 and 38 days of storage up to levels of about 40 mg/kg. A dramatic 
increase in furocoumarin concentrations up to 566 mg/kg was observed when whole 
parsnips obtained from the market were kept at room temperature over 53 days, 
resulting in a visible microbial (mold) infection. Baby food products from the 
German market containing parsnips as an ingredient or constituent showed 
furocoumarin levels < or =0.41 mg/kg, suggesting that properly stored 
roots/preparations have been used. It is recommended that, after harvesting, 
parsnips be kept at -18 degrees C or under other conditions that prevent 
microbial infections.

Organic solvent extraction of three metanephrines (MNs) in supernatant and 
sediment fractions obtained by the addition of methanol to the whole saliva and 
liquid chromatographic analysis with voltammetric detection are described. Two 
milliliters of unstimulated whole saliva obtained from 13 healthy males was 
treated with chilled methanol to separate mucin clots. The mucin clots, 
supernatant, and whole saliva were then hydrolyzed at 98 degrees C for 40 
minutes at pH 0.5-0.8. These hydrolyzed samples were subsequently brought up to 
pH 10.0 with a 6 N NaOH solution in 0.1 M borate buffer (pH 10.0), and then 5-HT 
and MNs were extracted into toluene: isoamylalcohol (3:2) from the basic phase. 
MNs in their organic phase were extracted back into 0.1 M acetic acid and used 
for the high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis. The supernatant 
fraction showed a higher distribution for MNs than the sediment and whole saliva 
fractions. The chromatographic profile obtained from the supernatant and the 
whole saliva fractions contained some serotonin in a pattern similar to that 
reported from urinary analysis. The use of methanol for the fractionation of 
saliva resulted in good differential determination of MNs and revealed their 
distribution in the three salivary fractions. It is attractive to speculate that 
patients undergoing restorative treatment possibly manifest their anxiety by 
salivary excretion containing serotonin and MNs. These compounds in saliva may 
be useful markers of emotional responses.

Because olives represent an important component of the Mediterranean diet, it is 
necessary to establish unequivocal identification and quantitation of the major 
potential antioxidant phenolic compounds they contain. The major phenolic 
antioxidants in two types of brined olives were isolated and purified by 
semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography. Structural analysis was 
conducted using UV spectrophotometry, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy. In particular, completely assigned 1H and 13C NMR data 
are presented and errors in literature data are corrected. The data show that 
tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, 3-(3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid (dihydrocaffeic 
acid), dihydro-p-coumaric acid (phloretic acid), the phenylpropanoid glucosides 
acteoside (verbascoside) and isoacteoside, along with the flavonoids luteolin 
and apigenin are major components of the phenolic fraction of brined black 
olives. Brined green olives contain only hydroxytyrosol and traces of other 
minor phenolics. Brined olives contain even higher concentrations of phenolic 
antioxidants than olive oil and may, therefore, be more important modulators of 
cancer chemopreventive activity.

Several polyphenols have been tested in grape berries from Spain. The flavonoid 
content is important because of the pharmacological properties of these 
compounds, whereas resveratrol has been proved to be an antifungal, 
antiinflammatory and an anticarcinogenic compound. A reversed-phase HPLC method 
has been developed and applied to determine resveratrol, quercetine, quercitrine 
and rutine content in several grape berries samples in a single analysis. 
Covering the grapes with a preservative paper yields a healthier product, but 
one which has a lower polyphenol content than unprotected grapes.

A valid method using liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray 
ionization (ESI) ion trap mass spectrometry was established for the study of the 
absorbed and metabolic components of a Chinese medicine 'Shuangdan' granule in 
rat plasma after oral administration. The plasma samples were acidified with 1M 
hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) of two-fold volume 
for three times. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a Zorbax 
SB-C18 column with a linear gradient whereas 0.1% acetic acid/water/acetonitrile 
was used as mobile phase. Mass spectra were acquired in both negative and 
positive modes. More than 20 components including 16 components from 'Shuangdan' 
granule and 5 metabolites were simultaneously identified by comparing their mass 
spectra and retention behavior with reference compounds or literature data. The 
results proved that the established method could be used to identify the 
structure of active components responsible for the pharmacological effects of 
'Shuangdan' granule.

Spinach leaves harvested at three maturity stages from eight commercial 
cultivars (CC) and eight advanced breeding lines (ABL) were evaluated for oxygen 
radical absorbing capacity (ORAC), total phenolics, and flavonoid composition 
and content. ABL had higher levels of total phenolics, total flavonoids, and 
ORAC than CC. Midmaturity spinach leaves had higher levels of total phenolics, 
total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity than immature and mature leaves. The 
contents of individual flavonoids varied in response to maturation, with the 
predominant glucuronated flavones decreasing and patuletin and spinacetin 
derivatives increasing. Both total phenolics and total flavonoids correlated 
well with ORAC (r(xy)() = 0.78 and 0.81, respectively) demonstrating that 
flavonoids were major contributors to antioxidant capacity. Our results indicate 
that spinach genotypes should be harvested at the midmaturity stage for 
consumers to benefit from elevated levels of health promoting flavonoids present 
in the leaves. Additionally, plant breeders can select for increased phenolic 
content to increase antioxidant capacity of spinach genotypes.

The effects of genetic, pre-harvest (season of harvest, spear diameter, spear 
portion and spear tip color) and post-harvest factors (storage and domestic 
preparation practices, e.g., peeling and cooking) on total phenolic, flavonoid 
and ascorbic acid content of white asparagus spears and their correlation with 
antioxidant capacity (DPPH and FRAP) were studied. Results showed that genetic 
material was important for the total phenolic content but not season of harvest, 
spear diameter or storage. Violet spear tips and apical spear portions showed 
the largest amount of total phenolics. Peeling did not affect total phenolics in 
fresh asparagus, whereas it reduced their content in stored asparagus, while 
cooking resulted in an increase in both fresh and stored asparagus. However, the 
soluble extract of total phenolics and flavonoids were minor and the missing 
significance of phenolics and flavonoids in antioxidant capacity of white 
asparagus spears depends on these small amounts.

An HPLC method, using detection after postcolumn derivatization with 
p-dimethylaminocynnamaldehyde (DMACA), was developed for the quantitative 
analysis of individual flavanols in food. This method was applied to flavanol 
determination in 56 different kinds of Spanish food products, including fruit, 
vegetables, legumes, beverages (cider, coffee, beer, tea, and wine), and 
chocolate. The determined compounds corresponded to the catechins and 
proanthocyanidin dimers and trimers usually present in food and, therefore, they 
were representative of the flavanols of low degree of polymerization consumed 
with the diet. The data generated could be used for calculation of the dietary 
intake of either individual or total flavanols, which would allow the further 
establishment of epidemiological correlations with the incidence of chronic 
diseases. Similar flavanol profiles were found in the different samples of a 
similar type of product, even though important variations could exist in the 
concentrations of total and individual flavanols among them. This was attributed 
to factors such as sample origin, stage of ripeness, post-harvesting 
conservation, and processing. Total flavanol contents varied from nondetectable 
in most of the vegetables to 184 mg/100 g found in a sample of broad bean. 
Substantial amounts were also found in some fruits, such as plum and apple, as 
well as in tea and red wine. Epicatechin was the most abundant flavanol, 
followed by catechin and procyanidin B2. In general, catechins were found in all 
the flavanol-containing products, but the presence of gallocatechins was only 
relevant in pomegranate, broad bean, lentil, grape, wine, beer, and tea, and 
most of the berries. Galloyled flavanols were only detected in strawberry, 
medlar, grape, and tea.

Recent interest in the possible protective effects of dietary antioxidant 
compounds against human degenerative disease has prompted investigation of foods 
such as blueberries (Vaccinium sp.), which have a high antioxidant capacity. 
Fruit obtained from genotypes of highbush blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) 
and lowbush blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton) were analyzed for their 
antioxidant capacity, their content of anthocyanins, and total phenolic 
compounds, to evaluate the intraspecific and interspecific variation in these 
parameters. The method of extraction influenced the composition of fruit 
extracts; the highest anthocyanin and total phenolic contents and antioxidant 
capacity were found in extracts obtained using a solvent of acidified aqueous 
methanol. Regardless of the method, lowbush blueberries were consistently higher 
in anthocyanins, total phenolics, and antioxidant capacity, compared with 
highbush blueberries. There was no relationship between fruit size and 
anthocyanin content in either species.

Eight commercial Italian vini novelli (red wines prepared by carbonic maceration 
and supposed to be consumed within three months from their wine-making) were 
evaluated for their total antioxidant activity. The wines had an average total 
phenol content (1605.4 +/- 337.4 mg/L gallic acid equivalents) lower than that 
of wines prepared by traditional maceration and consumable after aging (2057. 3 
+/- 524.0 mg/L gallic acid equivalents). The average flavanol content (424.7 +/- 
121.3 mg/L catechin equivalents) and the total antioxidant activity (16.8 +/- 
3.8 mmol/L Trolox equivalents) of vini novelli were higher than the 
corresponding values (382.7 +/- 174.5 mg/L catechin equivalents and 12.3 +/- 3.3 
mmol/L Trolox equivalents) found for aged wines. Three couples of experimental 
wines were prepared from the same grapes by traditional or carbonic maceration. 
These wines showed a different phenolic pattern, anthocyanins being more 
abundant in vini novelli. However, the average total antioxidant activities of 
the wines were similar, suggesting that aging (and not the wine-making 
technique) is the main factor influencing the antioxidant activity of red wines.

The optimization and validation of a protocol for the quantification of six 
dietary lignans, i.e., secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, lariciresinol, 
pinoresinol, medioresinol, and syringaresinol, in food are presented. The method 
incorporates isotope dilution to ensure correct accuracy and precision, 
introducing the utilization of individual stable 13C3-labeled lignans. To 
demonstrate the potential of this new method, preliminary results of the levels 
of dietary lignans in selected foods are presented. It is concluded that the 
method fulfils the reliability criteria and can be applied to the analysis of 
the most common lignans in human food, being an essential asset to establish the 
intake of lignans in a determined population and their relation with disease 
prevention.

Lignans constitute a group of phytochemicals widely distributed in the human 
diet. Once ingested, most dietary lignans are metabolized by the gut microflora 
to enterolactone and enterodiol, also known as enterolignans. Together with 
isoflavones and coumestrol, enterolignans have been traditionally classified as 
phytoestrogens, plant-derived compounds that exhibit estrogen-like activity. In 
addition to a higher intake of vegetables, many studies have suggested that the 
presence of phytoestrogens in the Japanese diet is one of the factors that might 
explain the reduced incidence of certain chronic diseases in Japanese 
populations compared with Western countries. Being a vegetable-based diet, 
exposure to dietary lignans should be high, but to assess this exposure, a 
lignan food database is required. Stable isotope-dilution gas chromatography 
coupled with mass spectrometry was used to quantify six plant lignans in 86 food 
items commonly consumed in Japan. These data will complement the previous 
databases and most importantly expand the knowledge of occurrence of lignans in 
food to Eastern diets.

The influence of 2 weeks and 3 months of dark storage upon light-induced 
chlorogenic acid accumulation within tuber tissue of four potato cultivars and 
upon 5-, 4-, and 3-caffeoylquinic acid concentrations within cv. King Edward was 
determined. Storage period significantly affected (P < 0.05) the magnitude of 
the light-induced chlorogenic acid response with accumulation rates 3-4 times 
higher in tubers exposed to light after 2 weeks compared with those placed under 
light after 3 months. Comparison of chlorogenic acid concentrations in controls 
after 2 and 3 months of dark storage indicated that tuber chlorogenic 
concentrations decline during prolonged cold store at 5 degrees C. Rates of 
accumulation in response to light were cultivar-dependent with cv. Fianna the 
most light-sensitive and cv. Maris Piper relatively light-insensitive. In 
virtually all cases exposure to sodium and fluorescent light promoted higher 
rates of accumulation than did exposure to high-pressure mercury light sources. 
Chlorogenic acid values steadily increased over 15 days of illumination with, in 
the majority of cases, no indication of cessation. Light exposure increased 5-, 
4-, and 3-caffeoylquinic acid accumulation rates in cv. King Edward. 
Irrespective of storage period and light source, ratios of 
5-:4-:3-caffeoylquinic acid were ca. 85:15:0 at day 0 and 52:42:6 by day 15.

The phenolic compounds composition, antioxidant potential, and antimicrobial 
activity of different table olives from Portugal, namely, natural black olives 
""Galega"", black ripe olive ""Negrinha de Freixo"", Protected Designation of Origin 
(PDO) ""Azeitona de Conserva Negrinha de Freixo"" olives, and ""Azeitona de 
Conserva de Elvas e Campo Maior"" Designation of Origin (DO) olives, were 
investigated. The analysis of phenolic compounds was performed by reversed-phase 
HPLC/DAD, and seven compounds were identified and quantified: hydroxytyrosol, 
tyrosol, 5-O-caffeoilquinic acid, verbascoside, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, rutin, 
and luteolin. The antioxidant activity was assessed by the reducing power assay, 
the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals, and the 
beta-carotene linoleate model system. The antioxidant activity was correlated 
with the amount of phenolics found in each sample. The antimicrobial activity 
was screened using Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, 
Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, 
Cryptococcus neoformans). PDO and DO table olives revealed a wide range of 
antimicrobial activity. C. albicans was resistant to all the analyzed extracts.

Several recent articles have reported a significant antioxidant capacity of 
cereal products, determined in methanolic and ethanolic extracts. The aim of 
this work was to conduct an assessment of the antioxidant capacity of cereals 
using both chemical and in vitro digestive enzymatic extraction of antioxidants. 
Ferric reducing power (FRAP) and free radical scavenging capacity (DPPH) methods 
were used to determine the antioxidant capacity in wheat flour, bread, raw and 
boiled rice, wheat bran, and oat bran. The most efficient antioxidant extraction 
was achieved by using successively acidic methanol/water (50:50 v/v, pH 2) and 
acetone/water (70:30 v/v). The antioxidant capacity in these extracts ranged 
from 1.1 to 4.4 micromol Trolox/g dw. A significant amount of hydrolyzable 
phenolics with a high antioxidant capacity (from 5 to 108 micromol Trolox/g dw) 
was found in the residues of this aqueous-organic extraction. The antioxidant 
capacities of these nonextractable polyphenols are usually ignored in the 
literature, although they may have an antioxidant role in the gastrointestinal 
tract, especially after colonic fermentation, and may be fermentated to active 
metabolites. On the other hand, in vitro digestive enzymatic extracts obtained 
by enzymatic treatments that mimic conditions in the gastrointestinal tract 
showed that the amount of antioxidants released by the cereal matrix into the 
human intestine may be higher than the one that can be expected from 
measurements in the usual aqueous-organic extracts.

Ninety-four samples of Asturian natural cider were analyzed for titratable and 
volatile acidities, pH, alcoholic, total polyphenol, and acidic polysaccharide 
contents, nonvolatile acids, polyalcohols, residual sugars, and major volatile 
compounds. A partial least-squares regression analysis (PLR-1) was performed to 
correlate the chemical composition and the origin of the raw material, the cider 
samples being grouped into two categories: an ""odd"" class, cider made from 
foreign apples (1995 and 1997), and an ""even"" class, ciders made from Asturian 
apples (1996 and 1998). The mathematical model has a multiple linear correlation 
coefficient of 80%.

Prunes, which are industrially obtained by dehydrating fresh plums at 85-90 
degrees C for 18 h, contain higher levels of phenolic compounds than most other 
fruits. Prune phenolics have shown beneficial effects on human health. Reports 
are available in the literature on ascorbic acid, phenol composition, and 
antioxidant activity of fresh plums and prunes, but there is a lack of 
publications on the influence of drying parameters on the phenolic compounds and 
antioxidant activity. A study was carried out on two plum cultivars using two 
sets of air-drying temperatures: (i) air temperature at 85 degrees C until 50% 
of prune moisture level and then the temperature was lowered to 70 degrees C; 
(ii) air temperature at 60 degrees C. Whole fresh and dried fruits were assessed 
for phenolics (catechins, hydroxycinnamic acids, anthocyanins, and flavonols), 
ascorbic acid, and antioxidant activity (all parameters were calculated on a dry 
matter basis). Analysis of data shows that chlorogenic and neochlorogenic acid 
changes were affected by both process parameters and cultivar. Drying destroyed 
anthocyanins, and there was a significant decrease in flavonols. Ascorbic acid 
was drastically reduced in relation to process temperature. The most striking 
result was that drying at 85 degrees C doubled antioxidant activity in both 
cultivars, while contradictory results were found for 60 degrees C processed 
plums.

A simple isocratic HPLC technique has been developed for the quantitative 
analysis of phenolic acids (PAs) in fruits and vegetables. Nine benzoic and 
cinnamic acid derivatives were separated in less than 30 min, and the resolution 
was all more than 1.23. The ranges of linearity for PAs standards were 0.2-100 
ng, even up to 600 ng (r = 0.983-1.000) and the detection limits were 0.02-0.24 
mg/kg. Samples of fresh vegetables and fruits were extracted with 80% methanol 
and ethyl acetate, then purified with C18 Sep-Pak cartridge and determined by 
HPLC. This method was applied to the determination of PAs in 7 kinds of fruits 
and vegetables, i.e., apple, pear, Chinese cabbage, cauliflower, turnip, soybean 
sprout and white grape wine. The content of the 9 PAs varied widely in the 7 
kinds of foods studied. The average concentrations of chlorogenic acid in apple 
(100.2 mg/kg) and pear (30.8 mg/kg) were quite high, and sinapinic acid was 
remarkable (42.5 mg/kg) in Chinese cabbage, and protocatechuic acid had the 
highest concentration of all the PAs in white wine.

The antioxidant dihydrocaffeic acid is a dietary constituent and a microbial 
metabolite of flavonoids. Orally administered to rats, dihydrocaffeic acid was 
very rapidly absorbed most probably by the gastric or duodenal epithelium and 
excreted in urine as free and conjugated forms. LC-MS2 analysis of plasma and 
urine samples allowed confident identification of the dihydrocaffeic acid 
metabolites. The parent compound was glucuronidated, sulphated or methylated, on 
one of the hydroxyl groups present on its phenyl ring. All the dihydrocaffeic 
acid metabolites peaked in plasma within the first 30min following ingestion, 
suggesting a metabolism possibly by the gastric or duodenal cells and by the 
liver. Using in vitro and ex vivo models of the intestinal epithelium and the 
liver, the identity and source of the metabolites detected in vivo were 
examined. The data obtained suggest that, in rats, intestinal cells are more 
able to glucuronidate dihydrocaffeic acid, whereas liver favours sulphation. 
Moreover, glucuronidation, sulphation and methylation seem to be 
regio-selective, preferably on the 3-OH of dihydrocaffeic acid. The methyl 
conjugate, dihydroferulic acid, was shown to be oxidized into ferulic acid by 
intestinal and hepatic cells, which were also able to perform the reverse 
reaction, the reduction of ferulic acid into dihydroferulic acid. As a 
conclusion, the main form of dihydrocaffeic acid circulating in plasma after its 
ingestion is a mixture of different primary and secondary metabolites.

Puerarin (daidzein-8-C-glucoside) is the major bioactive isoflavone of kudzu 
root (the root of Pueraria lobata). Its metabolic fate, however, is not 
well-known. In this study, a sensitive and specific LC-ESI-MS/MS method for the 
determination of puerarin and its metabolites daidzein, dihydrodaidzein, and 
equol was developed for their analysis in biological samples. Two new 
metabolites of puerarin, mono- and dihydroxylated derivatives, were detected in 
the urine and feces of rats after oral administration. The persistence of 
puerarin in blood and urine as the principal metabolic form for the period of 
4-72 h after oral administration suggested that puerarin is rapidly absorbed 
from the intestine without metabolism. Its presence in organs such as the brain 
suggests that this glucoside may enter tissues by specific transport pathways. 
Study of these metabolites may provide further understanding of the health 
beneficial effects of puerarin in kudzu dietary supplements.

Proanthocyanidin rich plant extracts derived from grape seed extract (GSE), 
hawthorn and cranberry are on markets for their preventive effects against 
cardiovascular diseases and uroinfections in woman. However, the importance of 
these health beneficial effects of these botanicals remains elusive due to 
incomplete understanding of uptake, metabolism and bioavailability of 
proanthocyanidins in vivo. In the present study rats were given GSE orally (300 
mg/kg, twice a day) and blood and urine were collected over a 24 h period. 
Monomeric catechins and their methylated metabolites, and proanthocyanidins up 
to trimers were detected in blood samples treated with GSE using LC-MS/MS 
operating in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. A new tetramethylated 
metabolite of dimeric proanthocyanidin (m/z 633) in GSE-treated urine was 
tentatively identified. Using LC-MS/MS, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were 
identified in the brain conclusively. These data suggested that GSE catechins 
cross the blood brain barrier and may be responsible for the neuroprotective 
effects of GSE.

Dietary flavonoids can be converted into phenolic acids by colonic microflora. 
Phenolic acids can then be absorbed into the circulation and may contribute to 
the health-promoting effects of the parent compounds. Phenolic acids can be 
further metabolized in other tissues via methylation and conjugation with 
glucuronide or sulfate. The objectives of this study were to identify and 
quantify the urinary excretion of 19 phenolic acids and their conjugates in rats 
fed three levels of a concentrated cranberry powder (3.3, 6.6, and 33 mg/kg of 
diet). The basic diet used was AIN93G diet containing very low amounts of any 
polyphenolic compounds. Of the phenolic acids studied, the amounts excreted 
varied by 4 orders of magnitude, with hippuric acid being excreted in the 
highest quantities. Amounts of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4HPAA), 
3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (3HPAA), 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (3HPPA), and 
4-hydroxycinnamic acid (4HCA) excreted were in the range of 18-33 microg/mg 
creatinine in animals fed the highest level of cranberry powder, whereas 
phenylacetic acid (PAA), gallic acid (GA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid 
(34HPAA), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (34HBA), 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid (34HCA), 
and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid (FA) were excreted in the urine in 
concentrations of 0.1-2 microg/mg creatinine. As the amount of cranberry in the 
diet was increased, the amount of 4HPAA excreted decreased but the percentage of 
conjugated 4HPAA excreted increased (from 57 to 91%). For other phenolic acids 
analyzed, the percentage excreted in the conjugated form was approximately 
constant across levels of cranberry in the diet and ranged from 65 to 100% for 
the individual phenolic acids. Studies of bioactivity and health effects need to 
consider more than just the compound(s) in the food, because they can be 
metabolized to other lower molecular weight compounds, which in turn may also be 
methylated or conjugated in some form that may affect the perceived health 
effects.

Extracts of aromatic plants of Greek origin were examined as potential sources 
of phenolic compounds. RP-HPLC with UV detection was employed for the 
identification and quantification of the phenolic antioxidants, present in 
methanolic extracts. The most abundant phenolic acids were ferulic acid (1.1-280 
mg/100 g of dry sample) and caffeic acid (1.2-60 mg/100 g of dry sample). 
(+)-Catechin and quercetin were the most abundant flavonoids. Apigenin and 
luteolin were detected in high amounts in Menta pulegium and Thymus vulgaris, 
respectively. The antioxidant capacity was determined, in dried ground plants 
and in their methanol extracts, with the Rancimat test using sunflower oil as 
substrate. Both pulverized plants and extracts showed antioxidant capacity. 
Total phenolic content in the extracts was determined spectrometrically 
according to the Folin-Ciocalteu assay and ranged from 1 to 21 mg of gallic 
acid/100 g of dry sample. Antimicrobial activity of the extracts against 
selected microbes was also conducted in this study.

Nine non-noble-metal catalysts (NNMCs) from five different laboratories were 
investigated for the catalysis of O(2) electroreduction in an acidic medium. The 
catalyst precursors were synthesized by wet impregnation, planetary ball 
milling, a foaming-agent technique, or a templating method. All catalyst 
precursors were subjected to one or more heat treatments at 700-1050 degrees C 
in an inert or reactive atmosphere. These catalysts underwent an identical set 
of electrochemical characterizations, including rotating-disk-electrode and 
polymer-electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) tests and voltammetry under N(2). 
Ex situ characterization was comprised of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, 
neutron activation analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and N(2) adsorption 
and its analysis with an advanced model for carbonaceous powders. In PEMFC, 
several NNMCs display mass activities of 10-20 A g(-1) at 0.8 V versus a 
reversible hydrogen electrode, and one shows 80 A g(-1). The latter value 
corresponds to a volumetric activity of 19 A cm(-3) under reference conditions 
and represents one-seventh of the target defined by the U.S. Department of 
Energy for 2010 (130 A cm(-3)). The activity of all NNMCs is mainly governed by 
the microporous surface area, and active sites seem to be hosted in pore sizes 
of 5-15 A. The nitrogen and metal (iron or cobalt) seem to be present in 
sufficient amounts in the NNMCs and do not limit activity. The paper discusses 
probable directions for synthesizing more active NNMCs. This could be achieved 
through multiple pyrolysis steps, ball-milling steps, and control of the powder 
morphology by the addition of foaming agents and/or sulfur.

Virgin olive oils from percolation (first extraction) have been compared with 
the corresponding oils from centrifugation (second extraction). The former were 
characterized by (i) higher contents of total phenols, o-diphenols, 
hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol-aglycons, tocopherols, trans-2-hexenal, total volatiles, 
and waxes; (ii) higher values of resistance to autoxidation and of turbidity; 
(iii) higher sensory scores; (iv) higher ratios of campesterol/stigmasterol, 
trans-2-hexenal/hexanal, and trans-2-hexenal/total volatiles; (v) lower contents 
of chlorophylls, pheophytins, sterols, and aliphatic and triterpene alcohols; 
(vi) lower alcoholic index and color indices; (vii) similar values of acidity, 
peroxide index, and UV (ultraviolet) spectrophotometric indices; (viii) similar 
percentages of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, triglycerides, and 
diglycerides; and (ix) similar values of glyceridic indices. Stigmastadienes, 
trans-oleic, trans-linoleic, and trans-linolenic acid isomers were not detected 
in the two genuine oil kinds. Hence, the qualitative level of the first 
extraction oil was superior to the second extraction one.

Extraction, resolution, and determination of the trans-hydroxycinnamic acids 
(caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic) were performed in 82 orange juices 
derived from the most important blood and blond varieties grown in Italy. 
Soluble solids, acidity, and anthocyanins were also determined. Hydroxycinnamic 
acids were more abundant in blood orange than in blond juices. Ferulic acid was 
the major component in all cases, but the distribution of the four acids was 
typical in each variety. Discriminant analysis of the experimental results 
showed that these acids could be used as markers of blood and blond varieties. 
The statistical model was used to recognize some mixtures of blood and blond 
juices.

Several fresh orange juices, obtained from five different Citrus sinensis (L.) 
Osbeck varieties (three pigmented varieties, Moro, Sanguinello, and Tarocco, and 
two blond varieties, Valencia late and Washington navel), were subjected to 
antioxidant profile determination (including total polyphenols, flavanones, 
anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, and ascorbic acid). The antioxidant 
activity of these juices was then assessed by means of different ""in vitro"" 
tests (bleaching of the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical; 
peroxidation, induced by the water-soluble radical initiator 
2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride, on mixed 
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/linoleic acid unilamellar vesicles; scavenging 
activity against nitric oxide; total antioxidant status). All orange juices 
tested showed an evident antioxidant effect. Our findings indicate the 
following: (1) the antioxidant efficiency of orange juices may be attributed, in 
a significant part at least, to their content of total phenols, (2) while 
ascorbic acid seems to play a minor role; (3) the antioxidant activity of orange 
juices is related not only to structural features of phytochemicals contained in 
them, but also to their capability to interact with biomembranes; (4) finally, 
as to pigmented juices, their antioxidant efficiency appears to be widely 
influenced by the anthocyanin level. One could speculate that the supply of 
natural antioxidant phenols through daily consumption of orange juice might 
provide additional protection against in vivo oxidation of cellular 
biomolecules.

Quantitative analysis of anthocyanins was performed on a series of blood orange 
juices according to various spectrophotometric and HPLC methods, and the causes 
for different concentration resulting from the application of such procedures 
were investigated. Spectrophotometric methods utilizing aqueous ethanol as a 
solvent provided an anthocyanin content higher than that determined by HPLC. 
Discrepancies were ascribed to the use of impure standards and/or unsuitable 
calibration lines. The most consistent results with the HPLC findings were 
obtained by a method utilizing water as a solvent and cyanidin-3-glucoside as a 
standard. Actual concentration of anthocyanins in blood orange juice was 
remarkably lower than that currently determined by procedures used in the juice 
producing factories.

Although chronic exposure to secoisolariciresinol diglycoside (SDG) was shown to 
alter (3)H-SDG metabolite disposition in rats, the proportion of measured 
radioactivity attributed to known or unknown SDG metabolites was not determined. 
Using HPLC and GC-MS, two experiments were conducted to determine the effect of 
acute (1 d) vs. chronic (10 d) SDG treatment on major urinary metabolites of 
(3)H-SDG in female, Sprague-Dawley rats (70-72-d-old) over a 48-h period and if 
new urinary metabolites were detectable in rats fed nonradioactive flaxseed or 
SDG. A third experiment was conducted to determine changes in postprandial blood 
levels of (3)H-SDG metabolites over a 24-h period with acute or chronic SDG 
treatment. Regardless of treatment, enterodiol, enterolactone and 
secoisolariciresinol accounted for 75-80% of urine radioactivity. Four potential 
new lignan metabolites, two of which were detected in the urine of rats fed 
nonradioactive flaxseed or SDG, were found. Type of treatment had no effect on 
levels of individual urinary metabolites of (3)H-SDG. As observed for plasma 
lignans in women fed flaxseed, blood radioactivity peaked at 9 h and remained 
high until 24 h in both treatment groups, suggesting that blood lignan kinetics 
might be similar with flaxseed or SDG consumption and that they were comparable 
between humans and rats. In conclusion, the main urinary lignan metabolites were 
enterodiol, enterolactone and secoisolariciresinol. Urinary composition or blood 
levels of radioactive lignans were not affected by the duration of SDG exposure. 
Thus, while chronic SDG exposure alters lignan disposition in rats, it does not 
change the metabolite profile.

Vaccinium vitis-ideae var. vitis-ideae (lingonberry), and Vaccinium vitis-ideae 
var. minor (partridgeberry) at levels between 7 and 5884 ng/g dry sample. 
Lingonberry was found to have the highest content, 5884 ng/g dry sample, 
comparable to that found in grapes, 6471 ng/g dry sample. Pterostilbene was 
found in two cultivars of V. ashei and in V. stamineum at levels of 99-520 ng/g 
dry sample. Piceatannol was found in V. corymbosum and V. stamineum at levels of 
138-422 ng/g dry sample. These naturally occurring stilbenes, known to be strong 
antioxidants and to have cancer chemopreventive activities, will add to the 
purported health benefits derived from the consumption of these small fruits.

Tea is a complex mixture containing a range of compounds from simple phenolics 
to complex thearubigins, many of which have well-recognized antioxidant 
properties. This paper describes the application of high-performance liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS(n)) methods for the rapid and routine 
analysis of more than 30 phenolics in tea. Green and black tea infusions were 
injected directly onto a reversed phase HPLC column, and the phenolics eluted 
using two different mobile phase gradients, one optimized to resolve catechin 
derivatives and the other, flavonols and theaflavins. Compounds, identified on 
the basis of their retention time, absorbance spectrum, and MS fragmentation 
pattern, included (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, theaflavin and their various 
gallate derivatives, quercetin and kaempferol mono-, di-, and triglycosides, 
quinic acid esters of gallic acid and hydroxycinnamates, and the purine 
alkaloids, caffeine and theobromine.

BACKGROUND: Proanthocyanidins, the most abundant polyphenols in chocolate, are 
not depolymerized in the stomach and reach the small intestine intact, where 
they are hardly absorbed because of their high molecular weight. In vitro and in 
vivo studies using pure compounds as substrates suggest that proanthocyanidins 
and the related catechin monomers may be degraded into more bioavailable 
low-molecular-weight phenolic acids by the microflora in the colon.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the amounts of phenolic acids 
formed by the microflora and excreted in the urine of human subjects after 
consumption of polyphenol-rich chocolate.
DESIGN: After consumption of a polyphenol-free diet for 2 d and a subsequent 
overnight fast, 11 healthy subjects (7 men and 4 women) consumed 80 g chocolate 
containing 439 mg proanthocyanidins and 147 mg catechin monomers. All urine was 
collected during the 24 h before chocolate consumption and at 3, 6, 9, 24, and 
48 h after chocolate consumption. Aromatic acids were identified in urine by gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry and were quantified by HPLC-electrospray 
ionization tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Chocolate intake increased the urinary excretion of the 6 following 
phenolic acids: m-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, ferulic acid, 
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, m-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, vanillic acid, and 
m-hydroxybenzoic acid.
CONCLUSION: The antioxidant and biological effects of chocolate may be explained 
not solely by the established absorption of catechin monomers but also by the 
absorption of microbial phenolic acid metabolites.

Beers are a source of dietary flavonoids; however, there exist differences in 
composition, alcohol concentration, and beneficial activities. To characterize 
these differences, three kinds of lager beer of habitual consumption in Spain, 
dark, blond, and alcohol-free, were assayed for total phenolic content, 
antioxidant activity, superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities, and 
in vitro inhibitory effect on DNA oxidative damage. Furthermore, their 
melanoidin content and correlation with antioxidant activity were evaluated. 
Dark beer contained the highest total phenolic (489 +/- 52 mg/L) and melanoidin 
(1.49 +/- 0.02 g/L) contents with a 2-fold difference observed when compared to 
the alcohol-free beer. For the three kinds of beer, the antioxidant activity 
measured as N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride concentration was 
strongly correlated with the total polyphenol content (R(2) = 0.91102, p < 
0.005) and with the melanoidin content (R(2) = 0.7999, p < 0.05). The results 
support a positive effect of beers on the protection of DNA oxidative damage, by 
decreasing the deoxyribose degradation, DNA scission (measured by 
electrophoresis), and inhibition of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) formation. 
Furthermore, a correlation between the total melanoidin content (R(2) = 0.7309, 
p < 0.01) and inhibition of 8-OH-dG was observed.

A quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection 
method separating 16 phenolic acids was achieved. Six columns and several mobile 
phases were investigated. Resolution was achieved with a high-purity silica 
Phenomenex Luna C18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm) and a binary gradient 
consisting of CH3OH-water (with 0.1% formic acid) and flow rate set at 0.7 
ml/min. Acids were detected and quantitation performed at wavelength 
representing the lowest energy lambda(max) for individual acids. Extraction 
procedure from wine was optimized and yields ranged from 79 to 87% based on 
internal standard recovery. To confirm our quantitative results, identical 
samples were analyzed both in-house and by a collaborating laboratory. 
Correlation of two data sets generated linear regression equations that 
approached unity (0.93-0.98) and R2 values ranging from 0.990 to 0.999.

Propolis has been reported to display a broad spectrum of biological activities 
such as anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibiotic and antifungal 
properties, among others. There is great interest not only in the determination 
of the chemical composition of propolis but also in the understanding of the 
mechanisms related to its therapeutic actions. In this respect, the aim of the 
present investigation was to study the influence of both simultaneous (6, 12 and 
24 mg/kg b. w.) and subacute (12 mg/kg b. w.) treatment with a crude 
hydroalcoholic extract of propolis on the frequency of chromosome aberrations 
induced by the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DXR) in Wistar rat bone 
marrow cells. HPLC analysis of the crude extract allowed the quantification of 
the phenolic compounds: caffeic acid, P-coumaric acid, aromadendrin 4'-methyl 
ether, 3-prenyl- P-coumaric acid (drupanin), isosakuranetin, kaempferide, 
3,5-diprenyl- P-coumaric acid (artepellin C), baccharin and 
2,2-dimethyl-6-carboxyethenyl-2 H-1-benzopyran. A total of 100 metaphase 
cells/animal were analyzed for chromosome aberration frequency and 1000 
cells/animal were counted to obtain the mitotic index. The results showed that 
the dose of 12 mg propolis/kg b. w., administered either as a single dose or as 
subacute treatment, caused a statistically significant decrease in the frequency 
of chromosome damage induced by DXR compared to the group treated only with DXR. 
This reduction might be, in part, due to the presence of phenolic compounds in 
the studied propolis, which are able to capture free radicals produced by 
chemotherapeutic agents such as DXR.

The flavonoid composition of immature leaves of pak choi [Brassica rapa L. ssp. 
chinensis L. (Hanelt.)] was investigated. Flavonol aglycone content was measured 
in 11 pak choi varieties, indicating significant differences (P < 0.05) in 
content between varieties and relatively high contents of kaempferol and 
isorhamnetin. Levels of quercetin ranged from 3.2 to 6.1 mg/100 g of dry weight 
(DW), whereas levels of isorhamnetin and kaempferol were significantly higher 
(8.1-35.1 and 36.0-102.6 mg/100 g of DW, respectively). A large number of 
glycoside and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives of quercetin, kaempferol, and 
isorhamnetin were identified in cv. 'Shanghai' by LC/UV-DAD/ESI-MS/MS. The 
UV-DAD data allowed identification of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, but 
detailed MS/MS fragmentations were required for the structure elucidation. Pak 
choi could be a potentially important source of dietary flavonols, in 
particular, kaempferol and isorhamnetin.

Three different methods (antiradical activity, inhibition of primary oxidation, 
and ferric reducing power) have been used to evaluate the antioxidant activity 
of eight different asparagus cultivars and byproducts: white and green asparagus 
from Alcalá del Río (Guadalquivir Valley, Seville) and American hybrids, native 
spears, and their byproducts from Huétor-Tájar (Vega de Granada). The 
correlation between antioxidant activity and total phenol content was studied. 
Six standards were also tested to validate the modified methods for antioxidant 
activity determination. Results obtained for antiradical capacity and reducing 
power were very similar, and a high correlation with phenols was found (R > or = 
0.9 for both tests). Sample origin was an important factor, spears from 
Huétor-Tájar having higher values (ARC between 7 and 10 and P(R) of 0.25-0.33) 
than those from Alcalá del Río (ARC 0.6-2 and P(R) of 0.05-0.07). Significant 
differences were found between spears with the same origin, suggesting that 
genetics are another factor to take into account. Asparagus inhibits lipid 
primary oxidation, but no correlation between the inhibition percentage and 
phenols was observed. Asparagus origin was the only factor that led to 
significant differences: samples from Huétor-Tájar had higher values (POIC 
between 18 and 32) than those from Alcalá del Río (POIC of 5-9). Byproducts from 
the canning industry at Huétor-Tájar were also assayed for antioxidant activity; 
the results obtained suggested that byproducts could be considered as an 
excellent source of natural antioxidants.

The red table grape varieties Flame, Red Globe, Crimson, and Napoleon, as well 
as the white varieties Superior, Dominga, and Moscatel Italica, were irradiated 
with a previously optimized UV-C postharvest irradiation protocol (510 W, 40 cm, 
60 s). The induction kinetics of the stilbenes trans-resveratrol, trans-piceid, 
trans-piceatannol, trans-astringin, and viniferins was followed by using 
HPLC-DAD/MS/MS. The most inducible stilbenes were trans-resveratrol, 
trans-piceatannol, and viniferins. Both quantitative and qualitative differences 
were observed in both the stilbene induction kinetics and stilbene content in 
the seven table grapes analyzed here. The total resveratrol content ranged from 
0.69 mg/100 g fw (Dominga) to 2.3 mg/100 g fw (Red Globe). The net resveratrol 
induction ranged from 3.4-fold (Flame) to 2315-fold (Red Globe). The highest 
viniferins content was observed in the variety Flame (0.73 mg/100 g fw), 
although the variety Red Globe presented the highest viniferins induction 
(175-fold). The highest content and induction of piceatannol (0.17 mg/100 g fw 
and 173-fold, respectively) was observed in the variety Flame. It should be 
stressed that taking into account the health-beneficial effects claimed for 
stilbenes, the UV-C irradiated table grapes can be considered as new functional 
fruits that can supply (a serving of unpeeled 200 g table grapes) the 
resveratrol content (depending on the variety) equivalent to more than seven 
glasses of red wine ( approximately 1.5 L) with high resveratrol content.

In this study polyphenolic compounds extracted from olive fruits of five 
registered cultivars were analyzed. A solid-liquid extraction (LSE) procedure 
with Extrelut cartridge (diatomaceous earth) using different eluents was 
developed to obtain polyphenolic compounds. HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS methods were 
applied for the quali-quantitative analysis of each fraction obtained from LSE. 
The results of this work show that the LSE procedure with diatomaceous earth 
cartridge supplies a rapid and reproducible fractioning method able to obtain a 
quantitative recovery of all compounds and to collect fractions directly 
analyzed by HPLC. A comparison among different cultivars shows significant 
quantitative differences in some polyphenols, such as verbascoside, anthocyanic 
compounds, and oleuropein derivatives.

The flavonoid composition of three phenotypes of ""Zolfino"" landraces, a typical 
bean grown in Tuscany, has been elucidated by means of HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS 
analysis. Flavonols, isoflavones, and anthocyanins have been separated and 
determined in the different samples chosen on the basis of their seed coat 
color. A flavonol that has not been previously found in Phaseolus vulgaris L. 
seeds has been characterized. The quantitative data show the presence of 
flavonols (ranging from 709 to 118 mg/kg of fresh weight), isoflavones (ranging 
from 14 to 2 mg/kg of fresh weight), and anthocyanins, in black beans only. 
These results show that this genotype could be very interesting from a 
nutritional point of view.

There is increasing interest in olive polyphenols because of their biological 
properties as well as their contribution to the color, taste, and shelf life of 
olive products. However, some of these compounds remain unidentified. It has 
been shown that hydroxytyrosol 4-beta-D-glucoside 
(4-beta-D-glucosyl-3-hydroxyphenylethanol) coeluted with hydroxytyrosol 
[(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol] under reversed phase conditions in the phenolic 
chromatograms of olive pulp, vegetation water, and pomace of olive oil 
processing. A method to separate this compound from hydroxytyrosol by HPLC has 
been developed. The concentration of this glucoside increased in olive pulp with 
maturation and could be the main phenolic compound in mature olives. In 
contrast, the presence of this compound was not detected in olive oil by using 
HPLC-MS. The compound must be considered both in table olives and olive oil 
processing because of its glucose and hydroxytyrosol contribution to these 
products.

The levels of trans-piceid, cis-piceid, trans-resveratrol, and cis-resveratrol 
have been measured in 36 grape juices using an HPLC system with spectral 
analysis of eluting peaks. The piceid (glucosides) were the major component in 
the grape juices. In red grape juices the average concentrations were 3.38 mg/L 
for trans-piceid, 0.79 mg/L for cis-piceid, 0.50 mg/L for trans-resveratrol, and 
0.06 mg/L for cis-resveratrol. In white grape juices the levels were, on 
average, 0.18 mg/L for trans-piceid, 0.26 mg/L for cis-piceid, and 0.05 mg/L for 
trans-resveratrol, and cis-resveratrol was not detected in any sample. Levels of 
total resveratrol (trans- and cis-resveratrol and -piceid) found in red and in 
white grape juices are similar to those described in Spanish red and white 
wines. Due to their resveratrol content, as well as other phenolics, grape 
juices may have a beneficial health effect of interest to those who cannot drink 
wine.

Yoghurt impacts on the excretion of phenolic acids derived from colonic 
breakdown of orange juice flavanones in humans.

Human urine was collected over a 24 h period after the consumption of 250 mL of 
(i) water, (ii) orange juice, and (iii) orange juice plus 150 mL of full fat 
natural yoghurt. The orange juice contained 168 micromol of 
hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside and 18 micromol of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside. GC-MS 
analysis of the urine identified nine phenolic acids, five of which, 
3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylhydracrylic acid, dihydroferulic 
acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylhydracrylic acid and 3-hydroxyhippuric acid, were 
associated with orange juice consumption indicating that they were derived from 
colonic catabolism of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside. The overall 0-24 h excretion of 
the five phenolic acids was 6.7 +/- 1.8 micromol after drinking water and this 
increased significantly (p < 0.05) to 62 +/- 18 micromol, equivalent to 37% of 
the ingested flavanones, following orange juice consumption. When the orange 
juice was ingested with yoghurt excretion fell back markedly to 9.3 +/- 4.4 
micromol. This was not due to a difference in mouth to caecum transit time, as 
measured with breath hydrogen production, though possibly there may have been a 
slowing of the bulk of the meal reaching the large intestine which may then have 
altered the catabolism of the flavanones to phenolic acids by the colonic 
microbiota.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate green tea flavan-3-ol 
catabolism and plasma pharmacokinetic and urinary excretion by high-performance 
liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry to evaluate their absolute 
bioavailability by taking into account all known and some unknown catabolites 
deriving from their interaction with the gastrointestinal tract and its host 
microflora.
METHODS: A feeding study was carried out in 20 healthy human volunteers who 
ingested 400 mL of a ready-to-drink green tea containing approximately 400 μmol 
of flavan-3-ols. Urine and plasma were collected for 4 and 24h, respectively, 
and 39 relevant catabolites were identified in these biological fluids by tandem 
mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: In biological fluids, 39 relevant flavan-3-ol catabolites were 
identified. In plasma, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate was the only unmetabolized 
compound and the highest in absolute concentration compared with 
(-)-epigallocatechin and (-)-epicatechin conjugates. Colonic microflora-derived 
polyhydroxyphenyl-γ-valerolactones were by far the main urinary catabolites, 
averaging 10 times greater concentratin than flavan-3-ol conjugates. The 
calculated bioavailability was equal to 39% and it is interesting to notice the 
great variability in urinary excretion of colonic metabolites among 
participants, probably related to differences in their own colonic microflora.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that green tea catechins are more 
bioavailable than previously observed when colonic ring fission metabolites are 
taken into consideration. Regular consumption of ready-to-drink green tea 
containing flavan-3-ols allows a non-marginal exposure of the human body to 
these catabolites, somehow justifying the numerous beneficial actions described 
as linked to green tea intake.

Nine commercial brands of grapefruit juice were analyzed for their flavonoid 
content by HPLC to determine if significant brand-to-brand variance in 
grapefruit juice flavonoid content exists. Flavonoid glycosides narirutin, 
naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, didymin, and poncirin have been identified 
in all the grapefruit juices examined. The aglycone quercetin was detected in 
only two brands. All the juices were free from methoxylated flavonoid aglycones. 
There was a significant difference in the amounts of total flavonoids and 
individual flavonoids in the nine brands. The concentration of total flavonoids 
ranged between 19.44 and 84.28 mg/100 ml juice. Naringin was found to be the 
major flavonoid followed by narirutin and hesperidin. Their concentrations 
ranged from 14.56 to 63.8; 2.25 to 12.20; and 0.24 to 3.12 mg/100 ml juice, 
respectively.

A fast method using high-performance liquid chromatography based on two 
monolithic columns has been developed for the simultaneous determination of 
isoflavones extracted from soybeans and derived foods. The 12 main isoflavones 
were resolved in 10 min in two coupled monolithic columns working at 35 degrees 
C using a elution gradient of acidified water (0.1% acetic acid) and methanol 
(0.1% acetic acid) at a flow rate of 5 mL min(-1). Retention time and relative 
area standard deviations were below 1% for all isoflavones. The method developed 
was successfully applied to several soy food samples and spiked samples. Total 
isoflavone concentration in sampled soy foods ranged from 34.28 mg L(-1) to 4.29 
mg g(-1).

Quantitation of polymethoxylated flavones in orange juice by high-performance 
liquid chromatography.

Rouseff RL, Ting SV.

A quantitative high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedure for the 
determination of the five major polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) in orange juice 
has been developed. It employs a unique ternary solvent system with coupled 
UV-fluorescence detection. The dual detectors were employed to determine the 
presence of interfering substances and served as a cross check on quantitation. 
Stop flow UV and fluorescence scanning was used to identify peaks and determine 
the presence of impurities. Although all five citrus PMFs fluoresce, some HPLC 
fluorescence peaks were too small to be of much practical use. All five citrus 
PMFs could be quantitated satisfactorily with the fixed wavelength UV (313 nm) 
detector. The HPLC procedure has been used to evaluate each step in the 
preparation. The optimum extracting solvent was selected and one time consuming 
step was eliminated, as it was found to be unnecessary. HPLC values for 
nobiletin and sinensetin are in good agreement with the thin-layer 
chromatographic (TLC) values in the literature. HPLC values for the other three 
flavones were considerably lower than those reported in the literature. The HPLC 
procedure is considerably faster than the TLC procedure with equal or superior 
precision and accuracy.

Interindividual variation in metabolism of soy isoflavones and lignans: 
influence of habitual diet on equol production by the gut microflora.

The soy isoflavones, daidzein and genistein, and the lignans, matairesinol and 
secoisolariciresinol, are phytoestrogens metabolized extensively by the 
intestinal microflora. Considerable important evidence is already available that 
shows extensive interindividual variation in isoflavone metabolism, and we have 
investigated the extent of this variation in a crossover study of a 
soy-containing food low or high in isoflavones (each treatment period lasted for 
17 days, and the 2 treatment periods were separated by a 25-day washout period) 
in 24 healthy subjects [19 women and 5 men, mean age 30 yr, range 19-40, mean 
body mass index 22.5 +/- 3.5 (SD) kg/m2]. There was a 16-fold variation in total 
isoflavonoid excretion in urine after the high-isoflavone treatment period. The 
variation in urinary equol excretion was greatest (664-fold), and subjects fell 
into two groups: poor equol excretors and good equol excretors (36%). A 
significant negative correlation was found between the proportion of energy from 
fat in the habitual diet and urinary equol excretion (r = -0.55; p = 0.012). 
Good equol excretors consumed less fat as percentage of energy than poor 
excretors (26 +/- 2.3% compared with 35 +/- 1.6%, p < 0.01) and more 
carbohydrate as percentage of energy than poor excretors (55 +/- 2.9% compared 
with 47 +/- 1.7%, p < 0.05). Interindividual variation in the urinary excretion 
of O-desmethyl-angolensin (O-DMA) was also apparent (76-fold after the 
high-isoflavone treatment period), but there was no relationship between equol 
excretion and O-DMA excretion. Enterolactone was the major lignan metabolite in 
urine and plasma but showed less interindividual variation than equol and O-DMA. 
It is suggested that the dietary fat intake decreases the capacity of gut 
microbial flora to synthesize equol.

BACKGROUND: There are conflicting results in the literature on the 
bioavailability of isoflavones in the aglycone and the glucoside forms.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of the soy 
isoflavone daidzein (DAI) on oral administration of both the aglycone and 
glucoside form in a human intervention study. In addition, the pharmacokinetics 
of the bacterial and oxidative metabolites of DAI was assessed.
DESIGN: Seven German men aged 22-30 y participated in a randomized, double-blind 
study in a crossover design. After ingestion of pure DAI or pure 
daidzein-7-O-beta-d-glucoside (DG) (1 mg DAI aglycone equivalent/kg body 
weight), blood samples were drawn before isoflavone administration and 1, 2, 3, 
4.5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 48 h after the dose. Urine was collected before and 
0-6, 6-12, and 12-24 h after the intake of the isoflavones. The concentrations 
of DAI and its major bacterial and oxidative metabolites in plasma and urine 
were measured with isotope dilution capillary gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry.
RESULTS: The systemic bioavailability (area under the curve; AUC(inf)), the 
maximal plasma concentration (C(max)), and the cumulative recovery of DAI in 
urine after administration of DG were 3-6 times greater than after the ingestion 
of DAI. Except for equol, which was formed by only one volunteer, all other 
quantified metabolites exhibited 2-12 times greater AUC(inf), C(max), and 
urinary recoveries after consumption of DG.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that DG exhibits a greater bioavailability than its 
aglycone when ingested in an isolated form.

This investigation was designed to characterize phenolic metabolism of the olive 
cultivar, Hardy's Mammoth, by examining its constitutive tissues. The phenolic 
profiles of pulp, seed, stone, and new and old season leaves were monitored over 
two fruiting seasons, to investigate possible relationships between tissues and 
phenol content and to determine the impact of alternate fruit bearing. No major 
qualitative differences in phenolic composition were found between the various 
tissues; however, distinct differences between the tissues with respect to 
quantifiable phenols were established. Relationships between 
2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl (3E,4E)-4-formyl-3-(2-oxoethyl)hex-4-enoate ester, 
oleuropein, and hydroxytyrosol in pulp and leaf were identified and found to be 
related to alternate bearing. Concentrations of 5-caffeoylquinic acid in old 
season leaves differed dramatically between seasons, confirming earlier studies.

The quantity of mammalian lignans enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) and 
of plant lignans secoisolariciresinol (SECO) and 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR) 
excreted in a 24-h rat urine sample was measured after a single p.o. dose of an 
equivalent quantity of secoisolariciresinol diglycoside (SDG), 
secoisolariciresinol (SECO), matairesinol (MR), 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR) and 
ENL. Plant lignans (SECO and HMR) were partially absorbed as such. The aglycone 
form of SECO was more efficiently converted into mammalian lignans END and ENL 
than the glycosylated form, SDG. Of plant lignans, MR produced the highest 
quantities of ENL: the quantity was over twofold compared with HMR or SDG. The 
majority of the animals, which had been given SECO, excreted higher quantities 
of END than ENL into urine, but ENL was the main lignan metabolite after SDG. 
The highest quantities of ENL in urine were measured after the administration of 
ENL as such. The (-)SECO isolated from Araucaria angustifolia was converted into 
(-)ENL only. The administration of (-)SDG, which was shown to produce (+)SECO, 
resulted in excretion of (+)ENL only and (-)HMR was converted into (-)ENL only. 
This confirmed that the absolute configurations at C8 and C8' are not changed 
during the microbial metabolism. Whether the biological effects are 
enantiomer-specific, remains to be resolved.

The colour and the antioxidant content of five different cultivars of tomatoes 
(Lycopersicon esculentum L.), grown in glasshouses using commercial hydroponic 
techniques, were measured in freshly harvested tomatoes and after 2 and 5 days 
of storage in the dark at 15 degrees C. The two cocktail cultivars of tomatoes, 
Aranca and Flavourine, were the smallest tomatoes but they contained higher dry 
matter contents compared with the three standard salad cultivars, Excell, Celero 
and Dutch Chaser. There were significant differences (P < 0.001) in lycopene 
(the major carotenoid), ascorbic acid and total antioxidant activity in the 
whole fruit of the five different cultivars evaluated at harvest, while the 
total phenolic contents were very similar. The lycopene levels of all the 
cultivars increased significantly (P < 0.001) after storage for 2 and 5 days at 
15 degrees C. Overall, the total phenolic content of all the cultivars did not 
change appreciably after storage at 15 degrees C while the levels of ascorbic 
acid fell by 12.6% when stored for 5 days in the dark. There was a significant 
difference (P < 0.001) in the total antioxidant activity between the five 
different cultivars when freshly harvested; the highest levels of total 
antioxidant activity were observed in the two cocktail cultivars, Aranca and 
Flavourine. Antioxidant activity showed different patterns of change depending 
on cultivar. An increase in the total antioxidant values could be seen in 
cultivars Dutch chaser and Excell, after storage for 5 days at 15 degrees C. The 
total antioxidant activity values of Flavourine and Celero fell on storage while 
the values for stored Aranca were very similar to the values when freshly 
harvested. The skin colour, as shown by Commission Internationale l'Eclairage 
(CIE) L*a*b* values of each cultivar were markedly different at harvest even 
though each cultivar was harvested at the same maturity. The a* value of each 
cultivar increased significantly (P < 0.001) when they were stored in the dark, 
for either 2 or 5 days, at 15 degrees C. Regression analysis showed that overall 
there was no significant relationship (R(2) = 0.14) between the lycopene content 
and the a* value of all the tomatoes; however, when examined individually, the 
two cocktail tomatoes Aranca and Flavourine showed strong correlation-R(2) = 
0.96 and R(2) = 0.97, respectively. Overall, the (a*/b*)(2) was the most 
reliable indicator of lycopene concentration (R(2) = 0.96) in the tomatoes 
examined in this study.

Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a naturally occurring 
polyphenol with cancer chemopreventive properties in preclinical models of 
carcinogenesis, including those of colorectal cancer. Recently, a variety of 
analogues of resveratrol have been synthesised and investigated in in vitro 
assays. One analogue, 3,4,5,4'-tetramethoxystilbene (DMU 212), showed 
preferential growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic properties in transformed cells, 
when compared with their untransformed counterparts. As part of a 
chemoprevention drug development programme, the pharmacokinetic properties of 
DMU 212 were compared with those of resveratrol in the plasma, liver, kidney, 
lung, heart, brain and small intestinal and colonic mucosa of mice. DMU 212 or 
resveratrol (240 mg kg(-1)) were administered intragastrically, and drug 
concentrations were measured by HPLC. Metabolites were characterised by 
cochromatography with authentic reference compounds and were identified by mass 
spectrometry. The ratios of area of plasma or tissue concentration vs time 
curves of resveratrol over DMU 212 (AUC(res)/AUC(DMU212)) for the plasma, liver, 
small intestinal and colonic mucosa were 3.5, 5, 0.1 and 0.15, respectively. 
Thus, resveratrol afforded significantly higher levels than DMU 212 in the 
plasma and liver, while DMU 212 exhibited superior availability compared to 
resveratrol in the small intestine and colon. Resveratrol was metabolised to its 
sulphate or glucuronate conjugates, while DMU 212 underwent metabolic 
hydroxylation or single and double O-demethylation. DMU 212 and resveratrol 
inhibited the growth of human-derived colon cancer cells HCA-7 and HT-29 in 
vitro with IC(50) values of between 6 and 26 microM. In the light of the 
superior levels achieved in the gastrointestinal tract after the administration 
of DMU 212, when compared to resveratrol, the results provide a good rationale 
to evaluate DMU 212 as a colorectal cancer chemopreventive agent.

Resveratrol has been associated with reduced cardiovascular disease and reduced 
cancer risk. This phytoalexin has been reported in a number of plant species, 
including grapes, and may be one of the compounds responsible for the health 
benefits of red wine. Analytical methods for measuring resveratrol in wine and 
peanuts were adapted to isolate, identify, and quantify resveratrol in several 
cultivars of peanuts. Aqueous ethanol (80% v/v) extracts from peanuts without 
seed coats were purified over alumina/silica gel columns and analyzed by 
reversed phase HPLC using a C-18 column. Peanuts from each market type, 
Virginia, runner, and Spanish, produced in four different locations contained 
from 0.03 to 0.14 microg of resveratrol/g. Seed coats from runner and Virginia 
types contained approximately 0.65 microg/g of seed coat, which is equivalent to 
<0.04 microg/seed. Quantitative analysis of 15 cultivars representing 3 peanut 
market types, which had been cold stored for up to 3 years, indicated a range of 
0.02-1.79 microg/g of peanut compared to 0.6-8.0 microg/mL in red wines.

Tea is rich in polyphenols and has a variety of biological activities. In order 
to better understand the biological effects of tea constituents on human health, 
markers for their exposure and their metabolic fates are needed. Previously, we 
have characterized several catechin metabolites in the blood and urine, but more 
information on the metabolite profile of tea polyphenols is needed. In the 
present study, the human urinary metabolite profile of tea polyphenols was 
investigated using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass 
spectrometry with data-dependent acquisition. With data-dependent MS/MS analysis 
by collecting the MS2 and MS3 spectra of the most intense ions in the sample, we 
identified more than twenty metabolites of tea polyphenols from human urine 
samples. (-)-Epigallocatechin (EGC) glucuronide, methylated EGC glucuronide, 
methylated EGC sulfate, (-)-epicatechin (EC) glucruronide, EC sulfate, 
methylated EC sulfate, as well as the glucuronide and sulfate metabolites of the 
ring-fission metabolites of tea catechins, 
5-(3',4',5'-trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4), 
5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6) and 
5-(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6'), were the major human 
urinary metabolites of tea polyphenols. To our knowledge, this is the first 
report of the direct simultaneous analysis of the human urinary metabolite 
profile of tea polyphenols using single sample analysis. This method can also be 
used for thorough investigations of the metabolite profiles of many other 
dietary constituents.

(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant and most biologically 
active polyphenolic compound in tea, has been proposed to have many health 
beneficial effects. The metabolic fate of EGCG, however, is not well understood. 
In the present study, we identified a novel EGCG metabolite, 
7-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-EGCG-4''-O-beta-D-glucupyranoside, in a mouse urine 
sample using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass 
spectrometry. The structure of this metabolite was confirmed by analyzing the 
MSn (n = 1-4) spectra as well as comparing the MS/MS spectra of its product ions 
with those from EGCG and EGCG-4''-O-beta-D-glucupyranoside standards. To our 
knowledge, this is the first report of the identification of a glucoside 
metabolite of EGCG in mammals. Our results indicate that glucosidation 
represents a novel pathway in the metabolism of EGCG in mice.

The cortex of 14 French apple varieties (12 cider and 2 juice varieties), one 
English cider variety, and one dessert apple (i.e., Golden Delicious) were 
studied for their polyphenol composition. Total polyphenols were assayed by the 
Folin-Ciocalteu method, and the precise polyphenolic composition (monomeric 
catechins, proanthocyanidins, hydroxycinnamic acids, and dihydrochalcones) was 
obtained by HPLC following thiolysis. ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS analyses showed that 
chlorogenic acid and p-coumaroylquinic acid were methylated under the conditions 
of thiolysis. Depending on the variety, the global polyphenol concentration 
varied from 1 to 7 g per kilogram of fresh cortex. Cider varieties globally 
showed a higher polyphenol concentration than the dessert apple Golden 
Delicious, bitter varieties being the more concentrated. The proportion of the 
polyphenol classes varied greatly from one cultivar to another. For all 
varieties, procyanidins were always the predominant class. They were mainly 
constituted of (-)-epicatechin units with a small proportion of (+)-catechin as 
a terminal unit. The average degree of polymerization ranged between 4.2 and 7.5 
depending upon the variety with an exception for the sharp varieties Guillevic 
and Avrolles which showed significant concentrations of procyanidins with DPn of 
40 and 50, respectively.

Carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) is largely used as solvent in chemical industries. 
Carbon tetrachloride is also well known for hepatic and renal toxic actions. The 
in vivo metabolism of carbon tetrachloride to trichloromethyl (CCl(3)) and 
peroxy trichloromethyl (OOCCl(3)) radicals has been extensively reported to 
cause acute liver damage like cirrhosis, steatosis and necrosis. We have 
evaluated protective action of purified cyanobacterial phycoerythrin (C-PE) on 
carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic and renal toxicity in male rats. Rats were 
orally treated with 25 and 50mg/kg BW of C-PE along with CCl(4) (50% CCl(4), 0.5 
ml/kg BW, intraperitoneally) for 28 consecutive days. Results demonstrated that 
C-PE dose-responsively ameliorates CCl(4)-toxicity by significantly decreasing 
(P<0.05) organs weight, aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, lipid 
profile, creatinine, uric acid and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations with 
rise in body weight, food intake, hemoglobin, protein, bilirubin and FRAP 
values. Neither C-PE nor CCl(4) influenced on serum minerals. Hepatic and renal 
tissues showed significant decline (P<0.05) in malondialdehyde, lipid 
hydroperoxides and conjugated dienes with rise in SOD, catalase, GPx, GSH, 
vitamin-E and vitamin-C levels. Presently observed pharmacological effect on 
CCl(4) toxicity were from tetrapyrrole molecule and to some extent bilirubin 
biotransformations, as well as metabolic (dietary protein) actions of C-PE.

The presence of resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) and its beta-glucoside, 
piceid (resveratrol-3-beta-D-glucopyranoside), together with their isomers in 
wine appears to be one of the beneficial factors conferring a protective effect 
against cardiovascular disease through red wine ingestion. A total of 42 red and 
white wines was collected in areas from Hokkaido to Kyushu in Japan. The wines 
were fractionated with a C18 Sep-pak cartridge, and the active principles were 
eluted with ethyl acetate. Crude trans- and cis-piceid were extracted from a 
Chinese medicine, 'Kojohkon' (Polygonum cuspidatum), and their retention times 
and UV absorption were confirmed by HPLC. trans- and cis-Resveratrol, and trans- 
and cis-piceid were analyzed in a short C18 HPLC column, and cis-resveratrol was 
quantified from the amount of cis-isomer converted from authentic 
trans-resveratrol that had been treated by UV irradiation. The content of piceid 
is shown as the resveratrol equivalent. The average content of total stilbene 
compounds was 4.37 mg/liter in red wines, while only 0.68 mg/liter in white 
wines. Red wines made from Pinot noir, Merlot, and Zweigeltrebe grapes all had a 
high resveratrol content.

Vitisin A was prepared from malvidin 3-glucoside and pyruvic acid in model wine 
medium, isolated by countercurrent chromatography, and purified by preparative 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The synthesized compound was used 
as a reference standard to quantify vitisin A in Chilean wines from Vitis 
vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, including a vertical row of wines from the same 
vineyard over 16 years. Maximum vitisin A content was reached within the first 
year of storage. Importantly, up to half of the initial amount of vitisin A in 
young wines was still present in 15 year old wines. Although vitisin A was found 
to be much more stable as compared to other monomeric C-4 underivatized 
anthocyanins, it also slowly degrades after reaching its peak concentration. The 
""color activity concept"" was applied to vitisin A, malvidin 3-glucoside, 
malvidin 3-(6' '-acetylglucoside), and polymeric pigments isolated by 
countercurrent chromatography in order to estimate their contribution toward the 
overall color expression of wines. It was found that vitisin A is only a minor 
contributor to the visually perceived color of aged red wines (color 
contribution approximately 5%). The major contributor is the polymeric fraction 
(color contribution approximately 70-90%).

Pinotage red wines were found to contain a reaction product of malvidin 
3-glucoside and caffeic acid, the so-called pinotin A. A total of 50 Pinotage 
wines from the vintages 1996-2002 were analyzed for the content of pinotin A, 
malvidin 3-glucoside, caffeic acid, and caftaric acid. Statistical analyses were 
performed to reveal variations in the content of these compounds and to 
determine the factors that influence pinotin A formation during wine aging. An 
exponential increase of the concentration of this aging product was observed 
with prolonged storage time. The most rapid synthesis of pinotin A was observed 
in 2.5-4 year old wines, although at this age malvidin 3-glucoside is already 
degraded to a large extent. This phenomenon is explained by the increased ratio 
of caffeic acid/malvidin 3-glucoside, which strongly favors the formation of 
pinotin A and makes side reactions less likely. Pinotin A formation proceeds as 
long as a certain level of malvidin 3-glucoside is maintained in the wines. In 
wines >5-6 years old degradation or polymerization of pinotin A finally exceeds 
the rate of its de novo synthesis.

Pistachio shells split naturally prior to maturity leading to their unique 
crack-shell form. Within 24 h of harvest, hull-trapped moisture may cause shell 
staining. The illegal process of bleaching has been used to restore a desirable 
white color to pistachio shells. It is not known whether bleaching adversely 
affects phytochemical levels in pistachios. Therefore, we identified for the 
first time multiple pistachio skin phenolics as quercetin (14.9 microg/g), 
luteolin (10.0 microg/g), eriodictyol (10.2 microg/g), rutin (1.6 microg/g), 
naringenin (1.2 microg/g), apigenin (0.2 microg/g), and the anthocyanins, 
cyanidin-3-galactoside (696 microg/g) and cyanidin-3-glucoside (209 microg/g). 
We investigated the effects of bleaching (0.1-50% hydrogen peroxide) on phenolic 
levels and antioxidative capacities in raw and roasted nuts. Because of their 
flavylium cation structures, anthocyanins were the most sensitive to bleaching. 
Bleaching decreased total anthocyanin levels [mug/g of skins (% hydrogen 
peroxide)]: 905 and 549 (0%); 653 and 145 (0.1%); 111 and 18.4 (5%); 6.1 and 3.2 
(25%); 0 and 0 (50%) for raw and roasted nuts, respectively. Bleaching also 
reduced antioxidative capacity [microM/g of Trolox (% hydrogen peroxide)]: 945 
and 725 (0%); 940 and 472 (0.1%); 930 and 455 (5%); 433 and 370 (25%); 189 and 
173 (50%), for raw and roasted nuts, respectively. Raw nuts preserved phenolic 
levels and antioxidant capacity better than roasted nuts, suggesting 
contributing effects of other substances and/or matrix effects that are 
destroyed by the roasting process. The destruction of bioactive phenolics in 
pistachio skins may negatively impact the potential health benefits arising from 
pistachio consumption.

Ellagitannins (ETs) from pomegranate juice (PJ) are reported to have numerous 
biological properties, but their absorption and metabolism in humans are poorly 
understood. To investigate the pharmacokinetics of pomegranate ETs, 18 healthy 
volunteers were given 180 mL of PJ concentrate, and blood samples were obtained 
for 6 h afterwards. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were obtained on the day 
before (-1), the day of (0), and the day after (+1) the study. Ellagic acid (EA) 
was detected in plasma of all subjects with a maximum concentration of 0.06 +/- 
0.01 micromol/L, area under concentration time curve of 0.17 +/- 0.02 (micromol 
x h) x L(-1), time of maximum concentration of 0.98 +/- 0.06 h, and elimination 
half-life of 0.71 +/- 0.08 h. EA metabolites, including dimethylellagic acid 
glucuronide (DMEAG) and hydroxy-6H-benzopyran-6-one derivatives (urolithins), 
were also detected in plasma and urine in conjugated and free forms. DMEAG was 
found in the urine obtained from 15 of 18 subjects on d 0, but was not detected 
on d -1 or +1, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker of intake. Urolithin 
A-glucuronide was found in urine samples from 11 subjects on d 0 and in the 
urine from 16 subjects on d +1. Urolithin B-glucuronide was found in the urine 
of 3 subjects on d 0 and in the urine of 5 subjects on d +1. Urolithins, formed 
by intestinal bacteria, may contribute to the biological effects of PJ as they 
may persist in plasma and tissues and account for some of the health benefits 
noted after chronic PJ consumption. Whether genetic polymorphisms in 
EA-metabolizing enzymes (e.g., catechol-O-methyl transferase and glucuronosyl 
transferase) are related to variations in response to PJ remains to be 
established.

Our group has shown in a phase II clinical trial that pomegranate juice (PJ) 
increases prostate specific antigen (PSA) doubling time in prostate cancer (CaP) 
patients with a rising PSA. Ellagitannins (ETs) are the most abundant 
polyphenols present in PJ and contribute greatly towards its reported biological 
properties. On consumption, ETs hydrolyze to release ellagic acid (EA), which is 
then converted by gut microflora to 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b, d]pyran-6-one 
(urolithin A, UA) derivatives. Despite the accumulating knowledge of ET 
metabolism in animals and humans, there is no available data on the 
pharmacokinetics and tissue disposition of urolithins. Using a standardized 
ET-enriched pomegranate extract (PE), we sought to further define the metabolism 
and tissue distribution of ET metabolites. PE and UA (synthesized in our 
laboratory) were administered to C57BL/6 wild-type male mice, and metabolite 
levels in plasma and tissues were determined over 24 h. ET metabolites were 
concentrated at higher levels in mouse prostate, colon, and intestinal tissues 
as compared to other tissues after administration of PE or UA. We also evaluated 
the effects of PE on CaP growth in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice 
injected subcutaneously with human CaP cells (LAPC-4). PE significantly 
inhibited LAPC-4 xenograft growth in SCID mice as compared to vehicle control. 
Finally, EA and several synthesized urolithins were shown to inhibit the growth 
of human CaP cells in vitro. The chemopreventive potential of pomegranate ETs 
and localization of their bioactive metabolites in mouse prostate tissue suggest 
that pomegranate may play a role in CaP treatment and chemoprevention. This 
warrants future human tissue bioavailability studies and further clinical 
studies in men with CaP.

Vidalia onion varieties Nirvana, DPS 1032, Yellow 2025, King-Midas, and SBO 133 
grown at Vidalia, Georgia, were analyzed for flavonoid content. A 
high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with photodiode array 
detection was used for quantification. Compounds were analyzed as aglycons after 
acid hydrolysis with 1.2 M HCl. Identification of each compound was based on 
comparison of its retention time and UV spectra with those of pure commercial 
standards. Three major flavonoids, kaempferol, myricetin, and quercetin, were 
identified and quantified. Quercetin was the major flavonoid (7.70-46.32 mg/100 
g fresh weight, FW) present in all varieties, followed by myricetin (2.77-4.13 
mg/100 g FW). Minor quantities of kaempferol (1.10-1.98 mg/100 g FW) were also 
detected. The total polyphenols and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity 
(TEAC) ranged from 73.33 to 180.84 mg/100 g FW and 0.92-1.56 microM TEAC/g FW, 
respectively. A positive but weaker correlation was obtained for total 
polyphenols versus antioxidant capacity. Nevertheless, a stronger correlation 
(r(2) = 0.34) was obtained between flavonoid content versus antioxidant 
capacity. The data indicate that Vidalia onions are a rich source of quercetin, 
and they also contain myricetin and kaempferol.

FW. A linear relationship was observed between TEAC values and total polyphenols 
or total anthocyanins. The data indicate that blueberries and blackberries are 
rich sources of antioxidants.

Hydrophilic phenols are the most abundant natural antioxidants of virgin olive 
oil (VOO), in which tocopherols and carotenes are also present. The prevalent 
classes of hydrophilic phenols found in VOO are phenyl alcohols, phenolic acids, 
secoiridoids such as the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid 
linked to (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol or (p-hydroxypheny1)ethanol 
(3,4-DHPEA-EDA or p-HPEA-EDA) and an isomer of the oleuropein aglycon 
(3,4-DHPEA-EA), lignans such as (+)-1-acetoxypinoresinol and (+)-pinoresinol, 
and flavonoids. A new method for the analysis of VOO hydrophilic phenols by 
direct injection in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with the use 
of a fluorescence detector (FLD) has been proposed and compared with the 
traditional liquid-liquid extraction technique followed by the HPLC analysis 
utilizing a diode array detector (DAD) and a FLD. Results show that the most 
important classes of phenolic compounds occurring in VOO can be evaluated using 
HPLC direct injection. The efficiency of the new method, as compared to the 
liquid-liquid extraction, was higher to quantify phenyl alcohols, lignans, and 
3,4-DHPEA-EA and lower for the evaluation of 3,4-DHPEA-EDA and p-HPEA-EDA.

An off-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) and ultra-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and 
validated for determining procyanidins, catechin, epicatechin, dimer, and trimer 
in plasma samples. In the validation procedure of the analytical method, 
linearity, precision, accuracy, detection limits (LODs), quantification limits 
(LOQs), and the matrix effect were studied. Recoveries of the procyanidins were 
higher than 84%, except for the trimer, which was 65%. The LODs and LOQs were 
lower than 0.003 and 0.01 microM, respectively, for all the procyanidins 
studied, except for the trimers, which were 0.8 and 0.98 microM, respectively. 
This methodology was then applied for the analysis of rat plasma obtained 2h 
after ingestion of grape seed phenolic extract. Monomers (catechin and 
epicatechin), dimer and trimer in their native form were detected and quantified 
in plasma samples, and their concentration ranged from 0.85 to 8.55 microM. 
Moreover, several metabolites, such as catechin and epicatechin glucuronide, 
catechin and epicatechin methyl glucuronide, and catechin and epicatechin 
methyl-sulphate were identified. These conjugated forms were quantified, in 
reference to the respective unconjugated form, showing concentrations between 
0.06 and 23.90 microM.

The position of conjugation of the flavonoid quercetin dramatically affects 
biological activity in vitro, therefore it is important to determine the exact 
nature of the plasma metabolites. In the present study, we have used various 
methods (HPLC with diode array detection, LCMS, chemical and enzymic synthesis 
of authentic conjugates and specific enzymic hydrolysis) to show that quercetin 
glucosides are not present in plasma of human subjects 1.5 h after consumption 
of onions (a rich source of flavonoid glucosides). All four individuals had 
similar qualitative profiles of metabolites. The major circulating compounds in 
the plasma after 1.5 h are identified as quercetin-3-glucuronide, 
3'-methylquercetin-3-glucuronide and quercetin-3'-sulfate. The existence of 
substitutions in the B and/or C ring of plasma quercetin metabolites suggests 
that these conjugates will each have very different biological activities.

BACKGROUND: The nonsteroidal estrogen equol occurs as diastereoisomers, 
S-(-)equol and R-(+)equol, both of which have significant biological actions. 
S-(-)equol, the naturally occurring enantiomer produced by 20-30% of adults 
consuming soy foods, has selective affinity for estrogen receptor-beta, whereas 
both enantiomers modulate androgen action. Little is known about the 
pharmacokinetics of the diastereoisomers, despite current interest in developing 
equol as a nutraceutical or pharmaceutical agent.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare the pharmacokinetics of S-(-)equol and 
R-(+)equol by using [13C] stable-isotope-labeled tracers to facilitate the 
optimization of clinical studies aimed at evaluating the potential of these 
diastereoisomers in the prevention and treatment of estrogen- and 
androgen-dependent conditions.
DESIGN: A randomized, crossover, open-label study in 12 healthy adults (6 men 
and 6 women) compared the plasma and urinary pharmacokinetics of orally 
administered enantiomeric pure forms of S-(-)[2-13C]equol, R-(+)[2-13C]equol, 
and the racemic mixture. Plasma and urinary [13C]R-equol and [13C]S-equol 
concentrations were measured by tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Plasma [13C]equol concentration appearance and disappearance curves 
showed that both enantiomers were rapidly absorbed, attained high circulating 
concentrations, and had a similar terminal elimination half-life of 7-8 h. The 
systemic bioavailability and fractional absorption of R-(+)[2-13C]equol were 
higher than those of S-(-)[2-13C]equol or the racemate. The pharmacokinetics of 
racemic (+/-)[2-13C]equol were different from those of the individual 
enantiomers: slower absorption, lower peak plasma concentrations, and lower 
systemic bioavailability.
CONCLUSIONS: The high bioavailability of both diastereoisomers contrasts with 
previous findings for the soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein, both of which 
have relatively poor bioavailability, and suggests that low doses of equol taken 
twice daily may be sufficient to achieve biological effects.

The soy isoflavone metabolite, S-(-)equol, has selective affinity for estrogen 
receptor (ER)beta and also antagonizes in vivo the action of 
dihydrotestosterone. It is therefore of interest as a potential new therapeutic 
agent in hormone-dependent conditions and is under development as a 
nutraceutical. Our objective in this study was to define the pharmacokinetics of 
natural S-(-)equol after administration of SE5-OH, a newly developed S-(-)equol 
supplement made by incubation of the equol-producing bacterium Lactococcus 
garvieae with soy germ isoflavones. In a single-center, open-label, randomized, 
2-period crossover design study, the pharmacokinetics of S-(-)equol administered 
as single-bolus oral doses of 10 and 30 mg in the form of SE5-OH tablets was 
determined in 12 healthy postmenopausal women. S-(-)equol was measured in plasma 
and urine collected at timed intervals over a 48-h period postdosing using 
tandem MS. Equol-producer status was also determined after a soymilk challenge 
conducted after the pharmacokinetic sampling was complete. S-(-)equol was 
rapidly absorbed after oral administration and attained high plasma 
concentrations, with a plasma elimination half-life of 8 h. The maximum plasma 
concentration/dose, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 
to infinity/dose, and the fraction of dose excreted in urine (%f(e,u)) were 
similar for the 2 doses, indicating a dose-proportional response in total 
S-(-)equol pharmacokinetics. The systemic bioavailability of S-(-)equol was very 
high, as the %f(e,u) was 82% for both doses, which is greater than published 
data for the soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein. Three participants were 
determined to be equol-producers, representing a 25% frequency, and 
equol-producer status had no effect on natural S-(-)equol pharmacokinetics.

Several phenolic acids, e.g. caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, 
gallic acid and ellagic acid, which occur naturally, are inhibitors of 
carcinogenesis. In this paper we present a new method for the simultaneous 
determination of all of these compounds, except ellagic acid, in juices by 
reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using ultraviolet 
detection and involving isocratic elution, and we have devised an HPLC method 
for the determination of ellagic acid in juices. The experimental results showed 
that cherry juice contains a high concentration of chlorogenic acid and the 
content of bound gallic acid in black and green grape juices is high compared to 
that of other phenolic acids.

Total equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and phenolic content of 26 common 
spice extracts from 12 botanical families were investigated. Qualitative and 
quantitative analyses of major phenolics in the spice extracts were 
systematically conducted by reversed-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography (RP-HPLC). Many spices contained high levels of phenolics and 
demonstrated high antioxidant capacity. Wide variation in TEAC values 
(0.55-168.7 mmol/100 g) and total phenolic content (0.04-14.38 g of gallic acid 
equivalent/100 g) was observed. A highly positive linear relationship (R2= 0.95) 
obtained between TEAC values and total phenolic content showed that phenolic 
compounds in the tested spices contributed significantly to their antioxidant 
capacity. Major types of phenolic constituents identified in the spice extracts 
were phenolic acids, phenolic diterpenes, flavonoids, and volatile oils (e.g., 
aromatic compounds). Rosmarinic acid was the dominant phenolic compound in the 
six spices of the family Labiatae. Phenolic volatile oils were the principal 
active ingredients in most spices. The spices and related families with the 
highest antioxidant capacity were screened, e.g., clove in the Myrtaceae, 
cinnamon in the Lauraceae, oregano in the Labiatae, etc., representing potential 
sources of potent natural antioxidants for commercial exploitation. This study 
provides direct comparative data on antioxidant capacity and total and 
individual phenolics contents of the 26 spice extracts.

In this study, we investigated the intestinal absorption of luteolin and 
luteolin 7-O-beta-glucoside in rats by HPLC. The absorption analysis using rat 
everted small intestine demonstrated that luteolin was converted to glucuronides 
during passing through the intestinal mucosa and that luteolin 
7-O-beta-glucoside was absorbed after hydrolysis to luteolin. Free luteolin, its 
conjugates and methylated conjugates were present in rat plasma after dosing. 
This suggests that some luteolin can escape the intestinal conjugation and the 
hepatic sulfation/methylation. LC/MS analysis showed that the main conjugate 
which circulates in the blood was a monoglucuronide of the unchanged aglycone. 
Luteolin in propyleneglycol was absorbed more rapidly than that in 0.5% 
carboxymethyl cellulose. The plasma concentration of luteolin and its conjugates 
reached the highest level 15 min and 30 min after dosing with luteolin in 
propyleneglycol, respectively. HPLC analysis also allowed us to demonstrate the 
presence of free luteolin and its monoglucuronide in human serum after ingestion 
of luteolin.

The beneficial effects of red, yellow and white onion extracts have been 
assessed by antioxidant activity and antimutagenic activity. And the effects 
compared to BHT and ascorbic acid. Total phenolic compounds and flavonoids in 
onion extracts were determined. Yellow onion extract had more organic acid and 
free sugar than those detected in the white and red onion extract. The 
scavenging activity of DPPH radical and H(2)O(2) were increased depending on the 
concentration. The antioxidant activities using beta-carotene-linoleate system 
and reducing power were increased but the effect was small to that of BHT and 
ascorbic acid. After digested, extracts showed antimutagenic activities, and it 
seems that they inhibit the mutagenicity for digesting. This study demonstrated 
that the antimutagenicities and antioxidant properties of ethyl acetate extract 
against mutagens were related to their phenols and flavonoids, which are heat 
stable and losses digestive juices are relatively low.

The antioxidant properties of hydroxymatairesinol (HM-3000) were studied in 
vitro in lipid peroxidation, superoxide and peroxyl radical scavenging, and 
LDL-oxidation models in comparison with the known synthetic antioxidants Trolox 
(a water-soluble vitamin E derivative), butylated hydroxyanisol (BHA) and 
butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). On a molar basis HM-3000 was a more effective 
antioxidant than Trolox in all assays and more effective than BHT or BHA in 
lipid peroxidation and superoxide scavenging test. The in vivo antioxidative 
effect (evaluated as the weight gain of C57BL/6J mice fed an 
alpha-tocopherol-deficient diet) of HM-3000 (500 mg/kg per day) was comparable 
to that of DL-alpha-tocopherol (766 mg/kg per day). The antitumor activity of 
HM-3000 was studied in dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced rat mammary 
cancer. HM-3000 had a statistically significant inhibitory effect on tumor 
growth. Prevention of tumor formation was also evaluated in the Apc(Min) mice 
model, which develops intestinal polyps spontaneously. HM-3000 was given in diet 
at 30 mg/kg per day and decreased the formation of polyps and prevented 
beta-catenin accumulation into the nucleus, the pathophysiological hallmark of 
polyp formation in this mouse model. In short-term toxicity studies (up to 28 
days) HM-3000 was essentially non-toxic when given p.o. to rats and dogs (daily 
doses up to 2000 and 665 mg/kg, respectively); HM-3000 was shown to be well 
absorbed (> 50% of the dose) and rapidly eliminated. In human studies HM-3000 
has been given in single doses up to 1350 mg to healthy male volunteers without 
treatment-related adverse events. Rapid absorption from the gastrointestinal 
tract and partial metabolism to enterolactone in humans was demonstrated. In 
summary, HM-3000 is a safe, novel enterolactone precursor lignan with 
antioxidant and antitumor properties.

Flavanones, the main polyphenols of citrus fruits, are thought to contribute to 
the protective effects of these fruits against cardiovascular diseases and 
cancer. The metabolism of naringin (naringenin 7-O-neohesperidoside) is studied 
here in healthy (sham-operated, ShO) and tumor-bearing (TuB) rats. The tumor was 
induced by implanting Yoshida's sarcoma in hindlimb. Both groups received for 7 
days a semi-synthetic diet containing 0.5% naringin in per feeding conditions. 
Flavanones were analyzed in plasma, liver, kidney and urine by tandem mass 
spectrometry. Naringenin conjugates (essentially glucuronides) accounted for up 
to 98% of the total flavanones in plasma. Low amounts of hesperetin (4'-O-methyl 
naringénine) and isosakuranetin (3'-hydroxy-4'-O-methylnaringenin) were also 
detected in all biological samples and accounted for 2% of the total flavanones 
in plasma. They were largely present as aglycones. The in vivo hydroxylation of 
flavanones is described here for the first time. Total concentrations of 
naringenin metabolites reached 17.3+/-2.7 microM in plasma 6 hours after the 
beginning of the meal in healthy rats and only 10.6+/-1.3 microM in TuB rats. 
The nature of metabolites was similar in both healthy and TuB rats and in 
plasma, tissues and urine. The lower concentration of flavanones in the TuB rats 
suggests that disease and more particularly cancer, may affect the 
bioavailability of flavonoids.

XAD-2 cleaning step. These analyses showed that all the samples presented a 
similar profile composed of at least eight identified phenolic compounds, 
several unidentified characteristic procyanidin polymers, and sodium benzoate as 
preservative of quince jams. Several samples also contained arbutin, suggesting 
that these quince jam samples were fraudulently adulterated with pear puree.

Qualitative and quantitative analyses of phenolic compounds were carried out on 
quince fruit samples from seven different geographical origins in Portugal. For 
each origin, both pulp and peel were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC-DAD and 
HPLC-DAD/MS. The results revealed differences between the phenolic profiles of 
pulps and peels in all studied cases. The pulps contained mainly caffeoylquinic 
acids (3-, 4-, and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acids and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid) and 
one quercetin glycoside, rutin (in low amount). The peels presented the same 
caffeoylquinic acids and several flavonol glycosides: quercetin 3-galactoside, 
kaempferol 3-glucoside, kaempferol 3-rutinoside, and several unidentified 
compounds (probably kaempferol glycoside and quercetin and kaempferol glycosides 
acylated with p-coumaric acid). The highest content of phenolics was found in 
peels.

Isoflavones and carotenoids in four experimental genotypes and Hutcheson 
cultivar soybeans were evaluated as a function of processing treatments and 
maturity. Total isoflavone and carotenoid contents were affected by genotypes 
and maturity stages (p < 0.0001). Total isoflavones ranged from 472 microg/g (in 
NTCPR93-40) to 2280 microg/g (in Hutcheson). Lutein contents ranged from 895 (in 
NTCPR93-286) to 2119 (in Honey Brown), and beta-carotene ranged from 291 (in 
Hutcheson) to 491 (in NICPR92-40) microg/100 g. Mean total isoflavone retention 
percentages in immature Hutcheson soybeans were 46% (boiling), 53% (freezing), 
and 40% (freeze-drying). Mean retentions of lutein and beta-carotene, 
respectively, were 92 and 73% in frozen, 62 and 62% in boiled, and 34 and 27% in 
freeze-dried soybeans. Boiling caused a substantial increase in daidzin, 
genistin, and genistein. The results show that post-harvest changes in total 
isoflavones and carotenoids in soybeans are influenced by processing methods, 
but genotype has an effect on isoflavone and carotenoid profiles during seed 
development.

Fresh figs were subjected to two different drying processes: sun-drying and 
oven-drying. To assess their effect on the nutritional and health-related 
properties of figs, sugars, organic acids, single phenolics, total phenolics, 
and antioxidant activity were determined before and after processing. Samples 
were analyzed three times in a year, and phenolic compounds were determined 
using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry 
(HPLC-MS). In figs, monomer sugars predominate, which is important nutritional 
information, and the content of sugars as well as organic acids in fresh figs 
was lower than in dried fruits. However, the best sugar/organic acid ratio was 
measured after the sun-drying process. Analysis of individual phenolic compounds 
revealed a higher content of all phenolic groups determined after the 
oven-drying process, with the exception of cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside. Similarly, 
higher total phenolic content and antioxidant activity were detected after the 
drying process. With these results it can be concluded that the differences in 
analyzed compounds in fresh and dried figs are significant. The differences 
between the sun-dried and oven-dried fruits were determined in organic acids, 
sugars, chlorogenic acid, catechin, epicatechin, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, 
luteolin-8-C-glucoside, and total phenolic contents. The results indicate that 
properly dried figs can be used as a good source of phenolic compounds.

Apples are an important source of flavonoids in the human diet. The effect of 
processing apples into juice on polyphenolic antioxidant content and activity is 
described. Raw juice obtained from Jonagold apples by pulping and straight 
pressing or after pulp enzyming had an antioxidant activity that was only 10 and 
3%, respectively, of the activity of the fresh apples. The levels of flavonoids 
and chlorogenic acid in the juice were reduced to between 50% (chlorogenic acid) 
and 3% (catechins). Most of the antioxidants were retained in the pomace rather 
than being transferred into the juice. Apparently, most of the antioxidant 
compounds are absorbed to the solid matter of the pomace. In apple juice, 45% of 
the total measured antioxidant activity could be ascribed to the analyzed 
antioxidants. For three apple cultivars tested (Elstar, Golden Delicious, and 
Jonagold), the processing methods had similar effects. The results indicate that 
processing can have a major impact on the bioactivity of products.

The difference in urinary excretion of mammalian and plant lignans in rats was 
determined after oral administration of equivalent doses (25 mg/kg of body 
weight) of 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR), lariciresinol (LAR), matairesinol (MR), 
and secoisolariciresinol (SECO). Twenty-four hours-urine samples were collected 
after a single dose and after administration of one dose/day for 10 days. Eight 
lignans were analysed in urine extracts using a high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method showing good sensitivity and 
repeatability. After a single dose of HMR, LAR, MR, and SECO, the main 
metabolites were 7-hydroxyenterolactone (HENL), cyclolariciresinol (CLAR), 
enterolactone (ENL), and enterodiol (END), respectively, but after 10-day 
exposure ENL was the main metabolite of all the tested lignans, showing a 
considerably higher excretion than after a single dose. Metabolic 
transformations of plant lignans into each other could also be observed.

In seed extracts of five oilseed species, in bran extracts of three cereal 
species, and in seed and/or whole berry extracts of 10 berry species, the 
concentrations of a large number of lignans and the enantiomeric composition of 
selected lignans were determined. In the case of sesame and hemp seeds, the 
lignan content and composition of the whole seeds was compared to that of the 
hulled seeds. The results showed that cloudberry seeds are the third most 
lignan-rich food source after linseeds and whole sesame seeds, and that most of 
the berry species analysed were more lignan-rich than the cereal brans. The 
lignans are concentrated in the hull of the oilseeds and in the seeds of the 
berries. In most samples, secoisolarici-, pino-, medio-, and syringaresinol were 
present as a mixture of two enantiomers.

A modified high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for 
determination of trans-resveratrol (resveratrol) in peanuts and peanut products 
has been developed. Resveratrol was extracted with acetonitrile-water (90/10, 
v/v) by blending with diatomaceous earth at high speed followed by purification 
of an aliquot of the extract on a minicolumn packed with Al(2)O(3)-ODS (C(18)) 
mixture. The column was eluted with acetonitrile-water (90/10, v/v), eluate was 
evaporated under nitrogen, and residue was dissolved in HPLC mobile phase. 
Resveratrol in an aliquot of purified extract was quantitated by HPLC on silica 
gel with n-hexane-2-propanol-water-acetonitrile-acetic acid (1050/270/17/5/1, 
v/v) as a mobile phase. The recovery of resveratrol added to diatomaceous earth 
at 0.05 microg/g was 98.95 +/- 17.79%; the recovery of the standard added to 
fresh peanuts (with 0.070 microg/g natural level of resveratrol) at 0.50, 5.00, 
and 10.00 microg/g was 117.23 +/- 8.87, 100.10 +/- 2.49, and 100.45 +/- 1.51%, 
respectively. The quantitation limit of resveratrol in fresh peanuts was about 
0. 01 microg/g. Roasted peanuts had the lowest content of resveratrol of 0.055 
+/- 0.023 microg/g (n = 21), while in peanut butter its concentration was 
significantly higher, 0.324 +/- 0.129 microg/g (n = 46), and boiled peanuts had 
the highest level of 5.138 +/- 2.849 microg/g (n = 12). Resveratrol content in 
commercial peanut products was similar to the resveratrol content of the raw 
peanut fractions routinely used for making them.

Fig fruit has been a typical component in the health-promoting Mediterranean 
diet for millennia. To study the potential health-promoting constituents of fig 
fruits, six commercial fig varieties differing in color (black, red, yellow, and 
green) were analyzed for total polyphenols, total flavonoids, antioxidant 
capacity, and amount and profile of anthocyanins. Using reversed-phase liquid 
chromatography (RP-LC), various concentrations of anthocyanins but a similar 
profile was found in all varieties studied. Hydrolysis revealed cyanidin as the 
major aglycon. Proton and carbon NMR confirmed cyanidin-3-O-rhamnoglucoside 
(cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside; C3R) as the main anthocyanin in all fruits. Color 
appearance of fig extract correlated well with total polyphenols, flavonoids, 
anthocyanins, and antioxidant capacity. Extracts of darker varieties showed 
higher contents of phytochemicals compared to lighter colored varieties. Fruit 
skins contributed most of the above phytochemicals and antioxidant activity 
compared to the fruit pulp. Antioxidant capacity correlated well with the 
amounts of polyphenols and anthocyanins (R2 = 0.985 and 0.992, respectively). In 
the dark-colored Mission and the red Brown-Turkey varieties, the anthocyanin 
fraction contributed 36 and 28% of the total antioxidant capacity, respectively. 
C3R contributed 92% of the total antioxidant capacity of the anthocyanin 
fraction. Fruits of the Mission variety contained the highest levels of 
polyphenols, flavonoids, and anthocyanins and exhibited the highest antioxidant 
capacity.

A phytochemical study was undertaken on tronchuda cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. 
var. costata DC) cultivated under conventional and organic practices and 
collected at different times. Six organic acids (aconitic, citric, ascorbic, 
malic, shikimic, and fumaric acids) were identified and quantified by HPLC-UV. 
Qualitative and quantitative differences were noted between internal and 
external leaves. Analysis of the phenolics of the internal leaves was achieved 
by HPLC-DAD, and the phenolic profile obtained was revealed to be distinct from 
that of the external leaves. By this means were identified and quantified 11 
compounds: 3-p-coumaroylquinic acid, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, 
kaempferol 3-O-(caffeoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 
3-O-(sinapoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 
3-O-(feruloyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside, two 
isomeric forms of 1,2-disinapoylgentiobiose, 1-sinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose, 
1,2,2'-trisinapoylgentiobiose, and 1,2'-disinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose. In 
general, internal leaves exhibited more constant chemical profiles.

Seed coat, cotyledon and embryonic axe fractions of chickpea (Cicer arietinum 
L.) and horse gram (Macrotyloma uniflorum L.) were evaluated for their phenolic 
composition in relation to antioxidant activities. Compositional analysis of 
phenolics by HPLC revealed a wide variation in the distribution of flavonols, 
isoflavones, phenolic acids and anthocyanins among these legume fractions. 
Although cotyledon fractions of both the legumes were rich in phenolic acids, 
the concentrations of flavonols such as quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin 
were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than the embryonic axe and seed coat 
fractions. Ferulic, chlorogenic, caffeic, and vanillic acids were the principal 
phenolic acids found in cotyledons. The most striking difference was the 
predominance of isoflavones in embryonic axe fractions. Although the isoflavone 
genistein was detected in all three fractions of chickpea, it was present 
exclusively in the embryonic axe fraction of horse gram at levels greater than 
daidzein. Furthermore, cyanidin, petunidin, and delphinidin were detected in 
seed coat and embryonic axe fractions but not in cotyledons. In addition to 
these three anthocyanins, malvidin was found only in the horse gram seed coat 
fraction. Seed coat fractions having higher total phenolic indexes were found to 
be the most active 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavengers 
(IC(50) 13.1 to 18.6 microg/mL) followed by embryonic axe and cotyledon 
fractions (IC(50) 15.4 to 34.2 microg/mL). Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) 
scavenging capacities of cotyledons, embryonic axe and seed coats were 12.3, 
34.1 and 78.6% for chickpea and 15.1, 56.8 and 92.6% for horse gram, 
respectively. The multiple antioxidant activity of horse gram and chickpea 
fractions was evident, as they also possessed reducing power and ferrous 
ion-chelating potency. These results contributed to the understanding of the 
relationships between major phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities of 
legumes and provided useful information for effective utilization of 
legume-milled fractions as functional food ingredients for promoting health.

Ten healthy human subjects consumed 500 mL of Choladi green tea, containing 648 
mumol of flavan-3-ols after which plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h 
period and analysed by HPLC-MS. Plasma contained a total of ten metabolites, in 
the form of O-methylated, sulphated and glucuronide conjugates of (epi)catechin 
and (epi)gallocatechin, with 29-126 nM peak plasma concentrations (C(max)) 
occurring 1.6-2.3 h after ingestion, indicative of absorption in the small 
intestine. Plasma also contained unmetabolised (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate 
and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate with respective C(max) values of 55 and 25 nM. 
Urine excreted 0-24 h after consumption of green tea contained 15 metabolites of 
(epi)catechin and (epi)gallocatechin, but (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate and 
(-)-epicatechin-3-gallate were not detected. Overall flavan-3-ol metabolite 
excretion was equivalent to 8.1% of intake, however, urinary (epi)gallocatechin 
metabolites corresponded to 11.4% of (epi)gallocatechin ingestion while 
(epi)catechin metabolites were detected in amounts equivalent to 28.5% of 
(epi)catechin intake. These findings imply that (epi)catechins are highly 
bioavailable, being absorbed and excreted to a much greater extent than most 
other flavonoids. It is also evident that flavan-3-ol metabolites are rapidly 
turned over in the circulatory system and as a consequence C(max) values are not 
an accurate quantitative indicator of the extent to which absorption occurs.

Sensory-guided decomposition of roasted cocoa nibs revealed that, besides 
theobromine and caffeine, a series of bitter-tasting 2,5-diketopiperazines and 
flavan-3-ols were the key inducers of the bitter taste as well as the astringent 
mouthfeel imparted upon consumption of roasted cocoa. In addition, a number of 
polyphenol glycopyranosides as well as a series of N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino 
acids have been identified as key astringent compounds of roasted cocoa. In the 
present investigation, a total of 84 putative taste compounds were quantified in 
roasted cocoa beans and then rated for the taste contribution on the basis of 
dose-over-threshold (DoT) factors to bridge the gap between pure structural 
chemistry and human taste perception. To verify these quantitative results, an 
aqueous taste reconstitute was prepared by blending aqueous solutions of the 
individual taste compounds in their ""natural"" concentrations. Sensory analyses 
revealed that the taste profile of this artificial cocktail was very close to 
the taste profile of an aqueous suspension of roasted cocoa nibs. To further 
narrow down the number of key taste compounds, finally, taste omission 
experiments and human dose/response functions were performed, demonstrating that 
the bitter-tasting alkaloids theobromine and caffeine, seven bitter-tasting 
diketopiperazines, seven bitter- and astringent-tasting flavan-3-ols, six 
puckering astringent N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino acids, four velvety astringent 
flavonol glycosides, gamma-aminobutyric acid, beta-aminoisobutyric acid, and six 
organic acids are the key organoleptics of the roasted cocoa nibs.

To investigate probable health benefits of flavonoids and stilbenes in red wine 
a new reversed-phase (RP) high-performance liquid-chromatographic (HPLC) method 
with enhanced separation efficiency and improved selectivity, sensitivity, and 
speed has been established for determination of the flavonoids quercetin, 
myricetin and kaempferol and the stilbenes cis- and trans-resveratrol, in a 
single run . UV-absorbance, fluorescence (FLD), and mass-spectrometric (MS) 
detection were also evaluated. UV-absorbance detection at 320 nm for stilbenes 
and 377 nm for flavonoids enables their determination up to the nanogram range 
with a linearity of R2>0.9999 (linear range 50 ng mL(-1)-50 microg mL(-1)). 
Calculated values of average recoveries were between 95 and 105% for all 
analytes. For resveratrol, fluorescence detection was highly selective and twice 
as sensitive as UV detection, and linearity was satisfactory (R2>0.9996; linear 
range see UV detection). For the detection of the hydrophilic glycosidic 
compounds piceid and rutin, which are coeluted with other hydrophilic 
ingredients, the validated RP HPLC system was coupled to a quadrupole ion-trap 
mass-spectrometer (MS) via an electrospray interface (ESI) with 25% ammonia 
solution as sheath liquid. MS detection was, highly linear (R2>0.9878; linear 
range 50 ng mL(-1)-50 microg mL(-1)) for all investigated analytes and the 
limits of detection were in the low nanogram range. Compared with UV detection 
MS detection resulted in a 200% increase in signal intensity for myricetin and 
400% increases for quercetin and kaempferol, but equal signal intensity for 
resveratrol. Calculated values of average recoveries were 102% for myricetin and 
79% for piceid. Collision induced dissociation (CID) was also used to obtain 
characteristic fragmentation fingerprints to facilitate qualitative and 
quantitative analysis even in complex matrices. Finally, this hyphenated 
HPLC-ESI-MS method was highly suitable and an essential improvement compared 
with UV- and fluorescence detection.

A method for quantitation of six prenylflavonoids (xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, 
desmethylxanthohumol, 6- and 8-prenylnaringenins and 6-geranylnaringenin) in 
hops and beer by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry has been developed. The method 
allows direct analysis of beer and crude methanolic extracts of hops. After HPLC 
separation, prenylflavonoids were detected by positive ion multiple-reaction 
monitoring using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a heated 
nebulizer--atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface. The accuracy and 
precision were evaluated by replicate analyses of (spiked) samples. Thirteen 
commercial beers were analysed with the method. Isoxanthohumol, formed by 
isomerization of xanthohumol during the brewing process, was the most abundant 
flavonoid in hopped beers, ranging from 0.04 to 3.44 mg/l.

The flavonol contents of 20 varieties of tomato fruit were investigated in 
relation to variety, size, season, and country of origin. Ten commonly consumed 
tomato-based food products were also assessed. Free and conjugated flavonols 
were identified and quantified using reversed-phase HPLC. Ninety-eight percent 
of flavonols detected in tomatoes were found to occur in the skin. Tomatoes 
contained, primarily as conjugates, quercetin and kaempferol. The main quercetin 
conjugate was identified as rutin (quercetin 3-rhamnosylglucoside) by LC-MS. The 
total flavonol content of the different varieties of tomato that were analyzed 
varied from 1.3 to 22.2 microgram/g of fresh weight (fw). Smaller cherry tomato 
fruits originating from warm sunny climates, such as Spain and Israel, were 
found to contain the highest concentration of flavonols. Among the tomato-based 
products investigated, tomato juice and tomato purée were rich in flavonols, 
containing 14-16 microgram/mL and 70 microgram/g fw, respectively. In contrast 
to fresh tomatoes, most tomato-based products contained significant amounts of 
free flavonols.

Teas represent a rich source of dietary antioxidants. This paper describes 
analysis of the antioxidant potential of individual tea phenolics using an 
on-line high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Tea phenolics from 
Kenyan green and black teas were identified using liquid chromatography--mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) in conjunction with the analysis of their 
2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS+) radical scavenging 
ability. Antioxidant potential of flavan-3-ols, caffeoylquinic acids, flavonols, 
and theaflavins was assessed in comparison to the synthetic vitamin E analogue 
Trolox. (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate was identified as the most potent 
antioxidant with a Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) value of 3.0, 
contributing approximately 30% of the total antioxidant capacity of green tea. 
Theaflavins retained antioxidant capacity similar to that of (-)-epicatechin 
monomers whilst conjugated flavonols did not contribute significantly to the 
antioxidant capacity of either green or black tea. After HPLC analysis of the 
antioxidant capacity of phenolics in black tea some 80% of antioxidant activity 
remained unaccounted for indicating the potential importance of thearubigens as 
antioxidants in black teas.

acid. Subjects were fed 45 g of freeze-dried BRB daily for 7 days. Blood samples 
were collected predose on days 1 and 7 and at 10 time points postdose. Urine was 
collected for 12 hours predose on days 1 and 7 and at three 4-hour intervals 
postdose. Maximum concentrations of anthocyanins and ellagic acid in plasma 
occurred at 1 to 2 hours, and maximum quantities in urine appeared from 0 to 4 
hours. Overall, less than 1% of these compounds were absorbed and excreted in 
urine. None of the pharmacokinetic parameters changed significantly between days 
1 and 7. In conclusion, 45 g of freeze-dried BRB daily are well tolerated and 
result in quantifiable anthocyanins and ellagic acid in plasma and urine.

BACKGROUND: The organic food sales have been increasing during the recent years. 
It has been hypothesised that organically grown fruits are healthier based on 
their higher content of phytochemicals. However, data on the bioavailability of 
phytochemicals from organically or conventionally produced plant foods are 
scarce.
METHODS: Two human intervention studies were performed to compare the 
bioavailability of polyphenols in healthy men after ingestion of apples from 
different farming systems. The administered apples were grown organically and 
conventionally under defined conditions and characterised regarding their 
polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity. No significant differences in the 
polyphenol content and the antioxidant capacity from the organic and 
conventional farming system were observed.
RESULTS: In the short-term intervention study, six men consumed either 
organically or conventionally produced apples in a randomized cross-over study. 
After intake of 1 kg apples, phloretin (C (max) 13 + or - 5 nmol/l, t (max) 1.7 
+ or - 1.2 h) and coumaric acid (C (max )35 + or - 12 nmol/l, t (max) 3.0 + or - 
0.8 h) plasma concentrations increased significantly (P < 0.0001) in both 
intervention groups, without differences between the two farming systems. In the 
long-term intervention study, 43 healthy volunteers consumed organically or 
conventionally produced apples (500 g/day; 4 weeks) or no apples in a 
double-blind, randomized intervention study. In this study, 24 h after the last 
dosing regime, the apple intake did not result in increasing polyphenol 
concentrations in plasma and urine compared to the control group suggesting no 
accumulation of apple polyphenols or degradation products in humans.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the two farming systems 
(organic/conventional) do not result in differences in the bioavailability of 
apple polyphenols.

An extract from flaxseed containing oligomeric structures of the phenolic 
glucosides secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), p-coumaric acid glucoside and 
ferulic acid glucoside was fractionated into three oligomeric fractions (F50, 
F60 and F70) by reversed phase liquid chromatography and further subfractionated 
by Sepharose CL-6B. The F50 fraction, which had the highest proportion of 
hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides, was also fractionated on Sephadex LH-20 
according to hydrophobicity and size. The different separations resulted in 
complex profiles of UV-absorbing molecules. HPLC analyses indicated that 
reversed-phase chromatography separated the oligomers according to composition 
of the phenolic glucosides, while the subfractionation revealed that other 
structural features of the oligomers were also important. Using the DPPH 
radical, SDG and oligomeric fractions showed similar hydrogen-donating abilities 
comparable to ferulic acid but higher than α-tocopherol, which suggests that SDG 
was the only active antioxidant.

Three phenolic glucosides, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, p-coumaric acid 
glucoside and ferulic acid glucoside, were analyzed in commercial breads 
containing flaxseed. The total phenolic glucoside content ranged from 15 to 
157mg/100g dry bread. Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside was the dominating 
phenolic glucoside with an average relative content of 62%, followed by 
p-coumaric acid glucoside (20%) and ferulic acid glucoside (18%). Strong 
positive correlations between the phenolic glucosides were found, indicating no 
major effect of raw material or bread-making process on the relative content of 
the phenolic glucosides in flaxseed.

This research studies in detail the contents of phenolic compounds determined by 
the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and the antioxidant activities determined by the 
TEAC (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity), DPPH (using 
diphenyl-p-picrylhydrazyl radical), and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) 
methods, and their correlations for used standards with these methods 
(catechine, gallic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, Trolox, ascorbic acid, and 
ferrous sulfate) and extracts from several species of commonly consumed 
vegetables were studied in detail. The comparison of absolute values of 
absorption coefficients for used standards and for individual methods allows one 
to choose optimal common standards for methods to be compared. The procedures 
applied for the same sets of the extracts using identical calibration procedures 
and common standards allowed better comparison of the results obtained by the 
TEAC, DPPH, and FRAP methods. The values of content of phenolic substances and 
total antioxidant activity of the sets of samples correlate very well for all 
used methods. The very high values of antioxidant activity were found in 
intensely colored vegetables (red cabbage, red onion, etc.), and the values were 
very low in watery vegetables such as potato, marrow, and cucumber.

Two methods based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) using traditional cartridges 
and microelution SPE plates (muSPE) as the sample pre-treatment, and an improved 
liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) were 
developed and compared to determine the phenolic compounds in virgin oil olive 
from plasma samples. The phenolic compounds studied were hydroxytyrosol, 
tyrosol, homovanillic acid, p-coumaric acid, 3,4-DHPEA-EDA, p-HPEA-EDA, 
luteolin, apigenin, pinoresinol and acetoxypinoresinol. Good recoveries were 
obtained in both methods, and the LOQs and LODs were similar, in the range of 
low muM. The advantage of muSPE, in comparison with SPE cartridges, was the lack 
of the evaporation step to pre-concentrate the analytes. The 
muSPE-UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method developed was then applied to determine the phenolic 
compounds and their metabolites, in glucuronide, sulphate and methylated forms, 
in human plasma after the ingestion of virgin olive oil.

In this study, the effects of three common cooking practices (i.e., boiling, 
steaming, and frying) on the artichoke phenolic compounds pattern were evaluated 
by LC-MS/MS analysis. The variation of carotenoids, antioxidant capacity, and 
artichoke physical properties after cooking was also investigated. The major 
phenolic compounds present in the raw sample were 5- O-caffeoylquinic and 
1,5-di- O-caffeoylquinic acids; after cooking treatments, an increase of the 
overall caffeoylquinic acids concentration due to the formation of different 
dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers was observed. Steamed and fried samples showed 
similar patterns of dicaffeoylquinic concentrations, which were higher with 
respect to the boiled samples. On the other hand, all cooking practices, 
particularly frying, decreased flavonoid concentration. The antioxidant capacity 
of cooked artichokes, measured by three different assays, enormously increased 
after cooking, particularly after steaming (up to 15-fold) and boiling (up to 
8-fold). The observed cooking effect on the artichoke antioxidant profile is 
probably due to matrix softening and increased extractability of compounds, but 
the increase of antioxidant capacity is much higher than the increase of 
antioxidant concentration. These results suggest that some common cooking 
treatments can be used to enhance the nutritional value of vegetables, 
increasing bioaccessibility of health-promoting constituents.

Consumption of fruits and vegetables has been associated with reduced risk of 
chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Phytochemicals, 
especially phenolics, in fruits and vegetables are suggested to be the major 
bioactive compounds for the health benefits. However, the phenolic contents and 
their antioxidant activities in fruits and vegetables were underestimated in the 
literature, because bound phenolics were not included. This study was designed 
to investigate the profiles of total phenolics, including both soluble free and 
bound forms in common fruits, by applying solvent extraction, base digestion, 
and solid-phase extraction methods. Cranberry had the highest total phenolic 
content, followed by apple, red grape, strawberry, pineapple, banana, peach, 
lemon, orange, pear, and grapefruit. Total antioxidant activity was measured 
using the TOSC assay. Cranberry had the highest total antioxidant activity 
(177.0 +/- 4.3 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of fruit), followed by apple, red 
grape, strawberry, peach, lemon, pear, banana, orange, grapefruit, and 
pineapple. Antiproliferation activities were also studied in vitro using HepG(2) 
human liver-cancer cells, and cranberry showed the highest inhibitory effect 
with an EC(50) of 14.5 +/- 0.5 mg/mL, followed by lemon, apple, strawberry, red 
grape, banana, grapefruit, and peach. A bioactivity index (BI) for dietary 
cancer prevention is proposed to provide a new alternative biomarker for future 
epidemiological studies in dietary cancer prevention and health promotion.

BACKGROUND: Consumer demand for products rich in phytochemicals is increasing as 
a result of greater awareness of their potential health benefits. However, 
processed products are stored for long-term and the phytochemicals are 
susceptible to degradation during storage. The objective of this study was to 
assess the storage effects on phytochemicals in thermally processed blueberries. 
Thermally processed canned berries and juice/puree were analysed for 
phytochemicals during their long-term storage.
RESULTS: The phytochemical retention of thermally processed blueberries during 
storage was not influenced by production system (conventional versus organic). 
During 13 months of storage, total anthocyanins, total phenolics and total 
antioxidant activity in canned blueberry solids decreased by up to 86, 69 and 
52% respectively. In canned blueberry syrup, total anthocyanins and total 
antioxidant activity decreased by up to 68 and 15% respectively, while total 
phenolic content increased by up to 117%. Similar trends in phytochemical 
content were observed in juice/puree stored for 4 months. The extent of changes 
in phytochemicals of thermally processed blueberries during storage was 
significantly influenced by blanching.
CONCLUSION: Long-term storage of thermally processed blueberries had varying 
degrees of influence on degradation of total anthocyanins, total phenolics and 
total antioxidant activity. Blanching before thermal processing helped to 
preserve the phytochemicals during storage of blueberries.

The association of ferulic acid, an alkali-extractable phenolic acid in amaranth 
(Amaranthus caudatus L., Amaranthaceae) insoluble fiber (trans-ferulic acid: 620 
microg.g-1, cis-ferulic acid: 203 microg.g-1), and non-starch polysaccharides 
was investigated. Enzymatic hydrolysis of insoluble amaranth fiber released 
several feruloylated oligosaccharides that were separated using Sephadex 
LH-20-chromatography and reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography 
(RP-HPLC). Three compounds were unambiguously identified: 
O-(6-O-trans-feruloyl-beta-D-galactopyranosyl)-(1-->4)-D-galactopyranose, 
O-(2-O-trans-feruloyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl)-(1-->5)-L-arabinofuranose, and 
O-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl-(1-->3)-O-(2-O-trans-feruloyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl)-(1-->5)-L-arabinofuranose. 
These feruloylated oligosaccharides show that ferulic acid is predominantly 
bound to pectic arabinans and galactans in amaranth insoluble fiber. 
5-O-trans-Feruloyl-L-arabinofuranose was the only compound isolated in pure form 
from an acid hydrolyzate. This compound may have its origin from pectic 
arabinans but also from arabinoxylans.

Anthocyanins are present in human diet due to their wide occurrence in fruits 
and beverages. They possess antioxidant activities and could be involved in 
several health effects. The aim of this study was to investigate anthocyanin 
metabolism and distribution in the digestive area organs (stomach, jejunum and 
liver) and kidney, as well as a target tissue (brain) in rats fed with a 
blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.) anthocyanin-enriched diet for 15 days. 
Identification and quantification of anthocyanin metabolites was carried out by 
HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC-DAD, respectively. The stomach exhibited only native 
blackberry anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-pentose), while 
in other organs (jejunum, liver, and kidney) native and methylated anthocyanins 
as well as conjugated anthocyanidins (cyanidin and peonidin monoglucuronides) 
were identified. Proportions of anthocyanin derivatives differed according to 
the organ considered, with the liver presenting the highest proportion of 
methylated forms. Jejunum and plasma also contained aglycone forms. In the 
brain, total anthocyanin content (blackberry anthocyanins and peonidin 
3-O-glucoside) reached 0.25 +/- 0.05 nmol/g of tissue (n = 6). The urinary 
excretion of total anthocyanins was low (0.19 +/- 0.02% of the ingested amount). 
Thus, organs of the digestive area indicated a metabolic pathway of anthocyanins 
with enzymatic conversions (methylation and/or glucurono-conjugation). Moreover, 
following consumption of an anthocyanin-rich diet, anthocyanins enter the brain.

Physicochemical analysis of processed strained product was performed on 10 
carrot genotypes grown in Texas (TX) and Georgia (GA). Carrots from GA 
experienced hail damage during growth, resulting in damage to their tops. 
Measurements included pH, moisture, soluble phenolics, total carotenoids, 
sugars, organic acids, and isocoumarin (6-MM). Sensory analysis was conducted 
using a trained panel to evaluate relationships between chemical and sensory 
attributes of the genotypes and in carrots spiked with increasing levels of 
6-MM. Preharvest stress conditions in GA carrots seemed to elicit a phytoalexic 
response, producing compounds that impacted the perception of bitter and sour 
flavors. Spiking 6-MM into strained carrots demonstrated the role bitter 
compounds have in lowering sweetness scores while increasing the perception of 
sour flavor. Screening fresh carrots for the phytoalexin 6-MM has the potential 
to significantly improve the sensory quality of processed products.

This investigation evaluated the content and profile of flavanoid and phenolic 
acid compounds present in nine Vaccinium species that included domestic 
blueberry cultivars and sample collections from undomesticated colonies. The 
study was focused in two areas of inquiry. The first involved extracting and 
analyzing the berries for total phenolics (TPH), total anthocyanins (ACY), and 
the antioxidant capacity. Vaccinium species differ in their polyphenolic 
content, and these high TPH and ACY levels are correlated to their antioxidant 
capacity. Second, berry extracts were analyzed by high-performance liquid 
chromatography equipped with photodiode array and mass spectrometric detectors 
to determine the content and profile of selected bioactive compounds. The 
flavanoid analytes of interest included the anthocyanidins, flavan-3-ols, and 
flavonol aglycons, as well as specific phenolic acid components. This 
semicomprehensive analysis begins to characterize the phytochemical profiles and 
illustrates the differences in the content of polyphenolic compounds present 
within these Vaccinium species.

Curcumin, derived from the rhizome curcuma longa, is one of the primary 
ingredients in turmeric and curry powders that are used as spices in Middle 
Eastern and Asian countries, especially on the Indian subcontinent. More 
recently, laboratory studies have demonstrated that dietary curcumin exhibits 
various biological activities and significantly inhibits colon tumorigenesis and 
tumor size in animals. Curcumin displays both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant 
properties, giving it the potential to be considered in the development of 
cancer preventive strategies and applications in clinical research. Experimental 
studies have shown the biological activities of the compound, but much more 
information on pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and food content are needed. 
Whether the amount of curcumin in turmeric and curry powders is sufficient to 
suggest effects on biological activities and cancer risk is unknown. To 
determine and compare the quantitative amounts of curcumin that are present in 
several brands of turmeric and curry powders, a high performance liquid 
chromatography technique was used to analyze 28 spice products described as 
turmeric or curry powders and two negative controls. Pure turmeric powder had 
the highest curcumin concentration, averaging 3.14% by weight. The curry powder 
samples, with one exception, had relatively small amounts of curcumin present, 
and the variability in content was great. The curcumin content of these 
seasoning products that are consumed as a component of the diet should be 
considered in evaluating baseline tissue concentration and response to curcumin 
supplementation, which is under study in chemoprevention trials.

Phytoestrogens may play a role in hormone-related diseases such as cancer, but 
epidemiological and clinical data are conflicting in part due to inadequate 
databases used in intake estimation. A database of nine phytoestrogens in foods 
relevant to Western diets was developed to more accurately estimate intakes. 
Foods (N = 121) available in Ontario, Canada were prepared as commonly consumed 
and analyzed for isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, glycitein, formononetin), 
lignans (secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, pinoresinol, lariciresinol), and 
coumestan (coumestrol) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. Data 
were presented on an as is (wet) basis per 100 g and per serving. Food groups 
with decreasing levels of total phytoestrogens per 100 g are nuts and oilseeds, 
soy products, cereals and breads, legumes, meat products, and other processed 
foods that may contain soy, vegetables, fruits, alcoholic, and nonalcoholic 
beverages. Soy products contain the highest amounts of isoflavone, followed by 
legumes, meat products and other processed foods, cereals and breads, nuts and 
oilseeds, vegetables, alcoholic beverages, fruits, and nonalcoholic beverages. 
Decreasing amounts of lignans are found in nuts and oilseeds, cereals and 
breads, legumes, fruits, vegetables, soy products, processed foods, alcoholic, 
and nonalcoholic beverages. The richest sources of specific phytoestrogens, 
including coumestrol, were identified. The database will improve phytoestrogen 
intake estimation in future epidemiological and clinical studies particularly in 
Western populations.

Anthocyanins are the most abundant phenolic compounds, widely distributed in 
fruits and vegetables, and exhibit potent antioxidant capacity. Humans ingest a 
significant amount of anthocyanins in the daily diet. The objective of the 
current study was to examine human absorption and metabolism of black raspberry 
anthocyanins when administered at high doses (2.69 +/- 0.085 g/day). Ten healthy 
men consumed 45 g of freeze-dried black raspberries daily for 1 week. Urine 
samples were collected over a 12 h period in 4 h intervals at day 1 and day 7. 
Urinary anthocyanins were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography 
coupled to a photodiode array detector and a tandem mass spectrometer using 
precursor ion and product ion analyses. Anthocyanins were excreted in intact 
forms and metabolized into methylated derivatives in human urine. The urinary 
excretion of anthocyanins reached a maximum concentration (1091.8 +/- 1081.3 
pmol/L, n = 10) during the 4-8 h period after black raspberry ingestion. As 
compared to the anthocyanin distribution in black raspberries, urinary cyanidin 
3-xylosylrutinoside was detected at a higher concentration than that of 
cyanidin-3-rutinoside.

This study reports tannin contents of various tea (19), beer (6) and wine (6) 
samples, produced or sold in Turkey under different brand names. Determinations 
were carried out by employing a previously reported UV-vis spectrophotometric 
method. The standard addition procedure was also compared to the direct 
determination procedure and found to be more reliable. The tannin contents of 
hot water extracts of tea, tea bag and herbal tea samples ranged between 
6.20-8.33, 8.03-6.59 and 2.76-6.54 percent (w/w) respectively. Tannin contents 
of beer and wine samples determined without extraction were found ranging 
between 66.36-77.26 and 67.18-107.62 micrograms/mL respectively. Iron contents 
of analysed wine samples were also found ranging between 0.36 and 10.33 ppm by 
AAS and no relation is found between tannin and iron contents.

The phenolic compounds of 25 peach, nectarine, and plum cultivars were studied 
and quantified by HPLC-DAD-ESIMS. Hydroxycinnamates, procyanidins, flavonols, 
and anthocyanins were detected and quantified. White and yellow flesh nectarines 
and peaches, and yellow and red plums, were analyzed at two different maturity 
stages with consideration of both peel and flesh tissues. HPLC-MS analyses 
allowed the identification of procyanidin dimers of the B- and A-types, as well 
as the presence of procyanidin trimers in plums. As a general rule, the peel 
tissues contained higher amounts of phenolics, and anthocyanins and flavonols 
were almost exclusively located in this tissue. No clear differences in the 
phenolic content of nectarines and peaches were detected or between white flesh 
and yellow flesh cultivars. There was no clear trend in phenolic content with 
ripening of the different cultivars. Some cultivars, however, had a very high 
phenolic content. For example, the white flesh nectarine cultivar Brite Pearl 
(350-460 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 430-550 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) and 
the yellow flesh cv. Red Jim (180-190 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 210-330 mg/kg 
procyanidins in flesh), contained 10 times more phenolics than cultivars such as 
Fire Pearl (38-50 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 23-30 mg/kg procyanidins in 
flesh). Among white flesh peaches, cultivars Snow King (300-320 mg/kg 
hydroxycinnamates and 660-695 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) and Snow Giant 
(125-130 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 520-540 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) showed 
the highest content. The plum cultivars Black Beaut and Angeleno were especially 
rich in phenolics.

Cocoa is a food rich in polyphenols, mainly the flavonoid procyanidins and 
flavan-3-ols. The improvement of the cardiovascular function in humans upon 
cocoa consumption has been specifically linked to the presence of flavan-3-ol 
derived metabolites in plasma, especially epicatechin glucuronide. In this 
context, a flavonoid-enriched cocoa-derived product could potentially exert 
stronger health benefits. The aim of the present study was to obtain a cocoa 
powder with a higher flavonoid content (mainly enriched in monomer compounds) 
and assess its flavonoid bioavailability in humans. For this purpose, an 
unfermented, nonroasted, and blanch-treated cocoa powder (A) was obtained. The 
powder contained four times more procyanidins than a conventional (B) cocoa 
powder. Powder A contained eight times more epicatechin and procyanidin B2 than 
powder B. Cocoa milk drinks were prepared with powder A (MDA) and B (MDB). The 
bioavailability of flavonoids in both drinks was assessed in a crossover 
intervention with healthy volunteers. The content of epicatechin glucuronide, 
the main metabolite detected in plasma, was five-fold higher upon consumption of 
MDA as compared with MDB. The urinary excretion of metabolites, mainly methyl 
epicatechin sulfate, was higher upon MDA consumption as compared with MDB, 
ranging from two- to 12-fold higher depending on the metabolite. These results, 
together with previous reports regarding the cardiovascular benefits linked to 
the presence of procyanidin metabolites in plasma, suggest that further clinical 
trials to validate the health benefits of a flavonoid-enriched cocoa powder are 
warranted.

Consumption of flavonoid-rich foods and beverages is thought to reduce the risk 
of cardiovascular diseases. Whereas the biological activities of flavonoids have 
been characterized in vitro, there are no clear experimental data demonstrating 
that chronic dietary intake and intestinal absorption of flavonoids actually 
protects the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury. We tested whether 
long-term consumption of specific flavonoids (anthocyanins) included in normal 
food could render the heart of rats more resistant to myocardial infarction. 
Maize kernels that differed specifically in their accumulation of anthocyanins 
were used to prepare rodent food in which anthocyanins were either present or 
absent. Male Wistar rats were fed the anthocyanin-rich (ACN-rich) or the 
anthocyanin-free (ACN-free) diet for a period of 8 wk. Anthocyanins were 
significantly absorbed and detected in the blood and urine of only rats fed the 
ACN-rich diet. In Langendorff preparations, the hearts of rats fed the ACN-rich 
diet were more resistant to regional ischemia and reperfusion insult. Moreover, 
on an in vivo model of coronary occlusion and reperfusion, infarct size was 
reduced in rats that ate the ACN-rich diet than in those that consumed the 
ACN-free diet (P < 0.01). Cardioprotection was associated with increased 
myocardial glutathione levels, suggesting that dietary anthocyanins might 
modulate cardiac antioxidant defenses. Our findings suggest important potential 
health benefits of foods rich in anthocyanins and emphasize the need to develop 
anthocyanin-rich functional foods with protective activities for promoting human 
health.

Rats were fed a grape seed extract (GSE) containing (+)-catechin, 
(-)-epicatechin and dimers, trimers, tetramers and polymeric procyanidins. 
Liver, kidney, brain and gastrointestinal (GI) tract together with plasma, urine 
and faeces were collected over a 24 h period and their flavan-3-ol content was 
analysed by HPLC with tandem mass spectrometry and diode array detection. Small 
amounts of the GSE flavan-3-ols moved out of the stomach and into the 
duodenum/jejunum, and to a greater extent the ileum 1 h after ingestion, and 
into the caecum after 2 h with relatively small amounts being detected in the 
colon after 3 h. The GI tract contained the parent GSE flavan-3-ols and 
procyanidins with only trace amounts of metabolites and there were no 
indications that proanthocyanidins were depolymerised in the GI tract releasing 
monomeric flavan-3-ols. Plasma contained exclusively catechin glucuronides and 
methylated glucuronide metabolites which were also detected in the liver and 
kidneys. These metabolites were also present in urine together with sulphated 
metabolites and low amounts of the procyanidin dimers B1, B2, B3 and B4 as well 
as the trimer C2 and an unknown GSE trimer. The amounts of (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin metabolites excreted in urine relative to the quantity of the 
monomers ingested were 27 and 36 %, respectively, after 24 h. This is similar to 
the levels of urinary excretion reported to occur by other investigators after 
feeding (-)-epicatechin to rats and provides further, albeit indirect, evidence 
that the procyanidin oligomers in the GSE were not depolymerised to monomers to 
any extent after ingestion. No convincing analytical data were obtained for the 
presence of flavan-3-ol metabolites in the brain.

Polyphenolic compounds of apple may play an important role in physiologic 
functions related to human health. Different polyphenolics may have varied 
biological activities including antioxidant activity. The objective of this 
study was to investigate the profiles of polyphenolic compounds in different 
apple varieties and different parts of an apple. The total and individual 
polyphenolics differed significantly among the eight apple cultivars grown in 
Ontario, and the peels had higher concentrations than the flesh. Among the 
tested cultivars, Red Delicious and Northern Spy had the highest concentrations 
and Empire the lowest. Five major polyphenolic groups with a total of 16 
identified individual compounds were found, among which the dihydroxycinnamic 
acid esters, phloretin glycosides, and flavan-3-ols were found in both flesh and 
peel, whereas quercetin glycosides were almost exclusively found in the peel. 
Cyanidin 3-galactoside was unique to and found only in red apple peels. In both 
apple peel and flesh, the predominant group of polyphenolics was the 
procyanidins, followed by quercetin glycosides in the peel and hydroxycinnamic 
acid esters in the flesh. 3-Hydroxyphloretin 2'-xyloglucoside was newly 
identified in apple. The results obtained in this study will further the 
understanding of the polyphenolic composition of apples and their roles in 
health-promoting physiological functions.

We have clarified for the first time how cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside (C3G), 
which is a potent antioxidant anthocyanin, is absorbed and metabolized in vivo. 
Rats were orally administered C3G (0.9 mmol/kg body weight), and C3G rapidly 
appeared in the plasma. However, the aglycon of C3G (cyanidin; Cy) was not 
detected, although it was present in the jejunum. Protocatechuic acid (PC), 
which may be produced by degradation of Cy, was present in the plasma and the 
concentration was 8-fold higher than that of C3G. These results suggest that 
plasma PC and C3G may contribute to the antioxidant activity of the plasma. In 
the liver and kidney, C3G was metabolized to methylated C3G (methyl-C3G), 
suggesting that C3G and/or methyl-C3G act as antioxidants in the tissues.

The antioxidant activity of four honey samples from different floral sources 
(Acacia, Coriander, Sider and Palm) were evaluated with three different assays; 
DPPH free radical scavenging assay, superoxide anion generated in 
xanthine-xanthine oxidase (XOD) system and low density lipoprotein (LDL) 
peroxidation assay. The dark Palm and Sider honeys had the highest antioxidant 
activity in the DPPH assay. But all the honey samples exhibited more or less the 
same highly significant antioxidant activity within the concentration of 1mg 
honey/1 ml in XOD system and LDL peroxidation assays. The chemical composition 
of these samples was investigated by GC/MS and HPLC analysis, 11 compounds being 
new to honey. The GC/MS revealed the presence of 90 compounds, mainly aliphatic 
acids (37 compounds), which represent 54.73, 8.72, 22.87 and 64.10% and phenolic 
acids (15 compound) 2.3, 1.02, 2.07 and 11.68% for Acacia, Coriander, Sider and 
Palm honeys. In HPLC analysis, 19 flavonoids were identified. Coriander and 
Sider honeys were characterized by the presence of large amounts of flavonoids.

Hydroxytyrosol is quantitatively and qualitatively the principal phenolic 
antioxidant in olive oil. Recently it was shown that hydroxytyrosol and five 
metabolites were excreted in urine when hydroxytyrosol was dosed intravenously 
or orally in an olive oil solution to rats. The conclusive identification of 
three metabolites of hydroxytyrosol by MS/MS as a monosulfate conjugate, a 
3-O-glucuronide conjugate, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid 
(homovanillic acid) has been established in this investigation. The structural 
configurations of the glucuronide conjugate and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic 
acid were confirmed by (1)H NMR. The radical scavenging potencies of 
homovanillic acid, homovanillic alcohol, hydroxytyrosol, and the metabolites 
were examined with the radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. These studies 
showed them to be potent antioxidants with SC(50) values of 14.8 and 11.4 microM 
for homovanillic acid and homovanillic alcohol, respectively. The 
3-O-glucuronide conjugate was more potent than hydroxytyrosol, with an SC(50) of 
2.3 in comparison to 11.0 microM, and the monosulfate conjugate was almost 
devoid of radical scavenging activity.

The effect of fresh-cutting and subsequent cold storage on phenolic compounds 
from five long-term-stored potato cultivars (Agria, Cara, Liseta, Monalisa, and 
Spunta) was studied. Fresh-cutting induced the biosynthesis of three flavonols, 
which were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESIMS as quercetin 3-rutinoside, quercetin 
3-diglucoside, and quercetin 3-glucosylrutinoside. The flavonols were detected 
after a lag period of 3 days of cold storage. The content ranged from 6 to 14 
mg/100 g of fresh weight depending on the cultivar after 6 days of storage. 
Chlorogenic acid as the main caffeic acid derivative and the amino acids 
tyrosine and tryptophan were also quantified. The effect of cold storage under 
light or in dark was studied with new-season-harvested Monalisa potatoes. The 
flavonol induction was higher in fresh-cut potatoes stored under light than in 
the dark. However, caffeic acid derivatives were not affected. Domestic cooking 
such as boiling, microwaving, and frying provoked a partial loss of the 
flavonols, which were retained in the range of 4-16 mg per serving (213 g). 
Steam-cooking resulted in the highest retention of caffeic acid derivatives and 
aromatic amino acids compared with the other cooking methods studied. This means 
that due to the large amount of potatoes consumed in the Western diet, fresh-cut 
potatoes can be a significant source of health-promoting phenolics.

BACKGROUND: Nutritional biomarkers are alternatives to traditional dietary 
assessment tools. We sought to develop a method for nutritional analysis of 
resveratrol, a phenolic compound with purported health-promoting properties, and 
to determine all resveratrol metabolites.
METHODS: We obtained LDL and urine samples from 11 healthy male volunteers who 
had consumed 250 mL of Merlot red wine. We measured resveratrol and its 
metabolites with 96-well solid-phase extraction plates coupled with HPLC-tandem 
mass spectrometry. Hexestrol was used as the internal standard. Gradient 
chromatography in multiple reaction monitoring mode was performed on a Luna 
C(18) column, maintained at 40 degrees C; m/z transitions were as follows: 
resveratrol, 227/185; resveratrol glucosides, 389/227; resveratrol glucuronides, 
403/227; resveratrol sulfates, 307/227; taxifolin, 303/285; and hexestrol, 
269/134.
RESULTS: Standard calibration curves were linear at 4.4-3289.5 nmol/L. Residual 
analyses were 100% (3.2) for trans-resveratrol and 100% (11.1) for trans-piceid. 
In both matrices, imprecision (CV) was <10.8% at all concentrations. Detection 
limits for resveratrol were 0.2 nmol/L (LDL), 0.3 nmol/L (synthetic urine), and 
4.0 nmol/L (blank urine). Resveratrol and metabolites were checked for 
stability, and no degradation was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry method enabled us to identify 
resveratrol sulfates in human LDL and to characterize the complete profile of 
resveratrol metabolism in human LDL and urine. This method provides an accurate 
index of exposure to resveratrol and its metabolites, which can be used as 
nutritional biomarkers for evaluating the biological effects of moderate wine 
intake on human health.

When discovered in the 50's, isoflavones were suspected to provoke infertility 
syndrome in sheep grazing on clover. Many others effects of these phytoestrogens 
have been documented afterwards. To determine the distribution of isoflavone 
metabolites in ewe tissues and look for a link with their physiological impact, 
two ewes were fed a diet containing 50% red clover silage (variety Pawera) for 
one month with a daily intake of 157.6 mg/kg bw of total isoflavones. Only 
aglycones were fed due to the fermentation stage of the silage. At the 
sacrifice, isoflavone metabolites and aglycones were analyzed in blood, liver, 
kidney, lung, heart, muscle, ovaries, uterus, mammary glands, suprarenal glands, 
thymus, aorta, thyroid, pituitary gland, cerebellum, olfactory lobes, and brain 
hemispheres using HPLC-Coularray and LC-MS-MS. The major compounds recovered in 
tissues were equol and daidzein, present as glucuronides. Kidney concentrations 
were 10-fold higher than in other tissues. Penetration in brain was very 
limited. Reproductive organs contained higher concentrations of isoflavones than 
heart, muscle, or thymus. Distribution of isoflavones in ewe tissues is unequal 
and may reflect specific impact in some target tissues.

Proanthocyanidins, flavonoids exhibiting cardiovascular protection, constitute a 
major fraction of the flavonoid ingested in the human diet. Although they are 
poorly absorbed, they are metabolized by the intestinal microbiota into various 
phenolic acids. An analytical method, based on an optimized 96-well plate 
solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure and liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS) for the analysis of 19 phenolic microbial 
metabolites and monomeric and dimeric flavanols in urine samples, was developed 
and validated. Human urine samples were obtained before and after ingestion of 
an acute consumption of 40 g of soluble cocoa powder and rat urines before and 
after the prolonged administration (2 weeks) of different diets composed of 
natural cocoa powder. The mean recovery of analytes using the new SPE-LC-MS/MS 
method ranged from 87% to 109%. Accuracy ranged from 87.5% to 113.8%, and 
precision met acceptance criteria (<15% relative standard deviation). 
Procyanidin B2 has been detected and quantified for the first time in human and 
rat urine after cocoa consumption. Changes in human and rat urinary levels of 
microbial phenolic acids and flavanols were in the range of 0.001-59.43 nmol/mg 
creatinine and of 0.004-181.56 nmol/mg creatinine, respectively. Major 
advantages of the method developed include reduction of laboratory work in the 
sample preparation step by the use of 96-well SPE plates and the sensitive 
measurement of a large number of metabolites in a very short run time, which 
makes it ideal for use in epidemiological studies.

responsible for the numerous health effects associated with nut consumption. 
However, more bioavailability studies of nut skin polyphenols are needed to 
understand the health effects derived from nut consumption. The aim of the 
present study was to determine the profiles of both phase II and 
microbial-derived phenolic metabolites in plasma and urine samples before and 
after the intake of almond skin polyphenols by healthy human subjects (n = 2). 
Glucuronide, O-methyl glucuronide, sulfate, and O-methyl sulfate derivatives of 
(epi)catechin, as well as the glucuronide conjugates of naringenin and 
glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of isorhamnetin, were detected in plasma and 
urine samples after consumption of almond skin polyphenols. The main 
microbial-derived metabolites of flavanols, such as 
5-(dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 
5-(hydroxymethoxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, were also detected in their 
glucuronide and sulfate forms. In addition, numerous metabolites derived from 
further microbial degradation of hydroxyphenylvalerolactones, including 
hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, hydroxycinnamic, hydroxybenzoic, 
and hydroxyhippuric acids, registered major changes in urine after the 
consumption of almond skin polyphenols. The urinary excretion of these microbial 
metabolites was estimated to account for a larger proportion of the total 
polyphenol ingested than phase II metabolites of (epi)catechin, indicating the 
important role of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism of highly polymerized 
almond skin polyphenols. To the authors' knowledge this study constitutes the 
most complete report of the absorption of almond skin polyphenols in humans.

The biological properties of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) polyphenols are strictly 
dependent on their bioavailability. A long-term cocoa feeding trial was 
performed with subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Subjects (n=42) 
received two sachets of 20 g of cocoa powder/day with 250 mL of skimmed milk 
each, or only 500 mL/day of skimmed milk, both for two 4-week periods. The 
phenolic metabolic profile including phase II conjugated metabolites and 
phenolic acids derived from the intestinal microbiota was determined by LC-MS/MS 
in both 24-h urine and fasting plasma. The analysis of 24-h urine revealed 
significant increases of phase II metabolites, including glucuronides and 
sulfate conjugates of (-)-epicatechin, O-methyl-epicatechin, 
5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 
5-(3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, after regular cocoa intake. 
In the case of plasma, only glucuronide conjugates of 
dihydroxyphenylvalerolactones increased. Regular consumption of cocoa also 
resulted in a significant increase in the urinary excretion of colonic 
microbial-derived phenolic metabolites, including vanillic, 
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acids, and particularly 
5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, whereas only the two latter 
metabolites showed a significant increase in fasting plasma. The results found 
herein indicate that 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 
hydroxyphenylacetic acids could be good biomarkers of the regular consumption of 
cocoa and therefore, of flavanol-rich foods.

Health effects of cocoa flavonols depend on their bioavailability, which is 
strongly influenced by the food matrix and the degree of flavanol 
polymerization. The effect of milk on the bioavailability of cocoa flavanoids 
considering phase II metabolites of epicatechin has been the subject of 
considerable debate. This work studies the effect of milk at the colonic 
microbial metabolism level of the nonabsorbed flavanol fraction that reaches the 
colon and is metabolized by the colonic microbiota into various phenolic acids. 
Twenty-one human volunteers followed a diet low in polyphenols for at least 48 h 
before taking, in a random order, 40 g of cocoa powder dissolved either in 250 
mL of whole milk or in 250 mL of water. Urine samples were collected before the 
intake and during three different periods (0-6, 6-12, and 12-24 h). Phenolic 
acids were analyzed by LC-MS/MS after solid-phase extraction. Of the 15 
metabolites assessed, the excretion of 9 phenolic acids was affected by the 
intake of milk. The urinary concentration of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, 
protocatechuic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, 4-hydroxyhippuric, hippuric, caffeic, and 
ferulic acids diminished after the intake of cocoa with milk, whereas urinary 
concentrations of vanillic and phenylacetic acids increased. In conclusion, milk 
partially affects the formation of microbial phenolic acids derived from the 
colonic degradation of procyanidins and other compounds present in cocoa powder.

A reversed-phase HPLC procedure is proposed for the determination of seven 
flavonoids (luteolin, nepetin, hispidulin, jaceosidin, cirsimaritin, 
cirsilineol, and eupatorin) in vervain samples. A simple extractive technique 
was developed, involving only extraction with ethyl ether, which allowed the 
elimination of phenolic acids, yielding a sufficiently purified flavonoid 
fraction. All of the analyzed vervain samples showed a common flavonoid pattern, 
in which hispidulin and jaceosidin were the major compounds and nepetin was the 
minor compound.

Total aliphatic and indole glucosinolates, phenolic compounds (flavonoids and 
hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives), and vitamin C contents were evaluated in freshly 
harvested broccoli (Brassica oleracea L., var. italica, cv. Marathon) 
inflorescences. These were film-wrapped and stored for 7 days at 1 degrees C to 
simulate a maximum period of commercial transport and distribution. After cold 
storage, inflorescences were kept for 3 days at 15 degrees C to simulate a 
retail sale period. For wrapping, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) of 11 microm 
thickness was used. Gas composition was about 17% O(2) and 2% CO(2) during cold 
storage and about 16% O(2) and 3-4% CO(2) during shelf life within packages. The 
predominant glucosinolates were 4-methylsulfinylbutyl-glucosinolate 
(glucoraphanin), 3-indolylmethyl-glucosinolate (glucobrassicin), and 
1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl-glucosinolate (neoglucobrassicin). The predominant 
hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives were identified as 1,2,2'-trisinapoylgentiobiose, 
1,2-diferuloylgentiobiose, 1,2'-disinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose, and 
3-O-caffeoyl-quinic (neochlorogenic acid). Results showed major losses at the 
end of both periods, in comparison with broccoli at harvest. Thus, the 
respective losses, at the end of cold storage and retail periods, were 71-80% of 
total glucosinolates, 62-59% of total flavonoids, 51-44% of sinapic acid 
derivatives, and 73-74% caffeoyl-quinic acid derivatives. Slight differences in 
all compound concentrations between storage and retail sale periods were 
detected. Distribution and retail periods had minimal effects on vitamin C. 
Weight loss was monitored at the end of both periods.

Orange juice is a very rich source of dietary flavanones. The effect of 
flavanone concentration and solubility of orange beverages on their 
bioavailability has been studied in a crossover study with 10 healthy 
volunteers. Five different beverages with different flavanone concentrations 
were evaluated. Commercial orange juices (29.2-70.3 mg of flavanones/100 mL) 
were compared with experimental orange beverages in which the flavanone 
concentration was enhanced (110.2 mg/100 mL). Hesperetin and naringenin 
glucuronides and sulfates were detected and quantified in plasma and urine. The 
study shows that the solubility of the flavanones, and particularly that of 
hesperidin, in the juice is a key factor for the bioavailability as flavanone 
excretion and the C(max) in plasma correlate well with the soluble flavanone 
concentration in the juice, whereas it has no correlation with the total 
flavanone intake. In addition, a large interindividual variation was observed, 
this being consistent for each individual after the intake of the different 
beverages, suggesting that flavanone bioavailability is also dependent on the 
occurrence of specific microbiota that is able to remove the rutinosides from 
the juice glycosides, which results in aglycones that are then absorbed from the 
gut.

The effect of storage on the total polyphenol content and individual phenolic 
compounds as well as on the hydrophilic antioxidant capacity of ketchups and 
tomato juices was studied. The total polyphenol content was determined using the 
Folin-Ciocalteu assay, and the antioxidant capacity of the hydrophilic fraction 
was determined using DPPH and ABTS(+) assays. Individual polyphenols were 
identified and quantified using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization 
tandem mass spectrometry on a triple quadrupole. All analyses were carried out 
for ketchups and tomato juices after storage for 3, 6, and 9 months. The total 
polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity of the hydrophilic fraction 
decreased during storage of ketchups and tomato juices. Ketchups, in general, 
showed a slightly greater stability during storage than tomato juices. The most 
significant decrease was observed for quercetin followed by caffeic and ferulic 
acids, whereas glycosilated polyphenols showed greater stability during storage.

Tomatoes and tomato-based products are rich in antioxidants such as carotenoids, 
vitamin C and polyphenols. The industrial processing of diced tomatoes involves 
heat treatments in which these antioxidant compounds may be potentially 
affected. In this study, we evaluate the effect of each separate step in the 
dice-making process. Three technological processes were investigated: Hot, Cold 
and Cold treated with calcium salt (CaCl2). Four stages were monitored in each 
process: (1) fresh tomatoes; (2) peeled tomatoes; (3) diced tomatoes; and (4) 
final product after sauce addition. The main tool for minimising or 
counteracting the eventual processing damage was the strategy of 
'reconstitution', achieved by adding a sauce rich in seeds and peels with high 
levels of antioxidants and phenolics to the diced tomatoes. Different analyses 
were carried out in order to evaluate the effect of each processing step. First, 
total polyphenols (TP) were evaluated using Folin-Ciocalteau (F-C) assay and 
antioxidant activity using ABTS(+) and DPPH assays. Flavonols, flavanones, 
hydroxycinnamic and phenolic acids were then quantified using liquid 
chromatography/electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry 
(HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). The combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that each processing step induces 
alterations in the antioxidant and phenolic profile, and in particular sauce 
addition and calcium treatment significantly affected the levels of antioxidants 
and phenolics during the dice-making process.

Information on phyto-oestrogen intake in various populations has been scanty 
until now, primarily because data on the content of these compounds in foods 
were lacking. We report here on expansion of the Finnish National Food 
Composition Database (Fineli) with values for the plant lignans matairesinol and 
secoisolariciresinol and the isoflavones daidzein and genistein. The values, 
expressed as aglycones, were based on food analyses (mainly GC-MS) or imputed 
from analytical data for 180 foods for lignans and 160 foods for isoflavones; 
additionally, over 1000 values were derived from the recipe database of Fineli. 
Average intake of these phyto-oestrogens was calculated using food consumption 
data of the National Dietary Survey FINDIET 1997, which was carried out in a 
random sample of the adult population in five areas in Finland. The dietary data 
were collected by 24 h recall =2862). The mean lignan intake was 434 (standard 
deviation (SD) 1575) microg/d and the mean isoflavone intake was 788 (SD 673) 
microg/d. Women had a higher lignan density (microg lignans/MJ) in their diet 
than men (P<0.05). Men had a higher mean daily isoflavone intake, 902 (SD 368) 
microg, than women, 668 (SD 963) microg (P<0.05). The sources of lignans were 
many: seeds, cereals, fruit, berries and vegetables. The main sources of 
isoflavones appeared to be processed meat products/sausages containing soya as 
an ingredient, and legumes as such. The average intake of lignans and 
isoflavones in Finland seems to be low, but intake varies throughout the 
population.

The suitability of a simple and rapid isocratic RP-HPLC method with amperometric 
electrochemical detection for the simultaneous detection and quantification of 
hydroxycinnamic acids and their corresponding aroma-active volatile phenols in 
wort and beer is reported. The technique gives good specificity and sensitivity, 
and can therefore be used for routine monitoring of hydroxycinnamic acids in 
wort and the development of volatile phenolic flavour compounds during the beer 
production process and subsequent conservation.

Chestnut (Castanea sativa) is an important basic food in rural diets and a major 
starch crop used in a similar way to potatoes. Chestnuts are a fundamental 
economic resource in the ""chestnut regions"" not only for the fruit but also for 
the chestnut wood. Chestnuts have become increasingly important with respect to 
human health, for example, as an alternative gluten-free flour source. Chestnuts 
are also a rich source of other beneficial compounds, but there have been few 
studies on the composition during processing. In this study, we analyzed the 
chemical composition of three Portuguese cultivars at different stages of 
industrial processing. The chestnut cultivars were Longal, Judia, and Martaínha. 
All three cultivars had high moisture contents but were low in ash, crude fat, 
and crude protein contents, with high starch and low fiber contents. The free 
amino acid contents, including various essential amino acids, varied depending 
on the cultivar. All three cultivars also had a significant content of 
polyphenolics with gallic acid; ellagic acid was predominant among hydrolyzable 
and condensed tannins. Many of these compounds are known to exert significant 
positive effects on human health. The one-way analysis of variance for fresh 
chestnut shows significant differences among the three cultivars for most of the 
studied parameters. The same statistical analysis applied to each one of the two 
cultivars (Judia and Longal) sampled for the four processing steps analyzed 
indicates a significant effect of this factor in practically all of the 
constituents. On the other hand, the two-way analysis of variance shows that, 
besides the residual, the processing step and the interaction cultivar x 
processing step were the factors that more contributed for the total variation 
observed in the constituents analyzed, while the contribution of cultivar was 
much less significant.

Commercially important edible nut seeds were analyzed for chemical composition 
and moisture sorption. Moisture (1.47-9.51%), protein (7.50-21.56%), lipid 
(42.88-66.71%), ash (1.16-3.28%), total soluble sugars (0.55-3.96%), tannins 
(0.01-0.88%), and phytate (0.15-0.35%) contents varied considerably. Regardless 
of the seed type, lipids were mainly composed of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty 
acids (>75% of the total lipids). Fatty acid composition analysis indicated that 
oleic acid (C18:1) was the main constituent of monounsaturated lipids in all 
seed samples. With the exception of macadamia, linoleic acid (C18:2) was the 
major polyunsaturated fatty acid. In the case of walnuts, in addition to 
linoleic acid (59.79%) linolenic acid (C18:3) also significantly contributed 
toward the total polyunsaturated lipids. Amino acid composition analyses 
indicated lysine (Brazil nut, cashew nut, hazelnut, pine nut, and walnut), 
sulfur amino acids methionine and cysteine (almond), tryptophan (macadamia, 
pecan), and threonine (peanut) to be the first limiting amino acid as compared 
to human (2-5 year old) amino acid requirements. The amino acid composition of 
the seeds was characterized by the dominance of hydrophobic (range = 
37.16-44.54%) and acidic (27.95-33.17%) amino acids followed by basic 
(16.16-21.17%) and hydrophilic (8.48-11.74%) amino acids. Trypsin inhibitory 
activity, hemagglutinating activity, and proteolytic activity were not detected 
in the nut seed samples analyzed. Sorption isotherms (Aw range = 0.08-0.97) 
indicated a narrow range for monolayer water content (11-29 mg/g of dry matter). 
No visible mold growth was evident on any of the samples stored at Aw < 0.53 and 
25 degrees C for 6 months.

Midlothian.

Artificially dehydrated lucerne produced in the United Kingdom has been shown to 
be a better source of nutrients for horses than grass hay. Horses eat more 
lucerne when it is pelleted, and the processing has little effect on its 
nutritive value. Lucerne does not appear to contain any antinutritional factors 
of significance to horses. Lucerne contains readily available calcium and 
protein and can thus be used as a cereal-balancer or to upgrade poor quality 
roughages. Because lucerne is a good source of digestible nutrients it has 
therapeutic applications, including the correction of electrolyte imbalances and 
hoof horn problems, and it can be used for intragastric nutrition and for 
feeding old horses.

The free phenols have been measured in 15 lagers, 6 porters and ales, and 11 
light and nonalcoholic beers. Phenols were measured colorimetrically using an 
oxidation-reduction reaction with Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and catechin as the 
standard. The order of phenol concentration was ales > lagers > low calorie > 
nonalcoholic. The quality of antioxidants of the major phenols in beers and the 
quality of beer antioxidants were measured by (1) dose-response inhibition of 
lower density lipoprotein oxidation and (2) concentration of phenols in the 
beers at which 50% of the peroxide was destroyed in a luminescent assay for 
antioxidant activity. The beers' lipoprotein antioxidant quality was clearly 
superior to that of vitamin antioxidants and to that of the phenol ingredients, 
suggesting synergism among the antioxidants in the mixture. The average per 
capita consumption of beer in the United States in 2000 was 225 mL/day, 
equivalent to 42 mg/day of catechin equivalents. Beer provides more antioxidants 
per day than wine in the U.S. diet. A dark beer and a lager beer were given at 
two concentrations to cholesterol-fed hamsters, an animal model of 
atherosclerosis. At the high dose ((1)/(2)-diluted beer) both lager and dark 
beer significantly inhibited atherosclerosis compared to a control of 2% 
alcohol. At the high dose, lager significantly decreased cholesterol and 
triglycerides, and both beers acted as in vivo antioxidants by decreasing the 
oxidizability of lower density lipoproteins. At the low dose ((1)/(10)-diluted 
beer) only the lager beer significantly decreased atherosclerosis compared to 
the 0.4% alcohol control. The polyphenols in the beers appear to be responsible 
for the benefits of beer in this model. Lager beer inhibited atherosclerosis at 
a human equivalent dose in this hamster model of atherosclerosis.

Olive oil phenolic constituents have been shown, in vitro, to be endowed with 
potent biological activities including, but not limited to, an antioxidant 
action. To date, there is no information on the absorption and disposition of 
such compounds in humans. We report that olive oil phenolics, namely tyrosol and 
hydroxytyrosol, are dose-dependently absorbed in humans after ingestion and that 
they are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates. Furthermore, an 
increase in the dose of phenolics administered increased the proportion of 
conjugation with glucuronide.

Hydroxytyrosol is the most potent phenolic antioxidant of olive oil and olive 
mill waste water (OMWW) and its biological activities have stimulated research 
on its potential role in cardiovascular protection. However, evidence of the 
absorption of OMWW phenolics and on their possible in vivo activity has, until 
now, never been provided. Three groups male Sprague-Dawley rats were 
administered 1, 5, or 10 mg/Kg of the OMWW extract, respectively, providing 
41.4, 207, and 414 microg/Kg of hydroxytyrosol, respectively. Urine was 
collected for 24 h and the urinary levels of hydroxytyrosol were quantified by 
mass spectrometry. Hydroxytyrosol was dose-dependently (R(2) = 0.95) absorbed 
and excreted in the urines mostly as a glucuronide conjugate. Further, the 
administration of an hydroxytyrosol-rich OMWW extract (10 mg/kg) to the rats was 
also associated with an increase of their plasma antioxidant capacity. Future 
experiments will eventually further clarify its metabolic fate and its in vivo 
actions.

Interest in the in vivo biological activities of olive oil phenolics is rapidly 
growing, and different models and vehicles of administration are used worldwide. 
Matters of practicality determine the use of rats rather than humans as the 
model of choice. Also, growing interest in nutraceuticals is leading to the 
formulation of compounds containing olive oil phenols. In this study, we 
compared metabolism and urinary excretion of hydroxytyrosol [(HT), the most 
representative phenol of olive oil] between rats and humans by evaluating 
excretion of HT and its major metabolite, homovanillyl alcohol. Also, we 
compared human excretion of HT when consumed as a natural component of extra 
virgin olive oil, when added to refined olive oil, or when added to yogurt (as 
an approximation of functional food). Urinary excretion of HT was greater in 
humans than in rats, a species with a high basal excretion of HT and its 
metabolites. The high (234% of HT administered) excretion of free HT suggests 
that hydrolysis of oleuropein administered in humans (still an unresolved issue) 
occurs in vivo. Moreover, human HT excretion was much higher after its 
administration as a natural component of olive oil (44.2% of HT administered) 
than after its addition to refined olive oil (23% of HT administered) or yogurt 
(5.8% of dose or approximately 13% of that recorded after virgin olive oil 
intake). These data suggest that the rat is not the appropriate model for the 
study of HT metabolism and that HT-containing functional foods should be 
carefully formulated.

Many in vitro studies demonstrated significant biological effects of 
trans-resveratrol. Thus, understanding the rate of intestinal absorption and 
metabolization in vivo of trans-resveratrol is the prerequisite to evaluate its 
potential health impact. Bioavailability studies mainly in animals or in humans 
using the pure compound at very high doses were performed. In this work, 
trans-resveratrol bioavailability from a moderate consumption of red wine in 25 
healthy humans has been studied by three different experiments. The wine 
ingestion was associated to three different dietary approaches: fasting, a 
standard meal, a meal with high and low amount of lipids. Trans-resveratrol 3- 
and 4'-glucuronides were synthesized, purified, and characterized as pure 
standards. Bioavailability data were obtained by measuring the concentration of 
free, 3-glucuronide and 4'-glucuronide trans-resveratrol by high-performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC), both with ultraviolet (UV) and mass spectrometry 
(MS) detection, in serum samples taken at different times after red wine 
administration. Free trans-resveratrol was found, in trace amounts, only in some 
serum samples collected 30 min after red wine ingestion while after longer times 
resveratrol glucuronides predominated. Trans-resveratrol bioavailability was 
shown to be independent from the meal or its lipid content. The finding in human 
serum of trans-resveratrol glucuronides, rather than the free form of the 
compound, with a high interindividual variability, raises some doubts about the 
health effects of dietary resveratrol consumption and suggests that the benefits 
associated to red wine consumption could be probably due to the whole 
antioxidant pool present in red wine.

Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and 
development of atherosclerosis. Stilbenes have been shown to protect 
lipoproteins from oxidative damage and to have cancer chemopreventive activity. 
We describe a method for the direct determination of stilbenes in several red 
wines using high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. In a 
survey of 12 commercial wines from the south of Brazil (Rio Grande del Sul), 
levels of delta-viniferin are reported for the first time in different varieties 
of red wines. Brazilian red wine contains trans-astringin, trans-piceid, 
trans-resveratrol, cis-resveratrol (in high quantity: 5 times more than the 
trans form), epsilon-viniferin, and a compound isolated for the first time in 
wine, trans-delta-viniferin. Isolation and identification of delta-viniferin was 
achieved by NMR after extraction and fractionation of red wine phenolics. 
delta-Viniferin contributes, as well as cis-resveratrol and trans-piceid, to a 
significant proportion of stilbenes in wine dietary intake, particularly with 
Merlot varieties containing an average level of 10 mg/L for delta-viniferin, 15 
mg/L for cis-resveratrol, and 13 mg/L for trans-piceid. The total stilbene 
intake from wine origin was estimated for the Brazilian population as 5.3 mg/day 
per person (on the basis of a regular wine consumption of 160 mL/day). 
delta-Viniferin can contribute to around 20% of total stilbenes in wine (average 
of 6.4 mg/L in red Brazilian wines). It would be important in the future to 
investigate the origins of the differences in wine stilbene levels in relation 
to the vine varieties, and the bioavailability of the newly extracted stilbene 
delta-viniferin in plasma after consumption of different types of wines.

Forty-one apple samples, representing eight of the most widely cultivated 
varieties in western Europe, were collected in Trentino, Italy. Samples were 
extracted from fresh fruit with a mixture of acetone/water to achieve a good 
extraction of polyphenols, including proanthocyanidin oligomers which were 
analyzed by normal-phase HPLC. Up to 20 compounds including catechin, 
epicatechin, B2 procyanidin, hydroxycinnamates, flavonols, anthocyanins, and 
dihydrochalcones were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC and LC-MS. Total 
polyphenol content was independently measured with an optimized Folin-Ciocalteu 
assay. The mean content of total polyphenols lay between 66.2 and 211.9 mg/100 g 
of FW depending on the variety. With chromatographic analysis, it was possible 
to explain the whole amount of total polyphenols measured by the FC assay. 
Flavanols (catechin and proanthocyanidins) are the major class of apple 
polyphenols (71-90%), followed by hydroxycinnamates (4-18%), flavonols (1-11%), 
dihydrochalcones (2-6%), and in red apples anthocyanins (1-3%).

The amounts of myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol were analyzed in 16 red and 
2 white berry and grape wines after acid hydrolysis using an RP-HPLC method with 
diode array detection. The red berry wines analyzed were made mainly from black 
currant, crowberry, and bog whortleberry, i.e., berries rich in flavonols. The 
red grape wines were made mainly from Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot grapes in 
several countries. The white wines studied were gooseberry and white currant 
wines and Chardonnay and Riesling wines. The amount of myricetin ranged from 3.8 
to 22.6 mg L(-1) in red berry wines and from 0 to 14.6 mg L(-1) in red grape 
wines. The amount of quercetin was from 2.2 to 24.3 mg L(-1) red berry wines and 
from <1.2 to 19.4 mg L(-1) in red grape wines. Low levels of kaempferol were 
found in all red berry wines and in 9 red grape wines. The total concentration 
of these flavonols was from 6 to 46 mg L(-1) (mean 20 mg L(-1)) in red berry 
wines and from 4 to 31 mg L(-1) (mean 15 mg L(-1)) in red grape wines. Small 
amounts of quercetin were found in white currant and gooseberry wines, whereas 
no flavonols were detected in white grape wines. These results demonstrate that

Brassica vegetables are the predominant dietary source of glucosinolates (GLS) 
that can be degraded in the intestinal tract into isothiocyanates, which have 
been shown to possess anticarcinogenic properties. The effects of pilot-scale 
long-term boiling on GLS in white cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. ssp. capitata f. 
alba cv. 'Bartolo') was experimentally determined and mathematically modeled. 
Cabbage was boiled, resulting in a dramatic decrease of 56% in the total GLS 
levels within the plant matrix during the first 2 min. After 8-12 min of 
boiling, the decrease progressed to over 70%. Progoitrin had an exceptionally 
higher decline rate in comparison to all other GLS. As boiling progressed the 
concentration of all GLS continued to decrease at a lower rate for the remaining 
cooking period. A mathematical model was used to describe the concentration 
profile of the GLS in the plant matrix, based on leaching of GLS to the water 
phase due to cell lysis and thermal degradation of the GLS both in the plant 
matrix and in the water phase. The model described the concentration profiles 
very well. Estimated lysis and degradation rate constants for white cabbage 
differed from those reported in the literature for red cabbage. The degradation 
rate constants found were significantly higher in the plant matrix when compared 
to those in the water phase for all GLS. Identification of the kinetics of 
decline of GLS during cooking can aid in designing processing and preparation 
methods and determining the conditions for the optimal effects of ingestion of 
Brassicaceae toward cancer prevention.

Five types of caneberries [evergreen blackberries (Rubus laciniatus), 
marionberries (Rubus ursinus), boysenberries (Rubus ursinus x idaeus), red 
raspberries (Rubus idaeus), and black raspberries (Rubus occidentalis)] were 
analyzed for antioxidant activity by measuring their oxygen radical absorbance 
capacity (ORAC). In addition, the berries were analyzed for total phenolics, 
anthocyanins, procyanidins, and ellagic acid content. All of the berries had 
high ORAC activity ranging from 24 to 77.2 micromol of Trolox equiv/g of fresh 
berries. Anthocyanin content ranged from 0.65 to 5.89 mg/g, and phenolics ranged 
from 4.95 to 9.8 mg/g. Black raspberries had the highest ORAC and anthocyanin 
and phenolic contents. Only red raspberries had detectable amounts of 
procyanidin oligomers (monomer, dimers, and trimers). All berries had high 
levels of ellagic acid (47-90 mg/g), but boysenberries had the highest level 
prior to hydrolysis. The results from this study indicate that these caneberries 
were high in antioxidant activity and were rich sources of anthocyanins and 
phenolics.

The dietary polyphenol resveratrol has been shown to have chemopreventive 
activity against cardiovascular disease and a variety of cancers in model 
systems, but it is not clear whether the drug reaches the proposed sites of 
action in vivo after oral ingestion, especially in humans. In this study, we 
examined the absorption, bioavailability, and metabolism of 14C-resveratrol 
after oral and i.v. doses in six human volunteers. The absorption of a dietary 
relevant 25-mg oral dose was at least 70%, with peak plasma levels of 
resveratrol and metabolites of 491 +/- 90 ng/ml (about 2 microM) and a plasma 
half-life of 9.2 +/- 0.6 h. However, only trace amounts of unchanged resveratrol 
(<5 ng/ml) could be detected in plasma. Most of the oral dose was recovered in 
urine, and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis identified three 
metabolic pathways, i.e., sulfate and glucuronic acid conjugation of the 
phenolic groups and, interestingly, hydrogenation of the aliphatic double bond, 
the latter likely produced by the intestinal microflora. Extremely rapid sulfate 
conjugation by the intestine/liver appears to be the rate-limiting step in 
resveratrol's bioavailability. Although the systemic bioavailability of 
resveratrol is very low, accumulation of resveratrol in epithelial cells along 
the aerodigestive tract and potentially active resveratrol metabolites may still 
produce cancer-preventive and other effects.

Fruits and leaves from different cultivars of thornless blackberry (Rubus sp.), 
red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.), black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis L.), and 
strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa D.) plants were analyzed for total antioxidant 
capacity (oxygen radical absorbance capacity, ORAC) and total phenolic content. 
In addition, fruits were analyzed for total anthocyanin content. Blackberries 
and strawberries had the highest ORAC values during the green stages, whereas 
red raspberries had the highest ORAC activity at the ripe stage. Total 
anthocyanin content increased with maturity for all three species of fruits. 
Compared with fruits, leaves were found to have higher ORAC values. In fruits, 
ORAC values ranged from 7.8 to 33.7 micromol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g of 
fresh berries (35. 0-162.1 micromol of TE/g of dry matter), whereas in leaves, 
ORAC values ranged from 69.7 to 182.2 micromol of TE/g of fresh leaves 
(205.0-728.8 micromol of TE/g of dry matter). As the leaves become older, the 
ORAC values and total phenolic contents decreased. The results showed a linear 
correlation between total phenolic content and ORAC activity for fruits and 
leaves. For ripe berries, a linear relationship existed between ORAC values and 
anthocyanin content. Of the ripe fruits tested, on the basis of wet weight of 
fruit, cv. Jewel black raspberry and blackberries may be the richest source for 
antioxidants. On the basis of the dry weight of fruit, strawberries had the 
highest ORAC activity followed by black raspberries (cv. Jewel), blackberries, 
and red raspberries.

The influence of four day/night growing temperature combinations (18/12, 25/12, 
25/22, and 30/22 degrees C) on phenolic acid, flavonol, and anthocyanin content 
and their antioxidant activities against peroxyl radicals (ROO(*)), superoxide 
radicals (O(2)(*)(-)), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), hydroxyl radicals (OH(*)), 
and singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) in fruit juice of Earliglow and Kent strawberry 
(Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) cultivars was studied. Pelargonidin-based 
anthocyanins such as pelargonidin 3-glucoside (291.3-945.1 microg/g fresh wt.), 
pelargonidin 3-rutinoside (24.7-50.9 microg/g fresh wt.), and pelargonidin 
3-glucoside-succinate (62.2-244.0 microg/g fresh wt.) were the predominant 
anthocyanins in strawberry fruit juice. The content of cyanidin-based 
anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, was much 
lower than that of pelargonidin-based anthocyanins. Strawberry growth in high 
temperature conditions significantly enhanced the content of p-coumaroylglucose, 
dihydroflavonol, quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin 3-glucuronide, kaempferol 
3-glucoside, kaempferol 3-glucuronide, cyanidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 
3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, and 
pelargonidin 3-glucoside-succinate in strawberry juice. Plants grown in the cool 
day and cool night temperature (18/12 degrees C) generally had the lowest 
phenolic acid, flavonols, and anthocyanins. An increase in night temperature 
from 12 to 22 degrees C, with the day temperature kept constant at 25 degrees C, 
resulted in a significant increase in phenolic acid, flavonols, and 
anthocyanins. These conditions also resulted in a significant increase in 
antioxidant capacity. The highest day/night temperature (30/22 degrees C) 
yielded fruit with the most phenolic content as well as ROO(*), O(2)(*)(-), 
H(2)O(2), OH(*), and (1)O(2) radical absorbance capacity. Fruit of Kent cv. 
strawberry had higher values of phenolic acid, flavonols, anthocyanins, and 
antioxidant capacities than fruit of Earliglow cv. strawberry under all 
temperature regimes.

Cultural system [hill plasticulture (HC) versus matted row (MR)] and genotype 
interactions affected strawberry fruit quality. In general, fruit soluble solids 
content, total sugar, fructose, glucose, ascorbic acid, titratable acid, and 
citric acid contents were increased in the HC system. Fruit from HC also had 
higher flavonoid contents and antioxidant capacities. Strawberry fruit contains 
flavonols as well as other phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins and phenolic 
acids. Pelargonidin-based anthocyanins such as pelargonidin 3-glucoside, 
pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside-succinate were the 
predominant anthocyanins in strawberry fruit. The content of cyanidin-based 
anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, was much 
lower than that of pelargonidin-based anthocyanins in either system. Strawberry 
fruit from the HC system had significantly higher amounts of p-coumaroylglucose,

A rapid, sensitive and specific isocratic liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method was developed for the simultaneous quantitative 
determination of magnesium lithospermate B (MLB), rosmarinic acid (RA), and 
lithospermic acid (LA) in beagle dog serum, with silibinin as internal standard. 
The serum samples were treated by liquid-liquid extraction and analyzed using 
LC/MS/MS with a TurboIonSpray source. A short run-time (3 min) fulfilled the 
need for monitoring serum levels of MLB, RA, and LA in large-scale studies. The 
calibration curves for MLB, RA, and LA were linear over the ranges 8-2048, 
4-1024, and 4-1024 ng/mL, respectively, with coefficients of correlation >0.999. 
The intra- and inter-day precision (CV) of analysis was <10%, and accuracy 
ranged from 90-104%. This quantitation method was successfully applied to a 
pharmacokinetic study of salvianolate administrated by intravenous infusion with 
dosage of 6 mg/kg in beagle dogs.

To identify the major metabolites of resveratrol in rat, rat urine samples were 
pretreated by using solid-phase extraction technique (SPE) with polyamide 
cartridges. And a LC-MS/MS method with electrospray ionisation (ESI), negative 
ion mode and collision induced dissociation (CID), was used to elucidate the 
structures of the major metabolites of resveratrol. According to the results of 
our experiment, we found that the main metabolites of resveratrol were 
resveratrol monoglucuronide (M1), dihydroresveratrol monosulfate (M2), 
resveratrol monosulfate (M3) and dihydroresveratrol (M4).

PURPOSE: Polygonum cuspidatum extract as a traditional Chinese medicine is 
extracted from the dried rhizome and root of Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb.et Zucc. 
Resveratrol is one of its active components. Studies were performed in rats to 
define the tissue distribution and excretion of resveratrol in urine and bile, 
and to characterize (if possible) any metabolites of resveratrol observed in 
tissues after ig 20mg/kg Polygonum cuspidatum extract.
METHOD: For tissue distribution studies, tissues (300 mg) were homogenized and 
centrifuged with methanol, and metabolites found in selected tissue extract were 
identified by LC/MS/MS. For urinary and biliary excretion experiments, urine and 
bile samples were cleaned up by using solid-phase extraction (SPE) with 
polyamide cartridges. All the concentrations of resveratrol in these biological 
samples were determined by HPLC with UV detection.
RESULT: After a single oral dose of 20mg/kg PCE in rats, resveratrol was mainly 
distributed in stomach, duodenum, liver and kidney with detectable metabolites 
resveratrol monoglucuronide and resveratrol monosulfate. The majority of the 
resveratrol was excreted as metabolites, only 0.59% and 0.027% of the dosage 
were excreted in urine and bile respectively as unchanged drug within 24h.

To take advantage of the various pharmacologic activities of soy bean 
isoflavones, more detailed studies of the absorption and excretion rates of 
these compounds in humans and subsequent evaluation of their bioavailabilities 
are required. We conducted a pharmacokinetic study of soybean isoflavones in 
seven healthy male volunteers. After ingestion of 60 g of kinako (baked soybean 
powder, containing 103 micromol daidzein and 112 micromol genistein), changes of 
the isoflavone and metabolite concentrations in plasma, urine and feces were 
measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The plasma concentration of 
genistein increased after 2 h and reached its highest value of 2.44 +/- 0.65 
micromol/L 6 h later. The plasma concentration of daidzein peaked at 1.56 +/- 
0.34 micromol/L at the same time, but it was always lower than that of 
genistein. Peak plasma concentration of O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) and equol 
appeared after the daidzein peak in four and two subjects, respectively. In 
contrast with plasma, daidzein was the main component in urine. Urinary daidzein 
excretion started to increase shortly after the rise in its plasma concentration 
and reached 2.4 micromol/h 8 h after ingestion of kinako. Genistein excretion in 
urine paralleled that of daidzein, but the value at 6 h was about half (1.1 
micromol/h). The majority of ingested isoflavones after ingestion of kinako were 
recovered on d 2 or 3 in the feces. Total recovery of daidzein, O-DMA and equol 
from urine and feces was 54.7%, calculated from daidzein intake; 20.1% of 
administered genistein was recovered as genistein. The half-lives of plasma 
genistein and daidzein were 8.36 and 5.79 h, respectively. The individual plasma 
and urinary concentrations of equol and O-DMA were quite variable; subjects were 
classified as high and low metabolizers. The high plasma concentration of 
isoflavones for at least several hours after a single ingestion of soy protein 
suggests that these compounds may interact with macromolecules and have 
biological effects.

Solid-phase microextraction coupled GC/MS was investigated for the determination 
of 2,4-dinitrophenol in aqueous sample. Analytes were extracted by a 85 microns 
polyacrylate coated fiber. The fiber was then transferred into the injector of 
GC. Analytes were thermally desorbed and detected by GC/MS. The influences of 
several parameters on SPME procedure have been studied. The optimization 
condition was obtained: directly sampling in the water sample with the 
extraction period was 30 min and the desorption time 3 min at 270 degrees C. 
Acidification by hydrochloric acid (pH 2) and saturated salt were necessary for 
the best sensitivity. The precision of SPME is better than that of liquid-liquid 
extraction. This method is a fast, simple, and pre-concentration-free technique, 
which is suitable for detecting 2,4-dinitrophenol in water sample.

The antioxidant activity of roasted coffee residues was evaluated. Extraction 
with four solvents (water, methanol, ethanol, and n-hexane) showed that water 
extracts of roasted coffee residues (WERCR) produced higher yields and gave 
better protection for lipid peroxidation. WERCR showed a remarkable protective 
effect on oxidative damage of protein. In addition, WERCR showed scavenging of 
free radicals as well as the reducing ability and to bind ferrous ions, 
indicating that WERCR acts as both primary and secondary antioxidants. The HPLC 
analyses showed that phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid) and 
nonphenolic compounds [caffeine, trigonelline, nicotinic acid, and 
5-(hydroxymethyl)furfuraldehyde] remained in roasted coffee residues. These 
compounds showed a protective effect on a liposome model system. The 
concentrations of flavonoids and polyphenolic compounds in roasted coffee 
residues were 8,400 and 20,400 ppm, respectively. In addition, the Maillard 
reaction products (MRPs) remaining in roasted coffee residues were believed to 
show antioxidant activity. These data indicate that roasted coffee residues have 
excellent potential for use as a natural antioxidant source because the 
antioxidant compounds remained in roasted coffee residues.

The consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains rich in antioxidative 
phytochemicals is associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as 
cancer, coronary heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, cataract, and 
aged-related functional decline. For example, phenolic acids are among the main 
antioxidative phytochemicals in grains that have been shown to be beneficial to 
human health. Corn (Zea mays L.) is a major staple food in several parts of the 
world; thus, the antioxidant activity of several corn types was evaluated. The 
2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl free radical (DPPH*) scavenging activity, total 
phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant capacity of lipid-soluble substances (ACL), 
oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and phenolic acid compositions of 
typical and mutant genotypes (typical-1, waxy, typical-2, and high-amylose) were 
investigated. The DPPH* scavenging activity at 60 min was 34.39-44.51% in 
methanol extracts and 60.41-67.26% in HCl/methanol (1/99, v/v) extracts of corn. 
The DPPH* scavenging activity of alkaline hydrolysates of corn ranged from 48.63 
to 64.85%. The TPC ranged from 0.67 to 1.02 g and from 0.91 to 2.15 g of ferulic 
acid equiv/kg of corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. The 
TPC of alkaline hydrolysates ranged from 2.74 to 6.27 g of ferulic acid equiv/kg 
of corn. The ACL values were 0.41-0.80 and 0.84-1.59 g of Trolox equiv/kg of 
corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. The ORAC values were 
10.57-12.47 and 18.76-24.92 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn in methanol and 
HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. ORAC values of alkaline hydrolysates ranged 
from 42.85 to 68.31 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn. The composition of phenolic 
acids in alkaline hydrolysates of corn was p-hydroxybenzoic acid (5.08-10.6 
mg/kg), vanillic acid (3.25-14.71 mg/kg), caffeic acid (2.32-25.73 mg/kg), 
syringic acid (12.37-24.48 mg/kg), p-coumaric acid (97.87-211.03 mg/kg), ferulic 
acid (1552.48-2969.10 mg/kg), and o-coumaric acid (126.53-575.87 mg/kg). Levels 
of DPPH* scavenging activity, TPC, ACL, and ORAC in HCl/methanol extracts were 
obviously higher than those present in methanol extracts. There was no 
significant loss of antioxidant capacity when corn was dried at relatively high 
temperatures (65 and 93 degrees C) postharvest as compared to drying at ambient 
temperatures (27 degrees C). Alkaline hydrolysates showed very high TPC, ACL, 
and ORAC values when compared to methanol and HCl/methanol extracts. 
High-amylose corn had a better antioxidant capacity than did typical (nonmutant) 
corn genotypes.

Crude extracts of evening primrose meal were prepared in 56% (v/v) acetone and 
separated into six fractions (I-VI) using a Sephadex LH-20 column. Qualitative 
tests for phenolic and vanillin positive compounds produced positive results for 
all fractions. Silica gel thin-layer chromatography of fractions III and V 
allowed the location and isolation of two spots containing moderate to strong 
antioxidative compounds. High-performance liquid chromatography of the spot 
isolated from fraction III showed the resolution of two structurally related 
compounds, whereas that of the spot from fraction V showed the presence of one 
compound. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electron impact mass 
spectrometry produced sufficient evidence to identify the isolated compounds as 
(+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and gallic acid. These compounds accounted for 
about 10.5 and 1.7% of the dry mass of the crude extracts and meal, 
respectively.

The lipophilic character of quercetin suggests that it can cross enterocyte 
membranes via simple diffusion. Therefore, it should be more bioavailable than 
its glucosides, which require preliminary hydrolysis or active transport for 
absorption. However, the published human studies show that quercetin is less 
bioavailable than its glucosides. Assuming that low bioavailability of quercetin 
aglycone provided to humans as a pure substance is the result of its low 
solubility in the digestive tract, we studied its bioavailability from dietary 
sources in which quercetin was dispersed in the food matrix. In a randomized 
crossover study, 9 volunteers took a single dose of either shallot flesh (99.2% 
quercetin glucosides and 0.8% quercetin aglycone) or dry shallot skin (83.3% 
quercetin aglycone and 16.7% quercetin glucosides), providing 1.4 mg quercetin 
per kg of body weight. Blood samples were collected before and after consumption 
of shallot preparations. Plasma quercetin was measured on HPLC with 
electrochemical detection after plasma enzymatic treatment. The maximum plasma 
quercetin concentration of 1.02 +/- 0.13 micromol/L was reached at 2.33 +/- 0.50 
h after shallot flesh consumption compared with 3.95 +/- 0.62 micromol/L at 2.78 
+/- 0.15 h after dry skin consumption. The area under the concentration-time 
curve after dry skin consumption was 47.23 +/- 7.53 micromol x h(-1) x L(-1) and 
was significantly higher than that after shallot flesh intake (22.23 +/- 2.32 
micromol x h(-1) x L(-1)). When provided along with dietary sources, quercetin 
aglycone is more bioavailable than its glucosides in humans. Results point to 
the food matrix as a key factor.

BACKGROUND: Little information is currently available on the role of the gut 
microflora in modulating isoflavone bioavailability or on sex differences in 
isoflavone metabolism and bioavailability.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether chronic soy consumption influences 
isoflavone bioavailability as judged by plasma isoflavone concentrations and 
modified gut microflora activities [beta-glucoside hydrolysis and equol and 
O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) production]. We also examined whether sex 
differences in isoflavone metabolism exist.
DESIGN: A randomized, parallel, controlled study design was used to compare a 
high-soy diet (104 +/- 24 mg total isoflavones/d) with a low-soy diet (0.54 +/- 
0.58 mg total isoflavones/d) in 76 healthy young adults for 10 wk.
RESULTS: Concentrations of isoflavones and their gut microflora metabolites in 
the plasma, urine, and feces were significantly higher in the subjects who 
consumed the high-soy diet than in those who consumed the low-soy diet. 
Concentrations of O-DMA in plasma and urine were higher in the men than in the 
women. Fecal bacteria from subjects consuming both diets could convert daidzein 
to equol ex vivo. Fecal beta-glucosidase activity was significantly higher in 
the subjects who consumed the high-soy diet than in those who consumed the 
low-soy diet.
CONCLUSIONS: Although interindividual variation in isoflavone metabolism was 
high, intraindividual variation was low. Only concentrations of O-DMA in plasma 
and urine appeared to be influenced by sex. Chronic soy consumption does not 
appear to induce many significant changes to the gut metabolism of isoflavones 
other than higher beta-glucosidase activity.

Neurohormonal activation involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and 
adrenergic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems is integral to 
stressor state-mediated homeostatic responses. The levels of effector hormones, 
depending upon the degree of stress, orchestrate the concordant appearance of 
hypokalemia, ionized hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, hypozincemia, and 
hyposelenemia. Seemingly contradictory to homeostatic responses wherein the 
constancy of extracellular fluid would be preserved, upregulation of 
cognate-binding proteins promotes coordinated translocation of cations to 
injured tissues, where they participate in wound healing. Associated 
catecholamine-mediated intracellular cation shifts regulate the equilibrium 
between pro-oxidants and antioxidant defenses, a critical determinant of cell 
survival. These acute and chronic stressor-induced iterations in extracellular 
and intracellular cations are collectively referred to as the cation crossroads. 
Intracellular cation shifts, particularly excessive accumulation of Ca2+, 
converge on mitochondria to induce oxidative stress and raise the opening 
potential of their inner membrane permeability transition pores (mPTPs). The 
ensuing loss of cationic homeostasis and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 
production, together with osmotic swelling, leads to organellar degeneration and 
cellular necrosis. The overall impact of iterations in extracellular and 
intracellular cations and their influence on cardiac redox state, cardiomyocyte 
survival, and myocardial structure and function are addressed herein.

Relationships Between Blueberry Flower Age, Pollination, and Conidial Infection 
by Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi.

Ngugi HK, Scherm H, Lehman JS.

ABSTRACT Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi infects open blueberry flowers via the 
gynoecial pathway, leading to mummification of the developing fruit. To 
determine the effect of flower age on infection, stigmata were inoculated with 
conidia of M. vaccinii-corymbosi between 0 and 5 days after anthesis, fungal 
growth rates through the stylar canal were measured in detached flowers in the 
laboratory, and fruit disease incidence was determined in plants grown in the 
greenhouse. Hyphal growth rates were greatest in flowers inoculated on the day 
of anthesis, declined linearly with increasing flower age at inoculation (r = 
0.921; P < 0.0001; n = 12), and were unaffected by the presence or absence of 
pollen applied at the time of inoculation. In greenhouse-grown plants, the 
percentage of infected fruit decreased exponentially with increasing flower age 
at inoculation (R = 0.878; P = 0.0057; n = 10), with disease incidence ranging 
from 76.4% for flowers inoculated on the day of anthesis to 15.5% for those 
inoculated 4 days later. Fruit disease incidence in the greenhouse was linearly 
correlated with hyphal growth rates in detached flowers (r = 0.985; P < 0.0001; 
n = 9), justifying the use of detached flowers when investigating gynoecial 
infection by M. vaccinii-corymbosi. In separate experiments, the effects of 
timing and sequence of pollination and inoculation on hyphal growth rates 
through the stylar canal and on disease incidence were investigated. Application 
of pollen to detached flowers 1 or 2 days before inoculation reduced hyphal 
growth rates by between 14.0 and 42.9% compared with flowers that received 
pollen and conidia simultaneously. Similarly, reductions in fruit disease 
incidence by between 9.5 and 18.3% were observed on greenhouse-grown plants for 
pollination-to-inoculation intervals ranging from 1 to 4 days. These results 
document that newly opened flowers are most susceptible to infection by M. 
vaccinii-corymbosi and that fruit disease incidence is reduced if pollination 
occurs at least 1 day before inoculation. Strategies that lead to early 
pollination of newly opened flowers may be useful for managing mummy berry 
disease in the field.

Anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins were characterized by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS coupled 
with a diode array and/or fluorescent detector in seven cultivars of Ribes 
nigrum (black currant) and Ribes rubrum (red currant, Red Lake), six cultivars 
of Ribes grossularia (gooseberries), Aronia melanocarpa(chokeberry), and 
Sambucus nigra (elderberry). Thirty-one different anthocyanins were detected in 
these berries, but not every anthocyanin was observed in each berry. A number of 
minor anthocyanins were identified from these berries for the first time. The 
concentrations of individual anthocyanins in all of the berries were quantified 
using relevant anthocyanidin 3-glucoside standards. Among the berries studied in 
this paper and in berries in general, chokeberry has the highest total 
anthocyanin concentrations [1480 mg/100 g of fresh weight (FW)], whereas the 
lowest total anthocyanin concentration in the berries studied was found in the 
gooseberry cv. Careless, which contained only 0.07 mg/100 g of FW. Two cultivars 
of gooseberries (Marigold and Leveller) did not contain any anthocyanins. Total 
proanthocyanidin concentrations in the berries studied ranged from 23 to 664 
mg/100 g of FW in elderberry and chokeberry, respectively. Procyanidin or 
prodelphinidin polymers were the predominant components (>65% w/w) in most of 
the berries. The lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities were measured 
by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC(FL)) procedure. The total 
antioxidant capacity varied from 21 micromol of TE/g of FW in Careless 
gooseberry to 161 micromol of TE/g of FW in chokeberry. Total phenolics in the 
berries in general paralleled hydrophilic antioxidant capacity.

Weaning pigs (7.9 +/- 1.7 kg) were fed a freeze-dried powder of marionberry (MB) 
by stomach tube to study the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins. Four 
major anthocyanins (ACNs) were found in MB: cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-glc, 
78%), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (Cy-3-rutin, 20%), pelargonidin-3-glucoside 
(Pg-3-glc, 0.4%), and 1 unknown acylated cyanidin-based ACN (UACy, 1.5%). In the 
urine, the 4 original ACNs and 11 metabolites were identified and quantified. 
The main metabolites were glucuronidated and/or methylated forms of the original 
anthocyanins. Total recovery of the 4 original ACNs plus their related 
metabolites was 0.087 +/- 0.034% for Cy-3-glc, 0.084 +/- 0.026% for Cy-3-rutin, 
0.583 +/- 0.229% for Pg-3-glc and 0.036 +/- 0.011% for UACy (mean +/- SD, n = 
3), respectively. For the individual ACNs, the amount of metabolites recovered 
from Cy-3-rutin was lower than that of the original intact Cy-3-rutin, whereas 
the amounts of metabolites from Cy-3-glc and Pg-3-glc in the urine were much 
higher than their original forms. In pig plasma, the 2 original ACNs, Cy-3-glc 
and Cy-3-rutin, and a trace of 1 metabolite (cyanidin monoglucuronide) were 
detected. The plasma concentration:dose ratio of Cy-3-rutin was higher than that 
of Cy-3-glc. Different aglycones and/or sugar moieties may influence the 
absorption and metabolism of ACNs. Cy-3-glc and Cy-3-rutin had similar apparent 
excretion rates relative to dose, whereas Pg-3-glc had a much higher total 
urinary excretion than cyanidin-based anthocyanins. Most of Cy-3-glc and 
Pg-3-glc were excreted in the form of metabolites, whereas most of the 
Cy-3-rutin was excreted in its original unmetabolized form. Urinary recovery of 
the acylated anthocyanin was lower than that of nonacylated anthocyanins.

Both lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities were determined using the 
oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC(FL)) assay with fluorescein as the 
fluorescent probe and 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride as a peroxyl 
radical generator on over 100 different kinds of foods, including fruits, 
vegetables, nuts, dried fruits, spices, cereals, infant, and other foods. Most 
of the foods were collected from four different regions and during two different 
seasons in U.S. markets. Total phenolics of each sample were also measured using 
the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. Hydrophilic ORAC(FL) values (H-ORAC(FL)) ranged 
from 0.87 to 2641 micromol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g among all of the foods, 
whereas lipophilic ORAC(FL) values (L-ORAC(FL)) ranged from 0.07 to 1611 
micromol of TE/g. Generally, L-ORAC(FL) values were <10% of the H-ORAC(FL) 
values except for a very few samples. Total antioxidant capacity was calculated 
by combining L-ORAC(FL) and H-ORAC(FL). Differences of ORAC(FL) values in fruits 
and vegetables from different seasons and regions were relatively large for some 
foods but could not be analyzed in detail because of the sampling scheme. Two 
different processing methods, cooking and peeling, were used on selected foods 
to evaluate the impact of processing on ORAC(FL). The data demonstrated that 
processing can have significant effects on ORAC(FL). Considering all of the 
foods analyzed, the relationship between TP and H-ORAC(FL) showed a very weak 
correlation. Total hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant capacity intakes were 
calculated to be 5558 and 166 micromol of TE/day, respectively, on the basis of 
data from the USDA Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994-1996).

To investigate the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins (ACNs) with 
different aglycones and sugar moieties, weanling pigs (11.4 +/- 3.8 kg) were 
fed, in a single meal, a freeze-dried powder of chokeberry, black currant, or 
elderberry at a single dose of 229, 140, or 228 mumol total ACN/kg body weight 
(BW), respectively. These berries provided ACNs with differences in aglycone as 
well as some unique differences in the sugar moieties. The relative proportions 
of the different metabolites depended upon concentrations, quantities consumed, 
and types of glycoside of ACNs in the berry. Delphinidin ACNs were not 
metabolized to any measurable extent. Cyanidin ACNs were metabolized via 
methylation and glucuronidation as well as by formation of both derivatives on 
the same ACN molecule. ACNs with either a di- or trisaccharide attached to them 
were excreted in the urine primarily as the intact form. Over 80% of the ACN 
compounds containing rutinose or sambubiose, which were excreted in the urine 
from black currant, elderberry, or Marion blackberry, were excreted as the 
intact molecule. The limited metabolism of these ACNs that did occur was via 
methylation. ACN monoglycosides other than the glucoside were metabolized via 
methylation and/or glucuronide formation. The monoglucuronide that formed 
represented a small proportion of the metabolites relative to the methylated or 
the mixed methylated and glucuronide forms of ACNs. The data clearly demonstrate 
that the aglycone and the sugar moieties can alter the apparent absorption and 
metabolism of ACNs.

Breviscapine, is the total flavonoid components (the content of scutellarin > or 
=85%) extracted from the dried whole plant of Erigeron breviscapus (VANT.) 
HAND.-MAZZ, and its preparations are generally used in the clinic for the 
treatment of cerebral and cardio-vascular diseases in China. In this paper, the 
metabolites of breviscapine in the urine of rats after oral administration were 
investigated. The ten metabolites were isolated by open-column chromatography 
and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography, and their structures 
were elucidated by MS, NMR spectroscopy including (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, and NOESY 
(nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy), enzymatic hydrolysis and chemical 
evidence. The ten metabolites were identified as 
scutellarein-6,7-di-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-1), scutellarein (M-2), 
6-O-methyl-scutellarin (M-3), 6-O-methyl-scutellarein (M-4), 
scutellarein-6-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-5), scutellarein-5-O-beta-D-glucuronide

apigenin-5-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-9), and apigenin-4'-O-beta-D-glucuronide 
(M-10) respectively. The results of this study indicated that the metabolites of 
brevisvapine were excreted in rats urine as glucuronidated, sulfated or 
methylated forms, as well as the aglycone of scutellarin-scutellarein after oral 
administration, and the metabolic pathways were also proposed.

Isoflavones and lignans are soy phytoestrogens that have been suggested to be 
anticarcinogenic. The mechanisms by which they exert cancer-preventive effects 
may involve modulation of estrogen synthesis and metabolism. To evaluate this 
hypothesis, a randomized, cross-over soy isoflavone feeding study was performed 
in 12 healthy premenopausal women. The study consisted of three diet periods, 
each separated by a washout of approximately 3 weeks. Each diet period lasted 
for three menstrual cycles plus 9 days (averaging approximately 100 days), 
during which subjects consumed their habitual diets supplemented with soy 
protein powder providing 0.16 (control diet), 1.01, or 2.01 mg of total 
isoflavones per kg of body weight per day (10+/-1.1, 65+/-9.4, or 129+/-16 
mg/day, respectively). A 72-h urine sample was collected during the 
midfollicular phase (days 7-9) of the fourth menstrual cycle in each diet 
period. Urine samples were analyzed for 10 phytoestrogens and 15 endogenous 
estrogens and their metabolites by a capillary gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry method. Urinary excretion of isoflavonoids and lignans 
significantly increased with increased isoflavone consumption. Compared with the 
control diet, increased isoflavone consumption decreased urinary excretion of 
estradiol, estrone, estriol, and total estrogens, as well as excretion of the 
hypothesized genotoxic estrogen metabolites, 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, 
4-hydroxyestrone, and 4-hydroxyestradiol. Of importance are the observations of 
a significant increase in the 2-hydroxyestrone/16alpha-hydroxyestrone ratio and 
a decrease in the genotoxic/total estrogens ratio. These data suggest that soy 
isoflavone consumption may exert cancer-preventive effects by decreasing 
estrogen synthesis and altering metabolism away from genotoxic metabolites 
toward inactive metabolites.

Isoflavones are soy phytoestrogens that have been suggested to be 
anticarcinogenic. Our previous study in premenopausal women suggested that the 
mechanisms by which isoflavones exert cancer-preventive effects may involve 
modulation of estrogen metabolism away from production of potentially 
carcinogenic metabolites [16alpha-(OH) estrone, 4-(OH) estrone, and 4-(OH) 
estradiol] (X. Xu et al., Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev., 7: 1101-1108, 1998). 
To further evaluate this hypothesis, a randomized, cross-over soy isoflavone 
feeding study was performed in 18 healthy postmenopausal women. The study 
consisted of three diet periods, each separated by a washout of approximately 3 
weeks. Each diet period lasted for 93 days, during which subjects consumed their 
habitual diets supplemented with soy protein isolate providing 0.1 (control), 1, 
or 2 mg isoflavones/kg body weight/day (7.1 +/- 1.1, 65 +/- 11, or 132 +/- 22 
mg/day). A 72-h urine sample was collected 3 days before the study (baseline) 
and days 91-93 of each diet period. Urine samples were analyzed for 10 
phytoestrogens and 15 endogenous estrogens and their metabolites by a capillary 
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Compared with the soy-free baseline 
and very low isoflavone control diet, consumption of 65 mg isoflavones increased 
the urinary 2/16alpha-(OH) estrone ratio, and consumption of 65 or 132 mg 
isoflavones decreased excretion of 4-(OH) estrone. When compared with baseline 
values, consumption of all three soy diets increased the ratio of 2/4-(OH) 
estrogens and decreased the ratio of genotoxic: total estrogens. These data 
suggest that both isoflavones and other soy constituents may exert 
cancer-preventive effects in postmenopausal women by altering estrogen 
metabolism away from genotoxic metabolites toward inactive metabolites.

To profile absorption of Astragali Radix decoction and identify its orally 
absorbable constituents and their metabolites, four complementary in silico, in 
vitro, and in vivo methods, i.e., a computational chemistry prediction method, a 
Caco-2 cell monolayer model experiment, an improved rat everted gut sac 
experiment, and a healthy human volunteer experiment, were used. According to 
the in silico computation result, 26 compounds of Astragali Radix could be 
regarded as orally available compounds, including 12 flavonoids. In the in vitro 
and in vivo experiments, 21 compounds were tentatively identified by 
high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ion 
trap tandem mass spectrometry data, which involved calycosin, formononetin, 
(6aR,11aR)-3-hydroxy-9,10-dimethoxypterocarpan, 
7,2'-dihydroxy-3',4'-dimethoxyisoflavan, calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside, 
formononetin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside, 
7,2'-dihydroxy-3',4'-dimethoxyisoflavan-7-O-beta-D-glucoside-6''-O-malonate, 
(6aR,11aR)-3-hydroxy-9,10-dimethoxypterocarpan-3-O-beta-D-glucoside, and phase 
II metabolites calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide, 
formononetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide, 
(6aR,11aR)-3-hydroxy-9,10-dimethoxypterocarpan-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide, 
7,2'-dihydroxy-3',4'-dimethoxyisoflavan-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide, and calycosin 
sulfate. Calycosin and formononetin were proved absorbable by four methods; 
(6aR,11aR)-3-hydroxy-9,10-dimethoxypterocarpan and 
7,2'-dihydroxy-3',4'-dimethoxyisoflavan were proved absorbable by three methods; 
formononetin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside and 
(6aR,11aR)-3-hydroxy-9,10-dimethoxypterocarpan-3-O-beta-D-glucoside were proved 
absorbable by two methods. The existence of calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide, 
formononetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide, 
(6aR,11aR)-3-hydroxy-9,10-dimethoxypterocarpan-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide, 
7,2'-dihydroxy-3',4'-dimethoxyisoflavan-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide, and calycosin 
sulfate was proved by two or three methods. We found that besides isoflavones, 
pterocarpans and isoflavans also could be metabolized by the intestine during 
absorption, and the major metabolites were glucuronides. In conclusion, the 
present study demonstrated that the flavonoids in Astragali Radix decoction, 
including isoflavones, pterocarpans, and isoflavans, could be absorbed and 
metabolized by the intestine. These absorbable compounds, which were reported to 
have various bioactivities related to the curative effects of Astragali Radix 
decoction, could be regarded as an important component of the effective 
constituents of Astragali Radix decoction.

The effects of soaking, boiling and steaming processes on the total phenolic 
components and antioxidant activity in commonly consumed cool season food 
legumes (CSFL's), including green pea, yellow pea, chickpea and lentil were 
investigated. As compared to original unprocessed legumes, all processing steps 
caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH free 
radical scavenging activity (DPPH) in all tested CSFL's. All soaking and 
atmospheric boiling treatments caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in oxygen 
radical absorbing capacity (ORAC). However, pressure boiling and pressure 
steaming caused significant (p<0.05) increases in ORAC values. Steaming 
treatments resulted in a greater retention of TPC, DPPH, and ORAC values in all 
tested CSFL's as compared to boiling treatments. To obtain cooked legumes with 
similar palatability and firmness, pressure boiling shortened processing time as 
compared to atmospheric boiling, resulted in insignificant differences in TPC, 
DPPH for green and yellow pea. However, TPC and DPPH in cooked lentils differed 
significantly between atmospheric and pressure boiling. As compared to 
atmospheric processes, pressure processes significantly increased ORAC values in 
both boiled and steamed CSFL's. Greater TPC, DPPH and ORAC values were detected 
in boiling water than that in soaking and steaming water. Boiling also caused 
more solid loss than steaming. Steam processing exhibited several advantages in 
retaining the integrity of the legume appearance and texture of the cooked 
product, shortening process time, and greater retention of antioxidant 
components and activities.

The effects of soaking, boiling, and steaming processes on the phenolic 
components and antioxidant activity of black beans were investigated. All 
processed beans exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) lower antioxidant activities 
than raw beans in total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH free radical scavenging 
activity (DPPH), and oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC). Steaming 
processes resulted in a greater retention of TPC and ORAC values than the 
boiling processes. Pressure boiling shortened processing time compared to 
regular boiling, resulted in insignificant differences in TPC, but significantly 
increased in ORAC as compared to the regular boiling method. Pressure steaming 
resulted in significant decreases in TPC, DPPH, while significantly increased in 
ORAC compared to regular steaming. Greater TPC, DPPH, and ORAC values were 
detected in boiling water than in the soaking and steaming water. Mass balance 
analysis showed that boiling caused more dry solid loss than steaming. All of 
these results indicated that processing methods significantly changed contents 
and activities of antioxidant components of black beans. Steam processing 
exhibited several advantages in appearance and texture of the cooked product, 
shortening processing time, and in greater retention of TPC and antioxidant 
activities. Steam processing may be used to develop high-quality 
health-promoting black bean products.

Epidemiological studies have indicated that the consumption of fruits and 
vegetables is associated with a reduced risk for the development of chronic 
diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Phytochemicals, including 
phenolics and flavonoids, are suggested to be the major bioactive compounds 
contributing to the health benefits of fruits and vegetables. Onions are a major 
source of dietary flavonoids; however, there may exist varietal differences in 
composition, concentration, and beneficial activities. To characterize these 
differences, shallots and 10 onion (Allium cepa L.) varieties commonly available 
in the United States (Western Yellow, Northern Red, New York Bold, Western 
White, Peruvian Sweet, Empire Sweet, Mexico, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley Sweet, 
and Vidalia) were evaluated for total phenolic and flavonoid contents and 
antioxidant and antiproliferative activities. Shallots contained the highest 
total phenolic content (114.7 +/- 10.0 mg/100 g of sample) among the varieties 
tested, with a 6-fold difference observed when compared to the variety with the 
lowest phenolic content (Vidalia, p < 0.05). Western Yellow onion variety 
exhibited the highest total flavonoid content (69.2 +/- 3.7 mg/100 g of onion) 
of the varieties tested, with an 11-fold difference when compared to the variety 
with the lowest flavonoid content (Western White, p < 0.05). Shallots exhibited 
the highest total antioxidant activity (45.5 +/- 2.1 micromol of vitamin C 
equiv/g of onion), followed by Western Yellow, New York Bold, Northern Red, 
Mexico, Empire Sweet, Western White, Peruvian Sweet, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley 
Sweet, and Vidalia. For all varieties, both total phenolic and flavonoid 
contents were strongly correlated with total antioxidant activity (R (2) = 
0.9668, p < 0.05; and R (2) = 0.7033, p < 0.05, respectively). The proliferation 
of HepG(2) and Caco-2 cells was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent 
fashion after exposure to the Western Yellow, shallots, New York Bold, and 
Northern Red extracts, with Western Yellow, shallots, and New York Bold 
exhibiting the highest antiproliferative activity against HepG(2) cells and New 
York Bold and Western Yellow exhibiting the highest antiproliferative activity 
against Caco-2 cells. However, the varieties of Western White, Peruvian Sweet, 
Empire Sweet, Mexico, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley Sweet, and Vidalia 
demonstrated weak antiproliferative activity against both HepG(2) and Caco-2 
cells. These results may influence consumers toward purchasing onion varieties 
exhibiting greater potential health benefits and may significantly affect future 
breeding efforts to enhance onion nutritional qualities.

To explore the metabolism of 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (1,5-DCQA) in rats, 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in parallel to diode-array detection was 
used for the rapid detection/characterization of the metabolites formed in bile, 
urine, and plasma of rats following oral administration of 1,5-DCQA (160 mg/kg). 
The methylation and glucuronidation of 1,5-DCQA occurring in vitro using rat 
liver and small intestinal microsomes and cytosols were studied in comparison 
with those occurring in vivo, and the enzymes involved were also determined. In 
addition, the anti-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) activity of three 
important metabolites was preliminarily evaluated in MT-4 cells infected with 
HIV-1. A total of 22 metabolites in vivo and in vitro were identified, including 
four isomeric O-mono-methylated metabolites (M8-M11), nine isomeric 
O-di-methylated metabolites (M3, M6, M22, and M12-M17), four isomeric 
O-mono-methyl-glucuronidated metabolites (M2 and M19-M21), four isomeric 
O-di-methyl-glucuronidated metabolites (M1, M4, M5, and M7), and one 
glucuronidated metabolite (M18). The O-methylation positions of three important 
metabolites (M8, M9, and M12) were determined (3''-, 3'-, and 3',3''-) by 
comparing with synthesized standards. The efficacy experiments showed that M8, 
M9, and M12 could inhibit HIV replication with IC(50) values of about 25, 25, 
and 46 microM, respectively. These results suggest that O-methylation and 
glucuronidation are two important metabolic pathways of 1,5-DCQA, that both rat 
liver and small intestine can catalyze such reactions by 
catechol-O-methyltransferase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and that the 
HIV-1 inhibitory activity of M8, M9, and M12 is comparable to or slightly weaker 
than that of 1,5-DCQA.

Naringenin chalcone is the main active component of tomato skin extract, which 
has an antiallergic activity. In this study, naringenin chalcone was orally 
administered to rats, and the chemical structures and levels of the major 
metabolites in the plasma and urine of rats were determined. HPLC analysis 
indicated the presence of three major metabolites in the urine. LC-MS and NMR 
analyses tentatively identified these as naringenin 
chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide, naringenin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide, and 
naringenin-4'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Naringenin chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide 
was the only metabolite detected in the plasma, and its peak plasma level was 
observed 1 h after naringenin chalcone administration. Naringenin 
chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide also inhibited histamine release from rat 
peritoneal mast cells stimulated with compound 48/80. This activity might 
contribute to the antiallergic activity of naringenin chalcone in vivo. To the 
best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to report determination 
of naringenin chalcone metabolites in rat plasma and urine.

Fruit and vegetable intake is inversely correlated with risks for several 
chronic diseases in humans. Phytochemicals, and in particular, phenolic 
compounds, present in plant foods may be partly responsible for these health 
benefits through a variety of mechanisms. Since environmental factors play a 
role in a plant's production of secondary metabolites, it was hypothesized that 
an organic agricultural production system would increase phenolic levels. 
Cultivars of leaf lettuce, collards, and pac choi were grown either on 
organically certified plots or on adjacent conventional plots. Nine prominent 
phenolic agents were quantified by HPLC, including phenolic acids (e. g. caffeic 
acid and gallic acid) and aglycone or glycoside flavonoids (e. g. apigenin, 
kaempferol, luteolin, and quercetin). Statistically, we did not find significant 
higher levels of phenolic agents in lettuce and collard samples grown 
organically. The total phenolic content of organic pac choi samples as measured 
by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, however, was significantly higher than 
conventional samples (p < 0.01), and seemed to be associated with a greater 
attack the plants in organic plots by flea beetles. These results indicated that 
although organic production method alone did not enhance biosynthesis of 
phytochemicals in lettuce and collards, the organic system provided an increased 
opportunity for insect attack, resulting in a higher level of total phenolic 
agents in pac choi.

Virgin olive oils produced at wide ranges of malaxation temperatures (15, 30, 
45, and 60 degrees C) and times (30, 60, 90, and 120 min) in a complete 
factorial experimental design were discriminated with stepwise linear 
discriminant analysis (SLDA) revealing differences with processing conditions. 
Virgin olive oils produced at 15 and 60 degrees C for 30 min showed the most 
significant (p < 0.01) differences. Discrimination was based upon volatile and 
phenolic compounds detected in olive oils, peroxide value (PV), free fatty acids 
(FFA), ultraviolet (UV) absorbances, and oil yield. There were different 
discriminating variables for processing conditions illustrating the dependence 
of virgin olive oil quality on malaxation time and temperature. Volatile 
compounds were the dominant discriminating variables. Common oxidation 
indicators of olive oil (PV, K232, and K270) were not among the variables that 
significantly (p < 0.01) changed with malaxation time and temperature. Variables 
that discriminated both malaxation time and temperature were hexanal, 
3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ethyl alcohol-decarboxymethyl elenolic acid dialdehyde 
(3,4-DHPEA-DEDA) and FFA, whereas 1-penten-3-ol, E-2-hexenal, octane, tyrosol, 
and vanillic acid significantly (p < 0.01) changed with temperature only and 
Z-2-penten-1-ol, (+)-acetoxypinoresinol, and oil yield changed with time only. 
Virgin olive oil quality was significantly influenced by malaxation temperature, 
whereas oil yield discriminated malaxation time. This study demonstrates the two 
modes of hexanal formation: enzymatic and nonenzymatic during virgin olive oil 
extraction.

PURPOSE: Resveratrol, a phenolic phytoalexin occurring in grapes, wine, peanuts, 
and cranberries, has been reported to have anticarcinogenic, antioxidative, 
phytoestrogenic, and cardioprotective activities. Because little is known about 
the metabolism of this potentially important compound, the in vitro and in vivo 
metabolism of trans-resveratrol were investigated.
METHODS: The in vitro experiments included incubation with human liver 
microsomes, human hepatocytes, and rat hepatocytes and the in vivo studies 
included oral or intraperitoneal administration of resveratrol to rats and mice. 
Methanol extracts of rat urine, mouse serum, human hepatocytes, rat hepatocytes, 
and human liver microsomes were analyzed for resveratrol metabolites using 
reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with on-line 
ultraviolet-photodiode array detection and mass spectrometric detection 
(LC-DAD-MS and LC-UV-MS-MS). UV-photodiode array analysis facilitated the 
identification of cis- and trans-isomers of resveratrol and its metabolites. 
Negative ion electrospray mass spectrometric analysis provided molecular weight 
confirmation of resveratrol metabolites and tandem mass spectrometry allowed 
structural information to be obtained.
RESULTS: No resveratrol metabolites were detected in the microsomal incubations, 
and no phase I metabolites, such as oxidations, reductions, or hydrolyzes, were 
observed in any samples. However, abundant trans-resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide and 
trans-resveratrol-3-sulfate were identified in rat urine, mouse serum, and 
incubations with rat and human hepatocytes. Incubation with beta-glucuronidase 
and sulfatase to release free resveratrol was used to confirm the structures of 
these conjugates. Only trace amounts of cis-resveratrol were detected, 
indicating that isomerization was not an important factor in the metabolism and 
elimination of resveratrol.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that trans-resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide and 
trans-resveratrol-3-sulfate are the most abundant metabolites of resveratrol. 
Virtually no unconjugated resveratrol was detected in urine or serum samples, 
which might have implications regarding the significance of in vitro studies 
that used only unconjugated resveratrol.

The composition of phenolic acids in several small berries grown in Northeastern 
Poland, namely, low-bush blueberries, black mulberries, European juneberries, 
black currants, fruits of blue-berried honeysuckle, and blackberries, was 
determined by gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS). The total 
content of phenolic acids, identified by GC-MS, ranged from 2845.8 +/- 141.0 
(black mulberries) to 5418.2 +/- 228.0 (blue-berried honeysuckle). Twenty 
phenolic acids were identified in the berries. Of these, hydroxycaffeic, m- and 
p-coumaric, and 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acids were the major phenolic acids in 
blackberries and blueberries, m-coumaric acid was the major phenolic acid in 
blue-berried honeysuckle and black currant fruits, while salicylic, caffeic, and 
m- and p-coumaric acids were the predominant phenolic acids in European 
juneberries. Syringic and veratric acids were detected only in blueberries, 
while p-hydroxybenzoic and sinapic acids were present only in black currants and 
o-coumaric acid was present in blueberries and black mulberries. The phenolic 
acids liberated from esters and glycosidic bonds were the major fractions of 
phenolic acids in the berries.

From red raspberries, ellagic acid, its 4-arabinoside, its 4' (4' '-acetyl) 
arabinoside, and its 4' (4' '-acetyl)xyloside, as well as quercetin and 
kaempferol 3-glucosides, were identified. In addition, two unidentified ellagic 
acid derivatives were detected. The free radical scavenging activity of the 
ellagic acid derivatives was evaluated by using the DPPH method and compared to 
that of Trolox. All of the isolated compounds showed antioxidant activity. The 
effect of processing to obtain jams on raspberry phenolics was evaluated. The 
flavonol content decreased slightly with processing and more markedly during 
storage of the jams. The ellagic acid derivatives, with the exception of ellagic 
acid itself, remained quite stable with processing and during 6 months of jam 
storage. The content of free ellagic acid increased 3-fold during the storage 
period. The initial content (10 mg/kg of fresh weight of raspberries) increased 
2-fold with processing, and it continued increasing up to 35 mg/kg after 1 month 
of storage of the jam. Then a slight decrease was observed until 6 months of 
storage had elapsed. The increase observed in ellagic acid could be explained by 
a release of ellagic acid from ellagitannins with the thermal treatment.

Polyphenol content, free radical scavenging capacity, and changes during storage 
over 7 months in the dark were studied in ecological and conventional red and 
white wines. In red wines, the most changeable components during storage were 
the anthocyanins since during storage anthocyanins content decreased 88% in 
conventional wine and 91% in ecological wine. Initially, the total flavonol 
contents of the conventional and ecological red wines were 163.88 +/- 2.69 and 
153.58 +/- 1.71 mg/L, respectively, and no significant variations occurred 
during storage. No differences in hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives content 
between conventional and ecological red and white wines were observed. The 
flavonol level in white wines was very low, as expected since these compounds 
are found in grape skin. The initial antioxidant activity was 5.37 +/- 0.14 and 
5.82 +/- 0.31 mM equivalents Trolox for conventional and ecological red wines, 
respectively; no significant differences were observed (p = 0.2831), and these 
values were 7-8 times higher than the antioxidant activity observed in 
conventional and ecological white wine. In contrast with other studies, the 
total concentrations of phenolic compounds in conventional and ecological red 
and white wines were not related to antioxidant activity (p > 0.05). In red 
wines, no significant differences were observed in the antioxidant activity of 
ecological and conventional red wine (p = 0.28), while in white wine significant 
differences were observed in the antioxidant activity between conventional and 
ecological white wine (p = 0.006).

BACKGROUND: Nutritional biomarkers may be better measures of dietary exposure 
than self-reported dietary data. We evaluated resveratrol metabolites, potential 
biomarkers of wine consumption, in humans after moderate consumption of 
sparkling, white, or red wines.
METHODS: We performed 2 randomized, crossover trials and a cohort study. In the 
first study, 10 healthy men consumed 30 g of ethanol/day as sparkling wine or 
gin for 28 days. In the second trial, 10 healthy women consumed 20 g of 
ethanol/day as white or red wine for 28 days. We also evaluated 52 participants 
in a study on the effects of a Mediterranean diet on primary prevention of 
cardiovascular disease (the PREDIMED Study). We used liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to analyze urinary total resveratrol 
metabolites (TRMs) and predictive values and ROC curve analyses to assess the 
diagnostic accuracy.
RESULTS: We observed significant increases in TRMs [72.4 (95% confidence 
interval, 48.5-96.2; P = 0.005), 211.5 (166.6-256.3; P = 0.005), and 560.5 
nmol/g creatinine (244.9-876.1; P = 0.005)] after consumption of sparkling, 
white, or red wine, respectively, but no changes after the washout or gin 
periods. In the cohort study, the reported daily dose of wine consumption 
correlated directly with TRMs (r = 0.654; P < 0.001). Using a cutoff of 90 
nmol/g, we were able to use TRMs to differentiate wine consumers from abstainers 
with a sensitivity of 72% (60%-84%); and a specificity of 94% (87%-100%).
CONCLUSIONS: Resveratrol metabolites in urine may be useful biomarkers of wine 
intake in epidemiologic and intervention studies.

The study was aimed at verification of the following hypothesis: differences in 
antioxidant capacity of diets consisting of different cereals and byproducts 
affect the antioxidant status of the consumers of these diets. To validate that 
hypothesis this study investigated the contents of polyphenols and 
alpha-tocopherol as well as the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in vitro of 
cereals and their fractions (barley, husked and naked oat, oat bran, and 
triticale); the nutritional and antioxidant properties of diets containing these 
cereals, applied in a 4-week feeding experiment on rats, were also assessed. 
Among the cereals examined, the highest TAC was reported for barley (13.16 
micromol of Trolox/g) and the lowest for naked oat (3.84 micromol of Trolox/g). 
Compared with cereals, the TAC of buckwheat waste was 2-3 times higher (25.2 
micromol of Trolox/g). The antioxidant capacity of diets, calculated in vitro, 
ranged from 6.35 micromol of Trolox/g for naked oat type diet to 10.51 micromol 
of Trolox/g for barley type diet. Results of an in vitro study were confirmed in 
changes of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and the level of 
thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in the serum of rats fed diets 
with the highest and lowest antioxidant capacities in vitro; the barley diet 
increased the activity of GPx (37.63 units/mL) and decreased the level of TBARS 
(4.82 microg/g), whereas the naked oat diet had an opposite effect (31.16 
units/mL and 5.91 microg/g, respectively).

A liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ionization ion trap 
mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-ESI-MS(n)) method was established for the analysis of 
danshensu, caffeic acid, ferulic acid and isoferulic acid in rat plasma, bile, 
urine and feces after oral administration or intravenous injection. 
Liquid-liquid extraction was employed for the preparation of biosamples, and the 
chromatographic separation was carried out using an Agilent Zorbax Extend C(18) 
reversed phase column and acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase. 
Totally nineteen metabolites were detected and identified as prototype, 
methylated, hydroxylated, sulfated and glucuronized conjugates. The metabolism 
of the individual phenolic acids in biosamples was investigated, and the 
metabolic pathway was proposed. By comparing the metabolism of different 
compounds which shared similar structures, we were able to find that methylation 
was the main pathway of danshensu metabolism, and the double bond on the side 
chain was critical for the drug excretion via bile and the formation of 
glucuronized conjugates. The results proved that the established method was 
simple, sensitive and reliable, which could be used to detect and identify the 
structures of metabolites and to better understand their in vivo metabolism.

This is a report about the identification of key metabolites of tectorigenin in 
rat urine using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization 
ion trap tandem mass spectrometric method (HPLC-ESI-MS(n)). Six healthy rats 
were administered a single dose (80 mg/kg) of tectorigenin by oral gavage. Urine 
was sampled for 0-24 h and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the 
supernatants, then the supernatants were purified by solid-phase extraction with 
a C(18) cartridge. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a 
reversed-phase C(18) column with a gradient elution program whereas 
acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid water was used as mobile phase. Mass spectra were 
acquired in negative ionization mode and a data-dependant scan was used for the 
identification of the key metabolites of tectorigenin in the urine samples. As a 
result, four phase II metabolites and the parent drug tectorigenin were found 
and identified in rat urine for the first time.

Phenolic acids (PAs) have been shown to be beneficial to human health and are 
found most abundantly in corn bran ( approximately 4%, w/w), one of the main 
dietary fibers. This study therefore evaluated the bioavailabilities of phenolic 
antioxidants ferulic acid (FA) and p-coumaric acid (PCA) in refined corn bran 
(RCB) by determining their recovery in the plasma, urine, and feces of rats fed 
a single meal of a RCB diet containing 5% RCB or adapted to the RCB diet for 10 
days. In both studies, 0.4-0.5% of ingested FA and 1.2-2.3% of ingested PCA were 
recovered in rat urine. By contrast, approximately 81% of FA and approximately 
64% of PCA ingested with the single meal were excreted through the rat feces 
within 3 days after the ingestion. On the other hand, after rats were fed the 
RCB diet, total FA (all forms of FA) was recovered in plasma at a concentration 
of 35.0 +/- 2.0 microg/L, total FA and total PCA were excreted through urine at 
levels of 155.4 +/- 5.8 and 50.9 +/- 6.6 microg/day, respectively. These 
parameters showed no significant change (P = 0.93, 0.09, and 0.66, respectively) 
after rats were fed the RCB diet continuously for up to 10 days. These results 
suggest that the PAs in RCB are bioavailable in rats. Their bioavailabilities, 
however, are relatively low compared with their high content in RCB and not 
improved by the adaptation for 10 days to the enriched RCB diet. Additionally, 
comparison with the results of other studies revealed that high contents of FA 
and, especially, diferulic acids in cereal bran, which act as cross-links 
between bran cell wall polysaccharides, may not improve but, rather, limit the 
bioavailabilities of PAs in vivo.

Plant lignans occur in many foods, with flaxseed presently recognized as the 
richest source. Some plant lignans can be converted by intestinal microbiota to 
the mammalian lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, which may have protective 
effects against hormone-related diseases such as breast cancer. This study 
determined whether plant lignans in sesame seed, particularly sesamin, could be 
metabolized to the mammalian lignans. The total plant lignan concentration in 
sesame seed (2180 micromol/100 g) was higher than that in flaxseed (820 
micromol/100 g). In vitro fermentation with human fecal inoculum showed 
conversion of sesamin to the mammalian lignans, although at a lower rate (1.1%) 
compared with that of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (57.2%). However, when 
fed to female Sprague-Dawley rats for 10 d, sesamin (15 mg/kg body weight) and a 
10% sesame seed diet resulted in greater (P < 0.05) urinary mammalian lignan 
excretion (3.2 and 11.2 micromol/d, respectively), than the control (< 0.05 
micromol/d). We conclude that sesame seed is a rich source of mammalian lignan 
precursors and sesamin is one of them. From intermediate metabolites of sesamin 
identified in rat urine by GC-MS, a tentative metabolic pathway of sesamin to 
mammalian lignans is suggested.

The antioxidant capacities (oxygen radical absorbance capacity, ORAC) and total 
phenolic contents in extracts of 27 culinary herbs and 12 medicinal herbs were 
determined. The ORAC values and total phenolic contents for the medicinal herbs 
ranged from 1.88 to 22.30 micromol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g of fresh weight 
and 0.23 to 2.85 mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g of fresh weight, 
respectively. Origanum x majoricum, O. vulgare ssp. hirtum, and Poliomintha 
longiflora have higher ORAC and phenolic contents as compared to other culinary 
herbs. The ORAC values and total phenolic content for the culinary herbs ranged 
from 2.35 to 92.18 micromol of TE/g of fresh weight and 0.26 to 17.51 mg of 
GAE/g of fresh weight, respectively. These also were much higher than values 
found in the medicinal herbs. The medicinal herbs with the highest ORAC values 
were Catharanthus roseus, Thymus vulgaris, Hypericum perforatum, and Artemisia 
annua. A linear relationship existed between ORAC values and total phenolic 
contents of the medicinal herbs (R = 0.919) and culinary herbs (R = 0.986). 
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with diode-array detection 
was used to identify and quantify the phenolic compounds in selected herbs. 
Among the identified phenolic compounds, rosmarinic acid was the predominant 
phenolic compound in Salvia officinalis, Thymus vulgaris, Origanum x majoricum, 
and P. longiflora, whereas quercetin-3-O-rhamnosyl-(1 --> 2)-rhamnosyl-(1 --> 
6)-glucoside and kaempferol-3-O-rhamnosyl-(1 --> 2)-rhamnosyl-(1 --> 
6)-glucoside were predominant phenolic compounds in Ginkgo biloba leaves.

quercetin glycosides in cranberry and lingonberry, and caffeic acid and its 
derivative in chokeberry were also present in relatively high concentrations. 
Chlorogenic acid, peonidin 3-galactoside, cyanidin 3-galactoside, and cyanidin 
3-galactoside were the most important antioxidants in blueberry, cranberry, wild 
chokeberry, and lingonberry, respectively. The contribution of individual 
phenolics to the total antioxidant capacity was generally dependent on their 
structure and content in the berries. Phenolics such as quercetin and cyanidin, 
with 3',4'-dihydroxy substituents in the B ring and conjugation between the A 
and B rings, had highly effective radical scavenging structures in blueberries, 
cranberries, chokeberries, and lingonberries. Phenolic acids such as caffeic 
acid also showed high antioxidant activity, probably due to its dihydroxylation 
in the 3,4 positions as hydrogen donors.

The purpose of this study was to examine the antioxidant properties of water and 
80% methanolic extracts of cereal grains and their different morphological 
fractions. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. Almari and cv. Henika, barley 
(Hordeum vulgare L.) cv. Gregor and cv. Mobek, rye (Secale cereale L.) cv. 
Dańkowskie Zlote, oat (Avena sativa L.) cv. Slawko and buckwheat (Fagopyrum 
esculentum Moench) cv. Kora were used. PC (L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine) liposome 
system and spectrophotometric assay of total antioxidant activity (TAA) were 
used to evaluate the antioxidative activity of extracts. Among the water 
extracts, only the one prepared from buckwheat exhibited antioxidant activity at 
the concentration analyzed. The following hierarchy of antioxidant activity was 
provided for 80% methanolic extracts originated from whole grain: buckwheat > 
barley > oat > wheat congruent with rye. The antioxidant activity was observed 
in extract prepared from separated parts of buckwheat and barley. In respect to 
hulls, the antioxidant hierarchy was as follows: buckwheat > oat > barley. The 
correlation coefficient between total phenolic compounds and total antioxidative 
activity of the extracts was -0.35 for water extracts and 0.96, 0.99, 0.80, and 
0.99 for 80% methanolic extracts originated from whole grains, hulls, pericarb 
with testa fractions and endosperm with embryo fractions, respectively.

The seeds of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench L.) were dehulled and then, 
following milling, extruded on a counter rotating, twin-screw extruder with the 
different barrel temperature profiles: 120, 160, and 200 degrees C. After 
extrusion cooking process, the following compounds were analyzed: free and 
conjugated phenolic acids, total polyphenols (TPC), tocopherols (T) and 
tocotrienols (T3), inositol phosphates (IP), reduced glutathione (GSH), and 
melatonin (MLT). The antioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase-like activity 
(SOD-like activity) were determined in the groats and extrudates. Extrusion 
caused a significant decrease in all the compounds tested, except for phenolic 
acids. The content of IP decreased by 13%, that of GSH by 42%, and that of T + 
T3 by 62%. A three-fold lower level of MLT and TPC was noted whereas the 
SOD-like activity disappeared when compared to the nonextruded material. A 
two-fold higher content of phenolic acids (free and released from ester bonds) 
was observed. In spite of the clear decrease in the investigated antioxidants, 
the extruded dehulled buckwheat seeds contained still significant content of 
bioactive compounds, which resulted in as little as an average 10% decrease of 
the antioxidant capacity.

A GC-MS method is reported for separation and characterization of widely 
different amounts of benzoic and phenolic acids as their trimethylsilyl 
derivatives simultaneously in cranberry. Fifteen benzoic and phenolic acids 
(benzoic, o-hydroxybenzoic, cinnamic, m-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxybenzoic, 
p-hydroxyphenyl acetic, phthalic, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic, vanillic, 
o-hydroxycinnamic, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic, p-coumaric, ferulic, caffeic, and 
sinapic acid) were identified in cranberry fruit in their free and bound forms 
on the basis of GC retention times and simultaneously recorded mass spectra. 
Except for benzoic, p-coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, and sinapic acids, 10 other 
phenolic acids identified have not been reported in cranberry before. The 
quantitation of the identified components was based on total ion current (TIC). 
The experimental results indicated cranberry fruit contains a high content of 
benzoic and phenolic acids (5.7 g/kg fresh weight) with benzoic acid being the 
most abundant (4.7 g/kg fresh weight). The next most abundant are p-coumaric 
(0.25 g/kg fresh weight) and sinapic (0.21 g/kg fresh weight) acid. Benzoic and 
phenolic acids occur mainly in bound forms and only about 10% occurs as free 
acid.
