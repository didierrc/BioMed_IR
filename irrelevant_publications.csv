Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive liver cancer, and its 
progression is significantly influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME). 
Tumor-derived exosomes (TEXs), an important component of the TME, significantly 
influence tumor growth by regulating immune responses, facilitating metastasis, 
and enhancing resistance to therapy. These extracellular vesicles (EVs) 
transport bioactive substances, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that 
promote interaction between cells in the TME. Recent research indicates that 
HCC-derived exosomes can inhibit immune cell activity, specifically in T cells, 
thus creating an immunosuppressive TME that facilitates tumor immune escape. 
They also augment metastatic capability by restructuring the extracellular 
matrix and promoting angiogenesis. Moreover, HCC-derived exosomes have been 
associated with developing resistance to drug therapy by transferring molecules 
such as apoptotic signals and oncogenic microRNAs, circRNAs and lncRNA. 
Understanding how HCC-derived exosomes affect immune modulation, metastasis, and 
drug resistance could yield innovative therapeutic targets to enhance therapy 
outcomes. This review focuses on recent research on the diverse functions of 
TEXs in HCC progression.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, 
highlighting the urgent need for the development of novel therapeutic agents. 
Glycyrrhiza glabra, a medicinally significant plant, is known for its rich 
composition of diverse phytochemicals. However, its role in the induction of 
apoptosis in lung cancer cells has not been well elucidated. The present study 
aimed to evaluate the apoptosis-associated cytotoxic and antiproliferative 
effects of Glycyrrhiza glabra methanol extract (GGME) on non-small cell lung 
cancer (A549) cells. The viability of GGME-treated A549 cells was assessed using 
an MTT assay, which revealed a significant antiproliferative effect at 200 µg/ml 
(p < 0.05). Morphological changes were observed via phase-contrast inverted 
microscopy. To elucidate the mode of cell death, Annexin V/PI staining was 
performed, and the mRNA levels of the pro-apoptotic Bax and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 
genes were quantified by real-time PCR. Interestingly, while Bax expression 
increased 4-fold (p < 0.01) compared to the control, Bcl-2 levels remained 
unchanged. Despite this pro-apoptotic shift in gene expression, the cells 
predominantly underwent necrotic cell death rather than apoptosis. Furthermore, 
LC-MS/MS analysis identified vanillic acid, fumaric acid, syringic acid, and 
thymoquinone as the major compounds in GGME. In conclusion, GGME exerts a 
antiproliferative effect primarily through necrosis rather than apoptosis.

PURPOSE: To establish and validate a nomogram for predicting pathological 
complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in breast cancer (BC) 
patients, aiming to identify subgroups potentially suitable for non-surgical 
management.
METHODS: Between 2010 and 2015, 4402 BC patients (3037 surgery, 1365 
non-surgery) were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
(SEER) database, with external validation in 339 BC patients from our hospital. 
Logistic regression identified pCR predictors and a nomogram model was 
constructed. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to minimize the effect 
of the imbalance of the prognostic factors between the surgery group and the 
non-surgery group.
RESULTS: Univariable and multivariable analyses revealed that age, marital 
status, T stage, N stage, differentiation grade, hormone receptor (HR) status, 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status and chemotherapy were 
significant predictors of pCR in the surgery group (all p < 0.05). The area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting pCR was 
0.756 (95% CI: 0.736-0.776), 0.717 (95% CI: 0.681-0.754), and 0.744 (95% CI: 
0.687-0.800) in the training, internal validation, and external validation sets, 
respectively. Non-surgery patients were stratified into high (> 375), medium 
(162.5-375), and low (< 162.5) nomogram score groups, with 5-year OS rates of 
70.7%, 49.2%, and 29.2% (p < 0.05). After PSM, 358 pairs of patients were 
included to compare 5-year OS between the surgery group and the non-surgery 
group, and the results showed that the 5-year OS of patients stratified by 
high-score group, medium-score group and low-score group between the surgery 
group and the non-surgery group were 85.4% vs. 72.8%, 78.3% vs. 59.8% and 79.3% 
vs. 20.0% (all p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: We successfully established a nomogram for pCR in BC patients. Based 
on this predictive model, patients with higher scores may represent potential 
candidates for non-surgical therapeutic approaches, warranting further 
investigation in future studies.

Chemoresistance remains a significant hurdle in breast cancer treatment. To 
address this, we explored the therapeutic potential of combining epirubicin, an 
anthracycline commonly associated with the development of resistance in cancer 
cells and with known cytotoxic effects, with 4-methylumbelliferone, a 
plant-derived coumarin. Our results demonstrated a coactive enhancement of 
epirubicin efficacy when this combination was applied to 3D breast cancer 
models, irrespective of molecular subtype. Mechanistically, 
4-methylumbelliferone inhibits synthesis of hyaluronan, a key component of the 
tumor microenvironment that promotes tumor growth and metastasis. By disrupting 
hyaluronan production, this compound facilitated drug penetration into tumor 
spheroids and reduced the expression of drug efflux pumps, thereby increasing 
intracellular drug accumulation. Consequently, the combined treatment led to a 
significant reduction in cell viability and promotion of cell death. Our 
findings suggest that targeting hyaluronan metabolism in conjunction with 
conventional chemotherapy offers a promising strategy to overcome drug 
resistance in breast cancer. This drug repositioning approach not only improves 
treatment efficacy but also highlights the potential of targeting the tumor 
microenvironment to enhance cancer therapy. Further studies are warranted to 
elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to evaluate the clinical translation of 
this combination therapy.

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is caused by pathogenic variants of the NF1 gene and 
increases the risk of tumor development. Phyllodes tumors are rare 
fibroepithelial neoplasms of the breast, for which the malignant forms exhibit 
high recurrence and metastasis rates. Herein, we report the case of a 
19-year-old female with NF1 who developed a malignant phyllodes tumor of the 
breast. She noticed a breast mass 3 years before referral, which was diagnosed 
as a fibroadenoma. However, rapid tumor growth was observed 3 months prior to 
her hospital visit. Magnetic resonance imaging of the breast revealed a 9-cm 
tumor, and lumpectomy confirmed the malignancy. Recurrence necessitated a total 
mastectomy and pectoralis major resection. One year after surgery, metastases 
were detected in the left axillary lymph nodes and femoral head, requiring 
surgical intervention and denosumab treatment. No relapses were observed after 
18 months. Comprehensive genomic profiling revealed a germline NF1 nonsense 
variant with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumor cells. Additional somatic 
variants of TP53 and SMARCB1 have been identified. The TP53 variant is listed in 
the Catalogue of Somatic Variants in Cancer as a breast cancer-associated 
variant, whereas a splice site variant in SMARCB1 and LOH suggests a loss of 
SMARCB1 function. This case highlights the increased risk of malignancy in NF1 
patients and underscores the need for comprehensive genomic profiling.

OBJECTIVE: To present reproductive and oncological outcomes of radical 
trachelectomy (RT) in patients with cervical adenocarcinomas (AC).
METHODS: This retrospective study included 51 patients with cervical AC who 
underwent RT at Peking Union Medical Hospital from January 1, 2005 to June 1, 
2023.
RESULTS: Five patients (9.8%) experienced cervical stenosis following RT, which 
likely occurred in cases of abdominal RT (50%) and virginal prophylactic 
cerclage (33.33%) and those without copper T intrauterine devices during RT 
(20%). In total, 30 patients (58.82%) attempted to conceive, and 11 (36.67%) 
succeeded. Five patients (45.45%) achieved pregnancy with fertility assistance. 
The mean surgery-pregnancy interval was 27 months (range, 17-118). Two preterm 
and two full-term births were achieved. With a median follow-up of 50 months 
(range, 7-238), seven patients (13.73%) experienced recurrence and three (5.88%) 
died. Six of seven patients relapsed beyond the residual cervix. The cancer 
recurrence rate (CRR) was 5.88% for patients with pre-cervical conization and 
17.65% for those with biopsy (p = 0.250); 11.63% had human 
papillomavirus-associated (HPVA) disease and 25% had non-HPVA 
(NHPVA) (p = 0.313). The cancer death rate (CDR) was 4.65% with HPVA and 12.50% 
with NHPVA (p = 0.386); 13.63% had the endogenous type and 0 had the exogenous 
type (p = 0.04). Chemotherapy in patients with risk factors resulted in better 
CRR and CDR than in those without (5.88% vs. 17.65%, 0% vs. 8.82%). The 
cumulative 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival rates were 
82.03% and 94.39%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: RT in patients with AC led to an acceptable pregnancy rate but a 
higher CRR and lower 5-year RFS. Careful patient selection for RT, combined with 
adjuvant chemotherapy when indicated, is crucial to optimize the balance between 
reproductive and oncological outcomes in AC.

Recurrence related to poor prognosis is a leading cause of mortality in patients 
with breast cancer (BC). The MammaPrint (MP) genomic assay is designed to 
stratify recurrence risk and evaluate chemotherapy benefits for early-stage 
HR+/HER2- BC patients. However, MP fails to reveal spatial tumor morphology and 
is limited by high costs. In this study, a BC MP cohort is established and CPMP 
is developed, a weakly supervised agent-attention transformer model, to predict 
MP recurrence risk from annotation-free BC histopathological slides. CPMP 
achieves an AUROC of 0.824 ± 0.03 in predicting MP risk groups. CPMP is further 
leveraged for spatial and morphological analyses to explore histological 
patterns associated with MP risk groups. The model reveals tumor spatial 
localization at the whole-slide level and highlights distinct intercellular 
interaction patterns of MP groups. It also characterizes the diversity in tumor 
morphology and uncovers MP high-specific, low-specific, and colocalized 
morphological phenotypes that differ in quantitative cellular composition. 
Prognostic evaluation in the external cohort exhibits significant stratification 
of distant metastasis risk (HR: 3.14, p-value = 0.0014), underscoring the 
prognostic power of CPMP. These findings demonstrate the capability of CPMP in 
MP risk prediction, offering a flexible supplement to genomic risk assessment in 
early-stage BC.

The emergence of nucleic acid (NA) therapeutics, including antisense 
oligonucleotides (ASOs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are usually 
delivered directly, and messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which are typically encapsulated 
in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), marks a transformative era in precision medicine. 
While these therapies offer precise approaches for gene regulation or 
expression, they can trigger unwanted innate and/or adaptive immune responses 
that can either have no significant impact or adversely affect treatment 
efficacy and/or patient safety. Consequently, therapies where an adaptive immune 
response is desired, such mRNA/LNP-based vaccines against infectious diseases or 
cancer are out of scope of this article. In the present work, the Innovation and 
Quality Consortium Nucleic Acids Immunogenicity Working Group examines how the 
various components of NA-based therapies might contribute to their immunogenic 
potential and describes risk mitigation strategies through product design 
adaptations during early development stages. In addition, a comprehensive 
immunogenicity risk assessment framework is described, allowing to effectively 
define a tailored clinical testing strategy for different NA modalities with 
varying immunogenicity (IG) consequences. A streamlined monitoring strategy is 
recommended when minimal impact is expected, whereas extensive testing is 
suggested when safety concerns arise. Overall, these recommendations ensure that 
safe and effective NA-based therapies reach patients with an appropriate 
assessment of the IG potential.

Aberrant expression of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (ACSL1) 
occurs in multiple cancer types and is closely linked to patient prognosis. 
Nevertheless, its precise mechanistic role in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains 
poorly understood. In this study, we assess ACSL1 expression in CRC and 
elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which ACSL1 regulates tumor 
proliferation and migration. Our results show that ACSL1 is significantly 
upregulated in CRC and is associated with poor patient survival. Knockdown of 
ACSL1 suppresses CRC cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, 
ACSL1 silencing downregulates the JAK2-STAT3 signaling axis. A strong 
correlation also exists between ACSL1 expression and epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT). Collectively, these findings indicate that ACSL1 is highly 
expressed in CRC tissues and is correlated with poor prognosis. Importantly, our 
study provides the first evidence that the ACSL1-JAK2-STAT3 pathway facilitates 
CRC cell proliferation and migration, highlighting its potential as a 
therapeutic target.

BACKGROUND: Prostate diseases, comprising prostatitis, benign prostatic 
hyperplasia (BPH), and prostate cancer (PCA), represent substantial public 
health burdens. This study aimed to clarify biomarker-disease relationships and 
identify potential therapeutic targets for prostate disorders using a Mendelian 
Randomization (MR) framework.
METHODS: We conducted two-sample MR analyses using genome-wide association data. 
Causal effects were estimated using complementary MR methods. To identify 
therapeutic targets, MR findings were integrated with DrugBank, protein-protein 
interaction networks, bulk RNA sequencing, and molecular docking.
RESULTS: Six biomarkers showed causal effects on prostate diseases: URK on 
prostatitis; GGT and TBIL on BPH; and UCR, PHOS, and BUN on PCA. Functional 
integration highlighted MPO and TUBB as drug targets for BPH, while docking 
implicated MET and ATP8B1 in BPH and GATA3 and ENPP3 in PCA. Drug repurposing 
suggested dexamethasone for BPH and colchicine and metformin for PCA.
CONCLUSION: This study provides genetic evidence linking biomarkers to prostate 
diseases and identifies novel druggable targets and repurposing opportunities, 
offering mechanistic insights and prospects for precision therapy.

Plain Language Summary: This article applies two-sample Mendelian randomization

Sarcopenia, malnutrition, and frailty frequently coexist in older adults with 
cancer, adversely affecting treatment tolerance, functional independence, and 
survival. While comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is the gold standard 
for frailty evaluation, its resource-intensive nature limits routine use, and 
simple tools are needed. This cross-sectional study included 291 patients aged 
≥70 years with histologically confirmed cancer, evaluated at a oncology 
outpatient clinic between January and November 2024. Sarcopenia was defined 
according to EWGSOP2 criteria: handgrip strength (HGS) and skeletal muscle index 
(SMI) by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Nutritional status was assessed 
with the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF), and frailty was 
defined as G8 ≤ 14. Additional measures included SARC-F, Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE), and Geriatric Depression Scale. The median age was 74 years, 
and 53% were male. Possible sarcopenia was identified in 39.5%, confirmed 
sarcopenia in 33.7%, severe sarcopenia in 26.8%. Nutritional risk was observed 
in 66.7%, and frailty in 44.7%. Frailty correlated strongly with nutritional 
status and moderately with muscle strength and mass. In multivariable analysis, 
low HGS, low SMI, nutritional risk, and depression independently predicted 
frailty. ROC analysis showed, G8 with HGS and nutritional assessment improved 
predictive accuracy. These findings highlight that simple measures enhance 
frailty detection and may support personalized care.

RNA N1-methyladenosine (m1A) methylation is dynamically regulated by 
methyltransferases (TRMT6/61/61B/10C), demethylases (ALKBH1/3), and binding 
proteins (YTHDF1/2/3), which collectively fine-tune gene expression through 
site-specific modifications. Exogenous environmental factors such as persistent 
organic pollutants, heavy metals, and radiation can trigger cellular oxidative 
stress and stimulate the secretion of reactive oxygen species and 
senescence-associated secretory phenotypes. The concurrent accumulation of these 
damaging agents, along with dysregulation of intracellular conditions including 
temperature, pH, and divalent metal ion concentrations under pathological 
states, disrupts m1A methylation and alters the expression of associated genes, 
ultimately leading to adverse cellular outcomes. In addition, we searched a 
large number of literature and found that m1A methylation exhibits elevated 
levels in neurodegeneration, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and hepatocellular and 
bladder cancer, whereas decreased levels are observed in Alzheimer's disease and 
myocardial infarction. Correspondingly, methyltransferases and binding proteins 
involved in m1A modification are generally upregulated across multiple disease 
contexts. We propose that m1A methylation serves as a molecular sensor for 
environmental-cell interactions, dynamically regulating gene expression through 
regulators and exerting bidirectional control in disease processes. Given its 
regulatory versatility, m1A modification holds promise for applications in 
toxicological risk assessment, precision medicine, and the development of 
targeted therapies against exogenous factor-induced pathologies.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cellular senescence, a stress-induced cell cycle arrest 
state, plays a dual role in cancer. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), endogenous 
noncoding RNAs, regulate physiological processes and are linked to diseases 
including cancer. This study investigates the role and mechanism of circPTK2 in 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Lentivirus-mediated knockdown or overexpression of 
circPTK2 were used to assess effects on proliferation and senescence. circPTK2 
expression in NSCLC tissues was examined using tissue microarrays and in situ 
hybridization. RNA-seq identified circPTK2-regulated signalling pathways and 
downstream targets. Transcriptional regulation of FOXM1 by NFYA was investigated 
using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and dual-luciferase reporter assays. 
Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) was conducted to assess the interaction between 
NFYA and MDM2, as well as NFYA ubiquitination.
KEY RESULTS: circPTK2 was highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and was associated 
with poor prognosis. Knockdown of circPTK2 significantly inhibited cancer cell 
growth and enhanced cellular senescence. RNA-seq analysis identified FOXM1 as a 
downstream target of circPTK2. Database predictions suggested that NFYA could 
transcriptionally regulate FOXM1. Knockdown of circPTK2 induced NFYA 
degradation. circPTK2 was found to bind to the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 in the 
cytoplasm, thereby preventing MDM2 from interacting with the transcription 
factor NFYA. This interaction blocked MDM2-mediated ubiquitylation and 
degradation of NFYA. Additionally, NFYA bound to the FOXM1 gene promoter, 
ultimately leading to the up-regulation of FOXM1 and suppression of cellular 
senescence.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Elevated circPTK2 expression correlates with 
poorer survival, representing a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC.

The combination of challenges associated with osteosarcoma treatment emerges 
from the inadequacy of conventional cancer therapies to heal the extensive bone 
defects generated following tumor excision. On the other hand, the 
bone-regeneration approach lacks in mitigating the risk of tumor recurrence. 
This therapeutic gap demands the necessity of a multifunctional approach that 
simultaneously inhibits cancer recurrence and promotes the process of bone 
regeneration. The extensively employed traditional photosensitizers display 
limited anticancer activity and lack regenerative properties. These constraints 
are circumvented through the development of a bilayer Janus hydrogel that 
integrates NaDyF4@NaYF4:Nd3+ nanophosphors within a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) 
layer, while a chitosan layer encompasses functionalized alendronate and 
samarium. This multifunctional hydrogel, developed through a freeze-thaw 
process, exhibited strong photothermal activity and also demonstrated efficacy 
in eradicating MG63 osteosarcoma cells in vitro. Further, the typical 
extracellular matrix resemblance characteristic of the hydrogel demonstrated 
better cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MG63 cells and 
promoted vascularization in the CAM model. Moreover, the presence of lanthanides 
in the hydrogel facilitates multimodal imaging characteristics of magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and near-infrared (NIR) 
luminescence. Thus, the synergistic effect of encompassing localized cancer 
therapy and efficient bone restoration offers a promising strategy to treat bone 
tumors.

We investigated the course of fatigue, neuropathy, psychological distress and 
their impact on HRQoL among diffuse large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) survivors up 
to 13 years after diagnosis, and compared it to an age- and sex-matched 
population. DLBCL survivors diagnosed between 2004 and 2011, who survived 
≥ 1 year were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Survivors completed 
annual questionnaires 2009-2019, including EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC CLL-17 and the 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Linear mixed models were used to assess 
symptom trends and HRQoL associations over time. 302 survivors (response rate 
84%) completed a median of three questionnaires. Fatigue improved slightly over 
time but neuropathy and psychological distress remained unchanged; persistent 
symptoms were reported by 25%, 28%, and 23% of survivors, respectively. 
Having two or more comorbidities was associated with higher symptom levels 
(βfatigue = 7.8, p-value < 0.001; βneuropathy = 6.7, p-value = 0.003; 
βpsychological distress = 2.2, p-value < 0.001). Having received seven to eight 
cycles of (R-)CHOP14 was associated with higher neuropathy levels (β = 14.5, 
p < 0.001) and non-(R-)CHOP treatments were associated to high fatigue levels 
(β = 14.0, p-value = 0.02) and psychological distress (β = 4.3, p-value = 0.01). 
Higher symptom levels were associated with poorer HRQoL. One in four DLBCL 
survivors reported persistent fatigue, neuropathy or psychological distress, 
negatively impacting their HRQoL. Routine symptom monitoring is essential to 
identify needs and guide supportive care referrals.

Metastasis is the primary cause of death in advanced/recurrent cancer patients. 
Cancer metastatic capability depends not only on cancer cells but also on the 
cancer microenvironment, particularly cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a 
highly heterogeneous population. Our prior work identified a POSTN-secreting 
CAFs subpopulation linked to gastric cancer (GC) invasion and poor survival. The 
Cancer Genome Atlas analysis in GC showed POSTN association with 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition and extracellular matrix degradation pathways. 
In vitro, GC exosomes induced adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into 
POSTN-expressing CAFs. Lentiviral POSTN overexpression in CAFs enhanced GC cell 
migration/invasion, while knockdown had the opposite effect. These results were 
validated in a nude mouse GC model. As POSTN is an integrin ligand, 
POSTN-positive CAFs (POSTN+ CAFs) activated integrin downstream AKT signaling. 
AKT inhibition significantly diminished the pro-migratory/invasive effect of 
POSTN-overexpressing CAFs. In summary, POSTN+ CAFs promote GC invasion via AKT 
pathway activation.

Background: The prognosis and disease course of medullary thyroid carcinoma 
(MTC) can vary widely among patients. Effective risk stratification is important 
for ensuring timely treatment and personalized follow-up. Biomarkers can enhance 
risk stratification and guide the development of targeted anticancer therapies 
and imaging techniques. While numerous studies have explored various 
immunohistochemical biomarkers in MTC, an overview is still lacking. This study 
aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of immunohistochemical biomarkers and 
their role in the prognosis of MTC patients, with a primary focus on overall 
survival (OS). Methods: This review was preregistered in PROSPERO 
(CRD42023469437). A systematic search was performed using the online medical 
databases Embase, MEDLINE (Ovid), and Cochrane. Quality was assessed using an 
adapted scoring system based on the REMARK criteria and the Quality in Prognosis 
Studies tool. The primary outcome was OS. Secondary outcomes included other 
types of survival and associations with clinicopathological risk factors and 
recurrence. Results: Of 2992 studies, 108 were included, investigating 170 
unique biomarkers and with sample sizes ranging from 11 to 327 participants. The 
majority (72%) were reported in only one article. A minority of studies were 
rated as high quality (28%). Markers of proliferation Ki-67 (Ki-67) and 
programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) were significantly associated with OS 
(hazard ratio [HR]: 6.67, confidence interval [CI]: 1.43-31.18 and HR: 3.34, CI: 
1.18-9.51). Conclusions: Our systematic review provides a comprehensive 
synthesis of the literature on immunohistochemical biomarkers in MTC and 
highlights the need for high-quality validation studies. Our meta-analysis 
confirms the prognostic value of Ki-67, although with varying certainty due to 
large differences in study quality. Furthermore, we describe the association of 
PD-L1 positivity with poorer OS, increased recurrence, and more aggressive 
clinicopathological features, which supports the rationale for further 
investigating the potential of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy for advanced MTC.

This study aimed to explore whether there may be a potential link between 
psychological factors and the occurrence of early-stage gastric cancer (EGC) 
among individuals diagnosed with atrophic gastritis (AG). A total of 258 
individuals receiving care in the Department of Gastroenterology at The 
Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University between March 2020 and November 
2024 were included in this cross-sectional observational study, including 173 
patients diagnosed with AG and 85 with EGC. Diagnostic confirmation was based on 
findings from both endoscopic procedures and histological examinations. 
Psychological well-being was evaluated through the application of the Kessler 
psychological distress scale (K6) alongside the Center for epidemiologic studies 
depression scale (CES-D). At the time of enrollment, clinical profiles, 
demographic characteristics, and laboratory indices were recorded. Comparative 
analyses were conducted between groups, and both univariate and multivariable 
logistic regression models were employed to examine potential factors associated 
with EGC. What's more, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis 
was utilized to explore the discriminative capacity of psychological 
assessments. Compared to the AG group, patients with EGC exhibited significantly 
higher K6 (10.36 ± 5.54 vs 5.82 ± 5.25, P < .001) and CES-D scores (12.99 ± 7.70 
vs 9.01 ± 7.27, P < .001), with a greater proportion exceeding clinical cutoffs 
(K6 ≥ 13: 30.59% vs 12.72%; CES-D ≥ 16: 41.18% vs 21.39%). Multivariate logistic 
regression identified Helicobacter pylori infection (OR = 3.960, P = .003), 
concave-type lesion morphology (OR = 107.086, P < .001), K6 score (OR = 1.192, 
P < .001), and CES-D score (OR = 1.097, P = .001) as independent predictors of 
progression from AG to EGC. ROC analysis demonstrated moderate predictive value 
for the K6 (AUC = 0.729) and CES-D (AUC = 0.652) scores individually, with 
improved discriminative ability when combined (AUC = 0.763). Among individuals 
with AG, psychological distress and depressive tendencies showed a potential 
association with early-stage gastric malignancy. While not conclusive, these 
observations imply that incorporating mental health screening tools, such as the 
K6 and CES-D scales, could offer supplementary value in the broader context of 
evaluating patients who might carry an increased likelihood of disease 
progression.

Elderly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients do not always benefit from 
standard treatments due to impaired organ function and/or multiple 
comorbidities. Our study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of 
aumolertinib as a first-line therapy in NSCLC patients aged ≥65 and <65 years in 
clinical practice.We enrolled 100 patients with stage IIA-IVB epidermal growth 
factor receptor-mutant NSCLC who received aumolertinib alone as the first-line 
therapy. Efficacy and safety were compared between patients aged ≥65 and <65 
years in different subgroups. The primary endpoint was the objective response 
rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), 
overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), and safety.Overall, ORR and 
DCR were 76% and 98%, respectively. ORR was 69.4% and 82.4% for patients 
aged ≥ 65 and < 65 years, respectively (P = .27), and DCR was 98% and 98%, 
respectively (P = .93). The median PFS was 23.2 months. The median PFS was 26.9 
months and 18.3 months in the ≥65 and <65 years groups, respectively (P = .377, 
and the median OS of all patients was 31.7 months. The median OS was 33.7 months 
and 30.7 months in the ≥65 and <65 years groups, respectively (P = .851). 
Adverse events were not statistically different between the 2 groups.The 
efficacy and safety profile of aumolertinib as a first-line therapy in elderly 
patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant NSCLC were similar to 
those observed in the younger subgroup.

Lung cancer remains a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, imposing 
a significant healthcare burden worldwide. To comprehensively investigate 
potential risk factors for lung cancer and provide a theoretical basis for its 
prevention and treatment, we utilized publicly available genome-wide association 
study data of European ancestry. We treated various traits as exposures and lung 
cancer as the outcome. Causal relationships were assessed using 5 Mendelian 
randomization (MR) methods: inverse-variance weighted, constrained maximum 
likelihood and model averaging, debiased inverse-variance weighted, 
contamination mixture, and Mendelian randomization-robust adjusted profile 
score. We subsequently performed meta-analysis and median-based MR to synthesize 
the roles of different risk factors in lung cancer development. Following 
outlier removal via radial MR and MR analyses, we identified 88, 113, 248, and 
232 exposure datasets showing causal associations with lung adenocarcinoma, 
small cell lung cancer, lung cancer overall, and squamous cell lung cancer, 
respectively. Further integration via meta-analysis and median MR revealed that 
higher educational attainment may reduce lung cancer risk by delaying age at 
first sexual intercourse, increasing age at first childbirth, lowering body mass 
index and adiposity, and reducing smoking frequency. Our comprehensive analysis 
suggests that education may play a protective role against lung carcinogenesis, 
potentially mediated through behavioral changes such as reduced smoking and 
modifications in physical health indicators including body mass index and 
adiposity.

Hypopharyngeal carcinoma (HC) is one of the rarest and worst head and neck 
cancers (HNC) with insidious location, atypical early symptoms, and frequently 
diagnosed in advanced stages. The risk factors of HC mainly include smoking and 
drinking. Preventive interventions directed towards environmental risk factors 
are highly likely to yield far-reaching beneficial effects in reducing the 
incidence of this disease. The majority of advanced HC patients undergo 
multimodal treatments that encompass radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery, 
with poor oncological and functional outcomes. The early diagnosis and 
management of HC are vital for improving the prognosis of patients. Currently, 
there are few reviews specifically focusing on early HC, thus this review aims 
to summarize the current advancements in the diagnosis and management of early 
HC. Magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (ME-NBI) can improve the 
detection rate of early lesions and assess the invasion depth by enhancing the 
visualization of microvascular patterns. In recent years, artificial 
intelligence (AI) presents a promising prospect in the detection of early HC 
through deep learning algorithms. Larynx-preserving surgery or radiotherapy 
alone is predominantly recommended for individuals diagnosed at an early stage, 
aiming to achieve optimal oncological control while preserving crucial 
functions. With the increasing detection rates of early HC and the development 
of surgical equipment, transoral minimally invasive surgery is becoming more 
widely applied in HC. Its minimally invasive nature offers reduced morbidity and 
faster recovery, making it an attractive option for eligible patients with early 
HC.

Endometrial carcinoma (EC) remains an ambiguous pathogenesis. This study aimed 
to investigate the potential of causal genes in predicting EC prognosis. The 
prognostic biomarkers of EC were identified using univariate Cox regression 
analyses based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Uterine Corpus Endometrial 
Carcinoma (TCGA-UCEC). Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted to 
infer causal relationships, utilizing expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) 
derived from prognostic genes as exposures, and a dataset from European 
populations with EC as outcomes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that 
significantly influenced gene expression (eQTLs) were selected as instrumental 
variables. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was employed as the 
primary analytical approach. Sensitivity analyses were performed to ensure 
robustness of the findings. Causal genes with potential prognostic significance 
were further evaluated using multivariate Cox regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier 
(KM) overall survival curves, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
analysis. Additionally, results from gene ontology (GO) and gene set enrichment 
analysis (GSEA) of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), along with immune 
infiltration analyses in the high- and low-risk groups, are presented. 18 genes 
exhibiting a negative correlation with EC demonstrated a protective effect, 
whereas 9 genes identified as risk factors for EC exerted an adverse effect on 
the disease. A prognostic model was developed consisting of 8 genes selected 
from 27 genes. According to the KM overall survival curve data, ECs classified 
with high-risk ratings exhibited significantly poor prognoses (P < .0001). The 
ROC curve analysis indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) for this risk 
model in predicting the 1-, 3-, and 5-year EC survival rates were 0.704, 0.735, 
and 0.766, respectively. Furthermore, GO and GSEA results of DEGs in both the 
high- and low-risk groups revealed strong associations with pathways related to 
cell motility and immune response, among others. In addition, an analysis of 
immune cell infiltration demonstrated significant differences between the high- 
and low-risk groups. A prognostic model for EC using causal genes identified 
using MR has good sensitivity and specificity. These findings provide new 
insights into ECs pathogenesis and suggest promising strategies for the 
diagnosis and treatment of ECs.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to be a leading cause of 
cancer-related mortality globally, and accurately predicting lymph node 
metastasis (LNM) in T1 and T2 lesions is vital for informing treatment 
strategies. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of artificial 
intelligence (AI)-based models, particularly deep learning (DL) and machine 
learning (ML) approaches, in predicting LNM risk in CRC.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, EMBASE, 
Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases, identifying relevant 
studies published up to April 6, 2024. A total of 6552 articles were retrieved, 
and after screening, 12 studies involving 8540 patients were included for 
qualitative analysis, with 9 studies eligible for quantitative meta-analysis. 
The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool.
RESULTS: Meta-analysis yielded the following diagnostic parameters: a 
sensitivity (SEN) of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.76-0.93), specificity (SPE) of 0.69 (95% 
CI: 0.52-0.82), and AUC of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.84-0.90). The likelihood ratios were 
2.80 (95% CI: 1.74-4.50) for positive and 0.18 (95% CI: 0.10-0.34) for negative 
predictions, with a diagnostic odds ratio of 15.27 (95% CI: 6.49-35.89).
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicates that AI-based models, particularly DL 
and ML techniques, demonstrate moderate SEN and good SPE in predicting LNM in T1 
and T2 CRC lesions. These findings highlight the potential of AI models as 
noninvasive diagnostic tools in clinical practice.

CXC motif chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) has an association with normal and 
abnormal progression. Previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of 
CXCR4 in breast cancer (BC), particularly in promoting metastatic progression. 
However, most of the existing evidence originates from basic research. Our study 
aims to evaluate novel the expression profiles of CXCR4 in BC. Computerized 
literature search was done on the online accessible databases, including 
ONCOMINE, Kaplan-Meier plotter, TCGA database and Breast Cancer Gene-Expression 
Miner v4.3 to explore the expression profile and prognostic roles of CXCR4. 
CXCR4 overexpression was associated with BC versus normal control. Elevated 
CXCR4 expression predicted better PFS, but no survival rate benefit in BC 
patients. Moreover, there is a survival rate benefit with high expression of 
CXCR4 mRNA in the negative ER but the positive ER group. CXCR4 was more 
frequently overexpressed in BC patients with negative expression of ER and PR 
and negative expression of HER-2. For molecular subtypes analysis, higher 
expression of CXCR4 was associated with Basal-like and HER-2 subtypes than 
luminal A and luminal B subtypes. Moreover, we demonstrate a positive 
correlation between high expression of CXCR4 and low expression of LASP1 and 
EIF4A1 via gene correlation targeted analysis, which is consistent with the 
result among the triple-negative breast cancer patients. Our results suggest 
that CXCR4 can be used as a biological factor to predict the prognosis of BC 
patients, especially those with triple-negative breast cancer, and is also a 
tumor marker with potential value in the future treatment of BC.

The management of spinal metastases presents a significant challenge for spine 
surgeons, especially in cases of lung cancer, which is associated with the 
poorest prognosis among primary cancer types. This study aimed to evaluate the 
postoperative quality of life of patients with symptomatic spinal metastases 
from lung cancer and identify clinical factors associated with improved outcomes 
regarding quality of life. This was a retrospective review of a prospectively 
maintained database from November 2009 to November 2020, including 128 patients 
who underwent surgery for symptomatic spinal metastases from lung cancer. The 
primary outcome was the change in Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) at 1 week 
and 6 months post-operation. Patients were dichotomized into an ""improvement"" 
group (KPS increased) and a ""non-improvement"" group (KPS stable or decreased). 
Binary logistic regression was used to identify independent preoperative factors 
associated with KPS improvement. A total of 72 males and 56 females, with a mean 
age of 60 ± 10 years, were enrolled in the current study. Male sex was 
associated with improved quality of life in the short-term post-operation (odds 
ratio [OR] = 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.716-0.962]). Conversely, the 
number of total bone metastatic sites was negatively associated with short-term 
improvements in quality of life (OR = 3.66, 95% CI [1.55-8.67]). Additionally, a 
higher number of total bone metastatic sites was linked to reduced long-term 
improvements in quality of life, with an OR of 1.94 and a 95% CI of [1.05-3.59]. 
The number of bone metastasis sites is closely associated with postoperative 
quality of life in patients with spinal metastases from lung cancer. Careful 
patient selection is crucial and has the potential to significantly enhance the 
quality of life for these vulnerable individuals with limited life expectancy.

Medical University, Tianjin, China.

The ECT2 gene, encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, plays crucial 
roles in cell cycle progression and cytoskeletal dynamics, implicating its 
involvement in various cancers. However, a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis 
integrating genomic data is still lacking. This study employed an integrated 
approach using data from multiple cancer genomics databases to assess ECT2 
across various malignancies. Expression profiles of ECT2 were analyzed for 
differential expression across tumor stages and its association with clinical 
outcomes. Correlation analyses examined the relationship between ECT2 expression 
and immune cell infiltration levels. Pathway enrichment analysis identified 
biological processes influenced by ECT2 dysregulation in cancer progression. 
These methods facilitated a comprehensive exploration of ECT2's role in cancer 
biology, revealing potential implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. 
Analysis across 33 tumor types consistently shows elevated ECT2 expression. ECT2 
correlates with tumor staging in 8 cancers and molecular subtypes in 13 cancers, 
and shows associations with immune subtypes in 22 cancers, suggesting its role 
in cancer progression and immune modulation. ECT2 demonstrates strong diagnostic 
potential (the area under the ROC curve > 0.9) in 16 cancers and correlates with 
poorer overall survival in 11 cancers. ECT2 expression correlates positively 
with microsatellite instability in STAD, MESO, UCEC, and READ, and negatively in 
DLBC; it correlates positively with tumor mutational burden in STAD, PAAD, ACC, 
LGG, and LUAD, and negatively in THYM. ECT2 also exhibits diverse correlations 
with immune checkpoint genes and specific immune cell types identified through 
CIBERSORT analysis. ECT2 interacts with proteins like RACGAP1, KIF23, enriched 
in pathways involving cell polarity, Ras signaling, and tight junctions, 
impacting cancer progression and stemness in various cancer types. This study 
offers comprehensive insights into ECT2's role in cancer biology through 
integrative bioinformatics analyses. The results advocate for ECT2 as a 
potential biomarker and therapeutic target in diverse malignancies, suggesting 
avenues for personalized oncology strategies.

RATIONALE: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality and is 
often diagnosed late due to nonspecific or extrapulmonary symptoms. Atypical 
presentations in never-smokers with adenocarcinoma may delay diagnosis. This 
case highlights the diagnostic value of shoulder pain caused by unprovoked upper 
extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) as an early manifestation of thoracic 
malignancy.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 62-year-old male nonsmoker presented with a month-long 
history of progressive right shoulder pain radiating to the neck, without 
respiratory symptoms or trauma. The pain persisted despite analgesics.
DIAGNOSES: Doppler ultrasonography showed acute thrombosis of the right 
subclavian, axillary, brachial, and internal jugular veins, explaining the 
shoulder pain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a right hilar 
mass compressing vascular structures, and positron emission tomography-CT 
demonstrated mild hypermetabolism (maximum standardized uptake value = 3.1) 
without metastasis. Endobronchial biopsy confirmed epidermal growth factor 
receptor-mutant invasive adenocarcinoma.
INTERVENTIONS: The patient was hospitalized for extensive UEDVT and treated with 
low-molecular-weight heparin, later switched to the direct oral anticoagulant. 
No thrombectomy or thrombolysis was required. A multidisciplinary tumor board 
planned surgical or chemoradiotherapeutic management based on resectability.
OUTCOMES: Symptoms improved with anticoagulation, and the patient remained 
clinically stable pending oncologic therapy.
LESSONS: Lung adenocarcinoma may rarely present with isolated shoulder pain as 
the initial symptom. When UEDVT is identified without an evident provoking 
factor, underlying malignancy should be thoroughly investigated. Additionally, 
epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant adenocarcinomas may demonstrate only 
mild fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on positron emission tomography-CT, emphasizing 
that low metabolic activity does not exclude cancer.

This study explores the differential diagnostic value of conventional 
dimensional ultrasound (US) and automated breast volume scanner (ABVS) for 
breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) patients. A total of 986 female patients 
who underwent breast tumor surgery in our hospital from December 2019 to 
December 2022 were included. Clinical, US, ABVS, and pathological information 
were collected from all of the patients. Pathological results were used to 
separate patients into 3 groups: benign, DCIS, and invasive ductal carcinoma 
(IDC). Single-factor and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate the 
characteristics of DCIS. Of the 986 patients with breast tumors included in this 
study, 498, 193, and 295 were diagnosed with benign, DCIS, and IDC tumors, 
respectively. Compared with benign tumors, DCIS tumors were characterized by 
higher age at onset and breast imaging-reporting and data system (BI-RADS) 
grades, together with high rates of extension to the nipple, microcalcification, 
convergence sign, abundant blood supply, and nipple discharge proportion. 
Relative to IDC patients, DCIS tumors exhibited lower BI-RADS grades, aspect 
ratio values, and Ki-67 index values together with lower rates of irregular 
morphology, unclear boundaries, posterior echo attenuation, convergence sign, 
enhanced peripheral echo, nipple discharge, and palpable masses, and higher 
rates of extension to the nipple. Higher microcalcification rates in DCIS tumors 
were observed than the proportion of non-calcification in IDC cases. 
Conventional US and ABVS images of DCIS tumors exhibit certain distinctive 
characteristics that can aid in the differential diagnosis of DCIS.

Korea.

RATIONALE: Gallbladder (GB) malignancy is the most common biliary malignancy; 
however, squamous cell carcinoma of the gallbladder (GBSCC) is extremely rare. 
Synchronous primary GB and colon cancers are very rare, but they are still 
adenocarcinomas.
PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient was a 68-year-old male who had symptoms of anemia 
and underwent a comprehensive examination. Irregular thickening of the GB wall 
and localized bowel wall thickening in the ascending colon were observed.
DIAGNOSES: Colonoscopy revealed a large mass in the ascending colon, and 
adenocarcinoma was diagnosed by biopsy.
INTERVENTIONS: Right hemicolectomy and extended cholecystectomy were 
implemented.
OUTCOMES: The patient was diagnosed with synchronous primary pure GBSCC and 
colon adenocarcinoma. Anemia was found on the 10th postoperative day, and 
syncope occurred on the 12th day; computed tomography showed a gastroduodenal 
artery aneurysm, and covered stent insertion was attempted but failed. 
Consequently, intimal dissection and common hepatic artery embolization 
resulted, leading to hepatic failure, and the patient died on the 18th day.
LESSONS: We report a case of synchronous primary pure GBSCC and colon 
adenocarcinoma. Synchronous primary GB and colon adenocarcinomas have rarely 
been reported. However, synchronous primary pure GBSCC and colon adenocarcinomas 
have not yet been reported in English literature. Here, we present a literature 
review on the pathogenesis of GBSCC and synchronous GB and colon cancer.

Medicine, and International School of Medicine, International Institutes of 
Medicine, Zhejiang University, Yiwu, China.

RATIONALE: Iatrogenic diaphragmatic hernia (IDH) is rare, however, its incidence 
has increased with the growing number of thoracic and abdominal operations. IDH 
is a serious delayed complication that is easily missed and may lead to severe 
consequences. Recognizing and emphasizing the occurrence of IDH may help reduce 
its incidence. We report three cases of IDH from the past decade, each resulting 
from different operations, and managed with distinct treatments.
PATIENT CONCERNS: The first case occurred 4 months after a left upper lobectomy. 
Due to a lack of awareness, improper placement of a gastric tube resulted in 
gastric perforation.The second patient presented with symptoms 10 years after 
endoscopic full-thickness resection of a gastric fundus gastrointestinal stromal 
tumor and was diagnosed 12 years after the operation. The cause was likely 
diaphragmatic injury during endoscopic full-thickness resection, owing to the 
proximity of the diaphragm to the gastric fundus.The third case occurred 9 
months after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for liver cancer, which involved 
penetration through the diaphragm and caused iatrogenic damage.
DIAGNOSES: The first patient was initially misdiagnosed at a local hospital and 
was finally diagnosed with IDH and gastric perforation using computerized 
tomography (CT), gastroscopy, and upper gastrointestinal radiography. The second 
patient was diagnosed by CT and upper gastrointestinal radiography. The third 
patient was diagnosed by enhanced CT.
INTERVENTIONS: Surgical repair was performed on the first and third patients. 
The second patient declined surgery due to advanced age and having adapted to 
the discomfort caused by IDH.
OUTCOMES: The first patient recovered well postoperatively and showed no 
recurrence during the 10-year follow-up period. The second patient was 
experienced persistent discomfort, which did not worsen throughout the 5-year 
follow-up. The third patient also recovered well postoperatively and showed no 
recurrence during the 1-year follow-up period.
LESSONS: We emphasize that when a patient presents with relevant symptoms and 
significant unilateral diaphragmatic elevation is observed on imaging, the 
possibility of a diaphragmatic hernia should be highly suspected, and early 
diagnosis and treatment are essential. Furthermore, during operations that carry 
a risk of diaphragmatic injury-particularly hepatic operations - we recommend 
meticulous protection of the diaphragm to prevent IDH.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to identify the phytochemical components of Weiweisu 
(WWS) decoction, evaluate its therapeutic potential for chronic atrophic 
gastritis (CAG), and elucidate the underlying mechanisms with a focus on 
antiferroptotic effects.
METHODS: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to characterize the 
phytochemical constituents of WWS. Network pharmacology was applied to predict 
potential therapeutic targets and signaling pathways. Core compounds and targets 
were verified through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. 
Subsequently, a CAG rat model was established. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
was used to measure levels of prostaglandins (pepsinogen I/II) and tumor 
necrosis factor-α in gastric tissue, while Fe2+, glutathione, and 
malondialdehyde concentrations were assessed. Gene and protein expression levels 
of key targets were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction and western blotting.
RESULTS: A total of 1017 chemical constituents were identified via liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry. Network pharmacology revealed 20 
ferroptosis-related genes associated with WWS and CAG, primarily involving 
cancer-related signaling pathways. In vivo experiments showed that WWS 
ameliorated gastric ulcers and mucosal atrophy, downregulated pepsinogen I/II 
and tumor necrosis factor-α levels, reduced Fe2+ and malondialdehyde 
concentrations, and increased glutathione levels. WWS treatment also elevated 
HSP90AA1, MAPK, and mTOR expression while inhibiting GPX4 expression. Molecular 
docking indicated strong binding affinities between key active compounds and 
core targets. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of these 
interactions.
CONCLUSION: In summary, WWS decoction can treat CAG through antiferroptosis, and 
its main mechanism may be related to the regulation of tumor signaling pathways.

The main goal of this study was to clarify the causal link between dietary 
habits and the occurrence of oral cancer via a Mendelian randomization (MR) 
approach. This method offers valuable insights that can inform the creation of 
effective management strategies in clinical settings. This investigation 
involved a comprehensive dataset that included 8,943,774 dietary samples and 
3,723,373 oral cancer cases sourced from genome-wide association studies. To 
explore the possible causal relationship between dietary habits and the 
occurrence of oral cancer, various statistical methods, such as inverse variance 
weighted MR analysis, the weighted median approach, and MR-Egger regression 
analysis, have been employed. The variability in the results was evaluated via 
the Cochran Q statistic, and to address the issue of multiple comparisons, the 
MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO methods were utilized. Additionally, sensitivity analysis 
was conducted via the leave-one-out technique to ensure the reliability of the 
findings. Among 59 instrumental variables, inverse variance weighted analysis 
revealed an inverse relationship between oily fish intake and oral cancer risk 
(odds ratio = 0.998; 95% confidence interval: 0.997-1.000; P = .024). 
Nonsignificant results emerged from MR-Egger (P = .171) and weighted median 
(P = .483). Cochran Q testing confirmed no single-nucleotide polymorphism 
heterogeneity (P > .05), while MR-Egger (intercept = 3.776E-05, P = .389) and 
MR-PRESSO (P = .534) detected no horizontal pleiotropy. Leave-one-out analysis 
demonstrated robustness, with no single single-nucleotide polymorphism 
significantly influencing outcomes. Oily fish intake may reduce the incidence of 
oral cancer.

Ovarian cancer is typically diagnosed at stages 3 or 4, and up to 80% of 
patients develop peritoneal metastasis. Although initial chemotherapy with 
carboplatin and paclitaxel is effective, recurrence rates for recurrent ovarian 
cancer (ROC) reach approximately 75%. Recently, a minimally invasive approach 
known as pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) has been 
developed, in which chemotherapy is administered as a pressurized aerosol under 
laparoscopy. This study aimed to present the early outcomes of PIPAC for 
peritoneal carcinomatosis due to ROC. Data from ROC patients with ROC treated 
between January 2020 and January 2025 were retrospectively reviewed. PIPAC was 
performed alongside systemic chemotherapy for 6-week cycles, with at least 3 
sessions. The chemotherapy regimen consisted of doxorubicin 2.1 mg/m² and 
cisplatin 10.5 mg/m² administered via a nebulizer and injector, respectively, at 
37°C for 30 minutes. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS version 25.0. 
Normality was assessed with histogram plots and the Shapiro-Wilk test, as it is 
more appropriate for small sample sizes. Categorical variables were compared 
with the chi-squared test. The Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used 
for non-parametric comparisons, with post hoc analysis as needed. Spearman 
correlation assessed relationships between variables. Cox regression analyzed 
factors affecting survival, and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used for overall 
survival. A P-value < .05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 
26 PIPAC cycles were performed in 11 ROC patients with ROC. The mean 
pretreatment Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Index score was 23.18, which decreased to 
15.36 after systemic chemotherapy and PIPAC. According to the Peritoneal 
Regression Grading Score, 3 (27.3%) patients had a complete response, 4 (36.4%) 
had a major response, 3 (27.3%) had a minor response, and 1 (9%) had no 
response. Two patients (18.2%) underwent secondary cytoreductive 
surgery + hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The median overall survival 
was 15.13 months. Early results indicated that PIPAC may improve survival in 
patients with platinum-resistant ROC without increasing morbidity. Approximately 
20% of patients are candidates for secondary cytoreductive surgery. The low 
toxicity and repeatability of PIPAC when combined with systemic chemotherapy may 
improve treatment efficacy. Larger multicenter randomized trials are needed.

This study attempted to evaluate the incidence of incidentalomas based on 
computed tomography (CT) in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. CRC patients who 
obtained plan or enhanced CT for the whole abdominal and pelvis were included at 
the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. 
Incidentalomas, including uterine tumors, adrenal gland tumors, renal cancer, 
pancreatic tumors, prostatic tumors, ovarian tumors, upper-tract urothelial 
cancer, and gallbladder tumors, were assessed based on all radiology reports by 
radiologists and surgeons. Moreover, the clinical characteristics of all 
patients were collected. A total of 7053 CRC patients (mean age, 62.6 ± 12.3; 
4139 male) were finally included, 255 (3.6%) patients had an incidentaloma. The 
proportions of uterine tumors, adrenal gland tumors, renal cancer, pancreatic 
tumors, and prostatic tumors were 1.3% (92/7053), 1.1% (77/7053), 0.7% 
(46/7053), 0.1% (15/7053), and 0.1% (10/7053), respectively. Ovarian tumors, 
upper-tract urothelial cancer, and gallbladder tumors all had an incidence of 
<0.1%. The prevalence of incidentalomas in CRC patients was 3.6% (255/7053). The 
most common incidentalomas was uterine tumor, followed by adrenal gland tumor, 
and renal cancer. These findings highlighted the importance of careful 
evaluation of abdominal and pelvic CT scans in CRC patients, as timely detection 
and management of incidentalomas might optimize treatment strategies and improve 
patient outcomes.

Since the causal relationship between cholelithiasis and serum bilirubin levels 
and hepatobiliary and pancreatic malignancies has been inconclusive and 
inconsistent for a long time, to control confounding factors and reverse 
causality as much as possible, this paper adopted a Mendelian randomization (MR) 
study to reveal further the causal relationship between different exposure 
factors and hepatobiliary and pancreatic malignancies. This study selected 4 
exposure factors, including cholelithiasis, serum total bilirubin, direct 
bilirubin, and indirect bilirubin, by double-sample and bidirectional MR method. 
The results were as follows: gallbladder carcinoma, liver hepatocellular 
carcinoma (LIHC), and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PADC) were selected as the 
outcome, and significance level (P < 5e-08) was used as the filtering criterion 
to select genetic variation as the instrumental variable for follow-up analysis. 
Then, we calculated the odds ratio between exposure and outcome to show the 
causal relationship between different exposure factors and outcome. A series of 
sensitivity analyses were conducted to verify the conclusions' reliability. 
There was a causal relationship between direct bilirubin and gallbladder cancer, 
and direct bilirubin was a risk factor for gallbladder cancer (odds 
ratio = 3.07, 95% confidence interval = 1.02-9.22, P = .04). We then performed a 
reverse MR analysis on this analysis to further analyze the possible reverse 
causality between the 2 and found no reverse causality between the 2 (P = .22). 
At the same time, other exposure factors in the study did not show a causal 
relationship with the outcome. This study showed that serum direct bilirubin is 
a risk factor for gallbladder cancer. The conclusion was statistically 
significant (P = .04), and reverse MR excluded the reverse causal association 
between the 2. Cholelithiasis, serum total bilirubin, and indirect bilirubin 
were not causally associated with gallbladder cancer, and none of the exposure 
factors in the study showed a causal association with hepatocellular carcinoma 
and pancreatic cancer.

Elderly patients with pancreatic cancer (PC) not treated by surgery have 
extremely low overall survival (OS), and the aim of this study is to investigate 
the prognostic factors of elderly patients with PC not treated by surgery and to 
establish and validate a nomogram to predict their OS. Data on PC patients over 
65 years of age who were not treated surgically were downloaded from the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from 2010 to 2015. Patients 
from 2010 to 2014 were randomized into a training group (n = 2044) and a 
validation group (n = 877). Patients from 2015 (n = 662) were used for external 
validation. Cox analysis was performed to determine prognostic factors, and a 
nomogram was constructed to predict 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS in elderly PC patients 
without surgical treatment. The nomogram was validated using the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the calibration curve. 
Patients were categorized into low- and high-risk groups based on the median 
risk score for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Age, tumor size, grade, 
radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors affecting OS, 
and a nomogram was constructed. In the training cohort, the AUCs of the 
predicted nomogram for 1, 2, and 3 years were 0.725, 0.738, and 0.741, and in 
the validation cohort, the AUCs of the predicted nomogram for 1, 2, and 3 years 
were 0.716, 0.733, and 0.731, while in the test cohort, the AUCs of the 
predicted nomogram for 1, 2, and 3 years were in the test cohort were 0.777, 
0.794, and 0.813, respectively. The calibration curves showed that the actual OS 
at 1, 2, and 3 years was in good agreement with the predicted OS. In addition, 
the OS of patients in the low-risk group was significantly better than that of 
high-risk patients. We developed a new nomogram to assess the prognosis of 
elderly patients with non-operatively treated PC and to develop clinical 
treatment strategies.

A novel integrative biomarker, the systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII), has 
been understudied in cancer research. This study aimed to examine potential 
associations between body mass index (BMI) and SII in cancer patients. It 
included cancer patients aged 20 to 79 from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted between 2013 and 2018. A cross-sectional 
analysis comparing SII and BMI was performed using EmpowerStats software 
(version 3.4.3) and R packages. We utilized multivariate regression analysis to 
examine the association between SII and BMI in cancer patients. To further 
explore the relationship between the 2, we employed threshold effect analysis, 
stratified analysis, and smoothed curve fitting. The study included 1067 cancer 
patients, with a mean SII value of 553.32 ± 390.44. Our multivariate regression 
analysis revealed a positive association exists between BMI and SII in the fully 
adjusted model, with this relationship observed across all 3 groups. The 
threshold value between log-transformed SII (lgSII) and BMI, as identified by 
the segmented linear regression model, was 3.04 (×103 cells/μL). However, no 
inflection point was observed in female patients following stratification by 
gender. Our findings suggest that SII may reflect the systemic inflammatory 
status associated with obesity. However, its predictive value requires further 
validation in prospective studies.

University, Xining, Qinghai, China.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of elderly stage I-III non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) in the hope of providing more evidence for adjuvant chemotherapy 
in elderly NSCLC patients. Data from NSCLC patients ≥ 70 years of age during 
2010-2015 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database were 
used to analyze the data. Patients were divided into chemotherapy and 
non-chemotherapy groups. Propensity score matching was performed to construct a 
balanced cohort of chemotherapy and non-chemotherapy. Data from the matched 2 
groups were subjected to Kaplan-Meier analysis, and multivariate COX regression 
analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of chemotherapy on overall 
survival. Subgroup analyses were performed to determine the specific benefit 
population. A total of 18,126 eligible patients were enrolled in the study. 
Among these, 4776 patients (26.35%) received chemotherapy, while 13,350 patients 
(73.65%) did not. Utilizing propensity score matching, 6974 patients were 
successfully matched, achieving baseline equilibrium between the chemotherapy 
and non-chemotherapy groups. In the matched dataset, multivariate Cox regression 
analysis indicated a 26% reduction in the risk of mortality for the chemotherapy 
group compared to the non-chemotherapy group (hazard ratio = 0.74, 95% 
confidence interval = 0.70-0.78, P < .001). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis 
of the matched data demonstrated a survival advantage for the chemotherapy group 
relative to the non-chemotherapy group, with a statistically significant 
difference observed. Additionally, subgroup analyses revealed that specific 
demographics, including Black patients, those with higher grades of tumor 
differentiation, and patients classified as stage II-III, T2-T3, and N1-N2, were 
more likely to benefit from chemotherapy. Through the findings of this study, it 
was demonstrated that chemotherapy can enhance the prognosis of elderly patients 
with NSCLC. This is particularly evident in patients who are Black, possess a 
high tumor cell grade classification, are in advanced stages of the disease, and 
exhibit multiple peripheral lymph node metastases, as they are likely to derive 
significant benefits from this treatment.

RATIONALE: Porcelain gallbladder (PG) is an academic term to define a special as 
well as rare condition of some gallbladder diseases. So far, some issues still 
remain a discussion, such as etiopathogenesis, clinical features, correlation 
with gallbladder cancer, and surgical indication. We described a typical PG 
case, and reviewed some English literature as well as relevant cases from our 
institutions, aiming to further illustrate some issues mentioned above.
PATIENT CONCERNS: Herein, we describe a 54-year-old obesity woman with 
hypertension and prediabetes who presented with recurrent abdominal pain and 
indigestion for 35 years, with diagnosis of chronic cholelithiasis.
DIAGNOSES: She insisted on nonsurgical management for many years until a ring, 
high-dense shadow classically associated with PG, was found on computed 
tomography scan in the latest visit of the Emergency Department.
INTERVENTIONS: Therefore, she underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
OUTCOMES: The patient recovered uneventfluly after surgery, and the post 
oprative pathology confirmed a PG without any cancer cells under microscopy. 
After a month of follow-up, she was very satisfied with the clinical outcomes, 
with no surgery-related complications.
LESSONS: PG has a potential though low risk of gallbladder cancerization. If 
patients' condition permit, minimally invasive cholecystectomy is still a 
prioritized choice due to its safety and reliability as well.

Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory condition that has been 
clinically linked with the risk of developing oral cancer. The present study 
aimed to determine the oxidative stress in oral lichen planus (OLP) by assessing 
the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in 
OLP tissue samples and comparing it with that of normal oral mucosa. The study 
group consisted of 30 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks 
from oral lichen planus (OLP) cases, while 10 normal oral mucosa samples served 
as the control group. Tissue sections of 5-micron thickness were prepared and 
immunostained with the 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) antibody. The stained 
slides were examined under a light microscope, and statistical analysis was 
conducted using Fisher's exact test. A significant increase in oxidative DNA 
damage marker 8-OHdG expression (p < 0.05) was observed within the basal and 
suprabasal epithelial layers of lichen planus tissue samples. In contrast, no 
immunoreactivity was detected in the normal oral mucosa. Excessive production of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) during chronic inflammation is believed to play a 
crucial role in inducing DNA damage. The mutagenic marker 
8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in oral lichen planus tissue highlights its 
potential as a biomarker for assessing the risk of inflammation-driven 
carcinogenesis. Further research, incorporating various oxidative stress markers 
and clinicopathological correlations, is essential to enhance early prediction 
of malignant transformation in oral lichen planus.

BACKGROUND: Published reference CT protocols for lung cancer screening are not 
optimized to produce uniform image appearance across different scanner 
manufacturers and models or to conform to quantitative imaging profiles for 
robust small lung nodule size and volume measurements, which are important in 
clinical management of screen-detected nodules.
PURPOSE: This study used widely available phantoms and software to identify lung 
cancer screening CT reconstructions that enable accurate and reproducible nodule 
size measurements and to match reconstructions across scanner manufacturers and 
models to provide a consistent image appearance to interpreting physicians.
METHODS: ACR CT accreditation phantom scans were used to measure the modulation 
transfer function (MTF) and noise power spectrum (NPS) for various 
reconstruction kernels for six CT scanner models from three manufacturers. A 
reference kernel was chosen, and other kernels were matched based on agreement 
between MTF and NPS for each candidate kernel. Kernels were validated for 
conformance to the Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (QIBA) Small Lung 
Nodule profile using a commercial phantom and conformance testing software.
RESULTS: Medium sharp kernels with similar MTF and NPS curves and QIBA-compliant 
imaging performance were identified for the six scanner models. One medium 
smooth kernel with iterative reconstruction and one common lung kernel did not 
conform to the QIBA profile.
CONCLUSIONS: MTF and NPS comparisons to a validated reference CT protocol can be 
used to identify candidate scanner-specific reconstructions appropriate for lung 
cancer screening that conform to the QIBA protocol, thus producing accurate and 
reproducible nodule size measurements, and that should provide uniform image 
appearance to the interpreting radiologist.

BACKGROUND: While most studies on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) 
have focused on its negative impact, recent research has highlighted the concept 
of post-traumatic growth (PTG), where individuals experience positive 
psychological changes after a traumatic event. However, research on PTG in HSCT 
recipients remains limited. This study aimed to examine PTG as the primary 
outcome among HSCT recipients and identify key psychosocial and clinical 
predictors.
METHODS: Adult HSCT recipients within 1 year of transplantation at a university 
hospital in Seoul were enrolled from March 2018 to March 2022. Participants 
completed structured questionnaires, and treatment-related data were extracted 
from electronic medical records. Data were analyzed using descriptive 
statistics, t-tests, analysis of variance, Pearson's correlation, and multiple 
regression analysis.
RESULTS: Overall, 106 patients were enrolled. The average PTG score was 73.75, 
with higher scores observed in autologous transplant recipients compared to 
those who received transplants from sibling and unrelated donor transplants. 
Significant factors influencing PTG included marital status (β=-2.91, p < .001), 
positive changes after transplantation (β=-0.196, p < .009), rumination 
(β = 0.298, p < .001), transplant type (β = 0.268, p < .001), and social support 
(β = 0.191, p < .006), with the regression model explaining 53% of the variance 
(F = 20.773, p < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the need for tailored interventions that 
address key factors influencing PTG in HSCT recipients. They also highlight the 
essential role of oncology nurses in assessing psychosocial needs and 
implementing individualized, evidence-based care strategies to support 
psychological recovery and promote PTG.

BACKGROUND: Adult survivors of childhood cancers are thought to be at high risk 
for late-onset cardiovascular complications of prior anti-cancer treatments. 
While cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) has previously been 
observed in this population, data are limited regarding the utility of 
longitudinal echocardiographic monitoring.
METHODS: 124 adult survivors of childhood cancer who were previously treated 
with anthracyclines and/or radiation therapy as children were included in this 
longitudinal cohort study. Participants were enrolled in Northwestern Medicine's 
survivorship clinic: Survivors Taking Action and Responsibility (STAR) Program 
and followed for up to10 years between 2009 and 2022. Serial echocardiography 
was performed at baseline then at 1, 3, 5, and 7-10 years post-enrollment. 
Clinical data was collected by chart review. Major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACE) and CTRCD were adjudicated according to ACC/AHA MACE criteria and the ESC 
Cardio-Oncology guidelines respectively.
RESULTS: Over 10 years of follow-up in the STAR Program, 17.7% (22/124) of 
participants developed MACE, with the highest incidence observed in patients 
treated with radiation alone. 10.5% (13/124) of patients developed CTRCD by left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) criteria while 36.3% (45/124) developed 
CTRCD by global longitudinal strain (GLS) criteria. New incidence of MACE and 
CTRCD occurred as late as 7-10 years post-enrollment. Participants who developed 
CTRCD showed subsequent improvement in both LVEF and GLS by the end of 10 years 
of follow-up and treatment in the STAR Program.
CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of childhood cancer are at high risk for both MACE and 
CTRCD even many years after initial diagnosis. Patients who received treatment 
for pediatric cancer, then subsequently enrolled in the STAR Program as adults 
and received appropriate cardiovascular monitoring and treatment showed 
improvement in both LVEF and GLS by the end of follow-up, underscoring the 
importance of a dedicated survivorship clinic for adult survivors of pediatric 
cancer.

Arginine methylation is a critical post-translational modification that 
modulates protein stability, enzymatic activity, and subcellular localization, 
thereby shaping cell fate decisions and maintaining cellular homeostasis. As the 
principal enzymes catalyzing this modification, protein arginine 
methyltransferases (PRMTs) participate in key biological processes, including 
transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation as well as signal 
transduction. Dysregulated PRMT activity has been increasingly linked to tumor 
initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance. This review summarizes PRMT 
classification, structural and functional characteristics, and upstream 
regulatory mechanisms, offering a framework for understanding their diverse 
roles in cancer biology and therapeutic relevance. We further discuss the 
mechanistic contributions of PRMTs to multiple cancer hallmarks and highlight 
recent advances in the development of PRMT inhibitors. Finally, we examine 
current strategies for clinical translation, with particular emphasis on 
combination approaches involving chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and 
immunotherapy, thereby offering a foundation for advancing PRMT-targeted 
precision oncology.

BACKGROUND: Hypoxia and angiogenesis are crucial hallmarks of cancer that play 
key roles in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). 
However, the transcriptional mechanism underlying hypoxia induced angiogenesis 
(HIA) remain elusive. This study aimed to explore the regulatory networks, 
molecular mechanisms, and prognostic value of HIA-related genes.
METHODS: We collected multi-omics data, including chromatin immunoprecipitation 
sequencing (ChIP-seq), bulk RNA-seq, single cell RNA-seq, spatial 
transcriptomics, and microarray data from CRC patients and cell lines. 
Computational methods, including single sample gene set enrichment analysis 
(ssGSEA), signature-related gene analysis (SRGA), consensus clustering, and 
others, were utilized to explore the correlation between hypoxia and 
angiogenesis, identify the HIA-related genes, and establish the risk scoring 
system based on HIA-related genes. The role of mannose phosphate isomerase (MPI) 
was validated using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), Co-immunoprecipitation 
(Co-IP), western blot, colony formation, tube formation assay, and subcutaneous 
xenograft tumor models in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: We identified 12 HIA-related genes that are transcriptionally activated 
by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and functionally implicated in angiogenesis 
in CRC. Based on the differentially expressed genes among HIA-related CRC 
subtypes, we constructed a prognostic scoring system termed HIAscore. Patients 
with high HIAscore was correlated with poor survival, aggressive phenotype, and 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Spatial analysis revealed 
sequestration regions between epithelial cells with higher HIAscore and T/I/NK 
cells, hindering their infiltration. Particularly, MPI was found to interact 
with lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), and promote proliferation and angiogenesis 
of CRC through phosphorylation and activation of Janus kinase 2/signal 
transducers and activators of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signaling pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: This study depicts the transcriptional landscape linking hypoxia 
and angiogenesis in CRC, and identifies MPI as a novel regulator of this 
process.

BACKGROUND: Current negativity definition in esophageal cancer screening 
overlooks the risk heterogeneity between individuals with non-dysplastic Lugol's 
unstained lesions (ND-LULs) and normal-stained epithelium. We aimed to define 
the screening negativity by the incidence risk of severe dysplasia and above 
lesions (SDAs) after chromoendoscopy and ascertain their re-screening interval.
METHODS: We enrolled 815 participants with ND-LULs and 14,123 with 
normal-stained epithelium from the screening arm of a community-based randomized 
controlled trial (RCT). The control groups included the RCT's unscreened arm 
(n = 16,473), and population controls matched 1:5 by birth year, sex, and 
village (4075 controls for ND-LULs group, 70,615 controls for normal-stained 
group). All participants were followed up for up to 10 years. Poisson regression 
and the cumulative incidence function compared the cumulative incidence of SDA 
between groups.
RESULTS: Compared with the RCT control, the cumulative incidence of SDAs was 
significantly higher in the ND-LULs group over 10 years (adjusted IRR = 3.16, 
95% CI: 2.02-4.76) but lower in the normal-stained group (adjusted IRR = 0.52, 
95% CI: 0.37-0.72). Similar results were achieved using the general population 
control. The cumulative incidence of SDAs in the ND-LULs group significantly 
exceeded controls after 2-3 years while remaining consistently lower in the 
normal-stained group over 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with normal Lugol staining should be considered the 
genuinely screening-negative population for esophageal cancer. A 10-year 
screening interval is recommended for normal-stained individuals, while 
2-3 years are necessary for ND-LULs.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the prevalence and risk factors 
associated with late xerostomia and hyposalivation in head and neck cancer (HNC) 
patients after radiotherapy (RT).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational, multicentric cross-sectional study was 
conducted on 260 HNC patients attending various radiation centers for follow up 
1-year post-treatment. Clinical assessments included the Subjective Dry Mouth 
Score (SXI), Clinical Oral Dryness Score (CODS), and Unstimulated Salivary Flow 
Rate (UWS).
RESULTS: Xerostomia was reported by 78% of patients, with higher severity in 
those over 50 years (Mean ± SD: 13.53 ± 1.09). Women showed lower salivary flow 
(UWS: r = 0.556, p < 0.0001) and higher xerostomia scores (SXI: r = 0.337, CODS: 
r = 0.359) than men. Tumor site correlated strongly with xerostomia (SXI: 
r = 0.894, p < 0.001), with oral cavity tumors showing more severe effects than 
nasopharyngeal tumors. Higher RT dose and fraction were negatively associated 
with UWS (r = -0.537, p < 0.0001) and positively correlated with SXI (r = 0.293) 
and CODS (r = 0.405, p < 0.0001). The regression models showed that xerostomia 
severity is significantly predicted by advanced tumor stage, female gender, 
older age, and higher radiation dose exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: The study reveals a high prevalence of xerostomia and 
hyposalivation among HNC survivors. Increased xerostomia severity and decreased 
salivary flow were significantly associated with advanced tumor stage, higher 
radiation doses, and concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Understanding risk factors can guide early interventions and 
personalized management to enhance long-term oral health outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Exosome-mediated molecular processes significantly influence bladder 
cancer (BCa) development, but clinically applicable exosome-based prognostic 
systems are still lacking. This research aims to develop an exosome-related 
prognostic model using machine learning approaches and discover potential 
therapeutic targets.
METHODS: We implemented ten machine learning algorithms with eighty-one 
combinatorial configurations to analyze BCa transcriptomic data. Model 
validation incorporated time-dependent receiver operating characteristic 
analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, nomogram assessment, and Cox regression. 
Biological mechanisms were explored through immune microenvironment evaluation 
(CIBERSORT) and functional enrichment analysis (GSEA). Molecular docking using 
PubChem, PDB structures, and CB-DOCK2 identified potential targets, followed by 
experimental validation including quantitative reverse transcription PCR 
(qRT-PCR), Western Blotting (WB), cell proliferation (CCK-8, colony formation), 
migration (Transwell, wound healing), EMT marker detection, and tail vein 
injection-based lung metastasis assays in nude mice.
RESULTS: Analysis revealed 132 differentially expressed genes specific to BCa, 
which were subsequently refined to 15 prognosis-associated genes through 
univariate Cox regression. The machine learning-derived prognostic model (MLDPM) 
outperformed existing clinical indicators, effectively stratifying patients into 
distinct risk categories. High-risk patients demonstrated characteristics of 
immune evasion and poorer survival outcomes. Computational docking analysis 
identified strong molecular interactions between THBS1/MMP9/CXCL12 and standard 
chemotherapeutic compounds. Importantly, suppression of THBS1 expression 
significantly inhibited BCa cell migration and invasion.
CONCLUSION: This study establishes the first machine learning-based exosomal 
prognostic system for BCa and identifies THBS1 as both a potential biomarker and 
therapeutic target. The combined computational and experimental methodology 
offers a new approach for personalized BCa treatment strategies.

Multiple polyposis syndromes include Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), 
Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS), PTEN hamartoma 
tumor syndrome (PHTS), MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), NTHL1-associated 
polyposis (NAP), Polymerase proofreading-associated polyposis (PPAP), and 
MBD4-associated polyposis. Common to these syndromes is the presence of polyps 
in the large intestine and very high risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC), 
which can reach up to 100% in the case of FAP. The development of FAP is 
associated with pathogenic variants of the APC gene. However, pathogenic 
variants are not always detected in patients with FAP, which poses a significant 
clinical challenge for both patients and their families, who may be at increased 
risk for developing the disease. A second strong predisposition to CRC is MAP, 
characterized by biallelic pathogenic variants in the MUTYH gene, with a

BACKGROUND: Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) represents the terminal 
stage of prostate cancer (PCa), yet the molecular mechanisms driving its 
development remain unclear. Members of the histone lysine demethylase (KDM) 
family regulate histone methylation and thereby modulate transcriptional 
programs during malignant progression, contributing to PCa pathogenesis. While 
the function of KDM3B in PCa has been described, its involvement in CRPC remains 
uncertain. This study investigated the mechanistic role of KDM3B in CRPC 
progression.
METHODS: Clinical specimens and publicly available datasets were analyzed to 
assess KDM3B expression in PCa and CRPC tissues. Cellular proliferation was 
evaluated through CCK-8 and colony formation assays. In addition, RT-PCR, WB, 
and CCK-8 assays were employed to elucidate the relationship between KDM3B 
activity and CRPC development.
RESULTS: KDM3B expression was markedly reduced in both PCa and CRPC samples. 
Functional assays indicated that KDM3B suppressed the proliferative capacity of 
CRPC cells in vivo. Moreover, KDM3B upregulated PTEN expression, and its 
regulatory effect on CRPC cell proliferation was mediated through PTEN 
modulation.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that KDM3B suppresses CRPC cell proliferation 
by enhancing PTEN expression, highlighting its potential role as a 
tumor-suppressive factor in PCa.

BACKGROUND: Although several studies have suggested that sarcopenia is 
associated with adverse outcomes in kidney cancer patients undergoing 
nephrectomy, the results have been inconsistent. Therefore, this meta-analysis 
was conducted to investigate the relationship between sarcopenia and 
post-nephrectomy survival in kidney cancer patients.
METHODS: A thorough search was executed across multiple databases, including 
MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, to identify pertinent studies up to 
August, 2025. By employing random/fixed effects models, we calculated 
multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) accompanied by their respective 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs), in strict compliance with the guidelines delineated 
in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses 
statement.
RESULTS: A total of thirteen studies encompassing 3,142 patients who underwent 
nephrectomy fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Regarding the thirteen aggregated 
multivariate estimates, sarcopenia was found to be associated with reduced OS 
(HR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.25-2.01) and CSS (HR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.40-2.45). 
Nevertheless, our findings suggest that sarcopenia is not correlated with 
inferior PFS in kidney cancer patients post-nephrectomy (HR = 1.17; 95% CI: 
0.92-1.41). The robustness of these findings is substantiated by sensitivity and 
meta-regression analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia has been demonstrated to be independently correlated 
with inferior OS and CSS in individuals who have undergone nephrectomy for 
kidney carcinoma. These empirical observations highlight the critical necessity 
of sarcopenia evaluation in the context of risk stratification, patient 
advisement, and therapeutic strategy formulation.

BACKGROUND: The disability weight quantifies the severity of health states from 
diseases and injuries. It is a fundamental index to estimate the 
disability-adjusted life year in the Global Burden of Disease studies. 
Disability weight estimates have been shown to vary across different national 
populations, suggesting the influence of cultural differences. However, survey 
data of disability weights in the Global Burden of Disease study is still 
limited worldwide.
OBJECTIVES: To more accurately reflect the true health conditions of global 
populations, this study aims to systematically summarize the disability weight 
values from international authoritative surveys, and explore the influential 
factors of disability weight estimates.
METHODS: Based on the Global Burden of Disease study, surveys used paired 
comparison questions wherein respondents considered two hypothetical individuals 
with different health states and specified which person was healthier. This 
study comprehensively searched multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of 
Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. We identified disability weight 
studies that utilized the paired comparison method and were conducted in 
national populations, published in international peer-reviewed journals. A 
meta-regression analysis was conducted to estimate the overall summary effect of 
disability weight values for 235 unique health states. These health states were 
estimated for all non-fatal consequences of disease and injury, including 
infectious diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic 
respiratory diseases, neurological disorders, mental, behavior, and substance 
use disorders, hearing and vision loss, musculoskeletal diseases, injuries and 
others. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistics. Univariate 
meta-regression analysis was conducted to explore the impact of age, sex, 
education, population composition, and survey regions, respectively, on the 
summarized effect of each health state.
RESULTS: The total analysis sample consisted of 610,818 respondents from the 
Global Burden of Disease 2013 disability weight surveys, the Japanese disability 
weight survey, and the Chinese disability weight survey. The summarized 
disability weights of health states ranged from mild anaemia (summarized 
disability weight = 0.008, 95% uncertainty interval 0.001-0.016, I2 = 0.95) to 
heroin and other opioid dependence (moderate to severe) (summarized disability 
weight = 0.737, 0.651-0.823, I2 = 0.823). Pearson correlation analysis showed 
that high correlation was observed between the set of overall summary disability 
weights of 235 health states from this meta-analysis and those from all included 
disability weight studies (all Pearson's r > 0.9, P < 0.001). Univariate 
meta-regression analysis indicated that age, sex, education level, panel 
composition of survey populations, and the survey regions were associated with 
the summarized disability weights of some health states.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall summary of disability weights obtained from this 
meta-analysis is reliable. This study indicates that respondents' 
sociodemographic characteristics may impact a population's preference for health 
states, which should be considered in future disability weight assessments.

Cellular senescence, characterized by partially irreversible cell cycle arrest, 
has a dual role in cancer progression via the senescence-associated secretory 
phenotype (SASP). SASP encompasses a wide range of bioactive chemicals, 
including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteases, all of which can 
have a significant impact on the tumor microenvironment (TME). Initially, SASP 
can enhance tumor suppression by attracting immune cells and inhibiting cancer 
cell proliferation, but its long-term presence at TME can promote tumor growth, 
metastasis, and treatment resistance. Moreover, therapy-induced senescence, a 
common side effect of cancer treatments, can result in an increase of senescent 
cells and pro-tumorigenic SASP. Therefore, recent research has highlighted the 
potential of targeting SASP to improve cancer therapy. Among the therapeutic 
strategies, senolytic therapies selectively eliminate senescent cells, whereas 
senomorphic drugs decrease SASP without cytotoxicity, and there is also combined 
therapy targeting SASP for oncotherapy. Therefore, it is of crucial importance 
to develop more specific senotherapeutics and investigate the clinical 
applications of SASP modulation, such as using SASP components as biomarkers for 
therapy monitoring and personalized medicine. Taken together, understanding the 
molecular processes of SASP induction and their function in TME, including its 
heterogeneity across cell types and tissues, and designing personalized 
treatment are critical for optimizing cancer therapy and improving patient 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Reliable biomarkers to identify inoperable limited stage small-cell 
lung cancer (LS-SCLC) benefiting from post-definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) 
immunotherapy is valuable. This study aims to develop a circulating tumor DNA 
(ctDNA)-based algorithm to stratify progression risk and predict survival 
benefit from consolidation immunotherapy.
METHODS: Baseline tumor tissues from 203 consecutive LS-SCLC receiving dCRT and 
a cBioPortal LS-SCLC cohort (n = 218) were analyzed to identify tissue-based 
prognostic genetic alterations. Plasma ctDNA after induction chemotherapy 
initiation (post-ICT) and/or during subsequent thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) were 
collected from two independent dCRT-only cohorts (training, n = 49; test, 
n = 32) and from 86 patients receiving post-dCRT consolidation immunotherapy, 
for prognostic algorithm development and utility investigation.
RESULTS: Tissue-based prognostic biomarkers were generally rare except for PTEN, 
whose mutations were associated with antigen processing and presentation pathway 
enrichment (p.adjust = 0.008), and better progression-free survival (PFS, 
p = 0.047) and overall survival (p = 0.040). A Bayesian inference prognostic 
algorithm, combining post-ICT and TRT ctDNA detection, receipt of prophylactic 
cranial irradiation, and post-ICT shrinkage, accurately predicted 3-year 
progression (time-dependent AUC = 0.796) and stratified the training cohort into 
two subgroups exhibiting significantly different PFS (p = 0.008), with 
consistent performance in the test cohort (time-dependent AUC = 0.745; PFS, 
p = 0.098). The posterior Bayesian algorithm involving the test cohort revealed 
ctDNA-based risk classification as an independent predictor of PFS (p < 0.001). 
Notably, significantly improved PFS under consolidation immunotherapy was 
exclusively observed in patients predicted as high-risk (p = 0.004), with 
increasing benefit observed at higher high-risk thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: Serial ctDNA monitoring during dCRT is a critical approach to 
predicting inoperable LS-SCLC progression and consolidation immunotherapy 
benefit identification.

BACKGROUND: Mainland China's end-of-life care system remained underdeveloped 
marked by underutilization of hospice care services. Physicians-initiated 
end-of-life communication is likely to result in immediate enrollment in hospice 
care. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on how physicians in China 
undertake end-of-life communication in advanced cancer. This qualitative study 
aimed to explore physicians' experiences on discussing end-of-life matters and 
facilitating hospice care transition within families of patients with advanced 
cancer.
METHODS: A descriptive qualitative study was conducted. Using the purpose 
sampling, physicians were recruited from 8 hospitals in Shanghai, China. 
Physicians were eligible if they had experiences in treating patients with 
advanced cancer and were ineligible if they did not directly participate in 
end-of-life discussions with patients/families. Semi-structured interviews were 
conducted from August 2022 to February 2023. Qualitative data were analyzed by 
content analysis approach.
RESULTS: Among 18 physicians, three major themes emerged regarding barriers to 
effective end-of-life communication at physician, family, and system levels: (1) 
Physician avoidance in disclosing terminal prognosis: Prognostic uncertainty, 
Skill deficiency, Emotional burden, Concerns about therapeutic hope, and 
Systematic avoidance; (2) Family priority in end-of-life decision-making: 
Complex family dynamics, Cultural stigma, and Unstructured family coping; (3) 
Systematic fragmentation in hospice care integration: Limited awareness and 
understanding, Ineffective referral mechanisms, and Insufficient leadership 
support.
CONCLUSION: End-of-life communication in Shanghai is hindered by physician 
challenges, cultural norms favoring family decisions, and systemic gaps. 
Targeted training for non-hospice physicians, balanced approaches to patient 
autonomy and family roles, and strengthened referral/reimbursement policies are 
needed to improve hospice transitions.

BACKGROUND: Frailty and unfavorable lifestyle factors are associated with 
elevated cancer risk. However, whether adherence to a healthy lifestyle is 
associated with a reduction in frailty-related cancer risk remains unclear. This 
study aimed to examine the associations between frailty, healthy lifestyle, and 
overall cancer risk, and to assess the extent to which a healthy lifestyle is 
correlated with attenuated risks of overall and site-specific cancers associated 
with frailty.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study utilized data from the China Kadoorie 
Biobank (CKB), enrolling 484,225 adults aged 30-79 years from 10 geographically 
diverse regions across China. The frailty index (FI) was calculated using 28 
baseline variables, all of which represented health status deficits measured 
through questionnaires and physical examinations. Lifestyle behaviors were 
determined by smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, diet 
score, and body shape. The primary outcome was incidence of all cancer types 
during follow-up (ICD-10: C00-C97). Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional 
hazards regression models were used to evaluate associations between frailty, 
healthy lifestyle, and cancer risk.
RESULTS: Among 484,225 participants in the China Kadoorie Biobank cohort, 
288,531 (59.6%) were women. After 4,774,217 person-years of follow-up, 21,459 
incident cancer cases were identified. Participants with high frailty showed 
significantly increased risk of overall cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 1.31, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 1.23-1.38). Conversely, adherence to a favorable 
lifestyle was associated with reduced cancer risk (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.71-0.78). 
Additive interaction analysis demonstrated a significant negative interaction 
between frailty and favorable lifestyle regarding overall cancer risk (RERI: 
- 0.50, 95% CI: - 0.75, - 0.24). Most notably, we found that adherence to a 
healthy lifestyle was significantly associated with a reduction in the 
detrimental effects of frailty on overall cancer risk. Specifically, 
Participants with robust status and a favorable lifestyle exhibited the lowest 
cancer risk (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.51-0.63, P < 0.001). Furthermore, similar 
protective associations were observed for site-specific cancers, including lung, 
colorectal, and liver cancers.
CONCLUSION: In this large-scale prospective cohort study of Chinese adults, we 
demonstrated that adherence to a healthy lifestyle was significantly associated 
with a reduced risk of frailty-related cancer. Our findings highlight the 
importance of integrating healthy lifestyle factors into cancer prevention 
strategies for frail populations.

BACKGROUND: Despite the favorable prognosis of patients with pathological stage 
I gastric cancer (GC), recurrence may occur in a subset of individuals, and the 
underlying risk factors are currently being investigated. Tumor index (TI) plays 
a valuable role in predicting the prognosis of GC. The study aimed to determine 
the prognostic effect of TI on stage Ⅰ GC.
METHODS: Patients with stage Ⅰ GC who underwent radical resection were enrolled 
from the two medical centers from 2010 to 2020. TI was calculated by the 
pathological T stage multiplied by the maximum tumor diameter. The primary 
outcome was disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Cox 
regression analyses were utilized to evaluate the correlation between TI and 
prognosis.
RESULTS: The final analysis included a total of 684 patients from two medical 
centers. Higher TI exhibited a significant correlation with several 
clinicopathologic features, including N0 stage, TNM stage ⅠB, and positive PNI 
(all P < 0.05). Patients with high TI showed inferior DFS and OS compared to 
those with a low TI (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that TI was an 
independent prognostic factor for DFS (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.44, P = 0.010) and 
OS (HR = 2.39, P = 0.014) in patients with stage Ⅰ GC who underwent radical 
resection.
CONCLUSION: TI was an independent risk factor in recurrence and overall survival 
for stage Ⅰ GC patients who received curative gastrectomy. Incorporation of TI 
into clinical decision-making regarding adjuvant therapy and intensity of 
follow-up may be warranted.

The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway 
is critical for innate immunity, as it detects cytoplasmic DNA and drives type I 
interferon signaling. Pharmacological stimulation of this pathway has been 
recognized as a valuable approach for cancer immunotherapy, especially when used 
together with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Preclinical studies have 
demonstrated synergistic antitumor effects of cGAS-STING agonists and ICIs 
across various tumor models, while early-phase clinical trials are exploring 
their safety and efficacy in patients. Nonetheless, intrinsic tumor resistance, 
an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and therapy-associated immune 
toxicities continue to pose substantial obstacles to clinical application. In 
this review, we provide an overview of the present status of cGAS-STING 
agonists, emphasizing preclinical and clinical advances in combination therapy 
with ICIs, and discusses the challenges and future directions to optimize 
efficacy, improve safety, and expand the therapeutic potential of this strategy 
in oncology.

BACKGROUND: Previous meta-analyses have shown TAS-102's potential in metastatic 
colorectal cancer (mCRC). Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the 
efficacy and safety of TAS-102 combined with bevacizumab versus TAS-102 
monotherapy in the treatment of mCRC.
METHODS: A thorough search in four databases was conducted from inception to 
August, 2024. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective 
response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were incorporated to explore 
the efficacy. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were then carried out 
to determine the sources of heterogeneity. Funnel plots and Egger's test were 
employed to assess publication bias.
RESULTS: A total of 9 studies with 1,509 participants were included after 
screening. Compared with monotherapy, TAS-102 plus bevacizumab demonstrated 
encouraging outcomes both in OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.52, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 0.39-0.70, p < 0.001) and PFS (HR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.39-0.62, 
p < 0.001). And ORR (relative ratio [RR] = 3.28, 95% CI = 1.67-6.32, p < 0.001) 
and DCR (RR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.26-1.97, p < 0.001) both favored the combination 
group. In terms of hematological toxicity, combination group had an increased 
incidence of neutropenia (all grade RR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.00-1.32; grade ≥ 3 
RR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.21-1.58) and thrombocytopenia (all grade RR = 1.44, 95% 
CI = 1.06-1.94).
CONCLUSIONS: TAS-102 plus bevacizumab showed superior efficacy and acceptable 
safety over monotherapy, particularly in RAS-mutant patients, prior bevacizumab 
use, multiple metastases, and poorer performance status.

BACKGROUND: India is witnessing a high and rising burden of breast and cervical 
cancers. More than one-third of cases in India are attributed to these two 
cancers. Early detection and access to affordable and timely treatment are known 
to reduce the burden of cancer-related deaths. Low and Middle-Income Countries 
(LMICs) face significant challenges in implementing organized early-detection 
programs due to inadequate resources, contributing to high mortality from these 
cancers. Recognizing this critical public health issue, this study evaluates the 
published literature and government reports on the implementation of breast and 
cervical cancer screening programs in India.
METHODS: Literature was systematically searched from six databases: PubMed, 
Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. In addition, reports 
on the National Health Mission website were reviewed to capture screening 
efforts that were not published in the peer-reviewed literature.
RESULTS: 59 peer-reviewed manuscripts were identified, from 57 screening 
programs. The number of screening programs from Northern and Eastern states is 
low. Community programs focused on task shifting and engagement of local 
stakeholders for increasing participation. Clinical Breast Examination (CBE) and 
Visual inspection of the cervix (VIA) remain the mainstay of screening efforts. 
The main barriers to screening uptake by women were lower education, lower 
socioeconomic status, lack of transportation, and suboptimal services. 
Information on screening programs lacked uniformity in reporting and data 
collection.
CONCLUSION: These results highlight that screening efforts in India remain 
disjointed and programs by different agencies need to be aligned through uniform 
distribution, methodology, and reporting, towards goals set by global 
initiatives.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer brain metastases (OCBM) are rare and have poor 
prognosis, with limited clinical management guidelines. This study aimed to 
identify prognostic factors and optimal treatment approaches for patients with 
OCBM.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicenter analysis of patients with OCBM 
from 12 hospitals in China from May 2010 to May 2022. The primary outcomes were 
overall survival (OS) and brain metastasis-specific survival (BMSS). 
Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to assess treatment outcomes 
and identify prognostic risk factors.
RESULTS: In total, 129 patients with OCBM were included. The median interval 
from ovarian cancer diagnosis to brain metastasis (BM) was 25.74 (range: 
0-103.1) months. Headache attributed to BM was the most common presenting 
symptom, reported in 64 (49.6%) patients, followed by paralysis in 23 (17.8%) 
patients. The cerebellum and brainstem were the most frequent metastatic sites 
(36 patients, 27.9%), followed by the frontal lobe (27 patients, 20.9%). In BMSS 
analysis, multiple BM lesions (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.060; 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 1.308-3.244; P = 0.002), headache attributed to BM (HR: 1.765; 95% CI: 
1.049-2.968; P = 0.032), and relapse lines before BM diagnosis (HR: 2.060; 95% 
CI: 1.308-3.244; P = 0.002) were independent predictors of worse BMSS. Subgroup 
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with a single BM lesion achieved 
significantly better outcomes with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) compared with 
those having multiple lesions.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that patients with a single BM lesion may 
benefit from SRS, whereas those with multiple lesions require more 
individualized treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Accurately distinguishing benign from malignant adrenal lesions 
remains a clinical challenge, especially in oncology patients with indeterminate 
imaging findings. This study aimed to develop and interpret machine learning 
(ML) models for classifying adrenal lesions based on 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging and 
clinical parameters.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 255 patients undergoing 18 F-FDG PET/CT was 
analyzed. Imaging features-including adrenal SUVmax, SUVpeak, tumor diameter, CT 
attenuation, and tumor-to-liver SUVmax ratio (T/L SUVmax)-along with clinical 
variables were extracted. Two classification tasks were constructed: (1) 
differentiation of benign and malignant adrenal lesions; and (2) subtyping of 
malignant lesions into lung cancer metastases or lymphoma. Seven ML models were 
trained and evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. SHAP (SHapley Additive 
exPlanations) analysis was applied to elucidate feature contributions.
RESULTS: For the benign/malignant classification, ensemble models (Random 
Forest, Bagging, XGBoost) achieved outstanding performance (AUC > 0.99), with 
Bagging yielding 100% recall. T/L SUVmax, adrenal SUVmax, and CT attenuation 
emerged as top predictors. In malignancy subtyping, the artificial neural 
network (ANN) attained the highest AUC (0.887) and F1-score (0.851). SHAP 
analysis highlighted distinct metabolic patterns, with lymphoma showing higher 
SUVmax and T/L ratios, and lung metastases associated with higher CT values.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning models based on PET/CT-derived features enable 
highly accurate and interpretable classification of adrenal lesions. Integrating 
metabolic and anatomical parameters improves diagnostic precision, while SHAP 
analysis offers clinical transparency, supporting personalized decision-making 
in adrenal lesion management.

BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity is the coexistence of two or more chronic diseases, 
and in older adults is more common which can lead to increased rates of 
hospitalisation and health care. Therefore, this review aims to identify the 
variations in multimorbidity measurement in studies evaluating hospitalisation 
in older adults.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using a comprehensive database search 
in the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases, and included papers that used 
multimorbidity to evaluate hospitalisation in later life (PROSPERO register: 
CRD42021229328). Studies that employed multimorbidity measures with a simple 
count, weighted indices, Latent Class Analysis, Adjusted Clinical Groups System, 
Chronic Disease Score or Cumulative Index Illness Rating Scale were included. 
There was no restriction of language and year of publication of the studies 
included.
RESULTS: This review included 39 articles and was reported according to the 
PRISMA methodology. Analysing the variations in multimorbidity measurement 
related to hospitalisation in older adults we found a wide range of number of 
diseases, from 6 to 40, however, most of them utilised from 10 to 14 diseases. 
Regarding the data source, 56% of studies used self-reports, and 77% the disease 
count as a measure to assess multimorbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: This review revealed enormous heterogeneity in the number and type 
of diseases and diverse methodological criteria applied in studies that assessed 
multimorbidity associated with hospitalisation in older adults. Furthermore, the 
disease group most used in the studies was those of the circulatory system and 
the five diseases frequently included were diabetes, hypertension, cancer, 
stroke, and coronary heart disease.

BACKGROUND: The development of drug resistance in cancer is associated with 
multiple malignant properties, including proliferative progression, metastasis, 
and stemness. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) reportedly contribute to multidrug 
resistance in lung cancer. However, functional and mechanistic studies of key 
lncRNAs associated with lung cancer are lacking.
METHODS: Candidate lncRNA IGFL2-AS1 and its downstream target, the HSPA1A and 
RAP1 cascade, were identified using RNA sequencing. In vitro functional assays, 
including proliferation, clonal formation, Transwell migration, sphere 
formation, and drug sensitivity test, were conducted to explore the function of 
the IGFL2-AS1/HSPA1A axis in lung cancer. For in vivo functional validation, 
subcutaneous implantation and tail vein injection of luciferase-tagged lung 
cancer cells were performed in mouse models. Moreover, RNA pulldown, RNA 
immunoprecipitation (RIP), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and 
point/truncated mutations were utilized to dissect the mechanisms underlying the 
activation of the YBX1-mediated IGFL2-AS1/HSPA1A axis. Pharmacological 
inhibition of HSPA1A was performed to restore chemotherapy sensitivity and 
attenuate lung cancer cell metastasis in vivo. Finally, tissue microarray 
staining was employed to evaluate the expression of the 
YBX1/IGFL2-AS1/HSPA1A/RAP1 axis in lung cancer specimens and its correlation 
with prognosis.
RESULTS: IGFL2-AS1, stimulated by C/EBPβ, was aberrantly upregulated in 
chemoresistant cell lines and lung cancer specimens. IGFL2-AS1 promoted lung 
cancer proliferation, metastasis, drug resistance, and stemness by upregulating 
HSPA1A expression both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, IGFL2-AS1 
recruited YBX1 to the HSPA1A promoter, facilitating its transcription. 
Pharmacological inhibition of HSPA1A restored the sensitization of A549 cells 
resistant to cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil via the downstream RAP1 signaling 
cascade. Notably, the YBX1/IGFL2-AS1/HSPA1A axis was consistently activated in 
lung cancer specimens and correlated with poor patient prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the YBX1-modulated 
IGFL2-AS1/HSPA1A/RAP1 axis is aberrantly activated in lung cancer cells and is 
associated with unfavorable prognosis, highlighting its potential as a novel 
therapeutic target in clinical settings.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is highly prevalent in older gastric cancer patients and 
seriously affects their prognosis, but gastric cancer-related frailty 
interventions are rare currently. The purposes of this study are to explore the 
willingness and preference of demanders, implementers, and administrators of 
frailty interventions for older gastric cancer patients based on stakeholder 
perspectives, and to analyze possible resistance in the intervention process.
METHOD: Older gastric cancer patients hospitalized in a tertiary hospital in 
Jiangsu Province from April to August 2023, as well as some healthcare 
professionals and administrators in this hospital, were selected for qualitative 
interviews. Colaizzi 7-step analysis was used for coding, categorizing, and 
extracting data.
RESULTS: A total of 3 themes and 13 sub-themes were identified, including 
willingness to participate (Patients: very willing to participate in frailty 
interventions and eager to improve health conditions; Healthcare professionals: 
willingness to participate to improve patient health when time permits; Hospital 
administrators: willingness to participate in improving the health of patients 
as permitted by the hospital); preferences (Patients: preference for actionable, 
cost- and time-efficient interventions; Healthcare professionals: preference for 
staged, individualized, supervised interventions; Hospital administrators: 
preference for science-based, implementable, cost-effective interventions with 
oversight mechanisms); resistance (Patients: lack of self-awareness of health 
management, insufficient family support and fear of becoming the ""burden"", 
insufficient social support and ""no channel"" for counseling; Healthcare 
professionals: lack of frailty expertise and intervention experience, limited 
energy of personnel and easy to lack of motivation; Hospital administrators: 
lack of standardized management system for frailty, and lack of frailty 
intervention feedback-evaluation system).
CONCLUSION: Administrators need to identify needs and preferences under 
different positions, address resistance that affect the frailty interventions, 
and provide a reference basis for the implementation of frailty interventions.

BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections (SSIs) remain a significant cause of 
postoperative morbidity and are often associated with multidrug-resistant (MDR) 
organisms. This study aimed to isolate, identify, and evaluate the antibiotic 
susceptibility patterns of bacterial pathogens from postoperative wound 
infections in a tertiary care center.
METHODS: A postoperative cross-sectional study conducted on 104 wound swab 
samples were collected from patients aged 10-90 years who underwent surgeries 
including exploratory laparotomy, Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and Colectomy, 
Hernia, Ulcer, and Cancer surgeries. Bacterial identification was carried out 
using selective culture media and biochemical tests, while antimicrobial 
susceptibility testing was performed by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method in 
accordance with Clinical and laboratory standard institute (CLSI) guidelines.
RESULT: Out of 104 samples, 96 (92.31%) showed positive bacterial growth, while 
8 exhibited no growth. Among the culture-positive samples, Staphylococcus aureus 
was isolated in 18 cases (13.10%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in 24 
cases (17.40%). Further, 33.33% isolates of S. aureus and 37.50% isolates of the 
P. aeruginosa showed multidrug-resistant. However, antibiotic susceptibility 
testing revealed that S. aureus showed 100% sensitivity to linezolid and 72.22% 
sensitivity to tetracycline while P. aeruginosa showed 75% and 70.83% sensitive 
to ofloxacin and piperacillin, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Linezolid and ofloxacin emerged as the most effective agents against 
S. aureus and P. aeruginosa respectively. These findings highlight the 
importance of continuous antimicrobial resistance surveillance to guide 
appropriate empirical therapy for SSIs.

2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is a selective, low-volatility, systemic 
herbicide. It is used to control broadleaf weeds in certain crops, such as rice, 
corn, and wheat. The use of 2,4-D has become widespread in both the agricultural 
and industrial sectors, with the serious drawback that 2,4-D residues can 
contaminate food, soil, and groundwater sources. It has been classified as a 
group 2B carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. This 
paper proposes the development of a new alternative methodology to traditional 
techniques for the control and monitoring of 2,4-D in natural water samples from 
agricultural areas surrounding the Quinto River in the province of San Luis. The 
herbicide was quantified directly, in the presence of the anionic surfactant 
SDS, the systems were filtered through blue band filter paper as a solid 
support, prior to determination by solid surface fluorescence (SSF) 
(λexc = 555 nm; λem = 580 nm). Under optimal working conditions, a detection 
limit and a quantification limit of 0.33 and 0.90 ng L- 1, respectively, with a 
linearity range of 0.90 to 1.13 × 103 ng L- 1. The proposed methodology was 
applied to natural water samples from agricultural areas, adjacent to the Quinto 
River in the province of San Luis, representing an innovative alternative to 
conventional methods for 2,4-D monitoring. The concentrations found were near to 
3 ng L- 1. Additionally, among the advantages of the new method, it is important 
to highlight the generation of low volumes of waste, preserving the environment 
and thus contributing to some principles of green chemistry.

PURPOSE: Caregivers of patients with metastatic cancer may be exposed to an 
overwhelming sense of burden. Physical exercise may help patients improve their 
physical condition, manage symptoms, and enhance their quality of life. 
Nevertheless, it is unclear if these interventions may also likely affect 
caregivers.
METHODS: Five focus group (n = 20 participants) were conducted to explore the 
caregivers' experiences/perspectives of patients affected by metastatic cancer 
and performing a supervised physical exercise intervention. Thematic analysis 
using an inductive approach was performed. Theme, sub-themes, and illustrative 
quotes are displayed.
RESULTS: Four themes were identified. Theme 1 captured, with two sub-themes, the 
impact of the diagnosis on caregivers' emotional status and daily routines. 
Theme 2 was related to the perceived benefits of patients' engagement in the 
physical exercise program, enclosing three sub-themes (physical advantages, 
management of side effects, psychological well-being) and how this has helped 
caregivers enhance their emotional well-being. Theme 3 reported how caregivers 
have felt supported by the physical exercise program for the care of their loved 
ones (three-sub-themes: supervised by specialists, tailored and flexible 
program). Finally, theme 4 explained that caregivers, thanks to the patient's 
participation in the exercise, were able to take back control of their own 
lives, having more time available and enhancing their relationship with the 
patient.
CONCLUSION: Participation of patients with metastatic cancer in a structured 
physical exercise program may be effective in reducing caregiver's burden. This 
study may serve as a trailblazer to guide future investigations and consolidate 
the present findings.

Public health increasingly relies on digital infrastructures, yet data remains 
fragmented across clinical, behavioral, and social domains. Customer Data 
Platforms (CDPs), originally created in marketing to unify diverse information 
into dynamic individual profiles, could provide a new approach for 
person-centered public health. This article explores the strategic potential of 
applying CDP principles, such as data unification, identity resolution, 
segmentation, and timely intervention, to enhance surveillance, prevention, and 
chronic disease management. A conceptual framework is presented and demonstrated 
through a breast cancer screening scenario, illustrating how CDPs could enable 
personalized outreach and integration with artificial intelligence (AI). 
Although promising, there are significant challenges related to privacy, 
interoperability, fairness, and governance. Responsible deployment requires 
socio-technical strategies that emphasize transparency, ethical oversight, and 
person involvement.

INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related 
deaths worldwide. Its incidence has been rising in Africa due to urbanization 
and changing lifestyles. In Ethiopia, the lack of early diagnosis and 
specialized care places an additional burden on patients. Ostomy surgery, 
commonly used to manage advanced cases of colorectal cancer, significantly 
affects patients' quality of life. Despite the well-documented challenges, there 
is a limited number of studies investigating the experiences of Ethiopian 
colorectal cancer patients and their caregivers. This study aims to explore the 
impact of living with an ostomy on both patients and their caregivers.
METHODS: The qualitative descriptive study with a phenomenological approach was 
conducted from February to May 2024 at St. Paulo Comprehensive Specialized 
Hospital, Ethiopia. Purposive sampling was used to recruit adult colorectal 
cancer patients with ostomies and their caregivers. In-depth individual and 
shared interviews were conducted using a semi-structured guide. Data quality 
assurance was maintained and analyzed using thematic analysis guided by family 
systems theory.
RESULTS: A total of 28 participants (14 patients and 14 caregivers) were 
included in the study. Thematic analysis identified seven themes across three 
domains. From the patients' perspective, three themes emerged: psychological 
burden (altered self-image and confidence and sense of insecurity), daily 
challenges (routine care obstacles and lifestyle restrictions), and social 
detachment (self-stigmatization, self-imposed isolation, and identity loss). 
Caregivers highlighted two themes: role redefinition (practical challenges and 
loss of personal freedom) and caregiving burden (work-life balance and financial 
strain). Additionally, shared interviews with patients and caregivers revealed 
two further themes: challenges in communication (avoidance of difficult 
conversations and intimacy dynamics) and boundary negotiation (decision-making 
tension and evolving responsibilities).
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The current study described the experience of 
colorectal cancer patients with ostomies and their caregivers within a family 
systems theory framework while revealing cultural factors such as social 
detachment, identity loss, and self-imposed isolation. The findings call for 
culturally sensitive interventions that address both emotional and social 
challenges. It emphasizes the need for support systems that encourage social 
reengagement and open communication, with a focus on holistic care that 
considers cultural context.

Cognitive disorders related to cancer treatment, although common, remain 
under-recognized in clinical practice. Their assessment is hampered by a lack of 
standardized protocols, solid evidence and adapted resources. This study aims to 
explore the knowledge, perceptions and practices of oncologists concerning these 
disorders, from a patient quality of life perspective. A qualitative 
community-based research study was carried out with 20 oncologists practicing in 
France, recruited electronically. Semi-structured interviews explored four 
dimensions: caregiver-patient communication, information transmission, 
perceptions of cognitive impairment, and management strategies. A reflective 
thematic analysis was carried out, with the participation of 
patient-researchers. Oncologists recognize the existence of cognitive disorders 
as a possible side effect of treatment, but perceive them as multifactorial and 
often trivialized. These disorders are rarely discussed spontaneously, in the 
absence of an explicit complaint from the patient. Reported obstacles include a 
lack of training, a heavy workload, a shortage of specialized resources and 
diagnostic uncertainties. Interdisciplinary coordination remains limited. 
Post-treatment cognitive disorders represent a grey area in oncology practice. 
Their recognition and management require better training for professionals, 
systematic integration into quality-of-life assessments, and the development of 
structured care networks. It is recommended to create simple clinical tools, 
improve access to specialists, and raise awareness within healthcare teams. A 
patient-centered, multidisciplinary approach is essential to meet these 
challenges, which have yet to be fully addressed.

PURPOSE: This study analyzes gender differences in unemployment and 
return-to-work experiences among all patients with cancer in a nationwide 
cohort.
METHODS: Using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS), we 
analyzed 20,835 employed individuals (aged 15-59) newly diagnosed with cancer in 
2010. These individuals were followed annually for 6 years (2010-2016) to assess 
unemployment after diagnosis. Of the total, 5,524 patients experienced 
unemployment during the follow-up period. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox 
proportional hazards models were used to evaluate unemployment risk and its 
association with gender.
RESULTS: The hazard ratio (HR) for unemployment following cancer diagnosis is 
1.98 (95% CI, 1.85 to 2.11), indicating that women have a higher rate of job 
loss compared to men. Additionally, women were approximately 26% less likely to 
return to work after losing their jobs, highlighting significant gender 
disparities in employment outcomes among cancer survivors.
CONCLUSION: Employment is important for cancer survivors, but women are more 
vulnerable to job loss after a cancer diagnosis and less likely to return to 
work after losing their jobs, particularly those in lower-income groups.

BACKGROUND: Despite being among the most common cancer treatment-related side 
effects, taste disorders have received limited study, and their management 
remains challenging. Recent data have associated dysgeusia with decreased 
quality of life and increased mortality. We discuss here the state of the 
science on this topic and address clinical concerns and understudied 
therapeutics, with the aim of stressing the importance of this side effect and 
the need for effective treatment.
METHODS: We selected extant articles covering cancer therapy-associated 
dysgeusia in English language peer-reviewed literature from PubMed, Medline, 
Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases. We identified 368 articles, of which 92 
were reviewed in detail. The relevant publications have described heterogeneous 
populations and a multitude of clinical characteristics. The mechanisms of 
altered taste perception in cancer populations have not been completely 
elucidated, which in turn has impaired the development of potential 
interventions, including prevention and management.
CONCLUSION: Dysgeusia in cancer patients may be more relevant to treatment 
success and quality of life than previously accepted. Unfortunately, this topic 
has not been adequately addressed and requires further study.

BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that chemoradiotherapy may cause fibrosis of 
the internal anal sphincter, resulting in sclerosis. However, no report has 
quantitatively investigated this relationship by using real-time tissue 
elastography.
OBJECTIVE: To clarify the relationship between fibrosis and elasticity of the 
internal anal sphincter in patients undergoing surgery for lower rectal cancer 
with or without preoperative chemoradiotherapy from a histological perspective.
DESIGN: A single-center, prospective cohort study.
SETTINGS: The surgical and pathological departments in a tertiary referral 
university hospital.
PATIENTS: Eighteen patients with rectal cancer who underwent abdominoperineal 
resection between May 2019 and May 2022 were included in the study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Real-time tissue elastography was performed before 
surgery to measure internal anal sphincter hardness as ""elasticity"" (hardest (0) 
to softest (255); decreased elasticity indicated sclerotic changes). Internal 
anal sphincter fibrosis was evaluated using Masson's trichrome and Elastica van 
Gieson staining. We evaluated internal anal sphincter elasticity after 
preoperative chemoradiotherapy and preoperatively in patients who did not 
undergo preoperative chemoradiotherapy and analyzed the correlation with the 
percentage of internal anal sphincter fibrosis in the resected specimens.
RESULTS: Of the 18 patients, 10 underwent preoperative chemoradiotherapy. A 
significantly higher percentage of internal anal sphincter fibrosis was observed 
in the chemoradiotherapy group. Post-chemoradiotherapy elasticity was 
significantly lower in patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy compared to 
pre-chemoradiotherapy elasticity and that in patients not undergoing 
chemoradiotherapy. The analysis of the correlation between internal anal 
sphincter elasticity and fibrosis showed that elasticity decreased as the 
percentage of fibrosis increased.
LIMITATIONS: This study was conducted at a single institution, and the number of 
cases was small. The radiation dose to the anal canal may have differed 
depending on the location of the tumor, which may have affected internal anal 
sphincter elasticity.
CONCLUSIONS: Internal anal sphincter elasticity may reflect tissue sclerosis 
associated with fibrosis caused by chemoradiotherapy.

Intratumoral myeloid cells are highly heterogeneous in terms of development and 
function and are pivotal for forming and regulating the tumor microenvironment. 
However, the myeloid milieu in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains 
poorly understood. Here, to elucidate this myeloid milieu, we integrated 
in-house and public single-cell RNA sequencing data. We detected diverse 
neutrophil and mononuclear-phagocyte subtypes and delineated their developmental 
trajectories and functions. Of particular interest were the VEGFAhi neutrophil 
and SPP1hi macrophage subtypes, which displayed protumoral functions, including 
angiogenesis. Spatial transcriptomics revealed that they colocalized with 
epithelial cancer cells and APLNhi endothelial tip cells in a hypoxic region 
forming an angiogenic niche. Moreover, patients with SPP1hi macrophage-enriched 
TNBC showed poor prognosis, which worsened in patients who also displayed 
abundant VEGFAhi neutrophils. These subtypes were also conserved in multiple 
murine TNBC models. This comprehensive analysis of the myeloid population in 
TNBC thus reveals a previously undercharacterized interaction between VEGFAhi 
neutrophils and SPP1hi macrophages, elucidating their contributions in the 
formation of an angiogenic niche.

Genetic counselling (GC) for familial colorectal cancer (fCRC) has been 
previously shown to improve outcomes such as emotional distress and screening 
adherence. This is the first randomised clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy 
of GC for fCRC. We included individuals affected or at-risk for fCRC (Lynch 
syndrome, APC-associated polyposis, other risk-associated pathogenic variants 
and clinically defined fCRC). Participants were randomised to (1) standard care 
or (2) standard care and genetic counselling. Measures include empowerment, 
anxiety, depression, knowledge, emotional distress, perceived social support, 
risk perception. Eighty-two individuals participated in the study. The average 
age was 44.81 years old, with 52.4% women. There was a significant effect in the 
counselling group (42/82) on post-intervention empowerment scores compared to 
the control group (40/82) (p = 0.004, d = 0.71), and similarly for depression 
(p = 0.025, d = 0.40), anxiety (p = 0.036, d = 0.35) and knowledge (p = 0.016, 
d = 0.25). Exploratory analysis show that several sociodemographic, affective 
and cognitive variables are moderating the improvement in empowerment following 
genetic counselling. Our data show significant improvements for both primary 
endpoint (empowerment) and secondary endpoints (knowledge, depression, anxiety, 
emotional distress). Genetic counselling is an effective intervention for fCRC 
both when the diagnosis is part of a syndrome or clinically defined, and both 
for affected or at-risk individuals.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of intra-arterial 
177Lu-PSMA-radioligand therapy (RLT) in patients with liver-dominant metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients received up to six cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-RLT 
(median 7.4 GBq) at six-week intervals. Intra-arterial administration in the 
hepatic artery was off-label and indicated for patients with high hepatic tumour 
burden. Primary endpoints were safety (clinical and biochemical adverse events) 
and procedural feasibility. Exploratory efficacy endpoints were 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and imaging (PET) response.
RESULTS: Four patients received 16 cycles (10 intra-arterial, six intravenous). 
All intra-arterial procedures were technically successful and without 
periprocedural complications. Toxicity was acceptable and comparable to 
intravenous treatment, comprising mainly grade 1-2 clinical events with 
occasional grade 3 biochemical abnormalities, and no grade 4-5 clinical 
toxicities were observed. PSA decreases occurred in two patients (decrease 
24-99%), while two patients had increases. Imaging response was more profound 
for liver metastasis.
CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings suggest that intra-arterial 
177Lu-PSMA-RLT is feasible and safe in liver-dominant mCRPC. Prospective studies 
with dosimetry are warranted.

BACKGROUND: The majority of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases arise in 
patients with cirrhosis, with known major risk factors of hepatitis B (HBV) or C 
(HCV) infection, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease 
(MASLD), and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). However, the impact of 
additional risk factors that act independently or jointly on the pathogenesis of 
HCC in cirrhosis patients is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine 
whether sleep, sedentariness, or physical activity levels play a role in the 
progression of cirrhosis to HCC.
METHODS: We systematically collected data on sleep, sedentary time, and physical 
activity from the ongoing prospective study, the Texas HCC Consortium Cohort, 
which recruited patients with cirrhosis from December 2016 and followed up until 
HCC development, death, or May 2024. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using 
Fine-Gray competing risk regression models to evaluate the independent 
association between sleep, sedentary, and physical activity levels with the risk 
of HCC overall and in groups stratified by major HCC risk factors.
RESULTS: Of 3940 patients with cirrhosis (mean age = 59.9 years, 39.1% women), 
9.3% of patients had active HCV, 34.6% had MASLD, 41.5% had MetALD, and 3.2% had 
ALD only. In total, 208 patients developed incident HCC (annual incidence rate, 
2.37% [95% CI 2.07, 2.72%]). After adjustment for demographic and clinical 
factors, absent levels of light physical activity (HR = 0.92 [0.57-1.47]), 
excessive sitting time (HR = 0.91 [0.57-1.44]), and reduced sleep duration 
(HR = 0.92 [0.65-1.29]) were not associated with an increased risk of HCC 
development. There were no associations with increased risk of HCC development 
across all sub-groups examined.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the risk of HCC in patients with cirrhosis was not 
significantly affected by level of light physical activity, sedentariness, or 
sleep across all major etiologies of cirrhosis.

Gynecological cancer poses a serious threat to women's health. Despite 
significant advances in immunotherapy and targeted therapeutic strategies for 
gynecological cancers, substantial challenges persist, including limited 
response rates, inevitable resistance, and adverse effects. In recent years, a 
milestone in gynecological cancer therapy has been the approval of antibody-drug 
conjugates (ADCs). In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the 
structural features, mechanisms of action, and molecular characteristics of ADCs 
that have been approved and are currently under development. Their clinical 
applications and associated challenges have also been highlighted. Finally, we 
discuss the prospects of ADCs in the treatment of gynecological cancers.

Nitrosatable drugs can contribute to the endogenous formation of N-nitroso 
compounds (NOCs) in humans. NOCs are carcinogenic in animal systems. However, 
the relationship between nitrosatable drug exposure in pregnancy and childhood 
cancer risk remains inconclusive. Using the Taiwan Maternal and Child Health 
Database (N = 2,090,806), we conducted a population-based cohort study of 
mother-child pairs with children born 2004-2015, to investigate the link between 
exposure to nitrosatable drugs in pregnancy and childhood cancer risk among 
offspring. Prescriptions of nitrosatable drugs were obtained from the National 
Health Insurance Program, and cancer cases were ascertained through linkage to 
the Cancer Registry. Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to 
estimate both crude and adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence 
intervals (CI). Among 3203 cancer cases, nitrosatable drug exposure was 
associated with higher risks of neuroblastoma (aHR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.95-1.73) 
and hepatoblastoma (aHR = 1.49, 95% CI: 0.97-2.28). Neuroblastoma (aHR = 1.32, 
95% CI: 0.96-1.82) and osteosarcoma (aHR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.07-3.89) were most 
strongly associated with amides, while the risk of hepatoblastoma was highest 
among offspring of tertiary amine users (aHR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.00-2.46), 
compared to other functional groups. Some results may need to be interpreted 
with caution due to the wide confidence intervals. Our findings highlight the 
need for future research into the biological mechanisms between NOCs and 
childhood cancer.

The development and stability of induced regulatory T cells (iTregs) are 
essential for their immunosuppressive function and therapeutic potential in 
inflammatory diseases. Although Treg-based immunotherapy offers promise for 
restoring immune tolerance, clinical application is limited by the instability 
and reduced potency of iTregs. STAT6 signaling has been implicated in 
destabilizing Foxp3 expression, a key marker of Treg identity. Here, we 
investigated the impact of pharmacological STAT6 inhibition on iTreg 
differentiation, stability, and function both in vitro and in vivo. Naïve CD4⁺ T 
cells were differentiated into iTregs under standard conditions or expanded with 
IL-2 in the presence of the STAT6 inhibitor AS1517499 (AS-iTregs). STAT6 
inhibition enhanced iTreg stability, maintaining high expression of Foxp3, CD25, 
PD-1, and CTLA-4 for up to 10 days, even in inflammatory conditions. AS-iTregs 
also showed increased mRNA levels of Foxp3, IL-10, TGF-β, and PD-1, and reduced 
IL-6, IL-1β, and DNMT1 expression-suggesting improved functional and epigenetic 
stability. In the DSS colitis model, adoptive transfer of AS-iTregs alleviated 
disease severity, preserved mucosal architecture, and increased goblet cell 
numbers. Histopathological analysis showed reduced epithelial damage and 
inflammation compared to controls. Importantly, AS-iTregs did not promote tumor 
growth in a colitis-associated cancer model. Furthermore, in vivo administration 
of AS1517499 during acute colitis enhanced Treg expansion, activation, and 
suppressive function. These findings establish STAT6 inhibition as a promising 
approach to boost iTreg stability and efficacy, advancing the potential of 
Treg-based therapies for inflammatory disorders.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents a formidable subtype with a grim 
prognosis. This study aims to pinpoint the molecular targets of 
Glycosyltransferases (GTs) in TNBC, with the goal of improving prognostic 
accuracy and boosting the effectiveness of immune therapies. Using publicly 
available datasets, we combined differentially expressed and correlated genes 
based on AUCell scores from single-cell sequencing. These were then subjected to 
enrichment analysis and utilized for constructing a risk model. A total of 780 
genes were identified as being closely associated with GTs. Using 101 algorithm 
combinations, a 17-gene signature emerged with predictive capabilities for TNBC 
patient prognosis. At the same time, we examined the role of these model genes 
in the tumor microenvironment(TME). We identified key transcription factors 
correlating with GTs, including CREB3L1, which showed significant association 
with the CERCAM gene. Subsequently, the pro-cancerous effects of GTs were 
validated through a series of experiments, including CCK-8 cell viability 
assays, scratch wound healing assays, and Transwell migration and invasion 
assays. This research lays the foundation for targeted drug therapies, offering 
new opportunities to enhance clinical outcomes in TNBC.

The exploration of post-translational modifications (PTMs) within the proteome 
is pivotal for advancing our understanding of disease and the function of cancer 
therapeutics. However, identifying genuine sites of PTMs introduced or removed 
by an enzyme of interest amid numerous candidates is challenging. We present a 
machine learning (ML)-driven search method, which combines ML with 
enzyme-mediated modification of complex peptide arrays to predict unexplored PTM 
sites for an enzyme of interest. Experimental validation confirmed that this 
approach correctly predicted 37-43% of proposed PTM sites, unveiling candidate 
sites of the methyltransferase SET8 and the deacetylases SIRT1-7. Our approach 
marks an important performance increase over traditional in vitro methods across 
separate enzyme classes. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the dynamic 
methylation status of several predicted SET8 substrates, and the deacetylation 
of 64 unique sites identified for SIRT2. This method has also revealed changes 
in SET8-regulated substrate network among breast cancer missense mutations, 
collectively revealing insight into differential enzyme function in disease. By 
disentangling the substrate features that dictate PTM-inducing enzyme 
specificity, this approach demonstrates potential in uncovering enzyme-substrate 
networks within PTM pathways.

Gastric Cancer with Peritoneal Metastases: Why Patient-Reported Outcomes Matter 
in Clinical Trials.

Gastric cancer with peritoneal involvement is becoming increasingly common, 
particularly among younger patients with diffuse-type disease. This aggressive 
subtype carries a high symptom burden and severely impacts quality of life 
(QoL). Novel therapeutic strategies targeting peritoneal metastases, including 
normothermic intraperitoneal and systemic chemotherapy (NIPS), pressurised 
intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC), and cytoreductive surgery with 
HIPEC, are reshaping the treatment landscape. Among these, only NIPS has 
demonstrated a clear overall survival benefit, as shown in the phase III 
DRAGON-01 trial. PIPAC and CRS with HIPEC hold promise and are currently being 
investigated in randomised studies. However, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) 
remain inconsistently captured. For example, neither DRAGON-01 nor PHOENIX-GC 
reported QoL data despite their clinical impact. By contrast, PERISCOPE II and 
PIPAC VER-ONE have incorporated PRO measures, including EORTC QLQ-C30 and 
QLQSTO22, which are expected to provide more patient-centred insights. These 
instruments, while valuable, may not fully capture peritoneal-specific symptoms, 
highlighting the need for tailored tools. Routine integration and standardised 
reporting of PROs are critical to ensure that survival gains are accompanied by 
meaningful improvements in patient experience. As therapeutic strategies evolve, 
embedding PROs in trial design is essential for delivering value-based, 
patient-centred care in gastric cancer with peritoneal metastases. [KD1]LE:

BACKGROUND: Febrile neutropenia (FN) in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy 
can result in life-threatening outcomes. Hence, an evaluation of associated risk 
factors can enable clinical surveillance as well as inform prophylactic 
measures. In this retrospective cohort study, we report a mortality 
prognostication model for chemotherapy-treated cancer patients upon a 
neutropenic episode.
METHODS: Clinical and diagnostic data of 137 febrile neutropenia patients (>18 
years) was collected from a cancer hospital, with the primary endpoint of 
post-hospital admission mortality within 30 days. The data was integratively 
analyzed and machine learning techniques were applied to develop the predictive 
model which was then internally cross validated. Towards enabling personalized 
risk assessment, a nomogram was constructed and validated.
RESULTS: Chemotherapy-treated cancer patients undergoing a neutropenic episode 
exhibit an overall mortality rate of 17.36%. Multivariate logistic analysis 
elucidates that shock, pneumonia, carboplatin, doxorubicin, antifungal and 
anti-viral prophylaxis, and hemoglobin correctly classify cases with an overall 
accuracy of 92% and discriminate mortality with a specificity of 76%. Antiviral 
(odds ratio (OR): 0.669, p  =  0.689) and antifungal prophylaxis (OR: 0.619, 
p  =  0.5) demonstrate a protective effect. The receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve of the nomogram exhibits an area under the curve of 
0.878 (95% CI 0.778 - 0.977), Hosmer-Lemeshow test p-value = 0.635, and a high 
net benefit in the clinical decision curve.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model offers insights into the role of clinical 
predictors as well as treatment characteristics that can ameliorate mortality 
risk in cancer patients with FN. The study highlights bacteremia-related 
surveillance, along with thrombocytopenia, linked to carboplatin, for reducing 
individualized mortality risk along with improved monitoring and informed 
treatment strategies.

Plain Language Summary: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a life-threatening 
complication in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Clinical symptoms 
include fever and very low white blood cell counts, making it harder for the 
body to fight infections. For early detection of high-risk patients, we 
investigated the past medical records of FN and report that factors such as 
severe infections (like pneumonia), shock, and chemotherapeutic agents (such as 
carboplatin and doxorubicin) increase the risk of death. On the other hand, 
antifungal and antiviral treatments act to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. 
The proposed tool can help doctors identify high-risk patients faster and choose 
suitable treatments to improve survival.

PURPOSE: Epidemiological and microbiological characteristics of endogenous 
endophthalmitis (EE) can vary by population and geographical area, with 
different risk factors. This study from a tertiary care centre aimed to provide 
additional data from one European country in the field of EE.
METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted on patients diagnosed with EE at 
the University Hospital of Grenoble-Alpes, France, between 2014 and 2023. 
General and ocular clinical data, along with microbiological findings, were 
collected at baseline and on follow-up.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were diagnosed with EE in this study with a mean 
age of 70 ± 17.7 years, and 51.5% were male. Most cases were unilateral. Common 
health conditions included cancer, and diabetes mellitus, with endocarditis 
being the leading source of infection. Baseline visual acuity ranged from 20/20 
to no light perception. Blood cultures were positive in 87.8% of the cases. 
Gram-positive bacteria, especially Staphylococcus aureus, were the most common 
pathogens, followed by Candida albicans. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed in 
33% of the patients. At the end of the follow-up, four patients had lost vision, 
two developed phthisis, and mortality was reported in 24% of the patients.
CONCLUSION: This study on endogenous endophthalmitis highlights that, in Europe, 
the primary risk factors are cancer and diabetes, with endocarditis being the 
most common source of infection. According to our findings, Gram-positive 
bacteria, particularly Streptococcus species and Staphylococcus aureus, are the 
most frequently identified pathogens in Europe. These findings differ 
significantly from reports originating from the USA and Asia.

BACKGROUND: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a safe and minimally 
invasive procedure for early gastric cancer (EGC). However, little is known 
about the adverse events and prognosis of gastric ESD in much older adult 
patients with age-related comorbidities. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate 
factors associated with the adverse events and prognosis of ESD for EGC in 
patients ≥ 85 years.
METHODS: We enrolled 853 patients with 920 lesions ≥ 85 years old from 19 
institutions who underwent ESD for EGC between January 2006 and December 2020. 
We adapted the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) and analyzed the 
associations between GNRI and major adverse events post-ESD bleeding or 
perforation using logistic regression analysis. Subsequently, we performed the 
Cox proportional hazard model to elucidate whether age-related factors were 
associated with three-year overall survival.
RESULTS: GNRI was significantly related with post-ESD bleeding [odds ratio (OR), 
0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96-1.00, p = 0.003]. Age (hazard ratio 
(HR); 95% CI 1.12 [1.02-1.22], p = 0.002), male (2.29 [1.24-3.34], p = 0.005), 
ECOG-Performance status (1.31 [1.16-1.75], p = 0.006), Charlson Comorbidity 
Index (1.17 [1.03-1.33], p = 0.002), and poor GNRI (0.92 [0.90-0.94], p < 0.001) 
were significantly correlated with three-year overall survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional status was associated with post-ESD bleeding. 
Nutritional status and comorbidities were related with prognosis after gastric 
ESD. Therefore, indications of gastric ESD in patients ≥ 85 years old need to be 
considered with age-related comorbidities.

OBJECTIVE: Many patients with lung cancer have cancer cachexia, which may result 
in complications and affect prognosis; however, its preoperative prevalence is 
unknown. Skeletal muscle mass loss after lung cancer surgery also affects 
prognosis. Although cachexia and sarcopenia share some similarities, whether 
preoperative cachexia affects postoperative sarcopenia is still unknown. Thus, 
we designed a cohort study of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
to investigate this.
RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Patients with NSCLC who underwent surgery and 
perioperative rehabilitation were included in this study. The prevalence of 
preoperative cachexia and the association between preoperative cachexia and 
sarcopenia 1 month after surgery were tested using propensity-score matching. 
After matching, the regression analysis was performed to investigate whether 
preoperative cachexia was independently related to sarcopenia 1 month 
postoperatively.
RESULTS: In total, 126 patients (73 men) median age 71 (interquartile range 67, 
76) years were included in the study. Preoperative cachexia was present in 16 
(12.7%) patients, and postoperative sarcopenia was present in 29 (23%) patients. 
Among the 126 patients, 16 and 32 patients were included in the preoperative 
cachexia and control groups, respectively, as a result of matching (standardized 
mean difference < 0.1). After matching, regression analysis showed that 
preoperative cachexia was independently associated with sarcopenia at 1 month 
postoperatively (odds ratio 4.33, p = 0.020).
CONCLUSIONS: Among the patients with NSCLC, 12.7% had preoperative cachexia. 
Preoperative cachexia in patients with NSCLC affected sarcopenia 1 month 
postoperatively.

Lung cancer remains a major global health challenge, in part because the 
efficacy of current treatment modalities is reduced by drug resistance and 
substantial adverse effects. This study assessed the suitability of liposomes as 
a drug delivery system to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of docetaxel (DTX) 
and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) against lung cancer. DTX- and 
ATRA-encapsulated liposomes were synthesized and characterized, exhibiting 
desirable physicochemical properties such as an appropriate particle size, a 
negative surface charge, and high drug encapsulation efficiency. in vitro assays 
using A549 lung cancer cells demonstrated that these liposomes produced markedly 
greater cytotoxicity compared to free drugs; additionally, these two medications 
acted synergistically to enhance antitumor activity. Treatment with the 
liposomes resulted in upregulation of the pro-apoptotic gene Bax and 
downregulation of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2, indicating activation of 
apoptotic pathways. Furthermore, the liposomes inhibited cancer cell migration 
and invasion in vitro, suggesting that they could suppress tumor metastasis. 
Collectively, these findings provide evidence that liposomes containing DTX and 
ATRA possess favorable properties for the treatment of lung cancer and may 
overcome existing challenges to improve patient treatment outcomes. However, 
comprehensive in vivo studies are required to validate the efficacy and clinical 
potential of these nanocarriers.

Primary intracranial tumors make up ~ 2% of all cancer cases but contribute 
disproportionately to cancer-related morbidity and mortality. While spontaneous 
preclinical intracranial tumor models offer valuable insights into the 
mechanisms underlying primary tumor formation and progression, few have been 
identified to date. As such, tracking and characterizing spontaneous tumor 
development in aging laboratory animals represents an opportunity to advance 
preclinical research, while informing best practices for animal welfare. Here, 
we investigated intracranial tumor incidence and origin in a cohort of 
spontaneously hypertensive rats aged 20-24 months (SHRs; N = 60), initially 
intended for preclinical stroke experiments. Upon gross inspection, we 
identified large intracranial tumors in 30% of aged SHRs. Using histological, 
immunohistological, and ultrastructural methods, we found that ~ 89% of these 
tumors were pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), with an average tumor 
diameter of 6.7 ± 1.22 mm (mean ± 95% confidence interval). These pituitary NETs 
displayed rapid growth, invasive behavior, and aggressive proliferation, as 
indicated by Ki67 staining. Our results reveal a predisposition in aged SHRs to 
develop aggressive pituitary NETs, providing a diagnostic and pathological 
foundation for future mechanistic and translational studies, while emphasizing 
the need for enhanced surveillance and care in aging laboratory animal 
populations.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) provides complete genetic information in one test, 
supporting the shift towards individualized metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) 
treatment. Although WGS is validated as a diagnostic test, the potential 
clinical implications for mCRC remain unknown. We evaluated the clinical 
consequences of WGS in 96 mCRC patients. Clinically actionable biomarkers were 
identified by a molecular biologist and medical oncologist, with added value 
defined as biomarkers undetected by standard diagnostics. We evaluated how these 
biomarkers informed treatment decisions. We used patient-derived organoids 
(PDOs) to test drug sensitivity to MET, MEK, and CDK4/6 inhibitors, translating 
genomic findings into functional evidence. WGS yields biomarkers with clinical 
implications in 81% of patients, with 49% (N = 47/96) identified by WGS that 
were not detected by guideline-based diagnostics, and 40% (N = 38/96) not 
detected by applied diagnostics. The proportion of patients receiving 
biomarker-based treatment has increased from 11% to at least 24% by WGS. PDOs 
with actionable biomarkers showed clear differential response to different 
biomarker-based treatments. WGS enables considerably more personalized 
therapeutic interventions and represents a promising approach in advancing 
precision oncology for mCRC patients. PDO pre-screening can refine therapy by 
identifying (in)effective treatments in a patient-specific context, to 
accelerate the development of personalized treatment.

As cancer treatments improve, hypertension has become a frequent comorbidity 
among cancer survivors. While it may result from the cancer itself or its 
treatment, the impact of hypertension on cancer recurrence remains poorly 
understood. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the 
association between hypertension and the risk of recurrence of solid cancers in 
adult survivors. We searched four major databases including PubMed, Embase, Web 
of Science and the Cochrane Library for relevant studies involving adult cancer 
survivors who had completed initial treatment for solid tumors. The primary 
outcome was recurrence risk in hypertensive versus normotensive individuals, 
assessed using hazard ratios (HRs) pooled through a random-effects model. 
Heterogeneity across studies was assessed using the I² statistic. Of 1337 
records screened, 13 observational studies including 15 cohorts comprising 
50,549 participants met the inclusion criteria. In the overall analysis, 
hypertension was not significantly associated with an increased risk of solid 
tumor recurrence (HR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.97-1.22; I² = 49%). Subgroup analyses 
showed a significant association in colorectal cancer (HR: 1.18; 95% CI: 
1.02-1.36; I² = 27%), but not in breast (HR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.86-1.40; I² = 40%) 
or prostate cancer (HR: 1.12; 95% CI: 0.91-1.38; I² = 53%). However, no 
significant difference was found across subgroups (P = 0.18). These findings 
suggest a potential link between hypertension and recurrence in specific 
cancers, particularly colorectal cancer. Comprehensive blood pressure control 
may play a key role in the long-term management of cancer survivors.

Atypical intraductal proliferation (AIP) is considered a borderline lesion, 
characterized by architectural complexity and cytological atypia greater than 
that seen in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, but insufficient to 
fulfil the diagnostic criteria for intraductal carcinoma (IDC). Consequently, 
AIP remains diagnostically challenging, and the clinical significance of this 
lesion is still uncertain. Emerging evidence suggests that AIP in prostate 
biopsy specimens is a strong predictor of unsampled IDC and other adverse 
pathological features, warranting reconsideration of the AIP role in prostate 
cancer risk stratification. Results from prospective and molecular studies 
indicate that AIP frequently coexists with intermediate-risk prostate cancer and 
shares molecular alterations with IDC, such as PTEN loss and ERG overexpression, 
reinforcing AIP potential as a marker of occult aggressive disease. Considering 
the growing emphasis on precision diagnostics and active surveillance in 
prostate cancer management, understanding the implications of AIP is 
particularly relevant.

BACKGROUND: Profilin-2 (PFN2) is implicated in cancer metastasis, yet its 
significance in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is unclear.
METHODS: We quantified PFN2 mRNA and protein in 236 OSCC tumours using qRT-PCR 
and immunohistochemistry, correlating findings with clinicopathology and 
survival. Gain- and loss-of-function studies were performed in OSCC cell lines 
and xenograft mice. RNA sequencing with gene-set enrichment, subcellular 
fractionation, and immunofluorescence delineated PFN2-dependent pathways. 
Sensitivity to the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA was assessed in 
vitro.
RESULTS: High PFN2 expression correlated with lymph-node metastasis, stage IV 
disease, and poorer overall and disease-free survival (p < 0.01). PFN2 increased 
proliferation, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro, 
and accelerated primary tumour growth plus cervical/lung metastasis in vivo; 
knockout produced opposite effects. Transcriptomics revealed enrichment of EMT, 
E2F, G2/M, and hypoxia signatures, with a 44% overlap with HDAC1 targets. PFN2 
shifted HDAC1 to the cytoplasm and downregulated NuRD partners MBD3/MTA1 without 
altering total HDAC1. PFN2-driven EMT was independent of β-catenin nuclear 
entry. PFN2 overexpression sensitized cells to SAHA, enhancing G2/M arrest, 
apoptosis, and invasion blockade.
CONCLUSIONS: PFN2 is an oncogenic driver that promotes OSCC progression through 
HDAC1-dependent transcriptional reprogramming. PFN2 may serve as a prognostic 
biomarker and predictor of response to HDAC-targeted therapy.

Cancer metastasis involves a complex cascade of events, where cancer cells 
migrate from their site of origin to secondary sites via the lymphatic and 
circulatory system. During this process, some cancer subclones will successfully 
'seed' at distant organs to generate lethal metastases. Here, we optimised a 
method for tracking cancer cells in metastatic breast cancer tumours and 
investigated their complex interplay with the lung vasculature using 
lentiviral-based optical barcoding (LeGO). Given the regional heterogeneity in 
lung tissue microenvironments as well as lobar asymmetry, we used light sheet 
microscopy to perform three-dimensional (3D) imaging of wholemount lung lobes. 
The results revealed that polychromatic metastases occurred less frequently than 
monochromatic metastases and were more likely to be located nearer to blood 
vessels in both spontaneous (i.e. mammary fat pad injections) and experimental 
(i.e. tail vein injections) mouse assays of metastasis. This 3D imaging and 
analytic pipeline can provide unique insights about metastatic heterogeneity and 
dynamics, and represents a new avenue for studying therapeutic response across 
large volumes of lung tissue.

PD-L1 serves as the ligand for the immune inhibitory checkpoint protein PD-1, 
and its expression in tumors can be induced by interferon-γ (IFN-γ), leading to 
immune evasion. While JAK/STAT signaling is known to mediate IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 
expression, the mechanisms governing the negative regulation of PD-L1 in 
response to IFN-γ remain largely unclear. Here, we find that the E3 ubiquitin 
ligase TRIM11 is significantly stabilized to block the induction of PD-L1 upon 
treatment with IFN-γ. TRIM11 functions as a tumor suppressor by enhancing 
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity and potentiating antitumor immunity within 
the local tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, TRIM11 and JAK1 interact and 
mutually regulate each other through post-translational modifications in 
response to IFN-γ stimulation. JAK1 phosphorylates TRIM11, leading to its 
stabilization and activation by reducing K48-linked polyubiquitination and 
subsequent proteasomal degradation. Meanwhile, TRIM11 inhibits JAK1 through 
K63-linked polyubiquitination, thereby suppressing downstream JAK/STAT 
signaling, particularly reducing PD-L1 expression. This enhances CTL activity 
and bolsters antitumor effects in the presence of IFN-γ. Moreover, low 
expression of TRIM11, IFN-γ, and CD8+ T cells correlates with poor prognosis in 
patients, while TRIM11 expression levels could predict sensitivity to immune 
checkpoint blockade therapy. These findings define a role for the TRIM11/JAK1 
axis in IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression, suggesting its potential as a 
therapeutic target to enhance cancer immunotherapy.

Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling in the tumor microenvironment 
predicts resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). While TGF-β inhibition 
enhances ICB efficacy in murine cancer models, clinical trials have yet to 
demonstrate benefit, underscoring the need to better understand its 
immunoregulatory roles across disease contexts. Using mouse models of advanced 
colorectal cancer and patient-derived data, we demonstrate that TGF-β impairs 
antitumor immunity at multiple levels in liver metastases. It acts directly on T 
cells to block recruitment of peripheral memory CD8+ T cells, thereby limiting 
the effectiveness of ICB. Concurrently, TGF-β instructs tumor-associated 
macrophages to suppress clonal expansion of newly arrived T cells by inducing 
SPP1 expression. This extracellular matrix protein promotes collagen deposition 
and accumulation of tumor-associated macrophages and fibroblasts, ultimately 
driving ICB resistance. Our findings reveal how TGF-β coordinates 
immunosuppressive mechanisms across innate and adaptive immune compartments to 
promote metastasis, offering new avenues to improve immunotherapy in colorectal 
cancer.

Metabolic syndrome is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
progression, yet the role of metabolic syndrome-related genes in HCC remains 
incompletely understood. Using bioinformatics approaches, we investigated the 
influence of these genes on HCC prognosis and tumor biology. Two distinct 
patient clusters (C1 and C2) were identified based on metabolic gene expression, 
with C2 exhibiting poorer survival, increased stemness, and higher risk scores. 
A risk model further revealed that high-risk patients had worse outcomes, 
elevated immunosuppressive cell infiltration, and distinct phenotypic features. 
Experimental validation via qRT-PCR confirmed upregulation of risk model genes 
(particularly KIAA1841 and TUBA1B) in HCC cell lines and patient blood samples. 
Notably, post-surgical declines in KIAA1841 and TUBA1B levels were observed. Our 
findings highlight the clinical relevance of metabolic syndrome-related genes in 
HCC, linking them to prognosis, tumor microenvironment remodeling, cancer 
stemness, and immunotherapy response.

Management of advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer 
after progression on endocrine therapy plus CDK4/6 inhibitors is challenging due 
to mutational heterogeneity. Current therapies yield limited efficacy, achieving 
4-6 months PFS. FGFR signaling is implicated in resistance to endocrine plus 
CDK4/6 inhibitors, but FGFR inhibitors have shown limited activity in unselected 
populations. Co-clinical trials bridge preclinical and clinical findings, 
optimize resources, and enable biomarker identification. Using patient-derived 
organoids (PDOs), we demonstrated that FGFR-amplified PDOs respond to 
fulvestrant, palbociclib, and rogaratinib only when PIK3CA and ESR1 are 
wild-type. In a dose-escalation trial pre-screening 66 patients with 
FGFR1/2-amplification (FISH) and/or overexpression (RNAScope) patients, >40% 
harbored FGFR alterations. Nine patients were enrolled; the combination showed 
activity specifically in PIK3CA- and ESR1-wild type patients (9.1 vs. 1.9 months 
PFS; P = 0.0005). Toxicity was manageable and consistent with prior data. Our 
findings highlight biomarker-driven approaches as essential for refining 
FGFR-targeted strategies in this resistant population.

Diagnosis of bone cancer using histopathology images is essential for effective 
and timely treatment. However, contemporary diagnostic methods struggle to 
achieve high accuracy and interpretability while utilizing computational 
methods. Although existing methodologies in deep learning are promising, each 
suffers from significant limitations that arise from fundamental challenges in 
hyperparameter optimization, explainability, and generalizability across 
disparate datasets. Such disadvantages serve as barriers to clinical use, 
underscoring the need for a more reliable and comprehensible diagnostic 
framework. In this study, an Optimized Deep Learning Framework for Bone Cancer 
Detection (ODLF-BCD) algorithm is proposed by jointly combining Enhanced 
Bayesian Optimization (EBO), deep transfer learning from state-of-the-art 
pre-trained models (i.e., EfficientNet-B4, ResNet50, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, 
and VGG16), and explainable artificial intelligence, namely Grad-CAM and SHAP. 
It mitigates the state-of-the-art limitations through hyperparameter tuning, 
increased transparency, and data augmentation to balance the dataset. Extensive 
experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, where 
EfficientNet-B4 achieves 97.9% and 97.3% for binary and multi-class 
classification, respectively. Its performance is also confirmed with high 
precision, recall, and F1 score. Explainability facilitates the clinical 
interpretability of model predictions. Then, the proposed framework offers a 
robust and efficient alternative solution to the C-RAD, automating bone cancer 
diagnosis and enhancing the accuracy and transparency of the diagnosis. Its 
potential usefulness could provide clinicians with strong decision support 
systems for early and precise cancer detection.

Solid tumors like lung cancer show significant mutational heterogeneity. A 
biopsy captures only focal aspects, limiting conclusions about overall tumor 
biology. This prospective study correlated CT-based radiomics features with 
genomic profiles to optimize biopsy site selection. Lung cancer patients 
underwent CT imaging, radiomics analysis, targeted biopsies, and whole-exome 
sequencing. Twelve non-redundant features were extracted, with JointEntropy 
guiding biopsy targeting. In 7 of 12 patients, over 10% of mutations were 
exclusive to one biopsy. Clonal reconstruction showed heterogeneous profiles 
with over two subclonal processes in 67% of cases. Unsupervised clustering of 
radiomics features revealed two distinct groups separated by entropy features, 
of which the entropy-rich cluster was associated with STK11 mutations. Our study 
demonstrates that integrating radiomics with localized genomic analysis enhances 
the understanding of tumoral heterogeneity and may improve the targeting of 
advanced tumor regions for diagnostic sampling.

In human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive early breast cancer 
(EBC) patients, with residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
(NACT) plus HER2-targeted therapy, the KATHERINE trial demonstrated a 50% 
reduction in risk of recurrence or death with adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine 
(T-DM1) versus trastuzumab. A retrospective bicentric cohort study was set to 
assess the real-world efficacy and safety of T-DM1 as adjuvant therapy in 
HER2-positve EBC patients treated at Institut Curie Hospitals. N = 102 patients 
consecutively treated from September 2019 to January 2021 were included. All 
patients had previously received neoadjuvant trastuzumab (plus pertuzumab in one 
patient) and chemotherapy, N = 95 (93%) with anthracyclines. Post-neoadjuvant 
residual cancer burden was RCB I, II and III in N = 28 (27%), 62 (61%) and 11 
(11%) patients, respectively, while N = 70 (69%) had an estrogen 
receptor-positive disease. After a median follow-up of 44 months (range 4.5-54), 
N = 7 (7%) patients experienced distant tumor recurrence, including central 
nervous system (CNS) metastases in N = 5 patients, leading to death in N = 2 
patients, while no local recurrence was reported. The 4-years disease-free 
survival (DFS) rate was 92.5% (95%CI=[87;98]), lymph node involvement at 
diagnosis (cN+) being the only factor associated with a higher risk of relapse 
(p = 0.025, no event in the node negative group in our population). Dose 
reductions of T-DM1 were required in N = 34 patients (33%) after a median of 5 
cycles, mainly because of peripheral neuropathy (N = 14), increased alanine 
and/or aspartate aminotransferase level (N = 9), and thrombopenia (N = 6). 
Adverse event leading to drug discontinuation occurred in N = 23 patients (23%), 
after a median of 9 cycles, mostly peripheral neuropathy (N = 10) and 
thrombopenia (N = 9). Grade 3-4 toxicity affected N = 9 patients (9%), with no 
related death to T-DM1. With a low relapse rate and although more dose 
reductions and treatment discontinuation were observed in our cohort, our 
results are consistent with those of the KATHERINE trial. CNS as the most 
frequent site of relapse points to a potential role for drugs with higher 
activity against CNS metastases.

Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2) is a novel treatment target for patients with 
unresectable or stage IV gastric cancer. However, it remains unclear whether the 
expression of CLDN18.2 affects survival outcomes. In total, 586 patients with GC 
were enrolled in this study. CLDN18.2 expression in cancer cells was analyzed by 
immunohistochemistry. Correlations between CLDN18.2 expression and several 
clinicopathological factors and survival outcomes were investigated. We also 
performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis. CLDN18.2 expression was 
mainly observed in the cell membrane. The CLDN18.2 expression was not 
significantly correlated with any clinicopathological factor. In all patients, 
CLDN18.2 did not significantly affect OS. In patients with the diffuse type, the 
overall survival of patients with CLDN18.2-high expression was worse than that 
of patients with CLDN18.2-low expression, although the difference was not 
significant (p = 0.092). Meta-analyses revealed that CLDN18.2 was not 
significant prognostic factor in resected cases, although CLDN18.2 negative 
cases showed a trend for worse survival. In, conclusion, CLDN18.2 was not a 
significant prognostic factor in general, although CLDN18.2 negative cases 
showed a trend for worse survival. We revealed that patients with CLDN18.2 high 
expression showed worse survival outcomes especially in the diffuse type.

Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) with multinodular morphology were typically 
polyclonal and exhibited extensive heterogeneity. We explored the multiple-layer 
heterogeneity of HCC utilizing single-cell multiomics sequencing together with 
multiregional sampling. We found that Confluent Multi-Nodular samples exhibit 
more heterogeneous immune landscapes characterized by increased transcriptome 
heterogeneity and more complex immune-related interactions compared to Single 
Nodular (SN) samples. We identified differential DNA methylation patterns among 
distinct tumor foci in a subset of liver cancer patients. Global DNA 
hypomethylation in cancer cells predominantly occurs in partially methylated 
domains. We predicted and validated two genes, GADD45A and SNHG6, as potential 
drivers of DNA hypomethylation. Lastly, we demonstrated that DNA methylation 
distance serves as a more robust metric than gene expression distance for 
reconstructing tumor evolutionary trajectories.

Breast cancer remains the most prevalent malignancy among women worldwide. 
Emerging evidence suggests that trace elements, particularly selenium (Se) and 
mercury (Hg), may contribute to breast cancer pathogenesis. This study aimed to 
evaluate whether variations in Se and Hg levels in biological matrices are 
associated with breast cancer stage, related hematological changes and 
mammographic density. A case-control study was conducted including 285 
histologically confirmed breast cancer patients and 215 age-matched controls. 
Biological samples (scalp hair and blood) were analyzed via atomic absorption 
spectrometry. Normality was tested (Shapiro-Wilk); parametric (t test, ANOVA) or 
nonparametric (Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis) tests were applied 
accordingly, with Tukey/Dunn post hoc corrections. Compared with controls, 
breast cancer patients presented significantly lower Se levels and higher Hg 
levels across all stages. For example, the Se concentration in Stage IV hair was 
0.25 µg/g (95% CI 0.23-0.27) and that in control hair was 1.59 µg/g (95% CI 
1.54-1.64) (t = - 46.2, p < 0.001; Hedges g = - 5.12). The hair Hg concentration 
was 4.31 µg/g (95% CI 4.24-4.38) vs. 1.19 µg/g (95% CI 1.17-1.21) (t = 84.7, 
p < 0.001; Hedges g = + 7.05). The blood Se concentration decreased 
progressively from 220.0 ± 8.2 µg/L in the controls to 51.3 ± 5.8 µg/L in Stage 
IV (p < 0.001), whereas the blood Hg concentration rose from 0.97 ± 0.05 to 
2.94 ± 0.11 µg/L (p < 0.001). Hemoglobin levels also decreased with stage 
(12.7 ± 1.2 g/dL for controls vs. 5.62 ± 0.38 g/dL for Stage IV patients, 
p < 0.001). These findings demonstrate a consistent association between low Se 
and high Hg levels and advanced breast cancer stage and hematological decline. 
Notably, Se levels fell below the 70 µg/L GPx3 sufficiency threshold, whereas 
hair Hg levels exceeded the 2 µg/g toxicological guidance threshold, 
underscoring the clinical relevance of Se. While causal inference is limited, 
these results suggest that Se and Hg imbalances may serve as biomarkers for 
progression. These findings should be interpreted in light of international data 
where Se deficiency is rare, highlighting population-specific risks.

Spirulina platensis (S. platensis) is a natural microalgae extract that exerts 
significant cytotoxic effects against different serious cancerous diseases. Lung 
cancer is one of the most common and leading causes of death all over the world. 
The purpose is to investigate the anti-proliferative cytotoxic effects of S. 
Platensis against the adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells 
(A549 cell line). Also, molecular docking Analysis and pathway Map were 
investigated. The viability of the cells was determined via the MTT assay. 
Moreover the lipid peroxidation, total thiol, the protein concentration of 
Microtubule-associated tumor suppressor 1 (MTUS1), P16, Kirsten rat sarcoma 
viral oncogene homolog (K-ras), the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr), and 
the molecular parameters (short stature homeobox 2 (SHOX2), Breast cancer 
metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), and Bcl-2-associated 
X protein (BAX) were assessed. In order to define interaction sites and classes, 
the current study investigates in detail the interactions between the ligand S. 
platensis and the Interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3 Receptor (IL-F3) of lung 
cancer. Covalent bonds, H-bonds, and hydrophobic interactions were observed to 
form with critical residues on the active site. Covalent bonds are identified in 
seventeen of the complexes. A correlation was observed between binding affinity 
and molecular size, branching, polar surface area of up to 199 Å2, 
hydrophilicity, and topological diameter for various bonds. In an effort to 
enhance pharmaceutical quality control, we utilized in silico methodologies to 
forecast the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and 
toxicity) of S. platensis. Results revealed a great anti-proliferative cytotoxic 
effect with a concentration gradient through decreasing the peroxidation 
content, and the epigenetic markers, with significant up-regulations of the 
BRMS1 and BAX. In addition to the kinetic and MAP pathways, docking analysis 
confirmed that S. platensis binds with the highest affinity to the predicted 
active sites of the tumor receptor IL-F3, thereby validating its antitumor 
activity. In conclusion, great suppression in the virulence of lung cancer was 
reported following treatment with S. platensis, illustrating its suspected 
mechanism of action, safety profile, kinetic properties, molecular docking 
results, toxicity, and internal pathways.

Bronchiectasis is a complex, heterogeneous inflammatory chronic respiratory 
disease with an unknown etiology. In the context of increasingly severe drug 
resistance, there is an urgent need to explore new treatment strategies. 
Apigenin is a natural flavonoid compound with significant anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidant activities. This study aims to investigate the material basis and 
related pharmacological mechanisms of apigenin in the treatment of 
bronchiectasis using network pharmacology and molecular docking technology. The 
components and related targets of apigenin were searched using the TCMSP 
database. The SMILES numbers of each component of apigenin were obtained from 
the PubChem database, and the targets of each component were predicted using 
SwissTargetPrediction. All targets of the apigenin components were integrated. 
Targets related to bronchiectasis were retrieved and integrated from the 
GeneCards, TTD, and OMIM databases. The intersection targets of apigenin and 
bronchiectasis were identified using Venny 2.1.0 software. A protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network was constructed and analyzed for topology using the 
String database platform and Cytoscape 3.10.3 software to screen out the main 
core targets. Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were 
performed on the intersection targets using the David database. The binding 
activity between apigenin and the main core targets was tested using molecular 
docking technology. A total of 166 targets of apigenin and 2018 targets of 
bronchiectasis were screened, with 54 intersection targets identified between 
apigenin and bronchiectasis. The main core targets for apigenin in treating 
bronchiectasis were AKT1, MMP9, PARP1, SRC, and PTGS2. GO functional enrichment 
and KEGG pathway analyses yielded 380 GO entries (P < 0.05) and 111 signaling 
pathways (P < 0.05). These included 247 biological process entries, 35 cellular 
component entries, and 98 molecular function entries, primarily involving the 
PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, Chemokine signaling pathway, Lipid and 
atherosclerosis, Pathways in cancer, among others. Molecular docking results 
indicated that the binding energies between apigenin and these five core 
targets: AKT1, MMP9, PARP1, SRC, and PTGS2 were - 8.3 kcal/mol, -9.6 kcal/mol, 
-9.0 kcal/mol, -7.8 kcal/mol and - 8.8 kcal/mol, respectively, suggesting 
favorable binding activity between apigenin and the main core 
targets. Conclusion: From the perspective of network pharmacology and molecular 
docking technology, this study links apigenin to bronchiectasis at the molecular 
level for the first time. It systematically reveals the potential of apigenin to 
treat bronchiectasis through multiple targets and pathways. This provides a 
theoretical basis for in-depth exploration of the mechanism of apigenin in 
treating bronchiectasis and lays a foundation for subsequent experimental 
validation and clinical translation.

Mechanisms linking exercise to reduced breast cancer risk are poorly understood. 
103 healthy women, 18-75, were randomized to 45-minutes of acute exercise at 60% 
VO2max (N = 54, intervention), or 45-minutes of rest (N = 49, control). Blood 
samples were collected at baseline, 45- and 105-minutes, analytes measured by 
immunoassay, and mean changes from baseline to 45- and 105-minutes modelled 
using generalized estimating equations, adjusted for confounders. Mean percent 
changes levels (Δ%) increased in exercisers vs. controls for monocyte 
chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 Δ45 min + 17.1% (P < 0.0001), Δ105 min + 12.0% 
(P = 0.005); interleukin(IL)-6, Δ45 min + 103.5%, Δ105 min + 92.3%; and at 
45-minutes for glucose Δ45 min + 8.8%; insulin Δ45 min + 82.4% (all P < 0.0001). 
Differences between arms for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
Δ45 min + 9.8%; c-reactive protein Δ45 min-6.6%; irisin Δ45 min-5.1%; or 
plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, Δ45 min-3.6% were non-statistically 
significant, with similar results at 105-minutes. Results suggest that acute 
exercise has specific effects on circulating metabolic and inflammatory 
biomarkers, implicated in breast cancer etiology, which differ from 
weight-loss-induced changes. Trial registration: Clincialtrials.gov identifier 
NCT03779867.

This real-world, multicenter study evaluated trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in 
64 patients with HR-negative, HER2-low metastatic breast cancer between May 2022 
and May 2025. The median lines of therapy were 3 (range 1-7). The objective 
response rate (ORR) was 35.9%, and the disease control rate was 75%. Median 
real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) and overall survival were 5.0 
months and 14.9 months, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified brain 
metastases and prior Trop-2 ADC treatment as independent predictors of shorter 
rwPFS. The most common adverse events were nausea (71.9%), fatigue (39.1%), 
anorexia (31.3%), and neutropenia (31.3%). Grade 3/4 adverse events were 
primarily neutropenia (9.4%), thrombocytopenia (7.8%), and nausea (3.1%). 
Despite lower ORRs in patients with BRCA1 mutations or MYC amplifications, the 
differences were not statistically significant. This study confirms the clinical 
efficacy and manageable safety profile of T-DXd in this population, identifying 
high-risk subgroups and potential resistance biomarkers to inform treatment 
decisions.

This study investigates the phytochemical composition and biological activities 
of five ethnomedicinal plants: Zingiber officinale (Ginger), Ocimum basilicum 
(Basil), Origanum syriacum (Za'atar), Origanum vulgare (Oregano), and Salvia 
rosmarinus (Rosemary). These plants are traditionally used for their therapeutic 
properties, yet a comparative evaluation of their bioactivities is limited. 
Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were quantified using standard 
colorimetric assays. Antimicrobial activity was assessed against selected 
bacterial and fungal strains using the agar well diffusion method. Antioxidant 
capacity was evaluated via the DPPH assay, and cytotoxicity was tested on 
HCT-116 (colorectal cancer) and HNO-97 (tongue carcinoma) cell lines using MTT 
assays. Rosemary exhibited the highest phenolic content (189.28 mg/g), while 
Ginger had the highest flavonoid content (43.13 mg/g). Rosemary demonstrated the 
strongest antibacterial activity, notably against S. aureus (31 ± 0.5 mm), and 
Oregano showed significant inhibition against S. enterica (23 ± 0.1 mm). In 
antifungal assays, Rosemary had the largest inhibition zones against A. flavus 
(40 ± 0.6 mm) and A. niger (36 ± 0.3 mm). Basil and Za'atar also exhibited 
notable antifungal activity. Rosemary showed moderate antioxidant activity with 
an IC50 value of 37.42 µg/mL. Cytotoxicity testing revealed IC50 values of 
14.91 µg/mL and 22.3 µg/mL for Rosemary against HCT-116 and HNO-97 cells, 
respectively. The findings highlight S. rosmarinus as a potent source of 
antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer compounds. The diverse phytochemical 
profiles and bioactivities across the studied plants suggest that each offers 
unique therapeutic potential. These results support further investigation into 
their clinical applications, particularly concerning bioavailability, mechanisms 
of action, and potential synergistic effects.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) offers an in vivo approach to activate CD8+ 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD8+TILs) in cases of advanced non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC). A large fraction of NSCLC patients is unresponsive to ICBs 
and relapse due to the development of dysfunctional CD8+TILs with impaired 
cytotoxicity. Therefore, an improved understanding of regulator(s) that favor 
the development of cytotoxic Teff cells over dysfunctional CD8+TILs is required 
for the success of ICB therapy in NSCLC patients. Here, our metaVIPER-based 
scRNA-seq analysis of deep CD8+ cell scRNA-seq data from 14 treatment-naïve 
NSCLC patients revealed that the master regulon ZEB2 may drive CD8+ 
differentiation along the cytotoxic effector trajectory in NSCLC tumors. In 
vitro, ZEB2 acts downstream of T-bet to stimulate lung tumor-reactive Teff cell 
differentiation. This T-bet/ZEB2 axis displays immunotherapeutic effects on 
KP.SIY lung tumors independent of ICB therapy and mediates the therapeutic 
effects of murine serum albumin-fused IL-2 + IL-12 combination immunotherapy 
(IL2-MSA + IL12-MSA) in mice. IL2-MSA + IL12-MSA operates through a parallel 
STAT4/FOXO1-mediated mechanism that promotes CD8+TIL T-bet/ZEB2 expression and 
lung tumor-reactive Teff cell differentiation. In conclusion, immunotherapeutic 
regimens that support ZEB2 activity in CD8+ cells may show promise in NSCLC 
patients.

The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) supplies abundant reducing equivalents and 
biosynthetic precursors to support the rapid proliferation of tumor cells. An 
increased PPP flux is a hallmark of metabolic reprogramming in tumors. Although 
nuclear factor of activated T-cells c1 (NFATc1) promotes oncogenesis in various 
cancers, its role in metabolic reprogramming remains unclear. Here, we 
demonstrate that NFATc1 enhances NAD kinase (NADK) expression, elevating 
intracellular NADP+ levels to activate the PPP, thereby boosting proliferation. 
Furthermore, NFATc1 binds to both the p1 and p2 promoters of MDM2, sustaining 
its expression, thereby promoting metabolic reprogramming and accelerating cell 
cycle progression. Finally, we demonstrated that NFATc1 inhibitors suppress 
colorectal cancer (CRC) growth by targeting the NFATc1/NADK and NFATc1/MDM2 axis 
and synergize with oxaliplatin. In summary, our findings reveal that targeting 
NFATc1 simultaneously restricts biosynthetic precursors and impairs cell cycle 
progression in CRC, suggesting that NFATc1 inhibition is a promising therapeutic 
strategy.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is highly lethal because of its immunosuppressive tumor 
microenvironment and resistance to immunotherapy. This study explored the role 
of NAT10-mediated N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) RNA modification in pancreatic cancer 
progression and immune evasion. NAT10 (N-acetyltransferase 10) is overexpressed 
in pancreatic cancer tissues and correlates with poor prognosis. 
Mechanistically, NAT10 stabilizes ETS2 mRNA through ac4C acetylation, forming a 
positive feedback loop that upregulates NAT10 and PD-L1, thereby suppressing 
CD8 + T cell infiltration and promoting immune evasion. In addition, NAT10 
stabilizes KRT8 mRNA via ac4C acetylation, which drives cancer cell 
proliferation and metastasis. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed 
enhanced interactions between pancreatic cancer epithelial cells with high NAT10 
and KRT8 expression, and T cells, thereby providing new insights into the immune 
microenvironment. In vivo, NAT10 knockdown significantly inhibited tumor growth, 
enhanced CD8 + T cell infiltration, and reduced lung metastasis. Notably, 
combination therapy with an NAT10 inhibitor and anti-PD-L1 antibody demonstrated 
superior antitumor efficacy compared to monotherapy. In conclusion, NAT10 
promotes pancreatic cancer progression and immune evasion by regulating the 
ETS2-PD-L1 axis and stabilizing KRT8 mRNA, highlighting its potential as a 
therapeutic target for overcoming immunotherapy resistance.

Cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL) is a highly fatal malignancy originating from the bile 
ducts, with most patients diagnosed at an advanced stage, limiting treatment 
options. This study explores the role of Muscleblind-like 3 (MBNL3), a conserved 
RNA-binding protein, in CHOL progression, particularly its involvement in 
metastasis and immune microenvironment regulation. Using data from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), we investigated MBNL3 
expression and its correlation with patient prognosis. High MBNL3 expression was 
associated with significantly better overall survival (OS), progression-free 
survival (PFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and disease-free interval (DFI) 
in CHOL patients. Functional analysis revealed that MBNL3 modulates 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and interacts with critical pathways, 
including focal adhesion, collagen signaling, and TNF signaling. Additionally, 
MBNL3 influences immune cell infiltration, with high expression linked to 
increased macrophage and Th17 cell presence, suggesting potential roles in 
immune response modulation. Experimental validation confirmed that silencing 
MBNL3 promotes EMT, enhances tumor cell migration and invasion, and increases 
metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, genetic analyses highlighted the impact of 
MBNL3 mutations and methylation on CHOL progression, identifying potential 
targets for immunotherapy. This is the first study to investigate MBNL3's role 
in CHOL, positioning it as a prognostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic 
target for improving outcomes in CHOL patients. Further research is needed to 
elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying MBNL3's regulation of tumor 
metastasis and the immune microenvironment.

The TP53 gene is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancers. 
Mutations often result in loss of tumor-suppressive functions and acquisition of 
oncogenic properties by p53, contributing to tumor progression and resistance to 
therapy. Among structural p53 mutations, Y220C is particularly notable for 
creating a surface-exposed hydrophobic pocket that destabilizes the protein 
while preserving partial function, making it a promising target for 
pharmacological reactivation. In this study, we performed a structure-guided 
phenotypic screen of an in-house heterocyclic compound library to identify novel 
small-molecule modulators of p53-Y220C. This led to the identification of a 
series of (1H-pyrrol-1-yl)indazole derivatives (JC16, JC36, JC65), structurally 
inspired by known Y220C binders. JC16 and JC36 exhibited selective cytotoxicity 
and pro-apoptotic activity in p53-Y220C mutant cancer cell lines, with minimal 
effects in wild-type or p53-null cells. These compounds induced a 
mutant-to-wild-type conformational shift in cellular p53-Y220C, accompanied by 
transcriptional activation of canonical p53 target genes, including BBC3 (PUMA) 
and MDM2. Western blot analysis revealed that in HUH7 cells, these effects 
occurred without a corresponding increase in total p53 protein levels, 
suggesting a mechanism based on conformational reactivation. Our findings 
position JC16 and JC36 as early-stage chemical leads with potential to restore 
mutant p53 function in a context-dependent manner. While their exact mechanism 
of action remains to be fully elucidated, these results provide a foundation for 
further development of indazole-based scaffolds as reactivators of the p53-Y220C 
mutant in cancer therapy.

Gastric cancer (GC) metastasis remains a major cause of poor prognosis, yet its 
molecular drivers are poorly understood. Here, we integrated single-cell RNA 
sequencing (scRNA-seq) of primary tumors and matched metastatic lymph nodes from 
six GC patients to identify a metastatic epithelial subpopulation characterized 
by EGR4 overexpression. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that high EGR4 expression 
correlated with reduced survival in GC patients. Mechanistically, chromatin 
immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and luciferase assays demonstrated 
that EGR4 directly bound to the GDF15 promoter, driving its transcriptional 
activation. Functional studies showed that EGR4 promoted migration and 
metastasis via GDF15-mediated ErbB3/ErbB1 hetero-dimerization, which activated 
PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways. Furthermore, CellChat analysis identified robust 
interactions between EGR4+ GC cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), 
particularly extracellular matrix (ECM)-remodeling eCAFs. Secreted GDF15 induced 
CAF activation through TGF-β receptor signaling, creating a pro-metastatic 
niche. Collectively, our study establishes the EGR4/GDF15 axis as a critical 
driver of GC metastasis, offering possible therapeutic targets for intervention.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and RNA N⁶-methyladenosine (m6A) have been linked 
to leukemia drug resistance. However, whether and how lncRNAs and m6A 
coordinately regulate resistance remain elusive. Here, we show that many 
differentially expressed lncRNAs enrich m6A, and more lncRNAs tend to have 
higher m6A content in CML cells resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). 
We demonstrate the broad clinical relevance of our findings, showing that 
upregulation of top-ranked lncRNAs (e.g., SENCR, PROX1-AS1, LINC00892) in 
TKI-resistant cell lines occurs in CML patients at the diagnostic stage, blast 
crisis phase, or not responding to TKIs compared to the chronic phase or TKI 
responders, respectively. Higher lncRNAs predict drug resistance and shorter 
survival duration. The knockdown of SENCR, PROX1-AS1, or LINC00892 restores TKI 
sensitivity. Mechanistically, upregulation of PROX1-AS1, SENCR, and LINC00892 
results from FTO-dependent m6A hypomethylation that stabilizes lncRNA 
transcripts and empowers resistant cell growth through overexpression of PI3K 
signaling mediators (e.g., ITGA2, F2R, COL6A1). Treatment with PI3K inhibitor 
alpelisib eradicates resistant cells in vitro and in vivo, with prolonged 
survival of leukemic mice through downregulation of F2R, ITGA2, and COL6A1. 
Thus, the lncRNA-m6A-PI3K cascade represents a new non-genetic predictor for 
drug resistance and poorer prognosis in cancer, and a pan-cancer mechanism 
underlying TKI resistance.

Inflammation is a hallmark of cancer, but its role in thyroid cancer is unclear. 
We examined the association between 92 inflammatory proteins measured by Olink 
Target 96 and differentiated thyroid cancer in samples collected 1-8 years 
before diagnosis (pre-diagnosis) and <1 year before (at-diagnosis) from 69 
thyroid cancer cases and 69 matched controls matched by sex, age, 
race/ethnicity, BMI, and sample collection year from BioMe, a medical 
record-linked biobank. The at-diagnosis group included 46 cases and 46 controls, 
while the pre-diagnosis group included 23 cases and 23 controls. The association 
between the inflammatory proteins and thyroid cancer was assessed using logistic 
and generalized weighted quantile sum regressions. Eleven inflammatory proteins 
were negatively associated with thyroid cancer diagnosis: one in the 
at-diagnosis group (OPG) and ten in the pre-diagnosis group (CCL20, CXCL6, 
FGF-21, IL20-RA, TSLP, CST5, IL7, MCP-3, MMP-1, and TNF). There was a negative 
association between the mixture effect of the proteins (constrained in the 
negative direction) and thyroid cancer diagnosis only in the pre-diagnosis 
group. Overall, we found a difference in inflammatory proteins negatively 
associated with thyroid cancer in the at- versus the pre-diagnosis group. These 
findings highlight that inflammation potentially has a dual role in thyroid 
carcinogenesis.

This study investigated the association between income, tumor stage, and 
treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, stratified by Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS). Patients diagnosed with 
NSCLC between 2017 and 2022 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry 
(N = 71,025). Median household income at postal code level served as a proxy for 
income. Logistic regression was used to investigate the association between 
income, tumor stage at diagnoses and treatment. All analyses were stratified by 
ECOG-PS (PS0-1 vs. PS2+). Patients with an intermediate or higher income were 
more likely to be diagnosed with a stage IV tumor compared with those with a 
lower income. This was seen in patients with PS0-1 (odds ratio 
[OR]intermediate_vs_lower: 1.13 [95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.08-1.18], 
ORhigher_vs_lower: 1.23 [1.18-1.29]) and PS2+ (ORintermediate_vs_lower: 1.19 
[1.11-1.27], ORhigher_vs_lower: 1.30 [1.19-1.41]). In patients with PS0-1 and a 
stage II or III tumor, those with an intermediate or higher income more often 
received a cancer treatment (stage II ORintermediate_vs_lower: 1.47 [1.09-1.99], 
ORhigher_vs_lower: 1.54 [1.13-2.11], stage III ORintermediate_vs_lower: 1.20 
[1.03-1.40], ORhigher_vs_lower: 1.30 [1.09-1.55]). In patients with PS0-1 and a 
stage IV tumor, those with an intermediate or higher income more often received 
immunotherapy (ORintermediate_vs_lower: 1.10 [1.02-1.19], 
ORintermediate_vs_lower: 1.30 [1.20-1.41]) and systemic treatment 
(ORintermediate_vs_lower: 1.29 [1.20-1.39], ORhigher_vs_lower: 1.50 
[1.37-1.63]). The latter was also found in patients with PS2+ 
(ORintermediate_vs_lower: 1.22 [1.08-1.38], ORhigher_vs_lower: 1.42 
[1.23-1.64]). We thereby showed that even in a country with a universal 
healthcare system, large differences can be seen in the treatments of NSCLC 
patients according to income.

Carnitine and its acyl derivatives are essential for the transport of fatty 
acids from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix for β-oxidation, which 
supplies the cell with energy. Altered transport and metabolism of carnitine are 
associated with multiple diseases and disorders, including heart disease, 
insulin resistance, and cancer. Fluorinated carnitine derivatives have the 
potential to measure aberrant carnitine metabolism in these disorders using 
19F-NMR and mass spectrometry. Furthermore, by radiolabeling carnitines with 
fluorine-18, altered carnitine utilisation may be visualised in vivo using 
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Here, the design and synthesis of a 
fluorinated carnitine derivative, fluoromethylcarnitine (FMC), and its 
radiolabelled equivalent, [18F]fluoromethylcarnitine ([18F]FMC), are described, 
and their ability to quantitatively measure carnitine transport and downstream 
metabolism in a variety of settings are shown, from simple cell models to living 
subjects. Finally, [18F]FMC PET is used to visualise elevated carnitine

Mild-temperature photothermal therapy (mPTT) is attractive for cancer treatment 
due to its safety and precision but is limited by heat shock protein 70 
(HSP70)-mediated thermotolerance, which allows tumor cells to survive sublethal 
heating. Herein, a thermo-responsive cascade nanozyme system is reported 
(Ru-GOx-PNN) that enhances mPTT through dual suppression of HSP70. This system 
integrates a Ru-doped porous carbon framework that serves as both an efficient 
NIR photothermal transducer and a catalytic nanozyme with intrinsic peroxidase 
(POD)- and catalase (CAT)-like activities, immobilized glucose oxidase (GOx) to 
initiate metabolic oxidation and supply H2O2, and an outer thermosensitive PNN 
hydrogel that gates substrate access and exposes active sites specifically 
within the mPTT window. Upon mild heating, the GOx-POD cascade generates 
hydroxyl radicals that trigger lipid peroxidation and destabilize HSP70, while 
the GOx-CAT cascade consumes glucose and reduces adenosine triphosphate 
synthesis, further suppressing HSP70 expression. The resulting inhibition of 
HSP70 relieves its restraint on c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling, thereby 
amplifying apoptosis. Collectively, this strategy effectively overcomes thermal 
resistance and enhances the therapeutic efficacy of mPTT. This study highlights 
the potential of cascade catalytic nanozymes as intelligent platforms for safe, 
efficient, and precise tumor therapy, particularly in challenging malignancies 
such as esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).

Cervical screening frequency has not been studied in vaccinees. As the major 
risk factor, oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) is declining due to 
vaccination. We report a trial to assess the effectiveness of cervical screening 
frequency among women HPV-vaccinated as early adolescents (NCT02149030). In 
2013, 5626 1992-1995-born women, who had received three doses of the HPV16/18 
vaccine at ages 12-15 between 2007 and 2010 in a community-randomized 
vaccination trial (NCT00534638), were allocated at age 22 into high-intensity 
cytology-based cervical screening by even birth date (Arm A1) or into 
low-intensity cytology-based cervical screening by odd birth date (Arm A2). One 
thousand three hundred thirty-three women who received HPV16/18 vaccination at 
age 18 attended a safety of low intensity-screening arm (Arm A3). Low-intensity 
screening, where low-grade cytological abnormalities were not revealed for 
6 years, was compared to the standard high-intensity screening used in Finland 
at the time. The prevalence of cytological and HPV findings was calculated at 
ages 22/25/28. The hazard ratio of histopathologically confirmed immediate 
cervical cancer precursors (HSIL/CIN2+) among participants was compared between 
low- and high-intensity screening arms. The overall occurrence of CIN2+ was 
comparable in Arms A1, 0.70% and A2, 0.66%, with the corresponding hazard ratio 
at age 28 being 0.97 (95% confidence intervals, 0.50-1.88). By age 28, the 
occurrence of vaccine-HPV types 16/18 was reduced up to 88% in the 12-to-15 
compared to 18-year-old HPV-vaccinated women. In conclusion, the risk of CIN2+ 
was similar for HPV-vaccinated women who attended low-intensity cervical 
screening compared to high-intensity screening most likely due to the decline of 
oncogenic HPVs.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a major oncological challenge due to 
intrinsic or acquired chemoresistance, underscoring the urgent need to decipher 
novel regulatory mechanisms. Here, cyclophilin A (CypA) is identified as a 
critical mediator of cisplatin (DDP)/paclitaxel (DTX) resistance in NSCLC by 
suppressing ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death. CypA is 
significantly overexpressed in DDP/DTX-resistant NSCLC cell lines and patient 
tissues, correlating with poor prognosis. Mechanistically, CypA stabilizes the 
ferroptosis suppressor SLC7A11 by competitively binding to its K37 site, 
blocking ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation mediated by the E3 ligase 
TRIM3. This interaction maintains cystine uptake, glutathione biosynthesis, and 
redox homeostasis, thereby attenuating lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis 
induction by chemotherapeutics. knockout of CypA or pharmacological inhibition 
with cyclosporine A (CsA) reverse resistant NSCLC cells to DDP/DTX both in vitro 
and in vivo by restoring ferroptosis. Combined CsA and chemotherapy treatment 
significantly enhances tumor regression, as evidenced by increased 4-HNE and 
reduced SLC7A11 expression in vivo. The study uncovers a CypA/SLC7A11/TRIM3 axis 
governing ferroptosis evasion in NSCLC chemoresistance and highlights CypA as a 
promising therapeutic target. Repurposing CsA to inhibit CypA represents a 
translatable strategy to overcome chemotherapy resistance, offering preclinical 
validation for improving outcomes in NSCLC patients.

Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are lipid nanoparticles secreted from 
mammalian cells that are involved in the transfer of information or 
therapeutically effective substances between cells. Although the scope of 
research on sEVs as biocompatible carriers for drug delivery to diseased tissues 
and cells is expanding, there is still room for improvement in the efficiency of 
drug loading on and in sEVs and their subsequent uptake into cells. It is 
desirable to alleviate the energy barriers associated with the cellular uptake 
of sEVs and minimize the perturbation of sEVs when loading drugs onto them. In 
this study, we developed a simple drug-loading system for sEVs using a dimeric 
curvature-sensing peptide, which enhances sEV accumulation on the cell surface 
by acting as an adhesive, subsequently inducing endocytic uptake of sEVs through 
a clathrin-mediated pathway. The dimeric curvature-sensing peptide selectively 
binds to the sEV surface within 10 min, even in the presence of serum proteins, 
and functions as a membrane interfactant to reduce the energy barriers for the 
cellular uptake of sEVs. The cellular uptake of sEVs and the dimeric 
curvature-sensing peptide under coexisting conditions increased to over 5-fold 
and 20-fold, respectively, compared with those administered alone. Furthermore, 
the dimeric curvature-sensing peptide can efficiently load anticancer drugs onto 
the surface of sEVs, and the system effectively induces apoptosis in two types 
of cancer cells. Dimeric curvature-sensing peptide is a technique with potential 
applications in drug delivery.

BACKGROUND: Accurate evaluation of mediastinal and hilar lymph node (LN) is 
essential in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) management. While PET/CT plays a 
central role, SUVmax alone is limited by false positives and false negatives. 
The tumor-to-lymph node SUVmax (T/LN SUVmax) ratio may improve diagnostic 
accuracy by contextualizing nodal uptake relative to the primary tumor.
METHODS: This retrospective single-center study analyzed 2469 LNs from 1408 
NSCLC patients who underwent both PET/CT and EBUS-TBNA between 2010 and 2021. 
Sonographic features, including LN size, presence of coagulative necrosis sign 
(CNS), absence of central hilar structure (CHS), PET/CT findings and cytology 
results were recorded. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent 
predictors of malignancy. ROC analysis determined the optimal cut-off value for 
T/LN SUVmax ratio.
RESULTS: Malignant LNs (n = 980, 39.7%) were more likely to be larger size, 
round in shape, with homogeneous texture, distinct margins, CNS, and lacking CHS 
(all P < .001). Malignant LNs had significantly lower T/LN SUVmax ratios than 
benign LNs (1.74 ± 1.45 vs. 4.12 ± 2.46; P < .001). Lower T/LN SUVmax ratio, 
higher SUVmax, larger size, and absence of CHS were independent predictors of 
malignancy. A cut-off of 2.10 yielded 79.1% sensitivity, 78.9% specificity, 79% 
diagnostic accuracy (AUC: 0.838).
CONCLUSIONS: The T/LN SUVmax ratio is a simple, and reproducible parameter with 
high diagnostic performance for predicting LN malignancy in PET/CT-guided 
EBUS-TBNA for NSCLC. Although this was a single-center retrospective study, the 
large cohort strengthens the reliability of our findings, and a cut-off value ≤ 
2.10 may help clinicians prioritize LN sampling.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence and prognostic impact of extra-capsular 
extension in isolated lymph nodal recurrence from ovarian cancer and its 
correlation with histopathologic features and oncologic outcomes.
METHODS: Retrospective, single-center study analyzing patients undergoing 
secondary cytoreductive surgery for isolated lymph node ovarian cancer 
recurrence from January 2016 to December 2022. Lymph node metastases were 
classified as intra-capsular growth, extra-capsular extension measuring ≤2 mm, 
or extra-capsular extension >2 mm. Based on histopathologic findings, 
intra-capsular growth and extra-capsular extension ≤2 mm were combined into a 
single group (group A) and compared with extra-capsular extension >2 mm (group 
B).
RESULTS: During the study period, 111 patients with isolated ovarian cancer 
recurrence were included. Forty-seven patients (42.3%) had intra-capsular growth 
and 64 (57.7%) presented extra-capsular extension. Among these, 28 had 
extra-capsular extension ≤2 mm and 36 macroscopic extension (>2 mm). Compared 
with group A, group B was associated with higher rates of tumor emboli, 
necrosis, and sclerosis. Serous histology and elevated CA125 (>35 IU/mL) were 
independent predictors of extra-capsular extension >2 mm; in the multi-variate 
analysis, only CA125 >35 IU/mL maintained statistical significance. After a 
median follow-up of 47.0 months, recurrence occurred in 75% of group B compared 
with 61.3% in group A. Median post-relapse disease-free survival was 27 months 
in the group A versus 20 months in the group B (p = .028). In the multi-variate 
analysis, extra-capsular extension >2 mm and elevated CA125 >35 IU/mL remained 
independently associated with poorer prognosis; site of recurrence, previous 
maintenance therapies, or BRCA status did not impact recurrence outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Extra-capsular extension >2 mm is a frequent entity in lymph nodal 
ovarian cancer recurrences and correlates with more aggressive histopathologic 
features and potentially less favorable outcomes. These findings support its 
role as a prognostic marker to guide treatment strategies in isolated lymph node 
recurrence from ovarian cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Advanced radiotherapy require frequent imaging to ensure accurate 
target coverage. However, imaging verification doses are often unaccounted for, 
raising questions regarding normal tissue exposure. Daily orthogonal (anterior = 
1MU and lateral = 1MU) megavoltage (MV) portal images over 30 fractions may 
provide 40-400 mSv of dose, according to limited data. Additionally, between 17 
% and 19 % of cancer survivors who have undergone radiotherapy, 5 % may acquire 
secondary malignancies. Daily MV imaging is common during breast cancer 
radiotherapy at the study site as a departmental protocol, however doses to 
Organs at Risk (OARs) are unknown. The aim of the study was to assess OAR doses 
during breast cancer radiotherapy.
METHODS: A female RANDO® phantom's thoracic region was exposed to anterior and 
oblique imaging fields simulating four treatment scenarios: left breast, right 
breast, left chest wall, and right chest wall. Gafchromic EBT2 films were placed 
in the left lung, right lung, heart, spine, and on the skin to measure absorbed 
doses during each procedure.
RESULTS: Dose measurements across the four scenarios showed minimal variation. 
Both lungs received the highest daily doses, ranging from 18.4 to 19.8 mGy. The 
heart received between 6.7 and 10.1 mGy daily, while the skin absorbed the 
least, between 4.7 and 5.9 mGy, attributed to the skin-sparing effect of the 6 
MV X-ray photon beam used.
CONCLUSION: Cumulative imaging doses over a standard fractionation period were 
significantly below established thresholds for deterministic effects in the 
assessed organs.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Despite low cumulative doses, the potential increased 
risk of secondary cancers and other radiation-induced effects in the thoracic 
region underscores the need to optimize imaging doses and clinical procedures in 
breast cancer radiotherapy.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between solid pulmonary nodules (SPNs) 
and pulmonary vessels, aiming to identify more reliable features for 
distinguishing benign from malignant SPNs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 431 patients with SPNs (231 benign, 
200 malignant). Univariate analysis was used to identify clinical and CT 
features showing significant differences between the two groups. Two binary 
logistic regression models were constructed as follows: Model 1 incorporated 
clinical and morphological features of SPNs, while Model 2 additionally 
integrated the CT vascular sign. Model performance was compared based on 
efficacy, and an external validation cohort of 105 patients was used to evaluate 
both models.
RESULTS: Malignant nodules were significantly associated with older age, smoking 
history, lobulation, spiculation, bronchial cutoff sign, pleural traction, and 
perifocal fibrosis (all P<0.05). CT vascular sign types I and II were more 
common in benign nodules, while types III and IV were more frequent in malignant 
nodules. Model 1 identified age ≥65 years, nodule size ≥15 mm, lobulation, 
spiculation, bronchial cutoff sign, and pleural traction as independent 
predictors of malignancy (AUC = 0.850). Model 2 incorporated CT vascular sign 
type IV in addition to the previously mentioned features and showed improved 
performance (AUC = 0.914). The DeLong test confirmed that Model 2 significantly 
outperformed Model 1 in both the training and external validation cohorts (all 
P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Benign and malignant SPNs differ significantly in clinical and 
imaging characteristics. Incorporating CT vascular signs alongside morphological 
features improves the diagnostic accuracy for SPNs.

Spatial omics maps cell types and spatial context together. Current methods fall 
into two streams: mapping coordinates (where things are) and measuring 
connections between cells that are in contact or close proximity. We introduce 
the term connectogenomics as a practical umbrella for sequencing assays that 
directly record such contacts as a network. Combining coordinates with measured 
contacts lets us verify whether apparent neighbors truly interact and turn 
network features - such as contact density or hub centrality - into quantitative 
readouts. We propose a framework with four complementary tiers and a feedback 
loop: directly measured molecular contacts can validate coordinate-based 
analyses, while coordinate maps guide where to prioritize contact measurements. 
We illustrate this approach in cancer immunotherapy, development, and pooled 
genetic screens.

BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) is increasingly 
being used, although its oncologic safety for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC) remains controversial. In Japan, MIDP for PDAC has limited endorsement 
due to insufficient data. This study aimed to compare the perioperative and 
long-term outcomes of open distal pancreatectomy (ODP) and MIDP for PDAC.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients with resectable pancreatic body 
and tail cancer treated with ODP or MIDP (laparoscopic or robotic) between 
January 2007 and July 2022. The surgical procedures (ODP and MIDP) were compared 
and the patient characteristics, perioperative outcomes, and long-term outcomes 
were analyzed. We also compared the outcomes of patients with neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy (NAC) and without NAC.
RESULTS: A total of 72 distal pancreatectomies were performed (37 ODPs and 35 
MIDPs). In the upfront group, MIDP resulted in significantly less blood loss 
than ODP (P < 0.01), despite similar operative time. There was no statistically 
significant difference in the 2-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates 
between ODP and MIDP (39.7% vs. 57.8%, P = 0.60) or in the overall survival (OS) 
rates (66.7% vs. 74.1%, P = 0.43). Similarly, in the NAC group, MIDP resulted in 
significantly less blood loss than ODP (P = 0.01); ODP and MIDP had similar 
2-year RFS rates (41.7% and 60.0%, P = 0.75) and OS rates (50.0% and 70.0%, P = 
0.36). The interval from surgery to adjuvant chemotherapy initiation did not 
significantly differ between the ODP and MIDP subgroups in both the upfront 
group (P = 0.13) and the NAC group (P = 0.14). The incidence of recurrence was 
64.8% for ODP and 42.8% for MIDP (P = 0.06). Both procedures showed similar 
distributions of local and distant recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: MIDP caused less blood loss and had similar oncologic safety 
compared with ODP. MIDP could become a feasible, minimally invasive option with 
sufficient oncologic safety for pancreatic body and tail cancers.

Class IA phosophoinositide kinases (PI3Ks) are master regulators of growth, 
metabolism, and immunity. The class IA PI3Ks are a heterodimer composed of a 
p110 catalytic subunit and one of five possible regulatory subunits (p85α, p85β, 
p55γ, p55α, p50α). The regulatory subunit plays critical roles in stability, 
inhibition, and activation of the p110 catalytic subunit. The p110α catalytic 
subunit frequently contains activating mutations in human cancer, with many of 
these mutations altering the interaction between catalytic and regulatory 
subunits. It has been found that different regulatory subunits play unique roles 
in human disease, but it is unknown how these different subunits regulate p110α. 
Here, using a synergy of biochemical assays and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass 
spectrometry (HDX-MS) we examined how the five different regulatory subunits 
inhibit, activate, and interact with the p110α catalytic subunit. We find that 
there are no significant differences in lipid kinase activity or in membrane 
recruitment between the different heterodimer complexes. HDX-MS in the presence 
and absence of an activating phosphopeptide also showed only minor 
conformational differences between different regulatory subunit complexes. 
Overall, our work reveals that the different regulatory subunits interact with 
and inhibit p110α in a similar fashion at a molecular level.

BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Patients diagnosed with colon cancer after a bleeding 
episode are often receiving antithrombotic therapy (AT), indicating a potential 
link between AT and the timing of diagnosis. Our study aims to investigate the 
possibility that the administration of AT contributes, through the early onset 
of symptoms, to the early diagnosis of colon cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients being treated for colon cancer were analyzed 
retrospectively. Patients diagnosed after screening colonoscopy or other 
screening modalities were omitted.
RESULTS: 171 patients were included. Most patients were diagnosed with cancer 
stage III (66, 38.6 %) and II (47, 27.5 %). Fifty-five patients were receiving 
AT (32.2 %), while 54 (31.6) and 44 (25.7) patients presented with a bleeding 
event or anemia, respectively. A statistically significant association was 
observed between the use of AT and an earlier cancer stage at diagnosis 
(p = 0.002). 87.3 % of patients receiving AT were diagnosed with non-metastatic 
cancer, compared to 67.2 % of patients not receiving AT. Patients diagnosed 
after a bleeding episode or onset of anemia while receiving AT had an earlier 
stage of disease at diagnosis than the rest (p < 0.001), with 94.9 % of them 
being diagnosed with non-metastatic cancer, compared to 68.2 % of patients in 
other groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of antithrombotic drugs may lead to an earlier diagnosis of 
colon cancer due to the earlier appearance of complications such as bleeding or 
anemia. Therefore, the appearance of bleeding in these patients, despite the 
initial morbidity, may turn out in the long term to be a critical event that 
allows early diagnosis and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Patients with stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC) with liver metastasis 
represent a specific group that can be treated with surgery. However, the 
influence of genomic alterations on the therapeutic response and prognosis was 
not clear in CRC patients underwent simultaneous surgery of primary and 
metastatic lesions.
METHODS: Fifty-two patients underwent simultaneous surgery on primary and 
metastatic lesions were retrospectively recruited. The mutational landscape of 
primary lesion was established by whole-exome sequencing(WES). Non-parametric 
test, Fisher's exact test, multivariate analyses, Kaplan-Meier analyses were 
performed to identify risk factors for response and prognosis, and a Nomogram 
model was established. Analyses were performed and figures were plotted using 
the Graphpad PRISM 5.0 and the R software.
RESULTS: Several top mutated genes were identified from the mutational landscape 
of primary lesions, including APC, TP53, KRAS and TTN, and many co-mutations, 
mutually exclusive mutations and aberrant functions or pathways were revealed. 
KRAS(P = 0.047) and TTN(P < 0.001) exhibited significant differences in tumor 
mutational burden(TMB) between mutant and wild-type groups. TP53(P = 0.045), 
MUC12(P = 0.012) and CEL(P = 0.032) mutational status significantly stratified 
the patient therapeutic response, in which MUT12 was an independent risk 
factor(P = 0.02). CRC location(P = 0.014), patient therapeutic 
response(P < 0.001), and the mutational status of ANKRD20A4(P = 0.006), 
EVC(P = 0.05), FHOD3(P = 0.05), MYO15A(P = 0.008) and POTEE(P < 0.001) showed 
significant stratification on patient prognosis, in which cancer location, 
response to therapy and ANKRD20A4 and EVC mutational status were independent 
risk factors. These factors were used to establish a Nomogram model to predict 
the individual patient prognosis. Internal and external validation verified the 
effectiveness of the model.
CONCLUSIONS: Independent risk factors including cancer location, response to 
therapy and ANKRD20A4 and EVC mutational status were identified and were used in 
the establishment of a Nomogram model for patient prognosis prediction.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related 
death, with strong environmental associations and genetic risk factors. Although 
some microorganisms have been linked to carcinogenesis in CRC, the prevalence of 
parasites and their potential role in carcinogenesis remain unclear. This study 
aimed to determine the prevalence and association of the parasites Blastocystis, 
Cryptosporidium, and Strongyloides in CRC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted, including 120 
participants, divided into 60 patients with CRC and 60 healthy controls. 
Patients were recruited from two tertiary care hospitals in Cairo, Egypt. 
Parasitologic microscopy-based tests for Blastocystis hominis (B. hominis), 
Cryptosporidium oocysts, and Strongyloides stercoralis (S. stercoralis) 
rhabditiform larvae were performed using iodine-stained smears after formol 
ether concentration, modified Ziehl-Neelsen (MZN) staining, and agar plate 
culture, respectively.
RESULTS: Blastocystis and Cryptosporidium were detected at comparable rates in 
the CRC and control groups (26.7 % vs 28.3 %, p = 0.83 and 8.3 % vs 10 %, 
p = 0.75, respectively), with no significant association with CRC in terms of 
site, pattern, histological types, or stages (p = 0.92, 0.88, 0.84, and 0.39, 
respectively). However, most cases of Blastocystis or Cryptosporidium were 
observed in localized CRC in the rectum of the adenocarcinoma type. S. 
stercoralis was not detected in the stool examinations of either patients or 
controls.
CONCLUSION: None of the parasites studied demonstrated a significant association 
with CRC when using conventional microscopy-based methods of parasite detection.

OBJECTIVE: Stress granule (SG) regulators affect tumor progression in patients 
with gastric cancer (GC). This study aimed to explore the effects of SG-related 
genes on the prognosis, immune characteristics, and drug sensitivity of patients 
with GC.
METHODS: Key SG-related genes in GC were identified from public databases. 
Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were adopted to highlight 
prognostic genes and construct a prognostic model, whose efficacy was assessed 
using Kaplan-Meier and receiver operating characteristic curves. SG-related 
subtypes in GC were identified through consensus clustering. Differences in the 
distribution of risk-stratified samples, molecular functions, expression 
profiles, drug sensitivity, and immune infiltration levels were compared. 
Prognostic gene expression was validated using real-time quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction and western blotting. In sh-CRYAB-transfected cells, the effects 
of CRYAB on cell viability, invasion, and colocalization with the GC scaffold 
protein G3BP1 were assessed using a cell counting kit-8 assay, a Transwell 
assay, and immunofluorescence, respectively.
RESULTS: Among 86 SG-related genes identified in GC, four prognostic genes 
(FHL1, TMPO, SERPINE1, and CRYAB) were recognized as potential diagnostic 
markers. These genes enabled the construction of a prognostic model capable of 
predicting clinical outcomes in GC. Two distinct SG-related molecular subtypes 
were also identified, with subtype 1 associated with a more favorable prognosis. 
These subtypes differed significantly in the expression patterns and biological 
functions of prognostic genes. Furthermore, the four prognostic genes were 
significantly associated with drug sensitivity and immune cell infiltration. 
These genes were overexpressed at both the mRNA and protein levels, except FHL1, 
which was downregulated in GC cells. CRYAB deficiency significantly inhibited 
cell proliferation, invasion, and cytoplasmic colocalization with G3BP1 in GC 
cells.
CONCLUSION: FHL1, TMPO, SERPINE1, and CRYAB are potential prognostic markers in 
GC. CRYAB may facilitate GC progression by regulating G3BP1-mediated SG 
assembly.

PURPOSE: MRI is the standard imaging modality for contouring organs-at-risk and 
clinical target volume in cervical cancer brachytherapy, and is widely used 
along with CT for treatment planning and image guidance. However, MRI-CT 
fusion-based approach is time-consuming and error-prone as it requires two 
imaging sessions and image registration. To realize more efficient and 
streamlined MRI-guided workflow, we propose an automatic method for digitizing 
the applicator and catheters using MRI alone.
METHODS: Applicator digitization consists of applicator mesh reconstruction, 
applicator ring identification, and alignment of the mesh model with MRIs. For 
catheter digitization, we employ an uncertainty-aware deep-learning model that 
simultaneously segments catheters and computes uncertainty on its prediction. 
These uncertainty facilitate initial localization of the catheters and 
subsequent refinement.
RESULTS: This study was performed on 35 T2-weighted MRIs from 30 cervical cancer 
patients treated with the Venezia applicator. The dataset was divided into 80% 
for development and 20% for testing. The method successfully digitized all 
applicators, with mean translation and rotation errors of 1.13 ± 0.26 mm and 
2.19 ± 2.09°, respectively. All catheters except one were successfully digitized 
with shaft and tip errors of 0.74 ± 0.32 mm and 2.52 ± 2.04 mm, respectively. 
Furthermore, plans derived from the automatic digitization showed no significant 
differences compared to clinical plans (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The proposed MRI-based applicator and catheters digitization 
simplifies the brachytherapy planning process by eliminating the need for CT and 
manual tasks. Our results demonstrate that this approach is feasible and can be 
integrated into clinical workflows, offering potential improvements in 
efficiency and accuracy.

Targeting B-cell maturation antigen with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells 
is a new standard of care in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). 
However, long-term data have currently remained sparse. In a recent study 
published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer by Jin et al, authors 
reported on a large cohort of 141 patients with a median follow-up of 20.2 
months. They found an overall response rate of 90.1% with 48.2% achieving a 
complete response. The median progression-free survival was 15.2 months, and the 
4-year overall survival rate was 63.2%. In the current article, we summarize the 
published long-term data from clinically approved and investigational CAR 
T-cells for RRMM.

AIMS: Given the increasing adoption of self-sampling in cervical cancer 
screening, it is essential to evaluate the performance of human papillomavirus 
(HPV) tests in this context. The aim of the present work was to assess the 
accuracy of the Papilloplex high-risk (HR)-HPV test on self-taken samples.
METHODS: Women provided a clinician-taken cervical sample (CS), a urine sample 
and a vaginal swab according to the VALidation of HUman papillomavirus assays 
and collection Devices for Self-samples and urine samples protocol. Relative 
sensitivity and specificity for the detection of cervical intraepithelial 
neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) of the Papilloplex HR-HPV assay on self-taken 
samples versus CS were assessed. Additionally, type-specific concordance and 
viral load signals (expressed in Ct (crossing thershold) values) between the two 
self-taken sample types and the CS were evaluated.
RESULTS: At the manufacturers' cut-off, the assay showed a relative clinical 
sensitivity and specificity for CIN2+of 0.95 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.03) and 0.95 (95% 
CI 0.88 to 1.03) for urine versus CS. Corresponding values for vaginal samples 
versus CS were 1.05 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.09) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.89). 
Cut-off optimisation led to relative sensitivity and specificity that included 
unity for vaginal swabs. Median Ct values were lower in vaginal swabs versus CS, 
although higher in urine versus CS samples. No relationship between mean Ct 
values and disease outcome was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical sensitivity of the Papilloplex HR-HPV test was similar 
on self-collected vaginal swabs and urine compared with CS; clinical specificity 
on urine was similar to CS yet lower on vaginal samples. Cut-off optimisation 
resulted in a similar assay specificity on vaginal swabs and CS with no 
significant detriment to sensitivity.

Male infertility accounts for 20% of cases of infertility in couples. The causes 
can be congenital (hormonal disorders, genetic abnormalities) or acquired 
(varicocele, cancer, treatment, ejaculation disorders). The diagnosis is based 
on a thorough interview, a clinical examination, and a semen analysis. Treatment 
depends on the cause: correction of factors, medical or surgical treatment, or 
assisted reproductive technology. If these fail, sperm donation may be offered 
to the couple.

Prostate and testicular cancer are male cancers whose early symptoms are subtle. 
Prostate cancer, which is common in men over the age of 50, progresses slowly 
and, if detected early, has a good prognosis. Testicular cancer is rare, 
develops in young men, and can be detected by self-examination. Although routine 
screening is not recommended, it is advised in cases where symptoms are present 
and after discussion with a doctor. The Bergonié Institute, located in Bordeaux, 
plays an important role in the fight against these cancers and works to promote 
prevention through local awareness campaigns.

Transketolase (TKT), a key rate-limiting enzyme in the non-oxidative branch of 
the pentose phosphate pathway, plays a critical role in metabolic processes 
including nucleotide synthesis and tumorigenesis. Its inhibitors could modulate 
the enzyme activity and metabolic flux by competitively binding to the cofactor 
thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) or allosteric modulatory sites, demonstrating 
significant potential in drug development for cancer and infectious diseases. In 
this chapter, we present a systematic evaluation of the binding, affinity and 
metabolic regulatory activity of a transketolase inhibitor in terms of binding 
affinity and metabolic regulatory activity. We previously evaluated binding 
affinity of TKT-inhibitor using two-dimensional (2D) TKT protein biological 
chromatography, drug affinity responsive target stability assay (DARTS), 
cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), surface plasmon resonance analysis (SPR), 
competitive binding and molecular docking. Moreover, metabolic regulatory 
activity of a transketolase inhibitor was characterized using spectrophotometric 
assay and targeted quantitative metabolites analysis, and anti-tumor activity 
was determined with patient-derived organoids. Notably, several sections of this 
chapter were originally published in a paper and have been reproduced here for 
this book.

The metabolic enzyme transketolase catalyzes two reversible reactions in the 
non-oxidative phase of pentose phosphate pathway (non-oxidative PPP), bridging 
PPP and glycolytic metabolites from bacteria to humans. The physiological and 
pathological significance of transketolase in humans remains to be elucidated. 
We found that hyperinsulinemia promoted transketolase expression and 
transketolase was critical for the pentose moiety of nucleosides to enter 
glycolysis. By studying the function of transketolase in hepatocytes, 
adipocytes, regulatory T cells, and cancer cells, we revealed intriguing roles 
of transketolase-mediated pentose metabolism in regulating nucleoside levels, 
genome instability, mitochondrial function, and DNA methylation, providing new 
therapeutic opportunities for prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases, 
autoimmune diseases, and cancer. In this chapter, assays for analyzing 
transketolase activity and quantification of metabolites in the non-oxidative 
PPP in mammalian tissues are described.

Understanding the mechanism and structure of transketolase is valuable across a 
range of disciplines, including enzymology, synthetic biology, drug development, 
and biocatalysis. Beyond offering insights into enzyme catalysis and 
thiamin-dependent chemistry, this knowledge enables the rational design of 
transketolase variants with altered substrate specificity and the creation of 
novel biosynthetic pathways to produce unusual sugars or chiral compounds. 
Transketolase is also a potential target for cancer treatment, as well as for 
metabolic or neurodegenerative diseases. This work presents protocols for 
analyzing transketolase activity, its catalytic mechanism, and structure. These 
include methods for steady-state kinetics, cofactor binding, detection of 
catalytic intermediates, and rapid kinetic studies using spectroscopic and 
biophysical techniques. Together, these protocols furnish a comprehensive 
toolkit for advancing both fundamental and applied transketolase research.

[Molecular mechanisms of lung cancer induced by the insecticide 
lambda-cyhalothrin].

The inappropriate utilisation of the agricultural insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin 
(LCT) has the potential to result in residues that compromise food safety and 
human health. Respiratory exposure represents a major route of LCT contact in 
humans. Nevertheless, its deleterious effects on the respiratory system remain 
inadequately characterized. It is imperative to elucidate the potential 
relationship and mechanisms by which lung cancer, a significant malignant 
neoplasm of the respiratory system, is associated with exposure to LCT. The 
objective of this study is to utilise bioinformatics methodologies to screen and 
analyse the key target molecules affected by LCT in the occurrence of lung 
cancer, and their mechanisms of action. Specifically, network toxicology methods 
were employed to identify core targets of LCT-induced lung cancer. Subsequently, 
functional annotation to delineate associated cellular pathways, and finally, 
molecular docking to simulate binding modes between LCT and shared core targets. 
Core target screening identified 50 targets for large cell lung cancer, 54 for 
small cell lung cancer, 29 for lung squamous cell carcinoma, and 28 for lung 
adenocarcinoma, with EGFR, HSP90AA1, JUN, CCL2, MYC, CXCL8, and HSPA4 shared in 
all subtypes. Functional annotation revealed that LCT-triggered oncogenic 
pathways predominantly involved ubiquitination, chemotaxis, and tumor immune 
signaling. Molecular docking demonstrated spontaneous binding of LCT to core 
targets mediated by hydrogen bonds and π-cation interactions. These results 
establish a theoretical framework for evaluating LCT-associated risks of lung 
cancer and respiratory system damage.

PURPOSE: Accurate grading of prostate cancer is critical for treatment 
strategies and risk stratification. This study aims to develop a machine 
learning (ML) model integrating Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging (DCE-MRI) pharmacokinetic parameters with Prostate-Specific Antigen 
(PSA) values to predict ISUP grade metastatic risk groups.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 102 patients with histologically 
confirmed prostate cancer. DCE-MRI pharmacokinetic parameters (Ktrans, Kep, Ve, 
CER, MaxSlope, IAUGC) were standardized. The dataset was balanced using the 
Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique and split into training, validation, 
and test sets. ML models, including Random Forest, were evaluated using Area 
Under the Curve (AUC) values.
RESULTS: The Random Forest classifier achieved the highest performance, with an 
AUC of 0.92. Precision-recall analysis identified an optimal threshold of 0.3, 
balancing sensitivity and specificity for high-risk group detection. SHAP 
analysis highlighted PSA, MaxSlope, and Kep as key predictors contributing to 
model accuracy.
CONCLUSION: Integrating DCE-MRI parameters with PSA values using ML algorithms 
enhances the prediction of ISUP grade metastatic risk groups. This method 
provides a robust tool for metastasis screening and personalized treatment in 
prostate cancer.

Background: No international consensus exists on the selection and reporting of 
outcomes after differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) surgery, hindering assessment 
of new treatments and guideline formation. Therefore, we aimed to develop an 
international core outcome set (COS) to be measured and reported in future 
studies investigating surgical treatment for DTC, as well as in clinical 
practice. Methods: COS development consisted of three phases: (1) collecting an 
initial outcome list through a literature review, (2) a two-round international 
Delphi process with experts and patient representatives, and (3) international 
expert panel meeting to finalize the COS. A steering committee including experts 
from varying medical (sub-)specialties and a patient representative from the 
Dutch Thyroid Patient Organization advised on the study protocol, Delphi rounds, 
and expert panel meeting. Experts were identified through scientific 
associations, international guidelines on DTC, ClinicalTrials.gov, and last 
authors of key studies and suggestions from the steering committee. The outcomes 
from the literature review were presented in successive rounds to experts and 
patient representatives to assess their importance for inclusion in the DTC 
surgical COS. Delphi results were analyzed for each stakeholder group on a 1-9 
Likert scale. Consensus-in was defined as 70% or more of participants in both 
stakeholder groups rating the outcome 7-9 or 90% in one group. Consensus-out was 
defined as 70% or more in both groups rating the outcome 1-3. Consensus-out 
required agreement across both groups. Results: A total of 125 experts and 7 
patient representatives from 35 countries across 5 continents completed all 
rounds. After two rounds, consensus was reached for 17 outcomes. Of these, 13 
outcomes were ratified during the expert panel meeting: recurrence, persistent 
disease, location of metastatic lymph nodes, number of retrieved metastatic 
lymph nodes, postoperative thyroglobulin levels, surgical completeness, 
permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis due to surgery, permanent 
postoperative hypoparathyroidism, 30-day postoperative complication rate, 
accidental intraoperative injury to adjacent organ, unplanned reoperation rate, 
30-day postoperative mortality, and quality of life. Conclusions: This 
international consensus on the COS for DTC surgery promotes consistent and 
appropriate outcome selection in clinical practice and research and may be 
incorporated into future study designs. Future steps include defining some 
outcomes.

The increasing accessibility of high-throughput omics technologies has 
represented a paradigm change in systems biology, facilitating the systematic 
exploration of biological complexity at genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and 
metabolomic levels. Contemporary systems biology more and more depends on 
integrative multi-omics strategies to unravel the sophisticated, dynamic 
networks of cellular function and organismal phenotypes. Such methodologies 
enable scientists to clarify molecular interactions, decipher disease pathology, 
identify strong biomarkers, and guide precision medicine and synthetic biology 
initiatives. Recent technological breakthroughs in computational tools, ranging 
from early or late data integration, network analysis, and machine learning, 
have overcome obstacles of high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and perturbations 
restricted to specific contexts. In this review, we critically assess the 
principles, methods, and applications of multi-omics integration, with an 
emphasis on cancer biology, microbial engineering, and synthetic biology. We 
showcase case studies in which integrative omics provided actionable findings. 
Finally, we address current limitations (e.g., data heterogeneity, 
interpretability) and forthcoming solutions (artificial intelligence, 
single-cell omics, cloud platforms). By closing the gap between molecular 
layers, multi-omics integration is moving toward predictive models of biological 
systems and revolutionary biotechnological applications.

Microtubule-associated serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (MAST3) is a member of 
the MAST kinase family implicated in neuronal and immune pathways and is 
predicted to associate with cytoskeletal regulation. However, insights into its 
functional role in cytoskeletal organization remain unexplored. In this study, 
we performed a large-scale phosphoproteomic analysis of MAST3 using 562 datasets 
to delineate its functional network. We identified four predominant 
phosphosites, S134, S146, S792, and S793, based on the frequency of detection 
and differential regulation, with S134 and S146 localized within the Domain of 
Unknown Function domain, a noncatalytic region. These phosphosites exhibited 
distinct coregulatory profiles, suggesting regulation through noncatalytic 
domains. Coregulated phosphosites were enriched for cytoskeleton-associated 
functions, including actin filament organization, microtubule organization, and 
spindle assembly. Additionally, predicted downstream substrates such as KIF15, 
EPB41L1, CP110, and HNRNPU, and binary interactors including LMNA, CKAP4, and 
CAMSAP2, further support the involvement of MAST3 in cytoskeletal regulation. 
The convergence of these cytoskeletal partners across phosphosites, substrates, 
and interactors suggests that MAST3 may act as a key modulator of cytoskeletal 
organization through phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions. 
Notably, frequent phosphorylation of S146 across cancer types points to a 
potential tumor-specific regulatory role. Together, these findings provide the 
first systems-level insight into the role of MAST3 in cytoskeletal regulation 
and disease relevance.

Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common malignancy and the fourth leading 
cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Owing to its insidious onset, most 
patients are diagnosed at advanced stages, marked by high recurrence, frequent 
metastasis, and multidrug resistance, resulting in poor outcomes. Optimizing 
therapeutic strategies therefore remains an urgent priority. Increasing evidence 
links GC initiation and progression to dysregulated expression of both coding 
and non-coding genes. Among them, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) which 
recognized as pivotal regulators of gene expression have emerged as promising 
biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This review focuses on the lncRNA H19, 
highlighting its role as a central molecular hub in gastric tumor progression. 
H19 modulates the tumor microenvironment, promotes invasion and metastasis, 
reprograms cellular metabolism, and contributes to therapeutic resistance. By 
integrating molecular, cellular, and clinical perspectives, we provide a refined 
understanding of H19-driven gastric tumorigenesis and underscore its potential 
as a biomarker and therapeutic target. These insights offer new opportunities 
for early diagnosis, personalized treatment, and the development of RNA-targeted 
therapies for gastric cancer.

The impressive but incomplete clinical success of immunotherapy with immune 
checkpoint inhibitors makes it of paramount importance to understand and 
overcome immunotherapy resistance. The phenomenon of resistance to immunotherapy 
has been largely categorized as innate or acquired; however, many cellular and 
molecular mechanisms of resistance are remarkably common to both. This notion 
raises the possibility that resistance mechanisms develop during the coevolution 
of the tumor and the immune response, reflecting the multiple interactions 
between malignant cells and cells of the tumor immune microenvironment. This 
tumor-editing interaction selects for often preexisting adapted genetic or 
epigenetic variants, and results in intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) within 
tumors and among metastatic lesions. Variants encompass both tumor-intrinsic 
genetically driven (""hardware"") and tumor-extrinsic (""software"") resistance 
mechanisms that dynamically coevolve under strong immune selection pressures in 
a Darwinian fashion. The level of ITH, which is shaped by the evolution of 
tumors in their immune microenvironment, may dictate the ability of tumors to 
adapt and evade attacks by the immune system. Standardized methods and metrics 
for measuring and addressing ITH and making use of this information in human 
cancer management remain limited, partly due to the lack of suitable models, 
technologies, and bioinformatic tools. Opportunities exist to design therapeutic 
approaches to overcome immunotherapy resistance, with an emphasis on 
interventions targeting intrinsic versus extrinsic resistance mechanisms in the 
context of ITH. These therapeutic approaches can be tailored according to the 
nature of the specific ongoing or predicted resistance mechanisms, as observed 
on a per-case basis, and may include a range of options, such as 
biomarker-driven rational immunotherapy combinations, novel immunoregulatory 
targets, and the suitable incorporation of cell-based adoptive therapies. In 
this review, we discuss the evidence for ITH driving immunotherapy resistance 
and provide a perspective on integrating ITH as a biomarker and when designing 
more efficacious therapeutic strategies.

Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent, lipid peroxidation-driven form of regulated 
cell death that is mechanistically distinct from apoptosis and necrosis. In 
cancer, it plays a dual role: it can act as a tumor suppressor mechanism, yet 
may also contribute to therapy resistance and immune modulation. 
Methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14), a key subunit of the N6-methyladenosine 
(m6A) methyltransferase complex, post-transcriptionally regulates gene 
expression by influencing RNA stability, splicing, and translation. Emerging 
evidence reveals that METTL14 modulates ferroptosis in a context-dependent 
manner by targeting core regulators, including Solute Carrier Family 7 Member 11 
(SLC7A11), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain 
family member 4 (ACSL4), and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1), through 
m6A modification. This review synthesizes recent progress on the 
METTL14-ferroptosis axis across multiple cancer types, such as colorectal, 
esophageal, hepatocellular, non-small cell lung, endometrial, and cervical 
cancers. We systematically outline the molecular mechanisms through which 
METTL14 either promotes or inhibits ferroptosis and evaluate its therapeutic 
relevance. Challenges and future perspectives for targeting this regulatory axis 
in oncology are also discussed.

Growing evidence indicates that the complex and heterogeneous tumor 
microenvironment (TME) beyond the tumor cells plays a pivotal role in cancer 
development and therapy. Notably, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)-a key 
stromal cell population within the TME-are closely associated with malignant 
tumor progression and therapeutic resistance and have progressively emerged as a 
research focus in oncology. As a major mesenchymal cell population in thyroid 
cancer (TC), CAFs exhibit high heterogeneity and dynamic plasticity. They 
secrete numerous cytokines and non-cytokine factors that abnormally remodel the 
extracellular matrix, directly influence the biological behavior of tumor cells, 
and concurrently modulate immune responses, consequently promoting therapeutic 
resistance. Given the unique and crucial role of CAFs in promoting TC 
progression, a thorough understanding of their intricate biology and the precise 
molecular mechanisms that regulate the malignant behavior of TC is essential for 
developing effective therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes for patients 
with TC. The present review provides an overview of the latest research advances 
on CAFs in TC, encompassing their origin, phenotype, and functional 
heterogeneity; the fundamental mechanisms by which CAFs promote TC progression 
and therapeutic resistance through bidirectional interactions with other TME 
components, including immune and tumor cells; and a systematic summary of 
therapeutic strategies targeting CAFs and their clinical translation outcomes. 
Furthermore, this review offers a concise perspective on future research 
directions in the field of CAFs.

Lung cancer (LC) is a major contributor to cancer-related deaths worldwide, and 
long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play significant roles in cancer progression. This 
study focused on the lncRNA LNC511 and its impact on LC cell activity. Through 
microarray analysis, we identified differentially expressed lncRNAs in LC 
tissues, revealing that LNC511 was significantly downregulated in both LC 
tissues and cell lines. We employed reverse transcription quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to measure LNC511 expression levels and 
performed functional assays to evaluate the effects of LNC511 overexpression on 
the proliferation, viability, migration, invasion, apoptosis, and stemness of 
H1299 and A549 cells. Our findings demonstrated that overexpression of LNC511 
inhibited these cellular processes. Notably, LNC511 was predominantly localized 
in the cytoplasm and acted as a molecular sponge for miR-625, leading to the 
upregulation of LOXL4 and inactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. 
The inhibitory effects of LNC511 on LC were reversed by either overexpressing 
miR-625 or downregulating LOXL4, while a specific agonist of the Wnt/β-catenin 
pathway also negated these effects. In conclusion, LNC511 inhibits LC cell 
proliferation and stemness by sponging miR-625, promoting LOXL4 expression and 
consequently inactivating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

Although the immune checkpoint role of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is 
well-established and exploited in cancer immunotherapy, its intrinsic role 
within tumor biology and therapeutic development remains less understood, 
largely due to incomplete mechanistic insights. Here, we demonstrate a 
previously unrecognized mechanism through which PD-L1 drives 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhances stemness, and drives 
metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Mechanistically, PD-L1 
exerts these effects by silencing the anti-metastatic miR-200 family through 
miR-106b-TET3 axis. Furthermore, PD-L1 knockout is associated with improved 
tumor outcomes in orthotopic mouse models. Collectively, our findings identify a 
non-classical function of PD-L1 and TET3 as a critical epigenetic modifier that 
suppresses PD-L1-mediated EMT and breast cancer stemness during metastatic 
progression.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality 
worldwide, and identifying novel biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis is 
critical for improving patient outcomes. In this study, we identified 44 
differentially expressed necroptosis-related genes (DE-NERGs) in HCC using the 
GSE121248 dataset. Functional analyses, including GO and KEGG pathway analyses, 
revealed that these genes were associated with key pathways such as NF-κB 
signaling, apoptosis, and cancer-related pathways. Through machine learning 
algorithms (SVM-RFE and LASSO), we selected 13 diagnostic genes (FAS, MAPK8, 
TNFRSF1B, SQSTM1, DNMT1, ID1, HSPA4, BCL2, FLT3, MPG, GATA3, ATRX, and RNF31), 
which were further validated as potential biomarkers for differentiating HCC 
from normal samples. Notably, HSPA4 was identified as a novel prognostic 
biomarker, with high expressions correlating with shorter overall survival and 
disease-specific survival in HCC patients. Pan-cancer analysis demonstrated 
dysregulation of HSPA4 across multiple cancer types, further supporting its role 
in cancer progression. Results from both in vitro and in vivo tests showed that 
HSPA4 knockdown considerably reduced migration, invasion, and proliferation of 
HCC cells, while changing the Wnt/β-catenin/EMT signaling pathway. Furthermore, 
it was shown that ATF4 was a critical transcription factor that increased HSPA4 
expression. Knockdown of ATF4 reduced HSPA4 levels and suppressed HCC 
progression. These findings suggest that HSPA4, regulated by ATF4, may serve as 
a promising therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker for HCC.

Aprepitant (APT), a neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonist with promising 
anticancer potential, is limited by poor aqueous solubility and low 
bioavailability, hindering its clinical translation. To address these 
limitations, chitosan-coated bovine serum albumin nanoparticles (CS-APT-BSANPs) 
were developed to enhance solubility, intracellular delivery, and therapeutic 
efficacy against breast cancer. The formulation was optimized using a 
Box-Behnken Design to minimize particle size and maximize entrapment efficiency, 
followed by comprehensive physicochemical characterization through DLS, TEM, 
FTIR, DSC, PXRD, and NMR analyses. Fluorescence spectroscopy was employed to 
investigate the molecular interaction between APT and BSA, confirming stable 
drug-protein complex formation and supporting successful encapsulation. The 
optimized CS-APT-BSANPs exhibited a particle size of 160 nm, a PDI of 0.211, a 
positive zeta potential of +31 mV, and an encapsulation efficiency of 
87 ± 0.35 %. In vitro studies demonstrated significantly enhanced cytotoxicity 
(IC50 = 14.4 ± 0.05 μM) compared with free APT (32.1 ± 0.4 μM) and uncoated 
APT-BSANPs (21.4 ± 0.05 μM), along with improved cellular uptake, apoptosis 
induction, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and caspase-3 activation in 
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Migration and clonogenic assays revealed strong 
inhibition of motility and proliferation, while 3D spheroid studies confirmed 
superior tumor penetration and sustained cytotoxicity. Pharmacokinetic 
evaluation in rats showed a 3.2-fold increase in systemic exposure and prolonged 
circulation compared with free APT, confirming enhanced bioavailability. 
Molecular docking further supported these findings by demonstrating a strong 
binding affinity between APT and the NK-1 receptor, involving hydrogen bonding 
and hydrophobic interactions. Collectively, these results establish 
CS-APT-BSANPs as a stable, hemocompatible, and mechanistically validated 
nanocarrier platform for efficient and targeted delivery of aprepitant in breast 
cancer therapy.

Pancreatic cancer, known for its aggressive progression and unfavorable 
prognosis, necessitates the urgent discovery of novel therapeutic targets. This 
study identifies DTL as an oncogenic driver by employing transcriptome 
sequencing of clinical specimens, bioinformatics analysis, and 
immunohistochemical validation. The findings reveal its overexpression and 
prognostic significance in pancreatic cancer. Functional assays have elucidated 
the role of DTL in enhancing tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and 
clonogenicity. In vivo models further corroborated that knockdown of DTL 
resulted in suppressed tumor growth and metastasis, whereas its overexpression 
facilitated disease progression. Mechanistically, DTL operates as an E3 
ubiquitin ligase, mediating K48-linked ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal 
degradation of SMAD4. This process activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, thereby 
promoting tumorigenesis. These findings identify the DTL-SMAD4-Wnt/β-catenin 
axis as a pivotal signaling cascade and underscore the potential of DTL as a 
therapeutic target in the context of pancreatic cancer.

The main reason of low utilization for Poria cocos is primarily attributed to 
its extremely low content of water-soluble polysaccharides (WSP), which are 
associated with various biological effects. In this work, a water-soluble Poria 
cocos polysaccharide (F-WSP-1, 105.58 kDa) fermented by Monascus has been 
isolated and purified through water extraction, alcohol precipitation, and 
DEAE-52 cellulose column chromatography. Structural analysis by HPLC, GPC, and 
NMR confirmed F-WSP-1 as a non-carboxymethylated polysaccharide. Compared with 
native Poria cocos polysaccharide (PCP), F-WSP-1 showed a 25.62 % decrease in 
glucose content, while mannose, galactose, and fucose increased by 3.40 %, 
10.46 %, and 11.95 %, respectively. Its molecular weight (Mw) increased by 
48.66 %, and it exhibited a triple-helix conformation with porous, rough 
morphology. However, functional group composition and crystalline properties 
remained similar to PCP. The immunomodulatory and antitumor activities of 
F-WSP-1 were evaluated against RAW264.7 mouse macrophages and cancer cells (A549 
lung cancer cells and SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells) using carboxymethylated 
Poria cocos polysaccharides (CMP) as a positive control, and the 
immunomodulatory of F-WSP-1 on the RAW264.7 cells without any toxicity and 
significantly promoted their proliferation, secretion of extracellular Nitric 
oxide (NO) and cytokine IL-1β, but the inhibitory effect on the proliferation of 
cancer cells was not obvious. The above results indicated that F-WSP-1 has 
certain immunomodulatory activity but no relevant antitumor activity, and the 
increase in immunomodulatory activity may be attributed to the characteristic 
structure related to the triple-helix structure, Mw, monosaccharide composition, 
and microscopic morphology, especially the formation of the glycan chain 
structure with α-D-galactose as the major monosaccharide component and galactose 
residues as the main backbone. The above results indicated that PCP can be 
biotransformed by Monascus to produce WSP with immunomodulatory activity, and 
provided a new insight for the high value utilization of Poria cocos 
biotransformation.

L-asparaginase catalyzes the hydrolysis of L-asparagine into aspartic acid and 
ammonia and is found in animals, plants, and microorganisms. Microbial sources 
are preferred for large-scale production due to their efficiency and ease of 
cultivation. In this study, we produced and characterized a recombinant 
L-asparaginase from Bacillus subtilis (Asp-Z). Asp-Z was heterologously 
expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography, yielding 
soluble protein with optimal activity at 55 °C and pH 7.5. The kinetic 
parameters under these conditions were a Km of 0.47 mM and a Vmax of 52.13 U/mg. 
Asp-Z was specific for L-asparagine, showing no detectable glutaminase activity, 
and exhibited antiproliferative effects against hematological cancer cell lines, 
particularly RAJI and JURKAT, with IC₅₀ values in the micromolar range. In 
silico analysis revealed distinct immunogenic epitopes between Asp-Z and the 
commercial E. coli L-asparaginase, suggesting divergent antigenic profiles, 
whereas crystallographic data revealed a conserved tetrameric fold with a highly 
flexible active-site loop. Together, these findings highlight Asp-Z as a 
thermostable, glutaminase-free, and poorly immunogenic enzyme that represents a 
promising scaffold for optimization through protein engineering toward 
therapeutic and biotechnological applications.

PURPOSE: Evaluate the safety and feasibility of treating pancreatic tumors in an 
Oncopig tumor model, using bumetanide(BU)/Lipiodol emulsion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pancreatic tumors were induced in 18 transgenic Oncopigs 
with inducible p53 and Kras mutations. Sixteen pigs developed tumor and were 
treated with intra-arterial(IA) injection of BU/Lipiodol emulsion(n=6)[Mean 
injected volume=1.8ml of 2.9ml Lipiodol+2.10 ml(0.44 mg,0.02 mg/kg)BU]; IA 
injection of Lipiodol(n=3), and systemic intravenous(IV) gemcitabine(n=2). Five 
pigs did not receive any treatment(Control). Laboratory evaluation and 
contrast-enhanced CT scan was obtained on days 0, 7 and 14. Necropsy was 
performed on day 14. Treatment was evaluated by tumor size change, radiographic 
response per RECIST 1.1 at day 14 and degree of tumor necrosis on 
histopathological examination. One-way ANOVA and the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test 
were used.
RESULTS: Median(IQR) tumor diameter pretreatment was 1.5(1.1-3.1)cm. No 
significant increase in the post-treatment serum lipase levels were detected in 
the BU/Lipiodol group p>0.05). No clinical, radiographic, or histopathological 
evidence of pancreatitis was detected. Tumor size in the BU/Lipiodol group 
decreased by median of 10.3%(6.7-13.6); p<0.05). The control group had an 
increase in median(IQR) tumor size by 45%(32.8-61.4), respectively; (p<0.05). 
The median tumor size change was significantly different between the BU/Lipiodol 
vs Control group(p=0.01). Mean degree of necrosis was less than 10% in the 
treated groups(p >0.05).
CONCLUSION: Intra-arterial injection of BU/Lipiodol emulsion is safe and 
feasible in treating pancreatic tumor in a transgenic porcine model.

KMT2C is a histone methyltransferase that forms the core of the COMPASS-like 
complex and mediates H3K4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) at active enhancers. It is a 
tumor suppressor gene that is frequently deleted or mutated in various cancers, 
and particularly in breast cancer, KMT2C is the most frequently mutated 
epigenetic regulator. In recent years, studies using multiple cancer models, 
including breast cancer, have revealed the functional significance of KMT2C 
deficiency. Notably, KMT2C deficiency not only aberrate gene expression 
regulation but also cause disruption of DNA damage repair and DNA replication, 
and are involved in the regulation of tumor immune responses. These findings 
suggest that targeting vulnerabilities specific to KMT2C-mutated breast cancer 
may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

The B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family of proteins plays a central role in 
regulating apoptosis and has emerged as a key therapeutic target in oncology 
since the FDA approval of venetoclax in 2016. Within the tumor microenvironment 
(TME), intricate cellular and molecular interactions alter apoptotic signaling 
by upregulating anti-apoptotic BCL-2 members, thereby promoting tumor cell 
survival, immune evasion, and therapy resistance. This review critically 
examines how anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins sustain a pro-tumor TME by supporting 
immunosuppressive populations such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), 
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages 
(TAMs), while suppressing tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte activity and driving 
metabolic reprogramming that enhances cancer cell fitness. Furthermore, 
biophysical and biochemical stressors in the TME-including hypoxia, 
angiogenesis, oxidative imbalance, and osmotic stress-further modulate BCL-2 
expression, reinforcing tumor progression and treatment resistance. Recent 
advances demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition or genetic modulation of 
BCL-2 family members-particularly targeting BCL-2, BCL-XL, or MCL-1, or 
activating pro-apoptotic mediators such as NOXA-can reprogram the TME from an 
immunosuppressive (""cold"") to an immune-responsive (""hot"") phenotype. This 
transition enhances anti-tumor immunity, increases cytotoxic infiltration, and 
potentiates the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches, including PD-L1 
blockade. Overall, this review provides an integrated perspective on how BCL-2 
family signaling dynamically interacts with the TME to sustain malignancy and 
highlights the therapeutic potential of BCL-2 inhibition in reshaping the immune 
landscape and overcoming resistance across cancer types.

Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration for new cancer drugs: An analysis 
of potential explanations.

BACKGROUND: Studies have found notable differences between the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 
indications granted to new cancer drugs. These discrepancies cause uncertainty 
regarding the clinical benefit for the patients treated with the drugs. It is 
unknown why they occur; therefore, we aimed to analyse if maturity of data or 
characteristics of the pivotal trials might be explanations.
METHODS: All new cancer drugs approved by both EMA and the FDA with a final 
decision in at least one of the agencies between January 1, 2020, to December 
31, 2022, were included in the analysis. The drugs were identified by searching 
the FDA and EMA websites.
RESULTS: A total of 36 new cancer drugs were included. Notable differences 
between EMA and the FDA in the granted indication were found in 15 (42%) of the 
drugs. EMA often had more mature data than the FDA, but the proportions were 
similar when comparing drugs with and without notable differences. Furthermore, 
the results did not indicate that low level of evidence (e.g., early phase trial 
as the pivotal, single-arm design, or use of surrogate endpoints) was more 
common in the cancer drugs with notable differences in the indication.
CONCLUSION: The frequent discrepancies in the granted indications between EMA 
and the FDA for new cancer drugs could not be explained by maturity of data at 
time of assessment or characteristics of the pivotal trials. Therefore, 
divergence in regulatory policies between the two agencies is considered a more 
likely explanation.
POLICY SUMMARY: Discrepancies between regulatory agencies in the indications 
granted to new cancer drugs suggest a problematic extrapolation and thus 
uncertainty regarding the clinical benefit for the patients. The present study 
seeks to identify potential explanations for the discrepancies to reduce the 
misalignment in the future.

BACKGROUND: The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) plays a pivotal role in 
modulating immune responses and influencing tumor development by detecting 
metabolites derived from tryptophan breakdown. In patients suffering from 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), elevated levels of AhR are strongly 
correlated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite this, the cell-autonomous 
functions of AhR in pancreatic tumor cells, particularly its role in modulating 
anti-tumor immunity within the tumor microenvironment, remain poorly 
characterized and require further investigation.
METHODS: CRISPR-Cas9 technology was used to generate Ahr-/-/AHR-/- Pan02, 
B16-F10 and Panc-1 cells. Subcutaneous tumor models in nude and C57BL/6J mice 
were used to evaluate the effect of tumor cell intrinsic Ahr on the anti-tumor 
immune response. Transcriptome sequencing, ATAC sequencing, CUT&Tag sequencing, 
ChIP and IP-MS were used to elucidate how AhR controls the expression and 
accessibility of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I).
RESULTS: Elevated AhR levels in PDAC patients correlate with worse outcomes. AhR 
protein is located in both cytoplasm and nucleus of tumor cells. Deletion of Ahr 
in Pan02 and B16-F10 leads to a significant upregulation of MHC-I and related 
gene expression. AhR drives tumor growth by suppressing T cell-mediated 
immunity. Mechanistically, AhR specifically suppressed MHC-I expression in 
pancreatic tumor cells by interacting with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 
(PRMT5) to decrease chromatin accessibility, which led to impaired antigen 
presentation. We demonstrated that AhR inhibition improved the therapeutic 
efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade, chemotherapy, and PRMT5-targeted therapy 
in pancreatic cancer models.
CONCLUSIONS: Tumor cell intrinsic AhR inhibits MHC-I expression in PDAC cells by 
epigenetic regulation mediated by PRMT5, resulting in reduced immunogenicity of 
pancreatic tumor cells. The discovery of the AhR-PRMT5-H4R3me2s-MHC-I axis 
provides critical mechanistic insights into how tumor-intrinsic epigenetic 
regulation of antigen presentation promotes the progression of PDAC.

BACKGROUND: Despite advances in systemic analgesic strategies for cancer 
patients suffering pain, a subset of patients remains unresponsive to standard 
treatment. Intrathecal infusion therapy offers targeted pain relief, with 
implantable pumps being particularly beneficial for those with longer life 
expectancies. Although recommended in clinical guidelines, implantable pumps 
remain underused. To support informed clinical decision-making, we conducted a 
systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of this therapy in 
reducing refractory cancer-related pain.
METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the PRISMA guideline. 
We searched PubMed, Cochrane, BVS Lilacs, and Epistemonikos for cancer-related 
pain management using an intrathecal infusion system with an implantable pump 
and a follow-up of at least three months. The risk of bias was assessed using 
RoB-2 and ROBINS-I tools. Data extracted included pain intensity, adverse events 
and quality of life.
RESULTS: Twelve articles were included: two randomized controlled trials and ten 
single-arm studies. Our meta-analysis of pain reduction found that mean pain 
intensity decreased by 4.37 points (95% CI -4.89 to -3.84) after three months of 
implantation, and by 3.30 (95% CI -5.49 to -1.12) after six months. The most 
frequently reported adverse events were post-dural headache, nausea and 
vomiting. Although quality of life improved, further studies are needed for a 
comprehensive evaluation.
CONCLUSION: Implantable intrathecal infusion systems seem to be a viable 
alternative to manage refractory cancer-related pain; however, these findings 
should be interpreted carefully given the methodological limitations, including 
the lack of comparative design and the high risk of bias in the included 
studies.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies, 
characterized by aggressive progression, late detection, and limited response to 
current therapies. Recent research has revealed that the gastrointestinal and 
intratumoral microbiomes are key modulators of immune regulation, metabolism, 
and epigenetic pathways, influencing tumor progression and therapeutic efficacy. 
This review summarizes the complex microbiome-PC interplay, emphasizing 
microbial modulation of inflammation, immunity, and treatment resistance. We 
also highlight microbiome-targeted strategies, such as probiotics, prebiotics, 
postbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, along with advanced 
drug-delivery platforms - including nanoparticles, engineered bacteria, and 
stimuli-responsive systems - for precise microbiome modulation. Integrating 
microbiome science with immunotherapy, nanotechnology, and epigenetic 
reprogramming offers promising opportunities to improve outcomes in PC.

Recent advances in cancer treatment have improved outcomes for patients across a 
wide variety of cancers. However, despite the introduction of more targeted 
therapies, including those which harness the body's natural immune system, 
cancer-associated thrombosis, particularly during therapy, is a significant 
clinical problem associated with poorer outcomes for the patient. Although 
venous thromboembolism is more common, arterial events cause significant 
morbidity and are frequently fatal. In addition to the well-established 
chemotherapeutic regimens, a multiplicity of therapies are now used in the first 
line setting including antibody based treatments, immunotherapy and hormone 
receptor modulators. Many cancers are now being managed as chronic diseases with 
long term maintenance therapies in an increasingly older patient population with 
significant comorbidities. With this change in the treatment landscape, 
predictive biomarkers are needed to effectively identify patients and treatments 
associated with the highest risk of thrombosis in the current cancer population. 
Although cancer-associated thrombosis has been extensively studied, the specific 
mechanisms by which cancer therapy causes thrombosis remain poorly understood. 
The pathogenesis of immunothrombosis associated with cancer treatments in 
particular is poorly defined. Focusing on solid tumours, the aim of this 
narrative review is to explore our current understanding of the pathogenesis of 
thrombotic effects of systemic cancer treatment. These include coagulation 
activation, vascular endothelial damage, procoagulant effects of material from 
dead and dying tumour cells as well as the role of inflammatory mediators. 
Greater understanding of pathogenesis of treatment related cancer associated 
thrombosis will lead to the identification of more effective biomarkers to guide 
thromboprophylaxis.

Ovarian cancer is characterized by poor specificity and unfavorable prognosis. 
Therefore, exploring new mechanisms of ovarian cancer development, identifying 
specific new targets, and developing effective therapeutic drugs based on these 
new targets have become the focus of current research. This study collected 
clinical case tissues from high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) patients and 
found that the expression of RecQ-like helicase 4 (RECQL4) was positively 
correlated with the malignancy of ovarian cancer but negatively correlated with 
its prognosis. From the chemical library of traditional Chinese medicine and 
ethnic medicines established by our research group in Guizhou, we screened out 
an effective target, a fluorinated tanshinone analogue (TC12-1), which can 
effectively inhibit and bind to RECQL4. In vitro experiments showed that TC12-1 
induced apoptosis and inhibited cancer cell invasion and metastasis. 
Additionally, TC12-1 can induce DNA damage, enhancing replication fork stress 
and blocking the cell cycle at the S phase in cancer cells. The compound 
effectively inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in subcutaneous tumor models 
and in orthotopic ovarian cancer mouse model, showing no significant toxicity to 
vital organs in tumor animal models. The molecular mechanism of TC12-1 targeting 
RECQL4 in anti-ovarian epithelial cell carcinoma involves the regulation of key 
genes such as γ-H2AX, PRPA32, ATM, RAD50, CHK2, P53, P21, Bax, CyclinE, and 
CDC2, thereby affecting the cell cycle and DNA replication signaling pathways. 
The results provide theoretical support for developing specific ovarian cancer 
therapeutic drugs using RECQL4 as a new target.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer surgery is often associated with unpleasant 
postoperative symptoms, including pain, nausea, fatigue, and emotional distress, 
which can reduce quality of life and prolong recovery times. This study aimed to 
test the efficacy of preoperative hypnosis in reducing postoperative symptoms 
following breast cancer surgery.
METHODS: A total of 203 women scheduled for breast cancer surgery at Oslo 
University Hospital, Norway, participated in a randomized controlled trial. 
Patients were randomized to receive either a single session of preoperative 
hypnosis or of mindfulness within two hours prior to their scheduled surgery. 
Primary outcomes were postoperative pain, fatigue, nausea, discomfort, and 
emotional distress, measured using 100mm visual analogue scales on the day of 
surgery following recovery from general anesthesia. Additional measures included 
amount of intraoperative and postoperative anesthesia and analgesia, as well as 
surgery duration (extracted from patients' medical records).
RESULTS: Patients receiving preoperative hypnosis reported significantly lower 
postoperative fatigue (mean difference (MD) 6.4, 95% CI 0.40 - 12.4, Cohen's 
d=0.30) and emotional distress (MD 5.7, 95% CI 0.24 - 11.2, d=0.24) when 
compared to patients in a mindfulness control group. There was also a 
significant reduction in postoperative fentanyl use among those patients 
receiving preoperative hypnosis (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.047 - -0.005, d=0.54). 
Preoperative anxiety moderated the effect of hypnosis on postoperative emotional 
distress, showing a more pronounced benefit for patients with high levels of 
preoperative anxiety. However, no significant differences were found in 
postoperative pain, nausea, or discomfort between the hypnosis and mindfulness 
groups. No adverse events attributed to the interventions were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: A brief preoperative hypnosis session before breast cancer surgery 
appears to be more effective than mindfulness in reducing postoperative fatigue, 
emotional distress, and fentanyl dose. Hypnosis stands out as a promising, 
non-pharmacological, and safe intervention for reducing certain postoperative 
symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: Despite therapeutic advances improving 5-year survival in epithelial 
ovarian cancer (EOC), it remains unclear whether these treatments effectively 
promote long-term survival (currently exceeding 10 years). This study aimed to 
analyze 10-year survival trends and develop a nomogram to predict long-term 
survival.
METHODS: Using the SEER database, we collected data from 30 924 EOC patients 
diagnosed between 2004 and 2015. Age-adjusted overall survival (OS) and 
cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates were calculated, and survival trends were 
analyzed using Joinpoint software. A nomogram was constructed based on 
clinicopathological and socioeconomic variables, then validated using the 
C-index, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: While 5-year OS and CSS improved significantly, 10-year survival showed 
minimal improvement (OS: +0.59%/year; CSS: unchanged). Race, household income, 
stage, tumour size and chemotherapy were identified as independent predictors of 
OS, while age, marital status, grade, stage, lymph node positivity and 
chemotherapy were independent predictors of CSS. A nomogram was constructed and 
validated based on the above independent predictors. Compared with the 
traditional AJCC staging system, this novel nomogram showed superior prognostic 
discrimination with a C-index of 0.712 for OS and 0.738 for CSS.
CONCLUSION: The influence of factors such as family income, age, and marital 
status on the prognosis of ovarian cancer highlights the necessity of 
comprehensive and sustained management approaches. Additionally, for the first 
time, we present a multifactorial nomogram for predicting long-term survival in 
EOC with an accuracy superior to traditional staging methods, offering 
clinicians a more personalized approach to patient assessment. Résumé OBJECTIF: 
Malgré les avancées thérapeutiques qui améliorent le taux de survie à 5 ans des 
personnes atteintes d'un cancer épithélial de l'ovaire (CEO), on ne sait 
toujours pas avec certitude si ces traitements favorisent efficacement la survie 
à long terme (établie actuellement à plus de 10 ans). Cette étude avait pour 
objectif d'analyser les tendances du taux de survie à 10 ans et de concevoir un 
nomogramme pour prédire le taux de survie à long terme. MéTHODES: Nous avons 
recueilli des données de la base de données SEER sur 30 924 patientes ayant reçu 
un diagnostic de CEO dans la période entre 2004 et 2015. Le taux de survie 
globale (SG) ajusté selon l'âge et le taux de survie spécifique au cancer (SSC) 
ont été calculés et les tendances de survie ont été analysées au moyen du 
logiciel Joinpoint. Un nomogramme a été conçu selon des variables 
socioéconomiques et clinicopathologiques. Il a ensuite été validé au moyen de 
l'indice de concordance (indice C), des courbes de calibration et de l'analyse 
de la courbe de décision. RéSULTATS: Bien que les taux de SG et de SSC à 5 ans 
aient beaucoup augmenté, les taux de survie à 10 ans se sont très peu améliorés 
(SG : + 0,59 %/année; SSC : aucun changement). La race, le revenu familial, le 
stade du cancer, la taille de la tumeur et la chimiothérapie ont été déterminés 
comme étant des prédicteurs indépendants de la SG, tandis que l'âge, l'état 
matrimonial, le grade et le stade du cancer, l'atteinte des ganglions 
lymphatiques et la chimiothérapie constituaient des prédicteurs indépendants de 
la SSC. Un nomogramme a été conçu et validé selon ces prédicteurs indépendants. 
Par comparaison au système de stadification traditionnel de l'American Joint 
Committee on Cancer (AJCC), ce nouveau nomogramme a permis une meilleure 
différenciation pronostique, avec un indice C de 0,712 pour la SG et de 0,738 
pour la SSC.
CONCLUSION: L'influence de facteurs tels que le revenu familial, l'âge et l'état 
matrimonial sur le pronostic du cancer de l'ovaire souligne le besoin d'adopter 
des stratégies de prise en charge complète et durable. En outre, pour la 
première fois, nous présentons un nomogramme multifactoriel pour prédire la 
survie à long terme des personnes atteintes d'un CEO, qui affiche une exactitude 
supérieure aux méthodes de stadification traditionnelles. Cet outil offre aux 
cliniciens une approche plus personnalisée de l'évaluation des patientes.

BACKGROUND: The phase 3 KEYNOTE-671 study (NCT03425643) demonstrated 
significantly improved event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival with 
neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant 
pembrolizumab versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery for early-stage 
non‒small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We describe participant characteristics, 
surgical outcomes, and EFS in surgically relevant subgroups.
METHODS: Participants with untreated, resectable, stage II‒IIIB (N2) NSCLC were 
randomized 1:1 to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo plus 
cisplatin-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, then surgery and 
adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo for 13 cycles. Surgery was performed ≤20 weeks 
after first neoadjuvant dose (if 4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy) or 4‒8 weeks 
after last neoadjuvant dose (1‒3 cycles); surgery beyond this was considered 
surgical delay. Adjuvant therapy began 4‒12 weeks after surgery. EFS was 
assessed in the surgical population.
RESULTS: Of 397 participants randomized to pembrolizumab and 400 to placebo, 325 
(82.1%) and 317 (79.4%), respectively, underwent surgery. At data cutoff (July 
10, 2023), 4.9% (pembrolizumab) and 7.6% (placebo) of participants experienced 
surgical delay, 38.9% and 28.4%, respectively, experienced nodal downstaging, 
78.8% and 75.1% underwent lobectomy, and 92.0% and 84.2% had R0 resections. 
Pembrolizumab improved EFS irrespective of disease stage, nodal status, and type 
of surgery versus chemotherapy. Eight participants (pembrolizumab, n=6; placebo, 
n=2) died ≤30 days after surgery from surgery-related adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab did not adversely affect surgical 
outcomes, was associated with numerically higher R0 resections, and improved EFS 
versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy in surgically relevant subgroups in early-stage 
NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: National guidelines recommend fitness and mind-body exercise to 
reduce cancer-related fatigue, but substantial barriers to implementation exist. 
Virtual programs offer a scalable approach to address this gap. This study aims 
to evaluate efficacy of a virtual fitness and mind-body exercise program 
(Integrative Medicine at Home, IM@Home) in reducing fatigue in patients 
undergoing radiation therapy (RT) for breast cancer.
METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled patient-reported outcome 
(PRO)-basket clinical trial was conducted. Patients undergoing breast RT who 
reported moderate or greater fatigue were randomly assigned 1:1 ratio to either 
IM@Home, which provided live virtual fitness and mind-body exercise classes, or 
enhanced usual care (EUC). The primary outcome, fatigue, was measured using 
total Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), a composite score including severity and 
impact on daily functioning, weekly over 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included 
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), and 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) collected every 4 weeks. 
Statistical analysis included linear mixed models to compare group differences 
over time using statistical significance threshold of p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Among 73 enrolled patients, 35 were randomly assigned to IM@Home and 38 
to EUC. At week 12, patients in the IM@Home group had significantly less fatigue 
compared to those in the EUC group (2.06 vs 2.79, p=0.009). Compared to EUC, 
patients in the IM@Home group showed greater reductions in insomnia (p=0.005), 
symptom distress (p=0.013), and depression (p=0.04) but not anxiety (p=0.14).
CONCLUSIONS: The IM@Home program significantly reduced fatigue and co-morbid 
symptoms among women with breast cancer undergoing RT. Future research is needed 
to confirm these findings, explore mechanisms of the observed benefit, and 
evaluate scalability as well as barriers and facilitators to implementation.

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological 
malignancy characterized by the aberrant activation of survival pathways, 
particularly the PI3K/AKT axis. Pristimerin (Prist), a naturally occurring 
quinonemethide triterpenoid, has recently gained attention for its anti-cancer 
potential. In this study, we demonstrate that Prist effectively inhibits the 
proliferation of T-ALL cell lines (Jurkat and Molt 4) by inducing G0/G1 cell 
cycle arrest and triggering intrinsic and extrinsic caspase-dependent apoptosis. 
Prist significantly increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and depletes 
glutathione (GSH), leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and cytochrome c 
release. Notably, ROS scavenging with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) abrogated 
Prist-induced apoptosis, highlighting ROS as a critical mediator of its 
cytotoxicity. Network pharmacology and molecular docking revealed AKT as a key 
target of Prist, with strong binding affinity confirmed through docking 
analysis. Prist downregulated phosphorylated AKT and inhibitor of apoptosis 
proteins (XIAP, cIAP1/2), supporting its pro-apoptotic mechanism. Importantly, 
Prist inhibited the proliferation and AKT phosphorylation in activated primary 
human T cells but spared resting T cells, indicating selective cytotoxicity. 
These findings establish Prist as a promising therapeutic candidate for T-ALL 
through the selective targeting of PI3K/AKT-driven survival signaling.

Prostate cancer (PCa) pathogenesis involves complex interactions between genetic 
susceptibility and exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). This study 
aimed to systematically identify key genes linking EDC exposure to PCa using an 
integrated bioinformatics and machine learning (ML) approach. We analyzed four 
transcriptomic datasets (GSE32571, GSE71016, GSE46602, GSE200879) and identified 
437 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). By integrating these with 
high-confidence EDC-interacting genes from the Comparative Toxicogenomics 
Database (CTD), we pinpointed 169 core candidates. An ensemble ML framework, 
evaluating over 70 algorithm combinations, identified an optimal model 
(glmBoost+RF) that refined this list to eight core genes, including Glutathione 
S-Transferase Pi 1 (GSTP1). Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis established a 
causal, protective role for GSTP1 against PCa risk (OR=0.880, 95% 
CI=0.777-0.998, P=0.046). Molecular docking and dynamics simulations revealed 
stable binding between GSTP1 and high-priority EDCs, such as Benzo[a]pyrene 
(binding energy: -9.8 kcal/mol), indicating a direct interaction mechanism. 
Functional enrichment analyses implicated these genes in oxidative stress 
response and xenobiotic metabolism. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing and 
immune infiltration analysis suggested a role for GSTP1 in modulating the tumor 
microenvironment. Our findings elucidate a critical ""EDC-GSTP1-PCa"" axis, 
highlighting GSTP1's potential as a therapeutic target and providing mechanistic 
insights into environmental chemical-induced prostate carcinogenesis.

We report a rare case of advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring a novel 
non-canonical RET::FOXJ3 gene fusion, which has not been previously documented. 
A 66-year-old male was diagnosed with stage IVB non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis using the Illumina NovaSeq 
6000 identified a previously unreported rearrangement of RET (Rearranged During 
Transfection) proto-oncogene, involving a fusion of RET exon 1 to FOXJ3 
(Forkhead box J3) exons 2-13. Following disease progression on first-line 
chemotherapy combined with PD-L1 blockage (PFS1=6 months), the patient was 
treated with the selective RET inhibitor pralsetinib (PFS2=2 months). However, 
no significant clinical response was observed, and disease progression was 
reassessed after 6 weeks of targeted therapy. Palliative cranial radiotherapy 
was subsequently administered for newly developed brain metastases (PFS3=5 
months), resulting in an overall survival of 18 months (OS=18 months). This case 
expands the current understanding of RET fusion partners and raises important 
questions regarding the functional and therapeutic implications of non-canonical 
fusions. It underscores the necessity of corroborating DNA-level findings with 
RNA and/or protein expression data and highlights the limitations of existing 
RET-targeted therapies for atypical RET fusions that may lack an intact kinase 
domain.

The Hippo/YAP signaling pathway has been implicated in promoting cancer 
development in liver cancer. YAP serves as its core effector to promote the 
expression of downstream oncogenes, exacerbating the difficulty in treatment and 
prognosis. ICA-11c, a derivative of icaritin (ICT), which was designed and 
synthesized in our previous study, inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 and 
Huh-7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, ICA-11c promoted 
G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence by regulating the p53/p21 and 
p16/RB pathways. Mechanistically, the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and 
molecular docking assay confirmed the combination between ICA-11c and YAP, which 
inhibited YAP nuclear translocation, eventually promoted its phosphorylation and 
reduction in the cytoplasm. Particularly, YAP overexpression attenuated the 
effect of ICA-11c on cellular senescence as well as its anti-proliferative 
activity. Our findings not only show that ICA-11c served as a potential YAP 
regulator for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, but also explore the 
relationship between YAP and cellular senescence. This study suggests that 
ICA-11c may be a potential novel inducer of cellular senescence in 
hepatocellular carcinoma cells.

PURPOSE: Perioperative patient complications are a global concern for patient 
safety. Few studies have systematically evaluated the factors associated with 
complications during the perioperative period of gynaecologic malignancies from 
a nursing or caregiving perspective. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate 
the incidence and risk factors of postoperative complications in patients with 
gynaecological malignancies from a holistic care perspective.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 3,372 patients from the information 
system of a university-affiliated teaching hospital in China, with data 
collected from 1 October 2018-30 September 2023. A nomogram was constructed 
based on the predictive factors. Its goodness-of-fit was examined using the 
Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and calibration curves were used for internal evaluation. 
The clinical utility of the nomogram was quantified using clinical decision 
curve analysis.
RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative complications in patients with 
gynaecological malignancies was 13.0%. Nomograms constructed based on employment 
status, intraoperative warming, blood and fluid loss, cancer type, and cancer 
stage were bootstrap-corrected with a consistency index of 0.63. The calibration 
curves showed good agreement between predicted and actual probabilities. The net 
benefit of screening all patients based on the nomogram was greater than no 
screening when the risk of complications was 5.0-30.0%.
CONCLUSION: Gynaecological malignancies are associated with a high incidence of 
postoperative complications. Employment status, intraoperative warming, bleeding 
and rehydration fluid, cancer type, and cancer stage are independent risk 
factors for these complications, and their incidence can be predicted using the 
nomogram. The results of this study highlight the important role of nursing 
strategies in preventing complications. These findings have important 
implications for clinical nursing intervention and decision making.

Aging is a natural, multifactorial biological process characterised by 
progressive cellular and tissue damage in response to various stressors, leading 
to functional decline that often affects multiple organs, contributing to the 
development of age-related diseases. Although life expectancy has increased 
significantly, age-related conditions have become the leading causes of 
impairment and disability in the elderly, becoming a major global health 
concern. This highlights the need for innovative, multitarget strategies to 
modulate the aging process and extend healthspan. In recent years, researchers 
have explored natural solutions to counteract the hallmarks of aging. Among 
these, marine-derived molecules represent an up-and-coming niche of bioactive 
compounds, distinguished by their unique structural diversity and 
multifunctional properties. Marine products are increasingly studied for their 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties, targeting key 
pathways involved in aging, such as cellular senescence, genomic instability, 
impaired autophagy, and chronic inflammation. In this review, we aim to (i) 
explore the field of marine-derived bioactive molecules which demonstrated 
effects on lifespan extension, (ii) summarize studies showing their capacity to 
target one or more hallmarks of aging, (iii) highlight those that exhibit 
therapeutic potential in age-related diseases - including neurodegenerative, 
cardiovascular, metabolic, cancer, musculoskeletal, and chronic pulmonary 
disorders. Their multitarget activity makes them attractive candidates for the 
prevention or treatment of age-related diseases, and several have shown 
promising results in preclinical studies. However, only a limited number of 
these compounds have progressed to late-stage clinical trials, highlighting the 
need for further translational research, which may pave the way for novel 
anti-aging therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prostate cancer remains a significant clinical 
challenge, particularly in characterizing lesions and predicting patient 
outcomes. With the growing availability of advanced imaging techniques like 
[18F]DCFPyL PET/CT, there is an urgent need for intelligent tools that can 
facilitate clinical decision-making. This study aimed to develop artificial 
intelligence (AI) models for lesion characterization and outcome prediction in 
prostate cancer (PCa) patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PCa patients who underwent [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT imaging 
were divided into training and internal test sets (n = 238) and a prospective 
test set (n = 36). Lesions were scored using the PSMA-Reporting and Data System 
(RADS) and assessed for malignancy, treatment response, and survival outcomes. 
Single- and multi-modality deep learning models were trained for four tasks: 
PSMA-RADS scoring, malignancy classification, treatment response prediction, and 
survival prediction.
RESULTS: The input concatenation model, which combined PET and CT modalities, 
demonstrated superior performance across all tasks. For the internal test set, 
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) were 0.81 
(95 % CI: 0.80-0.81) for PSMA-RADS scoring, 0.79 (95 % CI: 0.78-0.80) for 
malignancy classification, and 0.74 (95 % CI: 0.73-0.77) for treatment response 
prediction. In the prospective test set, the AUROCs were 0.72 (95 % CI: 
0.69-0.75) for PSMA-RADS scoring, 0.70 (95 % CI: 0.68-0.71) for malignancy 
classification, and 0.70 (95 % CI: 0.67-0.72) for treatment response prediction. 
The C-indices for survival predictions were 0.58 (95 % CI: 0.57-0.59) and 0.60 
(95 % CI: 0.60-0.63) for the internal and prospective test sets, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the potential of AI to improve lesion 
characterization and identify patients at high risk of disease progression.

Understanding the processes and/or the key factors involved in the formation as 
well as degradation of lipid droplets (LDs) within the adipocytes is of immense 
importance, especially in the context of health, obesity, cancer, and other 
diseases. While cold-temperature and/or Menthol, an edible cooling agent seem to 
have diverse and confounding effects on obesity and/or thermogenesis, so far 
there is no direct evidence that specific pharmacological modulation of TRPM8, a 
cold-temperature activated ion channel can indeed affect lipid-droplet status 
within the mature adipocytes. Here, we used highly specific antagonist and 
agonist of TRPM8 to modulate TRPM8 in cultured adipocyte cells in vitro and 
monitored the expression of TRPM8 as well as other adipogenic functions. Our 
results indicate that specific activation of TRPM8 in mature adipocytes by a 
specific agonist, i.e., WS12, results in increased expression of PPARγ protein. 
However, TRPM8 inhibition by AMTB results in no change in the PPARγ expression, 
yet causes decreased Oil Red O intensity, reduction in LD sizes, and an increase 
in LD numbers. BODIPY labelling in live cells also suggests the same findings. 
Altogether, data suggest that in the absence of any confounding factors, 
specific inhibition of TRPM8 results in either less fusion of LDs or enhanced 
fragmentation of LDs in vitro. These findings may have broad implications in the 
field of adipogenesis and in cancer.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a complication of head and neck cancer (HNC). 
However, the effectiveness of routine anticoagulation as a preventive measure 
and its impact on patient outcomes is unclear. The purpose of this study was to 
evaluate the association between long-term systemic anticoagulation and 
in-hospital outcomes of patients with HNC. Data of patients ≥ 20 years old with 
HNC treated from 2005 to 2018 were extracted from the US Nationwide Inpatient 
Sample (NIS) database. Associations between long-term systemic anticoagulation 
and in-hospital outcomes were assessed by the univariate and multivariable 
regression analyses. The study included 20 312 patients with a mean age of 
63 years, and 72% were males. Among them, 5078 (25.0%) were on long-term 
systemic anticoagulation. After adjustment, the multivariable analysis indicated 
long-term systemic anticoagulation was significantly associated with decreased 
odds for in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.64, 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.54-0.76, p < 0.001), overall life-threatening events 
(aOR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.78-0.92, p < 0.001), acute myocardial infarction 
(aOR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59-0.97, p = 0.026), sepsis (aOR = 0.80, 95% CI: 
0.71-0.90, p < 0.001) and acute kidney injury (aOR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76-0.97, 
p = 0.015). Long-term systemic anticoagulation was significantly associated with 
elevated overall bleeding risk (aOR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.17-1.54, p < 0.001) but 
not intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) (aOR = 1.65, 95% CI: 0.90-3.04, p = 0.107). 
In conclusion, in patients with HNC, long-term anticoagulation is associated 
with better in-hospital outcomes, and does not increase the risk of ICH; 
however, there is an increased risk of overall bleeding.

Background The advent of angiogenesis inhibitors expand therapeutic options for 
tumors but pose challenges due to bleeding risks, especially in patients 
requiring anticoagulation therapy for cancer-associated hypercoagulability. 
Objectives This study aimed to evaluate whether combining anticoagulants with 
angiogenesis inhibitors increases bleeding risk in cancer patients. Methods A 
network meta-analysis was conducted based on PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials to compare bleeding risks with 
angiogenesis inhibitors alone versus their combination with anticoagulants. 
Furthermore, a real-world cohort of 645 patients receiving antiangiogenic 
therapies between January 2010 and June 2024 was performed. Patients were 
separated into two groups according to whether they were receiving concomitant 
anticoagulants. The primary outcome was all-grade bleeding events. Results Of 
2644 patients from 6 studies included in network meta-analysis, all-grade 
bleeding events were found in 614 (23.2%) patients. The addition of 
anticoagulation to either high-dose bevacizumab (10 or 15 mg/kg) (OR 4.95, 95% 
CI: 2.68-9.42) or antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (OR 2.2, 95% CI: 
1.08-4.44) significantly increased bleeding risk compared to antiangiogenic 
monotherapy, except for low-dose bevacizumab (5 or 7.5 mg/kg). In the cohort 
study, 163 patients matched in each group after propensity score matching 
weighting. Over a median follow-up duration of 56 days, there were 28 (17.2%) 
all-grade bleeding events during concurrent treatment and 16 (9.8%) all-grade 
bleeding events reported during antiangiogenic monotherapy. Conclusions Adding 
anticoagulation to high-dose bevacizumab or antiangiogenic TKIs might increase 
bleeding risk compared to monotherapy. Conversely, anticoagulants appeared to be 
safe in patients receiving low-dose bevacizumab.

Early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC), commonly defined as a CRC diagnosis before 
50 years of age, is rapidly increasing. Despite overt symptoms, younger patients 
with early-onset CRC endure prolonged diagnostic delays. This review urgently 
delineates the clinical barriers hindering earlier detection by outlining the 
key steps in the diagnostic pathways, including how symptom recognition and 
early detection are complicated by patient- and provider-level barriers. We also 
reiterate challenges and opportunities for improving secondary prevention 
through screening and primary prevention through lifestyle modification. 
Advancing early-onset CRC early detection and prevention requires a multipronged 
approach involving enhanced public awareness, innovation, and coordinated public 
health efforts.

The Relationship Between Insulin Resistance and Cancer in Humans.

An independent association between insulin resistance and cancer has been 
consistently reported in humans. Patients with cancer display insulin resistance 
or its clinical manifestations, and this metabolic adaptation precedes the 
clinical diagnosis of cancer. Insulin resistance in cancer patients is 
associated with a metabolic switch from oxidative metabolism toward glycolysis 
that spares oxygen to be used in anabolic processes and facilitates the fast 
production of energy and intermediate metabolites required for the rapid 
proliferation of cancer cells. In malignant cells, glucose consumption via 
glycolysis occurs under normoxic conditions (aerobic glycolysis). Pathogenic 
mechanisms underlying insulin resistance in cancer patients include 
hypoxia-inducible factor-1 upregulation and overproduction of cytokines, such as 
interferon, interleukin-6, interleukin-18, and interleukin-1β. Deficit of 
2-oxoglutarate (α-ketoglutarate) has been detected in cancer cells and may 
facilitate hypoxia-inducible factor-1 assembly and activity. Overproduction of 
cytokines in cancer patients follows activation of the immune system by abnormal 
nucleic acid variants. Anomalous DNA or RNA structures are recognized by immune 
sensors and stimulate signaling pathways that ultimately increase cytokine 
production. Likewise, interferon overproduction occurs in congenital disorders 
that feature ineffectively repaired DNA lesions, such as Werner syndrome, Bloom 
syndrome, mutations in DNA polymerase-δ1, and ataxia telangiectasia. These 
diseases cause simultaneous insulin resistance and a high tendency to develop 
cancer, highlighting the relationship between the two processes. Defectively 
repaired DNA injury endangers genomic integrity, predisposing to cancer, and 
activates the immune system to increase interferon production and subsequent 
insulin resistance. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and cytokines induce insulin 
resistance by suppressing peroxisome proliferator-activated-γ in the 
subcutaneous adipose tissue.

Cancer is a leading cause of mortality in older dogs. Despite the prevalence of 
chemotherapy in canine oncology, a good understanding of owners' observations of 
side effects and clinical signs in real time is still lacking. Owners' 
perceptions and reporting of clinical signs play an important role in monitoring 
a dog's condition during treatment and the use of digital owner-reported outcome 
measures could prove efficient in tracking chemotherapy side effects in the home 
environment. This could improve care and draws inspiration from the human use of 
patient-reported outcome measures in oncology. We aimed to develop and test a 
prototype digital measure for monitoring clinical signs and health-related 
quality of life in dogs undergoing chemotherapy, designed to facilitate owner 
participation in monitoring and support veterinary care. A rapid literature 
review was conducted to identify existing measures and their methodological 
limitations. Items were generated based on the Veterinary Comparative Oncology 
Group-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, existing client-reported 
outcome measures, and expert veterinary opinion. Proof-of-Concept testing was 
performed with 29 dog owners with pets undergoing chemotherapy. Participants 
completed daily assessments of their dog's clinical signs and weekly quality of 
life surveys over a 21-day period. A sub-sample participated in cognitive 
interviews to assess content validity and acceptability. Descriptive statistics 
were used to assess clinical signs and quality of life scores. Internal 
consistency and item discrimination were evaluated, and qualitative data were 
analyzed thematically. High adherence was reported, with a median of 21 daily 
and 3 weekly assessments completed. Participants found the assessments 
acceptable and beneficial. Fatigue, polydipsia, and anorexia were the most 
frequently reported clinical signs. Dogs experienced a median of 3 different 
clinical signs. The quality-of-life scale showed good internal consistency 
(Cronbach's α = 0.84). Participants appreciated the daily assessments, found 
them easy to complete, and believed the measure could help improve monitoring 
and decision-making during chemotherapy. The prototype tool, the Canine Cancer 
Outcome Measure (CAN-COM), demonstrated feasibility and acceptability for use by 
owners in the home environment for dogs undergoing chemotherapy. With further 
refinement and validation, such a tool could improve the monitoring of adverse 
events and support decision-making in veterinary oncology, enhancing the welfare 
of canine cancer patients.

Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) is a standard care for locally advanced rectal 
cancer (LARC), yet the immune remodeling mechanisms underlying its efficacy 
remain unclear. Using single-cell RNA, T cell receptor, and spatial 
transcriptome sequencing of matched pre- and post-treatment samples, we depicted 
the tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamics induced by different neoadjuvant 
therapies. TNT is associated with reduced regulatory T cells and increased 
IFNG+CD8+ effector memory T cells with high IFNG expression, potentially 
contributing to improved complete response rates. The abundance of 
tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells is correlated with the enrichment of the ACKR1+ 
endothelial subset after TNT. We further validated that endothelial cells (ECs), 
when stimulated by IFNγ, potentially released by CD8+ T cells, acquire an 
enhanced ability for presenting antigens and activating CD8+ T cells. Together, 
our study systematically characterizes the TME dynamics and uncovers the unique 
interaction between activated CD8+ T cells and ECs after TNT.

The spatial landscape of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is under 
significant investigation as a driver of immunotherapy resistance in solid 
tumors. Most work centers on constituent immune cells within intra-tumoral 
niches, overlooking tumor cell phenotypes. Yet cancer cells shape their milieu 
by multiple modalities, including secreting and depleting metabolites. Here, we 
argue that integrating cancer cell phenotypic heterogeneity into spatial 
analyses is essential to reveal the mechanisms that generate TIME diversity and 
to better address resistance to immunotherapy.

For resectable pancreatic cancer, upfront surgery followed by adjuvant therapy 
has long been the standard of care. A randomized trial by Bai et al. in Cancer 
Cell demonstrates that sequential neoadjuvant gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel 
followed by mFOLFIRINOX significantly improved event-free survival compared with 
upfront surgery, supporting a shift toward a sequential neoadjuvant approach in 
this setting.

To enhance the effectiveness of irradiation (IR) and optimize PD-1/PD-L1 
blockade therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we conducted in vivo 
CRISPR-Cas9 metabolic sublibrary screening, pinpointing UDP-glucose 
dehydrogenase (UGDH) as a key target. Post-IR, protein kinase R (PKR) 
translocates to the nucleus. There, elevated UGDH produces UDP-GlcUA, which 
binds PKR's dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD). This binding triggers PKR 
dimerization, autophosphorylation (T451), and activation. Activated PKR then 
phosphorylates TOP2A at S1467, inducing its liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) and enhancing topoisomerase activity, and finally protects tumor cells 
from IR-induced DNA damage. Disrupting the UDP-GlcUA/PKR complex reduces 
TOP2A-S1467 phosphorylation, lowers topoisomerase activity, increases cGAS-STING 
signaling, and improves anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy efficacy. Clinical HCC sample 
analysis confirmed the relevance of UDP-GlcUA and the phosphorylation of PKR and 
TOP2A in response to radiation. Critically, blood UDP-GlcUA may serve as a 
biomarker for PKR/TOP2A axis activation, guiding patient suitability for 
anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy after IR and enabling personalized treatment 
strategies.

The three-dimensional (3D) hydrophilic network of hydrogels can both load 
signalling substances and allow the penetration of ions and small molecular 
targets, while preventing biomacromolecules from contaminating electrode 
surfaces, making them promising for anti-biofouling electrochemical sensing of 
complex biological samples. However, the fragile mechanical structure and poor 
electronic conductivity of hydrogels usually result in low sensitivity of the 
hydrogel-based biosensing systems, severely limiting their widespread 
application. Herein, a mechanically robust and conductive ternary MXene/Au-Ag 
alloy nanocluster (Au-Ag NC)-bovine serum albumin (BSA) composite hydrogel is 
constructed via a facile ""one-pot"" route, with ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) 
MXene nanosheets acting as the reinforced skeleton of the hydrogel network 
composed of entangled denatured BSA chains and Au-Ag NCs. The incorporation of 
MXene nanosheets within the hydrogel matrix provides a continuous electronic 
conductive network, allowing efficient electrochemical excitation of 
BSA-protected Au-Ag NCs to generate enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) 
signals. The ternary composite hydrogel also exhibits excellent self-healing and 
enhanced swelling/deswelling properties, facilitating the construction of a 
robust hydrogel-based ECL platform for biothiol sensing, and ultrasensitive 
detection of a specific biothiol, glutathione (GSH), is achieved with a 
detection limit as low as 340 pM (S/N = 3). The platform can be directly applied 
for the analysis of complex biological samples, including distinguishing the GSH 
content in normal cell and cancer cell lysates and the detection of GSH in food 
samples, demonstrating its potential for future healthcare related applications, 
such as early diagnosis and food surveillance.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the overall survival of reproductive-age 
patients with non-myoinvasive stage IA1 grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancer.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study queried the Commission-on-Cancer's 
National Cancer Database. The study population included 21,248 patients with 
grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancer with the 2023 International Federation 
of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IA1 (tumor with no myoinvasion; n = 6249), 
IA2 (tumor with inner-half myoinvasion; n = 11,113), and IB (tumor with 
outer-half myoinvasion; n = 3886), who had primary hysterectomy from 2010 to 
2015. The main outcome measures were 5- and 10-year overall survival rates 
according to patient age (<40, 40-49, and ≥50 years) and cancer stage (IA1, IA2, 
and IB) stratifications.
RESULTS: Stage IA1 was the most frequent sub-stage until age 45 years. The 
median follow-up was 8.3 (interquartile range; 6.8-10.0) years. Among patients 
aged <40 years, the 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 100% and 98.7% 
(95% confidence interval [CI] 94.7 to 99.7) for stage IA1, 97.6% (95% Cl 94.7 to 
98.9) and 94.4% (95% CI 88.1 to 97.4) for stage IA2, and 100% and 95.2% (95% CI 
82.3 to 98.8) for stage IB, respectively (p-overall = .009). Among patients aged 
40 to 49 years, the 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 99.3% (95% CI 
98.4 to 99.7) and 96.5% (95% CI 94.4 to 97.8) for stage IA1, 98.1% (95% Cl 96.9 
to 98.8) and 94.4% (95% CI 92.1 to 96.0) for stage IA2 and 96.0% (95% CI 90.6 to 
98.3) and 86.5% (95% CI 77.5 to 92.0) for stage IB, respectively (p-overall < 
.001). Among patients aged ≥50 years, the 5- and 10-year overall survival rates 
were 96.2% (95% CI 85.6 to 96.7) and 88.5% (95% CI 87.3 to 89.6) for stage IA1, 
94.9% (95% CI 94.4 to 95.3) and 85.7% (95% CI 84.8 to 86.6) for stage IA2, and 
92.1% (95% CI 91.2 to 93.0) and 78.0% (95% CI 76.3 to 79.6) for stage IB, 
respectively (p-overall < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: This cohort study found that reproductive-age patients, 
particularly, adolescent and young adults, with non-myoinvasive stage IA1 grade 
1 endometrioid endometrial cancer have favorable prognosis. These data may be 
used as the benchmark setting the foundation for future investigation on 
fertility-sparing options.

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the deadliest gynecologic cancer in women. 
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critically involved in malignant progression 
by modulating proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, metastasis, and chemotherapy 
resistance. The long noncoding RNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 29 (SNHG29) is 
involved in multiple malignancies, although its role in EOC has not been 
elucidated. In our study, SNHG29 expression was significantly downregulated in 
EOC tissues and was negatively related to lymphatic invasion in EOC patients 
according to data from the TCGA database. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
revealed that among patients with early stage EOC, compared with patients with 
low SNHG29 expression levels, patients with high expression levels had markedly 
longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) times. Further 
studies suggested that SNHG29 knockdown enhanced the invasive and migrative 
potential of EOC cells, whereas SNHG29 overexpression attenuated the invasive 
and migrative potential capacity. In animal experiments, SNHG29 knockdown 
significantly promoted lung metastasis in tail vein injection models. 
Mechanistically, the downregulation of SNHG29 expression inhibited its 
competitive endogenous RNA activity, resulting in increased miR-20b-3p 
availability and subsequent degradation of the downstream target gene GNAI3, as 
determined by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and luciferase reporter gene assays. 
miR-20b-3p inhibition significantly reduces the invasive and metastatic 
capabilities of EOC cells resulting from a reduction in SNHG29 expression. Our 
study revealed that SNHG29 may be a promising prognostic factor and therapeutic 
target for EOC.

PURPOSE: Lazertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has demonstrated high blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
penetration in preclinical studies. Similarly, pemetrexed has shown effective 
BBB penetration and survival benefit in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LM). This study evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of lazertinib plus pemetrexed in patients with EGFR-mutant 
NSCLC and LM.
METHODS: This prospective, phase II, single-arm, multi-center study enrolled 
patients with NSCLC and EGFR mutations and cytologically confirmed LM across six 
hospitals in Korea. Patients received lazertinib (240 mg daily) and pemetrexed 
(500 mg/m2 every three weeks). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). 
Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) cytology conversion rate, quality of life, and safety. 
Pharmacokinetics were evaluated through CSF and plasma sampling.
RESULTS: Among 36 patients treated with lazertinib plus pemetrexed, the overall 
response and disease control rates were 24.1 % and 96.6 %, respectively. Median 
PFS and OS were 9.3 and 9.9 months, respectively. CSF cytology conversion rates 
were 9.4 % and 11.5 % at the second and third cycles, respectively. OS and 
CSF/plasma concentration ratios demonstrated significant correlation in cycle 3. 
Adverse events occurred in 66.7 % of patients, with peripheral neuropathy 
(33.3 %) and cutaneous reactions (33.3 %) being the most common. Significant 
improvements in quality of life and neurological symptoms were noted.
CONCLUSIONS: Lazertinib plus pemetrexed demonstrated promising intracranial 
efficacy, OS benefits, and improved quality of life, highlighting its potential 
as a treatment option for EGFR-mutant NSCLC and LM, particularly in previously 
treated patients.

OBJECTIVES: Two major clinical trials have proven lung cancer screening (LCS) to 
be effective in reducing lung cancer-specific mortality. However, mortality 
reduction in the trials was only 20%. Our objective is to identify the causes 
contributing to lung cancer-specific death in our screening population.
METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed all patients who were enrolled in our 
healthcare system's lung cancer screening program between January 2015 and June 
2023. Chart reviews were performed of all patients who died after lung cancer 
diagnosis to first determine whether the death was attributed to lung cancer. We 
then performed a chart review to identify contributing factors to death, 
including: advanced stage at initial diagnosis; non-compliance; missed nodules; 
aggressive cancers; recurrence; and treatment complications.
RESULTS: During study period, 15,762 patients were screened, 694 were diagnosed 
with lung cancer, and 112 deaths were attributed directly to lung cancer. 
Potentially modifiable factors contributing to lung cancer-specific death 
accounted for the majority of causes (66/112; 59%), with advanced stage at 
initial diagnosis being the leading factor (28/112; 25%) followed by 
non-compliance (26/112; 23%) and missed nodules on CT (12/112; 11%). 
Non-modifiable contributing factors included development of an aggressive lung 
cancer (16/112; 14%), cancer recurrence after early stage (14/112; 13%), 
development of a second lung cancer (10/112; 9%), and treatment complications 
(6/112; 5%).
CONCLUSION: Potentially modifiable factors contributed to the majority of lung 
cancer-related deaths in our screening program. Interventions to improve uptake 
of screening and follow-up may be able to improve the efficacy of lung cancer 
screening programs.

INTRODUCTION: Thoracic SMARCA4-Deficient Undifferentiated Tumors (SMARCA4-UT) 
are highly aggressive malignancies with poor prognosis. There is currently no 
standardized treatment strategy. We aimed to investigate the characteristics of 
the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in SMARCA4-UT, and evaluate the impact 
of TIME on treatment efficacy and prognosis.
METHODS: Multiplex immunofluorescence staining was performed on tumor tissue 
specimens from 29 SMARCA4-UT cases and 25 SMARCA4-intact non-small cell lung 
cancer (SMARCA4-iNSCLC) cases to quantify the density, proportion, and spatial 
proximity of CD8+ T cells, M2 macrophages, neutrophils, FOXP3+ cells, and IFNα+ 
cells within the immune landscape, and to assess their associations with 
treatment efficacy and prognosis.
RESULTS: Lower infiltration of CD8+T cells and IFNα+ cells, but higher 
infiltration of M2 macrophages in the overall immune landscape, was observed in 
SMARCA4-UT compared with SMARCA4-iNSCLC (P < 0.05). Patients with higher CD8+T 
cells and IFNα+ cells infiltration had longer overall survival (OS) following 
immunotherapy. Multivariate Cox regression identified high CD8+T cell 
infiltration as an independent protective prognostic factor in the SMARCA4-UT 
group (HR = 0.204, P = 0.017). Within the TIME of SMARCA4-UT, CD8+T cells, 
FOXP3+ cells, and IFNα+ cells were located in closer proximity to M2 
macrophages. The distance between individual M2 macrophages was significantly 
shorter; conversely, neutrophils were positioned further away from M2 
macrophages (P < 0.05). Further, greater distance between M2 macrophages and 
CD8+T cells correlated with better prognosis (HR = 0.834, P = 0.047) and a 
significantly longer median OS (P = 0.016).
CONCLUSION: The TIME of SMARCA4-UT is characterized by an immune-desert 
phenotype, and higher CD8+T cells infiltration is associated with improved 
immunotherapeutic efficacy. Spatial proximity between M2 macrophages and 
multiple immune cell subsets within the TIME of SMARCA4-UT is markedly 
increased.

Ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8) gene has been identified as being 
significantly amplified and overexpressed in Ovarian carcinoma (OC), and thus 
led to unfavorable clinical outcomes, implying that inhibition of USP8 may be a 
therapeutic strategy for OC. Herein, a structure-based discovery and bioassays 
were conducted to identify novel inhibitors of USP8. we employed a novel 
platform that integrates docking/molecular dynamics (MD) simulation/binding free 
energy calculations/root-mean-square deviation (RMSD)/USP8 enzyme activity assay 
to screen a library of bioactive compounds including 30000 compounds. we 
identified that Isoginkgetin exhibited promising inhibitory activity on USP8 
with an IC50 value of 12.68 μM. Moreover, Isoginkgetin could significantly 
inhibit OC cell growth by suppressing cell proliferation and reducing colony 
formation, and promoting Fe2+ accumulation, ROS production, thereby triggering 
cell death. These suppressive effects were successfully reversed by 
Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). Mechanistically, Isoginkgetin decreased USP8 levels, 
leading to ubiquitin degradation and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) 
instability, and it stimulated ferroptosis. Ultimately, our results support 
Isoginkgetin as a potent inhibitor of USP8, the inhibition of which may be a 
promising therapeutic strategy for OC.

Nanoparticles (NPs) are considered an effective and accurate approach for 
targeted drug delivery. This research focuses on modifying human serum albumin 
(HSA) with folic acid (FA) to enhance the targeted delivery of bleomycin (BLM) 
to gastric cancer cells. The structure and properties of FA-HSA-BLM formulated 
NPs were effectively analyzed. The methods utilized included dynamic light 
scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy 
(AFM), and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis). The rate of drug release 
was measured. The toxicity and viability percentages of various treatments, 
including BLM, FA-HSA, and FA-BLM-HSA, were evaluated using the 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. 
Molecular docking models were created to examine the interactions between the 
BLM drug and AKT1, Caspase-3, NF1, and P21, aiming to identify potential binding 
sites. The results demonstrate that the drug release is pH-dependent, exhibits 
high loading efficiency, and possesses sustained release capabilities in this 
nano-formulation. The cytotoxic effects of FA-HSA-BLM NPs on SNU-5 cell lines 
indicate extended anticancer activity. RT-PCR was employed to assess the 
expression levels of the Caspase-3, NF1, p21, and Akt1 genes in tumor cells. 
Expression levels of Caspase-3 and NF1 genes were elevated, while p21 and Akt1 
gene expression levels were decreased. Tumor cells (SNU-5) and healthy cells 
(CCL-241) exhibit no response to bare FA-HSA NPs. An analysis of the results 
confirmed that the formulated NPs (FA-BLM-HSA) exhibit significant therapeutic 
activity against gastric cancer, as indicated by their cell toxicity profile and 
the induction of apoptosis.

Cancer metastasis causes the majority of cancer-related deaths. During 
metastasis, invasive tumor cells enter the bloodstream and become circulating 
tumor cells. These cells eventually populate the secondary organs. In addition 
to genetic mutations, epigenetic changes (such as DNA methylation, histone 
modifications, and noncoding RNA-associated changes) are important for 
regulating gene expression and preserving chromatin integrity in tumor cells. 
Dysregulation of these epigenetic patterns is critical for carcinogenesis, tumor 
growth, and metastatic spread. We presented an overview of CTC biology, 
including essential mechanisms such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
and immune evasion. We discussed how epigenetic reprogramming of CTCs also 
occurs post-transcriptionally via non coding RNAs, The subject then moves to how 
epigenetic changes in CTCs affect these processes throughout migration, survival 
in circulation, and metastatic seeding. The following sections discuss the 
clinical implications of addressing CTC epigenetics, proposing CTC epigenetic 
changes as prospective biomarkers for early cancer detection, prognosis, and 
targeted therapy intervention to improve patient outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Workforce shortages and rising demand for MRI have increased 
interest in clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) to standardise imaging 
workflows. The Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) committee 
recommends real-time radiologist input to guide MRI pathways, but workforce 
constraints may limit consistent implementation. This systematic review examined 
CDSSs used in prostate MRI, including decision tools, nomograms, and risk 
calculators, to identify the clinical and MRI-derived variables they incorporate 
and assess their relevance for future development.
METHODS: A systematic search of Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL, Web of Science, and 
ProQuest was conducted in June 2025. Eligible studies were original research 
published in English since January 2015 describing development, validation, or 
clinical use of a CDSS using structured clinical and MRI-derived variables for 
prostate cancer diagnosis, pre-biopsy risk stratification, or staging. Exclusion 
criteria included radiomics-only studies, non-primary research, studies without 
MRI variables, and those lacking external validation. Two reviewers 
independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using 
PROBAST. Certainty of evidence was appraised using the GRADE framework.
RESULTS: Twenty-two studies met inclusion criteria: fifteen evaluated nomograms, 
five described risk calculators, and two reported predictive models. None 
assessed a fully implemented CDSS. Common predictors included PI-RADS (82 %), 
prostate-specific antigen density (64 %), age (64 %), prostate-specific antigen 
(41 %), and prostate volume (23 %). Most tools showed strong discriminative 
accuracy (AUC >0.80), though calibration and decision curve analysis were 
inconsistently reported.
CONCLUSION: Validated clinical and MRI predictors support robust CDSSs, but 
heterogeneity and lack of implementation limit evidence. Prospective multicentre 
validation is needed.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Radiographer-facing tools integrating key predictors 
could guide contrast use, staging, and workflow decisions, improve diagnostic 
accuracy and reduce unnecessary contrast administration.

Matriptase is a type II transmembrane serine protease implicated in epithelial 
integrity and cancer progression, making it a promising therapeutic target. 
However, the development of highly selective matriptase inhibitors remains a 
major challenge due to its structural homologies and similar proteolytic 
specificities with related proteases such as TMPRSS6. In this study, we 
investigated a series of cyclic peptides derived from the frog-skin Bowman-Birk 
inhibitor HV-BBI, focusing on their inhibitory activity and selectivity toward 
matriptase. Among them, compound 6, a 13-residue monocyclic peptide with a 
C-terminal amide, emerged as a standout candidate, demonstrating nanomolar 
potency and remarkable 1000-fold selectivity over TMPRSS6. Unexpectedly, when 
the C-terminal amide was replaced with a carboxylate group, the compound 
exhibited a significant loss of potency against matriptase. Moreover, 
structure-activity relationship studies, including alanine scanning and 
C-terminal residue substitutions, revealed that residues Lys5, Ser6, Ile7, and 
Arg10 are critical for matriptase binding, while the C-terminal Phe13 is less 
essential. Molecular dynamics simulations highlighted key inter- and 
intramolecular interactions that stabilize the peptide-enzyme complex and 
explain the superior potency of compound 6 compared to its analogues. 
Importantly, compound 6 retained its inhibitory activity in a cellular model 
without inducing cytotoxicity. These findings establish HV-BBI-derived peptides 
as promising scaffolds for the development of highly selective matriptase 
inhibitors and provide valuable structural insights for future therapeutic 
design.

Aromatase inhibition remains a key therapeutic strategy for hormone-dependent 
breast cancer (HDBC). Among non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs), 
letrozole and anastrozole are well-established treatments. To further probe 
structure-function relationships within the human aromatase active site, we 
synthesized a library of 42 novel azole derivatives. Several compounds displayed 
nanomolar inhibitory activity, with potencies approaching that of letrozole in 
vivo, while maintaining favorable selectivity against other steroidogenic 
enzymes. Notably, benzoselenazolinone 75 emerged as the most promising 
candidate, exhibiting potency comparable to letrozole with improved in vitro 
selectivity, thereby justifying further evaluation in vivo.

One promising target for creating new anticancer medications is 
phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K). Many human malignancies, including brain, 
colon, endometrial, breast, and prostate cancers, have been linked to PI3K 
dysregulation. The genes for PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PIK3CD, and PIK3CG are encoded by 
the various isoforms of the PI3K kinase, which are α, β, δ, and γ. Present 
treatments fail to alleviate symptoms because of certain gene mutations or 
protein overexpression. There have been encouraging therapeutic findings from 
using many newly discovered inhibitors of the PI3K signaling pathway, which 
target different isoforms of the kinase. Several inhibitors with medicinally 
privileged scaffolds have been developed to target the PI3K pathway or a 
specific isoform. The PI3K inhibitors GDC-0032 and INK1117 for PI3K-α and 
AZD8186 for PI3K-β are now being studied in clinical trials. Research on the 
clinical development, therapeutic utility, and structural insights of new PI3K 
inhibitors is the main emphasis of this review. The inhibitors have been shown 
promising anticancer activity relationships.

Chlorpyrifos (CPF), an organophosphate pesticide (OPP) is used to control wide 
range of pests and is known for its well-established neurotoxic effects. 
However, its implications in non-neurological disorders such as cancer, 
particularly via epigenetic alterations is underexplored. To determine whether 
chronic exposure to CPF influences liver cancer development through the 
epigenetic mechanisms, we employed 'Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS)' to 
comprehensively assess the epigenetic alterations induced by CPF in liver cells. 
Our findings revealed that prolonged exposure to sub-lethal doses of CPF 
(4.07 μM) induces global and gene-specific DNA methylation changes in the liver 
cells. Notably, we found significant differentially methylated genes (DMGs) 
enriched across the genome that are primarily involved in liver cancer. Further, 
functional validation studies (mRNA and protein expression studies) revealed the 
hypomethylation of oncogenic hub genes such as, FoxO1 and HSPA5; 
hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes such as SMAD4 and PARP1, which plays 
a major role in cell cycle regulation, DNA damage and stress response pathways. 
Alterations in these molecular targets suggested that chronic CPF exposure 
disrupts normal epigenetic regulation, potentially shifting the normal cells 
toward cancer development. Overall, the study highlights the impact of chronic 
CPF exposure on epigenetics mediated induction of liver cell transformation. The 
observed epigenetic signature caused by CPF when integrated with the proteomic 
profile could help us identify putative biomarkers for early detection of CPF- 
induced liver cancer among the CPF exposed population.

Natural killer (NK) cells have long been recognized as central antitumor 
effectors capable of eliminating transformed cells without prior sensitization. 
However, recent studies reveal a more nuanced reality: NK cells can also act as 
regulators that hinder CD8⁺ T-cell immunity and blunt the efficacy of immune 
checkpoint blockade (ICB). Two back-to-back in Cancer Discovery provide 
compelling mechanistic insights. Pozniak et al. demonstrate that cytotoxic NK 
cells accumulate in immune-excluded melanoma, where they are recruited via 
CX3CR1 and prevent CD8⁺ T-cell infiltration, thereby limiting responses to 
anti-PD-1 therapy. In parallel, Song et al. show that (TANKs) cells compete with 
CD8⁺ T cells for IL-2 and type I interferons (IFN-I; mainly IFN-α/β), disrupting 
effector differentiation and reducing ICB sensitivity. Collectively, these 
findings underscore the dual nature of NK cells as both killers and regulators 
whose context-dependent activity can either amplify or suppress antitumor 
immunity. Therapeutically, strategies to deplete, block, or reprogram 
suppressive NK subsets while preserving their cytotoxic and dendritic cell 
(DC)-recruiting functions may help overcome resistance and enhance the 
durability of checkpoint blockade.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to study the association between the Global 
Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) categories of gastrointestinal 
cancer patients and treatment outcomes.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Prospective cohort study of patients with esophageal, gastric, 
pancreatic, colon or rectal cancers, in which nutritional status was assessed by 
GLIM at three hospitals. Sociodemographic, clinical, nutritional parameters 
(changes in weight, calf circumference and handgrip-strength from admission to 
discharge) and treatment outcomes (mortality up to 12 months, occurrence of 
infectious complications, length of hospital stay, readmissions at 90 days) were 
recorded. Logistic, survival regression or generalized multilevel linear 
multivariable models were used depending on the outcome variable.
RESULTS: Of the 519 patients included, 283 (54.53%) were categorized as having 
no malnutrition, 122 (23.51%) as moderate and 114 (21.97%) as severe 
malnutrition. The multivariate analysis showed no difference between GLIM 
categories in 30-day mortality, 90-day readmission or infectious complications. 
Differences were found in 90-day mortality between those with moderate and 
severe malnutrition compared to the group with no malnutrition; in mortality at 
up to one year, differences were found between patients with severe malnutrition 
and those with no malnutrition. There were no differences between the groups 
with moderate or severe malnutrition and those with no malnutrition in either 
length of hospital stay or change in nutritional parameters between admission 
and discharge.
CONCLUSION: In this sample, GLIM classification was found to be related to 
outcomes in 90-day and one-year mortality but not to other clinical parameters 
or changes in nutritional parameters.

Herein, a novel methylene blue (MB) and tris(2,2'-bipyridine)ruthenium 
dichloride (Ru(bpy)3Cl2) co-sensitized benzo-(1,2; 3,4; 
5,6)-tris(thiophene-2'-carboxylic acid) (H3BTTC) structure was developed to 
fabricate a photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor for ultrasensitive detection of 
miRNA-155 related to breast cancer. In comparison with traditional organic 
sensitization structure, the exploited co-sensitized structure of 
H3BTTC/MB/Ru(bpy)3Cl2 by developing suitable DNA nanostructures to label MB and 
immobilize Ru(bpy)3Cl2 as dual sensitizers, not only overcame the drawback of 
the difficult immobilization for organic sensitizers, but also settled the 
problem of light coverage caused by layer-by-layer coating of organic materials 
on the electrode upper layer. Significantly, the H3BTTC/MB/Ru(bpy)3Cl2 possessed 
a well-matched cascade energy level on account of modifying two narrower band 
gap dyes MB and Ru(bpy)3Cl2 on wide band gap H3BTTC, which contributed to 
accelerating charge separation and facilitating electron transfer, thereby 
enhancing photoelectric conversion efficiency and greatly promoting photocurrent 
response. Based on the H3BTTC/MB/Ru(bpy)3Cl2 signal indicator and target 
recycling amplification-induced the hyperbranched hybridization chain reaction, 
an ultrasensitive PEC biosensor was constructed for analysis of miRNA-155 with a 
detection limit as low as 0.37 fM. This work provided a new avenue for the 
construction and design of highly efficient sensitization strategies for 
photoactive materials in PEC detection, presenting potential applications in 
bioanalysis and disease diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Treatment options for advanced solid tumors are limited. In recent 
years, anti-programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 
(PD-1/PD-L1) immunotherapy as monotherapy has shown significant efficacy, albeit 
in a limited subset of patients. In the MOVIE trial, metronomic chemotherapy was 
combined with two immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to improve clinical 
outcomes in patients with advanced solid tumors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: MOVIE was a phase I/II French, multicenter, open-label, 
nonrandomized study with a Bayesian design that evaluated the antitumor activity 
and safety of metronomic vinorelbine associated with durvalumab plus 
tremelimumab. Here, we report on the cohort of patients with head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) from the MOVIE phase II study. Patients were 
aged ≥18 years with histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic HNSCC, 
resistant to conventional therapies, and presented a measurable disease 
according to RECIST version 1.1. They received oral vinorelbine 40 mg three 
times a week, and durvalumab 1500 mg plus tremelimumab 75 mg via intravenous 
infusion on day 1 of 28-day cycles, for a maximum of four cycles of 
tremelimumab. The primary endpoint was the clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined 
as the rate of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease 
(SD) lasting at least 24 weeks.
RESULTS: Fifteen HNSCC patients were included between May 2019 and October 2020. 
The mean estimated CBR according to a noninformative prior distribution was 
23.5% (95% credible interval 7.3-45.6). One patient achieved CR, 1 PR, and 1 SD 
> 24 weeks, leading to an objective response rate of 14.3%. The median 
progression-free survival was 1.8 months (95% confidence interval 1.0-1.9 
months), and the median overall survival was 8 months (95% confidence interval 
2.5-12.7 months). The most common vinorelbine-related grade ≥3 adverse events 
were anemia (n = 2, 13%) and neutropenia (n = 3, 20%). The most common 
ICI-related grade ≥3 adverse events were anemia (n = 1) and hypokalemia (n = 1). 
There were no treatment interruptions for toxicity and no treatment-related 
deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Metronomic vinorelbine in combination with dual durvalumab plus 
tremelimumab immunotherapy had only moderate activity in pretreated advanced 
HNSCC.

BACKGROUND: The PHERGain trial demonstrated that an 
[18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ([18F]FDG)-positron emission tomography 
(PET)-based, pathological complete response (pCR)-adapted strategy could be 
safely utilized to avoid chemotherapy (CT) in patients with human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer (EBC) receiving 
neoadjuvant dual anti-HER2 blockade [trastuzumab and pertuzumab (HP)]. Due to 
the limited availability of [18F]FDG-PET, this study evaluated breast magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) as an alternative for early treatment response 
assessment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Group B patients (n = 285) initially received two cycles 
of HP, with subsequent CT introduction if [18F]FDG-PET showed no response. 
[18F]FDG-PET and MRI were conducted before randomization and after two cycles 
(early). An additional MRI was carried out before surgery (late). Concordance 
between [18F]FDG-PET, MRI reduction, and MRI response by RECIST v.1.1 was 
evaluated, along with accuracy to predict pCR and 3-year invasive disease-free 
survival (iDFS) rates.
RESULTS: Early imaging assessment showed good accuracy (78.2%) between 
[18F]FDG-PET and breast MRI tumor reduction (any shrinkage), but not when 
applying RECIST v.1.1 response criteria (≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters 
of target lesions). There were higher pCR rates in [18F]FDG-PET responders with 
early MRI reduction (39.0% versus 29.6% if no reduction) or MRI response (44.0% 
versus 30.4% if no response). [18F]FDG-PET non-responders without MRI reduction 
had the lowest pCR (21.7%) and 3-year iDFS (75.3%) rates despite receiving CT. 
Among [18F]FDG-PET responders, early MRI complete responses (CRs) were uncommon, 
but extending CT-free treatment increased early MRI CR (9.3%-31.7%) and 
objective response rates (55.1%-70.0%). Late MRI CR predicted pCR better in 
hormone receptor (HR)-negative than in HR-positive tumors (positive predictive 
value: 85.5% versus 61.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Although [18F]FDG-PET is the recommended imaging technique for 
guiding treatment in HER2-positive EBC patients following the PHERGain strategy, 
this unplanned analysis suggests that tumor shrinkage assessed by breast MRI 
could be a viable alternative for adaptive strategies in settings where 
[18F]FDG-PET is not available.

BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are used across many tumor types 
in perioperative and advanced settings. However, most patients discontinue 
treatment due to disease progression, adverse events, or other reasons. Clinical 
benefit of using ICIs following discontinuation is not well defined.
METHODS: We analyzed the literature examining ICI treatment outcomes after 
progression or discontinuation in different tumor types. We extracted data from 
51 studies, assessed the strength of the evidence, summarized treatment options, 
and identified gaps in our understanding.
RESULTS: We proposed definitions for the different scenarios of subsequent 
treatment with ICIs. In melanoma, studies frequently reported complete response 
(CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) following subsequent ICI 
therapy. In renal cell carcinoma, discordant results have been reported 
following subsequent ICI treatment; some trials reported CR/PR cases, whereas 
others did not show any CR/PR. In non-small-cell lung cancer, we found frequent 
reports of PR or SD but not CR following subsequent ICI treatment, although 
studies had small patient cohorts. Subsequent ICI treatment showed efficacy in 
some patients with urothelial carcinoma, but the small cohort sizes limited the 
strength of the evidence. One cross-tumor study investigated subsequent ICI 
treatment after initial discontinuation and reported a few PR and SD without any 
CR.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence supporting the efficacy of subsequent ICI treatment is 
strongest in melanoma, but the level of evidence remains low overall. 
Prospective studies and improved reporting of subsequent ICI therapy in existing 
trials investigating long-term outcomes, standardized predictive factors, and 
treatment modalities are warranted.

BACKGROUND: Most patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2)-positive breast cancer develop resistance or relapse. Zanidatamab is a 
novel, humanized, dual-HER2-targeted bispecific antibody with antitumor activity 
and a manageable safety profile as monotherapy in HER2-positive cancers. This 
trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of zanidatamab with docetaxel as 
first-line treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer.
METHODS: Cohort 1 of this open-label, multicenter, phase Ib/II trial enrolled 
adult patients from China or South Korea with histologically or cytologically 
confirmed unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic HER2-positive 
breast cancer. Patients received intravenous zanidatamab 30 mg/kg with docetaxel 
75 mg/m2 or a flat dose of zanidatamab 1800 mg with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 once 
every 3 weeks. Primary objectives were to evaluate the preliminary antitumor 
activity, safety, and tolerability of zanidatamab with docetaxel.
RESULTS: At data cut-off (7 December 2023), 38 patients were enrolled in cohort 
1; median study follow-up was 24.8 months. The confirmed objective response rate 
was 90.9%, disease control rate was 97.0%, and median duration of response was 
23.5 months. Median time to response was 5.9 weeks. Median progression-free and 
overall survival were 22.1 months and 36.9 months, respectively. All patients 
experienced one or more treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE), and 71.1% 
experienced grade ≥3 TEAEs. All patients had one or more treatment-related AE 
(TRAE), and 97.4% experienced zanidatamab-related TRAEs. Serious TEAEs were 
reported for 31.6% of patients: 18.4% had serious TRAEs, all of which were 
zanidatamab related. One death due to respiratory failure was recorded but was 
assessed as not related to study treatment. TEAEs and TRAEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation were recorded for 10.5% and 7.9% of patients, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Zanidatamab demonstrated efficacy and a manageable and tolerable 
safety profile with docetaxel as first-line treatment in patients with 
HER2-positive breast cancer. These data support the further development of 
zanidatamab in this patient population.

BACKGROUND: Precision oncology has evolved from concept to clinical reality, 
advancing cancer treatment and drug development in the last decade. However, 
disparities persist in patient access to comprehensive genomic profiling and 
matched therapies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of all patients 
enrolled in the Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO) precision medicine 
program (PMP) between 2014 and 2024. Tumor profiling outcomes were reviewed, 
focusing on actionable alterations, classified by the European Society for 
Medical Oncology Scale for Clinical Actionability of Molecular Targets (ESCAT). 
Interpretation and therapy prioritization were standardized through regular 
multidisciplinary molecular tumor boards. Key performance indicators (KPIs) 
included the proportions of patients with ESCAT tier I-IV alterations and those 
receiving matched therapies, either via clinical trials or approved regimens. 
The analysis also considered advances in molecular diagnostics, such as liquid 
biopsies, and the evolving clinical trial portfolio requiring biomarkers.
RESULTS: From 2014 to 2024, 12 168 unique patients underwent 13 718 multi-gene 
molecular profiles at VHIO PMP. The detection rate of actionable alterations 
increased substantially over time, from 10.1% in 2014 to 53.1% in 2024, 
paralleling advances in drug biomarkers, sequencing technology, and broader use 
of assays. Overall, 10.1% of patients received molecularly matched therapies, 
rising from 1% in 2014 to 14.2% in 2024. Among patients with actionable 
alterations, 23.5% received targeted therapies, with annual rates ranging from 
19.5% to 32.7%. Liquid biopsy integration notably enhanced actionable target 
detection and therapy access. The proportion of clinical trials with molecular 
inclusion criteria varied, starting at 40.2% in 2014 and dropping to 19.4% in 
2020 before rising to 34.2% in 2024.
CONCLUSION: Over a decade, VHIO's institutionally integrated PMP has enabled 
robust actionable alteration detection and access to matched therapies. 
Standardized KPI monitoring enables ongoing evaluation and sustainability of 
program performance. Continued innovation in diagnostics and molecularly guided 
trials is essential for further progress in precision oncology.

This study presents the first comprehensive research on inhalable microplastics 
(iMPs, <10 μm), a notorious subset of airborne microplastics (AMPs). To identify 
human health risk, ambient iMPs concentrations were assessed at human breathing 
height across the markets of four major Indian cities. With winter evening being 
the highest iMPs concentration, in Kolkata (14.23 µg/m3), followed by Delhi 
(14.18 µg/m3), linked to the highest footfalls, use of synthetic clothing, and 
poor waste management. Coastal cities (Chennai: 4 µg/m3, and Mumbai: 2.65 µg/m3) 
showed lower levels, likely due to improved air circulation, less winter, and 
reduced apparel, confirmed by Principal Component Analysis. Py-GC-MS quantified 
11 polymers, with PET (Polyester) from textiles as the most abundant, followed 
by PE and SBR from single-use plastics, packaging, vehicles, and footwear. Urban 
areas in India show an average iMPs concentration of 8.8 µg/m3, translating to a 
lifetime lung load of ∼2.9 g/person. Furthermore, this investigation highlights 
the risks of iMPs-associated tracers such as diethyl phthalates and lead. This 
pioneering research is the first-ever study to explore AMPs carrier capabilities 
for ultrafine particulate matter, PTEs, POPs, PPCPs, and microbes. During peak 
exposure periods like autumn festivals, AMPs harbored diverse microbial 
communities, including pathogenic (Aspergillus fumigatus) and new strains of 
bacteria/fungi with antibiotic resistance and virulence factor genes. This 
suggests that microbes carried by iMPs possess enhanced pathogenicity and 
resistance against broad-spectrum drugs like tetracycline and are more likely to 
be multidrug-resistant. Cross-referencing toxicological databases revealed that 
exposure to AMPs-linked modern-day contaminants elevates the risk of cancer, 
gastrointestinal, endocrine, breast, and respiratory diseases.

Household air pollution (HAP) is a global health burden affecting about half of 
the world's population. In Xuanwei, China, individuals experience high 
concentrations of various HAP constituents, particularly polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs). Here, the association between HAP constituents and 
cause-specific mortality from stomach and esophageal cancer was investigated. 
The study was conducted in a cohort of 42,420 subjects from Xuanwei, China. 
Participants were followed from 1976 to 2011. Type of fuel used was collected 
through a questionnaire and categorized into lifetime smoky vs. other fuel use. 
Annual exposures were predicted for 43 HAP constituents and 5 clusters were 
identified using hierarchical clustering. Cox regression was used to estimate 
the association between lifetime smoky coal use and pollutant clusters with 
stomach (n = 143) and esophageal (n = 39) cancer. All models were stratified by 
sex and birth cohort and adjusted for smoking status and education. Lifetime 
smoky coal use (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.40, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.00, 
1.96) and a large PAH cluster, PAH37 (HR = 1.59, 95 % CI: 1.19, 2.13 per 
standard deviation [SD]), were associated with stomach cancer mortality. 
Similarly, lifetime smoky coal use (HR = 2.84, 95 % CI:1.38, 5.85) and PAH37 
(HR = 1.75, 95 % CI: 1.01, 3.04 per SD) were associated with esophageal cancer 
mortality. Stratified analyses found that the association between PAH37 and 
stomach cancer was higher among women compared to men (P-interaction = 0.02). 
This study identified an association between HAP and risk of stomach and 
esophageal cancer mortality in a highly exposed population. Future work is 
needed to investigate potential risk differences by timing of exposure.

BACKGROUND: Platinum-resistant or refractory epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) 
remains a significant clinical challenge, often leading to rapid progression and 
poor prognosis. Palliative treatments aimed at improving quality of life are 
warranted.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and potential benefits of Pressurized 
IntraPeritoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC) in patients with platinum-resistant 
or refractory EOC.
METHODS: Prospective multicenter observational study (2016-2023).
PRIMARY ENDPOINT: feasibility, defined as completion of ≥3 planned PIPAC cycles 
within 120 days without ≥ grade 3 treatment related adverse events (CTCAE v5.0). 
Secondary endpoints: safety; disease control (RECIST 1.1); changes in Peritoneal 
Cancer Index and Fagotti score; ascites control; CA-125 response; conversion to 
cytoreductive surgery (±HIPEC); and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled. Ninety-seven percent of procedures were 
completed. Feasibility was 65.0 % (26/40; 95 % CI 49.51-77.87); no grade ≥3 
events occurred. Key secondary outcomes included a clinical benefit rate of 35 % 
in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and 53.8 % in the per-protocol (PP) 
population, median time to ascites resolution of one cycle, and median overall 
survival of 14 months (17 months in PP). Higher white blood cell count and 
ascites volume were significantly associated with progression (p = 0.035 and 
p = 0.025). Three platinum-refractory patients became eligible for surgery, two 
underwent optimal cytoreduction. Median OS was 14 months (17 months in PP). A 
non-significant trend toward longer OS was observed in platinum-refractory 
versus platinum-resistant disease (18 vs 9 months; p = 0.093).
CONCLUSIONS: PIPAC is a feasible, well-tolerated option in platinum-resistant 
and refractory EOC with potential to stabilize disease, relieve ascites and 
enable surgery in selected cases.

BACKGROUND: Currently, contradictions remain regarding the causal relationship 
between telomere length (TL) and ovarian tumors (OT). To elucidate the potential 
causal relationship, we conducted a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian 
randomization (MR) study.
METHOD: All the data were from European populations and obtained from the 
Genome-Wide Association Study, the FinnGen study, and the Ovarian Cancer 
Association Consortium. We used inverse variance weighting (IVW) as the primary 
method, supplemented by other five methods to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 
95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) and checked for pleiotropy. Cochran's Q was 
used to detect heterogeneity.
RESULTS: The IVW method supported TL as a risk factor for malignant (OR = 1.273, 
95 % CI = 1.012-1.602) and benign ovarian tumors (BOTs) (OR = 1.337, 95 % 
CI = 1.093-1.637). Besides, ovarian cancer subtypes evaluated the strong causal 
relationship between TL and low malignant potential serous ovarian cancer 
(LMSOC) by applying the IVW method after Bonferroni correction. There was 
suggestive evidence for low malignant potential mucinous ovarian cancer, 
invasive mucinous ovarian cancer, and low-grade serous ovarian cancer. No causal 
relationships were found for other ovarian cancer subtypes.
CONCLUSION: Our MR study provides strong genetic evidence that longer telomere 
length increases risk of specific ovarian tumor subtypes-most robustly for 
benign ovarian tumors (BOTs) and low malignant potential serous ovarian cancer 
(LMSOC). For other subtypes, observed associations were suggestive but 
inconclusive after multiplicity correction, highlighting the etiological 
heterogeneity of ovarian tumors To optimize treatment regimens and preventive 
measures for OT, we will continue to thoroughly investigate the potential 
mechanism of action of these associations in future studies.

Ovarian high-grade serous cancer (HGSC) is the most aggressive ovarian cancer 
subtype with limited treatment options. We identify the PDPK1 inhibitor BX-912 
as a promising candidate, showing strong single-agent activity and synergy with 
the PARP inhibitor olaparib, independent of BRCA status. Unexpectedly, BX-912 
induces multinucleation, a phenotype not seen with other PDPK1 inhibitors. 
Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration (PISA) assay reveals HES1 as a 
functional off-target, while structural modeling suggested BX-912 acts as a 
protein-protein interaction modulator, driving nuclear accumulation of HES1 
complexes and hence inducing mitotic catastrophe. Cell-cycle analyses confirm 
enhanced DNA damage response and G2/M arrest when combined with olaparib. These 
findings uncover a novel mechanism for BX-912, establish HES1 inhibition as a 
therapeutic strategy in HGSC, demonstrate proteomics' power to reveal hidden 
drug activities, and propose sequential cell-cycle targeting to improve 
treatment efficacy.

INTRODUCTION: The ""obesity paradox"" suggests that patients with various cancers, 
including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2 may 
experience improved survival. However, the influence of glycemic control on this 
association remains unclear. This study evaluates whether elevated hemoglobin 
A1c (HbA1c) modifies the survival benefit associated with the obesity paradox in 
patients undergoing nephrectomy for non-metastatic RCC.
METHODS: Patients undergoing nephrectomy for non-metastatic RCC at a single 
academic center from 2005 to 2024 were screened for inclusion. Inclusion 
criteria included HbA1c measured within 3 months preoperatively and ≥ 6 months 
of follow-up. Obesity was defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²; elevated HbA1c as ≥ 7%. 
Overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were assessed using Cox 
proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: 770 patients met inclusion criteria. Median follow-up was 45.2 months; 
172 (22%) mortality events occurred. Among patients with HbA1c < 7%, patients 
with obesity demonstrated improved CSS (HR 0.21 [95% CI, 0.09-0.48], P < .001) 
compared to non-obese counterparts after controlling for confounders. In 
patients with HbA1c ≥ 7%, no significant survival advantage in CSS was seen with 
obesity (HR 0.69 [95% CI, 0.16-3.03], P = .627). In patients with obesity, HbA1c 
≥ 7% independently predicted worse OS (HR 2.36 [95% CI, 1.40-3.98], P < .001).
CONCLUSION: The survival benefit from the obesity paradox in RCC patients 
appears limited to patients with well-controlled HbA1c. Elevated HbA1c may 
negate this effect, suggesting optimization of metabolic health and glycemic 
control may improve outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Vulvar cancer is a rare gynecologic cancer with limited guideline 
consensus, particularly for locally advanced disease. This study aimed to 
explore prognostic factors and optimize treatment strategies for vulvar cancer.
METHODS: We performed a multicenter, cross-ethnic retrospective study including 
pathologically confirmed vulvar cancer cases from the Chinese multicenter 
registry (2003-2023) and the SEER database(2004-2021). Patients younger than 20 
or lost to follow-up were excluded. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare 
survival, and prognostic factors were assessed using multivariate Cox 
regression. Baseline characteristics were balanced using inverse probability of 
treatment weighting (IPTW). Overall survival (OS) was the primary endpoint.
RESULTS: A total of 19,682 patients were analyzed (604 Chinese, 19,078 SEER). 
Surgery was independently associated with improved OS in both cohorts (Chinese: 
HR = 0.46, 95 %CI: 0.33-0.64; SEER: HR = 0.43, 95 %CI: 0.41-0.46; both 
p < 0.001). Among patients with locally advanced disease, surgery remained 
protective (Chinese: HR = 0.43, 95 %CI: 0.27-0.69; SEER: HR = 0.52, 95 %CI: 
0.47-0.57; both p < 0.001), and this effect persisted after IPTW adjustment 
(Chinese: HR = 0.38; SEER: HR = 0.50; both p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our large multicenter analysis demonstrated that surgery 
significantly improves survival in vulvar cancer, including locally advanced 
cases, providing important evidence for treatment optimization.

Cervical cancer is a malignant gynecological tumor, and cancer cell metastasis 
remains poorly controlled despite surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. 
Traditional Chinese medicine, with advantages of multi-target effects and low 
toxicity, has emerged as an important therapeutic approach. In this study, we 
screened Amygdalin-related targets and cervical cancer differentially expressed 
genes using databases (SwissTargetPrediction, TCGA). Key modules were identified 
via WGCNA, and core targets (CA9 and HK2) were determined through PPI network 
analysis and the MCODE algorithm. Single-cell RNA sequencing further localized 
Amygdalin-affected cell populations. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics 
simulations verified the binding affinity of Amygdalin to CA9 and HK2, which 
were further confirmed by enzymatic activity assays. These key targets were 
upregulated in cervical cancer tissues, significantly correlated with patient 
survival, and exhibited good diagnostic value (ROC curve AUC > 0.9). Cell 
experiments have shown that Amygdalin inhibits the proliferation of cervical 
cancer HeLa and SiHa cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and induces 
cell apoptosis. Amygdalin-treated HeLa cells were arrested at the G1 phase, 
while Amygdalin-treated SiHa cells were arrested at the G2 phase. Finally, 
RNA-seq transcriptomics analysis elucidated the pathway regulation mechanisms. 
Collectively, this study systematically confirms that Amygdalin exerts 
significant anti-cervical cancer effects by targeting CA9 and HK2 to regulate 
multiple pathways, providing an experimental and theoretical basis for its 
development as a candidate drug for cervical cancer treatment.

AIM: Evaluation of a breast cancer (BC) screening programme is necessary to 
ensure its quality. Performance measurements might be prioritized considering 
the association with outcomes related to BC mortality. We piloted an approach to 
explore the association of selected performance measurements with 
incidence-based BC mortality (IBM).
METHODS: We performed an ecological analysis of aggregated data from regional or 
national population-based cancer registries and BC screening programmes in 
Europe, using 13 performance indicators. We built a panel data (longitudinal 
cross-sectional) regression model to estimate the association between screening 
performance measurements and IBM rates.
RESULTS: We included data of 9 programmes and registries from Italy, Spain, 
Norway, Ireland and the Czech Republic. The number of screening years included 
in the dataset ranged from 5 to 20 years. In adjusted panel analyses, higher 
screening coverage, breast cancer detection rates (BCDR prevalent and subsequent 
rounds), node-negative proportion, and episode sensitivity were associated with 
lower incidence-based mortality (IBM), whereas a higher interval cancer rate was 
associated with higher IBM. The association for recall rate in subsequent 
examinations was small and imprecise.
CONCLUSION: Our pilot approach suggests association of several performance 
indicators with IBM. These indicators were related to the implementation of the 
screening programme (screening coverage), sensitivity (BC detection rate), and 
efficiency (recall rate). Further studies with larger datasets and individual 
data may confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND: Histone N-terminal tails undergo diverse post-translational 
modifications, including methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, 
ubiquitination, and ADP-ribosylation. Collectively, these modifications form a 
complex ""histone code"" that governs chromatin architecture and regulates 
DNA-related processes such as transcription, replication, and repair. Aberrant 
histone modification patterns are increasingly recognized as key contributors to 
the pathogenesis of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular 
diseases.
PURPOSE: This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current 
evidence on the regulatory effects of dietary polyphenols on histone 
modifications and to evaluate their potential as natural epigenetic modulators 
for disease prevention and therapy.
METHODS: Relevant literature from recent molecular, cellular, and animal studies 
was systematically analyzed to identify polyphenolic compounds that influence 
histone-modifying enzymes and associated signaling pathways. Fourteen 
representative polyphenols were included, comprising flavonoids 
(epigallocatechin gallate, anthocyanins, quercetin, luteolin, apigenin, 
genistein, and fisetin), stilbenes (resveratrol and pterostilbene), phenolic 
acids (gallic acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid), tannins (tannic acid), and 
curcumin.
RESULTS: Accumulating evidence demonstrates that these polyphenols act on one or 
more histone-modifying enzymes, particularly as histone deacetylase inhibitors, 
thereby modulating histone acetylation and methylation states. Such epigenetic 
modulation influences key gene expression pathways involved in inflammation, 
oxidative stress, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. Structural 
characteristics of polyphenols, including the number and position of hydroxyl 
groups and conjugation patterns, appear to determine their specificity and 
potency toward histone-modifying targets.
CONCLUSION: Dietary polyphenols represent promising, safe, and natural 
epigenetic agents capable of modulating histone modification dynamics. 
Elucidating the structure-activity relationships and molecular mechanisms 
underlying their interactions with histone-modifying enzymes will facilitate the 
development of polyphenol-based strategies for the prevention and treatment of 
human diseases.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most lethal form of cancer and 
the third most prevalent malignancy worldwide. Surgery, chemotherapy, and 
targeted therapy have been extensively utilized in the treatment of CRC. 
However, some patients still develop resistance to these treatments. Ferroptosis 
is a recently discovered form of cell death that is distinct from more familiar 
nonapoptotic processes. Iron-dependent nonapoptotic cell death is characterised 
by the accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species. It has been hypothesized 
that this process may contribute to the reversal of resistance to anticancer 
drugs. Pteris wallichiana is widely used medicinal resource, however, research 
on this topic is severely limited. Here we elucidate the chemopreventive effect 
and sensitize cisplatin-resistant CRC cells of Pteris wallichiana bioactives in 
extracts (PW-EA) and sensitize cisplatin-resistance CRC cells.
METHODS: CRC mouse models were established by treatment with azoxymethane plus 
dextran sulfate sodium or SW480 and HCT116 BALB/c xenografts. These cells were 
treated with PW-EA (10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) and compared to untreated controls. 
RNA-seq analyses were used to determine the mode of action. Ferroptosis and 
mitochondrial function were determined by using flow cytometry and transmission 
electron microscopy. Sensitization to cisplatin was analysed in drug-resistant 
cells and patient-derived organoid (PDO) models. Pharmacochemical parameters and 
distribution were assessed using serum pharmacochemistry and liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: PW-EA inhibited colorectal tumorigenesis in all CRC mouse models in a 
dose-dependent manner. Transcriptomic profiling and western blotting revealed 
that PW-EA inhibited SLC7A11 and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which suppress 
ferroptosis. PW-EA inhibited the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) 
and resulted in increased lipid peroxidation. PW-EA significantly increased the 
sensitivity to cisplatin in drug resistant cell lines (SW480-cisplatin-R and 
HCT116- cisplatin-R) and PDO models to cisplatin. PW-EA exhibited likely low 
cytotoxicity and dose-proportional systemic exposure in mice. The PW-EA 
metabolites pterosin D glycoside and acetylpterosin C exhibited high oral 
bioavailability (74.2 % and 71.9 %, respectively).
CONCLUSION: PW-EA manipulated ferroptosis via the SLC7A11-GSH-GPX4 axis to 
directly suppress CRC tumour cells and improve the efficacy of cisplatin 
chemotherapy in resistant lines. Pterosin D glycoside and acetylpterosin C were 
considered two of its active components. These findings provide novel 
perspectives and a scientific foundation for developing natural product-derived 
lead compounds in the treatment of colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: Interventions for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia are often limited 
by their adverse effects and significant costs.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Shengbai Oral Solution (SBOS) in 
reducing neutropenia and alleviating the moderate-to-severe symptom burden in 
patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing platinum-based 
chemotherapy.
STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial.
METHODS: This study included 215 patients with NSCLC from 17 hospitals in China. 
Eligible patients scheduled for platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly 
assigned to receive SBOS with chemotherapy (CT+SBOS group) or chemotherapy alone 
(CT alone group). Primary outcomes included the incidence of neutropenia during 
chemotherapy. Secondary outcomes included the patient-reported symptom burden, 
use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and adverse events (AEs) 
per CTCAE v4.0.
RESULTS: The CT+SBOS group had a significantly lower incidence of neutropenia 
over the 42-day trial (estimated effect: -0.048, 95 % CI [-0.078, -0.018], p = 
0.002) and required fewer G-CSF treatments. The incidence of moderate-to-severe 
scores on any of the top five symptoms (fatigue, pain, cough, disturbed sleep, 
and shortness of breath) significantly decreased over time in the CT+SBOS group 
(estimated effect: -0.025, 95 % CI [-0.044, -0.007], p = 0.007). Fewer patients 
in the CT+SBOS group used analgesics for pain (6.25 % vs. 16.50 %, p = 0.017). 
No significant differences in AEs were observed (p = 0.631).
CONCLUSION: SBOS, in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, demonstrated 
safety and significantly reduced the incidence of neutropenia. Furthermore, it 
reduced moderate-to-severe symptoms during chemotherapy. Therefore, SBOS could 
be an effective option for neutropenia and reducing symptom burden in patients 
with NSCLC undergoing chemotherapy.

Since the discovery of the first nanoparticles, scientists have developed 
controlled-release drugs, in which nanoparticles play a crucial role as drug 
carriers. Nanoparticles enable targeted and controlled release, but also face 
some challenges in their application, production and storage in vivo. The most 
used nanoparticles for drug encapsulation are liposomes. Liposomes consist of a 
lipid bilayer membrane that separates the inner hydrophilic/aqueous core from 
the surrounding environment. In the process known as encapsulation, an active 
ingredient is added that is either hydrophobic or hydrophilic. Their production 
is a challenge. Therefore, various production methods have been developed (thin 
film hydration, reverse phase evaporation, microfluidic methods, etc.) to 
achieve high encapsulation efficiency, stability and improved drug delivery in 
vivo. In medical treatment, liposomes are already used as carriers for 
analgesics, drugs to prevent and treat a variety of diseases (fungal, bacterial, 
and viral infections) and chemotherapeutics to treat various types of cancer 
(docetaxel, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, etc.). This article gives an insight into 
the methods of liposome production, ranging from conventional to more modern 
techniques with their advantages and disadvantages of the encapsulated 
substances and their use in medicine.

Emerging evidence suggests that adipose tissue is not just a fat depot but a 
metabolically active organ that plays a central role in connecting obesity with 
its comorbidities. Understanding the complex interactions between adipocytes and 
neighboring cell types in obesity requires models that accurately replicate 
adipocyte behavior within their natural environment. Three-dimensional (3D) 
adipocyte cultures mimic the native tissue microenvironment by incorporating the 
spatial architecture as well as cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) 
interactions present in vivo, offering improved platforms for 
(patho)physiological adipose tissue modeling. 3D models of adipose tissue 
dysfunction enable the study of complex cellular crosstalk, such as adipocyte 
cancer cell interactions in breast, colorectal, bone, and pancreatic cancers; 
epicardial and pericardial adipocyte-myocardial cell dynamics in obesity-related 
cardiac dysfunction; and adipocyte-hepatocyte interactions in the development of 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, among other critical pathophysiological 
processes. In this review, we first discuss 3D models of adipose tissue and 
current strategies for mimicking the obesogenic microenvironment, including 
dietary stimulation of hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia, as well as the 
incorporation of oxygen gradients, proinflammatory cytokines, and immune cells. 
Secondly, we examine 3D co-culture platforms that incorporate 
disease-associated/dysfunctional adipocytes with various cell types, such as 
cancer cells, cardiac cells, hepatocytes, immune cells, endothelial cells, and 
fibroblasts, to model intercellular and interorgan crosstalk in obesity. Lastly, 
we provide insights into enhancing the physiological relevance of dysfunctional 
adipose tissue models and their co-culture systems while discussing future 
directions in tissue engineering aimed at improving clinical translation and 
reducing obesity related complications and mortality.

Extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (eCCA) is a highly malignant tumor with a 
propensity for metastasis, reflected in its estimated 5-year survival rate of 
11%. Metastasis greatly impairs the effectiveness of cancer therapies and 
increases cancer-related deaths. Therefore, gaining an understanding of the 
complex metastatic process is essential for development of effective treatments. 
Metastasis progression involves remodeling of the tumor microenvironment (TME) 
and the formation of pre-metastatic niches (PMNs), facilitating the migration 
and survival of tumor cells from the primary site to distant locations. As the 
eCCA progresses, immune cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the TME are 
gradually converted to a tumor-supportive phenotype, coordinating tumor 
metastasis through intercellular interactions. Recent studies have confirmed 
that bile, a body fluid in close contact with eCCA, is also involved in the 
formation of supportive TME and tumor metastasis. On the other hand, primary 
tumors construct PMNs conducive to cancer cell colonization in distant organs 
prior to metastatic tumor formation through paracrine effects. This review aimed 
to summarize the mechanisms by which TME and PMNs drive eCCA metastasis, current 
treatment strategies for metastatic eCCA, and prospects for future research.

College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.

BACKGROUND: Dysregulated immune system could become a vital trigger for gastric 
carcinogenesis.
METHODS: Literature retrieval was performed based on PubMed, Web of Science, and 
Embase from inception to January 2025. Cohort studies investigating risk ratio 
or incidence of gastric cancer among patients with autoimmune disorders were 
eligible. Relative risk was primary endpoint (risk ratio with 95% confidence 
interval), while incidence was secondary endpoint.
RESULTS: 285 studies were included, containing 61 556 078 participants. Overall 
pooled risk ratio was 1.158 (95%CI 1.098-1.222, p<0.001). Patients with 
autoimmune gastritis (3.066, p<0.001), systemic sclerosis (1.788, p = 0.010), 
type 1 diabetes (1.411, p<0.001), sarcoidosis (1.388, p = 0.004) and psoriasis 
(1.194, p = 0.001) were strongly associated with higher risk of gastric cancer. 
Meanwhile, patients with dermatomyositis (2.100, p = 0.034) and systemic lupus 
erythematosus (1.296, p = 0.038) were also associated with increased risk of 
gastric cancer, despite of smaller effect sizes and higher p values. Subgroup 
analyses based on sex and geographical regions were also conducted.
CONCLUSION: Autoimmune diseases were associated with increased gastric cancer 
risk, especially autoimmune gastritis, systemic sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, 
sarcoidosis and psoriasis. Patients with dermatomyositis and systemic lupus 
erythematosus were potentially associated with elevated risk of gastric cancer. 
Surprisingly, ulcerative colitis had protective effect against gastric cancer, 
especially among East Asian countries. Regarding sex analysis, male and female 
patients were similarly susceptible to autoimmunity-induced gastric 
carcinogenesis. As for geographical differences, patients with autoimmune 
diseases from Nordic countries were most likely to have increased risk of 
gastric cancer, while autoimmune diseases seemed to have protective effects 
against gastric cancer among Japanese patients, especially those with rheumatoid 
arthritis.

BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant treatment has demonstrated clinical benefits in advanced 
gallbladder cancer (GBC). However, the overall response rate remains suboptimal, 
and the underlying mechanisms driving treatment efficacy are not fully 
understood.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of 
neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy (NAT) combining gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, and 
anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in advanced GBC, and to investigate the associated tumor 
microenvironment (TME) alterations. Single-cell RNA sequencing and multiplex 
immunohistochemistry were utilized to analyze the cellular composition of the 
TME in patients who successfully underwent downstaging.
RESULTS: NAT significantly reshaped the tumor-immune landscape, characterized by 
an expansion of follicular helper T (Tfh) cells and the formation of tertiary 
lymphoid structures (TLSs) in 50% of treated tumors. Inflammatory 
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) increased and exhibited upregulation of 
CCL19 and CXCL12, potentially promoting Tfh cell recruitment and TLS formation. 
Additionally, NAT led to an expansion of GZMB+ cytotoxic CD8+ T cells with an 
exhausted phenotype in GBC, but not in adjacent normal tissues. The treatment 
also increased the number and effector functions of natural killer cells while 
reducing tumor-promoting macrophages and angiogenesis-related CAFs. Furthermore, 
NAT decreased the cancer stem cell-like subpopulation while increasing a cancer 
cell subset with enhanced antigen-presenting capacity.
CONCLUSION: This study suggested the potential efficacy of NAT in advanced GBC 
and revealed alterations in the TME following treatment. The findings provided 
insights into the mechanisms underlying NAT responses and offered valuable 
directions for optimizing therapeutic strategies in GBC.

BACKGROUND: The accurate identification of the primary origin of malignant 
vertebral compression fractures and vertebral metastatic cancer (VMC) is 
critical for effective treatment, but current diagnostic approaches are invasive 
and lack specificity. We developed an explainable MRI-based radiomics model for 
tracing VMC origins noninvasively.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This multicenter study included 1,123 patients with 
vertebral compression fractures from five hospitals with confirmed diagnoses; 
data from 754 patients in three centers were divided into training and 
validation cohorts based on the date of MRI examination. Two independent 
external test cohorts were used to evaluate the generalizability of the model. 
Sagittal T1 weighted images, T2 weighted images, and fat-suppression T2-weighted 
images were used for manual 3D lesion segmentation. In total, 3135 radiomic 
features were extracted from each region of interest. Feature selection was 
performed using the minimal redundancy maximal relevance algorithm. The final 
prediction model was established using a support vector machine algorithm.
RESULTS: The radiomics model achieved areas under the receiver operating 
characteristic curves of 0.99, 0.87, and 0.88 in the validation, and two 
external test datasets, respectively, for VMC detection. For primary origin 
prediction, the model demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy across all datasets 
for lung, breast, and prostate origins. DeLong's test indicated a strong 
generalization capability of the model. SHAP analysis identified wavelet as key 
contributors to model transparency.
CONCLUSION: Our model was capable of distinguishing VMC from benign lesions and 
accurately predicting its primary origin. It demonstrated high generalizability 
and interpretability and represents a promising non-invasive tool to support 
clinical decision-making and reduce invasive biopsies.

Liver cancer is a type of malignant tumor with extremely high incidence and 
mortality rates. For a long time, accurately distinguishing the boundary of 
liver tumors and achieving accurate resection of liver cancer tissue has been 
one of the urgent needs of clinical treatment of liver cancer. Fluorescent 
probes have the advantages of non-invasive, high sensitivity, real-time spatial 
resolution, etc., and have been widely studied in guiding liver cancer surgical 
navigation, photothermal therapy and photodynamic therapy. At present, ICG 
belongs to zone I fluorescence, which is widely used in clinic. The shortcomings 
are shallow penetration depth, non-targeting, easy dispersion and so on. NIR-II 
region has many advantages, such as high spatial resolution, deep penetration, 
low light absorption and scattering of biological substrates, and minimal 
fluorescence of tissue itself. In this review, we present the latest advances in 
the study of fluorescent probes for NIR-II liver cancer and discuss the 
challenges facing the study of fluorescent probes for NIR-II liver cancer.

BACKGROUND: Circadian rhythms govern a wide range of physiological processes 
essential for cellular homeostasis, such as cell cycle progression, DNA repair, 
metabolism, and apoptosis. Disruptions to these rhythms are linked to cancer 
initiation, progression, and therapy response. While the role of circadian genes 
in cancer cells has been well-documented, their impact on the tumor 
microenvironment (TME), particularly in endothelial cells, remains 
underexplored. This study investigates the dysregulation of circadian 
rhythm-related genes in endothelial cells across multiple cancers and their 
clinical significance.
METHODS: We conducted a pan-cancer analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing 
data from the Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub database. A total of 15 independent 
datasets were analyzed, involving rigorous data processing steps, such as 
filtering, quality control, and cell type identification. Circadian rhythm 
activity was quantified using circadian rhythm scores, and genes with elevated 
expression in endothelial cells were identified. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) datasets were employed for prognostic 
analysis. A risk model based on circadian rhythm-related genes was developed 
using LASSO regression, with validation across multiple independent cohorts.
RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that endothelial cells exhibited consistently 
high circadian rhythm scores, highlighting their crucial role in regulating 
circadian rhythms within the TME. We identified a gene signature, 
ENDO.CIRCADIAN.RHYTHM.SIG, consisting of 101 genes positively correlated with 
endothelial cell-specific circadian rhythms. Dysregulation of these genes was 
prevalent across various cancer types and correlated with poor prognosis, with 
specific genes like ITGA5, SLC2A3, and SERPINE1 identified as potential risk 
factors. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that higher expression of 
these genes was associated with decreased overall survival. The correlation of 
ENDO.CIRCADIAN.RHYTHM.SIG expression with immune infiltration and stromal 
components suggested that endothelial circadian rhythms modulate key aspects of 
the TME. Notably, the circadian rhythm gene set was significantly associated 
with angiogenesis and inflammatory pathways, especially in liver hepatocellular 
carcinoma (LIHC). A prognostic risk model for breast cancer (BRCA) based on 
these genes showed robust predictive performance.
CONCLUSION: Endothelial circadian rhythm genes play a significant role in 
regulating tumor progression, immune interactions, and patient prognosis. 
Dysregulation of the ENDO.CIRCADIAN.RHYTHM.SIG gene set correlates with adverse 
clinical outcomes and may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and 
therapeutic target. Our findings suggest that targeting circadian rhythm 
pathways within the TME could enhance personalized cancer treatment strategies.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most common cancer worldwide and is 
the second leading cause of cancer-related fatalities. The treatment and 
prognosis of CRC have drawn increasing attention. Currently, the main treatment 
modality is comprehensive therapy, with surgical treatment as the primary 
approach supplemented by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, for patients 
with metastatic and advanced CRC, how to improve their prognosis and quality of 
life remains a challenging research topic. Vitamin D, an essential fat-soluble 
vitamin in the human body, possesses functions that go beyond simply regulating 
calcium and phosphorus metabolism. A growing body of evidence has validated a 
significant correlation between CRC and vitamin D. This article systematically 
elaborates on the physiological functions, sources, metabolic pathways of 
vitamin D, the influencing factors of its content in the body, and 
comprehensively reviews the relationship between vitamin D and CRC as well as 
their clinical research applications from aspects including the 
cancer-inhibiting mechanism of vitamin D, the reactivity of CRC patients with 
different genotypes to vitamin D, the differences in vitamin D content in 
patients with tumors at different anatomical sites, and the regulation of 
intestinal flora balance mediated by vitamin D. The aim is to provide references 
for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer in the future.

OBJECTIVE: Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are associated with 
significant pain and disability. The current standard of care is expectant 
medical management; however, there is emerging data encouraging the use of early 
kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty. The goal of this nationwide study was to 
investigate the outcomes of patients with acute thoracolumbar VCF who undergo 
very early (inpatient) kyphoplasty compared with those managed medically.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of the Nationwide Readmissions 
Database from 2016 to 2022. Adult patients admitted nonelectively for 
thoracolumbar wedge compression fractures were included. Patients were excluded 
if they had cancer, additional fractures, cord compression, or if they underwent 
surgery. Those who underwent kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty were 1:1 propensity 
score matched with those who were managed medically, and Poisson or logistic 
regression analyses were performed for outcomes. The primary endpoint was 
discharge to home. Other outcomes included in-hospital death, hospital length of 
stay (LOS), cost, and major morbidity or mortality after discharge at 180 days.
RESULTS: A total of 69,722 patients were included in the study, of whom 53,142 
(76.2%) underwent medical management while 16,580 (23.8%) underwent kyphoplasty 
or vertebroplasty. After propensity score matching, patients who underwent 
kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty experienced a significantly higher rate of discharge 
to home (54.3%) compared with medically managed patients (46.2%) (OR 1.38, 95% 
CI 1.28-1.50; p < 0.001). Compared with medical management, patients who 
underwent kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty had significantly lower in-hospital death 
(0.4% vs 0.9%; OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.32-0.74; p < 0.001) but a slightly longer 
hospital LOS (median 5 vs 4 days; B = 1.23, 95% CI 1.07-1.38; p < 0.001) and 
higher cost (B = 8.9, 95% CI 8.4-9.3; p < 0.001). There was no significant 
difference in inpatient adverse events between the medical management and 
kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty groups (p > 0.05), and, among patients discharged 
home, inpatient kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty did not lead to differences in 
delayed morbidity or mortality within 180 days (p > 0.05). Subgroup analysis 
revealed that women may derive a greater benefit from kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty 
(OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.35-1.61; p < 0.001) than men (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05-1.35; p = 
0.009) (interaction p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty is associated with higher odds 
of home discharge and lower odds of mortality. These findings support the use of 
very early (inpatient) kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty for those with acute 
thoracolumbar compression fractures.

Aging is a critical yet understudied determinant in pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) risk and outcomes. Despite a strong epidemiological 
association with age, conventional PDAC preclinical models fail to capture the 
histopathological and stromal complexities that emerge in older organisms. Using 
an age-relevant syngeneic orthotopic model, we demonstrated that organismal 
aging accelerates PDAC progression and metastasis. Transcriptomic and secretome 
profiling identified a conserved extracellular matrix gene signature enriched in 
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from aged tumors, consistent with an 
augmented fibrotic landscape that supports immunosuppression, metastatic 
tropism, and poor prognosis. Direct testing of the functional impact of stromal 
aging in heterochronic co-implantation models revealed that revitalizing the 
aged tumor stroma with young CAFs restores immune infiltration and attenuates 
metastasis in older hosts. Conversely, aged CAFs, while immunosuppressive, 
failed to enhance metastasis in young hosts, suggesting that a youthful 
microenvironment exerts dominant regulatory control over disease progression. 
These findings demonstrate that stromal age is a critical modulator of both 
immune exclusion and metastatic behavior in PDAC. Importantly, this work 
establishes a conceptual framework for understanding how aging shapes the tumor 
microenvironment in PDAC and opens a fertile avenue of investigation into 
age-specific stromal regulation. Moreover, these findings raise compelling 
questions about the underlying molecular mechanisms and lay the foundation for 
future efforts to therapeutically target stromal aging in PDAC.

BACKGROUND: Older adults undergoing surgeries face increased risks of 
postoperative neurocognitive disorders, which impair cognitive functions. Analog 
neurocognitive tests are commonly used, but digital tests offer faster, more 
accessible assessments.
OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a 
digital cognitive test battery in older adults undergoing abdominal surgery. 
Feasibility included estimation of recruitment and retention rates, 
acceptability, perceived value, and usability of the test. The secondary aim was 
to explore outcome trajectories of cognition, depression, functional status, and 
quality of recovery.
METHODS: This nonrandomized feasibility study measured recruitment and retention 
rates using patient logs and expanded on these findings in semistructured 
interviews with nurses. Acceptability, perceived value, and usability were 
explored through interviews with patients and nurses, and the System Usability 
Scale (SUS). Cognitive functions were assessed with a digital cognitive test 
battery (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer Disease [CERAD] word 
list learning test, Trail Making Test Parts A and B, Victoria Stroop Test, and 
Symbol Digit Pairing Test) and the Nursing Delirium Screening scale (NU-DESC), 
and depression with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). Functional status 
was measured using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 
(WHODAS), and postoperative recovery with the Swedish Quality of Recovery 
questionnaire (SwQoR-24). Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive 
statistics and nonparametric tests and qualitative data with content analysis.
RESULTS: The test battery was feasible, acceptable, and demonstrated excellent 
usability. The mean SUS score was 87 (SD 17.9; 95% CI 78.9-95.2), and all 
predefined progression criteria were met. Recruitment spanned over 1.5 years, 
during which 24 patients were included (mean age of 77, SD 6.5 years; range: 
63-90 years; n=13, 54% women). Most patients underwent laparoscopic colorectal 
cancer surgery. Three patients developed postoperative delirium for 1 day only. 
No patient developed delayed neurocognitive recovery or mild/major 
neurocognitive disorder at the postoperative follow-up. Qualitative data showed 
that both nurses and patients regarded the digital cognitive test battery as 
important for assessing cognitive function and found it easy to use and 
understand. Nurses reported that recruitment was challenging, partly because not 
all patients attended a preoperative in-person consultation before surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: The digital, self-administered cognitive test battery was found to 
be feasible, acceptable, and usable in older adults undergoing abdominal 
surgery. However, recruitment challenges and a small, homogeneous sample limit 
generalizability and warrant careful consideration in a larger-scale study.

That the incorporation of N-methyl amino acids adjacent to a hydrolytic, 
azamacrocyclic metal complex results in rate-tunable, metal-mediated amide bond 
cleavage (TMAC) under physiological conditions. Spectroscopic and 
crystallographic data provide unprecedented mechanistic insight: the Ga3+ 
complex of (7-amido-1,4,7-triazonane-1,4-diyl)diacetic acid polarizes the amide 
bond proximal to canonical and noncanonical amino acids, forming two 
coordination isomers with different cleavage rates, N3O3 (fast) and N4O2 (slow) 
in aqueous solution. Both were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and identified 
by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Subsequent hydrolysis of the amide bond 
occurs by exogenous nucleophilic attack, as demonstrated by 18O-isotope labeling 
experiments and proceeds with a variable rate, depending on the nature of the 
amino acid side chain and amide-methylation status. The in vivo applicability of 
TMAC was subsequently demonstrated by pharmacokinetic modulation of a cancer 
targeted, 68Ga-labeled radiopharmaceutical. Specifically, 6 serum-albumin 
binding chelates, linked to a peptide targeting the prostate specific membrane 
antigen (PSMA) were constructed. Variable amino-acid-chelate linkers allow 
tuning of the rate of release and clearance of the radioactive isotope. Indeed, 
diagnostic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, metabolite and 
biodistribution analysis indicate that rate tunable cleavage and release of the 
68Ga-chelate minimize tracer accumulation in blood and liver compartments while 
maximizing tumor uptake. In contrast, a [68Ga]Ga-chelate incorporating a 
noncleavable glycine linker, exhibited elevated blood and liver uptake with 
moderate tumor localization. Taken together, TMAC provides remarkable control 
over the in vivo behavior of targeted pharmaceuticals.

PURPOSE: Men with prostate cancer face considerable cardiovascular (CV) 
comorbidity. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and androgen receptor pathway 
inhibitors (ARPIs) elevate this risk, yet no prostate-specific CV monitoring 
tools exist. Clinicians rely on general calculators such as the American Heart 
Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) score, which remain unvalidated in this setting. 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in the estimated CV risk of men 
with prostate cancer after 6 months of hormone therapy using clinical tools 
established for the general population.
METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of sixty-three men with localized 
high-risk prostate cancer treated with 6 months of preoperative ADT plus 
apalutamide with or without abiraterone on a trial (ClinicalTrials.gov 
identifier: NCT03279250). ASCVD risk and metabolic syndrome (MetS) Z scores were 
calculated at baseline and the end of treatment using AHA/ACC and MetS 
calculators.
RESULTS: After 6 months of ADT plus ARPI, the median ASCVD risk score increased 
modestly (+0.95), with 21% exhibiting a clinically significant increase (≥2.5%). 
This was primarily driven by increases in total cholesterol (median, 182-211) 
and low-density lipoprotein (median, 101-122), whereas blood pressure did not 
have a clinically significant change. Five patients experienced a major adverse 
CV event, yet only one had a clinically significant increase in ASCVD risk 
score. Only 28% of patients experienced an increase in MetS risk.
CONCLUSION: After 6 months of ADT plus ARPI, men with prostate cancer showed 
worsening lipid profiles and 21% had worsening of their CV risk based on general 
population tools. These findings highlight the unmet need to develop prostate 
cancer-specific CV risk assessment tools.

Center, New York City, NY.

PURPOSE: Multiple checkpoint inhibitors are approved for cancer treatment in the 
United States, accounting for nearly 20% of Medicare Part B spending. To explore 
why prices remain high, this study analyzed pricing trends for checkpoint 
inhibitors from 2015 to 2024 and the degree of overlap of their US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)-approved indications.
METHODS: For 11 FDA-approved checkpoint inhibitors, we studied quarterly average 
sales prices from public Medicare spending files from Q3 2015 to Q1 2024; prices 
were standardized to cost per 28-day treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. 
We compared the FDA-labeled indications as of January 2024 to determine the 
degree of overlap, defining indications on the basis of tumor type (or mutation 
status) and stage of treatment.
RESULTS: Monthly prices for checkpoint inhibitors decreased slightly over the 
study period, largely attributable to high inflation from 2020 to 2023. Five 
drugs, including pembrolizumab and nivolumab, maintained prices within 7% of 
each other; five other drugs were introduced at prices 3%-20% lower than the 
existing checkpoint inhibitors. In Q1 2024, monthly prices ranged from $7,783 in 
US dollars (USD) (ipilimumab) to $14,872 USD (dostarlimab). We identified 55 
distinct indications for the 11 drugs; of these, 24 (44%) were approved for only 
one drug and 16 (29%) for only two drugs. Pembrolizumab accounted for 45 of 55 
(82%) total indications and 18 of 24 (75%) nonoverlapping indications. Of eight 
checkpoint inhibitors launched since 2015, three were initially approved for 
nonoverlapping uses.
CONCLUSION: Prices of checkpoint inhibitors have decreased only slightly since 
introduction. This may be partially explained by lack of overlapping 
indications, which hinders direct competition among within-class drugs. 
Expanding drug price negotiations or incentivizing comparative effectiveness 
research may help to promote competition and address high prices.

PURPOSE: We developed and validated a dual-purpose, open-access Rural-Urban 
Commuting Area (RUCA) tool to standardize geographic coding for cancer 
disparities research, addressing National Institutes of Health (NIH) Helping to 
End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) Initiative Common Data Element requirements while 
supporting institutional catchment area analyses.
METHODS: This web-based tool16 integrates US Department of Agriculture RUCA 
codes with census tract data and electronic health record systems, meeting NIH 
HEAL Initiative Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data 
ecosystem requirements. We implemented the tool using Wake Forest Cancer 
Center's 2023 registry data (n = 21,219) and conducted systematic comparison 
with county-level Rural-Urban Continuum Code (RUCC) classifications using 18,714 
cancer cases across 336 ZIP codes, focusing on breast, colon, and lung cancers 
to demonstrate enhanced geographic granularity.
RESULTS: Among 21,219 patients with cancer, 19.51% (n = 4,140) resided in rural 
areas, with 4.81% (n = 1,022) in the most rural census tracts (RUCA codes 7-10). 
Comparative analysis revealed 9.4% disagreement between RUCA and RUCC 
classifications, affecting 1,765 patients. Twenty-eight ZIP codes classified as 
rural by RUCA were located within metropolitan counties according to RUCC, 
encompassing 109 patients with cancer who would be misclassified using 
county-level measures. As a separate use case, integration with NIH HEAL 
Initiative standardized rurality data collection across 15 research studies.
CONCLUSION: The RUCA tool addresses critical gaps in geographic data 
standardization by providing census tract-level precision that county-level 
classifications miss. This dual-application framework aligns institutional 
catchment analyses with national standardization efforts, identifying 109 
patients with cancer who would be misclassified as urban residents using 
traditional county-level approaches, thereby enhancing targeted interventions 
for rural cancer care access.

BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) predominantly affects older adults, whose 
treatment outcomes may be influenced by baseline health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL). This study aimed to identify predictors of poor preoperative HRQoL in 
older patients undergoing CRC surgery and to stratify them into risk 
groups.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed data on patients aged ≥65 years who 
underwent radical CRC surgery at a single medical center in Taiwan (2016-2018). 
Preoperative HRQoL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-ELD14 questionnaire and a 
comprehensive geriatric assessment. Patients were stratified into high or low 
HRQoL groups based on the median QLQ-ELD14 sum score. Logistic regression 
identified independent predictors of poor HRQoL, and recursive partitioning 
analysis (RPA) was applied for risk stratification.ResultsAmong the 179 
patients, the most distressing HRQoL domains were Burden of Disease, Maintaining 
Purpose, and Worries about Others. Independent predictors of poor HRQoL included 
female sex (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.41, P = 0.029), frailty (adjusted OR = 
1.53, P = 0.042), poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance 
status (adjusted OR = 2.19, P = 0.008), and lower educational attainment 
(adjusted OR = 0.23, P = 0.019). RPA identified five patient subgroups with 
distinct risk levels; frail female had the highest risk (71.4%), while fit 
patients with college education or higher had the lowest 
(9.5%).ConclusionFrailty, functional status, sex, and education level are key 
determinants of preoperative HRQoL in older patients with CRC. The RPA provides 
a simple tool to identify high-risk patients, allowing targeted preoperative 
interventions to optimize care and enhance surgical outcomes.

Despite intensive, multimodal therapy, only half of children diagnosed with 
high-risk neuroblastoma will survive five years, and survivors harbor 
significant short- and long-term treatment-related co-morbidities. Although 
monoclonal antibody therapy targeting GD2 has improved outcomes, GD2-directed 
immunotherapy remains one of the only FDA-approved immunotherapies for pediatric 
cancer, and therapy is toxic due to GD2 expression on pain fibers. Thus, there 
is a critical need to uncover new immunotherapy targets in neuroblastoma. ALCAM 
is a cell adhesion molecule that promotes tumor growth in a variety of cancers 
and is highly expressed in neuroblastoma. We generated three inducible CRISPRi 
cell lines to deplete ALCAM and elucidate its role in neuroblastoma. Depletion 
of ALCAM reduced cell growth, reduced Ki-67 staining, and increased cleaved 
PARP. To determine the mechanism of ALCAM overexpression, we used 
ChIP-sequencing to show MYCN oncoprotein binding at the ALCAM promoter. We 
generated luciferase reporters from the ALCAM promoter and a putative upstream 
(10kb) enhancer, which we defined using Promoter-based Capture-C. Treatment with 
the MYC(N)/MAX dimerization inhibitor MYCi975 reduced ALCAM expression by 
immunoblotting and luciferase signal from the ALCAM promoter. We validated the 
activity of the upstream enhancer and uncovered an AP-1 binding motif that is 
critical for enhancer activity. Finally, as ALCAM is expressed in several normal 
tissues, we investigated an ALCAM-targeted conditionally activated antibody drug 
conjugate (ADC), CX-2009 (praluzatamab ravtansine), which delayed tumor growth 
in two out of three PDX models. Together, these findings credential ALCAM as an 
immunotherapeutic target in neuroblastoma.

Understanding therapy resistance requires deconvolving heterogeneous cell 
populations and tracking clonal trajectories. While CRISPR-based cellular 
barcoding is powerful for lineage tracing, many platforms suffer from low 
efficiency and limited compatibility with single-cell transcriptomics. We 
developed Oligo-CALL (Oligonucleotide-inducible CRISPR transcriptional 
activator-Assisted Lineage Labeling), an advanced barcoding system enabling 
precise lineage tracing, live clone isolation, and seamless integration with 
single-cell RNA sequencing. Applied to lung cancer cells treated with a KRASG12C 
inhibitor, Oligo-CALL identified clones consistently enriched posttreatment, 
supporting a model of predestined resistance. Oligo-CALL achieved >95% 
efficiency in linking lineage identity to transcriptomes, uncovering diverse 
clone-specific pathways with underlying resistance. Paired analysis of 
barcode-matched clones from naïve and resistant populations revealed transient 
and fixed resistance phenotypes. Notably, DNA repair pathways are recurrently 
altered in resistant clones, and inhibition of poly(adenosine 
5'-diphosphate-ribose) polymerase synergizes with KRAS G12C inhibition to 
overcome resistance. Together, Oligo-CALL provides a versatile platform for 
dissecting lineage evolution and molecular dynamics of targeted therapy 
resistance.

Radiotherapy (RT) is a commonly employed treatment in oncological setting. 
Unfortunately, the therapeutic dose required for tumor control often induces 
significant side effects in normal tissues, leading to suboptimal outcomes and 
reduced patient quality of life. FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) is distinguished 
by its exceptionally high dose rates, surpassing 40 Gy/s. This advancement has 
emerged as a promising innovation in the field of cancer treatment. Indeed, 
FLASH-RT may reduce normal tissue toxicity compared to conventional radiotherapy 
(CONV-RT) while maintaining tumor control. Here, FLASH-RT and CONV-RT have been 
compared in an alternative embryonic model of pancreatic carcinoma, a cancer 
type with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. The chorioallantoic 
membrane models (CAMs) have been employed to assess the tumor control and the 
treatment toxicity by analyzing the embryo survival. FLASH-RT exhibited 
significantly reduced off-target toxicity on the embryos, as evidenced by the 
embryonic growth analysis and histopathological analysis. The tumor control 
outcomes were comparable between FLASH-RT and CONV-RT, confirming the 
iso-efficacy between the two strategies. These findings confirm the 
paradigm-shifting potential of FLASH-RT to enhance the therapeutic ratio, 
particularly in anatomically complex and radioresistant tumors such as 
pancreatic carcinoma, warranting further investigation in clinical settings. 
Additionally, a solid embryonic in vivo model has been introduced for 
comprehensive investigations on emerging radio-treatment approaches. While 
further investigations are necessary to optimize dose delivery and evaluate

Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare, autosomal dominant, multisystem 
cancer syndrome. A variety of benign and malignant tumors can develop in VHL, 
including cranial and spinal hemangioblastomas, retinoblastoma, endolymphatic 
sac tumor, pheochromocytoma, renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic neuroendocrine 
tumors, and renal, pancreatic, and genital cysts. Here we present a 57-year-old 
woman who was diagnosed with VHL and, in the same 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, exhibits 
all these components of the syndrome: pheochromocytoma, pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumor, pancreatic cysts, renal cysts, liver hemangioma, and 
hemangioblastoma in the medulla oblongata.

PURPOSE: To assess the excess cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risk in 
patients with gastric cancer (GC) compared with the general population.
METHODS: Using data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, we conducted a retrospective, 
population-based cohort study of 41,083 GC patients ≥30 years old between 
January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2021. A reference cohort from the 
corresponding general population was also included. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) 
for CVD mortality were estimated using Poisson regression.
RESULTS: GC patients were associated with a higher risk of CVD mortality 
relative to the general population (IRR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.40-1.52). The relative 
risk was highest among younger patients aged 30-39 years (IRR: 7.69; 95% CI: 
2.48-23.86). Cardiovascular mortality risk peaked during the first month after 
cancer diagnosis (IRR: 11.52; 95% CI: 9.97-13.31). The relationship between GC 
and CVD mortality varied according to demographic and clinical characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: These population-based findings support early cardiac assessment 
and comprehensive risk stratification in GC care. Prospective studies with 
richer confounder data are needed to test whether these strategies improve 
outcomes.

First European Results of Shape-Sensing Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy.

Brock JM, Dittrich AS, Kontogianni K, Heussel CP, Klotz LV, Winter H, 
Schellenberg M, Keppler U, Herth F.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Shape-Sensing robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (ssRAB) 
was shown to be superior in diagnosing peripheral pulmonary nodules (PPN) 
compared to conventional bronchoscopy. Although RAB is established in the U.S. 
since 2019, no European data describing the use in health care systems are 
published yet.
METHODS: The first prospective European single-center study assessed the 
diagnosis of PPN with ssRAB, using the ION™ Endoluminal system. Patients with 
suspected lung cancer or metastasis, PPN of 1-3cm and ≥3 airway generations out, 
were included in this study and followed for up to 6 months. The primary outcome 
was rate of tool-in-lesion (TIL), confirmed by mobile cone-beam computed 
tomography (mCBCT) or with malignant index biopsy finding. Secondary outcomes 
included procedural characteristics, diagnostic yield, and adverse events.
RESULTS: A total of 43 patients with a mean nodule size of 19.2x16.9x15.8 mm, a 
mean distance of 17.4 ± 15.5 mm to the pleura, and mean 6.6th generation of 
airway was analyzed in this study. TIL was achieved in 90.7% of all cases. 
Strict diagnostic yield was 67.4% and sensitivity for malignancy was 78.6%. No 
pneumothorax, and no adverse events were reported outside of 3 cases of 
Nashville ≤2 bleeding. Predictors for successful diagnosis were inner or middle 
third location (OR 4.19, p=0.039), CT bronchus sign (OR 4, p=0.044), and 
distance from pleural wall (OR 1.05, p=0.048). Lower lobe location (OR: 0.06, 
p<.001) was associated with non-diagnostic cases.
CONCLUSION: The first European cases show ssRAB is a safe procedure with 
promising results for enabling diagnosis of PPN.

with cytoplasmic vacuoles: Association of autolysosome swelling with vacuole 
formation.

INTRODUCTION: We experienced a case of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) 
exhibiting mucus-negative cytoplasmic vacuoles. The carcinoma cells with 
vacuoles were positive for p63, a marker of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Since 
the first description by Cramer and Heggeness in 1989, 24 cases of SCC with 
mucus-negative vacuoles have been reported to date. However, little is known 
about the clinical course of SCC with vacuoles (SCCVs) and the nature of the 
cytoplasmic vacuoles themselves, due to its rarity and the lack of suitable 
models.
METHODS: We established a novel organoid line - designated ECO_Vac - from 
residual cancer tissue of a patient with esophageal SCCV (ESCCV) after 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), evaluated its applicability as a model of ESCCV, 
and characterized its cytoplasmic vacuoles by electron microscopic and 
organelle-specific fluorescent probe uptake assays.
RESULTS: ECO_Vac was successfully established and was found to be applicable to 
in vitro drug assays and experiments involving in vivo tumor formation. We also 
found that the vacuoles in ESCCV were enlarged autolysosomes.
CONCLUSION: We established a novel organoid line, ECO_Vac, as a useful model for 
investigating the molecular pathogenesis of ESCCV. By using ECO_Vac, we 
demonstrated that the cytoplasmic vacuoles in ESCCV were unphysiologically 
enlarged autolysosomes.

Clinical Impact of Genetic Alterations in Pediatric Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma: 
A Next-Generation Sequencing Study from Argentina.

Dujovne N, Gazek N, Vaiani E, Ramirez P, Perez Garrido N, Lopez Marti J, 
Ayarzabal V, Ciaccio M, Belgorosky A, Marino R, Herzovich V.

BACKGROUND: In children, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is generally sporadic 
and may, less frequently, be part of an undiagnosed hereditary tumor 
predisposition syndrome. Somatic molecular testing is useful to understand tumor 
etiology and behavior, predict prognosis, and possibly guide development of 
novel treatment strategies. The aims of our study were to analyze the findings 
of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel in a cohort of pediatric PTC from 
Argentina according to age at presentation, recurrence risk, and response to 
treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted of 63 
consecutive pediatric patients with PTC seen at a single center in whom a 
DNA-based NGS panel was performed. The patients were classified according to the 
ATA-2015 recurrence risk stratification into a low (n:10), an intermediate 
(n:13), and a high-risk group (n:40). All patients were treated with total 
thyroidectomy and radioiodine. At the last follow-up, patients were classified 
as excellent response (ER) or having persistent disease (PD).
RESULTS: In 70% (44/63) of the samples, a pathogenic somatic variant was 
detected, the most frequent alterations were RET fusions (20%). Fusions were 
more frequent in younger patients (median age 11.45 vs 13.7 years; p:0.048), in 
diffuse sclerosing subtype histology (p:0.01) and in high-recurrence risk group 
(p<0.014). The risk of PD was higher in patients in the high-risk group (odds 
ratio, 9.2). When evaluating treatment response based on molecular findings, we 
found that among the 25 patients who achieved ER, 12 (48%) had fusions and 13 
(52%) had point variants, with no statistically significant difference. However, 
among the 19 patients with PD, 12 (64%) had fusions and 7 (36%) had point 
variants, a difference that was statistically significant (p < 0.01). In 5/63 
(8%), pathological germline mutations were observed in genes associated with 
hereditary tumor predisposition syndromes (HTPS): DICER1 (n:2), PTEN (n:1), and 
MSH6 (n:2).
CONCLUSIONS: Interestingly, in our PTC cohort the NGS panel was highly specific 
to detect molecular alterations. Fusions were more frequent at a younger age and 
in the ATA-2015 high-recurrence-risk group; however, it was not a determining 
factor to predict PTC outcome. Finally, detection of pathological germline 
mutations in genes involved in HTPS was useful for genetic counselling.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether left atrial (LA) strain can 
identify early alterations in LA function in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) patients treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy regimen and whether these 
alterations can prospectively predict the subsequent development of cancer 
therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD).
METHODS: DLBCL patients scheduled to receive the R-CHOP regimen were 
prospectively recruited for this study. Echocardiography was performed at T0 
(pre-chemotherapy), T1 (after the third cycle), T2 (end of 6-8 cycles), and T3 
(1-year post-T2). Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS), LA 
reservoir strain (LASr), LA conduit strain (LAScd), LA contraction strain 
(LASct), and LA stiffness index (LASI) were calculated using speckle tracking 
echocardiography (STE). Patients were divided into CTRCD and non-CTRCD groups 
based on a > 15% reduction in LV GLS.
RESULTS: Seventeen patients (23.6%) developed to CTRCD after chemotherapy. 
Patients who developed CTRCD were relatively older (67 [57-71] vs. 60 [49-68], p 
< 0.05). A significant deterioration in LASr, LAScd, and LASI at T1 persisted 
throughout the follow-up period. Relative changes in LASr (≥ 23.4%) and LASI (≥ 
20.0%) were robust predictors of subsequent CTRCD development. The LASr > 35% 
criterion in the validation cohort demonstrated substantial agreement with the 
2016 ASE guidelines.
CONCLUSION: LASr and LASI effectively identify early alterations in LA function 
in DLBCL patients. Relative changes in LASr and LASI are robust predictors of 
subsequent CTRCD development.

Bitter taste receptors (T2Rs), a family of G-protein coupled receptors, are 
emerging as potential therapeutic targets in head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma (HNSCC). Phendione, a known T2R5 agonist, has not been previously 
investigated in HNSCC. Here, we show that phendione activates endogenously 
expressed T2R5 in HNSCC cells and ex vivo tumor samples, inducing sustained 
calcium responses, reducing cell viability, and promoting apoptosis through a 
T2R5-dependent mechanism. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data revealed that 
high T2R5 expression in HNSCC tumors correlates with improved long-term 
disease-specific survival, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role for 
T2R5. These findings highlight T2R5 as a promising therapeutic target in HNSCC 
and support further investigation of phendione or other T2R5 agonists as 
potential anti-cancer agents.

Accurate capture and analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from cancer 
patients' blood are crucial for early diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized 
therapy of cancer. However, it is a significant challenge to develop an 
efficient and cost-effective method for the isolation and analysis of CTCs from 
a complex peripheral blood. Herein, we developed a novel microfluidic platform 
integrated with SU-8 nanodendritic pyramidal microcone array deposition of gold 
film (SNPMA/Au) substrate for the multistage capture of CTCs and in situ 
single-cell heterogeneity analysis using the surface-enhanced Raman scattering 
(SERS) technology. The staggered pyramid structure greatly increased the 
collision probability between the substrate and CTCs, while nanodendritic 
structure with aptamer modification on the surface of SNPMA/Au provided 
conditions for cancer cell attachment, which thereby realized the efficient 
capture (90.6% ± 4.5%). The pre-enrichment chamber of the chip was designed to 
increase the concentration of cancer cells, simultaneously reducing the movement 
rate of CTCs into the capture chamber. Finally, the SERS-microfluidic platform 
is capable of the efficient capture of CTCs from whole blood, and biomarkers 
expressed on cancer cells can be readily identified through SERS mapping 
technology. Therefore, the cellular heterogeneity can be highlighted through 
variations of biomarker distribution and expression levels. With the successful 
capture and detection of CTCs in a clinical sample by this platform, it is 
anticipated that this technology could serve a crucial role in the rapid and 
sensitive diagnosis of cancer diseases in clinical applications.

BackgroundVisceral upper abdominal pain caused by malignant and non-malignant 
etiologies can be treated by neurolysis of the splanchnic nerves and the celiac 
plexus. The purpose of this report is to compare the effect of cryoneurolysis of 
the celiac plexus vs the splanchnic nerves in patients with intractable upper 
abdominal pain as well as report outcomes and adverse events (AEs) of these 
procedures.MethodsA retrospective study of 36 patients who underwent either 
CT-guided celiac plexus (n = 9) or CT-guided splanchnic nerve (n = 27) 
cryoneurolysis for treatment of intractable upper abdominal pain. Pre- and 
post-procedural pain scores, supplemental analgesic use, procedural length, and 
AEs were assessed.ResultsPre-treatment Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores 
were significantly improved at 1 week (7.7 ± 2.2 vs 3.5 ± 3, P < 0.001), 1 month 
(7.7 ± 2.2 vs 4.3 ± 2.8, P < 0.001) and 3 months (7.7 ± 2.2 vs 3.6 ± 3.2, P < 
0.001) after cryoneurolysis in patients undergoing splanchnic cryoneurolysis. 
Similarly, in the celiac cohort VAS pain scores at 1 week (7.6 ± 2.5 vs 4.8 ± 3, 
P = 0.024), 1 month (7.6 ± 2.5 vs 3 ± 2.4, P = 0.003) and 3 months ((7.6 ± 2.5 
vs 4 ± 3.3, P = 0.025) after cryoneurolysis were significantly improved as 
compared to pre-treatment. No significant difference in post-procedural numeric 
pain improvement, percentage pain improvement, procedural length, changes in 
supplemental analgesics, and AEs was observed between the two cohorts (P > 0.05, 
for all).ConclusionBoth celiac plexus and splanchnic nerve cryoneurolysis 
provide significant analgesia in patients with intractable upper abdominal with 
no significant difference in analgesic effect or safety profile between the two 
techniques.

Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a fatal pediatric cancer 
characterized by classical features such as splenomegaly, monocytosis, and 
GM-CSF hypersensitivity, with RAS pathway mutations being the major drivers. 
Mutations causing loss-of-function of the Neurofibromin1 gene (NF1LOF) occur in 
~20% of JMML patients. NF1LOF drives upregulation of RAS/MAPK/PI3K pathways that 
lead to aggressive proliferation/differentiation of immature myeloid cells. 
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative option, but relapse 
occurs in ~50% of patients, indicating an urgent need for novel and targeted 
therapeutic strategies. However, low patient sample availability and a lack of 
reliable disease models have made it difficult to study and treat JMML. Using 
CRISPR/Cas9, we have generated NF1LOF in human umbilical cord blood-derived 
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We achieved a high gene 
knockout rate of ~89% and concomitant loss of NF1 protein in the modified HSPCs. 
Importantly, NF1LOF cells displayed marked GM-CSF hypersensitivity in in vitro 
colony-forming unit assays - mirroring JMML; when transplanted into NSG-SGM3 
mice, they caused rapid lethality, (median survival of 32 days), myeloid 
expansion, tissue infiltration (spleen, liver, and lungs), and specific 
upregulation of RAS/MAPK pathway and STAT5 genes, consistent with patient 
profiles. This first humanized NF1LOF mouse model recapitulates key JMML 
features, enabling investigation of disease mechanisms and targeted therapies.

Graph Quality Matters on Revealing the Semantics behind the Data in Physical 
World.

Yan J, Ying S, Du S, Gao Y.

The physical world is composed of graphs, such as the protein structures in life 
science, the patient relations in medical diagnosis, the user connections in 
social media, etc. Graphs help both build the world itself and understand the 
semantics behind the data for humans. However, how such graph structures work 
toward semantic representation is still unclear, where existing attempts focus 
on employing the graphs for special tasks. In this work, we first introduce two 
measures to evaluate graph quality, namely structural complexity and homophily. 
Structural complexity describes the quantity of graph structural information 
representing the graph structure's symmetry, and homophily describes the 
percentage of intra-class edges to quantify edge consistency. Using these two 
measures, we then discover the relationship between the graph quality and the 
corresponding performance for general tasks, that is the performance positively 
correlates with the structural complexity, and ""J""-shaped correlates with 
homophily, which are proved mathematically. Based on these, we design a graph 
augmentation tool Graph+. Graph+ can enhance the natural graph structure and 
accordingly improve the general tasks. Empirical validation on tasks including 
Alzheimer's diagnosis and breast cancer subtype identification shows Graph+'s 
ability to improve both graph structure and task performance, revealing the 
underlying data semantics.

Quantitative Acoustic Attenuation Scanning Using a Phase-Insensitive Ultrasound 
Computed Tomography System.

Sarno D, Baker C, Zeqiri B.

False-positive indications in breast cancer screening cause pain and anxiety for 
patients and are a time and cost waste to healthcare systems. New quantitative 
ultrasound scanners aim to measure intrinsic acoustic properties of soft tissues 
to aid better clinical decision making. This study details the performance 
characterisation of a novel phase-insensitive ultrasound computed tomography 
(Q-UCT) scanner, developed at the UK's National Physical Laboratory, for 
quantitative acoustic attenuation coefficient mapping of the breast. Scans of 
multiple commercially sourced anthropomorphic breast phantoms were acquired, 
with the results being compared to X-ray computed tomography imagery and ground 
truth attenuation coefficients obtained from measurements of the constituent 
phantom materials. The novel system demonstrated the ability to detect the 
presence of inserts as small as 4 mm in diameter and measure the intrinsic 
attenuation of larger inserts and host materials with attenuation coefficients 
ranging from 0.7 dB cm-1 to 4.1 dB cm-1 at 3.2 MHz. For the host materials, 
agreement with the ground truth values of attenuation lies within the expanded 
measurement uncertainties of the ground-truth values.

Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent malignancy, leading to 
significant morbidity and mortality globally. Epidemiological studies suggest 
that chronological age and diet are among the major contributing factors 
correlated with the incidence of CRC. Our study aimed to provide insights into 
the association between age, diet, and gut microbiome in CRC using molecular 
techniques including RNA sequencing, cytokine analysis, and metagenomic 
analysis. We used syngeneic MC38 mice model divided into two age groups (old and 
young) and three diet groups (standard chow, calorie-restricted and high-fat). 
The major findings of this study are that age and diet impact intratumoral gene 
signaling (nuclear and mitochondrial), and hub genes we identified are 
associated with prognosis in CRC. Fecal microbiome analysis showed that old 
microbiomes have higher alpha diversity compared to young mice. Our results 
demonstrate that interactions between host (age) and external (diet) factors 
regulate tumor growth mediated by cytokines, mitochondrial derived proteins, and 
the gut microbiome. Collectively, our findings advance current understanding of 
the mechanisms by which aging, diet and gut microbiota impact CRC onset and 
progression though further investigation is warranted.

PURPOSE: ESR1 mutations mediate resistance to antiestrogen therapy in hormone 
receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Elacestrant, an oral selective 
estrogen receptor degrader, improves progression-free survival over standard 
endocrine therapy in ESR1-mutant MBC. We assessed real-world elacestrant use and 
clinical-genomic factors associated with outcomes.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This study used the GuardantINFORM database, linking 
>42,000 real-world breast cancer cases with sequencing and claims data. We 
included patients with activating ESR1 mutations detected <6 months before 
elacestrant initiation (January 2023-March 2024). Outcomes of 
time-to-treatment-discontinuation (TTD), time-to-next-treatment (TTNT), and 
overall survival were estimated with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis, 
adjusting for clinical variables.
RESULTS: We identified 756 patients (76% with prior CDK4/6 inhibitor and 38% 
prior chemotherapy exposure), and 742 (98.2%) were evaluable for outcomes. 
Median TTNT was 6.4 months, and TTD was 4.6 months. In those with ≤1 prior lines 
of metastatic therapy, TTNT was 8.8 months, compared to 6.0 months in the 
third-line setting. Prior fulvestrant exposure trended toward shorter treatment 
duration (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.91-1.56). Higher ESR1 polyclonality (≥4 alterations; 
11% of patients) correlated with shorter TTNT of 5.2 months (HR 1.44, 95% CI 
1.01-2.06), but efficacy was consistent across ESR1 alleles (e.g., Y537S, 
D538G). Disease with dual ESR1 and PI3K-pathway mutations (PIK3CA, AKT1, PTEN) 
had a median TTNT of 5.2 months.
CONCLUSIONS: In ESR1-mutant MBC, elacestrant treatment durations support the 
routine use of elacestrant monotherapy in appropriately selected patients. For 
patients with concurrent ESR1 and PI3K-pathway mutations, single-agent activity 
was comparable to outcomes observed in phase III studies.

Mammalian cells sense and respond to environmental changes using a complex and 
intelligent system that integrates chemical and mechanical signals. The 
transduction of mechanical cues into chemical changes modulates cell physiology, 
allowing a cell to adapt to its microenvironment. Understanding how the chemical 
and mechanical regulatory modules interact is crucial for elucidating mechanisms 
of mechanosensation and cellular homeostasis. In this study, we find that cells 
exhibit nonmonotonic changes in cell volume and intracellular pH when subjected 
to physical stimuli and varying degrees of actomyosin cytoskeleton disruption. 
We find that these nonmonotonic responses are mediated by a chemical 
compensation mechanism, where the attenuation of actomyosin activity stimulates 
the activity of PI3K/Akt pathway. This, in turn, activates sodium-hydrogen 
exchanger 1 (NHE1), resulting in elevated intracellular pH and increased cell 
volume. Furthermore, we identify a competitive interaction between the PI3K/Akt 
and MAPK/ERK pathways-two major regulators of cell proliferation and motility. 
This competition modulates the chemical compensation based on the relative 
activities of these pathways. Our mathematical modeling reveals the network 
structure that is essential for establishing the nonmonotonic response. 
Interestingly, this regulatory system is altered in HT1080 fibrosarcoma, 
highlighting a potential mechanistic divergence in cancer cells in contrast to 
their normal-like counterpart, such as NIH 3T3 and HFF-1 fibroblasts. Overall, 
our work reveals a compensatory mechanism between chemical and mechanical 
signals, providing an infrastructure to elucidate the integrated mechanochemical 
response to environmental stimuli.

IMPORTANCE: The American Cancer Society (ACS) Guideline Score captures 
collective adherence to health behavior recommendations, including a healthy 
diet, physical activity (PA), alcohol intake, and body mass index (BMI). 
Exploring the role of social determinants of health (SDoH) in health behavior 
engagement may present opportunities for improving health equity.
OBJECTIVE: To identify SDoH associated with co-occurring health behaviors 
captured by the ACS Guideline Score in a large US cohort.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study included adults in 
the Cancer Prevention Study-3 who enrolled between 2006 and 2013 at ACS 
community events across 35 US states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico 
using data from comprehensive follow-up surveys administered in 2015. Data were 
analyzed from June to September 2024.
EXPOSURES: Self-reported race and ethnicity, marital status, education, 
household income, secondhand smoke exposure, and work status were examined. 
Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes and food desert status were classified 
according to US Department of Agriculture definitions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Co-occurring health behaviors were measured using a 
0-to-8-point score quantifying adherence to the 2020 ACS Guidelines for Diet and 
PA for Cancer Prevention on diet, alcohol, healthy BMI maintenance, and PA. 
Scores of 8 represent complete adherence. Ordinal logistic regression models 
were used to cross-sectionally assess SDoH factors associated with co-occurring 
health behaviors measured by ACS Guideline Scores.
RESULTS: Of 142 085 participants (mean [SD] age, 52.0 [9.6] years; 111 694 women 
[78.6%]), 2415 identified as Asian, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander (1.7%), 
3267 identified as Black (2.3%), 7814 identified as Latino (5.5%), 126 739 
identified as non-Hispanic White (89.2%), and 1989 identified as another racial 
and/or ethnic group (1.4%). The mean (SD) ACS Guideline Score was 4.6 (1.7). 
Compared with White participants, Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander 
participants had increased odds of higher ACS Guideline Scores (odds ratio [OR], 
1.99; 95% CI, 1.86-2.14). Holding a graduate degree was associated with a 33% 
higher likelihood of a higher ACS Guideline Score (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.30-1.36) 
compared with college graduates. Compared with working full-time, working 
part-time (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.57-1.66) or being retired (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 
1.22-1.30) was associated with a higher score.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, multiple SDoH factors 
associated with co-occurring health behaviors for diet, PA, BMI, and alcohol 
consumption were identified. These findings may aid in identifying populations 
most vulnerable to poor health behaviors, guiding future approaches for 
advancing health equity.

BACKGROUND: In our previous study, we provided evidence that iRGD-modified 
co-loaded curcumin piperine liposomes (iRGD-LP-CUR-PIP) have in vitro and in 
vivo anti-non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) activity. However, the mechanism of 
action of CUR-PIP on NSCLC is unclear; therefore, this study aimed to 
investigate the mechanism of CUR-PIP combination anti-tumor therapy by 
inhibiting angiogenesis.
METHODS: The target binding effect of iRGD on the integrin avβ3 receptor was 
observed by cellular uptake assay. Western blot (WB) and immunofluorescence 
analyses were performed to investigate the effect of iRGD-LP-CUR-PIP on the 
VEGFR2/P38/MK2 pathway in vivo. In addition, a new A549 + HUVEC co cultured cell 
model was established and characterized for migration analysis.WB and 
immunofluorescence were used to detect the effect of iRGD-LP-CUR-PIP on the 
VEGFR2/P38/MK2 pathway in vitro, and the effect of iRGD-LP-CUR-PIP on the 
VEGFR2/P38/MK2 pathway was verified by constructing plasmids transfected to 
knock down VEGFR2 expression.
RESULTS: Our data showed that iRGD-LP could bind to the αvβ3 receptor on the 
cell membrane surface; with increasing uptake time, A549 cells could easily 
enter. The results of in vitro and in vivo mechanism experiments showed that 
iRGD-LP-CUR-PIP and iRGD-LP-CUR both reduced the levels of VEGF and VEGFR2 
proteins. However, for downstream proteins (p-P38MAPK and p-MK2), 
iRGD-LP-CUR-PIP was more effective in reducing protein levels than iRGD-LP-CUR. 
In addition, VEGFR2 silencing almost completely inhibited the phosphorylation of 
P38 and MK2, while iRGD-LP-CUR-PIP did not enhance the inhibition of P38 and MK2 
phosphorylation after VEGFR2 silencing.
CONCLUSION: iRGD-LP-CUR-PIP reduces tumor angiogenesis and affects tumor growth 
by inhibiting the VEGFR2/P38/MK2 pathway. Among them, CUR affects VEGF and PIP 
may affect CTR1, which in turn affects CTR1-VEGFR2 co-internalization and 
downstream signaling pathways. These changes result in enhanced anti-tumor 
activity by CUR-PIP binding, and the best anti-tumor activity was observed in 
the iRGD-LP-CUR-PIP group compared with the other groups.

PURPOSE: Individuals with physical disabilities (PDs) face higher cancer 
incidence and poorer outcomes, yet no prior systematic review has synthesised 
their supportive care needs from the point of cancer diagnosis onward. This 
review addresses a critical gap in understanding how to support this population.
METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted across PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, 
EMBASE, and Web of Science to identify quantitative, qualitative, and 
mixed-methods studies examining supportive care needs, including physical, 
emotional, psychological, informational, medical, practical, spiritual, or 
social from diagnosis onward. There were no restrictions on dates for inclusion 
of papers in this review. Data were extracted and appraised using the MMAT, with 
findings synthesised via results-based convergent analysis.
RESULTS: Twenty-five studies (16 quantitative, 9 qualitative) were included, 
representing over 117,000 participants across diverse cancer types. Seven themes 
emerged: (1) Disparities in access to curative cancer treatment; (2) Personal 
and hygiene needs not being met; (3) Being overlooked: Dismissal of pain and 
physical comfort; (4) Unmet emotional and psychological needs; (5) Healthcare 
environment inaccessibility; (6) Lack of understanding of disabilities and 
implicit bias and (7) Bridging the gaps through self-advocacy and social 
support.
CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the urgent need for inclusive, tailored 
supportive care approaches to address unmet needs, reduce disparities, and 
improve cancer survivorship outcomes for individuals with PDs.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Disability-inclusive cancer care and training 
are essential in addressing structural inaccessibility, ensuring that basic care 
and dignity rights are met, and upholding patient dignity and autonomy. Targeted 
research is needed to guide inclusive policies, interventions, and service 
models for this underserved population.

PURPOSE: Selecting patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) that accurately 
reflect the unmet needs of cancer survivors (CSs) remains a challenge in 
oncology, as current processes lack a structured methodology. This study aimed 
to develop and test the feasibility of a replicable, patient-centred framework 
for PROM selection, ensuring alignment between survivors' lived experiences and 
standardised outcome measures across diverse healthcare settings.
METHODS: Our methodology integrated qualitative and quantitative approaches, 
mapping patient-expressed unmet needs onto the International Classification of 
Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). The process involved three steps: (1) 
identifying survivors' needs through focus groups, interviews and 
questionnaires, (2) linking these needs to ICF categories using validated 
methodologies and (3) systematically evaluating existing PROMs based on their 
coverage of these categories.
APPLICATION AND RESULTS: To demonstrate feasibility, we conducted a feasibility 
study involving 35 CSs and seven caregivers within the Italian healthcare 
context. Among the 14 PROMs analysed, the Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation 
System (CARES) covered 94.3% of ICF-linked needs, emerging as the most suitable 
option. The framework's adaptability allows clinicians and researchers to 
identify context-specific PROMs for diverse populations and healthcare systems.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a robust, evidence-based methodology for 
optimising PROM selection, bridging the gap between patient narratives and 
standardised measurement. This feasibility study demonstrates the framework's 
practical applicability in clinical practice, with potential for broader 
implementation across diverse healthcare contexts. Its global applicability 
ensures that survivorship care remains patient-centred, data-driven and 
contextually relevant.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: By facilitating the selection of tailored 
PROMs, this framework enhances patient-centred survivorship care, ensuring that 
outcome assessments remain relevant to survivors' experiences and improving care 
quality across different settings.

BACKGROUND: Peiminine, an active alkaloid, has been reported to exhibit 
antitumor properties in several malignancies. This study aims to examine the 
role and potential mechanism of peiminine in prostate cancer (PCa).
METHODS: CCK-8, wound healing, colony formation, and Transwell assays were 
employed to evaluate PCa cell phenotypes. Cell cycle progression and apoptosis 
were examined by flow cytometry. Mitochondrial ROS, mitochondrial membrane 
potential, and ATP levels were measured to evaluate mitochondrial function in 
PCa cells. Western blotting was used to assess protein levels associated with 
apoptosis, EMT, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Immunofluorescence staining was 
performed to detect β-catenin expression. The in vivo effects of peiminine were 
evaluated using a xenograft mouse model.
RESULTS: Peiminine dose-dependently impaired PCa cell viability without 
significantly affecting non-tumor cells. Peiminine inhibited PCa cell growth and 
motion and triggered apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and mitochondrial dysfunction 
in vitro. Peiminine reduced PCa cell-derived tumor growth in the xenograft mouse 
model. Peiminine inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction.
CONCLUSION: Peiminine exhibits an antitumor role in PCa by targeting 
Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Despite advancements in treatment, colorectal cancer (CRC) prevalence, mortality 
rates, and therapeutic resistance persist as global health concerns. The review 
delves into metformin's multifaceted effects on molecular pathways implicated in 
cancer progression and resistance, including apoptosis, autophagy, 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 
transporters. A particular focus is placed on metformin's promising role in 
targeting cancer stem cells (CSCs), known for their contribution to 
chemoresistance, metastasis, and relapse. The potential synergy of metformin 
with standard CRC treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, emerges as 
a pivotal theme. The review underscores the importance of elucidating 
metformin's mechanisms of action and optimizing its utilization through further 
research, potentially leading to personalized, precision medicine approaches.

BACKGROUND: Lutetium-177 (177Lu)-PSMA-617, a targeted radioligand therapy, has 
demonstrated significant survival benefits in patients with metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Its application in patients with a 
superscan pattern, indicative of extensive skeletal metastases, is less studied 
due to concerns about hematologic toxicity from bone marrow involvement.
METHODS: This study analyzed 133 mCRPC patients treated with 177Lu-PSMA-617, 
divided into Superscan and Non-superscan groups. PSA response (≥ 50% decline), 
PSA progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and treatment safety 
were assessed.
RESULTS: Among 133 patients, 17 (12.8%) exhibited a superscan pattern. The 
overall PSA response rate was 45.8%, (47.0% in the superscan group versus 45.6% 
in the non-superscan group; p = 0.485). Median PSA PFS was 8 months overall (95% 
CI: 5.5-10.4), with 4 months (95% CI: <1-10.5) in the superscan group and 8 
months (95% CI: 5.6-10.3) in the non-superscan group (p = 0.311). Median OS was 
13 months overall (95% CI: 8.6-17.3), with 6 months (95% CI: <1-18.7) in the 
superscan group and 14 months (95% CI: 9.3-18.6) in the non-superscan group 
(p = 0.052). Significant but manageable decreases were seen in platelet (PLT) 
and Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and no significant changes in Hemoglobin (Hb), 
white blood cells (WBC), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), or creatinine, with no 
differences between superscan and non-superscan groups. Baseline hemoglobin was 
a significant predictor of OS (HR = 0.6, p = 0.001), while superscan pattern did 
not show statistical differences (HR = 1.0, p = 0.949).
CONCLUSION: This retrospective study suggests that ¹⁷⁷Lu-PSMA-617 is a feasible 
and safe radioligand therapy for mCRPC patients with a superscan pattern, 
showing comparable PSA response rates to non-superscan patients.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major global health challenge, ranking as the 
second leading cause of cancer-related mortality due to late-stage diagnosis and 
limited effective treatments. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as 
critical regulators of immune responses and potential therapeutic targets in 
CRC. LncRNAs modulate immune checkpoint pathways, influencing genes like 
programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and 
contributing to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Additionally, 
lncRNAs are implicated in the regulation of immune cells and immunological 
pathways, affecting the immune responses. With advancements in genomic 
technologies, the identification and functional characterization of lncRNAs are 
crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies. Their ability to serve as 
biomarkers for immunotherapy responses and their potential to enhance existing 
treatments underscore the need for continued research into lncRNA biology. A 
comprehensive understanding of lncRNA-mediated mechanisms is vital for improving 
outcomes and extending the benefits of immunotherapy for patients with CRC.

BACKGROUND: Quercetin, a secondary metabolite derived from plants with both 
medicinal and edible values, has demonstrated potential in cancer treatment, 
including endometrial carcinoma. However, its anti-tumor effect on cancer 
stem-like cells (CSCs), a subpopulation considered to be a major driver of tumor 
recurrence and metastasis-remain largely unclear.
AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the anti-tumor effects of Quercetin by 
targeting CSCs and suppressing their stemness properties.
METHODS: CSCs were enriched using serum-free medium and treated with a range 
concentration of Quercetin. The STAT3/JAK2 signalling was detected by western 
blot after treatment with Quercetin. The effects of Quercetin on malignant 
behaviours in CSCs, including proliferation, cell cycle distribution, spheres 
formation and invasion, were further assessed.
RESULTS: Quercetin treatment inhibited the formation and maintenance of spheres 
derived from endometrial carcinoma cell lines EMN8 and EMN21.It also 
downregulated the expression of stemness markers, including ALDH1A1, c-Myc, 
Nanog, and Oct4.We further revealed that estrogen receptor α (ERα) is critical 
for mediating the inhibitory effects of Quercetin on stemness and malignant 
behavior, suggesting that ERα sensitizes CSCs to Quercetin. Quercetin suppressed 
STAT3/JAK2 phosphorylation and subsequently inhibited the transcriptional 
activity of STAT3's downstream target gene, Oct4.These inhibitory effects were 
reversed by the STAT3 activator Colivelin.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that Quercetin targets the stemness of CSCs 
in an ERα-dependent manner, highlighting its potential as a promising 
therapeutic agent against CSCs to improve clinical outcomes in endometrial 
carcinoma.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality 
worldwide, highlighting the critical need for the development of innovative and 
effective therapeutic strategies. Baicalein, a bioactive flavonoid derived from 
Scutellaria baicalensis, has emerged as a promising anticancer agent with 
multifaceted effects against colorectal cancer. This work summarizes into the 
molecular and immunomodulatory mechanisms underlying baicalein's anticancer 
activity. Baicalein inhibits proliferation, suppresses metastasis, induces 
apoptosis, and modulates key pathways like PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and TLR4/NF-κB. It 
enhances the tumor microenvironment by promoting immune cell infiltration, 
regulating cytokines, and activating CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, amplifying 
antitumor immunity. By targeting critical oncogenic and immune pathways, 
baicalein disrupts tumor progression while simultaneously enhancing immune 
recognition and suppressing tumor-promoting mechanisms in CRC. Additionally, 
baicalein influences redox homeostasis by modulating reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) generation and restoring oxidative balance, thereby impacting cancer cell 
survival and proliferation. Its anti-oxidative properties further mitigate 
tumor-promoting oxidative stress while sensitizing CRC cells to apoptosis. 
Baicalein have poor solubility and rapid metabolism limits its effectiveness 
against colorectal cancer, where nanotechnology-based drug delivery can overcome 
these challenges. By using nanoparticles (NP) and other nano-carriers to improve 
stability, targeting, and controlled release, baicalein's anticancer potency and 
safety can be significantly enhanced for future CRC therapies. Thus, 
baicalein-NP conjugates can strengthen the immune defense and blocks 
cancer-promoting signals in colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a highly invasive 
malignant tumor, and its tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in 
disease progression and treatment resistance. As key components of the TME, 
fibroblasts and keratinocytes are hypothesized to synergistically regulate tumor 
biological behavior.
METHODS: This study integrated single-cell transcriptomic data with bulk RNA-seq 
data from ESCC to investigate the interaction mechanisms between fibroblasts and 
keratinocytes within the tumor microenvironment. Rigorous quality control, 
standardization, and clustering analyses were performed on the single-cell data, 
identifying ten distinct cell subpopulations, including fibroblasts and 
keratinocytes. The proportions and expression profile differences of these two 
cell types were compared between experimental and control groups. Cell-cell 
communication analysis deciphered ligand-receptor pairs and associated signaling 
pathways governing intercellular interactions. Molecular subtyping of The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort samples was subsequently performed using non-negative 
matrix factorization (NMF) based on interaction-specific genes. A multi-gene 
prognostic model was constructed via least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO) regression, and its predictive efficacy was evaluated. Finally, 
functional enrichment, immune microenvironment assessment, and differential 
expression analyses revealed differences in biological functions and immune 
infiltration patterns across distinct risk subtypes.
RESULTS: By integrating the gene expression profiles of these two cell types, a 
novel molecular classification system was successfully established, enabling the 
stratification of ESCC patients into C1(high-risk) and C2(low-risk) subtypes 
with marked differences in survival outcomes. Patients classified as subtype C2 
had a median survival of 3.8 months, significantly longer than the 1.8 months 
observed in the high-risk subtype C1, highlighting the substantial clinical 
relevance of this classification. Further analysis revealed that the high-risk 
cohort exhibited significant enrichment in metabolism-related pathways, such as 
endocytosis and glyceride metabolism, whereas the low-risk cohort was 
predominantly associated with pathways involved in cell junctions and structural 
maintenance. Mechanistically, the interaction between these two cell types 
jointly promotes the reprogramming of the tumor immune microenvironment by 
regulating immune cell infiltration, HLA molecule expression, and immune 
checkpoint activity. Furthermore, the study identified key genes, including 
SLIT2 and SFRP1, which display cell-type-specific expression patterns in ESCC 
and hold potential as prognostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets. This 
research provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms of the ESCC 
tumor microenvironment, laying a theoretical foundation for the development of 
precision therapeutic strategies targeting the tumor microenvironment.
CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the synergistic regulatory mechanisms between 
fibroblasts and keratinocytes within the tumor microenvironment of ESCC. These 
findings offer a novel theoretical foundation for molecular classification, 
prognosis prediction, and precision treatment of ESCC.

Progesterone resistance is a key factor in the failure of conservative treatment 
in young endometrial cancer patients, and there is no effective method to 
predict and reverse progesterone resistance. CTMP is known to be involved in the 
development and progression of endometrial cancer, but the mechanism is 
unidentified. In this study, the immunohistochemical method was used to detect 
the expression of CTMP in the endometrium before and after progesterone 
treatment. In cell culture experiments, cell growth and proliferation were 
examined using CCK-8 and EDU incorporation assay. CTMP and PI3K/AKT 
pathway-related proteins expression were examined using Western blot. The 
results show that CTMP expression in the progesterone-resistant group of AEH was 
not significantly different from that in the progestin-sensitive group before 
treatment. There was no significant change in the expression of CTMP in the AEH 
progestin-resistant group, whereas there was a significant decrease in the 
expression of CTMP in the progesterone-sensitive group after treatment. CTMP 
knockdown enhances the sensitivity of endometrial cancer cells to 
medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and may act by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT 
signaling pathway. This study confirms that CTMP may be associated with 
sensitivity to progestin therapy in endometrial atypical hyperplasia and 
endometrial cancer. CTMP may induce the development of progesterone resistance 
in endometrial cancer through activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

OBJECTIVE: Elucidating the causal relationship between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
and pancreatic cancer (PC) remains methodologically challenging due to 
limitations inherent in observational studies. This study applied a 
bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design to investigate the 
potential causal interplay between RA and PC, aiming to uncover shared 
pathogenic pathways and genetic predispositions through comprehensive 
instrumental variable analysis.
METHODS: Utilizing genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis data, we 
systematically screened and incorporated independent single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with RA and PC as instrumental variables. The 
primary analytical approach was the inverse-variance weighted fixed-effects 
model (IVW-FE). To ensure methodological rigor and validate causal inferences, 
we complemented this with several approaches: simple median, weighted median, 
and MR-Egger regression. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q test, and 
pleiotropy was evaluated using MR-Egger intercept analysis. Sensitivity analysis 
was conducted using the leave-one-out approach. All effect estimates are 
reported as odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Seventy-seven SNPs met the predefined inclusion criteria. MR analyses 
revealed that elevated genetic susceptibility to RA was causally associated with 
an increased risk of PC (OR = 1.187, 95% CI = 1.355-1.039, P = 0.011). MR-Egger 
regression analysis indicated no significant pleiotropic effects (intercept 
p = 0.434). Cochran's Q statistics indicated no substantial heterogeneity in the 
causal estimates for RA (P = 0.064). Consistent with these findings, 
leave-one-out sensitivity analyses confirmed the absence of influential outlier 
variants in the instrumental variable sets. However, there was no significant 
causal association between PC and the risk of RA (OR = 0.991, 95% 
CI = 0.957-1.027, P = 0.620).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support a unidirectional causal relationship, 
identifying RA as a potential risk factor for the development of pancreatic 
cancer, with no evidence for a reverse causal effect.

BACKGROUND: Weight reduction is a common clinical feature observed in patients 
with colorectal cancer and often reflects underlying tumor burden or nutritional 
status. This meta-analysis aims to systematically synthesize existing evidence 
on the relationship between weight loss and survival outcomes in patients with 
colorectal cancer.
METHODS: An exhaustive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and 
Web of Science, covering all records from the inception of each database through 
May 15, 2025. Inclusion criteria focused on studies reporting quantitative 
associations between weight loss and overall survival, progression-free 
survival, and colorectal cancer-specific mortality in patients with colorectal 
cancer. For the meta-analytic synthesis, adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Thirteen eligible studies involving 17,606 colorectal cancer patients 
were identified. Pooled estimates derived from random-effects modeling indicated 
that weight loss was significantly associated with shorter overall survival (HR 
2.02; 95% CI 1.67-2.44) and progression-free survival (HR 1.34; 95% CI 
1.14-1.58). Additionally, weight loss was linked to an increased risk of 
colorectal cancer-specific mortality (HR 3.27; 95% CI 1.75-6.12). Subgroup 
analyses revealed notably reduced overall survival among patients aged over 60 
years (HR 2.94; 95% CI 2.45-3.53) and those experiencing weight loss of 10% or 
more (HR 3.19; 95% CI 2.58-3.93), compared to their counterparts.
CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss is a significant and independent prognostic indicator 
of reduced survival in patients with colorectal cancer. Further rigorous 
prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and to investigate the 
potential underlying biological mechanisms.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a significant global health concern in 
children, though its epidemiological landscape has markedly changed over recent 
decades. Understanding these evolving trends can guide targeted healthcare 
strategies and resource allocation. Utilizing data from the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) database spanning 1990-2021, we analyzed global, regional, and 
national trends in AML incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) among children and adolescents. We applied annual percentage change 
(APC), estimated annual percentage change (EAPC), and correlations with the 
socio-demographic index (SDI) to quantify trends and influencing factors. From 
1990 to 2021, global childhood AML incidence decreased by 37%, with mortality 
and DALYs declining by 40% and 42%, respectively. The most pronounced reductions 
occurred in children under 5 years of age. Substantial disparities emerged 
across SDI regions, with the high-middle SDI group exhibiting the sharpest 
declines in incidence (EAPC = - 2.96%), mortality (-3.44%), and DALYs (-3.51%). 
In contrast, the low SDI region saw mortality rise by 8% and DALYs increase by 
5%. South Asia carried the highest absolute disease burden, while Oceania 
recorded the highest population-adjusted rates. Nationally, China reported the 
greatest incidence and India the highest mortality, despite both countries 
achieving significant reductions. Despite aggregate gains, childhood AML burden 
remains concentrated in lower-SDI settings, where exposure-related attribution 
is rising and outcome improvements lag. Prioritizing prevention, earlier 
diagnosis, and equitable access to definitive care is essential to narrow these 
disparities and accelerate global progress.

Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies represent a significant global health burden, 
characterized by high mortality rates and profound resistance to conventional 
therapies. This necessitates the exploration of novel therapeutic 
vulnerabilities, and two recently discovered forms of regulated cell death, 
ferroptosis and cuproptosis, offer promising metabolism-centered strategies. 
Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic pathway driven by iron-dependent lipid 
peroxidation, canonically suppressed by the glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) 
axis. In contrast, cuproptosis is a distinct process wherein excess copper 
induces lethal proteotoxic stress through direct binding to lipoylated 
components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Critically, these pathways are 
not mutually exclusive; instead, they are intricately connected through shared 
molecular nodes and metabolic dependencies, including redox homeostasis, key 
signaling proteins, and mitochondrial integrity. This review systematically 
examines the molecular crosstalk between ferroptosis and cuproptosis, 
highlighting the synergistic potential of their co-activation as a powerful 
anti-cancer strategy in GI tumors. We systematically evaluate both preclinical 
evidence and clinical studies for therapeutic interventions, ranging from 
small-molecule inducers to advanced nanoplatforms and immunotherapy 
combinations. Furthermore, we discuss the pressing challenges of identifying 
predictive biomarkers for patient stratification and overcoming adaptive 
resistance. Ultimately, deciphering the ferroptosis-cuproptosis nexus holds 
immense potential to unlock a new paradigm of synergistic therapies, paving the 
way for more effective clinical management of GI malignancies.

BACKGROUND: To develop Deubiquitinase-Associated Signatures (DAS) to predict the 
prognosis of gynecological cancer patients.
METHODS: Using a Cox-Lasso regression model, we have developed 
deubiquitinase-associated signatures for Cervical, Ovarian, and Uterine cancers. 
Developed DAS were validated in TCGA and GEO datasets. Survival analysis was 
carried out to know the effect of factors Like menopausal stage and grade on 
DAS. The Survival prediction accuracy of DAS was analyzed using ROC curves. 
Immune infiltration scores of 22 immune subtypes were explored using 
the CIBERSORT package in risk groups classified by DAS. Further, to target the 
unfavorable deubiquitinases (DUBs), compounds were identified using CMap 
database.
RESULTS: Three DAS were developed for Cervical, Ovarian, and Uterine cancer 
types. DAS was able to predict Survival and classify patients into two groups in 
TCGA and GEO datasets. DAS is an independent predictor of Survival irrespective 
of tumor grade and menopausal stage. DAS, along with the clinical features, 
improves the accuracy of predictions. CIBERSORT analysis has shown that immune 
cell infiltration is associated with risk groups divided by DAS. Using CMap, 52 
compounds were identified to target unfavorable DUBs.
CONCLUSION: DAS is a good predictor of survival, and targeting unfavorable DUBs 
may reduce tumor progression in gynecological cancers.

IntroductionIn low-risk prostate cancer (PCa), the aim of active surveillance 
(AS) is to reduce overtreatment and avoid potential adverse effects. The 
rebiopsy approach in AS remains debated, spanning routine scheduled biopsies to 
clinically- or imaging-driven rebiopsies based on PSA kinetics or 
multiparametric MRI (mpMRI). In this retrospective, single-center comparative 
cohort study, we examined outcomes of periodic vs patient-based rebiopsy during 
AS and evaluated oncological outcomes in patients with PCa.MethodsSeventy-four 
patients who underwent at least one year of AS for PCa between January 2019 and 
July 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. Two distinct AS protocol patients were 
included in the study from 4 different physicians in our clinic. Demographic 
data, PSA levels, PSA kinetics, mpMRI findings, and rebiopsy pathology results 
were documented. Radical prostatectomy (RP) pathology results and factors 
influencing definitive treatment (DT) decisions were compared between the 2 
groups: periodic rebiopsy (n = 41), and patient-based rebiopsy (n = 
33).ResultsThe median rebiopsy time was shorter in the periodic group (12.5 
months, IQR: 1) than in the patient-based group (14 months, IQR: 9; P < 0.001). 
First-year rebiopsies were more frequent in the periodic group (68.3%) than in 
the patient-based group (45.5%; P = 0.048). No significant difference in DT 
switching rates or final pathology outcomes was observed, though patients in the 
periodic group switched to DTs earlier (P = 0.045). A positive Spearman's 
correlation was identified between the maximum PSA density and the International 
Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) score of RP specimens [rho = 0.62, P = 
0.001]. A PSA density cut-off value of ≥0.17 ng/mL2 was found to predict an ISUP 
grade ≥2 in the final pathological assessment with high accuracy (AUC = 0.891, 
95% CI: 0.753-1.00, P = 0.003).ConclusionsPatient-based rebiopsy protocols 
driven by PSA kinetics and mpMRI results can minimize unnecessary procedures, 
prevent overtreatment, and optimize monitoring in AS of PCa.

The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is an important cellular communication 
cascade that plays a crucial role in tissue morphogenesis during embryonic 
development. Moreover, in adults, it participates in tissue homeostasis and cell 
regeneration processes. Its inhibition in the embryonic stage causes 
craniofacial malformations. In contrast, its aberrant activation in adults is 
related mainly to the pathogenesis of several types of cancer and chronic liver 
diseases. Treatment with cyclopamine, a natural alkaloid responsible for the 
inhibition of this pathway, has been used at an experimental level, resulting in 
the reversal of damage, which has contributed to the search for new 
complementary or specific therapeutic alternatives against these medically 
important diseases. This review summarizes the current knowledge concerning the 
role of Hh signaling in liver homeostasis and disease progression. A deeper 
understanding of this pathway may provide novel insights for the development of 
targeted interventions for liver disease.

We consider a cell population structured by a positive real number x ∈ R+ , 
which represents the number of P-glycoproteins carried by the cell. These 
proteins combine two interesting properties: they are involved in the resistance 
of cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs, and the cells undergo frequent transfers 
of those proteins. In this article, we introduce a kinetic model to describe the 
dynamics of the cell population. We then consider an asymptotic limit of this 
equation: if transfers are frequent, the population can be described through a 
system of two coupled ordinary differential equations. Finally, we show that the 
solutions of the kinetic model converge to a unique steady-state in large times. 
The main idea of this manuscript is to combine Wasserstein distance estimates on 
the kinetic operator with more classical estimates on the macroscopic 
quantities.

INTRODUCTION: Iron deficiency (ID) has not been associated with pulmonary 
embolism (PE). The aim was to assess whether ID is associated with an increased 
likelihood of developing PE within the subsequent 12 months.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study. Patients with PE during 
follow-up were selected as cases, and those without the event as controls. 
Patients with chronic diseases, cancer, fractures, or recent hospital admissions 
were excluded.
RESULTS: A total of 43 cases and 199 controls were enrolled. The mean age was 
61 ± 21 years. ID increased the risk of PE at 12 months with an odds ratio of 
2.15 (95% confidence interval (CI95%): 1.01-4.58; P = .046). Survival analysis 
showed more than a two-fold increase in the risk of developing PE in the 
presence of prior ID (hazard ratio: 2.37 (CI95%: 1.30-4.31; P = .05)).
CONCLUSION: ID may represent an increased risk of PE in the 12 months following 
its detection.

BACKGROUND: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common 
histological subtype of renal cancer and remains a clinical challenge due to its 
frequent resistance to therapy and poor prognosis in advanced stages. Apoptosis, 
a fundamental tumor-suppressive mechanism, exhibits paradoxical roles in cancer, 
wherein apoptotic tumor cells can also contribute to immunosuppression and tumor 
progression. However, the spatial dynamics, transcriptional heterogeneity, and 
prognostic relevance of apoptosis-related gene programs in ccRCC remain poorly 
defined.
METHODS: We performed an integrative analysis combining single-cell RNA 
sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and summary-based Mendelian 
randomization (SMR) to dissect apoptosis-related malignant cell states in ccRCC. 
Cancer cells were stratified based on apoptosis gene signatures and CASP9 
expression. Cell-cell communication was assessed using CellChat and spatial 
interaction networks were constructed using RCTD and mistyR. SMR was employed to 
link genetically regulated CASP9 expression with renal cancer risk. A 
CASP9-associated prognostic model was developed using LASSO Cox regression and 
DeepSurv on TCGA and E-MTAB-1980 cohorts.
RESULTS: We identified transcriptionally and spatially distinct apoptosis-high 
and apoptosis-low malignant cell subpopulations. Apoptosis-high tumor cells, 
characterized by elevated CASP9 expression, preferentially localized near 
macrophage-enriched stromal regions and exhibited stronger spatial clustering. 
Ligand-receptor modeling revealed directional signaling via the SPP1-CD44 axis 
between CASP9-high cancer cells and macrophages. SMR analysis provided genetic 
evidence supporting CASP9 as a causal gene for renal cancer. CASP9-high cells 
demonstrated distinct developmental trajectories and formed multicellular 
spatial modules with macrophages and cycling cells. A five-gene 
apoptosis-related signature derived from CASP9-stratified tumor cells robustly 
predicted patient survival across both training and validation cohorts. Low-risk 
patients exhibited enriched immune infiltration, increased immune checkpoint 
expression, and enhanced immune pathway activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that apoptosis, particularly CASP9-driven 
programs, defines a spatially organized, immunosuppressive malignant cell state 
in ccRCC. CASP9 acts as both a genetic driver and spatial regulator of 
tumor-macrophage interactions, contributing to disease progression. The 
CASP9-associated risk model demonstrates strong prognostic utility and 
highlights apoptosis as a promising therapeutic axis in ccRCC.

Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) plays a critical role in maintaining cellular 
proteostasis by facilitating protein folding and maturation. Although HSP90 
inhibitors have been extensively studied in cancer, their potential in 
non-oncological diseases remains underexplored and merits systematic discussion. 
This review focuses on the pivotal roles of HSP90 inhibitors in treating 
non-oncological diseases, specifically viral and fungal infections, inflammatory 
disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. We analyze recent advances in 
inhibitor optimization, the relevant signaling pathways, and mechanistic 
insights into HSP90-client protein interactions. We propose strategic approaches 
to overcome challenges in the clinical translation of HSP90 inhibitors for 
non-oncological indications. Our analysis underscores the need for optimized 
inhibitor design and deeper mechanistic understanding to unlock the full 
therapeutic potential of HSP90 inhibitors beyond oncology.

Gene therapy is emerging as a promising treatment. Ex vivo gene therapy modifies 
patient cells outside the body before reintroducing them. It targets diseases, 
such as rare disorders and cancer, but involves complex steps, including cell 
collection, custom vector production, and gene transfer. Considering these 
challenges, we examined the technical and organizational requirements for the 
widespread application of ex vivo gene therapy. Lentiviral vectors have become 
the de facto standard for gene transfer. Unlike in vivo therapy, 
multi-institutional collaboration drives development, supported by approved drug 
cases. Success relies on combining academic and biotech research, pharmaceutical 
acquisition, and Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) 
manufacturing expertise. More efficient, cost-effective treatment systems are 
essential for further industrial growth and broader adoption.

PURPOSE: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radiopharmaceutical 
therapy (RPT) is a safe and well-tolerated treatment option for metastatic, 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A new radioligand, comprising 
ibuprofen as an albumin-binding entity, [177Lu]Lu-SibuDAB, demonstrated an 
increased tumour-absorbed dose and efficacy in preclinical studies while 
tumour-to-organ absorbed dose coefficient ratios were similar to conventional 
PSMA radiopharmaceuticals. We conducted a translational study to evaluate 
response rate, safety and efficacy, and quality of life of [177Lu]Lu-Sibu-DAB in 
progressive mCRPC patients.
METHODS: From July 2021 to January 2023 a total of seventeen eligible patients, 
sixteen (median age 71 years, range 63-83) were selected to receive up to four 
cycles of [177Lu]Lu-SibuDAB at an activity of 4.3 to 5.9 GBq (median 5.3 GBq). 
The response rate was assessed by serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) and by 
PET/CT using [18F]PSMA-1007, at baseline and post-therapeutic up to eight weeks, 
using RECIP 1.0 criteria. Safety and adverse events were investigated clinically 
by analyzing serial blood biomarkers and the recording of adverse events 
according to CTCAE v5.0. Quality of life was assessed by the European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life (EORTC) 
questionnaires QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25.
RESULTS: Seven participants received 4 cycles of [177Lu]Lu-SibuDAB, 3 
participants received 3 cycles and 6 participants received ≤ 2 cycles because of 
disease progression or advanced stage of the disease. A maximum PSA decline 
(median baseline PSA value: 49.1 ng/ml (min 0,84 ng/ml max 145,1 ng/ml) by at 
least ≥ 50%, was observed in four participants, while stable serum PSA was 
observed in five further participants. Longitudinal PET/CT was performed with 10 
participants, showing partial remission in five, stable disease in two and 
progressive disease in three patients. We observed an association between the 
changes in PSA levels and PET/CT-image-based assessment of the response. Two 
participants experienced grade three anaemia, one of them also a grade four 
thrombocytopenia. Two patients, heavily pre-treated with chemotherapy, 
experienced grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Impairment of renal or liver function was 
not observed. Importantly, no xerostomia was recorded for any of the 
participants. No significant changes in the quality of life were reported. 
Median overall survival was 13.9 months in this cohort.
CONCLUSION: Overall survival and response rates of patients are consistent with 
previous reports on PSMA-targeted RPT while the absence of xerostomia can be 
considered an improvement. Up to four cycles of [177Lu]Lu-SibuDAB were well 
tolerated and [177Lu]Lu-SibuDAB appears to be a valid option for effective 
treatment of patients with progressive mCRPC. Randomized clinical trials to 
assess efficacy compared to established RPT are warranted.

BACKGROUND: Although light-intensity physical activity (LPA) has been suggested 
to be associated with a lower risk of mortality, the minimal and optimal volumes 
of LPA remain unclear. We aimed to examine the minimal and optimal volumes of 
LPA associated with the risks of mortality and disease incidence (i.e., 
cardiovascular diseases and cancer).
METHODS: Data were derived from the population-based UK Biobank cohort study, 
including 69,492 adults aged 43-78 years. Accelerometer-measured LPA was defined 
using a validated, published machine learning-based Random Forest activity 
method, which was categorized into four quartile groups. All-cause and 
cause-specific mortality (cardiovascular disease- and cancer-specific) were 
determined according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th 
version codes. Disease incidence was defined based on primary care, 
hospitalization, or death records.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up period of 8.04 years, 2024 adults died from 
all causes, 539 from cardiovascular disease, and 1175 from cancer. For all-cause 
mortality, compared with participants in the lowest quartile of LPA 
(<3.9 h/day), the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) 
were 0.82 (95% CI: 0.73‒0.93) for those with 3.9‒<5.0 h/day, 0.75 (95% CI: 
0.66‒0.85) for those with 5.0‒<6.1 h/day, and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.68‒0.88) for those 
with ≥6.1 h/day, respectively. There was an inverse non-linear dose-response 
association between LPA and all-cause mortality, with an optimal dose of 
5.7 h/day (95% CI: 5.5‒6.4; HR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.56‒0.71) and a minimal dose of 
3.6 h/day (95% CI: 3.5‒8.6; HR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.78‒0.86), with the 5th 
percentile as the reference. Similar patterns were observed for cause-specific 
mortality and disease incidence (cardiovascular disease and cancer).
CONCLUSION: Engaging in LPA for ∼3.5 h/day was conservatively associated with 
lower risk of mortality and disease incidence, with further risk reductions 
observed up to an optimal dose of ∼6.0 h/day. These findings suggest that 
sufficient LPA offers important health benefits, which can inform the 
development of future PA guidelines.

approaches, particularly when integrated with microfluidic technology, have 
emerged as promising strategies to improve therapeutic precision and outcomes, 
especially in liver cancer treatment.
AREAS COVERED: This review discusses recent progress in the use of nanoparticles 
and polymers for targeted drug delivery, highlighting their ability to 
encapsulate therapeutic agents and release them at specific sites. The role of 
microfluidic platforms in drug loading is emphasized, as they enable precise 
manipulation at micro- and nanoscale levels with minimal sample loss. Literature 
examining the use of polymer-based nanocarriers, microfluidic-assisted drug 
encapsulation, and their applications in overcoming tumor growth and liver 
cancer therapy is analyzed. The article also explores the advantages of 
microfluidics as a tool for fabricating complex nanosystems for controlled and 
efficient delivery.

OBJECTIVE: Ovarian cancer (OV) is considered the most lethal gynecological 
cancer in women. Despite significant advancements in treatment and 
risk-stratification methods, these approaches remain far from ideal. This study 
aims to leverage large-scale public cohorts to identify differentially expressed 
prognostic genes between OV and normal ovarian tissue and evaluate their impact 
on patient survival.
METHODS: Utilizing data from extensive public cohorts and machine learning 
methods, we conducted a comprehensive screening to identify genes differentially 
expressed in ovarian cancer compared to normal ovarian tissue. We also developed 
a risk score for each patient based on these genes. Subsequent analyses explored 
the immunological profiles and genomic alterations associated with different 
risk scores.
RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that a high risk score is positively correlated 
with poor survival in OV patients. The risk score is associated with key 
oncological pathways, immune-related processes, and genomic changes. Notably, 
patients with higher risk scores exhibited increased levels of immune cell 
infiltration and significant remodeling of the immune microenvironment. 
Furthermore, there is a strong correlation between the risk score and immune 
checkpoint molecules, suggesting potential benefits from immune checkpoint 
blockade strategies. The risk score also proved to be a stable and sensitive 
indicator for predicting sensitivity to various chemotherapeutic drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: Through an integrative approach, our study deciphers the 
prognostic, immune, and therapeutic value of the risk score in OV. This analysis 
highlights the importance of the risk score in predicting survival, modulating 
immune response, and guiding chemotherapy sensitivity, thus supporting its 
utility in improving personalized treatment strategies for ovarian cancer 
patients.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the prognostic value of body compositions and radiomics in 
patients with resectable colon cancer, and to develop and validate a 
clinical-radiomics model for predicting the postoperative overall survival of 
patients with resectable colon cancer.
METHODS: This study included 296 patients (43 months of median follow-up) with 
resectable colon cancer. Non-contrast CT images were used to quantify the body 
composition at the level of the third lumbar vertebra. Radiomics features were 
extracted from portal venous-phase CT scans. The recursive feature elimination 
and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were used for 
feature selection and construction of radiomic signatures. Univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to identify body composition. 
Combined with radiomics features, clinical-radiomics prediction model was 
constructed and plotted by nomogram, with performance metrics including the area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curves, decision 
curve analysis, and integrated discrimination improvement index.
RESULT: Low skeletal muscle density (HR = 0.398, 95%CI = 0.168-0.939, P = 0.035) 
and low visceral fat area (HR = 0.238, 95%CI = 0.108-0.524, P < 0.001) were 
significantly associated with poor OS. The integrated clinical-radiomics model 
achieved C-index of 0.802 and 0.786 in the training and test cohorts, with 
superior 3-year OS AUC values of 0.804 and 0.828. Furthermore, 
clinical-radiomics model has a significant improvement in performance compared 
with radiomics model (IDI: 23.2%, P < 0.001) and clinical model (IDI:5.2%, 
P = 0.008).
CONCLUSION: Nomogram combining body composition and tumor radiomics features can 
help predict the long-term prognosis of patients with resectable colon cancer 
and may serve as an effective tool to promote individualized treatment.

PURPOSE: Radiation-induced oral mucositis (OM) and dermatitis (RD) are common 
debilitating toxicities of radiotherapy (RT) for head and neck cancer (HNC) 
patients. While photobiomodulation (PBM) has shown promise in reducing severity 
of these adverse effects, in-clinic treatments pose logistic and financial 
challenges. This study assessed the feasibility and compliance of a home-use, 
self-applied near-infrared PBM device for the prevention and treatment of 
RT-induced OM and RD.
METHODS: This prospective, single-arm trial enrolled 20 HNC patients scheduled 
for intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) with or without concurrent chemotherapy. 
Seventeen patients were analyzed following exclusions. Participants 
self-administered PBM at home twice daily for 9-11 weeks, from RT initiation to 
four weeks post-RT. The primary outcome was compliance (≥ 50% of expected 
treatments). Secondary outcomes included incidence of severe (grade 3-4) OM and 
RD.
RESULTS: 67% of the participants completed at least 50% of the prescribed PBM 
treatments. Overall, 60% of expected sessions were administered, surpassing the 
predefined compliance threshold. By week 3, 6% presented with severe OM and none 
with severe RD. At RT completion, 41% and 18% had severe OM and RD, 
respectively. Four weeks post-RT, no severe OM or RD were observed, with the 
majority presenting with no toxicity (grade 0). No device related adverse 
effects were reported, and patients reported high comfort and ease of use.
CONCLUSION: Self-administered, home-use PBM is a feasible and well-tolerated 
approach that shows promise as pre-emptive treatment for RT induced OM and RD. 
Large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are needed to confirm these 
findings and evaluate long-term benefits.

BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in 
adolescents and young adults, and its prognosis remains poor, particularly in 
metastatic cases. Chronic inflammation within the tumor microenvironment 
promotes disease progression and immune evasion, yet few prognostic models 
incorporate inflammation‑related molecular features.
METHODS: Bulk RNA-seq data and clinical annotations of osteosarcoma patients 
were obtained from TCGA, and a curated inflammation gene set (top 500 genes by 
relevance) was defined. LASSO and Cox regression analyses identified prognostic 
genes, from which we built a risk‑scoring model; optimal cut‑offs were set by 
maximally selected rank statistics. Model performance was evaluated using 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves and time‑dependent ROC analysis. We then 
constructed and calibrated a nomogram combining key genes and metastasis status. 
Single‑cell RNA‑seq data (GSE1624554) were processed in Seurat to map 
inflammation gene expression across cell types. Immune infiltration differences 
between risk groups were assessed via ESTIMATE and ssGSEA. Differentially 
expressed genes underwent GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, and potential drug 
repurposing candidates were explored through cMap and molecular docking with 
Temozolomide.
RESULTS: The resulting 11‑gene signature stratified patients into high and low 
risk with markedly different overall survival (p < 0.001), achieving AUCs of 
0.808, 0.883, and 0.879 at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The nomogram 
demonstrated excellent calibration and discriminative ability. Single‑cell 
analysis revealed macrophage‑ and myeloid‑specific enrichment of CD163 and 
SAMHD1. Low‑risk tumors exhibited higher immune and stromal scores, increased 
CD8⁺ T‑cell and APC activity, and enrichment of cytokine‑related pathways. 
Pan‑cancer assessment highlighted context‑dependent roles for PPARG, TERT, and 
VEGFA. Molecular docking predicted a favorable binding energy (-6.8 kcal/mol) 
between TERT and Temozolomide.
CONCLUSIONS: This inflammation-related risk model provides a novel prognostic 
tool for osteosarcoma, elucidates the interplay between tumor inflammation and 
immune infiltration, and suggests potential therapeutic targets and drug 
repurposing strategies.

BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers remain a significant global health 
burden with high mortality rates. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has emerged as a 
complementary therapy, yet limited real-world evidence regarding its use and 
effectiveness in GI cancers.
METHODS: This scoping review evaluated findings on CHM usage patterns and 
survival outcomes in GI cancer patients from studies using the Taiwan National 
Health Insurance Research Database, a uniquely data source covering 99.99% of 
the Taiwanese population. Five databases were searched for studies from January 
1, 1997, to November 30, 2024. Information on exposures and outcomes were 
extracted, alongside study designs, patient characteristics, methodologies, and 
results.
RESULTS: We identified seven studies focusing on liver (n = 3), gastric (n = 2), 
pancreatic (n = 1) and colon (n = 1) cancers. Of the 6 studies that evaluated 
usage patterns, Bai-Hua-She-She-Cao (Oldenlandia Diffusae Herba) and Dan-Shen 
(Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma) were the most frequently used herbs 
among Taiwanese GI cancer patients. Of the 6 studies that investigated survival, 
complementary CHM use was associated with lower mortality (adjusted 
HRs = 0.41-0.68) compared to conventional treatment only. Subgroup analyses 
showed longer durations of CHM use were associated with greater survival 
benefits. However, potential for confounding and bias tempers any conclusions.
CONCLUSION: This review underscores the potential role of CHM as a complementary 
treatment for improving survival in GI cancers in real-world settings. These 
findings will require future rigorously-designed multinational observational 
studies and trials to further identify the role of specific herbal treatment in 
contemporary oncological care to improve outcomes for people with GI cancer.

RICTOR, a core component of the mTORC2 complex, regulates AKT signaling and has 
been implicated in tumor biology. While RICTOR amplification and overexpression 
have been reported, the mutational landscape of RICTOR and its molecular context 
in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain insufficiently characterized. This 
study aimed to describe the prevalence and co-alteration patterns of RICTOR 
mutations in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. We retrospectively analyzed 137 
patients diagnosed with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma between 2018 and 2024. 
Genomic profiling was performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS). 
Pathogenic alterations were catalogued, and co-mutation patterns in 
RICTOR-mutant and wild-type tumors were compared. RICTOR mutations were 
identified in 15% (n = 20) of patients. These mutations were most frequently 
co-detected with EGFR (65%), KRAS (55%), and TP53 (45%) alterations. Uncommon 
EGFR variants, including G719X and exon 20 insertions, were enriched in the 
RICTOR-mutant subgroup. Additional co-occurring events included PIK3CA, STK11, 
KEAP1, HER2, and BRAF V600E, though at lower frequencies. Gene fusions such as 
ALK-EML4 and ROS1 rearrangements were rarely observed in RICTOR-mutant cases. 
RICTOR mutations in lung adenocarcinoma define a molecularly distinct subgroup 
characterized by preferential co-occurrence with EGFR, KRAS, and TP53, as well 
as a broader spectrum of genomic alterations. These findings support the view 
that RICTOR functions within complex oncogenic contexts and warrant further 
investigation in larger, multi-institutional cohorts.

INTRODUCTION: Conventional drug delivery for cancer therapy often suffer from 
poor targeting efficiency, limited bioavailability, and severe off-target 
toxicity. Nanoparticle-based approaches have emerged as transformative 
alternatives, particularly when integrated with microfluidic technologies. In 
the context of liver cancer, microfluidic-assisted polymeric nanocarriers 
provide a highly controllable and reproducible route for improving drug delivery 
outcomes.
AREAS COVERED: We cover recent developments in polymeric nanoparticle systems; 
their integration with microfluidic fabrication platforms for liver cancer 
therapy; the ability to encapsulate therapeutic agents, achieve controlled 
release, and facilitate passive and active tumor targeting through 
physicochemical modulation and ligand functionalization; microfluidic-assisted 
synthesis, which enables fine-tuned control over particle size, surface 
chemistry, and payload distribution with minimal batch-to-batch variation; 
PEGylated PLGA, cyclodextrin-based, and stimuli-responsive polymeric 
nanocarriers, highlighting their potential in overcoming biological barriers and 
enhancing therapeutic index.
EXPERT OPINION: Microfluidic-assisted nanoparticle fabrication represents a 
paradigm shift in the design and clinical translation of targeted therapies for 
liver cancer. By allowing real-time control over nanoparticle synthesis and 
enabling combination delivery strategies, this approach holds great promise for 
personalized and precision oncology. Continued integration of microfluidic 
engineering with biomaterial science and clinical insights is expected to 
accelerate the realization of safe, reproducible, and patient-tailored 
nanotherapeutics for hepatocellular carcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Increased application of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and adjuvant 
therapy (AT) could limit treatment options for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC) recurrence. This study aimed to identify patterns of recurrence-focused 
treatment and survival following different primary treatment strategies.
METHODS: All patients who underwent PDAC resection in the Netherlands 
(2014-2019) were included. Patients were divided into five groups according to 
their primary treatment strategy: (1) resection only, (2) gemcitabine-based NAT 
+ resection, (3) FOLFIRINOX-based NAT + resection, (4) resection + 
gemcitabine-based AT, and (5) resection + FOLFIRINOX-based AT. Differences in 
recurrence-focused treatment and post-recurrence survival (PRS) were assessed 
using multivariable logistic and Cox-proportional hazards analyses and were 
presented as odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals (95% CIs), respectively.
RESULTS: In total, 1739 patients (median follow-up of 51 [interquartile range 
34-64] months) were included, of whom 1272 (73%) had disease recurrence. In 
these patients, recurrence-focused treatment was administered in 64/124 (52%) 
after FOLFIRINOX-based NAT compared with 74/410 (18%) with resection only (OR 
4.13 [95% CI 3.34-5.12]; P<0.001), 29/70 (41%) with gemcitabine-based NAT (OR 
1.61 [95% CI 1.21-2.15]; P<0.001), 239/604 (39%) with gemcitabine-based AT (OR 
1.73 [95% CI 1.43-2.09]; P<0.001), and 24/64 (38%) with FOLFIRINOX-based AT (OR 
1.44 [95% CI 1.06-1.95]; P=0.02). Recurrence-focused treatment was associated 
with a median PRS of 11 (95% CI 10-13) months compared with 3 (95% CI 2-3) 
months in patients with best supportive care (HR 0.31 [95% CI 0.26-0.37]; 
P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence-focused treatment differs between patients with PDAC who 
received different primary treatment strategies and is associated with improved 
PRS.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a potent oncogenic virus capable of manipulating 
cell death and cell survival pathways in order to persist in human B cells. 
Since the discovery of EBV in Burkitt's lymphoma cells in 1964, cell culture has 
played an important role in uncovering EBV's ability to overcome cell death 
pathways such as apoptosis and ferroptosis. Whilst apoptosis is a genetically 
defined and developmentally regulated non-immunogenic cell death program, 
ferroptosis is a mode of necrotic cell death that is closely linked to amino 
acid, lipid, redox, energy, selenium, and iron metabolism. Such cell culture 
studies have not only played a pivotal role in our understanding of the role of 
EBV in growth transformation and cancer but have also enriched knowledge in the 
fields of cell death. Artificial in vitro cell culture conditions including (i) 
oxygen partial pressure, (ii) media composition, (iii) cell density, (iv) cell-, 
and (v) pH-homo- versus heterogeneity have profound effects on cell growth and 
responses to death stimuli. In fact, a search for pro-survival genes in 
Burkitt's lymphoma cells plated at low cell density in FCS-supplemented 
RPMI 1640 medium had revealed two genes, glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4) and 
ferroptosis-suppressor protein-1 (FSP1), that are now well-known master 
regulators protecting cells from ferroptosis. Here we review those early 
fundamental studies and reflect on the subsequent literature that seeks to 
understand how EBV viral products can modulate cellular pathways during 
transformation and oncogenesis, reducing the requirement for mutations in 
cellular genes that are found more commonly in EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphomas.

BACKGROUND: Effective maintenance therapy options after first-line 
chemoradiotherapy for limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) remain 
limited. Anlotinib, a multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was evaluated for 
its efficacy and safety in this setting.
METHODS: In this single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial, 60 
LS-SCLC patients who had completed first-line chemoradiotherapy were enrolled 
and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either anlotinib maintenance therapy or 
best supportive care. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) 
and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate 
(ORR), safety, and quality of life (QoL).
RESULTS: The anlotinib group demonstrated a significantly prolonged median PFS 
compared to the control group. Furthermore, patients in the anlotinib group 
experienced earlier and more significant improvement in QoL, and a strong 
positive correlation was observed between QoL scores and OS. The safety profile 
of anlotinib was consistent with its known characteristics, with hypertension 
and proteinuria being the most common adverse events, which were manageable 
through dose modifications.
CONCLUSION: Anlotinib as maintenance therapy significantly improved PFS and QoL 
in patients with LS-SCLC, with a manageable safety profile. This study provides 
initial evidence supporting the potential role of anlotinib in this treatment 
paradigm.

Amino acids are fundamental biomolecules that constitute the building blocks of 
proteins. Monitoring their dysregulation and fluctuations serves as an important 
indicator of human health. The aim of this study is to explore the role of 
exogenous amino acids metabolism in colon cancer development. Raman spectroscopy 
and Raman imaging were employed to investigate biochemical changes in normal 
human colon cells (CCD-18Co) and cancerous colon cells (Caco-2), both untreated 
and supplemented with leucine, threonine, and arginine. Spectroscopic data were 
analyzed using chemometric methods, specifically Partial Least Squares 
Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). Raman spectroscopy, combined with chemometric 
approach, identified unique Raman biomarkers - 1088/1262, 1444/1660, 1580/1004, 
and 1630/1444 - that correspond to changes in nucleic acids, lipids/lipids+Amide 
I, proteins, and lipids, respectively, in both normal and cancer cells 
supplemented with amino acids. These findings underscore the significant 
potential of Raman spectroscopy and Raman imaging as powerful tools for 
investigating the role of exogenous amino acids in colon cancer progression. We 
have also shown that the S₁-state lifetime of tetra-sulphonated aluminum 
phthalocyanine remains unaffected by amino acid supplementation, as confirmed by 
femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, supporting its stability as a 
photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy.

BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers are the second leading cause of 
cancer-related mortality, often due to late detection. There is a critical need 
for non-invasive, highly sensitive biomarkers for early-stage cancer and 
precancerous lesion detection to enable timely intervention. This study aimed to 
develop a blood-based method specifically optimized for early GI cancer 
detection and population-level screening.
METHODS: Using large-scale public tissue methylation data and the Twist probe 
cfDNA profiles, we developed SPOGIT (Screening for the Presence of 
Gastrointestinal Tumors), a multi-algorithm model (Logistic 
Regression/Transformer/MLP/Random Forest/SGD/SVC) for early GI cancer detection. 
The model was rigorously validated through an internal (n = 83) and multicenter 
external validation (386 cancers/113 controls/580 precancers), with an 
interception model assessing its clinical potential.
RESULTS: SPOGIT demonstrated high accuracy in detecting GI cancers, with a 
sensitivity of 88.1 % and a specificity of 91.2 %. Notably, it effectively 
identified early-stage (0-II) cancers with 83.1 % sensitivity. The model also 
showed significant potential for intercepting premalignant progression, 
detecting advanced adenomas (AA) and gastric precancerous lesions with 
sensitivities of 56.5 % and up to 62.4 %, respectively. In the external 
independent validation cohort, a complementary model CSO (Cancer Signal Origin) 
demonstrated an accuracy of 83 % for colorectal cancer and 71 % for gastric 
cancer. Most importantly, simulation analyses projected that SPOGIT 
implementation could significantly reduce late-stage diagnoses and increase 
5-year survival rate by 27.02 % through early interception.
CONCLUSIONS: This study introduced a novel, dual-model blood architecture 
(SPOGIT/CSO) that enables highly accurate, early detection of GI cancers and 
their precursors. By facilitating timely clinical intervention, SPOGIT/CSO 
represented a paradigm-shifting strategy with the potential to significantly 
improve patient survival outcomes and transform GI cancer management.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of breast cancer ranks first among female tumors. 
Early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer can effectively alleviate the 
suffering of patients, and attention to breast cancer diagnostic markers may 
provide a new theoretical basis for biological therapy.
PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of 
LINC00265 in breast cancer and to elucidate its pathological mechanisms.
METHODS: There were 88 breast cancer patients as the experimental subjects and 
72 healthy individuals as the control group. LINC00265 and miR-485-5p levels in 
serum and cell supernatants were determined by RT-qPCR analysis. Cell function 
was evaluated via CCK-8 and Transwell assays. The sponge function of LINC00265 
on miR-485-5p was confirmed by conducting a dual-luciferase activity assay.
RESULTS: LINC00265 was highly expressed, and miR-485-5p was downregulated in 
breast cancer. LINC00265 has diagnostic value in breast cancer and is closely 
related to lymphatic metastasis and TNM stage in patients. Silencing LINC00265 
suppressed cell function, while knockdown of miR-485-5p restored this 
regulation.
CONCLUSION: Significantly upregulated LINC00265 is a biomarker for the diagnosis 
of breast cancer, and LINC00265 binds to miR-485-5p to mediate tumor 
progression.

Gains of chromosome 12p11.21, encoding for the cancer-specific lncRNA LISRR, 
correlate with poor survival across different cancers. In melanoma, LISRR is 
upregulated in immunotherapy-resistant patients to contribute to the generation 
of drug-tolerant cells by activating an immune-suppressive translational 
program, affecting the synthesis of PD-L1 and of the glycocalyx. Accordingly, 
downregulation of LISRR initiates robust immune responses and resensitizes to 
immunotherapy ex vivo and in vivo. The use of glycans to evade immunity exhibits 
shared characteristics with the testis, where defects in the glycocalyx cause 
infertility. Mechanistically, we showed that LISRR affects the ribosome core 
composition and recruits deleted in azoospermia-associated protein 1 to 
polysomes to prime the integrated stress response. Our study reveals the 
contribution of lncRNAs to the generation of cancer-specific ribosomes and 
identifies an RNA-based strategy to overcome resistance to immune checkpoint 
blockade.

BACKGROUND: Serum urate is the most abundant antioxidant molecule in human blood 
and may play a role in cancer prevention. However, the association between serum 
urate levels and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk remains inconclusive, with the 
underlying causal mechanisms still undefined.
METHODS: In the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort, we investigated the prospective 
association between serum urate levels and the risk of CRC. We used Cox 
proportional hazards models to estimate the multivariable hazard ratios (HR) for 
CRC. Subgroup analyses were performed based on anatomical subsite and sex. 
Additionally, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to 
assess the potential causal effect of genetically determined urate levels on CRC 
risk.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 11.58 years, 1960 CRC events were recorded 
among 180,480 participants without baseline CRC in the UKB. Higher urate levels 
were associated with a decreased risk of CRC (HR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.72-0.99, 
P = 0.038). Moreover, the association between urate levels and CRC risk varied 
by anatomical subsite and sex. Higher urate levels were associated with a 
decreased risk of colon cancer in the overall population (HR = 0.79, 95% CI: 
0.65-0.96, P = 0.015) and colon cancer in female (HR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.50-0.87, 
P = 0.003), but not with rectal cancer or CRC in male. MR results supported a 
causal relationship between serum urate and CRC risk, with higher serum urate 
levels corresponding to a lower risk of CRC.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, higher urate levels were associated with a reduced 
risk of CRC, and MR analysis supported a potential causal relationship between 
urate levels and CRC risk. However, further studies are needed to confirm 
causality and to investigate the potential subsite-specific effects of urate on 
CRC development.

Modern cancer therapies, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have markedly improved cancer outcomes 
through more selective tumor targeting. However, as survivorship increases, 
there is growing recognition of long-term treatment-related complications, 
including a range of cardiometabolic disturbances. These include hyperglycemia, 
dyslipidemia and accelerated atherosclerosis, thyroid dysfunction and adrenal 
insufficiency, which significantly elevate long-term cardiovascular and 
metabolic risk in cancer survivors. The cardiometabolic sequelae of ICIs and 
TKIs are often under-recognised and under-monitored, despite their potential to 
contribute to serious morbidity. The mechanisms underpinning these toxicities 
are diverse and agent-specific, involving immune-mediated endocrine disruption, 
insulin resistance, and altered lipid metabolism. Current guideline 
recommendations remain limited across different therapeutic classes and clinical 
scenarios. In this review, we synthesise available evidence regarding the 
prevalence, mechanisms, and clinical management of cardiometabolic complications 
associated with ICIs and TKIs. We highlight key gaps in monitoring and 
therapeutic guidance and advocate for a multidisciplinary approach to early 
detection and management. Greater awareness and standardised care pathways will 
be essential to prevent avoidable complications and optimise long-term health in 
cancer survivors.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key signaling protein in the 
regulation of angiogenesis, and the dysregulation of its expression is 
associated with the development of various diseases such as tumorigenesis. The 
traditional fluorescence detection methods for the VEGF are prone to 
photobleaching and are easily interfered by autofluorescence of the sample, 
resulting in insufficient detection stability and accuracy. In order to develop 
a stable and accurate method for VEGF detection, an ultrasensitive 
surface-enhanced Raman scattering biosensor was constructed in this study by 
designing a scalable Au/DNA/SiO2 nanoprobe (named ADSNP). In the ADSNP, we 
labeled the Prussian blue (PB) Raman molecules, whose characteristic peaks are 
in the silent region, effectively avoiding signal interference from the 
biomolecules. Meanwhile, the distance modulation between Raman molecules and Au 
nanoparticles was achieved by using stretchable DNA nanostrands, which in turn 
responded to different concentrations of the VEGF. Assisted by the aptamer 
nucleic acid amplification strategy, trace VEGF would cause a high Raman signal 
response. In addition, the ADSNP can image the VEGF in living cancer cells. 
Therefore, this study provides a feasible method for the identification and 
detection of cancer markers in cells, as well as a potential value for observing 
cellular biochemical responses.

Early diagnosis of lung cancer is critical for improving patient outcomes. 
Noninvasive detection techniques based on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are 
gaining attention due to their convenience and low risk. This study innovatively 
explores the application of dichloroacetate (DCA), a multifunctional small 
molecule, in lung cancer diagnosis by analyzing DCA-induced alterations in VOCs 
released from normal lung cells (BEAS-2B) and lung cancer cells (PC-9) using 
solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry 
(SPME-GC-MS). A DCA concentration of 5 mmol/L was selected to minimize adverse 
effects on normal cells. Results revealed that DCA induced distinct VOC profiles 
in normal and cancer cells, suggesting differential metabolic regulation. 
Concentration-gradient experiments demonstrated that 2-methyl-2-propanol release 
increased with DCA concentration in both cell types, but cancer cells responded 
only at higher concentrations. Acetoin level in cancer cells increased with DCA 
concentration, which was absent in normal cells. Similar results were observed 
in other lung cancer cell lines (A549 and NCI-H460), confirming reproducible 
DCA-induced VOC patterns. This study proposes a novel strategy combining DCA 
intervention with SPME-GC-MS to amplify cancer-specific VOC signatures, 
providing a promising foundation for breath-based early screening of lung 
cancer. The findings highlight the potential of metabolic modulation in 
enhancing noninvasive diagnostic technologies.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women worldwide and the 
fourth most common cancer in women in the United States. In the United States, 
its incidence and mortality rates have continued to increase since the late 
1990s. Endometrial cancer comprises most uterine corpus carcinomas and 
represents a heterogeneous group of cancers varying in pathology, histology, 
molecular biology, immunogenicity, and prognosis. Recently, the advancement of 
molecular classification and subsequent clinical trials have led to new FDA 
approvals for the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in endometrial cancer. 
However, recurrent and advanced-stage endometrial cancer continues to 
demonstrate high morbidity and mortality, denoting an unmet need for innovative 
immunotherapeutic strategies. This review explores current concepts in the 
endometrial cancer tumor immune microenvironment, comparing antigenicity, 
immunosurveillance, and immunoregulation among molecular and histologic subtypes 
and providing insight into which subtypes may be particularly responsive to 
immunotherapy. Novel immunotherapeutic strategies targeting cancer antigens, 
emerging immune checkpoints, immunomodulatory cytokines, and tumor-infiltrating 
immune cells are described, and corresponding clinical trials are presented. 
Integrated approaches such as immunogenic modulation, which enhances tumor 
susceptibility to immune attack, and immune subset conditioning, which modifies 
suppressive immune components within the tumor immune microenvironment, are 
presented as promising avenues to render ""cold"" tumors responsive. Together, the 
immunotherapies reviewed here offer potential strategies for treating patients 
with advanced or refractory endometrial cancer.

PURPOSE: The prognostic role of tumor proliferation in colorectal cancer (CRC) 
has been unclear, while T cell proliferation has been associated with favorable 
outcome. We investigated characteristics and prognostic significance of 
proliferating tumor and cytotoxic T cells.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Two independent CRC cohorts comprising 1839 patients were 
analyzed using multiplex immunohistochemistry for MKI67 (Ki-67), CD8, and CK. 
Densities and spatial localization of MKI67+ and MKI67- cytotoxic T cells and 
tumor proliferation rate were assessed via digital image analysis. Single-cell 
RNA sequencing data from 62 colon cancers were used to characterize 
proliferating and non-proliferating cells.
RESULTS: High MKI67+ tumor cell percentage was associated with better 
cancer-specific survival, an anti-tumorigenic immune microenvironment, 
downregulation of epithelial mesenchymal transition, and upregulation of MYC 
signaling. In the larger cohort, the multivariable HR for high vs. low 
proliferation rate was 0.60 (95%CI 0.43-0.83). MKI67+CD8+ T cells exhibited high 
expression of effector molecules such as GZMB and IFNG and stronger association 
with favorable prognosis than MKI67-CD8+ T cells. The multivariable HR for high 
vs. low MKI67+CD8+ T cell density was 0.49 (95%CI 0.35-0.70). However, spatial 
analysis of tumor cell-T cell co-localization indicated comparable prognostic 
significance for both subsets when considering their proximity to tumor cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Tumor cell proliferation is a marker for better prognosis in CRC. 
Although proliferating cytotoxic T cells demonstrate stronger prognostic value 
than non-proliferating cytotoxic T cells, spatial proximity to tumor cells 
diminishes this difference. These findings provide new insights into the 
interplay between tumor proliferation, immune response, and patient outcomes in 
CRC.

Acquisition of resistance to anticancer therapies is a multistep process 
initiated by the survival of drug-tolerant persister cells. Accessibility of 
drug-tolerant persister cells in patients is limited, which has hindered 
understanding the mechanisms driving their emergence. In this study, using 
multiple patient-derived models to isolate persister cells, we showed that these 
cells are transcriptionally plastic in vivo and return to a common treatment 
naïve-like state upon relapse, regardless of treatment. Hallmarks of the 
persister state in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) across treatment 
modalities included high expression of basal keratins together with activation 
of stress response and inflammation pathways. These hallmarks were also 
activated in HER2+ breast and lung cancer cells in response to targeted 
therapies. Analysis of gene regulatory networks identified AP-1, NF-κB, and 
IRF/STAT as the key drivers of this hallmark persister state. Functionally, 
FOSL1, an AP-1 member, drove cells to the persister state by binding enhancers 
and reprogramming the transcriptome of cancer cells. On the contrary, cancer 
cells without FOSL1 had a decreased ability to reach the persister state. By 
defining hallmarks of TNBC persistence on multiple therapies, this study 
provides a resource to design effective combination therapeutic strategies that 
limit resistance.
SIGNIFICANCE: Elucidation of the features of the drug-tolerant persister state 
in triple-negative breast cancer reveals shared programs across patients and 
treatments that offer opportunities to prevent persistence and delay tumor 
recurrence.

Radiation-induced skin injury (RISI) is among the most common complications of 
cancer radiotherapy, affecting up to 95% of patients. These injuries include 
acute and chronic reactions that impair quality of life, necessitate treatment 
modifications, and contribute to long-term morbidity. This review synthesizes 
current understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, 
histopathologic features, and management strategies for RISI, with emphasis on 
approaches most relevant to dermatologists and oncology clinicians. Acute 
radiation dermatitis (ARD) develops in 85%-95% of patients receiving 
radiotherapy, driven by DNA damage, reactive oxygen species, and 
pro-inflammatory cytokines. Clinical severity ranges from faint erythema to 
moist desquamation and ulceration, with severe reactions in up to 20%. Chronic 
radiation dermatitis (CRD) affects 5%-15% of survivors and results from 
sustained fibroblast activation and microvascular injury, leading to fibrosis, 
pigmentary changes, atrophy, and a two- to threefold increased risk of secondary 
skin cancer. Histopathology varies from basal keratinocyte apoptosis and 
epidermal thinning in ARD to dermal sclerosis, adnexal loss, and vascular 
ectasia in CRD. Preventive measures such as gentle cleansing, moisturization, 
and prophylactic corticosteroids reduce ARD severity by 15%-30%. For established 
disease, antimicrobial dressings shorten ulcer healing by 20%-40%, while 
long-term therapies including pentoxifylline-tocopherol, vascular lasers, and 
autologous fat grafting improve tissue pliability, pigmentation, and function. 
Dermatologists are uniquely positioned to lead prevention, diagnosis, and 
management of RISI. A proactive, multidisciplinary approach anchored by 
dermatologic expertise and evidence-based strategies is essential to reducing 
morbidity, enhancing healing, and improving quality of life. Given the worldwide 
use of radiotherapy, these approaches are intended to be adaptable across 
diverse healthcare systems, supporting dermatologists globally in patient care.

This study aimed to develop and evaluate a 64Cu-labeled NOTA-conjugated F(ab')2 
fragment of Trodelvy for ImmunoPET imaging of Trop2 expression in gastric and 
pancreatic cancer models. Trodelvy was enzymatically digested using IdeS 
protease to generate F(ab')2 fragments, which were subsequently conjugated to a 
NOTA chelator and radiolabeled with 64Cu. In vitro binding affinity and cellular 
uptake were assessed in Trop2-positive and Trop2-negative cancer cell lines 
using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and cell binding assays. In vivo 
ImmunoPET imaging and biodistribution studies were conducted in subcutaneous 
xenograft models. In NCI-N87 xenografts, 64Cu-NOTA-Trodelvy-F(ab')2 showed peak 
tumor uptake at 12 h postinjection (10.83 ± 2.76%ID/g), significantly higher 
than in HGC-27 (3.33 ± 1.12%ID/g, p = 0.0110). In BxPC3 xenografts, uptake 
reached 10.00 ± 0.89%ID/g at 12 h, compared to 3.13 ± 0.96%ID/g in AsPC1 (p < 
0.0001). Tumor-to-heart ratios were significantly improved in Trop2-positive 
tumors: NCI-N87 (3.53 ± 0.22 vs 0.83 ± 0.34 for intact Trodelvy, p = 0.0003) and 
BxPC3 (3.77 ± 0.07 vs 0.77 ± 0.19, p < 0.0001). Ex vivo biodistribution at 48 h 
confirmed high tumor retention (NCI-N87: 4.14 ± 0.44%ID/g; BxPC3: 4.10 ± 
0.31%ID/g) and significantly lower uptake in control and IgG-F(ab')2 groups (p < 
0.01). Although renal uptake was elevated due to the clearance of antibody 
fragments, histological analyses showed no signs of off-target toxicity. The 
rapid tumor targeting and favorable pharmacokinetics of 
64Cu-NOTA-Trodelvy-F(ab')2 support its utility as a same-day ImmunoPET imaging 
agent. This practical and sensitive platform is highly valuable for patient 
stratification and therapeutic monitoring in Trop2-targeted cancer treatment.

Decreased tobacco use has resulted in substantial declines in the prevalence of 
upper aerodigestive tract malignancies. However, the prevalence of oral cavity 
squamous cell carcinomas has been steadily increasing despite decreases in 
tobacco-related malignancies both within the United States and worldwide. The 
cause driving the increasing prevalence is unknown and may reflect a combination 
of viral, environmental, and genetic mechanisms. Radiologists must be familiar 
with the imaging appearance of oral cavity carcinomas to achieve proper staging 
and to guide surgical and/or radiation therapy management. This article will 
review the emerging trends in oral cavity carcinoma, the basics of oral cavity 
anatomy relevant to subsites of cancer involvement, the imaging appearance of 
this entity, and the information critical for appropriate staging to direct 
surgical management, medical treatment, and/or radiation therapy. Keywords:

Extracellular ATP (eATP) is a major component of the tumor microenvironment 
which has been shown to play an important role in inflammation and cancer. 
Previously, we have shown that eATP, through P2Y12 receptors, increased the 
levels of the pro-inflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) in tumor cells, 
which in turn imparted metastatic property to cancer cells. In a mouse model of 
lymphoma, we further showed that both the P2Y12 receptor-specific antagonist, 
AR-C 69931, and the P2Y6 receptor-specific antagonist, MRS 2578, significantly 
arrested tumor progression. In the case of tumor-bearing mice treated with AR-C 
69931, a strong reduction in COX-2 expression was observed which in turn reduced 
metastasis. However, COX-2 expression was not altered in mice treated with MRS 
2578. In this paper, we report that inhibition of the P2Y6 receptor acts through 
modulation of cell cycle proteins leading to cell cycle arrest. Our results show 
that blocking of P2Y6 receptors is a therapeutic alternative to arrest tumor 
growth and metastasis.

BACKGROUND: Oral cancer is a prevalent malignant tumor, comprising ∼5% to 6% of 
all tumors. The 5-year survival rate for this condition is ∼50%. However, the 
early symptoms of oral cancer are often inconspicuous and easily overlooked, 
leading to frequent misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis. Although some previous 
studies have investigated the correlation between oral cancer and serum 
metabolites, the exact relationship remains unclear. Consequently, it is of 
utmost importance to develop effective early diagnosis methods and explore the 
pathogenesis of oral cancer to enhance patients' survival rates and quality of 
life.
METHODS: This Mendelian randomization (MR) study utilized the Genome-Wide 
Association Study (GWAS) catalog to obtain instrumental variables (IVs) that 
link 486 serum metabolites with oral cancer. The study then conducted a causal 
analysis, using serological metabolites as exposure factors and oral cancer as 
the outcome. The samples used in the study were exclusively from the European 
population. The main method used for the univariate MR analysis was the inverse 
variance weighting method. After excluding confounding factors, MR analysis was 
performed again. Sensitivity analyses were subsequently conducted to enhance the 
robustness of the MR results. Furthermore, metabolic pathway analysis was 
carried out on serum metabolites associated with oral cancer, aiming to identify 
and explore potential metabolic pathways.
RESULTS: After MR analysis, 8 serum metabolites were screened out that are 
highly correlated with the causal relationship with oral cancer, including 
androsterone sulfate (OR=2.11, 95% CI: 1.37-3.27, P=0.0007), 
X-12100--hydroxytryptophan (OR=0.12, 95% CI: 0.02-0.73, P=0.022), 
gamma-glutamylphenylalanine (OR=7.57, 95% CI: 1.17-48.85, P=0.033), 
7-methylxanthine (OR=0.22, 95% CI: 0.05-0.90, P=0.035), urate (OR=12.03, 95% CI: 
1.16-124.32, P=0.037), palmate (16:0) (OR=11.01, 95% CI: 1.11-109.13, P=0.040), 
creatinine (OR=0.03, 95% CI: 0.00-0.90, P=0.047), guanosine (OR=2.66, 95% CI: 
1.00-7.04, P=0.049), and the absence of heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy 
in this study indicates that the MR results obtained are quite reliable.
CONCLUSION: Androsterone sulfate, gamma-glutamylphenylalanine, urate, palmitate 
(16:0), creatinine, and guanosine have been identified as risk factors for oral 
cancer. In contrast, X-12100--hydroxytryptophan and 7-methylxanthine may have a 
protective effect against oral cancer. The findings of this study have 
significant implications for early oral cancer diagnosis and offer valuable 
insights into the disease's pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Engaging men may contribute to cervical cancer prevention; however, 
little is known about what factors may be associated with men's engagement in 
cervical cancer prevention and therefore where interventions should focus.
METHODS: During a national phone survey in Kenya, we asked male respondents 
about whether their daughter(s) had received the HPV vaccine, and whether they 
had spoken with their wife/partner about cervical cancer screening. In this 
exploratory analysis, we used these secondary data in Poisson generalized linear 
models with robust error variance to explore relationships between factors 
hypothesized to be associated with these two outcomes. We report adjusted 
relative risk (aRR).
RESULTS: 600 men contributed data to this analysis, of whom 45.3% had discussed 
cervical cancer with their wife/partner and 30.0% reported having a daughter 
vaccinated against HPV. Knowledge was poor for some items, including that men 
can get HPV. Men with higher knowledge more often had discussed screening (aRR 
1.17 [95% CI 1.11-1.24]) and had a vaccinated daughter (aRR 1.09 [95% CI 
1.01-1.17]). Discussing cervical cancer and institutional trust were both 
significantly associated with engaging in these cervical cancer prevention 
behaviors. Men who knew someone with cervical cancer spoke more with their 
wives/partners about screening (aRR 1.67 [95% CI 1.38-2.00]).
CONCLUSIONS: Both intrapersonal and interpersonal factors were found to be 
associated with men's engagement in cervical cancer prevention behavior.
IMPACT: Interventions that increase men's knowledge about cervical cancer and 
leverage social relationships and community health workers may be particularly 
effective at improving cervical cancer prevention efforts.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and ovarian cancer (OCA) are leading causes 
of morbidity, with emerging evidence suggesting potential interplay. However, 
their temporal and genetic relationships remain unclear.
METHODS: We analyzed 265,248 women from the UK Biobank using bidirectional Cox 
models to examine associations between AF and OCA. Two-sample Mendelian 
randomization (MR) assessed genetically proxied AF liability on OCA risk, 
complemented by summary-data-based MR (SMR) and functional genomic analyses to 
identify shared genes. Loss-of-function assays in SKOV3 OCA cells evaluated 
biological plausibility.
RESULTS: During a median 17.8-year follow-up, both directions showed significant 
associations: AF increased OCA risk (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.61), and OCA 
increased AF risk (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.43-2.14), particularly for serous 
histotypes. MR analyses indicated a modest genetic association between AF 
liability and OCA (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.11), with directionality confirmed by 
MR-Steiger tests. SMR and integrative analyses identified NUP50 and SYTL2 as 
shared susceptibility genes, whose knockdown inhibited proliferation of OCA 
cells.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides complementary observational and genetic 
evidence linking AF and OCA. While bidirectional associations were observed in 
the UK Biobank cohort, Mendelian randomization analyses supported a genetic 
contribution of AF liability to OCA risk but not the reverse. Integrative 
genomic analyses further nominated NUP50 and SYTL2 as potential mediators of the 
AF-OCA connection.
IMPACT: Women with AF may represent a high-risk group for OCA, highlighting the 
need for cardio-oncology surveillance and biomarker-guided screening strategies.

Endocrine therapy (ET) is the standard of care for estrogen receptor-positive 
(ER+) breast cancer. Point mutations in the ligand-binding domain of the gene 
encoding the estrogen receptor (ESR1) are rare in naïve ER+ breast cancer while 
becoming common in the ET-resistant setting. Here, we found that ESR1 mutations 
expose breast cancers to critical vulnerabilities related to lipid metabolism. 
Particularly, ESR1 mutations that induce constitutive ER activation drove 
aberrant lipid biogenesis and lipid upload in parallel with increased expression 
of the acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), which has a 
crucial role in fatty acid activation and has been shown to correlate with 
increased ferroptosis susceptibility. While ER+ breast cancer cells displayed 
ferroptosis resistance, the presence of ESR1 mutations rendered tumor cells 
sensitive to ferroptosis induction. Importantly, ferroptosis inducers 
potentiated the effects of the selective estrogen receptor degraders fulvestrant 
and elacestrant, which are the standard of care for breast cancers carrying ESR1 
mutations. These findings, validated both in preclinical models and in 
patient-derived material, identify a combinatory therapeutic approach in the 
setting of ET resistance and establish ACSL4 as an important biomarker to 
recognize ER+ breast cancers susceptible to ferroptosis induction.

BACKGROUND: Employment and insurance disruptions are common among working-age 
individuals diagnosed with gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, yet underlying 
mechanisms and consequences associated with insurance instability remain poorly 
defined. We sought to characterize the incidence and identify predictors of 
post-diagnosis insurance instability among patients with GI cancer and assess 
the mediating role of employment disruption.
METHODS: The IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims (2013-2020) database was used to 
identify adults with newly diagnosed GI cancer who were employed and 
continuously insured for 12 months before diagnosis. Insurance instability was 
defined as any change in healthcare coverage within 12 months post-diagnosis. 
Generalized structural equation modeling estimated direct and indirect effects 
mediated by early (1-4 months), mid (5-8 months), and late (9-12 months) 
employment disruption.
RESULTS: Within 12 months following GI cancer diagnosis, 1,163 (9.8%) patients 
experienced a change in insurance type versus 3,547 (8.8%) controls (aHR 1.18, 
95%CI 1.10-1.26). Insurance instability was associated with delayed surgery (ARR 
1.15, 95%CI 1.04-1.26), earlier chemotherapy (ARR 0.91, 95%CI 0.85-0.98), higher 
out-of-pocket costs ($3,675 vs. $3,206, p≤0.001) and total spending ($128,514 
vs. $116,939, p=0.016). Insurance instability risk was highest among individuals 
with HMO (HR 2.60, 95%CI 2.32-2.91), EPO (HR 1.82, 95%CI 1.52-2.17), and 
comprehensive plans (HR 2.66, 95%CI 2.13-3.32) versus PPOs (p<0.001). Employment 
disruption mediated 97.2% (95%CI 93.8 100%) of the total effect of insurance 
instability, with 19.9%, 43.4%, and 34.0% attributed to early-phase, mid-phase, 
and late-phase employment disruption.
CONCLUSION: Insurance instability after GI cancer diagnosis was largely mediated 
by mid- and late-phase employment disruption, highlighting the need for policies 
that protect employment and guarantee insurance continuity during cancer care.

Generalizing findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to a target 
population is challenging when unmeasured factors influence both trial 
participation and outcomes. We propose a novel sensitivity analysis framework to 
assess the impact of such unmeasured factors on treatment effect estimates 
called the Proxy Pattern-Mixture Model in the context of RCTs (RCT-PPMM). By 
leveraging proxy variables derived from baseline covariates, our framework 
quantifies the potential bias in treatment effect estimates due to nonignorable 
selection mechanisms. The RCT-PPMM relies on two bounded sensitivity parameters 
that capture the deviation from sample selection at random and that can be 
varied systematically to determine how robust trial results are to a departure 
from ignorable sample selection. The approach only requires summary-level 
baseline covariate data for the target population (not individual-level data), 
thus increasing its applicability. Through simulations, we demonstrate that 
RCT-PPMM can provide information about the potential direction of bias and 
provide credible intervals that capture the true treatment effect under various 
nonignorable selection scenarios. We illustrate the use of the method using a 
yoga intervention RCT for breast cancer survivors, illustrating how conclusions 
may shift under plausible selection biases. Our approach offers a practical and 
interpretable tool for evaluating generalizability, particularly when 
individual-level data on nonparticipants are unavailable, but summary-level 
covariate data are accessible.

Calcium and Gastrointestinal Disorders: Mechanistic Insights and Therapeutic 
Interventions.

Calcium plays a central role in gastrointestinal (GI) physiology through 
regulating smooth muscle contractility, acid secretion, epithelial barrier 
integrity, and immune signaling. The dysregulation of calcium homeostasis has 
been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of GI disorders, including 
colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, peptic ulcer, and pancreatitis. 
Specifically, aberrant calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) signaling has emerged as 
a critical molecular mechanism in colorectal tumorigenesis; meanwhile, 
calcium-mediated pathways influence gastric acid production and intestinal 
motility. This review critically evaluated recent advances in calcium signaling 
within the GI tract, highlighting the crosstalk involved with the gut microbiota 
and the roles of downstream effectors, including transient receptor potential 
vanilloid type 6 and store-operated calcium entry. This review also examined the 
therapeutic implications of calcium supplementation across various GI 
conditions, including bioavailability challenges under different disease states 
and nutrient interactions involving vitamin D and phosphate. Our review further 
addresses the role of calcium in mucosal immunity, the clinical relevance of 
hypocalcemia in GI diseases, and the potential of microbiome-guided nutritional 
interventions. However, despite growing mechanistic insights, considerable gaps 
remain in understanding host-microbiota-calcium interactions, genotype-specific 
responses to calcium, and long-term clinical outcomes. Thus, future research 
should clarify the dose-response relationships, stratify patient populations by 
CaSR polymorphisms and microbiome profiles, and establish precision strategies 
for calcium-based interventions in digestive health.

Erdafitinib-associated Subretinal Fluid in a 75-Year-Old Man With Vitreomacular 
Traction.

Bisarya PN, Chew L, Liao A, Tsui I, Sarraf D.

Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitors are increasingly used in 
cancer therapy but cause ocular side effects, including subretinal fluid (SRF). 
Baseline vitreomacular traction (VMT) may predispose patients to drug-induced 
SRF. A 75-year-old man with bladder cancer and VMT developed SRF after 
initiating erdafitinib therapy. Baseline and follow-up findings were analyzed, 
including ophthalmic examinations, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and 
fluorescein angiography (FA). One month after starting erdafitinib, the 
patient's vision decreased, and OCT revealed new bilateral SRF. Erdafitinib was 
discontinued, leading to gradual SRF resolution and visual acuity improvement. 
Repeated OCT demonstrated complete SRF resolution and stable VMT at the final 
follow-up visit. Erdafitinib can induce SRF, particularly in patients with 
predisposing retinal conditions such as VMT. Awareness of these risks and early 
intervention can prevent vision loss. Further research is needed to explore 
underlying mechanisms and preventive strategies.

BACKGROUND: The divergent loop structures of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 
(nAChR) α3, α5, and α7 subunits (encoded by CHRNA3, CHRNA5, and CHRNA7) are 
involved in kinase phosphorylation and signal transduction, potentially 
affecting oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the most common head and neck 
cancer (HNC). However, their specific roles in OSCC remain unclear.
METHODS: We integrated analyses of SCC-4 tongue cancer cells with CHRNA 
overexpression, immunohistochemistry of OSCC pathological specimens, and data 
from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), DepMap, and Puram 2017 to assess CHRNA3, 
CHRNA5, and CHRNA7 in OSCC/HNC.
RESULTS: In OSCC, CHRNA3, CHRNA5, and CHRNA7 expression interacted with 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and correlated with invasive 
patterns. CHRNA3 reduced epithelial and enhanced mesenchymal traits, supporting 
EMT. CHRNA5 further promoted mesenchymal features, was linked to disseminated 
tumor patterns, and predicted poor prognosis. CHRNA7 enhanced both epithelial 
and mesenchymal markers, maintaining a hybrid EMT state. In HNC, bioinformatic 
analyses revealed that CHRNA3 preserved ion channel activity, CHRNA5 promoted 
DNA replication, reduced adhesion, suppressed antigen presentation, and induced 
hypomethylation and miRNA overexpression, while CHRNA7 promoted differentiation 
with variable effects on adhesion and antigen presentation. In DepMap HNC cell 
lines, high CHRNA3/CHRNA5 and low CHRNA7 expression were associated with 
resistance to most inhibitors. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
inhibitors were effective in CHRNA3/CHRNA7-high HNC, whereas cyclin-dependent 
kinase (CDK) inhibitors were effective in CHRNA5-high HNC.
CONCLUSION: Differential expression of CHRNA3, CHRNA5, and CHRNA7 indicates 
different EMT states in OSCC/HNC, influencing proliferation, differentiation, 
cell adhesion, immune reactions, and treatment efficacy, and warrants further 
experimental validation.

Transition metal complexes featuring unusual oxidation states represent an 
exciting frontier in inorganic chemistry. This review surveys the unusual 
oxidation states of two biologically important metals, platinum (PtI and PtIII) 
and gold (AuII), examining their electronic structures, bonding characteristics, 
and biomedical relevance, among other features. Emphasis is placed on synthetic 
strategies, redox behavior, and factors influencing their stability and 
stabilization. PtIII complexes can potentially offer an alternative to the 
traditional PtII/IV anticancer chemotherapy framework and be an intermediate in 
PtII/IV redox chemistry. Indeed, the PtIII-based platinum blues have been widely 
investigated as anticancer agents soon after the landmark discovery of cisplatin 
as a cancer chemotherapeutic. AuII complexes are less explored for their 
biological properties but may be intermediates in AuI/III redox chemistry and 
offer an alternative pathway to gold-based chemotherapeutics. We outline current 
challenges and future directions in this evolving field, where fundamental 
chemistry meets therapeutic innovation.

BACKGROUND: Fruquintinib is a highly selective small-molecule inhibitor that 
targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptors and is approved for the 
treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Given its increasing clinical 
adoption, a comprehensive pharmacovigilance evaluation of the adverse events 
(AEs) is warranted.
METHODS: We conducted an analysis of fruquintinib-related AEs by mining the FDA 
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, covering the period from the 
fourth quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2025. The regulatory 
characterization of the AEs was based on the system organ class (SOC) and 
preferred term (PT) of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). We employed four disproportionality analysis methods, including the 
reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), multi-item gamma 
Poisson shrinker (MGPS), and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network 
(BCPNN). Furthermore, Weibull distribution modeling was employed to characterize 
the temporal risk patterns of adverse reactions.
RESULTS: Among 1632 reports in which fruquintinib was flagged as the primary 
suspect drug, 78 PTs met the criteria of all four algorithms. In addition to 
known AEs listed on the drug label, the analysis also identified previously 
unrecognized AEs, encompassing large intestinal obstruction, dehydration, 
peripheral neuropathy, renal-limited thrombotic microangiopathy, and posterior 
reversible encephalopathy syndrome. The median onset time of 
fruquintinib-associated AEs was 18 days, with 66.16% of cases occurring within 
the first month of treatment.
CONCLUSION: This pharmacovigilance study aligned with established clinical 
observations. Additionally, novel AEs associated with fruquintinib therapy were 
detected, offering valuable evidence to enhance clinical surveillance strategies 
and risk assessment protocols.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver 
malignancy and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite 
advancements in antiviral therapies for hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV), 
HCC incidence continues to rise due to metabolic dysfunction-associated 
steatotic liver disease (MASLD), obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and 
emerging environmental and genetic risk factors. Understanding the evolving 
landscape of HCC pathogenesis is crucial for improved prevention and treatment 
strategies.
OBJECTIVE: This review consolidates recent insights into established and 
emerging HCC risk factors, highlighting epidemiological trends, molecular 
mechanisms, and global disparities. It also explores novel therapeutic and 
preventive strategies aimed at reducing HCC burden and improving patient 
outcomes.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted, incorporating 
epidemiological studies, molecular research, and clinical trials on HCC risk 
factors. The interplay between viral hepatitis, metabolic syndrome, 
environmental toxins, and gut-liver axis dysregulation was analyzed to provide a 
comprehensive understanding of HCC development.
RESULTS: While HBV and HCV remain significant drivers of HCC, metabolic risk 
factors-including MASLD, obesity, insulin resistance, and T2DM-are increasingly 
prevalent, particularly in Western populations. Environmental exposures such as 
aflatoxins, alcohol, smoking, and air pollution further exacerbate disease 
progression. Gut microbiota dysbiosis has also emerged as a key modulator of 
hepatic carcinogenesis. Advances in precision medicine, including tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (sorafenib, lenvatinib), immune checkpoint inhibitors 
(nivolumab, pembrolizumab), and gut microbiota-targeted therapies, are 
transforming HCC management. Early detection is improving through 
biomarker-driven surveillance and AI-enhanced imaging techniques.
CONCLUSION: The shifting epidemiology of HCC necessitates a multidisciplinary 
approach to prevention, early detection, and treatment. Integrating genomic 
profiling, biomarker-based risk stratification, and equitable healthcare access 
will be critical to reducing the global burden of HCC.

BACKGROUND: Lung and small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (SCCs) are the most 
common sites and histological types of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma 
(NEC). Comprehensive epidemiological information on NECs is limited. We used the 
Taiwan Cancer Registry database to analyze the nationwide epidemiology and 
clinical outcomes of NECs in Taiwan.
METHODS: We used morphology codes from the International Classification of 
Diseases for Oncology, third edition (ICD-O-3) and ICD codes to identify the 
histologic type and sites of NECs, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier method was 
used to estimate the overall survival (OS) of NECs. The risk of NEC death was 
evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.
RESULTS: The incidence of NECs in Taiwan was 3.892 per 100,000 in 2006 and 
increased to 4.039 per 100,000 in 2021, with the predominant site being the lung 
and bronchus and the histologic type of SCC. The median OS of all NECs was 
8.3 months. Female sex, earlier stage, and later diagnosis (2016-2021) were good 
prognostic factors for the OS of NECs, whereas the histologic type of SCC and 
large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, primary sites of the lung and bronchus, 
esophagus, and unknown primary sites were poor prognostic factors for the OS of 
NECs. Surgery combined with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy resulted in 
longer survival for stage III/IV NECs.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the incidence trends and clinical outcomes of NECs 
suggest different etiologies and heterogeneities of NECs. Further investigations 
on risk factor identification and novel treatment strategies for NECs are 
warranted.

BACKGROUND: Treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has seen great 
advances but may not be equally available for all patients.
AIM: To evaluate the impact of socioeconomic status on cancer-specific survival 
after diagnosis of mCRC, with emphasis on potential temporal trends in the 
effect of income.
METHODS: This population-based cohort study, based on 90,620 patients diagnosed 
with colorectal cancer in Sweden during 2007-2021 and registered in CRCBaSe, 
identified 33,498 patients with mCRC through 2022. We used relative survival to 
estimate excess mortality rate ratios (EMRRs) with 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) comparing net survival by income quartiles, adjusting for sex, age, 
calendar year, education, marital status and birth country.
RESULTS: One-year relative survival improved from 55% in 2007-2012 to 63% in 
2017-2022. In the first years after the diagnosis of metastases there was an 
income gradient with the biggest contrast between high-income and low-income 
patients (EMRR (95% CI) at one year: 0.84 (0.81-0.88)). Year of mCRC diagnosis 
did not alter the effect of income on survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant improvements in cancer-specific survival for 
mCRC over the last decades, socioeconomic disparities, particularly based on 
income, continue to affect survival outcomes. The impact of income remains 
consistent from 2007 to 2021.

BACKGROUND AIMS: Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine is a promising approach for cancer 
therapy. However, the development of mRNA cancer vaccine encounters several 
challenges including mRNA instability, inefficient delivery systems and 
potential biosafety concerns. Addressing these issues requires optimizing mRNA 
design, developing novel delivery vectors and enhancing immune responses. We 
aimed to develop a circular RNA (circRNA)-based cancer vaccine targeting 
tumor-associated antigen Glypican-3 (GPC3), a promising target in hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), to improve antigen stability and anti-tumor immune responses.
APPROACH RESULTS: We designed a circRNA-based vaccine encoding GPC3 for HCC and 
evaluated the therapeutic efficacy and safety of the circGPC3 vaccine. The 
circGPC3 vaccine was demonstrated sustained antigen production, overcoming the 
inherent limitations of traditional mRNA vaccines and resulting in more potent 
and durable anti-tumor immune responses. Additionally, we incorporated Toll-like 
receptor-Ⅳ (TLR4) agonist as an adjuvant to further enhance immune responses. 
CircGPC3 vaccine plus TLR4 agonist effectively suppressed tumor progression in 
HCC. We employed multiplex immunofluorescence, single-cell sequencing, spatial 
transcriptomics and mass cytometry to characterize the tumor microenvironment 
(TME) in mice following combination therapy and to elucidate the mechanism. 
Mechanistically, circGPC3 vaccine significantly enhanced 
immunoproteasome-mediated antigen presentation and strengthened the interaction 
between cDC1 and CD8+T cells through MHC-I pathway, therefore facilitating a 
more effective initiation of adaptive immune responses and reprogramming TME.
CONCLUSIONS: The circGPC3 cancer vaccine was demonstrated superior efficacy 
compared to mRNA cancer vaccine. When further combined with a TLR4 agonist, it 
disrupted immune tolerance in HCC, offering a promising translational treatment 
strategy for HCC.

Targeted delivery of antigens and adjuvants to the immune cells without 
eliciting uncontrolled inflammation is a major challenge in cancer vaccine 
development. Here, a highly versatile and programmable peptide nucleic acid 
(PNA)-based vaccine nanoplatform (PVN) is reported to elicit a robust anti-tumor 
immune response against B16-OVA syngeneic melanoma model. The PVN is built on an 
11-mer PNA scaffold, enabling efficient ""one-pot"" loading of a PNA-modified 
ovalbumin antigenic peptide (SIINFEKL), CpG adjuvant, and a PNA-derivatized 
LLP2A ligand (an immune cell and melanoma cell targeting ligand). 
Super-resolution fluorescence imaging reveals the spatial arrangement of OVA8 
within LP10-12[OVA8/CpG/LLP2A], while circular dichroism spectroscopy 
confirmsparalleled binding of complementary PNA strands in LP11[OVA8/CpG/LLP2A]. 
LLP2A displayed on PVNs target activated α4β1 integrin expressed by immune and 
melanoma cells, boosting antigen presentation by dendritic cells and 
eliciting strong CD8+T cell   and natural killer cell responses. This amplified 
antitumor immune response leads to significant tumor regression and prolonged 
survival of mice bearing syngeneic B16-OVA melanoma. The modular nature and 
versatility of PVN allow convenient one-pot assembling of peptide antigens, 
immunomodulators, immune cell and tumor cell targeting ligands, making it 
practical for the custom design and preparation of personalized cancer vaccines.

Ammonia-induced T lymphocyte death (AITD) offers a new perspective on immune 
regulation after the activation of CD8+ T cells. However, the use of a single 
AITD inhibitor is constrained by multiple factors in the immunosuppressive tumor 
microenvironment and requires combination strategies to achieve breakthroughs. 
Herein, a rationally designed organic nanozyme (IR-IHpd) is presented, 
integrating anthocyanin-based near-infrared photodynamic therapy (NIR-PDT) and 
Hemin-derived peroxidase (POD)-like catalytic activity. Under 780 nm laser 
irradiation, it generates ROS through Type I/II photodynamic mechanisms while 
catalyzing H2O2 into cytotoxic ·OH, establishing an uninterrupted ROS 
generation. Co-encapsulated with CB-839 in DSPE-Hyd-PEG and coated with 
dendritic cell (DC) membranes to form a biomimetic system (DMIC), this system 
targets both tumors and T cells. After intravenous administration, the DMIC 
nanozyme system efficiently accumulates in tumor tissues, tumor-draining lymph 
nodes, and spleens, where NIR irradiation induces tumor immunogenic cell death 
while promoting DCs maturation and T cell activation. The DMIC also functions as 
a tumor vaccine, capable of directly activating T cells and preventing tumor 
occurrence. Furthermore, the released CB-839 reduces intracellular ammonia 
levels in T cells, thereby enhancing anti-tumor immunity. This pioneering work 
achieves targeted AITD inhibition for the first time, integrating NIR-PDT, 
metabolic modulation, and immune activation to advance nanozyme-based 
immunotherapy.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effects of circ-RPL15 on 
epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and tumour growth in non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: circ-RPL15, microRNA (miR)-518c-3p and WD repeat protein 1 (WDR1) in 
tumour tissues were detected. Cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion, 
and EMT were analysed in A549 cells after altering circ-RPL15 or miR-518c-3p 
expression. The targeting relationship between miR-518c-3p with circ-RPL15 or 
WDR1 was verified.
RESULTS: The results elucidated that circ-RPL15 and WDR1 levels were elevated in 
NSCLC tissues, while miR-518c-3p was downregulated. Suppressing circ-RPL15 or 
elevating miR-518c-3p suppressed cell growth and delayed EMT process. 
miR-518c-3p was found to target both circ-RPL15 and WDR1, and increasing WDR1 
counteracted the effects of reducing circ-RPL15 on A549 cells. Downregulating 
circ-RPL15 suppressed tumour growth in NSCLC in vivo.
CONCLUSION: Shortly, circ-RPL15 accelerates EMT and tumour growth in NSCLC via 
modulating the miR-518c-3p/WDR1 axis.

Hereditary cancer syndromes are underdiagnosed due to limitations in 
guideline-based referral systems that rely on personal/family history and 
provider recognition. We evaluated the interest in, uptake of, and outcomes of 
genetic services by adults in an ambulatory endoscopy center to determine if 
population-based genetic screening could aid in hereditary cancer syndrome 
identification. Between February and September 2024, a hereditary cancer 
screening questionnaire was developed and distributed to 1010 adults at a 
community endoscopy clinic. The tool was based on National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network (NCCN) criteria and was designed to flag individuals with 
personal/family history suggestive of inherited cancer risk. We offered all 
participants a referral to genetic counseling regardless of risk. A total of 135 
individuals (13.4%) expressed interest in a genetic counseling referral, with 
significantly higher interest among those who screened as high-risk and those 
who were younger: 105 (19.8%) of high-risk participants compared to 30 (6.2%) of 
low-risk participants (p < 0.001), and individuals under 45 years compared to 
those 45 and older (p < 0.002). Only 25 participants completed genetic 
counseling, and 11 proceeded with testing. Two individuals (18.1% of those 
tested) were found to have a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in 
hereditary cancer syndrome genes: ATM and NTHL1. Both met NCCN criteria but had 
not been previously referred for genetic counseling. Our self-administered 
screening tool successfully identified individuals at risk for hereditary cancer 
syndromes, including those who would have otherwise been missed. However, the 
feasibility, efficacy, and overall clinical value of population-based genetic 
screening in an average-risk population remain debatable given our 
labor-intensive process and low diagnostic yield observed in our study. Despite 
these challenges, our findings highlight three promising avenues to improve the 
identification of individuals with hereditary cancer syndromes and increase 
uptake of genetic services: continuing to prioritize high-risk individuals using 
traditional referral models, with an emphasis on improving provider education 
and recognition of at-risk individuals; leveraging technology to streamline risk 
assessment and referrals; and targeting younger populations who may be more 
interested and benefit from earlier intervention.

In this study, cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs) were synthesized using a 
green chemistry approach, utilizing quince fruit (Cydonia oblonga) peel extract 
as a non-toxic reducing and stabilizing agent. This environmentally friendly 
technique represents a novel approach to nanoparticle fabrication, emphasizing 
sustainability in nanotechnology. The surface of the green-synthesized CeO2 NPs 
was further functionalized with cidofovir (CDV), an anti-DNA virus agent, to 
develop a dual-functional therapeutic platform with potential anticancer and 
antiviral applications. The successful synthesis and modification of CDV-loaded 
CeO2 NPs (CDV- CeO2 NPs) were confirmed through a series of characterizations, 
including FT-IR, zeta potential, TEM, SEM-EDX, DLS, and UV-Vis analyses. The 
cytotoxic effects of CDV, CeO2 NPs, and CDV- CeO2 NPs were evaluated against the 
MCF-7 breast cancer cell line using the MTT assay, revealing that the loading of 
CDV onto CeO2 NPs significantly enhanced its anticancer efficacy. Furthermore, 
the interaction of CDV-CeO2 NPs with nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) was 
investigated through absorption and fluorescence studies, demonstrating a strong 
binding affinity and suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles as highly 
specific chemotherapeutic agents. The novelty of this work lies in the 
innovative green synthesis method, the dual-functional therapeutic application, 
and the enhanced biological activity of the CDV-CeO2 NPs, which collectively 
position these nanoparticles as promising candidates for future cancer and 
antiviral therapies.

As the global production of bisphenol analogs (BPs) surges to replace regulated 
bisphenol A (BPA), their pervasive environmental presence and uncharacterized 
breast cancer risk raise critical public health concerns. Herein, the 
environmental risks of BPs are deciphered by linking their structural affinity 
for the progesterone receptor (PR), a master regulator of breast cancer, to 
oncogenic outcomes across experimental tiers. Molecular simulations reveal that 
environmental BPAF and BPB exhibited stronger binding to the PR-ligand binding 
domain (LBD) than BPA. Chemical assays confirm persistent PR-LBD structural 
changes after BPs exposure, mimicking endocrine disruption patterns. The 
cellular thermal shift assay also confirms the interaction between the PR and 
BPs. In vitro, BPAF and BPF boost PR expression at human-relevant 
concentrations. In addition, BPAF elevates PR expression, and the enhanced 
migratory and invasive capacities are effectively suppressed by the PR 
inhibitor. Toxicological Prioritization Index-based risk stratification, 
weighted by the binding affinity of BPs to the PR and cellular toxicity, ranks 
BPAF as the highest-risk analog. Alarmingly, low-dose BPAF exposure (30 µg kg-1) 
accelerates mammary tumor growth in mice, paralleling PR upregulation in tumor 
tissues. This study underscores that substituting BPA with structurally akin 
analogs merely shifts, rather than mitigates, environmental health risks.

N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) modification is a prevalent alteration in RNA, 
influencing stability, localization, and translation. The m6A reader IGF2BP2 
stabilizes various mRNA transcripts of oncogenic proteins and has been 
extensively implicated in various tumors. Intriguingly, in pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC), IGF2BP2 maintains its protein stability despite the 
elevated autophagic activity, suggesting the existence of regulatory mechanisms 
that counteract IGF2BP2 degradation in PDAC. Herein, we explore the crosstalk 
between m6A modification and protein homeostasis, particularly the protein 
stability of IGF2BP2 under excessive activation of autophagic flux. 
Mechanistically, we show that deubiquitinase USP7 acts on IGF2BP2, which 
enhances the stability of IGF2BP2 by reversing its K33-linked polyubiquitin 
chains, thereby preventing its degradation via the autophagy-lysosome pathway. 
Accumulated IGF2BP2 stabilizes PDGFA mRNA, activating myofibroblastic 
cancer-associated fibroblasts (myCAFs) through PDGFR interaction, which promotes 
resistance to gemcitabine. These findings uncover the USP7/IGF2BP2/PDGFA axis as 
a critical regulatory pathway in PDAC progression and chemoresistance.

Extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) serve as functional mediators 
delivering their cargoes to specific destinations. Exomeres (EMs) represent a 
newly discovered subset of nanoparticles, with limited understanding of their 
biophysical characteristics and functionalities. Here, we isolated and studied 
EMs from different normal and cancer cell lines. Proteomic analysis reveals 
distinctive features of EMs compared to small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) and 
identifies galactosamine (N-acetyl)-6-sulfatase (GALNS) and mannosidase alpha 
class 2B member 1 (MAN2B1) to be expressed in EMs, indicating their potential as 
specific EM molecular markers. Subsequent investigations into tumor-derived EMs 
demonstrate their oncogenic properties to support cancer growth and metastasis. 
Furthermore, analysis of murine hepatocellular carcinoma-derived EM reveals 
their ability to induce cell cycle progression and metabolic alterations. 
Collectively, our data highlight the distinct nature of EMs as a nanoparticle 
subpopulation different from sEVs, with cancer-derived EMs significantly 
contributing to tumor growth and dissemination.

Membrane raft-regulated shedding of CD44 is vital for tumour cell invasion. 
Therefore, developing raft-modulating agents is a promising approach for 
therapeutic intervention. Among the main green tea catechin derivatives, 
epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) induced CD44 shedding and modulated the domains 
forming on the surfaces of giant vesicles, suggesting that EGCG may have 
potential as a therapeutic. Additionally, modulating plasma membrane domains may 
be a promising approach for cancer prevention and therapy.

In colorectal cancer (CRC), the upregulation of Candida albicans (C. albicans) 
abundance significantly promotes tumor progression and exacerbates 
immunosuppression. In this study, we demonstrate that candidalysin-induced 
macrophage pyroptosis contributes to the immunosuppressive tumor 
microenvironment (TME). Conversely, the neutralizing peptide of candidalysin, 
isolated via phage display, effectively protects macrophages from pyroptosis. 
Based on this, we constructed an epigenetic inhibitor-loaded nanomodulator to 
target the interaction between C. albicans and macrophages. To ensure precise 
targeting of intraspecific morphological differences, the nanomodulator is 
covered with the C. albicans pretreated macrophage membranes. The nanomodulator 
exhibits the ability to protect macrophages from pyroptosis and reprograms the 
metabolic and immune response of macrophages, while the epigenetic inhibitor 
upregulates tumor self-antigen presentation. In vivo, the nanomodulator has been 
shown to effectively sustain macrophage activation within the TME and promotes a 
robust IL-17-mediated immune response. Meanwhile, the nanomodulator exhibited 
excellent immune memory effects and effectively synergized with immune 
checkpoint blockade therapy in an orthotopic CRC model. This approach of 
manipulating the C. albicans-macrophage crosstalk to augment therapeutic 
efficacy in CRC offers promising insights for the clinical management of CRC.

Despite advancements in early detection and treatment, liver cancer (LC) remains 
highly recurrent due to its complex immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment 
(TME), leading to poor prognosis in advanced stages. Nanomedicines (NMs) offer 
novel therapeutic strategies for reversing the immunosuppressive TME in LC. This 
review systematically analysed the diverse mechanisms contributing to 
immunosuppressive TME formation and explored the potential of smart responsive 
NMs in targeted drug delivery, immune remodeling, and multimodal therapy. The 
immunosuppressive TME in LC arises from abnormal physiological conditions, 
extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, dysfunction of antigen-presenting cells, 
exhaustion of T cells, infiltration of immunosuppressive cells, metabolic 
reprogramming, and microbiota influences. Smart NMs can overcome delivery 
barriers through passive targeting and ligand-directed active targeting to LC 
cells via receptors, as well as to immunosuppressive cell populations. NMs can 
respond to endogenous and exogenous stimuli, enabling precise spatiotemporal 
drug release. This feature enables integration of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, 
and physical therapies. Additionally, NMs can reprogram the TME by remodeling 
physiological conditions, inhibiting ECM deposition, regulating metabolism, 
inducing immunogenic cell death, and modulating microbiota-derived metabolites. 
Although toxicity and clinical translation still require further optimization, 
smart NMs offer a paradigm shift for LC therapy through an integrated ""targeted 
delivery-immune reprogramming"" strategy.

Gastric cancer (GC) has a high incidence, resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs 
and a bleak prognosis. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) can promote GC 
development through Correa's cascade by impacting various forms of programmed 
cell death (PCD). As an iron‑dependent form of PCD, ferroptosis has emerged as a 
major focus in biomedical research. Notably, there have been developments in 
elucidating the mechanisms underlying ferroptosis dysregulation throughout 
Correa's cascade. On one hand, targeting ferroptosis may provide a promising 
direction for the development of drugs for chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) and 
intestinal metaplasia (IM). On the other hand, targeting ferroptosis in GC may 
be a potential option to overcome the challenges in conventional therapies such 
as resistance to chemotherapy. Consequently, the present review aims to deliver 
a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying ferroptosis 
dysregulation in H. pylori‑associated GC and summarize the latest progress of 
ferroptosis‑related studies in CAG, IM and GC. The present study identifies key 
regulators of ferroptosis at distinct pathological stages, thereby providing 
insight of novel strategies for the management of precancerous lesion‑related 
diseases and GC.

The thioredoxin (Trx) system comprises four core components: Trx‑interacting 
protein (TXNIP), Trx, Trx reductase (TrxR) and NADPH. TrxR utilizes NADPH to 
reduce Trx, reducing target proteins through its conserved thiol groups, thereby 
maintaining cellular redox balance. TXNIP inhibits Trx activity by forming a 
disulfide exchange reaction with Trx. Beyond its role in redox regulation, the 
Trx system interacts with various cellular regulators and participates in 
intracellular signaling networks. The Trx system exhibits dual regulatory roles 
in autophagy, with Trx primarily exerting an inhibitory effect on ferroptosis 
and apoptosis, whereas TXNIP promotes these processes. Multiple molecular 
mechanisms are implicated in these regulatory functions. Furthermore, the Trx 
system mediates cross‑regulation between autophagy and ferroptosis, as well as 
autophagy and apoptosis, thereby influencing cellular responses to stress 
conditions. The present review examines the structural components of the Trx 
system and the cellular translocation of TXNIP. Additionally, it explores the 
involvement of the Trx system in various diseases, including neurodegenerative 
disorders, cardiovascular diseases and cancer, highlighting its potential as a 
therapeutic target. By analyzing the molecular mechanisms through which the Trx 
system modulates cell death pathways, including ferroptosis, autophagy and 
apoptosis, the present review may provide novel research perspectives and 
theoretical foundations for developing disease treatment strategies.

Subsequently to the publication of the above paper, the authors have drawn to 
the attention of the Editorial Office that they made an error in assembling the 
western blot data in Fig. 3C on p. 6; namely, that the western blot data 
correctly selected for the P53 protein with the SW620 cell line (right-hand 
gels) had inadvertently also been included for the γ-H2A.X protein blots with 
the HCT116 cell line (left-hand gels). Upon analysing this figure further in the 
Editorial Office, we notified the authors of possibly overlapping α-tubulin 
control blots for the SW62 cell line in the same figure part, and the authors 
realized that one of these blots had similarly been chosen incorrectly. The 
revised version of Fig. 3, now showing the correct γ-H2A.X data for the HCT116 
cell line and the correct α-tubulin protein blots for the SW620 cell line, is 
shown on the next page. The authors wish to emphasize that the corrections made

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of microRNA (miR)-199a-3p on 
the biological function of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) adenocarcinoma 
cells by targeting the fat mass and obesity‑associated protein (FTO)/myeloid 
zinc finger 1 (MZF1)/claudin domain‑containing 1 (CLDND1) axis. Human NSCLC cell 
lines, primarily A549 cells, were used for in vitro assays. Reverse 
transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blotting were performed to assess the 
expression of relevant genes and proteins. Dual‑luciferase reporter assays were 
used to verify the relationship between miR‑199a‑3p and FTO, as well as the 
transcriptional regulation of CLDND1 by MZF1. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation 
was used to evaluate the N6‑methyladenosine (m6A) modification levels of MZF1, 
whereas photoactivatable ribonucleoside‑enhanced crosslinking and 
immunoprecipitation supported the binding of FTO to MZF1 mRNA. Cell 
proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis were assessed using Cell 
Counting Kit‑8, Transwell and flow cytometry assays. miR‑199a‑3p was 
downregulated in NSCLC tissues and cells. Overexpression of miR‑199a‑3p 
inhibited A549 cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Mechanistically, 
miR‑199a‑3p directly targeted and suppressed FTO, an m6A demethylase, leading to 
enhanced m6A modification of MZF1 mRNA and a subsequent decrease in MZF1 
expression. Knockdown of MZF1 attenuated the oncogenic effects mediated by FTO, 
confirming that MZF1 served as a downstream effector of the miR‑199a‑3p/FTO 
axis. Moreover, MZF1 transcriptionally activated CLDND1, thereby facilitating 
the malignant phenotype of NSCLC cells. Collectively, these findings demonstrate 
that miR‑199a‑3p suppresses NSCLC progression by targeting FTO, promoting m6A 
methylation‑dependent downregulation of MZF1, and consequently decreasing CLDND1 
expression. Thus, the miR‑199a‑3p/FTO/MZF1/CLDND1 axis may serve as a promising 
therapeutic target in NSCLC.

Benzene (Bz), phenol (Phen), hydroquinone (HQ), and catechol (CAT) are volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs) (monoaromatic compounds) considered environmental 
contaminants as a consequence of human and industrial activities. Prolonged 
exposure affects human health, causing cancer and death. Researchers have 
developed and applied analytical methodologies in pretreatment samples and 
detection techniques to analyze these monoaromatic compounds at trace and 
ultra-trace concentration levels. The present study is focused on an in-depth 
review and comparative analysis of removal and extraction techniques, 
summarizing the sources (analytical matrix), interaction modes (analyte-sorbent)

Amino acid (AA) sensing plays an important role in maintaining cellular 
metabolic homeostasis as well as tumorigenesis and progression. Studies on 
classic AA sensing pathways such as rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and general 
control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) have revealed their central position in cancer 
metabolic reprogramming. AA sensing pathways are often hijacked in tumors to 
adapt to the nutrient‑deprived microenvironment, promoting cell proliferation, 
anti‑apoptosis and treatment tolerance. In addition, the regulation of AA 
sensing and transport plays a crucial role in maintaining the metabolic 
flexibility of tumor cells. By targeting the AA sensing mechanism, it is 
expected to disrupt the metabolic homeostasis of cancer cells, providing new 
strategies for precision therapy. The present review summarized the latest 
advances in the research on the role of the mTORC1 and GCN2 AA sensing pathways 
in tumor metabolism, emphasizing their potential and the challenges faced in 
cancer diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, it provided novel insights into 
the therapeutic targeting of AA sensing pathways and proposes future research 
directions aimed at overcoming current limitations in cancer metabolism therapy.

Mebendazole (Mbz), a well‑known anthelminthic drug, has demonstrated anticancer 
properties in tumor models and patients, and is thus under consideration for 
repositioning into an anticancer drug. Mbz is directly cytotoxic in cell lines 
by various mechanisms and acts indirectly via immunomodulation. In the present 
study, the anticancer effects of Mbz, alone and in combination with cytotoxic 
drugs, were further characterized using primary cultures of patient tumor cells 
ex vivo and the murine colon cancer cell line, CT26, in vitro and in vivo. 
Patient‑derived tumor cells from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and ovarian, 
colorectal and renal cancer were exposed to Mbz alone and, for solid tumors and 
the CT26 cell line, in combination with irinotecan, cisplatin or gemcitabine 
(patient cells only). Cytotoxicity was assessed using the fluorometric 
microculture cytotoxicity assay. In vivo, the antitumor effects of Mbz and 
irinotecan, alone and in combination, were evaluated in the BALB/c CT26 colon 
cancer mouse model by tumor growth measurements and flow cytometric analysis of 
tumor immune cell infiltration. In the patient cell samples, Mbz showed modest 
single‑agent cytotoxicity, with the AML samples being the most sensitive, and 
displayed enhanced effects when combined with cytotoxic drugs, particularly 
irinotecan. CT26 cells showed modest dose‑independent sensitivity to Mbz, which 
enhanced the effect of both cisplatin and irinotecan. In vivo, Mbz and 
irinotecan both inhibited tumor growth, but the combination did not 
significantly outperform Mbz alone. Flow cytometry of the resected mouse tumors 
indicated that Mbz promoted macrophage polarization from the M2 to M1 phenotype, 
suggesting that immune modulation may contribute to its anticancer effect. Mbz 
has features making it a candidate for repositioning into an anticancer drug and 
part of its effect may be mediated by macrophage modulation.

A highly efficient siRNA vector (PFS-CA) capable of selectively silencing genes 
in cancer cells was obtained by modifying common low-molecular-weight (LMW) 
polyethylenimine (PEI) with a bioreducible targeted multifunctional module (FS) 
to get PFS, followed by noncovalently incorporating chlorogenic acid (CA). FS 
combined folate receptor-mediated targeting for cancer cells with glutathione 
(GSH)-responsive siRNA release into the cytoplasm. CA, a highly biocompatible 
natural polyphenol served as a siRNA condensation enhancer, siRNA stabilizer, 
and ROS scavenger. Consequently, by the synergistic effects between PFS and CA, 
PFS-CA performs very well on several crucial siRNA delivery processes, including 
siRNA condensation, complex stability, cell uptake, endosome escape, and siRNA 
cytoplasmic release. The representative PFS4-3CA exhibited superior transfection 
efficiency in a variety of cancer cell lines, including neurogenic tumor-related 
PC12 cells, than commercial PEI25k and Lipo2k, and extremely high and selective 
gene silencing effects in cancer cells (with a gene silencing rate of 98.6% in 
HepG2 while only 8.4% in HK-2). Our findings demonstrated great promise for the 
development of a safe and effective siRNA carrier for future applications in 
tumor-targeted siRNA therapy.

The present study investigated the effects of Notoginsenoside R1 (NG‑R1) on 
human non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 cells and explored its potential 
mechanisms. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay after 72 h of 
treatment with varying concentrations of NG‑R1 (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6 and 2 
mg/ml), which inhibited A549 cell viability in a dose‑dependent manner. Cell 
proliferation, migration and invasion were evaluated using the BeyoClick™ 
EdU‑594 proliferation assay, wound healing assay and Matrigel®‑coated Transwell 
invasion assay, respectively. NG‑R1 at concentrations of 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mg/ml 
significantly suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion of A549 cells 
compared with the control. In addition, these doses of NG‑R1 increased 
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels as measured using the 
fluorescent probe 2',7'‑dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Western blot analysis 
revealed that treatment with NG‑R1 (0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mg/ml) upregulated the 
expression of the ferroptosis‑related protein transferrin receptor 1, and 
downregulated solute carrier family 7 member 11, glutathione peroxidase 4 and 
ferritin heavy chain 1. Collectively, these findings indicate that NG‑R1 
inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC A549 cells, likely through the induction of 
ROS accumulation and ferroptosis.

AIMS: To examine urothelial cancer-associated 1 (UCA1) expression in severe 
pneumonia children and explore its regulatory role in this condition.
PATIENTS & METHODS: Seventy-eight healthy children and 84 children with severe 
pneumonia were included. Serum UCA1 expressions were detected by quantitative 
real-time PCR. The sensitivity and specificity of UCA1 for the diagnosis of 
severe pneumonia were appraised by the receiver operating characteristic curve. 
The prognosis and factors affecting the prognosis were estimated by the 
Kaplan-Meier survival curve and multivariate Cox regression. A luciferase 
reporter assay assessed the targeting interaction between UCA1 and miR-185-5p.
RESULTS: Serum UCA1 level in patients with severe pneumonia was higher than that 
in controls. The sensitivity and specificity of UCA1 for severe pneumonia were 
82.1% and 85.9%, respectively. Children with high UCA1 expression had lower 
overall survival than children with low UCA1 expression, and UCA1 and 
procalcitonin were prognosis risk factors. Cell experiments suggested that 
inhibition of UCA1 reversed LPS-induced decline in cell viability and increased 
apoptosis and inflammatory factors. UCA1 directly targeted miR-185-5p in MRC-5 
cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal elevated UCA1 demonstrated good clinical diagnostic and 
prognostic meaning for severe pneumonia. UCA1 May have effects on the regulation 
of cell function and inflammatory response by combining with miR-185-5p.

Medicinal plants host a variety of endophytic fungi, which produce numerous 
secondary metabolites with diverse biological activities. The present study 
identified ten natural compounds isolated from the endophytic fungal strain 
Alternaria semiverrucosa, derived from Taxus wallichiana var. mairei. The 
cytotoxicity of all isolated compounds was evaluated against six tumor cell 
lines. Dihydroalterperylenol (compound 1) exhibited the highest cytotoxicity 
against HeLa cells (IC50=6.43±3.0 µM). Cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO and 6.0 
µmol/l for 24 h, after which total RNA was extracted for transcriptome library 
construction and sequencing analysis. Transcriptome analysis identified 140 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 99 upregulated and 41 
downregulated genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis 
revealed significant enrichment of these DEGs in the TGFβ signaling pathway and 
Hippo signaling pathway. Gene ontology analysis indicated that the DEGs were 
predominantly involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. Notably, reverse 
transcription‑quantitative PCR validation confirmed the upregulation of three 
genes (TGIF2, ID1 and BMP2) which was consistent with the transcriptome 
sequencing results. Additionally, molecular docking and molecular dynamics 
simulations were employed to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the 
antitumor activity of compound 1. The results suggest that compound 1 exerts its 
anticancer effects in cervical cancer by regulating the expression of genes 
TGIF2, ID1 and BMP2.

Transition‑metal nanoparticles (NPs) have been extensively studied owing to 
their unique physical and chemical properties, ability to form a variety of 
nanostructures and targeting properties. After surgery, chemotherapy, 
radiotherapy and targeted therapy, immunotherapy has emerged as a major strategy 
for cancer treatment. In particular, immune checkpoint inhibition has attracted 
much attention in preclinical and clinical applications. The combination of 
transition‑metal NPs with tumor immunotherapy offers great potential. Therefore, 
the present review focused on four major transition‑metal NPs (Au, Ag, Cu and Fe 
NPs) and their respective categories, presented their characteristics and roles 
in the biomedical field and discussed their potential toxicities. In addition, 
the mechanisms of action of different tumor immunotherapies and the applications 
of transition‑metal NPs in tumor immunotherapy are discussed. The current status 
of, and challenges associated, with the clinical transformation of 
transition‑metal NPs in tumor immunotherapy are described to provide ideas for 
the subsequent development and clinical application of transition‑metal NPs.

Following the publication of the above paper, it was drawn to the Editor's 
attention by a concerned reader that the first two lanes of the Actin blot in 
Fig. 1D looked strikingly similar to the Actin panels in Fig. 2E for the 
MDA‑MB‑231 cell line, In addition, the Actin panel in Fig. 4A (showing a time 
series) looked very similar to the Actin panel in Fig. 4B (showing different 
treatments). Upon analyzing the data independently in the Editorial Office, it 
came to light that there was an overlapping pair of data panels for the 
immunohistochemical data shown in Fig. 6C, such that data which were intended to 
show the results from differently performed experiments appeared to have been 
derived from the same original source, and data featured in Fig. 6D had 
subsequently appeared in a paper published in the journal Tumor Biology that was 
written by different authors at different research institutes. The authors were 
contacted by the Editorial Office to offer an explanation for these possible 
anomalies in the presentation of the data in this paper, although up to this 
time, no response from them has been forthcoming. Owing to the fact that the 
Editorial Office has been made aware of potential issues surrounding the 
scientific integrity of this paper, we are issuing an Expression of Concern to 
notify readers of this potential problem while the Editorial Office conitnues to 
investigate this matter further. [International Journal of Oncology 48:

Schisantherin A (Sch A), a compound derived from Schisandra chinensis, has 
anti‑inflammatory, antitumor, neuroprotective and antifibrotic properties. 
However, to the best of our knowledge, the role of Sch A in non‑small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) has not yet been reported. The purpose of the present study was 
to determine whether Sch A can prevent the development of NSCLC and to elucidate 
the underlying mechanisms involved. The results of the present study 
demonstrated that Sch A inhibited the viability of A549 and HCC827 cells. 
Furthermore, Sch A increased the intracellular Fe2+ level, reduced the 
mitochondrial membrane potential and depleted the glutathione content in lung 
cancer cells. These effects were reversed by the ferroptosis inhibitors 
ferrostatin‑1 and deferoxamine. Bioinformatics analysis and reverse 
transcription‑quantitative PCR results suggested that Sch A increased the mRNA 
levels of the transcription factor yes‑associated protein (YAP). Additionally, 
Sch A upregulated the expression of YAP and ferroptosis‑related proteins, 
including acyl‑CoA synthase long‑chain family member 4 (ACSL4) and transferrin 
receptor (TfR), in lung cancer cells. Silencing of YAP led to the downregulation 
of its downstream targets, ACSL4 and TfR, even in the presence of Sch A. In 
vivo, Sch A significantly inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth in nude mice. In 
conclusion, Sch A may activate the YAP/ACSL4/TfR signaling axis to induce 
ferroptosis in NSCLC cells, positioning it as a potential small‑molecule 
therapeutic agent for NSCLC.

Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a pivotal technique employed to assess the 
necessity for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), evaluated during the 
preoperative phase through clinical and radiological findings. The preoperative 
identification of sentinel lymph node metastasis has gained paramount importance 
in the surgical management of breast cancer. Tumor budding (TB) has emerged as a 
significant prognostic marker across various cancers, including breast cancer, 
where it is instrumental in detecting lymph node metastasis. This study aims to 
investigate the role of tumor budding in predicting sentinel lymph node 
metastasis in preoperative breast biopsies. We included patients diagnosed with 
breast cancer, specifically those with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), who 
underwent preoperative needle biopsy and subsequent evaluation of postoperative 
surgical specimens, as well as SLNB at our medical center. The histological 
slides of these cases were reevaluated, and tumor cell clusters comprising up to 
four cells were classified as TB. Lymph nodes exhibiting tumor cell involvement, 
limited to macrometastasis, were classified as positive. A total of 65 patients 
were enrolled in the study. Among these, 36 patients exhibited TB in their 
preoperative biopsies, while 29 did not. The median tumor sizes were 20 mm 
(range: 6-50 mm) in the TB-positive group and 19 mm (range: 2-50 mm) in the 
TB-negative group (p=0.3). Sentinel lymph node metastasis was detected in 18 
patients with TB, compared to only five patients without TB, a difference that 
was statistically significant (p=0.006). We conclude that evaluating tumor 
budding in breast tru-cut specimens, in conjunction with clinical and 
radiological findings, may enhance the preoperative assessment of breast cancer 
cases requiring SLNB.

Histone lactylation, a novel epigenetic modification, has emerged as a critical 
mediator of various physiological and pathological processes. The present review 
elucidates the molecular mechanisms of lysine lactylation (Kla) and its 
influence on gene expression modulation. In addition, previous findings 
regarding the mechanisms of Kla and its impact on metabolic regulation, 
inflammation and tumorigenesis are summarized. Histone lactylation influences 
macrophage polarization, promotes tumor immune evasion, and affects osteoblast 
differentiation and embryonic development. While promising as a therapeutic 
target, research progress is currently hindered by methodological limitations in 
terms of lactylation quantification and manipulation. The current review not 
only summarizes fundamental insights into Kla‑mediated disease pathogenesis but 
also critically addresses existing knowledge gaps. By highlighting the dynamic 
interplay between lactylation and metabolic regulation, novel perspectives are 
provided on the biological importance of this posttranslational modification. 
Ultimately, the aim of this review is to identify innovative approaches for 
targeting lactylation‑mediated pathways in disease treatment.

performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass 
spectrometry].

A method based on high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization 
tandem mass spectrometry （HPLC-ESI-MS/MS） was developed for the determination of 
the potential genotoxic impurity （WHT1408-Q2H） in the bulk drug of crizotinib. 
An Agilent Eclipse XDB C8 chromatographic column （150 mm×4.6 mm， 3.5 µm） was 
used for chromatographic separation. The mobile phases were 0.1% formic acid 
aqueous solution and 0.1% formic acid acetonitrile solution at a flow rate of 
0.4 mL/min. The column temperature was maintained at 40 ℃ and the sample size 
was 5 μL. In the mass spectrometry section， the electrospray positive ion （ESI+） 
mode with multiple reaction monitoring （MRM） scanning was adopted. The accurate 
mass of the ［M+H］+ parent ion of WHT1408-Q2H was m/z 205.3， and the accurate 
mass of the extracted fragment ion was m/z 121.0. The results of methodological 
validation demonstrated that the established method exhibited excellent 
specificity. The peak area and mass concentration of WHT1408-Q2H exhibited a 
good linear relationship within the range of 2-40 ng/mL， with a correlation 
coefficient （r） of 0.999 9. The limit of detection （LOD） and limit of 
quantitation （LOQ） for WHT1408-Q2H were 0.396 9 ng/mL and 1.984 6 ng/mL， 
respectively. The recoveries of WHT1408-Q2H at low， medium， and high levels were 
in the range of 95.6%-102.7%， while the relative standard deviations （RSDs） were 
between 0.4% and 0.7%. Finally， the proposed method was successfully applied to 
analyze three independent batches of the bulk drug of crizotinib. The results 
revealed that WHT1408-Q2H was not detected in all samples， indicating that the 
current production process can effectively control the content of this genotoxic 
impurity. In conclusion， the developed HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method is highly specific， 
sensitive， and simple， making it suitable for the stringent quality control of 
WHT1408-Q2H in the bulk drug of crizotinib. According to the M7 guideline on 
genotoxic impurities， this method is capable of accurately quantifying trace 
amounts of genotoxic impurities and will further ensure compliance with 
regulatory requirements and safeguard drug safety. Future applications may 
extend this analytical framework to similar genotoxic impurities assessment in 
other therapeutic compounds， thereby advancing the field of pharmaceutical 
impurity profiling and control.

ABSTRACT: In this study we aimed to uncover the perspectives of male childhood 
cancer survivors on parenthood, fertility preservation and potential fertility 
restoration using their own cryopreserved testicular biopsy. We invited all 
young men eligible for this study, 27 male cancer survivors over the age of 
sixteen who had undergone a testicular tissue biopsy in the past in Amsterdam, 
of whom 5 men (18.5% response rate) decided to participate. In semi-structured 
interviews, we discussed their views on parenthood, testicular cryopreservation 
and potential fertility restoration, specifically through spermatogonial stem 
cell transplantation (SSCT). All data were pseudonymized prior to analysis, via 
open coding using MAXQDA software. We found that all five participants (ages 
17-24) had actively thought about family planning and some expressed a very 
strong wish to experience parenthood, although they were aware of potential 
fertility issues related to their treatments. However, these participants 
reported that fertility issues had been minimally discussed at the late effects 
clinic during check-ups, and they therefore had a limited understanding of the 
potential and restrictions of fertility restoration techniques such as SSCT. 
Overall, these participants displayed a high willingness to undertake additional 
steps to achieve biological parenthood and low levels of concern regarding the 
safety of SSCT. Autonomy and the opportunity of choice were determining factors 
in their underlying views. Perspectives and needs of these survivors for whom a 
testicular biopsy was cryopreserved as a child predominantly revolved around the 
importance of having autonomy over their fertility choices and being adequately 
informed to make those choices.
LAY SUMMARY: Treatments for childhood cancer may lead to infertility. To 
safeguard fertility of male young cancer patients, a testicular biopsy can be 
frozen that contain Spermatogonial Stem Cells (SSCs), the basis for 
spermatogenesis. This study focused on SSCT: a new fertility restoration 
treatment. Through interviews with five male survivors (aged 17-24), we explored 
their experiences and opinions on fertility preservation and restoration. In 
general, participants were happy with their parents' decision to freeze a 
biopsy. The freedom to choose was a key topic for them. They were willing to 
take required steps to reach parenthood, if desired. They had few concerns about 
the safety of SSCT, but did have questions about chances of success. Their trust 
in science and healthcare was strong. However in their experience, fertility was 
not sufficiently discussed during follow-up care. The results support doctors, 
(former) childhood cancer patients, and their parents concerning fertility after 
childhood cancer.

AIM: To assess whether miRNA expression can be a biomarker for distinguishing 
between hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps and colon cancer tissues.
METHODS: The study involved 40 colon adenocarcinoma (CA) tissue samples, 40 
low-grade adenomatous (A) polyps, and 40 hyperplastic (HP) polyps. The samples 
were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Quantitative real-time polymerase 
chain reactions were used to determine the expression levels of miR-21, 
miR-200c, and miR-145.
RESULTS: miR-145 expression was significantly lower in the CA than in both the A 
and HP groups (P=0.012 and P=0.004, respectively) and in the A than in the HP 
group (P=0.028). miR-200c expression was higher in the CA than in the A 
(P=0.008) and HP groups (P=0.009), while no difference was observed between the 
A and HP groups (P=0.624). miR-21 showed a stepwise increase across the groups, 
with the highest levels in the CA, followed by the A and HP groups (P<0.001 for 
both CA vs A and CA vs HP; P=0.037 for A vs HP).
CONCLUSION: The study revealed dysregulated expression of miR-145 and miR-21 in 
colon polyps and cancer tissue, showing that these miRNAs may be used to 
distinguish between hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps and predict colorectal 
cancer.

BACKGROUND: Differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) in children and adolescents 
is a rare but increasingly recognised entity with distinct biological behaviour, 
clinical presentation, and outcomes compared to adult DTC. While paediatric 
cases often present with advanced disease, long-term survival is excellent, in 
contrast to adult cases where prognosis declines with age and risk factors. 
Historically, paediatric management was extrapolated from adult data, but recent 
guidelines reflect a shift toward age-specific, risk-adapted care.
OBJECTIVE: To compare paediatric and adult DTC across epidemiology, clinical 
presentation, molecular characteristics, treatment strategies, outcomes, and 
existing guidelines, with the aim to identify knowledge gaps for future 
harmonization.
METHODS: A narrative review was conducted using PubMed (2000-2025) including 
clinical trials, cohort studies, reviews, and guidelines.
FINDINGS: Paediatric DTC is characterized by higher rates of multifocal and 
metastatic disease at diagnosis, distinct molecular drivers (e.g., RET/NTRK 
fusions), and higher radioiodine avidity. Surgical management is typically more 
extensive in children, while risk-adapted radioactive iodine therapy is 
increasingly practiced in low-risk paediatric patients. TSH suppression is 
initially more aggressive, followed by gradual de-escalation. Despite higher 
recurrence rates in children, survival exceeds 95-98% even with distant 
metastases. While paediatric-specific guidelines have advanced (ATA 2015, ETA 
2022), prospective paediatric data remain limited.
CONCLUSIONS: Paediatric DTC is biologically distinct from its adult counterpart 
and requires tailored management. Coordinated, prospective research is needed to 
address current evidence gaps and support future harmonised European practice.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment but can 
induce immune-related adverse events, most commonly hypothyroidism. The 
reversibility of ICI-induced hypothyroidism and the potential for discontinuing 
levothyroxine (LT4) treatment remain unclear. This retrospective study analyzed 
patients who developed hypothyroidism due to ICI treatment and were prescribed 
LT4 at a tertiary referral hospital from January 2016 to March 2024. Among 3,753 
patients treated with ICIs, 254 (6.8%) developed hypothyroidism requiring LT4 
treatment. Of the 184 patients who discontinued ICI, only 10 (5.4%) discontinued 
LT4 during a median follow-up of 13.2 months, while none did among those 
continuing ICIs. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that the use of 
ICIs in early-stage (HR 13.40, 95% CI 1.99-90.06, p = 0.008) and TSH <20 μIU/mL 
before starting LT4 (HR 15.16, 95% CI 2.17-105.85, p = 0.006) significantly 
increased the likelihood of discontinuing LT4. These findings suggest that while 
recovery from ICI-induced hypothyroidism is uncommon, patients treated for 
early-stage cancer and those with lower TSH level before starting LT4 may have a 
greater likelihood of recovery.

We developed a novel bivalent albumin binder composed of two molecules of 
lysine-4-(p-iodophenyl)butyric acid, (Lys-IPBA)2, which markedly enhanced the 
tumor retention of a FAP-targeted radioligand compared to Lys-IPBA. The results 
suggest the promising potential of (Lys-IPBA)2 as a pharmacokinetic modifier of 
radioligands for cancer diagnosis and therapy.

The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) 
signaling pathway has emerged as a pivotal mediator of antitumor immunity, 
bridging innate and adaptive immune responses through its ability to sense 
cytoplasmic DNA and orchestrate cytokine production. This review comprehensively 
explores recent advancements in targeting this pathway for cancer immunotherapy, 
focusing on two key strategies: small-molecule agonists and nanomaterial-based 
therapeutics. Small-molecule agonists, including cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) 
derivatives and non-nucleotide compounds, have been engineered to overcome 
limitations such as enzymatic degradation and poor bioavailability. Candidates 
such as ADU-S100 and MSA-2 demonstrate enhanced STING activation and clinical 
potential. Concurrently, innovative nanoplatforms, which incorporate both 
inorganic materials, such as those based on manganese, zinc, or arsenic, and 
organic carriers, like liposomes, polymers, exosomes, and ferritin, leverage 
tumor microenvironment (TME)-responsive designs to amplify cGAS-STING signaling. 
These nanotherapeutics synergize DNA damage induction, immunogenic cell death, 
and immune checkpoint blockade to convert immunologically ""cold"" tumors into 
""hot"" phenotypes. Despite progress, challenges persist in balancing pathway 
activation efficacy with systemic toxicity, optimizing systemic delivery for 
metastatic tumors, and ensuring long-term biocompatibility. Future directions 
emphasize the development of smart nanocarriers with spatiotemporal control, 
biomarker-driven patient stratification, and combinatorial regimens that 
integrate epigenetic or metabolic modulators. This review underscores the 
transformative potential of cGAS-STING-targeted therapies while outlining 
critical hurdles and interdisciplinary strategies to advance precision cancer 
immunotherapy.

Cyclin-dependent kinase subunit 2 (CKS2) has been implicated in various 
malignancies. This study investigates the mechanism by which CKS2 contributes to 
bladder cancer (BC) progression. Abnormally expressed genes were identified by 
differential analysis of tumor and normal tissues using Gene Expression Omnibus 
datasets. Subsequently, functional assays - including cell proliferation, 
Transwell migration, colony formation, wound healing, flow cytometry, and 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays - were performed to provide cellular evidence 
supporting the oncogenic function of CKS2 in BC. The results demonstrated 
significantly elevated CKS2 expression in BC cells than in normal urothelial 
cells. CKS2 overexpression promoted cell proliferation, cell migration and 
invasion. Mechanistically, CKS2 overexpression caused a marked reduction in PTEN 
protein levels, thereby inhibiting PIP3 degradation and indirectly activating 
the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, CKS2 promoted phosphorylation and 
degradation of p27 Kip1 (Thr187), consequently contributing to cell cycle 
deregulation and further enhancing PI3K/AKT pathway activity. In contrast, CKS2 
knockdown produced the opposite effects. Notably, treatment with the PI3K 
inhibitor LY294002 effectively reversed CKS2-induced BC cell proliferation and 
metastasis. In conclusion, CKS2 promoted the malignant phenotypes of BC cells by 
enhancing PI3K/AKT pathway activity through dual mechanisms involving PTEN 
downregulation and p27 Kip1-mediated cell cycle dysregulation.

In clinical practice, patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) often exhibit limited tolerance to concurrent chemoradiotherapy 
(cCRT). This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy and safety of induction 
chemoimmunotherapy followed by definitive radiotherapy (RT) and consolidation 
immunotherapy, compared with standard cCRT plus consolidation immunotherapy. A 
total of 102 patients treated at West China Hospital between June 2019 and June 
2024 were analyzed. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included objective response 
rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and treatment-related adverse events 
(TRAEs). Survival outcomes were comparable between groups (median OS: not 
reached vs. 36 months, p = 0.52; median PFS: 25 vs. 28 months, p = 0.71), with 
higher 3-year OS observed in the induction group (61.4% vs. 38.3%). In the 
induction group, ORR after systemic therapy was 74.2%, and post-RT DCR reached 
83.3%. TRAEs were comparable across groups, with pneumonitis being the most 
frequent toxicity and no significant increase in grade ≥3 events observed. These 
findings support the induction-based sequential strategy as a viable alternative 
to cCRT for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, especially those 
unsuitable for concurrent treatment.

The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials such as MXenes has 
significantly expanded opportunities in precision oncology. With their high 
surface area, tunable surface chemistry, strong photothermal conversion 
efficiency, and intrinsic biocompatibility, MXenes offer promising potential for 
cancer nanotheranostics. This review explores the therapeutic applications of 
MXenes, focusing on their dual roles in direct tumor ablation and modulation of 
the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). MXenes exert anticancer effects 
through reactive oxygen species-mediated cytotoxicity and localized photothermal 
heating while also influencing immune cell function and tumor-immune 
interactions. Recent studies using single-cell sequencing and high-dimensional 
immune profiling highlight the capacity of MXenes to modulate immune-mediated 
tumor cell death. Their selective reactivity in the acidic tumor milieu, linked 
to the Warburg effect, makes them ideal candidates for pH-responsive drug 
delivery. We further discuss synergistic strategies combining MXene-based 
photothermal therapy with chemotherapy, targeted agents, and immunotherapies. 
Advancing MXene-based cancer therapies requires an integrated understanding of 
tumor biology, metabolic reprogramming, and TIME dynamics. This 
multidisciplinary approach is essential for the development of safe, selective, 
and personalized nanomedicine platforms.

As well-known nanocarriers for systemically injectable drug delivery systems, 
lipid-based polymeric micelles show potency for improving cancer treatment. 
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is commonly used as a component of polymeric micelles 
owing to its biocompatibility but can cause immunogenic side reactions, which 
highlights the need for non-PEG-based systems for the delivery of therapeutic 
agents. To address this need, we herein synthesized a 
poly(N-{N'-[N″-(2-carboxyethyl)-2-aminoethyl]-2-aminoethyl}glutamide) 
[PGlu(DET-Car)]-lipid conjugate, prepared polymeric micelles with PGlu(DET-Car) 
surfaces, and investigated their physicochemical characteristics and in vivo 
performance. The micelles showed acidic pH-induced cellular uptake and endosomal 
escape behaviors superior to those of their PEG-based counterparts and elicited 
negligible immune responses, as revealed by antibody and cytokine production 
measurements. Thus, PGlu(DET-Car) presents itself as a viable alternative to 
PEG-based micelles a as smart drug carrier with specific sensitivity toward a 
narrow tumorous pH window and minimized immune reactions.

The relentless surge in the demand for novel materials has driven the 
development of innovative fabrication methodologies that are motivated by 
minimized energy utilization and sustainable chemical processing as researchers 
are increasingly compelled to adopt more environmentally benign fabrication 
methods. To align with the principles of green chemistry, microwave-assisted 
synthesis (MAS) has been marked as one of the well-established technologies in 
various research fields. This review emphasizes on the MAS of nanomaterials 
(NMs) while concentrating on its biomedical applications. In this perspective, 
we delve into the basis of the MAS of NMs while highlighting the mechanism of 
heating involved in MAS. Compared with the existing reviews in this field, this 
review aims to offer a comprehensive analysis of the regulatory parameters, such 
as the choice of solvent, frequency, power, and irradiation time in designing 
the MAS of NMs. This review argues for a multidimensional property assessment on 
the selection of NMs and MAS-linked parameters to establish the targeted 
biomedical applications, such as cancer therapy, drug delivery, and tissue 
engineering (2019-2025), which is unique to this review compared with the 
existing ones. Finally, this review spotlights some key factors to be considered 
to increase the yield, purity, and efficiency of NMs fabricated via MAS. This 
perspective is aimed at offering a critical analysis of MAS and its utilization 
to supplement the synthesis of green and sustainable materials.

Ovarian cancer is one of the most malignant tumors in women. Long noncoding RNAs 
have been demonstrated to regulate multiple biological processes, including cell 
proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and drug resistance, in various cancers. 
Small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) host genes (SNHGs) are a group of long noncoding 
RNAs. Studies have reported that SNHGs are aberrantly expressed in many kinds of 
cancers and are associated with poor patient prognosis. In ovarian cancer, SNHGs 
play critical roles in the development and progression of ovarian cancer via 
different pathways. However, there is a lack of systematic reports on the 
research progress of SNHGs in ovarian cancer. Therefore, we reviewed the studies 
on the roles of SNHGs in the early diagnosis, development, and treatment of 
ovarian cancer and explored the underlying mechanisms to provide new insights

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive tumor subtype that is 
resistant to conventional therapies due to the lack of targetable receptors. In 
this study, a paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded Mo2C@C@Fuc/Mo2C-MXene@Fuc hybrid 
nanosystem was developed, and the efficacy of a combined therapeutic approach, 
photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), and chemotherapy (CT) 
was evaluated in vitro and in vivo against TNBC. The 
PTX/Mo2C@C@Fuc/Mo2C-MXene@Fuc hybrid nanosystem exhibited high drug loading 
efficiency and stimuli-responsive release. At 96 h, PTX release reached 58.6% at 
pH 4.5 and 44.2% at pH 6.0, while NIR irradiation further enhanced the release 
to 66.3% and 51.0%, respectively, confirming the pH- and light-responsive drug 
delivery capability of the system. Under NIR irradiation (808 nm), the hybrid 
structure generated significant levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading 
to pronounced apoptotic induction and reducing cell viability to 52.8% in 4T1 
cells. Similarly, in MDA-MB-231 cells, NIR-assisted combination treatment 
decreased viability to 55.9%. In contrast, L929 normal fibroblast cells retained 
a viability of 75.4% under the same treatment conditions, indicating 
cytotoxicity. Tube formation assay results demonstrated that the hybrid system 
significantly inhibited vascular structure formation in HUVEC cells after 24 h 
of incubation. In vivo studies further confirmed that the PTX-loaded hybrid 
system combined with NIR irradiation induced 82% necrosis and 12.5% apoptosis 
within tumor tissues, ultimately resulting in complete macroscopic tumor 
regression. Overall, this study highlights the potential of Mo2C-MXene-based 
hybrid nanostructures as a biocompatible and therapeutic platform for 
synergistic PDT/PTT/CT combination therapy in TNBC treatment.

The construction of nano-drug carriers based on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has 
demonstrated significant therapeutic potential. Similarly, supramolecular 
therapeutic systems utilizing host-guest interactions have emerged as promising 
in nanomedicine. Building upon these approaches, we designed a 
size-controllable, multi-responsive supramolecular DNA nanogel (SDN) based on 
host-guest recognition for dual-drug co-delivery in cancer combination therapy. 
The nanogel incorporates doxorubicin (DOX, a chemotherapeutic agent) and 
methylene blue (MB, a photosensitizer). The assembly of SDN is driven by 
cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]), which selectively binds two MB molecules-one from each 
of two Y-shaped DNA building blocks-forming a 1 : 2 host-guest complex that 
crosslinks the structures into a nanogel network. Meanwhile, the double-stranded 
DNA scaffold efficiently encapsulates DOX via intercalation, enabling SDN@DOX to 
co-deliver both drugs in a precisely controlled ratio. Notably, MB's 
photodynamic activity is initially suppressed upon CB[8] binding. However, upon 
cellular uptake, SDN@DOX responds to overexpressed spermine or specific peptide 
sequences in the tumor microenvironment, triggering MB release and restoring its 
photodynamic function. Concurrently, DNase I-mediated DNA degradation liberates 
DOX, enabling synergistic chemo-photodynamic therapy (PDT). In vitro studies 
confirmed that SDN@DOX enhances reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in 
cancer cells and achieves superior therapeutic efficacy through combined PDT and 
chemotherapy. This stimuli-responsive, dual-drug delivery system offers a 
potentially robust and controllable platform for precision cancer treatment.

Accurately predicting the future cancer status of prostate cancer patients is 
critical for treatment. Studies show a strong link between prostate cancer and 
genetic mutations. To better predict a patient's cancer status and identify key 
mutated genes during metastasis, we propose a convolutional network with 
parallel structure (CNPS). Our approach includes a mutation data preprocessing 
method for easier feature extraction, followed by parallel convolutional 
networks to capture gene mutation features across multiple dimensions for more 
accurate predictions. Finally, CNPS is highly interpretable, allowing us to 
identify key genes involved in metastatic prostate cancer. After training, CNPS 
achieves higher accuracy on both the MPC and MSK-MET datasets.

In cancer combination therapy, micro-robot systems that integrate multiple 
therapeutic functions have emerged as a key direction for overcoming the 
limitations of traditional treatments. This study proposes a magnetic 
thermosensitive hydrogel capsule micro-robot that combines both drug-targeted 
delivery within blood vessels and local magnetic hyperthermia therapy. By 
introducing acrylamide and sodium alginate to modify the poly(N-isopropyl 
acrylamide) hydrogel system, the thermal response characteristics and 
drug-loading capacity of the micro-robot carrier are optimized. A multi-coaxial 
co-flow microfluidic chip is employed to achieve the directed encapsulation of 
Fe3O4 nanoparticles and the rapid, controlled preparation of single-core and 
core-shell structured spherical micro-robots. The core-shell structure enables 
the simultaneous loading of hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. Under the 
influence of a high-frequency alternating magnetic field, the local temperature 
around the micro-robot increased from 21 °C to 42 °C within 4 minutes, 
successfully triggering the phase transition contraction of the hydrogel and 
releasing the drug while also reaching the temperature threshold for thermal 
therapy. Additionally, this study established a visual feedback, magnetically 
driven system, with the micro-robot achieving a maximum movement speed of 3.47 
mm s-1 under a magnetic field strength of 7.4 mT, thereby realizing 
millimeter-level positioning accuracy and complex curve trajectory tracking in 
vascular microchannels that simulate a blood environment. Experimental results 
indicate that the prepared multimodal hydrogel capsule microrobots possess 
excellent targeted movement capabilities, meeting the functional requirements 
for a synergistic ""thermotherapy-chemotherapy"" treatment, and demonstrate 
potential application in the development of low-toxicity, high-efficiency tumor 
combination therapy.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in 
women, with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) being an aggressive subtype 
associated with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. TNBC is known for 
its immunogenic characteristics, including high genetic instability and elevated 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have 
shown efficacy in TNBC treatment, but the optimal treatment duration in case of 
prolonged response remains unclear.
CASE: This case series here reported presents two patients with metastatic TNBC 
who demonstrated an excellent response to ICI therapy. The first patient, a 
60-year-old, was enrolled in a Phase I clinical trial and received a combination 
of anti-PD-1, anti-LAG-3, and anti-CSF-1 monoclonal antibodies. The second 
patient, a 45-year-old with BRCA1-mutated TNBC, participated in a Phase II trial 
and received a combination of avelumab (anti-PD-L1) and talazoparib (PARP 
inhibitor). Both patients achieved a complete radiological response (CR), which 
has been maintained for 5 years. A literature review performed here identified 
seven additional long-term ICI responders in metastatic TNBC. While ICIs showed 
significant efficacy in some patients, variability in PD-L1 expression and TILs 
suggests that other factors may influence response. Two patients in previous 
studies discontinued ICIs after 2 years without progression, prompting questions 
about the optimal treatment duration.
CONCLUSION: ICIs optimal treatment duration remains uncertain. Literature on 
metastatic melanoma suggests that discontinuing ICIs after a complete response 
rarely leads to recurrence. Prospective studies and emerging biomarkers, such as 
circulating tumor DNA, may help tailor treatment decisions.

Early precise cancer detection is vital for improving patient outcomes, yet 
current diagnostic methods often fall short, particularly in enabling continuous 
and minimally invasive monitoring. Conventional techniques, including tissue 
biopsy and medical imaging techniques, are hindered by high costs, and limited 
real-time capabilities. In contrast, microneedle-based biosensors offer a 
wearable and non-invasive alternative, accessing body fluid to detect cancer 
biomarkers effectively. These microneedles can monitor physiological parameters 
and rare chemical analytes, paving the way for advanced point-of-care 
diagnostics and early intervention. This review examines the materials and 
fabrication strategies employed in microneedle development, such as polymers, 
metals, and various manufacturing methods like micromolding, photolithography, 
and 3D printing. This work also explores key signal readout techniques, focusing 
on optical and electrochemical approaches optimized for cancer biomarker 
detection. By enabling multiplexed analysis and continuous monitoring, 
microneedles present a versatile and precise diagnostic platform. Finally, this 
work discusses current limitations and propose directions for future research to 
enhance their clinical impact, underscoring the transformative potential of 
microneedle technology in cancer diagnostics as an example of the potential for 
microneedles in early diagnostics.

This study presents the development of an electrochemical aptasensor for the 
detection of cancer antigen 125 (CA 125), an important biomarker for ovarian 
cancer. The aptasensor was developed based on a nanocomposite of copper 
nanoparticles (CuNPs) decorated on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) by direct 
current (DC) magnetron sputtering. This design enhances electron transfer and 
provides a large surface area for immobilization of the aptamer. The CA 
125-specific aptamer was covalently conjugated to the modified electrode, 
allowing for selective and label-free detection. Differential pulse voltammetry 
was used to record the electrochemical signal. Oxidation of the CuNPs generates 
an electrochemical signal, while immobilization of the aptamer and subsequent 
incubation with CA 125 lead to a considerable decrease in this response. The 
variation in the oxidation peak current of CuNPs, observed with and without CA 
125, serves as a reliable analytical signal for the quantification of CA 125 
concentration. The proposed aptasensor demonstrates a wide linear concentration 
range (0.1-400.0 U mL-1) for CA 125 detection, with a low detection limit of 1.6 
× 10-2 U mL-1. Furthermore, the aptasensor exhibited excellent applicability in 
both patient and healthy human serum samples, making it a promising tool for 
early cancer diagnosis and point-of-care testing.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains a therapeutic challenge due to its 
aggressive nature, limited treatment options, and propensity for developing 
multidrug resistance (MDR). To overcome these limitations, a novel 
micelles-in-lipopolymersome nanocarrier system is developed herein for targeted 
drug delivery. Specifically, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted 
EGF peptide is conjugated to 
1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethylene 
glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG-NH2) and subsequently incorporated into micelles, which 
significantly reduces the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and enhances the 
structural stability. The paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded micelles (designated 
Micelle@PTX) exhibit pronounced pH-sensitive behavior, being less stable under 
acidic conditions, thereby facilitating rapid drug release in a tumor-like 
microenvironment. To further improve its stability and control the drug release, 
Micelle@PTX is encapsulated within lipopolymersomes to obtain Lipo-Micelle@PTX 
particles with sizes ranging from 120 to 150 nm. Notably, the as-fabricated 
system effectively co-delivers hydrophobic PTX and hydrophilic irinotecan 
(CPT-11), thereby illustrating its versatility for combination chemotherapy. In 
vitro release experiments demonstrate that both PTX and CPT-11 are released more 
rapidly at pH 6.5 than at pH 7.4. Cellular uptake studies, supported by confocal 
microscopy and FACS analysis, reveal enhanced internalization of the 
EGFR-targeted nanocarriers in drug-resistant BT-20 LUC/MDR cells, thus resulting 
in improved cytotoxicity compared to free PTX. Preliminary in vivo studies 
further demonstrate that Lipo-Micelle@PTX significantly inhibits tumor growth 
compared to PTX alone, without inducing detectable systemic or organ toxicity. 
This study presents a promising platform for overcoming drug resistance in TNBC, 
with potential implications for targeted cancer therapy and improved clinical 
outcomes.

Dietary acid load (DAL) may be a risk factor for chronic diseases, but evidence 
of its potential effects on frailty in older adults with lung cancer is lacking. 
This cross-sectional study explored the association between DAL and frailty in 
older adults with lung cancer. Frailty status was assessed using the Fried 
frailty criteria. Dietary intake was assessed in 262 patients with a 3-day, 24 h 
dietary recall, followed by the DAL assessment with both the potential renal 
acid load (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP) scores. Among all 
participants, 104 (39.7%) patients were classified as frail. Compared with the 
non-frail patients, the frail patients had significantly lower intakes of 
protein, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium and higher NEAP scores 
(all P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that after fully adjusting 
for covariates, high NEAP scores were associated with an increased risk of 
frailty (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01-1.05, P = 0.002), whereas a high protein 
intake was associated with a reduced risk (OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.95-0.99, P = 
0.013). Restricted cubic spline analysis showed a significant inverse nonlinear 
association between potassium intake and frailty (P = 0.017), with the frailty 
risk decreasing at intake levels of 1500-2000 mg d-1 and increasing markedly 
below 669.2 mg d-1. No association was found between PRAL and frailty after 
adjustment (P > 0.05). Overall, high NEAP scores and low intakes of protein and 
potassium were significantly associated with increased risk of frailty among 
older adults with lung cancer, supporting the potential role of diet in frailty 
intervention.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer remains a major public health burden in South Africa, 
with diagnostic delays contributing to poor outcomes. Ultrasound is effective 
for early detection but is limited by access and operator variability. 
Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) 
offers a potential solution.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a locally developed 
AI-enabled POCUS system (Breast AI) in predicting malignancy among women with 
palpable breast abnormalities.
METHOD: A prospective cohort study was conducted between June 2024 and November 
2024 at Groote Schuur Hospital. Women aged ≥ 25 years with suspicious breast 
lesions underwent Breast AI ultrasound prior to biopsy. Real-time malignancy 
risk scores were compared with histopathological results. Diagnostic accuracy 
was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), F1 
score and area under the curve (AUC).
RESULTS: Among 159 participants, Breast AI achieved a sensitivity of 67.2%, 
specificity of 79.4% and PPV of 70.3% at a 51% threshold. The AUC was 0.76, 
reflecting moderate discriminatory performance. F1 score analysis identified 51% 
as the optimal cut-off (F1 = 65.7%). Benign pathologies such as fibroadenomas 
and fat necrosis correlated with low AI scores. A three-tiered risk model was 
developed: < 30% (low), 30% - 51% (intermediate) and > 51% (high risk).
CONCLUSION: Breast AI demonstrates promising diagnostic accuracy for triaging 
suspicious breast lesions, particularly in resource-constrained settings.
CONTRIBUTION: This study provides real-world evidence supporting the integration 
of AI into POCUS to improve breast cancer detection and clinical decision-making 
in low-resource environments.

BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is considered an aggressive 
subtype, defined by the absence of oestrogen, progesterone and HER2 receptors. 
It typically presents earlier and more aggressively. Limited data exist on its 
prevalence, age of onset and imaging features in South Africa.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the prevalence of TNBC at Helen Joseph 
Tertiary Hospital (HJTH), describe its histopathological features and explore 
trends in age at diagnosis and imaging patterns-including early-onset disease.
METHOD: A retrospective review of 280 female patients with histologically 
confirmed breast cancer, diagnosed between January 2021 and December 2023, was 
conducted. Demographic, imaging and histopathology data were analysed using 
descriptive statistics and chi-square tests.
RESULTS: The diagnosis of TNBC accounted for 17% (48/280) of all breast cancer 
cases in the cohort. The TNBC lesions typically measured 1-5 cm and showed nodal 
involvement in 73% of cases. Despite their aggressive biology, many TNBC lesions 
appeared circumscribed or only mildly irregular on imaging, mimicking benign 
masses. Among all the 280 breast cancer cases, 61% were high-grade. The mean 
Ki-67 index for TNBC was the highest at 52%, followed by HER2+ (39%), Luminal B 
(33%) and Luminal A (21%). Notably, some HER2+ and TNBC cases exhibited lower 
Ki-67 indices, highlighting heterogeneity within these subtypes.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the complexity of breast cancer presentation 
in a South African setting, particularly the discordance between tumour biology 
and imaging.
CONTRIBUTION: These findings contribute local data on TNBC in an urban public 
healthcare context, supporting improved imaging awareness and clinical vigilance 
in resource-limited settings.

INTRODUCTION: Advance care planning (ACP) facilitates patients' preferences for 
future treatment. It has been associated with improved quality of end-of-life 
care. While several factors contribute to ACP implementation, little is known 
about the specific components involved. This scoping review aimed to identify 
and explore components of ACP, including knowledge, attitudes, values and 
beliefs, cultural and ethnic factors in patients with cancer and their families.
METHODS: The scoping review followed the updated Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) 2020 checklist. 
A search was conducted in the PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct databases until 
December 2023, and the selected articles were assessed using the Joanna Briggs 
Critical Appraisal Tool (MMAT).
RESULTS: This scoping review included 42 studies. The included studies were 
grouped by design: quantitative (n=12), qualitative (n=15), and mixed methods 
(n=15). Key ACP components identified included knowledge and perceptions (n=28), 
attitudes and behaviours (n=33), values and beliefs (n=26), and cultural and 
ethnic aspects (n=13).
CONCLUSION: This review provides a summary of the crucial components including 
knowledge and perception, attitudes and behaviors, values and beliefs, and 
cultural and ethnic perspectives to consider when implementing ACP for patients 
with cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC), as a leading cause of cancer-related 
morbidity and mortality worldwide, often requires surgical interventions such as 
colostomy, which can substantially affect patients' health-related quality of 
life. The presence of a colostomy adversely affects deferent aspects of 
patient's life. The aim of this study is to compare the health-related quality 
of life in patients with and without a colostomy.
METHODS: In this comparative cross-sectional study, 256 patients with CRC were 
included through convenience sampling, comprising 127 patients with a colostomy 
(49.6%) and 129 without a colostomy (50.4%). The data collection tools included 
the demographic information form and the shortened form of the health-related 
quality of life questionnaire (SF-36). Statistical analyses were performed using 
IBM SPSS Statistics version 13, including descriptive statistics, independent 
samples t-tests, general linear modeling, and multiple regression analyses. 
Results: In this study, the health-related quality of life score (range: 0-100) 
was 43.03±17.08 in patients with a colostomy and 51.38±15.57 in those without a 
colostomy. Also, there was a statistically significant difference in physical 
functioning, role limitation due to physical health, role limitation due to 
emotional problems and health-related quality of life in people with and without 
colostomies (P<0.05). Finally, in sex stratified exploratory analyses, 
differences were evident among women but not among men.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that patients with CRC, particularly those 
with a colostomy, experience significantly lower health-related quality of life. 
The findings emphasize the importance of early and targeted interventions to 
improve physical and psychosocial well-being in this population. Greater 
attention should be given to the needs of patients with colostomy in both 
hospital and community care settings to enhance their overall quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Palliative care units and specialised palliative home care teams are 
well established in many countries. Palliative day-care clinics, however, are 
not. Studies assessing which patients benefit from this setting of care are 
rare.
AIM: This is the first routine data analysis of patients treated in three 
settings of specialised palliative care within a single geographical region. Our 
aim was to gain understanding of how patients in this region, where specialised 
palliative care structures are well-established, differ in their characteristics 
and treatments, and to explore the potential role of a palliative day-care 
clinic.
DESIGN: Retrospective data were extracted from medical records and analysed 
using SPSS® and R®. Data were analysed using the Shapiro-Wilk, Chi-Square, and 
Kruskal-Wallis tests. Setting/Participants: Patients (n = 603) were included if 
they received treatment at either a palliative day-care clinic, a palliative 
care unit, or a specialised palliative home care service. To cover the ""normal"" 
pre-pandemic period, the analysis was conducted retrospectively from 31 December 
2019.
RESULTS: Patients attending the palliative day-care clinic were more likely to 
have cancer (90%, P < .001), were younger than those receiving specialised 
palliative home care (66.1, P < .001), had a better ECOG performance status (2, 
P < .001) and fewer high-complexity symptom domains (3.4, P < .001). Patients in 
the palliative day-care clinic and the palliative care unit underwent similar 
numbers of medical procedures and interventions. The majority of patients were 
admitted to the palliative day-care clinic from home (76%, P < .001) and 
discharged to the palliative care unit (41.5%, P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The three care models differ in their patient populations, 
time-based criteria and symptom burden-with the palliative day-care clinic 
treating younger patients at earlier stages of the disease, with a lower ECOG 
score and a less complex symptom burden. These variations emphasise the 
importance of tailoring palliative care to the needs of patients and the 
progression of their disease. Recognising these differences can enhance 
integrated care pathways and patient-centred outcomes in various settings.

BACKGROUND: Critical illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases, stroke, cancer 
etc., are known to cause heavy financial burden for the patient and their 
caregivers despite having insurance coverage and high out-of-pocket expenditure 
(OPE) is still incurred due to the poor knowledge and awareness regarding the 
type of policy. The present study aims to evaluate the OPE of critical care 
insured patients admitted in a tertiary care hospital.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted at Kasturba Hospital, Manipal 
from September 2020 to September 2022, among patients with eight critical 
illness admitted under selected health insurance (HI), and this study was 
cross-sectional in nature.
RESULTS: Results depicted that 98.8% of the patients incurred OPE (22.6% 
incurred a high OPE of >Rs. 50,000). 24.3% of the total bill was paid as OPE. 
The overall median OPE was Rs 14,160 [Inter Quartile Range (IQR)-Rs. 
5728.5-42506], but the difference in median OPE among government and private HI 
was not statistically significant. Increased duration of stay in hospital and 
prolonged stay in intensive care unit (ICU) were associated with an OPE of >Rs. 
50,000 (Rs = Indian National Rupees).
CONCLUSION: Prolonged duration of admission and prolonged stay in ICU were found 
to be associated with an out-of-pocket expenditure of >Rs. 50,000. There is a 
need to create awareness among public regarding the different clauses of a HI 
policy (inclusions, exclusions, top up facility, co-payment option, deductibles, 
limits, riders etc.) before they enroll into any policy.

BACKGROUND: Leukemia, a heterogeneous group of blood cancers, poses significant 
challenges to global health due to its complexity, diverse risk factors, and 
variable outcomes. Accurate and early diagnosis is critical but remains a 
significant hurdle, particularly in low-resource settings. Recent advancements 
in artificial intelligence (AI) and image processing offer transformative 
solutions to improve leukemia detection and classification, addressing 
limitations in traditional diagnostic methods.
METHODS: This study systematically reviewed over 25,000 scientific articles 
sourced from Scopus, employing a PRISMA-guided methodology to ensure a 
comprehensive and rigorous analysis. The analysis focused on the application of 
AI, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in diagnosing four 
primary leukemia types: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic myeloid leukemia 
(CML). It also examined global epidemiological trends, risk factors, and 
disparities in healthcare access.
RESULTS: Key risk factors for leukemia include genetic syndromes like Down 
syndrome, environmental exposures to toxins such as benzene, ionizing radiation, 
and viral infections. Socio-economic disparities and geographical differences 
significantly impact leukemia incidence and outcomes. AI-based models, 
especially CNNs, demonstrated enhanced accuracy, speed, and reliability in 
diagnosing leukemia compared to traditional methods. However, challenges such as 
data variability, model scalability, and unequal access to AI technologies 
continue to hinder widespread adoption.
CONCLUSION: AI and image processing technologies hold immense potential to 
revolutionize leukemia diagnostics by enabling early detection, precise 
classification, and personalized treatment planning. Addressing critical 
challenges, including data standardization and equitable access to these 
technologies, will be vital for global application. This review highlights the 
transformative role of AI in improving leukemia outcomes and advancing precision 
medicine worldwide.

Introduction Post-orchiectomy testicular prosthesis (TP) implantation is offered 
to patients to minimize psychological distress. Sexual dysfunction, negative 
body image perception, and fertility outcomes are well addressed in the 
literature; however, little is known about the impact of TP on sexual life. 
Methods This is a retrospective, single-center cohort study conducted at Hôpital 
Universitaire de Bruxelles. Patients with TP completed a questionnaire exploring 
body image perception, reasons for TP acceptance, overall satisfaction, and both 
short- and long-term impacts on their sexual life and quality of life. 
Statistical analyses using the Chi-square and Wilcoxon tests were performed to 
correlate TP satisfaction with patients' characteristics, sexual dysfunction, 
fertility, and interpersonal or professional stability. Results Sixty patients 
were included between 2000 and 2021, with a median follow-up of 6.2 years 
(range: 3.4-11.7). The mean age at orchiectomy was 32 years (range: 17-49). 
During this period, 10 (17%) patients required testosterone supplementation, 10 
(18%) developed depression, 17 (31%) changed their profession, 9 (16%) separated 
from their partner, and 15 (30%) fathered at least one child. Weight gain was 
observed in 40 (67%) patients. Forty-eight (80%) patients were satisfied with 
their TP. However, 24 (40%) felt it was too high, 31 (52%) too firm, and 12 
(20%) too large. There was no significant impact on overall sexual performance 
(p > 0.05), although erectile dysfunction was significantly associated with 
dissatisfaction with the prosthesis (p = 0.01). Conclusions Overall TP 
satisfaction was high, with no negative impact on patients' sexual life or 
quality of life. Patients who were dissatisfied with the TP were predominantly 
those who experienced erectile dysfunction.

Background This study aims to present a simple and reliable way to study the 
dosimetric impact of the Acuros XB (AXB) algorithm compared to the Anisotropic 
Analytical Algorithm (AAA). Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans for 
lung cancer treatments were studied when changing the planning target volume 
(PTV) margins, positions, and interface distances. Methodology Three PTV 
positions were studied: near an air/tissue interface (PTVint), at the upper lobe 
surrounded by air (PTVair), and at the mediastinum (PTVtis). For the PTV near 
the interface, four VMAT plans were created, expanding the PTV margin and 
reducing the air/tissue interface distance at the same time. The margins were 
set to 0.5 cm, 0.7 cm, 1 cm, and 1.5 cm from the gross target volume (GTV). 
Differences in dose distributions between AXB and AAA occurred in all PTVs, with 
the maximum differences seen in PTVs including more air volume. Results For 
PTVtis, the two algorithms presented similar behavior. Specifically, for PTV 
mean dose (Dmean), AXB showed lower values of -2.3%, while for PTVair and 
PTVint, the mean corresponding differences were -18.2% and -10.1%. Concerning 
the mean lung doses (MLDs), AXB showed lower MLD than AAA for most PTVs, with 
differences ranging from -5.5% to -13.2%. For the expanding PTVs, MLD increased 
similarly for the two algorithms, i.e., 2.5 Gy to 4.9 Gy for AAA and 2.2 Gy to 
4.4 Gy for AXB (for margins 0.5 cm to 1.5 cm). AAA overestimated the dose to the 
spine for most PTVs, with mean differences ranging from 4.7% to 15%. Conformity 
(CI) and Homogeneity indices (HI) also presented differences, with AAA plans 
showing higher PTV conformity, i.e., CI near unity, while CI values of AXB plans 
ranged from 0.27 to 0.94. Additionally, AAA plans were more homogeneous, with HI 
values ranging from 7.0 to 9.6, while HI values of AXB plans ranged from 19.1 to 
24.9. Conclusions For lung cancer treatments, the PTV position, PTV margin, 
interface distance, and algorithm implemented can affect the dose calculation 
accuracy. Therefore, attention is required to avoid PTV underdosing or normal 
tissue toxicity. The simple-to-apply method presented here could be clinically 
applied and proven useful for that analysis. The two main limitations of the 
present study are the limited sample size and the fact that all plans were 
recalculated with AXB, keeping the same optimization objectives as AAA. Thus, 
the results should be interpreted with caution in clinical application.

An ectopic ureter is a rare male anomaly. We report a case of robot-assisted 
radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in a patient with an ectopic ureter 
and a duplicated collecting system. A 71-year-old man was diagnosed with 
prostate cancer. Preoperative evaluation identified a left ectopic ureter 
opening into the bladder neck. During robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, an 
attempt to preserve the ectopic orifice resulted in an extensive positive 
surgical margin. The patient subsequently developed biochemical recurrence and 
was treated with androgen deprivation therapy and salvage radiotherapy. His 
prostate-specific antigen level is now undetectable. Preoperative diagnosis of 
an ectopic ureter is crucial for surgical planning to avoid positive margins and 
complications. This anomaly should be considered if an unexpected tubular 
structure is encountered intraoperatively or if unexpected urinary leakage 
occurs postoperatively.

A man in his 60s presented with subacute weakness of his lower limbs, numbness, 
and urinary retention, preceded by fever a few weeks back. Nerve conduction 
studies showed demyelinating parameters, and magnetic resonance imaging showed 
long-segment cord T2/STIR hyperintensities and multifocal lesions in the brain. 
CSF showed albuminocytologic dissociation. Despite immunotherapy with 
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), symptoms progressed. A PET-CT scan revealed 
thoracic oesophageal malignancy with lymphatic spread, confirmed on biopsy as an 
undifferentiated carcinoma. The case was diagnosed as paraneoplastic 
demyelination involving both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The 
patient later developed pulmonary thromboembolism. This case highlights 
simultaneous central and peripheral demyelination as a paraneoplastic 
manifestation and underscores the need for malignancy screening in demyelinating 
syndromes unresponsive to standard immunotherapies.

Bladder cancer, particularly urothelial carcinoma, is the most common malignancy 
of the urinary tract and is associated with several risk factors, including 
smoking, advanced age, and exposure to environmental toxins. Angelman syndrome 
is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a defect in the UBE3A gene, 
leading to characteristic neurological and behavioral manifestations. Although 
no clear association exists between these two conditions, we report a case of a 
36-year-old man with Angelman syndrome who developed urothelial carcinoma of the 
urinary bladder despite the absence of identifiable risk factors or a family 
history of urothelial cancer, followed by two subsequent recurrences.

Background Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a serious and potentially fatal 
complication in lung cancer patients. This study aims to identify predictors of 
recurrent PE and related mortality in this population. Methods A retrospective 
review was conducted using electronic medical records from King Abdulaziz 
Medical Cities in Riyadh and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Lung cancer patients with 
confirmed initial PE were included. Data on demographics, clinical features, and 
laboratory values-including Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status, systemic infections, serum albumin, and D-dimer levels-were 
collected. PE and its recurrence were confirmed by standard imaging techniques. 
The statistical analyses comprised descriptive statistics, analysis of the 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to establish the optimum cutoff 
values of the biomarkers, and logistic regression to identify predictors of PE 
recurrence and mortality. Results A total of 98 adult lung cancer patients with 
initial PE were identified. Of these, 19 (19.4%) experienced recurrent PE, with 
a mortality rate of 73.7% in this group. Recurrent PE was significantly 
associated with poor ECOG performance status and systemic infections. Laboratory 
findings showed that recurrent cases had lower serum albumin (≤ 20.5 mg/L) and 
higher D-dimer (≥ 6.5 mg/L) levels. Logistic regression revealed that 
adenocarcinoma type, systemic infection, elevated D-dimer, and low albumin were 
significant predictors of PE recurrence. Mortality was higher in the recurrence 
group compared to non-recurrence (73.7% vs. 44.3%, p = 0.021). Conclusion 
Recurrent PE occurs in 19.4% of lung cancer patients with initial PE and carries 
high mortality. Identified predictors warrant validation in larger studies.

Adenosine A3 Receptor and Its Potential Role in Cancer Treatment: A Narrative 
Review.

Found in all human cells, the purine nucleoside adenosine plays various roles in 
different metabolic pathways. Adenosine is not stored in vesicles but is 
released continuously, based on metabolic demands. Essential in energy 
production, adenosine is a full agonist at four known receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, 
and A3), and is produced either intracellularly or in the extracellular space. 
Adenosine is the building block for adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a vasodilator 
that inhibits certain cerebral neurotransmissions. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) 
releases energy via its phosphate bonds and can ""recharge"" by adding phosphate 
groups later on, unlike ATP. The A3 receptors are most densely expressed in 
humans in the liver, lungs, immune cells, heart, and brain, and A3 agonists 
confer cytoprotection, making A3 agonists an intriguing potential anticancer 
drug. A3 receptors are so highly expressed in cancer cells and tumors that they 
serve as cancer biomarkers. To date, A3 agonists and A2A antagonists have 
emerged as potential anticancer drugs. Paradoxically, A3 is upregulated in 
primary tumors and metastatic disease, and A3 activity correlates with invasive 
actions of tumor cells. This contradictory effect, paralleled by the pro- and 
anti-inflammatory effects of A3, may be explicable because the downregulation of 
A3 receptors may produce different effects than A3 agonism. Adenosine is 
abundant in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and cancer cells seem adept at 
adjusting their metabolic processes to attune themselves to their specific TME. 
The derangement of energy metabolism is characteristic of cancer, and cancer 
spreads as normal cells in proximity to a tumor become increasingly neoplastic 
and tumorigenic. This expands our old notion of tumors as discrete, separate 
bodies and views them now as complex layers of cancer cells of different 
functions; these cells, which can include recruited normal cells, interact with 
each other. The role of mast cells is emerging as an important, albeit 
enigmatic, part of the TME. Mast cells are abundant in tumors and appear to have 
a pro-inflammatory effect, but it is not entirely clear if they serve to promote 
or oppose the growth of tumors. Crosstalk between mast cells and some types of 
cancer cells, involving adenosine, has been observed. The translational impact 
and clinical implications of these findings remain speculative.

Differential diagnosis of peripheral lymphadenopathies is important in terms of 
not missing infections or non-infectious diseases and early diagnosis of 
malignancies. Preliminary diagnoses of tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and malignancy 
were considered for two clinically similar patients, a 33-year-old man and a 
41-year-old woman, who presented to our clinic with neck swelling. The male 
patient's exposure to tuberculosis and the chest x-ray brought us closer to the 
diagnosis of tuberculosis reactivation. The female patient's multiple peripheral 
lymphadenopathies and metastasis-suspicious lesions seen on positron emission 
tomography increased our suspicion of malignancy. However, in the final 
diagnostic process, the female patient was diagnosed with tuberculous 
lymphadenitis, and the male patient was diagnosed with sarcoidosis. We presented 
these two cases to show that it isn't always easy to distinguish tuberculosis 
and sarcoidosis with clinical, radiological, laboratory, and histopathological 
findings, and to draw attention to the importance of microbiological evaluation.

This case report aims to demonstrate the challenges associated with the 
diagnosis and treatment of papillary carcinomas of the male breast. Based on a 
comprehensive screening, which included a pathoanatomic examination of the 
surgical material after a simple Pirogov mastectomy (a surgical procedure where 
all or part of a breast and axillary lymph nodes are removed), the diagnosis was 
confirmed as encapsulated papillary cancer of the left breast. In the 
immunohistochemical study, the estrogen receptor was 100%, the progesterone 
receptor was 90%, and Ki-67 was 60%. Therefore, the patient was prescribed 
adjuvant hormone therapy with tamoxifen. There are no specific diagnostic 
clinical, imaging, or core needle biopsy features of encapsulated papillary 
carcinoma of the male breast. This often leads to more radical surgery for this 
low-grade neoplasm. Before choosing the extent of surgery, it is necessary to 
consider the primary size of the tumor along with an intraoperative assessment 
of the resection margins.

Background Despite advancements in treatment protocols, breast and cervical 
cancer are the leading causes of cancer-associated deaths in Indian women. 
Therefore, there is a need to develop more effective treatment strategies and 
better tumor models to test novel therapeutics. This study reports the 
development of a bioengineered three-dimensional (3D) model that can mimic in 
vivo tumors and be used to understand disease pathophysiology, as well as for 
drug testing/screening applications. Methodology The liquid overlay method was 
used to generate 3D spheroids of uniform size, based on breast (MDA-MB-231) and 
cervical (HeLa and CaSki) cancer cell lines. After this, they were embedded in 
collagen type I. The collagen-embedded spheroids were then subjected to 
live/dead staining, viability study, and expression of epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) markers at predetermined time points. The 3D spheroids were 
also subjected to anti-cancer drug testing, followed by a viability assay. The 
software used for analysis was GraphPad Prism 8.4 (Dotmatics, Boston, 
Massachusetts, United States) and MS Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, 
Washington, United States). Results Uniform-sized, single spheroids for three 
different cell lines, MDA-MB-231, HeLa, and CaSki, were successfully generated 
using the liquid overlay technique. There was a significant increase in the 
viability of 3D spheroids after day 3 of incubation when compared with day 1. 
Live/dead staining showed the presence of dead cells in the core of the 3D 
spheroids. Further, EMT markers such as twist, N-cadherin, and fibronectin were 
found to be elevated in the case of 3D spheroids as compared to the 
two-dimensional (2D) culture of cancer cells. Additionally, the IC50 values of 
MDA-MB-231, HeLa, and CaSki spheroids following treatment with an anti-cancer 
drug, cisplatin, were found to be approximately four to five-fold higher than in 
the 2D culture. Conclusion The collagen-embedded 3D spheroid model is a robust 
model that can be used for the generation of 3D spheroids based on various 
cancer cell lines, recapitulating the properties of solid tumors in vivo. The 
model further demonstrates its potential to be used as a drug screening platform 
and can be used for the generation of patient tumor-derived 3D spheroids in the 
future.

Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in pregnancy is rare and difficult to manage. 
Here, we describe a case of AML with NPM1 mutation. The patient was counselled 
regarding the therapy-attributable risks, underwent an elective caesarean 
section at 33 weeks' gestation, and delivered a morphologically normal fetus. As 
per WHO guidance, AML treatment should not be delayed. Management requires close 
collaboration with obstetric and neonatal teams, striking a balance between 
maternal and foetal survival. Counselling on elective termination should be 
provided. Treatment decisions should reflect gestational age at diagnosis, 
maternal tolerance, and drug toxicity. The aim is to complete pregnancy with a 
viable, healthy fetus and with minimal harm to the mother.

The purpose of our study is to expedite cancer diagnosis through the development 
of software for rapid detection of hereditary breast cancer (BC) with negative 
BRCA1/2 on MATLAB, utilizing a fuzzy logic system with several variants of genes 
associated with BC. This system serves as a clinical decision-support tool, 
assisting in early classification and interpretation of genetic variants by 
combining clinical and genetic data. Clinical data were obtained from Erciyes 
University Faculty of Medicine Department of Medical Genetics and Uludağ 
University Faculty of Medicine Department of Medical Genetics. 488 individuals 
were studied. Only 90 of them were relevant to our investigation since their 
BRCA1/2 genes did not exhibit notable genetic mutations. We examined 16 distinct 
breast cancer risk factors and focused on mutations related to 18 hereditary BC 
genes. The collected data were integrated into the developed system, and various 
membership functions were given varying degrees of possibility, ranging from 0 
to 1, depending on their participation in input clusters. After the system was 
trained on 90 cases and validated on six independent patients, its accuracy was 
assessed, yielding reliable results. Following the training phase, outcomes 
revealed the presence of two pathogenic variants at 0.92 (92%), two benign 
variants at 0.25 (25%), and two variants of unknown significance at 0.5 (50%). 
Given the high incidence of breast cancer, early prediction is paramount. 
Despite the emergence of fuzzy logic systems in medical applications, limited 
research akin to our study exists. The establishment of this artificial 
intelligence software holds promise for advancing the early detection of BC in 
future clinical applications.

OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignancy in the world 
and among the most frequent causes of cancer-related death. Our study aimed to 
evaluate the molecular profile of the patients diagnosed with colorectal 
carcinoma at Clinical Hospital Acibadem-Sistina in Skopje.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is retrospective-prospective, conducted at the 
Department of histopathology and cytology, at Clinical Hospital Acibadem-Sistina 
in Skopje. Tissue samples from surgical material from 152 patients diagnosed 
with CRC were processed for molecular and immunohistochemical analysis. KRAS and 
BRAF mutations were analyzed, and MMR status was obtained. In 90 metastatic 
cases, evaluation of HER2 and PDL-1 expression was performed on a tissue 
microarray.
RESULTS: Among 152 analyzed patients diagnosed with colorectal carcinoma, the 
majority were males (98, 64.47%) compared to females (54, 35.53%). The mean age 
was 68.4±11.3 years; the median age was 70 years. KRAS/NRAS mutations were 
detected in 47(31%) of patients, BRAF mutations in 11(7%) patients, and mismatch 
repair gene deficiency (MMRd) was found in 15(10%) of patients. HER2 positive 
expression was present in 36(40%) of patients, and 17(19%) of patients showed 
PDL-1 expression. In the group of 17 PDL1-positive tumors, a cutoff of more than 
1% positive tumor cells was detected in 10 cases, more than 10% tumor cells in 4 
cases, and more than 50% tumor cells in 3 cases. From 36 HER2 positive cases, 
32(32,5%) were with score 2+, and 4(4,4%) with score 3+.
CONCLUSIONS: Continued research into molecular mechanisms and biomarkers holds 
the promise of further improving CRC outcomes through personalized and effective 
interventions.

INTRODUCTION: A group of primary bone tumors called chondrosarcomas are diverse 
and characterized by neoplastic tissue of hyaline cartilage. They are the second 
most typical primary osseous cancer. Recurrence is indicative of a poor 
prognosis because traditional chondrosarcomas are resistant to treatment. Our 
knowledge of the pathobiology of conventional chondrosarcomas has greatly 
expanded owing to recent findings in these tumors' biology, genetics, and 
epigenetics studies. These findings also provide information on possible 
treatment targets. CHEK2 encodes a checkpoint kinase involved in DNA damage 
response and cell cycle regulation, and it is an important cancer susceptibility 
gene.
METHODS: The Gene2 drug and DSEA assisted with in silico screening. The 
antitumor activities of the candidate drugs were extracted from DepMap via the 
PRISM viability assay on eight chondrosarcoma cell lines.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Advances in studies show promise for discovering 
potential targeted treatments for cancer. Bisacodyl is a targeted G 
protein-coupled receptor 35. G protein-coupled receptors are widely known 
targets for cancer treatment. Here, we showed that bisacodyl can be a potential 
therapeutic agent in chondrosarcoma cell lines.

Organoids are among the most significant advancements in the past few years that 
have revolutionized the medical and dental research. These experimental organs 
have been used to study the developmental processes, pathophysiology, genetic 
mutations, and drug effects. The organoid technology is an important adjunct to 
two-dimensional culture methods and animal models. Stem cells are grown in 
specific environments to develop the organoids, thus, simulating the complexity 
of the in vivo environment. Oral organoids also recapitulate the architecture 
and functions of in vivo organs and tissues in the oral and maxillofacial 
region. Organoids are a promising tool to manipulate human dental stem cell 
biology for comprehending tooth-regenerative approaches, infectious diseases, 
genetic anomalies, oral cancer, and drug discovery.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is typically prostate-specific membrane 
antigen (PSMA)-avid, likely related to PSMA expression in the tumor 
neovasculature, suggesting a potential role for evaluation by PSMA PET/CT. We 
describe a 77-year-old patient with prostate cancer who was incidentally found 
to have ccRCC on imaging with PSMA PET/CT, with subsequent staging by FDG 
PET/CT. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer 17 years prior and treated with 
radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy within a year of diagnosis. 
Biochemical recurrence with PSA of 1.0 ng/mL prompted imaging with PSMA PET/CT, 
which showed an unexpected finding of abnormal uptake within the right renal 
vein and inferior vena cava (IVC), suggesting possible tumor thrombus (SUVmax 
8.8), with mild uptake corresponding to a suspected right renal mass. In 
addition, there was a PSMA-avid right paratracheal nodal metastasis measuring 
3.3 cm (SUVmax 8.4). Subsequent FDG PET/CT again showed the renal mass, tumor 
thrombus (SUVmax 3.6), and only low-level uptake in the right paratracheal mass 
(SUVmax 2.3). Right nephrectomy was performed, confirming the presence of ccRCC 
in the right kidney with tumor thrombus extending to the right renal vein and 
IVC. FDG PET/CT restaging showed no recurrence in the nephrectomy bed and a 
stable FDG-avid right paratracheal mass. After stereotactic body radiation 
therapy (SBRT) directed to the right paratracheal mass, follow-up PSMA PET/CT 
showed decreased uptake (SUVmax 4.8), suggesting its usefulness for detecting 
and monitoring ccRCC.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer survivors face a dual burden of physical and 
psychological challenges, which may persist long after treatment. This study 
aims to evaluate the physical impairments and psychological outcomes among 
breast cancer survivors compared to individuals without breast cancer.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from 3650 breast 
cancer survivors and 145,280 individuals without breast cancer from the Virginia 
Commonwealth University Health System (VCUHS) between January 2024 and 2025. 
Data were extracted through the TriNetX platform using ICD-10 codes to identify 
relevant diagnoses and outcomes. Physical outcomes included abnormalities of 
gait and mobility, unsteadiness on feet, and falls. Psychological outcomes 
assessed were depression, stress-related disorders, and anxiety following falls. 
Risk differences, risk ratios (RR), and odds ratios with 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were calculated to compare outcomes between groups.
RESULTS: Breast cancer survivors exhibited a higher risk of physical impairments 
compared to nonbreast cancer individuals. The risk of gait and mobility 
abnormalities was 2.725% in breast cancer survivors versus 1.741% in the 
comparison group (RR: 1.565; 95% CI: 1.285-1.906; p < 0.0001). Unsteadiness on 
feet was more prevalent among breast cancer survivors (0.817%) compared to 
0.296% in non-cancer individuals (RR: 2.762; 95% CI: 1.91-3.993; p < 0.0001). 
Additionally, breast cancer survivors had a higher risk of falls (1.644%) 
compared to nonbreast cancer patients (1.081%) (RR: 1.521; 95% CI: 1.178-1.964; 
p = 0.0012). Psychologically, breast cancer survivors who experienced falls were 
more likely to suffer from depression (28.57% vs. 13.1%, p = 0.0002), 
stress-related disorders (14.29% vs. 3.49%, p < 0.0001), and anxiety (28.57% vs. 
15.72%, p = 0.0040) compared to fallers without breast cancer.
CONCLUSION: Functional limitations such as unsteadiness and falls are 
significantly more common among breast cancer survivors and are strongly 
associated with psychological distress. These findings support mobility 
impairments as a potential pathway linking cancer treatment to adverse mental 
health outcomes. Future research should integrate structured ICD-10 data with 
unstructured oncology notes to enhance fall prediction models and guide 
personalized survivorship care.

De novo proline synthesis is a highly conserved and essential biochemical 
pathway in mammals. Beyond serving as a fundamental building block for proteins, 
proline also plays key roles in diverse cellular functions and maintaining 
tissue homeostasis. Over the past decade, accumulating evidence has underscored 
the significance of this pathway in regulating critical cellular processes, 
including redox balance, cell growth, signal transduction, and the synthesis of 
nucleotides and proteins, as well as overall cellular metabolism. The 
biosynthesis of proline is tightly controlled by multiple evolutionarily 
conserved mechanisms to ensure proper cellular function. Importantly, 
disruptions in proline metabolism-particularly changes in the activity or 
expression of enzymes involved in its synthesis and degradation-have been 
implicated in the onset and progression of several diseases, notably cancer and 
fibrosis. In this review, we highlight recent advances in understanding the 
regulation of de novo proline synthesis. We also examine how dysregulation of 
this pathway contributes to disease development and influences therapeutic 
outcomes. Finally, we explore the therapeutic potential of targeting proline 
metabolism in disease treatment.

BACKGROUND: In the HIV/tuberculosis endemic Western Cape public care setting, 
diagnostic consideration of patients with persistent lymphadenopathy focuses on 
extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB), delaying diagnosis of other infectious or 
malignant causes of lymphadenopathy.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic pathways of patients investigated for 
lymphadenopathy at Groote Schuur Hospital.
METHOD: A retrospective review of patients undergoing lymph node excision biopsy 
was conducted to correlate test selection and results prior to biopsy with final 
patient diagnosis and assess the impact of pre-biopsy pathways on diagnostic 
delay.
RESULTS: Of 86 patients undergoing excision biopsy, 61 (71%) had no previous 
diagnosis to explain the lymphadenopathy. Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis was the 
commonest diagnosis (24.6%, 15/61), followed by lymphoma (21.3%, 13/61), and 
metastatic cancer (14.8%, 9/61). Median time from presentation with 
lymphadenopathy to first excision biopsy was 55 days (interquartile range [IQR] 
22-106). Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of lymphadenopathy was performed 
in 30 out of 61 (49%) of the patients and repeated in a third of these, while 
smear for acid-fast bacilli and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were 
infrequently performed, and the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay on FNA was never 
performed. FNA cytology was non-diagnostic in all seven patients with lymphoma 
in whom it was performed.
CONCLUSION: In patients with lymphadenopathy, we demonstrate how poorly 
structured diagnostic pathways contribute to unnecessary healthcare utilisation 
and diagnostic delay in treatable conditions. Providing early access to biopsy 
after appropriate workup ensures accurate diagnosis of unexplained 
lymphadenopathy.

BACKGROUND: HIV-positive women with breast cancer do not exhibit significant 
differences in tumour characteristics when compared to their HIV-negative 
counterparts. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) serve as an 
important indicator of the host's capacity to combat malignancy, particularly 
during the early stages of tumour progression.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess and compare the 
pathological characteristics of breast carcinomas, specifically focusing on TILs 
in histological specimens obtained before and after systemic therapy, between 
HIV-positive and HIV-negative patient groups at a public hospital in the Western 
Cape province. Additionally, the study aimed to determine whether a higher 
percentage of TILs was associated with a favourable treatment response.
METHOD: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, incorporating a negative 
control group matched for histological subtype, and intrinsic subtypes among 
patients diagnosed between January 2017 and December 2018.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in TILs before and after treatment, 
nor was there a difference between patients treated with neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy (NACT) compared to those receiving endocrine therapy (ET) within 
both groups. A complete pathological response was achieved in four HIV-positive 
patients (14%) and one HIV-negative patient (2%). An inversely proportional 
relationship was noted between TILs and CD4 counts prior to treatment.
CONCLUSION: This study found no significant differences in TILs between 
HIV-positive and HIV-negative women with breast cancer. There is a need for 
further research on the prognostic value of TILs, especially for guiding 
additional treatment options including the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors.

BACKGROUND: Carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) are extremely small particles mainly 
composed of carbon atoms, typically ranging from 1 to 100 nm in size. Although 
CNPs have promising applications in various fields, they can damage cell 
membranes, cause toxicity, and potentially induce mutations that may lead to 
cancer.
AIM: This study aimed to investigate the dose-dependent effects of CNPs on the 
liver in rats.
METHODS: Twenty-five male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight, 100-130 g) were 
acclimated and randomly divided into five groups. Groups I, II, and III received 
intraperitoneal injections of CNPs at doses of 19.5, 58.5, and 97.5 mg/kg of 
body weight for 28 consecutive days, respectively. The saline control group 
received 0.5 ml of normal saline. Liver samples were collected for biochemical 
and histological analyses.
RESULTS: Rats exposed to higher CNP doses showed significant weight loss. Serum 
alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and 
bilirubin levels were markedly modulated, especially in the high-dose group. 
Lipid metabolism was also disrupted. Histological studies revealed 
hepatocellular degeneration, inflammatory infiltration, and sinusoidal dilation 
at higher CNP concentrations.
CONCLUSION: The results revealed that exposure to CNPs, particularly at higher 
doses, may lead to liver toxicity and pose health risks. As the use of CNPs 
becomes more widespread, understanding their biological effects is essential to 
ensure their safe use for the reasonable development of nanotechnology.

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter species are spiral-shaped gram-negative bacteria that 
colonize the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals. Helicobacter pylori 
are most famous for their role in gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. 
Their unique adaptation to the harsh acidic environment of the stomach is a key 
aspect of pathogenicity.
AIM: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Helicobacter spp. in cats 
in Kazan and identify the species of these bacteria using molecular genetic 
methods.
METHODS: The research is based on endoscopic, microscopic, and molecular genetic 
methods of investigation. Cats with pronounced clinical signs of 
gastrointestinal disease were examined.
RESULTS: Endoscopic examination revealed ulcers, erosions, and hyperplasia in 
all cases. Microscopic examination of biopsy samples from these animals 
identified characteristic spirally shaped Helicobacter spp. in 70% of cases. A 
noninvasive method for the laboratory diagnosis of Helicobacter infection was 
used to identify Helicobacter spp. in cats. Fecal samples from cats with 
gastrointestinal clinical signs and from asymptomatic cats were investigated 
using polymerase chain reaction method. The deoxyribonucleic acid of 
Helicobacter spp was present in 61.7% of cases, with the species Helicobacter 
rappini being the most frequently isolated (51.35%). Additionally, H. pylori was 
detected in 18.92% of cases and Helicobacter bilis in 45.95%, highlighting the 
variety of bacterial combinations in the stomachs of cats.
CONCLUSION: Based on the obtained data, this study concluded that there exists 
an important relationship between Helicobacter spp. and gastrointestinal 
diseases in cats. Furthermore, this widespread occurrence indicated a high 
degree of adaptation of these bacteria to this animal species.

University, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia.

Background: Several studies have reported infections with Helicobacter (H) 
pylori in different veterinary species, raising concerns about the zoonotic 
potential of this gastric ulcer and cancer-causing pathogen.
AIM: The present study was conducted to test the presence of anti-H. pylori 
antibodies in serum collected from different animal species in the Eastern 
Region of Saudi Arabia. In addition, the impact of some physiologic factors, 
including age, gender, breed, and reproduction status of animals, on the 
prevalence of H. pylori in the livestock species studied was discussed.
METHODS: This study was conducted on 288 animals kept at different farms in the 
Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia. The animals included 120 cattle, 88 camels, 18 
sheep, and 62 goats. The prevalence of anti-H. pylori antibodies in animal serum 
samples were investigated using a commercial indirect enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit along with a protein A/G conjugate, enabling 
antibody detection in multiple species. Samples with ODsample /ODcontrol ≥ 1.1 
were considered positive. Samples with an ODsample/ ODcontrol ratio ≥ 0.8 to < 
1.1 were considered borderline positive. Samples with ODsample/ODcontrol < 0.8 
were considered negative.
RESULTS: Seroprevalence ratios were calculated as percentages of positive 
samples related to the total number of samples tested for each species. The 
results revealed the presence of H. pylori antibodies in serum samples collected 
from cattle, camel, and goat, with the highest prevalence observed in cattle. 
For all species, 16 samples were positive for H. pylori with an overall 
prevalence of 5.6%, 24 samples (8.3%) were considered borderline, and 248 
samples (86.1%) were negative. The highest seroprevalence was found in the 
cattle population (10% seropositive and 15% borderline positive), followed by 
goats (3.2% seropositive and 3.2% borderline positive) and camels (2.2% 
seropositive and 4.5% borderline positive). All tested sheep samples were 
negative for H. pylori antibodies.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first report 
on the prevalence of H. pylori antibodies in serum from different animal species 
in Saudi Arabia. The results of the current study support the potential role of 
ruminants as a natural reservoir of H. pylori, highlighting the need for further 
research to investigate the zoonotic potential of this bacterium and the role of 
animals in human infections with this pathogen in Saudi Arabia.

Background: Recent studies have linked various types of cancer to free radicals, 
driving research into plant-derived compounds that may mitigate oxidative 
damage.
AIM: To evaluate the antioxidant potential of ethanolic (EE) and water extracts 
(WEs) from four Omani plant species: Ocimum basilicum, Teucrium polium, Cleome 
amblyocarpa, and Caralluma arabica.
METHODS: Antioxidant activity was assessed using the following five assays: 
2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical-scavenging, nitric oxide (NO) 
radical scavenging, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), Trolox equivalent 
antioxidant capacity (TEAC), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Ascorbic acid 
and Trolox were used as reference antioxidants.
RESULTS: Both extracts exhibited dose-dependent DPPH scavenging, with O. 
basilicum EE showing the highest activity (IC50 = 0.25 ± 0.022 mg/ml). Ocimum 
basilicum EE also displayed the strongest NO scavenging activity (IC50 = 0.02 ± 
0.002 mg/ml), surpassing that of ascorbic acid. WE demonstrated superior 
reducing power (p = 0.01) in the FRAP assay, with C. amblyocarpa WE exhibiting 
the highest activity (7.42 ± 0.015 mg/ml). TEAC and TAC assays revealed species- 
and solvent-dependent differences, with EE generally showing greater antioxidant 
activity, except for C. amblyocarpa WE, which exhibited a significantly higher 
TAC (p < 0.001). Two-way ANOVA identified plant species as the primary 
determinant of antioxidant potential (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The strong antioxidant properties of selected Omani plants, 
particularly O. basilicum and C. arabica, highlight their potential for 
therapeutic and nutraceutical applications.

The prognosis of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) 
remained unsatisfactory currently. Chidamide is a well tolerated, selective 
histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, but the efficacy in mCRPC remained 
uncertain. From August 2020 to October 2022, a total of 18 patients were 
enrolled. The primary endpoint was to assess the safety and the secondary 
endpoints including efficacy and biomarker analysis. The common adverse events 
(AEs) included anemia, anorexia, hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, nausea and 
fatigue. Grade 3 toxicities included anemia and thrombocytopenia, and no DLT was 
observed in this study. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.7 
months (95% CI, 0.922-6.611 months), and the median OS was 11.0 months (95% CI, 
2.232-19.768 months). The results of the RNA-seq profile indicated the high 
immune cell infiltration and the upregulation of immune cell functions in tumor 
tissues was associated with the efficacy of chidamide, as revealed by GSEA and 
ssGSEA. Furthermore, chidamide has been demonstrated to upregulate immune 
response-related pathways in CRPC cells. Our study suggested that chidamide plus 
abiraterone is well tolerated in mCRPC, and preliminary evidence suggests that 
it may improve the survival of patients with mCRPC. Furthermore, combining 
chidamide with immunotherapy could be another promising option for further 
enhancing its efficacy.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that play 
a central role in regulating immune responses by linking innate and adaptive 
immunity. In recent decades, substantial progress has been made in understanding 
the development, classification, and diverse functions of DCs. However, a 
comprehensive overview integrating recent advances in the biology and 
therapeutic targeting of DCs remains lacking. This review systematically 
summarizes the origin, developmental pathways, and subset heterogeneity of DCs, 
including classical type 1 and 2 DCs, plasmacytoid DCs, monocyte-derived DCs, 
and Langerhans cells. Moreover, it further details the core biological functions 
of DCs, including antigen capture, migration, and maturation; antigen 
presentation; activation of adaptive immunity; induction of immune tolerance; 
and modulation of innate immune responses. The pathological roles of DCs in 
diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and infectious diseases are discussed, 
highlighting emerging DC-based therapeutic strategies. Importantly, this review 
provides a summary of both preclinical studies and clinical trials involving 
DC-targeted therapies, offering a translational perspective. This work aims to 
deepen the understanding of DC immunobiology and to provide a valuable 
foundation for the development of novel DC-based immunotherapies.

Cancer continues to be one of the primary causes of death worldwide. Although 
there has been substantial progress in clinical cancer care, the outcomes for 
cancer patients still remain poor. The rapid advancements of artificial 
intelligence (AI) will revolutionize cancer management by addressing current 
obstacles in oncology research and practice, ultimately enhancing healthcare 
accuracy and patient outcomes. Increasing evidence demonstrates that AI-based 
models can improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis and treatment 
by leveraging multilayer data. Cancer patients could greatly benefit from AI's 
promising prospects, yet few AI models have been authorized for clinical use. A 
comprehensive understanding of AI's basic principles, applications, and 
potential impacts is essential to foster its clinical translation. In this 
review, we provide an overview of fundamental AI techniques, encompassing 
machine learning and deep learning. Moreover, we summarize recent studies on 
AI's transformative role in cancer diagnosis, classification, and personalized 
treatment planning. Furthermore, we discuss the current challenges that hinder 
the widespread use of AI, propose potential solutions, and outline future 
directions. Overall, through systematic analysis of existing preclinical and 
clinical evidence, this review highlights the substantial potential of AI 
technology and provides valuable guidance for future research in AI-driven 
oncology.

INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of male cancer mortality, 
with metastasis and immune evasion posing major therapeutic challenges. DOCK3, a 
guanine nucleotide exchange factor implicated in cytoskeletal dynamics, is 
poorly characterized in PCa. This study investigates DOCK3's role in PCa 
metastasis and tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) remodeling.
METHODS: Multi-omics analyses integrated bulk RNA-seq from TCGA-PRAD (499 
tumors/52 normals), scRNA-seq from GEO (45,325 cells), and genomic data. We 
performed: Differential expression analysis (DESeq2), Immune deconvolution 
(CIBERSORT,ssGSEA, xCell), WGCNA co-expression networks, Tumor mutational burden 
(TMB) assessment, Distant metastasis (M1 vs. M0) association studies, scRNA-seq 
clustering (Harmony/UMAP) and DE testing. Statistical significance thresholds: 
|log2FC|>1, padj<0.05.
RESULTS: DOCK3 expression was found to be significantly elevated in metastatic 
(M1) tumors compared to primary (M0) tumors (p<0.05) and demonstrated a strong 
positive correlation with a higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) in metastatic 
samples (p<0.001). Cellular specificity analysis revealed that DOCK3 was 
exclusively and highly enriched within malignant epithelial and stromal cells, 
specifically in Cluster 6, where it exhibited a log2 fold-change of 9.13 
(padj<1e-200) and was expressed in 54% of cells, compared to a negligible 
presence in all other clusters. In the tumor microenvironment, elevated DOCK3 
expression was associated with a significant increase in cytotoxic immune 
infiltration, notably of CD8+ T and Natural Killer cells, a finding consistently 
supported by multiple computational algorithms (all p<0.05). Clinically, a high 
level of DOCK3 was significantly associated with metastatic status (p<0.01), 
whereas high expression of CDKN3 was correlated with advanced disease features, 
including higher Gleason scores (3-5) and T-stage (T2-T4) (p<0.01). Furthermore, 
significant differences in immune infiltration patterns were observed between 
clusters. Pathway enrichment analysis of genes co-expressed with DOCK3, 
identified through the WGCNA Green Module, indicated significant involvement in 
biological processes such as cytoskeletal reorganization, muscle contraction, 
and metabolic pathways (FDR<0.01).
CONCLUSION: DOCK3 drives PCa metastasis through cytoskeletal dynamics while 
paradoxically promoting an immunologically active microenvironment. Its 
tumor-specific expression and association with aggressive clinical features 
nominate DOCK3 as a novel biomarker for risk stratification and a promising 
therapeutic target for combinatorial immunotherapy in immunologically ""cold"" 
PCa.

Chronic inflammation plays a key role in the development of hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of liver cancer. 
This study aimed to evaluate the anti-HCC potential of the petroleum ether 
extract of Ficus pandurata Hance (FPHPE), a traditional hepatoprotective herb, 
focusing on its pro-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory actions via the JAK2/STAT3 
signaling pathway. In vitro experiments demonstrated significant growth 
inhibition of HepG2, SMMC7721, and Hep3B cells following FPHPE treatment. GC-MS 
profiling identified 26 phytoconstituents, including friedelane, seseline, 
bergaptan, and tocopherols, many with known bioactivity. In a xenograft mouse 
model, FPHPE markedly suppressed tumor growth without causing systemic toxicity. 
Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that FPHPE activated mitochondria-mediated 
apoptosis, as confirmed by Annexin V/PI flow cytometry, Western blot 
quantification from three biological replicates, TEM imaging showing disrupted 
cristae, and JC-1 staining revealing mitochondrial membrane depolarization. 
Concurrently, FPHPE downregulated phosphorylated and total JAK2/STAT3, inhibited 
STAT3 nuclear translocation, and suppressed key downstream effectors (iNOS, 
COX2, c-Myc, Vimentin, and Slug). ELISA further confirmed a reduction of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β in tumor tissues. Together, these 
findings establish FPHPE as a dual-action phytotherapeutic candidate that 
interrupts both survival and inflammatory pathways, positioning F. pandurata as 
a promising source for nutraceuticals or complementary therapies against 
inflammation-driven liver cancer.

BACKGROUND: Ferroptosis, a regulated form of iron-dependent cell death, has 
shown promise as an anti-tumor mechanism. However, its role in pancreatic cancer 
remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to identify a ferroptosis-related 
prognostic signature and key biomarkers.
METHODS: Transcriptomic profiles and clinical data of pancreatic cancer patients 
were obtained from the GEO and TCGA databases. A prognostic signature was 
constructed using LASSO and Cox regression analysis. The role of a key gene, 
NOTCH2, was investigated through somatic mutation, functional enrichment, immune 
infiltration, and drug sensitivity analysis. In vitro, the expression of NOTCH2 
was confirmed by Western blot, and its effects on cell proliferation and 
migration were assessed using MTT, colony formation, and wound-healing assays. 
Its involvement in ferroptosis was further investigated by measuring 
intracellular iron, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and C11-BODIPY.
RESULTS: We constructed and validated a ferroptosis-related prognostic signature 
consisting of NOTCH2, KRT18, and H1-2. Patients in the high-risk group, as 
defined by this signature, exhibited significantly worse overall survival. A 
nomogram integrating the risk score and clinical variables demonstrated 
excellent accuracy in predicting patient prognosis. We identified NOTCH2 as a 
key biomarker, showing upregulated expression in pancreatic cancer tissues and 
cell lines, which correlated with poor prognosis and increased infiltration of 
M2 macrophages. Functionally, knockdown of NOTCH2 in vitro inhibited the 
proliferation and migration of pancreatic cancer cells while increasing both 
intracellular iron concentration and lipid peroxidation levels.
CONCLUSION: Our study establishes a ferroptosis-related signature for prognostic 
prediction in pancreatic cancer and identifies NOTCH2 as a critical prognostic 
biomarker. NOTCH2 may promote pancreatic cancer progression by suppressing 
ferroptosis, highlighting it as a potential therapeutic target.

Nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 pathway, significantly 
transforming cancer immunotherapy. However, its use is associated with 
immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including immune-mediated hepatitis 
(IMH), which can be severe or even life-threatening. We present a case of an 
81-year-old male with gastric cancer and liver metastasis, who demonstrated 
significant anti-tumor efficacy following nivolumab monotherapy. The patient 
developed grade 3 IMH during treatment, but after discontinuing the medication 
and receiving timely treatment, his symptoms improved, and liver biochemical 
markers declined. Additionally, using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System 
(FAERS) database, we analyzed the incidence of hepatitis adverse events caused 
by different immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in various age groups of 
patients to better understand the safety of these drugs in different patient 
populations.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy worldwide and the 
second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Its progression is driven by 
genetic and epigenetic alterations, with increasing evidence emphasizing the 
role of the transcriptome, particularly post-transcriptional modifications. 
Human antigen R (HuR), an RNA-binding protein (RBP), plays a crucial role in 
post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In the context of tumor 
progression, HuR affects a range of cellular processes, including cell 
proliferation, survival, and metabolic reprogramming, via regulating target mRNA 
stability and translation. Additionally, HuR influences the tumor 
microenvironment (TME) through modulating target mRNAs involved in inflammation, 
immune responses, extracellular matrix remodeling and angiogenesis. Despite 
these insights, the precise mechanisms by which HuR regulates 
post-transcriptional process in CRC remain unclear. This review first provides 
an overview of HuR's roles and the underlying mechanisms involved in CRC 
progression, including its regulation of mRNA expression, control of the cell 
cycle, and modulation of the TME. We also discussed the potential of HuR as a 
therapeutic target, exploring how targeting HuR could slow down CRC progression 
and metastasis, ultimately leading to more effective and personalized treatment 
strategies.

Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) represents an advanced stage of 
prostate cancer progression. Although the combination of androgen deprivation 
therapy (ADT) with chemotherapy and first generation hormone therapy is 
initially effective, patients ultimately develop resistance. In recent years, 
breakthroughs in targeted therapies and immunotherapies, along with the 
emergence of novel combination strategies, have provided new hope for patients 
with CRPC. This article systematically reviews the latest advancements in 
targeted and immunotherapeutic approaches for CRPC, integrating clinical data 
and mechanistic studies to analyze the efficacy and challenges of novel agents 
(e.g., second-generation AR inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, PSMA-targeted 
therapies) and combination regimens. It also provides insights for exploring 
future optimization directions.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to validate secreted biomarkers SPON2 and MSMB with 
tumor-specific expression and immunogenicity for nanomaterial-based prostate 
cancer diagnostics.
METHODS: Gene expression data (GSE55945), comprising 13 prostate tumor and 8 
normal tissue samples, retrieved from the GEO database and analyzed by 
Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array platform. Differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) were identified using thresholds of |log2 fold change| >1 and 
adjusted p < 0.05. Upregulated DEGs filtered for secretory proteins based on 
annotations from Human Protein Atlas and UniProt databases. Candidate genes were 
prioritized using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, selecting 
those with area under the curve (AUC) > 0.85 for validation. Quantitative 
reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using clinical tumor and 
matched normal prostate tissues, with GAPDH as internal control. Extracellular 
accessibility and immune relevance of SPON2 and MSMB were evaluated for 
diagnostic translation. B cell epitope prediction was done using IEDB and 
VaxiJen tools to assess immunogenic potential. Selected peptide epitopes were 
synthesized and validated by indirect ELISA using sera from prostate cancer 
patients and healthy controls.
RESULTS: Out of 243 DGE, five upregulated candidates encoding secretory proteins 
were identified. Of these, SPON2 and MSMB exhibited high diagnostic performance 
with AUC values of 0.99 and 0.93, respectively. qRT-PCR validation in clinical 
samples confirmed significant overexpression of SPON2 (~18-fold) and MSMB 
(~2.6-fold) in prostate tumor tissues compared to matched normal tissues. Both 
proteins demonstrate extracellular localization and immune accessibility, 
supporting their feasibility as targets for antibody- or epitope-based capture 
strategies. These properties position SPON2 and MSMB as ideal candidates for 
nanoparticle-conjugated peptide biosensors designed for immunomodulated 
detection of prostate cancer. Epitope E1 (SPON2) and E2 (MSMB) showed 
antigenicity scores of 0.80 and 0.52, respectively, and were validated by ELISA, 
with E1 exhibiting significantly higher reactivity in cancer sera (OD 1.49 vs. 
0.81, p < 0.01; AUC 0.98) and E2 showing moderate discrimination (OD 1.27 vs. 
0.87, p < 0.05; AUC 0.88).
CONCLUSION: SPON2 and MSMB are secretory, immunogenic biomarkers overexpressed 
in prostate cancer. Their validated B cell epitopes demonstrate strong 
diagnostic performance, supporting their potential in nanomaterial-based 
immunodiagnostic strategies for non-invasive prostate cancer detection.

Nucleotide metabolism plays a pivotal role in the onset and progression of 
various human diseases, including pancreatic disorders. As fundamental 
biomolecules, nucleotides are essential for DNA and RNA synthesis, energy 
production, and cell signaling. Disruptions in nucleotide metabolic pathways 
have been linked to altered cell proliferation, apoptosis, and immune 
responses-critical processes in the development of pancreatic diseases. In 
pancreatic cancer, metabolic changes in nucleotides facilitate rapid tumor cell 
proliferation and enhance chemotherapy resistance. Recent studies have 
concentrated on identifying specific enzymes and pathways within nucleotide 
metabolism as potential therapeutic targets. Targeted interventions, such as 
modulating RRM2, TS, and other key enzymes or disrupting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
pathway, have demonstrated potential in reducing tumor growth and inflammation 
in pancreatic tissue. This review provides an overview of the latest 
advancements in the understanding of nucleotide metabolism in pancreatic cancer 
pathogenesis, emphasizing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies that may improve 
patient outcomes.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) comprises non-cancerous cells, extracellular 
matrix, and signaling molecules that interact with tumor cells. These dynamic 
interactions critically influence tumor development, progression, metastasis, 
and treatment response. Cancer-associated adipocytes (CAAs), as a main component 
of the tumor-adipose microenvironment (TAME), have various functions, including 
remodeling the extracellular matrix and interacting with tumor cells or 
infiltrated leukocytes through a variety of mutual signals. Dysfunctional 
adipocytes can release different metabolic substrates, adipokines and cytokines 
to affect the activity and function of immune cells in TME, especially T cells, 
thus promoting the proliferation, progression, invasion and migration of cancer 
cells. In this review, we summarize the effects of secretions of adipocytes on 
the activity and function of different types of T cells in TME, and discuss the 
possible targets of adipocytes in cancer therapy to provide new ideas for 
anti-cancer therapy by targeting adipocytes.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer immunotherapy. 
However, immune-related adverse events (irAEs), particularly hematologic 
toxicities, remain rare but potentially life-threatening complications. Among 
these, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) induced by ICIs is a clinically 
significant yet underrecognized condition. We report a rare case of ICI-induced 
AIHA concomitant with thrombocytopenia in an elderly female patient with 
advanced gastric cancer who had undergone immune monotherapy.
CASE DESCRIPTION: An 84-year-old female with unresectable, PD-L1-high (combined 
positive score [CPS] = 55) advanced gastric adenocarcinoma developed a rare case 
of recurrent immune checkpoint inhibitor associated autoimmune hemolytic anemia 
and thrombocytopenia after sequential treatment with three ICIs: sintilimab 
(anti-PD-1), cadonilimab (a bispecific PD-1/CTLA-4 antibody), and ivonescimab (a 
bispecific PD-1/VEGF antibody). Initially, sintilimab monotherapy induced 
partial tumor regression; however, the patient later developed 
transfusion-dependent anemia and severe thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow aspiration 
revealed erythroid aplasia and characteristic teardrop poikilocytes, suggesting 
marrow stress or fibrosis. Reintroduction of ICIs triggered recurrent 
hematologic toxicity, pointing to a class-wide immune-mediated mechanism. 
Despite aggressive treatment with glucocorticoids, red blood cell and platelet 
transfusions, and comprehensive supportive care, the cytopenias persisted, and 
imaging confirmed disease progression. Ultimately, immune-related hematologic 
toxicity led to multiorgan failure and the patient's death.
CONCLUSION: This case underscores the diagnostic complexity and therapeutic 
challenges associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor induced autoimmune 
hemolytic anemia in elderly patients, particularly those experiencing 
immunosenescence and possessing limited hematopoietic reserve. The mechanisms 
underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood, highlighting the urgent 
need for mechanistic investigations, individualized immunotherapeutic 
strategies, and vigilant hematologic monitoring in vulnerable populations.

INTRODUCTION: Tumor neoantigens possess high specificity and immunogenicity, 
making them crucial targets for personalized cancer immunotherapies such as mRNA 
vaccines and T-cell therapies. However, experimental identification and 
evaluation of their immunogenicity are time-consuming, which limits the 
efficiency of vaccine development.
METHODS: To address these challenges, we implemented two key strategies. First, 
we upgraded the TumorAgDB database by integrating publicly available neoantigen 
data from the past two years, resulting in TumorAgDB2.0. Second, we developed 
NeoTImmuML, a weighted ensemble machine learning model for predicting neoantigen 
immunogenicity. Using data from TumorAgDB2.0, we calculated the physicochemical 
properties of peptides and systematically evaluated eight machine learning 
algorithms via five-fold cross-validation. The top-performing algorithms - 
LightGBM, XGBoost, and Random Forest - were integrated into a weighted ensemble 
model.
RESULTS: TumorAgDB2.0 (https://tumoragdb.com.cn) now contains 187,223 entries. 
Moreover, NeoTImmuML demonstrated strong generalization performance on both 
internal and external test datasets. SHAP feature importance analysis revealed 
that peptide hydrophilicity and length are key determinants of immunogenicity.
DISCUSSION: TumorAgDB2.0 provides a comprehensive data resource for neoantigen 
research, while NeoTImmuML offers an efficient and interpretable tool for 
predicting neoantigen immunogenicity. Together, they offer valuable support for 
the design of personalized neoantigen vaccines and the development of cancer 
immunotherapy strategies.

Innate immune cells and pathways are central to shaping the tumor 
microenvironment (TME), where they influence tumor growth, metastasis, and 
responsiveness to immunotherapy. Although research on innate immunity in cancer 
has expanded considerably, the mechanisms driving immune dysfunction remain 
incompletely understood. This review summarizes current knowledge on the 
functional states of innate immune cells within the TME and highlights how 
metabolic reprogramming contributes to immune suppression and tumor progression. 
We further discuss recent advances in therapeutic strategies targeting innate 
immune pathways, emphasizing their translational potential. Importantly, we also 
examine unresolved controversies and knowledge gaps across innate immune cells, 
metabolic networks, and innate immune factors such as complement and cytokines, 
outlining key challenges for clinical translation. By linking mechanistic 
insights with emerging interventions and identifying future directions, this 
review provides a framework for integrating innate immunity into next-generation 
cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer (BC) remains a widespread malignancy and ranks as 
the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. 
Hypoxia, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and immune-related processes 
have been increasingly recognized as critical contributors to BC pathogenesis. 
However, a prognostic model integrating hypoxia-, EMT-, and immune-related genes 
(HEMTIRGs) to predict BC outcomes has not yet been established.
METHODS: Gene expression datasets of BC patients were obtained from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Prognostic genes were 
identified using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) Cox 
regression analysis. A prognostic model was developed based on these genes. 
Immune infiltration was assessed using CIBERSORT and ssGSEA analyses. 
Immunotherapy response was predicted using the tumor immune dysfunction and 
exclusion (TIDE) algorithm. Functional roles of HEMTIRGs in BC malignancy were 
validated through in vitro experiments.
RESULTS: In this study, four HEMTIRGs (PAX7, DCD, CRISP3, and FGG) were 
identified and used to develop a prognostic model. Patients were stratified into 
high- and low-risk groups based on median risk scores. A nomogram based on this 
model accurately predicted overall survival (OS), consistent with the observed 
outcomes. Notably, patients in the high-risk group exhibited increased immune 
cell infiltration but a lower predicted response to immunotherapy. 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) further confirmed that HEMTIRGs expression levels 
were strongly associated with breast cancer, with CRISP3 showing the most 
pronounced upregulation. In vitro functional assays demonstrated that CRISP3 
promoted malignant phenotypes of breast cancer cells under hypoxic conditions 
through activation of the IL-17/AKT signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: This study establishes a novel HEMTIRGs-based prognostic model for 
BC, offering a robust tool for predicting patient prognosis and immunotherapy 
efficacy. Additionally, our findings provide new insights into BC pathogenesis, 
highlighting potential therapeutic targets.

The recent advancement of mRNA technology has opened new therapeutic avenues for 
treating hematologic malignancies, offering innovative approaches to enhance 
existing immunotherapies. This review examines the expanding role of in vitro 
transcribed (IVT)-mRNA-based platforms in hemato-oncology, focusing on key 
areas: monoclonal antibody production, bispecific antibody development, and 
CAR-T cell engineering. Unlike conventional biologics, mRNA allows for in vivo 
expression of therapeutic proteins, reducing manufacturing complexity and 
expanding access through scalable, cell-free synthesis. IVT-mRNA-encoded 
monoclonal and bispecific antibodies can overcome limitations such as short 
half-life and the need for continuous infusion, while enabling innovations like 
Fc silencing, protease-activated masking, and combinatorial immunotherapies. In 
CAR-T cell therapy, IVT-mRNA provides transient, safer alternatives to viral 
vector-based approaches and facilitates emerging strategies such as in vivo CAR 
programming and IVT-mRNA vaccine-like boosters. Despite these advantages, 
challenges remain, including delivery precision, durability of therapeutic 
effects, and limited clinical trial success. Beyond therapeutic mechanisms, the 
integration of bioinformatics and AI in IVT-mRNA design is accelerating the 
development of personalized and efficient cancer treatments. Overall, mRNA 
technology is redefining immunotherapy in hematology and holds the potential to 
broaden access to advanced treatments globally.

BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) is recommended as the standard 
of care for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Adding 
immunotherapy to nCRT (nICRT) has gained attention in clinical practice. We 
evaluated the differences in clinicopathologic outcomes and the patterns of 
lymph node metastasis in patients receiving nCRT and nICRT for locally advanced 
ESCC.
METHODS: A total of 208 ESCC patients who completed transthoracic esophagectomy 
after neoadjuvant treatment were enrolled. Clinicopathologic parameters and the 
rates of lymph node metastasis in each station classified using both the eighth 
edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) esophageal cancer 
staging system and the 11th edition of the Japanese Classification of Esophageal 
Cancer (JCEC) standard were recorded and evaluated.
RESULTS: The rates of pathological complete response (pCR) and major 
pathological response (MPR) were 44.9% in nICRT vs. 37.0% in nCRT (p = 0.263) 
and 79.5% in nICRT vs. 65.4% in nCRT (p = 0.024), respectively. The common sites 
of lymph node metastasis after neoadjuvant treatment were station 112pulL 
(8.3%), followed by station 104L (4.9%), station 7 (4.5%), and station 3a 
(4.3%), according to the 11th JCEC standard. Compared with nCRT, nICRT can 
significantly reduce the rates of lymph node metastasis in station 2R (0.8% vs. 
4.6%, p = 0.039) classified using the AJCC system, and those in station 106recR 
(0.8% vs. 4.6%, p = 0.042) and station 20 (0 vs. 12.5%, p = 0.030) classified 
using the JCEC standard.
CONCLUSION: nICRT followed by surgery may lead to a promising pathological 
response. For patients with lymph node metastasis in certain regions, nICRT 
should be considered as a better preoperative treatment option.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the knowledge, attitude, and practice 
(KAP) of oral nutritional supplementation in patients undergoing radiotherapy 
for head-and-neck cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted from 
December 2023 to July 2024 across five medical institutes. Demographic data and 
KAP scores were collected and assessed using a self-developed validated 
questionnaire. A threshold of ≥70.0% of the maximal scores was established to 
define good knowledge, a positive attitude, and active practice.
RESULTS: A total of 437 valid questionnaires were analyzed; the majority of 
participants were men (70.71%) and aged between 41 and 60 years (50.11%). The 
median knowledge score was 4 (range: 0-10; possible range: 0-20), the median 
attitude score was 34 (range: 30-39; possible range: 10-50), and the median 
practice score was 15 (range: 13-17; possible range: 4-20). The knowledge score 
exhibited a positive correlation between both attitude (r = 0.379, p < 0.001) 
and practice (r = 0.395, p < 0.001) scores; attitude and practice scores were 
also positively correlated (r = 0.363, p < 0.001). Structural equation modeling 
showed that knowledge had a direct positive effect on attitude (β = 0.613, 
p < 0.001) and practice (β = 0.807, p < 0.001), while attitude had a direct 
effect on practice (β = 0.614, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that patients with head-and-neck cancer 
undergoing radiotherapy exhibit poor knowledge and unfavorable attitudes toward 
oral nutritional supplements, despite displaying proactive practices. 
Considering the positive correlation among KAP, the provision of personalized 
medical education is essential for effective disease management.

China.

BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers collectively account for over 30% of 
global cancer-related mortality, with diet and nutrition playing crucial roles 
in their development. We investigated the burden, trends and disparities of GI 
cancers attributable to dietary risks.
METHODS: Data was collected from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021. 
Disease burden was measured by deaths and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs), along with age-standardized rates (ASRs). Joinpoint regression, with 
average annual percent changes (AAPCs) were used to assess temporal trends. 
ARIMA models were employed to project the ASRs till 2040.
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2021, the AAPC of the age-standardized mortality rate 
(ASMR) and age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR) of colorectal cancer (CRC) 
attributable to dietary risks were -0.87 (95% CI: -0.89, -0.84) and -0.88 (95% 
CI: -0.90, -0.86). Esophageal cancer showed the greatest declining rate, with 
ASRs declining more than 3% annually. The ASRs of stomach cancer decreased by 
more than 2% per year. The burden of stomach cancer and esophageal cancer were 
highest among low and low-middle SDI countries and regions, particularly East 
Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, respectively. High-SDI countries and regions showed 
the highest burden of CRC but the greatest declining rates. Future projections 
suggest constant decreasing burden for stomach cancer and CRC, but stable trends 
for esophageal cancer.
CONCLUSION: Diet-attributed GI cancer remains a significant public health 
challenge globally, especially among low SDI and lower-middle SDI countries. 
Given the disparity of risk exposures and disease burden, we recommend promoting 
screening practices and improving healthcare accessibility in low SDI countries, 
while emphasizing lifestyle modifications in higher SDI countries to combat this 
pressing issue.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative pneumonia is a common and serious complication 
following non-cardiac surgery. However, the relationship between preoperative 
albumin levels and postoperative pneumonia remains unclear in major non-cardiac 
surgeries, and the cut-off value for predicting postoperative pneumonia has yet 
to be determined.
METHODS: Data from patients who underwent non-cardiac surgery between January 1, 
2019, and December 31, 2022, were extracted from the institutional electronic 
medical records of Chongqing University Cancer Hospital. The primary exposure of 
interest was preoperative albumin levels, and the outcome was postoperative 
in-hospital pneumonia.
RESULTS: The results revealed a non-linear dose-response relationship between 
preoperative albumin levels and postoperative pneumonia. A 1 g/L increase in 
preoperative albumin levels was associated with a 4.4% reduction in adjusted 
odds ratio (aOR) of postoperative pneumonia (aOR: 0.956, 95% CI: 0.940-0.973, 
p < 0.001). Patients with preoperative albumin levels <38.9 g/L or between 38.9 
and 45.3 g/L had a 67.4 and 30.3% higher OR, respectively, compared to those 
with levels >45.3 g/L (aOR: 1.674, 95% CI: 1.313-2.135, p < 0.001; and aOR: 
1.303, 95% CI: 1.045-1.624, p = 0.019). Subgroup analyses indicated that the 
risk of developing pneumonia was more pronounced in younger, female, and 
healthier patients.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that preoperative albumin levels are 
significantly associated with the development of postoperative pneumonia in 
patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. A preoperative albumin level of 
<45.3 g/L may serve as a predictive marker for postoperative pneumonia.

Cancer is a predominant testimony of human departure in a global way. Current 
therapeutic strategies are not sufficient, and thereby exploring a new approach 
with high efficacy and influence is desired. The intention of this research is 
to distinguish a novel therapeutic burgeon in colon cancer plus employing the 
human mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) secretome as a new tool in colon cancer 
therapy. For this purpose, 30 pieces from patients afflicted with colon cancer 
were provided. The expressing level of IRSp53 was evaluated using quantitative 
real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Then, a coculture procedure utilizing six well plates 
transwell was applied. Since 72 h, tumor increment was surveyed in HT-29 cells 
treated by hAMSCs through the EGFR/c-Src/IRSp53/p-AKT/p-Stat3/cyclin D1 
signaling cascade. Our results indicated IRSp53 upregulation in patients 
suffering colon cancer and reduction of EGFR/c-Src/IRSp53/p-AKT/p-Stat3/cyclin 
D1 signaling pathway, which led to suppression of cell proliferation in the 
hAMSCs-treated HT-29 colon cancerous cells. We also found tumor growth 
suppression as well as IRSp53 expression in hAMSCs-treated HT-29 colon cancerous 
cell line using a 3D cell culturing technique. Our study's findings indicate 
that colon cancer therapy could benefit from targeting IRSp53 and that MSCs 
could be a valuable therapeutic option for stopping the proliferation of colon 
cancer cells. This could be achieved through the 
EGFR/c-Src/IRSp53/p-AKT/p-Stat3/cyclin D1 signaling pathway.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to evaluate whether prior Holmium 
laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) affects the diagnostic accuracy of 
multiparametric prostate MRI (mpMRI) with PI-RADS scoring for detecting 
clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) on biopsy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We queried the Northwestern Electronic Data Warehouse for 
all patients who underwent mpMRI followed by prostate biopsy. Demographic 
information, mpMRI data including PI-RADS score and biopsy data including 
Gleason grade (GG) were collected. Patients were stratified based on prior HoLEP 
and highest PI-RADS score of index lesion on MRI. The outcome of interest was 
detection of csPCa (GG ≥ 2) on biopsy. Logistic regression was performed to 
assess the impact of prior HoLEP on the detection of csPCa at time of biopsy.
RESULTS: A total of 8937 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 97 patients 
(1.1%) had prior HoLEP. HoLEP specimen revealed benign pathology in 38 patients 
(39.2%), GG1 in 32 patients (33.0%), GG2 in 25 patients (25.8%) and GG3 in 2 
patients (2.1%). Average time from HoLEP to mpMRI was 11.5 months. The 
post-HoLEP group had lower prostate volumes (median 25.0 vs. 47.0 cc; p < 0.001) 
and PSA density (median 0.06 vs. 0.12 ng/ml2; p < 0.001). Rates of csPCa 
detection based on highest PI-RADS score were comparable between control and 
HoLEP groups. Prior HoLEP did not significantly affect the detection of csPCa on 
multivariable analysis adjusting for age, race, PI-RADS, family history of PCa, 
and PSA density (OR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.60-1.57).
CONCLUSION: PI-RADS remains a reliable predictor of csPCa after HoLEP despite

The prognosis of patients with esophageal cancer is associated with nutrition. 
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of thoracic status on 
the prognosis of elderly patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) 
following radiotherapy. A retrospective analysis was performed of 123 elderly 
patients who underwent radiotherapy for ESCC and were admitted to The Affiliated 
Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University (Xuzhou, China) between October 2018 and 
October 2021. General clinical data and hematological data of the patients were 
collected before radiotherapy, with CT delineation of the 10-segment thoracic 
skeletal muscle volume by radiotherapy. The 10th thoracic vertebra level 
skeletal muscle volume index (T10 SMVI)=T10 skeletal muscle volume (cm3)/height2 
(m2). By dividing the patients according to the optimal cutoff value (using 
X-tile 3.6.1) into the T10 sarcopenia group and the T10 non-reduced skeletal 
muscle group (T10 non-sarcopenia group), intergroup comparisons were performed. 
The area under the curve was calculated from the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (ROC) to assess the prediction ability of T10 SMVI, the 
prognosis nutrition index (PNI) and the geriatric nutrition risk index (GNRI) 
for survival outcomes. Survival curves were drawn using the Kaplan-Meier method, 
and risk factors affecting progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival 
(OS) were analyzed by a Cox proportional hazards model. The results of the 
comparisons between the groups showed significant differences between the two 
groups in terms of age, body mass index, tumor site, Tumor-Node-Metastasis 
stage, initial treatment, hemoglobin level, GNRI and albumin level. The T10 
sarcopenia group exhibited significantly lower PFS and OS rates compared with 
the T10 non-sarcopenia group at all time points. The 1- and 3-year PFS rates of 
the T10 sarcopenia group compared with those of the T10 non-sarcopenia group 
were 50.8 and 73.4%, and 15.3 and 37.5%, respectively. The median PFS times for 
the two groups were 12.0 and 24.7 months, respectively. The 1- and 3-year OS 
rates were 81.4 and 95.3%, and 25.4 and 64.1%, respectively. The median OS time 
was 22.1 months in the T10 sarcopenia groups and not reached in the T10 
non-sarcopenia group. ROC curve analysis showed that T10 SMVI, PNI and GNRI all 
predicted the long-term survival of elderly patients with ESCC following 
radiotherapy, and that the predictive efficacy of T10 SMVI was higher than that 
of the hematological nutritional indicators PNI and GNRI, and was an independent 
influencing factor of OS. In conclusion, T10 SMVI can quantify the nutritional 
status of thoracic skeletal muscle and is more efficient than PNI and GNRI for 
predicting the prognosis of elderly patients with ESCC, providing a reference 
for clinical evaluation of skeletal muscle dystrophy. The present study pioneers 
the application of T10 SMVI derived from radiotherapy planning CT, offering a 
cost-effective, standardized method to assess skeletal muscle nutrition in 
elderly patients with ESCC.

Rectal cancer (RC) and endometrial cancer (EC) are among the most prevalent 
malignancies globally. However, their synchronous occurrence is rare. The 
current report presents a case of synchronous RC and EC, accompanied by a 
literature review, to provide insight into the diagnosis and management of such 
cases. A 54-year-old postmenopausal woman presented with intermittent vaginal 
bleeding and tenesmus. Diagnostic evaluations revealed synchronous endometrial 
adenocarcinoma involving the cervix of the cervix and rectal adenocarcinoma. 
Following a multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussion, an open radical resection 
was performed. Postoperative pathological examination confirmed the diagnoses. 
The patient is currently undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A 
total of five follow-up assessments have indicated that the patient's recovery 
is satisfactory. Synchronous carcinomas are uncommon, particularly those 
involving both the rectum and endometrium. The etiological factors include 
genetic mutations, obesity and hormonal influences. Early diagnosis is critical 
for treatment decision-making. Radical resection remains the cornerstone of 
treatment, although the prognosis of synchronous carcinomas is generally poorer 
than that of metachronous carcinomas. The present case highlights the importance 
of MDT collaboration in managing complex malignancies.

Prostate cancer (PCa) remains among the most common genitourinary tumors in 
elderly men, as PCa diagnosis and treatment remain major challenges. Liquid 
biopsy is a minimally invasive method that causes minor harm to patients with 
cancer. Peripheral blood protein biomarkers provide real-time PCa information 
and are easily accessible. The present review summarizes recent progress in 
identifying candidate peripheral blood protein biomarkers of PCa, including 
pentraxin-3, soluble E-cadherin, serum T-cell immunoglobulin, serum B- and 
T-lymphocyte attenuator, myeloid differentiation factor-2, pleiotrophin, spondin 
2, filamin A, soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, laminin subunit 
β-1, Golgi membrane protein 1, vitamin D-binding protein, tumor necrosis factor 
receptor superfamily member 9, activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule and 
trophoblastic cell-surface antigen. Notably, the present review summarizes and 
discusses the clinical value of these proteins in PCa prediction, diagnosis, 
prognosis and drug resistance monitoring. These emerging peripheral blood 
protein biomarkers are promising for improving PCa stratification and 
management.

The histopathological differentiation of rectal cancer (RC) is a key determinant 
of treatment strategy and prognosis, as tumors with varying differentiation 
demonstrate notable differences in therapeutic approach selection and survival 
outcomes. Consequently, accurate preoperative prediction of tumor 
differentiation is clinically essential for formulating initial surgical plans 
and adjuvant therapy strategies. The aim of the present study was to develop a 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics strategy that integrates 
features from both intratumoral and peritumoral (margin, 5 mm) regions to 
construct a non-invasive predictive model capable of distinguishing well 
differentiated RC (glandular structures ≥95%) from non-well differentiated RC. A 
retrospective analysis was performed using data from 224 patients with RC who 
underwent preoperative MRI. Radiomic features were extracted from T1-weighted 
images (T1WI), T2-weighted images (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of 
the tumor and peritumoral 5 mm. The adaptive synthetic technique was used to 
address class imbalance, and ReliefF was applied to select 20 features. A total 
of three machine learning algorithms, logistic regression, Light 
Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM) classifier and Gaussian Naive Bayes, were 
used to build MRI radiomic models combining the tumor and the peritumoral areas 
to predict pathological differentiation of RC. The models were evaluated by 
comparing the area under the curve (AUC) and binary classification metrics, with 
the best performing T1-LightGBM model selected. Subsequently, intratumoral and 
peritumoral and intratumoral (T1-LightGBM) models were established. 
Discriminative ability, calibration and clinical applicability were assessed 
using receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves and decision 
curves, with Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) analysis employed for 
interpretation. Among the nine models constructed using T1WI, T2WI and DWI from 
the tumor and 5-mm surrounding region, the AUC range was 0.510-0.756 across all 
validation sets. The T1-LightGBM model incorporating both tumor and peritumoral 
areas demonstrated the best performance for predicting pathological 
differentiation in RC, with an AUC of 0.756, accuracy of 0.700 and sensitivity 
of 0.707. SHAP analysis identified 
wavelet_HHH_glszm_Size_Zone_Non_Uniformity_Normalized as the most significant 
feature for predicting pathological differentiation and evaluating non-well 
differentiated patients. In conclusion, the integrated model employing the 
LightGBM algorithm on T1WI, which combined both intratumoral and 5-mm 
peritumoral features, demonstrated promising predictive potential for 
individualized RC differentiation.

Brain metastasis from ovarian cancer, particularly from clear cell ovarian 
cancer, is extremely rare and its pathology remains unclear. In the present 
study we treated a patient in whom this cancer was diagnosed after chemotherapy 
was administered for lung metastases. The patient, a 76-year-old woman, 
presented to Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Showa General Hospital 
(Tokyo, Japan) in February 2025 with sudden confusion and dizziness. The patient 
was surgically treated for ovarian cancer 20 years previously that displayed two 
clear histological types: Left clear cell and mucinous carcinomas and right 
endometrioid carcinoma. The patient was treated several times for recurrent 
metastases in the umbilicus and inguinal lymph nodes, of either clear cell or 
endometrioid carcinoma. The treatment administered varied from resection to 
radiotherapy. In 2016, lung metastasis was suspected, but the lesion size 
remained unchanged for several years. In 2019, the left inguinal lymph node 
again became swollen, and re-irradiation was performed for 2 weeks. In 2023, the 
right lung metastases grew larger and palliative radiotherapy was administered 
at another hospital. The right lung metastases continued to grow, and the 
patient returned to our hospital in May 2024 with a severe cough; metastasis 
from ovarian cancer was diagnosed. Paclitaxel-carboplatin chemotherapy was 
resumed for 6 months; the tumor grew slightly smaller, and the severe cough 
disappeared. The patient underwent maintenance olaparib therapy from January 
2025 for platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. After presenting to our 
department in February 2025, imaging studies revealed multiple substantial brain 
metastases and growth of the lung metastases. Palliative whole brain 
radiotherapy was administered, with the confusion improving slightly. The 
patient was transferred to a nursing home. Multiple pathological types coexisted 
in our patient, creating a complicated condition that, after various treatments 
were administered, was difficult to comprehend. Appropriate pathological 
diagnosis through biopsy, as well as comprehensive consideration of the 
treatment strategy based on the characteristics of the pathological type, is 
necessary.

Ribosome-binding protein 1: A multidimensional regulator of cancer progression 
and a novel target for precision therapy (Review).

Ribosome-binding protein 1 (RRBP1), a core regulator of endoplasmic 
reticulum-ribosome interactions, serves key roles in the development and 
progression of various cancer types by coordinating protein synthesis and 
organelle dynamic interactions. RRBP1 regulates the unfolded protein response by 
stabilizing glucose-regulated protein 78 and it enhances cancer cell adaptation 
to endoplasmic reticulum stress and chemotherapy. The stability of RRBP1 is 
regulated by N6-methyladenosine modification by methyltransferase-like 3 and 
deubiquitination by ubiquitin-specific processing protease 35. Furthermore, 
RRBP1 drives cellular anti-apoptosis mechanisms by activating pro-survival 
pathways such as TGF-β1/SMAD, PI3K/AKT and Notch or binding cyclic RNAs. By 
contrast, aberrant activation of kinase function and deubiquitination pathways 
by RRBP1 fusion genes [RRBP1-anaplastic lymphoma kinase, RRBP1-Raf1 
proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase and RRBP1-ubiquitin specific peptidase 
6] exacerbates malignant progression. Furthermore, the pleiotropic regulation of 
RRBP1 in neurodegeneration, cardiovascular homeostasis and bone metabolism 
highlights its environment-dependent functions. The present review identified 
the multidimensional regulatory network of RRBP1 in cancer and non-cancer 
systems to enhance the understanding of its molecular mechanism, demonstrated 
its broad regulatory value and potentially provided a key entry point to analyze 
the disease and develop precision therapies.

BACKGROUND: The involvement of radiation therapists (RTTs) in providing 
supportive care for patients facing sexual health challenges during radiotherapy 
for prostate cancer remains inconsistent in radiation therapy settings and 
under-researched in the South African context.
AIM: The aim was to develop a model framework to support the facilitation of 
men's sexual health for patients with prostate cancer by leveraging the role of 
RTTs.
SETTING: This study was conducted in the radiation therapy departments of two 
academic hospitals in Gauteng, South Africa.
METHODS: A theory-generating design consisting of four steps was used to develop 
the model framework: (1) identifying, defining and classifying the central 
concepts, (2) constructing relationship statements, (3) describing the model and 
(4) evaluating the model.
RESULTS: The central concept drawn from the empirical findings is the 
facilitation of supportive care for men's sexual health. A model was developed, 
described and evaluated.
CONCLUSION: The model framework has the potential to improve the inclusion of 
conversations by RTTs on sexual health as part of routine care for patients 
receiving radiotherapy for prostate cancer.
CONTRIBUTION: This article presents a model to promote patient counselling 
practices for RTTs that involve supportive care for men's sexual health.

Essential Updates 2023/2024: Recent Advances of Multimodal Approach in Patients 
for Gastric Cancer.

Gastric cancer remains a major global health burden, especially in East Asia. 
Recent years have brought significant advances in multimodal management, 
including surgery, perioperative chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and supportive 
care. This review summarizes key updates from 2023 to 2024, focusing on surgical 
innovations, perioperative systemic therapy, treatment strategies for stage IV 
disease, and nutritional interventions. In early and locally advanced disease, 
laparoscopic and robotic gastrectomy have become widely accepted in Asia, 
supported by large, randomized trials such as JCOG0912 and KLASS-02. 
Perioperative chemotherapy has become a global standard, with the FLOT regimen 
leading in the West and SOX, XELOX, or DOS emerging in Asia. Immunotherapy is 
increasingly incorporated into perioperative settings, with trials like 
KEYNOTE-585 and NEONIPIGA suggesting potential benefit in selected patients. For 
stage IV gastric cancer, systemic chemotherapy remains the mainstay, but 
conversion surgery and treatment of oligometastasis have shown promising results 
in selected cases. Trials such as JCOG1704 and AIO-FLOT5 are investigating 
optimal strategies. Perioperative nutrition has also gained attention, with oral 
nutritional supplements, ERAS protocols, and digital tools like continuous 
glucose monitoring (CGM) and AI-driven platforms enhancing outcomes. Looking 
ahead, integration of molecular biomarkers (e.g., HER2, PD-L1, MSI, ctDNA), 
precise staging, and multidisciplinary collaboration will be essential for 
personalized treatment. Ongoing trials and international cooperation are 
expected to further refine evidence-based approaches to gastric cancer care.

OBJECTIVE: The association between cholecystectomy and gastric cancer is 
undetermined. The objective of this study was to assess whether subjects with 
cholecystectomy are at risk of gastric cancer in Taiwan.
METHODS: This study used data from a cohort of 2 000 000 beneficiaries over a 
twelve-year period (2010-2021) from the Taiwan National Health Insurance 
Research Database. A total of 24 798 subjects aged 20 to 84 years underwent 
cholecystectomy, constituting the cholecystectomy group. An additional 68 781 
randomly selected subjects without a history of cholecystectomy were included as 
the noncholecystectomy group. The incidence of gastric cancer was measured in 
both groups through the end of 2021. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards 
regression model was used to assess the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for the risk of gastric cancer, adjusting for covariables.
RESULTS: The overall incidence rate of gastric cancer was 1.02 times higher in 
the cholecystectomy group than in the noncholecystectomy group; however, this 
difference was not statistically significant (5.70 vs. 5.60 per 10 000 
person-years, 95% CI = 0.80-1.31, p = 0.880). The multivariable Cox proportional 
hazards regression analysis demonstrated that the adjusted HR for gastric cancer 
in the cholecystectomy group compared to the noncholecystectomy group was 1.06, 
which was not statistically significant (95% CI = 0.83-1.36, p = 0.636).
CONCLUSION: This cohort study does not detect a significant association between 
cholecystectomy and gastric cancer risk.

BACKGROUND: Preoperative chemotherapy with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and 
docetaxel (DCF) is one of the neoadjuvant treatments for locally advanced 
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, the optimal number of DCF 
cycles remains unknown. This multi-institutional, randomized, phase II trial 
aimed to investigate the long-term survival outcomes of two versus three courses 
of DCF.
METHODS: A total of 180 patients with locally advanced ESCC from six 
institutions were randomly assigned to receive either two (N = 91) or three 
(N = 89) courses of DCF administered every 3 weeks prior to surgery. Long-term 
survival outcomes were compared between the two regimens.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two groups. The 
5-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates for the 
three and two course groups were 70.7% vs. 63.8% (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.91, 
p = 0.717) and 63.3% vs. 60.0% (HR = 0.94, p = 0.810) respectively, with no 
significant differences observed. The per-protocol analysis exhibited similar 
results, with OS rates of 71.1% vs. 68.8% (HR = 0.90, p = 0.702) and PFS rates 
of 63.6% vs. 65.4% (HR = 0.92, p = 0.773). Recurrence patterns were also similar 
between the groups. Subgroup analysis revealed that non-responders in the three 
course DCF group had significantly worse long-term survival outcomes, whereas 
the two course DCF group exhibited minimal trends in this regard. Conversely, 
patients aged < 65 years or those with favorable clinical responses in the three 
course group demonstrated improved long-term survival outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Two courses of preoperative DCF followed by radical esophagectomy 
can be one of the potential treatment strategies for locally advanced ESCC.

BACKGROUND: Preserving anorectal function while achieving oncological success is 
crucial in the treatment of lower rectal cancer near the anal canal. Despite 
advancements in laparoscopic surgery that facilitate anal preservation, 
post-operative anorectal dysfunction considerably affects quality of life. Both 
hand-sewn and stapled anastomoses are suitable options for tumors located 4-5 cm 
from the anus. However, evidence comparing the functional outcomes and 
complications associated with both anastomosis methods is lacking.
METHODS: This multicenter, single-arm prospective study included patients with 
cT1-T2/N0/M0 adenocarcinoma located 4-5 cm from the anal verge, scheduled for 
upfront laparoscopic surgery. Anorectal function, post-operative complications, 
urinary and male sexual function, and oncological outcomes were assessed using 
the validated scores.
RESULTS: A total of 135 patients were analyzed and divided into hand-sewn 
(n = 65) and stapled (n = 70) groups. The patient characteristics were similar, 
except for the tumors in the hand-sewn group located 1 mm closer to the anal 
verge. No significant differences were observed in the post-operative 
complications. Anorectal function, measured using Wexner scores, worsened at 
3 months postoperatively and gradually improved in both groups. At 3, 6, 12, 24, 
and 36 months, the stapled group consistently showed better Wexner scores than 
the hand-sewn group. Urinary function, sexual function, and oncological outcomes 
were similar in both groups.
CONCLUSION: Stapled anastomosis may provide better anorectal function with 
comparable safety and oncological outcomes to hand-sewn anastomosis. Therefore, 
stapled anastomosis may be preferred for tumors located 4-5 cm from the anal 
verge to ensure oncological safety.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered in the UMIN Clinical Trials 
Registry System (UMIN 000011750).

AIM: Appropriate reassessment of treatment response plays a crucial role in 
identifying optimal candidates for resection in neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) 
strategy for pancreatic cancer (PC); however, radiological evaluations are 
associated with limitations such as discrepancies with pathological response. 
Radiotherapy can induce inflammatory responses, potentially leading to an 
overestimation of residual tumor viability. This study explored the relationship 
between radiographic and pathological response assessments in NAT, focusing on 
the difference between neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and neoadjuvant 
chemoradiotherapy (NACRT).
METHODS: Patients with resectable, borderline resectable, and initially 
unresectable locally advanced PC who had undergone curative resection after NAT 
were included in this study. The correlation between radiological assessment 
using RECIST criteria and pathological response according to Evans 
classification in the NAC and NACRT groups was assessed.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of 
the findings of the RECIST assessment; however, the rate of favorable pathologic 
response (Evans ≥ IIb) in the NACRT group was significantly higher (p < 0.001). 
Furthermore, a comparison between the Evans grade for each RECIST criteria 
revealed a higher favorable pathologic response rate in the NACRT group among 
patients categorized as ""stable disease (SD)"" (p < 0.001). Some patients 
receiving NACRT who were initially classified as SD exhibited pathological 
complete response (Evans IV).
CONCLUSIONS: Discrepancies between radiographic and pathological response 
assessments in NAT for PC may differ between NAC and NACRT. In reassessment 
after NAT, the specific type of therapy administered, that is, NAC or NACRT, 
must be considered, especially in cases wherein radiographic alterations are 
minimal.

AIM: NCCN and ESMO guidelines recommend up to 6 months of perioperative 
oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for patients with resectable colorectal liver 
metastases (CRLM). However, the optimal sequencing and chemotherapy regimen 
remain unclear.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized phase II trial, HiSCO-01, to compare the 
outcomes of preoperative (Preop-group) and postoperative chemotherapy 
(Postop-group) with eight cycles of CAPOX plus bevacizumab (CAPOX-Bev) in 
patients with resectable CRLM. The primary endpoint was the treatment compliance 
rate (TCR), defined as the percentage of patients who received at least six 
cycles of CAPOX-Bev and underwent R0 resection.
RESULTS: Of the 81 patients enrolled, 76 patients were eligible. TCR was 89.2% 
in Preop-group and 71.8% in Postop-group (p = 0.06). The overall incidence of 
chemotherapy-related Grade 3 or higher adverse events was similar between the 
two groups. The postoperative complication rate was comparable except that 
biliary fistula developed significantly higher in Postop-group. The 3-year 
progression-free survival and 5-year overall survival rates were 32.2% and 60.5% 
in Preop-group, respectively, and 38.5% and 57.2% in Postop-group, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Both preoperative and postoperative CAPOX-Bev were safely 
administered, and preoperative chemotherapy showed numerically higher TCR than 
postoperative chemotherapy. This multimodal approach is highly promising for 
treating resectable CRLM.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between tumor location and lymphatic flow is 
generally known to affect the efficacy of lymph node dissection, but the 
specific impact in rectal cancer remains unclear. This study investigated the 
frequency of lymph node metastasis (LNM) and the efficacy of lymph node 
dissection based on tumor location.
METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 882 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma 
who underwent total mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection. 
Tumors were categorized by primary site into Ra (from the lower edge of S2 to 
the peritoneal reflection, n = 95), Rb (from the peritoneal reflection to the 
upper edge of the anal canal, n = 713), and P (anal canal, n = 74). LNM rates 
and dissection efficacy were assessed at each station. The therapeutic value 
index (TVI) was calculated as the LNM rate multiplied by the 5-year overall 
survival rate.
RESULTS: LNM was observed in 447 patients (50.7%). Mesenteric LNM rates and the 
TVI were higher for tumors located more orally (49.5% and 43 for Ra, 46.1% and 
29.7 for Rb, 43.2% and 17.6 for P), whereas lateral LNM rates and the TVI were 
higher for tumors located more anally (7.4% and 3.7 for Ra, 16.3% and 8 for Rb, 
29.7% and 14.1 for P). Regardless of tumor location, the TVI in the lateral 
region was high in the distal internal iliac and obturator areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Tumor location influences LNM frequency and lymph node dissection 
efficacy in rectal cancer. Treatment strategies should be individualized based 
on tumor location to improve outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Although the number of older people is increasing, there is a lack 
of evidence and insufficient consensus regarding postoperative complications and 
survival in older cancer patients. In this study, we conducted a literature 
search and systematic review focusing on the outcomes after surgery for older 
cancer patients.
METHODS: Literature focusing on surgical treatment for older cancer patients was 
extracted from Japanese clinical practice guidelines for gastric cancer, lung 
cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, and gynecological cancers (uterine 
body, uterine cervix, ovary, and external genitalia and vagina). Outcomes were 
reviewed, and committee members determined the strength of evidence on a 
four-point scale (A to D), with A being the highest and D being the lowest.
RESULTS: Older cancer patients tend to have a higher incidence of postoperative 
complications and postoperative syndromes, and their expected survival is 
generally shorter compared to non-older patients. When extensive surgeries such 
as para-aortic lymph node dissection and/or resection with other organs are 
performed for older cancer patients, the postoperative mortality rates tend to 
increase compared to non-older patients.
CONCLUSION: Surgical treatments for older cancer patients tend to result in 
higher morbidity even when the patients are in good health status. Nevertheless, 
there is still a possibility that a certain fraction of the patients achieve 
treatment outcomes comparable to those of non-older patients. Therefore, 
surgical indication and procedure for older cancer patients should be carefully 
determined based on surgical invasiveness and patient tolerability.

Lateral lymph node dissection (LLND) is recognized as an effective treatment for 
reducing local recurrence in patients with locally advanced lower rectal cancer. 
However, the lack of standardization in techniques and anatomical landmarks 
remains a concern, as it may complicate the assessment of treatment efficacy. To 
address this, the Japan Society of Gastroenterological Surgery (JSGS) held a 
consensus meeting during the 77th General Meeting of the JSGS to standardize 
LLND techniques. In this meeting, essential anatomical landmarks for LLND were 
confirmed. The primary regions targeted for dissection include lymph nodes in 
the obturator region (designated as station 283) and those in the internal iliac 
region (designated as station 263). The medial boundary of LLND is defined by 
the uretero-hypogastric fascia, whereas the vesico-hypogastric fascia 
constitutes the central plane of dissection and serves as the medial boundary of 
station 283. Indicators of successful LLND completion include exposure of the 
sciatic nerve (lumbosacral trunk) at the bottom of the dissection, as well as 
exposure of the inferior vesical vessels, internal pudendal artery, and 
coccygeus muscle, confirming the thoroughness of the caudal part of the 
dissection. The consensus reached in this meeting, along with findings from 
several published reports cited in this report, is expected to contribute to the 
standardization of LLND quality.

AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of arterial contact angle on 
survival outcomes in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer 
(BRPC) undergoing neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) and surgical resection.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 84 patients with BRPC with arterial contact 
who underwent NAT followed by surgery at the Shizuoka Cancer Center (2012-2021) 
was conducted. They were classified into two groups according to the arterial 
contact angle measured using preoperative computed tomography: < 90° (n = 34, 
smaller-angle group) and ≥ 90° (n = 50, larger-angle group). Surgical, 
pathological, and survival outcomes were compared between the groups. 
Multivariate analysis identified independent prognostic factors for overall 
survival (OS).
RESULTS: The larger-angle group had a significantly higher R1 resection rate 
(28% vs. 3%, p = 0.003) and worse OS (median 38.0 vs. 72.6 months, p = 0.045) 
than the smaller-angle group. Recurrence-free survival was also significantly 
shorter in the larger-angle group (median 15.1 vs. 31.1 months, p = 0.044). 
Multivariate analysis identified an arterial contact angle ≥ 90° as an 
independent prognostic factor for the OS (hazard ratio 1.97, p = 0.035). The 
recurrence rate was higher in the larger-angle group (78% vs. 53%, p = 0.019), 
with a trend toward increased local recurrence and liver metastases.
CONCLUSION: An arterial contact angle of ≥ 90° was associated with higher R1 
resection rates, increased recurrence, and poor survival in patients with BRPC. 
More aggressive multimodal treatment strategies, including extended NAT, may be 
necessary to improve the outcomes in these high-risk patients.

BACKGROUND: Excess intraoperative fluid can increase postoperative complications 
in elective surgery, but data on esophageal cancer surgery remain limited. We 
examined the relationship between intraoperative fluid volume and short-term 
outcomes after minimally invasive esophagectomy.
METHODS: This study analyzed 8782 patients who underwent minimally invasive 
esophagectomy between 2018 and 2022 using data from the National Clinical 
Database in Japan. Multivariable logistic regression and smoothing spline models 
were used to assess associations between intraoperative fluid volume and 
short-term outcomes.
RESULTS: The median intraoperative fluid volume was 3700 mL (3000-4500) or 
7.8 mL/kg/h (6.2-9.7). Postoperatively, pneumonia occurred in 13.6% of patients, 
anastomotic leakage in 13.1%, prolonged ventilation (> 48 h) in 3.5%, and 
surgery-related mortality in 0.8%. Patients were classified into tertiles (low, 
middle, high) based on fluid volume. A high intraoperative fluid volume was 
significantly associated with pneumonia (risk-adjusted odds ratio 1.22, 95% 
confidence interval 1.04-1.45, p = 0.02). However, there was no significant 
association with anastomotic leakage, prolonged ventilation, or surgery-related 
mortality. Smoothing spline model showed a positive monotonic relationship 
between fluid volume and the risk-adjusted odds ratio for pneumonia, prolonged 
ventilation, and surgery-related mortality, whereas anastomotic leakage showed a 
negative monotonic trend.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher intraoperative fluid volume was significantly associated 
with an increased risk of pneumonia after minimally invasive esophagectomy.

BACKGROUND: Advances in diagnostic and surgical techniques have improved 
survival rates for gastric cancer patients. However, gastrectomy involving 
ghrelin-secreting regions of the upper gastric greater curvature can lead to 
long-term endocrine and metabolic disturbances, including reductions in serum 
ghrelin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), potentially contributing to 
skeletal muscle and bone mineral loss.
METHODS: This prospective observational study included 35 gastric cancer 
patients who underwent gastrectomy between 2016 and 2018, with follow-up for 
3-5 years. Patients were categorized into ghrelin-depleted (total or proximal 
gastrectomy) and ghrelin-preserved (distal gastrectomy) groups. Serum 
desacyl-ghrelin, IGF-1, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 
(IGFBP-3) levels were measured, and skeletal muscle mass and bone mineral 
content were assessed.
RESULTS: The ghrelin-depleted group exhibited significantly lower serum 
desacyl-ghrelin (56.9 ± 27.9 vs. 111.2 ± 54.8 fmol/mL, p = 0.0006), skeletal 
muscle mass (87.7% ± 2.1% vs. 95.1% ± 2.4%, p = 0.0229), and bone mineral 
content (90.9% ± 13.0% vs. 99.5% ± 6.3%, p = 0.0249). Additionally, IGF-1 levels 
showed a significant positive correlation with skeletal muscle mass (r = 0.53, 
p = 0.020). While the correlation between IGF-1 and bone mineral content did not 
reach statistical significance, a positive trend was observed (r = 0.44, 
p = 0.062).
CONCLUSION: Gastrectomy involving resection of ghrelin-rich regions leads to 
long-term reductions in serum desacyl-ghrelin levels, adversely affecting 
skeletal muscle mass and bone mineral content. These findings highlight the 
importance of considering the endocrine consequences when selecting surgical 
procedures.

BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has been extensively developed for 
locally advanced gastric cancer (GC). In Asia, S-1-based regimens, such as 
docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and S-1 (DOS) and S-1 and oxaliplatin (SOX), are 
expected to become the standard of care. However, the data on the significance 
of NAC for older patients with advanced GC remains scarce. Therefore, this study 
aimed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of NAC in older patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data from patients with cStage II-III 
locally advanced GC who underwent radical surgery at our institution between 
2015 and 2021. This study included three groups: 56 patients with NAC and age 
< 75 years (NAC-Young group), 20 with NAC and age ≥ 75 years (NAC-Older group), 
and 46 without NAC and age ≥ 75 years (OP-Older group). Patient backgrounds, 
adverse events of NAC, and prognoses were compared among the groups.
RESULTS: Compared with the NAC-Young group, the NAC-Older group was more likely 
to receive the SOX regimen and reduced initial doses, but there was no 
significant difference in the incidence of adverse events of NAC and prognosis. 
Compared to the OP-Older group, overall survival and cancer-specific survival 
tended to be better in the NAC-Older group at cStage III. Moreover, for patients 
with cStage III and ECOG-PS 0, cancer-specific survival was significantly better 
in the NAC-Older group compared to the OP-Older group (p = 0.030).
CONCLUSIONS: NAC with S-1-based regimens is a feasible and effective treatment 
option for older patients with GC with advanced-stage disease and good overall 
condition.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Fluorescence imaging has emerged as a valuable adjunct 
in gastric surgery, enhancing resection precision and oncologic outcomes. 
However, the use of indocyanine green (ICG) remains controversial due to 
uncertainties in efficacy and administration. A lack of standardized protocols 
persists. This review summarizes current applications of fluorescence in gastric 
cancer surgery, outlining existing challenges and future research needs.
METHODS: A systematic PubMed search (2004-2024) was conducted using keywords 
such as ""indocyanine green,"" ""carbon particle,"" ""blue dye,"" ""gastric cancer,"" 
and ""gastroesophageal junction cancer"" to identify and review key uses of 
fluorescence agents in gastrointestinal malignancies.
KEY FINDINGS: Fluorescence-guided imaging aids intraoperative tumor 
localization, shortens operative time, and enhances lymph node (LN) yield, 
improving staging accuracy. Its role in sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection is 
still under debate due to false negatives. ICG fluorescence angiography (ICG-FA) 
may lower anastomotic leak rates, though strong supporting evidence is limited. 
No consensus exists regarding ICG dosage, timing, or delivery method.
CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence supports the safety and efficacy of fluorescence 
imaging in gastrointestinal surgery, with promising outcomes in precision and 
staging. However, uniform protocols for fluorescence use are urgently needed. 
Future studies should aim to standardize administration and optimize clinical 
implementation to fully realize its benefits.

AIM: To verify whether postoperative prognostic nutritional index is a useful 
prognostic factor in patients with gastric cancer.
METHODS: This study included 1738 consecutive patients with gastric cancer who 
underwent radical gastrectomy at our institution from January 2004 to December 
2018. The sensitivity and specificity of white blood cell, neutrophil, 
lymphocyte, monocyte, and platelet counts, C-reactive protein, hemoglobin, and 
albumin levels, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, 
C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and 
prognostic nutritional index on postoperative Days 1 and 3 in predicting 
recurrence were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves. 
Recurrence-free survival and overall survival were compared between the normal 
and high fibrinogen groups.
RESULTS: After applying the inclusion criteria, 1635 eligible patients were 
included in the analysis. The prognostic nutritional index on postoperative Day 
1 attained the highest area under the curve (0.699). Overall survival and 
recurrence-free survival in the low prognostic nutritional index on 
postoperative Day 1 group were significantly poorer than those in the high 
prognostic nutritional index on postoperative Day 1 group (log-rank test, both 
p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that prognostic nutritional index 
on postoperative Day 1 was a significantly independent prognostic factor for 
overall survival and recurrence-free survival (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: Postoperative prognostic nutritional index was a useful prognostic 
factor in patients with gastric cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Oral leukoplakia (OLK) is an oral precancerous lesion associated 
with oral microbiome dysbiosis and systemic inflammation. However, the 
longitudinal changes of the microbiome and its causal relationship with 
inflammation remain unclear, and traditional sequencing struggles to detect 
low-biomass samples.
METHODS: A 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO)-induced rat OLK model was used. The 
oral microbiome was analyzed via 2bRAD-M sequencing; serum levels of tumor 
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured. Additionally, 
functional pathway analysis of the microbiome and its correlation with 
inflammation were conducted.
RESULTS: In OLK, we observed significant shifts in the oral microbial diversity, 
marked by elevated abundances of Streptococcus, Glaesserella, and Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa. Moreover, shifts in the microbiota precede the manifestation of 
clinical symptoms of OLK. Functional pathway analysis highlighted enrichment in 
metabolism, quorum sensing, and cancer-associated microRNA pathways. Serum 
levels of inflammatory markers (TNF-α and IL-6) were significantly elevated in 
OLK and significantly correlated with specific bacterial taxa.
DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the utility of 2bRAD-M sequencing in 
overcoming traditional metagenomic limitations, offering a high-resolution view 
of microbiome dynamics in low-biomass environments such as the oral mucosa. 
These findings establish the oral microbiota as candidate early biomarkers for 
OLK screening and prevention, opening avenues for precision diagnostics and 
targeted therapies to mitigate cancer risk associated with OLK.

Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases despite aggressive therapeutics. This is 
due in part to the evolving tumor microenvironment (TME), which provide tumor 
supportive cues that promote tumor adaptation and progression. Emerging studies 
highlight the significant role of the biophysical characteristics in the TME in 
modulating all aspects of cancer aggressive and spread. With the advance of 
bioengineering platforms, deeper investigations into the impact of these 
biophysical features on cancer progression are being conducted with a growing 
appreciation of the intratumoral compression that underlie many of the 
biophysical changes. Intratumoral compression emerges early in tumor development 
and increases in magnitude as the tumor rapidly expands against itself and its 
surrounding tissue. This stress has effects on both the cancer cells and 
biophysical aspects of the TME, including hypoxia, shear stress, extracellular 
matrix (ECM) remodeling, and substrate stiffness. This creates a physically 
dense, pro-malignant environment that can both promote metastatic phenotypes and 
spread but also present biophysical barriers for immune cell infiltration. This 
review will analyze the effect of compressive stress on the TME, cancer cells, 
and on confined migration of cancer and immune populations.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the predominant cause of cancer-related mortality 
globally. Computed tomography (CT) scanning is employed to enhance the early 
diagnosis of lung cancer by screening for risk factors. This study aimed to 
examine the impact of CT scanning on the incidence of lung cancer detection in a 
group with unidentified risk factors for the disease.
METHODS: Data from two patient cohorts were analyzed: the ""study group,"" 
comprising individuals with a CT-detected pulmonary nodule of ≥ 8 mm and unknown 
lung cancer risk factors, and the ""control group,"" consisting of individuals 
with a pulmonary nodule of ≥ 8 mm identified by CT scan due to known lung cancer 
risk factors.
RESULTS: No significant difference was seen between the groups regarding 
malignancy frequency (p=0.155) and early-stage occurrence (p=0.842).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of lung cancer in pulmonary nodules measuring ≥ 8 mm 
is not influenced by the presence of lung cancer risk factors.

BACKGROUND: The most common cancer in women worldwide, breast cancer most often 
metastasizes to the bone. Improved chemo- and radiotherapies and novel molecular 
therapies have prolonged survival in women with osseous metastatic breast 
cancer, but spinal metastases often cause cord compression that degrades their 
functional independence.
PURPOSE: In women with breast cancer metastasized to the spine, we sought to (1) 
identify independent predictors of a functional deficit 3 months after surgical 
management and (2) assess the utility of existing metrics at highlighting 
patients at risk of a postoperative functional deficit.
METHODS: We performed a single-institution, retrospective analysis of 92 
patients meeting our inclusion criteria between 2004 and 2021. Patients were 
classified by 3-month postoperative Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
scores into good/independent (ECOG 0 to 2) and poor/dependent (ECOG 3 to 5) 
functional outcome groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed 
to identify patient and tumor factors associated with good vs. poor 3-month ECOG 
scores.
RESULTS: Preoperative use of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) was 
significantly associated with good postoperative functional outcomes. Poor 
preoperative function, the presence of visceral metastases at the time of 
surgery, and triple-negative primary or metastatic tumor status were 
independently associated with poor 3-month postoperative function. Host 
characteristics, sociodemographic factors, and indicators of surgical 
complexity, including estimated blood loss, front/back surgery, and corpectomy 
reconstruction, were not associated with 3-month ECOG score. A multivariate 
model including these significant univariate associations and normalized for 
patient demographics identified preoperative SERM use, poor preoperative 
function (ECOG score), and triple-negative primary or metastatic tumor status as 
independently associated with functional status 3 months after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective analysis found that preoperative SERM use was 
significantly associated with improved postoperative functional outcomes, while 
poor preoperative function and triple-negative tumor status were significantly 
associated with poor function 3 months after surgery. These factors may serve as 
indicators of function and independence after surgery for patients with 
metastatic breast cancer to the spine.

Although the demand for novel immunotherapies to treat companion dogs with 
spontaneously developing cancer is increasing in high-income countries, most 
options remain inaccessible. Dogs host a complete and functional immune system 
reacting to the presence of their tumor. As for humans, many canine neoplasms 
were shown to overexpress programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), an immune 
checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) known to downregulate cytotoxic T cell activity upon 
interaction with its ligand PD-1. In this study, we used alpaca-derived single 
domain antibodies (sdAbs), also known as nanobodies (Nbs), to develop new ICI 
targeting canine PD-L1. We selected several clones binding to both recombinant 
soluble and cell membrane-anchored cPD-L1 forms. Next, their cPD-L1-binding 
affinities, cPD-1/cPD-L1-blocking abilities and epitope relationships were 
determined. Most effective Nbs binding to non-overlapping epitopes were combined 
as biparatopic Fc fusions to provide additional functionalities and improve 
their efficacy. Remarkably, all engineered Nb constructs efficiently interfered 
with the cPD-1/cPD-L1-induced signaling pathway, with some multivalent molecules 
displaying inhibitory concentrations reaching low picomolar range. Moreover, 
Fc-competent Nb constructs were also shown to induce tumor cell death by 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity using human or canine models. 
Finally, using donor canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), best 
candidates were favorably compared with atezolizumab in a Staphylococcal 
enterotoxin B (SEB)-based interferon-γ (IFNγ) secretion assay.

INTRODUCTION: Detailed, comprehensive, and timely reporting on cancer incidence, 
mortality, and associated burdens is essential for understanding the evolving 
trends of this complex disease. This study aims to evaluate the burdens of 34 
types of cancer across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021, 
incorporating the latest epidemiological data to provide a framework for policy 
discussions, resource allocation, and research prioritization.
METHODS: Using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, we 
analyzed 34 cancer types across 204 countries from 1990 to 2021, stratifying by 
age, sex, region, and sociodemographic index (SDI) and projecting future trends 
using a Bayesian age-period-cohort model.
RESULTS: In 2021, there were 23.57 million new cases and 9.83 million deaths, 
with a global age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of 275.2 per 100,000 and 
age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) of 115.8 per 100,000. Cancer incidence 
has risen 2.3-fold, with the ASIR increasing by 8.8% and the ASMR decreasing by 
21.5% over the period since 1990. Tracheal, bronchial, and lung cancer, 
colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, and breast cancer were the leading causes of 
mortality, while nonmelanoma skin cancer, tracheal, bronchial, and lung cancer, 
colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer had the highest incidence 
rates. Men had 1.2 times higher incidence and 1.3 times higher mortality than 
women. North America had the highest ASIR, while East Africa had the highest 
ASMR. High-SDI countries had higher incidence, whereas low-SDI countries bore 
the highest mortality burden. By 2050, cancer incidence is projected to exceed 
26 million cases, with prevalence surpassing 100 million, while mortality is 
expected to decline by 14.8%.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite advances in detection and treatment, the rising global 
cancer burden and persistent disparities highlight the urgent need for equitable 
prevention, early diagnosis, and resource allocation to reduce cancer mortality 
worldwide. The potential long-term impact of COVID-19 on cancer development and 
progression remains unclear, warranting further investigation in the 
post-pandemic era.

The CILLO-E Hypothesis: Erythrocyte-Driven Acidosis and Early Eryptosis as 
Drivers of Cancer-Associated Anemia.

University, Sivas, Türkiye.

BACKGROUND: The tumor microenvironment (TME) is characterized by high lactate 
and proton accumulation resulting from glycolytic metabolism. While acidosis is 
known to influence immune and stromal cells, its direct effects on 
erythrocytes-the most abundant circulating cells-remain underexplored.
METHODS: An integrative review of cancer metabolism, erythrocyte physiology, and 
lactate transport systems was conducted using PubMed and Web of Science. From 
this synthesis, the CILLO-E hypothesis (Cancer-Induced Lactate Load on 
Erythrocytes) was formulated.
RESULTS: The hypothesis proposes that lactate and protons enter erythrocytes via 
MCT1, leading to intracellular acidification. This process disrupts glycolytic 
enzymes, reduces ATP production, and impairs Na+/K+-ATPase and Ca²+-ATPase 
activity. Energy depletion causes Ca²+ overload, which activates scramblase and 
inhibits flippase, resulting in PS exposure and premature eryptosis. In 
parallel, reduced 2,3-BPG synthesis alters hemoglobin-oxygen affinity, 
exacerbating hypoxia. Together, these mechanisms provide a biochemical 
explanation for the normocytic-normochromic anemia frequently observed in 
cancer. Importantly, cancer-associated anemia is multifactorial, and CILLO-E 
should be viewed not as a comprehensive explanation but as a complementary 
mechanism acting through lactate-induced erythrocyte dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: The CILLO-E hypothesis reframes erythrocytes as active metabolic 
targets in the TME rather than passive oxygen carriers. By linking 
lactate-driven metabolic stress to erythrocyte dysfunction, anemia, and systemic 
hypoxia, it suggests a feedback loop that promotes tumor progression and 
highlights opportunities for erythrocyte-based biomarkers and therapeutic 
strategies.

INTRODUCTION: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 13-15% of all lung 
malignancies and remains a highly aggressive disease with limited therapeutic 
progress, particularly in rural settings. Despite advances such as immune 
checkpoint inhibitors and multimodal therapy, real-world evidence on treatment 
utilization and survival outcomes in developing regions is scarce. This 
retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate survival patterns and multimodal 
therapy use in SCLC patients from a Chinese countryside hospital.
METHODS: A total of 132 patients diagnosed with SCLC at Weifang Yidu Central 
Hospital between 2014 and 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were 
classified as limited-stage (LS) or extensive-stage (ES) using the Veterans 
Administration Lung Study Group (VALG) system. Clinical data, including 
demographics, treatment regimens, and outcomes, were collected. Overall survival 
(OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method, and subgroup analyses assessed the effects of platinum sensitivity, 
prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), and 
palliative radiotherapy.
RESULTS: Of 132 patients (64 LS-SCLC, 68 ES-SCLC), most received first-line 
platinum-etoposide regimens, with diminishing treatment continuity in later 
lines due to cumulative toxicities. Median OS was significantly longer in 
LS-SCLC than ES-SCLC (50.2 vs. 16.8 months, p<0.05). PCI reduced brain 
metastases (0% vs. 27%) and improved OS (50.2 vs. 36.4 months; HR=0.47), though 
not statistically significant. CCRT achieved longer OS than sequential 
chemoradiotherapy (54.9 vs. 50.2 months; HR=0.54). In second-line therapy, 
platinum-sensitive patients benefited from platinum rechallenge (median OS 17.7 
vs. 12.5 months, p<0.05), whereas platinum-resistant patients showed no 
improvement. Palliative radiotherapy in ES-SCLC prolonged PFS (16.1 vs. 7.8 
months) and OS (30.2 vs. 16.1 months) with near-significant trends (HR≈0.5).
DISCUSSION: This real-world study confirms that concurrent chemoradiotherapy 
(CCRT) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) confer survival advantages in 
LS-SCLC, while palliative radiotherapy yields potential benefits in ES-SCLC. 
Platinum sensitivity remains a crucial predictor of second-line treatment 
efficacy, supporting reintroduction of platinum in sensitive relapses per 
guideline recommendations. Conversely, irinotecan-lobaplatin combinations 
provided limited benefit. Findings emphasize the need for personalized treatment 
sequencing and improved access to standardized multimodal care in rural 
healthcare settings.

​BACKGROUND: The relationship between serum lipid profiles and hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) risk remains controversial. We aimed to clarify this association 
through a systematic meta-analysis of epidemiological studies.
​METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and 
Web of Science (2000-May 2023) for prospective, retrospective, and 
cross-sectional studies reporting adjusted risk estimates (HR/OR) of HCC 
associated with serum lipids. Pooled effect sizes were calculated using 
random-effects models, with heterogeneity assessed via Cochran's Q and I² 
statistics.
​RESULTS: Twenty-three studies (16 cohorts, 7 case-control) involving 1.2 
million participants ((including both healthy individuals and patients with 
chronic liver diseases)​​) were included. Elevated serum total cholesterol (TC) 
was inversely associated with HCC risk (HR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.64-0.78; I²=0%). 
Similar protective effects were observed for high LDL (HR = 0.46, 95% CI: 
0.36-0.59; I²=97%), triglycerides (HR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.62-0.99; I²=94%), and 
dyslipidemia (HR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.50-0.83; I²=81%). No significant association 
was found for high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Sensitivity analyses confirmed 
robustness for TC and LDL, while TG results were influenced by a single study.
​CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis provides robust evidence that elevated serum 
cholesterol and specific lipid subfractions are associated with reduced HCC 
risk. Further mechanistic studies are warranted to elucidate the role of lipid 
metabolism in hepatocarcinogenesis.

Zhejiang, China.

INTRODUCTION: This study was conducted to evaluate any association between 
extraprostatic extension (EPE) grade with the risk of pelvic lymph node 
metastasis (PLNM) of prostate cancer (PCa).
METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging data, as well as clinical and pathological 
data were collected for 317 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) along 
with pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) at Ningbo Yinzhou No. 2 Hospital from 
January 2019 to January 2024. The collected magnetic resonance images were 
scored employing the EPE grade. The factors associated with PLNM were analyzed 
through Chi-square test and independent sample T-test. Independent risk factors 
associated with PLNM were identified through Multivariate analyses. The area 
under the curve (AUC) was calculated and the diagnostic performance of the model 
was assessed by analyzing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The 
clinical net benefit of EPE grade, biopsy positive rate, and the combined model 
were examined using clinical decision curves.
RESULTS: Among 317 patients, 33had PLNM. Multifactor analysis demonstrated EPE 
grade and biopsy positive rate as independent risk factors for PLNM of PCa. The 
AUC of EPE grade and biopsy positive rate was, respectively, 0.879 and 0.877, 
and the diagnostic efficiency of PLNM between the two was not statistically 
significant (P > 0.05). However, when the two approaches were combined, the 
diagnostic efficiency improved significantly, and the AUC increased to 0.921 (P 
< 0.05). The analysis of the clinical decision curve revealed a significantly 
higher clinical net benefit of the combined model than that of the EPE grade and 
biopsy positive rate.
CONCLUSIONS: The EPE grade and biopsy positive rate exhibit an independent 
correlation with PLNM of PCa. In addition, the combination of the two can 
significantly enhance the accuracy of predicting PLNM of PCa.

INTRODUCTION: Chemoradiotherapy followed by durvalumab is a potentially curative 
treatment for unresectable, locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 
but clinical outcomes remain highly variable. Identifying robust biomarkers is 
essential to refine treatment selection and enable risk-adapted strategies.
METHODS: In this multicenter, prospective cohort study, 86 patients with 
unresectable stage III NSCLC were treated with chemoradiotherapy followed by 
durvalumab. Baseline plasma samples underwent genomic profiling and blood tumor 
mutational burden (bTMB) assessment using targeted next-generation sequencing. 
Associations between bTMB, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) alterations, PD-L1 
expression, and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated using a one-sided 
significance threshold of p < 0.10.
RESULTS: Median PFS was 18.9 months (95% CI: 14.7-not reached), and median bTMB 
was 6.6 mutations/megabase. In univariable analysis, high bTMB was associated 
with longer PFS using both the prespecified 8.5 mut/Mb cut-off (HR: 0.65; p = 
0.088) and the median 6.6 mut/Mb cut-off (HR: 0.52; p = 0.016). PD-L1 ≥ 1% was 
associated with longer PFS (HR: 0.38; p = 0.0003), while STK11, KEAP1, or NFE2L2 
mutations in ctDNA were linked to shorter PFS (HR: 1.84; p = 0.040). In 
multivariable analysis, PD-L1 remained significantly associated with PFS in both 
models, while bTMB and STK11/KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutations were significant using the 
6.6 mut/Mb cut-off.
CONCLUSION: High bTMB, PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, and absence of STK11/KEAP1/NFE2L2 
mutations were associated with longer PFS. These findings support integrating 
multiple biomarkers to improve risk stratification and personalize treatment in 
unresectable stage III NSCLC.

Case Report: Analysis of short-term clinical efficacy of trilaciclib in patients 
with advanced lung neuroendocrine carcinoma undergoing chemotherapy.

Zeng Y(1), Lin N(1).

Author information:

Guizhou, China.

Lung neuroendocrine carcinoma is a rare heterogeneous tumor with the 
characteristics of high invasiveness, low incidence, and poor survival 
prognosis. Currently, there is a lack of effective treatment measures, and 
treatment strategies are mostly extrapolated from small cell lung cancer and 
non-small cell lung cancer protocols. Studies have shown that more than 55% of 
patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer experience grade 3 or 
higher myelosuppression after receiving platinum/etoposide-containing 
chemotherapy, including neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. 
myelosuppression can also increase the risks of infection, bleeding, etc. Severe 
myelosuppression may delay treatment, reduce dosage, stop medication, and cause 
other risks that affect tumor prognosis. The results of the study showed that 
the incidence of grade 3 or higher myelosuppression in patients using 
trilaciclib (a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 [CDK4/6] inhibitor) when receiving 
platinum-based chemotherapy was significantly lower than that in patients who 
did not use this drug. In addition, the use of trilaciclib did not affect the 
anti-tumor effects of chemotherapy and immunotherapy agents during the 
chemotherapy cycle. This study aimed to explore the effect of trilaciclib on 
chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression (CIM) in patients with pulmonary 
neuroendocrine carcinoma undergoing chemotherapy, and to provide a reference for 
improving patients' treatment tolerance and quality of life in clinical 
practice.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the impact of using suture ligatures and 
avoiding thermal injury (hereinafter referred to as the modified measures) on 
clinical outcomes after pulmonary segmentectomy.
METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted, involving 100 
patients who met the inclusion criteria and were scheduled for single-port 
video-assisted thoracoscopic lung segmentectomy at our hospital from May 1, 
2024, to May 31, 2025. The patients were randomly divided into an experimental 
group (modified measures) and a control group (traditional lung segmentectomy), 
followed by undergoing single-port thoracoscopic lung segmentectomy. A 
questionnaire was used to evaluate the incidence of cough and the intensity of 
cough symptoms at 2, 4, and 8 weeks postoperatively, along with related 
intraoperative and postoperative indicators, to verify the effectiveness and 
safety of the improved intraoperative bronchial protection measures in 
single-port thoracoscopic lung segmentectomy.
RESULTS: The modified measures significantly reduced the incidence of cough and 
symptom intensity at 2, 4, and 8 weeks postoperative. The cough scores in the 
experimental group were significantly better than those in the control group, 
with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). Analysis of 
intraoperative and postoperative indicators showed that the improved measures 
did not increase the surgical time and that the total intraoperative blood loss 
and the total drainage volume on postoperative day 3 were similar between the 
two groups, with no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Using suture ligatures as a replacement for staplers and minimizing 
thermal injury to the hilar structures based on standardized perioperative 
management may positively impact postoperative clinical outcomes, particularly 
the severity and duration of postoperative cough, leading to a significant 
improvement in patients' quality of life.

OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study is to investigate the relationship 
between the expression of the homologous recombination protein RAD51 and the 
CA125 elimination rate constant K (KELIM) score in the context of sensitivity to 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in patients with advanced high-grade serous 
ovarian cancer. Additionally, we explore the potential of RAD51 expression and 
the KELIM score as biomarkers of chemotherapy sensitivity.
METHODS: We selected a cohort of 43 patients with advanced high-grade ovarian 
carcinoma who underwent intermediate tumor cytoreductive surgery (IDS) following 
NACT between January 2017 and December 2019. Pathological tissue samples were 
collected from pre-chemotherapy and post-IDS ovarian cancer tissues, as well as 
from normal ovarian tissues of 12 control subjects. Immunohistochemistry was 
used to evaluate RAD51 protein expression. Concurrently, the KELIM score was 
calculated for NACT patients. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS) were monitored, and the correlation between RAD51 expression, 
chemotherapy sensitivity, and survival outcomes was assessed. Furthermore, we 
analyzed the combined prognostic value of RAD51 expression and the KELIM score 
in predicting NACT sensitivity and prognosis in advanced high-grade serous 
ovarian cancer.
RESULTS: The expression rate of RAD51 protein in ovarian cancer tissues was 
significantly higher compared to normal ovarian tissues (95.3%VS 16.7%, P < 
0.05). High RAD51 expression was significantly negatively correlated with the 
KELIM score and NACT sensitivity. Both RAD51 expression and the KELIM score were 
associated with the recurrence of platinum resistance after surgery. Patients 
with high RAD51 expression exhibited a higher recurrence rate of platinum 
resistance compared to those with low RAD51 expression. Similarly, patients with 
a KELIM score < 1 had a statistically significantly higher recurrence rate of 
platinum resistance than those with a KELIM score ≥ 1 (P < 0.001). There was no 
significant statistical difference between the AUC of RAD51 expression for 
predicting platinum-resistant recurrence and that of the KELIM score (P> 0.05). 
The AUC of the combination of RAD51 expression and the KELIM score showed an 
increasing trend compared with the KELIM score and RAD51 expression 
respectively, yet there was no statistical difference among the three. High 
RAD51 expression was associated with lower PFS and OS, indicating a poorer 
survival prognosis.
CONCLUSION: RAD51 protein expression is closely related to the sensitivity of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer. RAD51 
protein expression offers a valuable tool for predicting chemotherapy 
sensitivity, platinum resistance recurrence, and survival outcomes in patients 
with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer (LOCC), as a common type of malignant 
cancer, has become an important public health issue. This study aims to analyze 
and predict the trend of the LOCC burden, providing guidance for reducing the 
burden of LOCC.
METHODS: This study was based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database 
2021. We assessed the differences in LOCC among different regions and sexes from 
1990 to 2021 using Age-Standardized Rates (ASR) and Estimated Annual Percentage 
Change (EAPC). Additionally, Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort (BAPC) model was 
employed to predict the Incidence, Prevalence, Death, Disability-Adjusted Life 
Years (DALYs), Years of Life Lost due to disease (YLLs), and Years Lived with 
Disability (YLDs) of LOCC globally from 2022 to 2030.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2021, the global ASR of Incidence (ASIR), ASR of 
Prevalence (ASPR), and ASR of YLDs for LOCC had significantly increased, while 
the ASR of Death (ASDR), DALYs, and YLLs had decreased. The BAPC model predicted 
that by 2030, the ASIR and ASPR for males would decrease, while for females, an 
upward trend would be observed. The middle-aged and elderly population (>50 
years) would still be the main patient group (accounting for over 60%).
CONCLUSION: The disease burden of LOCC remains severe at present, but it is 
expected to show a downward trend by 2030. Therefore, it is still necessary to 
intensify efforts in the prevention and control of LOCC to achieve the 
expectation. This study provides theoretical guidance for reducing the burden of 
LOCC.

OBJECTIVE: Radiation dermatitis (RD), a common adverse event among breast cancer 
patients undergoing post-surgical radiotherapy, may be mitigated through the 
application of plant-derived substances possessing radioprotective effects. 
However, comprehensive evaluations comparing the efficacy of different 
plant-derived compounds are not yet available. The objective of this study is to 
perform a network meta-analysis (NMA) to evaluate the efficacy of diverse 
plant-derived substances in preventing RD in patients with breast cancer.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to identify randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) published up to April 2025 that investigated the use of 
plant-derived substances for the prevention of RD in patients with breast 
cancer. Two authors individually screened the articles, gathered pertinent 
information, and conducted quality assessments of the studies that were 
included.Data were synthesized and analyzed using Stata version 15.1.
RESULTS: In our NMA, we included 18 RCTs involving 2177 patients and 18 
different treatment arms. Regarding the primary and secondary outcomes, 
Sylimarin derived from Silybum marianum L.(Milk thistle) (SUCRA = 0.934) and 
Cichorium intybus L.(Chicory) root extract (SUCRA = 0.72) demonstrated the 
greatest efficacy in mitigating the occurrence of grade ≥2 and grade ≥3 RD. 
Furthermore, Silymarin (RR = 0.05, 95% CI [0.00, 0.87]) exhibits greater 
efficacy compared with the standard of care (SOC) in preventing grade ≥2 RD. 
However, no intervention demonstrated superiority over SOC in preventing grade 
≥3 RD.
CONCLUSION: Silymarin has shown promise as treatment for the prevention of grade 
≥2 RD in patients undergoing radiotherapy. Future studies with larger sample 
sizes are needed to substantiate the efficacy of various plant-derived 
substances.

INTRODUCTION: Sarcoma is a rare and highly heterogeneous family of mesenchymal 
tumors. The experience and interdisciplinary approach of specialized high-volume 
sarcoma centers has a significant impact on disease treatment and outcome for 
patients. The aim of this retrospective, real-world, multicenter study was to 
evaluate geographic distribution of sarcoma cases in Southwest Germany and 
visually depict possible underrepresented areas of sarcoma primary diagnoses. 
Such descriptive information may indirectly guide future referral patterns and 
outreach activities of specialized sarcoma centers.
METHODS: The absolute number and incidence of sarcoma patients obtained from the 
Baden-Württemberg Cancer Registry were compared with the data from five 
individual, high-volume, specialized sarcoma centers. Furthermore, we used a 
""White-Spot Analysis"" as a novel cost-effective approach in epidemiological and 
public health research for analyzing health care coverage in sarcoma care.
RESULTS: A total of 4,087 sarcoma patients living in the German Federal State of 
Baden-Württemberg between 2019 and 2022 were included in this study. Of these, 
1,650 patients (40%) were treated primarily in specialized sarcoma centers 
whilst 2,437 patients (60%) received treatment for sarcoma outside of the five 
main high-volume centers, in underrepresented areas identified through 
White-Spot Analysis. The sarcoma incidence in Baden-Württemberg was calculated 
with our data to be 9.18/100,000 inhabitants per year.
DISCUSSION: In future, the access to high-volume centers needs to be facilitated 
in order to minimize the observed discrepancies between treatment in specialized 
sarcoma centers and low-volume centers in Southwest Germany. Our analysis 
highlights such discrepancies and may support future efforts to improve outcomes 
for sarcoma patients.

BACKGROUND: The BRAF gene plays an essential role in papillary thyroid carcinoma 
(PTC).
PURPOSE: To investigate the potential of CT-based texture analysis in predicting 
BRAFV600E mutation in calcified PTC.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 475 cases of calcified PTC from two centers, who underwent 
CT scans, surgery, and BRAFV600E mutation testing, were included. Data from the 
first center were randomly divided into training and testing sets, whereas data 
from the second center constituted an external validation set. Using MaZda 
software, 256 texture features were extracted from both the parenchymal and 
calcified areas. The top ten texture feature parameters were selected by Fisher, 
minimization of both classification error probability and average correlation 
coefficients (POE+ACC), and mutual information measure (MI) feature selection 
algorithms. Data analysis and classification were performed using principal 
component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and nonlinear 
discriminant analysis (NDA). Receiver operating characteristic curves were used 
to evaluate the diagnostic performance.
RESULTS: The NDA method demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance compared 
to the LDA and PCA methods, with error rates of less than 10%, less than 25%, 
and greater than 30%, respectively in the training and validation sets. For 
parenchymal and calcified areas of PTC, the POE+ACC+NDA and MI+NDA methods 
exhibited the lowest error rates, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.969 in 
the training set and 0.964 in the internal validation set. Conversely, the 
Fisher+PCA and MI+PCA methods had the highest error rates, with AUC values of 
0.413 and 0.525 in the training set, and 0.433 and 0.560 in the internal 
validation set, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The POE+ACC+NDA or MI+NDA method provided high diagnostic 
performance for predicting BRAFV600E mutation in PTC. Texture analysis of tumor 
calcified area can also be used to predict BRAFV600E mutation.

BACKGROUND: Nemtabrutinib is a reversible inhibitor of both wild-type and 
acquired resistance-related mutant BTK. Since nemtabrutinib biochemically 
inhibits various kinases, new drug response biomarkers, cross-reactivities and 
differentiators may be identified.
METHODS: Nemtabrutinib was profiled in a large panel of cancer cell line 
viability assays. The sensitivity profile of nemtabrutinib was compared with the 
profiles of 135 kinase inhibitors across the same cell lines. Additionally, cell 
line sensitivity was related to gene mutation status, gene and protein 
expression levels, and gene dependency scores. Potential targets were explored 
using biochemical assays.
RESULTS: Sensitivity to nemtabrutinib is on average three times higher in 
BRAF-mutant versus wild-type cell lines. Consistently, the sensitivity profile 
of nemtabrutinib is similar to that of MEK, ERK and pan-RAF inhibitors. 
Furthermore, sensitivity to nemtabrutinib is correlated with high FGFR3 gene 
expression levels, high levels of phosphorylated MEK1 and genetic dependency on 
several mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). Biochemical profiling confirms 
that nemtabrutinib inhibits several growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and 
downregulates MAPK signaling via MEK. Molecular docking studies suggest that 
nemtabrutinib preferentially binds in the ATP-binding pocket of MEK1.
CONCLUSION: Combined cancer cell panel and biochemical profiling reveals 
previously underappreciated cross-reactivities of nemtabrutinib indicating a 
potential application in MAPK-driven cancers.

Radiology, Nanchong, China.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictive value of dual-energy CT assessment of 
extracellular volume fraction (ECV) on the efficacy of immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with liver cancer.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 179 liver cancer patients who 
received ICIs in our hospital between November 2023 and February 2025. Patients 
were divided into a group with excellent treatment efficacy (n=103) and a group 
with poor treatment efficacy (n=76). Univariate and binary Logistics regression 
analyses were performed to identify factors influencing treatment efficacy. The 
predictive value of ECV for the efficacy of ICIs in liver cancer patients was 
evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences in ECV, CRP, IL-6, 
NEU, and the status of other anti-tumor treatments between the two groups 
(P < 0.05). Binary Logistics regression analysis indicated that ECV, CRP, IL-6, 
and NEU were factors influencing the efficacy of ICIs in liver cancer patients 
(P < 0.05). ROC analysis showed that ECV had the highest area under the curve 
(AUC) of 0.839, with a standard error of 0.029 (95% CI: 0.781-0.896), a Youden 
index of 0.54, sensitivity of 56.58%, specificity of 97.09%, and an optimal 
cutoff value of 0.45. Patients were grouped based on the optimal critical value 
of ECV, with the survival probability of patients with ECV ≤ 0.45 being higher 
than that of patients with ECV > 0.45, showing statistically significant 
differences (P < 0.05). Patients with ECV ≤ 0.45 also exhibited higher 
post-treatment immune function indicators compared to those with ECV > 0.45, 
with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Dual-energy CT assessment of ECV demonstrates good predictive value 
in the efficacy of ICIs in liver cancer patients, assisting clinical judgment of 
treatment efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Up to 3.0% of women are diagnosed with endometrial cancer after 
hysterectomy for apparently benign conditions. There is controversy about the 
benefit of complementary lymphadenectomy in incidental endometrial cancer after 
hysterectomy.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role complementary lymphadenectomy during a second 
surgery in the prognosis of patients with endometrial carcinoma.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who were 
diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma from 2005 to 2019. Two groups were 
evaluated: patients who underwent a second surgery involving pelvic and/or 
para-aortic lymphadenectomy and patients who did not undergo surgical lymph node 
evaluation. Logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with 
whether or not a complementary lymphadenectomy was performed. The Kaplan-Meier 
method was used to generate survival curves, and the log-rank test was used for 
comparisons. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with the Cox 
test.
RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty patients were included. Among them, 120 (46.15%) 
underwent complementary lymphadenectomy, and 140 (53.83%) did not. The factors 
associated with performing complementary lymphadenectomy in a second surgical 
procedure were higher grade, nonendometrioid histology and deep myometrial 
involvement. The factors associated with adjuvant treatment were high-grade 
histology, deep myometrial involvement, cervical involvement and extensive 
lymphovascular permeation. Complementary lymphadenectomy was not associated with 
adjuvant treatment (OR 0.85 95% CI 0.35-2.02), overall survival (Hazard Ratio 
(HR) 0.40 95% CI 1.16-1.00) or disease-free survival (HR 0.77 95% CI 0.38-1.59).
CONCLUSIONS: No clear therapeutic or prognostic role was identified for 
complementary lymphadenectomy during a second surgery in patients with 
endometrial cancer. Although adjuvant therapy was more common in patients who 
underwent complementary lymphadenectomy, it was not independently associated 
with receiving adjuvant therapy. Individualizing treatment decisions remains 
important when considering a second surgical procedure.

BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), has demonstrated substantial 
clinical activity in metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. Although durable 
responses are increasingly reported, the potential for long-lasting remission 
after treatment discontinuation remains poorly documented.
CASES: We report two patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who 
experienced exceptional and sustained clinical benefit with T-DXd. The first 
patient achieved a deep response lasting over 50 months, including 36 months of 
complete remission after treatment discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia. The 
second patient has maintained disease control for over 39 months, with a 
prolonged treatment pause. Both cases highlight remarkable disease stability 
beyond conventional expectations.
CONCLUSION: These case reports highlight the potential of T-DXd not only to 
induce deep and durable responses but also to maintain disease remission beyond 
drug exposure in selected patients. Such observations challenge the paradigm of 
incurability in metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer and warrant further 
investigation into the mechanisms and predictors of long-lasting responses.

BACKGROUND: In locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC), 
durvalumab as consolidation therapy following definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) 
was established as the standard of care. Given the heterogeneity of patients 
with LA-NSCLC, the present study evaluated the efficacy and safety of durvalumab 
in a real-world, multicenter observational study.
METHODS: Patients with LA-NSCLC, whose disease had not progressed following CRT 
and receiving ≥1 dose of durvalumab as part of the expanded access program (EAP) 
in Thailand and outside EAP, were included. In addition to descriptive 
statistics, survival probability was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: A total of 82 patients from 12 centers in Thailand were enrolled. The 
median age was 63 years, 74% were men, 72% had non-squamous NSCLC, and 20% of 
patients had an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. Only 13.4% of 
patients were tested for programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and 54.5% had PD-L1 
expression. Most patients (84%) received concurrent CRT, and 
carboplatin/paclitaxel was the most commonly used. Of the patients, 89% received 
radiotherapy (RT) dose ≥60 Gy with a median time of durvalumab initiation from 
the end of RT being 42 days. Overall, 57% of patients completed the 12-month 
treatment with a median of 24 cycles. Objective response rate (ORR) and disease 
control rate (DCR) were 41.3% and 86.7%, respectively. With a median follow-up 
time of 43.3 months, 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and 2-year time to 
second objective disease progression (PFS2) were 63.1% and 81.6%, respectively. 
Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) of any grade and grade ≥ 3 were 25.6% and 
9.8%, respectively. Pneumonitis was the most frequent irAE (17%), and 6% were 
grade ≥ 3, leading to discontinuation in six patients (7.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: Durvalumab following definitive CRT demonstrated promising outcomes 
and was well-tolerated in this real-world study. These findings support the 
utilization of durvalumab for enhancing outcomes in patients with unresectable 
LA-NSCLC within Asian populations.

INTRODUCTION: To analyze the clinicopathological features, diagnosis, and 
treatment strategies for metastatic breast carcinoma to the thyroid (MBCT) to 
enhance clinical awareness of this rare condition.
METHODS: Analysis of clinical data from one MBCT patient and literature review.
RESULTS: A 41-year-old female with left breast invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) 
received neoadjuvant AC-T chemotherapy, breast-conserving surgery, radiotherapy, 
and endocrine therapy. At eight years post-diagnosis, thyroid lesions were 
detected. Total thyroidectomy with lymph node dissection confirmed MBCT 
pathologically. No progression was observed at 16 months post-thyroidectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: MBCT is a rare clinical entity characterized by nonspecific 
clinical and radiological findings. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis is 
essential for a definitive diagnosis. In patients with a breast cancer history, 
MBCT should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of thyroid 
abnormalities.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative radiotherapy is standard for high-risk cervical 
cancer, but acute toxicities-particularly gastrointestinal and 
hematologic-remain clinically relevant. Patient positioning may influence organ 
dose exposure and setup accuracy, yet its multidimensional clinical impact is 
poorly characterized.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated patients with cervical cancer 
treated with postoperative volumetric modulated arc therapy between 2019 and 
2022. Propensity score matching (2:1) produced a balanced matched cohort of 
prone and supine treatments for comparative analyses. Primary endpoints included 
pelvic organ dose-volume parameters, interfractional setup error, and grade ≥2 
hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities, evaluated using multivariable 
logistic regression and linear mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: In this single-center retrospective cohort (n = 168), propensity score 
matching (2:1) yielded 112 balanced patients (prone n = 70; supine n = 42). 
After matching, target coverage was comparable between positions (PTV_D95: 45.52 
Gy vs 45.54 Gy, p = 0.24). The prone group showed higher low-dose exposure in 
bowel bag and rectum at V5-V15 (e.g., V10 difference -9.84%, 95% CI -17.07 to 
1.08; adjusted p = 0.040). Setup error was similar across all axes (p > 0.05). 
The supine group had significantly higher incidence of leukopenia (92.9% vs 
71.4%; p = 0.0073), with prone positioning associated with reduced hematologic 
toxicity (OR = 14.40, 95% CI 1.60-129.74; p = 0.017). Conversely, diarrhea 
occurred more often in the prone group (44.3% vs 26.2%, p = 0.070), and supine 
positioning was protective in multivariable analysis (OR = 0.42, 95% CI 
0.17-0.97; p = 0.047).
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest prone positioning may be preferable for 
patients with limited hematopoietic reserve, while supine positioning may 
benefit those with gastrointestinal vulnerability. Positioning choice should be 
individualized based on toxicity risk and functional anatomy to optimize safety 
in postoperative cervical cancer radiotherapy.

University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.

INTRODUCTION: Two trastuzumab biosimilars have been introduced into the local 
public healthcare system since April 2021 as alternatives for treatment of human 
epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) positive breast cancer. While their 
oncological efficacy compared to reference trastuzumab (Herceptin®) is well 
established, local comparative data on cardiotoxicity among the three 
formulations remain limited. This study evaluates the cardiac safety of Herzuma® 
and Kanjinti® compared with Herceptin® in a single-center cohort.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 90 patients with HER2-positive 
early-stage breast cancer treated with adjuvant trastuzumab (Herceptin®, 
Herzuma®, or Kanjinti®) between January 2020 and January 2025 at Queen Mary 
Hospital, Hong Kong. Cardiac monitoring was performed via multi-gated 
acquisition (MUGA) scans every three months. Cardiotoxicity was defined as a 
≥10% absolute decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), LVEF <50%, 
or symptomatic heart failure. The primary study endpoint was time to cardiac 
event.
RESULTS: Cardiac events occurred in 19 patients (Herceptin®:18.6%, Herzuma®: 
19.4%, Kanjinti®: 36.4%). No statistically significant differences in time to 
cardiac event were observed (log-rank p > 0.20). The odds ratio for events was 
highest in the Kanjinti® group (vs. Herceptin®, OR = 2.50, p = 0.24). Median 
time to event was shortest in the Kanjinti® group. No significant associations 
between cardiac events and cardiovascular risk factors identified.
CONCLUSION: Trastuzumab biosimilars demonstrated comparable short-term cardiac 
safety to reference trastuzumab. While a higher event rate was observed in the 
Kanjinti® group, the small sample size limits interpretation. Prospective 
studies with longer follow-up and larger patient number are warranted to better 
characterize long-term cardiac outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC), a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 
is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the colon. Chronic intestinal inflammation 
plays a critical role in the increased risk of developing colitis-associated 
cancer (CAC). CU06-1004, an endothelial dysfunction blocker, can alleviate acute 
colitis by suppressing inflammation and regulating colonic vascular dysfunction. 
However, whether CU06-1004 suppresses chronic intestinal inflammation and 
prevents the development of CAC remains unclear.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the protective effects of CU06-1004 by 
suppressing inflammation in both the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced 
chronic colitis model and the azoxymethane (AOM)/DSS-induced colorectal cancer 
mouse models. We evaluated the expression of key pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
assessed histological characteristics in the animals, and examined the 
expression of key genes associated with inflammation.
RESULTS: In the DSS-induced chronic colitis model, our results showed that 
CU06-1004 treatment suppressed inflammation, as evidenced by disease activity 
index scores, colon length, colon damage, and histological analysis. 
Furthermore, CU06-1004 administration reduced the levels of various inflammatory 
cytokines and factors (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, 
cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase), decreased immune cell 
infiltration (F4/80+ macrophages and CD177+ neutrophils), and alleviated 
inflammation by inhibiting vascular adhesion molecules. Moreover, in the 
AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer model as well, CU06-1004 significantly reduced 
the severity of colitis. CU06-1004 treatment also significantly reduced both the 
number and size of AOM/DSS-induced colorectal tumors, suppressed inflammation, 
and inhibited the malignant proliferation of epithelial cells. Additionally, 
CU06-1004 treatment downregulated the expression of the key colorectal cancer 
marker β-catenin and its target gene c-Myc in AOM/DSS-induced mice, thereby 
inhibiting tumor growth.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that CU06-1004 inhibits inflammation-induced 
tumorigenesis by modulating the inflammatory response in the colon. 
Consequently, CU06-1004 could represent a promising therapeutic candidate for 
the prevention of colorectal cancer through modulation of inflammation.

Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) is among the most severe complications in lung 
cancer patients, particularly for those without targetable gene mutations, who 
typically survive just 1-4 months. We present the case of a 68-year-old man with 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and LM (pT1cN0M1b, stage IVB) whose primary 
lesion was early-stage with no other distant metastases. Genetic testing 
identified only a KRAS-G12V mutation. After neurological symptoms progressed 
following one cycle of pemetrexed, bevacizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy, 
the patient underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement and Ommaya reservoir 
implantation. Treatment with intrathecal pemetrexed via the Ommaya reservoir, 
combined with intravenous tislelizumab and carboplatin, resulted in 12 months of 
progression-free survival. For subsequent central nervous system progression 
involving both brain parenchymal metastasis and LM, we administered whole brain 
radiotherapy followed by second-line intrathecal thiotepa via Ommaya reservoir 
alongside tislelizumab and bevacizumab. This achieved continued shrinkage of 
brain lesions and neurological improvement. After ten cycles, thrombocytopenia 
necessitated switching to intrathecal methotrexate. Remarkably, the patient has 
survived nearly 29 months while maintaining good performance status and quality 
of life - to our knowledge, one of the longest reported survival for an NSCLC 
patient with LM harboring KRAS-G12V or other non-targetable mutations. This case 
suggests that combining ventriculoperitoneal shunt with Ommaya 
reservoir-delivered intrathecal chemotherapy may represent an effective 
therapeutic approach for LM patients.

Histone lactylation modification and RNA m6A modification play important roles 
in cisplatin resistance of bladder cancer (BCa). Hypoxia drives cisplatin 
resistance in BCa by analyzing the TCGA-BLCA cohort, where hypoxia signatures 
predicted poor overall survival. In vitro, hypoxia elevated lactate production 
via LDHA, inducing H3K18la catalyzed by KAT2B, which activated RBM15 
transcription. RBM15 stabilized IGFBP3 mRNA via m6A modification depending on 
its SPOC domain, increasing IGFBP3 protein. Nuclear translocation of IGFBP3 
complexed with p-EGFR/p-DNA-PKcs, enhancing DNA repair and reducing 
cisplatin-induced damage. Clinically, BCa tissues exhibited elevated 
LDHA/H3K18la/RBM15/IGFBP3, further amplifying post-cisplatin chemotherapy. 
Targeting this axis with LDHA inhibitor (stiripentol) and EGFR inhibitor 
(gefitinib) synergistically reversed cisplatin resistance in vitro and in vivo. 
This study unveils the ""hypoxia-H3K18la-RBM15-IGFBP3"" axis as a central driver 
of cisplatin resistance and proposes dual metabolic-epigenetic inhibition as a 
therapeutic strategy for refractory BCa.

Complex S10+S7b Segmentectomy by Pulmonary Ligament Approach Based on B7 
Branching Pattern.

INTRODUCTION: Based on the results of the JCOG0802 study, segmentectomy is now 
considered the standard treatment for early-stage lung cancer. However, 
segmentectomy for right basal segment lesions remains technically challenging 
because of the complexity of B7 branching. B7 demonstrates 3 distinct branching 
patterns based on its anatomical relationship with the basal vein (BV): ventral, 
bilateral, and dorsal. Herein, we report a successful S10+S7b complex 
segmentectomy for S10 lung cancer with a bilateral B7 branching pattern using a 
pulmonary ligament (PL) approach.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old woman presented with a 15-mm partially solid 
nodule in the right S10 segment (cT1miN0M0, cStage IA1). 3D-CT revealed 
bilateral B7 branches crossing the BV. A preoperative bronchoscopic marking with 
indigo carmine was conducted to guide the intersegmental plane. Three-port 
video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed via the PL approach. Following V7b 
dissection, the crossing of B7a and B7b over the BV was clearly identified. The 
dorsal branch of the B7 (B7b), located ipsilateral and central to the B10, was 
first divided. Sequential dissections of the veins, bronchi, and arteries at S10 
and S7b were then performed. The intersegmental plane was stapled according to 
the preoperative bronchoscopic markings to ensure adequate margins. The 
postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on POD 6. 
The pathological examination revealed adenocarcinoma (pT1miN0M0, pStage IA1) 
with negative margins (20 mm).
CONCLUSIONS: This case may serve as a reference for surgical planning in 
segmentectomy for right basal lesions according to B7 branching patterns. Even 
in complex cases with bilateral B7 branching patterns, initial B7b dissection 
facilitates access to the B10. The PL approach provides not only direct access 
to the basal segment vasculature and bronchi but also superior visualization of 
the anatomy of B7 branching.

Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains the primary cause of mortality in breast 
cancer patients, driven by tumor heterogeneity, cellular evolution, and 
therapy-resistant clones. Traditional bulk transcriptomics, although 
informative, fail to capture rare subpopulations and context-specific gene 
expression, which are crucial for understanding disease progression. Single-cell 
transcriptomics (SCT) has emerged as a transformative approach, enabling 
high-resolution analysis of individual cells to reveal tumor composition, 
lineage dynamics, and transcriptional plasticity. This review highlights how SCT 
reshapes our understanding of MBC by mapping tumor evolution, identifying cancer 
stem-like cells, and characterizing states of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. 
We explore how SCT reveals clonal and spatial heterogeneity, and how tumor 
microenvironment components, including immune, stromal, and endothelial cells, 
interact with cancer cells to support immune evasion and the formation of a 
metastatic niche. SCT also uncovers mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, 
including transcriptional reprogramming and the survival of drug-tolerant 
subpopulations. Integrating SCT with spatial transcriptomics and multi-omics 
platforms offers a comprehensive view of the MBC ecosystem and may uncover novel 
therapeutic targets. We further discuss the translational potential of SCT for 
biomarker discovery, liquid biopsy development, and precision oncology. We 
address current technical challenges and future directions for clinical 
application. SCT is poised to transform MBC research and guide next-generation 
therapeutic strategies.

The global burden of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) has been on the rise, making it 
among the leading contributor to cancer-related deaths. Long non-coding RNA 
(lncRNA) are implicated in the initiation and progression of LUAD. To date, the 
mechanism by which lncRNA participate in LUAD are not clearly characterized. 
Here, we investigated the role of the newly-discovered Lnc-PDZD7-3 in the 
development of LUAD. Results revealed downregulation of Lnc-PDZD7-3 in human 
normal lung tissues and upregulation in LUAD tissues from the TCGA (The Cancer 
Genome Atlas) databases. Excessive expression of Lnc-PDZD7-3 promotes occurrence 
of distant metastasis. Lnc-PDZD7-3 knockdown suppressed the proliferative and 
viability potential of cells, as well enhanced apoptosis and inhibited the 
migratory activity of LUAD cells. Notably, expression levels of MMP9, Vimentin, 
Twist, Fibronectin, and MMP2 in LUAD cells were downregulated markedly except 
for snail following Lnc-PDZD7-3 knockdown. Through rescue experiments, we 
confirmed that Lnc-PDZD7-3 enhanced LUAD development by activating 
FN1/fibronectin signaling. Meanwhile, we also identified that Lnc-PDZD7-3 was 
localized in cytoplasm and nucleus segments of LUAD cells by FISH technology. In 
summary, this study implicates Lnc-PDZD7-3 in the pathomechanisms of LUAD via 
the FN1/fibronectin signaling, suggesting it may be diagnostic biomarker and 
therapeutic targets of LUAD.

BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (allo-HCT) often face complex and evolving needs throughout 
recovery. Person-centred nursing (PCN) is essential in this context yet remains 
underexplored in specialised care settings. In Sweden, the Assessment of 
Rehabilitation Needs Checklist (ARNC) is commonly used in cancer care, but its 
role in supporting person-centred conversations has not been investigated.
AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate how the use of the ARNC as a 
conversation tool promotes PCN within the allo-HCT context.
METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted at two major allo-HCT centers in 
Sweden. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with patients 
(n = 16), focus group discussions with registered nurses (RNs, n = 16), and from 
30 memos written by RNs. Reflexive thematic analysis was used.
RESULTS: Three overarching themes were developed: (1) Letting the Story Emerge, 
(2) Unmet Needs and (3) Structural Gaps in Practice. The ARNC facilitated 
individualised conversations and helped identify unmet needs, including 
sensitive or previously unvoiced concerns. However, the lack of follow-up and 
organisational constraints, such as time pressure and fragmented care settings, 
limited its capacity to support shared care planning and sustained engagement.
CONCLUSION: When used in dialogue, the ARNC has the potential to support 
person-centred nursing in allo-HCT by enabling narrative-based, needs-driven 
conversations. However, its effectiveness depends on structured follow-up and 
organisational conditions that promote relational care.

The excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) disrupts redox 
homeostasis, contributing to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Among 
ROS, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) serves as a key mediator of oxidative signaling 
and a critical biomarker of cellular oxidative damage due to its relative 
stability and signaling relevance. However, current detection strategies for ROS 
and H2O2 often lack the necessary sensitivity, selectivity, and real-time 
responsiveness, underscoring the urgent need for advanced sensing platforms to 
support precision cardiovascular medicine. The research introduces a ROS 
detection based on reduced graphene oxide-cobalt oxide-platinum (rGO-Co3O4-Pt) 
nanocomposites for biological sample analysis. The nanocomposite platform 
enables H2O2 detection down to 160 nM, with linearity up to 2.50 μM. The 
platform showed acceptable analytical performance in terms of sensitivity, 
repeatability, and selectivity, which enabled both ex vivo and in vivo H2O2 
monitoring. The method was validated in doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity 
models using HL-1 cells and C57BL/6J mice, showing strong correlation with 
MTT-based ROS assays. The rGO-Co3O4-Pt nanocomposite improves portable 
analytical devices for real-world pharmacological applications. The technology 
enables real-time therapeutic monitoring while optimizing individualized dosing 
and expanding its applications to cancer treatment and diabetes management and 
neurological disorders.

University School of Medicine, Jinhua, China.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is characterized by high recurrence and metastasis, 
resulting in low patient survival. Dysbiosis of intestinal flora increases CRC 
metastasis risk. Mesalazine, an anti-inflammatory drug with proven antitumor 
activity, is commonly used to treat CRC in patients with inflammatory bowel 
disease, but whether it mediates CRC hepatic metastasis by affecting key flora 
is unknown. An animal model of CRC liver metastasis was established by injecting 
HCT116 cells into the spleens of mice and treated with mesalazine. Mouse feces 
were collected for 16S rRNA sequencing to analyze the abundance of intestinal 
flora. In vitro experiments demonstrated that mesalazine inhibited 
proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC by modulating Bacteroides 
fragilis. Rescue experiments validated molecular mechanisms. Mesalazine 
inhibited CRC hepatic metastasis and reduced the abundance of Bacteroides 
fragilis in the feces of CRC hepatic metastatic mice by 16S rRNA sequencing 
analysis. In vitro experiments showed that mesalazine inhibited proliferation, 
migration, and invasion of CRC by affecting Bacteroides fragilis, mainly through 
the histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)/Wingless/Int/Beta-catenin (Wnt/β-catenin) 
axis. The study elucidated the mechanism by which mesalazine inhibited CRC liver 
metastasis through the HDAC3/Wnt/β-catenin axis by affecting the abundance of 
Bacteroides fragilis, which provided a new idea for CRC treatment.

Carbon monoxide (CO) has shown therapeutic potential across various diseases, 
including cancer. To enable controlled delivery, many CO-releasing molecules 
(CORMs) have been developed. However, their clinical translation has been 
limited due to concerns about stability, potential toxicity, and insufficient 
targeting ability. In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization 
of an enzyme-triggered CO-releasing molecule (ET-CORM) that can be 
site-specifically conjugated to antibodies. This novel ET-CORM is built on a 
biocompatible iron core, and releases CO upon cleavage by the cancer-associated 
protease cathepsin B (CatB). The incorporation of a bioorthogonal handle into 
ET-CORM enabled its efficient and site-specific conjugation to the clinically 
used antibody trastuzumab us of the interchain disulfide bonds. The resulting 
ET-CORM-antibody conjugate (ET-CORM-Ab) exhibited an average drug-to-antibody 
ratio (DAR) of 6.8, corresponding to approximately 20 CO molecules per 
conjugate. This construct allowed for selective intracellular CO delivery to 
HER2-overexpressing and CatB-expressing cells in vitro. This study represents a 
metal-based CORM-antibody conjugate activated by a tumor-associated enzymatic 
trigger, opening new avenues for investigating CO-mediated effects and advancing 
CO-based cancer therapies to the clinics.

Peptide-based cancer vaccines offer favorable safety and stability profiles but 
are limited by rapid clearance and poor immunogenicity. Here, a ≈20 nm solid 
self-emulsifying (SSE) nanovaccine platform that co-delivers peptide antigens 
and an oligonucleotide adjuvant containing the 5'-C-phosphate-G-3' (CpG) motif 
is reported. This formulation elicits T-cell responses 40 fold higher than those 
of conventional emulsified vaccines and even achieves complete tumor regression 
at low doses. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) adsorbed on SSE vaccines enhances lymph 
node targeting and dendritic cell internalization. Furthermore, SSE is 
internalized by T cells and promotes lipid raft formation, thereby further 
sensitizing T cells to activation. These findings reveal a dual mechanism of 
immune regulation through the simultaneous engagement of dendritic cells and T 
cells. The SSE platform offers a clinically translatable strategy for potent 
cancer immunotherapy and provides mechanistic insights into nanoparticle-immune 
cell interactions that may guide the design of next-generation nanovaccines.

The presence of microplastics in the human body has been widely confirmed. This 
study aimed to characterize the presence of microplastics in human gastric 
tissue and explore the relationship between microplastic exposure and gastric 
cancer risk, as well as the potential underlying molecular mechanisms. 
Microplastics present in human gastric tissues are characterized using three 
methods. Following this, the relationship between microplastic exposure and the 
development of gastric cancer, as well as the potential underlying molecular 
mechanisms, is explored using clinical case data and transcriptome sequencing. 
Microplastics are widely present in human gastric tissues, with a significantly 
higher microplastic load observed in gastric tumor tissues than para-tumor and 
normal gastric tissues. Furthermore, a high microplastic load is significantly 
associated with lymph node metastasis in patients with gastric cancer. A high 
microplastic load leads to significant enrichment of biological processes and 
signaling pathways, such as cytotoxicity and oxidative stress. Additionally, a 
high microplastic load is associated with significant upregulation of genes 
associated with malignant disease, which is significantly associated with poor 
prognosis in patients with gastric cancer. Microplastic exposure may be a 
potential risk factor for the onset of gastric cancer.

M2-type tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-dominated immunosuppressive tumor 
microenvironment (TME) often contributes to chemoresistance. For the first time, 
a glutathione (GSH)-responsive metal-organic framework (MOF) nanoinducer is 
engineered for co-delivering doxorubicin (DOX) and HIF-1α antisense 
oligonucleotide labeled with Ce6 photosensitizer. This new crystal structure 
exhibited robust stability in simulated physiological environments. Furthermore, 
multimodal synergistic effects are exhibited upon tumor cell internalization 
with the nanoinducer. GSH depletion synergizes with photodynamic therapy (PDT) 
generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce ferroptosis, which effectively 
drives phenotypic reprogramming of M2-TAMs toward M1 macrophages. HIF-1α 
antisense oligonucleotides downregulate HIF-1α expression as well as downstream 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated drug efflux, thereby significantly enhancing DOX 
accumulation in chemoresistant breast cancer cells. Consequently, the 
combination of DOX with ferroptosis-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) 
initiates antitumor immunity and activates cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This smart 
biomimetic nanoinducer demonstrates robust antitumor performance in both in 
vitro and in vivo models, effectively activating tumor-specific immune 
responses. A promising candidate nanodrug with a new crystal structure is 
presented for chemotherapy-immunotherapy combination therapy.

PURPOSE: Induction chemotherapy (ICT) followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy 
is a standard of care in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma 
(LA-NPC). However, there is a lack of consensus on appropriate radiotherapy (RT) 
target volumes and prescriptions after ICT. We systematically reviewed the 
literature to inform a planned international consensus guideline development.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A scoping review was done to define the areas of 
significant practice differences, followed by a systematic review. The reviews 
were conducted by a Steering Committee (SC) and an Evidence Review Committee 
(ERC) consisting of radiation oncologists with expertise in treating NPC.
RESULTS: The scoping review revealed significant practice differences on (1) 
optimal timing for post-ICT RT, (2) ideal imaging modalities for RT target 
delineation, (3) RT dose prescription and fractionation, and (4) RT target 
volume delineation. The systematic review found no specific recommendations on 
optimal timing for post-ICT RT and optimal imaging modalities. Regarding dose 
prescription, current guidelines advocate including two or three dose levels. 
Differences in post-induction target volume delineation were found. The data 
show that volume reduction may be possible without compromising oncologic 
outcomes and may improve quality of life.
CONCLUSION: There is a lack of evidence and guidelines on post-ICT RT timing and 
optimal imaging modalities. Guidelines on post-ICT target volumes and dose 
levels differ significantly; published evidence from clinical trials is limited. 
Considering this lack of consensus after ICT in LA-NPC, international consensus 
guidelines among experts from endemic regions are needed and may help harmonize 
practices.

Activation of cytosolic nucleic acid-sensing pathways represents a promising 
strategy to convert immunologically ""cold"" tumors into inflamed ones. 
Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) enzymes are critical regulators of innate immunity and 
nucleic acid sensing, yet their roles in cancer remain poorly defined. Here, 
ferredoxin-1 (FDX1), a mitochondrial Fe-S protein frequently downregulated in 
clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), is identified as a dual regulator of 
ferroptosis and antitumor immunity. FDX1 overexpression triggers mitochondrial 
permeability transition pore opening, leading to cytosolic release of 
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and double-stranded RNA (mt-dsRNA). This reveals an 
independent function of FDX1 as a tumor-intrinsic immunity activator linked to 
mitochondrial stress signaling. These damage-associated molecular patterns 
(DAMPs) engage cytosolic nucleic acid sensors-specifically cGAS and 
RIG-I/MDA5-triggering TBK1 phosphorylation and a robust type I interferon 
response that occurs prior to overt ferroptosis. This innate immune cascade 
reshapes the tumor microenvironment by enhancing MHC I/II antigen presentation, 
recruiting CD8+ T cells, and suppressing tumor growth and metastasis in 
orthotopic syngeneic models. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized 
antitumor axis through which FDX1 synergizes with mitochondrial nucleic acid 
release with ferroptosis to promote immunogenic inflammation and T cell 
infiltration in ccRCC, offering novel therapeutic opportunities targeting 
mitochondrial-immune crosstalk.

BACKGROUND: This study used the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 database to 
analyze and summarize the global disease burden and changing trends of liver 
cancer, which has strong public health reference value.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The data for this study is drawn from the GBD 2021 
study. In the analysis, we conducted a detailed stratification based on gender, 
20 age groups, 21 GBD regions, 204 countries and territories, and 5 SDI 
quintiles. This study aims to explore the liver cancer burden of 
age-standardized prevalence rates (ASPR), incidence rates, death rates (ASMR), 
and disability-adjusted life years (ASDR).
RESULTS: In 2021, liver cancer continued to impose a substantial global burden. 
Although the global burden of liver cancer is declining overall, there are 
marked regional differences in the scale of reduction. Incidence of liver cancer 
varies markedly across regions and sexes within each age group, with older 
people bearing a disproportionately high burden, especially among males in high 
SDI regions and low-middle SDI regions. The declining global incidence of liver 
cancer among both genders from 2022 to 2040.
CONCLUSIONS: These patterns highlighted the necessity for focused public health 
measures and management plans to tackle the inequalities in liver cancer.

Antibody-drug conjugates are proving to be highly effective in oncology, yet 
their real-world respiratory safety profile remains largely unknown. This study 
sought to characterize drug-linked respiratory disorders and identify safety 
signals. We performed a descriptive analysis with expert review of respiratory 
adverse drug reactions related to antibody-drug conjugates from the French 
pharmacovigilance database. We also conducted disproportionality analyses for 
interstitial lung disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and pleural disorder 
using VigiBase®. Among the 71 patients included in the descriptive study, 56 
(78.9%) were women, and the median age was 60 years. Most (71.8%) were treated 
for breast cancer. Fifty-nine patients (83.1%) developed antibody-drug 
conjugate-related interstitial lung disease, primarily after trastuzumab 
deruxtecan. Nine patients (12.7%) developed pulmonary arterial hypertension and 
three (4.2%) contracted pleural disorders, mainly after trastuzumab emtansine. 
The median time to onset varied by clinical feature, with 1 month for pleural 
disorder, 4 months for interstitial lung disease, and 45 months for pulmonary 
arterial hypertension. The disproportionality analysis showed a significant 
signal for interstitial lung disease with brentuximab vedotin, polatuzumab 
vedotin, trastuzumab emtansine, and trastuzumab deruxtecan. Only trastuzumab 
emtansine had a significant signal for pulmonary arterial hypertension. All 
antibody-drug conjugates, except belantamab mafodotin and enfortumab vedotin, 
were associated with a significant signal for pleural disorders. Our study 
highlights the risk of interstitial lung disease with these drugs in real-world 
settings and identified pulmonary arterial hypertension and pleural disorders as 
additional safety signals. Further research is needed to confirm these findings 
in population-based studies and to identify antibody-drug conjugates and 
patient-related risk factors.

Accurate identification of the interactions between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and 
antigenic epitopes presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules 
is fundamental to advancing cancer immunotherapy. Nevertheless, predictive 
modeling of TCR-epitope binding remains challenging, as existing models struggle 
to generalize to unseen epitopes while often overlooking key physicochemical 
properties governing immune recognition. Here, a biologically informed 
vision-guided deep learning framework (DAISY) is proposed for robust and 
interpretable TCR-epitope binding prediction. DAISY integrates hierarchical 
physicochemical features via a biologically inspired Condition-Adaptive Fusion 
module, jointly modeling residue-level spatial interactions and global 
biochemical context. DAISY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models 
across four generalization scenarios, notably improving ROC-AUC by 11% and 
PR-AUC by 16% over the strongest competitor in the most challenging Unseen-Pair 
setting. DAISY also offers intuitive interpretability by localizing 
interaction-relevant residues via Score-CAM visualizations. Furthermore, its 
computational predictions are bridged to key immunological and clinical 
outcomes, demonstrating utility in correlating with T-cell clonal expansion, 
identifying functional TCRs, and robustly forecasting patient survival. 
Together, DAISY can serve as a powerful tool for broad translational immunology 
and introduces a scalable modeling paradigm for next-generation immune modeling.

Vaccination has played a central role in the historical and modern fight against 
infectious diseases. This review explores the evolution of infectious disease 
perception from ancient humoral theories to the modern ""One Health"" framework, 
reflecting the integration of environmental, animal, and human health. Vaccines 
have not only reduced morbidity and mortality but have also provided profound 
economic and developmental benefits across societies. Climate change, 
antimicrobial resistance, and the rapid emergence of new infectious threats have 
prompted innovations in vaccine technologies, including messenger RNA, DNA, 
viral vector, and nanoparticle-based platforms. These advances support 
personalized vaccine strategies, such as vaccinomics, and extend their 
application to noncommunicable diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer disease. 
Despite their success, vaccines face challenges including global access 
disparities, waning immunity, pathogen evolution, and vaccine hesitancy. 
Nonetheless, vaccination remains a cornerstone of global health security, with 
strong returns on investment and crucial roles in socioeconomic stabilization 
during pandemics. Future vaccine strategies must integrate technological 
innovation with equitable access and public trust, for instance, through global 
initiatives like the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the 
World Health Organization COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access, and the establishment 
of regional manufacturing hubs to effectively respond to unpredictable threats 
like ""Disease X.""

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and predictive biomarker of a 
third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (3G-TKI; ponatinib or olverembatinib) 
combined with azacitidine in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in myeloid blast 
phase.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center, prospective study combining 3G-TKI with 
azacitidine in 28-day cycles. The primary end point was a major hematologic 
response (MaHR) by cycle 2. The trial is registered in Chinese Clinical Trial 
Registry (ChiCTR2200055887) RESULTS: In total, 37 patients were studied. The 
median follow-up was 30 months (interquartile range, 24-40 months). Twenty-five 
patients achieved a MaHR by cycle 2, 30 returned to chronic phase. Ten patients 
underwent transplantation. The patients who underwent transplantation had higher 
3-year probability of survival compared with nontransplanted patients (50%; [95% 
confidence interval (CI), 9%-37%] versus 18% [95% CI, 3%-33%]; p = .01). The 
regimen was well tolerated. In adjusted logistic/Cox regression analyses, KRAS 
mutation was significantly associated with a lower MaHR rate (odds ratio, 0.1; 
95% CI, 0-0.8; p = .03), worse progression-free survival (PFS; hazard ratio 
[HR], 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-8.6; p = .04), and worse survival (HR, 8.2; 95% CI, 
2.5-26.8; p < .001); PTPN11 mutation was associated with worse PFS (HR, 5.1; 95% 
CI, 1.2-22.2; p = 0.03) and worse survival (HR, 9.6; 95% CI, 2.2-41.5; 
p = .002); and increasing numbers of non-ABL1 mutations were associated with 
worse PFS (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.3; p = .04). Transcriptomic analysis revealed 
that patients who did not achieve a MaHR experienced activation of cancer-, 
metabolism-, oxidative phosphorylation-related pathways. The KRAS signaling 
pathway was significantly activated in patients who lost MaHR during treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: 3G-TKI with azacitidine is an effective and safe therapy providing 
more chance to receive a transplantation for CML in myeloid blast phase. 
Potential biomarkers associated with outcomes were identified.

INTRODUCTION: T regulatory cells (Tregs) are key modulators of the immune system 
with dual roles. While protective against autoimmunity, Tregs can exhibit 
immunosuppressive capabilities, allowing the tumor to evade immune recognition 
and destruction, and favoring tumor progression. Targeting Tregs to reduce their 
immunosuppressive ability offers a promising strategy to boost anti-tumor 
immunity and improve cancer treatment outcomes.
AREAS COVERED: This review explores the role of Tregs in the immune system, 
delves into their contribution to cancer and tumor progression, and highlights 
therapeutic strategies targeting Tregs, along with innovative delivery systems.
EXPERT OPINION: Targeting tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells (Tregs) 
represents a promising but complex approach in cancer immunotherapy. However, 
its success is limited by the risk of autoimmunity, inefficient intratumoral 
delivery, and patient immune heterogeneity. Precision strategies integrating 
biomarker-guided stratification, single-cell, and spatial profiling can improve 
selectivity and therapeutic outcomes. Identifying tumor-specific Treg markers 
and distinguishing stable, suppressive Tregs from more plastic or 'fragile' 
subsets are essential for advancing targeted immunotherapies. Partial functional 
reprogramming of tumor-resident Tregs, rather than their complete depletion, 
offers a strategy to weaken their suppressive capacity while retaining 
peripheral immune regulation, thus promoting local anti-tumor responses without 
disrupting tolerance.

Although immunotherapy has become an established approach in cancer treatment, 
not all patients exhibit a positive response. Current research on PD-1 primarily 
focuses on immune cells using conventional methods, yet PD-1 expression on tumor 
cells is also widespread and plays an increasingly critical role in assessing 
immunotherapy efficacy. To address this, we developed an electrochemical 
biosensor capable of specifically detecting PD-1 at both the protein and tumor 
cellular levels in situ, eliminating the need for sample fixation and thereby 
streamlining the analytical process. Additionally, our probe enables 
simultaneous localization analysis of PD-1 through fluorescence signaling. The 
biosensor integrates a bifunctional probe composed of a nanometal-organic 
framework (MOF, ZIF-8) conjugated with quantum dots (QDs) and an electrode 
modified with a carbon nanotube (CNT)-gold nanoparticle (AuNP) nanocomposite. 
The morphology and performance of the nanocomposite were thoroughly 
characterized, and the resulting PD-1 biosensor demonstrates high specificity, 
reproducibility, and sensitivity. To facilitate clinical translation, we 
successfully applied the biosensor to detect differential PD-1 expression across 
various tumor cell lines and cancer tissues. This study establishes that our 
dual-mode electrochemical and fluorescent sensing platform provides a powerful 
tool for in situ PD-1 detection on tumor cells, offering valuable insights for 
evaluating tumor immunotherapy responses.

Is Methylene Blue a Reliable Substitute in Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy? A 
Systematic Review Across Oncologic Sites.

Raj S, Mahaldar R, Memon S.

BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a pivotal technique for 
evaluating regional lymphatic spread in breast, melanoma, and gynecologic 
malignancies. It minimizes surgical morbidity by avoiding complete 
lymphadenectomy in early-stage disease. The standard dual-tracer 
approach-combining a radiocolloid such as technetium-99m with a blue dye like 
patent blue or isosulfan blue-has high sensitivity but is not universally 
accessible. Radiocolloids require nuclear medicine facilities' licensing and 
pose logistical burdens, while patent blue may provoke allergic reactions, 
including anaphylaxis. These limitations are particularly pronounced in low- and 
middle-income countries (LMICs), where access and affordability are ongoing 
challenges. Methylene blue (MB), a low-cost, widely available dye, has gained 
traction as an alternative tracer, offering a safer and more feasible option for 
SLNB in resource-limited settings.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review evaluates the diagnostic accuracy, detection 
reliability, and safety profile of methylene blue dye in SLNB across diverse 
oncologic sites, emphasizing comparing outcomes with traditional dual-tracer 
approaches.
METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library was 
conducted for studies published from 2000 to 2025. Inclusion criteria comprised 
clinical studies utilizing MB for SLNB in breast, melanoma, gynaecological, or 
other solid tumours, reporting outcomes such as detection rate, false-negative 
rate, or tracer-related complications. Data were extracted and synthesized 
descriptively. Where possible, pooled performance metrics were calculated.
RESULTS: Twenty-five studies encompassing 5,240 patients were included. The 
pooled sentinel node detection rate using MB alone was 84.5% (72.0-96.2%), with 
a false-negative rate of 8.6%. When MB was combined with radiocolloid, detection 
rates improved to 96.1%, and false-negative rates dropped below 5%. Adverse 
effects were rare, with skin necrosis in fewer than 2% of cases and no serious 
allergic events reported. Most studies focused on breast cancer (18/25), while 
data on melanoma and gynecologic cancers were comparatively limited.
CONCLUSION: Methylene blue is a viable alternative for SLNB, particularly in 
environments where dual-tracer methods are impractical. Though slightly less 
sensitive than dual-tracer techniques, MB offers substantial advantages in cost, 
safety, and accessibility. Further multicenter studies and long-term outcomes 
are needed to support its broader adoption in global oncology practice.

BACKGROUND: Sexual health is a significant aspect of health-related quality of 
life. Impaired sexual health adversely affects the well-being and relationship 
between cancer patients and their partners.
AIM: To investigate the attitudes and perceptions of sexual health among 
advanced cancer patients and partners, and the impact of cancer on sexual health 
in the Asian context.
DESIGN: Reflexive thematic analysis was applied to the data collected from 
semi-structured face-to-face interviews, which were transcribed verbatim.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Stage 3 and 4 cancer patients and partners were recruited 
at the oncology outpatient clinic in Malaysia.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients (13 [72%] female, median age 38.5 (interquartile 
range 17.5) years and nine partners (8 [89%] male, median age 33 (interquartile 
range 15) years were interviewed. Main themes include: (1) physical intimacy 
remains a vital part of the relationship, (2) impact of cancer on sexual desire, 
activity and satisfaction, (3) impact of cancer on patient-partner relationship, 
(4) changes in perceptions of body image, attractiveness and self-esteem, and 
(5) patient-partner coping mechanisms. Most participants perceived both physical 
and emotional intimacy as important and felt their relationship improved 
post-cancer due to better communication and more support from their partners. 
Coping strategies include acceptance of their illness, prioritising cancer 
control over sexual needs, and finding meaning through spirituality.
CONCLUSION: Although cancer can reduce sexual desire and satisfaction, sexual 
health and relationship well-being can be maintained through emotional and 
physical intimacy, improved communication, companionship and support, and 
psycho-spiritual coping strategies. Further research is needed to develop sexual 
health interventions that are culturally adaptable and effective across diverse 
populations.

Both Ménétrier's disease (MD) and juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) are rare 
premalignant conditions that can lead to gastric cancer. MD is an acquired 
disease without known causative mutations that is characterized by increased 
expression of an EGF receptor (EGFR) ligand, transforming growth factor-alpha 
(TGFα), in the stomach. JPS is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is 
caused by BMPR1A or SMAD4 mutations. Although there are distinct 
clinico-pathological features that differ between the two diseases, they also 
share similar features that often lead to misdiagnosis. To identify diagnostic 
markers for MD and to better understand the pathogenesis of the disease, we 
performed transcriptomic profiling of stomach tissues from normal (NL), MD, and 
JPS patients. Comparative analysis between MD and JPS revealed both common and 
differential gene signatures. Common gene signatures included estrogen receptor 
signaling, integrin signaling, mTOR signaling, and others, which may be 
responsible for histopathological similarities. Among differential gene 
signatures, we found that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is upregulated in MD and 
confirmed that protein expression of Hh signaling downstream targets, GLI1 
(glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1) and HHIP (Hedgehog-interacting protein), 
is higher in MD than in JPS, particularly in foveolar cells by 
immunohistochemistry. We also demonstrated that treatment with an Hh pathway 
inhibitor partially rescued the histopathological phenotypes in an MD mouse 
model. This study provides valuable insights into the potential mechanisms 
underlying the similar clinico-pathological features observed in MD and JPS. We 
also identified GLI1 and HHIP as diagnostic markers that can help to distinguish 
MD from JPS. Furthermore, Hh signaling was shown to play an important role in 
the pathogenesis of MD and may serve as a potential therapeutic target. © 2025

OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to examine the relationship between cancer 
patients' spiritual needs and their quality of life and depression levels.
METHODS: This cross-sectional, exploratory study was conducted between March 
2023 and November 2024. The study population consisted of cancer patients 
hospitalized in medical oncology departments at a university hospital in eastern 
Turkey. The sample consisted of 250 patients, determined by power analysis. To 
collect data, the ""Demographic Information Form,"" ""Spiritual Needs Assessment 
Scale,"" ""EORTC QLQ-C30 Version 3.0 Quality of Life Scale,"" and ""Beck Depression 
Scale"" were used to evaluate the patients' sociodemographic characteristics and 
disease process.
RESULTS: There was a weak, negative, statistically significant relationship 
between patients' spiritual needs and the subdimensions of the quality of life 
scale, specifically the general perceived health status (r = -0.297, p < 0.001), 
physical (r = -0.446, p < 0.001), role (r = -0.423, p < 0.001), emotional (r = 
-0.472, p < 0.001), cognitive (r = -0.458, p < 0.001) and social (r = -0.443, p 
< 0.001) functions, and finally, a weak positive correlation was found between 
the symptoms experienced (r = 0.376, p < 0.001) and depression levels. 
Additionally, a weak positive correlation between spiritual needs and depression 
level (r = 0.374, p < 0.001) was identified. Functional areas, depression, 
education level, diagnosis duration, and symptoms were identified as variables 
predicting spiritual needs.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: In conclusion, it was determined that as the spiritual 
needs of cancer patients increased, their quality of life decreased and the 
severity of depression increased.

Longitudinal Data Subject to Irregular Observations.

Longitudinal data are often subject to irregular visiting times, with outcomes 
and visit times influenced by a latent variable. Semi-parametric joint models 
that account for this dependence have been proposed; among these, the Sun model 
is the most suitable for count data as it employs a multiplicative link 
function. Semi-parametric joint models define an intercept function as the mean 
outcome when all covariates are set to zero; this is differenced out in the 
course of estimation and is consequently not estimated. The Sun estimator thus 
provides estimates of relative covariate effects, but is unable to provide 
estimates of absolute effects or of longitudinal prognosis in the absence of 
covariates. We extend the Sun model by additionally estimating the intercept 
term, showing that our extended estimator is consistent and asymptotically 
Normal. In simulations, our estimator outperforms the original Sun estimator in 
terms of bias and standard error and is also more computationally efficient. We 
apply our estimator to a longitudinal study of tumor recurrence among bladder 
cancer patients. Provided the intercept term can be adequately captured using 
splines, we recommend that our extended Sun estimator be used in place of the 
original estimator, since it leads to smaller bias, smaller standard errors, and 
allows estimation of the mean outcome trajectories.

BACKGROUND: There are no methods for the early detection of human 
papillomavirus-driven oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPV+OPSCC); 
however, HPV16 E6 seropositivity has been identified as a promising screening 
marker. Although people living with HIV have a higher risk of developing 
HPV+OPSCC, few studies have evaluated the association between HPV16 antibodies 
and HPV+OPSCC.
METHODS: The association between HPV16 seropositivity (L1, E1, E2, E4, E6, and 
E7) and OPSCC was assessed among 2331 men living with HIV (MLWH) aged ≥40 years 
who had blood specimens banked within the Tennessee Center for AIDS Research 
biorepository between 2001 and 2019; some samples were collected before OPSCC 
diagnosis, and others after. The association between HPV16 seropositivity and 
OPSCC was analyzed via univariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-five HPV16 E6 seropositive cases and 11 OPSCC 
cases were identified. HPV16 E6 seropositivity was associated with a 14-fold 
higher odds of OPSCC (odds ratio [OR], 14.04; 95% CI, 4.23-46.61; p < .001); 
five of the 11 OPSCC cases were HPV16 E6 seropositive (sensitivity, 45%; 95% CI, 
17%-77%) compared to 6% of controls (specificity, 94%; 95% CI, 93%-95%). 
Seroreactivity against HPV16 E1 (OR, 7.14; 95% CI, 1.52-33.67; p = .013), HPV16 
E2 (OR, 16.43; 95% CI, 4.94-54.65; p < .001), and HPV16 E7 (OR, 13.84; 95% CI, 
3.99-48.11; p < .001) was also significantly associated with OPSCC. HPV16 E6 
antibodies were detectable up to 9 years before and 19 years after OPSCC 
diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Among MLWH, HPV16 E6 antibodies are strongly associated with OPSCC, 
yet point estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of HPV16 E6 antibodies 
for OPSCC were lower compared to studies in populations without HIV.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the number of cancer-related deaths that could be 
attributed to spatial disparities in survival.
DESIGN: Cohort study of cancer registry data.
SETTING: Australia, 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2019.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The numbers and percentages of cancer-related deaths 
attributable to spatial disparities in survival were estimated by calculating 
the numbers of cancer-related deaths that would have occurred if all areas in 
Australia met or exceeded a benchmark 5-year survival rate. This benchmark 
corresponded to the survival rate of the area with survival better than 80% of 
all areas, with ""area"" referring to residential location at diagnosis.
RESULTS: Of all 289 075 cancer-related deaths in Australia in 2010-2019, 33 892 
(11.7%) were attributable to spatial disparities in survival. Although numbers 
were greatest in major cities, as remoteness and area disadvantage increased, 
the percentages of cancer-related deaths attributable to spatial disparities in 
survival increased. Of all cancer-related deaths in remote areas and the most 
socio-economically disadvantaged areas, 1569 of 5208 (30.1%) and 13 469 of 
66 775 (20.2%) deaths were attributable to survival disparities, respectively. 
The highest numbers and percentages of attributable cancer deaths in remote 
areas were for rare cancers (529/1809 [29.3%]), lung cancer (300/1298 [23.1%]) 
and head and neck cancers (162/370 [43.8%]). In the most disadvantaged areas, 
rare cancers (3070/20 512 [15.0%]) and lung cancer (2640/18 057 [14.6%]) had the 
highest numbers of attributable cancer deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings quantify the impact of spatial disparities in 
survival and highlight the need for equitable access to diagnostic and treatment 
services across Australia.

BACKGROUND: The risk of subsequent ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive 
breast cancer (IBC) has been evaluated in either breast after a DCIS diagnosis; 
this study modeled competing risks of ipsilateral and contralateral DCIS or IBC 
subtypes by self-reported race.
METHODS: A cohort of 198,827 women diagnosed with primary unilateral DCIS 
between 2000 and 2022 was identified from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and 
End Results tumor registries. Competing subdistributional hazard ratio (sHR) 
models were used to estimate DCIS or IBC laterality-associated risks overall and 
for the estrogen receptor (ER+) or progesterone receptor (PR+) overexpressing 
(ER+/PR+) and ER-PR- expressing tumor subtypes. Cox models were used for 
subanalysis to estimate the overall risk of a second event (DCIS or IBC).
RESULTS: Within an average of 10 (±6.1) years of follow-up after the initial 
DCIS, 16,148 women had a subsequent event (25.7% DCIS; 74.3% IBC). Overall, 
compared with White women, Black women had an elevated risk of IBC for either 
tumor subtype, whereas Asian and Hispanic women had an elevated risk of ER-PR- 
IBC. For tumor aggressiveness by laterality, Black women had an elevated IBC 
risk in either breast for ER-PR- (sHR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.53-2.17 in the 
ipsilateral breast; sHR, 1.512; 95% CI, 1.24-1.86 in the contralateral breast), 
as did Hispanic and Asian women in the ipsilateral breast only (with stronger 
association vs. ER+/PR+) (phet = .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: These contemporary data reflect treatment patterns since 2000, 
which show an elevated risk of subsequent breast tumors in either breast among 
Black women after DCIS.

BACKGROUND: Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard treatment for 
locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC), but there are still many patients who 
suffer tumor recurrence. However, valuable predictors of treatment outcomes 
remain limited. This study aimed to assess the value of the serum immune 
biomarkers to predict the prognosis.
METHODS: We reviewed cervical cancer patients treated with CCRT between January 
2014 and May 2018 at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The systemic immune 
inflammation index (SII), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), and 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were calculated using blood samples. The 
relationship between immune markers and the treatment outcome was analyzed. The 
area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to 
evaluate the predictive efficiency. The Cox proportional hazards model and 
log-rank were used to predict overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival 
(DFS).
RESULTS: This study included 667 patients. Among them, 195 (29.2%) patients were 
defined as treatment failure, including 127 (19.0%) patients with pelvic 
failure, 94 (14.1%) distant failure, and 25 (3.7%) concurrent pelvic and distant 
failure. It revealed that the tumor stage, size, metastatic lymph nodes (MLNs), 
and serum immune biomarkers, such as SII, SIRI, and LDH, were significantly 
related to treatment outcomes. We demonstrated that the optimal cut-off of the 
SII, SIRI, and LDH were 970.4 × 109/L, 1.3 × 109/L, and 207.52 U/L, 
respectively. Importantly, this study presented that LDH level had the highest 
OR (OR = 4.2; 95% CI [2.3-10.8]). Furthermore, the OS and DFS for patients with 
pre-SII ≥970.5 × 109/L were significantly worse than those with pre-SII <970.5 × 
109/L. Similarly, pre-SIRI ≥1.25 × 109/L and pre-LDH ≥207.5 U/L were related to 
poor survival outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the baseline SII, SIRI, and LDH levels 
can be used to accurately and effectively predict the treatment outcomes after 
CCRT and long-term prognosis. Our results may offer additional prognostic 
information in clinical, which helps to detect the potential recurrent 
metastasis in time.

BACKGROUND: Clinical nutrition (CN) is becoming increasingly complex because of 
the rising prevalence of chronic illness, cancer, and malnutrition-related 
conditions such as short bowel syndrome and refeeding syndrome. Despite its 
clinical significance, nutrition education among US physicians remains limited. 
Simultaneously, large language model (LLM)-based artificial intelligence 
assistants (AIAs) have emerged as tools to support complex clinical 
decision-making but remain largely untested in CN.
METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated four LLM-based AIAs-ChatGPT 
(OpenAI), OpenEvidence (OpenEvidence Inc), Gemini (Google, Google DeepMind), and 
Copilot (Microsoft Corporation)-using five complex CN cases from our nutrition 
support service. Each AIA was queried with patient-specific CN questions. 
Responses were blinded and reviewed by five physician CN experts using an 
eight-item assessment tool evaluating clarity, relevance, evidence, and clinical 
utility.
RESULTS: All AIAs produced clinically appropriate responses, with Gemini scoring 
highest in relevance (4.04) and clarity (4.16). Overall satisfaction scores 
ranged from 3.08 (Copilot) to 3.84 (Gemini). Citation quality and originality of 
insights varied and were generally limited, and no consistent differences in 
performance were observed across the five cases among the four AIAs.
CONCLUSION: LLM-based AIAs can reliably replicate expert reasoning in CN. 
Although not yet a source of novel clinical insights, the true potential of this 
approach may lie in its application among physicians without specialized 
expertise in CN, helping to bridge existing knowledge gaps in nutrition care. 
Presenting full clinical cases, as shown in this study, could support 
AIA-enabled e-consultation in the future, thereby addressing gaps in CN 
education.

BACKGROUND: Evidence-based and/or consensus guidance regarding exercise and 
return-to-play for the adolescent and young adult (AYA) athlete with 
cardio-oncology concerns is lacking. Many of the recommendations utilized for 
the diagnosis, surveillance, and management of cancer therapeutic-related 
cardiotoxicity in children have been extrapolated from adult literature and 
myocarditis guidelines, the latter of which are primarily concerned with 
potential for arrhythmias secondary to inflammation and myocardial scarring. In 
addition, the athlete's heart itself brings about several diagnostic challenges 
including physiologic changes due to endurance or isometric training. 
Exercise-induced cardiac remodeling, with enlarged cavity size, lower resting 
ejection fraction and increased left ventricular wall thickness, depending on 
the type of exercise, can mimic disease states including both underlying 
pathologies and the response to cancer therapeutics.
CASE PRESENTATION: A high school cancer survivor had borderline ejection 
fraction and abnormal strain indices. He was able to return to competitive 
sports without complication after clinical evaluation and through a shared 
decision-making process.
CONCLUSIONS: The difficulty in differentiating physiologic from potentially 
pathologic echocardiographic changes can result in unnecessary disqualification, 
depriving athletes from social, psychological, and possibly financial benefits. 
Stress echocardiography indices, such as contractile reserve and mitral E/e' 
ratio, may inform assessment of systolic and diastolic function, respectively, 
and may be helpful in risk stratifying and understanding potential performance 
limitations in AYA athletes with cardio-oncology concerns for exercise and 
return-to-play. Most recent consensus statements regarding sports participation 
in the athlete with heart disease focus on a shared decision-making process 
amongst all stakeholders involved to formulate an informed, safe, and cohesive 
prescription to enable the athlete to safely re-engage in sports after 
recovering from a cardiac illness or surgery. Multidisciplinary recommendations 
emphasize the importance of exercise before, during, and after chemotherapy in 
an individualized approach to reduce risk factors in oncology patients and 
improve cardiovascular outcomes. Further research is needed to delineate 
protocols for the adolescent and young adult cardio-oncology athlete regarding 
exercise prescriptions and their return-to-play following oncology treatment.

OBJECTIVES: Complementing the previously published cohort-internal comparison we 
hereby compare the cause-specific mortality in workers of the Asbest Chrysotile 
Cohort study (ACC) with the general population of Sverdlovsk Oblast where the 
mine and factories are located.
METHODS: The ACC cohort database and the regional Federal State Statistic 
Service for the Sverdlovsk Oblast population were used. We calculated 
sex-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) for the main ICD-10 disease groups and for selected cancer sites for the 
populations ≥ 15 years from 1980 to 2015. In relation to exposure, we applied 
the Sverdlovsk rates to the person-years in each exposure category to obtain 
expected numbers of lung cancer deaths. For comparing types of ACC workers 
(mine, enrichment factories, both), we calculated lung cancer SMRs in men by 
duration of employment (< 5 years, 5–14 years, and ≥ 15 years) and start of 
employment (before or after 1975) with miners as reference in each stratum.
RESULTS: Overall mortality of men in the ACC was reduced by 14%, mainly because 
of the most common cause of death, circulatory disease; this effect was much 
weaker in women. Elevated mortality was observed for both sexes from diseases of 
the digestive system (10–30%) and blood and blood forming organs (121–181%). 
Lung cancer mortality in men was increased from the 3rd quartile of chrysotile 
containing dust and in the highest quartile with SMR 1.30, 95% CI 1.07–1.57, 
while the increase in high exposed women was not reaching statistical 
significance (SMR 1.69, 95% CI 0.87–2.96). No increased SMRs were seen for 
laryngeal, stomach or ovarian cancers. Male factory workers first employed 
before 1975 had higher lung cancer mortality compared to miners, but not when 
employed after 1974.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed excess in lung cancer confirms previous observations 
in the ACC. Risk management measures in the enrichment factories may have 
reduced the lung cancer risk to the level of the miners in recent decades.

Recent evidence suggests that red blood cells (RBCs) may actively regulate 
course of tumor disease, whereas red cell distribution width (RDW) might even 
serve as surrogate marker of tumor progression. Here, we investigated the 
clinical and molecular significance of RDW in breast (BrCa) and d’Amico 
high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Higher RDW (RDWhigh) was associated 
with metastatic disease, poorer survival, therapy resistance, elevated 
circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts, proinflammatory mediators profiles and some 
comorbidities such as cardiological disorders or diabetes. Gene expression 
analysis of primary tumors from patients characterized by RDWhigh revealed 
deregulation of genes involved in inflammation, immune modulation, cell 
adhesion, and migration. Using imaging flow cytometry (imFC), we identified for 
the first time direct RBC-CTC interactions (CTCRBC) in almost 9% of PCa 
patients. The presence of CTCRBC correlated with lymph node involvement and 
shorter time-to-biochemical recurrence. Those CTCs interacting with RBCs 
displayed predominantly epithelial phenotype and lacked protrusions. 
Collectively, these results provide clinical and molecular evidence that RBCs 
can modulate tumor progression both indirectly, potentially through systemic 
inflammation, and directly, via physical interactions with CTCs. Importantly, 
our findings highlight the potential of RDW, a routinely measured blood 
parameter, as a simple and clinically meaningful biomarker of tumor progression 
and dissemination.

TFE3-rearranged renal cell carcinoma (TFE3-RCC) represents an aggressive subtype 
of renal cancer characterized by a poor prognosis, yet lacking clearly defined 
diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Here, the study demonstrates that synaptic 
vesicle protein 2B (SV2B) is a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic 
target for TFE3-RCC. SV2B, identified as a TFE3 target gene, is significantly 
upregulated in TFE3-RCC and displays high diagnostic accuracy for this subtype. 
Functionally, SV2B enhances the proliferation, migration, and invasion of 
TFE3-RCC cells. Mechanistically, SV2B competes with RELA/NFKB1 for binding to 
the E3 ligase HERC2, preventing their degradation and activating the NF-κB 
pathway. The drug padsevonil, targeting SV2B, selectively inhibits the growth of 
TFE3-RCC cells and organoids, similar to the NF-κB inhibitor Withaferin A. 
Clinically, RELA/NFKB1 expression positively correlates with SV2B levels but 
negatively with HERC2 expression, confirming the activation of TFE3-SV2B-NF-κB 
axis in TFE3-RCC. These findings establish SV2B as a novel diagnostic biomarker 
for TFE3-RCC and validate SV2B-NF-κB signaling as a therapeutic target, 
providing potential strategies for managing TFE3-RCC.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer driven by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection 
remains a critical global health challenge. Co-infection with Trichomonas 
vaginalis, a prevalent sexually transmitted protozoan, is strongly associated 
with increased susceptibility to HPV, yet the molecular basis for this synergy 
is unclear. Here, we investigated the role of T. vaginalis adhesion protein 65 
(TvAP65) in HPV entry, focusing on its interaction with host factors in 
epithelium.
METHODS: Using in vitro (human adult low calcium high temperature keratinocytes, 
HaCaT cells) and in vivo (BALB/c athymic nude mice, BALB/cA-nu mice) models, we 
assessed HPV infection rates and the expression of HPV entry receptors (cluster 
of differentiation 151, CD151 and heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2, HSPG2) under 
T. vaginalis exposure. TvAP65 was either knocked down or overexpressed to 
evaluate its functional impact. A siRNA screen targeting 12 host molecules that 
interact with TvAP65 identified signal peptidase complex subunit 1 (SPCS1) as a 
key mediator. Dual knockdown of TvAP65 and SPCS1 or HPV receptors (CD151/HSPG2) 
was performed to dissect mechanistic hierarchies. Statistical analyses were 
performed using Student's t-test for two-group comparisons and analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) for comparisons involving three or more groups (P < 0.05).
RESULTS: T. vaginalis markedly enhanced HPV entry in epithelial cells by 
upregulating CD151 and HSPG2 (P < 0.001). TvAP65 knockdown reversed this effect, 
reducing HPV infection by 21.76 ± 0.12% (P < 0.001) and protein-level expression 
of the receptors (P < 0.001), while overexpression amplified both. Strikingly, 
SPCS1 knockdown alone attenuated HPV infection by 33.61 ± 0.40% and abolished T. 
vaginalis-driven CD151/HSPG2 upregulation. Dual knockdown of TvAP65 and SPCS1 
synergistically suppressed HPV entry (54.64 ± 0.39% reduction, P < 0.001), 
confirming the central role of SPCS1 in TvAP65-mediated receptor activation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study unveils a previously uncharacterized mechanism by which 
T. vaginalis exacerbates HPV infection: TvAP65 hijacks SPCS1 to 
transcriptionally upregulate CD151 and HSPG2, thereby facilitating HPV entry 
into host cells. This TvAP65-SPCS1-CD151/HSPG2 axis highlights potential 
therapeutic targets to disrupt the synergy between HPV and T. vaginalis, 
offering new strategies for cervical cancer prevention.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been considerable interest in addressing 
racial disparities in prostate cancer (PCa) care including risk-adapted 
screening. This study examined trends in metastatic PCa incidence by race and 
placed them in context of changes in PSA screening recommendations.
METHODS: We analyzed metastatic PCa incidence trends by race (using Surveillance 
Epidemiology and End Results data, 2005-2021) and PSA screening trends (using 
Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance Survey data, 2012-2020). We fitted a 
generalized linear model with an interaction term for race and year of diagnosis 
and calculated annual incidence rate ratios (metastatic disease) and odds ratios 
(screening) for Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) vs. Non-Hispanic White (NHW) men.
RESULTS: From 2005 to 2021, the age-adjusted metastatic PCa incidence (per 
100,000) increased from 16.4 to 22.3 in NHB men, and from 6.2 to 10.8 in NHW 
men. While the incidence increased in both groups, the NHB vs. NHW incidence 
rate ratio declined from 2.6 (95%CI: 2.4, 2.9) in 2005 to 2.1 (95%CI:2.0,2.2) in 
2021 (p < .0001), indicating a narrowing racial gap. From 2012 to 2020, PSA 
screening declined in both groups. NHB men initially had higher rates (OR:1.34, 
95%CI: 1.21, 1.49, p < 0.0001) but experienced a steeper decline, resulting in 
no significant difference by 2020 (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.91, 1.19, p = 0.59).
CONCLUSIONS: The racial gap in metastatic PCa narrowed over the study period, 
while overall incidence increased. Higher screening rates among Black men in the 
early 2010s may explain the narrowing gap. The subsequent more rapid decline 
among Black men raises concerns about resurgence of racial disparities in the 
coming years.

BACKGROUND: Chromatin regulators (CRs) play a critical role in tumorigenesis, 
drug response, and prognosis, with dysregulation of chromatin regulator genes 
(CRGs) potentially disrupting the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) and 
influencing immune responses in cervical cancer. However, the prognostic and 
therapeutic implications of integrating CRGs and TME parameters in cervical 
cancer remain poorly understood.
METHODS: This study used prognostic CRGs and TME cell signatures identified 
through Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses to construct the CRG 
and TME score. The CRG score for each cell was calculated by integrating 
single-cell and spatial transcriptome, which were subsequently integrated to 
develop a CRG-TME classifier for prognostic prediction. The prognosis, somatic 
mutations, immune characteristics, therapeutic benefits, and drug sensitivity 
were then analyzed across CRG-TME defined subgroups.
RESULTS: Both CRG score and TME score demonstrated prognostic value, and the 
high CRG score group showed distinct alterations in TME signaling dynamics and 
increased intensity of intercellular communication. Patients in CRGlow/TMEhigh 
subgroup exhibited enhanced prognosis and therapeutic responses compared to 
other subgroups, attributable to variations in tumor somatic mutations, 
immune-related molecules, cancer signaling pathways and drug sensitivity. 
Additionally, the clinical sample verification and in vitro experiments 
demonstrated that the key prognostic gene TSPYL2 was downregulated in cervical 
cancer tissues and overexpression of TSPYL2 inhibited the malignant progression 
of cervical cancer cells via regulating MAPK pathway and immune escape.
CONCLUSIONS: This study develops a novel CRG-TME classifier to predict prognosis 
and therapy response in cervical cancer and unveils the inhibitory effect and 
underlying mechanism of TSPYL2 on cervical cancer progression.

BACKGROUND: Fertility preservation is crucial for females facing gonadotoxic 
treatments. Controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) followed by oocyte 
cryopreservation is a well-established method, while ovarian tissue-derived 
oocyte in vitro maturation (OTO-IVM) is an emerging technique that can be used 
when COS is contraindicated or time is limited. However, OTO-IVM faces 
challenges such as low oocyte maturation rates and limited follow-up data. This 
study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of COS oocyte cryopreservation and 
OTO-IVM, with a focus on the impact of transportation methods and the use of 
gonadotropin (Gn) before oophorectomy on OTO-IVM outcomes.
METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed data from 472 patients who underwent 
fertility preservation procedures at the Reproductive Medicine Research Center, 
The Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, from July 2012 to July 
2024. Patients diagnosed with cancer or requiring gonadotoxic treatments were 
included. The study compared oocyte maturation, fertilization, and embryo 
transfer outcomes between COS and OTO-IVM groups. Statistical analyses were 
performed using Student's t-test for continuous data and Chi-squared or Fisher's 
exact test for categorical data, with significance defined as P < 0.05.
RESULTS: COS group resulted in a significantly higher oocyte maturation rate 
(86.11%) compared to OTO-IVM group (39.43%). Direct oocyte transport yielded a 
higher rate of denuded oocytes compared to ovarian tissue transport. The use of 
Gn before oophorectomy in OTO-IVM significantly improved the IVM maturation rate 
(51.90% vs. 38.00%, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: COS oocyte cryopreservation remains more effective than OTO-IVM. 
However, the study highlighted the importance of optimizing transportation 
methods and using Gn before oophorectomy to improve OTO-IVM outcomes. These 
findings could guide clinical practice in selecting appropriate fertility 
preservation strategies. Further research is needed to refine OTO-IVM techniques 
and enhance their clinical applicability.

BACKGROUND: Non- synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) impact 
disease onset and progression. Protein kinase C zeta (PRKCZ) is involved in 
oncological, neurological, and diabetes pathogenesis. The goal of the research 
presented here was to investigate the role of nsSNPs in PRKCZ in breast cancer 
(BC) pathogenesis.
METHODS: Genotyping analysis was performed to determine the association of PRKCZ 
genetic variants rs1236161858 (G/T), rs367917640 (G/A/C), rs202071893(A/G), and 
rs757469768(G/A) with BC risk and clinicopathological variables through 
Tetra-ARMS PCR.
RESULTS: rs1236161858(G/T) was linked to higher BC risk in codominant 
(OR = 5.227, RR = 2.225), allele model, (OR = 4.701, and RR = 2.186) and log 
additive (OR = 2.564). rs367917640 (G/A) was associated with increased BC risk 
in codominant model (OR = 6.419, RR = 2.350), recessive model (OR = 12.09 and, 
RR = 4.772) and log additive (OR = 3.340). rs367917640(G/C) was linked to higher 
BC risk in dominant (OR = 4.892, RR = 2.208), recessive (OR = 1.859, RR = 1.34), 
over dominant (OR = 3.675, RR = 2.028) and log additive (1.579) models 
respectively. For rs202071893(A/G) codominant model (OR = 2.295 RR = 1.547), 
dominant model (OR = 5.943, and RR = 1.781) and over dominant model (OR = 3.433, 
and RR = 1.974) showed significantly higher BC association. rs757469768(G/A) was 
linked to higher BC risk in both dominant (OR = 0.1479, and RR = 0.4688) and 
over dominant (OR = 2.005, and RR = 1.455) models. However, rs757469768(G/A) was 
associated with reduced BC risk in log additive model (OR = 0.4956).rs1236161858 
correlated with DCIS and IDC. rs367917640(G/A/C) correlated with early cancer 
stage, LCIS, DCIS, IDC, luminal A and post-menopause. rs202071893 was associated 
with HER2+and IDC. rs757469768 was not associated with clinicopathological 
features and risk factors.
CONCLUSION: All five nsSNPs exhibited potential as predictive and prognostic 
biomarkers for BC. However, the current study findings should be validated by 
conducting research on large cohorts with representation from diverse 
population. Furthermore, biological mechanism by which these nsSNPs cause BC 
pathogenesis could be explored in future studies.

INTRODUCTION: High-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs) are challenging to 
treat and often resistant to therapy. Despite ongoing therapeutic progress, 
relapse and poor outcomes remain common among both newly diagnosed and recurrent 
cases. Systematic high-throughput screening of clinically approved compounds 
holds significant promise for uncovering novel therapeutic responses and 
developing new treatment strategies for this disease.
METHODS: A panel of drugs were screened for cytotoxicity in five HGSOC cell 
lines, with drug efficacy quantified using the drug sensitivity score (DSS). All 
pairwise combinations of 384 low-cytotoxic drugs were screened by grouping 10 
compounds in each well. The potent 10-compound combinations were deconvoluted 
into 2-drug pairings for secondary screening and ranked by the Bliss independent 
model and the Loewe additive model. Promising drug responses were further 
characterised in 3D spheroid cultures and patient ascites-derived cells (PADCs). 
The mechanism of action of the drugs was investigated by Western blot analysis.
RESULTS: The DSS profile of drug responses provided a more robust clustering of 
5 HGSOC cell lines according to their chemosensitivity responses compared to 
gene expression analysis of chemoresistance markers. Furthermore, chemoresistant 
HGSOC cell lines exhibited limited efficacy to single-agent treatments and 
generally demonstrated resistance to most anti-cancer agents. However, 
combination screens identified several novel drug pairings that were cytotoxic 
to chemoresistant HGSOC cells. Drug combinations involving traditional 
anticancer agents showed superior synergy and toxicity in chemosensitive cell 
lines, while all cell lines demonstrated good sensitivity to PI3K and HMG-CoA 
reductase inhibitors at sub-maximal clinically relevant concentrations, with the 
greatest sensitivity observed in chemoresistant cells. The combination of PI3K 
and HMG-CoA reductase inhibition significantly reduced the viability and growth 
of HGSOC spheroids. PADCs exhibited intrinsic sensitivity to HMG-CoA inhibition, 
while the combination with PI3K inhibition facilitated further dose reductions. 
Mechanistic studies revealed that the HMG-CoA inhibitor increased phospho-Akt 
levels in chemoresistant cell lines, sensitising them to PI3K inhibition.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the application of multiplex drug 
combination screening to identify effective synergistic therapies. Co-targeting 
PI3-kinase and HMG-CoA reductase could be repurposed as a potent combination to 
treat chemoresistant HGSOC.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of cancer-related 
mortality, with resistance to PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors presenting a 
significant clinical challenge. Although the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 
has been implicated in immune evasion, its precise role in NSCLC and 
contribution to anti-PD-1 resistance remain poorly understood. To address this, 
we conducted a CRISPR-based screen which identified SHP2 as a pivotal factor 
promoting tumor escape from CD8 + T cell-mediated killing. SHP2 expression in 
NSCLC tissues was analyzed through immunohistochemistry (IHC), qRT-PCR, and 
Western blotting. Functional assays, including CCK-8 and colony formation, were 
employed to assess SHP2’s role in tumor proliferation under IFN-γ stimulation. 
Co-culture experiments with CD8 + T cells evaluated the modulation of immune 
responses. Mechanistic investigations focusing on IFN-γ/STAT1/IRF1 signaling and 
CCL5 secretion were analyzed using bulk RNA sequencing, Western blotting, 
qRT-PCR, ELISA, and proximity ligation assays. We found that SHP2 overexpression 
correlated with advanced disease and poor prognosis. Mechanistically, SHP2 
suppressed IFN-γ/STAT1/IRF1 signaling, reducing CCL5 secretion and impairing 
CD8 + T cell cytotoxicity. SHP2 knockdown restored immune responses and 
sensitized tumors to anti-PD-1 therapy. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition 
of SHP2 with JAB-3312 reversed this immunosuppressive phenotype in NSCLC cell 
lines and patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Furthermore, in a syngeneic mouse 
model, JAB-3312 acted synergistically with anti-PD-1 antibodies to suppress 
tumor growth, an effect driven by a potent T-cell-intrinsic mechanism. These 
findings establish SHP2 as a key mediator of immune evasion and PD-1 resistance 
in NSCLC, and targeting SHP2 offers a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome 
immune resistance and improve responses to checkpoint blockade therapy.

BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) H19 has drawn special attention 
because of its varied role in several malignancies, including OSCC. Therefore, 
this study was conducted to assess the association between H19-miR675-p53 by 
in-silico analysis, quantify the expression levels of H19, miRNA-675, and target 
oncogene p53 in cancerous versus normal individuals, and Correlate the 
Clinicopathological findings with their expression pattern.
METHODS: The secondary structure of lncRNA H19 was predicted using the RNAfold 
web server ( http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi ). The 
FASTA sequence of H19 was retrieved from the NCBI database ( 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ). We performed molecular docking studies to 
analyze the interaction between miRNA-675 and p53 using the MDockPP ( 
https://zougrouptoolkit.missouri.edu/MDockPP/ ) web server. Real-time PCR was 
used to measure the amounts of H19 and miR-675, and Immunohistochemistry was 
used to analyse the pattern of p53 expression.
RESULT: The study successfully associated miR-675 from the first exon of H19 
modulating p53 via in silico analysis. It was found that H19 and miR-675 levels 
were higher in OSCC patients (3.12 ± 1.16) compared to healthy patients 
(1.0 ± 0.0), and was statistically significant (p-value < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The specificity of H19 expression in OSCC compared to normal 
presents an attractive target for cancer-specific therapies, minimizing the risk 
of off-target effects.

The Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway is highly conserved and initiated by a 
multiprotein signalosome complex. It is essential for embryonic development, 
organ formation, and tissue homeostasis. Abnormal Wnt signaling is found in many 
malignant tumors, and Wnt mutations are widely known to drive tumor initiation. 
Since the discovery of its oncogenic roles, numerous therapeutic agents have 
been developed, but none have been approved. This is attributed to the inherent 
structural characteristics of its core components and their role in normal 
tissue homeostasis. The majority of clinical drugs are occupancy-driven small 
molecule inhibitors, and most encounter challenges such as off-target effects 
and adverse toxicities. In recent years, targeted protein degradation (TPD) 
technology has emerged as a promising approach, offering a novel strategy for 
drug development targeting the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway. Utilizing this technology 
to degrade key proteins in the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway holds significant potential 
for inhibiting its oncogenic effects and restoring the cancer-immunity cycle (CI 
cycle). This review presents a systematic analysis of the ""undruggability"" of 
the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway and proposes potential strategies ranging from target 
selection to TPD application, with the aim of offering novel insights into 
overcoming this challenge.

BACKGROUND: Informal caregivers play a crucial supportive role throughout the 
course of illnesses, particularly in patients with cancer. Following a cancer 
diagnosis, informal caregivers often experience substantial psychological, 
physical, and social stress, which may lead to conditions such as anxiety and 
sleep disturbances. Therefore, implementing interventions aimed at reducing 
anxiety and improving sleep quality is essential. The present study aims to 
assess the impact of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training on 
anxiety and sleep quality among informal caregivers of patients with cancer.
METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2024 on 66 informal 
caregivers of cancer patients in Bushehr, Iran. Participants were selected using 
convenience sampling method and then randomly assigned to either the 
intervention or control group. The intervention group received eight sessions of 
MBSR training, each lasting 120 min, which included mindfulness meditation, body 
scan, and mindful breathing exercises. The control group received no 
intervention. Data were collected using a demographic form, Spielberger 
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). 
Data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0 through descriptive statistics, independent 
t-test, paired t-test, and ANCOVA at a significance level of 0.05.
RESULTS: The results indicated a statistically significant difference between 
the two groups regarding both anxiety and sleep quality after the intervention 
(anxiety: P < 0.001, ηp² = 0.22; sleep quality: P = 0.004, ηp² = 0.12). In the 
intervention group, the mean anxiety score decreased from 105.94 ± 11.73 
(pretest) to 80.39 ± 13.68 (one-month follow-up), and the mean sleep quality 
score (PSQI) improved from 11.26 ± 2.65 to 9.94 ± 2.09. In contrast, the control 
group showed no significant improvement.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that mindfulness-based 
interventions may help reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality in female 
informal caregivers of cancer patients. This intervention shows promise as a 
potentially effective approach for promoting caregivers’ mental health. However, 
the findings are only applicable to women and cannot be generalized to male 
caregivers, who may experience different social and emotional burdens. In 
addition, the use of a passive control group and the dual role of the instructor 
(intervention delivery and homework monitoring) represent important limitations. 
Furthermore, due to the small sample size, use of convenience sampling, and 
partial blinding, the results should be interpreted with caution. Future 
research should include both genders, use active control conditions, and conduct 
larger long-term randomized trials to confirm these outcomes and assess their 
generalizability across different settings.

OBJECTIVE: This quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a 
WeChat-based self-help psychological intervention combined with rehabilitation 
exercises on disease acceptance, psychological distress, psychological 
resilience, and mindfulness levels in patients with breast cancer.
METHODS: From February 2018 to February 2019, eighty patients diagnosed with 
breast cancer were non-randomly assigned to an observation group (n = 40) and a 
control group (n = 40). The control group received standard WeChat-based health 
education, while the observation group received an additional intervention 
involving self-help psychological strategies (e.g., cognitive reappraisal, 
gratitude journaling) and rehabilitation exercises (e.g., abdominal breathing, 
aerobic activity). Validated instruments including the Self-Acceptance 
Questionnaire, Positive and Negative Affect Scale, Death Attitude 
Profile-Revised (DAP-R), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), 
Psychological Distress Thermometer, and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) 
were used to measure outcomes pre- and post-intervention.
RESULTS: Post-intervention, the observation group showed significantly greater 
improvements in self-acceptance, positive emotions, resilience, and mindfulness 
compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Psychological distress, negative 
emotions, and fear-related death attitudes (e.g., escape acceptance, fear of 
death) significantly decreased in the observation group compared to control 
(P < 0.05). Nursing satisfaction was also significantly higher in the 
observation group (95%) than in the control group (75%) (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: WeChat-based self-help psychological interventions combined with 
rehabilitation exercises are effective in improving psychological resilience, 
mindfulness, and disease acceptance while reducing emotional distress in breast 
cancer patients. These results support the integration of mobile health 
platforms in psycho-oncological care.

BACKGROUND: The widespread use of pesticides, including glyphosate-based 
herbicides (e.g., Roundup®, R) and chlorpyrifos-based insecticides (e.g., 
Clorpi48®, C), has raised concerns about their environmental and human health 
impacts. Growing evidence links pesticide exposure to cancer development. Given 
the critical role of immune surveillance in tumor growth control, environmental 
pollutants such as pesticides should also be evaluated for immunotoxicity. 
Moreover, while individual pesticides have been extensively studied, the effects 
of pesticide mixtures on human immune cells remain poorly explored. Here, we 
assessed the impact of environmentally relevant doses of R, C, or their 
combination (R+C) on immune cell functions.
METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), NK cells, and T cells from 
healthy donors were exposed to environmentally relevant doses of R, C, or R+C. 
NK cell cytotoxicity, T-bet expression and IFN-g production were analyzed by 
flow cytometry, and immune synapse formation (LFA-1 localization) and perforin 
polarization were analyzed by confocal microscopy. T-cell proliferation, Th1 
differentiation, and IL-2 signaling were also evaluated by flow cytometry. 
Oxidative stress was quantified using a fluorometric assay by measuring H2O2 
production in PBMCs exposed to R, C, or R+C. Also, the role of oxidative stress 
in T-cell dysfunction was assessed.
RESULTS: The combination of R+C, but not the individual compounds, significantly 
impaired NK cell cytotoxicity, IFN-g production, and immune synapse formation, 
as evidenced by disrupted LFA-1 localization and defective perforin 
polarization. In T cells, R+C exposure inhibited proliferation, Th1 
differentiation, IL-2 signaling, and IFN-g secretion by CD8⁺ T cells, all key 
functions for effective antitumor responses. Mechanistically, oxidative stress 
contributed to the antiproliferative effect, as scavenging of H2O2 by catalase 
addition restored T cell proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: Environmentally relevant doses of glyphosate and chlorpyrifos-based 
pesticide mixtures disrupt innate and adaptive immune effector functions that 
are critical for the control of neoplastic cells and nascent tumor foci, 
suggesting that current risk assessments underestimate the immunotoxicity of 
combined formulations.

BACKGROUND: Phosphorylation of eIF4E by MNK1/2 modulates protein synthesis by 
controlling the translation of specific mRNAs. Immune cells use the MNK1/2-eIF4E 
axis to adapt their gene expression in response to environmental cues, but its 
dysregulated activity promotes disease progression. While recent examples using 
cancer models have identified CD8+ T-cells as a conduit for the tumor-supporting 
role of the MNK1/2-eIF4E axis, the impact of phospho-eIF4E on CD4+ T-cell 
subsets, specifically regulatory T-cells, remains unclear. To fill this 
knowledge gap, we studied the impact of phospho-eIF4E-deficiency on Treg 
activity in mice in an inflammatory context using a model of murine colitis and 
in human PBMCs.
RESULTS: We found that Tregs isolated from mice deficient for phospho-eIF4E 
(expressing a serine-to-alanine mutation at S209) had a diminished ability to 
control CD4+ T-cell proliferation and IFNγ secretion in vitro. We further report 
aggravated colitis in mice deficient in phospho-eIF4E accompanied by an increase 
in CD4+ T-cells expressing IFNγ and a reduction in Tregs in the mesenteric lymph 
nodes and colon. Mechanistically, T-cells lacking phospho-eIF4E show impaired 
differentiation into Tregs, and Tregs lacking phospho-eIF4E have reduced FoxP3 
expression and diminished migration to the lymph nodes. Using human PBMCs, 
anti-CTLA-4, but not anti-PD-1, reduced the phospho-eIF4E-expressing Treg 
population.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data highlight a role for phospho-eIF4E in 
Treg biology and in the control of inflammation.

BACKGROUND: Making precise treatment decisions in esophageal cancer is essential 
for enhancing patient outcomes and avoiding overtreatment. Traditional 
approaches relying on special features or shallow learning models often fail to 
capture the complex, multi-scale patterns embedded in PET/CT imaging data. 
Recent advances in deep learning provide an opportunity to build more robust, 
data-driven systems for predictive modeling in oncology.
METHODS: We propose a novel deep learning model that integrates convolutional 
and transformer-based components based on PET/CT data to support treatment 
decisions for esophageal cancer. The architecture introduces a Convolutional 
Feature Extractor with split-based residual blocks for efficient local feature 
capture, a Multi-scale Pooling module for spatial context aggregation, and an 
Multilayer Perceptron block for predicting. The model was evaluated using 
several performance metrics such as AUCROC, F1 score, Balanced Accuracy and 
benchmarked against state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer backbones 
such as ConvNeXt and Vision Transformer.
RESULTS: The proposed model achieved superior performance across all evaluation 
metrics, including an AUCROC of 0.9935 and a Balanced Accuracy of 0.9630, 
outperforming existing models. These results validate the effectiveness of 
combining local-global representation learning through custom-designed modules. 
In addition, we conducted ablation studies to further demonstrate the individual 
contributions and effectiveness of each component within the proposed 
architecture. By systematically removing or replacing specific modules such as 
the Convolutional Feature Extractor and Multi-scale Pooling, we observed 
consistent performance degradation, which highlights the necessity and 
complementary roles of these components in achieving optimal predictive 
accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that 
enhances treatment decision support for esophageal cancer by leveraging 
multi-scale spatial encoding. The empirical evidence demonstrates that tailored 
architectural innovations significantly improve predictive accuracy over 
existing methods.

BACKGROUND: Cervical dysplasia is preventable through screening methods and 
Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. Cervical cancer (CC) mortality is 
disproportionately higher in low-and-middle-income nations, which lack a 
population-based screening program. Health professionals should promptly counsel 
and educate females about cervical dysplasia prevention.
AIM: this work aimed to determine the level of knowledge, attitudes, and 
practices of female health professionals about cervical cell dysplasia. As well 
as addressing the potential barriers against routine cytological screening 
tests.
METHODS: A cross-sectional multicentric study at two tertiary hospitals; Tanta 
and Menoufia University Hospitals, recruited 1300 women (physicians, nurses, 
pharmacists, and dentists) via a multistage stratified random sampling 
technique. A self-administered questionnaire consisting of 4 sections was used 
to collect the relevant data.
RESULTS: Across all professions, 25% and 49.2% respectively had good knowledge 
levels and positive attitudes regarding cervical dysplasia. The majority had not 
been vaccinated against HPV nor undergone a Pap smear. Older age, urban 
residence, and positive family history were significant predictors of negative 
attitudes towards screening, p < 0.0001, beta 95%(CI) = -0.8 ( -0.1,-0.05), -0.9 
(-1.2,-0.6), -0.2 (-0.8,0.4)) respectively. The most encountered barriers 
opposing screening included lack of awareness about health facilities providing 
CC screening and the belief that there is no need so far, no complaints 
(72.6%,73%).
CONCLUSION: Female health professionals possessed acceptable knowledge and 
relatively positive attitudes regarding CC prevention, while their practices 
were discouraging. Believing that CC is a curse was the main culprit of 
refraining screening. It is pivotal to enhance accessibility to cervical 
screening services in various healthcare settings and boost the knowledge of

Malignant melanoma remains the most aggressive type of skin cancer, leading to a 
high rate of associated death over the past decade, often exhibiting resistance 
to conventional therapies and presenting significant challenges for preclinical 
testing. In this instance, the complexity of the progression and the interaction 
within the tumor microenvironment highlight the necessity for advanced models. 
Traditional 2D cultures and standard 3D systems, such as spheroids and 
organoids, fail to fully replicate native skin architecture and lack 
reproducibility, vascularization, and immune integration. Recent advances in 3D 
bioprinting have enabled the development of melanoma models that more accurately 
mimic human skin by incorporating multiple cell types, extracellular matrix 
components, and spatial control. These models support the evaluation of 
innovative therapies, including nanocarrier-based drug delivery systems and 
photodynamic therapy (PDT). This review discusses the evolution of in vitro 
melanoma modeling, highlighting the role of bioprinting technologies and bioink 
design within this setting, and investigates emerging applications in PDT and 
drug delivery systems, assessing the advances and current challenges in the 
context of melanoma.

BACKGROUND: Spatial transcriptomics have emerged as a powerful tool in 
biomedical research because of its ability to capture both the spatial contexts 
and abundance of the complete RNA transcript profile in organs of interest. 
However, limitations of the technology such as the relatively low resolution and 
comparatively insufficient sequencing depth make it difficult to reliably 
extract real biological signals from these data. To alleviate this challenge, we 
propose a novel transfer learning framework, referred to as TransST, to 
adaptively leverage the cell-labeled information from external sources in 
inferring cell-level heterogeneity of a target spatial transcriptomics data.
RESULTS: Applications in several real studies as well as a number of simulation 
settings show that our approach significantly improves existing techniques. For 
example, in the breast cancer study, TransST successfully identifies five 
biologically meaningful cell clusters, including the two subgroups of cancer in 
situ and invasive cancer; in addition, only TransST is able to separate the 
adipose tissues from the connective issues among all the studied methods.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the proposed method TransST is both effective and 
robust in identifying cell subclusters and detecting corresponding driving 
biomarkers in spatial transcriptomics data.

We report a case of semispecific myiasis in a cutaneous skull metastasis of 
cervical cancer. A 43-year-old woman developed larval infestation in an 
ulcerated occipital lesion. Fifty-two larvae were morphologically identified as 
Lucilia sericata. To control myiasis, we removed larvae by hand and applied 
petrolatum with topical zinc oxide starch powder. The ulcer surface improved, 
and no recurrence of myiasis was observed. Myiasis typically occurs in 
individuals with necrotic wounds, poor hygiene, or immunosuppression. This is 
the first report of myiasis occurring in a metastatic lesion of cervical cancer. 
We reviewed 36 cases of facultative myiasis in Japan since 2010, highlighting 
risk factors such as old age, dementia, malignancy, and solitary living. 
L. sericata was one of the most frequently identified species. Topical zinc 
oxide starch powder proved effective, offering a simple, noninvasive treatment 
option. This case expands the clinical spectrum of myiasis and suggests that 
zinc oxide starch powder may be useful in palliative wound care for advanced 
cancer patients.

Human papillomavirus (HPV)-independent oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma 
(OPSCC) is an aggressive cancer without established molecular prognosis. CDKN2A 
(encoding p16) deletion is a common genetic event in HPV-independent OPSCC. 
CDKN2A homozygous deletion is recognized as a poor prognostic factor in various 
tumors, such as gliomas, and methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) 
immunostaining serves as a surrogate marker for it. Because MTAP is related to 
the methionine salvage pathway, various cancer cell lines with MTAP deletion 
have been reported to exhibit increased sensitivity to the pyrimidine analog 
5-fluorouracil (5-FU). This study aimed to clarify the prognostic effect of the 
expressions and homozygous deletions of CDKN2A (p16) and MTAP in 177 patients 
with OPSCC (106 HPV-positive and 71 HPV-negative) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). MTAP loss by IHC was observed in 
25.3% (16/63) of HPV-negative/p16-negative OPSCCs, and FISH confirmed homozygous 
deletions of both CDKN2A and MTAP. All HPV-negative/p16-positive (n=8) and 
HPV-positive (n=106) OPSCCs did not exhibit MTAP deficiency. The prognosis of 
the HPV-negative/MTAP-loss group (n=16) was significantly better than that of 
the HPV-negative/MTAP-retained group (n=47) and was as favorable as that of the 
HPV-positive group (n=106). A similar trend was confirmed in patients with 
HPV-negative OPSCC who received pyrimidine-based chemotherapy (n=46). MTAP 
deficiency is closely associated with homozygous CDKN2A and MTAP deletions in 
HPV-negative/p16-negative OPSCCs. Furthermore, MTAP loss may be a favorable 
prognostic factor in HPV-negative OPSCC, and this paradoxical phenomenon might 
be explained by the enhanced efficacy of chemotherapy with pyrimidine analogs.

Single-cell sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of cervical cancer 
(CC), revealing unprecedented cellular heterogeneity, tumor microenvironment 
(TME) dynamics, and molecular mechanisms underlying progression and therapy 
resistance. These technologies have identified distinct molecular subtypes 
(hypoxic, proliferative, and immunoreactive) and epithelial states 
(cytokeratin⁺, immune-interacting, and senescent), while uncovering HPV-driven 
oncogenic mechanisms, including viral integration hotspots (e.g., 8q24.21) and 
immune evasion strategies (e.g., SPP1⁺ TAMs and GALNT3-mediated 
immunosuppression). Metabolic reprogramming further stratifies tumors into 
spatially organized Warburg effect and OXPHOS-dominant niches, each associated 
with unique immune infiltration patterns. The TME exhibits a complex interplay 
between exhausted PD-1⁺LAG3⁺TIM3⁺ T cells, immunosuppressive stromal cells 
(MYH9⁺ CAFs, PODXL⁺ ECs), and rare but potent effector populations (FGFBP2⁺ NK 
cells, CXCL13⁺ TRMs). Despite these advances, clinical translation faces 
challenges, including resistance mechanisms (NFKB1 mutations, BCL10⁺ Treg 
suppression) and a lack of inhibitors for key targets (PCLAF⁺ TAEpis, MYH9⁺ 
CAFs). Promising therapeutic strategies include epigenetic modulation (SALL4), 
sialylation inhibition (GALNT3/12), and immune-stromal co-targeting 
(PD-1 + LAG3/TIM3, NRG1-ERBB3 blockade). Future efforts must prioritize 
functional validation of novel targets (DKK2, ELF3), spatial multi-omics to 
resolve CAF-immune-metabolic crosstalk, and biomarker-driven clinical trials 
integrating single-cell classifiers. By bridging single-cell insights with 
mechanistic and translational studies, the field can overcome stromal-mediated 
resistance and usher in an era of precision immunotherapy for CC.

BACKGROUND: The prognostic role of lymphadenectomy during esophagectomy for 
esophageal cancer in complete responders to neoadjuvant therapy is uncertain. 
This study aimed to help clarify this question.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a bi-national population-based cohort study in 
Sweden (2006-2024) and Finland (2006-2019). The main cohort included 515 
patients with esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy after complete or 
near-complete tumor response without lymph node metastasis following neoadjuvant 
therapy. A secondary cohort included 669 patients with similar tumor response, 
regardless of nodal status. Data came from medical records and national health 
data registers. Associations between lymphadenectomy (categorized in quartiles) 
and 5-year mortality were assessed using multivariable Cox regression, yielding 
hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for age, sex, 
country, comorbidity, type of neoadjuvant therapy, calendar year, tumor 
histology, hospital volume, tumor location, tumor response, and T stage.
RESULTS: In the main cohort, comparing the highest quartile of lymphadenectomy 
(≥ 27 nodes) with the lowest (0-11 nodes) indicated decreased 5-year all-cause 
mortality (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34-0.88). Stratified analyses suggested no 
significant association for complete responders (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.39-1.16), but 
for near-complete responders (HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14-0.72). The associations 
disappeared when assessing stage purification bias in the secondary cohort (n = 
669), with the corresponding HRs of 0.91 (95% CI 0.63-1.32) for all responders, 
1.01 (95% CI 0.61-1.66) for complete responders, and 0.79 (95% CI 0.47-1.33) for 
near-complete responders. Results were similar for 5-year disease-specific 
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: After considering stage purification bias, more extensive 
lymphadenectomy did not improve the long-term survival among patients with 
complete or near-complete tumor response after neoadjuvant therapy.

BACKGROUND: Endometrial carcinoma (EC) molecular subtypes are critical for risk 
assessment and treatment guidance, with strong prognostic implications.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate associations between EC molecular subtypes and 
high-risk pathological factors to optimize individualized therapy.
DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 292 EC cases classified via the Proactive 
Molecular Risk Classifier for Endometrial Cancer (ProMisE) into four subtypes: 
POLE ultramutant (POLE-mut), mismatch repair deficient (MMRd), p53 abnormal (p53 
abn), and p53 wild-type (p53 wt). Associations with clinicopathological 
parameters were assessed using chi-square tests and logistic regression.
RESULTS: Among the 292 patients, the distribution of molecular subtypes was as 
follows: POLE-mut (6.8%), MMRd (21.2%), p53 abn (14.4%), and p53 wt (57.5%). 
Molecular subtypes correlated significantly with International Federation of 
Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (p < 0.001), poor/undifferentiated 
histology (p < 0.001), and lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) (p = 0.001). The 
POLE-mut and p53 wt were predominantly enriched in stage I disease (90.0% and 
80.4%, respectively). In contrast, the majority of p53 abn were classified as 
stage II (81.0%). The MMRd subtype was distributed across all stages. Advanced 
stages (III-IV) were most frequently observed in the p53 abn and MMRd subtypes. 
p53 abn showed the highest rate of poor/undifferentiated histology (61.9%). MMRd 
comprised the largest proportion of LVSI-positive cases (39.1%). Multivariate 
analysis identified MMRd as an independent predictor of LVSI (p = 0.001), while 
both MMRd (p = 0.009) and p53 abn (p < 0.001) independently predicted 
poor/undifferentiated histology.
CONCLUSIONS: EC molecular subtypes stratify clinicopathological risk and predict 
tumor behavior, highlighting their potential utility in informing individualized 
management. These findings suggest possible roles ranging from treatment 
de-escalation (POLE‑mut) to treatment intensification (p53‑abn), although 
further prospective studies are needed before routine clinical implementation.

Detection of tumor biomarkers is critical for early cancer diagnosis and cancer 
therapeutic monitoring, but traditional methods often lack sufficient 
sensitivity and specificity, especially at low biomarker concentrations. To 
address this challenge, in this study a multiplex detection platform based on 
core-shell quantum dot-encoded silica microspheres was developed for highly 
sensitive, simultaneous detection of multiple tumor biomarkers in a single 
assay. The core-shell silica architecture provides a high surface area for 
bioconjugation, while embedded quantum dots (QDs) offer strong fluorescence, 
making them ideal labels. Carbon quantum dots (CQDs), which have low toxicity, 
superior biocompatibility, and high photostability, were used as reporter 
molecules instead of organic dyes. This choice improved detection sensitivity 
and reduced the detection system's environmental toxicity relative to 
traditional dye-based assays. After optimizing QD-silica conjugation and 
immunoassay conditions, the platform achieved highly sensitive multiplex 
detection of four tumor biomarkers (AFP, CEA, CA125, CA19-9) commonly used in 
early cancer screening. Results demonstrated specific detection of all four 
targets within a short time frame, with excellent stability and reproducibility. 
By enhancing sensitivity for these biomarkers and reducing assay toxicity while 
improving stability, this platform shows significant potential to greatly 
improve early cancer screening and cancer therapeutic monitoring in clinical 
practice.

The advent of novel robotic platforms, like the hinotori™ Robotic Surgical 
System, introduced in our institution in 2024, has provided an alternative to 
the widely adopted da Vinci® Surgical System. Our study aims to investigate the 
initial outcomes and technical insights with using the hinotori™ for 
robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Consecutive patients undergoing 
RARP from October 2024 to April 2025 within a single institution were included. 
A retrospective analysis of baseline characteristics and perioperative data was 
performed. For this study, the primary endpoint was perioperative safety and 
feasibility, defined by console time and intraoperative complications. Secondary 
endpoints included estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, positive 
surgical margins, and total setup time trends. Technical insights and workflow 
considerations were qualitatively described. A total of 50 first initial and 
consecutive patients undergoing RARP using hinotori™ were analysed. The median 
age of patients was 69 (IQR: 65-72) years with a median PSA of 6.6 ng/mL (IQR 
5.5-8.1). Most patients had EAU intermediate risk prostate cancer (76%). Median 
setup time was 33 min (IQR 27-39) and median console time was 203.5 min (IQR 
185.8-232.0). Estimated blood loss was 150 mL and there were no cases requiring 
intra- or post-operative transfusion. Positive surgical margin rate was 12%. No 
Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ III occurred within 30-days. The 3-month continence rate 
was 82%. The docking-free design of hinotori™ confers a spacious extracorporeal 
working environment but requires careful setup of pivot points to avoid 
instrument friction, which may impact precision. To our knowledge, our 
institution represents the first centre outside Japan to adopt a complete 
platform switch from the da Vinci® system to the hinotori™ platform for RARP. 
Our initial experience suggests that the hinotori™ robotic surgical system is 
feasible and safe in the short-term perioperative setting. Key technical 
considerations and workflow adaptations identified in our early experience may 
serve as a practical reference for other institutions considering a transition 
from the da Vinci® system to hinotori™. Studies with longer follow-up and 
learning curves are warranted to further evaluate clinical outcomes and 
effectiveness.

Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have garnered significant interest for their 
safety and efficacy, especially following the success of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. 
This study presents the synthesis and characterization of a novel stearic acid 
(SA)-gambogic acid (GA) conjugate, where GA, a xanthonoid, exhibits high 
affinity for the transferrin receptor (TfR) without competing with endogenous 
transferrin. The SA-GA conjugate was employed to formulate SLNs using a hot 
homogenization-ultrasonication-solvent evaporation technique for the peroral 
delivery of cyclosporine (CsA), paclitaxel (PTX), and urolithin-A (UA). 
Physicochemical properties, including particle size, zeta potential, drug 
loading, and entrapment efficiency, were assessed. Among the three tested 
compounds, UA exhibited the highest encapsulation efficiency at both 5% and 10% 
w/w loading, with particle sizes remaining under 250 nm. SA-GA SLNs demonstrated 
excellent stability in simulated gastric fluids, supporting their potential for 
oral administration. Cellular uptake studies using Coumarin-6 (C6) and 
drug-loaded SLNs indicated that UA achieved the highest uptake (~ 50%) in both 
FHS-74 (human small intestine) and HK2 (human kidney) cell lines. Further, in 
cisplatin-induced HK2 cell damage models, UA-loaded SA-GA SLNs significantly 
reduced inflammatory markers TLR4, NF-κB, and IL-1β. These results highlight 
UA-loaded SA-GA SLNs as a promising TfR-targeted oral delivery system for 
mitigating cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) in cancer therapy.

Gefitinib is a first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor (TKI) used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). It is metabolized extensively in the liver by enzymes encoded by 
CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP3A5 and is the substrate of membrane transporters 
including ABCB1 and ABCG2. Evidence shows that single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) in these metabolizing and transporting genes contribute to the 
inter-individual variability in gefitinib response and development of 
gefitinib-induced adverse drug reactions (ADRs). This narrative review 
identifies the existing literature exploring the impact of SNPs on plasma 
gefitinib concentration and ADRs in patients with NSCLC receiving gefitinib 
therapy. SNPs were identified in drug-metabolizing enzyme coding genes, 
including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP3A5, and other CYP homologs, drug transporters 
including ABCB1, ABCG2, SLCO1B1 and other genes, including UGT1A7 and FOXO3. 
Current research has not identified any genetic association between specific 
SNPs in ABCB1, OATP1B1, and UGT1A7 and the pharmacokinetics of gefitinib. 
Additionally, most of these studies focused on individual SNP associations; 
however, it may be more important to consider them in combination to better 
understand their collective impact on gefitinib ADR. Hence, further 
comprehensive research is essential to examine these genetic variants across 
different ethnic groups, monitor the drug-drug interactions, and study the 
phenoconversion to draw definitive conclusions about the pharmacokinetics of 
gefitinib. This could lead to the development and implementation of a 
genotyping-based approach for gefitinib dosage optimization in clinical 
settings.

Existing methods to visualize dynamic changes in the three-dimensional genome, 
promoter-enhancer interactions and the influence of epigenetic modifications in 
non-repetitive loci are limited. Here we introduce CRISPR PRO-LiveFISH (Pooled 
gRNAs with Orthogonal bases LiveFISH), which combines orthogonal bases from 
expanded genetic alphabet technology and rational single guide RNA (sgRNA) 
design to efficiently label multiple non-repetitive loci in living cells. The 
optimized method allows simultaneous imaging of up to six genomic loci and uses 
as few as 10 sgRNAs for non-repetitive loci imaging without signal 
amplification. We demonstrate the method in diverse cell types, including 
primary cells, and apply it to reveal enhancer-promoter dynamics and a 
correlation between genomic dynamics and epigenetic states. We also show that 
PCDHα-enhancer interactions may persist despite spatial mobility and that BRD4 
maintains super-enhancer contacts regulating MYC oncogene expression in cancer 
cells. CRISPR PRO-LiveFISH can be applied to diverse studies of chromatin 
dynamics and genome organization in living cells.

Metastatic melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, accounts for the 
majority of skin cancer-related deaths. While targeted kinase inhibitors have 
improved outcomes for patients with BRAF-mutated melanomas, their efficacy is 
often short-lived, and effective treatments for other mutations, such as NRAS, 
remain scarce. To address this clinical need, we investigated the combination of 
the novel panRAF inhibitor, brimarafenib, and the MEK inhibitor, mirdametinib, 
both of which target the MAPK pathway downstream of NRAS. This study 
demonstrates the efficacy of this combination in NRAS-mutated melanoma and is 
currently also investigated in a phase I/IIa clinical study. In vitro, the 
brimarafenib and mirdametinib combination exhibited synergistic effects, 
significantly inhibiting the growth of patient-derived NRAS-mutated melanoma 
cell lines. A colony formation assay showed that this combination prevented the 
emergence of drug-resistant clones, suggesting a strong potential to reduce 
disease relapse. Transcriptional and proteomic analyses revealed that the 
observed growth inhibition was due to modulation of MAPK signaling and induction 
of apoptosis. In vivo studies further validated these findings, showing that the 
combination treatment inhibited tumor growth and significantly prolonged 
survival in mouse models bearing patient-derived NRAS-mutated melanoma tumors. 
Given the tolerability of this combination in vivo, our results suggest that 
brimarafenib and mirdametinib represent a promising therapeutic strategy for 
patients with NRAS-mutated melanomas and potentially other RAS-mutated solid 
tumors.

PURPOSE: With the dramatic increase in the number of people with cancer, it is 
necessary to optimize new interventions that promote a healthy lifestyle. This 
study aimed to explore medical experts' experiences and perspectives regarding 
the acceptability and feasibility of digital behavior change interventions for 
Iranian cancer survivors, as well as to identify their potential benefits and 
barriers.
METHODS: We employed a mixed-methods design to capture both the breadth and 
depth of clinical experts' perspectives on a digital lifestyle application for 
cancer survivors and to facilitate triangulation. In the quantitative phase, a 
standardized questionnaire was administered to 30 professionals, comprising both 
medical and psychology experts with extensive experience working with cancer 
survivors. To complement these findings, semi-structured interviews were 
conducted with a subset of 23 experts.
RESULTS: Quantitative analysis revealed that only a small proportion of 
participants had access to their patients outside of clinical visits. 
Nevertheless, participants broadly agreed on the feasibility of implementing 
digital behavior change interventions to support healthy lifestyle changes. 
Concerns were minimal, provided that such interventions deliver evidence-based 
information, integrate patient feedback, and maintain strict confidentiality. 
Complementary thematic analysis further highlighted digital interventions as 
promising tools for improving lifestyle behaviors among cancer survivors. 
Essential features for an effective intervention included user-friendliness, 
simple language, motivational and supportive design, trustworthiness, and 
cultural adaptability.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that digital behavior change interventions are 
generally acceptable to Iranian medical experts, provided that potential 
enablers are leveraged and barriers are addressed to maximize their use. 
Implications for cancer survivors This study highlights the potential of digital 
behavior change applications to support cancer survivors in adopting and 
maintaining healthier lifestyles, particularly in underrepresented settings such 
as Iran. It also provides insight into key features to improve its acceptance, 
beside addressing potential barriers.

Medicinal plants from India's industrialized Ambagarh Chowki district were 
analyzed for potentially toxic element (PTE) contamination to assess public 
health risks. Twenty-three species from 45 locations were examined using ICP-MS, 
revealing severe contamination from geological sources and anthropogenic 
activities, including coal-fired power plants and mining operations. Soil 
arsenic averaged 77.2 mg kg-1 (15-fold above background), with the Nemerow 
Pollution Index (11.72) indicating heavy pollution. The sum of PTE 
concentrations varied by species and organ: 10.4-58.9 mg kg-1 (bark), 20.0-144.1 
mg kg-1 (leaves), 8.8-74.4 mg kg-1 (mesocarps), and 11.2-113.7 mg kg-1 (seeds). 
Critical contamination included Moringa oleifera bark (37.6 mg kg-1 Pb), Careya 
arborea leaves (8.54 mg kg-1 As), and multiple species exceeding international 
safety limits. Probabilistic health risk assessment using Monte Carlo simulation 
(10,000 iterations) revealed that 6.2-19.4% of exposure scenarios exceeded 
safety thresholds depending on plant part and population group, with children 
showing 1.6-fold higher risk than adults. At the 95th percentile, the cancer 
risk for children reached 1.19 × 10-3, a value approximately 12 times higher 
than the acceptable level. Furthermore, between 79 and 91% of the exposure 
scenarios exceeded the cancer risk thresholds. Sensitivity analysis identified 
consumption rate as the primary modifiable risk factor. Factor analysis revealed 
contamination sources: continental crust minerals (41.15% variance), soil parent 
material (20.09%), and agricultural/industrial activities (12.72%). These 
findings indicate that traditional medicine practices using locally harvested 
plants from contaminated areas present elevated health risks that warrant 
careful evaluation and risk management strategies.

PURPOSE: Several benefits exist when supportive therapies (exercise, art, 
mind-body practices, support groups, etc.) are incorporated into care for those 
with cancer. Research assessing real-world disparities among support service 
utilization is limited, especially as virtual options have increased. We aimed 
to identify changes in participant demographics and resource utilization at a 
community-based cancer support organization as program delivery shifted from all 
in-person to virtual and hybrid platforms.
METHODS: Deidentified, retrospective data was gathered from three 6-month time 
periods, corresponding to in-person, virtual, and hybrid program delivery. 
Participant demographics, cancer diagnoses, and types of programs attended were 
collected. Comparisons between individual variables were performed in relation 
to the distinct 6-month time periods. The Wilcoxon test was used for age, and 
chi-square tests were used for all other variables. Statistical significance was 
set at two-sided p-values < 0.05.
RESULTS: Participants of female gender, white race, and above-average household 
income defined the majority and did not change based on delivery platform. 
However, participants utilizing services in the virtual/hybrid setting were 
significantly younger with fewer breast cancer diagnoses compared to in-person 
delivery. Engagement in support, exercise, art, and mind/body programs 
significantly decreased while educational participation significantly increased 
from in-person to virtual/hybrid settings.
CONCLUSIONS: Participation was highly skewed toward female, white, and 
higher-income individuals. Younger participant age in the virtual setting 
mirrors the age-related disparity among telemedicine utilization. While virtual 
participation led to decreased engagement in programs emphasizing camaraderie 
and social bonding, participation in programs encompassing more passive 
engagement remained steady or rose. This study identifies important gaps in 
support service utilization and underscores the importance of in-person 
interaction.

Breast tumor kinase (Brk) is an intracellular kinase that initiates a downstream 
oncogenic signaling through phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and 
signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Demethylmycemycin A 
(DA) was isolated from a sponge-derived Dactylosporangium sp. OK1079. Though 
known as a microbial dibenzoxazepinone, its biological activity has never been 
investigated. Previous studies on the marine triterpene sipholenol A identified 
its perhydrobenzoxepine system as the key pharmacophore that mediated its Brk 
binding. The bioisosteric similarity of DA to the sipholenol A 
perhydrobenzoxepine motivated a molecular docking simulation of DA for potential 
Brk binding. The antiproliferative effect of DA was investigated against diverse 
prostate cancer (PC) cell lines including LNCaP (castration/hormone-sensitive 
primary adenocarcinoma), PC3, and 22Rv1 (castration-resistant), in addition to 
the androgen-independent DU145 cells. LNCaP cells were the most sensitive to the 
effects of DA, followed by PC3, showing IC50 values of 7.6 and 9.8 μM, 
respectively. DA treatments significantly reduced the migration and 
clonogenicity of the LNCaP cells. Western blot analysis indicated the ability of 
DA to reduce the expression levels of activated Brk, FAK and STAT3 in a 
dose-dependent manner in both cell lines. DA also decreased the expression 
levels of the total FAK but didn't affect the total level of Brk while the 
expression level of total STAT3 was only suppressed in LNCaP cells. These 
results highlight the PC proliferation and migration suppressive effects of DA 
through targeting Brk-FAK-STAT3 axis. DA is a potential prototype hit that can 
be developed particularly for Brk-expressing PC control.

The molecular and functional changes in endothelial cells during disease 
progression such as cancer have been noted but the mechanism of their activation 
is still under-studied. Previously we discovered that tumor-derived Oncostatin M 
induced tumor-associated vascular phenotypes, and the activated endothelial 
cells in turn promoted tumor progression and metastasis of clear-cell renal cell 
carcinoma (ccRCC). However, the mechanism of Oncostatin M action remains 
unknown. Here, we reveal that Oncostatin M signaling triggers specific 
epigenetic reprogramming of endothelial cells through upregulation of lysine 
acetyltransferase 6B, leading to increased histone 3 lysine 14 acetylation 
(H3K14ac) in vitro and in vivo. H3K14ac-modified chromatins upregulate specific 
gene sets associated with hypoxic response, hyper-angiogenesis, inflammation, 
and mesenchymal transition. Targeting H3K14ac in endothelial cells by 
interfering with acetyltransferase 6B function or neutralizing Oncostatin M 
ameliorates the premalignant hyperplastic phenotypes in the autochthonous ccRCC 
mouse model and diminishes tumor growth and metastasis in the ccRCC xenograft 
model.

The nucleic acid metabolism process is driven by various carcinogenic factors, 
providing a material basis and energy guarantee for the malignant phenotype of 
tumor cells. However, the role of nucleic acid metabolism in triple-negative 
breast cancer (TNBC) development remains unclear. Here, we examined the 
expression patterns of nucleic acid metabolism-related genes (NAMRGs) in the 
transcriptome of 297 TNBC samples derived from three datasets. We used 
single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and both in vivo and in vitro experiments to 
verify the correlation between NAMRGs and tumor metastasis and tumor immune 
matrix microenvironment (TME) characteristics. According to the results, two 
different molecular subtypes were identified, and the relationships between the 
molecular subtypes, four genetic subtypes, and four pathological subtypes were 
established. Changes in nucleic acid metabolism were related to changes in 
homologous recombination repair defects (HRD), cell infiltration in the TME, and 
patient prognosis. We also constructed a prediction model, NAM_model, by 
including four NAMRGs (DPYD, PDE6G, PDE8B, and TYMS) and integrating it with 
other clinical indicators. This model was a highly accurate prognostic nomogram, 
which showed that the prognosis of high-risk patients was poor, with NAMRGs 
associated with TME immune exhaustion. In addition, NAMRGs were significantly 
correlated with drug sensitivity to chemotherapy and targeted therapy. In vivo 
and in vitro studies have shown that PDE8B is an oncogene that promotes tumor 
growth and induces TNBC metastasis by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT), which has not been reported previously. Single-cell RNA 
sequencing also revealed the unique effects of nucleic acid metabolism and HRD 
on exhausted CD8+ T cells. A comprehensive analysis of NAMRGs revealed the 
potential impact of nucleic acid metabolism-mediated mechanisms, such as HRD and 
EMT, on the clinical pathological characteristics, TME characteristics, and 
prognosis of patients with TNBC. These findings have deepened our understanding 
of the roles of NAMRGs in TNBC and immunotherapy, which will greatly contribute 
to patient stratification management and individualized clinical 
decision-making.

BACKGROUND: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is an effective treatment for 
superficial esophageal cancer, but postoperative stenosis remains a considerable 
concern. Particularly, the probability of stenosis is less investigated in 
patients with a 50-75% circumferential mucosal defect. We identified the risk 
factors of postoperative stenosis after moderate circumferential defect 
resection in esophageal ESD.
METHODS: This multicenter retrospective observational study analyzed data from 
513 patients with 50-75% circumferential mucosal defect after esophageal ESD 
across 19 institutions from April 2018 to March 2022. The risk factors for 
postoperative esophageal stenosis, including steroid use, were investigated.
RESULTS: Postoperative stenosis was observed in 28 cases (5%). Multivariate 
analyses identified prior endoscopic treatment close to the lesion (odds ratio 
[OR], 5.10), cervical esophageal lesion (OR, 3.97), large circumferential defect 
(OR, 3.78), and longer procedural duration (OR, 3.83) as the independent risk 
factors for stenosis formation. In the sensitivity analysis using 
ridge-penalized logistic regression, only circumferential defect > 5/8 (OR, 
3.30; 95% CI 1.56-7.66) and procedure time > 120 min (OR, 3.61; 95% CI 
1.39-8.25) remained robust predictors; cervical location and prior endoscopic 
treatment were shrunk toward the null. Particularly, patients with a prior 
endoscopic treatment, a cervical esophageal lesion, and more than 5/8 of 
circumferential defect were likely to have stenosis postoperatively despite 
steroid use.
CONCLUSION: In patients with a 50-75% circumferential mucosal defect after 
esophageal ESD, steroids were used in > 40% of the patients, with 5% of the 
patients developing postoperative stenosis. Larger circumferential mucosal 
defect and longer procedural duration were considered as the most relevant risk 
factors. Stricture prevention should be more aggressively considered in cases at 
high-risk for stenosis, even though the mucosal defect area was less than 
three-fourth of the circumference.

BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic surgery is the standard of care for many colon cancer 
procedures but in patients with high BMI, extensive adhesions, or significant 
comorbidities, the conventional approach can be technically challenging. The 
retroperitoneal approach (BRIDGE-technique)* which provides direct access to the 
retroperitoneal space offers an alternative that enables early vascular control 
and lymph node dissection without entering the abdominal cavity.
METHODS: We demonstrate two different techniques for port placement in the 
retroperitoneal approach for right side colon cancer. Three separate trocar 
placements and Single-port access. A three-trocar approach was used in a patient 
with prior laparotomy and extensive adhesions. It allowed early identification 
and control of vascular structures, safe D3 lymph node dissection, and minimized 
the need for adhesiolysis. The second patient presented with an unusual vascular 
anatomy. She was operated on using single-port technique. Precise interfascial 
dissection enabled exposure of the duodenum, pancreas, and major mesenteric 
vessels, including the ileocolic and middle colic arteries and veins.
RESULTS: This detailed procedural demonstration of both surgical techniques was 
illustrated by a video and accompanied by a case series of five patients. The 
procedures were successfully completed in all patients (BMI range 
18.5-32.8 kg/m2). Operative times ranged from 185 to 315 min, and blood loss was 
minimal (50-100 mL) across all cases. No intraoperative or postoperative 
complications were observed confirming the safety and feasibility of both 
techniques.
CONCLUSION: Retroperitoneal access by either the single-port or three-trocar 
technique, can be implemented for vascular control and lymph node dissection in 
complex right colon cancer cases. *BRIDGE-technique: Begin with Retroperitoneal 
dissection, then Intraabdominal Dissection with laparoscopy for Gastrointestinal 
Excision.

BACKGROUND: Esophageal reconstruction after total or proximal gastrectomy is 
technically demanding. Robotic platforms provide enhanced dexterity, yet 
anastomotic protocols vary widely. We developed a unified, geometry-driven 
robotic technique-applicable to both total and proximal gastrectomy-that creates 
a wide V-shaped anastomosis by extending and rotating a right-anterior 
esophageal flap to maximize perfusion and minimize axial tension.
METHODS: Between March 2021 and May 2025, 41 patients underwent robotic 
gastrectomy using our ""diagonal V-geometry"" reconstruction: 18 proximal 
gastrectomies with esophagogastrostomy and 23 total gastrectomies with 
esophagojejunostomy. A multi-arm surgical robot with 3D visualization and 
articulating instruments was used. The muscularis was divided directly; the 
mucosa was incised over a nasogastric tube to avoid contralateral injury. 
Traction sutures rotated the flap posteriorly, widening the staple line 
interface. A powered linear stapler created a 40-45-mm V-shaped anastomosis to 
either the gastric remnant or Roux limb. The enterotomy was closed with a 60-mm 
staple line. In proximal gastrectomy, a partial Toupet fundoplication was added. 
Leak tests confirmed integrity. Barbed sutures secured fixation.
RESULTS: Median age was 73 years (proximal) and 77 years (total); median BMI was 
21.6 and 21.2 kg/m2. D2 lymphadenectomy was performed in most patients (88.9% in 
PG; 100% in TG). Median operative time was 428 min (proximal) and 400 min 
(total). Blood loss was minimal (median 0 mL). One non-anastomotic complication 
occurred (5.6%) in the proximal group; none in the total group. Critically, no 
anastomotic leaks, strictures, or reoperations occurred. Imaging confirmed wide 
lumens; patients resumed oral intake without dysphagia. Three-month follow-up 
showed no reflux.
CONCLUSIONS: Our unified robotic diagonal V-geometry technique yielded zero 
leaks or strictures in 41 gastrectomies. By rotating the right-anterior flap to 
create a broad V-shaped staple line, perfusion is preserved and tension 
minimized. Larger multicenter studies are needed to confirm these promising 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Abnormal PSA test results leading to MRI scans is mainstream 
practice in prostate cancer diagnosis. However, a similar algorithm may lead to 
under-detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in disease 
screening. We compare cancer detection rates (CDR) in screening with MRI 
prostate only ('primary' MRI) compared to MRI scans triggered by abnormal serum 
PSA levels ('PSA-gated' MRI).
METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, CENTRAL, Scopus and Google Scholar were 
searched using key terms of ""MRI"", ""prostate cancer"", and ""screening"" from 
01/1/2000-20/4/2024. We included studies investigating the general adult male 
population not otherwise risk stratified, and extracted outcomes of CDR for 
csPCa (ISUP Grade Group ≥ 2) and clinically insignificant prostate cancer 
(ciPCa) (ISUP Grade Group 1), and biopsy rate.
RESULTS: 17 studies were included for final analysis. When including all 
studies, primary MRI had a higher CDR compared to PSA-gated MRI for all prostate 
cancer (8.49% vs. 1.88%, p = 0.0223) and csPCa (5.93% vs. 1.15%, p = 0.0180) 
detection respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in CDR 
for ciPCa between both groups. In studies directly comparing primary and 
PSA-gated MRI, primary MRI demonstrated higher odds of detection for all 
prostate cancer (OR 2.77, 95%CI: 1.71-4.49), csPCa (OR 2.32, 95%CI: 1.37-3.96) 
and ciPCa (OR 3.11, 95%CI: 1.08-8.97). Limitations include verification bias and 
heterogeneity between studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary MRI screening demonstrated higher CDR for csPCa than 
PSA-gated MRI screening triggered at PSA thresholds of 3-4 ng/ml. There is also 
higher CDR of ciPCa and adoption of needle biopsies. More granular 
cost-effectiveness outcomes are required before mainstream implementation is 
possible.

Measures of healthcare quality and equity often overlook when care is delivered, 
potentially masking important disparities. We present a novel, time-aware 
approach to detect racial inequities in hospice use among 100,480 Medicare 
beneficiaries with advanced cancer. Tracking hospice initiation over the final 
200 days of life, we introduce a daily ""difference signal"" that shows how 
utilization patterns change over time. Using a Bayesian framework to quantify 
uncertainty and applying clinically meaningful thresholds, we pinpoint when 
disparities arise and how large they are. Compared to a conventional, 
time-agnostic benchmark, our approach reveals substantial day-level disparities 
that aggregate measures can miss. Notably, while overall measures often show 
greater hospice access for white patients, our temporal analysis frequently 
found earlier hospice use by patients of color, demonstrating how timing can 
reverse apparent patterns. By identifying when disparities emerge, our method 
offers more actionable targets for interventions and future digital health 
equity efforts.

PURPOSE: The combination of lazertinib and amivantamab has shown superior 
efficacy over first line osimertinib in EGFR-mutated metastatic non-small cell 
lung cancer, but is associated with significant toxicity and high costs. 
Lazertinib exposure varies widely due to genetic polymorphisms of the encoding 
for GSTM1, with almost 50% of Caucasians having a non-functional enzyme 
resulting in an approximate twofold higher systemic drug exposure. Despite this, 
all patients receive a fixed 240 mg once-daily dose irrespective of GSTM1 
status, leading to avoidable toxicity without additional clinical benefit. Our 
purpose was to develop alternative dosing regimens based on GSTM1 status.
METHODS: We conducted pharmacokinetic simulations using an existing validated 
population pharmacokinetic model to evaluate genotype-guided alternative dosing 
strategies in GSTM1 null individuals.
RESULTS: Two regimens- 160 mg once daily (QD) and 240 mg every other day-were 
predicted to provide systemic exposures comparable to or exceeding those seen in 
GSTM1 non-null patients on the standard dose. The 160 mg QD dose resulted in a 
geometric mean ratio in GSTM1 null patients (GMR) for the trough (Ctrough) and 
average (Caverage) concentration relative tot he approved dose in GSTM1 non-null 
patients of 1.43 and 1.19, respectively. The respective GMRs for Ctrough and 
Caverage associated with 240 mg every-other-day dosing were 0.90 and 0.89, and 
this dosing regimen could reduce drug expenses up to 50% ($132.860 per year per 
patient) based on current pricing.
CONCLUSION: Our findings support the feasibility of individualized lazertinib 
dosing based on GSTM1 status to reduce toxicity and healthcare costs without 
compromising effective exposure.

Ovarian cancer represents one of the most prevalent gynecological malignancies 
with a poor prognosis. Targeting glycolytic pathways has emerged as a novel 
cancer therapeutic strategy. N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10)-mediated 
N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) modification plays a regulatory role in cancer 
glycolysis. Phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) functions as a critical glycolytic 
enzyme and potential therapeutic target in oncology. This study investigated the 
functional role and underlying mechanisms of NAT10 in ovarian cancer 
progression. Cellular glycolysis was assessed through glucose uptake 
measurements, lactate production quantification, and extracellular acidification 
rate analysis. Cell stemness characteristics were evaluated using sphere 
formation assays and western blot analysis. Molecular mechanisms were explored 
via quantitative real-time PCR, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), ac4C-specific 
RIP, dot blot analysis, and dual-luciferase reporter assays. Elevated NAT10 
expression and ac4C modification levels were observed in ovarian cancer cells. 
NAT10 silencing significantly inhibited both cell stemness properties and 
glycolytic activity. Mechanistically, NAT10 enhanced PGAM1 mRNA stability 
through ac4C modification. Re-expression of PGAM1 reversed the functional 
effects induced by NAT10 depletion in ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, in vivo 
tumor growth experiments demonstrated that NAT10 promotes tumorigenesis. Our 
findings demonstrate that NAT10 facilitates ovarian cancer progression by 
mediating ac4C modification of PGAM1. This study identifies a novel and 
potentially effective therapeutic target for ovarian cancer treatment.

Translational research in metastatic cancer is limited by insufficient 
metastatic samples. Post-mortem tissue donation programs address this issue by 
facilitating comprehensive sample collection. Sustaining such programs requires 
an open science environment (OSE) to ensure multidisciplinary collaboration, 
research standards, and patient privacy. While often seen at publication, we 
demonstrate the benefit of developing upstream phases by presenting the OSE from 
our institutional post-mortem tissue donation program UPTIDER (NCT04531696). It 
contains (i) an electronic case report form to capture >750 clinical features 
including treatment lines and metastases, (ii) a lab information management 
system to track >100 metadata features from logistical to anatomical 
information, (iii) a code versioning system, (iv) long-term data and sample 
storage, and (v) code and data sharing upon publication. By ensuring latest 
access to information, our OSE reflects the potential to accelerate 
translational research. While our OSE was tailored for UPTIDER, we believe our 
experiences can inspire others.

Pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, is a common gastrointestinal 
condition. While often acute and self-resolving, it can become chronic and 
promote pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the third deadliest cancer 
worldwide. Pancreatitis is accompanied by morphological and molecular changes, 
notably immune cell infiltration, fibrosis, and acinar-to-ductal metaplasia 
(ADM). ELP3, the catalytic subunit of the Elongator complex, modifies wobble 
uridine tRNAs to optimize codon translation rates. It is critical to 
inflammatory processes and cancer in multiple organ systems, yet its role in the 
pancreas has not been investigated. This study aimed to investigate the 
expression and implication of ELP3 during pancreatitis induced in mice via 
repetitive caerulein injections. Acute pancreatitis was accompanied by increased 
expression of ELP3, which was mainly detected in pancreatic epithelial cells. To 
assess its function, we genetically inactivated Elp3 in pancreatic epithelial 
cells. Elp3 deficiency had no detectable effects on pancreas homeostasis, on the 
initiation and resolution of acute pancreatitis, on the development of chronic 
pancreatitis, or on pancreatitis-induced PDAC initiation. Our findings indicate 
that ELP3 is dispensable in pancreatic formation, inflammation and PDAC 
initiation. Future studies should explore its role in non-epithelial cells and 
its potential involvement in other PDAC hallmarks, such as therapy resistance.

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are essential for post-transcriptional gene 
regulation, including for RNA modification such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 
splicing, polyadenylation, localization, translation and decay. Dysregulation of 
RBPs has been causally linked to a wide array of human diseases, including 
cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic disorders and tissue 
differentiation abnormalities. Although RBPs have traditionally been studied 
through their RNA, protein and post-translational interactions, growing evidence 
shows that small biomolecules (SBMs) such as sugars, nucleotides, metabolites 
such as S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and NAD(P)H, and drugs can directly bind RBPs 
and modulate their structure, localization and RNA-binding activity. These 
context-dependent and concentration-dependent interactions link RBP regulation 
to cellular metabolism and are a key focus of current research. In this Review, 
we discuss the expanding landscape of SBM-binding RBPs and the functions of 
these RBPs in condensate formation, RNA localization, processing and 
translation. We highlight the molecular principles that underlie these 
interactions and their functional relevance to human diseases. We also examine 
recent advances in the identification of SBM-RBP interactions and the innovative 
methodologies that are driving discoveries in this rapidly advancing field. 
Together, these insights underscore the potential of SBMs to modulate RBPs and 
inform novel therapeutic strategies.

The digital stress-management intervention StressProffen has been shown to be 
associated with improved well-being and quality of life for cancer survivors. In 
the Coping After Breast Cancer (CABC) trial, effects of 6 months' access to 
modified versions of StressProffen, delivered through a digital download-only 
model, were examined. Women with breast cancer were invited to participate in 
the trial 6-9 months following diagnosis. Eligible participants were randomized 
to either: (1) digital cognitive behavioral therapy stress-management 
intervention (CBI), n = 140, (2) digital mindfulness-based stress-management 
intervention (MBI), n = 143, or (3) usual-care (control group), n = 147. Primary 
outcome was change in perceived stress level (PSS-10), while secondary outcomes 
included changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), anxiety and 
depression, fatigue, mindfulness, sleep and coping. Perceived stress level at 
baseline was low for all groups. No statistically significant mean differences 
(MD) were detected between either of the intervention groups and the control 
group from baseline to 6-month follow-up for perceived stress level (MBI: MD 
-0.28 [95%CI: -1.75, 1.19], CBI: MD -0.42 [95%CI: -1.89, 1.06]), nor for the 
majority of the secondary outcomes. After 6 months of access, the CBI and MBI 
stress-management interventions did not yield significantly improved outcomes 
for women with breast cancer compared with usual-care controls. Further 
explorations of which interventions and delivery models may optimize use and 
effect, best timing for delivery, and individual preferences are needed.

BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence on the optimal frequency of mammogram 
surveillance. At 5-year follow-up, the Mammo-50 trial found that, in patients 
aged 50+ and 3 years post diagnosis, less frequent mammograms were non-inferior 
to annual mammograms for breast-cancer-specific-survival, recurrence-free 
interval and overall survival.
METHODS: A within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis compared annual versus less 
frequent mammogram surveillance over 5 years from healthcare and societal 
perspectives. Hospital Episodes Statistics captured hospital-based resource use. 
Health-related quality of life and other cost data were obtained via 
questionnaires at surveillance mammograms. A budget impact analysis estimated 
NHS savings.
RESULTS: Less frequent surveillance led to cost savings of -£543.88 (-£1116; 
£26) and a small reduction in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of -0.02 
(-0.095; 0.06) per patient. The incremental net monetary benefit at a 
£20,000/QALY threshold was £187 (-£1574; £2027). Including societal costs 
increased savings to £1543 per person (-£2416; -£669), and cost-effectiveness. 
Projected NHS savings were £185.87 million over 6 years.
CONCLUSION: Less frequent mammogram surveillance is cost-effective. Uncertainty 
remains due to variability in costs and quality of life estimates, and missing 
data in the less frequent arm due to study design. Given the trial's 
non-inferiority findings, this strategy is recommended from healthcare and 
societal perspectives.

Bladder cancer (BLCA) exhibits considerable heterogeneity, and research into its 
tumor microenvironment and prognostic biomarkers remains insufficient. This 
study aims to identify key prognostic genes and immune microenvironment factors 
to enhance clinical assessment. Primary tumor (PT) and lymph node metastasis 
(LNM) samples were obtained from patients with BLCA, and single-cell RNA 
sequencing (scRNA-seq) was conducted to analyze cellular composition and 
functional variations. Prognostic genes were identified based on integrated bulk 
transcriptomic data, leading to the development of a risk model. Functional 
enrichment analyses further elucidated the molecular characteristics of high- 
and low-risk cohorts. The scRNA-seq analysis revealed significantly elevated 
metabolic activity in epithelial cells of LNM. A subpopulation of epithelial 
cells, defined by 133 characteristic genes, was identified as pivotal in the 
lymphatic metastasis of BLCA. The prognostic model, derived from nine key genes 
(APOL1, CAST, DSTN, SPINK1, JUN, S100A10, SPTBN1, HES1, and CD2AP), demonstrated 
robust predictive performance. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the 
high-risk group predominantly activated extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor 
interactions and the complement pathway, while the low-risk group was primarily 
associated with carbohydrate metabolism pathways. This study provides insights

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by poor prognosis and 
limited targeted treatment options. Efferocytosis, an essential immune mechanism 
for the clearance of apoptotic cells, is increasingly recognized as a key 
contributor to tumor immune evasion. This study aimed to identify key 
efferocytosis-related genes in TNBC, investigate their impact on the tumor 
microenvironment and immunotherapy responses, and construct a prognostic model 
to inform and optimize treatment strategies. RNA sequencing data and clinical 
information for patients with TNBC were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
and the Gene Expression Omnibus databases. Machine learning models were employed 
to derive efferocytosis-related signatures to predict clinical outcomes and 
immunotherapy responses. Eight efferocytosis-related genes were identified, 
considered efferocytosis-related gene signatures herein: P2RX1, IFNG, IL1A, 
CD93, XKR8, SIAH2, F2RL1, and TLR4. Using the individual risk scores derived 
from this model, patients were stratified into high- and low-risk groups, 
revealing significant differences in immune infiltration and immuno-therapy 
response. Our study highlights the predictive significance of efferocytosis in 
assessing chemotherapy sensitivity, emphasizing the pivotal role of the immune 
microenvironment in mediating drug resistance. Moreover, we identified potential 
targets for immunotherapeutic strategies in the treatment of TNBC.

In this study, calcined bone char was produced from waste bones and 
characterized by SEM-EDX and BET surface area analysis. The adsorption 
properties of tamoxifen, a cytotoxic cancer drug, by calcined bone char were 
investigated in batch experiments and the effects of adsorbent dose, pH, contact 
time, temperature, and initial concentration were evaluated. Calcined bone char 
exhibits a monolayer adsorption capacity of 98.30 mg/g for tamoxifen was 
achieved at an initial concentration of 40 mg/L, an adsorbent dose of 20 mg/50 
mL, a temperature of 25 °C, and a pH of 7. The Langmuir model (R²: 0.9900) 
provided the best fit to the isothermal adsorption data and supported monolayer, 
homogeneous surface adsorption. The pseudo-second-order-kinetic model (R²: 
0.9997) best described the adsorption kinetics, indicating that chemisorption 
was the dominant mechanism. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that the adsorption 
process was spontaneous, endothermic, and entropy-driven. These findings 
demonstrate that calcined bone char is a sustainable and effective adsorbent for 
the removal of pharmaceutical contaminants from aqueous solutions.

The modulation of DNA replication dynamics has emerged as a key area of study in 
understanding genome stability and its perturbations in various physiological 
and pathological contexts. Replication fork rate is influenced by a variety of 
factors, including DNA repair pathways, origin firing, chromatin organization, 
transcription, and oncogenic signaling. This review highlights recent findings 
on the molecular mechanisms driving replication fork acceleration, focusing on 
scenarios such as PARP inhibition, oncogene activation, depletion of replication 
factors, and defects in Okazaki fragment processing. We discuss how reduced 
origin firing, R-loop resolution, and metabolic changes contribute to fork rate 
modulation, as well as the involvement of innate immune signaling, particularly 
through pathways such as cGAS-STING and ISG15. Special attention is given to 
consequences of accelerated replication forks for genome stability and their 
role in disease progression, particularly cancer. By unraveling the molecular 
mechanisms of fork acceleration, this Mini Review underscores its critical role 
in shaping genome integrity and cellular homeostasis, providing insights into 
future research directions and therapeutic strategies.

One of the most common and extensively disseminated endocrine disrupting 
chemicals (EDCs) is perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA), which is used 
extensively in food packaging and has been linked to the development of 
metabolic disorders. Human health and food safety are intimately intertwined. 
Thus, as exemplary hepatic metabolic diseases, we selected liver cancer and 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). By employing advanced network 
toxicology and molecular docking techniques, we have discovered potential 
molecular pathways underlying these two diseases. We pinpointed the potential 
targets associated with the disease by leveraging databases including PubChem, 
ADEMTlab3.0, Swiss Target Prediction, OMIM, and GeneCards. To identify the 
primary targets that were most closely connected to these metabolic disorders, 
we also used Cytoscape software and STRING analysis. Furthermore, the David 
database's Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
pathways were used to perform enrichment analysis of these key targets. Lastly, 
we used AutoDock Vina molecular docking to confirm PFTrDA's binding affinity to 
these target proteins. Our results imply that PFTrDA may regulate fatty acid 
metabolism and impact signal transduction pathways, which may lead to the onset 
of metabolic disorders. It's interesting that we also discovered links between 
liver cancer and NAFLD. In summary, this study offers a theoretical foundation 
for comprehending the molecular mechanisms behind PFTrDA toxicity and lays forth 
a basic theoretical framework for the creation of therapeutic and preventative 
approaches for hepatic metabolic disorders linked to PFTrDA.

Red beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) are gaining recognition for their potential in 
functional foods and nutraceuticals. This study isolated bioactive peptides 
under 3 kDa from red bean protein hydrolysate, generated by pepsin digestion and 
purified using sequential cation exchange, anion exchange, and reverse-phase 
chromatography. The resulting hydrolysate exhibited anticancer activity. 
Following chromatographic fractionation and LC-MS sequencing, eight candidate 
peptides were synthesized and comparatively assessed for bioactivity. 
Remarkably, peptide RB-8 (LIIPATSTKFL) demonstrated significant anticancer 
activity against colorectal (CaCO2) and cervical (SiHa) cancer cells through 
distinct mechanistic pathways. Furthermore, RB-7 (RGSKQRQKRQW) showed potent 
antihypertensive and DPPH radical scavenging activities, RB-6 (RRLRILL) 
displayed the strongest ABTS radical scavenging activity, and RB-1 (NLRKLKRL) 
exhibited the highest FRAP. These findings highlight the potential of red 
bean-derived peptides as natural agents for managing non-communicable diseases 
(NCDs) and their applicability in the food industry.

This study evaluates the efficacy of phytotherapy in treating oral cancer. This 
study evaluated the phytocompounds extracted from Cadaba fruticosa for 
anticancer potential using GC-MS analysis. A total of 10 bioactive 
phytocompounds were identified, of which 3,5-dichloro benzyl propyl ester 
emerged as a highly potent candidate. A pharmacokinetic analysis was performed 
using SwissADME, and the selected compound did not adhere to Lipinski's rule of 
five, indicating no toxicity. A network pharmacology and molecular docking study 
was conducted to investigate the interaction between these compounds and the 
target proteins of oral cancer. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) database provided 10 hub genes associated with critical pathways: EGFR, 
MAPK3, PPARG, MTOR, KRAS, MDM2, ERBB2, IRS1, HRAS, and JAK2. Molecular docking 
studies confirmed strong binding interactions between 3,5-dichlorobenzyl propyl 
ester and the oral cancer protein SMAD, which had binding energy of 
-7.9 kcal/mol and interactions with the amino acids TYR280 (2.89 Å), ARG285 
(3.04 Å), THR413 (3.21 Å), ARG415 (2.98 Å) and SER276 (2.09 Å), TYR280 (3.74 Å), 
THR289 (4.09 Å), ARG285 (4.31 Å), ARG415 (3.63 Å), ARG410 (3.54 Å), HIS441 (5.07 
Å), PRO360 (4.45 Å), ARG410 (4.46 Å), ARG410 (4.93 Å) and ALA278 (4.34 Å). A 
molecular dynamics simulation was performed over 200 ns and showed the complex 
stable, with RMSD values ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 nm. Apoptotic gene expression 
analysis of KB-1 oral cancer cell lines showed downregulation of Bcl-2 and 
upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes BAD, BAX, and caspase-3 at an IC50 of 
38.60 µg/ml. In a density functional theory (DFT) analysis, 3,5-dichloro benzyl 
propyl ester was found to have HOMO and LUMO energy levels ranging from - 0.8100 
to 0.2701, highlighting its electronic properties. The RDG scattered plot 
topological analysis indicated significant Van der Waals interactions and steric 
repulsions. Accordingly, the present study concludes that 3,5-dichloro benzyl 
propyl ester is a promising new drug for treating oral cancer.

Brain metastases from colorectal cancer are rare but carry a dismal prognosis. 
This study aimed to develop and externally validate a prognostic model for 
individualized survival prediction in affected patients. The model was 
constructed using a training cohort of 112 patients diagnosed with brain 
metastases after initial colorectal cancer treatment at our institution between 
1985 and 2017, and validated in an external cohort of 114 patients referred for 
brain metastasis treatment between 1987 and 2017. A nomogram was developed 
incorporating five variables: age, performance status assessed by the Karnofsky 
Performance Status scale, number of brain metastases, maximum size of brain 
lesions, and number of prior systemic chemotherapy regimens. In the training 
cohort, the median survival was 6.6 months, with 1-year and 3-year survival 
rates of 29.0% and 7.2%. Poorer performance status, multiple metastases, and 
higher number of chemotherapy regimens were associated with worse prognosis. In 
the validation cohort, median survival was 5.8 months, with 1-year and 3-year 
survival rates of 27.0% and 8.4%. Harrell's concordance index was 0.70 for 
internal validation and 0.63 for external validation. This model may provide a 
clinically useful tool for individualized survival estimation in patients with 
brain metastases from colorectal cancer.

The Kruppel-like factor 15(KLF15) gene functions as a crucial transcriptional 
modulator involved in numerous cellular processes such as differentiation, 
proliferation, growth, and programmed cell death. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) provides malignant cells with the adaptability and movement 
necessary for tumor advancement and spread, with zinc finger E-box binding 
homeobox 1(ZEB1) playing a pivotal role as a transcriptional factor in EMT. This 
investigation initially examined the association between the KLF15 protein and 
EMT associated transcription factors such as ZEB1, Slug, and Snail, along with 
marker proteins like E-cadherin and β-catenin in bladder cancer. Furthermore, we 
explored their connections with clinicopathological attributes and conducted 
prognostic analyses. Immunohistochemical techniques were utilized to ascertain 
the presence of KLF15 protein and EMT-associated transcription factor proteins, 
along with their marker proteins in 110 specimens of bladder cancer tissues. 
Concurrently, clinicopathological data and postoperative survival statistics 
were amassed. The rates of KLF15 and Slug protein expression were linked with 
pathological differentiation, lymphatic involvement, and pTNM staging. The 
protein expression rates of ZEB1, Slug, Snail, E-cadherin, and β-catenin also 
showed associations with lymphatic metastasis and pTNM stages. Notably, the 
expression of KLF15, the coexpression of KLF15 and ZEB1, and lymphatic 
metastasis emerged as independent prognostic indicators for the overall survival 
rates in bladder cancer cases. EMT enhances the risk of tumor recurrence and 
reduces overall survival durations in bladder cancer cases. Furthermore, KLF15 
is a significant contributor to the EMT pathway in bladder cancer, primarily 
through its interaction with the transcription factor ZEB1. KLF15 and ZEB1 might 
serve as key biomarkers for metastasis and prognosis, offering potential new 
targets for therapeutic intervention in bladder cancer.

Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and primary psychiatric 
disorders (PPD) have symptomatic overlap that leads to diagnostic challenges. 
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) tests have revolutionized prenatal non-invasive testing 
and cancer diagnostics. This study investigated the diagnostic potential of 
brain-derived cfDNA in plasma to differentiate sporadic bvFTD from PPD subjects. 
Targeted bisulfite sequencing was conducted to quantify glial and neuronal cfDNA 
levels in plasma samples from 179 bvFTD and 102 PPD subjects of the multi-center 
DIPPA-FTD study. No significant differences were observed in the absolute levels 
of glial or neuronal cfDNA between the groups. However, the neuronal-to-glial 
cfDNA ratio (NGR) was significantly higher in PPD cases (p = 0.0002), suggesting 
a relative increase in neuronal cfDNA in PPD compared to bvFTD. Diagnostic 
performance analysis revealed that neuronal cfDNA and NGR achieved an area under 
the curve (AUC) of 0.74, with a sensitivity of 90% but a specificity of 44% in 
distinguishing bvFTD from PPD. While increased serum levels of neurofilament 
light (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) have been shown to 
effectively differentiate bvFTD from PPD, the addition of brain-derived cfDNA 
did not provide any incremental diagnostic benefit over these established 
biomarkers.

Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) has been shown to 
confer immunosuppressive effects when expressed on tumor associated macrophages 
and thus has become a prominent focus of cancer research in recent years. The 
primary aims of this study were to explore the distribution of TREM2-expressing 
macrophages in early-stage ER+ breast cancer, specifically asking if there is a 
correlation with tumor aggressiveness and/or metabolic syndrome. To address 
these aims, we performed immunofluorescent staining for TREM2, CD68, and DAPI in 
95 early-stage breast cancer samples from patients who underwent surgery at 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center. We assessed associations between 
TREM2+CD68+ cell density in three distinct regions of the tumor and multiple 
tumor characteristics, prognostic factors, and metabolic syndrome criteria. 
Although some analyses, including associations with menopausal status, hormone 
receptor expression, and histological subtype, reached statistical significance, 
the overall data revealed no significant associations between TREM2-expressing 
macrophages and tumor prognostic factors or metabolic syndrome criteria in 
early-stage ER+ breast cancer. Consequently, our results indicate that TREM2 
likely does not serve as a reliable biomarker for ER+ breast cancer. However, 
TREM2 may still hold prognostic value in other subtypes such as triple negative 
breast cancer.

Trans-cinnamaldehyde (TCA), a natural compound isolated from the stem bark of 
Cinnamon cassia, has been recognized as a potential therapeutic agent for 
treating various diseases, including inflammatory conditions and diverse 
cancers. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is known to induce 
apoptosis selectively in cancer cells while sparing normal cells. However, 
resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis is a significant limitation in cancer 
therapy. This study aimed to investigate whether TCA could enhance the 
sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to TRAIL induced apoptosis and to 
elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in this synergistic 
effect. The study was designed to evaluate the antitumor effects of TCA and 
TRAIL, both individually and in combination, using colorectal cancer cell lines 
and in vivo models. Various colorectal cancer cell lines and normal cells were 
treated with TCA, TRAIL, or their combination. Cell viability assays were 
conducted to determine the synergistic effects. Western blotting was performed 
to analyze the expression of ER stress-related proteins. Knockdown of DR5 or 
CHOP was achieved using siRNA to evaluate its role in the combined anticancer 
effect. in vivo experiments were conducted to confirm the antitumor effects of 
the TCA and TRAIL combination. We observed that the combination of TCA and TRAIL 
exhibits synergistic antitumor effects both in vitro and in vivo. The anticancer 
effect was notably enhanced when TCA and TRAIL were used to treat various 
colorectal cancer cell lines, but not normal cells. Additionally, the levels of 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related proteins, such as phosphorylated 
protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), phosphorylation of the eukaryotic 
initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), increased in a 
dose-dependent manner when treated with TCA. Significantly, TCA elevated DR5 
expression levels through ER stress. Knockdown of CHOP reduced the combined 
effect of TCA and TRAIL. TCA enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in colorectal 
cancer cells by inducing ER stress and upregulating DR5 expression. These 
findings suggest that TCA is a promising agent for overcoming TRAIL resistance 
and improving its therapeutic efficacy in colorectal cancer treatment.

To reduce the adverse reactions associated with perioperative opioid use and to 
enhance postoperative recovery, there has been increasing attention on 
opioid-free anesthesia(OFA) in recent years. However, the efficacy of OFA in 
improving recovery outcomes following colon cancer surgery remains uncertain. 
This study aimed to investigate the effect of OFA on the quality of recovery 
within 30 days after laparoscopic colon cancer surgery. 140 patients undergoing 
elective laparoscopic radical surgery for colon cancer were randomly assigned to 
either an opioid-based anesthesia (A) or OFA (B) group at a 1:1 ratio. Group A 
received sufentanil and propofol for anesthesia induction, maintained with 
remifentanil and propofol. Group B had a quadratus lumborum block (QLB) before 
anesthesia, using esketamine, propofol, and lidocaine for induction and 
maintenance. The primary outcome measure was the Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) 
scale, evaluated at 1 day after surgery. Secondary outcomes included the QoR-15 
score evaluated at 3, 7, and 30 days postoperatively, pain Numerical Rating 
Scale (NRS) scores during movement and rest, effective postoperative Patient 
Controlled Intravenous Analgesia (PCIA) compression, rescue analgesia requests 
within 48 h, hospital and Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) stay duration, 
anesthesia recovery time, and time to first bowel movement. The QoR-15 scores of 
patients in Group B were significantly higher than those in Group A on 
postoperative days 1 (A: 100.60 ± 4.38 vs. B: 109.16 ± 4.78, P < 0.001), 3 (A: 
110.75 ± 4.22 vs. B: 118.34 ± 5.75, P < 0.001), and 7 (A: 121.94 ± 4.35 vs. B: 
126.40 ± 5.71, P < 0.001). Group B had lower NRS scores at rest and during 
movement at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post-surgery compared with Group A (P < 0.001). 
Group B had longer anesthesia recovery (P < 0.001) and PACU stays (P < 0.001) 
than group A, but fewer PCIA compressions (P < 0.001) and rescue analgesics 
within 48 h (P < 0.05), shorter times to first flatus (P < 0.05), and shorter 
postoperative hospital stay (P < 0.05). OFA enhances short-term QoR-15 scores, 
alleviates pain, and reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after 
laparoscopic colon cancer surgery. However, it extends anesthesia recovery and 
PACU stay, with unclear effects on long-term recovery.

This study aims to reveal the influence of SERPINA1 gene on the development, 
prognosis evaluation and immune environment changes of breast cancer. Cell lines 
with differential SERPINA1 expression were constructed. These models were used 
to explore its impact on the biological behavior of breast cancer cells. The 
expression of SERPINA1 in breast tumor tissues of patients undergoing surgery in 
our hospital was detected by immunohistochemistry to evaluate the regulatory 
effect of SERPINA1 gene on tumor microenvironment. The results found that the 
overexpression of SERPINA1 gene could significantly inhibit the proliferation 
and migration of breast cancer cells and promote apoptosis. Transcriptome 
sequencing analysis revealed that SERPINA1 may regulate the biological behavior 
of cells by affecting biological functional pathways such as adaptive immune 
response, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and phosphatidylinositol 
signaling system1. Western blot analysis showed that SERPINA1 overexpression was 
accompanied by an increase in PTEN expression and a decrease in Akt and mTOR 
phosphorylation levels, suggesting a molecular mechanism by which SERPINA1 gene 
and PTEN cooperate to negatively regulate the passage of PI3K. In addition, the 
high expression of SERPINA1 is related to the recruitment of regulatory T cells 
(Treg) in breast cancer tissues, which may change the tumor microenvironment.

Skin cancer is a disease that affects people of all ages. Automated diagnosis of 
skin cancer reduces the rate of death by detecting the disease at primary phase. 
Visual inspecting at the clinical inspection of skin lesion is one of the hard 
procedure because the similarity between the lesions exists. In this manuscript, 
Optimized Auxiliary Classifier Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network 
fostered Skin Cancer Classification from Dermoscopic Images (OAC-WGAN-SCC-DI) is 
proposed. Initially, the input Skin dermoscopic images are engaged from the 
dataset of Skin Lesion Images for Melanoma Classification. The Dynamic 
Context-Sensitive Filter was used in removing noise and increasing the quality 
of Skin dermoscopic image. Next, these pre-processed images are given to Classic 
Semantic Segmentation Algorithm for segmenting ROI region.The segmented ROI 
region is given into Dual-Domain Feature Extraction for extracting Radiomic 
features such as Grayscale statistic features and Haralick Texture features. The 
extracted features are given into the Auxiliary Classifier Wasserstein 
Generative Adversarial Network (ACWGAN) which classifies the skin cancers, like 
Melanocytic nevus, Basal cell carcinoma, Actinic Keratosis, Benign keratosis, 
Dermatofibroma, Vascular lesion including Squamous cell carcinoma. In general, 
ACWGAN does not show any optimization adaption methods to determine the optimum 
parameterto offer accurate skin cancer classification. Artificial Humming Bird 
Optimization Algorithm is proposed in this manuscript to optimize ACWGAN 
classifier that classifies skin cancer precisely. The proposed OAC-WGAN-SCC-DI 
is implemented using MATLAB. To classify Skin cancer, performance metrics like 
precision, accuracy, F1-score, Recall (Sensitivity), Matthew's correlation 
coefficient, specificity, Jaccard co-efficient, Error rate, ROC, computational 
time are considered. Performance of the OAC-WGAN-SCC-DI approach attains 13.11%, 
27.12% and 18.73% high specificity, 29.13%, 23.04% and 19.51% lower computation 
Time, 22.29%, 5.365%, 1.551% and 3.915% higher ROC and 28.65%, 3.98%, and 17.15% 
higher MCC compared with existing methods such as Skin cancer classification of 
Convolutional Neural Network with optimized squeeze Net by Bald Eagle Search 
optimization (DCNN-SCC-DI) and Skin cancer detection of Convolutional Neural 
Network using Gray Wolf Optimization (CNN-TL-SCC-DI), Hybrid convolutional 
neural networkswith SVM classifier for categorization of skin cancer 
(SVM-SCC-DI) respectively.

Identifying molecular signatures from complex disease patients with underlying 
symptomatic similarities is a significant challenge in the analysis of 
high-dimensional multi-omics data. Topological data analysis (TDA) provides a 
way of extracting such information from the geometric structure of the data and 
identifying multi-way higher-order relationships. Here, we propose an 
application of harmonic persistent homology, which overcomes the limitation of 
the ambiguity of the choice of a cycle representing a specific homology class. 
When applied to multi-omics data, this leads to the discovery of hidden patterns 
highlighting the relationships between different omic profiles, while allowing 
for common tasks in multi-omics analyses, such as disease subtyping, and most 
importantly biomarker identification for similar latent biological pathways that 
are associated with complex diseases. Our experiments on multiple cancer data 
show that harmonic persistent homology effectively dissects multi-omics data to 
identify biomarkers by detecting representative cycles predictive of disease 
subtypes.

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is marked by a myogenesis differentiation blockade, and 
while the AKT/mTOR pathway is universally activated, its pharmacological 
inhibition has shown limited success. Here, we evaluate the activity of pan-AKT 
inhibitors Ipatasertib, ATP-competitive, and Miransertib, allosteric inhibitor, 
in RMS cell lines and fusion-positive/negative patient-derived xenografts (PDX). 
Unlike Miransertib, Ipatasertib show significant antitumor activity against a 
subset of RMS. Besides AKT, the other target of Ipatasertib, but not of 
Miransertib, is PRKG1, a cGMP-dependent protein kinase that shares the ATP 
binding pocket with AKT. We investigate the role of PRKG1 in PRKG1-depleted RMS 
cells and in xenograft models by transcriptomic approaches. PRKG1 silencing in 
RMS cells reduces tumor formation in xenograft models and induces a 
differentiated myogenic transcriptome. RMS show higher PRKG1 expression compared 
to any other developmental cancer, akin to fetal skeletal muscle. Importantly, 
PRKG1 expression in RMS correlates with mesodermal transcriptional signature and 
enhanced sensitivity to Ipatasertib, regardless of the fusion oncogene status. 
The antitumor activity of Ipatasertib is dose-dependent, reaching an effective 
intra-tumor concentration when administered at 25 mg/kg daily. This study 
unveils the role of PRKG1 in myogenesis and highlights the potential of PRKG1 as 
a clinical biomarker for Ipatasertib therapy in RMS.

14,15-Dihydroclerodin, or dihydroclerodin-I (DCLR), is a natural product that 
can also be synthesized through catalytic hydrogenation of clerodin. In this 
study, dihydroclerodin, purified from Clerodendrum viscosum leaves, was 
evaluated for its cell cycle arrest and cytotoxic effects in Allium cepa root 
tip cells and compared with colchicine-induced antimitotic activity. Treatments 
with dihydroclerodin at concentrations of 100, 200, and 300 µg mL-1, and 
colchicine at 150 µg mL-1 (as a positive control), were administered for 2, 4, 
and 4 + 16 h (4-hour treatment followed by 16 h of recovery). The highest 
frequency of metaphase cells was observed with dihydroclerodin (300 µg mL-1) and 
colchicine (150 µg mL-1) at 4 h, with values of 75.09 ± 0.93% and 78.31 ± 0.49%, 
respectively. Both treatments significantly increased the percentages of 
aberrant cells, chromosomal aberrations (CA), micronuclei (MN), C-metaphases 
(C-Met), and polyploid (PP) cells. These findings suggest that dihydroclerodin 
exhibits strong antimitotic effects, warranting further investigation of its 
potential in cancer chemotherapy due to its ability to induce cell cycle delay 
and cytotoxicity.

RNA splicing dysregulation has emerged as a hallmark of cancer and a promising 
therapeutic target; however, its full landscape in human solid cancer remains 
poorly characterized. To address this, we perform alternative splicing analyses 
using RNA-sequencing data from 751 lung adenocarcinoma samples from our cohort 
integrated with 519 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Visualization of 
splicing patterns using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding reveals 
substantial inter-tumor heterogeneity driven by distinct molecular subtypes and 
histological differentiation. We identify a unique molecular subtype associated 
with inactivating mutations in CMTR2, which encodes Cap-specific mRNA 
(nucleoside-2'-O-)-methyltransferase 2. CMTR2 mutations are observed in 3.8% of 
cases and are predominantly truncating mutations, which form an isolated cluster 
within the splicing landscape. Intrinsic and CRISPR-Cas9-engineered CMTR2 
mutations disrupt alternative splicing and sensitize cancer cells to 
sulfonamide-based RNA splicing modulators and immune checkpoint blockade 
therapy. Retrospective patient data confirm the increased sensitivity of 
CMTR2-deficient tumors to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. These findings 
uncover a previously unrecognized RNA splicing deficiency in human cancers and 
define a molecular subtype of lung adenocarcinoma driven by RNA splicing 
dysregulation, suggesting targets for therapeutic intervention in lung cancer.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the most aggressive subtypes of 
breast cancer, with limited targeted treatment options and poor clinical 
outcomes. HER3 has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic target, with 
HER3-directed antibody-drug conjugates advancing to Phase III clinical trials 
for non-small cell lung cancer. However, the downstream molecular mechanisms by 
which HER3 promotes TNBC progression remain poorly defined. In this study, we 
uncovered a previously unrecognized HER3/miR-34b-5p/PHF8 signaling axis that 
drives TNBC cell proliferation and tumor growth. Mechanistically, HER3 
activation suppresses the tumor-suppressive microRNA miR-34b-5p, resulting in 
the upregulation of the histone demethylase PHF8 (KDM7B), which in turn 
represses the expression of the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 and facilitates G1-S cell 
cycle progression. Functional studies using shRNA-mediated knockdown and 
overexpression systems demonstrate that PHF8 is a critical downstream effector 
of HER3. PHF8 depletion phenocopied HER3 knockdown, inducing G1 arrest and 
suppressing colony formation and proliferation in multiple TNBC cell lines, 
while PHF8 overexpression rescued the inhibitory effects of HER3 loss. 
Furthermore, orthotopic xenograft models revealed that enforced PHF8 expression 
restored tumor growth suppressed by HER3 silencing in vivo. Clinically, HER3 and 
PHF8 expression levels were positively correlated in TNBC tissue specimens, and 
TCGA dataset analyses indicated that the HER3/miR-34b-5p/PHF8 axis is 
significantly associated with poor survival outcomes in breast cancer patients. 
Collectively, our findings establish a novel epigenetic regulatory circuit 
through which HER3 drives TNBC progression and lay the groundwork for future 
therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting HER3-epigenetic crosstalk in TNBC.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the primary drivers of cancer-related 
mortality worldwide. Despite advancements in cancer diagnosis and management, 
there is a lack of effective available treatment options for such patients. This 
is often attributed to late diagnosis, lack of biomarkers, and resistance 
against standard-of-care therapies. Thus, identifying novel targets in RCC is 
needed to improve disease outcomes. Cu is a trace element required for 
homeostasis, and its dysregulation is linked to cancer. Cuproptosis, a 
programmed cell death, occurs due to intracellular Cu overload, disrupting the 
TCA cycle, inducing oxidative stress, and impairing metabolism. In cancer, 
abnormal Cu levels drive Cu-dependent proliferation, termed cuproplasia. The 
role of cuproptosis and cuproplasia in RCC remains unclear; their comprehensive 
understanding will enable the discovery of novel targets for effective therapy. 
This review explores their molecular mechanisms, impact on RCC progression, and 
therapeutic potential.

TRPV6 is a member of the vanilloid subfamily of transient receptor potential 
channels, which serves as the master regulator of Ca2+ homeostasis. TRPV6 
functions as a constitutively active Ca2+ channel, and emerging evidence 
indicates that its overactivity underpins the progression of several human 
diseases, including cancer. Hence, there is a pressing need to identify TRPV6 
inhibitors in conjunction with a deep mechanistic understanding of their effects 
on the channel activity. Here we combine cryo-electron microscopy, mutagenesis, 
electrophysiology and molecular dynamics modeling to decipher the molecular 
mechanism of TRPV6 inhibition by intracellular Mg2+. Mg2+ appears to bind to 
four, one per subunit, sites around the intracellular entrance to the TRPV6 
channel pore, contributed by the negatively charged residues, D489 in the 
transmembrane helix S5 and D580 in S6. When bound to the D489-D580 site, Mg2+ 
prevents the α-to-π transition in the middle of S6 that accompanies channel 
opening, thus maintaining S6 entirely α-helical, locking the channel in the 
closed state and inhibiting TRPV6-mediated currents. Further exploration of this 
inhibitory mechanism may help to develop future strategies for the treatment of 
TRPV6-associated diseases.

Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an aggressive and therapy-resistant 
subtype of prostate cancer characterized by high levels of endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) stress and metabolic dysregulation. The subsequential metabolic adaptations 
in the cancer cells reinforce survival mechanisms that contribute to therapy 
resistance and metastasis. The oncogenic driver neuroblastoma-derived MYC (MYCN) 
exacerbates ER stress by increasing calcium ion efflux from the ER into 
mitochondria, promoting glycolytic and oxidative stress. Here, we demonstrate 
that nitric oxide (NO) signaling is dysregulated in NEPC, thus allowing impaired 
S-nitrosylation of MYCN and uncontrolled ER stress. We show that exogenous NO 
supplementation restores MYCN S-nitrosylation at Cys4, Cys186, and Cys464. This 
re-establishment significantly reduces ER stress markers, inhibits the unfolded 
protein response (UPR), and suppresses NEPC cell proliferation and colony 
formation in vitro. In an orthotopic NEPC murine model, NO treatment led to a 
substantial reduction in tumor burden and metastasis to the liver and brain, 
with corresponding decreases in chromogranin and synaptophysin expression. 
Additionally, NO supplementation attenuated glycolytic stress by limiting 
calcium-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and modulating metabolic pathways. 
Our findings uncover a direct mechanistic link between MYCN-driven ER stress and 
NEPC progression and highlight NO supplementation as a potential therapeutic 
strategy to counteract lineage plasticity and metabolic adaptations in NEPC. 
These results provide a compelling rationale for further investigation into 
NO-based therapies as a novel intervention for NEPC, a cancer subtype with 
limited treatment options and poor prognosis.

L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2-HG) functions as a metabolite implicated in the 
progression of various tumors. HIF1A, a central regulator of the hypoxic 
response, is known to be regulated by several metabolites. This study aims to 
elucidate whether L-2-HG regulates the function of HIF1A through histone 
lactylation modification, thereby contributing to brain metastasis in renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC). A mouse model of RCC brain metastasis was constructed, and 
high-throughput metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics sequencing 
analyses were conducted. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that L-2-HG enhanced 
HIF1A expression by promoting histone lactylation modification, which suppressed 
ferroptosis and facilitated RCC brain metastasis. In vitro cellular experiments 
were conducted, including cell treatment, transfection, chromatin 
immunoprecipitation (ChIP), malignant phenotype detection assays, Western 
blotting, and RT-qPCR. The results showed that L-2-HG increased the lactylation 
modification of HIF1A and enhanced the resistance of renal cancer cells to 
ferroptosis, thereby increasing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In 
vivo experiments using a nude mouse lung metastasis model demonstrated the 
mechanism through which L-2-HG promoted RCC brain metastasis.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the 3rd leading cause of cancer 
deaths in North America with ~12% survival 5 years after diagnosis. Risk factors 
for PDAC, including smoking and chronic pancreatitis, trigger the unfolded 
protein response (UPR). Global deletion of Activating Transcription Factor 3 
(ATF3), a UPR mediator, restricts preneoplastic progression in mice expressing 
oncogenic KRAS (KRASG12D). However, ATF3 is expressed in malignant and 
non-malignant cells suggesting it may affect multiple cell compartments in PDAC. 
Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine if ATF3 has 
epithelial-specific roles during PDAC initiation. Epithelial cells from mice 
expressing KRASG12D with (Ptf1acreERT/+KRASG12D/+) or without ATF3 
(Atf3-/-Ptf1acreERT/+KRASG12D/+; APK) were characterized before and after 
pancreatic injury. Additionally, mice allowing acinar-specific Atf3 deletion and 
KRASG12D expression (AacinarPK) were compared to Ptf1acreERT/+KRASG12D/+ and APK 
mice following injury. RNA-seq revealed reduced oncogenic pathways in APK acinar 
cells consistent with reduced ADM formation in APK cultures. 
Ptf1acreERT/+KRASG12D/+ and APK organoids showed differential gene expression 
and morphology, with APK organoids exhibiting reduced viability. In vivo, APK 
and AacinarPK tissue showed restricted neoplastic progression and KRAS signaling 
compared to Ptf1acreERT/+KRASG12D/+ mice. This study indicates ATF3 works in a 
cell autonomous fashion, and its absence restricts KRASG12D-mediated PDAC.

The phospholipid scramblases Xkr8 and TMEM16F externalize phosphatidylserine 
(PS) by distinct mechanisms. Xkr8 is activated by caspase-mediated proteolytic 
cleavage and, in synergy with the inactivation of P4-ATPase flippases, results 
in the irreversible externalization of PS on apoptotic cells and an ""eat-me"" 
signal for efferocytosis. In contrast, TMEM16F is a calcium-activated scramblase 
that reversibly externalizes PS on viable cells via the transient increase in 
intracellular calcium in live cells. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is 
abundant with exposed PS, resulting from prolonged oncogenic and metabolic 
stresses and high apoptotic indexes of tumors. Such chronic PS externalization 
in the TME has been linked to host immune evasion from interactions of PS with 
inhibitory PS receptors, such as TAM and TIM family receptors. Here, in an 
effort to better understand the contributions of apoptotic vs live cell 
PS-externalization to tumorigenesis and immune evasion, we employed an EO771 
orthotopic breast cancer model and genetically ablated Xkr8 and TMEM16F using 
CRISPR/Cas9. While neither the knockout of Xkr8 nor TMEM16F showed defects in 
cell intrinsic properties related to proliferation, tumor-sphere formation, and 
growth factor signaling, both knockouts suppressed tumorigenicity in 
immune-competent mice, but not in NOD/SCID or RAG-knockout immune-deficient 
strains. Mechanistically, Xkr8-KO tumors suppressed macrophage-mediated 
efferocytosis, and TMEM16F-KO suppressed ER stress/calcium-induced PS 
externalization. Our data support an emerging idea in immune-oncology that 
constitutive PS externalization, mediated by scramblase dysregulation on tumor 
cells, supports immune evasion in the tumor microenvironment. This links 
apoptosis/efferocytosis and oncogenic stress involving calcium dysregulation, 
contributing to PS-mediated immune escape and cancer progression.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are central architects of the prostate 
cancer (PCa) microenvironment, yet their phenotypic diversity and druggable 
vulnerabilities remain largely uncharted. Here, we present an integrative 
multi-omics characterization of primary ex vivo CAFs from seven treatment-naïve 
PCa patients. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we uncover 
substantial transcriptional heterogeneity among CAFs, with distinct gene 
expression programs related to extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammation, 
immune modulation, and metabolic reprogramming. This phenotypic diversity was 
further supported by variable expression of canonical stromal markers, including 
FAP, SULF1, VIM, CAV1, and αSMA. Transcription factor network analysis revealed 
SOX, FOX, and STAT3 family members as key regulators of pro-tumorigenic CAF 
states. To probe therapeutic vulnerabilities, we performed high-throughput drug 
sensitivity and resistance testing (DSRT) across 396 oncology compounds. CAFs 
exhibited broad sensitivity to multikinase inhibitors, with dasatinib, 
midostaurin, and FGFR inhibitors (AZD4547, erdafitinib) emerging as top 
stromal-directed candidates. These findings underscore the plasticity of 
prostate CAFs and reveal actionable vulnerabilities, supporting the development 
of targeted stromal therapies to disrupt tumor-stroma interactions in PCa.

BACKGROUND: Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is associated with adverse outcomes. We 
hypothesized that CH (JAK2V617F and CALR) is associated with cancer, vascular 
disease, and all-cause mortality, even at a variant allele frequency (VAF) <1%.
METHODS: We screened 19,832 individuals from the Danish General Suburban 
Population Study for JAK2V617F and CALR mutations by digital-droplet PCR. We 
used Cox regression with hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI), 
stratified by CH (JAK2V617F and CALR), VAF (<1% vs. ≥1%), mutation type 
(JAK2V617F or CALR), and JAK2V617F VAF.
RESULTS: The HR (95%CI) for any cancer was 1.71 (1.46-2.01) in CH, 1.28 
(1.05-1.56) in VAF < 1%, 4.35 (3.34-5.66) in VAF ≥ 1%, and higher for JAK2V617F 
but not CALR. For hematological cancer, the HR (95%CI) was 8.41 (6.44-10.99) in 
CH, 3.53 (2.35-5.30) in VAF < 1%, and 40.01 (28.97-55.26) in VAF ≥ 1%, and also 
higher for JAK2V617F and CALR. For arterial diseases, the HR (95%CI) was 1.25 
(1.03-1.52) in CH, 1.75 (1.18-2.59) in VAF ≥ 1%, and 1.28 (1.05-1.55) in 
JAK2V617F. The HR for venous disease was only higher in JAK2V617F VAF ≥ 1%. The 
HR (95%CI) for all-cause mortality was 1.45 (1.19-1.75) in CH, 1.36 (1.10-1.69) 
in VAF < 1%, 1.91 (1.26-2.88) in VAF ≥ 1%, and also higher for JAK2V617F and 
CALR. The population-attributable risk proportion (95%CI) for myeloproliferative 
neoplasms (MPNs) was 76.6% (66.8-86.4) in CH, 47.1% (29.6-64.6) in VAF < 1%, and 
71.0% (59.4-82.6) in VAF ≥ 1%, with a nomogram generated.
CONCLUSIONS: CH-defined by the JAK2V617F and CALR mutations-was associated with 
cancer, MPN, all-cause mortality-even with VAF < 1%-and vascular diseases at 
VAF ≥ 1%. These are novel findings, indicating that the JAK2V617F and CALR 
mutations confer an oncogenic potential with a VAF below the current CH of 
indeterminate potential definition.

ObjectiveThis retrospective case-control study aimed to explore the correlations 
of blood lipid levels, triglyceride-glucose index, systemic immune-inflammation 
index, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio with colorectal cancer and evaluate 
their potential value in early risk prediction.MethodsA total of 120 patients 
admitted to Anqing First People's Hospital between July 2022 and March 2025 were 
categorized into a control group (n = 60, normal colonoscopy) and an observation 
group (n = 60, colorectal cancer). Clinical and laboratory data, including sex, 
age, body mass index, lipid profile, blood glucose, and blood counts, were 
collected. Triglyceride-glucose index, systemic immune-inflammation index, and 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio were calculated accordingly.ResultsThe observation 
group had significantly higher rates of drinking history, body mass index, 
triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
triglyceride-glucose index, systemic immune-inflammation index, and 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (P < 0.05). Triglyceride was strongly positively 
correlated with triglyceride-glucose index (r = 0.921) and negatively correlated 
with platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (r = -0.189). Logistic regression identified 
drinking history (odds ratio = 5.015) and triglyceride-glucose index (odds 
ratio = 5.937) as independent risk factors. The receiver operating curve of 
triglyceride-glucose index showed an area under the curve of 0.713, with 78.3% 
specificity and 65% sensitivity.ConclusionTriglyceride-glucose index, along with 
blood lipid levels, systemic immune-inflammation index, and 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, is closely associated with colorectal cancer. 
Triglyceride-glucose index may be a promising biomarker for early screening.

Veterinary Medicine, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.

Mechlorethamine is commonly prescribed to dogs at 3 mg/m2. The minimal toxicity 
observed indicates that higher doses of mechlorethamine are likely tolerable. 
The primary objective of this study was to determine the maximally tolerated 
dose (MTD) of mechlorethamine in dogs with lymphoma. The secondary objectives 
were to describe the toxicity associated with increased mechlorethamine dose and 
to evaluate the response in treatment-naive dogs treated at the MTD. Dogs with 
histologically or cytologically confirmed intermediate to large cell lymphoma 
were enrolled using a 3 + 3 dose escalation model, starting at 3.5 mg/m2 
mechlorethamine IV, with planned dose increments of 10%-15% between cohorts. 
Adverse events were monitored per VCOG-CTCAE guidelines. Dose-limiting toxicity 
was defined as any grade 3 or 4 adverse event. Thirty dogs were enrolled across 
nine cohorts. Two dogs treated at 12.3 mg/m2 developed asymptomatic grade 4 
neutropenia 7 days after mechlorethamine administration, leading to a MTD of 
10.7 mg/m2. Low-grade vomiting, diarrhoea, and inappetence were recorded amongst 
dogs at several dose levels and were managed with supportive medications. Six of 
10 chemotherapy-naïve dogs treated at the MTD, representing a separate cohort, 
showed partial responses (PR) 7 days post-administration; however, PR was also 
observed at dosages ranging from 3.5 to 12.3 mg/m2 in pre-treated patients. A 
higher dose of mechlorethamine than previously reported can be safely 
administered as a single agent to dogs. Increasing the dose of mechlorethamine 
in combination therapies might offer greater therapeutic benefits.

BACKGROUNDS/AIMS: To evaluate the impact of unplanned conversion to open surgery 
on resection margin status and postoperative complications in patients 
undergoing minimally-invasive resection of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM).
METHODS: This study performed a proportion meta-analysis and meta-regression 
using random-effects modelling in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Studies 
with at least 15 patients that reported conversion to open surgery in 
individuals receiving minimally-invasive CRLM resection were included. The 
association of unplanned conversion with postoperative outcomes was analyzed.
RESULTS: Eighty-six studies encompassing 18,138 patients were analyzed. The 
overall conversion rate was 5.8% (95% CI 5%-6.6%). Conversion was associated 
with improved R0 resection rates (coefficient: 2.167, p < 0.001) but was also 
linked to increased postoperative mortality (coefficient: 7.585, p = 0.001) and 
morbidity (coefficient: 1.737, p = 0.003); there was no significant impact on 
5-year overall survival (coefficient: 0.700, p = 0.989) or 5-year disease-free 
survival (coefficient: -72.900, p = 0.157). Specifically, conversion due to 
oncological concern was associated with higher rates of R0 resection 
(coefficient: 0.638, p = 0.005); conversion resulting from iatrogenic injuries 
was associated with lower R0 resection rates (coefficient: -1.478, p < 0.001); 
conversion for technical difficulties was associated with lower postoperative 
morbidity (coefficient: -0.380, p = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: Unplanned conversion to open may carry prognostic and oncological 
implications for minimally-invasive resection of CRLM. Although conversion due 
to bleeding and iatrogenic injury is routinely considered, conversion prompted 
by technical difficulties or oncological concerns should not be considered 
failure, as it may be associated with improved patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: As a major contributor to cancer-associated deaths, advanced 
colorectal cancer (CRC) has a constrained range of effective treatment options. 
The short isoform of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4-S) has recently been 
implicated as a potential oncogenic driver; however, its regulatory mechanisms 
and functional role in CRC remain incompletely understood.
METHODS: BRD4-S expression, regulation, and function in CRC were investigated 
through bioinformatics analyses of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets, in 
vitro studies using CRC cell lines (HT29, SW620), and in vivo xenograft models 
in nude mice. Experimental approaches included quantitative real-time PCR 
(qRT-PCR), Western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation, RNA immunoprecipitation, 
immunofluorescence, colony formation, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), and scratch 
assays. Gene enrichment and interaction analyses were performed to identify 
relevant pathways and molecular partners.
RESULTS: BRD4-S was markedly upregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines, and 
elevated BRD4-S expression correlated with poorer patient survival. Silencing 
BRD4-S, but not BRD4-L, significantly impaired CRC cell proliferation, 
migration, and tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, the RNA helicase DEAD-box 
helicase 27 (DDX27) interacted with Serine and Arginine Rich Splicing Factor 6 
(SRSF6) to promote alternative splicing of BRD4 pre-mRNA toward the BRD4-S 
isoform. Inhibition of SRSF6 phosphorylation suppressed BRD4-S production and 
blocked activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular 
regulated protein kinases ERK signaling pathway, identified as a key downstream 
effector of BRD4-S.
CONCLUSIONS: This study defines a novel DDX27-SRSF6-BRD4-S-MAPK/ERK signaling 
axis that drives CRC progression. These findings underscore the therapeutic 
potential of targeting BRD4 isoform switching and its regulatory splicing 
machinery in CRC.

BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma (OS) is a highly aggressive primary bone malignancy 
with a prominent propensity for metastasis. The identification of the key 
molecular drivers for OS progression is paramount to developing effective 
therapies. Although kinesin family member 18A (KIF18A) has previously been 
suggested to play a role as a potential oncogene in the development and 
metastatic progression of several types of cancer, little is known about its 
exact functional role in OS.
METHODS: OS datasets were retrieved from the GSE126209 database and the TARGET 
dataset, with a focus on expression data of kinesin family genes. Differential 
expression analysis of these genes was conducted using R, comparing tumor 
tissues to paired adjacent non-tumor tissues, as well as between metastatic and 
non-metastatic cases. In order to illuminate the functional mechanism, pathway 
enrichment analysis was executed through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), 
and the tumor immune microenvironment composition was analyzed comprehensively 
using the CIBERSORT algorithm. Functional experiments were conducted to 
investigate the effects of OS KIF18A on cell behaviors. In vivo experiments were 
used to identify the function of KIF18A on tumor growth. In addition, drug 
sensitivity profiling and analysis of the lncRNA-mediated regulatory network 
were implemented to seek possible therapeutic relevance.
RESULTS: Analysis of the kinesin family gene expression in the GSE126209 OS 
dataset revealed that KIF18A is markedly upregulated in tumor tissues compared 
to normal counterparts. Further analysis of the TARGET database indicated that 
elevated KIF18A expression is associated with metastatic OS, a finding that was 
validated using clinical samples from OS patients. Our functional assay 
indicated that KIF18A increased proliferation, invasion, and migration activity 
of OS cells in vitro and inhibited apoptosis. In line with this, the knockdown 
of KIF18A remarkably suppressed tumor growth in OS xenograft models in vivo. 
Pathway enrichment analysis revealed dysregulation of several key signaling 
pathways associated with KIF18A expression, providing mechanistic insights into 
its oncogenic role. Immune profiling indicated that high KIF18A expression was 
linked to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, drug 
sensitivity analysis indicated that lower KIF18A expression was associated with 
a higher sensitivity to lapatinib. Additionally, a set of lncRNAs associated 
with KIF18A expression was identified, implicating potential regulatory networks 
involved in OS progression.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals that KIF18A is upregulated in OS, particularly in 
metastatic cases, and is linked to poor clinical outcomes. Functional 
experiments confirm that KIF18A promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion 
of OS cells while suppressing apoptosis. In vivo experiments reveal that KIF18A 
knockdown strongly inhibits tumor growth. KIF18A expression correlates with 
dysregulation of key oncogenic pathways, an immunosuppressive microenvironment, 
and potential immunotherapy resistance. These results highlight KIF18A's role as 
a pivotal oncogene in OS progression and suggest its promise as both a 
prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target.

BACKGROUND: Macrophage infiltration is prevalent in lung cancer tissues, 
significantly influencing disease progression and clinical outcomes. Lung 
squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is often diagnosed at advanced stages, resulting 
in poor prognosis. Identifying effective diagnostic biomarkers, particularly 
those associated with macrophage infiltration, is crucial for early detection 
and improved treatment outcomes. This study aims to identify diagnostic markers 
specifically linked to M1 macrophages in LUSC.
METHODS: Differential gene expression analysis and immune cell infiltration 
assessment were conducted using the limma and CIBERSORT packages. The WGCNA 
algorithm was then applied to identify genes in modules related to M1 
macrophages. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) enrichment analyses were used to investigate the biological functions of 
M1 macrophage-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs). To identify M1 
macrophage-associated biomarkers in LUSC, a diagnostic model was developed using 
four machine learning algorithms, with validation through nomogram 
visualization, calibration curves, and external datasets. Finally, 
immunohistochemical staining was performed to further confirm the expression of 
hub genes and the predictive accuracy of M1 macrophage-related biomarkers in 
LUSC.
RESULTS: A total of 143 M1 macrophage-related DEGs were identified, which were 
involved in regulating immune response pathways. The support vector machine 
(SVM) model based on these genes demonstrated exceptional performance, with area 
under the curve (AUC) values of 0.995 in the training cohort and 1.000 in three 
external validation datasets. Immunohistochemical analysis further confirmed the 
diagnostic accuracy of Matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7), Reticulon-1 (RTN1), 
Zinc finger protein ZIC 2 (ZIC2), Killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily B 
member 1 (KLRB1), and C-X-C motif chemokine 13 (CXCL13), yielding an AUC of 
0.992. These results highlight the strong diagnostic capability of the 5 hub 
genes in LUSC.
CONCLUSION: The study highlights the pivotal role of M1 macrophage-related DEGs 
in LUSC tumorigenesis. The newly identified 5 hub genes provide a highly 
accurate diagnostic tool for LUSC, offering potential improvements for both 
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND: Primary liver cancer (PLC) exhibits a high incidence and mortality 
rate. Early diagnosis and effective treatment are crucial for improving patient 
survival rates. This study aims to identify biomarkers of hepatitis B-related 
liver cancer and establish a new method for molecular subtype classification 
based on differential metabolite-related regulatory gene expression profiles.
METHODS: This study collected sterile midstream urine samples from patients with 
hepatitis B-related liver cancer who had not received standardized systematic 
antiviral therapy or anticancer therapy, as well as from healthy controls. 
Potential biomarkers were identified through liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based metabolomics, followed by Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis performed on the differential 
metabolites. Gene expression data of 371 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples 
in The Cancer Genome Atlas-Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC) database 
were clustered using gene annotations for differential metabolites derived from 
the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB). The Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curve was 
employed to assess the prognosis of different HCC molecular subtypes. Expression 
differences of subtype-specific genes and their enrichment in Hallmark, KEGG and 
Gene Ontology (GO) pathways were analyzed. The Tumor Immune Dysfunction and 
Exclusion (TIDE) scoring tool was used to evaluate the subtypes' response to 
immunotherapy. Sensitivity to sorafenib was also compared across the different 
subtypes.
RESULT: A total of 53 differential metabolites were identified (p < 0.01), which 
were significantly enriched in seven metabolic pathways (p < 0.05). Three 
potential biomarkers were discovered: Suberic acid, 2'-O-methylcytidine, and 
3'-Sialyllactose. Regulatory genes associated with these differential 
metabolites clustered HCC samples from the TCGA-LIHC database into two molecular 
subtypes (C1 and C2). KM survival analysis indicated that patients in the C2 
subtype exhibited higher overall survival compared to those in C1. Differential 
genes between the two subtypes were significantly enriched in Hallmark, KEGG and 
GO pathways. The TIDE scoring tool revealed a higher likelihood of immune escape 
in C1 subtype patients. Molecular targeted drug analysis suggested that 
sorafenib may be more effective in patients with the C1 subtype.
CONCLUSIONS: Suberic acid, 2'-O-methylcytidine, and 3'-Sialyllactose hold 
promise as metabolic biomarkers for hepatitis B-related liver cancer. 
Understanding the diversity of the human liver cancer gene expression profile 
from a metabolomic perspective has potential applications for developing novel 
clinical treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Resistance to anoikis is a critical mechanism that enables 
metastatic dissemination. Abrogation of this cellular safeguard is therefore a 
hallmark of aggressive cancer progression. Despite the importance of anoikis, 
there are still few biomarkers among anoikis-related genes (ARGs) that could aid 
in the prognostication of bladder cancer (BC) patients and potentially serve as 
drug targets.
METHODS: This study leveraged bioinformatics analyses of publicly available BC 
datasets to evaluate the association between differentially expressed ARGs and 
patient prognosis. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) 
regression analysis was employed to build a novel prognostic signature model for 
BC based on ARGs. This model was also used to predict the response of BC to 
anticancer drugs. Additionally, immunohistochemistry was used to assess 
expression of the key gene, MYC, in BC samples obtained from patients undergoing 
surgery and from those receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy.
RESULTS: The ARG-based signature, developed and validated through the analysis 
of public databases, was an independent predictor of patient outcomes. 
Furthermore, it effectively stratified patients into two cohorts (high- and 
low-risk), allowing investigation of differential drug sensitivities. The risk 
stratification model identified 10 ARGs (IGF1, CALR, E2F1, MYC, PLK1, SATB1, 
FASN, ID2, RAC3, and GKN1) as potential therapeutic vulnerabilities. Notably, 
MYC was identified as a central hub gene within the ARG signature. Elevated MYC 
expression was strongly associated with worse prognosis in muscle-invasive 
bladder cancer (MIBC), and with a diminished response to immunotherapy.
CONCLUSION: This work demonstrated significant prognostic value for the 
ARG-based model. Specific ARGs could function as crucial biomarkers for patient 
outcome, while simultaneously offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention.

BACKGROUND: Research on the molecular progression of esophageal squamous 
dysplasia to cancer remains limited. The majority of prior studies have focused 
on morphological precancerous lesions sampled adjacent to tumors, and have 
relied primarily on the analysis of data from whole-exome sequencing.
METHODS: To investigate the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 
(ESCC), whole genome analysis was conducted on 13 precancerous tissues and 15 
ESCC tissues. Field effects were avoided by using biopsies of squamous dysplasia 
from patients without concurrent tumor, thereby allowing study of molecular 
alterations associated with the true precancerous state.
RESULTS: Our results revealed frequent copy number alterations (CNAs) and 
structural variants (SVs) in esophageal squamous dysplasia. These changes were 
also detected in ESCC, indicating that genomic instability markers such as CNAs 
and SVs occur at an early stage and persist throughout ESCC evolution. The 
detection of TP53 mutations and CASP8 deletions in both premalignant lesions and 
ESCC suggests they may be early driving events during esophageal carcinogenesis. 
Mutations in MUC5B were observed in 7.7% of precancerous lesions and 6.7% of 
ESCC. Moreover, these mutations were associated with a higher tumor mutational 
burden (TMB) and an immune ""hot"" tumor microenvironment. Apolipoprotein B 
mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) enzyme-associated mutational 
signatures were exclusively identified in ESCC and may further exacerbate 
genomic instability in the more advanced stages of tumorigenesis. Significantly 
higher ploidy alterations levels were detected in ESCC compared to squamous 
dysplasia. Moreover, the cohort that underwent local recurrence of dysplasia 
within two years had significantly elevated ploidy alterations levels compared 
to those with no long-term recurrence. These results indicate that elevated 
levels of aneuploidy and genomic instability were associated with tumor 
progression and local recurrence of dysplasia.
CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in TP53 and MUC5B, as well as deletion of CASP8, may be 
early driver events in carcinogenesis and could precede the emergence of the 
APOBEC mutation signature. Moreover, ploidy alterations confer a selective 
advantage to genomically unstable cells, thereby promoting their progression 
toward malignant transformation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that 
genomic instability is prevalent in precancerous lesions and intensifies during 
the late stages of tumor progression. Cells with a certain level of genomic 
instability appear to possess a competitive advantage for malignant 
transformation.

The tumor microenvironment, especially the extracellular matrix (ECM), plays a 
critical role in cancer initiation and progression, although its underlying 
mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Conventional therapies (such as 
chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy) often produce unsatisfactory outcomes. 
Immunotherapy, while showing limited clinical success to date, holds 
considerable promise. Growing evidence indicates that the biophysical properties 
of the ECM interact with immune cells, contributing to mechanisms of 
immunotherapy resistance in cancer. Alterations in these ECM properties can 
impair immune cell infiltration and function, thereby diminishing the 
effectiveness of immunotherapeutic approaches. This review explores how the 
biophysical features of the ECM and their crosstalk with tumor immune evasion 
pathways highlight the potential of ECM-targeted immunotherapy as an innovative 
strategy for cancer treatment.

Ionizing Radiation in Clinical Diagnostics and Radiotherapy: The Dual Role of 
NRF2 in Cell Protection and Carcinogenesis.

Ionizing radiations (IRs), commonly used in both diagnostic imaging and cancer 
therapy, generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals, causing 
significant DNA damage that can lead to genetic mutations, cell death, and 
tissue injury in both normal and tumor tissues. In response to the oxidative 
stress, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is activated to 
induce target genes involved in antioxidant and detoxifying pathways, thereby 
playing a pivotal role in protecting cells from IR-induced oxidative damage. In 
clinical diagnostics, IR exposure from imaging techniques can result in DNA 
damage, inflammation, and increased risk of IR-induced pathologies, including 
cancer. NRF2 activation in response to these diagnostic exposures can help to 
protect normal tissues from damage by boosting antioxidant defenses. In 
radiotherapy, IR induces DNA damage to kill malignant cells, although it may 
also harm surrounding healthy tissue. Cancer cells exploit NRF2 activation to 
resist IR-induced cell damage, thereby maintaining redox balance and protecting 
themselves from oxidative stress. In that case, NRF2 inhibition could sensitize 
cancer cells to IR effects by disrupting their antioxidant defense, leading to 
increased ROS accumulation, enhanced DNA damage, and greater cell death. This 
review will summarize the role of NRF2 in mediating the response to IR in both 
healthy and cancerous cells, with a focus on its effects in clinical diagnostic 
and radiotherapy.

The nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin 
domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a multiprotein complex fundamental 
for the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines during the innate immune 
response. NLRP3 dysregulation is implicated in the pathogenesis of several 
diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, cancer, Alzheimer's 
disease, and type 2 diabetes. The pharmacological modulation of NLRP3 by several 
compounds, which are fully described in this review, represents an important 
strategy to regulate inflammatory processes. Moreover, NLRP3 is also involved in 
drug-related adverse reactions, and its pharmacological modulation represents a 
rapid strategy to mitigate such adverse effects, as reported in this study. 
NLRP3 inflammasome activation is tightly regulated by post-transcriptional 
modifications and epigenetic factors, such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 
DNA methylation, as well as other interacting regulators. Recently, different 
studies have revealed the importance of NLRP3 levels in predicting drug 
response. In particular, the methylation of the NLRP3 promoter, which is 
associated with the inflammasome expression level, emerged as a new promising 
pharmacoepigenetic biomarker for the glucocorticoid therapy response in several 
inflammatory disease conditions.

Liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), represents a global 
health challenge. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in the 
progression and therapeutic resistance of HCC. Interventional therapies have 
emerged as pivotal modalities in the treatment of liver cancer, especially in 
cases that are unsuitable for surgical resection. The evolution of these 
techniques has been markedly enhanced by the integration of artificial 
intelligence (AI), which has the potential to increase precision, improve 
outcomes, and personalize patient care. This review covers modern interventional 
therapies for liver cancer, highlighting recent advances in minimally invasive 
procedures. It describes the intricate liver TME and emphasizes the importance 
of characterizing its diversity and identifying therapeutic targets. 
Additionally, we discuss how AI can decipher TME complexities, predict 
responses, categorize patients, and personalize treatments. By elucidating 
connections between the TME, therapeutic interventions, and AI, this review aims 
to improve the management and care of patients with liver cancer.

Lung cancer (LC), the leading cause of death due to malignancy in both males and 
females, is common in patients with coexisting respiratory comorbidities. Many 
of these share common etiologies with LC such as smoking, biomass fume or 
occupational exposure, and ambient air pollution, but also a genetic 
predisposition and/or common pathophysiologic mechanisms, chief among them 
chronic inflammation, altered immune surveillance, cell injury and increased 
turnover, to name a few. This common thread puts patients with respiratory 
comorbidities at increased risk of developing LC. The present article reviews 
why patients with 5 of the most prevalent chronic respiratory diseases (COPD, 
asthma, Interstitial Lung Disease, Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Bronchiectasis) 
are at increased risk of LC and the potential pathological mechanisms underlying 
this clinically relevant association.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to comprehensively evaluate oral health-related 
quality of life (OHRQoL) and associated factors from multiple perspectives in 
patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) with maxillary prostheses after 
maxillectomy.
STUDY DESIGN: After obtaining informed consent, OHRQoL, HNC-specific QoL, and 7 
oral functions based on the concept of oral hypofunction were investigated in 
study participants. Participants were classified into 2 groups according to 
OHRQoL scores: G1, better OHRQoL and G2, poorer OHRQoL. HNC-specific QoL and 
oral functions were compared between the 2 groups. Additionally, associations of 
OHRQoL with oral functions and cancer-related therapies were comprehensively 
investigated using 3 logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: Fifty patients with HNC were enrolled. In HNC-specific QoL, significant 
differences between G1 and G2 were found in swallowing (P < 0.01) and social 
eating (P = 0.01). Significant moderate correlations with the OHRQoL score were 
detected in social eating and social contact (P < 0.01). Swallowing function 
showed a significant difference between G1 and G2 (P < 0.01). Logistic 
regression analyses revealed the significant associations of OHRQoL with 
swallowing function (odds ratio: 8.75, P < 0.01) and surgical reconstruction 
(odds ratio: 0.22, P = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Swallowing function, surgical reconstruction, and social activities 
were significantly associated with OHRQoL in patients with HNC with maxillary 
prostheses after maxillectomy.

INTRODUCTION: While clinical lymph node status remains a key determinant in 
rectal cancer treatment, its accuracy is limited. This study aimed to evaluate 
the impact of inaccurate MRI-based nodal staging on survival in early and 
intermediate-risk rectal cancer in a Dutch national cohort.
METHODS: This retrospective study analysed data from the Netherlands Cancer 
Registry. Rectal cancer patients diagnosed between 2014 and 2017 with cT1-3N0M0 
rectal cancer undergoing direct TME surgery, and cT1-3N1M0 rectal cancer 
receiving neoadjuvant short-course radiotherapy (SCRT) followed by direct TME 
surgery were included. Patients were categorized in four groups based on 
clinical (cN) and pathological (pN) nodal status: cN0pN0, cN0pN1, cN1pN0, and 
cN1pN1. Overall survival (OS) and factors associated with OS were analysed using 
Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses.
RESULTS: Among 4080 patients, 19.5 % of 3075 cN0 patients were understaged (pN1) 
and 62.4 % of 1005 cN1 patients were overstaged (pN0). After a median follow up 
of 5.7 (IQR 4.6-6.6) years, OS did not differ between cN0pN1 patients undergoing 
direct surgery and cN1pN1 patients receiving neoadjuvant SCRT followed by 
surgery (p = 0.154). Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that 
inaccurate cN0 staging was not independently associated with worse OS in pN1 
patients, while pT3 disease (HR 1.62, 95 %-CI 1.15-2.27 for pN1; and HR 1.52, 
95 %-CI 1.22-1.88 for pN0) was associated with worse OS compared to pT1-2 in 
both pN1 and pN0 patients.
CONCLUSION: Inaccurate clinical nodal staging by MRI is common in early and 
intermediate-risk rectal cancer, but it does not seem to have a negative impact 
on OS.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Genetic mutations associated chronic pancreatitis (GCP), 
caused by pathogenic variants in SPINK1, PRSS1, or CFTR, represents a distinct 
subset of chronic pancreatitis, whereas alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (ACP) is 
the predominant adult etiology. We compared the clinical course and pancreatic 
cancer risk between GCP and ACP.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort included GCP patients from a prospective 
registry with genetic testing (2009-2023) and ACP patients from a clinical 
database (1989-2023). Propensity score matching (1:3) balanced age, sex, BMI, 
smoking, diabetes, and Cambridge grade, yielding 139 GCP and 309 ACP patients. 
Outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression, and cancer 
incidence was calculated per person-years with Poisson regression.
RESULTS: In the matched GCP cohort, mutation distribution was SPINK1 67.6 % 
(94/139), PRSS1 15.8 % (22/139), and CFTR 11.5 % (16/139). Compared with ACP, 
GCP patients had more frequent pancreatic pain (89.2 % vs 77.3 %, p = 0.005) and 
a younger mean age at onset (26.5 vs 40.6 years, p < 0.001). New-onset diabetes 
was more common (35.3 % vs 21.7 %, p = 0.004) but developed later (22.5 vs 12.7 
years, p < 0.001). Pancreatic atrophy occurred less often and later in GCP. 
Pancreatic cancer incidence was higher in GCP (4.24 vs 0.40 per 1000 
person-years; IRR 10.61, p = 0.031), with all cancers arising within 5 years of 
diagnosis, predominantly in SPINK1 gene mutation carriers.
CONCLUSIONS: GCP shows distinct trajectories and an elevated early pancreatic 
cancer risk, particularly in SPINK1 gene mutation carriers, supporting 
genotype-stratified surveillance.

BACKGROUND: Undifferentiated carcinoma of the pancreas (UCP) is a lesser-known 
type of pancreatic cancer with poor knowledge of epidemiology, clinical 
features, survival and prognosis outcomes. This article aims to investigate 
several prognostic factors influencing survival in patients with UCP, with the 
goal of constructing a nomogram predictive model, aiding clinicians in risk 
stratification and personalized treatment decision-making.
METHODS: UCP patient data between 2000 and 2019 was extracted from the 
Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. Univariate and 
multivariable Cox regression analysis were conducted to present prognostic 
factors for overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of UCP 
patients. We applied Kaplan-Meier curves to evaluate the OS and CSS for each 
feature or therapeutic method. Moreover, a nomogram predictive model was 
completed to demonstrate the prognosis of UCP patients.
RESULTS: The study comprised 177 participants specifically selected as UCP 
patients. Kaplan-Meier curves illustrated that UCP patients who were female, 
underwent primary tumor resection (PTR), received chemotherapy, had tumor sizes 
equal to or less than 5 cm, and lacked liver metastasis or exhibited histology 
of osteoclast-like giant cells experienced significantly improved OS and 
cancer-specific survival CSS compared to their male counterparts, those who did 
not undergo PTR or did not receive chemotherapy, had tumor sizes larger than 5 
cm, with liver metastasis, or histology lacking osteoclast-like giant cells. 
Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that histological type, PTR, 
chemotherapy, tumor size, and the presence of liver metastasis independently 
influenced both OS and CSS. The predictive nomogram model demonstrated 
acceptable predictive performance.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram model, which incorporates histological type, PTR, 
chemotherapy, tumor size, and liver metastasis, provides valuable guidance and 
insights for both clinicians and UCP patients.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related 
mortality, with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) being the most common 
subtype. PDAC is often diagnosed at advanced stages due to lack of symptoms and 
reliable early biomarkers.
AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of serum miRNA 221 and 
miRNA 199-a in PDAC and their association with disease progression. It also 
examined the correlation of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) with tumor resectability and disease 
progression.
METHODS: A total of 110 subjects (55 PDAC and 55 healthy controls) were 
recruited.Blood samples were collected to measure the serum miRNA 221, serum 
miRNA 199-a, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-lymphocyte ratio 
(PLR). Diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) was confirmed via 
endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy (EUS-FNB). Patients were 
followed for six months to monitor their disease progression.
RESULTS: Serum miRNA 221 and miRNA 199-a levels were significantly elevated in 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients (p = 0.009 and p = 0.001, respectively), with 
miRNA 221 correlating with tumor size (r = 0.343, p = 0.01). Advanced tumor 
stage (T3, T4) was linked to higher miRNA 221 and NLR levels (p = 0.017, 
p = 0.01). Additionally, lower NLR levels were associated with tumor 
resectability (p < 0.001) and improved survival (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that miRNA 221 and miRNA 199-a may serve as 
diagnostic markers for PDAC. While miRNA 221 and NLR are valuable prognostic 
indicators for tumor progression and patient survival in PDAC. Further 
validation in larger cohorts and across pancreatic and other gastrointestinal 
malignancies is needed.

BACKGROUND: Licoricidin is a prenylated isoflavone isolated from Glycyrrhiza 
uralensis Fisch, and its biological activities and pharmacological properties 
have been reported in recent years. This study comprehensively explored the 
licoricidin's effect on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and elucidated its 
underlying mechanism.
METHODS: HCC Hep3B and Huh-7 cells were treated with licoricidin at various 
concentrations. The experimental methods in vitro, including CCK-8, colony 
formation, EdU, flow cytometry, wound healing, and transwell were performed to 
evaluate the licoricidin's effect on HCC cell proliferation, apoptosis, 
migration, and invasion. The antitumor and anti-metastasis activities of 
licoricidin were validated using a Hep3B xenograft model and a metastasis model. 
Western blot or RT-qPCR was used to measure the levels of apoptosis-, 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition-, and PI3K/AKT-related proteins.
RESULTS: The results indicated that the antiproliferation effect of licoricidin 
in HCC was related to cell cycle arrest (S phase) and apoptosis induction. 
Licoricidin upregulated Bax and cleaved caspase3/9 expression and downregulated 
Bcl-2 expression in cancer cells. In a subcutaneous xenograft model, licoricidin 
treatment suppressed the growth of tumor. Nontoxic concentrations of licoricidin 
reduced the migration and invasion abilities of HCC cells. Licoricidin 
downregulated N-cadherin and vimentin expression, while upregulating E-cadherin 
expression. Licoricidin treatment reduced the number of metastatic lung nodules 
in a metastasis model. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling might be a potential 
mechanism behind the licoricidin's anticancer effect.
CONCLUSION: Overall, licoricidin suppresses growth and metastasis of HCC by 
targeting. PI3K/AKT signaling, suggesting that licoricidin might be a promising 
candidate for HCC treatment.

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (eSCC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor 
prognosis and limited therapeutic options. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase 
(PI3K)/AKT pathway is frequently activated in eSCC, but clinical use of PI3K or 
AKT inhibitors is restricted by toxicity and compensatory signaling. SHIP2, an 
inositol 5-phosphatase encoded by INPPL1, modulates this pathway by converting 
PI(3,4,5)P3 to PI(3,4)P2, thereby regulating AKT activation. We previously 
identified INPPL1 amplification as recurrent in eSCC and demonstrated that SHIP2 
inhibition suppresses tumor growth and synergizes with PLK1 inhibition. Here, we 
extend these findings and show that SHIP2-PLK1 synergy is not confined to eSCC 
but is also observed in multiple colorectal cancer cell lines, revealing a 
conserved vulnerability across tumor types. Mechanistic analyses demonstrate 
that this synergy depends on PI3K/AKT signaling, with SHIP2 inhibition producing 
stronger effects than direct PI3K blockade, suggesting additional regulatory 
functions beyond canonical PI3K control. Furthermore, SHIP2 inhibition enhances 
the cytotoxic activity of standard chemotherapies, including 5-fluorouracil and 
paclitaxel, in eSCC cells. Importantly, these effects occur at sub-cytotoxic 
drug concentrations, indicating potential therapeutic benefit with reduced 
toxicity. Collectively, our results identify SHIP2 as a central regulator of the 
PI3K/AKT axis in eSCC and colorectal cancer and highlight its value as a 
combinatorial target. SHIP2 inhibition represents a promising strategy to 
potentiate existing chemotherapies and targeted agents, opening new avenues for 
the treatment of refractory gastrointestinal cancers.

Secondary breast cancer (SBC) is emerging as the most frequent solid tumour in 
female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) treated with chest radiotherapy (RT). 
Women irradiated with ≥10 Gy before the age of 30 accumulate risks that rival 
those carried by BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, with excess cases appearing ∼8 years 
after RT and persisting lifelong. This review weaves together epidemiological 
data, mechanistic evidence and clinical studies to elucidate how radiation dose 
and field, age at exposure, systemic regimens, host genomics and 
micro-environmental factors interact to drive SBC. Radiation-associated tumours 
display a distinctive profile-earlier onset, frequent bilaterality-posing unique 
therapeutic and prognostic challenges. We discuss current surveillance 
recommendations of annual mammography plus breast MRI from age 25 (or 8 years 
post-RT) and examine preventive strategies ranging from RT de-escalation and 
cardioprotective chemotherapy to lifestyle modification and selective 
chemoprevention. Finally, we highlight emerging imaging and molecular 
biomarkers-most notably MRI background parenchymal enhancement and polygenic 
risk scores-that may enable a shift from 1-size-fits-all follow-up to precision 
survivorship care.

PURPOSE: This study assessed lung volume alterations during radiotherapy (RT) 
and their predictive value for symptomatic radiation pneumonitis (RP) in lung 
cancer patients undergoing definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 49 patients who 
underwent re-simulation four-dimensional (4D) computed tomography (CT) during 
RT. Lung volume was measured on the 30% phase of 4D CT at initial and 
re-simulation scans. Associations between volume changes and symptomatic RP were 
analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. To determine the optimal cut-off value, 
ROC analysis and the Youden index were utilized. RP was graded based on CTCAE 
v5.0.
RESULTS: Among the 49 patients, seven (14.3%) developed symptomatic RP. 
Dosimetric parameters did not differ significantly between patients with and 
without RP. However, changes in ipsilateral lung volume were significantly 
associated with symptomatic RP. A volume decrease >130 cm³ or a relative 
reduction <-7% was predictive of RP (P = .001). The area under the ROC curve for 
absolute change and relative change of ipsilateral lung volume were 0.905 and 
0.883, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Ipsilateral lung volume reduction during RT may serve as an early 
predictor of symptomatic RP, independent of traditional dosimetric factors. 
Monitoring volume changes with re-simulation CT could enhance RP risk assessment 
and guide adaptive RT planning.

Autoimmune atrophic gastritis (AAG) is a non-self-limiting immune-mediated 
disorder exerting growing interest. The main autoantigen, the beta subunit of 
the proton pump (H+, K+-ATPase), is localised on the oxyntic mucosa parietal 
cells, limiting the autoimmune inflammatory damage to this stomach compartment. 
Clinical manifestations of AAG may occur late, once corpus-fundus atrophy 
occurs, and are characterised by loss of gastric acidity, impaired iron and/or 
cobalamin malabsorption, and increased risk of gastric type 1 neuroendocrine 
neoplasms and possibly gastric adenocarcinoma. Many topics regarding 
epidemiology, clinical features, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management remain 
to be clarified. AAG patients are frequently misdiagnosed or diagnosed with 
delay. AAG still represents a clinical challenge and a great opportunity for 
advancing our knowledge on gastrointestinal autoimmune diseases and gastric 
precancerous conditions. The timely and correct diagnosis of AAG patients is 
clinically relevant to avoid potentially harmful consequences due to 
micronutrient deficiencies and related anaemia and neoplastic complications. The 
current position paper addresses AAG in adults and reflects the views of the 
Autoimmune gastRitis Italian netwOrk Study grOup (ARIOSO) on its epidemiology, 
clinical features, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management. Improving the 
understanding of AAG would facilitate timely and accurate diagnosis, enhance 
clinical management and patients' quality of life, and reduce the economic and 
social burden of this underrecognized condition.

BACKGROUND: Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) is the standard approach for locally 
advanced rectal cancer (LARC), yet pathological complete response (pCR) is 
achieved in only a subset. Systemic inflammation, nutritional status, and 
sarcopenia influence outcomes, yet integrated predictive models are lacking. We 
aimed to develop clinical, laboratory, and AI-based models to predict 
pathological response.
METHODS: This retrospective study included stage II to III LARC patients treated 
at Ankara Etlik City Hospital (Nov 2022-Dec 2024). Eligible patients received ≥ 
12 weeks of TNT followed by curative surgery. Sarcopenia was assessed using 
CT-based skeletal muscle area at the third lumbar vertebra (L3). C-reactive 
protein/albumin ratio (CAR) and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) were 
used to assess inflammatory and nutritional status. Composite scores (CINR-pCR, 
CINR-Ryan) were calculated using z-transformed CAR and SII weighted by 
regression coefficients. Outcomes included pCR and good pathological response, 
defined as tumor regression grade (TRG) 0 to 1 per the modified Ryan grading 
system. Logistic regression and Random Forest (RF) models were used.
CLINICALTRIALS: gov: NCT07049627.
RESULTS: Among 136 patients, 93 met the inclusion criteria. pCR and TRG 0 to 1 
was achieved in 20 (21.5%) and 43 (46.2%) patients, respectively. Independent 
predictors of pCR included absence of post-TNT sarcopenia (OR 0.30, 95% CI, 
0.09-0.95, P = .007), low CAR (OR 0.14, 95% CI, 0.03-0.70, P = .008), low SII 
(OR 0.28, 95% CI, 0.08-0.96, P = .042), low LDH (OR 0.10, 95% CI, 0.02-0.70, P = 
.020), and metformin use (OR 2.52, 95% CI, 1.40-3.78, P = .031). For TRG 0 to 1, 
significant predictors included low CAR (OR 0.42, 95% CI, 0.23-0.76, P = .005), 
low SII (OR 0.13, 95% CI, 0.03-0.56, P = .006), absence of ≥ 10% weight loss (OR 
0.12, 95% CI, 0.02-0.66, P = .016), absence of post-TNT sarcopenia (OR 0.18, 95% 
CI, 0.05-0.70, P = .014), and shorter RT-to-surgery interval (OR 3.14, 95% CI, 
1.17-6.43, P = .004). CINR scores showed strong predictive value (AUCs: 0.868 
and 0.846), and RF models showed excellent performance (AUCs: 0.933 and 0.910, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory, nutritional, and sarcopenia-based markers, including 
CINR scores and AI models, accurately predict pathological response in LARC. 
Importantly, the ROC-derived cut-off values (CINR-pCR: 1.58; CINR-Ryan: 0.45) 
stratified patients into low- and high-risk groups, supporting clinical 
decision-making in organ-preservation strategies and surgical timing. 
Prospective multicenter validation is warranted.

BV + AVD is increasingly used for frontline treatment of stage III/IV cHL. Young 
adults and adults (Ya&A) were the most common patients treated with BV + AVD in 
clinical trials but have not been studied in non-trial settings. We conducted a 
real-life study in secondary and tertiary cancer centers to evaluate the PFS in 
18-59 years aged patients who were scheduled to receive six BV + AVD for newly 
diagnosed advanced stage cHL. This is the largest cohort of Ya&A reported to 
date including 150 patients from four clinical institutions in Southern Italy, 
all of which employed structured supportive care programs for HL. Fifty patients 
(30%) had at least one ECHELON-1 ineligibility criterion, including 
comorbidities and/or adverse performance status. All 150 patients underwent 
BV + AVD with a median relative dose intensity of 100% (dose reduction and/or 
discontinuation ≥ 15%, in 11% of them). At end-of-treatment (EoT) FDG-PET, 93% 
(140/147) of patients (three did not undergo EoT FDG-PET due to early grade 5 
toxicity) achieved a complete response (95% CI, 88.1-96.8). Altogether, four 
patients (2.7%) received consolidation radiotherapy of residual nodal masses 
with a Deauville score of 4. Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy, cardiotoxicity, 
and febrile neutropenia were reported by 13%, 7%, and 3% of patients, 
respectively. With a 24 month median follow-up, PFS in the entire analyzed 
population was 91% (95% CI, 0.864-0.958). In Ya&A with high-risk cHL, our data 
suggest that a BV-driven strategy (without bleomycin and consolidation 
radiotherapy) is an effective up-front option in oncologic centers specialized 
in HL care, improving the rate of durable complete remission in routine clinical 
practice. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT06857500.

BACKGROUND: Longitudinal data addressing the impact of asthma severity on 
mortality are lacking. We aimed to explore all-cause and cause-specific 
mortality according to asthma severity.
METHODS: The present registry-based cohort study is based on Danish data from 
the NORdic Dataset for aSThmA Research (NORDSTAR) research collaboration 
platform. Adult patients with severe asthma were matched on age and sex to 10 
patients with mild-to-moderate asthma and followed from 2000-2020. Patients with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosed prior to inclusion were 
excluded. Absolute and relative measures of all-cause and cause-specific 
mortality were compared between severe and mild-to-moderate asthma.
RESULTS: We included 11 811 and 118 810 patients with severe and 
mild-to-moderate asthma, respectively. All-cause mortality was significantly 
higher in patients with severe asthma compared to patients with mild-to-moderate 
asthma, both in absolute measures of the cumulative mortality [34% (95% CI: 32, 
35) versus 20% (19, 20), p<0.001] after 20 years of follow-up and in relative 
measures [hazard ratio (HR)=1.99 (1.90, 2.09), p<0.001]. The HR of all-cause 
mortality was attenuated after adjustment for oral corticosteroid (OCS) use 
[HR=1.30 (95% CI: 1.23, 1.37, p<0.001)] and T2 inflammatory markers [HR=1.34 
(1.09, 1.64), p<0.001]. The increased cumulative mortality risk was mainly due 
to respiratory diseases [12.6% (95% CI:11.7, 13.6) versus 3.3% (3.2, 3.5), 
p<0.001] with cancer [7.5% (95% CI: 6.8, 8.3) versus 5.9% (5.7, 6.2), p<0.001 ] 
and cardiovascular diseases [4.7% (95% CI: 4.1, 5.3) versus 3.8% (3.6, 4.0), 
p<0.001] also contributing. Though rare, the relative risk of asthma-related 
deaths was three-fold in severe asthma patients [HR=2.95 (2.08, 4.18), p<0.001].
CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide cohort, severe asthma was associated with a 
significantly higher mortality risk compared to mild-to-moderate asthma. The 
increased risk was primarily driven by respiratory-related deaths, with OCS use 
and T2 inflammation as contributing mortality risk factors.

Survival after childhood cancer has markedly improved over the past decades in 
Asia, leading to a growing number of survivors in the region. However, long-term 
care for these individuals remains a substantial challenge in Asia due to the 
insufficient availability of comprehensive childhood cancer survivorship 
programmes in the region. Many countries and regions of Asia are only beginning 
to acknowledge the significance of post-treatment care. In this third paper in a 
Series on childhood cancer control in Asia, we provide an overview of the 
challenges, disparities, and enablers in the provision of long-term follow-up 
care in Asia. These challenges include deficiencies in comprehensive care models 
that incorporate multidisciplinary approaches and insufficient support for 
school and social reintegration for childhood cancer survivors. To address these 
gaps, collaborative initiatives, such as twinning programmes and regional 
partnerships, can strengthen capacity and improve care delivery for low-income 
and lower-middle-income countries. Specific to some Asian cultures, the use of 
traditional complementary medicine underscores the need for further research to 
evaluate its efficacy in survivors. Leveraging existing networks and fostering 
regional collaboration will be pivotal in advancing equitable and sustainable 
survivorship care across the region.

Pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the most common solid tumors 
in children and remain the leading cause of death amongst childhood cancer 
patients. Despite the intensity of standard cytotoxic regimens, many patients 
with high-grade tumors still experience relapse, at which time they have limited 
curative options. Even the survivors of childhood CNS tumors are often left with 
lifelong complications that negatively impact their quality of life. 
Immunotherapy holds the promise of tailored therapies that can improve outcomes 
and inflict fewer side effects. Early successes across against leukemia and some 
solid tumors have supported this promise, but this is only the infancy of 
targeted immunotherapies against pediatric CNS tumors. While this is a new, 
blossoming field, a robust and coordinated preclinical environment has spurred a 
spectrum of innovative clinical trials that serve as the ground floor for these 
new technologies. Here, we will review the current state of cellular therapy, 
immune checkpoint inhibition, cancer vaccines, and oncolytic viral therapy for 
children with CNS tumors.

Choroid Plexus Tumors (CPT) are rare (2-4% of all pediatric CNS tumors), 
predominantly early childhood brain neoplasms. Due to their rarity and the lack 
of prospective clinical trials, evidence-based treatment guidelines remain 
limited. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the current 
knowledge.\n\nCPTs span a spectrum from mature Choroid Plexus Papillomas (CPP) 
to malignant Choroid Plexus Carcinomas (CPC), with Atypical Choroid Plexus 
Papillomas (aCPP) in between. A significant proportion of CPCs are driven by 
either somatic or germline TP53 mutations (Li-Fraumeni syndrome); however, other 
molecular drivers of CPT tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. CPTs exhibit 
distinct DNA methylation profiles, allowing for classification into clinically 
relevant subgroups. These tumors also display a chromosomal instability 
phenotype, characterized by multiple copy number alterations. \n\nAdvances in 
molecular profiling have revealed that TP53-mutated CPCs have significantly 
worse outcomes. Both retrospective and limited prospective data have shown 
5-year event-free survival rates of 0-25% for TP53-mutant CPCs versus 70-80% for 
TP53-wild-type cases. The extent of surgical resection remains another 
established prognostic factor, while data on the roles of radiation therapy (RT) 
and myeloablative chemotherapy with stem cell rescue are still evolving. 
Preliminary evidence suggests that TP53-mutant patients may be getting less 
benefit from RT, but greater benefit from myeloablative chemotherapy approach 
with avoidance of RT.\n\n The emerging insights into CPC biology and long-term 
outcomes can direct the design of future clinical trials. A new international 
prospective study led by the Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium is in 
development, with the goal to stratify patients by molecular subtype to receive 
different therapy based on individual molecular profiles and patient age.

Chitosan (CS)-based nanoplatforms have emerged as transformative tools in 
photodynamic (PDT) and photothermal (PTT) therapies, offering targeted, 
biocompatible solutions for cancer treatment, wound healing, and antimicrobial 
applications. Recent advancements include the design of multifunctional CS 
nanocomposites that enhance photosensitizer delivery, improve light-triggered 
efficacy, and enable synergistic therapies with reduced side effects. These 
developments address critical challenges in precision medicine, such as drug 
resistance and tissue regeneration, making this area of significant 
interdisciplinary interest. The tunable physicochemical properties of CS, 
combined with its biodegradability and antimicrobial activity, position it as a 
key material for next-generation therapeutic platforms. The future of this field 
depends on optimizing nanoplatform specificity, scalability, and clinical 
translation, with insights from this review guiding the rational design of 
advanced biomaterials. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of 
the recent advancements in CS-based nanomaterials specifically for PTT and PDT, 
while also addressing the associated challenges that hinder their clinical 
application. Moreover, it aims to highlight future perspectives that could 
enhance the effectiveness and applicability of chitosan-based therapies in 
cancer treatment.

Lung cancer is a diagnosis that significantly impacts older adults, with 
improvements in clinical outcomes for all stages of disease seen over recent 
years. However, optimal strategies for screening, diagnosis, treatment, and 
survivorship are not clear given the limited inclusion of older adults in cancer 
clinical trials, and limited data are focused on this population. Comprehensive 
geriatric assessment-based interventions, as well as shared decision-making with 
older adults considering lung cancer treatment, are critical to ensure 
appropriate treatment of each patient.

High expression of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is not limited to 
prostate cancer but can be found in other tumor entities, such as hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), and could possibly be used for theranostic purposes. Our aim 
was to investigate the diagnostic potential of the hepatobiliary excreted 
radiotracer [18F]PSMA-1007 on initial staging of HCC. Methods: This prospective 
clinical study (NCT05547919) included 10 participants (9 men, 1 woman) with 
treatment-naïve, histopathologically proven PSMA-positive HCC. All participants 
underwent [18F]PSMA-1007 PET with unenhanced low-dose CT. All scans were 
analyzed visually and quantitatively. We assessed the SUVmax of the primary 
tumor and the SUVmean of nonaffected liver parenchyma and calculated 
tumor-to-background ratios (i.e., SUVmax HCC/SUVmean liver) for each patient. In 
addition, we assessed possible eligibility for PSMA-directed radiopharmaceutical 
therapy according to the PROMISE criteria. The presence of local lymph nodes and 
distant metastases was noted for [18F]PSMA-1007 PET/CT and compared with the 
results of contrast-enhanced CT of the trunk and MRI of the upper abdomen. 
Possible prognostic implications of PSMA expression on immunohistochemistry and 
on [18F]PSMA-1007 PET/CT were compared with progression-free survival (defined 
as clinical progression, radiographic progression, or death from any cause) 
using Cox regression. Results: [18F]PSMA-1007 PET showed high uptake in 7 of 10 
patients (PROMISE score 2, n = 4; PROMISE score 3, n = 3); mediocre or missing 
uptake was found in 3 participants (PROMISE score 0, n = 1; PROMISE score 1, n = 
2). The median tumor-to-background ratio was 2.7 (interquartile range, 2.65). 
[18F]PSMA-1007 PET did not reveal new distant metastatic lesions compared with 
contrast-enhanced CT. In 1 patient, local lymph node metastases were considered 
PSMA-negative despite high uptake in the primary tumor. Whether assessed ex vivo 
or in vivo, PSMA expression did not correlate with progression-free survival. 
Conclusion: [18F]PSMA-1007 can be used depict untreated HCC and shows high 
uptake relative to background, indicative of excellent image contrast. High 
tracer accumulation in 70% of the participants suggests a possible use for 
PSMA-directed radiopharmaceutical therapy in an end-stage setting. However, PSMA 
expression was not prognostic for outcome, possibly because of the small sample 
size.

The Pelvic Rosetta Classification (PRC) project aimed to develop an 
interdisciplinary, landmark-based pelvic lymph node map for patients with 
prostate cancer to improve communication between imaging specialists and 
urologists. Methods: After an intense development phase, we conducted 3 
evaluation rounds including 19 clinical experts having consensus meetings after 
each evaluation round. Experts contoured lymph node areas (LNA) for 2 patients 
with prostate cancer. Contours were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. 
The PRC was further validated by assignment of 30 prostate-specific membrane 
antigen PET/CT-positive lesions to LNAs. The interrater reliability was 
calculated using Fleiss κ. Based on the final PRC, a complete contour and a 
3-dimensional model were created. Results: Eight pelvic (external iliac, 
cranial/caudal obturator fossa, dorsal internal iliac, vesico-prostatic pedicle, 
mesorectal/perirectal, presacral, preprostatic/retropubic) and 4 extrapelvic 
(common iliac, intercommon, sigmoid, inguinal) LNAs were defined using anatomic 
landmarks which are consistently recognizable on imaging and intraoperatively. 
Strong consensus between experts existed for smaller, well-defined LNAs (e.g., 
preprostatic/retropubic, mesorectal/perirectal LNAs) compared with regions with 
proportionally large borders (e.g., obturator fossa, vesico-prostatic pedicle 
LNAs). Overall, moderate agreement (κ = 0.53) was observed during validation. 
Discrepancies were mostly encountered for lesions adjacent to borders between 
LNAs. The final contour and 3-dimensional model were approved by all experts. 
Conclusion: The PRC project showed fair reproducibility and validity. Further 
external validation is needed to assess its influence on interdisciplinary 
communication and treatment outcomes.

Targeted radionuclide therapy is an emerging potent therapeutic strategy in 
oncology. The cell surface antigen CD44v6 is a potential pan-cancer target for 
radionuclide therapy. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy, 
biodistribution, dosimetry, and safety profile of AKIR001, an antibody targeting 
CD44v6 labeled with 177Lu. Methods: The biodistribution and preclinical 
dosimetry of [177Lu]Lu-AKIR001 were calculated in the highly CD44v6-expressing 
A431 murine xenograft model, with subsequent extrapolation to predict human 
dosimetry. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated across 3 xenograft models, 2 with 
high and 1 with moderate levels of CD44v6, using multiple dosing levels, 
fractionation regimens, and combinations with cisplatin. Preclinical toxicology 
was evaluated in a cross-reactive rabbit model and complemented by a PET imaging 
study using 68Ga-labeled AKIR001 in a cynomolgus macaque. Results: 
Biodistribution studies confirmed the high and selective tumor uptake of 
[177Lu]Lu-AKIR001, resulting in favorable dosimetry predictions for clinical 
application. Therapeutic evaluations demonstrated significant dose-dependent 
efficacy in all tested xenograft models, with fractionated dosing (2 doses) 
resulting in complete tumor regression in 80% of the animals in a radioresistant 
xenograft model. Biodistribution in rabbits demonstrated low uptake in normal 
tissues, and a good-laboratory-practice study using an excessive dose of AKIR001 
was well tolerated, with no signs of adverse effects. PET imaging in a 
cynomolgus macaque corroborated these findings. Conclusion: Collectively, these 
data strongly support the therapeutic efficacy, safety, and dosimetry of 
[177Lu]Lu-AKIR001, justifying its advancement into clinical trials. A phase 1 
clinical trial of [177Lu]Lu-AKIR001for CD44v6-positive solid cancers 
(NCT06639191) is currently recruiting patients.

Continuation of effective and well-tolerated systemic treatment is often 
performed in care for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Likewise, 
continued administration of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA radiopharmaceutical therapy beyond 
the approved number of cycles holds promising potential to enhance therapeutic 
efficacy. Rechallenge therapy involves readministration of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA cycles 
after a break, whereas extended therapy continues treatment beyond the standard 
6 cycles without interruption. Both approaches aim to improve disease control 
and prolong survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer. However, practices vary: some clinicians continue treatment in patients 
with early favorable responses, whereas others recommend pausing therapy after 
significant prostate-specific antigen declines, even after a few cycles. In this 
narrative review, we show that safety profiles for continued [177Lu]Lu-PSMA 
radiopharmaceutical therapy are generally favorable, and most adverse events are 
mild to moderate in severity. Hematotoxicity, particularly anemia and 
thrombocytopenia, is the most significant concern, with few patients 
experiencing high-grade adverse events. In addition, cumulative irradiation, 
particularly during extended therapy, necessitates careful monitoring of 
hematologic and renal function. Biochemical responses to rechallenge and 
extended [177Lu]Lu-PSMA therapy are promising, with at least 50% reductions in 
prostate-specific antigen levels observed in a significant proportion of highly 
selected patients. Moreover, survival outcomes are encouraging, showing the 
extension of overall and progression-free survival beyond the known data for 
standard therapy. Despite these advances, challenges remain in optimizing 
patient selection, managing cumulative toxicities, and harmonizing treatment 
protocols. In addition, variability in trial designs, influenced by 
international regulatory differences, limits the current evidence and 
necessitates consideration of each treatment approach within its regulatory 
context. Prospective studies are needed to refine therapeutic strategies, 
implement consistent clinical and imaging response criteria, and identify 
predictive biomarkers to improve both efficacy and safety.

metastases: a retrospective, population-based, propensity score-matched study.

BACKGROUND: The benefits and optimal sequencing of radiation therapy (RT) for 
colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM) remain unclear. Therefore, using a 
large population-based dataset, this retrospective study aimed to evaluate the 
impact of RT on overall survival (OS) and determine its optimal timing. 
Furthermore, a nomogram was developed to predict OS in CRLM patients receiving 
RT.
METHODS: This population-based retrospective cohort study used data from the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database, including 5141 patients 
diagnosed with CRLM between 2010 and 2019. OS rates were conducted using 
Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. Propensity score matching (PSM) was 
employed to reduce baseline confounding between the RT and non-RT groups. 
Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify 
independent prognostic factors for OS in CRLM patients receiving RT. A nomogram 
for predicting OS was constructed using R software.
RESULTS: After PSM, 536 patients were included in both the RT and non-RT groups. 
The mean OS time was 26 months in the RT group and 22 months in the non-RT 
group, with a statistically significant difference confirmed by the log-rank 
test (p<0.001). Cox regression analysis identified RT as an independent 
protective factor for OS (HR=0.55, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.73). Subgroup analysis based 
on RT timing revealed that the combined preoperative and postoperative RT group 
had the highest OS, followed by the preoperative RT group, and then the 
postoperative RT group. Additionally, chemotherapy, brain, bone and other site 
metastases, and distant lymph node metastases were identified as independent 
factors affecting OS in CRLM patients receiving RT. The nomogram exhibited 
moderate discriminative performance in predicting OS, with Area Under the ROC 
Curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) (AUC) values of 0.634 and 0.637 
in the training and validation sets, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: RT, particularly when administered in a combined preoperative and 
postoperative approach, is associated with long-term survival benefits in CRLM 
patients. The constructed nomogram, while demonstrating moderate predictive 
accuracy, serves as an initial tool for individualised OS estimation. These 
hypothesis-generating findings highlight the potential value of RT and warrant 
further validation through larger, prospective studies to develop more robust 
predictive models for personalised treatment strategies.

OBJECTIVE: To construct a data-driven composite from (a subset of) currently 
used quality indicators for oesophagogastric cancer surgery and to evaluate 
whether this approach enhances the reliability of between-hospital comparisons 
on outcome relative to the expert-driven composite indicator 'textbook outcome 
(TO)'.
DESIGN: In this retrospective cohort study, we applied Item Response Theory 
(IRT) to construct a data-driven continuous composite indicator reflecting a 
single latent variable-the quality of surgical care-and estimated latent 
variable scores for all individual patients. Reliability was compared between 
the expert-driven (TO) and data-driven (IRT) composite indicators.
SETTING: All Dutch hospitals providing oesophagogastric cancer surgery.
PARTICIPANTS: All patients who underwent oesophagectomy (n=3588) or gastrectomy 
(n=1782) between 2018 and 2022 as registered in the Dutch Upper GI Cancer Audit 
(DUCA).
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We evaluated the reliability of 
between-hospital comparisons using 'rankability', which quantifies the 
proportion of observed variation in indicator scores between hospitals not 
attributable to chance.
RESULTS: Seven out of 15 quality indicators were included in the IRT composite 
indicator. Most of the patients were assigned the artificial maximum of the 
continuous quality score (ie, ceiling effect), resulting in similar average 
hospital scores. Relative to TO, rankability increased when using the IRT 
composite for oesophagectomy (57% vs 41%) but declined for gastrectomy (38% vs 
47%).
CONCLUSIONS: The selected seven quality indicators for oesophageal and gastric 
cancer surgery represent a single latent variable but are not yet optimal for 
differentiating surgical care quality due to ceiling effects. Despite using 
fewer indicators, the continuous IRT score showed a promising increase in 
rankability for oesophagectomy, suggesting that data-driven composite indicators 
may enhance hospital benchmarking reliability.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to explore decision making among caregivers of 
children with cancer in Pakistan, one of the largest lower middle-income 
countries in the world.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey study SETTING: This study was conducted in 
Pakistan at Indus Hospital and Health Network in Karachi and Children's Hospital 
of Lahore. Children's Hospital of Lahore is a public sector hospital, and Indus 
Hospital has a foundation-based funding structure. Both are larger tertiary care 
centers. Over 2,500 new patients are seen at these centers annually, this 
accounts for almost 50% of all children with cancer in Pakistan PARTICIPANTS: 
Eligible participants included bedside caregivers, defined as a parent or family 
member involved in communication with the medical team, of children with cancer 
(<19 years of age) diagnosed within the past 8 weeks, with plans to receive 
chemotherapy, radiation or surgery.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures included 
caregiver priorities and experiences related to communication including 
decision-making role, involvement of the paediatric patient and decisional 
regret.
RESULTS: Participants included 200 caregivers of children<1-16 years old with a 
range of cancer diagnoses; 83% were parents and 60.5% were female. Most 
caregivers shared (46.5%) or completely deferred (43.5%) cancer-related decision 
making to other family members. Of the 10% of respondents primarily responsible 
for decisions related to their child's cancer, 70% were male. While 68% of 
caregivers preferred shared decision making with the child's oncologist, only 
65% experienced decision making in the role they preferred. Caregivers expressed 
a range of preferences regarding child involvement; however, 70% said nobody 
talked to their child about cancer. Few caregivers (17%) endorsed regret.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study highlight the importance of exploring 
preferences for decision making and empowering bedside caregivers while 
respecting cultural norms. In the Pakistani context, it may be specifically 
important to consider gender roles and the inclusion of extended family members. 
Future work should investigate paediatric patient involvement in diverse 
settings.

INTRODUCTION: Approximately 3-5% of patients with endometrial cancer (EC) are 
diagnosed under the age of 40 years, with 70% of these individuals being 
nulliparous. Consequently, fertility-sparing treatment for eligible young 
patients with endometrial lesions is increasingly being accepted. Obesity is a 
well-known factor closely associated with the incidence and prognosis of 
endometrial lesions. As obesity rates rise, weight loss interventions become 
particularly important in the treatment of these patients. Tirzepatide is 
currently the most effective glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist for weight 
control. This trial aims to explore the synergistic effects and safety of 
tirzepatide combined with standard fertility-preserving treatment for 
endometrial lesions.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This single-arm, phase II clinical trial aims to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety profile of tirzepatide as an adjunctive therapy to 
standard fertility-sparing treatment in obese or overweight patients with 
atypical hyperplasia (AH) or EC. The study will enrol a total of 45 patients, 
each receiving a combination of standard fertility-sparing treatment for EC and 
AH alongside tirzepatide. The primary outcomes include the reversal rate and 
time to remission (in months) of endometrial lesions, which are determined 
through endometrial pathology sampling every 3 months, as well as the percentage 
of weight reduction. Secondary objectives include evaluating changes in body 
morphology and composition, alterations in metabolic parameters during the 
study, as well as reproductive outcomes and the rate of tumour recurrence during 
follow-up.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has received approval from the Ethics 
Committee of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (I-25PJ1055). Written 
informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The trial results will 
be disseminated through peer-reviewed medical journals and presented at an 
academic conference.

OBJECTIVES: To conduct a synthesis of existing empirical and grey literature to 
identify the contexts and mechanisms that enable the adoption, offer, uptake and 
return of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) in the primary care pathway in 
England, UK, for patients with signs or symptoms of suspected colorectal cancer 
(CRC). From this, develop a theory about how specific programme activities lead 
to certain outcomes.
DESIGN: A realist synthesis.
DATA SOURCES: Medline (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), Scopus (Elsevier) 
and grey literature sources until end of July 2023.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING EVIDENCE: The purpose of the work was to 
determine how different factors interact within a health system to optimise the 
approach to implementing and using symptomatic FIT (sFIT) in clinical practice 
for patient benefit. The criteria used to bound the scope of the synthesis 
included date (published between 2017 and July 2023), exposure of interest (sFIT 
in the primary care pathway for patients with signs or symptoms of suspected 
CRC), geographic location of study (countries that make up the UK), language 
(English) and participants (adults). Any study design and type of publication 
was considered.Given the recognised lack of literature on the implementation of 
sFIT, it was crucial to include insights from grey literature. To do this, key 
national groups and organisations-involved or related to this subject-were 
methodically identified and appropriate papers and reports identified.
ANALYSIS: A thematic approach was used to identify relevant data in included 
records and allow realist insights to be obtained. Inductive and deductive 
coding enabled detection of key data. Arguments were generated and developed 
into context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOCs). Iteratively, an initial 
list of 38 CMOCs was refined to 14 themes and 19 CMOCs. These were then 
structured to create a multifaceted, multilevel realist synthesis programme 
theory.
RESULTS: Systematic searching led to the full appraisal of 99 records to 
determine suitability of each to confirm, refute or help develop theory. Studies 
were assessed for rigour and relevance to inform selection. The process resulted 
in 45 records being chosen for inclusion, of which 28 were from database 
searches and 17 from grey literature sources.The key contexts and mechanisms 
that help optimise adoption, offer, uptake and return of sFIT have been 
elucidated (although partially). These can be broadly summarised into the 10 
'Cs': creating a compelling Case and Conditions for change, reaching Consensus 
through Collaborative working, fostering a Culture that values Clinical 
judgement, building Confidence by developing Capabilities and, finally, ensuring 
Clarity and Coherence of both practical processes and safety netting procedures.
CONCLUSIONS: Fundamentally, optimising the adoption, offer, uptake and return of 
sFIT in primary care for patients with signs or symptoms of suspected CRC is 
predicated on developing the acceptability of this initiative to every 
stakeholder at every level within a health system.

OBJECTIVE: Informal caregivers of patients with terminal cancer can experience 
an emotionally difficult time in the final stages of their caregiving journey 
with implications on their bereavement experience. The current study examined 
anxiety and depression among caregivers of terminal cancer patients and 
subsequent bereavement adjustment.
METHOD: Caregivers from the Singapore COMPASS cohort study (N = 192) were 
prospectively followed from 6-month pre- to 6-month post-patient death. 
Multinomial and logistic regression models were performed to examine factors 
associated with anxiety, depression and complicated grief that may be targets 
for intervention.
RESULTS: Rates of anxiety and depression significantly increased closer to 
patient death (Anxiety: 47%-61%; Depression: 31%-42%) before decreasing 6-month 
post-patient death (Anxiety: 21%, Depression: 24%). 16% of caregivers reported 
persistent anxiety and 15% reported persistent depression from 6-month pre- to 
6-month post-patient death, which were associated with the following pre-death 
caregiver factors: poorer physical health and high caregiving burden impacting 
their schedule and health. 33% of caregivers reported sub-threshold/likely 
complicated grief, which was associated with close caregiver-patient 
relationship, caregiver anxiety or depression at pre-patient death and greater 
perceived patient suffering.
CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to identify and support caregivers pre- and post-patient 
death are important to mitigate psychological sequalae.

Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.

Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.

BACKGROUND: U.S. health surveillance data suggests that alcohol consumption is 
similar among cancer survivors and those without a cancer history. However, 
comparisons of the correlates of alcohol consumption between cancer survivors 
and those without a cancer history are lacking.
AIMS: The purpose of this study was to examine correlates of alcohol use, 
particularly cancer-related beliefs, and if correlates differed by cancer 
history.
METHODS: Merged data from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) 
5, cycles 2-4 and HINTS 6 were analyzed to estimate patterns of current drinking 
among US adults with and without a cancer history. Multivariable logistic 
regression models examined associations among cancer history, cancer-related 
beliefs, and drinking. Stratified models by cancer history were also examined.
RESULTS: Cancer history was not associated with current drinking in adjusted 
models (aOR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.82-1.15, p = 0.742). After adjusting for 
demographic, behavioral, socio-economic, and health factors, cancer-related 
beliefs were not associated with current drinking. Correlates of drinking 
differed between adults with and without a cancer history. For example, among 
those without a cancer history, Black compared to White adults had lower odds of 
current drinking (OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.67-0.96, p = 0.017); among cancer 
survivors, no association was found.
CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol use is similar among adults regardless of cancer history; 
yet the correlates of alcohol use differed by cancer history. A better 
understanding of the determinants of alcohol use among cancer survivors is 
needed to inform tailored alcohol reduction interventions.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of an integrative intervention 
combining psychological and physical therapies with pharmacologic treatment for 
postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS), and to assess its impact on pain, anxiety, 
and quality of life in breast cancer patients.
METHODS: In this prospective randomized controlled study, 302 breast cancer 
patients with chronic postoperative pain were assigned to a control group 
(standard pharmacologic treatment) or an experimental group (combined drug, 
psychological, and physical therapies). Key outcomes included NRS scores during 
movement and rest, pain interference, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(HADS), and Breast-Q scores, assessed at T0 (baseline), T1 (end of 
intervention), and T2 (3 months after intervention).
RESULTS: At T2, the experimental group showed significantly lower movement NRS 
scores (p = 0.0143), pain interference scores (p = 0.0488), and anxiety scores 
(p = 0.0001) compared to the control group. Two-way ANOVA revealed significant 
time × group interactions for multiple pain-related outcomes (p < 0.05). Quality 
of life improved over time (p = 0.0026), but no significant between-group 
difference was found.
CONCLUSION: A multimodal integrative intervention combining psychological and 
physical therapies can enhance pain relief and emotional well-being in patients 
with PMPS. This approach supports the application of integrative medicine in 
oncology rehabilitation.

This case report describes two patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) who 
underwent Fontan palliation surgery in their youth and subsequently developed 
Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD) in adulthood. While undergoing routine 
screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), both patients had significantly 
elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein testing and diagnostic radiographic findings 
consistent with early-stage HCC. At the same academic medical centre, both 
patients were treated with localised yttrium-90 (Y90) radioembolisation therapy, 
and neither underwent liver transplantation (LT). After Y90 radioembolisation, 
both patients achieved HCC remission that has sustained at 3 years 
post-treatment. These cases suggest that Y90 radioembolisation may offer 
effective, transplant-free management of HCC in selected FALD patients. Given 
the growing adult FALD population, further studies are needed to guide 
surveillance and identify predictors of response to non-surgical therapies.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) comprises a heterogeneous group of neoplasms with 
variable prognoses. Chromophobe RCC, a relatively uncommon subtype, generally 
follows an indolent clinical course but may occasionally exhibit aggressive or 
metastatic behaviour. This report describes a woman in the mid 60s with a 
history of partial nephrectomy for chromophobe RCC who subsequently developed 
metastatic disease. Systemic treatment with cabozantinib was initiated, 
resulting in dermatological toxicity. Serial imaging over 4 years demonstrated 
progressive metastatic involvement, including hepatic lesions. This account 
underscores the challenges of managing metastatic chromophobe RCC, 
differentiating true recurrence from potential second primary malignancies and 
addressing the adverse effects of targeted therapies such as cabozantinib.

A sexually inactive nulliparous woman in her early 30s presented with persistent 
pain in the left iliac fossa that had lasted for two years, intensifying over 
the past two months. An initial ultrasound suggested the possibility of a left 
adnexal cyst, which prompted treatment with oral contraceptives for months; 
however, her symptoms continued unabated. Subsequent pelvic MRI revealed a 
multiloculated cystic lesion, which was suspected to arise from the cervix. 
After robust counselling and consent, an examination under anaesthesia revealed 
a pedunculated cervical mass, which was excised and later confirmed via 
histopathological analysis as a giant endocervical polyp and hence an 
unnecessary scar abdomen was avoided. This case highlights the diagnostic 
challenges posed by the benign cervical lesions that can mimic adnexal 
pathology, especially when per speculum examination cannot be done, and it 
emphasises the critical need for correlation between imaging results, clinical 
evaluations and operative findings to avoid diagnostic delay and unwarranted 
radical surgeries.

BACKGROUND: Little data exists on critical relationships for caregivers of 
patients with brain tumors, or how their social context impacts caregiver 
well-being.
AIMS: Our goal was to describe and categorize the critical relationships 
reported by caregivers of patients with brain tumors, and to assess the 
association of categories of critical social relationships with caregiver 
reports of anxiety, depression, and burden.
METHODS: We analyzed baseline self-report data collected from neuro-oncology 
caregivers enrolled in a supportive care trial. Data included demographics, 
presence of critical relationships-a confidante or person contributing stress, 
anxiety, depression, and burden. Critical relationships categories were 
operationalized as: positive (confidant, no stressful person), negative (no 
confidant, stressful person), neutral (no confidant nor stressful person), and 
ambivalent (confidant and stressful person). Descriptive statistics were 
calculated. One-way ANOVAs assessed differences between relationship category 
groups on caregiver reports of anxiety, depression, and burden.
RESULTS: Data from 119 caregivers were analyzed. Caregivers had a mean age of 
57 years (SD = 15), were mostly non-Hispanic White (92%), female (70%), spouses 
(52%) of patients with grade 4 tumors (69%). Most caregivers were categorized as 
having positive (53%) or ambivalent (30%) critical relationships. Significant 
differences between relationship categories were seen in anxiety, depression, 
and burden (ps < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Although most caregivers of people with brain tumors have 
confidants, many also identify people who contribute stress. The presence of 
stressful individuals can negatively impact caregiver well-being in a way that 
is not counterbalanced by the co-presence of a confidant. Future work should 
focus on helping caregivers manage stressful relationships.

BACKGROUND: The 7-Dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7), a critical enzyme 
catalyzing the final step of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, has gained 
attention for its potential role in tumorigenesis. This study systematically 
investigated the association between DHCR7 expression and oncogenic processes 
across multiple cancer types.
METHODS: Multi-omics data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repositories. DHCR7 expression patterns were 
analyzed using Oncomine, TIMER, and GEPIA platforms. Prognostic significance was 
assessed via Kaplan-Meier plotter and GEPIA. Tumor stage correlations and 
immune/molecular subtype associations were evaluated using TISIDB. SangerBox 
facilitated analysis of DHCR7's associations with immune checkpoint (ICP) 
molecules, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), 
mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH), neoantigen load, and immune cell 
infiltration.
RESULTS: DHCR7 exhibited significant overexpression in most malignancies, 
correlating with advanced tumor stage (p < 0.05), metastatic progression, and 
reduced overall survival (HR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.18-1.52). Strong associations 
emerged between DHCR7 expression and critical immunomodulatory parameters: 
positive correlations with ICPs (PD-L1: r = 0.62, CTLA4: r = 0.58). Significant 
links to TMB (p = 2.1e-5), MSI (p = 4.3e-4), and MATH (p = 7.8e-3). Distinct 
immune infiltration patterns, particularly in bladder carcinoma (BLCA), renal 
clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), and prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). Co-expression 
network analysis revealed DHCR7's involvement in immune response regulation 
(GO:0002764, FDR = 0.003), leukocyte differentiation (GO:0002521, FDR = 0.012), 
and angiogenesis (GO:0001525, FDR = 0.018).
CONCLUSIONS: These pan-cancer analyses identify DHCR7 as a multifaceted 
biomarker with dual prognostic and immunotherapeutic relevance. Its involvement 
in tumor immune microenvironment modulation suggests potential as a therapeutic 
target.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate real-world rates of radiographic response and surgery in 
patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy for stage II to III NSCLC.
METHODS: We evaluated a prospectively maintained single-institution database of 
patients of stage II to III NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy 
from January 2022 to July 2024. Rates of radiographic response, surgery, and 
reasons for abandoning surgery were recorded. Toxicity was graded according to 
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events for systemic treatment and 
the Clavien-Dindo Scale for surgery.
RESULTS: Overall, 1243 patients were screened: 323 had stage II-III NSCLC that 
could be treated with curative intent, of whom 111 were considered eligible for 
surgery and 36 were treated with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, which will 
reflect the remainder of this report. The overall response rate (ORR) was 53% 
and median radiographic change in the sum of tumor diameter was -34% (IQR -44 to 
-11). In patients with PD-L1 ≥50%, the ORR was 76%. Most patients had evidence 
of radiographic downstaging after neoadjuvant treatment. The rate of surgical 
intervention was 58% (n=21). No patient thought to require a pneumonectomy 
before neoadjuvant therapy underwent surgery. Pathologic complete response rate 
was seen in 5 of the 21 patients (24%). There were 42 adverse events from 
chemoimmunotherapy and 19 from surgery, of which 12% and 11% were grade 3 or 
higher, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: At a tertiary care center, the rate of surgical intervention after 
neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy was 58%. These results require further validation 
in additional external cohorts and highlight the need for optimal patient 
selection to ensure the use of curative surgery.

Minimally invasive, maximum impact: advances in the application of colonic 
stents.

Koutroumpakis F(1), Coronel E.

Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Malignant colorectal obstruction (MCO) is a common and 
life-threatening presentation of colorectal cancer, traditionally managed with 
emergency surgery associated with high morbidity and high stoma rates. 
Self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) have emerged as an important alternative for 
both palliation and as a bridge to curative resection. This review summarizes 
recent advances in indications, technical aspects, and emerging applications of 
colonic stenting, highlighting its role in modern multidisciplinary care.
RECENT FINDINGS: Current evidence supports the use of SEMS as one of the 
first-line palliative approaches in selected patients, providing rapid symptom 
relief and reducing the need for permanent stomas. In carefully selected 
patients, colonic SEMS can convert urgent high-risk operations into planned 
resections, facilitating minimally invasive approaches, though concerns remain 
regarding perforation risk and long-term oncologic outcomes. Increasing operator 
expertise, device innovation, and technical advances continue to improve safety 
and success rates. Beyond malignancy, expanding applications include refractory 
benign strictures, diverticular obstruction, and the use of lumen-apposing metal 
stents (LAMS) in inflammatory bowel disease and anastomotic complications.
SUMMARY: Colonic stenting has emerged as a valuable alternative to surgery for 
the management of MCO and is being investigated in select benign conditions, 
though broader adoption requires further evidence. Future research should refine 
patient selection, compare stenting with surgical alternatives, and clarify 
long-term outcomes.

Between Prometheus and Thanatos: Reflections on Intracardiac Injection Models 
for Metastasis in Mice.

Berce C(1).

Author information:
(1)Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office, Animal Health and Welfare 
Division, Bern, Switzerland.

Intracardiac injection is a commonly used method to establish experimental 
metastases in mice, particularly in models of breast and prostate cancer. This 
technique enables rapid dissemination of tumor cells to the skeleton and brain 
but carries significant animal welfare concerns due to high rates of morbidity, 
including paralysis, weight loss, and multiorgan failure. This narrative review 
evaluates the welfare implications of the intracardiac model, synthesizing data 
from preclinical studies. Alternative techniques, such as intratibial, caudal 
artery, intracarotid, and intracranial injection, are compared in terms of 
procedural refinement, disease localization, survival time, and humane 
endpoints. These methods offer improvements in reproducibility and welfare while 
maintaining relevance to metastasis research. We discuss how these refinements 
can reduce animal burden and improve model selection in line with the 3Rs 
(Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement).

BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggested inflammation and coagulation were 
associated with cancer prognosis.
PURPOSE: The purpose was to measure the association between the combining 
inflammation and coagulation (CIC) index and the prognosis oral squamous cell 
carcinoma (OSCC) patients, and to construct a nomogram to estimate the survival 
estimation capability of CIC index on the overall survival (OS).
STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, AND SAMPLE: A retrospective cohort study was performed at 
the Beijing Stomatological Hospital, Capital Medical University, including OSCC 
patients treated between 2017 and 2019 who underwent at least 5-year follow-up. 
Patients with history of radiotherapy/recurrence, other malignancies, 
preoperative infection/hematopoietic diseases, or unmet surgical indications 
were excluded.
PREDICTOR VARIABLE: The predictor variable was the CIC index, calculated by 
multiplying the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio by fibrinogen level before 
treatment.
MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE: The primary outcome variable was 3-year and 5-year OS. 
Secondary outcome variable was disease recurrence during the follow-up period.
COVARIATES: Covariates included age, sex, TNM stage, smoking and drinking 
history, postoperative radiotherapy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status, flap repair and oral cavity sites.
ANALYSES: All subjects were divided into the training cohort and the validation 
cohort. The training cohort was used to perform univariate and multivariate Cox 
regression analyses, and constructed the nomogram. The validation cohort was 
used to verify the survival estimation ability of the nomogram through area 
under the receiver operating curve.
RESULTS: The sample included 160 subjects, the mean ± SD of age was 58 ± 10.92 
years and 84 (52.5%) was males. The median (interquartile range) for follow-up 
was 62 (35 to 75) months. Multivariate Cox regression model showed CIC (hazard 
ratio (HR):3.19, P < .05, 95% CI: 1.43 to 7.12) and TNM stage (HR: 1.86, P < 
.01,95% CI: 1.36 to 2.54) were associated the OS of OSCC. Additionally, CIC was 
associated with OSCC recurrence (HR: 2.38, P < .05, 95% CI: 1.17 to 4.83). The 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value for OS in the 
training and validation cohorts were 0.75 and 0.80, respectively, indicating 
excellent discriminatory ability. Calibration curves confirmed the nomogram's 
accuracy, and decision curve analysis showed good clinical applicability of the 
nomogram.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: CIC is a promising OSCC prognostic index, and the 
nomogram may assist physicians with individualized treatment to improve patient 
survival in the future.

Nowadays, cancer researches widely employed organoids as research model. 
Organoids provide a realistic applicate scene but how to real-time detect and 
quantified the organoid status is still a bottleneck. To bridge this knowledge 
gap, we developed an all-in-one microfluidic platform that, for the first time, 
seamlessly integrates a vascularized tumor organoids-on-a-chip model (VOoC) with 
a real-time ELISA detection module for advanced tumor research and point of care 
testing (POCT). The platform features a unique integration of two cutting-edge 
technologies: (1) VOoC consists of a perfusable self-forming vessel network 
throughout the tumor organoid, emulates in vivo tumor angiogenesis, and (2) a 
real-time microfluidic diagnostic chip equipped with ELISA for simultaneously 
monitoring of tumor biomarker expression levels. We demonstrated the platform's 
capabilities using cervical cancer organoids and evaluated the drug efficacy of 
cisplatin and bevacizumab. This coupled system enables simultaneous tumor 
microenvironment modeling and continuous, real-time monitoring of secreted 
biomarkers, a capability not achievable with conventional disconnected systems. 
By combining these two systems, our dual-effect bimodal chip platform holds 
great promise for advancing personalized medicine and cancer research, offering 
a powerful tool for both drug screening and quick diagnosis.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin implicated in the etiology, progression, and 
prognosis of breast cancer, yet its precise mechanisms of action remain elusive. 
We have integrated the latest insights from both basic and clinical research to 
find that in the human body, vitamin D is activated by hydroxylase to form the 
active form 1,25(OH)2D. 1,25(OH)2D may stimulate the abundance of 
butyrate-producing bacteria by upregulating their abundance, and butyrate can 
regulate the intestinal microenvironment and modulate the immune system to 
inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer. Notably, our investigations reveal a 
novel role of vitamin D in modulating the gut microbiome, particularly in 
stimulating the production of butyrate and other metabolites, which exhibit 
potent anti-proliferative effects on breast cancer cells. These findings open 
promising avenues for innovative clinical approaches in breast cancer therapy. 
This review delves into the intricate interplay between vitamin D, butyrate, and 
breast cancer, aiming to propose novel therapeutic strategies.

CONTEXT: Pain and fatigue are among the most common and burdensome symptoms 
experienced by patients with advanced serious illness. However, few studies have 
captured their daily fluctuations using standardized, multidimensional tools.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the factors associated with daily pain 
and fatigue severity among patients with advanced serious illness using the 
Palliative Care Outcomes Collaboration (PCOC) framework in a Taiwanese 
palliative care setting.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted at a medical center 
in central Taiwan between July 2021 and September 2023. Patients admitted to the 
palliative care unit underwent daily assessments using validated PCOC 
instruments. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were applied to identify 
factors associated with daily pain and fatigue scores. Covariates included 
demographic factors, co-occurring symptoms, palliative care phase (PCP), 
functional status, and caregiver concerns.
RESULTS: Among 755 patients, fatigue and pain were the highest-scoring symptoms 
on the Symptom Assessment Scale. Pain severity was significantly associated with 
female sex, younger age, unstable clinical phase, sleep disturbance, appetite 
loss, bowel problems, and fatigue. Fatigue severity was linked to 
breathlessness, pain, appetite loss, and functional impairments, particularly in 
toileting and transferring among non-cancer patients. Subgroup analyses revealed 
differential patterns in cancer versus non-cancer populations. Specifically, we 
found that in cancer patients, fatigue was strongly associated with the unstable 
stage (phase 2), while this stage effect was not observed in non-cancer 
patients. Moreover, pain severity in cancer patients was more pronounced in 
females and younger patients, whereas in non-cancer patients, pain severity was 
more strongly linked to functional limitations (e.g., toileting ability) and 
psychosocial issues (e.g., family problems).
CONCLUSION: Using the PCOC framework for standardized patient assessment, we 
found that pain and fatigue are associated and comprehensive assessment is 
important as treatment of one may alleviate the other.

Opioid conversion, also known as opioid rotation or switching, is a critical 
strategy in cancer pain management, necessitated in up to 40% of patients 
undergoing opioid therapy. In 2025, five leading international 
organizations-MASCC, ASCO, AAHPM, HPNA, and NICSO-collaborated to produce the 
first global consensus guideline on opioid conversion in adults with cancer. 
This review provides clinical insights into the guideline's recommendations, 
emphasizing individualized care, safety, and evidence-informed practice. Key 
components include comprehensive pre-conversion assessment, consensus-based 
conversion ratios, and vigilant post-conversion monitoring. The guideline 
challenges traditional dose-reduction protocols and addresses controversial 
areas such as methadone use, transdermal fentanyl conversion, and bidirectional 
asymmetry. Broader considerations include socioeconomic disparities, stigma, 
pharmacogenetics, and geriatric-specific concerns. While the guideline offers a 
robust framework for safer opioid transitions, limitations include reliance on 
heterogeneous data and the need for clinician expertise. Future directions call 
for expanded access, education, and integration of personalized medicine 
approaches to optimize cancer pain management.

CONTEXT: Family caregivers of individuals with advanced cancer face significant 
psychological and practical burdens, yet support for them remains limited.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop and pilot a nurse-led screening and 
response protocol to address unmet support needs of family caregivers in an 
outpatient palliative care clinic.
METHODS: English-speaking adult family caregivers of patients attending an 
Outpatient Palliative Care Clinic in a tertiary cancer centre in Canada were 
recruited. Participants completed repeated needs screenings and engaged in 
follow-up nurse consultations, offering a tailored response. A satisfaction with 
care scale was administered at baseline and six months, and qualitative 
interviews explored participants' experiences.
RESULTS: Of 31 family caregivers enrolled, all completed needs screening and a 
follow-up consultation at least once, and 61% completed both baseline and 
six-month measures. A pre-post analysis demonstrated a statistically significant 
improvement in satisfaction with psychosocial care. In qualitative interviews 
with a subset of 11 participants, family caregivers highlighted the value of 
receiving support independently from the patient, the acknowledgment of their 
needs as caregivers, having guidance to resolve concerns, and the facilitation 
of end-of-life planning.
CONCLUSION: Routine screening and response protocols for family caregivers may 
help facilitate timely and tailored support. Early implementation may enhance 
recruitment and engagement.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this umbrella review is to synthesize pooled prevalence of 
existing evidence on depressive morbidity among informal cancer caregivers.
METHOD: This umbrella review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, 
and the protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251032522). A comprehensive 
search of major databases was performed to identify relevant studies. Predefined 
inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. The corrected covered area (CCA) 
was calculated to assess overlap, and the methodological quality of included 
reviews was evaluated using the AMSTAR 2 tool.
RESULTS: This umbrella review included four systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses, comprising a total of 160 primary studies with 40,605 
participants worldwide. The pooled global prevalence of depression among 
informal caregivers of cancer patients was 38% (95% CI: 28%-48%). However, 
prevalence estimates varied widely, ranging from 4% to 55%, likely due to 
differences in the depression assessment tools used across studies.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: In conclusion, this review reveals a high 
prevalence of depression among informal caregivers of cancer patients a burden 
comparable to or exceeding that observed in other chronic illnesses and global 
crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Integrating routine mental health 
screening using validated tools such as the CES-D or PHQ-9 into oncology care is 
essential. Structured interventions including counseling, psych-education, and 
respite care should be embedded within care pathways. Future research should 
prioritize standardized assessment tools and caregiver-focused strategies to 
enhance comparability and guide best practices. Policymakers must invest in 
caregiver mental health to ensure sustainable and compassionate cancer care 
systems.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In October 2021, France and Belgium launched a joint 
prospective DILI network (Réseau d'Etude Francophone de l'Hépatotoxicité des 
Produits de Santé - REFHEPS), which aims to collect liver toxicity data. Here we 
present the clinical characteristics, outcome, histological features and culprit 
drugs responsible for DILI cases collected from January 2022 to 30 June 2024.
METHODS: Demographics, clinical presentation, histological findings and outcome 
of prospectively recruited DILI cases in the REFHEPS were analyzed. Case 
definition and severity of DILI were established according to the criteria of 
Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) and DILIN 
criteria. Causality was assessed using the Roussel-Uclaf Causality Assessment 
Method (RUCAM) scale.
RESULTS: 322 cases met the inclusion criteria for DILI including 42 cases 
related to paracetamol. The current study focused on the 280 patients with 
idiosyncratic DILI. Our study highlights sex- and age-related differences: 
females were younger (57 vs. 59.7 years, p = 0.047) and more likely to develop 
hepatocellular DILI (60% vs. 45.5%, p = 0.02), while disease severity and 
outcomes were similar across sexes. In patients over 65 years, DILI had a later 
onset, was more cholestatic, and tended to be less symptomatic. A major finding 
is that anti-cancer drugs, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, account 
for most DILI cases (68.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: REFHEPS registry collected 322 cases in 2.5 years. The study of the 
280 idiosyncratic DILI cases shows sex and age-related differences as reported 
in previous registries. The most significant difference compared to older 
registries is the predominance of anticancer drugs causing liver injury, 
demonstrating the emergence of ""new"" side effects associated with the use of 
innovative therapies, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Crateva magna (Lour.) DC., used in traditional 
Indian medicine systems such as Ayurveda and Unani, is known for its 
anti-diabetic, anti-cancer, anti-Alzheimer's, and anti-inflammatory properties. 
Despite extensive ethnomedicinal applications, its therapeutic role in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has not yet been scientifically executed.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This study utilized a systematic approach to examine the 
effects of C. magna on RA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phytoconstituents investigation of C. magna using 
HR-LCMS-QTOF-MS/MS. Followed by a series of in-silico (network pharmacology, 
molecular docking), in-vitro (on TNF-α-induced inflammation on SW982), and 
lastly in-vivo (CFA-induced arthritis model in rats), was adopted to investigate 
the effects of C. magna.
RESULTS: From C. magna, fifteen compounds were tentatively identified. A network 
was constructed in which six active phytocompounds and the top ten potential 
targets were scrutinised. Further, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis were 
performed. The KEGG mapper was used to execute the pathway where C. magna 
exhibits anti-arthritis effects by modulating the TNF signalling pathway. 
Further, Molecular docking revealed that all the compounds exhibit good binding 
affinity towards the target proteins involved in TNF signalling pathways. 
Lastly, the in-vitro and in-vivo findings suggest that C. magna effectively 
alleviates the arthritis symptoms and effectively attributes the downstream 
target genes involved in the TNF signalling pathway.
CONCLUSION: Overall, this study concludes that C. magna potentially alleviates 
RA via downregulating the TNF signalling pathway. This study supports the 
traditional use of C. magna against RA and suggests it is a good therapeutic 
candidate.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Lung cancer is not only the most widespread 
cancer across the globe but also the primary driver of cancer fatalities. 
Tetrastigma hemsleyanum Diels & Gilg (SYQ) is a rare and endemic plant in China. 
It exhibits pharmacological properties including wind-dispelling and 
phlegm-resolving, heat-clearing and detoxifying, anti-inflammatory and 
anti-tumor effects.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The components with anti-lung cancer effect were isolated from 
SYQ, and their anti-lung cancer effect and mechanism were explored through 
network pharmacology, molecular dynamics simulation and in vitro cell 
experiments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Identify the component targets of SYQ through the 
Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform 
(TCMSP), GeneCards, Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), and OMIN databases, and 
intersect them with disease targets. The mechanism of SYQ in the treatment of 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was explored by protein-protein interaction 
network, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
enrichment. Study the interaction forces between the main ingredients and their 
corresponding targets through molecular docking and molecular dynamics 
simulation. Finally, the anti-tumor effect of the core component quercetin was 
verified by in vitro experiments.
RESULTS: There were 132 intersection targets between SYQ components and disease 
targets. Potential targets for SYQ in the therapy of lung cancer include TP53, 
AKT1, CASP3, TNF, IL6, BCL2, and JUN. Qu can inhibit the PI3K/AKT pathway, 
downregulate BCL2 expression, and activate the cleavage of the apoptotic protein 
caspase-3, ultimately triggering apoptosis in H1299 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Compound Qu in SYQ can effectively inhibit the PI3K/AKT pathway, 
regulate the expression levels of BCL2 and CASP3 proteins, and induce apoptosis.

Globally, non-sugar sweeteners (NSSs) are commonly used in foods and beverages 
to enhance sweetness without added calories. NSSs have been the subject of 
numerous in vitro and animal studies to assess their potential carcinogenic risk 
to humans. As a complement to a larger systematic evaluation of the epidemiology 
evidence of NSSs and cancer, here we present a comprehensive review of the 
available experimental evidence from animal and mechanistic studies for the NSSs 
acesulfame-K (Ace-K), advantame, aspartame, cyclamate, neotame, saccharin, 
steviol glycosides, and sucralose within the context of ingredient safety. For 
this evaluation, we focused on genotoxicity, other potential cancer modes of 
action (MoAs), and carcinogenicity. Overall, high-quality studies have not shown 
evidence for carcinogenicity in animal models, except for saccharin, which 
causes bladder tumors in rats via a mechanism not relevant to humans. There is 
also no consistent or compelling evidence for any biologically plausible MoA by 
which any of these NSSs could cause cancer in humans. The results of this 
evaluation are consistent with the results of epidemiology studies, which have 
shown no consistent associations between NSS intake and cancer risk. Taken 
together, the body of available evidence supports previous conclusions by 
authoritative and regulatory bodies that Ace-K, advantame, aspartame, cyclamate, 
neotame, saccharin, steviol glycosides, and sucralose do not pose a genotoxic or 
carcinogenic risk to humans.

BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer (EC) is a significant health concern in France, 
necessitating high-quality surgical care to improve patient outcomes. The 
European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO) established quality 
indicators (QIs) to standardize and improve management.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the applicability of ESGO QIs in a real-world 
setting across 13 centers in France.
METHODS: This retrospective multicenter cohort study included 2,789 patients 
surgically treated for EC from 2001 to 2020. Demographic data, surgical 
techniques, adherence to ESGO QIs and trends over time were analyzed. Key 
indicators analyzed included multidisciplinary team discussions, pre-operative 
imaging adequacy, surgical techniques employed, and molecular classifications.
RESULTS: All patients were discussed in multidisciplinary meetings. Adequate 
preoperative imaging was achieved in 80.63% of cases. Minimally invasive surgery 
was performed in 66.12% of early-stage patients, showing a significant 
year-on-year increase from 12% in 2001 to 85% in 2020. Among obese patients, 
60.78% underwent laparoscopic procedures, with a conversion rate to open surgery 
of 3.57%. Molecular classification results highlighted 35% of patients as low 
risk and 32% as high risk.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that adherence to actual ESGO QIs has 
substantially improved the quality of surgical management for endometrial cancer 
in France, despite some areas requiring further enhancement. A coordinated 
political approach is essential to address existing barriers and ensure 
consistent implementation of these quality standards across all centers, 
ultimately aiming to elevate patient care and outcomes in the French healthcare 
system.

Eupatorin, a naturally occurring polymethoxyflavone found in a variety of 
medicinal plants such as Orthosiphon stamineus, Salvia connivens, and Artemisia 
anomala, has been known for its broad spectrum of pharmacological activities. 
Due to its presence in a variety of botanical and geographic sources, eupatorin 
has pharmacokinetic profiles and bioavailability, that impact its biological 
activity. This study aims to combine and evaluate existing information on 
eupatorin's antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer processes, in 
addition to underlining its pharmacokinetic behaviour and comparative 
performance to other flavonoids and standard treatment drugs. Eupatorin has 
potent antioxidant effects as it modulates mitochondrial NADH-oxidase and 
stabilizes 15-LOX, resulting in reduced oxidative stress. It inhibits 
proinflammatory mediators like NF-κB, COX-2, and IL-6, creating an unfavourable 
environment for tumor growth. In parallel, it shows specific cytotoxicity by 
inhibiting PDIA3, inducing apoptosis, and impairing angiogenic and metastatic 
signaling. While these antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties suggest 
potential preventive roles, such chemopreventive effects remain purely 
hypothetical and are not yet supported by in vivo evidence. By regulating 
oxidative stress, inflammation, and oncogenic signaling pathways, eupatorin acts 
as both a protective and therapeutic agent. This study is designed to provide a 
comprehensive understanding of eupatorin's multifaceted biological potential and 
growing clinical relevance as a lead molecule for future drug development and 
therapeutic applications by combining biochemical, pharmacological, and 
comparative research findings to highlight its translational significance in 
cancer management.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) ranks among the foremost 
causes of cancer-associated mortality globally, with a 5-year survival rate of 
less than 10 %. Ovarian carcinoma immunoreactive antigen domain containing 2 
(OCIAD2), which has been previously implicated in ovarian carcinogenesis, has 
emerged as a potential oncogenic factor. However, its functional role in PDAC 
remains underexplored.
METHODS: To validate the oncogenic role of OCIAD2 in PDAC, we employed a 
combination of multi-omics bioinformatic analyses, clinical specimen 
evaluations, and cellular functional assays. Further investigations were 
conducted to assess mitochondrial morphological dynamics, intracellular redox 
homeostasis, and apoptotic signaling pathways. For mechanistic exploration, we 
integrated transcriptomic profiling, immunoprecipitation-coupled mass 
spectrometry, and systematic protein-protein interaction validation assays. In 
vivo, both subcutaneous xenograft models and orthotopic tumor implantation 
models were utilized to substantiate its tumor-promoting capacities.
RESULTS: OCIAD2 promotes tumor proliferation, migration, invasion, and 
resistance to gemcitabine in PDAC. It suppresses apoptosis by maintaining 
mitochondrial function and redox balance. These effects were associated with the 
activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Notably, OCIAD2 directly interacts with IQ 
motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) via its double helical 
motif, and this binding further promotes PI3K/AKT pathway activation.
CONCLUSION: OCIAD2 drives PDAC progression through binding to IQGAP1, which 
activates PI3K/AKT pathway; this in turn preserves mitochondrial function and 
suppresses apoptosis. Our study identifies OCIAD2 as a critical mediator of 
tumor progression and a potential therapeutic target in PDAC.

Immune evasion is a pivotal hallmark of cancer as mechanisms revolving around 
this subject remain to be fully elucidated. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 
immune evasion plays a critical role in masking the disease from the host immune 
system. The heterogenous nature of this disease further complicates treatment as 
this affects several crucial components involved in immune regulation which 
resulted in AML progression. The tumor microenvironment (TME) could be 
influenced by AML as the bone marrow components could be hijacked. Moreover, AML 
modulates surface marker expression, this complicates treatment such as 
hematopoietic stem cell allograft or CAR T-cell therapy which depends on T-cell 
functionality. Here, we discuss the current development in AML immune landscapes 
which includes current therapies and immune markers which could potentially 
serve as possible targets for development of future therapy. We also suggest 
several prospects by using gene editing technology to improve the efficacy of 
CAR therapy and the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors which could aid in 
hematopoietic stem cell allograft and CAR therapy.

Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are 
fundamental regulators of cancer progression and critical contributors to 
chemotherapy resistance. Tumor cells often exploit the principal UPR pathways; 
PERK, IRE1α, and ATF6 to evade the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy, targeted 
therapies, and immunotherapy. Continuous activation of the UPR remodels cellular 
processes by elevating the anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL-2 and MCL-1, 
improving antioxidant defenses through NRF2, and promoting drug efflux via ABC 
transporters. At the same time, these adaptive responses suppress pro-apoptotic 
factors, including CHOP and FOXO, allowing cancer cells to avoid programmed cell 
death, maintain proliferation, and develop multidrug resistance. Such cellular 
reprogramming contributes to tumor heterogeneity and recurrence, positioning the 
UPR as a key determinant of treatment failure. Therapeutically, targeting 
ERS-UPR signaling presents both opportunities and challenges. Inhibitors of 
PERK, IRE1α, or ATF6 can disrupt tumor-adaptive survival mechanisms, while 
compounds targeting GRP78 impair ER homeostasis and sensitize resistant cells to 
therapy. Alternatively, strategies that intensify ER stress may exceed the 
adaptive capacity of the UPR, selectively inducing apoptosis in refractory 
populations. Nevertheless, the context-dependent roles of UPR pathways and their 
crosstalk with other stress-response networks complicate translation into 
clinical practice, underscoring the importance of precise mechanistic 
understanding and rational combination approaches. By systematically evaluating 
these resistance mechanisms across cancer types, this review emphasizes the 
central role of ERS-UPR in therapy evasion and identifies potential targets for 
intervention. A nuanced understanding of UPR-mediated adaptation is crucial for 
designing effective, targeted strategies to overcome drug resistance and improve 
patient outcomes.

High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HiFUS) combined with cavitation-responsive 
liposomes (IMP301) offers a therapeutic strategy to enhance immunotherapy 
efficacy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This study investigates how 
HIFUS, a non-invasive modality, remodels the tumor microenvironment (TME), 
transforming ""suppressive"" tumors into ""responsive"" ones and improving 
susceptibility to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). We show that HIFUS increases 
vascular permeability and induces immunogenic cell death (ICD), enabling 
localized release of doxorubicin (Dox) from IMP301. In preclinical models, 
treatment improved immune infiltration, with elevated NK cells, CD8 T cells, and 
M1 macrophages, and reduced myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). 
Antigen-specific T cells increased ~3.1-fold (p < 0.0001), and long-lasting 
memory T cells prevented metastasis and recurrence. Notably, targeted Dox 
delivery minimized systemic toxicity, permitting higher dosing with fewer 
adverse effects. In tumor growth studies, the combination of HIFUS and IMP301 
with anti-PD1 achieved complete remission, highlighting potential for durable 
cancer control. Specifically, remission occurred in 4 of 10 mice, with survival 
extended to 50 vs 26 days (p < 0.0001). These findings demonstrate that 
integrating HiFUS with IMP301 effectively modulates the TME and enhances 
checkpoint blockade therapy, supporting its translational potential in TNBC and 
other solid tumors.

BACKGROUND: Low serum Insulin-like Growth Factor I (IGF-I) level is associated 
shorter overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we sought to evaluate whether 
preoperative IGF-I levels may also be associated with OS and recurrence-free 
survival (RFS) in HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy.
METHODS: Patients undergoing hepatectomy for HCC during 2001-2023 were 
identified from a prospectively maintained database at MD Anderson Cancer 
Center. Patients with IGF-I measured within 8 weeks of hepatectomy were 
included. The median level of IGF-I was used as a cutoff to categorize high vs 
low IGF-I levels. The primary endpoint was OS and the secondary endpoint was 
RFS.
RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were included. Median age was 66, and 65% were 
males. Median IGF-I was 87ng/mL. Patients with low IGF-I were more likely to be 
≥65 years old, with history of diabetes, hypertension, and tobacco use, and to 
have multinodular tumors and higher AFP levels. After a median follow-up of 61 
months, no difference in RFS was found between the high and low IGF-I groups. OS 
was significantly longer in patients with high IGF-I compared to patients with 
low IGF-I (5-year OS 80% vs 45%, p=0.027). On multivariable analysis, high IGF-I 
was significantly associated with better OS (HR 0.33, 95%CI 0.12-0.93).
CONCLUSION: Low preoperative levels of IGF-I was a predictor of poor survival 
after liver resection for HCC but did not correlate with recurrence rates. This 
may be related to poor hepatic reserve in patients with low IGF-I.

PURPOSE: This paper aims to evaluate the integration of Cherenkov imaging into 
radiation therapy practices, focusing on its utility in enhancing treatment 
precision, patient safety, and clinical decision-making. The research highlights 
its application in quality and safety verification, breast treatment, dose 
visualization, confirming no radiation to unintended areas, and its broader 
clinical impact.
METHODS: We employed two commercially available Cherenkov imaging systems, 
BeamSite and DoseRT, integrated with Varian and Elekta linear accelerators. The 
methodology involved real-time imaging during radiation therapy sessions for 
various treatments, capturing Cherenkov light with time-gated cameras 
synchronized with radiation pulses. Post-treatment, images were analyzed to 
assess treatment accuracy, dose distribution, and any deviations from the 
intended plan.
RESULTS: Cherenkov imaging consistently provided high-quality imaging that 
allowed for immediate visualization of radiation dose distribution, detecting 
deviations in real-time, and ensuring no radiation was delivered to unintended 
areas. The results will be presented focusing on five main topics: quality and 
patient safety verification, breast treatment applications, treatment 
verification dose visualization, verification of negative dose in areas of 
concern, and observations with clinical impact. It was particularly beneficial 
in complex scenarios like breast cancer treatments and in cases where patient 
positioning was challenging. The technology facilitated immediate treatment 
adjustments, improved patient safety, and offered insights into treatment 
response without adding significant time to the clinical workflow.
CONCLUSIONS: Cherenkov imaging has shown substantial promise in enhancing 
radiation therapy by providing real-time, visual feedback on treatment delivery. 
It complements traditional verification methods by offering continuous 
monitoring, which can lead to fewer treatment errors and better patient 
outcomes. The findings suggest that Cherenkov imaging should be considered for 
broader clinical adoption to elevate the standard of care in radiation oncology, 
although further refinement in image processing and camera positioning could 
enhance its effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: Tyrosine metabolism (TM) plays an important role in the progression 
of cancer, but its role in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is still unclear. This 
study aims to construct TM-related prognostic features for LUAD.
METHODS: Transcriptomes and clinical data of LUAD were collected from public 
databases. A TM-related risk score (TMRS) model was constructed using 42 
TM-related genes (TMRGs). The prognostic value of the model was comprehensively 
analyzed through survival analysis, enrichment analysis, immune assessment, and 
drug sensitivity prediction. The expression of key genes was also verified in 
LUAD cell lines and patient PBMCs.
RESULTS: A 14-gene prognostic model (TMRS) was constructed. TMRS was an 
independent prognostic factor for LUAD. The low TMRS group has a more active 
immune microenvironment and may be more sensitive to immunotherapy. Patients 
with high TMRS may be more sensitive to various chemotherapy drugs. The model 
genes were specifically expressed in different cell types, suggesting that they 
may be involved in metabolic reprogramming and tumor progression.
CONCLUSION: This study establishes a foundation for personalized risk assessment 
and treatment decisions in LUAD, highlighting the prognostic significance of TM.

INTRODUCTION: Malnutrition is a frequent and harmful side effect of anticancer 
therapy, and even though it is known that cancer patients require sufficient 
nutritional support, nutrition is still not one of the first factors considered 
in routine clinical practice. The MOUSEION-012 meta-analysis explored the 
incidence of decreased appetite events among cancer patients receiving 
immunotherapy as monotherapies or in combination with other anticancer agents.
METHODS: The MOUSEION-012 meta-analysis was recorded with PROSPERO n. 
CRD420251004424 and performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA). Proportions were assessed for any 
grade of decreased appetite and for grade ≥ 3 and two separate subgroups of 
meta-analysis were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 36 manuscripts were included, specifically, 23 were 
observational studies and 13 were RCTones. A total of 11233 observations and 
2317 events were recorded and heterogeneity among the studies was high and 
significant (P<0.001; tau2 = 1.23; I2 = 95.3% with a 95%-CI: [94.5%; 96.0%]) in 
Any Grade group. Considering Grade ≥ 3, a total of 11233 observations and 146 
events were registered. The high heterogeneity among studies was significant 
(P<0.001; tau2 = 5.63; I2 = 77% with a 95%-CI: [70.2%; 82.2%]). Considering 
RCTstudies, a total of 15 studies were included, with a total of 10216 
observations (5331 in the experimental group and 4885 in the control group) and 
1920 events. Heterogeneity among the studies was high and significant (P<0.001; 
tau2 = 0.25; I2 = 85.4% with a 95%-CI: [77.4%; 90.6%]) for Any Grade group. 
Considering Grade ≥ 3, a total of 10216 observations (5331 in the experimental 
group and 4885 in the control group) and 124 events were reported. The 
heterogeneity across studies was moderate and significant (P=0.009; tau2 =075; 
I2 = 53.9% with a 95%-CI: [15.5%; 74.8%]).
CONCLUSION: Appetite loss in cancer patients continues to be a significant 
clinical and research concern, and even while we have more options than ever 
before for managing cancer-related appetite loss, several challenges remain 
regarding the best ways to manage this symptom and enhance the quality of life 
for patients who experience it. In fact, appetite loss may be strictly linked to 
cancer cachexia, a multifactorial syndrome characterized by a progressive loss 
of skeletal muscle mass, along with adipose tissue wasting, systemic 
inflammation and other metabolic abnormalities leading to functional impairment.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis is influenced by skeletal muscle 
volume and liver fibrosis. This study investigated the prognostic impact of 
total psoas volume (TPV) and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score on long-term outcomes in 
CRC patients undergoing curative resection.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a prospectively 
maintained database at a single academic institution. Patients who underwent 
curative CRC resection between 2005 and 2018 were included. They were 
categorized into three groups based on TPV and FIB-4 score: Group 1 (high FIB-4 
score and low TPV), Group 2 (all other combinations), and Group 3 (low FIB-4 
score and high TPV). Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier 
curves, Cox proportional hazards models, and time-dependent receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curves.
RESULTS: A total of 689 patients (57% male, mean age 70 years) were analyzed. 
Group 1 had significantly worse 5-year OS compared to other groups. Multivariate 
analysis identified Group 1 as an independent prognostic factor (P < 0.01). 
Prognostic models incorporating TPV and FIB-4 score demonstrated superior 
discriminatory performance (C-index: 0.6452) compared to models using TPV or 
FIB-4 alone. Time-dependent ROC analysis showed that the AUC for TPV+FIB-4 was 
higher than that for TPV or FIB-4 alone after 8 months postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: Low TPV and high FIB-4 score are independent prognostic markers of 
poor long-term outcomes in CRC patients. A prognostic model integrating TPV and 
FIB-4 score provides improved risk stratification.

BACKGROUND: /AIMS: Recent evidence suggests that endogenously-derived 
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) impacts multiple cellular processes, though its role 
in epithelial injury remains understudied. We previously identified the response 
to dsRNA as the most upregulated pathway across two distinct murine models of 
spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM), a critical pre-neoplastic 
transition in the progression to gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to 
define how dysregulation of the dsRNA response within gastric epithelium impacts 
gastric pre-neoplasia.
METHODS: We specifically deleted ADAR1, a central regulator of dsRNA signaling, 
from gastric parietal cells (Adar1ΔPC). Adar1ΔPC and age-matched controls 
stomachs were histologically, transcriptionally, and immunologically profiled. 
The source of dsRNA in Adar1ΔPC gastric epithelium was assessed by dsRNA 
immunoprecipitation and immune-electron microscopy. Finally, to define the 
contributions of IFN signaling, Adar1ΔPC;Ifnar1-/-and Adar1ΔPC;Ifnlr1-/- mice, 
defective in type I and type III IFN signaling, respectively, were 
characterized.
RESULTS: Adar1ΔPC mice spontaneously developed SPEM and gastric dysplasia, in 
the absence of exogenous injury. Our phenotype depended on Mavs, a key dsRNA 
signaling hub, implying that our model of gastric pre-neoplasia was specific to 
dsRNA signaling. Further characterization of this pre-neoplastic environment by 
single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry noted a chronic and sustained 
transcriptional upregulation of the dsRNA response throughout gastric epithelium 
that was independent of adaptive immunity and that depended on both type I and 
type III IFN signaling. Finally, we identified an enrichment of mitochondrial 
dsRNA (mt-dsRNA) within the gastric epithelium of Adar1ΔPC stomachs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our new genetic model implicates ADAR1-mediated dsRNA signaling in 
gastric pre-neoplasia.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast 
cancer, and chemotherapy remains a major component of the standard therapy. 
Although there is an initial response, the tumor will inevitably develop 
resistance to paclitaxel (PTX) treatment. Berberine (BBR) exhibits excellent 
anti-cancer activity in a variety of tumor cells and drug-resistant tumor cells. 
In the in vitro experiments of the study, the effect of BBR on PTX resistance 
was explored through proliferation assay, flow cytometry. The effects of 
combined treatment of BBR and PTX on DNA damage in TNBC cells were evaluated by 
colony formation assay, comet assay and γ-H2AX staining. Western blot and 
immunofluorescence revealed that HSP90 was highly expressed in the tolerant 
strain. BBR promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of HSP90 through the 
ubiquitin-protease system, further inhibits the expression of its client protein 
p-BRCA1 and improves the sensitivity of PTX treatment. Cell lines overexpressing 
hsp90 were constructed and it was found that Hsp90 could reverse the sensitivity 
of BBR to PTX. In addition, a model of transplanted tumors in nude mice was 
constructed to further verify the regulatory effect of BBR on PTX resistance in 
TNBC. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that BBR targets HSP90 to activate 
p-BRCA1-mediated DNA damage, thereby sensitizing non-BRCA-mutated TNBC to PTX. 
These results suggest HSP90 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to circumvent 
chemotherapy resistance and a potential biomarker for predicting TNBC treatment 
response.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has transformed cancer treatment by 
activating the body's immune defenses to combat malignancies, offering 
substantial therapeutic outcomes for patients with advanced cancers. However, 
its efficacy varies considerably across different tumor types and individual 
patients. Recent studies have identified the human microbiome as a pivotal 
regulator of host homeostasis and systemic immunity and also found that it is 
essential for regulating immunotherapy's efficacy. Beyond direct microbial-host 
interactions, microbiota-derived immunomodulatory products, including 
metabolites, extracellular vesicles, and polysaccharides, have been shown to 
profoundly influence tumorigenesis, disease progression, and therapeutic 
responses. These microbial-derived immunomodulatory products can reshape the 
tumor microenvironment (TME) and modulate tumor immunity. Notably, emerging 
therapeutic strategies targeting or utilizing microbial immunomodulators have 
demonstrated promising efficacy in both preclinical and clinical models. This 
review provides a comprehensive overview of current research on 
microbiota-derived immunomodulatory products in cancer immunotherapy, 
highlighting their mechanistic roles and potential as innovative adjuncts in 
future tumor treatment strategies.

Breast cancer is generally regarded as an immunologically cold tumor, 
characterized by limited T cell infiltration and poor responsiveness to immune 
checkpoint inhibitors. Increasing evidence suggests that the human microbiome, 
including both gut and tumor-associated microbial communities, serves as a 
critical regulator of systemic and local antitumor immunity, with potential to 
convert inert tumors into immune-responsive states. Gut microbiota influence 
systemic immune homeostasis through metabolites such as lipids, lactic acid, and 
trimethylamine N-oxide, which modulate T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, 
leukocytes, and stromal components. Tumor-resident microbiota further shape the 
tumor immune microenvironment by regulating CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells, NKT cells, 
Tregs, and macrophages, thereby impacting the efficacy of immune checkpoint 
blockade. Emerging strategies to sensitize cold breast tumors through microbiome 
modulation include dietary phytochemicals, bariatric surgery induced microbial 
shifts, probiotics and postbiotics, polyvalent microbial antigen vaccines, and 
nanotechnology-based platforms. Clinical challenges remain, particularly 
interindividual microbial heterogeneity, safety and regulatory considerations, 
and the need for reliable microbial and immune biomarkers. This review 
summarizes current advances in microbiota-immune interactions in breast cancer 
and discusses opportunities for microbiome-targeted strategies to enhance 
immunotherapy outcomes.

Atherosclerosis and cancer are two of the most prevalent chronic diseases 
worldwide, representing leading causes of morbidity and mortality. These 
conditions share overlapping risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms, 
including persistent inflammation, oxidative stress, immune dysregulation, 
aberrant apoptosis, uncontrolled proliferation, and angiogenesis. In recent 
years, the gut microbiota and its metabolites have emerged as key players in 
these processes. Beyond serving as markers of dysbiosis, microbial-derived 
compounds actively influence host physiology by modulating immune responses, 
inflammatory pathways, and metabolic homeostasis. This review explores the 
shared pathological links between atherosclerosis and cancer through the lens of 
microbial-derived metabolites, with a particular focus on short-chain fatty 
acids and their precursors, lactate and succinate. We discuss the mechanisms by 
which these metabolites influence disease progression -including G 
protein-coupled receptor activation and epigenetic modulation-, and therapeutic 
strategies aimed at modulating these metabolites.

Peroxisomes are essential organelles that maintain cellular redox homeostasis. 
Although alternatively spliced variants of certain peroxisome-related genes have 
been identified, the regulatory mechanisms governing alternative splicing (AS) 
and its functional impact on peroxisomal redox homeostasis remain poorly 
understood. Here, we demonstrate that glucose starvation (GS) induces 
crotonylation of DEAD-box helicase 1 (DDX1), which is regulated by the 
crotonyltransferase general control non-repressed protein 5 (GCN5) and the 
decrotonylase histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). DDX1 crotonylation at the lysine 
490 residue enhances its interaction with heterogeneous nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein K (HNRNPK), which mediates mutually exclusive AS of acyl-CoA 
oxidase 1 (ACOX1). The AS of ACOX1, driven by DDX1 crotonylation and HNRNPK, 
promotes the generation of peroxisomal ROS, thereby enhancing oxidative damage 
and ultimately suppressing colorectal cancer (CRC) cell proliferation. Our 
findings uncover a novel mechanism by which DDX1 crotonylation regulates the AS 
of peroxisome-related genes and mediates peroxisomal redox homeostasis. This 
discovery bridges a critical gap in our understanding of how posttranslational 
modifications (PTMs) of DEAD/DEXD box RNA helicases modulate gene AS and 
identifies a potential therapeutic target for colorectal cancer.

Human tissue samples are a crucial resource for cancer research, offering key 
insights into physiological and pathological processes while enabling 
comprehensive characterization of molecular signatures across cancer subtypes. 
Recent advances in genetic analysis techniques lead to a substantiall expansion 
of specific molecular pathways knowledge. The application of these technologies 
to fresh tissue samples from patients undergoing surgical resection for 
metastatic disease represents a promising approach to gain a deeper 
understanding of the biology of brain metastasis. Brain metastases remain 
particularly challenging due to their poor prognosis and the complex mechanisms 
underlying central nervous system invasion. This study sought to identify 
preoperative factors influencing the research utility of fresh brain metastasis 
tissue samples. A pipeline was established to transfer fresh, surplus tissue 
from surgical resections to research laboratories with histological quality 
assessment. Of the fifty-five fresh specimens collected, thirty-eight (69 %) 
were classified as suitable for further research applications. Statistical 
analysis revealed that only two factors significantly affected sample quality. 
First, the extent of MRI-derived necrosis was significantly higher in unsuitable 
samples (mean 18.0 %) than in suitable samples (mean 8.3 %) (p = 0.0273). 
Second, prior treatment with target-specific therapeutics (TST) was associated 
with a lower proportion of suitable samples (47 %) compared to no prior TST 
(79 %) (p = 0.018). Logistic regression confirmed these variables as significant 
predictors, with MRI-derived necrosis (odds ratio 1.049) and target-specific 
therapy exposure (odds ratio 4.486) independently increasing the likelihood of 
obtaining suboptimal samples. Other parameters, including age, gender, 
metastasis volume, localization, primary cancer site, and other therapeutic 
interventions, showed no significant impact on sample quality. Based on these 
findings, the collection pipeline was modified to include evaluation by 
board-certified neuropathologists before samples are used for research purposes, 
improving the efficiency of translational research utilizing brain metastasis 
tissue.

PURPOSE: Elderly patients with locally advanced cervical squamous cell carcinoma 
(LACSCC) generally have fewer therapeutic choices. Nimotuzumab, as an epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted humanized monoclonal antibody, has low 
toxicity, and shown antitumor efficacy in cervical cancer in preliminary study. 
So we wanted to explore efficacy and safety of nimotuzumab and image-guided 
radiotherapy for elderly patients with LACSCC.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, 
single-arm, and phase II trial. LACSCC patients aged ≥65 years not receiving 
chemotherapy were enrolled. All of the patients received intensity-modulated 
radiotherapy and image-guided brachytherapy. Nimotuzumab was administration of 
200 mg once a week for 6 weeks. Disease-free survival (DFS) is the primary 
endpoint. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), complete response 
rate (CRR), objective response rate (ORR), and safety.
RESULTS: From Nov 2021 to Jan 2023, a total of 118 elder patients with stage 
IB3-IVA were enrolled. The median follow-up was 24 months (95% CI: 21.78, 
25.53). The CRR was 61.86% (95% CI: 0.53, 0.71), ORR was 91.53% (95% CI: 0.85, 
0.96). The 1 year-DFS and 2 year-DFS were 92.42% (95% CI: 85.40, 96.14) and 
84.61% (95% CI: 75.07, 90.72), respectively, the median DFS was 36.99 months 
(95% CI: NA, NA). The 1 year-OS was 96.19% (95% CI: 90.15, 98.55), 2 year-OS was 
88.22% (95% CI: 78.87, 93.60), the median OS was not reached. The most common 
Grade 3 adverse events (AEs) included leukopenia (4/30.77%), neutropenia 
(3/23.08%), lymphopenia (2/15.38%), diarrhea (1/7.69%), and anemia (3/23.08%). 
No drug-related severe AEs or deaths were recorded.
CONCLUSIONS: Among elderly LACSCC patients, nimotuzumab plus image-guided 
radiotherapy and brachytherapy was well tolerated and indicated promising 
clinical survival benefits. The robustness of efficacy and toxicity results 
might provide a novel treatment option for this population.

Noncanonical four-stranded DNA structures known as G-quadruplexes (G4s) play 
crucial roles in gene regulation and have recently been identified as hotspots 
for single-nucleotide variations (SNVs). In the cMyc proto-oncogene promoter, 
the Pu27 G4 element serves as a key transcriptional switch, yet its 
susceptibility to SNVs and the resulting molecular consequences remain unclear. 
Here, we systematically analyze SNVs in the cMyc promoter G4 using the dbSNP 
database and identify 17 mutation sites distributed across its 27-nt sequence, 
indicating a high mutation frequency. Biophysical studies reveal that SNVs in 
loop regions primarily enhance G4 stability by introducing additional hydrogen 
bonds and π-π interactions while maintaining its parallel topology. In contrast, 
SNVs within G-runs destabilize the G4, leading to structural polymorphism, mixed 
topologies, and increased conformational dynamics; certain SNVs induce 
noncanonical G4 architectures such as G-vacancies and bulges. Functional assays 
show that these structural changes differentially modulate transcription from 
the cMyc promoter, with stabilizing SNVs generally suppressing expression and 
destabilizing SNVs producing divergent effects. Overall, our findings establish 
G4s as dynamic sensors of genetic variation and provide a mechanistic framework 
for understanding how non-B DNA motifs contribute to transcriptional 
dysregulation and genome instability in cancer.

Growing evidence indicates that the cellular senescence (CS) plays a crucial 
role in hepatocarcinogenesis. Transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 1 
(TMBIM1) has been shown to inhibit CS. However, the role and mechanism of TMBIM1 
associated CS in hepatocarcinogenesis remains unclear. In our study, TMBIM1 was 
highly expressed in the adjacent tissues of patients with liver cancer and its 
expression of TMBIM1 gradually decreased during hepatocarcinogenesis in a rat 
primary liver cancer model. In a Tmbim1-overexpressed rat model, the occurrence 
of HCC was highly inhibited and overall survival was prolonged. In addition, the 
aggregation of senescent cells promotes the activation of hepatic progenitor 
cells to promote the occurrence of HCC. However, the expression of TMBIM1 is 
negatively correlated with CS. Furthermore, Tmbim1 downregulated the expression 
of Cdkn2a, Cdkn1a and SASP mRNA to inhibit CS. Interestingly, overexpression of 
Tmbim1 and knockdown of Tmbim1 had completely reverse effects on LPS-induced CS. 
Moreover, under the regulation of TMBIM1, the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 was 
inhibited, the TGF-β signaling pathway was blocked by the lysosomal degradation 
of TGF-β type I receptors (TGFBR1) and CS was inhibited. Finally, we 
demonstrated that the interaction between TMBIM1 and Rab9a contributes to 
lysosomal degradation of TGFBR1. Together, these data indicate that TMBIM1 
interacts with Rab9a to promote degradation of TGFBR1 in lysosomes. In turn, the 
CS signaling pathway was blocked and the occurrence of HCC was inhibited.

Lipidomics, a fast-growing area of systems biology, provides an in-depth look at 
lipid species and how they dynamically change in healthy and diseased 
conditions. Lipids are increasingly understood to be bioactive molecules 
regulating inflammation, metabolic homeostasis, and cellular signaling, 
lipidomics has become a potent tool for finding new biomarkers for a wide range 
of clinical diseases and disorders. To identify disease-specific lipid 
signatures and biomarkers across various conditions, such as metabolic disorders 
(e.g., diabetes, obesity), cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases 
(e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's), cancer, and inflammatory disorders. Despite 
significant advancements, routine integration of lipidomics into clinical 
practice is hindered by problems such as inter-laboratory variability, data 
standardization, lack of defined procedures, and insufficient clinical 
validation. In this study, we examined the significance of lipidomics in various 
clinical applications, providing a thorough summary of lipidomic markers that 
have already been investigated and demonstrated their potential. We also discuss 
the importance of lipidomics methodologies and their comparisons, as well as 
lipidomics in biomarker discovery. Challenges in the lipidomic biomarker 
validation process and the translational potential of lipidomics in clinical 
settings are addressed, along with prospects for lipidomics research, which 
helps readers understand the future of lipidomic biomarkers. Ultimately, 
lipidomics-driven biomarker discovery is a revolutionary method that connects 
fundamental lipid research with clinical application. It has encouraging 
significance for risk assessment, early diagnosis, and targeted therapy plans 
for various human diseases and disorders.

Exosomes are potential biomarkers for liquid biopsy. Liquid biopsy is a 
minimally invasive technique that utilizes biofluid samples rather than tissue 
samples for cancer diagnosis. Exosomes are acknowledged as critical small 
extracellular vesicles released by all types of cells, facilitating 
intercellular communication in health and playing a role in various 
physiological and pathological processes by delivering cellular materials such 
as functional proteins, metabolites, and nucleic acids to recipient cells. 
Exosomes significantly contribute to the modulation of the tumor 
microenvironment (TME) through intercellular communication. As key immune 
stromal cells within the TME, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a vital 
role in tumor progression by promoting angiogenesis, metastasis, 
chemoresistance, and immune evasion. Urinary exosomes (uEVs) offer a promising, 
non-invasive approach for the diagnosis and management of urological cancers. 
Their molecular contents provide valuable information for early disease 
detection and monitoring. Urine's accessibility and abundance enhance its 
suitability as a diagnostic fluid; however, challenges such as the lack of 
standardized protocols and exosome heterogeneity hinder clinical translation. 
Advances in microfluidics, biosensors, and AI-driven analytics may help address 
these limitations. Ultimately, standardization and large-scale validation are 
essential for integrating urinary exosome-based assays into precision oncology 
and liquid biopsy frameworks. This review consolidates the knowledge regarding 
exosomes, which holds considerable significance for advancing research into the 
clinical diagnosis of urological cancers.

LacdiNAc (GalNAcβ1 → 4GlcNAc), a disaccharide structure on N- and O-glycans of 
glycoproteins, represents an important form of glycosylation modification. 
Several reviews have summarized the expression and biological significance of 
LacdiNAc glycans in human tumors. However, a comprehensive understanding of 
LacdiNAc glycans remains insufficient. In this review, we summarize the progress 
in research regarding distribution, biosynthesis, recognition and identification 
of LacdiNAc structures on N- and O-glycans in many different organisms, and 
discuss their critical biological functions. Studies have demonstrated that 
LacdiNAc glycans are widely expressed across diverse organisms, with significant 
variations in expression levels among species, organs, and cell types. LacdiNAc 
moieties and their sulfated, sialylated, and/or fucosylated forms can be 
recognized by specific receptors and lectins. The LacdiNAc structures on 
released glycans were mainly identified by MS-based glycomics and NMR. More 
recently, newly developed glycoproteomic methods and associated software have 
further facilitated site-specific and large-scale identification of 
LacdiNAc-containing glycopeptides. Consistent with their differential 
distribution, LacdiNAc glycans are involved in various biological processes, 
including hormone regulation, immune response mediation, cell growth and 
differentiation, as well as cancer development.

Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health diseases, which is 
characterized by functional or structural changes of neurons. Cancer-induced 
depression (CID) can bring more serious medical burden. Exosomes have been 
implicated in cancer progression and depressive disorders; however, their 
specific role in CID remains unclear. To investigate the role of exosomes in 
CID, exosomes derived from 4T1 breast cancer cells were extracted using 
microfluidic chips-based isolation method. Behavioral assessments were performed 
to explore the effects of intranasal exosomal myeloid differentiation factor 88 
(MYD88) on depressive-like behaviors in mice. Additionally, the effects of 
exosomal MYD88 on neuronal structure and function were researched by Golgi 
staining, sholl analysis and electrophysiological recordings. Exosomes from 4T1 
breast cancer cells induced depressive-like symptoms and altered neuronal 
structure and function in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) by upregulating 
MYD88 levels. Conversely, exosomes with reduced MYD88 content did not produce 
these depressive-like symptoms, suggesting a critical role for MYD88 in the 
observed effects. Exosomal MYD88 contributes to the development of breast 
cancer-induced depression. These findings highlight the potential of targeting 
exosomal pathways, particularly MYD88, as a therapeutic strategy for managing 
depression in cancer patients.

Breast cancer (BC) continues to be the most common cancer affecting women 
globally, posing significant therapeutic challenges due to limited therapeutic 
efficacy, non-specific drug targeting, systemic toxicity, and the emergence of 
chemoresistance. These hurdles emphasize the critical need for novel and 
effective treatment strategies. Nanomedicine has revolutionized cancer therapy, 
especially D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS)-based 
nanoparticles (TPGS-NPs), which have emerged as a promising strategy due to 
their enhanced therapeutic potential. TPGS, an amphiphilic derivative of Vitamin 
E, not only enhances the solubility, stability, and bioavailability of 
lipophilic drugs but also exhibits intrinsic anti-BC properties. The 
incorporation of TPGS into NPs significantly enhances their physicochemical 
properties. Further, the engineering of TPGS-NPs with targeting ligands 
significantly improves their specificity towards cancer cells. Also, TPGS-NPs 
show great potential to improve photothermal and photodynamic therapies due to 
their excellent physicochemical properties. Moreover, TPGS-NPs demonstrate an 
excellent ability for gene (plasmid DNA, siRNA, and miRNA) delivery by enhancing 
stability and transfection efficiency. This review explores the multifaceted 
role of TPGS and the role of different TPGS-NPs in circumventing the limitations 
of conventional chemotherapy in BC treatment. Overall, developing TPGS-NPs 
offers a versatile and multifaceted approach to achieve better therapeutic 
outcomes against BC. This article is categorized under: Therapeutic Approaches 
and Drug Discovery > Nanomedicine for Oncologic Disease.

Immunotherapy-based combination approaches have improved treatment efficacy in 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but progressive disease remains a 
challenge. Trilaciclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor approved for 
myelopreservation in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Our 
results demonstrate that trilaciclib has antitumor potential in NSCLC without 
significant toxicity. It reprograms the tumor immune microenvironment by 
primarily increasing antitumor neutrophils and CD8+ T cells. Trilaciclib induces 
tumor cell senescence and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype in a 
cGAS-STING-dependent manner, which further facilitates the infiltration and 
activation of CD177+ neutrophils with anti-tumor properties. These neutrophils 
enhance CD8+ effector T cell activation and promote antitumor immunity. 
Additionally, activated CD8+ T cells recruit and activate neutrophils, forming a 
positive feedback loop. Combining trilaciclib with anti-PD-1 antibodies presents 
a promising strategy for NSCLC treatment.

Growing evidence links poor oral health to an increased esophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma (ESCC) risk, with the oral microbiome recognized as a key contributor. 
However, human-based evidence remains limited. Here, we analyze salivary shotgun 
metagenomic data from 390 ESCC case-control pairs and 16S rRNA sequencing data 
from 206 incident esophageal cancer (EC) case-control pairs. We identify 50 
bacterial species altered in ESCC (e.g., enriched Porphyromonas catoniae and 
depleted Campylobacter rectus) and disruptions in 54 biochemical pathways (e.g., 
inosine 5'-phosphate degradation). These features potentially mediate the 
association between poor oral health and ESCC. Notably, this association is 
stronger among individuals with lower Streptococcus mitis levels, implicating 
pathways related to thiamine salvage and energy metabolism. Consistent findings 
in the validation dataset further support the interplay between the oral 
microbiome and oral health in EC risk. Our results highlight the promise of 
precision-targeted microbial interventions to improve oral health for ESCC 
prevention and management.

INTRODUCTION: While most patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) have 
favorable outcomes, a subset present with high-risk features associated with 
disease recurrence, such as vascular invasion, extrathyroidal extension, 
aggressive histologic variants, or distant metastasis. This study examines 
preoperative clinical factors associated with high-risk PTC tumor 
characteristics predictive of disease recurrence based on the American Thyroid 
Association (ATA) risk stratification system.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 762 patients who underwent thyroidectomy for 
PTC at a tertiary care institution was conducted. Clinical variables analyzed 
included sex, age, body mass index, hypothyroid symptoms, levothyroxine use, 
prior radiation exposure, family history of thyroid cancer, nodule palpability, 
multifocality, nodule size, nodular calcifications, echogenicity, border 
regularity, ""taller-than-wide"" shape, lymph node metastases, and serum 
thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Patients were stratified into 
high/intermediate- and low-risk categories per the ATA risk stratification 
system. Univariate and binary logistic regression assessed associations between 
clinical factors and ATA-defined recurrence risk.
RESULTS: Of 762 patients, 82.3% were female, and 17.7% were male, with a mean 
age of 47.5 y. Based on the ATA stratification, 42.0% were classified as 
high/intermediate risk, and 58.0% were classified as low risk. Several clinical 
characteristics were significantly associated with high/intermediate-risk 
disease: male sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.65, P < 0.05), age <45 y (OR 1.43, P < 
0.05), hypothyroid symptoms (OR 2.31, P < 0.05), nodular coarse calcifications 
(OR 2.01, P < 0.05), nodular microcalcifications (OR 2.71, P < 0.001), 
taller-than-wide nodules (OR 1.64, P < 0.05), and clinically detectable lymph 
node metastases (OR 3.64, P < 0.001). All other variables showed no significant 
association.
CONCLUSIONS: Several preoperative clinical and radiologic features are 
significantly associated with high-risk tumor characteristics predictive of PTC 
recurrence. Early identification of these features may support individualized 
risk stratification and guide surgical decision-making.

INTRODUCTION: The outcomes of reoperative thyroid procedures are not well 
documented. We utilized the Collaborative Endocrine Surgery Quality Improvement 
Program to evaluate the outcomes and complications of reoperative thyroid 
surgery.
METHODS: We identified patients undergoing thyroidectomy or thyroid-related 
procedure (central neck dissection, selective lateral neck dissection, and 
resection of recurrent disease) utilizing the Collaborative Endocrine Surgery 
Quality Improvement Program database (2013-2023). Outcomes were compared between 
patients undergoing first-time total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection 
and those undergoing resection for recurrent thyroid disease in the central 
compartment. In addition, we analyzed outcomes of first-time versus reoperative 
lateral neck dissection for thyroid cancer.
RESULTS: We compared the outcomes of 3617 patients who underwent first-time 
total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection and 1644 who underwent 
reoperative central neck surgery. There was no difference in the rate of 
hematoma or vocal cord dysfunction between the two. However, rates of both 
short- and long-term hypoparathyroidism were significantly higher in patients 
undergoing first-time total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection. 
Short-term hypoparathyroidism occurred in 9% of first-time cases compared to 2% 
of reoperative cases, and long-term hypoparathyroidism occurred in 4% versus 2%, 
respectively (both P < 0.05). Among 640 patients who underwent selective lateral 
neck dissection (533 first-time, 107 reoperative), the rates of hematoma and 
vocal cord dysfunction were not different between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Reoperative thyroid surgery can yield outcomes comparable to 
first-time procedures when performed at high-volume centers. However, total 
thyroidectomy with central neck dissection is associated with a higher risk of 
short- and long-term hypoparathyroidism compared to reoperative central neck 
surgery.

OBJECTIVES: Cancer care in Ethiopia imposes a significant financial burden, with 
high direct costs (eg, treatment and hospital stays) and indirect costs (eg, 
lost productivity). Despite the growing cancer burden, comprehensive data on its 
economic impact and cost-effectiveness remain limited. This systematic review 
assesses the economic burden of cancer care and the cost-effectiveness of 
interventions in Ethiopia, focusing on both adult and pediatric cancers.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the 
Cochrane Library following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies reporting Ethiopian-specific cost data, 
including direct and indirect costs, catastrophic health expenditure, and 
cost-effectiveness, were included. Economic evaluations and observational 
studies covering prevention to palliative care were considered. Cost data were 
standardized to 2019 values using the Campbell and Cochrane Economics Methods 
Group and the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and 
Coordinating-Centre cost converter. Two independent reviewers' extracted data, 
with quality assessment using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation 
Reporting Standards checklist.
RESULTS: Of 656 identified records, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. 
Cancer care costs were substantial, with medications, treatment, and hospital 
stays being the primary cost drivers. Lost productivity further exacerbated the 
burden. Pediatric oncology care and human papillomavirus vaccination were 
consistently cost-effective. Methodological approaches included decision trees, 
Markov models, and cost-effectiveness analyses. Gaps in uncertainty analysis, 
discount rates, and sensitivity analysis were noted.
CONCLUSIONS: Cancer care in Ethiopia remains a financial challenge, but 
cost-effective interventions, such as pediatric oncology programs and human 
papillomavirus vaccination, can mitigate costs. Strengthening financial 
protection mechanisms and conducting more detailed economic evaluations are 
crucial to informing policy and improving cancer care affordability.

INTRODUCTION: Brain and nervous system cancers are the 5th most common cancer 
category in the United States and have a very low survival rate. Spatial 
analysis techniques can be employed to understand the distribution of rates and 
generate hypotheses about etiologies. The purpose of this study is to identify 
geographic patterns, time trends, and sex differences in mortality-incidence 
rate ratios, incidence rates, and mortality rates of brain and nervous system 
cancers.
METHODS: Cancer data were sourced from the CDC Wonder Cancer database, including 
age-adjusted mortality-incidence rate ratios, age-adjusted incidence and 
mortality rates for all age groups and demographics in the United States. MIRR 
data were available from 1999 to 2018 which were split into four, five-year 
aggregated time windows to have adequate case numbers for time trend analyses. 
We further conducted joinpoint regression analysis for 1999-2022 (incidence) and 
1999-2023 (mortality) by state and sex to identify changes in trends over time.
RESULTS: Incidence-mortality rate ratios varied across the United States, with 
the highest ratios from 1999 to 2003, calculated to be around 0.67 for the 
different demographics studied. Since 2004, the mortality rates have remained 
consistent with some variation between states, with little improvement in the 
incidence-mortality rate ratio. From 2014 to 2018, females had significantly 
lower incidence and mortality rates compared to men. The average mortality rate 
for females was 3.7 per 100,000 compared to the mortality rate for males which 
was 5.5 per 100,000. Average incidence showed the same pattern with a rate of 
5.6 per 100,000 in females compared to 7.7 per 100,000 in males. The Northeast 
region of the United States showed the highest incidence and lowest mortality. 
There were 12 states that saw a directional change in incidence, and 14 a 
directional change in mortality during the study window. Females were more 
likely to have a directional change in mortality, and males a directional change 
in incidence trends.
CONCLUSION: Further research should investigate reasons for the sex and state 
differences in brain cancer incidence and mortality rates and how regional 
factors contribute to survival.

Cancer remains a major global health burden; consequently, the development of 
more effective and less toxic treatment options is paramount. DNA nanostructures 
are a promising platform for cancer therapy harnessing the unique properties of 
DNA. They represent an ideal platform for therapeutics, in part because they are 
programmable, biocompatible, and possess unique molecular architectures. 
Structures such as DNA origami, tetrahedra, polyhedra, and dendrimers can serve 
as versatile carriers for chemotherapeutic agents, gene-silencing molecules 
(such as siRNA and ASOs), photosensitizers, and immunomodulatory compounds. DNA 
nanostructures can also enhance traditional chemotherapy and new strategies, 
such as gene therapy, phototherapy (PDT/PTT), and immunotherapy, by delivering 
genetic material, photosensitizers (PDT or PTT), or immune-response activators 
(e.g., CpG motifs) directly to the disease site. Preclinically, DNA 
nanostructures have demonstrated improved drug bioavailability, significant 
tumor regression, and induction of a strong immune response with fewer 
off-target effects or toxicities than conventional therapies. This narrative 
review summarizes the recent advances in DNA nanostructures as anticancer 
agents.

AIM: To investigate the performance of the Xpert® Breast Cancer STRAT4 (CE-IVD∗) 
Assay (STRAT4) in the neoadjuvant, randomized Austrian Breast and Colorectal 
Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) Trial 34.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The primary objective of this study was to assess the 
concordance between STRAT4 mRNA measurements of ESR1, PGR, ERBB2, and MKi67 
obtained from diagnostic core biopsies of the ABCSG Trial 34 with central 
reference laboratory immunohistochemistry (IHC) (and in-situ hybridization for 
HER2 IHC 2+ samples). For each marker, overall percent agreement (concordance), 
positive percent agreement (sensitivity), and negative percent agreement 
(specificity) between STRAT4 and IHC were determined. The secondary objective 
was to evaluate the concordance of STRAT 4 and IHC in post-treatment surgical 
samples and the association of both assays with residual cancer burden (RCB), 
time to distant recurrence (DR), and overall survival (OS). Logistic regression 
and Cox regression models were used.
RESULTS: A total of 354 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded diagnostic core 
biopsies were examined, representing 88.5 % of the available samples. 
Concordance between STRAT 4 and IHC was 93.7 % for ER, 80.5 % for PR, and 94.1 % 
for Ki67. All three biomarkers tested by either STRAT4 or central IHC showed 
similar correlation to RCB, time to DR, and OS.
CONCLUSIONS: In diagnostic core biopsies, there was a good agreement between 
STRAT4 mRNA measurements and centrally assessed IHC measurements of ER, and 
moderate agreement for PR and Ki67.

Medical University, Suzhou, China.

PURPOSE: Keap1 mutations mainly caused NRF2-dependent anti-oxidative stress 
responses, yet whether there are other downstream substrates and pathways 
remains unknown. This study aimed to uncover the role of Keap1 mutations in 
regulating PHF10-NRF2 axis in NSCLC and ferroptosis evasion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tandem affinity purification with mass spectrometry was 
used to screen peptides. Co-IP and ubiquitination assays were used to confirm 
the Keap1-PHF10 axis. A series of analyses in cell lines, patient samples, and 
xenograft models were conducted to uncover the functional dependency between 
Keap1 and NRF2. Transmission electron microscope was used to detect 
mitochondrion swelling under ferroptosis.
RESULTS: Here, we reported that Keap1 binds and promotes polyubiquitination and 
degradation of PHF10, a subunit of the PBAF complex. NSCLC-associated Keap1 
mutations are incapable of degrading PHF10, and thus induces PHF10 proteins 
stability. PHF10 ablation shows synthetic lethality in Keap1-deficient NSCLC 
cells. Mechanistically, PHF10 interacts with NRF2 to activate its downstream 
targets and enhance the NRF2-dependent anti-oxidative stress capacity in NSCLC. 
PHF10 recruits SMARCA2, one core cBAF subunit, to increase chromatin 
accessibility in NRF2-binding transcriptional regions. Cancer-associated Keap1 
mutants confer resistance to ROS-induced cell death via accumulating 
PHF10-SMARCA2 complex. Increased PHF10 further induced ferroptosis resistance in 
Keap1-deficient NSCLC. Lastly, we utilized one small molecule inhibitor, 
SMARCA2-IN-8, to inhibit progression of Keap1-deficient NSCLC murine models.
CONCLUSION: Together, our study highlight the synthetic lethal relationship 
between Keap1 and PHF10, and provide targeting PHF10-SMARCA2 complex as an 
effective option to hit Keap1-deficient NSCLC.

PURPOSE: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor 
outcomes. IMpower133 and CASPIAN established platinum-etoposide plus anti-PD-L1 
antibody as standard first-line therapy for extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). 
Real-world data in Korean patients are scarce. We evaluated the effectiveness 
and safety of first-line chemo-immunotherapy in ES-SCLC and compared outcomes 
with pivotal trials.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients diagnosed with 
ES-SCLC between 2018 and 2021. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival 
(PFS), and time to next treatment (TTNT) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier 
methods. Multivariate Cox regression identified prognostic factors. Objective 
response rate (ORR) was assessed by RECIST v1.1, and histological subtypes 
evaluated.
RESULTS: Among 177 patients, median age was 66 years (range, 42-91), with 63.8% 
aged ≥65; most were male (92.7%) and ECOG 0-1 (91.5%). Smoking history was 
present in 80.8%. Baseline brain and liver metastases occurred in 27.7% and 26%. 
Median follow-up was 27.2 months (range, 3.9-43.2). ORR was 74.5% (95% CI, 
67.1-81.1). Median OS, PFS, and TTNT were 12.4 (95% CI, 11.6-14.9), 5.3 (95% CI, 
5.1-5.87), and 5.6 months (95% CI, 1.43-38.27). In 49 patients with brain 
metastases, ORR was 63.2%, with no difference in efficacy. Local therapy for 
brain metastases improved OS (HR 0.42; p=0.012), while PFS was not different. 
Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 90%, primarily grade ≥2 cytopenias; 
the most common immune-related event was grade 1 rash.
CONCLUSION: In this real-world Korean cohort, first-line chemo-immunotherapy 
achieved outcomes comparable to pivotal trials, supporting its role as standard 
care for ES-SCLC in clinical practice.

PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of 
post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in male breast cancer (MBC) patients and 
develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model to identify a potential PMRT 
benefit population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from a total of 2,247 MBC patients with T1-2N0-1M0 
who underwent total mastectomy between 1998 and 2016 were enrolled from the SEER 
database. Propensity score matching was used to reduce covariate imbalances. Cox 
regression analysis was conducted to compare overall survival (OS) between the 
PMRT and no-PMRT groups. The hypothesis was that patients who had undergone PMRT 
and lived longer than the median OS of the no-PMRT group could benefit from 
PMRT. An ANN model was then developed to predict PMRT benefit population.
RESULTS: Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated better OS in the PMRT 
group compared to the no-PMRT group of matched patients. This survival benefit 
was particularly significant in patients with grade III or T2N0 and T2N1 
disease, while no significant difference was observed in patients with grade 
I/II or T1N0 and T1N1 disease. An ANN model was established to predict PMRT 
benefit population based on patients with T2N0/T2N1. The optimal cut-off value 
for the model predicted probability was 0.51. Survival curves indicated that a 
score of 0.51 could accurately distinguish potential PMRT benefit population.
CONCLUSION: For MBC patients with T2N0, T2N1, and grade III, PMRT would improve 
survival. The ANN model would be used to identify patients who are likely to 
benefit from PMRT and aid in clinical decision-making.

Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) is an intracellular negative regulator 
of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling having been considered as an important target 
for cancer immunotherapy. Pharmacological studies in preclinical models have 
shown that the inhibition or depletion of HPK1 achieved the reinvigoration of 
exhausted T cells and enhanced anti-tumor immunity. Although HPK1 inhibitors in 
clinical trials have shown preliminary clinical benefits, lager scale 
verification is still needed. High selectivity, especially within the MAP4K 
family, is critical for the development of HPK1 inhibitors in clinic. Herein, 
guided by structural pharmacology, we developed a novel HPK1 inhibitor, compound 
34, with excellent selectivity and potency. Compound 34 robustly inhibited HPK1 
kinase activity with an IC50 value lower than 5 nM and displayed 1257-fold 
selectivity over the MAP4K kinase family member GLK. Cocrystal structures 
combining with docking analysis unveiled that the stable U-shaped non-planar 
conformation of these serials of compounds renders high selectivity over GLK. 
Treatment with compound 34 inhibited TCR-induced phosphorylation of SLP76 at 
Ser376 in a dose-dependent manner. Pharmacokinetic evaluation revealed high oral 
bioavailability of compound 34. Furthermore, oral dosing of compound 34 combined 
with anti-PD-1 achieved significant anti-tumor effect (TGI = 62.90 %) in the 
CT-26 syngeneic model. These findings demonstrated compound 34 as a promising 
preclinical candidate worthy of further investigation.

An amphiphilic α-helical peptide called KLAK (sequence KLAKLAKKLAKLAK) possesses 
antimicrobial and anticancer activity. KLAK peptide disrupts bacterial membrane 
as well as eukaryotic mitochondrial membrane, which makes it an interesting tool 
for killing cancer cells. Nevertheless, the peptide itself suffers from 
inappropriate distribution in the body, low cell internalization ability causing 
its insufficient anticancer efficacy and potential toxicity toward the healthy 
part of the organism. This review focuses on the strategies, which have been 
widely employed to overcome this obstacle and reach mitochondria destruction and 
thus enhance anticancer effect in vitro and in vivo in various types of tumors. 
Various approaches to targeting KLAK towards cancer cells are discussed, such as 
peptide-based homing domains or amino acid modifications.

Endoplasmic reticulum stress at the forefront of fatty liver diseases and 
cancer.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a dynamic membranous organelle that accounts 
for nearly half of the total membrane content in hepatocytes and serves as a 
central hub for protein folding and lipid biosynthesis. Given the liver's 
essential functions in protein production and secretion, lipid handling, and 
xenobiotic metabolism, hepatocyte ER homeostasis is essential for systemic 
metabolic control and health. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver 
disease, which affects nearly 30% of the global population, is strongly linked 
to hepatic ER stress. Accumulating evidence highlights the unfolded protein 
response (UPR) as a key mechanistic regulator that integrates proteostasis and 
metabolic stress, thereby influencing disease progression from simple steatosis 
to inflammation-driven metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). 
More recently, ER stress has also been implicated as a driver of MASH-related 
hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common primary liver cancer. In this review, 
we provide a comprehensive overview of the dynamic roles of the UPR and ER 
stress in hepatocytes, with particular emphasis on mechanistic insights derived 
from murine models of MASH-related hepatocellular carcinoma. We also summarize 
the current animal models of MASH that depend on hepatic ER stress. Finally, we 
discuss therapeutic candidates for MASH treatment, whose mechanisms of action 
involve ER stress and the UPR. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) functions as a central signaling hub, transmitting stress cues to 
transcriptional and translational programs through activation of the unfolded 
protein response, which orchestrates adaptive responses required for stress 
recovery. Given that hepatocytes are the largest cell population responsible for 
systemic protein distribution through ER-regulated protein synthesis, precise 
control of hepatic ER stress is essential not only for maintaining normal 
hepatocyte function but also for developing therapeutic strategies against ER 
stress-driven metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.

INTRODUCTION: Primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the kidney is an 
exceptionally rare malignancy, current knowledge being limited to isolated case 
reports and small case series. This study represents the first population-based 
analysis of SCC of the kidney using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
and End Results (SEER) database.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the 
SEER Research Data (2000-2022). Patients aged ≥ 15 years with histologically 
confirmed primary renal SCC and tumor site C64.9 (kidney) were included. 
Patients were categorized into metastatic and non-metastatic subgroups. Survival 
outcomes in the overall cohort were estimated using the Aalen-Johansen method to 
generate cumulative incidence functions, while Gray's test was applied for 
subgroup comparisons. Prognostic factors associated with cancer-specific 
mortality (CSM) in the overall cohort and the metastatic subgroup were evaluated 
using the Fine-Gray proportional subdistribution hazards model.
RESULTS: The 2-year CSM rate among the 114 patients was 83.7%. The majority of 
patients (78.9%) were aged ≥ 60 years. In the overall cohort, right-sided tumor 
location (P = .026) and bone metastasis at diagnosis (P < .001) were 
significantly associated with an increased risk of CSM, while unmarried status 
(P = .090), lack of surgical treatment (P = .054), and receipt of radiotherapy 
(P = .050) exhibited borderline associations with an increased risk. At 
multivariate analysis, right-sided tumor location and radiotherapy were 
independently associated with poorer survival, while surgical treatment emerged 
as an independent predictor of improved survival in the metastatic group.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary SCC of the kidney is a rare and aggressive malignancy, 
typically diagnosed at advanced stages and associated with poor outcomes. 
Unmarried status, right-sided tumor location, bone metastasis at diagnosis, lack 
of surgical treatment, and receipt of radiotherapy were associated with an 
increased risk of CSM. Further multicenter studies with detailed clinical data 
are now needed to guide evidence-based management of this uncommon disease.

Podophyllotoxin (PPT) is an aryltetralin lignan with tubulin-inhibiting and 
potential anti-colorectal cancer (CRC) properties. However, its cytotoxicity and 
tendency to induce drug resistance limit its clinical utility. The AKT signaling 
pathway is pivotal in tumor cell proliferation, metabolic reprogramming, and 
drug resistance. Inhibiting AKT activity can enhance tumor cell sensitivity to 
microtubule-targeting drugs. In this study, a molecular library of PPT 
derivatives (10,800 compounds) was generated based on the PPT scaffold using 
structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis. Screening identified 11 
AKT1/tubulin dual-targeting PPT-1,2,3-triazole ether derivatives with potential 
anti-colorectal cancer activity. The most potent compound, 2b 
(IC50 = 0.77 ± 0.05 μmol/L), demonstrated significant antiproliferative effects 
on HCT-116 cells, surpassing PPT (IC50 = 3.83 ± 0.25 μmol/L) and gefitinib 
(IC50 = 42.87 ± 3.39 μmol/L) by 4.9-fold and 55.7-fold, respectively. Compound 
2b inhibited HCT-116 cell colony formation, arrested the cell cycle at G2/M 
phase, suppressed cell migration, and induced apoptosis. Molecular docking and 
dynamics simulations revealed that 2b could dual-target AKT1 and tubulin with 
higher binding stability than PPT. Laser confocal microscopy demonstrated its 
efficacy in promoting tubulin depolymerization. Mechanistic investigations 
showed that 2b downregulated p-AKT expression, inhibiting AKT signaling pathway 
activation. Notably, compound 2b exhibited good water solubility and 
significantly inhibited tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. In conclusion, 
compound 2b, as an AKT1/tubulin dual inhibitor, has great potential in CRC 
treatment and is worthy of further research.

Small-molecule inhibition of PD-1/PDL1 via PDL1 dimerization presents a 
promising yet challenging therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. To 
accelerate the discovery of effective PDL1 inhibitors, we developed machine 
learning (ML)-based models optimized for PDL1-specific predictions. By 
systematically constructing and evaluating multiple classification and 
regression models (30 classifiers and 30 regressors), we identified 
Stacking_standard as the best-performing classifier and SVM_standard as the 
optimal regressor. Our approach combines classifier-based activity prediction 
with regressor-based affinity estimation, enabling a two-tiered screening 
strategy that enhances accuracy. Screening a 12-million-compound library 
resulted in 6704 potential PDL1 inhibitors, which were further refined through 
molecular docking. Seven top candidates exhibited strong binding affinity 
(binding energy ≤ -11.5 kcal/mol), and HTRF-based assays confirmed potent PDL1 
inhibition for two compounds, with IC50 values of 17.49 nM and 63.17 nM. 
Subsequent 300-ns molecular dynamics simulations revealed stable binding 
conformations for the inhibitors. Beyond these validated hits, our analysis 
uncovered 15 critical substructural motifs that provide valuable insights for 
rational inhibitor design. Additionally, SwissADME profiling indicated favorable 
drug-likeness, particularly for Hit 1, supporting their potential as lead 
compounds. The entire ML screening pipeline has been made accessible through the 
PDL1-inhi.predictor web server (http://www.pdl1predictor.com/chemicals), 
offering researchers a powerful tool for PDL1 inhibitor discovery.

Pharmacogenomics has emerged as a vital field within precision medicine and 
forensics, focusing on how an individual's genome affects their response to 
drugs. This field is essential in enhancing treatment efficacy and minimizing 
side effects, particularly for cancer patients with gliomas, who often face 
narrow therapeutic windows for anticancer agents and have a limited Food and 
Drug Administration-approved treatment option. Among the cytochrome P450 enzyme 
superfamily, CYP2B6 metabolizes drugs such as cyclophosphamide, efavirenz, 
methadone, and ecstasy. Genetic variation in P450 genes influences individual's 
drug-metabolizing capacity, making it crucial to understand CYP2B6 and its 
regulation to ensure the effectiveness and safety of drug therapies and 
determine the cause of death in drug-related cases. Previous studies have shown 
that activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5), a basic leucine zipper 
transcription factor, transactivates CYP2B6 in liver cells. Additionally, a 
cell-penetrating dominant-negative ATF5 (CP-DN-ATF5) peptide was developed and 
successfully interfered with the ATF5-mediated stabilization of antiapoptotic 
proteins. Our study aimed to establish the ATF5-mediated regulation of CYP2B6 in 
glioblastoma cells and to determine whether CP-DN-ATF5 could also promote the 
downregulation of CYP2B6. We used the Tat cell-penetrating peptide from HIV-1 
transactivator of transcription (TAT) form, which was N-terminally fused with 
DN-ATF5 (TAT-CP-DN-ATF5), for our investigation. We found that ATF5 regulates 
CYP2B6, and the TAT-CP-DN-ATF5 peptide effectively downregulates CYP2B6 protein 
levels in certain glioblastoma cell lines, LN229 and GBM5. These findings 
suggest the potential for targeting CYP2B6 with TAT-CP-DN-ATF5 to slow drug 
metabolism, allowing for personalized dosing and coadministration strategies to 
improve treatment efficiency and reduce side effects. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: 
The study found that the transcription factor activating transcription factor 5 
regulates CYP2B6 expression in glioblastoma cell lines. Introducing a 
transactivator of transcription-fused cell-penetrating dominant-negative 
activating transcription factor 5 peptide downregulates CYP2B6 protein 
expression, suggesting its potential for personalized dosing strategies by 
targeting CYP2B6.

INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the 
periodontium, causes gingival inflammation and bone loss. Meanwhile, oral cancer 
synonymously known as oral squamous cell carcinoma is characterised by 
uncontrolled cell growth in the oral cavity. Both conditions can compromise oral 
function and reduce quality of life. Oral bacteria are implicated in the link 
between periodontitis and oral squamous cell carcinoma, but the specific 
molecular alterations and pathways involved in carcinogenesis are yet to be 
elucidated. Hence, this review aimed to explore the role of proteomes of known 
oral bacteria in carcinogenesis at the molecular level.
METHODS: Relevant articles were searched through electronic databases at 
MEDLINE/Pubmed, EBSCOHost and Web of Science from 2017 to 2025.
RESULTS: Three periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium 
nucleatum and Treponema denticola, are involved in cancer development. They 
express lipopolysaccharide, gingipain, FimA, mfa1, outer membrane vesicles, 
nucleoside disphosphate kinase, FadA and Treponema denticola chymotrypsin-like 
protease. They cause cancer via 5 different mechanisms: inflammation, inhibition 
of apoptosis, production of carcinogenic substances, cellular proliferation and 
cellular invasion. These occur alongside their ability to evade and escape host 
immune responses.
CONCLUSION: Periodontitis and oral squamous cell carcinoma are linked through 
periodontal pathogens, which express various proteins. This highlights the 
importance of maintaining periodontal health to reduce the risk of oral squamous 
cell carcinoma and improve disease outcomes.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Understanding how periodontal pathogens contribute to oral 
squamous cell carcinoma reinforces the need for early diagnosis and effective 
management of periodontitis. The identified bacterial proteins can serve as 
early diagnostic biomarkers for oral squamous cell carcinoma. Furthermore, 
clinicians should consider periodontal health not only for preserving dentition 
but also as part of cancer prevention strategies.

BACKGROUND: In the growing field of personalized cancer medicine (PCM), 
successful implementation requires access to advanced molecular diagnostics and 
treatments. The Personalized Cancer Medicine for all EU Citizens (PCM4EU) 
consortium was established to facilitate broad implementation of PCM across 
Europe. This study aimed to assess the current status of PCM from the 
perspectives of health care professionals and patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three distinct questionnaires were developed for medical 
oncologists, pathologists, and patients, focusing on molecular diagnostics use 
in countries participating in the PCM4EU consortium. Adult patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic cancer who underwent molecular diagnostics were eligible 
to complete the patient questionnaire.
RESULTS: Between July 2024 and February 2025, 14 out of 15 countries completed 
the medical oncologist and pathologist questionnaires. Equitable access to 
molecular diagnostics was reported by 4 out of 14 countries, with limited access 
to treatments, clinical trials, or reimbursement issues identified as common 
barriers. Tumor-specific biomarkers matching approved targeted therapies were 
more often tested than tumor-agnostic biomarkers. Molecular tumor boards were 
established in 13 out of 14 countries. There was limited availability of complex 
biomarker testing techniques in several countries, and laboratories sometimes 
lacked accreditation by the International Organization for Standardization. A 
total of 288 patients from 16 countries completed the patient questionnaire. 
More comprehensible information regarding molecular diagnostics and better pre- 
and post-test genetic counseling were the main improvements reported by 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: By use of extensive questionnaires, we assessed the implementation 
of PCM in Europe and identified persistent inequalities, ranging from 
disparities in available biomarker testing techniques to their reimbursement, 
and shortcomings in communication to patients. By facilitating access to similar 
treatments across countries with the establishment of a Drug Rediscovery 
Protocol-like clinical trials network, and accelerating data generation by 
sharing data, patients in Europe are one step closer to equitable access to 
precision oncology.

INTRODUCTION: Pediatric cancer survivors face significant treatment-related 
morbidity from multimodal therapies. Although late effects of chemotherapy and 
radiation are well-documented, surgical sequelae regarding long-term functional 
outcomes remain inadequately studied. This international survey analyzed current 
follow-up practices and quantified variability in functional sequelae assessment 
after pediatric solid tumor surgical resections.
METHODS: A 20-item survey was distributed through the International Society of 
Pediatric Surgical Oncology to pediatric surgical oncologists worldwide, 
assessing institutional practices regarding surgical follow-up periods, 
specialists involved, and organ-specific protocols. Centers were categorized by 
surgical volume as low (<20 resections/year), medium (20-50), or high (>50) for 
comparative analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 121 pediatric surgical centers from 46 countries responded. 
Functional follow-up was conducted primarily by surgeons and oncologists in most 
centers (56.2%), with limited specialist involvement (20.7%). Significant 
deficiencies were identified in standardized protocols, particularly for 
fertility assessment after bladder/prostate resections (62.8% without structured 
follow-up) and pulmonary function testing after thoracic interventions (67.8% 
not routinely performed). High-volume centers demonstrated significantly better 
standardized follow-up practices for biliary (82.5% vs 54.3%, P = .003) and 
pulmonary sequelae compared with lower-volume centers. All respondents 
acknowledged the crucial importance of functional follow-up, with 97.5% stating 
improvements were needed.
DISCUSSION: This exploratory survey reveals significant gaps and variability in 
functional follow-up practices, suggesting many survivors may not receive 
optimal surveillance. The identified deficiencies, particularly in standardized 
protocols for fertility and pulmonary assessment, highlight urgent needs for 
evidence-based guideline development in pediatric surgical oncology.

BACKGROUND/AIM: In the modern era, breast surgery aims to adopt conservative 
strategies that ensure both oncological safety and aesthetic outcomes. However, 
one of the major challenges is the risk of positive margins, which may require a 
second surgery. Various strategies have been adopted to minimize this risk. The 
most commonly used strategies include the selective resection of suspicious 
margins after intraoperative evaluation and the routine circumferential 
resection of additional tissue around the cavity left by a lumpectomy, known as 
the Cavity-Shave (CS) Technique.
METHODS: A blind randomized clinical trial was conducted, in which standard 
selective margin resections were compared to the CS technique, in a 1:1 ratio, 
comparing oncological outcomes, aesthetic results, and surgical time.
RESULTS: A total of 185 patients were enrolled in the study, with a mean age of 
62.04 ± 14.02. The sample was randomly assigned to two groups: 91(49.2 %) were 
allocated to the cavity shave (CS) Group and 94 (50.8 %) to the no-CS-Group. The 
rate of positive margins was 20.9 % versus 18.1 %, p-value:0.631 vs 
p-value:0.577. The re-excision rate was 12.1 % vs 14.9 %, in the CS-group and in 
the no-Cs-Group respectively. The mean operating room occupancy time was 
77.9 ± 23.5 min in the CS-group versus 95.6 ± 34.9 min in the no-Cs-Group, with 
a p-value<0.001. Aesthetic outcomes were comparable between the two groups 
(p-value:0.706), despite a statistically significant difference in the total 
volume excised, 67.2 ± 16.4 cm3 in the CS-Group versus 51.5 ± 17.2 cm3 in the 
no-CS-Group, p-value:0.021.
CONCLUSION: CS and selective margin resection with intraoperative 
histopathological evaluation showed similar oncological and aesthetic outcomes; 
however, CS was associated with a statistically significant reduction in 
surgical time.

Increased expression of the polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 6 
(GALNT6), an O-glycosyltransferase, has been reported to play a crucial role in 
mammary carcinogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that GALNT6 O-glycosylates 
Glucose-regulated protein 78/Binding immunoglobulin protein (GRP78/Bip), a key 
regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR), by adding 
N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), thereby modulating its stability in breast 
cancer cells. Functional inhibition of either GALNT6 or GRP78/Bip suppressed the 
proliferation of the luminal-type breast cancer cell line, ZR-75-1, 
understanding their importance in tumor cell growth. We further found that 
GRP78/Bip, which is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is 
transported to the Golgi apparatus under the ER stress conditions, where it 
undergoes O-glycosylation at Thr203 by the Golgi-resident GALNT6. Substitution 
of Thr203 with alanine inhibited the binding of GRP78/Bip to IRE1, an ER stress 
sensor, suggesting that the O-glycosylation at Thr203 in GRP78/Bip facilitates 
sustained activation of the UPR. These findings define the GALNT6-GRP78/Bip axis 
as a novel mechanism driving persistent UPR activation and tumor cell adaptation 
to ER stress, offering a potential new therapeutic target for luminal-type 
breast cancers.

T-cell dysfunction is a critical obstacle to effective anti-cancer 
immunotherapy. Despite the fact that hypoxia is a common feature of the tumor 
microenvironment, the mechanisms driving T-cell senescence under hypoxic 
conditions remain largely unexplored. This study investigated the impact of 
hypoxic conditions on CD4+ T-cell senescence using Jurkat T cell line. Under 
hypoxia, T cell exhaustion was not induced; however, senescence-associated 
β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity and lipid accumulation were increased. Tumor 
immune estimation resource analysis revealed that PLA2G4A that encodes cPLA2α 
protein is associated with reduced tumor purity and increased CD4+ T-cell 
infiltration in various cancers, suggesting a role in immune modulation. 
Hypoxia-induced activation of cPLA2α promoted lipid accumulation. Inhibition of 
cPLA2α under hypoxia led to a reduction in SA-β-gal activity and p27 expression, 
along with decreased levels of cyclin B1 and CDC2, indicative of G2/M cell cycle 
arrest. Moreover, cPLA2α inhibition restored CD28 expression and suppressed 
TGF-β1 levels, both of which are associated with T-cell senescence. 
Hypoxia-induced cPLA2α activation upregulated Cox-2-mediated prostaglandin E2 
(PGE2) production, and exogenous PGE2 treatment further increased SA-β-gal 
activity. These findings illustrated that cPLA2α-driven lipid metabolism under 
hypoxia contributes to the T-cell senescence and may represent a therapeutic 
target to enhance anti-cancer immunity.

Ubiquitin-specific protease 24 (USP24) is a deubiquitinase that regulates 
protein stability, localization, and activity, exhibiting pronounced 
tissue-specific functions. Depending on the tumor context, USP24 can act either 
as an oncogene or suppressor, reflecting its strong dependence on 
tissue-specific substrates and signaling environments. Its dual roles in DNA 
damage repair and autophagy further underscore its functional complexity. This 
review summarizes the structural features of USP24, its diverse cellular 
functions, and its involvement in cancer and other diseases, and highlights 
recent advances in USP24 inhibitors. Targeting USP24 represents a novel and 
clinically relevant strategy, capable of selectively modulating its 
tissue-dependent activities, thereby offering potential avenues for therapeutic

DNA damage response (DDR), a highly complicated regulatory network that detects 
and repairs DNA lesions, serves as an indispensable guardian of genomic 
integrity. Targeting aberrant DNA repair pathway has emerged as a promising 
therapeutic approach for cancer, which includes double-strand break repair 
(DSBR), nucleotide and base excision repair (NER/BER) and mismatch repair (MMR). 
Elucidating precise molecular mechanisms of DNA damage repair and their 
synthetic lethal effects will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic 
targets and strategies for cancer. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) modulate the 
subcellular localization, protein activity and stability of DDR molecules, 
thereby playing a critical role in dynamically orchestrating DNA damage repair 
process. Furthermore, DUBs are highly attractive drug targets in cancer 
therapies due to their catalytic domains. This review provides a comprehensive 
overview of the multifaceted roles and mechanisms of DUBs in DNA damage 
responses and their anticancer potential.

BACKGROUND: Advanced practice radiation therapist (APRT) roles have expanded 
internationally to address cancer workforce shortages and improve service 
delivery. A Canadian consensus process previously established 20 standardized 
APRT clinical activities across five themes. This study evaluated the 
international applicability of these activities through expert consensus to 
establish a global framework for APRT practice.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A systematic three-round international Delphi consensus 
study was conducted following established quality framework recommendations. 
Expert panel members were recruited from an international Community of Practice 
using objective selection criteria ensuring recognized APRT expertise and 
diverse geographical representation. Participant anonymity was maintained 
throughout all rounds. Controlled feedback provided quantitative results and 
anonymized qualitative comments between rounds. Consensus threshold was defined 
a priori at 80% agreement, and activities were evaluated for inclusion in 
international APRT scope of practice across five themes: patient interactions, 
multidisciplinary consultation, virtual consultation, resource optimization, and 
technical activities.
RESULTS: Twenty-three international experts were invited to take part in the 
study with response rates of 81% (Round 1), 89% (Round 2), and 89% (Round 3). 
Twenty clinical activities were systematically evaluated. Five activities 
achieved immediate Round 1 consensus: Planning Consultation (83%), 
Multidisciplinary Pre-treatment Consultation (83%), Care Coordination (96%), 
Patient Navigation (87%), and Technical Consultation (87%). Following iterative 
three-round evaluation, 16 of 20 activities (80%) achieved final international 
consensus for APRT practice inclusion. Four activities failed to reach 
consensus: Patient Education/Informed Consent (75%), Follow-up Consultation 
(78%), Clinical Examination (78%), and MR Applicator Assessment (65%). The 
validated framework demonstrates substantial global alignment while identifying 
specific jurisdictional variations in advanced practice acceptance.
CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes international consensus on core APRT 
clinical activities, providing evidence-based foundations for standardized 
global APRT role development and implementation. These findings support 
healthcare systems in addressing workforce challenges through validated advanced 
practice frameworks while maintaining quality cancer care delivery.

BACKGROUND: Biological aging is thought to be associated with colorectal cancer 
(CRC), however, the mechanisms underlying are not fully understood. This study 
aimed to elucidate how biological aging contributes to the onset of CRC.
METHODS: We first performed a longitudinal cohort study (5448 incident CRC and 
317,192 controls) to evaluate the relationships between biological aging (i.e., 
leukocyte telomere length, PhenoAge, Klemera-Doubal, homeostatic dysregulation 
[HD] score, frailty) and CRC, and assessed how it contributes to the association 
of modifiable risk factors with CRC using Cox regression models. Then, we 
performed Mendelian randomization (MR) studies to evaluate the relationship of 
biological aging with CRC risk from the epigenetic perspective (epigenetic aging 
clocks). Finally, a three-step MR analysis between aging-related DNA methylation 
(DNAm), gene expression, and CRC followed by colocalization analysis was 
performed to elucidate the CpGs/genes and possible pathways underlying aging and 
CRC.
FINDINGS: In the longitudinal cohort study, we found PhenoAge acceleration and 
HD score associated with increased CRC risk, and these associations were 
stronger for early-onset CRC (HR [95% CI]: 1.29 [1.07-1.55] for PhenoAge 
acceleration and 1.35 [1.08-1.69] for HD score) than late-onset CRC (HR [95% 
CI]: 1.06 [1.03-1.09] for PhenoAge acceleration and 1.05 [1.02-1.08] for HD 
score) (Pheterogeneity<0.05). Accelerated biological aging partly mediated the 
adverse effect of unhealthy lifestyle and its components on CRC, with 
proportions of mediation ranging from 0.18% to 27.00%. In the epigenetic MR, 
genetically determined DNAm GrimAge was positively associated with CRC risk. 
Altered methylation at 15 aging-related CpGs was associated with CRC and was 
prioritized with high colocalization evidence. Four mapped genes (TNF, BICC1, 
NCF2, DIP2B) were significantly associated with CRC. The lower expression of 
TNF, NCF2, and DIP2B mediated the adverse effect of the methylation at 
cg04425624 and cg03037030 (TNF), cg09076123 (NCF2), and cg05512157 (DIP2B) on 
CRC, respectively, and higher expression of BICC1 mediated the adverse effect of 
the methylation at 4 CpGs (cg08353444, cg23963517, cg06424110, cg09578524) on 
CRC.
INTERPRETATION: This study found that accelerated biological aging was 
associated with a higher risk of CRC and implied potential intervention 
opportunities by adherence to healthy lifestyles. Aging-related DNAm and altered 
gene expression might contribute to this biological association, which yielded 
insights into the etiology and potential therapeutic targets of CRC.

Accurate detection of tumor-associated microRNAs (miRNAs) is crucial for early 
cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, detecting low-abundance miRNAs with 
high sensitivity and specificity in complex biological fluids remains a 
significant challenge. Here, we report a novel detection system that integrates 
catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) and hybridization chain reaction (HCR) for the 
sensitive detection of miR-21, a well-established oncomiR. Our strategy employs 
cholesterol-modified DNA (Chol-DNA) to self-assemble into micellar 
nanostructures, which stabilize the DNA probes and create a spatially confined 
environment to boost reaction efficiency. In the presence of miR-21, a CHA 
reaction is initiated, triggering a downstream HCR cascade that generates long 
DNA polymers. This dual-amplification mechanism produces a robust fluorescence 
signal via Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between Cy3 and Cy5 
fluorophores. The system demonstrates exceptional sensitivity with a limit of 
detection (LOD) of 10 pM and exhibits high specificity, effectively 
discriminating miR-21 from single-base mismatched sequences and other 
interfering miRNAs. Operating isothermally and without enzymes, the assay 
maintains its performance in complex biological media, including human serum, 
making it ideal for liquid biopsy applications. The Chol-DNA modification not 
only prevents probe degradation but also accelerates signal amplification 
through the confinement effect. This CHA-HCR system represents a simple, 
portable, and reliable tool for miRNA analysis, showing immense potential for 
non-invasive cancer diagnostics in clinical environments.

Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) serves as a valuable biomarker for pancreatic 
cancer (PC), offering the possibility for the early screening and diagnosis. 
Herein we developed a dual-signal output electrochemical immunosensor fabricated 
by PPy-BiVO4 and Cu2S-PtPd for the quantitative detection of CA19-9. 
Erythrocyte-like BiVO4 was prepared by one pot hydrothermal method and 
functionalized by APTES. By utilizing BiVO4 with specific surface area as 
substrate, massive polypyrrole nanotubes (PPy NTs) can be anchored on the sensor 
thus amplifying the signal effectively. Snowflake-like Cu2S and spherical PtPd 
nanoparticles were synthesized by hydrothermal method. In addition, PtPd 
nanoparticles functionalized Cu2S nanozyme (Cu2S-PtPd nanozyme) is exploited as 
the catalytic active material and utilized to achieve the enrichment of target 
molecules in this study. Experimental results demonstrated that the immunosensor 
realized high sensitivity with the detection range of differential pulse 
voltammetry (DPV) is 0.001-100 U/mL and that of chronoamperometry (i-t) is 
0.001-150 U/mL. The detection limit is 0.00017 U/mL for DPV and 0.00011 U/mL for 
i-t, along with superior selectivity, reproducibility and storage stability. At 
the same time, the immunosensor exhibits a high recovery rate for the analysis 
of human serum samples. The results indicate that the fabricated immunosensor 
will be promising in the early diagnosis and prognosis monitoring of cancer 
biomarkers.

INTRODUCTION: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have improved clinical outcomes for 
small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), but patient responses vary widely, and predictive 
biomarkers remain inadequate.
METHODS: Longitudinal plasma samples were collected from SCLC patients before 
and during chemo-immunotherapy treatment, and quantified using mass 
spectrometry. Machine learning models were used to identify predictive 
biomarkers of chemo-immunotherapy response in both discovery and validation 
cohorts.
RESULTS: A total of 118 SCLC patients treated with anti-programmed death-ligand 
1 (anti-PD-L1) antibodies plus chemotherapy were enrolled. Proteomic profiling 
revealed that responders exhibited upregulation of proteins associated with 
IL-17 and JAK-STAT signaling pathways, while non-responders showed enrichment in 
PI3K-Akt and HIF-1 pathways. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
(LASSO)-based machine learning model incorporating three proteins-vasorin 
(VASN), par-3 family cell polarity regulator (PARD3), and prostaglandin E 
synthase 3 (PTGES3) (termed VPP model)-was developed to predict treatment 
response. In the training cohort (N = 42), the VPP model achieved an area under 
the curve (AUC) of 0.846 (95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.723-0.968, P < 
0.001). In the validation cohort (N = 40), the model yielded an AUC of 0.821 
(95 % CI: 0.686-0.955, P < 0.001), indicating robust predictive performance. 
Based on the VPP model, the response rates were 80 % in the low-risk group and 
20 % in the high-risk group (χ2 = 12.1, P < 0.001), with median progression-free 
survival of 6.87 and 3.97 months, respectively (hazard ratio = 0.39; 95 % CI: 
0.19-0.81; P = 0.004). In an external independent cohort (N = 36) using the 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, the model also demonstrated excellent 
predictive performance, with an AUC of 0.859 (95 % CI: 0.730-0.981; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that the VPP model, identified through 
plasma proteomics profiling, serves as a predictive biomarker for response to 
anti-PD-L1 plus chemotherapy in SCLC patients.

INTRODUCTION: Prehabilitation in patients with lung cancer has historically been 
focused on those undergoing surgical resection. However, its benefits could be 
applicable to those undergoing all forms of treatment both in the curative- and 
palliative-intent settings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve healthcare professionals convened to discuss 
prehabilitation across the spectrum of lung cancer management, aiming to share 
best practice and provide practical guidance.
RESULTS: Prehabilitation should be considered as part of a holistic treatment 
package for all patients diagnosed with lung cancer. A robust evidence base 
exists for patients undergoing surgery, with a developing and promising evidence 
base in other treatment pathways. Whilst further research is recommended, there 
is a strong ethical argument based on 'distributive justice' to adopt stage and 
treatment-agnostic delivery. Prehabilitation should begin as early as possible, 
ideally when a patient enters the diagnostic pathway. The benefits outweigh any 
negatives of delivering prehabilitation to people who do not have cancer and can 
only be delivered with a stage and treatment-agnostic ethos. Prehabilitation in 
the palliative treatment setting differs from the curative-intent setting, with 
patients facing more prolonged fluctuations in functional capacity as well as 
the psychological and physiological impact of ongoing treatment.
DISCUSSION: Stage and treatment-agnostic prehabilitation should become a 
standard of care within the lung cancer pathway.

BACKGROUND: Platinum-refractory/resistant (r/r) small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is 
associated with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. While chemotherapy 
has been the standard, recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have 
investigated immunotherapy and targeted therapies. In 2025, the DeLLphi-304 
trial showed tarlatamab significantly improved overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS) versus standard chemotherapy (SC). However, no 
network meta-analysis (NMA) has compared systemic therapies in this setting.
METHODS: We systematically searched major databases through June 2025 for phase 
III RCTs evaluating systemic therapies in platinum r/r SCLC. Extracted outcomes 
included OS, PFS, quality-of-life (QoL), overall response rate (ORR), and 
treatment-related adverse events (AEs). Indirect comparisons were performed 
using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, with treatment rankings assessed via 
SUCRA probabilities.
RESULTS: Six phase III RCTs were identified. Tarlatamab and nivolumab improved 
OS over other treatments, with tarlatamab ranking highest (SUCRA 0.96) and 
demonstrating superior safety.
CONCLUSIONS: Tarlatamab provides the most favorable outcomes, supporting its 
consideration as a preferred therapy for platinum r/r SCLC.

The genomic landscape of pediatric sarcomas is constantly expanding, and the 
utilization of integrated cytogenetic and molecular evaluation of these tumors 
for diagnosis, prognostication, and therapeutic implications continues to 
evolve. As a result, there are diverse approaches to the clinical practice of 
genomic testing in pediatric sarcomas. The Cancer Genomics Consortium Sarcoma 
Working Group conducted a survey to understand the current state of diagnostic 
genetic testing for pediatric sarcomas and assess the challenges faced in the 
field. Among 46 respondents across the United States and Canada, most utilized 
conventional karyotyping (61 %) and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (87 
%). Molecular methodologies, such as chromosomal microarray (30 %), targeted 
RT-PCR (22 %), gene fusion sequencing panels (35 %), pan-cancer sequencing 
panels (37 %), exome sequencing (11 %), and genome sequencing (7 %) were less 
frequently implemented clinically. When asked about challenges in the field of 
pediatric sarcoma, a scarcity of standard practice testing guidelines was noted 
most commonly, especially in the setting of limited tissue availability. 
Systematic evidence reviews and guidelines are needed for pediatric sarcomas 
with a consideration for multidisciplinary and international collaboration of 
individuals representing both high- and low-resource settings. As a resource in 
the interim, three case-based testing workflow scenarios are presented based on 
working group member experience to illustrate how differing technologies could 
be applied during evaluation considering diagnostic, prognostic and/or 
therapeutic needs. Finally, emerging technologies that are being applied to the 
diagnostic genetic evaluation of pediatric sarcomas are described, which upon 
implementation, may serve to streamline the work-up and further optimize patient 
care.

BACKGROUND: Fibrosis represents a critical pathological feature in the 
progression of liver cancer, wherein the activation of hepatic stellate cells 
(HSCs) plays an important role. Hydroxylsafflower yellow A (HSYA), a chalcone 
C-glycoside compound, has exhibited hepatoprotective, anti-fibrotic and 
anti-tumor effects. However, its potential role in preventing 
fibrosis-associated liver cancer remains unclear.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms 
of HSYA in fibrosis-associated liver cancer through both in vivo and in vitro 
experimental models.
METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and molecular 
biology techniques were employed to elucidate the mechanisms and identify the 
key molecular targets of HSYA in liver cancer. Co-culture experiments involving 
HSCs-derived exosomes (HSCs-exo) and hepatoma cells were conducted to evaluate 
the impact of HSYA on intercellular communication within the tumor 
microenvironment (TME). In the in vivo study, a fibrosis-associated liver cancer 
mouse model was established using diethylnitrosamine and carbon tetrachloride. 
Histological staining, immunohistochemistry, western blotting analysis, RT-qPCR, 
scanning electron microscopy, and fluorescence in situ hybridization were 
utilized to assess the effects of HSYA on tumor vascularization, including 
vasculogenic mimicry, angiogenesis, and vascular structural normalization.
RESULTS: miR-29a-3p, a tumor-suppressive miRNA, was significantly downregulated 
in liver cancer patients and exerted anti-tumor effects predominantly by 
modulating of extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interactions and the PI3K/AKT 
signaling pathway. HSYA effectively upregulated miR-29a-3p expression in both 
HSCs-exo and tumor tissues, thereby attenuating vasculogenic mimicry and 
abnormal angiogenesis in hepatoma cells as well as in the fibrosis-associated 
liver cancer mouse model through inhibition of the Col-IV/ITGB1/FAK and PI3K/AKT 
signaling pathways. Co-localization analysis of miR-29a-3p, VEGFA, and vimentin 
further demonstrated that HSYA increased miR-29a-3p expression while 
concurrently suppressing HSCs activation, trans-differentiation, and tumor 
vascularization. Furthermore, the study further demonstrated that HSYA partially 
regulated ECM-receptor interactions and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway through 
regulation of HSCs-exo following transfection with a miR-29a-3p inhibitor.
CONCLUSION: Understanding the dynamic variations in the TME during the 
progression from liver fibrosis to liver cancer, our findings suggested that the 
intercellular communication and ECM-receptor interactions regulated by HSYA may 
represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of 
fibrosis-associated liver cancer.

Lentinan (LNT) is a bioactive polysaccharide derived from shiitake mushrooms 
(Lentinula edodes). It exhibits a unique triple-helix structure and specific 
glycosidic bonds, which confer exceptional water solubility and gel-forming 
properties. This review summarizes the latest research progress of LNT in 
antitumor application. LNT exhibits remarkable antitumor activity through dual 
mechanisms. First, it modulates immunity by activating the Dectin-1 receptor, 
thereby enhancing immune responses. Second, it directly suppresses tumors by 
inducing apoptosis, inhibiting proliferation, and blocking key oncogenic 
pathways such as JAK2/STAT3 and PI3K/AKT. Additionally, LNT shows potent 
antioxidant effects through free radical scavenging and antioxidant gene 
regulation, offering protection against oxidative stress-related diseases 
including cancer. In therapeutic applications, LNT serves as an effective 
stabilizer in drug delivery systems, enhances targeted therapy when conjugated 
with nanomaterials, and exhibits synergistic effects with chemotherapeutics 
(cisplatin, gemcitabine, docetaxel) to improve efficacy while reducing toxicity. 
This review focuses on introducing the mechanism of action of LNT, the 
application of drug delivery and combined therapy, as well as future research 
directions. The aim is to provide scientific basis and reference for related 
research and drug development.

AIMS: To develop a national consensus on how to implement findings of recent 
practice changing Iodine or Not (IoN) trial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidisciplinary group of UK clinicians specialising 
in the management of thyroid cancer was convened to discuss the impact of the 
IoN trial on the management of early stage, low risk differentiated thyroid 
cancer in the UK. Virtual meetings were held to discuss the trial data and to 
develop a position statement on how to implement the findings ahead of changes 
in national guidelines.
RESULTS: A position statement providing recommendations for the managemnet of 
early stage, low risk differentiated thyroid cancer based on the group consensus 
opinion and interpretation of the IoN trial data was defined.
CONCLUSION: The Iodine or Not (IoN) trial was a UK multicentre prospective 
randomised controlled trial that investigated the role of radioiodine ablation 
in early stage, low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer. The findings showed 
non-inferiority of omitting radioiodine in terms of recurrence-free survival. 
This provides level 1 evidence to support sparing many patients with low-risk 
thyroid cancer treatment with radioiodine and the possible associated 
treatment-related adverse events. Ahead of changes in national and international 
guidelines this multidisciplinary group of specialists involved in the 
management of thyroid cancer proposes a position statement on how to implement 
these findings into UK practice.

INTRODUCTION: The role of systemic chemotherapy for patients with resectable or 
resected colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM) is debated.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: After a systematic search in PubMed and EMBASE databases, 
we conducted a meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomised phase 
III trials comparing surgery plus systemic chemotherapy with surgery alone in 
patients with CRCLM. Analyses were performed in the overall intention-to-treat 
(ITT) population, in patients who had curative-intent surgery (resected 
population), and in those who received post-operative chemotherapy only. The 
primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).
RESULTS: 821 patients (411 surgery alone, 410 surgery plus systemic 
chemotherapy) from four trials (EORTC 40983/EPOC, FFCD-ACHBTH-AURC 9002, ENG, 
and UMIN C000000013) were included. Systemic chemotherapy improved PFS in the 
overall ITT (HR 0.79; 95 %CI: 0.67-0.93, p = 0.004), in the resected (HR 0.77; 
95 %CI: 0.65-0.91, p = 0.003) and in the post-operative chemotherapy only (HR 
0.76; 95 %CI: 0.61-0.95, p = 0.016) populations. Systemic chemotherapy also 
improved overall survival (OS) in the overall ITT (HR 0.82; 95 %CI: 0.68-1.0, 
p = 0.048) and in the resected (HR 0.81; 95 %CI: 0.66-1.00, p = 0.046) 
populations. After adjusting for prognostic factors in multivariable analyses, 
the effect of systemic chemotherapy remained significant for PFS in the overall 
ITT (p < 0.001) and in the post-operative chemotherapy only (p = 0.003) 
populations. An interaction between systemic chemotherapy and time to diagnosis 
of liver metastases for PFS was found in the overall ITT (p = 0.027) and in the 
resected (p = 0.024) populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Systemic chemotherapy improves PFS of patients with resectable or 
resected CRCLM. This effect is stronger for patients with synchronous 
metastases.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Already decades ago, apolipoprotein E (apoE) was suggested 
to be implemented in risk of cancer. The aim was to investigate the current 
evidence on the association between APOE ε2/ε3/ε4 carrier status and risk of 
cancer.
METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis performed per PRISMA 
guidelines included a search of PubMed and Embase (PROSPERO CRD42024498793). 
Studies had to report APOE ε2/ε3/ε4 genotype/allele status, and ε33, non-ε4 or 
non-ε2 served as reference groups.
RESULTS: Of 3189 screened records, we included 38 studies in the meta-analysis. 
For all cancer the risk increased from ε2 to ε3 to ε4 (P for trend: p = 0.01). 
For breast cancer ε4 was the risk allele (p = 0.03). The risk for colorectal 
cancer increased from ε2 to ε3 to ε4 (p for trend: p = 0.02). The Odds Ratio 
(OR) (95 % confidence interval (CI)) for colorectal cancer was 1.07 (1.00-1.13) 
for ε43 vs. ε33. For lung cancer the OR was 1.52 (1.04-2.2) for ε22 vs. ε33, and 
2.80 (1.38-5.69) for ε4 vs. non-ε4. For the analyses for larynx and pharynx 
cancer, the OR was 0.72 (0.54-0.95) for ε2 vs. non-ε2.
CONCLUSIONS: APOE ε2/ε3/ε4 genotype does not constitute a major risk factor for 
cancer. Effect sizes were overall small, and we did not find a clear pattern 
appearing throughout all cancer types with none of the comparisons (for 
individual alleles/genotypes) statistically significant for risk of all cancer. 
The study cannot exclude small but biologically interesting allele and genotype 
specific patterns for some cancer types with ε4 posing to be a risk factor and 
ε2 a protective factor.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Accurate preoperative prediction of the International 
Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) grades is crucial for devising 
personalized treatment strategies for lung adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study 
was to develop and validate an integrative framework for preoperative prediction 
of pathological grades.
METHODS: A multicenter computed tomography (CT) imaging dataset, including 1226 
patients with stage IA lung adenocarcinoma from Datasets 1-3, was analyzed. The 
cohort was randomly divided into a training set (n=858, 70%) and a test set 
(n=368, 30%). Additionally, an independent external validation set, Dataset 4 
(n=266), was employed to evaluate the model's generalizability rigorously. We 
proposed a set of multiperspective tumor heterogeneity metrics by integrating 
local features and global pixel distribution patterns on CT images. 
Subsequently, a comprehensive assessment of 11 machine-learning models was 
performed, integrating clinicoradiological features with these novel tumor 
heterogeneity metrics to construct the integrative clinicoradiological 
multiperspective heterogeneity hybrid machine-learning framework (ICMH-HF).
RESULTS: The light gradient boosting machine demonstrated superior performance 
and was subsequently selected as the core classifier for the ICMH-HF model. This 
choice underpinned remarkable predictive accuracy, with area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.835 in the test set and 0.786 
in the external validation set. SHAP-based interpretability analysis identified 
four key predictors that collectively enhanced the model's robustness.
CONCLUSION: The ICMH-HF effectively combines quantitative clinicoradiological 
features with multiperspective tumor heterogeneity metrics. The proposed 
framework provides a potent and clinically applicable tool for the preoperative 
discrimination between Grade 1 and Grades 2-3 lung adenocarcinomas according to 
the IASLC grading system.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in 
influencing tumor progression and responses to therapy, shaped by both inherent 
tumor features and external factors. We aim to develop a pipeline that computes 
tumor subtypes and growth patterns based on nuclear shape, spatial arrangement, 
and protein measurements in preclinical models. Preclinical models enable the 
investigation of exogenous perturbations on tumor development. In this context, 
accurately segmenting and classifying nuclei is vital. The main challenges 
include: (i) the presence of densely packed nuclei, and (ii) the need to 
characterize tumor diversity across a large set of mouse-derived tumor samples.
METHOD: The computational pipeline requires methods for nuclear segmentation and 
tumor heterogeneity characterization. For robust segmentation of nuclei, we 
developed LoG-based Saliency for Guided Encoding with Convolutional Block 
Attention Module (LoGSAGE-CBAM), a dual-encoder segmentation model that combines 
a Swin Transformer with a saliency encoder based on Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) 
response. The outputs of these encoders are then fused through a CBAM module, 
and the model is trained with a curvature-aware loss function. Subsequently, the 
immune cells are classified, and their locations are recorded. To capture the 
tumor spectrum, cellular responses and localizations are binarized, and tumor 
subtypes are identified, which are then associated with preclinical variables 
using Cox regression.
RESULTS: The integrated computational pipeline identified four stable tumor 
subtypes in 184 tumor-derived mice using computed indices from 2168,733 nuclei. 
At the same time, the LoGSAGE-CBAM achieved a segmentation performance with Dice 
95.5 and RCE: 86.6. One of the subtypes is enriched in K14+ tumors and CD8+ 
lymphocytes and is associated with longer latency.
CONCLUSION: The proposed computational pipeline can provide both novel insights 
and automation for biomarker discovery in preclinical studies and pharmaceutical 
research.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the proportion of patients diagnosed with high-grade 
serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) who had prior abdominal or pelvic surgery and may 
have benefited from opportunistic salpingectomy.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used a single institution's Outcomes in 
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer research database to identify patients diagnosed with 
HGSOC from 2014 to 2021. Data abstracted from electronic medical records 
included demographics, FIGO stage, HBOC testing, prior abdominal and pelvic 
surgeries, index surgery subspecialty, and surgical mode (open vs minimally 
invasive). Eligible surgeries occurred ≥6 months before diagnosis, were 
non-emergent, and performed after childbearing completion (assumed in those 
≥45 years, after permanent sterilization, or following last childbirth). 
Descriptive statistics were used.
RESULTS: Among 605 patients with HGSOC, 342 (56.5 %) had ≥1 prior abdominal or 
pelvic surgery. There were 500 unique index surgical episodes with a median of 
30.0 years (IQR 19.4-37.7) between the first index surgery and HGSOC diagnosis. 
Most index surgeries were performed by gynecology (59.4 %) or general surgery 
(35.2 %). The most common gynecologic procedure was tubal ligation (98/297; 
33.0 %), and the most common general surgery procedure was cholecystectomy 
(94/176; 53.4 %).
CONCLUSION: Nearly 60 % of patients with HGSOC had a prior surgical opportunity 
for risk reduction via opportunistic salpingectomy, often decades before 
diagnosis. Future studies should explore incorporating salpingectomy into 
non-gynecologic surgeries to expand ovarian cancer risk reduction for 
average-risk women.

Identifying the potential miRNA-disease association (MDA) has a greater impetus 
to the development of drug prevention, treatment and other fields. For the 
traditional prediction methods, they are characterized by long time and large 
cost. With the continuous development of bioinformatics, the prediction of MDA 
using computational methods can better advance the human development in the 
field of MDA. The existing computational methods, on the other hand, usually 
have the disadvantages of low prediction accuracy, weak generalization ability 
and single data used. In order to better develop the association information and 
mine the problem of association information between multiple nodes, we propose a 
new method: HGC-GraphT. Firstly, for solving the problem of single data, the 
method introduces new multi-source similarity information by introducing new 
similarity information from multiple sources, such as drug-disease association 
information, protein information, circRNA information and LncRNA information. At 
the same time, in order to better mine the problem of association information 
between multiple nodes, this method helps to mine more edge information by 
constructing a hypergraph, and uses hypergraph convolutional neural network to 
fully obtain the attribute features within the hypergraph. Then for the problem 
that a single model extracts information in a sparse way and the reliability of 
the information is questionable, we add a biological entity graph to supplement 
the problem of the model acquiring a single feature. Finally, we use a 
multilayer perceptron to predict unknown miRNA-disease correlation scores. To 
validate the effectiveness of the method, we conducted a series of experiments 
using the human microRNA disease database HMDD v3.2. The results of the 
experiments show that the prediction performance of HGC-GraphT outperforms the 
other five compared methods in terms of AUC, AUPR, ACC, F1 score, recall and 
precision. In addition, case studies have shown that HGC-GraphT can accurately 
predict miRNAs associated with colon cancer and gastrointestinal tumors. In 
conclusion, the HGC-GraphT method proposed in this paper can effectively predict 
miRNA-disease associations and has a reliable auxiliary function for biomedical 
research.

Natural killer (NK) cells serve as critical first responders within the immune 
system, orchestrating antitumor responses by directly eliminating malignant 
cells and modulating broader immune functions. Their capacity to recognize 
stressed targets without MHC-restricted neoantigen presentation, together with a 
favorable safety profile, underpins growing enthusiasm for NK cell‑based 
therapeutics. Nonetheless, the clinical efficacy of NK-cell-based therapies in 
solid tumor has been hindered by tumor microenvironment (TME)-driven 
immunosuppression, metabolic competition, and cell-intrinsic exhaustion 
mechanisms. In this review, we outline the journey from the discovery of NK 
cells to their role as a breakthrough target in cancer immunotherapy. We then 
provide a comprehensive framework of NK cell biology, from homeostatic 
regulation to TME-driven epigenetic, transcriptional, and metabolic adaptations. 
Notably, we discuss recent investigations into NK cell subset heterogeneity and 
their interactions with tumor cells, immune cells and the gut microbiome. 
Finally, we critically evaluated clinical progress while highlighting the 
imperative for rationally designed, mechanism-based combinations that address 
tumor escape pathways. The review concludes with a forward-looking perspective 
on engineering solutions to unlock the full therapeutic potential of NK cells 
across solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.

BACKGROUND: It is unclear how social determinants of health (SDoH) impact 
short-term outcomes following gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: Patients with stages I-III gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent 
gastrectomy were identified in the National Cancer Database. Adjusted regression 
analyses identified SDoH (race, insurance, income, education) associated with 
length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality.
RESULTS: Among 22,341 patients, the median age was 66 years and 68.5 ​% were 
White. Extended LOS was less likely among Black (OR ​= ​0.75; 95 %CI:0.69-0.82), 
Hispanic (OR ​= ​0.71; 95 %CI:0.65-0.79), and Asian patients (OR ​= ​0.50; 95 
%CI:0.45-0.56) compared to White patients, and less likely among patients from 
high-income rather than low-income regions (OR ​= ​0.76; 95 %CI:0.69-0.85). Both 
extended LOS (OR ​= ​1.19; 95 %CI:1.06-1.33) and readmission (OR ​= ​1.26; 95 
%CI:1.07-1.49) were more likely among patients with higher rather than lower 
regional education levels. Mortality was less likely among Asian than White 
patients (OR ​= ​0.60; 95 %CI:0.42-0.87).
CONCLUSION: Improving education and anticipating postoperative needs may lead to 
less disparate outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Surgery remains controversial in de novo stage IV breast cancer. We 
examined differential impact of surgery on survival outcomes among a surgical 
cohort of stage IV patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed stage IV patients treated with surgery 
(2014-2022) and evaluated impact of metastatic disease burden and site on 
survival outcomes. LRT receipt at metastatic site included surgical resection, 
ablation, and/or radiation therapy.
RESULTS: Of 165 patients, metastatic burden ranged from 40.0 ​% (66) solitary [1 
lesion], 32.7 ​% (54) oligometastatic [2-3 lesions], and 27.3 ​% (45) multiple 
[≥4 lesions]. Metastatic site consisted of 38.2 ​% (63) bone-only, 25.5 ​% (42) 
soft tissue/lymph node, and 36.4 ​% (60) visceral. 67.9 ​% (112) received 
therapy at a distant metastatic site. Triple negative subtype and multiple 
metastatic lesions were poor prognostic factors while soft tissue/lymph node 
involvement was associated with improved prognosis. LRT receipt at metastatic 
site did not impact survival outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival can be achieved in select patients with de novo 
stage IV breast cancer treated with multimodal therapy.

Esophageal fistulas (EFs) arising from esophageal cancer, trauma, or iatrogenic 
injury can lead to severe complications. While covered metal stents can 
effectively occlude EFs, their long-term implantation may result in migration, 
in-stent stenosis, and bleeding. Biodegradable covered stents offer temporary 
support followed by self-degradation to circumvent permanent implantation risks, 
therefore can act as local biotherapeutic platforms. We have developed a novel 
biodegradable, biomimetic stent composed of polydioxanone with a hydrogel 
coating and oriented, TGF-β1-loaded nanofiber membrane. It provides up to 6.92 N 
of radial support force and maintains integrity for 30 days. Employing microsol 
oriented electrospinning technology, TGF-β1-loaded nanofibers are applied to the 
stent's surface, not only occluding the EF but also creating a directional 
matrix for stem cell migration and tissue repair. Additionally, GelMA laden with 
autologous BMSCs encapsulates the PLGA nanofibers, with BMSCs showing oriented 
growth and differentiation into myoblasts upon TGF-β1 stimulation. In a rabbit 
EF model, this biomimetic esophageal stent significantly lowered fistula 
incidence. Esophagography and histopathological assessments revealed complete EF 
occlusion in 78 % of subjects. These findings suggest that our biomimetic 
esophageal stent not only supports and seals the esophagus but also promotes 
self-repair and tissue regeneration, advancing the application of biodegradable 
stents for EF treatment.

Breast cancer detection, and broadly medical object detection, revolves around 
discovering and rating lesions. One of the most common ways of measuring 
performance is FROC (Free-response Receiver Operating Characteristic), which 
calculates sensitivity at predefined thresholds of false positives per case. 
However, depending on the clinical context, not all lesions might be of 
equivocal impact on the long-term outcome of a patient. Some lesions missed e.g. 
in screening might be detected in the subsequent screening round without 
impacting the clinical prognosis, whilst missing others might significantly 
detoriate prognosis and treatment pathways. It is therefore desirable to develop 
and include consideration of clinical prognosis/risk imbalance in the way 
machine learning models are developed and evaluated. In this work, we propose 
risk-adjusted FROC (raFROC), an adaptation of FROC that constitutes a first step 
on reflecting the underlying clinical need more accurately. Experiments on two 
independent breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets with a total of 
1535 lesions in 1735 subjects showcase the clinical potential of the proposed 
metric and its advantages over traditional evaluation methods. Additionally, by 
utilizing a risk-adjusted adaptation of focal loss (raFocal) we are able to 
improve the raFROC results and patient-level performance of nnDetection, at no 
expense of the regular FROC.

BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies suggest that cancer cells take up oxidized 
vitamin C (dehydroascorbate, DHA) via the GLUT1 transporter, leading to 
oxidative stress and glutathione depletion. This mechanism may offer a 
therapeutic strategy for KRAS-mutated cancers. This Phase IB trial evaluated 
high-dose intravenous ascorbic acid (AA) combined with nab-paclitaxel, 
cisplatin, and gemcitabine (NABPLAGEM) in patients with untreated metastatic 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
METHODS: Eligible patients (≥18 years, ECOG 0-1, measurable PDAC, adequate organ 
function) received AA (25, 37.5, or 56.25 g/m2 twice weekly) plus NABPLAGEM on 
Days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles. The primary endpoint was determining the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) of AA.
RESULTS: Seventeen patients were enrolled (median age 63.9; 70.6 % female; 
82.4 % white). No MTD was reached; AA up to 56.25 g/m2 twice weekly was 
feasible. Patients on the lowest AA dose remained on treatment longer. Grade ≥3 
treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) included thrombocytopenia (82.4 %), 
anemia (35.3 %), neutropenia (29.4 %), hypokalemia (29.4 %), diarrhea (11.8 %), 
and colitis (11.8 %), with no significant differences between dose groups. Peak 
AA levels >20 mM were achieved in 57 % of patients at the highest dose. Median 
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 7.1 and 14.2 
months, respectively, with no significant differences by AA dose. Textural 
imaging showed decreased liver fat in 3 of 4 patients with baseline steatosis.
CONCLUSION: High-dose AA with NABPLAGEM was tolerable in patients with advanced 
PDAC but did not improve disease response compared to historical data for 
chemotherapy alone. A separate study suggests AA may enhance gemcitabine and 
nab-paclitaxel efficacy without cisplatin. AA and cisplatin may have overlapping 
DNA-damaging effects, or differences in AA dosing frequency and exposure may 
influence outcomes - variables to consider in future trials.

UV radiation penetrating human skin causes DNA damages, including specific 
mutations, redox imbalances, oxidative damage to macromolecules, and 
consequently changes in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those 
involved in inflammation, cell differentiation, and survival. These metabolic 
changes may ultimately contribute to the development of skin cancers, including 
melanoma, the most lethal form, as well as other types of skin cancer. Although 
the link between climate change - a complex, multifactorial process that raises 
growing concerns about increased skin exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation - 
and the development of skin cancers has not yet been fully explored, the issue 
is gaining attention. Intensive and multifaceted research is underway to 
identify natural compounds with anticancer, preventive, and regenerative 
properties. This review highlights promising natural compounds (catechins, 
procyanidin C1, piperitoside, and mulberrofurans), some of which are already 
known to have effects on skin cancers. Their common feature is the ability to 
regulate redox signaling and inflammation, which play key roles in both the 
prevention and treatment of skin cancer.

University, Beijing, China.

ObjectiveManaging end-of-life (EOL) patients with cancer has always been a major 
challenge in healthcare. Previous studies have highlighted the need for 
individualized EOL treatment and the importance of avoiding overtreatment. 
However, accurately identifying EOL patients with cancer to provide appropriate 
care and improve their quality of life remains an unresolved issue.MethodsThis 
study was based on investigation on Nutrition Status and Clinical Outcomes of 
Common Cancer (INSCOC) cohort. Machine-learning methods analyzed the 
characteristics of EOL patients with cancer and identified the determinants 
associated with EOL risk. Population-attributable fractions, least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis, random forest, and 
logistic regression (LR) analysis were used to screen predictive indicators for 
EOL risk. LR, support vector machines, generalized linear models, gradient 
boosting machine, random forests, and artificial neural networks were then used 
to construct models based on the identified risk factors.ResultsIn total, 17,013 
patients from the INSCOC cohort (including 1109 EOL patients) were analyzed. LR 
was the best-performing machine-learning model, and factors such as advanced 
stage, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, malnutrition, hypoalbuminemia, poor 
self-health assessment, limited mobility, prognostic nutritional index, lack of 
appetite, and cancer location were the key determinants of EOL 
risk.ConclusionThe findings of this study provide valuable insights for clinical 
practice, indicating potential pathways for the more precise management of 
patients with EOL cancer. Through timely identification and intervention of the 
identified risk factors, the risk of EOL in these patients may be reduced and 
their prognosis can be improved.

Imaging Sensing of Cadmium-Induced Single Cancer Stem Cells in Tumor Spheroid 
Fabricated by 3D Bioprinting.

This study investigates the formation of cadmium-induced CSCs within individual 
HepG2 tumor spheroids, which are fabricated using 3D bioprinting of HepG2 cancer 
cell-laden hydrogel composed of alginate and gelatin. The quantification of 
cadmium-induced single CSCs in single spheroids was performed through multicolor 
single-cell 3D imaging of CSC biomarkers, without the need to isolate spheroids 
from the hydrogel. Single HepG2 CSCs exhibiting the aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 
(ALDH1)+/CD133+ phenotype were detected. The percentage of CSCs in the spheroids 
increased proportionally with the concentration of cadmium exposure. 
Additionally, the number of CSCs expressing Nanog and clusterin also increased 
in response to higher cadmium concentrations. Flow cytometric quantification of 
cadmium-induced CSCs isolated from single spheroids in the hydrogel yielded 
results similar to those obtained through single-cell imaging of CSCs within 
spheroids. This similarity underscores the reliability of this multicolor 
single-cell imaging technique for detecting cadmium-induced CSCs in spheroids. 
Overall, this study demonstrates that intact single-cell imaging of 3D 
bioprinted tumor spheroids is a powerful tool for illustrating the risk of 
developing drug-resistant CSCs upon exposure to carcinogens such as cadmium.

BACKGROUND: Manual review of electronic health records for clinical research is 
labor-intensive and prone to reviewer-dependent variations. Large language 
models (LLMs) offer potential for automated clinical data extraction; however, 
their feasibility in surgical oncology remains underexplored.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of 
LLM-based processing compared with manual physician review for extracting 
clinical data from breast cancer records.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective comparative study analyzing breast cancer 
records from 5 academic hospitals (January 2019-December 2019). Two data 
extraction pathways were compared: (1) manual physician review with direct 
electronic health record access (group 1: 1366/3100, 44.06%) and (2) LLM-based 
processing using Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic) on deidentified data 
automatically extracted through a clinical data warehouse platform (group 2: 
1734/3100, 55.94%). The automated extraction system provided prestructured, 
deidentified data sheets organized by clinical domains, which were then 
processed by the LLM. The LLM prompt was developed through a 3-phase iterative 
process over 2 days. Primary outcomes included missing value rates, extraction 
accuracy, and concordance between groups. Secondary outcomes included comparison 
with the Korean Breast Cancer Society national registry data, processing time, 
and resource use. Validation involved 50 stratified random samples per group 
(900 data points each), assessed by 4 breast surgical oncologists. Statistical 
analysis included chi-square tests, 2-tailed t tests, Cohen κ, and intraclass 
correlation coefficients. The accuracy threshold was set at 90%.
RESULTS: The LLM achieved 90.8% (817) accuracy in validation analysis. Missing 
data patterns differed between groups: group 2 showed better lymph node 
documentation (missing: 152/1734, 8.76% vs 294/1366, 21.52%) but higher missing 
rates for cancer staging (211/1734, 12.17% vs 43/1366, 3.15%). Both groups 
demonstrated similar breast-conserving surgery rates (1107/1734, 63.84% vs 
868/1366, 63.54%). Processing efficiency differed substantially: LLM processing 
required 12 days with 2 physicians versus 7 months with 5 physicians for manual 
review, representing a 91% reduction in physician hours (96 h vs 1025 h). The 
LLM group captured significantly more survival events (41 vs 11; P=.002). Stage 
distribution in the LLM group aligned better with national registry data (Cramér 
V=0.03 vs 0.07). Application programming interface costs totaled US $260 for 
1734 cases (US $0.15 per case).
CONCLUSIONS: LLM-based curation of automatically extracted, deidentified 
clinical data demonstrated comparable effectiveness to manual physician review 
while reducing processing time by 95% and physician hours by 91%. This 2-step 
approach-automated data extraction followed by LLM curation-addresses both 
privacy concerns and efficiency needs. Despite limitations in integrating 
multiple clinical events, this methodology offers a scalable solution for 
clinical data extraction in oncology research. The 90.8% accuracy rate and 
superior capture of survival events suggest that combining automated data 
extraction systems with LLM processing can accelerate retrospective clinical 
research while maintaining data quality and patient privacy.

PURPOSE: Real-world data (RWD) are critical for breast cancer (BC) research but 
are limited by privacy concerns, missing information, and data fragmentation. 
This study explores synthetic data (SD) generated through advanced generative 
models to address these challenges and create harmonized longitudinal data sets.
METHODS: A data set of 1052 patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 
2-positive and triple-negative BC from the Informatics for Integrating Biology 
and the Bedside (i2b2) platform was used. Advanced generative models, including 
generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and 
language models (LMs), were applied to generate synthetic longitudinal data sets 
replicating disease progression, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes. The 
Synthethic Validation Framework (SAFE) powered by Train was used to evaluate the 
fidelity, utility, and privacy. SD were tested across three settings: (1) 
integration with i2b2 for privacy-preserving data sets; (2) multistate disease 
modeling to predict clinical outcomes; and (3) generation of synthetic control 
groups for clinical trials.
RESULTS: The synthetic data sets exhibited high fidelity (score 0.94) and 
ensured privacy, with temporal patterns validated through time-series analyses 
and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection embeddings. In setting A, SD 
accurately mirrored RWD on the i2b2 platform while maintaining privacy. In 
setting B, incorporating SD improved the predictive performance of a multistate 
disease progression model, increasing the C-index by up to 10%. In setting C, SD 
replicated the end points of the APT trial, demonstrating its feasibility for 
generating synthetic control arms with preserved statistical properties of the 
real data set.
CONCLUSION: AI-generated longitudinal SD effectively address key challenges in 
RWD use in BC. This approach can improve translational research and clinical 
trial design while ensuring robust privacy protection. Integration with 
platforms such as i2b2 highlights their scalability and potential for broader 
applications in oncology.

Radioligand Therapy and Sequencing in Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine 
Tumors: A Patient Perspective Review.

Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are the most frequent 
subtype of NETs and their incidence has steadily increased over the past few 
decades. Patients with GEP-NETs often experience a large symptom burden and 
decrease in quality of life. Delays in diagnosis and high incidence of 
metastatic disease are the consequences of a lack of awareness or a lack of 
understanding of how to manage GEP-NETs among health care professionals. 
Although surgical resection is the only curative approach for GEP-NETs, many 
patients are not candidates for surgery. For these patients, new therapies have 
emerged recently, including radiolabeled therapeutic peptides used to target 
cancer cells and inhibit tumor growth. Radiolabeled somatostatin analogs, such 
as [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE (177Lu-DOTATATE), are often used in radioligand therapy 
(RLT). 177Lu-DOTATATE has been approved for the treatment of advanced GEP-NETs 
and has demonstrated efficacy and safety in clinical trials as well as in 
real-world studies. With the emergence of RLT for the management of GEP-NETs, 
treatment sequencing is of increasing importance. Considering the perspectives 
of patients with GEP-NETs on using RLT in their treatment journey is not only 
key to understanding and allaying their concerns regarding the safety of RLT but 
is also important in helping to identify patient priorities of treatment 
attributes. This review aims to identify the factors influencing patients 
considering RLT, their perceptions regarding treatment sequence options, the 
barriers in RLT access, and the disparities (eg, racial, geographical) among 
patients with GEP-NETs in accessing care.

PURPOSE: The atlas of immune microenvironment at single-cell level in 
BRCA1/2-mutated breast cancer is largely unknown and whether an immune signature 
on the basis of single-cell atlas is associated with response to neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy remains to be investigated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The immune microenvironment between BRCA1/2-mutated and 
BRCA wild-type breast tumors was explored using single-cell RNA sequencing 
(scRNA-seq) assay and was validated in an independent cohort of 40 BRCA1/2 
carriers and 56 noncarriers via immunohistochemistry assay (IHC). Bulk RNA-seq 
was performed using RNA extracted from fresh-frozen pretreatment core-needle 
tumor tissues in 80 BRCA1/2 carriers with operable primary human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2-negative tumors who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 
and the associations between immune cell subtypes defined by scRNA-seq and 
pathologic complete response (pCR) were investigated.
RESULTS: BRCA1/2-mutated tumors exhibited an enriched immune microenvironment 
compared with the wild-type counterparts at single-cell level, particularly 
regulatory T cells and exhausted T cells, which were validated in the IHC 
cohort. Among the neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort of 80 BRCA1/2 carriers, 36.2% 
achieved a pCR. We established an immune signature on the basis of the 
single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data, named BRCA-IM. The BRCA-IM model exhibited an 
excellent prediction of pCR in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort, with AUC 
values of 0.81(95% CI, 0.69 to 0.92) in the training set and 0.91(95% CI, 0.79 
to 1.00) in the test set, respectively; and the BRCA-IM model remained as an 
independent predictor for pCR after adjusting for other factors. Moreover, 
higher BRCA-IM scores were significantly associated with more favorable survival 
in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort.
CONCLUSION: BRCA1/2-mutated breast cancer shows an enriched tumor immune 
microenvironment, and the BRCA-IM model exhibits a good performance in 
prediction of pCR in BRCA1/2-mutated tumors.

PURPOSE: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs, age 15-39 years) with cancer are 
vulnerable to the harmful effects of cancer-related financial hardship. Our 
objective was to describe financial distress screening and financial navigation 
across National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) 
practices treating AYAs with cancer.
METHODS: The 2022 NCORP Landscape Assessment was developed and refined by an 
expert committee to assess infrastructure and capacity to conduct oncology 
research. Survey items specific to financial distress screening and 
cancer-specific financial navigation were compared on the basis of practice and 
patient characteristics among practices treating AYAs.
RESULTS: A total of 271 NCORP practices (45 of 46 NCORP sites; 517 of 1,000+ 
discrete clinics) responded to the survey April through June 2022. One-hundred 
practices (37.0%) were characterized as treating AYAs. Most practices reported 
routinely screening for financial distress (82.0%) via social worker evaluation 
(57.0%). Financial concerns were addressed via social workers (81.0%), 
cancer-specific financial navigation (47.0%), billing staff (46.0%), general 
financial navigation (35.0%), or outside case management (31.0%). A lower 
proportion of practices with access to cancer-specific financial navigation 
reported having a dedicated AYA program (10.6% v 28.3%, odds ratio [OR], 0.30 
[95% CI, 0.10 to 0.91]; P = .028) or treating >30% of patients insured by 
Medicaid (6.4% v 26.4%, OR, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.05 to 0.71]; P = .008) compared with 
those without cancer-specific financial navigation.
CONCLUSION: Although most NCORP practices treating AYAs reported routinely 
screening for financial distress, only one half of practices offer 
cancer-specific financial navigation. Practices treating a higher percentage of 
patients at greatest risk for financial hardship have less access to 
cancer-specific financial navigation. Further research is needed to support 
expansion of financial navigation services among community oncology practices 
that treat AYAs.

Despite the pleiotropic anticancer potential of the endogenous gasotransmitter 
hydrogen sulfide (H2S), achieving sustained and adequate intratumoral H2S supply 
remains a persistent challenge, hindering its advancement as a stand-alone 
therapeutic modality. Herein, we introduce cross-linked lipoic acid trisulfide 
nanoparticles (cLATN) that integrate both the H2S donor and transporter within a 
single precursor, wherein each unit theoretically yields one molecule of H2S, 
enabling stoichiometric H2S loading. cLATN effectively enter tumor cells via 
thiol-mediated uptake and are depolymerized by glutathione to trigger sufficient 
H2S release in tumor tissues for more than 48 h, far surpassing current 
H2S-based anticancer agents, which generally persist for only a few hours. 
Therapeutically, cLATN achieve an impressive tumor inhibition rate of 83% with 
favorable biocompatibility, far exceeding the clinical agent doxorubicin in both 
efficacy and safety. This work affirms its potential for cancer treatment, 
renewing interest in positioning H2S intervention as a stand-alone modality 
toward broader clinics.

The Watson-Crick-Franklin (WCF) rules describing nucleobase pairing in 
antiparallel strands of DNA and RNA can be exploited to create artificially 
expanded genetic information systems (AEGIS) with as many as 12 independently 
replicable nucleotides joined by six hydrogen bond pairing schemes. One of these 
additional pairs joins two nucleotides trivially designated as Z 
(6-amino-5-nitro-(1H)-pyridin-2-one) and P 
(2-amino-imidazo-[1,2-a]-1,3,5-triazin-(8H)-4-one). The Z:P pair has supported 
6-nucleotide PCR to give diagnostics products, in environmental surveillance 
kits, and for laboratory in vitro evolution (LIVE) that has generated, inter 
alia, molecules that inactivate toxins, antibody analogs that bind cancer cells, 
therapeutic candidates that deliver drugs to those cells, reagents to identify 
targets on those cells' surfaces, reagents to move cargoes across the 
blood-brain barrier, and catalysts with ribonuclease activity. However, the Z 
nucleoside is acidic, with a pKa of ∼7.8. In its deprotonated form, Z- forms a 
WCF pair with G. This leads to the slow replacement of Z:P pairs by C:G pairs 
during PCR or, in the reverse process, their introduction. Here, we examine 
analogs of Z that retain the same donor:donor:acceptor hydrogen bonding pattern 
as earlier generations of the Z heterocycle, still form a WCF pair with P, but 
have a higher pKa. Experiments with Taq polymerase show that the rate of loss of 
Z:P pairs decreases markedly as the pKa of the Z heterocycle increases. This 
provides direct support for the hypothesis that Z:P pairs are in fact lost via 
deprotonated Z-:G mismatches. Further, it provides a Z:P system that can be 
replicated with very high fidelity, with >97% retention of the Z:P pairs over 
10,000-fold amplification.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol use is increasing in Wisconsin. We aimed to improve a state 
public health campaign around youth drinking to increase awareness of alcohol as 
a carcinogen.
METHODS: The campaign was expanded and distributed via targeted social media 
advertisements and a directed campaign in a Wisconsin county with high rates of 
alcohol consumption.
RESULTS: The media campaign outperformed benchmarks by 23.6%, delivering 1.65 
million impressions. Total billboard impressions exceeded expectations by 46%. 
Across all digital tactics, there was a collective click-through rate of 0.42%. 
Facebook had the largest audience with over 128 000 total impressions, exceeding 
expectations by 28%. Cancer-specific related messaging engaged slightly higher 
click-through rates among Facebook audiences than impact messaging (0.47% vs 
0.36%).
DISCUSSION: Adding cancer-related messaging was effective in this expanded 
Wisconsin state youth drinking campaign.

INTRODUCTION: Risk-based screening (RBS) has emerged as a promising alternative 
to age-based cancer screening. However, evidence regarding real-world 
implementation outcomes remains fragmented. Thus, a systematic review was 
conducted to evaluate the implementation metho-dologies and outcomes of RBS 
programmes across different cancer types.
METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials and Scopus were systematically searched from their respective 
dates of inception up to 8 July 2024. Prospective and rando-mised controlled 
trials (RCTs), which implement the RBS of cancer in an asymptomatic population, 
or studies retrospectively evaluating the outcomes of the same were included. 
Geographic distribution, population characteristics, RBS methodology, diagnostic 
accuracy and clinical outcomes were narratively synthesised.
RESULTS: Among the 33 included studies (i.e. 21 prospective cohort, 8 RCTs, 3 
retrospective and 1 non-RCT), sample sizes ranged from 102 to 1,429,890 
participants. Most RBS trials were conducted in China (n=7, 21.2%), followed by 
the Netherlands (n=4, 12.1%) then the US, Australia and Sweden (n=3, 9.8%). 
Studies predominantly examined colorectal (27.3%), breast (21.2%) and prostate 
cancer (18.2%). Three main stratification approaches emerged: algorithmic 
(48.5%), validated risk models (39.4%) and physician assessment (9.1%). 
Implementation outcomes showed higher uptake in moderate-risk (75.4%) compared 
to high-risk (71.3%) and low-risk groups (67.9%). Five studies demonstrated 
cost-effectiveness with increased quality-adjusted life years, while 12 studies 
showed superior or non-inferior cancer detection rates compared to traditional 
screening.
CONCLUSION: The RBS of cancer has the potential to optimise healthcare resource 
allocation while minimising harm and increasing receptiveness for patients. More 
work is needed to evaluate long-term outcomes prior to the scaling of RBS 
programmes.

Folate metabolism is intricately linked to purine de novo synthesis through the 
incorporation of folate-derived one-carbon units into the purine scaffold. By 
investigating chemical and genetic dependencies caused by mutations in 
methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, cyclohydrolase and 
formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase 1 (MTHFD1), we discovered a key role for Nudix 
hydrolase 5 (NUDT5) in regulating purine de novo synthesis. Genetic depletion 
and selective chemical degradation showed that a scaffolding role, rather than 
NUDT5 enzymatic activity, was causing this phenotype. NUDT5 interacted with 
phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT), the rate-limiting enzyme 
of purine de novo synthesis, to repress the pathway in response to increased 
purine abundance. Through this mechanism, loss of NUDT5 mediates resistance to 
purine analogs in cancer treatment and prevents adenosine toxicity in MTHFD1 
deficiency.

The origin of cancer is poorly understood because premalignant cells are rarely 
followed in their native environments. While the spatial compartmentalization of 
metabolic functions is critical for proper liver function, it is unknown if 
cancers arise from some zones but not others, and if there are metabolic 
determinants of cancer risk. Zone-specific, mosaic introduction of Ctnnb1 and 
Arid2 mutations, commonly co-mutated genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 
showed that position and metabolic context determine clone fates. 
Ctnnb1/Arid2-driven cancers were much more likely to arise in zone 3. The zone 3 
genes Gstm2 and Gstm3 were required for efficient HCC initiation, in part 
through inhibition of ferroptosis. In the liver, the zonal determinants of HCC 
development can reveal metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer.

Homologous recombination repairs DNA double strand breaks and protects stalled 
replication forks, but how the five RAD51 paralogs contribute to these processes 
remains unclear. Mutations in the RAD51 paralogs are linked to heritable breast 
and ovarian cancers and the cancer-prone disease Fanconi anemia. In this work, 
we show that the RAD51 paralogs assemble into two distinct heterotetrameric 
complexes, RAD51B-RAD51C-RAD51D-XRCC2 (RAD51B complex) and 
XRCC3-RAD51C-RAD51D-XRCC2 (XRCC3 complex). The RAD51B complex promotes dynamic 
adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis-dependent assembly of RAD51 filaments, whereas 
the XRCC3 complex stably caps the 5'-termini of RAD51 filaments to promote 
homologous pairing, as visualized by cryo-electron microscopy. Highly conserved 
across evolution, these complexes reveal insights into RAD51 filament formation 
and capping during DNA repair and replication fork stabilization.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess temporal trends, health inequities and 
potential improvements in the burden of head and neck cancer (HNC) in 
middle-aged and older adults between 1990 and 2021, focusing on three major 
subtypes: larynx, nasopharynx, and lip/oral cavity cancers.
METHODS: A secondary analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2021 
was performed, using age-standardised incidence rates (ASIR) and 
age-standardised disability-adjusted life years (ASDR) to quantify the burden of 
HNC. The average annual percent change was calculated to analyzed trends. The 
slope index of inequality (SII) and the concentration index quantified health 
inequities. Frontier analysis identified regions with potential for improvement.
RESULT: In 2021, there were approximately 650,205 new cases of overall HNC 
globally, resulting in 9,621,610 DALYs, with ASIR and ASDR both declining since 
1990. ASIR exhibited a decrease for laryngeal and nasopharyngeal cancers, in 
contrast to an increase for lip and oral cavity cancers. ASDR decreased across 
all cancer types. The SII showed a notable shift in ASDR from countries with 
higher socio-demographic indices (SDI) in 1990 to those with lower SDI countries 
by 2021. Meantime, the concentration index revealed a worsening inequality in 
lower SDI countries. Frontier analyses across 204 countries and territories 
indicated that certain high SDI countries could effectively reduce ASDR for 
HNCs.
CONCLUSION: The global burden of HNCs shown considerable regional disparities. 
Health inequalities have persisted, with lower SDI regions bearing a heavier 
burden, particularly in laryngeal and lip/oral cavity cancers. Developing 
tailored national cancer control plans and enhancing international medical 
cooperation are essential to reduce HNC burden and promote equitable health 
outcomes.

APDCA: An accurate and effective method for predicting associations between RBPs 
and AS-events during epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

MOTIVATION: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a key role in cancer 
metastasis by promoting changes in adhesion and motility. RNA-binding proteins 
(RBPs) regulate alternative splicing (AS) during EMT, enabling a single gene to 
produce multiple protein isoforms that affect tumor progression. Disruption of 
RBP-AS interactions may disrupt the progress of diseases like cancer. Despite 
the importance of RBP-AS relationships in EMT, few computational methods predict 
these associations. Existing models struggle in sparse settings with limited 
known associations. To improve performance, we incorporate both sparsity 
constraints and heterogeneous biological data to infer RBP-AS associations.
RESULT: We propose a new method based on Accelerated Proximal DC Algorithm 
(APDCA) for predicting RBP-AS associations. In particular, APDCA combines sparse 
low-rank matrix factorization with a Difference-of-Convex (DC) optimization 
framework and uses extrapolation to improve convergence. A key feature of APDCA 
is the use of a sparsity constraint, which filters out noise and highlights key 
associations. In addition, integrating multiple related data sources with direct 
or indirect relationships can help in reaching a more comprehensive view of RBPs 
and AS events and to reduce the impact of false positives associated with 
individual data sources. we prove that our proposed algorithm is convergent 
under some conditions and the experimental results have illustrated that APDCA 
outperforms six baseline methods in both AUC and AUPR. A case study on the RBP 
QKI shows that the top predictions are verified by the OncoSplicing database. 
Thus, APDCA provides a fast, interpretable, and scalable tool for discovering 
post-transcriptional regulatory interactions.

This study presents the perceived implementability of the digital Hospital-Based 
Cancer Registry (HBCR) and the Adapted-Resource Implementation Application 
(ARIA) to enhance data systems and treatment standards at Pediatric Oncology 
unit (POU). A 2-year (2023-2025) implementation study on the integrated 
application of ARIA and HBCRs is being conducted at Jimma University Medical 
Center (JUMC) and St. Paul Hospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC). This 
article reports the formative assessment results, guided by the Consolidated 
Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), involved eight focus group 
discussions, four in-depth interviews, and two co-design workshops with diverse 
healthcare providers and hospital management/leadership personnel. The 
integrated implementation of HBCR-ARIA was viewed as innovative and adaptable. 
Digital HBCR was perceived as more effective than manual methods for managing 
pediatric oncology data. Similarly, ARIA was perceived as effective and feasible 
for providing patient-specific standardized care. Workflows and responsibilities 
were co-defined separately for the respective POUs. The co-designed 
implementation strategy includes residents filling demographic and diagnostic 
information of patients' on HBCR interim document and then cross-checked by the 
pediatric Hematology and Oncology (PHO) fellows. The Medical Monitor (PHO 
senior) approves the validity of the document before entry into REDCap by the 
data clerk. ARIA is filled by PHO fellows and approved by second PHO fellow or 
PHO seniors based on the availability. Facilitators in both the inner (hospital) 
and outer (external) settings outweighed the barriers. Facilities and motivated 
human resources are in place to implement the digital HBCR and ARIA strategies 
at the respective POU. However, challenges such as inconsistent electric power, 
unreliable internet services, and logistic-supply issues. The implementation 
strategies for digitized HBCR and ARIA, co-designed to fit the specific contexts 
of two POU, appear promising but require further evaluation.

Cancer cachexia causes severe muscle wasting, and current treatments remain 
limited. Belt-type electrical muscle stimulation (bEMS) has emerged as a passive 
rehabilitation tool capable of activating multiple lower limb muscles 
simultaneously. We investigated whether bEMS prevents muscle wasting and 
improves functional outcomes in rats with cancer cachexia. Cancer cachexia was 
induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by intraperitoneal injection of AH130 
Yoshida hepatoma cells. Acute and chronic effects of bEMS were tested. Muscle 
protein synthesis was evaluated using the SUnSET method, and muscle fiber 
cross-sectional area (CSA) and ankle torque were measured after chronic 
stimulation. bEMS increased puromycin-labeled protein levels on day 3 
post-injection (~1.5-2.0 fold; p < 0.05). After 10 days, bEMS mitigated 
reductions in muscle CSA in the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior compared to 
the cachexia group. However, muscle strength (ankle torque) was not 
significantly improved. bEMS preserved muscle fiber size in cancer cachexia but 
failed to restore muscle function. These findings suggest bEMS may serve as a 
supportive strategy against muscle atrophy in cachectic conditions.

Cuproptosis-Related lncRNA Risk Model for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Prognosis and 
Immunotherapy Response.

Zhuo Z, Guo Z, Peng H, Ye X, Wang J, Lv W.

BACKGROUND: Cuproptosis is a type of cell death caused by copper imbalance 
associated with the growth and proliferation of cancer cells. Long noncoding 
RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
development. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of cuproptosis-related 
lncRNAs in the clinical prognostic prediction and immunotherapy for HCC.
METHODS: A correlation network between lncRNAs and cuproptosis-related genes in 
HCC was constructed by conducting co-expression and Cox regression analyses. 
LASSO-Cox analysis was used to obtain lncRNAs that constitute the 
cuproptosis-associated lncRNA signature, which was then used to predict patient 
prognosis and immunotherapy response. To verify the clinical applicability of 
the risk model, a nomogram was constructed and an anti-neoplastic drug 
sensitivity analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Four cuproptosis-related lncRNAs (AL590705.3, SPRY4-AS1, AC135050.5, 
and AL031985.3) were identified and used to develop a prognostic signature for 
HCC. Based on the four lncRNAs, a risk prediction model was established. For 
overall survival (OS) in HCC patients, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for 
the risk score was 0.715, outperforming traditional clinical factors such as age 
(AUC=0.531), gender (AUC=0.509), and stage (AUC=0.671). High-risk patients had 
worse overall survival, progression-free survival, and higher mortality. 
Independent ROC analysis, nomogram-based modeling, and concordance index 
analysis indicated that the risk model has high predictive accuracy for HCC.
CONCLUSIONS: This model demonstrates potential in predicting prognosis, and 
offers novel insights to the treatment and management of HCC. Our study suggests 
that lncRNAs may serve as a novel biomarker and potential therapeutic target for 
HCC.

BACKGROUND Human papilloma virus (HPV)-16 and HPV-18 are the main high-risk 
types associated with anogenital cancers. Although the anus and rectum 
constitute reservoirs for persistent high-risk HPV infection, particularly in 
individuals with a history of receptive anal intercourse, clinical implications 
remain underrecognized. Current screening focuses on high-risk groups such as 
men who have sex with men, human immunodeficiency virus-positive individuals, 
and immunosuppressed populations; other at-risk groups, including heterosexual 
women with anal intercourse exposure, are largely underrecognized. CASE REPORT 
We encountered a rare case of HPV-positive rectal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) 
in a 59-year-old heterosexual woman with no history of anal cancer, 
immunosuppression, or other established risk factors. The patient exhibited 
intermittent rectal bleeding and recent changes in bowel habits. Digital rectal 
examination revealed a firm, fixed mass approximately 3 to 4 cm from the anal 
verge. Colonoscopy demonstrated a partially circumferential, fungating, 
non-obstructing mass involving nearly one-third of the rectal lumen. 
Histopathological analysis confirmed invasive rectal SCC, with strong 
immunohistochemical staining for squamous markers. High-risk HPV subtypes 16, 
18, and 33 were detected. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed localized disease 
with muscularis propria invasion but no definite extension beyond the serosa or 
evidence of distant metastasis. The patient was referred to oncology for 
definitive management. CONCLUSIONS This case illustrates a rare but emerging 
diagnosis: HPV-positive rectal SCC in an immunocompetent woman without classic 
risk factors. It underscores the evolving spectrum of HPV-related malignancies 
and the need to reevaluate screening strategies to incorporate sexual behavior 
and HPV risk across all genders.

The immunosuppressive nature and low antigenicity of solid tumors present major 
obstacles for effective cancer vaccination. Here, we report a live 
bacteria-based vaccine platform engineered by coating attenuated Salmonella 
(SAL) with a cancer cell membrane (CCM), integrating pathogenic adjuvants and 
autologous tumor antigens into a single entity. This CCM@SAL system leverages 
bacterial immunogenicity to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) within the tumor 
microenvironment, promoting in situ release of endogenous antigens and 
damage-associated molecular patterns. These events synergize to prime 
antigen-presenting cells and activate tumor-specific T cells. Notably, CCM 
coating reduces bacterial clearance by phagocytes and enhances tumor 
accumulation. The combination of ICD induction and tumor-targeted antigen 
delivery enables a self-amplifying vaccination cycle within the tumor. This in 
situ vaccination induces durable systemic immunity and suppresses tumor 
progression in multiple murine models. By integrating tumor targeting, ICD 
induction, and antigen presentation, CCM@SAL offers a broadly applicable 
strategy to improve cancer vaccine efficacy.

Acquisition of resistance to anti-cancer therapies is a multistep process 
initiated by the survival of drug-tolerant persister cells. Accessibility of 
drug-tolerant persister cells in patients is limited, which has hindered 
understanding the mechanisms driving their emergence. Here, using multiple 
patient-derived models to isolate persister cells, we showed that these cells 
are transcriptionally plastic in vivo and return to a common treatment 
naïve-like state upon relapse, regardless of treatment. Hallmarks of the 
persister state in TNBC across treatment modalities included high expression of 
basal keratins together with activation of stress response and inflammation 
pathways. These hallmarks were also activated in HER2+ breast and lung cancer 
cells in response to targeted therapies. Analysis of gene regulatory networks 
identified AP-1, NF-κB and IRF/STAT as the key drivers of this hallmark 
persister state. Functionally, FOSL1, an AP-1 member, drove cells to the 
persister state by binding enhancers and reprogramming the transcriptome of 
cancer cells. On the contrary, cancer cells without FOSL1 had a decreased 
ability to reach the persister state. By defining hallmarks of TNBC persistence 
on multiple therapies, this study provides a resource to design effective 
combination therapeutic strategies that limit resistance.

INTRODUCTION: N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a 
biomarker for heart stress and heart failure, with its production triggered by 
the stretching of cardiac fibers. This study investigates if elevated NT-proBNP 
levels can independently predict poor outcomes for patients undergoing heart 
surgery.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed in the PubMed®, Latin American and 
Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (or LILACS), Physiotherapy Evidence 
Database (PEDro), Web of Science, and Embase databases, with the following 
descriptors: ""NT-proBNP"" OR ""NTproBNP"" OR ""N- terminal pro-B-type natriuretic 
peptide"" OR ""N- terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide"" OR ""amino terminal pro 
brain natriuretic peptide"" AND ""Cardiovascular Surgical Procedures"" NOT 
""Pediatric"" OR ""children"" NOT ""cancer"" OR ""oncology"" NOT ""animal*"". Articles 
that evaluated NT-proBNP and adverse outcomes in cardiac surgical patients were 
chosen. The levels of evidence and the strength of recommendation were assessed 
considering the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and 
Evaluation (or GRADE) system and validity by the PEDro scale. For systematic 
review, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(or PRISMA) criteria and the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (or 
PICO) strategy were followed.
RESULTS: Forty-seven articles were included, of which 17 were related to serious 
complications, including mortality.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative NT-proBNP is a prognostic marker for mortality, length 
of stay in the postoperative intensive care unit, postoperative acute kidney 
injury, postoperative atrial fibrillation, postoperative low cardiac output, 
postoperative prolonged mechanical ventilation time, prolonged hospitalization 
time, unscheduled hospital readmission related to heart problems, and 
postoperative heart failure.

Cellular proliferation relies on the successful coordination and completion of 
genome replication and segregation. To help achieve this, many bacteria utilize 
regulatory pathways that ensure DNA replication initiation only occurs once per 
cell cycle. When dysregulated, loss of DNA replication control can have severe 
consequences. In Escherichia coli, it has been established that hyper-initiation 
of DNA synthesis leads to pleiotropic genome instability and cell death. 
Therefore, targeting DNA replication initiation proteins to promote 
hyper-initiation may be an approach to generate novel antimicrobials. However, 
the pathways and potential consequences of replication hyper-initiation in 
Gram-positive species remain enigmatic. To address this question, we devised 
genetic systems to artificially induce hyper-initiation in the model organism 
Bacillus subtilis and the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. In both species, 
hyper-initiation elicited cellular degeneration culminating in growth inhibition 
by cell death. During this process in B. subtilis, temporal analyses revealed 
the early onset of the DNA damage response, followed by membrane depolarization 
and cell lysis. This phenotype could be suppressed by removing pathways that 
repair damaged DNA, suggesting that cell death is a consequence of conflicts 
between DNA replication and repair. In S. aureus, cells quickly accumulated 
striking morphological changes associated with rapid loss of chromosomal DNA and 
death via a lysis-independent pathway. Moreover, inducing hyper-initiation in S. 
aureus was observed to decrease bacterial survival during infection of murine 
macrophages. Taken together, the data suggest that stimulating initiation of 
bacterial DNA synthesis could be an alternative approach to inhibiting microbial 
growth, particularly in combination with compounds that inhibit or poison DNA 
repair, akin to cancer therapies.

AIMS: We aimed to investigate a potential association between hypofractionated 
radiotherapy (HFRT) vs. conventional radiotherapy (CRT) and development of 
pseudoprogression in patients over the age of 65 treated for glioblastoma (GBM).
MATERIALS & METHODS: Seventy-nine patients with glioblastoma (29 who received 
HFRT and 50 who received CRT) were included in this retrospective cohort study 
from a single institution. Demographic, clinical, and radiation information, 
including development of pseudoprogression and standard prognostic factors like 
Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) and extent of surgical resection, were 
collected.
RESULTS: Radiation regimen alone was not associated with development of 
pseudoprogression. Patients who had lower KPS at the time of diagnosis and 
received HFRT had lower rates of pseudoprogression. There was no association 
between radiation regimen, pseudoprogression, and any other clinical factors.
CONCLUSION: Older patients with glioblastoma who receive HFRT are not more 
likely to develop pseudoprogression than those who receive CRT. Patients with 
lower functional status receiving HFRT may be less likely to mount an 
inflammatory response leading to pseudoprogression. Prospective investigation is 
warranted to validate these results and evaluate other factors leading to 
treatment complications in older patients with glioblastoma in order to optimize 
outcomes and minimize toxicity.

Plain Language Summary: Patients with glioblastoma, a type of brain 
cancer, often receive radiation therapy. Conventional radiotherapy (CRT) 
involves daily doses over 30 days. Patients over the age of 65 with glioblastoma 
can receive a higher-dose radiation schedule over 15 days called 
hypofractionated radiation (HFRT) with the same lifespan increase as in CRT. We 
thought HFRT, with more radiation per dose, could increase the chance of 
developing pseudoprogression, which is the brain’s post-radiation immune 
response appearing as if the tumor is growing back. Using patient records over 
5 years, we determined whether having received CRT or HFRT affected the chances 
of developing pseudoprogression. While we found no direct link, we discovered 
patients who received HFRT and had a lower Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) 
score – a scale measuring a patient’s ability to carry out day-to-day 
activities, with a high score indicating a high ability – had lower rates of 
pseudoprogression. A possible explanation is patients with lower KPS scores 
could be considered biologically older and therefore have weaker immune systems, 
suppressing the immune response caused by high radiation doses. More research is 
needed to confirm these findings and help tailor treatment plans for older 
patients with glioblastoma to improve their outcomes.

Surgical approaches to lung cancer resection are rapidly evolving, particularly 
for early-stage lung cancer. Advances in chest CT technology and increasing use 
of CT in patient care have led to detection of smaller nodules, many with 
ground-glass attenuation that do not require lobectomy for resection. 
Lung-sparing and minimally invasive techniques have been shown to result in 
improved patient outcomes compared with those of traditional open thoracotomy 
and are noninferior in terms of cancer recurrence. As more patients undergo 
these surgeries, it is important for radiologists to be aware of useful 
information for surgeons before the operation. It is helpful for radiologists to 
understand the indications for lung-sparing surgery and have a basic 
understanding of the techniques involved in video-assisted and robotic thoracic 
operations. Identification of the location and morphology of the tumor, as well 
as the pulmonary vasculature that feeds and drains the segment of lung 
containing the tumor is important. Also, the presence of emphysema, pulmonary 
fibrosis, and incomplete fissures is useful information. In addition, chest 
imaging is also progressing, with improvements in multiplanar reformations and 
three-dimensional imaging allowing for more detailed and accurate image-based 
localization of tumors and visualization of anatomy. Nodule localization for 
surgery plays an even larger role given the limited ability to palpate nodules 
during surgery with minimally invasive surgery approaches. Methods can involve 
imaging and in vivo localization, with transthoracic and bronchoscopic methods 
used to label a nodule. Finally, radiologists should be aware of postoperative 
complications and their imaging characteristics, such as suture line granulomas 
and bronchopleural fistulas. Supplemental material is available for this 
article. ©RSNA, 2025.

Active surveillance (AS) of low-risk papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC; 
T1aN0M0) in adults was initiated in 1993 at Kuma Hospital (Kobe, Japan) and in 
1995 at the Cancer Institute Hospital (Tokyo, Japan). Since then, numerous 
studies from various countries have reported favorable outcomes for patients 
managed with AS. Notably, no cases of thyroid carcinoma-related death have been 
reported among patients who have undergone AS. Young age has been identified as 
a predictor of high tumor growth activity; however, previous studies have shown 
that young adult patients may still be suitable candidates for AS. Although 
surgery for PTMC is not technically complex, it carries risk, even when 
performed by experienced thyroid surgeons, including permanent recurrent 
laryngeal nerve paralysis and hypoparathyroidism. No significant difference in 
prognosis has been observed between patients managed with AS and those who 
undergo immediate surgery (IS). Some patients initially on AS later opt for 
conversion surgery (CS) for various reasons. Importantly, the postoperative 
prognosis and incidence of unfavorable events in patients undergoing CS do not 
differ significantly from those in patients undergoing IS. However, the overall 
incidence of unfavorable events has been reported to be higher among patients 
who initially chose IS than those who began with AS. Patients managed with AS 
have demonstrated better physical quality of life (QOL) than those who underwent 
IS. Although findings on mental QOL have been inconsistent, this may depend on 
the attitudes and approach of the attending clinicians. Presently, AS is 
considered an excellent initial management strategy for patients with PTMC.

A high-fat diet (HFD) promotes tumor progression and therapeutic resistance, but 
its mechanistic role in prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear. In this study, we 
show that an HFD not only accelerates PCa progression but also significantly 
reduces sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Mechanistically, an HFD activates 
CDK4, inducing RB1 phosphorylation and facilitating E2F1 release. Meanwhile, 
phosphorylation of RB1 at the S249/T252 site enhances its interaction with ETS1 
and suppresses ETS1's transcriptional activity. Treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors 
induces dephosphorylation at this site, relieving ETS1 suppression and promoting 
PCYT2 expression and phosphatidylcholine metabolic reprogramming. The resulting 
metabolic products further disrupt RB1-E2F1 binding, leading to additional E2F1 
release and increased resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. In conclusion, our 
results identify a diet-metabolism-transcriptional regulatory axis centered on 
RB1 phosphorylation and ETS1 reactivation, reveal a mechanism of acquired 
resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors of castration-resistant PCa, and provide a 
theoretical basis for combinatorial strategies targeting metabolic and oncogenic 
signals.

The MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex is fundamental for detecting and repairing 
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), thereby safeguarding genome integrity. However, 
the precise mechanism governing MRN complex recruitment to DSBs remains largely 
unexplored. Here, we identify WD40- and FYVE domain-containing protein 2 (WDFY2) 
as an important regulator of MRN complex formation at DNA damage sites, 
facilitating homologous recombination (HR) repair. Mechanistically, WDFY2 is 
phosphorylated at serine 84 by the ATM-CHK2 axis, priming it for recruitment to 
DSBs. Through direct interactions with MRE11 and NBS1, WDFY2 bridges the 
MRE11-RAD50 subcomplex with NBS1, thereby promoting MRN complex formation at 
DSBs and DNA end resection. WDFY2 deficiency, as well as the 
non-phosphorylatable S84A mutant, results in impaired HR repair and reduced cell 
survival following DNA damage. Collectively, our findings establish WDFY2 as a 
key platform for MRN complex loading at DSBs and HR repair, highlighting it as a 
potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.

Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecological malignancy, and high 
expression of IGF2BP2 is significantly associated with poor prognosis. 
Intracellular macromolecules regulate diverse biological functions via 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). However, whether IGF2BP2 undergoes LLPS 
and promotes tumor progression in OC through spatiotemporal coordination remains 
elusive. Here, we demonstrate that IGF2BP2 forms condensates through LLPS in OC 
cells, which recruit target RNAs and translation initiation factors to enhance 
de novo protein synthesis. Both N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-modified RNA binding 
and acetylation of IGF2BP2 promote its LLPS. However, substitution of five 
lysines and one glycine with glutamine within the m6A-binding pocket of IGF2BP2 
blocks acetylation and disrupts its LLPS, which in turn dampens global protein 
synthesis and abolishes the oncogenic activity of IGF2BP2 in OC. Our findings 
reveal that IGF2BP2-driven LLPS promotes OC progression by enhancing protein 
synthesis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

Glioblastoma (GBM) and primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) are 
aggressive brain tumors that require neurosurgical treatment. For targeted 
treatment, biopsy and histopathological identification of the tumor entity are 
necessary. Here, we present a protocol for diagnosing PCNSL using a 
convolutional neural network (CNN)-based algorithm. We describe steps for 
installing the u-LINNDA (user-optimized lymphoma identification through neural 
network detection aid) algorithm, data preparation and preprocessing, and 
predicting tumor entities using u-LINNDA. We then detail procedures for 
predicting tumor identity and inspecting the u-LINNDA report.

The possibility of pairing the α-emitter 223Ra for targeted α therapy with the 
γ-emitter 131Ba for SPECT imaging could unlock novel theranostic options in 
cancer management. However, the lack of stable in vivo chelation for Ra2+/Ba2+ 
remains a key barrier to clinical use. Four macrocyclic chelators were herein 
developed by functionalizing 1,10-diaza-18-crown-6 (Kryptofix 22) with donor 
groups tailored to Ra2+/Ba2+: 2-pyridylphosphonic acid (macrophospho), malonic 
acid (macromal), catechol (macrocat), and 1,2-HOPO (macroHOPO). The 
thermodynamic and structural properties of their Ba2+ and Ra2+ complexes were 
explored in aqueous solution through potentiometry, NMR spectroscopy, X-ray 
crystallography and DFT calculations. Macromal gave the highest stability 
constant known so far for a 1:1 Ba2+-to-ligand fully deprotonated complex (logβ 
= 16.6), even higher than that of Ba2+-macropa, the current state-of-the-art 
chelator for 223Ra/131Ba. The experimental complex stability followed the order 
macromal > macropa ≫ macrophospho ∼ macroHOPO > macrocat. Concentration-, 
temperature-, pH-, and time-dependent radiolabeling were carried out using 223Ra 
derived from Xofigo residues and cyclotron-produced 131Ba. Although quantitative 
223Ra/131Ba incorporation was not achieved, this work expands the scarce 
coordination chemistry and radiochemistry of the two heaviest alkaline earth 
(radio)metals.

Colitis-associated cancer (CAC) arises from a complex interplay between host and 
environmental factors. In this report, we investigated the role of the gut 
microbiome using Winnie mice, a UC-like model with a missense mutation in the 
Muc2 gene. Upon rederivation from a conventional (CONV) to a 
specific-pathogen-free (SPF) facility, Winnie mice developed severe colitis and, 
notably, spontaneous CAC that progressively worsened over time. In contrast, 
CONV Winnie showed only mild colitis but no tumorigenesis. By comparison, when 
rederived into germ-free (GF) conditions, SPF Winnie mice were protected from 
colitis and colon tumors, indicating an essential role for the gut microbiome in 
the development of CAC in these mice. Using shotgun metagenomics, metabolomics, 
and lipidomics, we identified a distinct pro-inflammatory microbial and 
metabolic signature that potentially drives the transition from colitis to CAC. 
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), using either SPF Winnie or WT (Bl/6) 
donors into GF Winnie recipients, demonstrated that while colitis developed 
regardless of the donor, only FMT from SPF Winnie donors resulted in CAC. Our 
studies present a relevant model of CAC, providing strong evidence that the 
microbiome plays a key role in its pathogenesis, thereby challenging the concept 
of colon cancer as a strictly non-transmissible disease.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Thyroid-cancer demands age-linked histology and 
nodule-architecture - factors rarely studied in papillary-thyroid-carcinoma 
(PTC). Severe-paucity exists in high-quality data about region-specific 
surveillance and epidemiology.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 208-patient-data for prevalences and 
associations King Salman Specialist Hospital (2022-2025) for age, sex, 
first-degree-family-history, smoking, obesity (BMI ≥30 kg m-2), 
oral-contraceptive-pill (OCP)-use, hypertension, diabetes, nodule-pattern, and 
tumor-subtype. Associations tested χ2 or Fisher's-exact (α = 0.05); effect size 
as odds ratios (ORs, 95% CI).
RESULTS: Females dominated (70.2%) aged 30-39-years (52.4%). Histology indicated 
PTC (87.5%), then follicular (8.2%), medullary (3.4%), and anaplastic (1.0%). 
Age strongly-associated subtype (χ2 = 30.7, p < 0.001): PTC comprised 98.2% 
tumors <40-years but only 72.5% were ≥50-years, where follicular and 
medullary-cancers reached 27.5%. A positive family-history indicated 
medullary-carcinoma (11.4% vs 1.7%; χ2 = 8.95, p = 0.030; OR = 7.4). Smoking 
exclusively in men (9.7% vs 0%; χ2 = 14.5, p < 0.001). Intriguingly, the 
novel-finding multinodularity dominating males (43.5% vs 8.9%; χ2 = 33.6, 
p < 0.001) and women-non-users OCPs (32.7% vs 7.3%; χ2 = 21.5, p < 0.001) while 
OCP-use associated to single-nodules warrants investigation. Obesity, 
hypertension, and diabetes correlated with occurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid cancer displays age-, sex- and heredity-associations: 
non-PTC subtypes rose with age, medullary tumors cluster in families, 
multinodularity predominanted male, and OCP use associated to single-nodules. 
These findings support age-stratified diagnostics, targeted 
RET-proto-oncogene-testing, and consideration of hormonal influences.

Metastatic progression is a major cause of radiotherapy (RT) failure, yet the 
mechanisms linking RT to immune suppression and metastasis remain unclear. Here, 
we identify YTHDF2 as a radiation-induced immune checkpoint in dendritic cells 
(DCs). By analyzing patient biopsies from a clinical trial (NCT03223155), we 
discover that increased YTHDF2 expression in DCs after RT correlates with 
treatment failure after RT. Mechanistically, ionizing radiation induces SPI1, 
which drives transcription of Ythdf2 in DCs. Upregulated YTHDF2 promotes 
m6A-mediated degradation of Notch pathway regulators (Mfng, Aph1b, Aph1c), 
impairing MHC-I cross-presentation and CD8+ T cell activation, thereby 
facilitating tumor immune evasion and metastatic spread. Crucially, targeting 
YTHDF2 restores DC immunogenicity, enhances RT-induced tumor control, and 
improves DC-based cancer vaccines when combined with RT, providing a clinically 
actionable strategy to overcome RT resistance and metastasis.

Treatment.

Ferroptosis is newly recognized form of regular cell death which is associated 
with iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation in cells. This procedure leads to 
immense oxidative damage, inhibition of antioxidant defense, and a high 
generation of ROS. Ferroptosis progression is linked to mitochondrial 
dysfunction and p53 activation. In fact, excessive ROS generation after iron 
buildup leads to further mitochondrial lipid peroxidation. Curcumin, a naturally 
occurring polyphenolic chemical that comes from Curcuma longa, has a variety of 
pharmacological characteristics, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-neoplastic, and 
antioxidant actions. According to recent studies, curcumin and its derivatives 
can induce ferroptosis in cancerous cells, offering a novel means of halting 
tumor growth and overcoming drug resistance. Curcumin can induce ferroptosis in 
tumor cells via a number of regulatory mechanisms, such as those pertaining to 
the metabolism of iron, lipids, and amino acids. This might lead to the 
development of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cancer that is 
resistant to apoptosis. Ferroptosis is another way it affects anticancer 
immunotherapy. This study intends to demonstrate curcumin and its derivatives as 
strong inducers of ferroptosis and highlights their potential to transform 
cancer therapy paradigms by thoroughly reviewing the existing literature.

Schiff bases (imines) have emerged as promising compounds with significant 
anticancer potential, owing to their ability to induce cytotoxicity and 
apoptosis in cancer cells. In this study, a series of thymol-based imines were 
synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxic activity against multiple 
cancer cell lines. The results demonstrated that several derivatives exhibited 
potent cytotoxic effects, with lower IC50 values compared to cisplatin and 
paclitaxel. Among them, compound 4f showed the highest cytotoxic activity 
(IC50 = 4.08-9.94 µM across different cell lines), followed by 4k, 4l, and 4m, 
which also displayed notable potency. To explain the mode of molecular action of 
compounds on cells, we tested the mRNA levels of apoptotic and antiapoptotic 
genes such as BAX, BCL2, BCL2-xl, BiD, and caspase 3 by qRT-PCR. Moreover, we 
evaluated the nuclear organization of cells using DAPI staining by 
immunofluorescence microscopy. Additionally, cellular oxidative stress status 
was analyzed. Our results indicated that compounds upregulated apoptotic genes 
such as BAX, caspase-3, and BiD, whereas antiapoptotic BCL2 and BCL-xL genes 
were downregulated. DAPI results also supported these results; compounds 
triggered apoptotic formations. Also, compounds importantly increased the 
oxidative stress status in cells. The binding mode of relatively active 
compounds to the apoptotic and antiapoptotic targets was investigated through 
molecular modeling to assert and elucidate the in vitro results. The docking 
study implied that the active compounds could bind to BCL-xL and caspase 3 
proteins. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study demonstrated that the 
complexes formed with BCL-xL were more stable. Furthermore, the MMPBSA energy 
study revealed that the compounds had a higher binding affinity to BCL-xL. 
Overall, these findings demonstrate that thymol-based Schiff bases, such as 
compounds 4f and 4k, exhibit potent cytotoxic activity through apoptotic 
stimulation and oxidative stress enhancement, suggesting their potential as 
novel anticancer agents targeting the BCL-xL pathway.

1,2,4-Triazines exhibit various pharmacological properties due to their strong 
biological activities, such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, 
antiviral, and antioxidant, and also occupy an important place in the 
pharmaceutical field. The tested compounds were synthesized and characterized. 
1,2,4-Triazines were evaluated for their inhibitory and cytotoxicity effects on 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), human liver cancer 
cell line (HepG2), and human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (HT-29). 
1,2,4-Triazines (3a-c, 5, 6, 10) were found to inhibit these enzymes with IC50 
values ranging from 1.41 to 4.28 μM for AChE and from 1.58 to 4.13 μM for GST. 
1,2,4-Triazine compounds were tested in range of 12.5-100 µM concentrations 
against HepG2 and HT-29 cell lines. Among the 1,2,4-triazines tested, 10 was the 
most effective substance on HepG2 cells, especially at high doses, while 3b was 
effective on HT-29. Furthermore, molecular docking results indicated that the 
1,2,4-triazines showed strong binding and stability at the active site of 
enzymes and selected proteins. 1,2,4-Triazines may serve as promising precursors 
for the design of potent enzyme inhibitors and anticancer agents.

IMPORTANCE: Older adults with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are 
underrepresented in clinical trials, limiting evidence-based treatment 
decisions. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have demonstrated the ability to 
personalize treatment recommendations using patient-specific characteristics.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and externally validate ANNs for overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS) in older adults with HNSCC undergoing definitive 
chemoradiation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This international cohort study included 
retrospective clinical data from 19 academic cancer centers across Germany, 
Switzerland, Czech Republic, Cyprus, and the US from the SENIOR registry. ANNs 
were developed and validated using data from patients 65 years and older with 
locoregionally advanced HNSCC treated with definitive chemoradiation. Exclusion 
criteria included induction or adjuvant chemotherapy, history of head and neck 
cancer, and metastatic disease at treatment initiation. Data were collected from 
January 2021 to December 2023, and data were analyzed from December 2023 to 
April 2025.
EXPOSURES: All patients received definitive radiotherapy with concurrent 
systemic therapy between 2005 and 2019.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: OS and PFS were predicted using 2 separate ANN 
models. Patients were classified as high or low risk based on median prediction 
thresholds. Model performance was assessed with receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) and precision recall AUC. Model 
explainability was assessed with Shapley additive explanations values.
RESULTS: Of 898 patients included in the OS analysis (738 in training cohort and 
160 in testing cohort), 665 (74.1%) were male, and the median (IQR) age was 71 
(68-76) years. Of 945 included in the PFS analysis (770 in training cohort and 
175 in testing cohort), 696 (73.7%) were male, and the median (IQR) age was 71 
(68-76) years. The OS ANN stratified patients into high-risk and low-risk groups 
with significantly different survival, achieving an ROC-AUC of 0.68 (95% CI, 
0.60-0.76). The PFS ANN showed similar discrimination, with an ROC-AUC of 0.64 
(95% CI, 0.56-0.72). Human papillomavirus status, kidney function (estimated 
glomerular filtration rate), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance 
Status score, and nodal classification were among the most predictive features.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, ANN-based models using routine 
clinical data effectively stratified older adults with HNSCC into prognostic 
groups. Integration of ANNs into clinical workflows could support personalized 
treatment decisions for this vulnerable population.

University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China.

IMPORTANCE: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a severe hematologic cancer with 
complex genetic heterogeneity necessitating personalized treatment approaches. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies may revolutionize risk stratification, 
diagnosis enhancement, and treatment planning in addressing critical gaps in AML 
management, particularly in low-resource health care environments.
OBSERVATIONS: This narrative review synthesizes existing AI applications in 3 
primary areas of AML management. Machine learning algorithms integrating 
clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular data demonstrate greater prognostic 
accuracy than conventional European LeukemiaNet (ELN) guidelines. Deep learning 
approaches to image analysis yield excellent results for AML subtype 
identification from bone marrow smears (area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve [AUROC]: 0.97) and genetic variant prediction (eg, NPM1 
status [AUROC: 0.92]). AI-driven genomic analysis reveals novel prognostic 
signatures and therapeutic targets through advanced pattern recognition, with 
high-dimensional machine learning achieving greater than 99% accuracy in AML 
classification from transcriptomic data. Explainable AI models overcome the 
black box limitation through interpretable algorithms with Shapley Additive 
Explanations values and local interpretable model-agnostic explanation 
techniques. Federated learning approaches enable multi-institutional 
collaboration with protection of patient privacy, with 96.5% accuracy in 
leukemia classification on heterogeneous datasets.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: AI technologies hold potential to improve AML 
treatment through enhanced risk stratification, early detection capabilities, 
and individualized treatment optimization. The transition toward explainable AI 
models is essential to clinical readiness, with federated learning architectures 
resolving data scarcity concerns. Seamless integration requires harmonized data 
standards, robust regulatory frameworks, and equitable access to technology to 
fully realize the transformative potential of AI in improving outcomes for 
patients with AML globally.

IMPORTANCE: Treatment of high-risk soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) of extremity or 
trunk wall involves neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by surgery. 
Histopathological response could estimate patient outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize morphological changes in surgical specimens of 
patients treated with NACT with or without radiotherapy (RT) to identify 
histopathological features that stratify risk of recurrence and ultimately 
estimate the benefit from neoadjuvant treatments.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a preplanned prospective secondary 
analysis of the ISG-STS 1001 clinical trial, a study with both a randomized 
clinical trial (conducted between 2011 and 2016) and a nonrandomized patient 
cohort (included between 2016 and 2020) at 32 centers across Italy, Spain, 
France, and Poland. Participants were patients with STS randomly assigned to 
receive either anthracycline plus ifosfamide or histotype-tailored (also termed 
histology tailored) NACT. Data analyses were performed from January to June 
2023.
INTERVENTION: Participants received 3 cycles of anthracycline plus ifosfamide or 
histotype-tailored NACT with or without RT followed by surgery.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was disease-free survival (DFS). 
Histopathological features considered included the proportion of stainable tumor 
cells, tumor necrosis, hemorrhage, fibrohistiocytic reaction with hemosiderin, 
sclerosis or fibrosis, and sclerohyalinosis. The proportion of stainable tumor 
cells was classified according to the European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer-Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group categories or as absent 
or present. The continuous variable of sclerohyalinosis, expressed as a 
percentage, was categorized based on the second tertile of its distribution 
(20%). Tumor necrosis, hemorrhage, fibrohistiocytic reaction with hemosiderin, 
sclerosis or fibrosis, which were also expressed as a percentage, were 
classified as absent or present.
RESULTS: A total of 388 patients (201 in randomized cohort, 187 in nonrandomized 
cohort; median [IQR] age, 50 [41-60] years; 245 males [63.1%]) were evaluable 
for histopathological response. In the randomized cohort, after a median (IQR) 
follow-up of 86 (70-99) months, 115 of 201 patients (57.2%) developed a disease 
recurrence. The proportion of stainable tumor cells (>1%) was not associated 
with DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.47; 95% CI, 0.36-5.98; P = .59). Necrosis (>1%) 
was associated with shorter DFS (HR, 3.11; 95% CI, 1.36-7.14; P = .007), while 
sclerohyalinosis greater than 20% was associated with longer DFS (HR, 0.51; 95% 
CI, 0.28-0.94; P = .03). Exclusion of patients who received preoperative RT did 
not alter these associations. In patients randomly assigned to anthracycline 
plus ifosfamide (n = 98), sclerohyalinosis greater than 20% remained associated 
with longer DFS (HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.09-0.67; P = .007). These findings were 
confirmed when a broader cohort (n = 187) was included.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical 
trial, the proportion of stainable tumor cells, currently considered as the most 
relevant posttreatment change, did not stratify patient risk. The findings 
support consideration of the presence of sclerohyalinosis (>20%) to identify 
patients with the best outcome after NACT.

IMPORTANCE: Oral molecularly targeted cancer medications are widely used. 
Product labels describe an increase in serum creatinine (sCr), potentially due 
to reversible inhibition of tubular creatinine secretion rather than acute 
kidney injury.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the 2-year incidence and relative rates of progressive 
kidney dysfunction in patients treated with molecularly targeted cancer 
medications associated with an acute change in sCr handling (pseudoacute kidney 
injury).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of adult patients 
throughout the San Francisco Bay area treated at Stanford Hospital and clinics 
since 2008 receiving cyclin dependent kinase 4 or 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors, 
poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, and specific drugs 
within tyrosine kinases inhibitor subgroups with an available estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from days 1 to 60 after drug start compared 
with propensity score-matched patients without cancer.
EXPOSURE: Molecularly targeted cancer medications associated with an acute 
change in sCr.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Progressive kidney dysfunction defined as a 
sustained 30% or more decline in eGFR or reaching end-stage kidney disease, 
accounting for a potentially reversible rise in sCr at drug start by defining 
baseline eGFR as the mean value from days 1 to 60 after drug start.
RESULTS: Among 5015 patients in the treated cohort, the median (IQR) age was 62 
(51-72) years, 3264 (65%) were female, and the mean (SD) baseline eGFR before 
drug start was 87 (23) mL/min/1.73m2. Using cox proportional hazards regression 
models, the overall incidence and rate of progressive kidney dysfunction was 
higher in the treated cohort than in propensity-matched cohorts of patients 
without cancer (44 vs 38 per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.4; 95% CI, 
1.2-1.6). Rates of kidney dysfunction were higher among patients treated with 
CDK4/6 inhibitors (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.6), estimated glomerular filtration 
rate inhibitors (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.5), vascular endothelial growth factor 
receptor inhibitors (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.7), and B-Raf inhibitors (HR, 1.9; 
95% CI, 1.1-3.3) compared with controls. These higher rates persisted in 
patients without a 20% or more increase in sCr at drug start and without 
exposure to chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of patients treated with 
molecularly targeted anticancer medications associated with an acute rise in 
sCr, we observed higher incidence and relative rate for kidney dysfunction among 
treated patients, compared with matched cancer-free patients.

Endometrial cancer arising in adenomyosis (EC-AIA), i.e., malignant 
transformation of the endometrium within adenomyotic foci, is a very unusual 
condition. We report a postmenopausal woman who had an unexpected diagnosis of 
uterine serous carcinoma (USC) arising from adenomyosis. A 55-year-old woman 
complained of anorexia with weight loss and mild abdominal pain. Pelvic cystic 
masses were shown by computed tomography (CT). CA125 in serum was 44.86 u/ml. 
Ultrasound detected a 50 × 36 mm subserous cystic-solid mass. It was 
misdiagnosed as a subserous uterine fibroid with cystic degeneration. The 
postoperative histopathological diagnosis was USC. This is the first time to 
discuss the ultrasound diagnosis of EC-AIA. The de novo cystic area in 
adenomyosis in postmenopausal women may indicate malignant transformation. 
Ultrasound is the first imaging choice for gynecological masses. Presenting the 
ultrasound image and identifying the factors that may contribute to misdiagnosis 
can help raise the examiner's attention to this condition and inform the 
diagnostic workup in the future.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an aggressive form of breast 
cancer that requires extensive multimodal treatment, which poses unique 
reconstructive challenges. Despite advances in trimodal therapy, optimal timing 
and outcomes of breast reconstruction in IBC remain poorly characterized. This 
study aims to evaluate clinical outcomes, complications, and patient-reported 
outcomes associated with delayed breast reconstruction in patients with IBC.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with stage III IBC 
who completed trimodal therapy between 1997 and 2023 using an institutional IBC 
database. Clinical and oncologic outcomes were analyzed. Reconstruction-specific 
outcomes were assessed through chart review of patients undergoing delayed 
autologous reconstruction (predominantly DIEP and latissimus dorsi flaps). 
Patient-reported outcomes were evaluated by using BREAST-Q scales pre- and 
post-reconstruction, with comparisons to non-IBC comparison groups.
RESULTS: Of 248 eligible patients with stage III IBC, 49 (19.8%) underwent 
delayed breast reconstruction, predominantly autologous (87.8%). Reconstruction 
was associated with younger age (45.4 vs. 51.3 years, odds ratio [OR] = 0.95, 
p < 0.01), lower BMI (28.3 vs. 30.7, OR = 0.93, p = 0.04), and fewer 
comorbidities (0.7 vs. 1.1, OR = 0.61, p < 0.01). No reconstructed patients 
experienced recurrence within 1 year post-mastectomy, aligning with guidelines 
recommending delayed reconstruction. Reconstruction-specific complication rates 
were comparable to existing literature. BREAST-Q scores significantly improved 
post-reconstruction, with IBC cohort achieving satisfaction and quality-of-life 
outcomes comparable to non-IBC controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Delayed breast reconstruction is safe and effective in carefully 
selected patients with stage III IBC. Reconstruction offers significant 
psychosocial benefits without compromising oncologic outcomes. These findings 
corroborate current guidelines and provide valuable evidence for patient 
counseling and surgical decision-making.

BACKGROUND: High infiltration of CD103+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is 
associated with improved patient survival in colorectal cancer. However, the 
spatial distribution and clinical significance of CD103+ TILs in colorectal 
liver metastasis (CRLM) remain unclear.
METHODS: This study enrolled 84 patients with CRLM who underwent simultaneous 
surgical resection of both primary colorectal tumors (PT) and liver metastases 
(LM). The abundance of CD103+ TILs in different intratumoral compartments were 
evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Additionally, multiplex immunofluorescence 
analysis was performed to assess CD103+ TIL subsets. Single-cell RNA sequencing 
(scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomic analysis were performed to investigate 
the functional differences of CD103+CD8+ T cells between PT and LM using a 
published dataset.
RESULTS: The presence of CD103+ TILs in PT did not correlate with the prognosis 
of patients with CRLM. Conversely, an increased infiltration of CD103+ TILs in 
LM was associated with improved survival outcomes. Notably, CD103+ TILs in the 
stromal compartments of the tumor center of LM emerged as an independent 
prognostic factor for CRLM patients. The majority of CD103+ TILs in CRLM tissues 
were identified as CD8+CD103+ cells, followed by CD4+CD103+ cells. scRNA-seq 
analysis showed that the CD103+CD8+ T cells in the PT exhibit characteristics 
typical of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, while those in the LM display features of 
tissue-resident memory T cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal the heterogeneity in the spatial distribution 
of CD103+ TILs within both PT and LM tissues. Notably, the infiltration of 
CD103+ TILs in LM serves as a prognostic biomarker for CRLM patients.

PURPOSE: Prostate cancer is a prevalent malignant tumor in men, and accurate 
diagnosis and personalized treatment rely on multimodal imaging, such as MRI and 
TRUS. However, differences in imaging mechanisms and prostate deformation due to 
ultrasound probe compression pose significant challenges for high-quality 
registration between the two modalities.
METHODS: In this study, we propose a label-aware weakly supervised diffusion 
model for MRI-TRUS multimodal image registration. First, we align label centroid 
positions by maximizing the Dice coefficient to correct initial biases. Second, 
we combine label supervision with a diffusion model to generate high-quality 
deformation fields. Finally, we incorporate a feature-guided module to better 
preserve edge structures and improve registration smoothness.
RESULTS: Experiments conducted on the µ-RegPro dataset demonstrate that our 
method outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across multiple 
evaluation metrics. Specifically, it achieves a Dice coefficient of 0.880 and 
reduces the target registration error (TRE) to 0.940, significantly surpassing 
unsupervised methods such as VoxelMorph, FSDiffReg, and supervised methods like 
LocalNet and AutoFuse. The results show that preliminary label centroid 
alignment effectively enhances the performance of the diffusion-based 
deformation registration model, reducing the TRE from 3.084 to 0.940. The 
ablation study demonstrates that the feature-guided diffusion module effectively 
suppresses deformation field folding, while the label-aware module enhances 
label alignment. When combined, the proposed framework achieves a favorable 
balance, substantially improving registration accuracy (Dice = 0.880, 
TRE = 0.940) with reduced folding (|J|≤0 = 0.134). This method exhibits strong 
robustness and generalizability in handling large deformations in target regions 
while preserving details in nontarget regions.
CONCLUSION: The proposed label-aware weakly supervised diffusion model enables 
accurate and efficient MRI-TRUS multimodal image registration, offering strong 
potential for clinical applications such as prostate cancer diagnosis, targeted 
biopsy, and image-guided navigation.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is best characterized by high 
aggressiveness and significant biological heterogeneity. Although the current 
TNBC clinical trials include genomic biomarkers to stratify treatment arms, they 
are still limited by metabolic heterogeneity within TNBC subtypes. The metabolic 
reprogramming, a cancer hallmark, in TNBC involves adaptive regulation of 
glycolysis, lipid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), with 
distinct metabolic phenotypes significantly influencing tumor sensitivity to 
treatment. Mitochondrial heterogeneity exacerbates the metabolic diversity of 
TNBC, with its dynamic functional regulation closely linked to cellular energy 
metabolism and signaling pathway adaptation. Interplay between OXPHOS, 
metabolites, and immune activity creates a self-reinforcing mechanism where 
metabolic adaptations in TNBC cells not only support their energy demands but 
also actively construct an immune-privileged niche that shields tumors from 
immune surveillance and limits the efficacy of treatments. These mechanisms and 
mitochondrial diversity could be heterogeneous and specific to TNBC subtypes. 
Thus, metabolic phenotyping of TNBC subtypes could reveal previously 
unidentified patient subgroups, potentially explaining divergent survival 
outcomes and offering metabolism-targeted therapeutic strategies that might 
improve outcomes for patients who currently lack effective treatment 
alternatives.

This case presents a rare instance of ulcerative colitis (UC) relapse in the 
functionally isolated left colon following surgery for rectal cancer associated 
with UC. A 62-year-old man, suspected of having cancer based on positron 
emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) findings and elevated 
carcinoembryonic antigen levels, underwent robot-assisted low anterior resection 
and temporary transverse colostomy. Postoperatively, leakage and infection made 
it difficult to administer conventional local treatments or corticosteroids; 
however, remission was achieved with the oral α4-integrin inhibitor, carotegrast 
methyl, allowing for stoma closure. To our knowledge, this report is the first 
to describe the use of carotegrast methyl for recurrent UC in a diverted colon. 
This case demonstrates that carotegrast methyl may serve as an effective 
steroid-sparing option for UC relapse in complex postoperative anatomical 
contexts. It also highlights the potential utility of PET-CT as an adjunctive 
diagnostic tool for UC-associated cancer.

Cancer survivors living in rural areas have poorer health outcomes due in part 
to poorer access to survivorship programs. This study evaluated the feasibility, 
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a scalable, remotely-delivered health 
coaching lifestyle intervention for cancer survivors. In this phase II pilot 
study, we recruited young and middle-aged adult cancer survivors (18-64 years) 
to participate in a remotely-delivered eight-week lifestyle behavior change 
intervention that included remote health coaching sessions (administered by 
trained student health coaches), remote health education videos, and a wearable 
activity/sleep monitor. Feasibility was measured by enrollment, retention, and 
attrition rates, while acceptability was assessed via a post-intervention 
survey. Preliminary efficacy was evaluated by changes in psychosocial 
mechanisms, health behaviors, and cancer-related health outcomes. Our enrollment 
rate (49%) fell just short of our target (50%). Our retention rate (83%) 
exceeded our target rate of 75%. Adherence rates also exceeded targets (75%) 
with 99% of remote health coaching sessions attended, 84% of educational videos 
viewed, and activity monitors worn on 87% of all intervention days. 
Acceptability rates were also high with most participants reporting the program 
was beneficial (90%) and that they would recommend it to others (87%). We 
observed medium-large effects for several secondary/exploratory outcomes 
including behavioral regulation skills (Cohen's d = 2.04), fatigue (d = 0.86), 
and global health scores (d = 0.99). No pre-post changes were observed for 
physical activity, diet, or sleep behaviors. Findings suggest it is feasible to 
deliver an acceptable remote lifestyle intervention to young and middle-aged 
cancer survivors. Improvements in targeted psychosocial and cancer-related 
health markers are promising and support the need for a larger, controlled 
follow-up study. These findings support the feasibility of delivering a remote, 
lifestyle behavior change program to young and middle-aged cancer survivors.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine general and digital information-seeking 
behaviors among U.S. cancer survivors and assess how these behaviors are 
patterned by sociodemographic and clinical factors. The study addressed a key 
gap in prior research by using registry-confirmed cancer data to explore 
disparities in digital engagement.
METHODS: Data were drawn from the 2021 Health Information National Trends 
Survey-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (HINTS-SEER), which 
included 1,234 cancer survivors from three SEER registries. Multivariable 
logistic regression models evaluated associations between information-seeking 
(general and digital) and sociodemographic (e.g., age, sex, income) and clinical 
factors (e.g., cancer site, stage at diagnosis, treatment effects).
RESULTS: Most survivors (77.8%) reported having sought cancer-related 
information, and 73.9% used digital tools to look for health information. 
Survivors who were younger, female, more educated, and with higher income were 
significantly more likely to engage in both general and digital 
information-seeking when compared to older, male, or less educated. Survivors 
reporting cancer- and treatment-related nausea or neuropathy were more likely to 
engage in information-seeking when compared to survivors without these symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors' engagement in information-seeking, especially 
through digital tools, is shaped by heterogeneity in age, sex, education, 
income, and clinical experiences. These findings highlight the persistence of 
the digital divide in survivorship care.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Equity-focused efforts are needed to support 
digital access and literacy among underserved survivors. Tailored interventions, 
plain-language digital content, and provider-facilitated referrals to digital 
evidence-based resources may help bridge informational gaps and enhance 
survivorship self-management.

PURPOSE: This exploratory analysis aims to assess the clinical feasibility of 
transitioning breast cancer (BC) survivors from intensive follow-up to a 
long-term surveillance strategy based on double-reading mammography within a 
population-based screening model.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Women who underwent BC surgery in 2013 and were followed 
for 10 years at a tertiary cancer center in Italy were retrospectively included. 
Recurrence rates and time to relapse were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test 
and Chi-square test. Available follow-up mammograms were independently reviewed 
by three experienced radiologists, blinded to clinical information, using a 
positive/negative binary scale. Pathology served as the reference standard. 
Sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and inter-reader agreement 
(Cohen's and Fleiss' κ) were calculated. Simulated double reading was analyzed 
using McNemar's test. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Among 505 women, 46 (9.1%) experienced BC recurrence: 19/271 (7.0%) in 
Luminal A, 6/84 (7.1%) in Luminal B, 3/28 (10.7%) in triple-negative (TN), 7/57 
(12.3%) in HER2-positive (HER2 +) cancers, and 11/65 (16.9%) in ductal carcinoma 
in situ (DCIS), which showed the highest recurrence rate (p = 0.0024). Median 
time to relapse ranged from 4.7 years (TN) to 8.1 years (Luminal A), with no 
statistically significant difference among the subtypes (p = 0.190). Individual 
reader sensitivity ranged from 67.7 to 74.2%, increasing to 77.4-83.9% with 
double reading. PPVs ranged from 95.4 to 100% for single reading and from 96.0% 
to 96.2% for double reading. Differences in sensitivity and PPV between single 
and double reading were not statistically significant (p = 1.0). Five 
recurrences (16.1%) were mammographically occult and clinically detected. 
Inter-reader agreement was moderate to good (Cohen's κ = 0.38-0.69; Fleiss' 
κ = 0.57).
CONCLUSIONS: Double-reading mammography showed a higher detection rate of BC 
recurrences compared to single reading in this exploratory setting, suggesting 
its potential role as a long-term surveillance strategy for BC survivors. 
However, the occurrence of relapses outside the mammographic field of view 
warrants careful consideration.

Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) preserve the architecture and heterogeneity of 
primary tumors and enable clinically relevant ex vivo testing. We describe 
standardized protocols for tumor tissue dissociation, extracellular-matrix 
embedding, tumor-type-specific medium formulation, serial passaging, and 
histologic and genomic evaluation, alongside quality control criteria to ensure 
viability and reproducibility across major solid cancers. These methods support 
precision oncology, drug screening, and translational studies using living 
biobanks of PDOs.

Ovarian cancer is a common malignancy affecting the female reproductive system. 
Curcumin (Cur) demonstrates potential as a treatment for ovarian cancer, but 
creating an effective curcumin-based drug delivery system remains challenging. 
The advent of the Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework (ZIF) system offers a novel 
approach for antitumor drug delivery. In this study, effective drug delivery to 
ovarian cancer cells was accomplished through the construction of a ZIF-based 
nanodrug delivery system, ZIF-Cur, that encapsulates curcumin. We verified that 
Cur delivered by ZIF enhanced mitochondrial ROS accumulation in tumor cells, 
thereby killing tumor cells. The system showed the well biosafety profile, 
offering a insight therapeutic perspective for ovarian cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a common eyelid 
malignancy that is typically treated by surgical excision. Locally destructive 
periocular cSCC may not be amenable to surgery in cases where extensive 
resection would result in structural or functional compromise.
METHODS: We report the first series of biopsy-confirmed periocular cSCC cases 
treated with intralesional interleukin-2 (IL-2)-based therapy.
RESULTS: Treatment courses for five patients are summarized, with one 
representative case detailed here. A 74-year-old man presented with a large, 
painful, centrally pedunculated mass on the left upper eyelid, measuring 5.5 cm 
by 2.5 cm. Mass excisional biopsy and reconstruction revealed moderately 
differentiated invasive SCC involving deep and peripheral margins. Given the 
risks associated with further resection, the patient opted to pursue local 
immunotherapy. He received five doses of intralesional IL-2 every 2 weeks. The 
lesion was completely clinically cleared at 6 weeks, and there was no recurrence 
noted at 15-month follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Local intralesional IL-2-based therapy may be a treatment option for 
periocular cSCC in cases that may result in significant functional or aesthetic 
compromise, or in those who have failed prior standard of care.

BACKGROUND: Accurate pathological evaluation and reporting of partial mastectomy 
specimens are essential for determining appropriate postoperative management in 
breast-conserving surgery. Although the Japanese Breast Cancer Society (JBCS) 
Guidelines provide recommendations regarding specimen handling, actual practices 
at individual institutions have not been fully clarified. This study aimed to 
assess the current status in Japan and identify aspects for improving the 
quality and standardization of pathological reporting.
METHODS: A nationwide survey was conducted among 247 institutions certified by 
the JBCS in Japan, and responses were obtained from 161 institutions. The 
questionnaire addressed various aspects of specimen handling, including 
sectioning orientation, definitions of margin positivity, and reporting formats. 
The responses were analyzed with reference to internationally recognized 
standards, and the same questionnaire was also distributed to selected 
international experts to enable supplementary comparison.
RESULTS: Margin positivity in invasive carcinoma was defined as tumor exposure 
by 83% of institutions, while 17% also considered close margins positive. 85% of 
institutions documented the distance to close margins, but this was less 
frequent than documentation of margin direction (94%) and histologic components 
(96%). For superficial (skin-side) and muscle-side margins, some institutions 
reported findings only when positive. Taken together, these inconsistencies 
raise concerns that clinically important information may not always be captured 
and communicated.
CONCLUSIONS: Specimen handling practices were generally consistent with national 
guidelines, but documentation of certain elements, such as the distance to close 
margins, varied among institutions. Further standardization of pathology 
reporting, with attention to international standards, is warranted to improve 
clarity and clinical utility.

BACKGROUND: The rising prevalence of gastric cancer in the upper third of the 
stomach has generated considerable interest in laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy 
(LPG). Traditional esophagogastric anastomosis after LPG has been associated 
with postoperative reflux issues. Despite the availability of various improved 
reconstruction techniques, there is still ongoing debate on the optimal 
approach. This network meta-analysis seeks to assess the reflux and nutritional 
outcomes associated with various reconstruction techniques subsequent to LPG.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed across five databases: 
PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. The 
reconstruction methods following LPG include esophagogastrostomy (EG), jejunal 
interposition (JI), jejunal pouch interposition (JPI), double-flap technique 
(DFT), double-tract reconstruction (DTR), gastric tube reconstruction (GT), and 
side overlap with fundoplication by Yamashita (SOFY). Network meta-analyses were 
performed to consolidate outcome measures, such as reflux esophagitis (RE), 
postoperative reflux symptoms, and nutritional status.
RESULTS: This meta-analysis encompasses 16 studies published from 2009 to 2023, 
involving a total of 1,184 participants and examining 7 distinct reconstruction 
methods. The results indicated that patients who received DFT [odds ratio (OR) 
13.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.86-61.45] had a significantly lower rate 
of RE compared to those who underwent EG, as did patients who underwent SOFY (OR 
4.58, 95% CI 1.16-18.10). Moreover, the DFT group demonstrated superior 
anti-reflux efficacy compared to the JI and DTR groups. Regarding nutritional 
status, both the JI group [standard mean difference (SMD) 12.16; 95% CI 
3.57-20.76] and the DFT group (SMD 9.16; 95% CI 2.21-16.11) exhibited higher 
albumin levels compared to the EG interventions.
CONCLUSION: DFT has shown promising efficacy in anti-reflux and postoperative 
nutritional status. Furthermore, SOFY demonstrates efficacy in the management of 
reflux, whereas JI is linked to improved postoperative nutritional outcomes 
following LPG. While providing valuable insights, it is important to note that 
the comparative analyses of JPI and SOFY rely on single-trial data with modest 
sample sizes, which may affect the precision of comparative effect estimates.
REGISTRATION: This network meta-analysis was registered on the PROSPERO 
(CRD42023414346).

Owing to its ever-growing range of pharmacological advantages, sulforaphane, an 
isothiocyanate from cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, is becoming 
increasingly popular. This review aims to provide a thorough understanding and a 
current update on the application of sulforaphane in cancer treatment. 
Sulforaphane interacts with many signaling molecules that control various 
pathways in malignant cells, including angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell cycle 
arrest, metastasis, and inflammation pathways. This review examines the effects 
of this isothiocyanate on inflammatory mediators, caspases, MMPs, cytokines, and 
the proteins Bax and Bcl-2. Furthermore, the advantages of nanotechnology and 
synergistic effects in sulforaphane applications are also reviewed. As per 
evidence, sulforaphane is a shining example of how ethno-pharmacological 
expertise can be used to create modern medications.

BACKGROUND: Early detection of metastasis in cancer patients plays a pivotal 
role in improving treatment outcomes and increasing patient survival. This study 
aimed to evaluate the predictive role of inflammatory indices, including 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), 
monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), systemic immune inflammation index (SII), 
and systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), in identifying metastatic 
status.
METHODS: In this study, 60 cancer patients were enrolled between December 2023 
and June 2024. Clinicopathological data and complete blood counts (CBCs) were 
collected prior to treatment initiation. The Receiver Operating Characteristic 
(ROC) curve was used to determine the optimal cutoff values of different 
baseline inflammatory indices for the metastatic status analysis.
RESULTS: The levels of inflammatory indices were greater in metastatic patients 
than in nonmetastatic patients; however, only the SIRI was significantly 
different (1.04 [0.76-1.69] vs. 0.71 [0.45-1.07]; P = 0.044). ROC curve analysis 
revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) for the SIRI was 0.652 (95% CI 
0.507-0.797). Furthermore, broader combinations of the SIRI and MLR, either 
individually or in conjunction with the NLR, PLR, and/or SII, yielded 
multi-index models with greater discriminatory power and maintained statistical 
significance (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that the SIRI, in combination with the MLR, 
plays a significant role in predicting the metastatic status of cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects motor and autonomic functions that 
reduce exercise capacity. Specifically, the loss of sympathetic drive following 
SCI at or above the sixth thoracic segment (≥ T6) can impair cardiovascular 
responses to exercise. This systematic scoping review aimed to identify 
ergogenic strategies that may augment the cardiovascular system and acutely 
enhance exercise performance in individuals with SCI.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using electronic databases 
(Medline, Embase, Web of Science) from inception to 1st April 2025. Studies were 
included if they met the following eligibility criteria: (1) human participants 
(aged ≥ 16 years); (2) any acquired SCI (traumatic, infection, cancer); (3) any 
sample size but must be > 80% SCI; (4) acute, single, volitional exercise 
sessions with cross-over design (i.e., ergogenic strategy and control sessions); 
(5) report a measurable exercise performance outcome, and (6) the strategy used 
to enhance performance must have a theoretical effect on the cardiovascular 
system. Data were extracted from eligible studies and charted. Hedges' g summary 
effect sizes were calculated to quantify the magnitude of effects across 
strategies.
RESULTS: A total of 7266 possible articles were identified. Following a 
full-text review, 32 articles were included. Findings were reported by strategy, 
defined as either mechanical (e.g., abdominal binders, lower-body compression, 
passive leg exercise and supine posture) or neuromodulatory [e.g., autonomic 
dysreflexia (AD), functional electrical stimulation (FES), 
pharmaceuticals/supplements/stimulants, and spinal cord stimulation (SCS)]. The 
neuromodulatory strategies appeared more robust at augmenting cardiovascular and 
performance outcomes, particularly AD, FES, and SCS.
CONCLUSIONS: We examined methods to improve acute exercise performance by 
augmenting the cardiovascular system in individuals with SCI. The large 
heterogeneity across methodologies and outcome measures made it challenging to 
draw conclusions regarding the underlying physiological mechanisms. 
Consequently, providing definitive recommendations on the best strategies to 
enhance performance was not possible based on current literature. Future 
research should be conducted across all ergogenic strategies, with a careful 
focus on females, trained and untrained participants, and individuals who are 
more likely to benefit from improvements in cardiovascular output (i.e., 
SCI ≥ T6). Registration This review was pre-registered on the Open Science 
Framework ( https://osf.io/w7apu/ ).

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, 
necessitating novel therapeutic targets. The plasma proteome represents a key 
source for such targets.
METHODS: Proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses 
were conducted to assess the causal effects of plasma proteins on lung cancer 
subtypes and complications. Genetic instruments (cis-pQTLs) for 2,090 proteins 
were derived from plasma proteome data (54,306 UK Biobank and 35,559 Icelandic 
participants). Lung cancer phenotype data were obtained from FinnGen R10.
RESULTS: MR identified seven plasma proteins showing significant causal 
associations with specific lung cancer phenotypes: high GGT1 increased non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) risk (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.10-1.46; PFDR = 0.0261), GFRA2 
increased the SCLC risk (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.24-2.21; PFDR = 0.0462), and higher 
advanced glycosylation end-product specific receptor reduced the squamous cell 
carcinoma risk (OR 0.338 per SD increase, 95% CI 0.209-0.548; PFDR = 0.0138). 
Fifteen proteins showed associations with lung cancer complications. 
Colocalization strongly supported causal roles for eight proteins: FKBP1B (OR 
1.15, 95% CI 1.09-1.22; PFDR = 0.00264), F11(OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01-1.01; PFDR = 
1.47 × 10- 23), ABO (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06-1.21; PFDR = 5.82 × 10- 9), F2 (OR 
3.04, 95% CI 1.74-5.31; PFDR = 0.0102), and VSIG10L (OR 1.006, 95% CI 1.00-1.01; 
PFDR = 0.0159).
CONCLUSION: This study reveals causal proteins for various lung cancer 
phenotypes and complications, emphasizing causal pathways and potential 
therapeutic targets for lung cancer and providing new insights into its 
etiology, prevention, treatment, and therapy.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of cancer-related 
mortality, with significant racial disparities in outcomes. Long non-coding RNAs 
(lncRNAs) MALAT1 and TUG1 are implicated in oncogenic pathways. Aberrant RNA 
splicing, a hallmark of cancer, is often driven by dysregulation of 
serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1), a key spliceosome regulator. The 
relationship between lncRNAs of splicing factors in cancer pathways remains 
underexplored, and thus, this study aimed to elucidate the roles of MALAT1 and 
TUG1 lncRNAs in relation to the SRPK1 inhibitor SPHINX31 in PCa.
METHODS: Bioinformatics tools were used to analyze interactions between` MALAT1, 
TUG1, relevant miRNAs, and target genes. A resazurin assay assessed PCa cell 
viability (PC-3 vs. HEK293) in response to SPHINX31 at 24 and 48 h. RT-qPCR was 
used to quantify MALAT1 and TUG1 lncRNAs expression levels.
RESULTS: The Alamar Blue assay indicated a time-dependent reduction in PC3 cell 
viability with 3 µM SPHINX31, particularly at 48 h. RT-qPCR revealed significant 
regulation of MALAT1 and TUG1, highlighting SRPK1's role in RNA pathways 
critical for tumor survival. SPHINX31 induced similar cytotoxic effects in 
HEK293 cells, illustrating the need for selective tumor specificity. MALAT1 
expression was upregulated at 24 h, followed by a decline at 48 h, indicating 
cumulative cellular stress in PC-3 cells.
DISCUSSION: This study demonstrated that SRPK1 inhibition alters lncRNA 
expression and splicing-related events in PCa. These findings highlight 
SPHINX31's potential as a therapeutic agent, especially in combination with 
treatments like Olaparib, necessitating further optimization for selectivity and 
reduced off-target effects.

BACKGROUND: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered the 'seeds' of recurrence 
after chemotherapy, but eliminating CSCs remains notoriously challenging. This 
study aims to examine whether cell cycle checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) blockade can 
abrogate the stemness of ovarian cancer (OC) cells, making them easier targets 
of anti-tumor immunity.
METHODS: Prexasertib was used to block CHK1 in OC cell lines and xenografts, and 
its cytotoxicity was assessed in vitro and in vivo. In vitro tumor-sphere 
formation assays and stemness markers were used to evaluate cell stemness. PD-L1 
expressions were examined via qRT-PCR, Western blot, flow cytometry, and 
immunohistochemistry. Prexasertib in combination with anti-PD-L1 antibody 
Atezolizumab was tested in immune-proficient mice bearing OC xenografts in terms 
of effects on tumor growth, tumor cell stemness, and tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes via tumor volume monitoring, immunohistochemistry, and flow 
cytometry.
RESULTS: Prexasertib effectively inhibited CHK1 phosphorylation, exhibited 
significant anti-tumor effects in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by decreased OC 
cell stemness. CHK1 was highly expressed in tumor spheres versus tumor cells 
cultured in 2D system, and Prexasertib treatment suppressed sphere formation and 
reduced the ALDH+ cell fraction. Unexpectedly, Prexasertib upregulated PD-L1 
expression in tumor cells. In vivo, combining Prexasertib with Atezolizumab led 
to more remarkable remission of tumors, when compared with Prexasertib or 
Atezolizumab alone. Meanwhile, the tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells significantly 
increased in the combination group, while exhausted T cells decreased; the 
treatments did not affect CD4+ cell infiltration.
CONCLUSION: Dual targeting of CHK1 and PD-L1 may improve OC treatment by 
simultaneously suppressing stemness and enhancing anti-tumor immunity.

Cervical cancer is a common cancer among women worldwide. It has been revealed 
that hypoxia contributes to the progression of cervical cancer. In our study, we 
discovered that hypoxia indeed promoted the malignant phenotypes of cervical 
cancer cells by enhancing glycolysis. Loss-of-function experiments showed that 
hypoxia treatment upregulated the octamer-binding transcriptional factor 4 
(OCT4) expression via glycolysis. Through the RNA-sequence and enrichment 
analyses, we found that hypoxia induced the enrichment of the calcium signaling 
pathway and upregulation of Calcium Release-Activated Calcium Modulator 3 
(ORAI3), which could be abrogated by silencing OCT4. Notably, overexpressing 
ORAI3 has similar effects on the malignant phenotypes of HeLa and SiHa cells as 
those of hypoxia. Furthermore, silencing ORAI3 or inactivating calcium signals 
significantly reversed OCT4-induced malignant progression of cervical cancer 
both in vitro and in vivo. ChIP and dual-luciferase reporter results confirmed 
that OCT4 contributed to the transcription of ORAI3. Mechanically, hypoxia 
upregulated OCT4 expression by facilitating glycolysis, and OCT4 overexpression 
enhanced the transcription of ORAI3, activating the calcium signaling pathway 
and ultimately promoting the malignant progression of cervical cancer. Our study 
reveals novel molecular mechanisms by which hypoxia induces the progression of 
cervical cancer, providing a new strategy for treating cervical cancer.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence and factors 
associated with fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) in post-menopausal women 5 years 
after the diagnosis of breast cancer (BC).
METHODS: Using data from the VICAN-5 survey, we included women with 
non-metastatic BC, aged 55 years or more at diagnosis, who had not experienced 
disease progression in the 5 years post-diagnosis. Multinomial logistic 
regression was used to identify factors associated with FCR, characterized using 
a three-level indicator: no, mild, and moderate/severe FCR derived from a single 
item.
RESULTS: Among the 382 women included, the mean age was 66 years at diagnosis. 
Five years later, 38% of women were still receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy 
(AET), and 27% were no longer on AET. Overall, 34.8% reported mild FCR, and 
14.2% reported moderate/severe FCR. Cancer-related sequelae, anxiety, and a 
decrease in physical activity were associated with mild or moderate/severe FCR. 
Moderate/severe FCR was also more often reported by women still on AET 
experiencing significant side effects and those who had never taken AET. Mild 
FCR was more frequent in the two-thirds of women consulting a GP for the 
management of their cancer.
CONCLUSION: Moderate/severe FCR affected one out of seven post-menopausal BC 
survivors 5 years after diagnosis, particularly those with anxiety, cancer 
sequelae, physical limitations, significant side effects of AET, but also among 
those who had never taken AET. BC survivors should be informed of long-term side 
effects of treatments, in particular AET, to help them cope with ongoing 
symptoms and related FCR.

PURPOSE: This study aims to examine the specific pathways through which 
spiritual needs are associated with satisfaction with life, focusing on the 
mediating roles of perceived quality of care and satisfaction with care among 
cancer patients.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with participants from four 
outpatient hematology/oncology clinics. Path analyses tested hypothesized 
relationships between spiritual needs and satisfaction with life, focusing on 
the mediating roles of perceived care quality and satisfaction with care.
RESULTS: A total of N = 727 participants were recruited, with a mean age of 
59.0 years; the majority were female (n = 483; 67.8%). Path analysis supported a 
serial multiple mediation model: higher spiritual needs were indirectly 
associated with lower satisfaction with life via lower perceived quality of care 
and reduced satisfaction with care. Specifically, greater spiritual needs were 
linked to lower perceived quality of care (Fig. 1c: spiritual needs quality of 
care; b = -0.73, p < 0.001), which was associated with lower satisfaction with 
care (quality of care satisfaction with care; b = 0.26, p < 0.001) and in turn, 
with lower satisfaction with life (satisfaction with care satisfaction with 
life; b = 0.40, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher spiritual needs were indirectly associated with lower 
satisfaction with life through a sequential pathway involving reduced 
perceptions of quality of care and lower satisfaction with care. Addressing 
spiritual needs and concerns in clinical settings may, therefore, play a 
critical role in improving both care experiences and psychosocial outcomes for 
cancer patients.

The thyroid gland is a unique endocrine organ, composed of morpho-functional 
units called thyroid follicles, which are responsible for thyroid hormone (TH) 
biosynthesis, an iodination process demanding a highly oxidative yet protected 
environment. Despite primary cilium (PC) being observed in the thyroid gland 
more than a century ago, its precise role in thyroid activity remains rather 
unexplored. Given its strategic position at the apical surface of follicular 
epithelium, projecting into the lumen, PCs are crucial for the regulation of TH 
biosynthetic processes. Consequently, changes in thyroid function, either 
physiological or pathological, are reflected in PC characteristics. Similarly, 
defects in ciliogenesis are expected to lead to different pathological thyroid 
alterations. This review summarizes the current understanding of PC's 
involvement in regulating normal thyroid activity and its modifications in 
functional and neoplastic thyroid diseases. Particular focus will be given to 
the notable loss of PCs in certain types of thyroid cancer and the promising 
potential of their restoration as a tumor suppressor strategy in thyroid 
tumorigenesis.

PURPOSE: To compare survival outcomes between patients undergoing upfront 
surgery and those receiving neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery for 
pancreatic cancer stratified by pathological stage.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 456 patients who underwent 
curative-intent pancreatectomy between 2011 and 2023. The study patients were 
categorized into upfront surgery (n = 290) and neoadjuvant therapy (n = 166) 
groups. The overall and disease-free survival rates were compared between the 
groups within each pathological stage. Univariate and multivariate analyses were 
performed for patients with Stage I disease.
RESULTS: In Stage IA, overall and disease-free survival were significantly 
better in the upfront surgery group than in the neoadjuvant therapy group 
(P = 0.0022 and P = 0.0012, respectively). There were no significant differences 
between the groups in patients with Stage II disease. A multivariate analysis of 
patients with Stage I disease identified neoadjuvant therapy (HR: 4.053, 
P = 0.0010), biliary drainage (HR: 2.342, P = 0.0399), and absence of adjuvant 
chemotherapy (HR: 4.563, P = 0.0004) as independent predictors of poor overall 
survival.
CONCLUSION: Even within the same pathological stage, the survival outcomes 
differed between the upfront surgery and neoadjuvant therapy groups. These 
findings suggest that treatment history should be considered when interpreting 
the pathological stage and assessing the prognosis of patients with pancreatic 
cancer.

Cancer cells harbor somatic mutations that generate novel amino acid sequences 
that are absent in the self-proteome. These mutation-derived cancer-specific 
peptides are defined as ""neo-peptides"". Neo-peptides eliciting immune responses, 
i.e. immunogenic neo-peptides, are defined as ""neo-epitopes"". Given their 
relevance to cancer immunotherapy, we conducted a meta-analysis to examine how 
experimental evidence informs our understanding of neo-epitopes. Our study is 
the largest reported to date. Using the cancer epitope database and analysis 
resource (CEDAR), we analyzed over 16,000 neo-peptides tested in more than 
20,000 T cell assays across 180 studies. We found that validated neo-epitope 
frequencies varied across cancer types, with the highest rates in skin and lung 
and the lowest in colorectal cancer. Neo-epitopes were enriched in driver genes 
such as TP53 and KRAS. However, testing frequency correlated with mutation 
prevalence, revealing bias toward recurrent mutations. Despite the high sequence 
similarity among RAS family members, validated neo-epitope overlap was minimal, 
challenging pan-RAS strategies. Shared neo-epitopes across cancer types are 
rare, with only 16 validated in more than one cancer type. While most assays 
involved HLA class I, class II alleles presented a higher proportion of 
validated neo-epitopes. Specific alleles, including HLA-B*40:01 and 
HLA-DRB1*11:01, were enriched for neo-epitopes, whereas others, like 
HLA-A*02:01, were enriched for non-immunogenic neo-peptides. Finally, amino acid 
substitutions that altered hydrophobicity or charge were more common in 
neo-epitopes. Together, these findings define key features of neo-epitopes, 
expose methodological and biological biases in the literature, and highlight 
opportunities to improve the selection and prioritization of neo-epitopes for 
cancer immunotherapy.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: An AI model that performs well during training does 
not guarantee similar performance in clinical practice and should be carefully 
evaluated before implementation. We aimed to evaluate a voxel-level trained AI 
model (AUROC 0.87), which utilizes a three-dimensional multiparametric 
transrectal prostate ultrasound (3D mpUS) to identify clinically significant 
prostate cancer (csPCa).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included patients with csPCa (Grade Group ≥ 2 and 
scheduled for radical prostatectomy (RP)) and without csPCa (PI-RADS ≤ 2 and/or 
negative systematic biopsies). Histopathology of RP specimens provided the csPCa 
reference standard. 3D mpUS consisted of grayscale, contrast-enhanced 
ultrasound, and shear-wave elastography using automated acquisition. We assessed 
patient-level diagnostic accuracy by comparing the results of simulated targeted 
biopsies based on the AI model with the reference standard in internal and 
external evaluation. Patients without csPCa and RP reference standard were used 
to determine specificity.
RESULTS: Based on internal evaluation of 250 patients, a sensitivity of 0.82 (CI 
0.75 to 0.87) and specificity of 0.43 (CI 0.32 to 0.55) was reached for 
ISUP ≥ 2. For ISUP ≥ 3, this was 0.90 (CI 0.83-0.95) and 0.39 (CI 0.31-0.47). In 
the external evaluation of 77 patients, the sensitivity for ISUP ≥ 2 was 0.81 
(CI 0.65-0.90), with a specificity of 0.42 (CI 0.28-0.57). For ISUP ≥ 3, this 
was 0.96 (CI 0.78-0.99) and 0.42 (CI 0.30-0.55).
CONCLUSIONS: The AI model based on 3D mpUS showed consistent patient-level 
performance for csPCa detection in internal and external evaluation, comparable 
to voxel-level analysis. These suggest strong generalizability and support 
prospective clinical trials.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04605276.
KEY POINTS: Question Does the diagnostic performance of a 3D multiparametric 
ultrasound-based AI model translate from voxel-level training to patient-level 
biopsy simulation? Findings Simulated biopsy performance aligned with 
voxel-level results, showing robust csPCa detection and supporting the model's 
generalizability across independent datasets. Clinical relevance The AI model's 
consistent biopsy simulation performance confirms its readiness for clinical 
evaluation and suggests diagnostic value in MRI-constrained settings.

The MEK-ERK pathway is a key driver of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
pathogenesis, and BRAF mutations, particularly BRAFV600E, can contribute to its 
activation. Although BRAFV600E mutations are rare in human HCC, they do occur, 
yet their physiologic impact in liver cells, especially when combined with 
frequent comutations in tumor suppressor genes, remains poorly understood. 
Moreover, the effect of BRAF inhibitors on HCC progression and metastasis is not 
well-defined. Therefore, we developed mouse models with hepatocyte-specific 
BRAFV600E expression and Trp53 or Cdkn2a deletion to assess tumor development, 
subtypes, and metastatic patterns. We found that BRAFV600E expression caused 
hepatomegaly, vascular congestion, and ductal reactions, and led to reduced 
liver function and early mortality. Codeletion of Trp53 or Cdkn2a markedly 
increased primary liver tumor incidence and enabled sarcomatoid metastasis. 
While the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 effectively reduced primary tumors and extended 
survival, it paradoxically increased sarcomatoid metastases. Mechanistically, 
PLX4720 and other RAF inhibitors induced TGFβ2 expression which promoted 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhanced tumorigenicity. The 
effects of RAF inhibitors on TGFβ2 expression were validated in BRAFV600E-mutant 
human melanoma cells. We conclude that BRAFV600E drives diverse primary tumors 
but only one type of metastasis and that RAF inhibition, while effective against 
primary tumors, may promote metastasis through TGFβ2-mediated EMT. Although RAF 
inhibitors remain promising therapies, their unintended role in enhancing 
metastasis raises concerns that may extend beyond liver cancer to other 
BRAFV600E-driven malignancies.

Benign and malignant (cancerous) tumors differ markedly in their impact on 
organismal fitness, yet studies in comparative oncology rarely distinguish 
between them. Using a Bayesian phylogenetic framework across birds and mammals, 
we show that while both tumor types increase in prevalence with body mass, only 
the prevalence of malignant tumors is negatively associated with the rate of 
body size evolution-suggesting that adaptive mechanisms of cancer defense are 
associated with rapidly evolving lineages. Additionally, the rate of lineage 
diversification is positively associated with the prevalence of both tumor types 
in birds but not mammals, potentially reflecting differences in genome 
architecture and speciation dynamics. Together, these results highlight distinct 
macroevolutionary drivers of benign versus malignant tumor prevalence and 
underscore the value of treating tumor types separately in comparative oncology.

Metabolic pathways are typically dysregulated in cancer to support critical 
cellular processes. In response to metabolic disturbances, cancer cells 
preferentially manipulate stress sensors to enhance their adaptability. Sestrin 
2 (SESN2), a highly conserved protein induced by various stressors, is 
implicated in this adaptation. Mutations and alterations of SESN2 are prevalent 
among cancer patients, suggesting a potential role in tumor progression. 
However, the functions and regulation of SESN2 in cancer, particularly in 
virus-induced cancer, remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that 
latent infection with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) stabilizes 
and upregulates SESN2 by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation across multiple 
cell lines. Notably, KSHV-encoded vCyclin, a homolog of cellular Cyclin D, 
directly interacts with SESN2 and promotes its stabilization by recruiting the 
deubiquitinase OTUB1, thereby blocking SESN2 polyubiquitination and proteasomal 
degradation. Moreover, vCyclin- and OTUB1-mediated stabilization of SESN2 
activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which supports the survival and 
growth of KSHV-driven primary effusion lymphoma cells. Importantly, the lysine 
at residue 74 of vCyclin is crucial for its cytosolic localization, OTUB1 
recruitment, and subsequent SESN2 upregulation and AMPK activation. These 
findings unveil a regulatory mechanism for SESN2 involving vCyclin and OTUB1, 
positioning them as potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with 
AMPK dysregulation.

OBJECTIVE: Regarding the participation of RUNX1 in lung cancer, we investigated 
its mechanism in regulating M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages in 
lung cancer.
METHODS: The extracted bone marrow cells were differentiated into macrophages 
(BMDMs), followed by tumor-conditioned medium (CM) stimulation to simulate the 
impact of tumor cells on macrophages in vivo, and treatment with RUNX1 shRNA, or 
pCDNA3.1-ACP5 and SIS3. Macrophage polarization and cytokine secretion were 
assessed by flow cytometry and ELISA, followed by evaluations of RUNX1, ACP5, 
p-β-catenin, β-catenin and p-SMAD3 levels. The ACP5-β-catenin interaction was 
detected by Co-IP. BMDMs were co-cultured with Lewis lung carcinoma cells using 
Transwell. The malignant behaviors of cells were assessed by CCK-8 and Transwell 
assays. In vivo experiments were conducted to verify roles of RUNX1.
RESULTS: Tumor-CM stimulated BMDM M2 polarization. RUNX1 was up-regulated in 
tumor-CM-stimulated macrophages and M2-type BMDMs, and was poorly expressed in 
M1-type BMDMs. RUNX1 knockdown induced M1 marker expression and reduced M2 
marker expression, and repressed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell 
malignant behaviors. The effects of RUNX1 silencing were partly abrogated by 
ACP5 overexpression. ACP5 interacted with β-catenin to promote SMAD3 
phosphorylation. Downregulation of SMAD3 phosphorylation partially reversed 
tumor-CM-promoted BMDM M2 polarization and NSCLC cell malignant behaviors. RUNX1 
promoted M2 polarization and NSCLC cell malignant behaviors by promoting 
ACP5-mediated SMAD3 phosphorylation. RUNX1 knockdown inhibited M2 polarization 
in LLC mice to suppress tumor growth in vivo.
CONCLUSION: RUNX1 promoted BMDM M2 polarization by facilitating the interaction 
between ACP5 and β-catenin to elevate SMAD3 phosphorylation, thus promoting 
NSCLC progression.

The discovery of translated alternative open reading frames (altORFs) in 
protein-coding regions has expanded the coding potential of viral, prokaryotic 
and eukaryotic genes. Experimental and computational approaches indicate that 
overlapping coding regions occur in mammals. In this study, I used a prediction 
method based on five criteria to detect novel altORFs in the human genes taken 
from the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census Database. Apart from the well characterized 
examples of human cancer-specific antigens expressed from altORF, the vast 
catalogue of nucleotide substitutions across cancer genes (the COSMIC database) 
is also likely to harbor previously uncharacterized altORFs. Under the five 
prediction criteria, I found 251 novel altORFs, 41 of which highly conserved in 
mammals and 60 uniquely resulting from nucleotide substitutions in the primary 
ORF of cancer genes. I found experimental evidence for 38% of the 251 novel 
altORFs from mass spectrometry and ribosome profiling databases. In particular, 
I found three altORFs in the proto-oncogene RET, three expressed altORfs in the 
isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 gene, and one expressed large altORF (498 nt) in the 
mutated TP53 gene. This study may offer clinical perspectives, because a 
potential source of cancer antigens may include antigens derived from 
translation of currently unannotated open reading frames. The altORFs detected

The [177Lu]Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy is a prostate-specific membrane antigen 
(PSMA) targeting treatment approved for patients with metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer, after failure of androgen deprivation 
therapy or taxane-based chemotherapy. We report a unique case of a patient with 
metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) who received PSMA 
radioligand therapy as the sole treatment, without any prior or additional 
systemic treatment. Over a span of 8 years, the patient underwent 12 cycles of 
[177Lu]Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy, demonstrating favorable therapeutic response 
and a prolonged androgen deprivation therapy-free period. This case highlights 
the potential of long-term PSMA radioligand therapy as a standalone option in 
selected mHSPC patients.

Gynecomastia can be the expression of physiological processes and be temporary 
in nature (pubertal gynecomastia) but can also occur at any other age. It is 
therefore a common illness and, depending on the severity of the symptoms, can 
mean a great deal of psychological stress for the patient. Enlargement of the 
male breast is usually a benign finding; causes can be endocrine disorders, 
previously undetected systemic diseases or drug side effects. Male breast cancer 
in particular is a rare but important differential diagnosis. The diagnostic 
evaluation therefore aims at an endocrine clarification and the exclusion of 
neoplasms. Treatment can be conservative or surgical.

Publisher: Gynäkomastie kann der Ausdruck physiologischer Prozesse und 
vorübergehender Natur sein (Pubertätsgynäkomastie), aber auch in jedem weiteren 
Lebensalter auftreten. Sie ist somit eine häufige Erkrankung und kann, je nach 
Schwere der Ausprägung, eine starke psychische Belastung für den Patienten 
bedeuten. Die Vergrößerung der männlichen Brust ist meist ein gutartiger Befund; 
Ursachen können endokrine Störungen, bisher unerkannte systemische Erkrankungen 
oder Arzneimittelnebenwirkungen sein. Insbesondere das männliche Mammakarzinom 
ist eine seltene, aber wichtige Differenzialdiagnose. Die diagnostische 
Evaluation zielt daher auf eine endokrine Abklärung und den Ausschluss einer 
Neoplasie. Die Therapie kann konservativ/medikamentös oder chirurgisch erfolgen.

The impact of gut microbiota modulation on responses to immune checkpoint 
inhibitors in cancer.

The gut microbiota has emerged as a critical determinant of antitumor immunity 
and a potential modulator of responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). 
Although pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest that specific bacterial taxa 
may influence both efficacy and immune-related adverse events (irAEs). However, 
the magnitude and consistency of these associations remain unclear. A systematic 
search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library was conducted 
through March 2025. Eligible studies evaluated baseline gut microbiota 
composition, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotic/prebiotic 
interventions, or antibiotic exposure in cancer patients treated with ICIs. 
Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free 
survival (PFS), and odds ratios (ORs) for response rates and irAEs, were 
estimated using random-effects models. Across 38 studies involving 5,642 
patients were included. Pooled analysis demonstrated that enrichment of 
Akkermansia muciniphila, Bifidobacterium longum and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii 
was significantly associated with improved OS (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.51-0.76) and 
PFS (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55-0.83). Conversely, antibiotic exposure before or 
during ICI treatment was associated with worse OS (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.45-2.34). 
Patients undergoing FMT from responders exhibited higher objective response 
rates (OR 2.91, 95% CI 1.48-5.73). Microbiota diversity indices were 
consistently higher in responders than in non-responders. Collectively, gut 
microbiota composition and its modulation significantly impact the therapeutic 
efficacy and toxicity profile of ICIs. These findings highlight the 
translational potential of microbiome-based biomarkers and interventions in 
optimizing immunotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest (CA) is common but deadly. Prior hospitalisation 
represents a missed opportunity for prevention and identification of high-risk 
groups before CA. This study aims to determine the extent of and underlying 
reasons for hospitalisations during the 30-day period preceding an admission 
with CA.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the United States 
National Readmission Database (NRD) during 2018-2020. We evaluated 
hospitalisations with a diagnosis of CA and admissions in the 30-day period 
before hospitalisation with CA. Multiple logistic regressions were used to 
identify factors associated with prior hospitalisation and mortality on 
admission with CA.
RESULTS: Among 1,637,240 hospital episodes with CA, 255,500 (15.6%) had an 
admission to hospital in the 30-day period prior to hospitalisation with a 
diagnosis with CA. The categories for causes of previous admissions were 
disorders of the circulatory system (27%), infectious and parasite disease 
(13%), and disorders of the respiratory system (12%). The most common diagnoses 
were sepsis, hypertensive heart and renal disease, acute myocardial infarction, 
and respiratory failure. Cancer (OR 2.09 95%CI 2.04-2.15, p < 0.001), chronic 
kidney disease (OR 1.45 95%CI 1.42-1.48, p < 0.001), and chronic lung disease 
(OR 1.25 95%CI 1.22-1.27, p < 0.001) were the most significant factors 
associated with prior admission. Previous hospital admission was associated with 
increased odds of mortality (OR 1.58 95%CI 1.55-1.62, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalisations within the 30-day period preceding an admission 
with CA are common and occur in about 1 out 6 patients. The most common primary 
diagnoses for prior hospitalisation were sepsis, renal and cardiovascular 
disease.

BACKGROUND: While there is evidence that Fusobacterium spp. in colon tissue is 
associated with prognosis, less is known about the association between antibody 
response to antigens expressed by fusobacteria and colorectal cancer 
(CRC)-specific mortality.
METHOD: Antibody responses to 11 Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC 25586) antigens 
were measured in pre-diagnostic blood for 471 incident CRC cases (median time to 
diagnosis=3.4 years), among whom 188 CRC-specific deaths and 250 total deaths 
were confirmed over a median follow-up of 9.2 years in the European Prospective 
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. Cox models were conducted 
to examine associations between antigen seropositivity and CRC-specific 
mortality.
RESULTS: Seropositivity to fusobacterial antigens was not associated with 
overall or CRC-specific mortality, individually or combined. Similar results 
were observed when restricting to patients who donated blood <3 years prior to 
cancer diagnosis. When restricting to individuals diagnosed at an earlier age of 
onset (<55 years; N=74), we observed positive associations for seropositivity to 
three fusobacteria antigens reflecting different putative autotransporter 
adhesins. The strongest association was for Fn1893 antigen seropositivity (HR: 
6.95, 95% CI: 1.78-27.2, compared to none) and CRC-specific mortality, but 
confidence intervals were wide.
CONCLUSIONS: While null overall, this is the first study to observe an 
association between antibody response to fusobacteria and CRC-specific mortality 
among individuals with earlier onset CRC. Future studies are needed to confirm 
these findings and understand the role of systemic antibody responses to 
fusobacteria in cancer.
IMPACT: Specific antigens expressed by fusobacteria may play a role in mortality 
from earlier onset CRCs.

Natural killer (NK) cell therapy is a promising approach for cancer 
immunotherapy; however, its clinical efficacy is limited by the low migration 
and infiltration of NK cells into solid tumors. Therefore, we used cell 
magnetization technology to enhance NK accumulation at tumor sites by incubating 
NK cells with ferucarbotran, a superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle. We 
observed that NK cells could be magnetized, but their viability and cytotoxic 
function were significantly reduced because of lipid peroxide accumulation. 
However, treatment with the ferroptosis inhibitor restored NK cell function by 
inhibiting lipid peroxide accumulation. Additionally, NK cell magnetization 
decreased the expression of key anti-ferroptosis proteins, suggesting that 
magnetization induced ferroptosis. Furthermore, in a murine B16F10 melanoma 
mouse model, magnetized NK cells and ferroptosis inhibitors were transferred to 
tumor-bearing mice, followed by the application of a neodymium magnet to the 
tumor site to guide NK cell accumulation. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed 
increased NK cell accumulation in the tumor tissue, suggesting that 
magnetization improved NK cell delivery to the tumor. Magnetized NK cells with 
the ferroptosis inhibitor significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged 
survival. These findings indicate that combining cell magnetization technology 
with ferroptosis inhibitors enhances NK cell therapy by improving tumor 
infiltration while preserving the cytotoxic function. This novel approach may be 
a promising strategy for improving the efficacy of NK cell-based therapies, 
particularly for solid tumors.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is characterized by extensive desmoplasia, with 
heterogeneous cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a major component. 
However, the contribution of distinct precursor cells to CAF heterogeneity 
remains poorly defined. This study investigated the role of Muc5ac in modulating 
CAF heterogeneity by maturing precursor cells, including adipose-derived 
mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs), bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs), and 
pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), into different CAF subsets. RNA sequencing of 
precursor cells treated with conditioned media from Muc5ac-proficient or 
-deficient cancer cells revealed distinct transcriptional profiles. Muc5ac 
significantly increased the expression of DNMT3B and TET1 in AD-MSCs, promoting 
the acquisition of extracellular matrix production, cytokine signaling, and 
antigen-presentation programs characteristic of both inflammatory (iCAF) and 
myofibroblastic CAF phenotypes (myCAF). In PSCs, Muc5ac increased H3K27 
acetylation independent of its interactome, which was validated in autochthonous 
murine models. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that AD-MSCs contributed 
44.4% to the CAF population, followed by PSCs (31.5%) and BM-MSCs (21.6%). Gene 
ontology and KEGG analyses revealed distinct functional programs for each 
precursor population contributing to CAF heterogeneity. An age-dependent 
signature in AD-MSC maturation was identified, with a significant positive 
correlation between serum INHBA and MUC5AC from younger (≤55 years, n=20) 
compared with older patients (≥75 years, n=20).

OBJECTIVES: To characterize fine particulate matter (PM 2.5)-bound polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emitted from different cooking fumes and their 
exposure routes and assess their health-associated impact to provide a reference 
for health risk prevention from PAH exposure across different age and sex 
groups.
METHODS: Sixteen PM 2.5-bound PAHs emitted from 11 cooking styles were analyzed 
using GC-MS/MS. The health hazards of these PAHs in the Handan City population 
(stratified by age and sex) were predicted using the incremental lifetime cancer 
risk ( ILCR) model. The respiratory deposition doses ( RDDs) of the PAHs in 
children and adults were calculated using the PM 2.5 deposition rates in the 
upper airway, tracheobronchial, and alveolar regions.
RESULTS: The total concentrations of PM 2.5-bound PAHs ranged from 61.10 to 
403.80 ng/m 3. Regardless of cooking styles, the ILCR total values for adults 
(1.23 × 10 -6 to 3.70 × 10 -6) and older adults (1.28 × 10 -6 to 3.88 × 10 -6) 
exceeded the acceptable limit of 1.00 × 10 -6. With increasing age, the ILCR 
total value first declined and then increased, varying substantially among the 
population groups. Cancer risk exhibited particularly high sensitivity to short 
exposure to barbecue-derived PAHs under equivalent body weights. Furthermore, 
barbecue, Sichuan and Hunan cuisine, Chinese cuisine, and Chinese fast food were 
associated with higher RDDs for both adults and children.
CONCLUSION: ILCR total values exceeded the acceptable limit for both females and 
males of adults, with all cooking styles showing a potentially high cancer risk. 
Our findings serve as an important reference for refining regulatory strategies 
related to catering emissions and mitigating health risks associated with 
cooking styles.

This systematic review aimed to synthesize published data on the application of 
gallium-68 pentixafor PET/computed tomography ([68Ga]Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT) or 
PET/MRI (PET/MRI) in patients diagnosed with various lymphomas and solid 
malignancies. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across Cochrane, 
Ovid PubMed/MEDLINE, and Embase databases for articles indexed up to July 2023. 
Thirty-seven studies or subsets within studies met the inclusion criteria for 
analysis. Key findings indicate that lymphomas, including those with low 
[18F]FDG avidity such as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia, marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), and central nervous system lymphoma, 
demonstrate [68Ga]Ga-Pentixafor avidity. Among lymphomas, mantle cell lymphoma 
and MZL showed particularly high uptake. [68Ga]Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT or PET/MRI 
demonstrated utility for staging and treatment response assessment in several 
solid tumors, including lung cancer [small-cell lung cancer, large cell 
neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung (LCNEC), nonsmall cell lung cancer 
(adenocarcinoma (AC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC))], glioblastoma multiform, 
vestibular schwannoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, esophageal cancer, 
and aldosterone-producing adenoma. The review suggests that [68Ga]Ga-Pentixafor 
PET holds promise for personalized diagnosis and therapy, potentially offering 
advantages over [18F]FDG PET in certain malignant conditions. Despite 
limitations such as study heterogeneity and varying patient numbers per tumor 
type, [68Ga]Ga-Pentixafor PET is a potentially valuable imaging modality for 
staging and response evaluation, particularly in nonsolid malignancies like 
lymphomas. Further research is needed to fully clarify its role in solid tumors.

Introduction: The Gleason score plays a key role in risk stratification and 
surgical treatment selection for prostate cancer. This study evaluates the 
correlation between Gleason score, patient age, and tumor aggressiveness, with 
implications for medical practice. Methods: This retrospective study included 
215 patients from Sf. Apostol Andrei Clinical Emergency Hospital of Constanta 
County (2023-2024) with histopathologically confirmed prostate lesions. 
Demographic variables (age), Gleason score (classified according to ISUP 2019), 
and histological grade were analyzed. Data were statistically analyzed using t 
tests, ANOVA, and logistic regression. While international guidelines provide a 
standardized framework for management, local and regional variations in 
healthcare access, diagnostic pathways, and patient preferences significantly 
influence real-world clinical practice. This study aims to describe the 
histopathological spectrum of prostatic lesions and evaluate the prognostic 
relevance of the Gleason score in surgical decision-making within the specific 
context of a Romanian tertiary care center. By highlighting regional 
particularities, such as the high burden of aggressive disease and the 
challenges in implementing active surveillance, our findings contribute to a 
more nuanced understanding of global prostate cancer care. Results: Benign 
prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) accounted for 42.8% of cases, PCa for 44.7%, and 
urothelial carcinoma for 8.4%. Among prostate cancers, 87.5% had clinically 
significant disease (Gleason >=7), with 29.2% high-risk (Gleason 8-10). Gleason 
7 was most frequent (58.3%), predominantly 3+4. A significant correlation was 
observed between advanced age ( >70 years) and tumor aggressiveness (OR = 2.3; 
95% CI: 1.4-3.8). Radical prostatectomy was primarily chosen for Gleason scores 
>=7, with higher complication rates in older patients. Conclusions: Advanced age 
and a high Gleason score are independent factors of tumor aggressiveness. Early 
surgical intervention in patients with Gleason >=7 improves oncological 
outcomes. Integrating histopathology with multiparametric MRI and molecular 
biomarkers could optimize management of these patients.

Perioperative Risk in Colon Cancer: The Dual Burden of Tumor-Related Anemia and 
Cardiac Comorbidity.

Leopa N, Badea A, Pundiche M, Botnarciuc M, Ispas V, Paitici S, Parepa IR, Tocia 
C, Dumitru A, Popescu I, Ispas S, Buşu D, Popescu RZC.

Background: Colon cancer is a common malignancy with significant complications, 
particularly gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia, requiring emergent 
transfusions. The aim of the study is to explore the complex relationship 
between emergent transfusions in colon cancer patients and their concurrent 
cardiac pathology. Methods: A retrospective case-control study conducted between 
January 2020 - February 2024 in South-Eastern Romania focused on adult patients 
with colon cancer and moderate/severe anemia. The study included patients with 
advanced-stage colon adenocarcinoma, complicated tumors requiring blood 
transfusions, and excluded those with mild anemia, cancer history, or previously 
transfusions for the same condition. Patients were analyzed based on their 
anemia severity, demographic and clinical characteristics, and perioperative 
outcomes, with a specific focus on the impact of concurrent cardiac pathology. 
Results: The study included 153 patients, divided into two groups based on 
anemia severity: moderate anemia (MA, n=124) and severe anemia (SA, n=29). No 
significant differences were found in tumor histopathology or stage between the 
two groups, though significant differences were observed in blood loss, 
invasions, and transfusion needs. Postoperative outcomes showed a higher rate of 
complications, longer hospital stays, and increased mortality in the SA group 
compared to the MA group. Additionally, cardiac comorbidities were associated 
with more severe anemia, increased intraoperative blood loss, longer surgery 
duration, and a higher need for transfusions, as well as more frequent 
postoperative complications. Conclusions: Severe anemia and pre-existing cardiac 
conditions are linked to poorer surgical outcomes, greater transfusion 
requirements, and higher complication rates.

Comparative Analysis of Nutritional and Immune Status using the Conut Score in 
Patients Undergoing Billroth I and Billroth II / Roux-en-Y Reconstruction.

Cosma C, Butiurca VO, Nicolescu C, Russu PC, Botoncea M, Molnar C.

Background: Gastric cancer surgery requires not only oncological radicality but 
also functional reconstruction. Billroth I remains the most physiological method 
of restoring continuity, whereas Billroth II and Roux-en-Y are most frequently 
adopted in the oncological treatment. Nutritional and immune competence strongly 
influence postoperative outcomes, and the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) 
score has emerged as a validated biomarker integrating albumin, lymphocyte 
count, and cholesterol in predicting complications in surgically treated 
patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational single-center study 
including 150 patients undergoing curative distal gastrectomy between October 
2021 and December 2024. Reconstruction was performed using Billroth I (n=72) or 
Billroth II/Roux-en-Y (n=78). The CONUT score was assessed preoperatively (T0), 
early postoperatively (T1), and at three months (T2). Outcomes included CONUT 
evolution, postoperative complications (Clavien Dindo), length of stay, 
readmission, and mortality. Results: Both reconstruction groups demonstrated a 
significant postoperative increase in CONUT score (median 2 [1-3] at T0 to 3 
[2-4] at T1, p 0.001), followed by partial recovery at three months. No 
differences were observed between Billroth I and Billroth II/Roux-en-Y at any 
timepoint. Higher CONUT values at T0, T1, and T2 independently predicted overall 
and major complications (OR range 1.15 1.25, p 0.05). Postoperative morbidity, 
mortality (3.3%), and hospital stay were similar across groups. Conclusions: The 
CONUT score is an independent predictor of perioperative morbidity in gastric 
cancer, while the choice of reconstruction method does not significantly alter 
immunonutritional trajectories. Serial CONUT monitoring may enhance 
perioperative risk stratification.

Comparative Evaluation of Ultrasound and Mammography for Assessing Resection 
Margins in Breast-Conserving Therapy for Breast Cancer.

Georgescu R, Bauer O, Turdean S, Tutuianu F, Darii E, Moraru P, Toganel A, Radoi 
CT.

Introduction: Various techniques for intraoperative measurement of resection 
margins have been explored to prevent positive margins in breast-conserving 
surgery. Although multiple methods exist, none is perfect, and most are costly 
and not easily accessible. Material and Methods: This prospective study was 
conducted at the Surgical Clinic of Mures County Clinical Hospital, utilizing 
data from breast cancer patients who underwent conservative treatment between 
2014 and 2019. Resection margins were measured using ultrasound and mammography, 
and these values were compared with histopathological reports. Results: A total 
of 166 patients were enrolled, with 10 patients (6.02%) having positive 
resection margins. For ultrasound, at a 2 mm cut-off, sensitivity was 63.86% and 
specificity was 93.98%; at a 5 mm cut-off, sensitivity increased to 95.78% with 
the same specificity of 93.98%. For mammography, at a 2 mm cut-off, sensitivity 
was 6.627% and specificity was 93.98%; at a 5 mm cut-off, sensitivity was 37.35% 
with the specificity remaining at 93.98%. Conclusions: Ultrasound at a 5 mm 
cut-off showed higher sensitivity compared to a 2 mm cut-off, while mammography 
showed low sensitivity at both cut-offs. These results indicate that, while both 
methods have high specificity, their accuracy and sensitivity vary, 
necessitating cautious interpretation for clinical use.

Three Dimensional Conformal versus Volumetric Arc Therapy in Gynecological 
Cancer: A Retrospective Study Evaluating Therapeutic Effect and Toxicity.

Kantzou I, Georgakopoulos I, Markou I, Vorgias G, Gerede A, Bekou E, Mulita F, 
Liolis E, Iavazzo C, Ioannidou S, Markouizou A, Sarris G, Kouloulias V, 
Zygogianni A.

Introduction: Technological advances in the field of radiation therapy have 
established modern techniques like Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) as 
the radiation treatment of choice for nearly all malignancies. Unfortunately, 
due to many reasons that are not in the scope of this paper, even nowadays not 
all patients have access to these modern techniques and are managed with the 
""older"" Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy (3DCRT). Methods: In this 
retrospective study, we performed a comparison of VMAT to 3DCRT by terms of five 
(5) year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and toxicity in 
patients treated for endometrial and cervical cancer. A total of 173 
gynecological cancer patients treated with either VMAT or 3D-CRT technique were 
included in this study: 73 patients (Group A) were treated with VMAT, and 100 
patients (Group B) were managed with 3D-CRT technique. The endpoints of this 
trial were: disease free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity of 
treatment. Results: Our results showed significant 5-year DFS advantage for the 
patients in group A, while OS had no significant difference between the two 
groups. Conclusion: Reduced toxicity was demonstrated in group A compared to 
group B, regarding mostly gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity.

Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Endometrial Cancer: Our Initial Experience in a 
Resource Limited Setting.

Kiss SL, Stanca M, Căpîlnă DM, Căpîlnă TE, Pop-Suciu M, Kiss BI, Kiss SL, 
Căpîlnă ME.

Background: Nodal status is one of the most important prognostic factors in 
endometrial cancer (EC), but systematic lymphadenectomy is associated with 
significant morbidity. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping offers a less invasive 
alternative. However, data are limited where indocyanine green is unavailable. 
Methods: Between November 2019 and March 2025, 29 women with FIGO stage IÃ¢?""III 
EC were prospectively enrolled in this study. Cervical injection of methylene 
blue, with or without technetium-99m, was used for SLN mapping. Ultrastaging was 
performed routinely. In patients with high-risk disease, full pelvic and 
para-aortic lymphadenectomy was also performed. Detection rates, sensitivity, 
and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Results: Overall and 
bilateral detection rates were 75% and 48%, respectively (methylene blue: 72% / 
44%; dual tracer: 100% / 75%). Nodal metastases were identified in 9 of 29 
patients (31%). Patient-level sensitivity was 71%, with an NPV of 88%. 
Application of the side-specific completion algorithm increased sensitivity to 
86%. Side-specific sensitivity and NPV reached 100%. Lymphovascular space 
invasion and 50% myometrial invasion were significantly associated with nodal 
metastasis (p 0.05). No mapping-related complications were observed. 
Conclusions: SLN mapping with methylene blue, with or without technetium, 
combined with a side-specific completion algorithm, enables reliable nodal 
staging even without fluorescence imaging.

Lymphadenectomy Indications in Endometrial Cancer. A Surgeon's Dilemma in the 
Era of Perpetual Changes.

Ignat IM, Minciuna CE, Sima RM, Ples L, Poenaru MO, Diaconescu A, Vasilescu C.

Background: The role of lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer has long been 
debated. Once considered to have prognostic and therapeutic value, it is now 
evident that balancing accurate staging with procedure-related morbidity remains 
a challenge. Objective: This review aims to clarify the current indications for 
systematic lymphadenectomy in endometrial carcinoma, integrating the updated 
FIGO 2023 staging system, the ESGOESTRO- ESP 2025 guidelines, and the emerging 
role of molecular classification. Methods: We analyzed landmark randomized 
controlled trials, updated guideline recommendations, and the evolving paradigm 
of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping, with emphasis on risk stratification based 
on histology, grade, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), and molecular 
features. Results: High-level evidence demonstrated that systematic 
lymphadenectomy does not improve survival in early-stage disease, while 
significantly increasing morbidity. Current guidelines remain complex, but 
consistently emphasize SLN mapping as the preferred method of nodal assessment. 
Systematic lymphadenectomy is no longer justified as routine; it is reserved for 
high-intermediate and high-risk patients when SLN mapping fails, performed as 
side-specific dissection. In advanced disease, the surgical goal is complete 
cytoreduction, with selective removal of bulky or suspicious nodes; systematic 
lymphadenectomy must not be performed in stages III-IV. Conclusion: The paradigm 
has shifted from universal lymphadenectomy to a tailored, risk-adapted approach. 
SLN biopsy represents the new standard, reducing morbidity without compromising 
oncologic outcomes. Expanding access to molecular profiling, still limited in 
Romania, is crucial for better oncological results and alignment with European 
standards.

The Role of Laparoscopic Triage in the Management of Advanced Ovarian Cancer: A 
Review of Literature.

Dalaty M, Nicodin MA, Nicodin OV, PuşcaÃ Iu L, Căpîlnă ME.

Advanced ovarian cancer is frequently diagnosed at late stages, necessitating 
precise and individualized treatment strategies. Surgical cytoreduction remains 
the cornerstone of treatment, with complete macroscopic tumor resection offering 
the best survival outcomes. However, accurately assessing resectability remains 
a major challenge. This review aims to evaluate the role of staging laparoscopy 
in triaging patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, with a focus on 
its utility in determining surgical resectability and guiding treatment 
pathways. Emphasis was placed on predictive scoring systems: clinical scores 
(Suidan score), operative scores (Fagotti, PCI, Eisenkop) and postoperative 
scores (Aletti). Laparoscopic triage has shown greater predictive accuracy than 
traditional imaging in evaluating tumor resectability. Scoring systems such as 
the Fagotti and the Peritoneal Cancer Index provide validated intraoperative 
frameworks. International guidelines, such as ESMO, ESGO, NCCN, and ASCO, 
support laparoscopy for preoperative assessment, although its implementation 
remains limited in some countries, including Romania. Challenges include the 
lack of standardization, restricted access to advanced laparoscopic 
infrastructure, and the risk of port-site metastases. Staging laparoscopy is a 
valuable tool in the management of advanced ovarian cancer, aiding in the 
selection of optimal treatment strategies. Future integration of radiomics, 
artificial intelligence, and molecular profiling holds promise for fully 
personalized patient care.

Medication, particularly antibiotics, significantly alters gut microbiome 
composition, often reducing microbial diversity and affecting host health. Given 
that the gut microbiome may influence cancer progression, we integrated 
clinical, shotgun metagenomic, and medication data to assess microbiome 
composition across diseased and healthy cohorts, as well as the impact of 
medication on microbiome variation. The study cohorts included patients with 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, n = 85), acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 
61), myeloid dysplastic syndrome (MDS), and other severe hematological 
malignancies (n = 104); patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery (n = 
89); and kidney donors (n = 9), all collected as part of a consecutive 
microbiome sampling effort at Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark; and 
healthy individuals (N = 59). First, our analyses revealed similarities in both 
diversity and composition between microbiomes of patients with CLL and patients 
prior to elective cardiac surgery, whereas patients with AML and MDS exhibited 
the least diverse and most distinct microbiomes. Second, when we quantified 
sources of microbiome variation, the combination of medication, disease, age, 
and sex accounted for 4% of variation between all cohorts and 10.4% of variation 
between CLL and pre-cardiac surgery patients only; the two cohorts selected for 
comparison due to their similar microbiomes. Notably, this left 90%-95% of the 
variation unexplained, emphasizing the need for better identification of the 
parts of the microbiome variation impacting health and disease. Third, using a 
machine learning approach, we validated and further refined the CLL-associated 
microbiome pattern from our previous studies. Overall, our data provide a 
foundation for further investigation into disease-specific microbial signatures 
and the potential interactions between medication, underlying disease, and the 
microbiome, with the ultimate goal to improve our understanding and clinical 
management of CLL.IMPORTANCEThis study reveals how disease and medication 
influence the gut microbiome in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 
when compared to other more severe hematological malignancies, a cohort of 
patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery representing a severely diseased 
nonhematological cohort, and a cohort of healthy individuals. We found that 
patients with CLL and those scheduled for cardiac surgery had the most similar 
microbiome diversity and composition. Similarities across very different disease 
contexts suggest that disease status alone has limited impact. Consistently, 
across all cohorts, medication, disease, age, and sex together explained only 
less of microbiome variation, leaving 90%-95% unexplained. This underscores the 
important need for better identification of factors shaping the microbiome. In 
addition, we validated a previously published, machine learning-based 
CLL-associated microbiome signature, demonstrating the robustness of our 
previous findings differentiating the microbiome signature for CLL as compared 
to healthy individuals. The findings expand knowledge on how disease states and 
medical treatments shape gut microbiome composition and diversity, potentially 
leading to new ways of managing CLL and improving patient outcomes through 
microbiome signatures.

EGFR mutations are common oncogenic drivers in non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), and around one-third of patients develop brain metastases over the 
course of their disease. Patients with non-classical EGFR mutations, such as 
insertions in exon 20, are a high unmet need with a worse prognosis compared to 
patients with classical EGFR mutations. Here, we describe the discovery and 
development of enozertinib (formerly ORIC-114), a highly brain-penetrant, orally 
bioavailable, irreversible inhibitor that targets EGFR exon 20 mutations with 
unparalleled kinome selectivity. Preclinical studies revealed strong potency and 
tumor regressions driven by enozertinib across a broad range of atypical EGFR 
mutant models. In a phase I clinical trial of enozertinib in patients with 
advanced NSCLC bearing atypical mutations in EGFR, a patient with harboring an 
EGFR exon 20 insertion experienced sustained complete response of all systemic 
and brain metastases. Together, these findings identify enozertinib as a 
promising investigational inhibitor to meet the unmet need for brain-penetrant 
therapies for NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertions or other atypical mutations.

Extensive muscle loss is an irreversible affliction of both cancer patients 
(cachexia), and aging individuals (sarcopenia). In this study, we have exploited 
vertebrate zebrafish and the optical transparency of its larvae to address the 
underlying similarities between the two conditions, and the cause-and-effect 
relationships driving muscle loss. We found that zebrafish larvae microinjected 
with metastatic lung cancer cells exhibit cachectic phenotypes, mimicking the 
human pathology. Using bioinformatics, we found that the cancer cells, marked by 
active Wnt signaling, release the Secreted Frizzled-Related Protein 2 (SFRP2). 
Consistent with this, Wnt pathway target genes were found to be differentially 
expressed in cachectic larvae, perhaps through overactivation of its 
contemporaneously expressed zebrafish muscle-specific receptors. This causes 
structural alterations in mitochondria and the loss of myofibrillar pattern, 
resulting in impaired locomotion and cardiac tamponade, and, ultimately, muscle 
atrophy through apoptosis and necrosis. This work added to the understanding of 
the role of Wnt signaling in cachexia, and highlights the versatility of the 
zebrafish larval model. Further, it paved the way for developing therapeutic 
targets to manage muscle mass loss in elderly and diseased individuals.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment 
(PG-SGA) is a standardized tool for assessing malnutrition in patients with 
cancer. The primary aim of this study was to assess the impact of preoperative 
nutritional status as measured by PG-SGA on survival in patients requiring 
surgical intervention and/or radiotherapy for spinal metastases.
METHODS: Patients with spinal metastases who underwent surgery and/or radiation 
therapy for symptomatic spinal metastases were enrolled in the AO Spine 
Metastatic Tumor Research and Outcomes Network, a prospective international 
multicenter research registry, between September 2017 and August 2022. Using the 
PG-SGA, nutritional status was classified into 3 categories: A, well nourished; 
B, moderately malnourished; and C, severely malnourished.
RESULTS: A total of 589 patients met the inclusion criteria; 362 were classified 
as well nourished (61%), 159 were moderately malnourished (27%), and 68 were 
severely malnourished (12%). The median survival was 491 days, 328 days, and 117 
days for well-nourished, moderately malnourished, and severely malnourished 
patients, respectively. In the multivariate analyses, severe malnourishment (HR 
2.5 95% CI 1.4-4.3, P < .01) and an ECOG performance status of 3 or 4 (HR 2.7 
95% CI 1.2-6.0) remained associated with significantly worse survival.
CONCLUSION: Malnutrition as measured by the PG-SGA demonstrated to be 
significantly and independently associated with postoperative survival. The 
PG-SGA is a simple and useful tool to identify spinal metastases patients at 
risk of early postoperative mortality, and inclusion in the preoperative 
evaluation of these patients should be considered.

Background: There is limited information about the clinical behavior and no 
standardized treatment guidelines for primary thyroid lymphoma (PTL). Prognostic 
factors and treatment outcomes remain poorly defined despite diagnostic and 
therapeutic advancements. We evaluated PTL survival outcomes and treatment 
strategies, using a large population-based cohort from the Tokyo Cancer Registry 
(TCR), a government-operated database that systematically collects cancer 
incidence and outcome data in Tokyo, Japan. Patients and Methods: This 
retrospective, population-based study analyzed PTL cases registered in 2012-2020 
in the TCR. The patients (n = 401) were identified through an International 
Classification of Diseases for Oncology, third edition topography code C73.9 
(thyroid gland) and nonthyroidal lymphoma ICD-10 codes. Results: The median 
follow-up was 3.3 years (interquartile range, 1.2-5.5 years). Disease-specific 
mortality was concentrated in the first two years postdiagnosis, particularly in 
the initial six months. Advanced age (≥80 years) and diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL) were associated with poorer overall survival (OS) and 
disease-specific survival (DSS). The current lymphoma staging systems do not 
significantly differentiate survival outcomes. Favorable outcomes were observed 
with localized treatments, including curative surgery alone, for stage IE PTL. 
Conclusions: Disease-specific mortality was highest in the first two years, 
particularly the first six months, highlighting this as a critical management 
period and the importance of timely treatment. Despite recent treatment advances 
that have improved the overall prognosis and reduced prognostic differences 
among disease stages, age at diagnosis and histological subtype remain key OS 
and DSS determinants, with older patients and DLBCL patients experiencing poorer 
outcomes. Notably, favorable outcomes were observed in selected Stage IE cases 
treated with surgery alone, suggesting that less-intensive treatment may be 
appropriate for certain PTL patients.

T cell bispecific antibodies (TCBs) are an emerging class of cancer therapy that 
are typically designed for high binding affinity to CD3 and tumor antigen (TA). 
Using this approach, TCBs have demonstrated significant clinical efficacy, but 
they have also elicited cytokine release syndrome and off-target on-tumor 
toxicities. CD3 affinity-attenuation has recently been reported as an approach 
to maintain efficacy while reducing cytokine release, but the interdependence of 
CD3 affinity with other factors is often not systematically explored. For this 
purpose, we generated a series of TCBs comprising CD3 binders with varying 
affinities and TA binders with either high or low affinities, utilizing FOLR1 
and CEACAM5 as tumor targets. The CD3 binders were classified into high, 
intermediate, low, and very low affine binders based on affinity measurements as 
well as functionality. Depending on the target, different combinations of 
binders showed the most advantageous profile of tumor-cell killing while coupled 
with lower cytokine secretion. For instance, within the FOLR1-TCBs series, 
CD3intermed exhibited a favorable profile compared to CD3high in vitro using 
cocultures and in vivo using humanized mice. For CEACAM5-TCBs, CD3low, along 
with CD3intermed, showed a favorable profile compared to CD3high in both in 
vitro and in vivo settings. Additionally, CD3low avoided on-target, off-tumor 
toxicity and reduced cytokine release in transgenic mice. Taken together, 
reducing cytokine release while maintaining adequate efficacy is possible 
through CD3 binder affinity attenuation, but optimizing cytokine release 
profiles by CD3 binder affinity-attenuation is dependent on additional 
parameters.

Inflammatory signaling, metabolic reprogramming, and stromal complexity have 
emerged as core hallmarks of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Crosstalk 
between these programs could represent potential targets to concurrently perturb 
multiple tumor-promoting processes. By integrating multi-omics data from 
clinical cohorts, patient-derived organoids, and autochthonous models, we 
uncovered tumor-intrinsic inflammatory cascades in PDAC as master regulators of 
mevalonate pathway hijacking, which drove both malignant progression and stromal 
co-evolution. TNFSF13B+ tumor-associated macrophages activated STAT3 signaling 
in neoplastic epithelia, leading to the transcriptional upregulation of USP20. 
This deubiquitinase stabilized HMGCR to potentiate mevalonate flux, resulting in 
cholesterol and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate overproduction. Stimulation of 
YAP/TAZ signaling induced by the USP20-mediated metabolic alterations promoted 
tumor cell proliferation and triggered the activation of cancer-associated 
fibroblasts (CAFs). Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of USP20 
using a selective inhibitor reversed tumor metabolic dysregulation, suppressing 
both tumor growth and stromal desmoplasia. Furthermore, the combination of USP20 
inhibition and anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy resulted in enhanced 
anti-tumor efficacy. These findings reveal the STAT3-USP20-HMGCR axis as a 
central coordinator of PDAC malignancy and position USP20 inhibition as a 
strategy to suppress oncogenic signaling, perturb metabolic reprogramming, and 
reverse microenvironmental remodeling.

Immune checkpoint blockade treatment is highly effective in microsatellite 
instable (MSI) colorectal cancer (CRC). However, microsatellite stable (MSS) 
tumors, are intrinsically resistant to immunotherapy. Here, we sought to better 
understand the mechanisms of resistance to anti-PD-L1 therapy in CRC by 
characterizing the immune profiles of MSS and MSI tumor models. While both tumor 
types presented intratumoral CD8+ T cell and PD-L1 expression, the exhausted 
CD8+ T cell phenotypes differed. In the MSS tumors, exhausted CD8+ T cells 
co-expressed PD-1 and TIGIT and exhibited a terminal exhausted profile with low 
cytokine secretion and limited cytotoxic function. In contrast, PD-1+ CD8+ T 
cells in MSI tumors did not express TIGIT and displayed higher cytokine and 
cytotoxic activities. Interestingly, immunosuppressive M2-like tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAM) accumulated in MSI tumors and positively correlated with PD-1+ 
TIGIT+ CD8+ T cell frequency. M2-like TAM depletion reduced TIGIT expression, 
increased CD8+ T cell function, and improved efficacy of PD-L1 blockade. 
Transcriptomic analysis revealed elevated COX1/2 expression in TAMs in MSS 
tumors compared to MSI tumors. COX2 and prostaglandin E2 receptor inhibition 
impeded TIGIT expression and restored CD8+ T cell activity, while PGE2 triggered 
TIGIT upregulation in CD8+ T cells. Single-cell, spatial, and bulk 
transcriptomic data from CRC patients substantiated the correlation between 
elevated TIGIT in CD8+ T cell and COX1/2 in TAMs. Together, these data uncover 
the role of the TAM axis in inhibiting PD-L1 efficacy in MSS CRC and support the 
utility of combining anti-PD-L1 therapy with TIGIT blockade, PGE2 treatment, or 
M2-like TAM inhibition in CRC.

Durotaxis is the directed migration of cells along tissue stiffness gradients, 
and is emerging as a fundamental mechanobiological process orchestrating 
progression in diseases such as fibrosis and cancer. Despite compelling in vitro 
evidence demonstrating durotactic behaviour across multiple cell types, 
translating these findings to in vivo contexts has remained challenging due to 
the inherent complexity of isolating biomechanical cues from the myriad 
biochemical and architectural features that collectively define tissue 
properties. In their recent Nature Cell Biology study, Al-Hilal and colleagues 
address this translational gap through innovative bioengineering approaches 
combined with genetic models. Using high-resolution atomic force microscopy and 
intravital two-photon imaging, the authors demonstrate that pathological 
stiffness gradients drive fibroblast recruitment and activation in 
bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, whilst simultaneously promoting 
quasi-mesenchymal pancreatic cancer cell dissemination. Critically, they 
identify the FAK-paxillin signalling axis as the mechanosensory machinery 
underpinning durotactic behaviour in both contexts. Pharmacological inhibition 
of this pathway using JP-153, or genetic disruption of tumour cell durotaxis, 
significantly attenuates fibrosis and metastatic burden without affecting 
primary tumour growth. These findings establish durotaxis as a therapeutically 
tractable mechanism in fibrotic and neoplastic disease, introducing a paradigm 
shift whereby targeting biomechanical sensing pathways may offer precise 
therapeutic intervention whilst preserving developmental and homeostatic 
processes dependent on functional mechanosensing.

The sigma-2 receptor (σ2R/TMEM97) is a clinically relevant membrane protein 
involved in cholesterol regulation and overexpressed in cancer and 
neurodegenerative diseases. Despite its therapeutic potential, the dynamic 
mechanisms underlying σ2R function and ligand binding remain poorly understood. 
Here, we combined adaptive sampling molecular dynamics simulations with 
quasi-anharmonic analysis and unsupervised machine learning method to 
investigate the conformational behavior of the σ2R homodimer in both apo and 
cholesterol-bound states. Our results reveal asymmetric dynamics between the two 
protomers. This asymmetry is driven by anticorrelated helical motions and 
mutually exclusive salt bridge formation, including a switching mechanism 
between K55-E139 and D122-R140. Cholesterol binding further enhances this 
asymmetry by stabilizing one protomer and altering the dynamics of the other. 
Species-specific allosteric interaction between D56-R133 may be essential for 
the human σ2R function. Additional lipid-protein interaction analysis highlights 
asymmetric membrane coupling in the bound state. These findings provide a 
plausible explanation for the receptor's dimeric nature, suggesting that ligand 
binding at one site may allosterically influence the apo protomer, thereby 
modulating receptor function. Our work provides new mechanistic insight into σ2R 
function and highlights the importance of asymmetric dynamics.

Cutaneous melanoma, responsible for 80% of skin cancer mortality, presents 
urgent diagnostic challenges due to insufficient early detection methods. 
Current clinical methods rely on invasive biopsies, while noninvasive approaches 
primarily serve as adjunctive decision-support tools rather than definitive 
diagnostics. Here, a peptide-based fluorescent biosensing system was developed 
for the sensitive and rapid detection of S100B, a key prognostic biomarker for 
melanoma. Our system employs a fluorescently labeled peptide beacon designed for 
Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based detection, achieving a 
subnanomolar detection limit (∼0.045 nM) and great selectivity in human serum 
samples. Peptide synthesis was performed using optimized solid-phase protocols, 
enabling precise sequence assembly, while the peptide sensor offers efficient 
detection, lower costs, and high specificity through tailored peptide-protein 
interactions. The biosensing probe employs complementary peptide nucleic acid 
(PNA) interactions to achieve proximity-induced fluorescence quenching in the 
absence of S100B, which reverses via structural rearrangement upon specific 
S100B binding for accurate quantification. Computational and experimental 
optimization of the synthetic process has enhanced binding efficiency, 
sensitivity, and response time-crucial parameters for melanoma-specific 
detection. By integrating advanced molecular design with optical biosensing, 
this mechanism aims to enhance the accuracy and accessibility of melanoma 
diagnostics, ultimately addressing healthcare disparities and improving patient 
outcomes.

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs) of the pancreas are rare tumors arising 
from pancreatic tissue, predominantly affecting young women and possessing low 
malignant potential. Extrapancreatic SPNs are exceedingly uncommon. According to 
data from the English literature, only 30 cases of extrapancreatic SPNs had been 
reported by 1990, accounting for less than 1% of all reported SPNs from 2004 to 
2018. The testis, paratesticular region, and ovary are the more frequently 
documented sites of these tumors [1,2]. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, 
no cases of SPN originating in the diaphragm have been reported in the English 
literature to date. The prevailing theory suggests that SPNs behave similarly 
regardless of whether they originate in the pancreas or in extrapancreatic 
locations. We present the case of a 79-year-old female with a history of lung 
and endometrial cancer, who was diagnosed with a liver lesion during a routine 
follow-up 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computed 
tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT). During surgery, the lesion was resected from the 
diaphragm and was confirmed to be consistent with the pathological findings of 
SPN.

BACKGROUND: There is a rising incidence of bladder cancer (BC) in Israel and 
worldwide. BC is currently the fourth most common cancer in Israeli males. There 
are large variations in the incidence of BC observed in different populations, 
both in Israel and worldwide.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize the time trends and epidemiologic profile of BC in 
Israel regarding various population demographics.
METHODS: All cases of BC reported to the Israeli National Cancer Registry 
between 1996 and 2016 were included. We calculated age standardized rates for 
BC. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to study trends in incidence as 
expressed by annual percent change (APC) in incidence.
RESULTS: Between 1996 and 2016, 28,953 cases of BC were diagnosed in Israel. BC 
rates in Jewish males peaked in 2006 and subsequently declined (APC = -1.69, P < 
0.05). Between 1996 and 2011, in-situ BC rates increased for both Jewish (APC = 
28.2, P < 0.05) and Arab males (APC = 16.76, P < 0.05). Invasive BC incidence in 
Jewish males declined from 2005 to 2016 (APC = -7.6, P< 0.05) as well as in Arab 
males from 2006 to 2011 (APC = -12.0, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In the past two decades, in situ BC rates have risen, while 
invasive BC rates have decreased. BC epidemiology mirrors lung cancer trends, 
which is expected as smoking is a significant risk factor for both. These trends 
are important to identify as they can affect clinical guidelines regarding 
screening in high-risk populations and health care planning.

Molecular imaging offers a powerful approach for in situ detection of programmed 
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), however, achieving cancer cell-selective imaging that 
discriminates PD-L1 expression on malignant versus normal cells remains a 
challenge. Here, we present an orthogonal nucleic acid/peptide amplification 
circuit that integrates protease-activated hybridization chain reaction (HCR) 
with aptamer-mediated target recognition for cancer-selective PD-L1 imaging. In 
the design, PD-L1 aptamer is coupled with an HCR initiator for targeting PD-L1, 
while PNA is employed as a bridge scaffold to engineer the initiator with 
protease-responsive peptide substrate and thus block the HCR. Within the tumor 
microenvironment, protease-mediated peptide cleavage liberates the initiator, 
thereby triggering localized HCR amplification at PD-L1 sites. In contrast, in 
normal tissues lacking the relevant proteases, the initiator remains inactive, 
yielding markedly improved spatial selectivity for cancer cell-specific PD-L1 
imaging. Using mouse models, we further demonstrate that this strategy allows 
for non-invasive assessment of tumor responses to immune checkpoint blockade 
therapy. This methodology will build a bridge between DNA nanobiotechnology and 
peptide-based biochemistry for diverse biomedical applications.

BACKGROUND: Mogamulizumab is an anti-CCR4 therapeutic antibody approved for 
relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides, Sézary syndrome and adult T-cell 
leukaemia/lymphoma. During treatment, a subset of patients develops a 
mogamulizumab-associated drug rash (MAR) that is associated with a better 
overall survival, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In addition, 
misinterpretation of MAR as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) progression can 
lead to unnecessary drug discontinuation.
OBJECTIVES: To conduct a comprehensive molecular characterization of MAR.
METHODS: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of skin biopsies from 4 
patients with MAR, compared to untreated erythrodermic CTCL (CTCL, n = 6) and 
healthy control (HC, n = 4) skin.
RESULTS: CCR4 was primarily expressed in proliferating and non-proliferating 
malignant T-cell clones and FOXP3+ regulatory T cells in untreated CTCL, which 
were significantly decreased in MAR. The few residual malignant clones in MAR 
showed retained CCR4 expression, but decreases in the central memory markers 
SELL and CCR7, with upregulation of the MMP2 inhibitor TIMP2 and the tumour 
suppressor gene RUNX3, consistent with a more silenced immune phenotype. In 
parallel, polyclonal T cells in MAR lesions exhibited decreases in the 
exhaustion markers TIGIT and TOX, paralleled by upregulation of markers 
associated with cytotoxicity (GZMA) and anti-cancer properties (ZNF683). This 
increase in tumour suppressor and cytotoxicity genes potentially reflects an 
anti-lymphoma immune response within the MAR skin microenvironment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides novel insights into the molecular properties of 
residual malignant clones within MAR that appear silenced, surrounded by a 
putatively anti-tumor immune response.

Plain Language Summary: Mogamulizumab is a drug used to treat cancers such as 
cutaneous T‐cell lymphomas and adult T‐cell leukaemia/lymphoma. A common adverse 
event is a mogamulizumab‐associated drug rash, which is associated with a better 
overall survival in these cancer patients. Our study provides an in‐depth 
characterisation of this rash at the single‐cell level. We found steep decreases 
in tumor cell numbers in the drug rash that harbored highly activated bystander 
cells with characteristics of anti‐tumour responses, which might be the reason 
for the better overall prognosis in these patients.

Ensartinib (EST) is a new oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor authorized for the 
initial treatment of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC). EST demonstrates efficacy against Met Proto-Oncogene (MET), 
Virus Oncogene Homolog 1 (ROS1), Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (AXL), Abelson Murine 
Leukemia (ABL), and v-Ros UR2 Sarcoma, and it is considered safer than existing 
ALK inhibitors. The current research involved the development of a rapid, green, 
and sensitive UPLC-MS/MS approach for detecting EST in human liver microsomes 
(HLMs). The approach was applied to determine the in vitro metabolic stability 
of EST. The UPLC-MS/MS method validation agreed with the US-FDA standards for 
bioanalytical approach validation. The StarDrop software package, which 
comprises the DEREK toxicity and WhichP450 modules, was used to identify 
potential toxicity alerts associated with the EST chemical structure and to 
estimate its in silico metabolic lability. EST and Encorafenib (ECB as the 
internal standard) were differentiated using an isocratic mobile phase system on 
a reversed stationary phase (Eclipse Plus C18) column. The EST calibration curve 
demonstrated linearity across the level range of 1 to 3000 ng mL-1. This 
research determined the accuracy and precision of the UPLC-MS/MS procedure for 
intra- and inter-day valuations, spanning -5.22% to 9.67% and -5.22% to 10.67%, 
respectively. The in vitro half-life (t1/2) was ascertained to be 19.29 min, 
while the intrinsic clearance (Clint) of EST was determined to be 42.03 mL min-1 
kg-1. In silico data proposed that minor structural modifications to the 
dichlorophenyl moiety or the piperazine ring during drug design may enhance the 
safety profile and metabolic stability relative to the properties of EST. 
Evaluating the EST metabolic stability and in silico ADME characteristics is 
essential for advancing innovative therapeutic research focused on improving 
metabolic stability.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This study examined the associations of fat mass index 
(FMI) and fat free mass index (FFMI) with metabolic syndrome (MetS), cachexia, 
and all-cause mortality in cancer patients, given the limited existing evidence 
on these relationships.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This analysis included 3,247 subjects enrolled in a 
cohort study. Cox regression analyses calculated hazard ratios (HRs) with 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Logistic models generated odds 
ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Mediation effects of FMI and FFMI on the 
cachexia-mortality association were evaluated.
RESULTS: FMI and FFMI were significantly associated with MetS and cachexia, 
respectively. FMI (HR [95% CI] = 0.96 (0.94, 0.99), p = 0.003), FFMI (HR [95% 
CI] = 0.94 (0.91, 0.97), p < 0.001) were significantly associated with 
mortality. FMI (proportion mediated%=10.21, p = 0.03) and FFMI (proportion 
mediated%=13.16, p = 0.016) mediate the correlation between cachexia and 
mortality. Subgroup analysis showed that FMI had a significant mediating effect 
in gastrointestinal cancer, while FFMI had a significant mediating effect in 
lung cancer.
CONCLUSION: FMI and FFMI were positively correlated with MetS, negatively 
correlated with cachexia and mortality. FMI and FFMI mediate the association 
between cachexia and mortality, with FFMI having a higher mediating effect than 
FMI, however, the mediating effect was differentiated by tumor types.

BACKGROUND: Skin cancer prevention remains a critical public health challenge, 
particularly in fair-skinned populations in Europe, the United States and 
Australia, where incidence rates of keratinocyte skin cancer and melanoma 
continue to rise despite decades of public education on ultraviolet-radiation 
(UVR) protection. Although progress has been observed in Oceania, the overall 
effectiveness of current prevention strategies remains insufficient. This paper 
aims to refine and disseminate more effective UVR protection messages by 
developing an evidence-based, internationally adaptable public education 
leaflet.
METHODS: The development of this educational material followed the current 
guidelines for the development of health promotion materials and effective 
public education. Based on the scientific evidence, a plain-language message has 
been drafted. It was subsequently revised through multiple rounds of 
multi-stakeholder feedback from dermato-oncology, epidemiology, public health 
experts, patient organizations representatives and NGOs involved in prevention 
and health promotion.
RESULTS: The final educational leaflet emphasizes three core messages: avoiding 
intentional sun exposure and tanning, utilizing shade and protective clothing as 
primary UV protection strategies and using sunscreen as a supplementary 
protective measure. Additional recommendations address childhood sun protection, 
the dangers of tanning beds and the importance of monitoring skin for early 
signs of cancer. Common concerns such as vitamin D synthesis and sunscreen 
safety are also addressed with evidence-based responses.
DISCUSSION: This initiative highlights the necessity of shifting public 
attitudes towards UVR exposure and developing tailored, culturally sensitive 
communication strategies. The freely available leaflet will be distributed 
through professional associations and online platforms. Future efforts should 
involve policymakers in implementing structural changes, such as enhancing 
public shade availability and regulating tanning facilities, to promote 
long-term behavioural shifts in UV protection.

Cancer continues to pose a significant global health burden, prompting ongoing 
exploration of innovative therapeutic strategies. Ruthenium-based complexes have 
emerged as promising alternatives to platinum drugs due to their generally 
favorable pharmacological profiles. In this work, we report the synthesis and 
characterization of a novel series of fluorescent Ru(II)-cyclopentadienyl 
organometallic complexes of general formula 
[Ru(η5-C5H5)(NN)(Ph2P-CH2-pip-NBD)][PF6] (1-5), where NN represents a bipyridine 
or phenanthroline-based ligand and Ph2P-CH2-pip-NBD is a 
4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD)-derived fluorescent phosphane conjugate. 
Structural characterization confirmed their piano-stool geometry via NMR, FTIR, 
UV-Vis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography (for 1, 3 and 5). 
The complexes exhibit notable stability in both organic and aqueous media. 
Cytotoxicity screening across three cancer cell lines (4T1 murine epithelial 
breast cancer, CT26 murine colon carcinoma, U2OS human osteosarcoma) and one 
non-cancerous line (3T3 murine embryonic fibroblasts) revealed that complexes 1, 
3, and 5 display potent anticancer activity, particularly against U2OS. 
Fluorescence-based uptake and confocal microscopy demonstrated efficient 
internalization, primarily through caveolin-mediated endocytosis, and 
preferential accumulation in lysosomes. Enhanced fluorescence in acidic 
environments and co-localization with lysosomal markers confirm lysosomal 
tropism, highlighting the dual role of the NBD fluorophore for traceability and 
subcellular targeting. Additional mechanistic studies revealed that complexes 1, 
3, and 5 induce oxidative stress and trigger apoptosis, suggesting that ROS 
generation contributes to their cytotoxic activity. These findings establish 
this class of compounds as promising lysosome-targeting agents.

Infectious Carcinogens Derived from Intestinal Microflora: Mechanisms of 
Microbial Transitions from Eubionts to Pathobionts.

A diverse community of microorganisms inhabits the gastrointestinal tract in a 
physiological state. While a symbiotic relationship exists between commensal 
bacteria and the healthy host, an imbalanced microbial population (dysbiosis) is 
associated with the development of colitis-associated colorectal cancers. The 
decline of beneficial microbes (eubionts) and the expansion of commensal-derived 
opportunistic pathogens (pathobionts) are widely recognized as key factors in 
the microbial etiology of various diseases. In particular, certain bacteria with 
emerging virulence elements are present in the gut microbiome and have been 
implicated as contributors to the development of colon cancer, such as 
Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Bacterial 
virulent factors, including lipopolysaccharide, fimbriae and adhesins, and 
toxins, promote oncogenesis through direct or indirect mechanisms. These 
microbial products modify host cellular functions, resulting in DNA damage, 
increased epithelial proliferation, and intensified inflammation, all of which 
ultimately contribute to tumor formation. Although the existence of pathobionts 
is generally accepted nowadays, an open question remains regarding why bacteria 
shift from harmless commensals to disease-causing pathobionts. Accumulating 
evidence suggests that host epithelial functions influence the composition of 
the intestinal microbiota by regulating oxygen availability in the lumen, 
providing antimicrobial defense, activating innate immune responses, 
synthesizing mucin glycoproteins, and establishing a physical barrier through 
the organization of microvilli. This review examines the various aspects of 
mucosal drivers that shape microbiota and provides evidence that intraepithelial 
stress plays a significant role in configuring colitogenic and tumorigenic 
microflora. Understanding the mechanisms by which microbes transition from 
eubionts to pathobionts that promote cancer progression is crucial for 
developing bacterial precision medicine. Identifying the roles of intestinal 
pathobionts and the critical time point for host-microbe interactions in 
tumorigenesis could lead to the development of new strategies for prevention and 
therapy.

Metal ion dyshomeostasis represents a therapeutic vulnerability in cancer, yet 
simultaneous targeting of multiple metal-dependent death pathways remains 
challenging. Herein, a pH-responsive copper-based metal-organic framework 
nanoplatform (Cu-MOF@DPCPX) is engineered to co-trigger cuproptosis, 
ferroptosis, and mitophagy through tumor-specific copper overload. The system 
leverages acidic tumor microenvironments for targeted degradation, releasing 
Cu2⁺. The liberated Cu2⁺ depletes overexpressed glutathione (GSH) to disrupt 
redox homeostasis and generates toxic Cu⁺ that initiates dual catalytic cycles. 
1) Cu⁺ accumulation promotes lipoylated protein aggregation and Fe-S cluster 
loss, driving cuproptosis; 2) Cu⁺-mediated Fenton-like reactions convert 
endogenous H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and downregulate GPX4 to induce 
ferroptosis. Crucially, mitochondrial damage from these pathways activates 
mitophagy, which releases sequestered copper to establish a self-amplifying 
death cascade. In vivo, Cu-MOF@DPCPX demonstrates potent tumor suppression 
across multiple tumor models (4T1-breast, LLC-lung, PAN02-pancreatic, 
GL261-glioblastoma), while reprogramming immunosuppressive microenvironments via 
increased CD8⁺ T-cell infiltration and M1 macrophage polarization. This 
triple-pathway activation strategy overcomes monotherapy limitations and 
establishes a paradigm for metal-ion-based multimodal oncotherapy.

Chronic tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of 18 cancer types, heart 
and pulmonary disease, and premature death in the United States. The average 
cigarette contains approximately 10-15 milligrams of nicotine, a highly 
addictive chemical and the primary driver of chronic tobacco use. High-quality 
clinical trials have repeatedly shown that reducing nicotine content in 
cigarettes by approximately 95 percent lowers exposure to toxicants and 
carcinogens by decreasing the number of cigarettes smoked and increasing quit 
attempts and cessation. It is estimated that limiting nicotine in combustible 
cigarettes to such minimally addictive levels would result in nearly 13 million 
additional Americans quitting smoking within one year, powerfully benefiting 
public health. Therefore, we urge the United States Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) to move forward in finalizing the recently proposed nicotine product 
standard limiting nicotine concentration to 0.7 mg/g within combustible 
cigarettes and other selected combustible tobacco products. Specific populations 
may benefit disproportionally from a limit on nicotine levels, and it is 
important to consider such impacts. Therefore, it is vital that FDA and other 
federal and local health agencies engage with broad stakeholders to ensure that 
all Americans benefit equally. Additionally, increased support for 
evidence-based smoking cessation therapies and education surrounding the 
continuum of risk of nicotine products will be essential for supporting 
individuals who want to quit and maximizing the public health benefits of the 
nicotine product standard. If implemented, this policy would constitute one of 
the most impactful cancer prevention, anti-addiction, and anti-chronic disease 
policies in American history.

BACKGROUND: The implementation of integrative medicine in an oncology setting 
(Integrative Oncology, IO) is increasingly taking place in cancer centers across 
Israel and worldwide, often together with palliative care.
OBJECTIVES: To learn about a collaborative treatment setting involving a team of 
gyneco-oncology, supportive and palliative care and IO healthcare professionals 
and practitioners.
METHODS: This narrative-based study analyzed the treatment of a patient with 
advanced ovarian cancer from the perspectives of healthcare professionals and 
practitioners from the three disciplines.
RESULTS: The patient, a young woman from Israel with a diagnosis of ovarian 
cancer, had always had a strong affinity toward alternative medicine practices. 
The medical team at the study center accompanied her from the initial diagnosis 
until her passing. The narratives presented include those from the IO team of 
practitioners working in the gyneco-oncology department, her gyneco-oncologist 
and the palliative care nurse. These perspectives addressed the goals of the IO 
program, and the quality of the interaction in meeting therapeutic challenges, 
including during end-of-life care.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical collaboration between oncology surgeons, palliative care 
professionals and IO practitioners may facilitate communication with patients 
whose health-belief model challenges that of medical and nursing staff. This 
interaction may create a synergistic process, sharing treatment goals with the 
patient.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid nodules are common, and the majority are of benign nature, 
however the main clinical aim remains to discriminate malignant ones. Despite 
that, the actual routine workup for thyroid nodules including hormonal testing, 
ultrasound scan, scintigraphy, and Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is 
still deficient, often necessitating surgical intervention for a conclusive 
histopathological examination and diagnosis. Therefore, searching for molecular 
tools that help in differentiating benign and malignant thyroid nodules gains an 
increasing interest.
METHODOLOGY: This case-control study was conducted on 46 adults, categorized 
into two groups (23 patients each) one with benign and another with malignant 
thyroid nodules, based on post- operative histopathology. Prior to surgery 
patients have undergone clinical examination and ultrasonography (US) neck and 
only patients with US - TIRADs 3, 4 and 5 thyroid lesions were referred for FNAC 
and included in this study. Surgery decisions were made according to FNAC 
Bethesda classification. Total RNA was extracted from plasma samples prior to 
surgery. The reverse transcription of miRNA to cDNA was followed by Real Time 
PCR Amplification in triplet to analyze miRNA-222, miRNA-146b and reference 
miRNA-16. Plasma from 40 healthy subjects was used as control for the 
calculations of the relative expression of miRNA using RT-qPCR.
RESULTS: The results showed a statistically significant increased expression of 
plasma miRNA-222 and miRNA-146b in the malignant nodules group than benign group 
(p = 0.001 and p= <0.001, respectively). Also, there is a statistically 
significant difference between benign and malignant groups regarding the 
presence of plasma miRNA-222 or plasma miRNA-146b with higher levels than Youden 
Index cutoffs (p= <0.001). MiRNA-222 showed increased plasma expression with 
vascular invasion of malignant nodules. Adding the estimation of plasma 
miRNA-222 and 146b levels to the actual ultrasound features and to FNAC Bethesda 
classification, raised AUC of ROC of the mentioned tools for the diagnosis of 
malignant thyroid nodules.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a potential role for miRNA-222 and miRNA-146b 
in differentiating benign and malignant thyroid nodules and may provide a 
valuable diagnostic addition to the current routine workup.

First-line chemo-immunotherapy has significantly improved survival in 
extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). However, rapid disease 
progression still occurs, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of only 
4.5-5.8 months from induction therapy. We initiated two single-arm, phase II 
studies to assess the first-line maintenance therapy with tislelizumab plus 
anti-angiogenic drugs following induction therapy in ES-SCLC patients. 
Previously untreated ES-SCLC patients were enrolled to receive tislelizumab plus 
platinum-based chemotherapy as induction therapy for 4 cycles, followed by 
tislelizumab plus sitravatinib (Trial 1) or anlotinib (Trial 2) as maintenance 
therapy in a 21-day cycle. The primary endpoint was the 1-year PFS rate in the 
maintenance analysis set (MAS, including patients receiving ≥1 dose of 
maintenance therapy). Outcomes in MAS were calculated from the start of 
maintenance therapy. Twenty-one patients were enrolled, and 18 patients entered 
the maintenance phase in each trial. From the start of the maintenance therapy, 
the median PFS was 6.4 and 7.8 months (1-year PFS rates of 22.2% and not 
reached), respectively; the median overall survival (OS) was 18.3 months and not 
reached. From induction therapy, the corresponding median PFS was 9.1 and 
10.8 months, with a median OS of 17.6 months and not reached. In MAS, the most 
common grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) included hypertension 
(22.2%) in Trial 1 and fatigue (5.6%) in Trial 2. No patients died from TRAEs in 
either trial. Maintenance therapy with tislelizumab plus sitravatinib or 
anlotinib yielded clinically meaningful survival results and was generally well 
tolerated in ES-SCLC, warranting further exploration in larger-scale trials.

This study utilized an untargeted metabolomic approach using LC-MS/MS to analyze 
the metabolic alterations in extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by breast 
cancer cells under hypoxic conditions. EVs were isolated using an established 
ultracentrifugation protocol, and their homogeneity was assessed through TEM, 
SEM, NTA, and immunoblotting. Metabolic extracts from hypoxic EVs were found to 
enhance breast cancer cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT), underscoring their role in tumor progression. Metabolomic 
analysis identified over 400 annotated metabolites, with univariate statistical 
analysis (p < 0.05, Log2FC > 0.58/< -0.58) revealing 48 significantly altered 
metabolites in MDA-MB-231- and MCF-7-derived EVs, respectively, indicating 
substantial metabolic reprogramming under hypoxia. Integrated univariate and 
multivariate analyses (p < 0.05, Log2FC > 0.58/< -0.58, VIP > 1) identified key 
upregulated metabolites, including riboflavin, 5,6-epoxy-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic 
acid, and furandicarboxylic acid, in hypoxic EVs from both cell lines. 
Additionally, N-acetyl-l-methionine, 
2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-N-methylformamidopyrimidine, and 
5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolic acid were identified as critical metabolites 
potentially influencing cell proliferation, DNA damage, and epigenetic 
regulation. Metabolic pathway analysis highlighted heightened activity in 
aromatic amino acid and riboflavin metabolism. These findings reveal significant 
metabolic alterations in hypoxic EVs, providing insights into their potential 
role in driving tumor progression.

Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in Uganda. In 2015, a national human 
papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program was initiated, targeting girls aged 
10 years. To provide a pre-vaccination baseline to monitor HPV vaccine 
effectiveness, first-void urine (FVU) samples were collected from females aged 
16-21 years in the General Population Cohort (GPC) in South-East Uganda, between 
2019 and 2023. HPV vaccination status was obtained from questionnaires and 
vaccination cards. FVU samples were tested for 28 HPV types using Allplex HPV28. 
Among 1009 participants, 28 type prevalence was 33%, and was higher among 
females reporting sexual intercourse (aPR = 3.7, 95%CI 2.8-4.8) and HIV 
infection (PR = 1.4, 95%CI 1.1-1.8). HPV16/18 prevalence was 4.8% overall, and 
lower in 146 vaccinated (1.4%) than 783 unvaccinated (5.6%) females (aPR = 0.4, 
95%CI 0.1-1.4). No decrease was observed in other high-risk (aPR = 1.5, 95%CIs 
1.0-2.2) or low-risk (aPR = 1.4, 95%CIs 1.0-2.1) types which were more prevalent 
in vaccinated females. Among vaccinated 16-21 year-olds, 30.8% (n = 45) received 
one, 44.5% (n = 65) two, and 14.3% (n = 21) three doses. Vaccination status was 
also obtained from 1121 younger girls aged 10-15 years from the same GPC 
population, among whom 42.8% (n = 480) were vaccinated, 47.1% (n = 226) with 
one, 44.2% (n = 212) two, and 6.7% (n = 32) three doses. In conclusion, we 
report high HPV prevalence in young women in Uganda and see first impacts of 
vaccination on HPV16/18 infection. This population, shown to have suboptimal HPV 
vaccine coverage and heterogeneity in doses received, can serve as a robust 
baseline for future evaluations of HPV vaccine effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: Current anticancer treatments can result in cancer therapy-related 
cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD). While glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
(GLP-1 RAs) have demonstrated cardioprotective properties, their role in CTRCD 
has not been previously explored.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized the TriNetX research network. 
Adults aged ≥18 years who had a cancer history and who underwent antineoplastic 
therapy and developed CTRCD between January 1, 2012 and January 1, 2023 were 
included. Among patients on guideline-directed medical therapy for heart 
failure, 2 groups were identified: GLP-1 RA users and nonusers. Propensity score 
matching (1:1) was conducted based on demographics, comorbid conditions, and 
concurrent medications, yielding a matched sample of 837 patients. Outcomes were 
assessed over a 1-year follow-up period.
RESULTS: The study cohort found 4982 patients with CTRCD; 837 received GLP-1 RA 
therapy (mean age: 69.0 years; 43.8% female; 70.4% White). Compared with 
nonusers, those treated with GLP-1 RAs alongside guideline-directed medical 
therapy had significantly lower rates of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.57 
[95% CI, 0.43-0.77]; P<0.001), acute heart failure exacerbations (hazard ratio, 
0.69 [95% CI, 0.56-0.85]; P<0.001), and all-cause hospitalizations (hazard 
ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.72-0.96]; P=0.009). While reductions in atrial 
fibrillation/flutter and ventricular tachycardia were observed, they were not 
statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Among patients with CTRCD receiving guideline-directed medical 
therapy, GLP-1 RA use may be linked to better 1-year survival and improved heart 
failure-related outcomes.

Patients with skin of color (SOC) face unique dermatologic challenges that are 
often underrepresented in research and in dermatological education, creating 
critical gaps in care. We aimed to identify and explore key gaps in research and 
clinical management for SOC across four domains: skin diseases, hair disorders, 
photoprotection, and aesthetic procedures. An international panel reviewed 
articles retrieved from PubMed using the search terms ""skin of color"" or ""skin 
of colour"" in titles and abstracts from September 2019 to September 2024. 
Inflammatory skin diseases, including acne, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and 
rosacea, are common in SOC subjects, necessitating tailored diagnostic and 
therapeutic approaches due to unique clinical presentations and specific 
challenges such as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and erythema detection. 
Pigmentary disorders such as melasma and acne-induced hyperpigmentation 
significantly impact quality of life in SOC, requiring cautious treatment to 
avoid exacerbation, while the unregulated use of skin bleaching agents 
containing high-potency corticosteroids can pose serious health risks. Skin 
cancer in SOC often presents at advanced stages with poorer outcomes due to 
lower awareness and unique clinical manifestations, resulting in delayed 
diagnosis. Hair disorders in SOC populations require tailored diagnostic and 
therapeutic approaches due to unique hair properties. Gaps in photoprotection 
education on SOC exacerbate pigmentary disorders and other dermatologic 
conditions, with limited research on effective sunscreens for this population. 
In aesthetic dermatology, misconceptions and knowledge gaps regarding the 
prevention of complications hinder access to safe and effective procedures for 
SOC subjects, compounded by inadequate diversity in clinical trials. Inclusive 
research, improved diagnostic accuracy, and customized procedures are needed to 
ensure equitable dermatologic care.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a photochemistry-based treatment modality that 
synergizes with traditional agents and can overcome chemoresistance. Eighty 
percent of ovarian cancer patients develop chemoresistant disease, highlighting 
the need to identify sources of treatment failure and develop rational 
combinations. Studies have shown that perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) induce 
chemoresistance in a duration-dependent manner in OVCAR-3 cells. PFAS are 
widespread drinking water contaminants present in the blood of nearly all 
Americans. The present study evaluated the ability of photodynamic priming 
(PDP), a sub-cytotoxic variant of PDT, in combination with chemotherapy to 
overcome chemoresistance in two OVCAR-3 cell cohorts: PFAS chronically-exposed 
and outgrown (allowed to ""recover"" from chronic PFAS exposure). Effectiveness of 
benzoporphyrin derivative- (BPD-) or aminolevulinic acid-induced protoporphyrin 
IX-PDP (ALA-PpIX-PDP) was assessed in combination with carboplatin and 
doxorubicin. In PFAS chronically-exposed cells, BPD-PDP + carboplatin reduced 
survival fraction compared to carboplatin alone. Mitochondrial membrane 
potential also decreased significantly in both cohorts following 
ALA-PpIX-PDP-based combinations. PDP + doxorubicin also successfully overcame 
chemoresistance arising from chronic PFAS exposure but was less effective than 
PDP + carboplatin. Together, these findings demonstrate the efficacy of 
PDP-based combinations in overcoming chronic PFAS exposure-induced 
chemoresistance and should be explored in pre-clinical models of ovarian cancer.

In this study, we present our previously fabricated star-shaped 
magnetic-plasmonic Au@Fe3O4 nanostars as promising agents for photothermal 
therapy. The nanostars exhibit a photothermal conversion efficiency of ~60% at a 
concentration of 25 μg/mL under 808 nm laser irradiation. WST-1 analysis 
revealed that Au@Fe3O4 nanostars moderately reduced the viability of human 
hepatocarcinoma Huh7 cells after 24 h exposure at concentrations of 1, 5, and 
10 μg/mL, accompanied by notable morphological alterations. Flow cytometry 
demonstrated that treatment with 5 μg/mL nanostars followed by 20 min of laser 
irradiation resulted in 79% elimination of cancer cells. Furthermore, 
photothermal therapy increased cellular granularity, with highly granulated 
cells comprising 23% of the population compared to 4% in untreated controls. The 
viability of these highly granulated cells decreased to 17% post-treatment. 
Interestingly, photothermal therapy reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells 
among Huh7 subpopulations relative to the overall number of dead cells.

Metastasis, like carcinogenesis, involves the disruption of homeostasis such 
that cancer cells travel from the primary tumor to distant parts of the body. 
Almost all cancer deaths are due to metastatic spread. The prevailing theory of 
metastasis is an incomplete doctrine and far from sufficient as only 0.2% of 
free cancer cells result in the spread of cancer. To develop reasonable and 
effective cancer therapies and to prevent (or reverse) carcinogenesis and 
metastasis, a comprehensive understanding of how both carcinogenesis and 
metastasis arise is necessary. Fundamental questions in cancer biology have been 
asked and answered over decades of research: How do most cancers develop 
(Epistemology of the Origin of Cancer I, 2014-2022)? Which is the first cancer 
cell (II, 2023)? The third basic question in cancer biology remaining to be 
addressed is: What are the fundamentals of how metastasis develops? The 
pre-cancerous niche (PCN) that forms during carcinogenesis is altered by ongoing 
complex signaling into a premetastatic niche 1 (PMN-1): p130(cas)/crk/DOCK180 
formation is necessary for lamellipodia formation, thereby enabling cell 
mobility. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) begin to release fibronectin 
CXCL12 and Keratin 19. PMN-1 is transformed into PMN-2 during ongoing crosstalk 
and transformation of anti- into pro-tumorigenic platelets, macrophages, and 
neutrophils. Finally, persistent signaling and immune evasion result in the 
conversion of PMN-2 to PMN-3 with heterogeneous cancer satellites - the term 
""satellite"" is used herein in accordance with its original meaning (a cell or 
particle escorting another). PMN-3 serves as a prerequisite for intravasation, 
traveling, and dissemination of cancer cells away from the primary tumor. Eight 
heterogeneous cancer satellites, including Trojan horses (immune evasion), 
travel alone or in combination: (1) cancer cells and (2) CAFs migrate along the 
CXCL12 and fibronectin gradient; (3) cancer cells surrounded by CAFs are 
shielded from the immune system and travel away from the primary cancer; (4) 
CXCL12 and Keratin 19 coat cancer cells; (5) platelets surround cancer cells and 
(6) CAFs, thereby facilitating cancer spread; and (7) neutrophil extracellular 
traps shield cancer cells and (8) CAFs. Metastasis in epithelial cancer occurs 
in parallel with carcinogenesis after the pre-cancerous niche is transformed 
into pre-metastatic niches (PMNs), which are indispensable to the origin of 
metastasis. Eight heterogeneous cancer satellites, including Trojan horses 
responsible for immune evasion, alongside reciprocally affecting sequences, 
wander alone or in conjunction with other cancer cells. This elucidates why the 
current practice of multimodal anti-cancer cell therapy should now be seen in a 
new light in which the benefits depend not on direct cancer cell effects, but on 
indirect cytopenic effects, which have previously been regarded merely as 
adverse effects.

Overexpressed transferrin receptor (TfR) on cancer cell membranes mediates the 
endocytosis of iron-loaded transferrin, which is subsequently recycled to the 
plasma membrane through endosomal pathways to meet the elevated iron demand. 
Here, an extracellularly activated ""AND"" logic-gated DNA nanodevice is 
presented, that hijacks and reprograms TfR trafficking to disrupt iron 
metabolism of cancer cells and enable molecular transport. This nanoplatform 
undergoes dynamic assembly in response to mildly acidic pH and specific 
extracellular molecular cues in the cancer microenvironment. Guided by aptamer 
recognition, it captures TfRs and redirects them toward lysosomal degradation 
via tetrahedral framework nucleic acid (tFNA)-mediated targeting, rather than 
membrane recycling, thereby impairing iron homeostasis and suppressing cancer 
cell migration. Meanwhile, the incorporated photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) is 
efficiently transported into cells, where it induces cytoplasmic perturbations 
and triggers self-destruction, achieving dual inhibition of cancer cell growth 
and motility. This nanodevice demonstrates intelligent cell-level recognition 
and holds broad potential for extracellular molecular computation and precision 
nanomedicine.

INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, 
and reliable prognostic biomarkers are needed. The prognostic significance of 
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in lung cancer is aim of the current 
systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, 
and Embase, and eligible studies included patients with lung cancer reporting 
survival/progression outcomes by MDSCs level. Study quality was assessed using 
the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 
(CMA) software version 3 was used to estimate pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 
95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Twenty-five studies (1,679 patients) were included. Elevated baseline 
monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) were significantly associated with worse overall 
survival (OS) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (HR = 1.89, 95% CI: 
1.39-2.59) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (HR = 2.72, 95% CI: 1.62-4.59), and 
with shorter progression/recurrence-free survival in NSCLC (HR = 1.86, 95% CI: 
1.44-2.40). Associations for polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) were weaker and 
inconsistent, showing significance only in HR for OS based on univariable data 
(HR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.32-2.35).
CONCLUSIONS: High M-MDSCs predict adverse outcomes in lung cancer, supporting 
their role as prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize the sixth most common finding in our 
neuroimmunological laboratory practice (tissue assay-observed unclassified 
neural antibodies [UNAs]), combining protein microarray and phage 
immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-Seq).
METHODS: Patient specimens (258; 133 serums; 125 CSF) meeting UNA criteria were 
profiled; October 2022-September 2023. Top-ranking candidate antigens were 
validated in silico, by dual-staining confocal microscopy, and ≥ 1 
protein-specific assay. Clinical data were reviewed.
RESULTS: Among 21 patients, 11 autoantibodies were characterized (serum, 19; 
CSF, all 9 available). Autoantigens were CACNA1I, 1; CAMK2B, 2; CLIP2, 1; FMN2, 
2; MAP1A, 2; MAP2, 5; NECAB1, 1; SNAP91, 3; SRCIN1, 1; SYNJ1, 1; SYT3, 2. 
Analytical validation was by confocal TIIFA (all), western blot (10/10 
available), and cell-based assay (5/5 performed). Clinical accompaniments were: 
encephalitis, 6; brainstem encephalitis, 2; encephalomyelitis, 2; cerebellar 
ataxia, 2; longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), 2; sensory 
neuronopathy, 1; peripheral neuropathy, 4, and movement disorders, 2. 
Inflammatory MRI abnormalities were identified in 5/16 patients (31%) with CNS 
disorders: T2 signal change (2), LETM (2), leptomeningeal enhancement (1). Seven 
of 8 (88%) had inflammatory CSF (pleocytosis, 5 [median 25.5 cells, range 
7-294]; elevated IgG index/synthesis rate, 4; CSF-exclusive oligoclonal bands, 
4). Six had paraneoplastic causation (lung cancer, 2; other, 4); 3 were 
postinfectious (1 each of COVID-19, HSV-1, and post-Group A streptococcal 
infection). Of 9 immunotherapy-treated patients, 5 improved.
INTERPRETATION: UNAs are partly accounted for by a repertoire of diverse mostly 
intracellular synaptic antigens. Their characterization is expedited by protein 
arrays and PhIPSeq. Further individual studies are needed to assess them as 
disease biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence indicates that baseline use of certain concomitant 
drugs may affect the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including 
PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 inhibitors, in patients with cancer. However, most 
previous studies have evaluated individual drug classes in isolation, without 
considering potential interactions among multiple drugs.
AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the individual and combined effects of 
commonly prescribed concomitant drugs on the efficacy and safety of ICI-based 
therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 124 patients with advanced or 
recurrent NSCLC who received first-line ICI-based treatments at a single 
institution. Drug exposure at treatment initiation was assessed for proton pump 
inhibitors (PPIs), low-dose aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
statins, biguanides, antibiotics, and probiotics. Associations with 
progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and immune-related 
adverse events (irAEs) were analyzed using multivariate Cox regression models.
RESULTS: PPI use was independently associated with shorter PFS (HR: 2.44, 
p < 0.001) and OS (HR: 2.04, p = 0.01). In contrast, low-dose aspirin use was 
independently associated with longer PFS (HR: 0.31, p = 0.01). Patients 
receiving both PPIs and aspirin had longer PFS and OS compared to those 
receiving PPIs alone, although the differences were not statistically 
significant. No consistent associations were observed for other drugs. The 
incidence of irAEs was not significantly affected by concomitant drug use.
CONCLUSION: PPI use at baseline may be associated with reduced efficacy of ICI 
therapy in NSCLC patients. In contrast, low-dose aspirin use was independently 
associated with improved PFS, and may potentially mitigate the negative effects 
of PPIs. These findings underscore the importance of considering concomitant 
drug use when initiating ICI treatment. Prospective studies are needed to 
validate these observations and clarify underlying mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Despite declining lung cancer death rates, minoritized patients 
still face health disparities compared to White patients. This study examines 
treatment preferences and decision-making differences among patients with 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and physicians from different racial and 
ethnic backgrounds in the US.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two cross-sectional online surveys were conducted from 
March-May 2023. Respondents were recruited from an NSCLC community and research 
panel. Recruitment goals were set to ensure diversity, by having African 
American or Black (hereafter, Black), Asian, Hispanic, and White patients and 
physicians included. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Across all racial and ethnic groups (N = 157), patients reported that 
extending life was the most important treatment attribute. Hispanic patients 
assigned more importance to treatment side effect (SE) risks compared to Asian, 
Black, and White patients. Larger proportions of Asian (63%) and White (73%) 
patients prioritized quality over quantity of life compared to Black (43%) and 
Hispanic (40%) patients. All physician groups ranked expected overall survival, 
progression-free survival, and duration of response as the top three treatment 
attributes. On a scale of 1 (high) to 10 (low), Black physicians expressed less 
concern about potential SEs (6.6) than other physician groups (≤5.3). Cost of 
treatment was consistently ranked with lower importance; however, over 80% of 
Black and Hispanic physicians thought that patient out-of-pocket costs or 
financial status were somewhat more or very important to their treatment 
recommendations.
CONCLUSION: Patients and physicians of different racial and ethnic backgrounds 
may place varying importance on several treatment attributes.

DNA nanotechnology has emerged as a transformative platform in molecular 
medicine over the past four decades. The structural and functional versatility 
of nanostructures like DNA origami, hydrogels, and aptamer-based systems, as 
well as their programmable, biocompatible natures, have contributed toward 
significant advances in a biomedical context, such as cancer-targeted therapies, 
infectious disease detection, gene delivery, novel tissue engineering, and 
regenerative medicine. Despite promising preclinical experiment data, actual 
clinical translation remains limited in the face of key challenges-biostability, 
immunogenicity, scalable manufacturing, and regulatory hurdles. This review 
provides a comprehensive overview of the field's pathway from fundamental 
principles to viable, real-world, clinical solutions. These barriers are 
critically evaluated, with a focus on optimizing safety, delivery, and in-vivo 
performance, and discuss emerging strategies to overcome these limitations, 
including DNA-protein hybrids, protective coatings, responsive designs, 
harnessing AI capacity and automation-enabled production pipelines, by combining 
insights from basic science, engineering, and translational medicine.

Madecassoside (MC) is an anti-inflammatory and antibacterial active substance 
extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine Centella asiatica. Based on 
network pharmacology and experimental validation, this study assessed MC's 
anti-breast cancer (BC) actions and related molecular pathways. CCK-8, Trypan 
Blue, and Hoechst33342/PI assays showed that MC significantly reduced BC cell 
activity, but it had little inhibitory effects on normal cells. Network 
pharmacology analysis predicted 40 intersection targets between MC and BC, 291 
GO-related biological processes, and 105 KEGG signaling pathways. The 
anti-breast cancer activity of MC is closely related to reactive oxygen species 
(ROS), AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. Through Annexin V-FITC/PI, flow 
cytometry, transwell, wound healing and western blotting experiments, it was 
found that MC induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, G2/M phase arrest and 
inhibited cell migration of MDA-MB-231 cells through MAPK/STAT3/NF-κB signaling 
pathway, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway, 
respectively. The induction and blocking effects were inhibited by the addition 
of ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Molecular docking showed that MC had 
significant binding ability with STAT3, CASP3, BCL2 and JUN targets in BC. In 
summary, MC induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and migration inhibition via 
ROS-mediated MAPK/STAT3/NF-κB, PI3K/AKT, and AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling 
pathways in MDA-MB-231 cells.

INTRODUCTION: Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are a class of antibiotics effective 
against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria owing to their ability to 
target DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. The growth of bacterial resistance to 
antimicrobials leads to greater attention to comparative evaluation of 
biological activities of pharmaceutical preparations. In this regard, a 
quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis is used for 
predicting FQ activity. QSAR serves as an effective tool for predicting 
antibacterial, antiviral, anti-cancer, genotoxic activity, etc. Moreover, the 
QSAR approach provides possibilities to estimate FQ contribution to the 
environment and ecosystems.
AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes more than 100 publications on QSAR and 
machine learning studies of various medicinal, chemical, and biological 
characteristics of FQs.
EXPERT OPINION: The authors expect the appearance of novel FQs with improved 
bactericidal activity. This will be done with in silico assistance of 
computer-aided drug design and artificial intelligence techniques in drug 
development. Future QSAR models will be effectively applied to three aspects of 
FQ activity: 1) detection of FQs with the use of immunoassays; 2) high photo- 
and biodegradability of antibiotics in the environment; 3) physicochemical 
activity, in particular photochemical production of singlet oxygen and free 
radical species.

The clinical challenges of treatment resistance and adverse reactions associated 
with targeted drug toxicity require significant expenditure on the development 
and trials of new therapeutic molecules. Such an approach as molecular 
repurposing allows ""giving a second life"" to available drugs by targeting them 
to new biotargets and testing them in various combinations. When developing new 
therapeutic strategies, it is important to consider the unique characteristics 
of different cancer tissues. Tumors of different organs may have different 
molecular profiles, and effective treatment should be directed exactly at 
targets specific to these tissues. This literature review is devoted to 
analyzing the current state of the pharmacological niche of protein kinase 
inhibitors, synthesis methods and the mechanism of action of existing approved 
drugs-inhibitors of major protein kinases. In addition, in this review we 
highlight modern approaches to modeling 3D tissue-specific organoids (tumoroids) 
used for testing anticancer agents, which are currently considered a promising 
platform for screening protein kinase inhibitors. Molecular drug repurposing and 
the next generation 3D organoids are important strategies in the fight against 
resistance to targeted drugs and in the development of new, more effective 
therapeutic agents.

Combing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cancer therapy modalities within 
one nanoplatform holds great potential for imaging-guided cancer theranostics. 
However, simultaneously achieving optimal MRI performance and satisfactory 
anti-cancer effects is still a challenge. Here, by manipulating the position of 
a Fe3O4 core that has MRI capability within a porous shell, this work 
synthesizes a series of core-shell structured Fe3O4@carbon/copper oxide 
nanoparticles (Fe3O4@C/CuOx NPs) in which the Fe3O4 core has different degrees 
of exposure. This work demonstrates that in an eccentric structure with 
maximally exposed Fe3O4 core, the NPs exhibits optimal MRI capability. 
Additionally, using polymer as scaffold blended with carbon-doped copper oxide, 
the shell of the NPs can integrate chemotherapy, photothermal therapy (PTT) and 
cuproptosis to exert synergistic anti-cancer effect in a pH/NIR dual responsive 
manner. The porous shell allows efficient DOX loading for chemotherapy, the 
copper oxide component serves as photothermal agents for PTT and triggers for 
cuproptosis. Last, the Fe3O4 core is also a nanozyme that possesses peroxidase 
(POD)-like properties, which enhances the efficacy of above-mentioned 
anti-cancer effects via promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This 
work evaluates the MRI-guided anti-cancer efficacy of the NPs both in vitro and 
in vivo, and demonstrates NPs' superior performance in imaging-guided cancer 
theranostics.

Colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) is one of the leading death causes among 
colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, yet its underlying molecular events remain 
poorly understood, particularly at the proteomic and phosphoproteomic levels. A 
proteogenomic analysis combining genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and 
phosphoproteomics is performed on 102 samples from 34 treatment-naïve CRLM 
patients, including primary CRC, adjacent normal colorectal, and matched liver 
metastasis tissues. CRC cell lines, organoids, mouse models, and an independent 
patient cohort are used to validate the findings. Proteomics and 
phosphoproteomics show profoundly dysregulated pathways in liver metastasis 
tissues, notably disruptions in carbon metabolism. Functional validation using 
CRC organoids and mouse models demonstrates that the one-carbon metabolism 
enzyme SHMT1 promotes CRC tumorigenesis and metastasis via formate-mediated AMPK 
inhibition, whereas PIM kinase-dependent NDRG1 Ser330 phosphorylation 
exacerbates liver metastasis by promoting ubiquitin-dependent degradation of 
NDRG1. Unsupervised clustering identifies two proteomic subtypes of liver 
metastasis samples with distinct clinical outcomes: a poor-prognosis C1 
(metabolism) subtype and a better-prognosis C2 (RNA function) subtype. 
Considering expression frequency, specificity, and functional relevance, FTCD, 
GPD1, SOD2, and EIF4B Ser422 phosphorylation are further identified and 
validated as subtype prognostic biomarkers. This study provides critical 
insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CRLM and offers resources for 
high-risk metastatic CRC.

BACKGROUND: Less than half of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2)-positive gastric cancer (GC) patients respond to trastuzumab plus 
chemotherapy, and the outcomes are unsatisfactory. Understanding the underlying 
mechanisms remains crucial for identifying patients who are more likely to 
benefit from treatment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed targeted DNA sequencing on paired 
pre-treatment and progressive tumour tissues from 22 HER2-positive advanced GC 
patients undergoing first-line treatment with trastuzumab and chemotherapy. 
Clinicopathological and genomic characteristics were assessed for the 
correlation with clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: A performance status (PS) of 0-1 was associated with improved 
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than a PS of 2. Poorly 
differentiated tumours exhibited shorter PFS than moderate or moderate-poor 
ones. Pre-treatment amplification of MYC or TOP2A gene was association with 
increased PFS, and suggested a potential benefit for OS. Patients with higher 
tumour mutation burden (TMB) experienced significantly worse PFS, while higher 
chromosome instability (CIN) appeared to be correlated with longer PFS. Compared 
to non-responders, responders had a higher CIN but similar TMB and intratumoural 
heterogeneity (ITH). PS and MYC amplification emerged as independent factors 
related to PFS according to multivariate survival analysis. Additionally, after 
treatment, TMB significantly increased in non-responders, while CIN 
significantly decreased in responders.
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-treatment MYC amplification and PS were independently 
associated with clinical outcomes in HER2-positive advanced GC patients treated 
with first-line trastuzumab plus chemotherapy. Dynamic post-treatment changes in 
TMB and CIS provide valuable insights into the relationship between therapeutic 
response and distinct evolutionary trajectories.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of thermal ablation (TA) 
for treating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN 1) among women with 
positive high-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV).
METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at Tu Du Hospital, Vietnam between 
August 2023 and February 2025. The study enrolled all the women aged greater 
than 30 years with CIN 1 and positive hr-HPV test treated with TA. The primary 
outcome included evaluation of healed lesion on cytology, colposcopy combined 
with visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid (VIA) and Lugol's iodine 
testing as well as HPV clearance rate. The secondary outcome included patient's 
satisfaction and undesirable effects during the treatment and follow-up visits.
RESULTS: Among 66 women eligible for inclusion in the study, the clearance rate 
of all hr-HPV genotypes at 3 and 6 months was 62.1% and 84.6%, respectively. The 
clearance rates of HPV 16 and HPV 18 after undergoing TA treatment was highly 
achieved at 88.8% and 85.7%, respectively. Overall, the clearance rate of HPV 
16, 12 other hr-HPV genotypes, overall hr-HPV genotypes and normal colposcopic 
findings were significantly improved following treatment compared to before 
treatment (P < 0.05). After 6 months, the overall cure rate of thermal ablation 
was observed at 60.6% (40/66 cases). The most common side effects included 
vaginal heat (43.1%), abdominal pain (34.8%), and vaginal pain (27.9%). On 
monitoring, patient's satisfaction was highly achieved at 93.9% on day 0 
post-treatment and for 95.5% at 3-month control visit. No adverse effects as 
well as requirement of repeated ablation were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Thermal ablation is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated 
treatment for women with CIN 1 and positive hr-HPV genotypes. This reliable 
modality shows a promising option for cervical cancer prevention in low-resource 
settings. Further studies are required to strengthen these findings in different 
populations.

Disparities in prostate cancer incidence and mortality among Black men exist in 
Suffolk County, New York, indicating a need to provide effective educational 
interventions about prostate cancer screening for this population. We conducted 
a mixed-methods study exploring Black men's knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs 
about prostate cancer, and how they access health information. Three 
semi-structured virtual focus groups were conducted by Black male physicians 
with 18 Black men aged 40 years and over living in Suffolk County, New York. All 
were recorded, transcribed, and coded to identify key themes. Participants also 
completed surveys assessing prostate cancer knowledge and information 
preferences. Quantitative and qualitative results were analyzed using SPSS and 
NVivo software. Recruitment required extensive outreach. Even among relatively 
well-educated participants, more prostate cancer knowledge was needed, and 11% 
had not obtained screening because they were not aware they needed it. Family 
history prompted prostate cancer concerns, and fear of dying from prostate 
cancer motivated screening. Health information from reputable website sources 
was preferred, with social media drawing attention to educational opportunities 
and education portraying individuals to whom Black men could relate. 
Participants expressed desire for further engagement between their community, 
the academic hospital, and physicians. Our results indicated that despite being 
relatively knowledgeable about prostate cancer, Black men desire stronger ties 
and trust between their community and health care providers to facilitate 
screening. These data may assist health care professionals in designing 
practical educational tools and tailored programs about prostate cancer 
screening among Black men who are at increased risk of disease.

""Leucine zipper proteins as emerging therapeutic regulators: structural 
dynamics, disease associations, and novel targeting strategies"".

Leucine zipper proteins are transcription factors that regulate gene activity 
through DNA binding and creating stable pairs. They are located in particular 
tissues and are involved in significant processes like metabolism, immunity, and 
stress response. The C/EBPβ (CCAAT/Enhancer-Binding Proteins), which is 
predominantly active in the liver and spleen, regulates metabolism and immune 
activity. The GILZ (glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper), which is located in 
the brain, lungs, immune cells, and reproductive system, may protect against 
inflammation and stress. Hormonal signals or oxidative stress may cause these 
proteins to be activated and transported to the nucleus to turn off or turn on 
the genes. The disruption of balance, such as the loss of GILZ, drives 
inflammation, which may cause diseases. Therapies include small molecules, 
peptides, or DNA decoy therapy. The selective control of these proteins via 
biomarker profiling and targeted tissue delivery has potential in mitigating 
cancer, inflammatory, and metabolic diseases.

The discrepancy in reliability and evidence conflict in multimodal data fusion 
for medical image prediction significantly undermines the accuracy of clinical 
decision-making. To address this challenge, we propose an Adaptive 
Evidence-Gated Fusion Network (AEGFN) based on Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence 
theory. This framework models the evidence quality and cognitive uncertainty of 
CT images, image sequences, and clinical data using the Dirichlet distribution. 
We innovatively introduce an Evidence-Attention Gate (EAG) to dynamically adjust 
fusion weights for high-conflict modalities (conflict > 0.6), enabling 
conflict-aware uncertainty compensation. Additionally, a hybrid loss function 
combining KL divergence regularization with uncertainty-weighted cross-entropy 
is designed to balance model confidence and generalization. Evaluated on 
colorectal cancer (656 cases) and radiation pneumonitis (117 cases) datasets for 
binary classification tasks (predicting patient death and predicting RP 
occurrence), AEGFN achieves classification accuracies of 95.04% (AUC 0.97) and 
82.34% (AUC 0.8312), outperforming the state-of-the-art method DDEF by 0.66% and 
1.94%, respectively. This work provides a robust and interpretable solution for 
multimodal medical prediction, enhancing the reliability of clinical decision 
support systems.

Soluble tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL) serves 
as a pivotal biomarker for the diagnosis and prognostic stratification of 
cancer, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. However, current 
plasma sTRAIL detection is constrained by the suboptimal sensitivity of 
commercial ELISA kits and excessive testing costs, impeding its clinical 
translation. To address these limitations, the anti-sTRAIL nanobody (Nb93) was 
nondestructively displayed on the M13 phage minor capsid protein pIII, while the 
phage major capsid protein pVIII (about 2700 copies/phage) was used as the 
scaffold to combine with a large number of HRP-conjugated anti-M13 antibodies to 
achieve two-stage signal amplification and improve the detection sensitivity. 
For cost reduction, the conventional PEG/NaCl phage enrichment step was 
eliminated; instead, the phage amplification culture supernatant was directly 
used for detection. This modification not only reduced the use of reagents but 
also saved time and labor costs. Under optimal conditions, the developed 
sandwich ELISA (with mAb5B3 as the capture antibody and phage-displayed Nb93 as 
the detector) exhibited a broad quantitative range of 3.91-250 pg/mL and high 
specificity for human sTRAIL. The recovery rates of sTRAIL in spiked plasma 
samples ranged from 91.82 to 107.48%. Clinical testing of 6 myocardial 
infarction patients revealed a significant reduction in sTRAIL levels after 
reperfusion, indicating a poor prognosis. This work provides a sensitive and 
cost-effective analytical tool for sTRAIL detection and a generalizable 
amplification strategy for immunoassays targeting low-abundance disease 
biomarkers.

University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran.

BACKGROUND: Quercetin, a natural flavonoid, has established significant 
anticancer properties through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and signaling 
pathway modulation effects. However, due to the issues with absorption and 
insufficient bioavailability, its clinical usefulness is still restricted. The 
purpose of this review is to review quercetin's potential as a new supplemental 
treatment for cancer, with a focus on the myeloid-epithelial-reproductive 
tyrosine kinase (MerTK) pathway and the downstream signaling cascades. We study 
ways to improve its clinical usefulness by resolving its limitations.
RECENT FINDINGS: To examine research on quercetin's mechanisms of action, its 
impact on MerTK and downstream pathways, and the application of efficient drug 
delivery technologies, a thorough literature analysis was carried out. Quercetin 
effectively modulates MerTK-mediated signaling pathways, reducing tumor 
progression, angiogenesis, and immune evasion. It suppresses PD-L1 expression, 
inhibits cancer stem cell maintenance, and enhances apoptosis. Emerging evidence 
suggests nanoparticle-based delivery systems can improve querecetin's 
bioavailability, enabling its integration into combination therapies alongside 
MerTK inhibitors.
CONCLUSION: Quercetin holds great promise as a complementary therapeutic agent 
targeting MerTK and associated signaling pathways. Advanced delivery systems and 
combination strategies with MerTK inhibitors can overcome its clinical 
limitations and enhance its efficacy in cancer therapies. Future studies, 
particularly clinical trials, are needed to validate these findings and optimize 
quercetin's translational potential.

This article discusses issues of ethical concern in the conduct of a 
prospective, cluster randomised controlled trial for evaluating effectiveness of 
screening by clinical breast examination for downstaging of breast cancer, and 
in reducing mortality from the disease, in comparison to no screening. This 
trial was conducted in Mumbai, India, over 20 years, from May 1998 to March 
2019. Trained primary health workers provided health education, visual 
inspection of cervix and clinical breast examination in the screening arm. Women 
in the control arm were provided only health education and not provided any 
intervention, though screening mammography is an established, standard 
procedure, which is also available in Mumbai; the risks of not having the 
examination, and the benefits of having the examination (mammography or clinical 
examination by health worker), in terms of early detection and hence the 
possibility of starting early treatment, were not explained; furthermore, there 
were several differences in the English and Marathi informed consent forms.

Indira Chakravarthi's critique relates to our paper published in the British 
Medical Journal in 2021 titled ""Effect of screening by clinical breast 
examination on breast cancer incidence and mortality after 20 years: 
prospective, cluster randomised controlled trial in Mumbai"". The study addressed 
the unanswered questions as to whether clinical breast examination (CBE) 
conducted by female health workers would lead to a reduction in mortality from 
breast cancer. Chakravarthi raises multiple issues relating to our study and we 
provide in this paper point-by-point responses to these issues. The results of 
our study show that two-yearly CBE screening can reduce death rate from breast 
cancer by 30% in women above the age of 50 and to a lesser extent to those below 
this age. CBE screening if implemented in low- and middle-income countries can 
save thousands of lives globally each year.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Colorectal Cancer—Diagnosis, Treatment, Prevention, 
and Long-Term Follow-Up Care.

Ebert MP, Reichermeier S, Klug L, Lynen Jansen P, Pox C.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 24 000 people die of colorectal cancer (CRC) in 
Germany each year. New developments in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment are 
improving long-term outcomes. These measures have been incorporated in the 
updated guideline and are presented here along with the findings of other new 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
METHODS: A systematic search (2022-2023) was conducted for guidelines, 
reviews/meta-analyses, and primary studies (search term ""colorectal cancer""; 
databases: international guideline registries, PubMed, Cochrane). 123 reviews 
were identified, evaluated, and used in the creation of the guideline.
RESULTS: Early detection is performed with colonoscopy every 10 years, 
sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, or an immunological stool test for occult blood 
every 1-2 years; it can lower cancer-related mortality by up to 30%. Hereditary 
forms (Lynch syndrome, polyposis) require more intensive monitoring. All 
diagnosed cases must be presented to a tumor board. In the case of low-risk pT1 
carcinoma, extended resection is not indicated after complete endoscopic 
removal. As for surgery, robotic and laparoscopic procedures are equivalent 
(3-year recurrence rate 1.6% and 4.0% respectively, in a recent RCT; adjusted 
hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval: [0.19; 0.80]). Treatment of 
patients with mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) or microsatellite instability 
(MSI) with checkpoint inhibitors yields response above 90%. Further systemic 
therapies are based on the molecular tumor profile (dMMR/MSI, RAS, and BRAF). 
Organ-preserving strategies after a complete response require intensive 
follow-up care.
CONCLUSION: The efficacy of early detection is undisputed. Less evidence is 
available concerning the optimal level of intensity of follow-up care. The 
clinical and molecular stratification of tumors enables differential treatment. 
Organ-preserving strategies after a complete response to therapy are an 
important area of current research.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains clinically challenging due to the 
lack of therapeutic targets and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Despite 
its targeted potential, photothermal therapy (PTT) faces limitations in clinical 
applications due to tumor thermotolerance, insufficient immunogenic cell death 
(ICD) induction, and unpredictable nanodrug metabolism. Herein, we developed a 
chitosan/β-glycerophosphate thermosensitive hydrogel (CS/GP@MTO Gel) using 
clinical tracer mitoxantrone hydrochloride (MTO). Under physiological 
temperature, the system enables precise in situ delivery of MTO nanocrystals via 
a sol-gel phase transition. Under 660 nm laser irradiation, the photothermal 
effect generated by MTO enhances chemosensitivity, while MTO downregulates heat 
shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression through DNA damage signaling, thereby 
reducing the thermal resistance effect and establishing synergistic 
chemo-photothermal therapy. This strategy significantly triggers the release of 
damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), remodeling the immunosuppressive 
niche. Furthermore, in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (anti-PD-L1), it 
effectively inhibits primary and metastatic tumor progression. This study 
provides an innovative TNBC treatment strategy with targeting capabilities and 
immunomodulatory functions.

BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the impact of early modification of upfront 
androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI) on outcomes among patients with 
metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC).
METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter cohort study included 590 patients with 
mHSPC who received upfront ARSI combined with androgen deprivation therapy. All 
had a follow-up duration of ≥ 6 months. The impact of early modification of ARSI 
without progression on survival outcomes was analyzed. The inverse probability 
of treatment weighting (IPTW) was applied to adjust for confounding factors 
associated with survival outcomes, comparing patients who did and did not 
discontinue ARSI early.
RESULTS: Upfront abiraterone acetate, apalutamide, and enzalutamide were used in 
50.8%, 28.1%, and 21.0% of patients, respectively. The rates of withdrawal of 
the upfront ARSI and initial dose reduction were 21.2% and 6.1%, respectively. 
The highest withdrawal rate (33.1%) was with apalutamide, mainly due to adverse 
events (89.1%). Apalutamide use (odds ratio [OR] 2.39, 95% CI: 1.50-3.80) and a 
low-risk CHAARTED status (OR 1.84, 95% CI: 1.08-3.14) were identified as 
independent risk factors for early ARSI withdrawal. IPTW analysis revealed early 
ARSI withdrawal (within 6 months) significantly correlated with poor 
castration-resistant prostate cancer-free survival (CRPC-FS) (p = 0.004) and 
second progression-free survival (PFS2) (p = 0.035). However, it had no 
significant relationship with overall survival (p = 0.280).
CONCLUSIONS: Early withdrawal of initial upfront ARSI was associated with poor 
CRPC-FS and PFS2 among mHSPC patients. Maximizing the effectiveness of 
first-line treatment requires optimal management of ARSI therapy.

Splice site mutations around or within exon 14 of MET (METex14+) are rare, but 
are one of the common actionable driver mutations in elderly patients with 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Globally, only two MET tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs), both Type Ib (capmatinib and tepotinib), have been approved 
in a single Phase 2 trial. In China, three additional Type Ib MET TKIs 
(savolitinib, gumarontinib, and vebreltinib), in addition to capmatinib, and 
tepotinib, have been approved. Here, we report the timeline for MET TKIs 
approval in China. We summarized the Chinese METex14+ NSCLC demographic and 
molecular characteristics and reviewed pivotal phase 2 data (clinical efficacy 
and adverse events). All five MET TKIs seem to have similar efficacy and adverse 
events with vebreltinib reported numerically the highest BIRC-ORR. Notably, the 
gumarontinib (GLORY) trial conducted in both China and Japan also led to the 
approval of gumarontinib in Japan for METex14+ NSCLC. On June 30, 2025, 
vebreltinib has been approved for NSCLC with MET amplification while combination 
of savoltinib and osimertinib has been approved for EGFR+ post EGFR TKINSCLC 
with MET amplification post EGFR TKI based on the SACHI trial (NCT05015608). We 
discuss the current unmet clinical need (need to develop Type II MET TKI to 
overcome acquired resistance MET mutations at D1228 and Y1230) and future 
optimal treatment approaches.

The design of multifunctional nanomaterials capable of addressing both 
environmental and biomedical challenges is a growing focus in modern materials 
science. In this study, we report the synthesis of a silver 
nanoparticle-embedded on chitosan-boron carbon nitride (Ag@CS-BCN), crosslinked 
with glutaraldehyde, via a multi-step process. The structural, morphological, 
elemental, and stability characteristics of the synthesised nanohybrid 
systematically investigated using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The 
catalytic performance of Ag@CS-BCN was evaluated for the reduction of 
4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and the degradation of methyl orange (MO) and rhodamine B 
(RhB), persistent organic pollutants of environmental concern. The nanocomposite 
exhibited rapid catalytic activity, achieving >94% degradation within minutes 
(4-NP: 5 min, 99.82%; MO: 3 min, 94.50%; RhB: 7 min, 98.89%), and demonstrated 
recyclability for up to three consecutive cycles with minimal loss in 
performance. Beyond environmental applications, Ag@CS-BCN displayed potent 
antimicrobial efficacy against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial 
strains. Importantly, cytotoxicity studies revealed selective anticancer 
activity, with an IC50 value of 45.73 μg mL-1 against HeLa cancer cells and 
substantially lower toxicity toward normal 3T3 fibroblasts (IC50 = 446.6 μg 
mL-1). Overall, the Ag@CS-BCN nanohybrid demonstrates significant promise as a 
multiple-purpose material for environmental remediation and biomedical 
applications, particularly in nanocatalysis, antimicrobial, and targeted 
anticancer therapy, thereby offering an innovative platform for sustainable and 
therapeutic technologies.

Single-layer biosensor for urinary prostate-cancer biomarkers through 
transition-metal-doped graphene: a DFT study.

Early, non-invasive detection of prostate cancer (PCa) remains a major clinical 
challenge, as current screening methods carry significant drawbacks. Biosensors 
targeting urinary PCa biomarkers offer a promising alternative. Motivated by the 
recurrent appearance of sarcosine and furan-3-methanol in urinary volatilomics, 
and by the growing application of 2D nanomaterials in metabolite detection, we 
employed first-principles calculations to investigate pristine graphene and 
gold-, palladium-, and silver-doped graphenes as potential single-layer 
biosensors. We compared atomic optimizations, adsorption energies, band-gap 
shifts, charge-density differences, recovery times, conductivity changes, and 
theoretical sensing responses to identify the most effective sensor. Our results 
revealed that pristine graphene fails to adsorb either molecule; Au-doping binds 
sarcosine strongly but inadequately retains furan-3-methanol; Pd-doping leads to 
insufficient retention for both analytes; and Ag-doping enables rapid desorption 
of furan-3-methanol yet provides optimal sensing for sarcosine. Overall, 
Ag-doped graphene demonstrates strong potential as a room-temperature sensor for 
sarcosine, while detecting furan-3-methanol will require alternative chemistries 
or device architectures.

OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy worldwide. 
Insulin resistance (IR) plays a key role in its progression by activating 
oncogenic signaling pathways. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is a 
validated, cost-effective surrogate marker for IR. This study aims to evaluate 
the prevalence of IR in female breast cancer patients using the TyG index and to 
identify lipid parameters associated with increased IR, thereby supporting 
strategies for secondary prevention.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among non-diabetic, 
histopathologically confirmed female breast cancer patients. Demographic data, 
lipid profiles, and fasting glucose levels were collected. Participants were 
stratified into high-risk (TyG≥8.87) and low-risk (TyG<8.87) groups based on 
their TyG index. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify 
significant predictors of elevated TyG index.
RESULTS: Among 122 patients, 44.3% demonstrated elevated insulin resistance. 
Triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), very low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (VLDL-C), and the TC/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) 
ratio were significantly higher in the high-risk group. Logistic regression 
identified TC, TC/HDL-C ratio, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 
as significant predictors of elevated IR (p<0.05). The model is represented as: 
Logit(P)=-13.941+0.145X1+1.558X2-0.178X3, where X1, X2, and X3 correspond to TC, 
TC/HDL-C ratio, and LDL-C, respectively. The predictive model achieved 90.2% 
accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
(AUROC) of 0.927.
CONCLUSION: Monitoring lipid parameters and managing insulin resistance are 
crucial for enhancing breast cancer prognosis and potentially reducing 
progression.

Piezo1, a trimeric mechanosensitive cation channel discovered in 2010 and 
recognized with the 2021 Nobel Prize for its seminal role in 
mechanotransduction, has emerged as a key transducer of mechanical forces into 
calcium ions (Ca2+) signaling. Its distinctive propeller-like structure confers 
high mechanosensitivity, enabling rapid and graded Ca2+ influx under diverse 
mechanical stimuli such as shear stress, stretch, or compression. This Ca2+ 
entry establishes localized nanodomains and amplifies signals via Ca2+-induced 
Ca2+ release, thereby activating a spectrum of downstream effectors including 
CaMKII, NFAT, and YAP/TAZ. Through these pathways, Piezo1 orchestrates critical 
physiological processes including vascular tone, skeletal remodeling, immune 
responses, neural plasticity, and organ development. Conversely, its 
dysregulation drives numerous pathologies, ranging from hypertension and 
atherosclerosis to neurodegeneration, fibrosis, osteoarthritis, and cancer. 
Advances in pharmacological modulators (e.g., Yoda1, GsMTx4), gene-editing, and 
nanomedicine underscore promising therapeutic opportunities, though challenges 
persist in tissue specificity, off-target effects, and nonlinear Ca2+ dynamics. 
This review synthesizes current knowledge on Piezo1-mediated Ca2+ signaling, 
delineates its dual roles in physiology and disease, and evaluates emerging 
therapeutic strategies. Future integration of structural biology, systems 
mechanobiology, and artificial intelligence is poised to enable precision 
targeting of Piezo1 in clinical practice.

Abdominal tuberculosis (TB) is a rare extrapulmonary manifestation of TB in 
Europe. It may resemble ovarian cancer, especially when ascites, an adnexal 
mass, and elevated CA-125 levels are present. This case report aims to underline 
the significance of considering abdominal TB as a differential diagnosis when 
evaluating ascites with an adnexal mass. The presence of an adnexal mass and 
ascites should prompt consideration of a TB origin among the possible causes. 
This case highlights a significant diagnostic challenge, with delays in both 
diagnosis and management. The patient was evaluated across six specialities 
(Accident & Emergency, Acute Medicine, Gynaecology, Gynae-Oncology, Infectious 
Diseases, and Respiratory Medicine), illustrating the complexity and multisystem 
involvement that contributed to the prolonged diagnostic pathway. Diagnosis of 
abdominal TB can be challenging and time-consuming. Imaging and tumour markers 
alone are insufficient. Definitive diagnosis often requires histopathological 
examination and PCR testing to confirm the presence and nature of the disease.

Comparative insights into Fusobacterium nucleatum and Helicobacter pylori in 
human cancers.

Kazakhstan.

Fusobacterium nucleatum and Helicobacter pylori are two microbial species 
increasingly recognized for their roles in gastrointestinal (GI) carcinogenesis, 
particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastric cancer (GC), respectively. 
While H. pylori has been long classified as a Group 1 carcinogen due to its 
well-characterized pathogenic mechanisms, F. nucleatum has more recently emerged 
as a key microbial contributor to CRC, with growing evidence linking it to tumor 
progression, immune evasion, and poor clinical outcomes. Despite occupying 
anatomically distinct niches within the GI tract, both bacteria converge on 
similar oncogenic pathways, including the activation of NF-κB signaling, 
β-catenin pathway dysregulation, and epithelial barrier disruption. In parallel, 
dietary factors - particularly the consumption of red and processed meats - 
contribute additional oncogenic pressure via carcinogenic compounds such as heme 
iron, N-nitroso compounds, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. These dietary 
components not only damage host tissue but may also potentiate bacterial 
virulence and promote microbial persistence. This review provides a comparative 
analysis of the oncogenic strategies employed by F. nucleatum and H. pylori, 
with an emphasis on their interactions with diet-derived carcinogens and 
implications for therapeutic interventions targeting the microbiota-diet-host 
axis in GI cancers.

University, Toronto, ON, Canada.

Significant advances in the treatment of cancer have been achieved as reflected 
by the ever-expanding space of cancer therapeutics being available to cancer 
patients. Often, however, it is not clear which patient would respond to which 
drug and what combination of drugs will improve patient outcomes. Furthermore, 
while many of these drugs are initially effective, therapeutic resistance is 
often inevitable due to the evolving nature of cancer. Generative artificial 
intelligence (GenAI) powered by the increasingly large amount of accumulating 
clinical, molecular, and radiomics data about cancer patients and their 
treatments may serve as the kernel of rapid learning decision-support systems 
that could enable personalized cancer treatments to counter therapeutic 
resistance and overcome the shortcomings of the current standard of care. This 
perspective is explored in the context of current advances of AI applications in 
oncology and the potential of GenAI learning and inferencing capabilities to 
support patient-tailored dynamic cancer treatments. A discussion of this vision 
is elaborated with respect to issues pertinent to GenAI use in real-world 
clinical settings, including clinical validation, data curation, and sharing, 
large language model hallucinations as well as ethical concerns and 
considerations such as privacy, bias, transparency, and accountability.

Gastric cancer (GC) is a malignant tumor with extremely high morbidity and 
mortality. The incidence of GC in China is second only to that of lung cancer, 
seriously threatening human health and safety. Glycolysis is one of the 
important ways for cells to obtain energy and most tumor cells also rely on 
aerobic glycolysis, which plays a key role in the occurrence and development of 
GC. This article aims to systematically summarize the effects of key glycolytic 
enzymes and their upstream regulatory genes on GC, to provide a basis for 
revealing the pathogenesis of GC, and to evaluate potential therapeutic targets 
for GC.

Institute of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.

BACKGROUND: While the characteristics of pathologic nipple discharge (PND) are 
well documented in the literature, comparative clinical and risk factor analyses 
across different pathologic subtypes are lacking.
METHODS: Medical records of patients with nipple discharge were retrospectively 
retrieved from an electronic medical record database and analyzed. In this 
study, 375 patients with a postoperative pathologically confirmed diagnosis of 
PND were included.
RESULTS: Age serves as an important independent risk factor for precancerous 
lesions and breast cancer, with the median age increasing alongside the severity 
of the pathology. Individuals under 45 years of age predominantly exhibited 
non-neoplastic and benign neoplastic lesions, whereas those over 45 were more 
likely to have precancerous lesions or breast cancer, with statistical 
significance (p < 0.01). Discharge color was a significant factor in 
distinguishing between different pathological findings (p < 0.01). Discharge 
color serves as an important independent risk factor for breast cancer. Bloody 
discharge was associated with a significantly higher incidence of breast cancer 
and precancerous lesions compared to non-bloody discharges. Upon dividing bloody 
discharge into brown and bright red for in-depth analysis, no significant 
difference was observed among the different pathological types (p > 0.05). 
Ductoscopy has a higher diagnostic rate for breast cancer and precancerous 
lesions (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest the clinical characteristics of PND patients 
across four pathological types: non-neoplastic lesions, benign neoplastic 
lesions, precancerous lesions, and breast cancer, at the same time emphasizing 
the importance of age and discharge color as independent risk factors in the 
prognosis and management of nipple discharge.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common malignant tumour of the urinary system, 
characterised by high heterogeneity and a tendency to metastasise, with poor 
prognosis in advanced patients. Although surgical resection and targeted 
therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors 
have significantly improved survival outcomes in some patients, drug resistance 
and recurrence remain clinical challenges. In recent years, extracellular 
vesicles (EVs) and the microRNAs (miRNAs) they carry have emerged as a research 
hotspot due to their critical roles in tumour initiation, progression, immune 
regulation, and drug resistance. This systematic review summarises the 
biological functions of EVs-derived miRNAs in renal cell carcinoma and their 
potential applications in clinical diagnosis and treatment, with a focus on 
their value in diagnosis, prognosis, immune regulation, and prediction of 
treatment response.

The limited efficacy of chemotherapy induced by the hypoxic tumor 
microenvironment remains a major obstacle in clinical oncology. To address this, 
we designed and synthesized a series of aggregation-induced emission 
photosensitizers with donor-π-acceptor structures, exemplified by SC-3. Upon 
assembly with cucurbit[8]-uril (CB[8]), the nanosupramolecular photosensitizer 
2SC-3/CB[8] significantly enhanced singlet oxygen (1O2) generation and 
exacerbated cellular hypoxia. When coadministered with the hypoxia-activated 
chemotherapeutic tirapazamine (TPZ), we found that 2SC-3/CB[8] further amplified 
TPZ's antitumor efficacy in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Experimental studies 
and density functional theory calculations confirmed that SC-3 exhibits potent 
photodynamic therapy activity with high mitochondrial specificity. In addition, 
we found that CB[8]-induced depletion of intracellular spermine further 
contributed to the death of the tumor cells. Together, these findings highlight 
the potential of combining supramolecular photosensitizers with 
hypoxia-activated chemotherapy as a promising and synergistic strategy for the 
treatment of solid tumors.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a heterogeneous population of immune 
cells that play a pivotal role in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of lung 
cancer. TAMs, which include both monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and 
tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs), exhibit distinct functions that influence 
tumor progression, metastasis, and response to therapy. Recent studies have 
highlighted the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of TAMs, with MDMs primarily 
promoting tumor growth and immune suppression, while TRMs contribute to tissue 
homeostasis but can be reprogrammed to support tumor progression. Both subtypes 
contribute to the formation of an immunosuppressive TME, facilitate tumor 
metastasis through matrix remodeling, and contribute to therapeutic resistance 
by modulating the efficacy of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and 
immunotherapy. Understanding the specific roles and heterogeneity of MDMs and 
TRMs as components of TAMs in lung cancer opens avenues for targeted therapies, 
such as inhibiting their recruitment, reprogramming their polarization, or 
blocking their pro-tumorigenic functions. This review synthesizes current 
knowledge on TAMs in lung cancer, highlighting their dual roles and the 
potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies that target these 
macrophages to improve patient outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: The advantage of ion beam radiotherapy for cancer lies in its low 
dose proximal and distal to the tumor, owed to an energy-dependent depth-dose 
profile, the Bragg-peak. However, conventional techniques to achieve different 
energies often rely on degraders, which compromise the quality and intensity of 
the beam and produce secondary radiation.
METHODS: We propose a novel conceptual design for a compact accelerator capable 
of delivering ion beams (e.g., protons or carbon ions) with variable energy from 
70 to 230 MeV/amu. Removing all magnetic iron from the device yields a linear 
relationship between coil current and cyclotron magnetic field, and, thus, 
smooth scaling of the output beam energy. We base our findings on finite 
elements calculations, particle ray-tracing and particle-in-cell simulations.
RESULTS: In the absence of magnetic iron, we achieve a much lighter system with 
improved magnetic shielding and significantly reduced secondary radiation that 
can provide ion beams at variable energy while providing the high beam intensity 
necessary for the promising FLASH technique at all output energies.
DISCUSSION: This design represents a promising advancement in ion beam 
radiotherapy, combining energy flexibility, reduced radiation hazards, and 
compatibility with high-intensity techniques. It may pave the way for more 
efficient, compact, and clinically versatile accelerator systems.

BACKGROUND: Background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) observed on dynamic 
contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI of the contralateral breast is considered to be 
associated with survival outcomes. However, the prognostic significance of BPE 
in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is unclear.
METHODS: Between March 2017 and June 2019, 76 TNBC patients undergoing 
neoadjuvant therapy and subsequent surgery were included in the study. All 
patients underwent DCE MRI before and after neoadjuvant therapy. Radiologists 
graded BPE as minimum, mild, moderate, and marked. The BPE level was analyzed 
according to clinicopathological characteristics and MRI findings. Survival 
analysis was conducted for clinicopathological characteristics and MRI findings 
according to disease-free survival (DFS).
RESULTS: The mean age was 51.29 ± 9.53 years; 46 (60.5%) patients achieved 
pathological complete response (pCR), and 13 (17.1%) patients developed 
recurrence, with a median follow-up of 80 months (interquartile range: 64, 90). 
Dichotomous BPE (minimal/mild vs. moderate/marked) on post-NAC MRI was 
statistically associated with post-NAC ADC and menopausal status. Patients with 
BPE changing from high to low level demonstrated statistically lower recurrence 
rate than patients with BPE changing from low to high (P = 0.022). BPE on 
post-NAC MRI was in the final multivariate Cox model for DFS (HR = 6.57, 
minimal/mild: HR = 1), along with multifocality on post-NAC MRI (HR = 3.65, no 
multifocality: HR = 1) and pCR (HR = 7.27, pCR: HR = 1).
CONCLUSION: Contralateral BPE and its change after neoadjuvant chemotherapy may 
reflect the recurrence risk in triple-negative breast cancer patients.

Spasmolytic Polypeptide-Expressing Metaplasia (SPEM) is a gastric fundic gland 
metaplasia resembling deep antral glands, associated with drug injury, 
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), or bile reflux. Early-stage SPEM acts as a 
reparative response, but if the damaging stimuli persist, the metaplastic 
changes may become irreversible, raising the risk of gastric cancer development. 
Traditionally, SPEM arises via passive transdifferentiation of chief cells 
following parietal cell loss. However, recent lineage tracing and genetic models 
challenge this, suggesting active depletion of chief cells and involvement of 
isthmus stem cells also contribute to SPEM development, intensifying debate over 
its cellular origins. This review synthesizes SPEM's physicochemical drivers and 
critically evaluates evidence for the three proposed sources: (1) passive chief 
cell transdifferentiation (2), active chief cell loss, and (3) isthmus stem 
cells. Clarifying the heterogeneity in the origin of SPEM is challenging until 
more specific cell ablation techniques are developed, but timely classification 
of existing research may be instructive.

PURPOSE: To investigate the effects and mechanisms of Hsp70-mediated regulation 
of CD24 expression on the invasion and metastasis of lung cancer.
METHODS: Protein-protein interactions between Hsp70 and CD24 were analyzed by 
co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. Lentiviral-mediated Hsp70 
knockdown and CD24 overexpression were validated using RT-qPCR and Western 
blotting. Functional consequences were assessed through CCK-8 proliferation 
assays, colony formation, wound healing, Transwell migration/invasion, and 
angiogenesis assays. In vivo metastatic potential was evaluated using a tail 
vein injection model in nude mice.
RESULTS: Hsp70 and CD24 demonstrated interaction through co-precipitation. 
Knockdown of Hsp70 significantly attenuated CD24 expression (p<0.01), whereas 
CD24 overexpression did not alter Hsp70 levels. Phenotypically, Hsp70 
suppression impaired cellular proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenic 
capacity, while CD24 overexpression potentiated these oncogenic properties. Both 
manipulations modulated ERK1/2, MEK, Raf and Ras phosphorylation status.
CONCLUSION: Hsp70 upregulates CD24 expression and activates downstream MAPK/ERK 
signaling, thereby enhancing the metastatic and invasive capacity of lung 
cancer.

OBJECTIVE: False negatives in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening remained a 
widespread concern, particularly given the notable incidence of false negative 
results from fecal immunochemical test (FIT). We aimed to investigate the missed 
diagnoses resulting from primary screening conducted in China that combined the 
high risk factor questionnaire (HRFQ) with double FITs.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in Yuexiu district of 
Guangzhou. Among 69,809 eligible participants who completed the primary 
screening between 2015 and 2021, we focused on the analysis of 527 subjects who 
had negative primary screening but underwent colonoscopy.
RESULTS: These individuals showed statistically comparable prevalence of overall 
colorectal neoplasms (CRN), advanced colorectal neoplasms (ACRN), and CRC in 
comparison with those having positive primary screening results (all P>0.05). 
When compared with subjects having negative primary screening results but no 
colonoscopy, screening negative participants with colonoscopy were more likely 
to be younger, possess higher education levels, and have one risk factor for 
CRC. A logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the missed diagnoses might 
attribute to the limited risk predictive ability of HRFQ for non-advanced 
adenoma (OR[95% CI]: 1.11 [0.98, 1.26]; P = 0.103), advanced adenoma (AA) (0.44 
[0.38, 0.50]; P < 0.001), CRC (0.39 [0.29, 0.53]; P < 0.001), CRN (0.66 [0.59, 
0.73]; P < 0.001) and ACRN (0.41 [0.36, 0.47]; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with negative primary screening results but having active 
screening willingness should consider an earlier colonoscopy due to HRFQ's 
limited risk predictive ability for colorectal lesions, highlighting an urgency 
in re-assessment and improvement of the CRC risk scoring system.

Cervical cancer (CC) remains among the top causes of death for women worldwide, 
especially in low-income countries, where screening strategies are less 
widespread. Treatment strategies are mainly based on DNA-damaging agents, though 
resistance mechanisms still pose a substantial challenge. Among the cellular 
components that mediate treatment resistance, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) 
stand out because of their broad regulatory effects. They are involved in 
virtually all drug resistance mechanisms, such as drug efflux, DNA repair, 
evasion of cell death, and aberrant epigenetic modifications. Although 
resistance mechanisms are fundamentally similar in most cancers, the underlying 
regulatory networks vary substantially. Here, we review the literature for 
lncRNAs involved in treatment resistance mechanisms in general, and then focus 
on lncRNAs that mediate resistance in CC. We found a broad area of opportunity 
in lncRNA research in resistant CC, as the lncRNAs involved are still to be 
described. These master regulators are promising candidates for response markers 
and therapeutic targets. May this compilation serve as the basis for further 
descriptions of the regulatory roles of lncRNA in CC treatment resistance.

AIMS: To predict pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 
advanced gastric cancer by integrating multimodal radiomic and pathomic data.
METHODS: Eligible patients with advanced gastric cancer underwent neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy followed by radical gastrectomy. We collected pre-treatment 
venous-phase computed tomography (CT) scans and whole-slide H&E-stained 
gastroscopic biopsy sections for feature extraction. Three models were 
constructed: a unimodal radiomic model, a unimodal pathomic model, and a 
multimodal model combining both feature types. Model performance was evaluated 
using the area under the curve (AUC).
FINDINGS: Our study included 295 AGC patients who received NAC and radical 
surgery between February 2013 and September 2022 (236 in the training cohort, 59 
in the validation cohort). A total of 42 patients (14.2%) achieved pCR. We 
extracted 615 radiomic and 548 pathomic features. The unimodal radiomic model 
(10 selected features) achieved an AUC of 0.672, while the pathomic model (13 
selected features) achieved an AUC of 0.806. The multimodal model, constructed 
with 22 features (12 radiomic, 10 pathomic), achieved the highest AUC of 0.814. 
Decision curve analysis confirmed the multimodal model's superior predictive 
efficacy compared to the unimodal models, highlighting the synergistic potential 
of combining radiomic and pathomic features.
CONCLUSION: By integrating pathological images and CT features, we can maximize 
the utilization of pre-treatment information and enhance the accuracy of NAC 
prediction in AGC.

INTRODUCTION: Accurate prediction of treatment response and prognosis in breast 
cancer patients is critical to advance personalized medicine and optimize 
therapeutic decision-making. Within the context of AI-enabled healthcare, there 
remains a pressing need to develop robust, interpretable models that can account 
for the temporal complexity and heterogeneity inherent in longitudinal patient 
data.
METHODS: This study proposes a novel framework designed to model 
patient-specific treatment trajectories using a dynamics-aware, deep sequence 
learning architecture. Aligned with the core themes of computational prognostics 
and precision therapy, our method addresses the challenges posed by variable 
patient responses, missing clinical records, and complex pharmacological 
interactions. Existing approaches, including conventional supervised learning 
and static classification models, often fall short in capturing the underlying 
temporal dependencies, multimodal data fusion, and counterfactual reasoning 
necessary for real-world clinical deployment. These limitations hinder 
generalizability, especially in scenarios where treatment outcomes are delayed 
or weakly annotated. In contrast, our approach integrates recurrent modeling, 
attention mechanisms, and uncertainty quantification to better capture the 
evolving nature of patient health trajectories. Moreover, we incorporate 
domain-informed regularization techniques and causal inference modules to 
improve interpretability and clinical relevance.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: By learning temporal dynamics in a personalized manner, 
the proposed model enhances predictive performance while remaining sensitive to 
patient-specific variations and therapeutic regimens. Through extensive 
validation on real-world breast cancer cohorts, we demonstrate that our 
framework not only outperforms existing baselines but also provides actionable 
insights that can inform adaptive treatment planning and risk stratification.

Cancer is a complex progressive disease, characterized by uncontrolled cell 
growth, posing a serious global health problem across the population. The 
traditional treatments for this disease include chemotherapy, surgery, and 
radiation therapy, forming the backbone of care. However, over time, tumor cells 
often develop resistance to these treatments, making drug resistance a leading 
factor in disease progression and poor clinical outcomes for some patients. 
Cancer drug resistance is multifaceted at both the molecular and cellular 
levels. An important mechanism through which cancer cells acquire resistance to 
multiple drugs is dysregulated apoptosis (programmed cell death). This 
compromised apoptotic pathway resulted in prolongs cancer cell survival, 
accumulation of mutations that promote angiogenesis, stimulation of cell 
proliferation, impaired differentiation, and enhanced invasiveness during tumor 
progression. In the past few years, plant-derived natural products have garnered 
attention as promising therapeutic agents against drug-resistant cancers due to 
their minimal side effects and potent anticancer properties. However, their 
clinical application faces several challenges, including poor solubility, 
limited absorption, restricted tissue distribution, and rapid metabolism. An 
effective approach to address these limitations involves utilizing nanoparticles 
and nanomaterials, which can improve pharmacokinetics, enhance tumor-specific 
targeting, minimize side effects, and overcome drug resistance. This review 
delves into the fundamental molecular pathways associated with apoptosis and 
explores how phytochemicals and plant extracts, in combination with conventional 
drugs and plant-based nanoparticles can be utilized to treat cancer as well as 
cancer drug resistance by modulating its programmed cell death network.

INTRODUCTION: Early stage breast cancer treated with adjuvant radiotherapy with 
two different techniques, tomotherapy (TOMO) and intensity-modulated radiation 
therapy (IMRT), and their acute adverse events in terms of skin toxicity, 
localized edema, sore throat, tracheal mucositis, nausea, oral mucositis, 
esophagitis, and pneumonitis outcomes are compared.
MATERIALS/METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to compare the 
adverse events of IMRT and TOMO in early stage breast cancer. We reviewed the 
data of female patients who underwent lumpectomy or mastectomy for breast cancer 
at the Oncology Department of the First Affiliated Hospital, Army Medical 
University, from September 2021 to February 2024. A total of 315 female patients 
were enrolled in this study, including 130 and 185 in the TOMO and IMRT groups, 
respectively. In this study, the adverse events in the two groups of patients 
were compared and analyzed.
RESULTS: The median age of the patients in this retrospective cohort was 47 
years (range, 20-74 years). The follow-up period was 3 months. A total of 185 
patients (59%) received IMRT and 130 (41%) underwent TOMO. No significant 
differences were observed in terms of menopausal status, laterality, pathology, 
estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status, triple negative, 
clinical T stage, clinical N stage, or surgical methods. Negative HER-2 
overexpression was found in 38% and 51% of the TOMO and IMRT groups, 
respectively (relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% CI 0.40 -0.99; P = 0.053).With 
regard to the degree of tumor differentiation, poor- moderate differentiation 
was 69% in the TOMO group and 81% in the IMRT group (RR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.31 
-0.89; P = 0.052). In the TOMO and IMRT groups, 66% and 55% of the patients 
received hormone therapy, respectively (RR 1.59; 95% CI 1.00 -2.53; P = 0.5). 
However, there were no statistical differences in the demographic and tumor 
characteristics between the TOMO and IMRT groups. A comparison of adverse events 
between the TOMO and IMRT groups showed no significant differences in localized 
edema, sore throat, tracheal mucositis, nausea, oral mucositis, and the IMRT 
groups. Compared to the IMRT group, the TOMO group had a higher proportion of 
grade 3-4 skin toxicity [16.2% (TOMO) versus 7.6% (IMRT), (RR 2.13; 95% CI 1.04 
-4.37; P = 0.017)]. Pneumonitis was lower in the TOMO group than in the IMRT 
group [0.0% (TOMO) versus 4.3% (IMRT), (RR 1.05; 95% CI 1.01 -1.08; P = 0.016].
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with IMRT, TOMO decreases the incidence of radiation 
pneumonitis but fails to improve acute skin toxicity. Based on our research, 
TOMO may contribute to higher odds of acute skin toxicity, which should be 
considered by clinicians.

OBJECTIVE: To explore whether uric acid (UR), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) 
and uric acid/albumin ratio (UAR) can predict bone metastasis in colorectal 
cancer (CRC).
METHODS: A single-center retrospective study was conducted studying patients 
diagnosed with colorectal cancer attending The First Affiliated Hospital of Xian 
JiaoTong University between January 2016 and December 2021. Patients were 
categorized into groups with and without bone metastasis. Receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis assessed the diagnostic accuracy of CRC bone 
metastases, with subsequent combined ROC curve analysis. Differences among the 
AUCs were calculated and compared by Delong test. Logistic regression analysis 
was utilized to assess the impact of these parameters on CRC bone metastasis.
RESULTS: A total of 156 patients (32%) exhibited bone metastases from CRC. In 
these patients, levels of uric acid (UA), uric acid ratio (UAR), 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), 
carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199), and carbohydrate antigen 724 (CA724) were 
significantly elevated. The diagnostic performance of UA, UAR and NLR is 
surpassed that of traditional colorectal cancer markers. The area under the 
curve (AUC) for the combination UA, UAR and NLR with colorectal cancer tumor 
markers was significantly more effective in predicting bone metastasis (P < 
0.001) compared to the AUC without this combination. Multiple logistic 
regression analysis identified UA, NLR and CEA as independent risk factors for 
bone metastasis in colorectal cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: UA, UAR and NLR serve as valuable makers for predicting bone 
metastases in patients with colorectal cancer. The integration of UA, UAR, NLR, 
CEA, CA199 and CA724 may enhance the prediction of bone metastases in colorectal 
cancer.

BACKGROUND: Lip cancer is a type of oral cancer with a different prognosis than 
that of other cancers. However, a lack of well-established understanding of the 
relationship between the peripheral blood inflammatory biomarker (PBIB) and 
prognosis in patients with lip cancer is evident. This study investigated the 
prognostic value of inflammatory markers and other unfavourable prognostic 
factors. It compares the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), 
neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and 
lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), 
pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV) and prognosis nutritional index (PNI) in 
patients with lip cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 122 patients with lip 
cancer. Clinical characteristics and hematological parameters were 
retrospectively obtained prior to treatment. SII, PLR, NLR, LMR, SIRI, PIV and 
PNI were calculated to analyze their effects on survival and recurrence further.
RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis demonstrated SII 
>534.286, PLR >146.528, NLR >2.134, LMR ≤4.000, SIRI >0.7100, PIV >211.930, PNI 
≤51.900 were factors associated with increased mortality. Univariate analysis 
showed that these inflammatory parameters were associated with a lower survival 
rate. In multivariate analysis, NLR was identified as having a cumulative role 
in predicting overall survival (HR=5.885, 95% CI: 2.131-16.256, P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that NLR is a promising blood biomarker in 
patients with lip cancer. The predictive power of other PBIBs, albeit showing a 
trend towards significance, were not statistically significant, possibly due to 
the limited number of cases. The clinical applicability of other hematological 
indicators requires further study.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: For patients with stage III-IV colorectal cancer (CRC), 
malnutrition and poor prognosis are prevalent; however, the prognostic value of 
the serum creatinine to cystatin C ratio (CCR) in this setting remains 
uncertain. This study aims to investigate the prognostic significance of CCR and 
develop a nutritional prognostic scoring system based on CCR.
METHODS: Restricted cubic splines (RCS) were utilized to investigate the 
relationship between CCR and prognosis. Patients were categorized into high and 
low CCR groups based on RCS cut-off values and divided into quartiles (Q1 to 
Q4). Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves were employed for survival analysis, and 
multivariate Cox regression analyses were identified prognostic factors and to 
construct a tumor nutritional prognostic scoring system for patients. Receiver 
Operating Characteristic (ROC) and area under curve (AUC) were used to evaluate 
the scoring system.
RESULTS: The RCS analysis showed a linear relationship between CCR and prognosis 
(P = 0.76), with lower CCR levels correlating with higher hazard ratios (HR). 
Clinically, patients in the low CCR group exhibited poorer overall survival 
(OS), more advanced stages, and a higher proportion of deficient Mismatch Repair 
status. KM curves revealed that patients with higher CCR levels had better 
prognoses, with the best outcomes in the Q4 group and the worst in the Q1 group. 
After adjusting for confounding biases, TNM stage IV (HR = 2.34, 95% CI: 2.03 - 
2.70), low CCR (HR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.01 - 1.33) and CEA (HR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.13 
- 1.22) were identified as risk factors for prognosis, while Body Mass Index 
(BMI; HR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.96 - 1.00) and albumin (HR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97 - 
1.00) were protective factors. Finally, based on albumin levels, BMI, CEA, and 
CCR levels, a personalized nutritional prognostic scoring system was developed, 
to predict 1, 2, and 3-year OS, demonstrating good accuracy (AUC = 0.73) and 
calibration.
CONCLUSION: CCR levels are closely related to the prognosis of stage III-IV CRC 
patients, with low levels linked to malnutrition and worse outcomes. We 
developed a novel nutritional prognostic scoring system, which holds clinical 
value in predicting outcomes for patients with metastatic CRC.

BACKGROUND: Growing teratoma syndrome (GTS) is a rare condition characterized by 
the enlargement of metastatic masses during or after chemotherapy for malignant 
germ cell tumors (GCTs), despite normalized tumor marker levels. It is defined 
by three criteria: (1) enlarging or new masses during or after chemotherapy, (2) 
normal tumor marker levels, and (3) histological presence of only mature 
teratoma elements. Differentiating GTS from recurrent immature teratoma is 
challenging, as both conditions may present similarly in imaging and tumor 
marker profiles.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 20-year-old woman diagnosed with a 
mixed ovarian GCT, consisting of grade 2 immature teratoma and yolk sac tumor. 
After undergoing right salpingo-oophorectomy and chemotherapy, she remained in 
remission for 4 years. Follow-up imaging revealed enlarged para-aortic lymph 
nodes. Due to normal tumor markers and a lack of response to chemotherapy, the 
condition was initially diagnosed as GTS, prompting surgical resection of the 
lymph nodes. Histopathological analysis, however, revealed immature 
neuroepithelial elements consistent with grade 3 immature teratoma, 
contradicting the GTS diagnosis. The final diagnosis was revised to recurrent 
immature teratoma.
CONCLUSION: This case highlights the diagnostic challenges in distinguishing 
between GTS and recurrent immature teratoma. While normal tumor markers and 
tumor growth following chemotherapy may suggest GTS, histopathological 
confirmation is essential. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion 
for recurrent immature teratoma in cases mimicking GTS and consider surgical 
resection for definitive diagnosis. Multidisciplinary evaluation remains crucial 
in the management of ovarian GCTs.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide. Its 
development and progression are influenced by a combination of genetic and 
environmental factors such as diet. Recent studies highlight the role of dietary 
phytochemicals in the prevention and treatment of CRC. In this review, we 
explore the role of phytochemicals in directly targeting CRC and examine how 
microbiota convert these phytochemicals into bioactive metabolites. These 
metabolites may play a preventive and therapeutic role against CRC through 
cellular, molecular, and epigenetic mechanisms. We emphasize the need for 
additional actions to translate the existing knowledge effectively and safely 
into complementary treatments for CRC patients. The incorporation of 
phytochemical-rich diets represents a viable option in the battle against this 
debilitating condition.

Doxorubicin (DOX), as a potent anti-cancer agent, exerts side effects in vital 
organs. Various chemical compounds with tissue protective properties are used to 
prevent the side effects of DOX. This study was planned to investigate the 
effects of histidine (HIS) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) ​​on DOX-induced acute 
kidney injury. The possible mechanisms were followed by determining the 
histopathological changes of the kidney along with the biochemical alterations 
of the blood and kidney tissue. Forty-eight rats were divided into eight groups 
of six animals each to receive normal saline and DOX after alone and combined 
treatments with HIS and NAC. The DOX at a single dose of 15.00 mg kg-1 was 
intraperitoneally injected on day one. The separate and combined 
intraperitoneally injections of HIS and NAC at a similar dose of 100 mg kg-1 
were began 30 min after DOX administration and continued for seven consecutive 
days. The DOX increased kidney weight and caused congestion, hemorrhages and 
degeneration in kidney tissue. It also increased serum urea and creatinine 
concentrations and kidney tissue levels of malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha and caspase-3, and decreased superoxide dismutase activity in this 
tissue. Separate and combined treatments with HIS and NAC improved all the 
above-mentioned effects of DOX. The restoring effects of the combined treatment 
were more prominent than the effect of amino acids alone. It was concluded that 
anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic mechanisms might be related 
to the tissue protective effects of HIS and NAC against DOX-induced acute renal 
injury.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer (TC) has shown dynamic changes in its global burden 
over the past decades. This study aimed to evaluate trends in incidence, 
mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of TC among middle-aged 
and elderly adults across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021. 
Age-standardized rates (ASRs) of incidence, death, and DALYs, estimated annual 
percentage change (EAPC), and the sociodemographic index (SDI) were used to 
quantify trends. A Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model was employed to 
predict future burden through 2035, and global risk-attributable factors were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Globally, TC incidence cases among adults aged 55 and older increased 
by 185% from 1990 to 2021, with deaths and DALYs rising by 116 and 108%, 
respectively. The age-standardized incidence rate rose significantly 
(EAPC = 0.95), while mortality and DALY rates slightly declined. Most regions 
showed rising incidence, with the exception of Central Europe. Females 
consistently exhibited higher TC burden, but the gender gap is gradually 
narrowing. Peak incidence occurred at ages 70-74 for females and 85-89 for males 
in 2021. High body mass index (BMI) emerged as the leading modifiable risk 
factor.
CONCLUSION: The rising burden of thyroid cancer in aging populations calls for 
integrated health policies emphasizing prevention, early detection, and public 
education. Efforts should focus on reducing modifiable risks, particularly high 
BMI, and developing age- and sex-specific interventions. Addressing gender 
disparities and regional inequalities should also be central to global and 
national cancer control strategies.

Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a serious central nervous system (CNS) infection 
primarily affecting immuno-compromised individuals, including cancer patients. 
Although rare in oncology populations, it may present atypically and pose 
diagnostic challenges. We report two cases of malignancy-associated CM with 
non-classical features. The first involved a male with lung squamous cell 
carcinoma and multiple comorbidities, presenting with mild cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) pleocytosis and normal opening pressure. The second case involved a female 
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and concurrent cryptococcal and purulent 
meningitis, showing marked leukocytosis and elevated CSF pressure. Neither had 
recent antitumor therapy. Despite similar initial symptoms of fever and 
headache, their clinical courses diverged: the male recovered with antifungal 
treatment, while the female had a poor response and discontinued therapy. These 
cases highlight the variable and atypical nature of CM in cancer patients and 
underscore the importance of early recognition and inclusion of fungal 
infections in the differential diagnosis for CNS complications, even in the 
absence of classical features.

BACKGROUND: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a well-accepted treatment 
for metastatic and primary lung cancer; however, an optimal regimen is still 
unclear for ultra central thoracic lesions. The objective of this manuscript is 
to report the toxicity of SBRT in patients with ultra-central tumors treated 
with 50 Gy in 5 fractions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients with 
ultra-central lung lesions treated with SBRT in our institution at the dose of 
50 Gy in 5 fractions, delivered every other day. Lesions were defined as 
ultra-central when the planning target volume (PTV) overlapped the trachea, 
proximal bronchial tree, great vessels, heart and esophagus. Constraints for 
organ at risk (OAR) were the ones used in the RTOG-0813 trial.
RESULTS: 86 patients were included in this review. The median age was 74 years. 
The overlapping OAR were: the great vessels in 46 patients (53.4%), heart in 20 
(23.2%), tracheobronchial tree in 18 (20.9%) and esophagus in 2 (2.3%). Median 
follow up was 17 months. The median overall survival was 39 months. There was no 
SBRT related grade 3 or greater acute or late toxicity.
CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with ultra-central thoracic lesions 
treated with 50 Gy in 5 fraction SBRT, no grade 3-5 acute or late toxicity was 
observed.

BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy (RT) dramatically reduces the risk of prostate cancer 
(PCa) recurrence and extends patient lifespans. Recent studies have begun 
identifying gene signatures and biomarkers that may predict and monitor RT 
responses. Hence, we investigated the effects of radiotherapy (RT) on competing 
endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks, including long non-coding rinonucleic acid 
(lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA), in high-risk prostate 
cancer (HrPCa) patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used to 
identify mRNAs with significant expression differences. The analysis largely 
followed the packages outlined in GEO2R. The TargetScan, miRanda, and 
LncRNA2Target databases were utilized to identify lncRNAs and miRNAs. 
Protein-protein interactions identified hub genes, and Gene Ontology terms 
revealed their critical pathways. Finally, 28 patients with HrPCa and 28 healthy 
subjects were included in the study. Whole blood samples were collected from all 
participants before and after RT. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were then 
performed, followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine 
the expression of candidate biomarkers. Due to the small sample size (n = 28), 
Hedges' g was used instead of Cohen's d to minimize bias.
RESULTS: We identified 3,452 genes, including 1,951 up-regulated and 1,501 
down-regulated genes, exhibiting significant differential expression in patients 
with HrPCa. Ultimately, three lncRNAs, seven miRNAs, and nine mRNAs were 
selected as candidates for comparison between HrPCa patients and healthy 
subjects. Unlike a significant increase in tumor suppressors, the expression 
levels of candidate onco-miRNAs, onco-lncRNAs, and oncogenes in HrPCa patients 
showed a substantial decrease after RT.
CONCLUSIONS: The ceRNA network monitoring might be emerging as a valuable tool 
for assessing treatment responses. However, future studies with larger cohorts 
are needed to validate these results.

BACKGROUND: It is known that 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission 
tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) makes a significant contribution 
to other diagnostic methods in determining the response to treatment after 
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT). The study aimed to determine whether the 
tumor maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) on 18F-FDG PET/CT is 
predictive of overall survival (OS) in patients with rectal cancer after 
neoadjuvant treatment and to investigate whether the rate of change in SUVmax 
has a prognostic value.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 64 rectal cancer 
patients who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging, first for staging and then to 
assess response to neoadjuvant radiotherapy (NRT). SUVmax1 before and SUVmax2 
after treatment were measured from the volume of interest (VOI). To determine 
the predictive value of 18F-FDG PET/CT SUVmax parameters for death, the area 
under the curve (AUC) and cut-off values were calculated using Receiver Operator 
Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate the 
effect of SUVmax cut of value on OS.
RESULTS: Twenty-five (39%) patients were female and 39 (61%) were male. The 
median follow-up period was 37.5 months. The mean SUVmax1 and SUVmax2 values 
were 20.1 ± 9.5 and 7.6 ± 4.8, respectively. OS significantly differed when 8.5 
was used as a cut-off for SUVmax2 (p = 006). 18F-FDG PET/CT metabolic tumor 
parameters had no significant predictive value for progression-free survival 
(PFS).
CONCLUSION: According to the results of our study, SUVmax2 after neoadjuvant 
treatment had a significant predictive value for OS in patients with recurrent 
cancer.

Sciences, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the predictive performance differences for postoperative 
5-year survival risk for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients 
with two image analysis methods based on ground-glass opacity (GGO) status and 
radiomics analysis. Moreover, we improve the accuracy of stratifying survival 
risk by combining radiomics with GGO status.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computed tomography (CT) images for 113 NSCLC patients 
were analyzed. The patients were divided into four groups according to %GGO step 
by 25%. The GGO model was built with the optimal cutoff %GGO value to categorize 
patients into high-risk or low-risk groups. The radiomics features were selected 
by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-Cox regression 
and these were incorporated into the Rad-score model. The combined model was 
created by integrating the GGO and Rad-score models. The survival rates between 
these groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis, supplemented by log-rank 
tests.
RESULTS: From LASSO-Cox regression, 5 features were selected. Multivariate Cox 
regression analysis in the Combined model identified GGO and Rad-score as 
independent predictive factors. The combined model (C-index: 0.664) performed 
best compared to the GGO model (C-index: 0.521) and the rad-score model 
(C-index: 0.642). The 5-year survival Kaplan-Meier curves for the rad-score and 
combined models were also able to stratify the patient population into low-risk 
and high-risk groups (p-values < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: A combined model, integrating the GGO status and Rad-score may help 
predict the prognosis of patients with early NSCLC more accurately, with a 
higher probability of outcome than a GGO model.

BACKGROUND: The quality of volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans depends 
on the planner's expertise. A feasibility dose-volume histogram (FDVH) may help 
reduce planning variability.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study evaluated the impact of two linear 
accelerators - Halcyon and TrueBeam - on FDVH in prostate VMAT planning and 
their effectiveness in reducing doses to organs at risk (OARs). VMAT plans were 
generated for 30 patients with prostate cancer, with planning target volume 
excluding the rectum (PTV-R) and OAR contours created by three planners. An FDVH 
was created, and plans were classified as ""difficult"" (0 < F ≤ 0.1) based on OAR 
dose reduction.
RESULTS: The D98% and D2% of PTV-R were analyzed, showing that TrueBeam had a 
higher mean dose at D98% and a lower mean dose at D2% compared to Halcyon, but 
these differences were not statistically significant (D98%: p = 0.123, D2%: p = 
0.167). For the rectum, TrueBeam resulted in significantly lower doses for all 
dose constraints compared to Halcyon (p < 0.001). In the bladder, TrueBeam 
showed a significantly lower dose at V40Gy (p < 0.001). The upper limits of 
feasible F-values were 0.00-0.12 (TrueBeam) and 0.00-0.17 (Halcyon) for the 
rectum, and 0.01-0.20 (TrueBeam) and 0.00-0.20 (Halcyon) for the bladder, 
depending on dose parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight that the choice of the linear accelerator 
significantly impacts OAR dose reduction. In prostate VMAT, TrueBeam 
demonstrated superior rectal and bladder dose reduction compared to Halcyon, 
underscoring the importance of selecting the appropriate device to optimize 
treatment planning and minimize variability.

BACKGROUND: Patients submitted to breast conservative surgery (BCS) with whole 
breast irradiation at the initial disease that experience an isolated 
ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, face mastectomy, as the standard treatment. 
Selected cases may derive good outcomes from repeat BCS and irradiation with 
partial breast irradiation (PBI) which limits the volume of tissue reducing the 
risk of increased toxicity. We report our experience with external PBI for 
locally recurrent breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We queried our department's re-RT database for breast 
cancer treated with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) from 2017-2021. We 
reviewed the electronic record for each case with PBI. Demographic, disease 
characteristics, primary RT/re-RT details and toxicity were collected. Local 
recurrence-free survival (LR-FS), distant recurrence-free survival (DR-FS) and 
overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: Eleven women were reviewed. Mean (standard deviation; SD) age was 54 
(38-76) years and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 
was 0-1 (100%) with median follow-up from recurrence of 41 months (27-62 
months). All presented T1-2 recurrent lesions. Tumors were clinically node 
negative and no patients had evidence of metastatic disease before undergoing 
BCS. For the re-RT course, all received PBI with 40 Gy/2,67 Gy daily. Cosmesis 
results were good. Eight experienced grade 1 erythema and 2 grade 1 pigmentation 
with 1 pruritus. Major late effects were fibrosis. There were no grade 3 or 
higher late reactions. At 3 years, 9 patients remained free from LR, 10 from DR, 
and 9 were alive.
CONCLUSION: In our cohort, a second BCS followed by re-RT with hypofractionation 
EBRT showed acceptable toxicity and early promising results, though longer 
follow-up is needed.

BACKGROUND: Anemia has a significant clinical impact on cancer patients: it is 
related to an important decline in performance status (PS) and quality of life 
(QoL), with progressive worsening of cognitive function and energy-activity 
levels.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To evaluate the effectiveness of Sucrosomial® oral iron 
formulation to prevent moderate and severe anemia, we retrospectively recorded 
data from our database from February 2023 to December 2023 of patients affected 
by solid tumors, performing long-course radiochemotherapy (RTC) together with 
preventive Sucrosomial® iron supplementation twice per day (Arm A = 35 patients) 
or other supplementations, delivered just as needed (Arm B = 35 patients).
RESULTS: In arm A, at baseline, the median hemoglobin (Hb) value was 12.4 g/dL. 
After 15 days, 30 days and 60 days, median Hb values were, respectively, 12.2 
g/dL, 11.8 g/dL, and 11.6 g/dL. In arm B, at baseline, the median Hb value was 
12.30 g/dL. After 15 days, 30 days and 60 days, Hb values were, respectively, 
11.7 g/dL, 11.2 g/dL, and 11.2 g/dL. Regarding the difference in QoL between the 
two treatment groups, in Arm A a consistent stability in FACT-An questionnaire 
scores was noted. Conversely, in Arm B, a slow but constant increase in FACT-An 
scores was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Sucrosomial® oral iron formulation seems to be efficient in 
preventing moderate and severe anemia during long-course randomized controlled 
trial (RCT) in cancer patients, while also offering notable advantages in terms 
of quality of life and healthcare costs.

Hypofractionation is a radiotherapy regimen that uses fewer fractions with 
higher doses with respect to conventional regimen. It can reduce overall 
treatment time and costs. Preoperative accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy 
(PHYPORT) is a new approach in which radiation therapy is delivered in fewer, 
larger doses over a shorter period of time before surgery and it can be used to 
shrink tumours before surgical removal in some cancers. The choice of 
hypofractionated radiotherapy depends on the type of tumour, its localization 
and total target volume. Also, it is important to assess the potential benefits 
and risks of higher radiation doses. PHYPORT could be a more convenient and 
cost-effective option, but its effectiveness is unclear. This review assesses 
the use of PHYPORT in cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance-guided adaptive stereotactic radiotherapy (MRgRT) 
represents an innovative approach in radiation oncology, combining real-time MR 
imaging with treatment delivery systems. This systematic literature review 
evaluates the efficacy, safety, and technical aspects of MRgRT in prostate 
cancer treatment compared to conventional radiotherapy approaches.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, 
and Scopus databases following PRISMA guidelines. Randomized clinical trials, 
prospective cohort studies, and relevant retrospective studies published through 
2024, evaluating MRgRT in primary or recurrent prostate cancer treatment, were 
included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for randomized 
trials and ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized studies. Data regarding acute and 
late toxicity, biochemical control, and technical aspects of treatment were 
analyzed through qualitative synthesis.
RESULTS: The pivotal MIRAGE randomized trial (n = 156) demonstrated significant 
toxicity reduction in the MRgRT group compared to CT-guided radiotherapy (grade 
≥ 2 GU toxicity: 24.4% vs. 43.4%, p = 0.01; grade ≥ 2 GI toxicity: 0% vs. 10%, p 
= 0.003). MRgRT technology enables safe reduction of clinical target volume 
(CTV)-PTV margins to 2-3 mm. Studies on ultra-hypofractionated regimens 
(including 5-fraction 37.5 Gy and 2-fraction 26 Gy) demonstrated promising 
safety profiles. Implementation of adaptive strategies (ATP and ATS) enables 
dose distribution optimization based on daily patient anatomy.
CONCLUSIONS: MRgRT represents a breakthrough technology in prostate cancer 
radiotherapy, enabling significant reduction in treatment toxicity while 
maintaining high precision in dose delivery. Results of ultra-hypofractionated 
regimens are particularly promising. Further studies are needed to evaluate 
long-term treatment outcomes and cost-effectiveness of this method.

BACKGROUND: Patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer (HDBC) are prescribed 
adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) in the form of tamoxifen or aromatase 
inhibitors (AI), either as single-agent endocrine therapy (SAET) or with a 
switch between them. However, the decision to maintain either strategy remains 
controversial. We aimed to compare breast cancer-free survival (BCFS) and 
overall survival (OS) in Mexican patients with HDBC under AET, be it as SAET or 
switching mode.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 300 patients 
diagnosed between 2009 and 2014. The association of BCFS and OS with clinical 
variables was analyzed with Cox and binary logistic regression models.
RESULTS: In the univariate Cox models, compared to AI-based SAET, only 
tamoxifen-based SAET [hazard ratio (HR): 1.93, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
1.13-3.3] exhibited association with BCFS; this became non-significant in the 
multivariate model. In the multivariate logistic models, compared to AI-based 
SAET, both tamoxifen-based SAET [odds ratio (OR): 2.2, 95% CI: 1.2-4.2] and 
switching (OR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.3--.9) schemes were associated with recurrence or 
death events. Additionally, patients with an AET duration longer than 36 (OR: 
0.18, 95% CI: 0.06-0.54) and 60 (OR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.09-0.75) months had 82% and 
74% lower odds of experiencing recurrence/death, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The data revealed discrepancies between the logistic and Cox 
regression models regarding the administered AET. These findings may reflect 
differences in patient selection, and treatment adherence or duration. The data 
also underscore the relevance of considering AET duration, as extended treatment 
(> 36 and > 60 months) consistently demonstrated protective effects regardless 
of regimen.

We report an 80 year old man in the terminal stage of cancer receiving home 
care. On the 18th day after starting home care, he experienced a sudden onset of 
impaired consciousness, unsteadiness of gait, and ophthalmoplegia. Based on the 
clinical symptoms and a prolonged loss of appetite, Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) 
was suspected. Thiamine 100 mg was administered intravenously, and 20 minutes 
later, the patient responded to verbal stimuli. After 1 h, he was able to engage 
in conversation. When impaired consciousness occurs in cancer patients receiving 
home care, it is important to consider WE as a differential diagnosis.

An elderly man in his 80s receiving home medical care presented with recurrent 
loss of appetite. Although the physical examination was normal, thiamine 
deficiency was suspected based on his history of chronic alcohol use, prior 
unexplained anorexia, and ongoing cancer treatment. Oral thiamine 
supplementation resulted in marked improvement within days. Subsequent testing 
confirmed thiamine deficiency, leading to the diagnosis of gastrointestinal 
beriberi. This case underscores the importance of considering gastrointestinal 
beriberi in patients with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms in the home 
medical care setting, particularly when risk factors for thiamine deficiency are 
present.

A man in his 60s was ultimately diagnosed with a secondary lung abscess caused 
by an esophagorespiratory fistula. On admission, however, he had initially been 
diagnosed with a primary lung abscess because of aspiration, given his history 
of alcohol use. Secondary lung abscesses can result from various underlying 
conditions. Among these, esophagorespiratory fistulas are significant causes and 
are often associated with esophageal cancers. An intriguing aspect of this case 
is that secondary lung abscesses originating from esophageal cancer can occur 
under similar conditions as aspiration-related pulmonary suppuration. Given the 
difficulty in distinguishing between the two based solely on imaging, physicians 
should exercise caution when encountering patients with a history of heavy 
alcohol consumption.

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided hepaticogastrostomy (EUS-HGS) is an effective 
method for cases where transpapillary approaches to pancreato-biliary diseases 
are challenging, though serious complications often occur. Here, we report an 
extremely rare case of delayed biliary hemorrhage due to pseudoaneurysm rupture 
after EUS-HGS, caused by migration of the placed plastic stent. The patient was 
pathologically diagnosed with unresectable advanced pancreatic cancer and 
presented with severe duodenal stenosis and bile duct obstruction. Before 
chemotherapy, EUS-HGS with a biliary plastic stent (7Fr Type IT stent) was 
successfully performed without early complications. However, after 46 days, the 
patient developed massive melena, and computed tomography revealed a biliary 
hemorrhage within the common bile duct. Imaging revealed that the hepatic end of 
the plastic stent had migrated from the hepatic hilum to the posterior segment. 
After 71 days, the patient experienced a recurrent biliary hemorrhage, and an 8 
mm pseudoaneurysm was identified in the posterior hepatic region at a location 
consistent with the migrated hepatic end of the plastic stent. Hemostasis was 
successfully achieved by emergency transcatheter arterial embolization with 
N-butyl cyanoacrylate. During the 6 months after the intervention, no recurrence 
of the pseudoaneurysm was observed, and the patient continued systemic 
chemotherapy with stable disease control. We suggest that biliary hemorrhage due 
to pseudoaneurysm rupture, which may be caused by migration of the placed 
plastic stent, should be considered a life-threatening late complication of 
EUS-HGS, requiring thorough follow-up.

Verona Verona Italy.

OBJECTIVES: There is limited evidence on the diagnostic yield of endoscopic 
ultrasound (EUS)-guided tissue acquisition (TA) using fine-needle biopsy (FNB) 
in autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), particularly considering the newer end-cutting 
needles. The aim of this meta-analysis was to provide a pooled estimate of the 
diagnostic performance of EUS-TA using FNB in AIP patients according to the 
needle type used.
METHODS: A computerized bibliographic search was performed through April 2024. 
Pooled effects were calculated using a random-effects model. The primary 
endpoint was diagnostic accuracy. Secondary outcomes were sample adequacy, rates 
of adequate material for levels 1 and 2 of histological diagnosis, definitive 
diagnosis reached with histology in addition to imaging/laboratory tests, and 
safety.
RESULTS: Twelve studies (three prospective series and one randomized trial) with 
496 patients were included. Overall diagnostic accuracy rate was 75% (66%-83%), 
with a superiority of end-cutting needles over reverse bevel needles (80%, 
70%-90% versus 49%, 21%-67%; p < 0.001). Franseen (81%, 68%-93%) and Fork-tip 
needles (86%, 74%-98%) showed the highest accuracy. Sample adequacy rate was 92% 
(87%-98%), and EUS-TA using FNB provided level 1 of histological diagnosis in 
47% of cases (38%-57%) and level 2 in 23% (16%-30%). EUS-TA using FNB provided a 
definitive diagnosis in 77% (63%-91%) of cases. Pooled rate of adverse event was 
2% (1%-3%), mainly mild pancreatitis.
CONCLUSIONS: End-cutting needles showed high diagnostic yield in patients with 
AIP, with a low rate of adverse events, and should be preferred over reverse 
bevel needles.

BACKGROUND: Using Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 data, we analyzed 
incidence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and risk factors 
for six geriatric digestive system cancers (GDSC) in adults aged ≥60 years from 
1990 to 2021; assessed Socio-demographic Index (SDI) impacts; and projected 
trends to 2050.
METHODS: The joinpoint regression model was used to analyze the age-standardized 
data for temporal trends; the decomposition method was used to assess the 
contributions of population growth, aging, and epidemiological changes; and 
frontier analysis was used to evaluate opportunities for burden reduction across 
countries.
RESULTS: Globally, the incidence of GDSC increased from 1,876,969 
[age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) 405.48/100,000] in 1990 to 3,854,209 
(ASIR 360.89/100,000) in 2021, with a slight decrease in ASIR [-0.57% average 
annual percentage change (AAPC)]. From 1990 to 2021, global GDSC deaths rose to 
2,856,742, but age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) declined to 270.14, with 
an AAPC of -1.72%. Gastric cancer showed the largest decline in incidence 
(-2.21% AAPC), whereas liver cancer increased (0.74% AAPC). Gender disparities 
were evident, with higher rates in males. High-income Asia-Pacific and East Asia 
had the highest ASIR and ASMR. Decomposition analysis showed that population 
growth was the major factor in GDSC burden changes, especially in high-SDI 
regions. By 2050, ASIR and ASMR are expected to continue declining, particularly 
for esophageal and gastric cancers. Major risk factors include smoking, alcohol, 
diet, and metabolic factors such as high body mass index (BMI) and elevated 
fasting glucose.
CONCLUSION: Despite an overall decline in GDSC burden, health disparities 
persist, particularly between high- and low-SDI regions. The study provides 
valuable insights into risk factors and projections for disease burden and 
offers guidance for targeted prevention efforts.

BACKGROUND: Substantial progress has been made in cervical cancer screening and 
HPV vaccination in China. However, evidence on the cost-effectiveness of these 
interventions remains scarce, particularly for combined vaccination and 
screening strategies at the provincial level. To address this gap, we evaluated 
the cost-effectiveness of alternative cervical cancer prevention strategies in a 
southern province of China from the healthcare payer perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to simulate a cohort of 100,000 females 
beginning at age 9 and followed until death (up to 100 years). The model 
compared the outcomes of bivalent, quadrivalent, and 9-valent HPV vaccines 
combined with two screening methods: TCT and HPV testing. Analyses were 
conducted from the healthcare payer perspective, considering only direct medical 
costs. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), discounted 
at 3% annually. Herd immunity effects were not incorporated. Model calibration 
relied on data from the China Health Statistics Yearbook, and sensitivity 
analyses assessed parameter uncertainty. Reporting followed the CHEERS 2024 
guidelines.
RESULTS: Thirteen strategies were evaluated, including no intervention, 
screening alone, and combinations of screening with the three HPV vaccines. The 
combination of HPV testing and the 9-valent vaccine was the most cost-effective, 
with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ¥139.58 per QALY, well 
below the willingness-to-pay threshold. By contrast, TCT combined with the 
9-valent vaccine yielded the highest ICER at ¥193,240.60 per QALY, exceeding the 
threshold. Sensitivity analyses showed ICER estimates were most influenced by 
screening coverage, vaccination uptake, test sensitivity, and the discount rate.
CONCLUSION: Within the current resource and policy context, combining HPV 
testing with the 9-valent vaccine provides the highest economic value. This 
strategy offers evidence to guide future cervical cancer prevention policies in 
southern China.

Saudi Arabia.

BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDS) account for over 70% of global 
mortality. Integrated data on lifestyle and dietary risk factors remain limited 
in the middle east.
OBJECTIVE: To assess associations between sociodemographic, anthropometric, and 
dietary predictors and self-reported NCD status among adults in Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 430 adults in Asir region province (July 
2025) collected data on demographics, BMII, physical activity, and dietary 
intake across 10 food groups. NCDs were defined as physician-diagnosed 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, cancer, or chronic respiratory 
illness. Bivariate associations were evaluated using pearson's χ 2 tests; 
multivariable logistic regression identified independent predictors. IBM SPSS 
v29 was used.
RESULTS: NCD prevalence was 49.3%. Bivariate analysis showed age (p < 0.001), 
female gender (p = 0.045), marital status (p = 0.034), obesity (p < 0.001), and 
occupation (p = 0.004) were significant predictors. Low fruit (p = 0.033), dairy 
(p = 0.002), and grain intake (p = 0.014), and high sugary food intake 
(p = 0.009) were significantly associated with NCDs. Logistic regression 
indicated that female gender (OR = 2.87, 95% CI: 1.02-8.08), low dairy intake 
(OR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.08-0.57), high sugar intake (OR = 0.10, 95% CI: 
0.03-0.33), and smoking (OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.13-0.93) were significant 
independent predictors. Some findings were counterintuitive, warranting cautious 
interpretation.
CONCLUSION: Nearly half of adults had at least one NCD. Modifiable dietary 
factors, notably fruit, dairy, grain, and sugar intake, emerged as key risk 
factors. Tailored dietary interventions are crucial.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to systematically analyze the spatiotemporal 
heterogeneity and drivers of the kidney cancer burden across BRICS member 
countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, 
Indonesia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) from 1990 to 2021. 
Given the significant global rise in kidney cancer incidence, elucidating its 
epidemiological characteristics and influencing factors in countries at 
different stages of economic development is crucial for formulating targeted 
prevention and control strategies.
METHODS: This study innovatively integrated Joinpoint regression and 
Age-Period-Cohort (APC) modeling using data from the Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) 2021 study to quantify trends in kidney cancer incidence and mortality in 
BRICS nations. The APC model was employed to disentangle the independent effects 
of age, period, and birth cohort on the disease burden. These findings were 
subsequently interpreted in the context of national socioeconomic conditions and 
health policies to identify key drivers.
RESULTS: Globally, kidney cancer incidence increased by 142.74% from 1990 to 
2021. Saudi Arabia experienced the most dramatic increase (877.78%), while 
Russia reported the highest Age-Standardized Incidence Rate (ASIR) in 2021 
(10.10 per 100,000). Global mortality rates increased by 108.22%, led by the 
United Arab Emirates (700% growth), with Russia exhibiting the highest 
Age-Standardized Mortality Rate (ASMR) in 2021 (4.07 per 100,000). Furthermore, 
APC analysis identified critical drivers: the age effect peaked in the older 
populations (e.g., Russia's mortality rate reached 42.8 per 100,000 at age 
92.5); the period effect showed a surge in risk after 2000 in most nations 
(Saudi Arabia's period Rate Ratio [RR]: 1.52); the cohort effect indicated a 
6.60-fold elevated risk for China's 2002 birth cohort compared to the 1952 
baseline, contrasting with declining risks in younger Russian cohorts (RR: 
0.66). Regional disparities highlighted interactions between economic 
transitions and health inequities. Specifically, Saudi Arabia's burden was 
associated with metabolic disorders, Russia's decline aligned with tobacco 
control initiatives, and India's rural underdiagnosis reflected critical 
healthcare gaps.
DISCUSSION: The kidney cancer burden in BRICS countries demonstrates significant 
spatiotemporal heterogeneity, driven by mechanisms related to population aging, 
the prevalence of metabolic risk factors, and disparities in healthcare 
accessibility. The findings underscore the necessity of strengthening 
environmental governance, implementing metabolic health interventions, and 
optimizing healthcare resource allocation to advance health equity and achieve 
Sustainable Development Goals. These insights provide a scientific basis for 
developing cross-regional strategies for cancer control.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) progression involves liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS), but its prognostic significance remains unexplored. Using The Cancer 
Genome Atlas transcriptomic data, we developed an LLPS-based risk model that 
outperformed traditional clustering methods. High-risk patients exhibited worse 
outcomes, correlating with higher tumor mutational burden and reduced natural 
killer/T-cell infiltration, yet increased predicted response to immune 
checkpoint blockade. Drug sensitivity analysis suggested therapeutic efficacy of 
Entinostat and 5-fluorouracil in this subgroup. Five pivotal genes (ASXL1, 
DDX21, HNRNPA1L2, TACC3, and TRIM28) were identified as LLPS-driven regulators 
of CRC progression, mechanistically linking phase separation to epigenetic 
dysregulation, aberrant RNA splicing, and metabolic reprogramming. Our study 
provides the first LLPS-associated prognostic framework for CRC, offering both a 
risk stratification tool and actionable therapeutic insights. The findings 
highlight LLPS as a critical molecular organizer in CRC pathogenesis and a 
potential target for precision oncology approaches.

BACKGROUND: Major Facilitator Superfamily Domain-containing 12 (MFSD12) has 
emerged as a critical transmembrane protein with increasingly recognized roles 
in various cancers. The complex pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance of liver 
hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) present significant clinical challenges. This 
study investigates MFSD12's potential involvement in LIHC progression.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed an extensive pan-cancer analysis of MFSD12 
utilizing integrated datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO), and the ArrayExpress database. Our investigation 
focused on evaluating its prognostic significance, clinical implications, 
associated signaling pathways, immune cell infiltration, gene mutations, and 
sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. Through the application of R and various 
online analytical tools, our study demonstrated that MFSD12 expression levels 
were significantly higher in LIHC compared to other cancer types within the TCGA 
pan-cancer dataset. This finding highlights the specificity of MFSD12 expression 
in LIHC, a conclusion further validated by immunohistochemical analysis. 
Survival analysis indicated that this upregulation is associated with 
unfavorable clinical outcomes. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed 
that MFSD12 was predominantly expressed in tumor cells and innate lymphoid cells 
(ILCs) within the tumor microenvironment. Functional vitro studies showed 
MFSD12-siRNA treatment effectively suppressed LIHC cell proliferation, 
migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, MFSD12-siRNA enhanced E-cadherin while 
reducing vimentin, MMP-2, and MMP-9 levels. Further analyses revealed 
significant associations between MFSD12 expression and immune infiltration, 
immune checkpoint molecules, tumor mutation burden, and microsatellite 
instability in LIHC. Notably, MFSD12-siRNA decreased HAVCR2(TIM3) and its ligand 
galectin-9 (LGALS9) expression in LIHC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that MFSD12 upregulation in LIHC strongly 
correlates with poor prognosis. This association was potentially attributed to 
MFSD12's dual roles: promoting tumor cell proliferation, migration, and 
metastasis while critically modulating the tumor immune microenvironment, 
particularly through interaction with the HAVCR2/LGALS9 immune checkpoint axis.

INTRODUCTION: There is potential clinical utility in using patient-reported 
outcomes (PROs) to predict survival in patients with advanced non-small cell 
lung cancer. We assessed the prognostic value of PROs for survival in two phase 
3 cemiplimab studies in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
METHODS: Data from EMPOWER-Lung 1 and EMPOWER-Lung 3 Part 2, two global, 
randomized phase 3 clinical trials, were used. Patients with advanced non-small 
cell lung cancer and programmed cell death-ligand 1 expression ≥50% received 
cemiplimab monotherapy (n=283), and patients with no EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 genomic 
aberrations received cemiplimab plus chemotherapy (n=312). PROs were assessed 
using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core 
Quality of Life and Quality of Life Lung Cancer 13 questionnaires. Association 
between baseline PROs and survival was analyzed, and the C-statistic was used to 
assess the prognostic value of PROs in comparison with the Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) scale.
RESULTS: Twenty-five PROs were evaluated, of which 15 were significantly 
associated (P<0.05) with overall survival and were better predictors than ECOG 
PS. Fourteen PROs were significantly associated (P<0.05) with progression-free 
survival; of these, 13 had better prognostic value than ECOG PS. 
Patient-reported dyspnea and physical functioning had the highest prognostic 
values for overall survival (c=0.635 and c=0.619, respectively) and 
progression-free survival (c=0.593 and c=0.583, respectively). Stratifying 
physical functioning into high, medium, and low categories showed that patients 
with high physical functioning at baseline had significantly better overall 
survival (high vs low; HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.23-0.71; P=0.001), resulting in a 59% 
reduction in the risk of death. Similarly, patients in the high physical 
functioning category had significantly favorable progression-free survival (high 
vs low; HR, 0.44, 95% CI, 0.29-0.66; P<0.001) and a 56% reduction in the risk of 
death.
CONCLUSION: Baseline PROs, including dyspnea and physical functioning, have 
significant prognostic value for survival for patients with advanced non-small 
cell lung cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Peripheral blood inflammatory markers (PBIMs) are widely used for 
prognostication of several malignancies, including gynecologic cancers. However, 
most studies do not report when PBIMs have been sampled, and the ones that do 
usually use pretreatment levels. Considering their potential to reflect the host 
immune status, posttreatment PBIMs and their dynamic changes from pretreatment 
levels may also carry prognostic information. A systematic review and 
meta-analysis were conducted to identify the prognostic value of posttreatment 
PBIMs and their dynamic changes from baseline in gynecologic cancers. 
Furthermore, among the inconsistent blood draw timing and analytical methods, we 
aimed to suggest the most suitable strategies in the clinical setting.
METHODS: Fourteen eligible studies comprising 2,373 patients with cervical, 
ovarian, or endometrial cancer were included. The associations between survival 
outcomes, including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and 
disease-free survival (DFS), and the PBIMs were extracted or estimated. The 
PBIMs included the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), the monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), the 
systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), and the systemic inflammation response 
index (SIRI). Subgroup analyses examined early versus late posttreatment 
sampling, as well as dynamic assessments based on threshold-defined change 
(increase or decrease) versus simple directional change (high or low).
RESULTS: All PBIMs (NLR, PLR, MLR, SII, and SIRI) demonstrated significant 
association with relevant survival endpoints (OS, PFS, and DFS). Early sampling 
of within one month after treatment completion (≤ median 15 days) showed 
prognostic significance (pooled hazard ratios 3.43-3.55; p < 0.0001), whereas 
late sampling demonstrated no significant associations. Dynamic classification 
using specific thresholds yielded more consistent and less heterogeneous 
estimates than directionality-based approaches.
DISCUSSION: This meta-analysis demonstrates the prognostic potential of 
posttreatment PBIMs and their dynamic change from baseline in gynecologic 
cancers. Sampling within one month after therapy was significantly associated 
with prognosis, which may reflect the importance of sampling time in relation to 
the different recovery times by immune cell compartments. However, considering 
the heterogeneity of confounders between studies, the results should be 
interpreted with caution. These findings warrant the need for further studies to 
standardize PBIM assessment in clinical practice.

Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a relatively new, non-thermal ablation 
technology for cancer treatment that requires further investigation to optimize 
its therapeutic efficacy. To improve IRE-ablation, we developed an 
IRE+Combo-treatment regimen that included the Combo adjuvants poly-I:C 
(pIC)/CpG, anti-PD-L1 antibody (PD-L1-Ab) and the 41BB-agonist, and investigated 
its anti-tumor immunity in a 3LLOVA lung cancer model. We demonstrated that 
inclusion of the 41BB-agonist in the IRE+Combo-ablation stimulated a more 
efficient CD8+ T cell response (5.3%) than that observed in the absence of 
41BB-agonist (3.0%) or upon IRE ablation alone (0.4%), leading to eradication of 
subcutaneous 3LLOVA cancer in 75% of 3LLOVA-bearing mice. We further showed that 
the IRE+Combo-treatment regimen resulted in the eradication of both 3LLOVA 
cancer and lung tumor metastases. Interestingly, our flow cytometry analyses 
argued that addition of the 41BB-agonist to the IRE+Combo-ablation stimulated a 
higher frequency of novel CD8+CD103+ conventional type-1 dendritic cells (cDC1) 
(14.4%) in tumor-drainage lymph-nodes (TDLNs) relative to control 
IRE+CpG/pIC/PD-L1-Ab- (7.5%) and IRE- (4.0%) treatment groups. This novel cDC1 
subpopulation exhibited the most robust expression of DC maturation markers and 
costimulatory 41BBL and 41BB of all cDC1 subsets. The 41BB-agonist also 
stimulated a higher frequency of 41BB+CD103+TCF-1+ tissue-resident memory T 
(TRM) cells (14.5%) in TDLNs when compared with the two control (2.6% and 0.3%) 
treatment groups. Importantly, the IRE+Combo-treatment regimen was more 
efficient than the two control groups at converting the immunosuppressive tumor 
microenvironment (TME), an effect that was mitigated by reducing the frequency 
of inhibitory myeloid-derived suppressive cells while increasing that of 
immunogenic cDC1 and CD8+ T cells and rescuing T cell exhaustion. Taken 
together, our data establish that the 41BB-agonist potentiates the efficacy of 
IRE+Combo-therapy for lung cancer treatment by promoting unexpected cDC1 and TRM 
cell responses, and emphasize the importance of targeting this promising 
molecular signal to improve current cancer IRE-ablation protocols.

BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have improved outcomes in 
advanced lung cancer. β-adrenergic signaling may promote tumor initiation and 
progression, and β-blockers (BBs) have emerged as anti-tumor sensitizing agents. 
This study evaluates the impact of BBs use during ICIs treatment in advanced 
lung cancer.
METHODS: This multicenter retrospective real-world study included 462 patients 
treated with ICIs from June 2019 to December 2024. Patients were divided into 
BBs and No BBs groups. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS); efficacy evaluation and objective response rate 
(ORR) were secondary. Propensity score matching (PSM) balances baseline 
characteristics. Kaplan-Meier method, Cox, and logistic regression models were 
used for survival and multivariate analyses. Subgroup analyses assessed clinical 
factors. A P value < 0.05 is considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: After PSM, 318 patients were included (88 BBs, 230 No BBs). BBs use was 
associated with longer median PFS (mPFS) (15.8 vs. 11.8 months; HR = 0.67, 95% 
CI: 0.49-0.92, P = 0.038) and higher ORR (51.1% vs. 35.2%, P = 0.014), but not 
improved median OS (mOS) (29.0 vs. 31.5 months; HR = 1.38, 95% CI: 0.93-2.03, P 
= 0.108). BBs use independently predicted improved ORR (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 
0.26-0.78, P = 0.004) and longer PFS (HR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.49-0.92, P = 0.014). 
In patients with cardiovascular comorbidities (CVD), BBs use was linked to 
longer mPFS (15.8 vs. 10.9 months, P = 0.0066) and higher ORR(51.1% vs 27.0%, 
P<0.001), with no mOS difference (P = 0.82). Among non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) patients, mPFS (17.5 vs. 12.3 months, P = 0.04) and ORR (56.0% vs 35.9%, 
P = 0.004) were also improved in the BBs group, whereas OS did not differ 
significantly (P = 0.3).
CONCLUSION: In stage-advanced lung cancer, BBs combined with ICIs were 
associated with improved ORR and prolonged PFS, but did not significantly 
improve OS. PFS and ORR benefits were also observed in patients with CVD or 
NSCLC. Further prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and 
clarify whether BBs directly contribute to ICIs' efficacy.

BACKGROUND: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G has multiple isoforms with unique 
molecular structures and receptor-binding specificities. Different HLA-G 
isoform(s) may have distinct clinical relevance. Because of the lack of 
isoform-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), the clinical significance of 
HLA-G isoforms (HLA-G1 to HLA-G7), except HLA-G1 and HLA-G5, remains largely 
unknown.
METHODS: In this study, mAbs against HLA-G2/6 and HLA-G1/4/5 isoforms were 
generated and characterized. Expression of HLA-G2/6 and HLA-G1/4/5 isoforms was 
analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and clinical significance was evaluated 
retrospectively in 345 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).
RESULTS: The expression rate of HLA-G2/6 (90/345, 26.1%) was significantly lower 
than that of HLA-G1/4/5 (275/345, 79.7%; p < 0.001). Patients with HLA-G2/6 
expression had significantly poorer overall survival (OS) (median OS: 6.3 years 
[95% CI: 4.1-8.5] vs. 10.0 years [95% CI: 7.6-12.4]; p = 0.008). Multivariate 
Cox proportional-hazard model results indicated that HLA-G2/6 was an independent 
prognostic factor for CRC (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.530, 95% CI: 1.125-2.081; p = 
0.007). Moreover, HLA-G2/6 expression showed stratified prognostic significance 
among several CRC patient subgroups, specifically in female patients (p = 
0.003), younger patients (<66 years p < 0.001), patients with colon cancer (p = 
0.045), those at stage pT3 (p = 0.008), pN1 (p = 0.020), pM0 (p = 0.009), and 
AJCC stage III (p = 0.005). However, no statistical significance was found 
between HLA-G1/4/5 isoform expression and patient prognosis in CRC.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to generate mAbs for the HLA-G2/6 and 
HLA-G1/4/5 isoforms. Our findings reveal that HLA-G2/6-but not 
HLA-G1/4/5-expression is an independent prognostic indicator for patients with 
CRC. In the context of precision medicine, our study also suggests that HLA-G 
isoform typing may be necessary for HLA-G-targeted cancer immunotherapy.

INTRODUCTION: People with HIV (PWH) on effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
have an increased risk of developing Non-AIDS Defining Cancers (NADCs) compared 
to the general population, partly due to chronic inflammation and immune 
dysregulation. This study aimed to identify plasma biomarkers associated with 
the risk of developing NADCs in a cohort of PWH on ART.
METHODS: A case-cohort study was conducted within the Spanish CoRIS cohort, 
including 316 PWH on ART (71 cases and 245-individuals subcohort). Plasma levels 
of 24 immune regulation and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) 
biomarkers were quantified using Luminex technology. Cox proportional hazards 
regression models with Borgan II weights were used to assess the association 
between biomarker levels and the risk of NADC development (hazard ratios), 
adjusting for confounders. Effect modification by gender was also evaluated.
RESULTS: Higher baseline plasma levels of twelve biomarkers were significantly 
associated with increased NADC risk. The strongest associations were found for 
PD-L2 (aHR=3.33), PAI-1 (aHR=2.27), and MMP-1 (aHR=2.32). However, a distinct, 
gender-specific pattern was observed, with significant interactions found for 
nine biomarkers. Most interactions indicated a higher NADC risk increase in 
females, with the exception of CD80, TNF-β and IP-10, which indicated a 
relatively lower risk in females compared to males.
DISCUSSION: Plasma biomarkers of immune regulation and SASP are associated with 
NADC risk in PWH on long-term ART, highlighting the importance of 
gender-specific pathways in NADC development among PWH. Understanding these 
distinct profiles may guide future strategies for risk stratification, early 
detection, and personalized preventive care.

CD8+ T cells play a pivotal role in antiviral and antitumor immunity, yet under 
chronic antigen stimulation, they progressively enter a functionally impaired 
""exhausted"" state, characterized by loss of effector functions, sustained high 
expression of inhibitory receptors, and a distinct transcriptional and 
epigenetic landscape. Recent studies have highlighted that epigenetic regulation 
is central to the initiation and maintenance of CD8+ T cell exhaustion. 
Exhausted T cells exhibit chromatin landscapes markedly different from those of 
effector and memory T cells, displaying an ""epigenetic locking"" that renders 
their phenotype largely irreversible. Emerging evidence highlights the central 
role of epigenetic and transcriptional regulation in driving and maintaining 
CD8+ T cell exhaustion. DNA methylation and histone modifications establish 
stable repressive chromatin landscapes that suppress effector gene programs. 
Non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, fine-tune 
exhaustion-associated pathways post-transcriptionally, while RNA epigenetic 
modifications, such as m6A methylation, regulate transcript stability and 
translation in exhausted T cells. Transcription factors orchestrate these 
epigenetic and post-transcriptional networks, reinforcing exhaustion-specific 
gene expression profiles. Together, these interconnected mechanisms not only 
define the exhausted phenotype but also contribute to tumor immune evasion and 
therapeutic resistance. Understanding these processes provides a framework for 
novel strategies aimed at reversing CD8+ T cell exhaustion and improving the 
efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Collectively, elucidating the epigenetic 
mechanisms underlying CD8+ T cell exhaustion not only deepens our understanding 
of its molecular basis but also provides new avenues for precision immunotherapy 
and individualized interventions.

PURPOSE: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard for early breast 
cancer, but its necessity in small tumors with clinically node-negative (cN0) 
status remains debated. This study evaluated the incidence of lymph node 
metastasis in cN0 patients to explore the feasibility of omitting axillary 
surgery.
METHODS: A cohort of 579 women with unilateral small breast cancer and cN0 were 
enrolled from three hospitals in Jiangsu Province (March 2023-June 2024). 
Clinical nodal status was determined by ultrasonography, while pathology and 
immunohistochemistry assessed tumor size, node status, and molecular subtypes. 
Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used for analysis.
RESULTS: Lymph node metastasis was detected in 79 patients (13.64%). Tumors ≤20 
mm and Ki-67 ≤14% showed significantly lower metastasis rates (P < 0.0001 and P 
= 0.013, respectively). Even in cN0 patients with both favorable factors, 6.15% 
still had nodal involvement. Logistic regression identified tumor size (T2) as 
an independent predictor of metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Small breast cancer with cN0 and low Ki-67 expression is associated 
with reduced but non-negligible nodal metastasis. These findings support caution 
in omitting axillary surgery and highlight the need for individualized risk 
stratification rather than universal omission.

OBJECTIVE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) combined with chemotherapy have 
shown significant survival benefits in advanced squamous non-small-cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), as confirmed by clinical guidelines. However, the high cost of 
ICIs imposes a substantial economic burden on patients. An economic evaluation 
of various ICIs plus chemotherapy regimens is urgently needed. This study 
assessed the cost-effectiveness of several regimens for advanced squamous NSCLC 
from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system.
METHODS: A network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to compare the efficacy of 
different ICIs plus chemotherapy regimens. The key outcomes, including hazard 
ratios for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), were 
extracted from clinical trials. A cost-utility analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Data from six clinical trials involving 2,548 patients were analyzed. 
The camrelizumab plus chemotherapy and penpulimab plus chemotherapy regimens 
showed the greatest OS benefit, while camrelizumab plus chemotherapy provided 
the best PFS benefit. The tislelizumab plus chemotherapy regimen incurred the 
lowest treatment cost ($42,882.3), with an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) 
of $ 4,062.0 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The camrelizumab plus 
chemotherapy regimen offered the highest survival benefit (2.344 QALYs), with an 
ICUR of $ 6,078.4/QALY. In addition, the ICUR of the penpulimab plus 
chemotherapy regimen is $25,712.3/QALY. The ICURs of three other ICI plus 
chemotherapy regimens were higher than the willingness-to-pay threshold.
CONCLUSION: Among the six ICI plus chemotherapy regimens evaluated, tislelizumab 
plus chemotherapy demonstrated the lowest ICUR, followed by the camrelizumab 
plus chemotherapy regimen. However, with a threshold of $13,445/QALY or 
$40,334/QALY, camrelizumab plus chemotherapy provided greater QALY benefits than 
tislelizumab plus chemotherapy. Thus, camrelizumab plus chemotherapy is 
recommended as the preferred first-line treatment for advanced squamous 
non-small-cell lung cancer in this context.

As pivotal medicinal resources in the Gentiana genus (Gentianaceae), Gentianae 
Radix et Rhizoma exhibit remarkable chemical diversity and multi-target 
pharmacological activities. This review highlights G. scabra Bunge., Gentiana 
rhodantha Franch., Gentiana manshurica Kitag., Gentiana veitchiorum Hemsl., and 
other species, compiling 172 constituents from literature (2004-2024) and 
traditional sources: terpenoids (66 iridoids, 47 triterpenoids, and others), 
flavonoids, lignans, and alkaloids. Iridoids (e.g., gentiopicroside, 
swertiamarin) and triterpenoids are key bioactive agents. Pharmaco-logically, 
Gentiana extracts target NF-κB and MAPK pathways to suppress in-flammation and 
oxidative liver injury via Nrf2 activation, while inducing tumor cell apoptosis 
(Bax/Bcl-2) and S/G2-M phase arrest to inhibit lung/liver cancer proliferation. 
They enhance gastrointestinal repair, regulate motility, and mitigate chronic 
pain through central-peripheral analgesic synergy. Clinically, gentiopicroside 
demonstrates hepatoprotective, antiviral, and neuroprotective effects, with 
applications in herpes zoster, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and metabolic 
disorders. This review represents the first comprehensive integration of 
multidimensional chemi-cal-pharmacological-clinical data on Gentianae Radix et 
Rhizoma constituents, aiming to promote the expanded application of Gentianae 
Radix et Rhizoma in the pharma-ceutical field, provide a scientific basis for 
further development and utilization, and lay a foundation for subsequent 
research and industrial development.

INTRODUCTION: Surgical management of patients with peritoneal surface 
malignancies (PSM) via multivisceral resection is associated with increased 
morbidity and mortality in the immediate postoperative period, rendering 
intensive care therapy critically important. We aimed to determine whether 
intensive care unit (ICU) course and scoring systems predict not only short-term 
but also long-term outcomes.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of all patients who 
underwent cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal 
chemotherapy (HIPEC) for peritoneal surface malignancies (PSM) between 2008 and 
2015 at a university cancer center. Upon postoperative ICU admission, Simplified 
Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) 
scores were recorded. Complications during the ICU stay and overall 
hospitalization were documented, and patients were followed according to a 
standardized protocol after discharge.
RESULTS: A total of 251 patients were included. The mean Peritoneal Cancer Index 
(PCI) was 14 ± 9.1 and correlated significantly with both ICU stay duration 
(p = 0.002) and total hospital stay (p = 0.001). In-hospital mortality was 2%, 
and the reoperation rate was 16.7%. SOFA scores on the day of surgery, 
postoperative days 1, 2, and 7 demonstrated strong correlations with ICU length 
of stay (all p ≤ 0.001) and with overall hospital stay (p = 0.001 for the day of 
surgery and day 7; p ≤ 0.001 for days 1 and 2). In multivariate analysis, SOFA 
score on postoperative day 7 [hazard ratio (HR) 1.261; 95% confidence interval 
(CI) 1.120-1.421; p ≤ 0.001] and SAPS II on the day of surgery (HR 1.042; 95% CI 
1.017-1.068; p ≤ 0.001) emerged as independent predictors of overall survival.
DISCUSSION: In conclusion, SAPS II and SOFA scores not only predict ICU and 
hospital lengths of stay but also independently forecast overall survival in 
patients undergoing CRS and HIPEC for PSM.

University, Heilongjiang, China.

OBJECTIVE: The importance and value of continuous care for patients after ileal 
cystostomy is established, and relevant experience to provide references for 
clinical practice is summarized in this study.
METHODS: This study was conducted at the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Harbin 
Medical University, China, from July 2020 to July 2022. A total of 40 subjects 
were divided into a routine nursing group, which received routine perioperative 
health education, and stoma nursing was given at the bedside after the operation 
and followed up within one week after discharge, and a continuous nursing group, 
which was given continuous nursing based on routine nursing measures. The two 
groups' quality of life (QoL), stoma complications, Patient satisfaction, 
gastrointestinal function, and other indicators were evaluated.
RESULTS: All the scores linked to the QoL in the continuous nursing group were 
markedly better than that in the routine nursing group, and the divergence was 
statistically notable. The continuous nursing group had fewer stoma 
complications, higher Patient satisfaction, and better gastrointestinal 
function.
CONCLUSION: Continuous nursing can markedly enhance patients' QoL, lessen 
complications, and enhance patients' satisfaction and gastrointestinal function. 
It has significant value and practical importance.

BACKGROUND: Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) 
is involved in canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling and is a marker of stem cells 
in several tissues. It plays an important role in self-renewal, metastasis, and 
chemoresistance of tumors. The plasticity and potential of LGR5 (+) cancer stem 
cells could provide therapeutic targets for cancer. However, the data in this 
field is very limited and requires further investigation.
METHODS: This study aimed to explore the status and evolutionary trends of LGR5 
research using bibliometric analysis. In total, 2,187 publications were 
retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. The period covered by the 
articles was from 1999 to 2023. CiteSpace, VOSviewer, R software, and 
Bibliometric Online Analysis Platform were used for bibliometric analysis and 
visualization.
RESULTS: The USA was the most productive country, with the highest centrality 
and largest single-country publications. The Netherlands was the earliest 
country to conduct LGR5 research. Cleavers, H from the Hubrecht Institute (KNAW) 
of the Netherlands was the most influential author as measured by H, G, and 
M-index values and contributions to the number of publications and citations. 
Intestinal stem cells were a hot topic, while keywords ""LGR5 (+) stem cells,"" 
""inflammation,"" and ""tumor microenvironment"" exhibited the strongest burst in 
recent years, indicating a significant research focus in the future. 
Additionally, targeting LGR5 (+) stem cells in a specific phase of cancer and in 
combination with tumor microenvironment (TME) combination could be a future 
hotspot.
CONCLUSION: Research on LGR5 continues to develop through active global efforts. 
This study offers a comprehensive analysis of LGR5 using bibliometric and visual 
methods, highlighting current research hotspots and potential directions for 
researchers interested in the field.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocarcinoma (HCC) is the primary form of liver cancer, which is 
a highly prevalent cancer associated with an increased rate of mortality 
worldwide. The plant Salvadora persica (miswak) has been reported for its 
cytotoxic effect in various cancer cell lines. The purpose of the current 
research study was to assess the cytotoxicity and apoptosis-inducing capability 
of Salvadora persica aqueous extract from the root part (miswak sticks) on human 
HCC HepG2 cells and to evaluate its safety in human normal hepatic THLE-2 cells 
in a dose-dependent manner.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The preparation of aqueous extract from the root part of 
Salvadora persica was carried out using a maceration extraction process. The 
effect on cytotoxicity and cellular proliferation in HepG2 cells and THLE-2 
cells at 10, 50, 100, 150, and 200 µg/mL concentrations after 24, 48, and 72 
hours was determined using the MTT 
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. In further 
experiments, IC50 (24 hours) was 65.8 µg/mL, and increasing concentrations were 
employed: 115 µg/mL (twofold) and 165 µg/mL (threefold). The apoptosis at the 
quantitative level was evaluated using a flow cytometry assay by the Annexin 
V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit in HepG2 cells and THLE-2 cells. The 
expression levels of the proapoptotic proteins Annexin V and p53 in the HepG2 
cell line were assessed using an immunocytochemistry assay. The mRNA levels of 
apoptosis markers, caspase 9, caspase 3, cytochrome c, BAX, and p53, and the 
antiapoptotic marker, Bcl-2, in the HepG2 cell line were determined using the 
RT-qPCR (real-time, quantitative-polymerase chain reaction) assay.
RESULTS:  Salvadora persica aqueous extract demonstrated time-dependent and 
dose-dependent growth inhibitory effect and cytotoxicity in the HepG2 cell line 
in the MTT test. The IC50 values were 65.8 µg/mL at 24 hours, 51.4 µg/mL at 48 
hours, and 30.3 µg/mL at 72 hours. In contrast, a non-toxic effect was observed 
in the THLE-2 cell line. The flow cytometry results indicated a significantly 
enhanced apoptotic effect, characterized by increased early apoptosis, late 
apoptosis, and cell death in HepG2 cells. In contrast, the normal THLE-2 cell 
line showed insignificant apoptotic cell numbers. In the immunostaining assay, a 
pronounced elevation in the expression levels of proapoptotic proteins, 
including p53 and Annexin V, was observed. The RT-qPCR assay revealed an 
increase in the fold change of caspase 9, caspase 3, cytochrome c, BAX, and p53 
mRNA levels, along with a decrease in Bcl-2 mRNA levels. Salvadora persica 
aqueous extract induced apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway in the HepG2 cell 
line. Salvadora persica aqueous extract exhibited the most significant apoptotic 
effect in HepG2 cells at high concentrations.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, Salvadora persica aqueous extract 
demonstrated dose-dependent antitumor potential in the HCC cell line HepG2 
through the induction of intrinsic apoptosis and showed non-toxic activity in 
the normal hepatic THLE-2 cell line, emphasizing its therapeutic efficacy in HCC 
treatment.

A noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features 
(NIFTP) is a recently reclassified thyroid tumor characterized by low malignant 
potential and typically confined to the thyroid gland. Its occurrence in a 
thyroglossal duct remnant is exceedingly rare, with only a few cases reported. 
Herein, we describe the case of a 74-year-old man who presented with a painless, 
progressively enlarging midline anterior neck mass. Ultrasonography and 
contrast-enhanced computed tomography demonstrated a well-circumscribed cystic 
lesion along the thyroglossal duct tract. Fine-needle aspiration cytology 
revealed a follicular-patterned lesion, consistent with Bethesda category IV. 
The patient subsequently underwent surgical excision via the Sistrunk procedure. 
Histopathological examination showed a completely encapsulated follicular lesion 
with papillary-like nuclear features, without true papillae, capsular, or 
vascular invasion, thereby confirming the diagnosis of NIFTP arising in ectopic 
thyroid tissue. Given the absence of invasive features, no additional therapy 
was required, and no recurrence was observed at the six-month follow-up. This 
case highlights the diagnostic limitations of preoperative cytology in ectopic 
thyroid lesions and underscores the importance of complete surgical excision 
when malignancy cannot be definitively excluded.

Nuclear protein in testis (NUT) carcinoma is a rare and aggressive malignancy 
characterized by NUT gene rearrangement. Previously classified as NUT midline 
carcinoma, this malignancy was reclassified to NUT carcinoma in order to reflect 
that it can occur outside midline structures of the body. This case report 
follows a 43-year-old male presenting with a nasopharyngeal mass invading the 
frontal brain region, ultimately diagnosed as NUT carcinoma. Here, we detail the 
clinical and molecular characteristics of this tumor to contribute to the 
growing body of literature on this rare malignancy, while acknowledging 
potential diagnostic challenges and therapeutic considerations.

Primary malignant mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare malignancy that arises from the 
epithelial cells that line visceral cavities. The primary pleural presentation 
is known as the most commonly seen presentation and is best recognized 
clinically. Less commonly, mesothelioma can arise from epithelial cells lining 
other visceral cavities, including the peritoneum and pericardium. Primary 
peritoneal presentations are often difficult to diagnose due to vague symptoms 
such as abdominal distention, anorexia, and diffuse pain. These symptoms overlap 
with those of many more common gastrointestinal conditions, often leading to 
delayed diagnosis. We report a male in his 40s with a past medical history of 
hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 who presented to the emergency room 
with non-specific abdominal complaints. He had a history of longstanding work on 
demolition sites. Treatment was initiated following studies that tested positive 
for H. pylori infection. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed nodular fat stranding 
of the omentum, with several confluent peritoneal nodules and small-volume 
ascites. An omental biopsy showed tumor cells positive for markers indicative of 
epithelioid-type malignant mesothelioma, with the peritoneum identified as the 
primary site. A key piece of this patient's case was long-standing exposure to 
demolition sites and asbestos. Asbestos exposure is a well-documented risk 
factor for the development of mesothelioma. This history was obtained but did 
not aid in guiding diagnostic practices due to overlapping symptomatology. The 
discovery of an H. pylori infection may have delayed the diagnosis of primary 
malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (PMPM) and its appropriate treatment, as H. 
pylori is a much more common condition.

Background With global population aging, breast cancer is increasingly diagnosed 
in older adults, and individuals aged 70 years and above now account for over 
30% of new cases. Standard treatments, including surgery, radiation, endocrine 
therapy, and chemotherapy, are effective in reducing recurrence and improving 
survival. However, older patients remain underrepresented in clinical trials, 
resulting in limited evidence specific to this population. In clinical practice, 
de-escalated adjuvant therapies are often employed in older patients, but their 
prognostic impact remains uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate recurrence 
outcomes according to treatment intensity in elderly breast cancer patients. 
Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 399 breast cancer patients 
aged ≥70 years who underwent surgery at Kobe City Medical Center General 
Hospital between July 2011 and March 2023. Patients were classified as receiving 
either standard or de-escalated adjuvant therapy, with standard therapy defined 
according to the 2022 Japanese Breast Cancer Clinical Practice Guidelines. 
Clinical data, including comorbidities, stage, and tumor subtype, were 
collected. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was assessed using Cox proportional 
hazards models, adjusting for clinical covariates. Multiple imputation was 
performed to address missing data. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age, 
stage, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 
2 (HER2) status. Results The cohort included 399 patients (median age: 75 years) 
with a median follow-up of 56 months (interquartile range: 27-89). Only five 
recurrences (1.3%) were observed. In the unadjusted analysis, the median RFS was 
46 months in the standard treatment group and 62 months in the de-escalation 
group. After adjustment with multiple imputation, the median RFS was not reached 
in either group. The hazard ratio for recurrence in the standard versus 
de-escalation group was 0.094 in the unadjusted analysis and 1.51 after 
adjustment. Notable differences were observed between groups with respect to 
comorbidities, disease stage, and tumor subtype. Conclusions De-escalated 
adjuvant therapy may be an appropriate option for selected elderly breast cancer 
patients, particularly those with favorable disease profiles. The very low 
recurrence rate observed in this cohort supports individualized treatment 
strategies that balance efficacy with tolerability. Prospective studies are 
warranted to confirm these findings and to inform evidence-based decision-making 
in geriatric oncology.

Intussusception is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction in adults, which can 
present as a complete or partial obstruction. We present the case of a patient 
who is admitted with abdominal pain in the epigastrium and right hypochondrium, 
accompanied by weight loss and melanic evacuations. The computed tomography (CT) 
scan found no adequate passage of oral contrast, and the site of the leading 
point of intussusception was in the ascending colon. The colonoscopy located a 
tumor covering approximately 90% of the intestinal lumen. A right hemicolectomy 
with ileo-transverse lateral-lateral anastomosis was performed, and the 
pathological report of the surgical specimen reported an infiltrating 
adenocarcinoma. This case report is significant for the clinical decision-making 
process it exemplifies.

INTRODUCTION: Autoimmune neutropenia (AIN) is a rare disease that causes 
neutropenia due to autoantibodies directed against neutrophils. Neutropenia is 
associated with an increased risk of infection, such as surgical site infection 
or febrile neutropenia. To our knowledge, however, there are few reports of 
surgical or neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic treatments for colorectal cancer with 
AIN. Herein, we present a case with AIN undergoing multidisciplinary treatment 
of cecal cancer and metachronous liver metastases.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 74-year-old woman with AIN presented to our hospital with 
epigastric pain lasting for 3 weeks. Abdominal CT showed obstructive cecal 
cancer and swollen regional lymph nodes. She had been under observation for 
primary AIN in the hematology department in our institution. The blood test 
revealed white blood cell count of 2300/μL, neutrophil count of 19.4%, and thus 
absolute neutrophil count of 446/μL. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor 
(G-CSF; filgrastim 75 μg) was administered to lower the risk of infectious 
complications before surgery. After the absolute neutrophil count levels 
increased sufficiently, laparoscopic ileocecal resection was performed. 
Pathological findings showed T3N1aM0, pStage IIIB (UICC 8th edition), HER2 score 
0, and a RAS codon 12S mutation. Six months after curative surgery, multiple 
liver metastases appeared. A total of 8 cycles of mFOLFOX6 with bevacizumab, 
combined with G-CSF (filgrastim 75 μg) were administered. After preoperative 
chemotherapy, the patient underwent right anterior sectionectomy and partial 
resection of segment 6. She was uneventful in the postoperative course. 
Throughout the perioperative period and chemotherapy, no infectious 
complications were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The administration of G-CSF to prevent neutropenia allowed the 
patient with AIN to safely undergo multidisciplinary treatment.

This report details the urgent management of a life-threatening aortobronchial 
fistula (ABF) in a 61-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer surgery, 
who presented with massive hemoptysis, underscoring the critical role of rapid 
diagnosis and endovascular intervention in this rare vascular complication. 
Emergency digital subtraction angiography (DSA) confirmed the ABF, prompting 
immediate thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) with successful deployment 
of a stent graft, which achieved complete hemostasis, restored aortic integrity, 
and resulted in an uncomplicated postoperative course without recurrent 
bleeding. The case reinforces TEVAR as a minimally invasive and definitive 
therapeutic strategy for ABF, particularly in high-risk surgical candidates, 
while highlighting the indispensable role of angiographic imaging in acute 
settings and the need for heightened clinical suspicion in patients with prior 
thoracic interventions to avert catastrophic outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to utilize internet big data to quantify the taste 
preferences of residents in Fujian Province and to explore the relationship 
between dietary taste preferences and hospitalization rates for digestive system 
cancers.
DESIGN: The study employed an associative design using internet big data to 
analyze dietary behavior and its association with hospitalization rates for 
digestive system cancers. Geodetector methods were used to compare the 
association between rural residents' hospitalization rates and their taste 
preferences.
SETTING: This study utilized internet recipe data to collect cuisines taste 
information. By integrating this with categorized restaurant data from point of 
interest sources across various regions in Fujian province, it quantitatively 
analyzed the regional taste preferences of people.
PARTICIPANTS: Data from 72 counties in Fujian, covering most of the province. 
Included 154,686 hospitalization records for digestive system cancers 
(2010-2016) from the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme(NRCMS) database, 
16,363 recipes from Internet and data from 30,984 restaurants through Amap.
RESULTS: The study found pungent to be the prevalent taste in Fujian, with 
salty, spicy, and sour following. Coastal areas favored stronger tastes. Spatial 
analysis showed taste preferences clustered geographically, with Sour and Fat 
tastes having an association with liver and colorectal cancer hospitalizations, 
though with modest association values (0.110-0.199).
CONCLUSIONS: The study found significant spatial clustering of taste preferences 
in Fujian Province and an association between Sour and Fat tastes preference and 
hospitalization rates for liver and colorectal cancers, suggesting a dietary 
taste-cancer link.

BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors face ongoing health challenges that can reduce work 
capacity, yet the economic impact of workplace productivity losses remains 
underexamined. We aim to estimate This study estimated workplace productivity 
losses, specifically absenteeism and presenteeism, among Australian cancer 
survivors and quantified associated wage costs.
METHODS: We analyzed four waves (2009-2021) of the Household, Income and Labor 
Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, including adults aged ≥15 years in the 
labor force reporting cancer, non-cancer serious illness, or no serious illness. 
Absenteeism (annual days off work) was modeled using zero-inflated Poisson 
regression, and presenteeism (self-reported reduced work performance) using 
logistic regression, adjusting for sociodemographic, health, and employment 
factors. Sensitivity analyses explored alternative absenteeism definitions.
RESULTS: Cancer survivors had a 33% higher rate of absenteeism (IRR: 1.33; 95% 
CI: 1.31-1.35, p-value < 0.001) and approximately double the odds of 
presenteeism (aOR = 2.04; 95% CI: 1.71-2.43; p-value < 0.001) compared with 
individuals without serious illness. Estimated average annual 
absenteeism-related wage loss was AU$1425.45, predominantly among working-age 
adults (25-64 years).
CONCLUSION: Cancer imposes substantial workplace productivity losses with 
significant economic implications. Findings support the development of 
evidence-based workplace policies and targeted occupational health interventions 
to sustain employment and reduce economic burden among cancer survivors.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is now the most common malignancy in women. Early 
detection and precise diagnosis are essential for improving survival.
OBJECTIVES: To develop an integrated computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that 
automatically detects, segments and classifies lesions in mammographic images, 
thereby aiding BC diagnosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We adopted YOLOv5 as the object-detection backbone and 
used the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of the Digital Database for Screening 
Mammography (CBIS-DDSM). Data augmentation (random rotations, crops and flips) 
increased the dataset to 5,801 images, which were randomly split into training, 
validation and test sets (7 : 2 : 1). Lesion-classification performance was 
evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
(AUC), precision, recall, and mean average precision at a 0.5 confidence 
threshold (mAP@0.5).
RESULTS: The CAD system yielded an mAP@0.5 of 0.417 and an F1-score of 0.46 for 
lesion detection, achieved an AUC of 0.90 for distinguishing benign from 
malignant lesions, and processed images at 65 fps.
CONCLUSIONS: The integrated CAD system combines rapid detection and 
classification with high accuracy, underscoring its strong clinical value.

The integration of genomic tests such as the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence 
Score® test, into routine clinical practice represents a significant advance in 
personalized breast cancer care. By supporting more tailored therapeutic 
decisions, these diagnostics can improve patient outcomes, while reducing risks 
of undertreatment, overtreatment, and associated side effects. 
Cost-effectiveness has already been demonstrated in numerous publications. 
However, for widespread adoption across Europe, four principal challenges must 
be overcome: regulation, technology assessment, reimbursement, and gaps in 
real-world evidence. Since May 2022, the European Union In Vitro Diagnostics 
Regulation (IVDR) has updated requirements for demonstrating clinical utility 
and analytical and scientific validity, creating new barriers for manufacturers 
regarding primary evidence generation. Variability in health technology 
assessment (HTA) frameworks and reimbursement mechanisms across countries 
further complicates adoption. Demonstrating real-world benefits of these 
technologies requires robust, representative data collections, yet current 
clinical trial evidence often underrepresents certain patient populations, 
raising equity concerns. Whilst the IVDR will help standardize regulatory 
requirements, challenges remain in harmonizing evidence standards for HTA and 
reimbursement. This review explores these barriers using the Oncotype DX® test 
as an exemplar. Evidence was drawn from targeted literature searches and reviews 
of regulatory, reimbursement, and gray literature relevant to European 
healthcare systems.

Plain Language Summary: Genomic tests can analyze the genes in breast tumors to 
help doctors better understand how the cancer is likely to behave. They provide 
important information to guide treatment, such as whether chemotherapy, the 
standard treatment used to target fast-growing cancer cells, is likely to be 
beneficial. This helps ensure that patients receive the most appropriate care, 
offering treatment when it is likely to help, and avoiding it when it is not 
needed. In many parts of Europe, these tests are included in national guidelines 
and covered by health systems, which supports broad access for patients. 
However, in other countries, approval and funding processes are still evolving. 
This creates differences in how widely the tests are used, and some patients may 
not have the same opportunity to benefit from personalized treatment. A key 
reason for this variability is that each country has its own approach to 
approving and reimbursing new medical technologies. The process can be complex 
and often requires large amounts of evidence, which may differ from one country 
to another. Although the tests are supported by strong scientific research, 
differences in national systems make it challenging to introduce them across 
Europe in a consistent way. Greater coordination across countries could help 
ensure more equal access to tumor profiling. By working toward more aligned 
approval and evaluation processes, health systems could support wider use of 
personalized testing, leading to more informed treatment decisions and improved 
care for people with breast cancer.

Background: Teleconsultation, especially via voice call without 
videoconferencing, became widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic. The French 
High Council of Public Health prioritized cancer treatment to ensure continuity 
during the pandemic. Recently, French authorities prohibited teleconsultation 
via voice call without videoconferencing and reverted to a video format. This 
retrospective study assessed the efficiency of preanesthesia teleconsultation 
via voice call without videoconferencing by comparing ambulatory surgery failure 
rates for breast cancer surgery based on the type of preanesthesia consultation 
during the COVID-19 crisis. Methods: The study included 1,006 women who 
underwent ambulatory breast surgery before and after the implementation of 
teleconsultations via voice call without videoconferencing at a cancer center. 
Ambulatory failure was defined as requiring an unplanned overnight stay. 
Efficiency of preanesthesia consultation was defined as the absence of 
ambulatory surgery failure. Results: No significant difference in ambulatory 
failure rates was observed between the groups receiving teleconsultations via 
voice call without videoconferencing and those with in-person consultations: 
in-person consultation before COVID group 3.8%, teleconsultation via voice call 
without videoconferencing group 4%, and in-person consultation during the COVID 
period group 2.4%. No patients refused the proposed teleconsultation, showing 
strong acceptance. Conclusions: The results suggest that teleconsultations via 
voice call without videoconferencing are an effective and acceptable alternative 
to in-person consultations for ambulatory surgeries, without negatively 
impacting failure rates. However, further multicenter studies are needed to 
confirm these findings and assess the long-term integration of teleconsultation 
via voice call without videoconferencing in routine clinical practice.

Background: Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), commonly known as 
""chemobrain,"" frequently occurs during breast cancer treatment and has been 
linked to altered brain function. This resting-state functional magnetic 
resonance imaging study examined chemotherapy-related changes in functional 
brain activity, network connectivity, and associations with cognitive outcomes. 
Methods: Twenty-eight patients with breast cancer were assessed prechemotherapy 
(BB) and postchemotherapy (BBF), alongside 27 healthy controls of comparable age 
at baseline (BH) and follow-up (BHF). Mean fractional amplitude of low-frequency 
fluctuations (mfALFF) and mean regional homogeneity (mReHo) quantified 
functional brain activity. Graph theoretical analysis (GTA) assessed network 
topology; network-based statistics (NBS) evaluated interregional connectivity. 
Cognitive performance was evaluated through standardized assessments. Results: 
Postchemotherapy patients exhibited reduced anxiety and lower FACT-Cog scores. 
Voxel-wise analyses showed increased mfALFF in frontal regions and mReHo in 
superior temporal and inferior frontal gyri, alongside decreases in postcentral, 
lingual, and parahippocampal areas. Healthy controls showed increased activity 
in medial frontal and cingulate regions, with reductions in the temporal lobe 
and putamen. GTA revealed higher global efficiency and reduced modularity, path 
length, and network complexity in the BBF group compared with BHF. NBS showed 
weaker structural connectivity in motor and occipital regions prechemotherapy 
and decreased parietal and insular connectivity postchemotherapy. Multiple 
regression showed brain-behavior correlations: declines in FACT-Cog, Digit 
Symbol Substitution, and mood scores were linked to altered activity in frontal, 
parietal, cingulate, and occipital areas, while positive correlations suggested 
compensatory activation. Conclusions: Chemotherapy was associated with 
longitudinal alterations in brain activity, network organization, and 
connectivity in breast cancer survivors. Brain-behavior associations suggest 
disrupted neural networks may underlie CRCI.

BACKGROUND: It is now acknowledged that possible negative effects of cancer 
therapies on future reproductive autonomy are a major concern. In the bioethics 
literature, some advocate that the child's right to fertility preservation (FP) 
should be recognized as a right to an open future.
RESEARCH OBJECTIVES: The aim of this qualitative study is to (1) explore 
pediatric oncologists' perceptions regarding barriers and facilitators of OTC in 
prepubertal girls and (2) analyze the ethical, legal, social, and policy 
implications of these barriers and facilitators in Canada and France.
PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH DESIGN: Between November 2022 and August 2023, 10 
French and 6 Canadian oncopediatricians took part in semi-directed interviews. 
The content of the interviews was analyzed using thematic content analysis.
FINDINGS: All the participants emphasized the importance of FP, describing it as 
a fundamental right and central part of care. However, they identified ethical 
issues associated with the cost and the uncertainties of ovarian tissue 
cryopreservation (OTC). The majority thought that OTC should be covered by the 
public healthcare system to promote equity of access. French oncopediatricians 
of this study considered OTC to be standard of care, while the majority of 
Canadian oncopediatricians still considered it experimental, due to the risk of 
reintroducing malignant cells.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the importance of FP for 
prepubertal girls as a right, linked to the child's right to an open future, as 
described in bioethics literature. According to these findings, the fact that 
OTC is not systematically discussed, offered, or not covered by the healthcare 
system constitutes a barrier and fails to protect patients, who may experience 
future infertility as a consequence of their treatment, thus curtailing their 
reproductive autonomy.

AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks among the leading causes of 
cancer-related mortality worldwide. While doxorubicin (DOX) demonstrates 
efficacy, its associated toxicity is considerable, necessitating innovative 
strategies to reduce dosage and adverse effects. This study aimed to develop a 
graphene oxide - gold nanoparticle (GO-AuNP) nanocarrier designed to deliver DOX 
alongside an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) plasmid to improve 
therapeutic effectiveness against HCC.
METHODS: AuNPs-Functionalized Graphene Oxide Nanostructures were engineered for 
the co-delivery of DOX and EGFP. The transfection efficiency of the drug 
delivery nanocarrier, the release kinetics of the drugs, and the cytotoxic 
effects on cells were assessed using HepG2 and L929 cell lines.
RESULTS: The GO-Au nanocarriers demonstrated a controlled release of DOX, 
significantly inhibiting the proliferation of HepG2 cells at the 72-hour mark. 
Fluorescence imaging validated the effective transfection of EGFP and the 
internalization by cells. Importantly, the nanocarriers induced cytotoxicity 
from DOX at lower doses compared to free DOX, while enhancing the viability of 
L929 cells.
CONCLUSION: The GO-Au nanostructure effectively co-delivered DOX and EGFP into 
HCC cells, exhibiting improved transfection efficiency, along with reduced 
toxicity to normal cells. This dual-functional nanoplatform presents a promising 
approach for real-time monitoring of gene and drug delivery.

This review discusses the role of chronic human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection 
in patients receiving immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment against 
different malignancies, with an especial focus on malignant melanoma. We briefly 
outline the impact of HCMV infection on the immune system as an entity before 
exploring its role in the context of cancer. We then address the potential 
impact on the efficacy of immunotherapeutic agents, particularly ICB, before 
looking at development of ICB-related autoimmune toxicity. Finally, we discuss 
potential avenues for future research.This article is part of the discussion

In this introduction, we summarize the research papers, review articles, opinion 
pieces and important aspects of the facilitated discussion from the meeting 'The 
indirect effects of cytomegalovirus infection: mechanisms and consequences' held 
at the Royal Society, London, on 14-15 October 2024. The term 'indirect effects' 
describes a statistical excess of pathologies seen in people with human 
cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the absence of histopathological hallmarks of direct 
CMV tissue damage. This meeting brought together laboratory scientists, 
paediatric and adult clinical academics, epidemiologists, and trialists, to 
discuss the latest research on indirect effects, from biological mechanisms to 
potential clinical consequences. Important questions regarding the impact of CMV 
remain unanswered in areas important to human health, such as preterm birth and 
fetal growth restriction, asymptomatic congenital infection, susceptibility to 
non-CMV infections, cardiovascular and respiratory disease, transplant, cancer 
and mental health. Further research is needed to better describe the biology 
and, critically, to robustly quantify its clinical impact and develop 
interventions to mitigate any harms.This article is part of the discussion 
meeting issue 'The indirect effects of cytomegalovirus infection: mechanisms and 
consequences'.

Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary malignant brain tumour in 
adults, with limited treatment options despite years of research. Since the 2005 
introduction of the current standard of care, hundreds of clinical trials have 
failed to deliver significant breakthroughs. In 2002, human cytomegalovirus 
(HCMV) was detected in 100% of glioblastoma tumours. Although its role in cancer 
remains debated, and HCMV is not classified as an oncovirus, numerous studies 
have reported high viral prevalence in glioblastoma. HCMV can induce all 10 
'hallmarks of cancer' and has been shown to modify both tumour cell behaviour 
and the microenvironment, which may enhance tumour growth and promote immune 
evasion. The association between HCMV and poor glioblastoma prognosis has 
generated increasing interest in targeting the virus therapeutically. Our 
clinical studies suggest that adding antiviral treatment to standard care may 
improve survival in both primary and recurrent glioblastoma. Moreover, an 
mRNA-based HCMV pp65 dendritic cell vaccine has shown preliminary indications of 
a potential survival benefit in early phase studies. Future research should 
prioritize clarifying HCMV's role in glioblastoma and rigorously evaluating 
antiviral and immunotherapeutic strategies in randomized clinical trials.This 
article is part of the theme issue 'The indirect effects of cytomegalovirus 
infection: mechanisms and consequences'.

Hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment (TME) severely compromises the 
effectiveness of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and disrupts the process of 
cuproptosis. SDT generates insufficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) under low 
oxygen levels, while cuproptosis is impeded by hypoxia-induced mitochondrial 
respiration suppression. To address these limitations, we develop a CaO2-based 
self-oxygenating nanosonosensitizer incorporating a copper-based metal-organic 
framework (MOF) shell with loaded disulfiram (DSF), named CaO2-MD, which 
undergoes TME-responsive disassembly to generate O2 and release the drug. Upon 
ultrasound (US) irradiation, CaO2-MD generates ROS via SDT and simultaneously 
triggers cuproptosis through the release of copper ions and DSF. In vivo and in 
vitro experiments indicate that CaO2-MD can effectively alleviate tumor hypoxia, 
thereby synergistically activating cuproptosis and boosting SDT performance. In 
the 4T1 tumor model, CaO2-MD with US irradiation achieves potent tumor 
suppression and a 40% cure rate which further increases to 80% when combination 
with PD-L1 blockade therapy. The durable immune memory is established to 
effectively prevent recurrence. This work breaks through the hypoxic TME 
limitations constraining both SDT and cuproptosis, offering a promising platform 
for developing effective cancer therapies based on TME reconstruction.

Extracellular and membrane-associated proteins play essential roles in nearly 
all our body's biochemical processes and are implicated in cancer, autoimmune 
disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, a selective and 
universally applicable technique for the degradation of these proteins in 
disease-relevant conditions could significantly improve human health prospects. 
Lysosome-targeting chimeras (LYTACs) are bifunctional degraders comprising of an 
antibody conjugated with a cell-surface receptor ligand that enables cargo 
lysosome shuttling and degradation. Herein, we demonstrate that conjugation of 
antibodies with a small ketoboronate-based, lysine-reactive, covalent-reversible 
uptake tag (KB) enables the internalization of plasma membrane and extracellular 
proteins, directing them to lysosomal degradation via receptor-mediated 
endocytosis. Chemoproteomic target deconvolution revealed that reversible 
modification of lysine residues on the transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFRC) and 
HLA class I histocompatibility antigen A, B and C (HLA-ABC) enabled efficient 
uptake and lysosomal targeting through both clathrin-dependent and -independent 
mechanisms. KB-antibody conjugates (KB-TACs) efficiently degrade the epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in cancer cells. Furthermore, we 
showed KB-TTZ degrades HER2 in vivo in BT-474 tumor xenografts, with a 
significant reduction in tumor volumes compared to TTZ and vehicle treatments. 
Altogether, the KB tag represents a versatile, minimal-size chemical unit to 
functionalize therapeutic antibodies for targeted protein degradation through 
dual receptor-mediated endocytosis and lysosomal delivery.

BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an aggressive 
malignancy characterized by high metastatic potential and poor prognosis. 
Previous studies have focused on the correlation between hypermethylated ZNF582 
and HNSCC prognosis, particularly in diagnostic contexts, but the underlying 
molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study explored the 
biological function and underlying mechanisms of ZNF582 in HNSCC.
METHODS: ZNF582 expression was analyzed in HNSCC and non-tumor tissues. 
Functional assays, including colony formation, wound healing, Transwell, TUNEL 
assays, and xenograft models, were performed in HNSCC cell lines with or without 
ZNF582 overexpression. To assess cancer stemness, fluorescence-activated cell 
sorting, tumorsphere formation assay, extreme limiting dilution assay, and an 
orthotopic model were used. High-throughput RNA sequencing was performed to 
identify the altered signaling pathways.
RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis revealed that low ZNF582 expression in HNSCC 
correlated with poor prognosis. Overexpression of ZNF582 suppressed HNSCC 
proliferation, migration, and invasion, while promoting apoptosis both in vitro 
and in vivo. ZNF582 also reduced cancer stem cell activity and metastasis in 
HNSCC. Mechanically, ZNF582 overexpression inhibited the MAPK and PI3K/AKT 
signaling pathways.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that ZNF582 overexpression inhibits HNSCC 
progression via the MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, highlighting ZNF582 as 
a potential therapeutic target gene for HNSCC treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the costs and consequences of seven diagnostic strategies 
for ovarian cancer in pre- and post-menopausal women with symptoms in secondary 
care.
DESIGN: Economic evaluation alongside a prospective single-arm diagnostic 
accuracy study.
SETTING: NHS secondary care outpatients (2-week referrals, clinics, GP 
referrals, cross-specialty referrals) and inpatients (emergency presentations to 
secondary care).
SAMPLE: Two cohorts of 857 pre-menopausal and 1242 post-menopausal women newly 
presenting to secondary care with symptoms of suspected ovarian cancer.
METHODS: A model-based cost-consequence analysis (CCA) was conducted using a 
decision tree simulating patient pathways over 12 months. Diagnostic accuracy 
data were sourced from the ROCkeTS study and supplemented by literature.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cancer deaths, correct diagnosis proportion, and 
diagnostic yield.
RESULTS: No diagnostic strategy was optimal across all outcomes. Across both 
cohorts, the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) 200 was least expensive but had poor 
cancer death and diagnostic yield outcomes. The ADNEX 3% strategy had the 
highest diagnostic yield and lowest cancer mortality but was the most expensive. 
For pre-menopausal women, the IOTA ADNEX 10% strategy outperformed ORADS, ROMA, 
and CA125 in cost and outcomes. For post-menopausal women, the high cancer 
prevalence required a trade-off. In sensitivity analysis, a two-step IOTA ADNEX 
10% strategy outperformed ORADS, ROMA, and CA125 across all three outcomes, 
making the strategy a more balanced choice in both cohorts.
CONCLUSION: At 12 months, no single diagnostic strategy was superior. Early 
diagnosis requires balancing cancer mortality, diagnostic yield, and cost. The 
IOTA ADNEX two-step strategy at a 10% threshold provided the best trade-off 
across these factors and is recommended for practice.

Rearranged during transfection (RET) fusions drive subsets of non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Despite new selective 
RET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), resistance usually occurs and is often 
driven by RET-independent bypass mechanisms. Previous studies have implied 
crosstalk between RET and proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase SRC, but the 
anticancer effects of targeting SRC combined with selective RET TKIs, and the 
underlying molecular mechanisms involved, are not fully understood. Our results 
show that the multitargeted SRC TKI dasatinib significantly enhanced the 
efficacy of RET TKIs in RET fusion-positive (RET+) NSCLC and PTC cells. Genetic 
rescue experiments validated that the combination effects between RET TKIs and 
dasatinib were indeed SRC-dependent. Phosphoproteomics analysis and validation 
using selective inhibitors and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) determined that 
synergy was primarily mediated by suppression of downstream 
serine/threonine-protein kinase PAK signaling, with contributions from AKT and 
ribosomal protein S6. Importantly, synergy was also observed with eCF506 
(NXP900), a next-generation clinical SRC inhibitor. Finally, both SRC TKIs 
restored sensitivity in selpercatinib-resistant RET+ PTC cells. These results 
elucidate RET and SRC signaling crosstalk in RET+ NSCLC and PTC, suggesting that 
co-inhibiting SRC has clinical potential in TKI-naïve and -resistant RET+ 
cancers.

BACKGROUND: Transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) is a cold-sensing 
cation channel that regulates calcium (Ca2+) levels in cells. Its overexpression 
is linked to tumor development and progression. TRPM8 activation by specific 
agonists leads to increased Ca2+ influx, causing stress and apoptosis. This 
stress can enhance the production and release of exosomes, which have antitumor 
immunity properties. We hypothesize that activating TRPM8 with nano-icilin can 
stimulate immune responses when administered peritumorally.
METHOD: 4T1 cancer cells were treated with icilin nanoparticles and hypothermia 
to evaluate cytotoxicity, apoptosis, calcium flux, and exosome extraction. 
Isolated exosomes were characterized and tested in vivo for antitumor immune 
response in a mouse model. Tumor growth, cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, IL-10, and 
IL-1β), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were assessed. Data were analyzed using 
ANOVA and Duncan's test (P ≤ 0.05).
RESULTS: TRPM8 activation by icilin nanoparticles triggers apoptosis and calcium 
influx in 4T1 cells. Exosomes from treated cells exhibited altered size, charge, 
and increased levels of DAMPs (HMGB1, HSP70). Administering these exosomes 
significantly inhibited tumor growth, increased CD4+/CD8+ T cells, and elevated 
IL-2 and IL-12, while reducing IL-10 and PD-L1, thus preventing lung metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Activation of TRPM8 by icilin or cold can induce immunogenic 
exosomes, enhancing T cell infiltration, proinflammatory cytokines, and tumor 
suppression, offering a new strategy to boost immune responses against cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) is a common 
and significant side effect of cancer treatment, triggered by exposure to widely 
used chemotherapeutic agents such as vinca alkaloids, taxanes, platinum-based 
compounds, proteasome inhibitors, thalidomide, epothilones, and antibody-drug 
conjugates. CIPN can be long-lasting or even permanent, leading to a decline in 
patients' quality of life and negatively impacting the well-being of cancer 
survivors. It is typically characterized by polyneuropathy or neuronopathy, 
neuropathic pain, and axonal damage, primarily affecting the peripheral sensory 
nervous system.
AREAS COVERED: Emerging evidence suggests that anticancer agents may directly 
alter neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV), which could play a crucial 
role in the development of CIPN. This review explores the mechanisms underlying 
CIPN, with particular focus on the potential involvement of NaV alterations. 
Additionally, it examines pharmacological modulators of NaV, offering key 
insights into the prevention of axonal damage and the management of neuropathic 
pain associated with CIPN.
EXPERT OPINION: Despite the availability of various strategies to manage CIPN, 
there are currently few evidence-based options for its prevention or effective 
treatment once it develops. As a result, CIPN remains an unmet clinical 
challenge, highlighting the need for further research into its underlying 
pathophysiological mechanisms to develop innovative therapies.

In recent years, the tumor microenvironment has gained recognition as a key 
regulator of cancer progression. A central component of the tumor 
microenvironment, the extracellular matrix, undergoes dynamic remodeling during 
tumor development and plays a crucial role in disease pathogenesis. This review 
highlights the EMILIN/Multimerin family as a paradigm of the extracellular 
matrix's diverse and complex functions in cancer. Owing to their intricate 
domain architecture, these proteins engage in multifaceted interactions, not 
only directly modulating tumor cell proliferation and migration but also 
influencing other elements of the tumor microenvironment such as blood, 
lymphatic vessels, and immune cells. The functional landscape of these 
interactions is further complicated by proteolytic processing, which can both 
disrupt native functions and generate bioactive fragments with novel biological 
activities. Importantly, some of these fragments are detectable in biological 
fluids, suggesting their potential as predictive or prognostic biomarkers and 
contributing to the advancement of personalized therapeutic strategies.

auto-planning algorithms for prostate VMAT radiotherapy using biological 
optimization.

Medicine, Bloemfontein, South Africa.

PURPOSE: External beam radiotherapy for cancer treatment historically has faced 
the challenge of delivering sufficient dose to the target while minimizing dose 
to critical organs. Inverse planning techniques in modulated therapy can improve 
organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing but require significant human resources and can 
depend on planner experience. Advances in software and artificial intelligence 
(AI) have enabled the development of commercial treatment planning systems (TPS) 
with scripting and auto-planning capabilities, potentially reducing human 
resource demands and standardizing plan quality. This study aimed to create and 
validate knowledge-based planning (KBP) and multicriterial optimization (MCO) 
algorithms for assistive auto-planning of prostate volumetric modulated arc 
therapy (VMAT) plans using the Elekta Monaco TPS.
METHODS: Our methodology involved implementing and validating these algorithms 
retrospectively. We compared dose volume histogram (DVH), generalize equivalent 
uniform dose (gEUD), and plan quality scores with KBP and MCO algorithms to the 
clinical plans.
RESULTS: KBP and MCO generated plans on average spared OARs better and on 
average had better conformity to the targets whilst not sacrificing target 
coverage. Additionally, algorithm generated plans could be produced within 30 
min and were of clinical quality for 72% (KBP) and 78% (MCO) of plans. When 
comparing the KBP and MCO plans, MCO was dosimetrically slightly superior, 
slightly faster, and produced plans of clinical quality in more of the 
validation population than the KBP algorithm.
CONCLUSION: This work showed that it is possible to build KBP and MCO based 
assistive auto-planning in the Elekta Monaco TPS focusing on gEUD based cost 
functions. When using the Monaco Scripting functionality, these algorithms could 
assist in reducing the clinical planning workload while maintaining a patient 
specific standard of quality.

BACKGROUND: Various methods have been developed to generate synthetic computed 
tomography (CT) images from magnetic resonance (MR) images, including 
segmentation-based approach with MR calculating attenuation (MRCAT) and deep 
learning (DL)-based approach.
PURPOSE: In this study, we aimed to validate the conventional radiotherapy (RT) 
planning process with MRCAT and DL-based synthetic CT images for five patients 
with cervical cancer.
METHODS: DL-based synthetic CT images of the five patients were inferred using a 
network trained with 40 pairs of CT and deformed, normalized T2-weighted MR 
scans; MRCAT images were obtained from mDixon sequences for the tested cases 
only. On the synthetic CT images, the contouring process for organs-at-risk 
(OARs) was automatically performed with minor adjustments, while two experienced 
radiation oncologists defined target volumes. Simultaneous integrated boost 
plans (2.2/2.0/1.8 Gy with 25 fractions) were produced from a commercial 
treatment planning system (TPS) TomoTherapy.
RESULTS: The plans with two synthetic CT images were compared with those based 
on genuine CT images for the five test cases. High geometric similarity was 
confirmed for the planning target volume (PTV), with average dice similarity 
coefficient (DSC) of 0.844 for the DL-based and 0.829 for the MRCAT images. The 
mean percentage difference in gross tumor volume (GTV) was 20.71 ± 34.28% for 
DL-based synthetic CT and 30.31 ± 46.20% for MRCAT images. By contrast, PTV, 
encompassing GTV, exhibited minimal changes with an average increase of 0.37 ± 
3.10% and 1.66 ± 7.62%, respectively. MRCAT images and DL-based synthetic CT 
revealed significant differences, relative to true CT images, in the entire 
volume (p = 0.03) of the bladder and in V20Gy and V30Gy of the resultant plans 
for the bladder (p = 0.029 and 0.063), all plans generated on the synthetic CTs 
were clinically acceptable and met institutional for target coverage.
CONCLUSION: MRCAT and DL-based synthetic CT images demonstrated clinical 
applicability, achieving plan quality similar to that of plans based on genuine 
planning CT images.

Recent studies have demonstrated promising outcomes in the treatment of head and 
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) through immune checkpoint cytotoxic T 
lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) blockade. However, while the potential of CTLA4 in 
HNSCC treatment is evident, its underlying mechanism of action remains unclear, 
leaving room for optimization. Research has revealed that C-C Motif Chemokine 
ligand (CCL21) possesses the ability to activate T cell responses and enhance 
the immune response in the tumour microenvironment. CCL21 has demonstrated 
anti-tumour properties in various cancer types. Combing CCL21 with immune 
checkpoints inhibitors can amplify the synergistic anti-tumour benefits. This 
study applied a combination of CTLA4 monoclonal antibody and chemokine CCL21 in 
the immunotherapy of HNSCC. Furthermore, this optimized therapeutic approach 
notably enhances the impact on the activation of immune T cells in the tumour 
microenvironment and elucidates its regulatory influence on the key proteins of 
the Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) 
signaling pathway. These findings offer an efficacious immunotherapeutic 
strategy for HNSCC.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have improved the prognosis of patients with 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the cure rate remains low because 
tolerant persister cancer cells can survive within the tumor during ICI 
treatment. We have previously reported that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 
(PAI-1) is involved in tolerance acquisition to osimertinib in epidermal growth 
factor receptor-mutated NSCLC. This study aimed to examine the role of PAI-1 in 
ICI tolerance and whether PAI-1 may be a therapeutic target to overcome this 
tolerance. In a mouse subcutaneous tumor model using Lewis lung carcinoma or 
KLN205 cells, cancer cells surviving within the tumor 7 days after 
anti-programmed death-1 (aPD-1) antibody treatment were defined as aPD-1 
antibody-tolerant persister cells (aPD-1-TPs). PAI-1 and mesenchymal gene 
expression levels were higher in aPD-1-TPs than in control cells. 
Immunohistochemical analyses showed higher numbers of tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs), expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in cancer 
cells, and degree of angiogenesis. In contrast, the number of tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs) was lower in aPD-1 antibody-tolerant tumors than in control 
tumors. Combination treatment with an aPD-1 antibody and the PAI-1 inhibitor 
TM5614 decreased mesenchymal gene expression, PD-L1 expression, TAM numbers, and 
angiogenesis and increased TIL counts in tolerant tumors. Furthermore, it 
resulted in prolonged inhibition of tumor growth. In conclusion, this study 
underscores the involvement of PAI-1 in the survival of aPD-1-TPs via 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition and alteration of the tumor microenvironment. 
Combination treatment with an aPD-1 antibody and TM5614 can be a new therapeutic 
strategy for NSCLC.

OBJECTIVES: Cervical screening and precancer treatment are less effective in 
women living with HIV (WLWH) than in women without HIV. We assessed high-risk 
human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection and cervical disease progression among 
screened WLWH in Zambia.
METHODS: Participants underwent visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), HR-HPV 
testing and cervical biopsies at baseline and at follow-up 30-36 months later. 
Women with positive VIA results or high-grade histology were offered treatment. 
We assessed HR-HPV and cervical disease prevalence at both timepoints and used 
multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with cervical 
disease progression and regression.
RESULTS: Among 241 included women, HR-HPV prevalence declined from 44% (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 39%-49%) at baseline to 24% (95% CI: 19%-31%) at 
follow-up. High-grade disease decreased from 25% (95% CI: 20%-31%) to 9% (95% 
CI: 5%-13%). In analyses adjusted for age, CD4 cell count, HIV RNA viral load, 
HR-HPV infection and histological results at baseline, precancer treatment was 
associated with increased odds of disease regression (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 
2.74, 95% CI: 1.08-7.06) and reduced odds of progression (aOR: 0.45, 95% CI: 
0.11-1.64). One-third of women with high-grade disease at follow-up (7/21) had 
previously undergone precancer treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Cervical screening and precancer treatment are key to reducing 
cervical disease progression among WLWH and ultimately achieving cervical cancer 
elimination, but efforts to improve treatment effectiveness among WLWH must be 
balanced with the risk of overtreatment.

Gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma is an increasingly common cancer 
with complex biology and poor prognosis. The treatment strategy for locally 
advanced tumors involves multimodal treatment with perioperative chemotherapy. 
However, survival rates remain low, especially for advanced disease. Here, 
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor sections from 72 patients with GEJ I and 
II adenocarcinoma who underwent primary resection or perioperative 
standard-of-care FLOT treatment were analyzed for their intratumoral T cell 
composition using multiplex immunohistochemistry. The proportions of T cells and 
their influence on survival were evaluated using Mann-Whitney U and log rank 
analyses. A comparison of short- and long-term survivors revealed significant 
differences in the infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tumors after 
neoadjuvant FLOT treatment presented increased proportions of CD8+ T cells with 
reduced Granzyme B expression, indicating an altered immune response. Overall 
survival analysis revealed that high infiltration of Tregs was associated with 
poor survival. Notably, responders to FLOT therapy had a greater T cell 
frequency and improved survival, whereas nonresponders presented higher levels 
of Tregs and CD8+ T cells expressing TIM-3. Overall, GEJ cancer patients had 
increased CD8+ T cells after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with FLOT, and Tregs were 
associated with treatment response and reduced survival.

This study contributes to the characterization of human macrophages in normal 
and pathological conditions such as cancer. We characterized a macrophage 
population expressing membrane-associated IL-18 (mIL-18) that shows peculiar 
proteomic, phenotypic, ultrastructural, and functional properties. mIL-18+ 
macrophages exhibit increased levels of key proteins involved in pathogen 
recognition, activation, migration, and endocytosis. They also display 
specialized functions in vesicle and actin filament transport and lipid 
metabolism, and have typical mitochondrial traits. Importantly, mIL-18+ cells 
dominate the peritoneal fluid of adult cancer patients and are present in the 
bone marrow of children with neuroblastoma. They express high levels of TREM2 
but display heterogeneous FOLR2 expression, distinguishing distinct cell subsets 
with possibly different functions. Accordingly, in primary neuroblastomas, 
transcriptional signatures associated with mIL-18 expression show different 
prognostic values. Our data show that mIL-18+ macrophages, which are predominant 
across the tumor microenvironment, exhibit previously undetected heterogeneity, 
potentially impacting tumor progression in a variable manner.

G1 to S phase transition protein (GSPT1), a small GTPase involved in translation 
termination, which promotes the progression of cancer cells, has emerged as an 
attractive potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment with the rapid 
breakthrough of molecular glue degraders (MGDs). Although the precise mechanism 
of GSPT1 in cancer biology is partially understood, in this review, the 
characteristics of GSPT1 expression and regulatory networks are systematically 
attempted to be addressed, from insights into the structure, expression, and 
molecular mechanisms, highlighting the distribution and isoform-specific 
signaling of GSPT1 in tumors. The clinical significance is emphasized, immune 
interactions, and oncogenic pathways of GSPT1-targeted therapies, proposing 
strategies to address current challenges and provide therapeutic opportunities 
for the application of GSPT1 degraders in precision oncology. A novel future 
direction is hoped to provide to enhance the treatment response of GSPT1 MGDs in 
clinical implications.

Today, it is well established that the tumor microenvironment (TME), the tumor 
niche, along with melanoma cells, plays a crucial role in cancer dissemination 
and influences the effectiveness of anticancer therapies. Therefore, it may 
serve as a potential therapeutic target in melanoma treatment. In our research, 
we focused on the effects exerted by cells within the melanoma microenvironment 
on cancer progression and the development of therapy resistance. Specifically, 
we examined stromal cells accompanying melanoma cells in the tumor - 
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), cancer-associated keratinocytes (CAKs), 
and cancer-associated adipocytes (CAAs). Particular attention was given to 
keratinocytes, as their role in the melanoma microenvironment remains the least 
understood.

Chronic perineal pain is a common complication among patients with cancer. Due 
to the complex innervation of this anatomical region, pain management is often 
challenging and significantly impacts patients' quality of life. We present the 
case of an elderly patient with advanced-stage rectosigmoid junction 
adenocarcinoma who experienced severe coccygeal-perineal oncologic pain. Despite 
a multimodal analgesic treatment approach, the patient exhibited refractoriness 
to conventional pain management. Consequently, an interventional analgesic 
approach was implemented using an impar ganglion block with botulinum toxin type 
A (BoNT-A). Following the intervention, a significant reduction in pain 
intensity and opioid consumption was observed. This case highlights the 
therapeutic potential of the impar ganglion block with BoNT-A as an effective 
option for the management of refractory pelvic-perineal oncologic pain.

Plain Language Summary: This article describes the case of an 88-year-old man 
with advanced colon cancer who suffered from severe pelvic pain. Despite 
receiving multiple pain medications, including opioids, the patient experienced 
only limited relief. A nerve block targeting the structure that transmits pain 
signals from the affected area was performed – an impar ganglion block combined 
with botulinum toxin type A, a substance that can help reduce nerve-mediated 
pain. After the procedure, the patient reported substantial pain relief, 
decreased opioid use, and improved overall well-being and quality of life. This 
case suggests that adding botulinum toxin to an impar ganglion block may be a 
valuable option for patients with cancer-related pelvic pain that does not 
improve with standard treatments.

IMPORTANCE: Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women 
globally, with significant implications for reproductive health, including the 
use of contraception. The intersection of breast cancer and contraception 
presents unique challenges due to concerns about cancer recurrence, patient 
safety, and hormonal roles in cancer. The hormonal sensitivity of many breast 
cancers creates a complex approach to safe contraceptive options for patients. 
However, recent studies highlight the nuanced role of low-dose and nonestrogenic 
hormonal options, such as progestin-only methods, while emphasizing the need for 
further research on their long-term safety.
OBJECTIVES: An important aspect of breast cancer survivorship is addressed: 
reproductive health and contraceptive choices.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A PubMed review was conducted using terms ""breast cancer"" 
AND ""contraception"" OR ""contraceptive use."" The search included review articles, 
original research databases, and guidelines on contraception for breast cancer 
patients and survivors.
RESULTS: Nonhormonal contraceptives, including copper intrauterine devices, 
barrier methods, and sterilization, provide safe and effective alternatives but 
may be less preferred by some patients due to side effects or other limitations. 
Current guidelines may not offer specific recommendations for both breast cancer 
patients and breast cancer survivors.
CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive counseling approach to address fertility in 
patients with breast cancer and survivors is most appropriate; nonhormonal 
contraceptive options provide the safest methods for patients.
RELEVANCE: Current guidelines may not offer specific recommendations for both 
breast cancer patients and breast cancer survivors.
TARGET AUDIENCE: Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completing this activity, the learner will be better 
able to describe the unique contraceptive needs for breast cancer patients and 
survivors; discuss the safety and efficacy of various contraceptive options for 
patients; and identify gaps in current contraceptive guidelines for patients and 
survivors.

(Abstracted from Obstet Gynecol 2025;146(2):223-232) Awareness of hereditary 
gynecologic cancer has been growing over the last few decades, and testing and 
prevention methods have been decreasing in cost. This means that more people who 
have gene mutations for these hereditary cancers more often face decisions about 
risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO).

(Abstracted from Int J Gynaecol Obstet 2024:166 Suppl 1:3-21) The availability 
of comprehensive health care services and cancer screening in high-income 
countries has greatly reduced the burden of certain cancers, such as cervical 
cancer. Although the burden has been significantly reduced, cervical cancer 
still represents a large health burden with high numbers of deaths attributed to 
it yearly across the world.

(Abstracted from Int J Gynecol Cancer 2025;35(7):101926, 
doi:10.1016/j.ijgc.2025.101926) The most common gynecologic cancer in 
high-income countries is endometrial cancer (EC), with a global incidence of 
417,000 in 2020. It is postulated that some of this rising incidence is due to 
the increased prevalence of risk factors such as obesity; the number of 
EC-related deaths has also increased, additionally with an increasing gap in 
survival rates between White and Black patients as well as a gap in survival 
rates between individuals who have experienced socioeconomic deprivation and 
those who have not.

BACKGROUND: Differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) is typically managed 
surgically with favourable outcomes. However, surgery may have dire consequences 
when the tumour invades critical structures. Neoadjuvant therapy with tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has emerged as a potential strategy to improve 
resectability and reduce morbidity in advanced DTC. We evaluated the efficacy 
and safety of neoadjuvant TKI therapy in patients with advanced or unresectable 
DTC.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on patients with advanced DTC 
treated with neoadjuvant TKIs (lenvatinib or dabrafenib/trametinib) followed by 
curative intent surgery between 2023 and 2025. Data on disease extent, genetic 
alterations, treatment regimens, and adverse effects were collected. Radiologic 
response was assessed by CT or PET-CT according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria. 
Surgical outcomes were evaluated by the degree of morbidity and by tumour 
involvement in the surgical margins.
RESULTS: Nine patients were included, seven treated with lenvatinib, two treated 
with dabrafenib/trametinib on the basis of molecular alterations. The median 
duration of TKI therapy was 5 months, and no disease progression was observed 
throughout. Radiological assessment revealed a median reduction in tumour burden 
of 23.53%, contributing to improved tumour resectability. All patients underwent 
surgical resection with preservation of critical structures. Elevated TSH levels 
during neoadjuvant therapy was correlated with a positive treatment response 
(p = 0.028).
CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant TKIs may improve the surgical outcomes of patients with 
advanced DTC. Decision-guided radiological and blood-based surrogate biomarkers, 
such as TSH, can assist in evaluating treatment response and guide decisions 
regarding treatment duration and extent of surgical resection.

Redox-active metal complexes of bioessential 3d metal ions, such as Cu(II), 
offer promising, potentially safer alternatives to Pt(II)-based chemotherapy. We 
report the synthesis, characterization, and biological evaluation of three 
phenyl-substituted Cu(II) β-diketonate complexes bearing a fixed 
4'-phenyl-2,2':6',2″-terpyridine (Ph-tpy) ligand: [Cu(Ph-tpy)(acac)]ClO4 (F1), 
[Cu(Ph-tpy)(Ph-acac)]ClO4 (F2), and [Cu(Ph-tpy)(Ph2-acac)]ClO4 (F3). In these 
compounds, acac, Ph-acac, and Ph2-acac represent the O,O-donor monoanionic 
β-diketonate ligands derived from 2,4-pentanedione, 1-phenyl-1,3-butanedione, 
and 1,4-diphenyl-1,4-butanedione, respectively. The 1:1 electrolytic, 
one-electron paramagnetic complexes were stable in solution for 48 h, with 
increasing lipophilicity (log P: 1.22-1.89). In vitro, F1-F3 showed potent 
cytotoxicity against A549, HepG2, and SKOV-3 cells (IC50: 1.2-4.2 µM, 24 h) and 
minimal toxicity toward Vero cells (∼90 µM), demonstrating promising potency and 
selectivity. AO/PI staining, DNA laddering, and clonogenic assays confirmed 
apoptosis induction and proliferation inhibition, with qRT-PCR revealing 
upregulation of p53, p21, and BAX, and downregulation of BCL-2 in cancer cells. 
Flow cytometry indicated G1-phase arrest. Docking studies suggested favorable 
binding to EGFR, ALK, and HSA, while molecular dynamics simulations suggested 
the formation of stable protein-ligand complexes. Collectively, these 
mixed-ligand Cu(II) complexes exhibit high anticancer efficacy, low toxicity to 
normal cells, and multi-target interactions, underscoring their potential as 
next-generation chemotherapeutic agents.

OBJECTIVES: To validate cone-beam breast computed tomography (CBBCT) for 
evaluating NAT response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) version 1.1, and to explore correlations between multidimensional CBBCT 
features and pathological complete response (pCR).
METHODS: We prospectively analyzed 73 patients who underwent pre- and post-NAT 
CBBCT, of whom 41 also received paired magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
Inter-modality and imaging-pathology concordance were assessed using Cohen's κ 
statistics. Determinants of CBBCT accuracy were identified through univariate 
and logistic regression analyses. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
analysis with DeLong's test was used to determine the optimal quantitative 
parameter for discriminating pCR from non-pCR. Associations between pCR and 
changes in calcification, vascularity, and background parenchymal enhancement 
(BPE) were evaluated using Pearson's χ2 and Fisher's exact tests.
RESULTS: CBBCT showed excellent agreement with MRI (κ = 0.809) and good 
pathological concordance (κ = 0.618; MRI κ = 0.700). The area under the curve 
(AUC) for distinguishing responders from non-responders was 0.950 for CBBCT and 
0.905 for MRI. For pCR assessment, the AUC values were 0.643 and 0.786, 
respectively. Targeted therapy (odds ratio [OR] = 0.059, p = 0.013) and 
linear/segmental calcifications (OR = 0.127, p = 0.042) were independent factors 
affecting CBBCT accuracy. The enhanced degree change (ΔE) on CBBCT demonstrated 
strong predictive performance for pCR (AUC = 0.941) with high computational 
efficiency. Significant associations with pCR were observed for reductions in 
calcification extent (p = 0.021), adjacent vascular sign (AVS) grade 
(p = 0.004), and BPE levels (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: CBBCT demonstrates high accuracy in assessing NAT response, with 
excellent agreement to MRI. ΔE is recommended as an optimal quantitative 
parameter for predicting pCR, supported by dynamic changes in calcification 
extent, AVS, and BPE grade as valuable markers, positioning CBBCT as a 
comprehensive tool for breast cancer management.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: CBBCT enables a comprehensive and efficient tool 
for monitoring NAT response, showing excellent concordance with MRI, and its 
multidimensional features are also valuable for predicting pCR.

BACKGROUND: Constitutional primary monoallelic promoter methylation of 
hereditary cancer genes, although rare, may explain early-onset cancers without 
family history. Also, promoter methylation of a hereditary cancer gene secondary 
to a genetic alteration in a methylation regulatory region can cause a 
hereditary cancer syndrome. This study investigates constitutional promoter 
methylation as mechanism of inactivation of cancer predisposition genes in 
genetically unsolved familial and/or early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) 
patients.
RESULTS: Bisulfite-treated peripheral blood DNA from 46 early-onset/familial CRC 
patients was analyzed using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. One 
early-onset CRC patient exhibited constitutional, likely monoallelic, 
methylation of CpG island 102 in LTBP4, a gene involved in TGF-β signaling. 
Somatic methylation of this CpG island is common in CRC, and correlates with 
LTBP4 downregulation. LTBP4 double knockout mice develop colorectal adenomas and 
carcinomas, supporting the role of this gene in CRC predisposition. 
No additional cases with constitutional LTBP4 CpG island 102 methylation or 
enrichment of deleterious LTBP4 variants in CRC patients compared to controls 
were found. Another early-onset CRC patient exhibited mosaic BRCA1 promoter 
methylation, typically associated with increased breast and ovarian cancer risk. 
No somatic second hit in BRCA1 was detected in the patient's tumor, and 
homologous recombination deficiency-associated features were inconclusive.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that constitutional methylation of LTBP4 CpG 
island 102 may be associated with increased CRC risk. Identification of 
additional cases is needed to confirm the existence of a novel CRC 
predisposition syndrome driven by epigenetic inactivation of LTBP4, potentially 
also linked to other clinical phenotypes associated with LTBP4 deficiency, such 
as pulmonary emphysema. Whether constitutional BRCA1 methylation contributes to 
CRC risk remains to be determined.

Current methods for post-treatment cancer surveillance and recurrence monitoring 
rely mainly on biophysical imaging methods like CT and MRI. Limitations 
associated with these approaches include risk of radiation, high cost and 
sophistication in operation. Minimally invasive blood test is a very attractive 
alternative but there is no biomarker that is of sufficient sensitivity for this 
purpose. In this study, we attempted to discover novel breast cancer-associated 
blood plasma proteins that can fill this gap. We tested the hypothesis that 
genes that are co-amplified HER2 can be used as a surrogate biomarker for 
detection of HER2+ breast cancer. Following identification of HER2-coamplified 
genes via copy number variation analysis, a series of bioinformatic tools were 
used that eventually led to the identification of WFIKKN2 as a novel 
cancer-associated blood plasma protein. ELISA analysis of more than 120 plasma 
samples from non-cancer and cancer patients with HER2+ breast cancer revealed 
WFIKKN2 to have sensitivity and specificity of up to 89% and 60%, respectively. 
While not ideal as a diagnostic biomarker due to its moderate specificity, the 
high sensitivity of WFIKKN2 is suitable for the purpose of post-treatment 
surveillance and recurrence monitoring. The data warrants WFIKKN2 to be further 
evaluated through clinical studies to validate its clinical utility.

BACKGROUND: Carboplatin resistance represents a critical therapeutic challenge 
in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment. Although KHSRP has been 
implicated in lung cancer progression, its molecular mechanisms and impacts on 
chemotherapy sensitivity remain elusive. Notably, KHSRP has the capacity to 
activate the transcription of HMGB1, an oncogene known to influence chemotherapy 
sensitivity. However, it remains to be determined whether KHSRP affects 
chemotherapy response in NSCLC via HMGB1.
METHODS: KHSRP expression in NSCLC cells was analyzed using qRT-PCR. Cell 
proliferation, apoptosis, and migration were evaluated using colony formation, 
flow cytometry and wound healing assays. A luciferase reporter assay was 
conducted to assess whether KHSRP transcriptionally regulates HMGB1. 
Additionally, A549 cell xenografts were established in nude mice to investigate 
the tumor growth-promoting effects of KHSRP in vivo.
RESULTS: KHSRP expression was notably elevated in NSCLC cells. Overexpression of 
KHSRP remarkably promoted A549 cell proliferation, migration, and 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); while KHSRP knockdown exhibited the 
opposite effects. Mechanically, KHSRP notably promoted the transcription of 
HMGB1 and upregulated its expression in A549 cells. Importantly, deficiency of 
KHSRP remarkably enhanced the suppressive effects of carboplatin on A549 cell 
proliferation, migration, EMT and HMGB1 expression. Meanwhile, in vivo 
experiments demonstrated that downregulation of KHSRP potentiated the inhibitory 
effect of carboplatin on tumor growth in tumor-bearing nude mice.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that silencing of KHSRP enhances the drug 
sensitivity of carboplatin in NSCLC, potentially mediated through the inhibition 
of HMGB1. Targeting KHSRP may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to 
improve chemotherapy efficacy in NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the solid% using 3D-CT and 
analyze its potential value in selecting a segmentectomy as the surgical 
procedure.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 198 NSCLC patients who underwent 
segmentectomy. Of these, 93 cases who were evaluated as pure-solid on 2D-CT 
scans were included in the analysis. Receiver operating characteristics analysis 
was used to calculate cut-off levels for prognostic markers. The univariate 
analysis included variables such as age, whole tumor size, smoking history, 
gender, 2D-mCT value, whole tumor volume, 3D-mCT value, solid%, solid volume, 
standardized uptake value, and carcinoembryonic antigen value. Multiple logistic 
regression analyses were performed to determine the independent variables for 
the prediction of tumor recurrence.
RESULTS: A cutoff of 71.1% yielded the maximum specificity and sensitivity to 
predict recurrence based on the solid%. In the group consisted of 62 cases with 
a solid% of 71.1% or higher on 3D-CT background-matched lobectomy group, the RFS 
was significantly better (p = 0.046) for the lobectomy group compared to the 
segmentectomy group. Preoperatively determined variables were used in multiple 
logistic regression models, revealing that the solid% (p = 0.04) and SUV 
(p = 0.03) were predictive and independent factors of tumor recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Solid % on 3D-CT has a potential to predict recurrence after 
segmentectomy in a group of cases rated as pure solid on 2D-CT. A future 
prospective study should be conducted to establish optimal treatment strategies 
for this disease.

The methyltransferase-like (METTL) family members are the central ‘writers’ of 
epitranscriptome modifications, catalyzing N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 
N7-methylguanosine (m7G), 3-methylcytosine (m3C) and other chemical markers that 
modify DNA, RNA, and proteins (both histones and non-histone proteins) to 
dynamically regulate gene expression. The METTL family is distinguished by 
structural diversity, substrate specificity and multifaceted roles in epigenetic 
regulation. Dysregulation of METTL proteins has been demonstrated to disrupt RNA 
stability, translational efficiency and signaling pathways, which has been 
associated with tumorigenesis, neurodegeneration and immune dysfunction. At 
present, there are still limitations in the knowledge of the cooperative 
networks among METTL members and with other major signaling pathways. The 
objective of the present study is to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms 
mediated by METTL across different levels, laying the groundwork for subsequent 
development of precision therapies targeting phenotypic enzyme modifications. 
This review comprehensively delineates the structural characteristics and 
molecular functions of METTLs, their cooperative interactions, and their 
pathophysiological regulatory networks organized by signaling pathways rather 
than disease categories. We evaluate their diagnostic potential as biomarkers 
and their therapeutic implications, with particular focus on emerging METTL 
inhibitors that have entered clinical trials. By systematically exploring the 
mechanisms behind their context-dependent functions and analyzing their 
potential for clinical translation, we provide a foundation for precision 
therapies targeting these core regulators of nucleic acid and protein 
methylation.

OBJECTIVES: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype with 
limitations in therapy. Although cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKi) have 
been proven in breast cancer, challenges remain in TNBC. Successful inhibition 
of CDK4/6 relies on intact Rb tumor suppressor (encoded by tumor suppressor gene 
RB1). However, in addition to gene mutation or deletion, RB1, as an imprinted 
gene, also has a mechanism of inactivation due to loss of imprinting (LOI). This 
study aimed to ascertain the imprinting status of RB1 in TNBC.
METHODS: We applied bioinformatic analyses to evaluate methylation differences 
on the RB1 imprinting control region CpG85 among subtypes of breast cancer. 
Deregulation of RB1 expression by LOI in TNBC cell lines was further tested by 
RT-qPCR with stimulation by 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (DAC) treatment. In addition, 
RB1 CpG85 methylation levels of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma was 
assessed by pyrosequencing in 15 enrolled TNBC patients and 6 non-cancer donors. 
Survival analysis based on TCGA and GEO databases were performed to explored the 
potential clinical significance.
RESULTS: Bioinformatic analysis showed hypomethylation at CpG85 of RB1 in TNBC, 
which was further confirmed in cell lines. LOI of RB1 affected its 
transcription. Analysis of cfDNA showed CpG85 was differentially methylated in 
TNBC patients, with 6/15 patients displaying hypomethylation at cg18481241 and 
1/15 at cg03085377 within CpG85. Patients with hypomethylation of these sites 
correlated with worse overall survival.
CONCLUSIONS: RB1 exhibits potential LOI in TNBCs, laying the groundwork for more 
precise subtyping and treatment of TNBC patients.

Oxidative stress and inflammation play a key role in the occurrence and 
progression of liver diseases, inducing hepatocyte apoptosis, fibrosis, and even 
cancer. However, there is a lack of effective therapeutic interventions to slow 
liver inflammation and the progression of metabolic liver diseases. The unique 
biological properties of molecular hydrogen's selective scavenging of 
pathological free radicals have shown therapeutic potential in animal studies 
and clinical trials of chronic liver diseases. This review describes innovative 
technologies and applications of molecular hydrogen in the treatment of liver 
injury and liver metabolic diseases, focusing on its mechanisms of action in 
regulating redox and inflammatory cascade signal transduction and specifically 
discussing its potential for glucolipid metabolic homeostasis and intestinal 
microbiota remodeling, as well as cell protection. Future studies are needed to 
further identify the unknown mechanisms by which molecular hydrogen improves the 
beneficial role of the liver microenvironment and advance the clinical 
application of hydrogen therapy.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of low-dose perioperatively continuous infusion 
of lidocaine on postoperative inflammation, immune function and quality of 
recovery in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).
METHODS: Patients with lung cancer aged 18-65 years, undergoing elective VATS 
were randomized into lidocaine intervention (L) and standard care (C) groups. 
For patients in Group L, 1 mg/kg lidocaine was intravenously injected within 
approximately 10 min during the induction of anesthesia, followed by a 
continuous infusion of lidocaine at a rate of 1.5 mg/kg/h until the patient left 
the operating room. The postoperative analgesia plan included 2% lidocaine at 
5 mg/kg. Group C was given an equal volume of normal saline as a control.The 
primary outcomes were plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), 
interleukin-1(IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), along with T lymphocyte counts of 
CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio before anesthesia induction (T1), and 
24 h (T2) and 48 h (T3) postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included the visual 
analog scale (VAS) for pain at rest and during movement, Time to first 
post-operative rescue analgesia, Cumulative OME(the oral morphine equivalents) 
at 24 h, along with the frequency and severity of postoperative nausea and 
vomiting (PONV) within the initial 48-h after surgery.
RESULTS: In Group C and Group L, compared with preoperative levels, the levels 
of CD3 + , CD4 + and the ratio of CD4 + /CD8 + were significantly decreased at 
24 and 48 h postoperatively, while the levels of TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6 were 
significantly increased (P < 0.05). Compared with Group C, in Group L, the 
levels of CD3 + , CD4 + and the ratio of CD4 + /CD8 + were significantly 
increased at 24 and 48 h postoperatively, while the levels of TNF-α, IL-1 and 
IL-6 were significantly decreased (P < 0.05).Additionally, the L group 
experienced less pain on the movement VAS, the decreased OME dosage and a lower 
rate of PONV within 48 h postoperatively than the C group (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Intravenous infusion of lidocaine during the perioperative period 
was effective in reducing postoperative inflammatory response and the 
postoperative suppression of cellular immune function in the body, as well as 
significantly reducing the level of postoperative pain and the incidence of PONV 
in patients undergoing VATS.

Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women 
worldwide, necessitating early and accurate detection methods. This study 
introduces a hybrid framework utilizing Vision Transformers (ViT) and ensemble 
learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNN) models for cervical cancer 
classification based on Pap smear images. Two prominent datasets, Mendeley LBC 
and SIPaKMeD, are employed, encompassing nine distinct categories of cervical 
cell abnormalities. The proposed approach integrates pre-trained CNN models of 
DenseNet201, Xception, and InceptionResNetV2 to extract high-level features, 
further fused through ensemble learning. These features are then processed by 
the ViT-based encoder model designed for improved interpretability and accuracy. 
Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid model achieves superior 
accuracy rates of 97.26%, a recall of 97.27%, a precision of 97.27%, and 96.70% 
for the F1-score on the Mendeley LBC dataset. For the SIPaKMeD dataset, there 
was an accuracy of 99.18%, a recall of 99.18%, a precision of 99.15%, and a 
99.21% F1-score. On the combined dataset, the model outperformed individual 
pre-trained models with 95.10% accuracy and a 95.01% F1-score. Moreover, the 
framework incorporates augmentation with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, 
specifically Grad-CAM, to provide transparent and interpretable diagnostic 
outcomes, enhancing its utility in clinical settings. This research underscores 
the potential of hybrid AI frameworks in revolutionizing cervical cancer 
diagnostics by offering accurate, efficient, and interpretable solutions.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide, with 70% of 
cases attributed to sporadic mutations and the remaining linked to inherited 
genetic predispositions. This mini-review focuses on low-penetrance genetic 
variants that modestly influence CRC risk, categorizing them by mutation type - 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and non-SNP variants. Missense mutations 
in genes such as TP53, APC, CHEK2, and MUTYH are highlighted for their varying 
associations with CRC risk across populations. Additionally, silent mutations, 
untranslated region variants, and promoter modifications, such as those in 
PLA2G2A, XPA, and DNMT3B, are discussed for their potential, albeit modest, 
roles in CRC predisposition. Non-SNP variants, including deletions and 
insertions in genes like CHEK2, NOD2, GSTM1, and GSTT1, are explored for their 
frameshift effects and influence on CRC susceptibility. The review underscores 
the complexity of CRC risk, shaped by genetic, environmental, and lifestyle 
factors, and advocates for comprehensive, population-specific research to 
enhance genetic counseling and advance personalized medicine in CRC prevention 
and treatment.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy 
with limited treatment options. While immunotherapy has revolutionized SCLC 
therapy and now serves as a front-line treatment, the disease continues to 
present significant clinical challenges. Despite therapeutic advances in lung 
cancer over the past decade, most SCLC tumors eventually reoccur. Growing 
insights into the tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME) highlights its critical 
role in SCLC progression and therapeutic resistance. In this review, we 
summarize distinctive features of the TIME in SCLC and evaluate current 
immunotherapeutic strategies, notably immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), that 
have demonstrated survival benefits in a subset of patients. Furthermore, we 
explore emerging immunotherapeutic approaches and novel targets in SCLC, 
emphasizing the challenges limiting the successful application of immunotherapy 
in this disease.

BACKGROUND: HPV-negative (-) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a 
highly heterogeneous cancer characterized by high mutational burden, an 
immunosuppressive microenvironment, and poor response to standard therapies. 
These features highlight the urgent need for novel and more effective treatment 
strategies.
METHODS: Drug sensitivity prediction was performed using integrated datasets 
from TCGA, GDSC, and CCLE. To assess the therapeutic potential and underlying 
mechanisms of combining the CDK inhibitor AZD5438 with the MEK1/2 inhibitor 
PD0325901, we employed a comprehensive panel of HNSCC models, including 
established cell lines, orthotopic mouse tumor models, and patient-derived 
organoids (PDOs). Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) were engineered to co-deliver both 
agents into the same cancer cell populations. The tumor secretome was profiled 
using biotinylation coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS). Molecular alterations were examined by immunofluorescence, 
immunohistochemistry, ELISA, flow cytometry, and Western blot.
RESULTS: Our bioinformatics analysis identified AZD5438 and PD0325901 as two of 
thirteen candidate drugs whose sensitivity is consistently associated with the 
five most frequently mutated genes in HPV (-) HNSCC. Notably, among these 
candidates, AZD5438 and PD0325901 exhibited the lowest correlation in their 
sensitivity profiles, suggesting complementary mechanisms of action. In 
experimental models, the combination of AZD5438 and PD0325901 not only 
outperformed either monotherapy in suppressing tumor growth but also augmented 
CD8⁺ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity by promoting caspase-8/gasdermin 
E-dependent pyroptosis. Furthermore, in both orthotopic tumor-bearing mice and 
PDOs, the LNP-encapsulated drug combination produced significantly greater 
therapeutic efficacy compared with the free drug formulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the combination of AZD5438 and PD0325901 
holds therapeutic potential for the treatment of HPV (-) HNSCC, particularly in 
tumors with a high mutational burden. By targeting complementary pathways, this 
combination may improve treatment outcomes in this aggressive cancer subtype.

BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma (UVM) is the most common primary intraocular 
malignancy, poses a formidable challenge due to its high metastatic potential 
and grim prognosis, but limited treatment options for UVM have prompted studies 
on immunotherapies. Cuproptosis is a recently discovered form of regulated cell 
death that has emerged as a potential regulator of the tumor microenvironment 
(TME) and a modulator of cancer development. However, the association between 
cuproptosis and UVM remains unclear.
METHODS: Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to 
identify cuproptosis genes. Transcriptome correlation analysis and differential 
analysis were conducted following consensus clustering on 221 UVM samples. The 
objective was to identify cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs). Employing the LASSO 
Cox regression method, the identified CRGs were utilized to formulate a 
prognostic model termed CRG_score. Functional enrichment analysis was conducted 
to explore the biological processes linked to the CRG_score. Additionally, the 
research delved into the association between CRG_score and the responsiveness to 
chemotherapy drugs like docetaxel and etoposide. We also explored the effect of 
cuproptosis on UVM at the cellular level.
RESULTS: UVM patients were classified into two distinct cuproptosis clusters, 
each exhibiting unique clinicopathological characteristics, prognostic outcomes, 
immune checkpoint expression levels, and immune infiltration patterns. CRGs were 
used to develop a prognostic model, CRG_score, with eight pivotal CRGs that 
accurately predicted the prognosis of UVM (AUC = 0.895). The single-cell RNA 
sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis further confirmed the high tumor cell 
specificity of these eight model genes, validating the rationale for 
constructing the CRG_score. Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the 
CRG_score is associated with pathways involving cell signaling, immune 
responses, and metabolic regulation. A low CRG_score was associated with a 
favorable response to chemotherapy drugs such as docetaxel and etoposide. In 
cellular experiments, it was observed that the cuproptosis inducer elesclomol 
can impede the growth and proliferation of UVM cells, causing cell cycle arrest 
at the G2/M phase, as well as prompting apoptosis and the accumulation of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS).
CONCLUSION: Compared to several previous studies, we have extended the search 
for CRGs very rigorously in order to increase the value of cuproptosis in the 
prognosis and treatment of UVM. This whole transcriptome analysis elucidates the 
crucial role of cuproptosis-related molecular subtypes in the prognosis of UVM, 
highlights its association with the TME, and provides a scientific basis for 
clinical drug decisions.

BACKGROUND: RAS mutations, present in 40-50% of metastatic colorectal cancer 
(mCRC) cases, drive oncogenic signaling and confer resistance to anti-EGFR 
therapies. Tumor mutational burden (TMB), a marker of genomic instability, has 
recently emerged as a predictive biomarker of response to immunotherapy. 
However, the prognostic interaction between RAS status and TMB in mCRC remains 
poorly defined.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 108 patients with microsatellite-stable 
metastatic colon cancer (mCC). Tumor samples were profiled using the TruSight 
Oncology® platform. Eligible patients had an ECOG Performance Status < 2, a 
cachexia risk score < 1, and no peritoneal carcinomatosis. TMB and RAS mutation 
status were assessed, and the prognostic significance of the different RAS/TMB 
combinations was evaluated for overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier and Cox 
proportional hazards models. Biological differences across selected subgroups 
were explored using Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Phenolyzer network 
analyses.
RESULTS: RAS mutations were associated with reduced OS (46.4 vs. 67.9 months for 
mutant vs. wild-type; HR 1.76; P = 0.0495). Stratified analysis showed that the 
adverse effect of RAS mutations was restricted to patients with low TMB (< 10 
mutations/Mb). The subgroup with both RAS mutations and low TMB had the poorest 
OS (28.0 months; HR 2.34; P = 0.0058), whereas patients with either RAS 
wild-type or high TMB showed comparable survival. GO analysis revealed 
enrichment of receptor-mediated signaling pathways in RAS-mutant/TMB-low tumors. 
Phenolyzer highlighted distinct molecular networks, with APC, TP53, and ERBB2 as 
central hubs in RAS-mutant/TMB-low tumors, and APC, TP53, and BRCA1 in 
RAS-wild-type/TMB-high tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a prognostic interaction between RAS 
mutations and TMB in mCC, identifying the RAS-mutant/TMB-low subgroup as having 
the poorest outcomes. Integrative bioinformatic analyses suggest distinct 
biological mechanisms underlying these differences. These findings support the 
development of tailored therapeutic and monitoring strategies for specific 
molecular subgroups.

BACKGROUND: Adaptation to hypoxia is essential for cancer survival and is linked 
to poor prognosis and treatment resistance. This adaptation triggers the 
expression of genes that promote angiogenesis and metabolic reprogramming, 
collectively enhancing cancer cell survival, tumor growth, migration and 
metastasis. Consequently, there is an urgent need for innovative strategies to 
inhibit tumor adaptation to hypoxic conditions.
METHODS: The public database cBioPortal was utilized to analyze tankyrase mRNA 
alteration profiles across various cancer types, and the correlation between 
TNKS/2 and HIF1A expression was assessed using the GEPIA platform. The effects 
of TNKS1/2 inhibition or silencing on HIF-1α stabilization and activation were 
evaluated through western blotting and RT-qPCR analysis of HIF-target genes. To 
gain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of tankyrase elimination on 
hypoxia-driven gene expression, RNA-seq was also conducted. The effects on cell 
fitness and the functional consequences of tankyrase silencing in tumor cell 
adaptation to hypoxia were examined by measuring glycolysis through ECAR and 
lactate assays, along with apoptosis, colony formation and migration and 
invasion assays. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which tankyrases 
influence hypoxic signaling, we employed a range of approaches, including 
polysome profiling, mRNA half-life assays, reporter luciferase assays to analyze 
the HIF-1α promoter, and proximity ligation assays to explore the effect of 
tankyrase elimination on the interaction between HIF-1α and its inhibitory 
protein FIH-1.
RESULTS: In the present study, we investigated the role of TNKS1 and TNKS2 as 
modulators of the hypoxic response. Notably, we found that tankyrases 
participate in the regulation of both HIF-1α levels (through fine-tuning HIF1A 
mRNA expression) and hypoxia-induced gene expression (through alteration of 
HIF-1α binding to FIH-1). Global RNA-seq revealed a specific impairment of the 
hypoxia-induced metabolic switch to glycolysis, with consequences for metabolic 
adaptation and cell fitness following TNKS1/2 silencing. These effects were 
independent of tankyrase catalytic activity.
CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal a novel role for tankyrases in regulating tumor 
cell adaptation to hypoxia. This new mechanism operates independently of their 
catalytic activity, underscoring the potential of strategies that target 
tankyrases interaction with multiple partners through the ankyrin domain and 
holding promise for the development of new therapeutic advances to counter tumor 
adaptation to hypoxia.

already promoted the research of tumorigenesis as well as development and have 
partly elucidated the evolutionary processes of lung cancer. However, it is 
still difficult to distinguish these confounding features via single dimensional 
approaches due to the complexity, heterogeneity and cell-cell interactions with 
the immune microenvironment in lung cancer. Multi-omics approaches provide a 
holistic framework for constructing detailed tumor ecosystem landscapes, thereby 
facilitating the development of a more robust classification system for 
precision diagnosis and treatment, and aiding in the discovery of novel cancer 
biomarkers. In this review, we summarize the potential and applications of 
multi-omics approaches in characterizing intratumor heterogeneity and the tumor 
microenvironment throughout the course of lung cancer development. By further 
discussing the discovery and application of diagnostic and therapeutic 
biomarkers across precancerous lesions, early-stage lung cancer, tumor 
progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance, we outline the current 
challenges and future prospects of using multi-omics to identify reliable 
biomarkers. Moreover, we emphasize that integrative multi-omics models hold 
great promise for elucidating the complex interactions within the lung cancer 
ecosystem, thereby contributing to improved diagnostic accuracy, optimized 
therapeutic strategies, and better patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy does not benefit all non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, and reliable biomarkers are urgently needed. We 
conducted this prospective phase II trial of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy to 
explore the role of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) features in pathological response 
assessment.
METHODS: Totally, 100 patients with stage IIB-IIIB NSCLC were enrolled and 
treated with neoadjuvant toripalimab plus chemotherapy for at least 2 cycles. 
Targeted methylation panel sequencing and whole methylome sequencing were 
conducted on 195 cfDNA samples collected from 60 patients before each treatment 
cycle (C0, C1) and before surgery (BS), with subsequent calculations of 
methylation fragment ratio (MFR) and chromosome aneuploid of featured fragment 
(CAFF) scores, respectively. The correlations between MFR or CAFF and 
pathological response were evaluated.
RESULTS: Finally, 83 patients underwent surgery, and 54 (65.1%) patients 
achieved major pathological response (MPR), including 38 (45.8%) with complete 
pathological response (pCR). The median MFR and CAFF scores in both the MPR and 
non-MPR groups significantly decreased after the first cycle, and the MPR group 
maintained low levels before surgery (P < 0.001). According to pre-defined 
cut-off values, the MFR and CAFF scores were recategorized as low or high 
status. Patients with low MFR status at BS (74.5% vs. 11.1%, P < 0.001) or low 
CAFF status at C1 (73.9% vs. 36.4%, P = 0.031) and BS (76.2% vs. 38.9%, 
P = 0.008) were more likely to achieve MPR than those with high status. Three 
dynamic patterns were identified: C0 low, C0 high/C1 low, and C0 high/C1 high. 
These patterns were further divided by BS low or high status, which indicated 
distinctive MPR rate (C0 low: BS low vs. high 78.9% vs 0%; C0 high/C1 low: BS 
low vs. high 73.9% vs. 25%; C0 high/C1 high: BS low vs. high 83.3% vs. 0%). An 
integrative model was constructed by incorporating immune parameters (PD-L1 and 
CD8 + CD28- T lymphocytes) and cfDNA features (MFR and CAFF) at C1 and BS, 
achieving an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI 0.80-0.92).
CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic monitoring of cfDNA methylation has potential to predict 
pathological response of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in NSCLC.

Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is a significant subtype of head and 
neck cancers, with tobacco and alcohol being primary risk factors. Many studies 
have shown that human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), specifically HERV-K and 
HERV-H, have been implicated in the development and progression of various 
cancers, including head and neck cancers; nevertheless, there is a lack of 
research on the expression levels of HERV-K and HERV-H in LSCC. In this 
research, the differential expression of HERV-K Rec, Env, Np9, and HERV-H pol 
transcripts was assessed in 144 laryngeal biopsy specimens (72 polyps and 72 
LSCC samples) utilizing quantitative Real-time PCR. The results showed a 
significant upregulation of HERV-K Env and HERV-H pol in the LSCC group compared 
to the polyp group (p < 0.001), suggesting their potential role in LSCC 
progression. The ROC curve analysis further supported the diagnostic 
significance of HERV-H pol and HERV-K Env transcripts in distinguishing LSCC 
from noncancerous polyps (HERV-H pol: AUC = 0.86; HERV-K Env: AUC = 0.76). 
Moreover, being over 50 years old and having an opium addiction were linked to 
increased expression levels of HERV-H Pol and HERV-K Env, suggesting a potential 
connection between these elements and laryngeal cancer (p < 0.001). These 
results highlight the possible utility of HERV-H pol and HERV-K Env as 
biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of LSCC. Undoubtedly, additional 
research is imperative to establish the clinical efficacy of these biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Probiotics, particularly Lactobacillus species, show promise as 
adjuvants in cancer therapy due to their pro-apoptotic effects. This study 
investigated the synergistic impact of Lactobacillus fermentum (Ab.RS23) and 
vincristine sulfate on colorectal (HT-29) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cells.
METHODS: Cells were treated with vincristine, L. fermentum, or both. Cell 
viability was measured by MTT assay. Apoptosis was analyzed via Annexin 
V-FITC/PI flow cytometry. Gene expression changes were evaluated by RT-qPCR.
RESULTS: Co-treatment reduced the IC₅₀ of vincristine by 8-fold in HT-29 and 
13-fold in MCF-7 cells. Apoptotic signaling was enhanced, with pro-apoptotic 
pathways upregulated and survival pathways downregulated.
CONCLUSION: L. fermentum enhanced vincristine-induced apoptosis and reduced the 
required drug dose, which may contribute to lowering vincristine-associated 
toxicity. These findings require confirmation through in vivo studies.

BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key regulators of the tumor 
microenvironment, yet their spatial organization and immunomodulatory functions 
in H. pylori-associated gastric cancer (GC) remain incompletely understood.
METHODS: We profiled formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumors from 71 GC 
patients using spatial transcriptomics and integrated single-cell RNA-seq from 
three independent cohorts (China, USA, and Singapore). CAF-immune cell 
colocalization was quantified by neighborhood enrichment and aggregation index 
score. Ligand-receptor inference and trajectory analysis resolved CAF signaling 
and state transitions. To delineate post-transcriptional control, ARE-motif 
scanning and expression correlations were combined with laser-assisted 
crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing (LACE-seq) to nominate ZFP36 
targets. Immune contexture and prognostic associations were evaluated using 
CIBERSORT-ABS and Kaplan-Meier analyses in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 
Asian Cancer Research Group (ACRG) cohorts.
RESULTS: We first defined the spatial distributions of the four CAF subtypes 
reported in prior studies and found that their immune associations varied across 
histologic and infection-defined GC subtypes. In H. pylori-positive tumors, 
THBS1⁺ CAFs were spatially enriched near regulatory T cells (Tregs) and were 
associated with local immunosuppression through WNT5-FZD interactions. In 
parallel, ZFP36 bound AU-rich elements within the FN1 3' untranslated region 
(3'UTR), destabilizing FN1 mRNA and thereby diminishing FN1⁺ CAF-mediated 
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation. Together, these axes promoted Treg 
accumulation and suppression of CTL activation.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal infection-associated stromal programs that 
shape the immune landscape in GC and highlight CAF-directed pathways as 
potential therapeutic targets in H. pylori-associated GC.

Although cisplatin (CDDP) remains a widely used chemotherapeutic agent in 
clinical cancer treatment, severe oxidative stress and inflammatory responses 
induced by CDDP are still major causes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients. 
Our previous studies have demonstrated that anthocyanins and selenocysteine 
(SeC) exhibit potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we 
successfully synthesized a synergistic nanotherapeutic, 
cyanidin-3-O-glucoside-functionalized SeC nanoparticles (C3G@SeC NPs), which 
significantly alleviated CDDP-induced damage in HK-2 cells by inhibiting 
oxidative stress and ferroptosis. In vivo, C3G@SeC NPs alleviated AKI by 
regulating the MAPK and ferroptosis pathways. Furthermore, C3G@SeC NPs regulated 
the populations of M2 macrophages, Treg cells, CD4+ T cells, MDSCs, and NK cells 
disrupted by CDDP in the kidney and spleen tissues of AKI mice, ultimately 
inhibiting the inflammatory response. In summary, this study synthesizes a 
synergistic nanotherapeutic and systematically elucidates its anti-AKI 
mechanisms, indicating C3G@SeC NPs may be an ideal nanoparticle for alleviating 
CDDP nephrotoxicity.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer remains a major threat to women's health worldwide. 
Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) drives immune evasion in a variety of 
cancers, but its expression pattern, clinical significance, and immunoregulatory 
mechanisms in cervical cancer have not been clarified.
METHODS: DDR1 expression profiles were resolved based on TCGA and GEPIA2 
databases; DDR1-related pathways were enriched by GO/KEGG/GSEA; 
immunohistochemistry was performed in 40 cases of cervical cancer and 20 cases 
of normal tissues to assess the association of the DDR1 protein with 
clinicopathological features and survival prognosis for clinical validation. In 
addition, the biological role of DDR1 in cervical cancer was detected by Western 
blot, CCK8 and transwell.
RESULTS: DDR1 was significantly overexpressed in cervical cancer and correlated 
with advanced FIGO stage and poor overall survival; DDR1 can promote the 
proliferation and migration of cervical cancer cells, and at the same time 
affect immune escape by reshaping the tumor microenvironment and metabolic 
reprogramming.
CONCLUSION: DDR1 is able to remodel the immunosuppressive microenvironment. 
Targeting DDR1 may overcome immune escape and provide a new therapeutic strategy 
for cervical cancer.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to assess the level of knowledge about skin 
cancer and sun exposure among Emirati undergraduate students and evaluate the 
sun protection behaviors practiced by these students.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 455 undergraduate students 
from 17 campuses of one of the largest higher education institutions in the UAE. 
Data were collected using a structured survey comprising sociodemographic 
characteristics and two validated scales: the Skin Cancer and Sun Knowledge 
Scale (SCSKS) and the Sun Protection Behavior Scale (SPBS).
RESULTS: Participants demonstrated a moderate level of knowledge, with a mean 
SCSKS score of 13.01. The mean SPBS score was 25.60 out of 40, with notable 
variation across specific behaviors. The most frequently reported practice was 
sunscreen use, with 41.3% of participants indicating they “always” used it. In 
contrast, hat use was among the least practiced behaviors, with 100% of 
participants reporting they ""never"" wore a wide-brimmed hat and 41.3% stating 
they ""never"" wore a hat at all. Female students reported higher levels of 
sunscreen use and sun avoidance, while male students were more likely to wear 
hats. No significant correlation was found between knowledge and sun avoidance 
behaviors.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights a gap between knowledge and behavior in 
relation to sun protection. Despite a moderate level of awareness about skin 
cancer and the risks of sun exposure, students do not consistently engage in 
protective behaviors. These findings highlight the need for targeted educational 
interventions that not only raise awareness but also encourage sustained 
behavioral change. Public health initiatives should adopt culturally relevant, 
gender-sensitive strategies to encourage the consistent use of multiple sun 
protection methods.

BACKGROUND: Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is an antibody-drug conjugate 
(ADC) that targets human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and delivers 
a topoisomerase inhibitor payload. T-DXd has been effectively used to treat 
metastatic breast cancer but causes pneumonitis in 10–15% of cases. Risk factors 
associated with T-DXd pneumonitis are not well described.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the major clinical risk factors for T-DXd 
pneumonitis?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of women with 
metastatic breast cancer at our institution treated with T-DXd as standard of 
care between 2020 and 2024. We collected clinical data, including demographics, 
relevant review of symptoms, molecular subtypes, prior treatments, and pulmonary 
comorbidities, from the electronic health record. A thoracic radiologist 
reviewed pre-treatment scans for the presence of interstitial lung abnormalities 
(ILAs). Radiation exposure variables were obtained from an institutional 
database. Pulmonologists reviewed all cases for the development of pneumonitis. 
We used univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models to measure 
the association of clinical variables with the development of pneumonitis.
RESULTS: Pneumonitis was observed in 19/203 patients (9.4%). In univariable 
analyses, pre-treatment shortness of breath (hazard ratio [HR] 3.9, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 1.3–11.7), greater number of prior treatments (HR 1.2 
per line, 95% CI 1.0-1.4), triple-negative breast cancer (HR 4.9, 95% CI 
1.8–13.0), low HER-2 status (4.00 (95% CI: 1.43–11.11) and pre-treatment ILAs 
(HR 17, 95% CI 6.5–46) were associated with pneumonitis. In multivariable 
models, pre-treatment ILAs (HR 10.56, 95% CI 3.8-29.31, p < 0.0001) and HER2 (HR 
0.30, 95% CI 0.09–0.96, p = 0.042) were the strongest predictors of pneumonitis, 
with a marginal association observed for V20 (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99–1.09, 
p = 0.081).
INTERPRETATION: Pre-treatment ILAs and HER2-low breast cancer are major risk 
factors for T-DXd pneumonitis.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health burden, 
ranked among the most common causes of cancer-related fatalities. While insulin 
resistance (IR) biomarkers have been associated with CRC prognosis, their role 
in predicting metastasis remains unclear. Metastasis remains a critical 
determinant of prognosis and treatment planning in CRC. Identifying precise 
biomarkers can improve CRC management. This study evaluates the prognostic 
efficacy of lipid-based IR biomarkers in predicting metastasis in 
treatment-naïve CRC patients and selects the most appropriate one. We also 
explore their association with clinicopathological characteristics.
METHOD: Eighty-seven CRC patients (metastatic, n = 24; non-metastatic, n = 63) 
from four tertiary hospitals in India were analysed. Clinical data included TNM 
staging, ECOG-PS, KPS, CEA, and lipid profiles. Statistical tests included 
Fisher’s exact test, Mann-Whitney U-test, ROC curve analysis, Spearman’s 
correlation, multiple linear regression, and binary logistic regression.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed in job status, 
diet, smoking, alcohol use, diabetes, BMI, and IR markers between metastatic and 
non-metastatic CRC patients. Among the IR biomarkers, the ratio of LDL to HDL 
(LHR) demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy with an AUC of 0.867 
(p < 0.05, CI: 0.79–0.94), a sensitivity of 83.3%, and a specificity of 74.6%. 
Spearman correlation analysis unveiled a moderate-positive relationship between 
IR biomarkers and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, except for the 
triglyceride glucose index (TyG). Binary logistic regression identified LHR as 
the sole significant predictor of metastasis, with a one-unit increase in LHR 
corresponding to a 19.35% higher likelihood of metastasis. Multiple linear 
regression confirmed a moderate, significant combined effect of TNM staging, 
ECOG-PS, KPS, and LHR.
CONCLUSION: LHR strongly predicts metastasis in CRC patients, with high 
sensitivity and specificity among IR biomarkers. Its significant association 
with TNM staging, ECOG-PS, and CEA levels highlights its potential for early 
detection of metastasis and improved risk stratification. Larger studies are 
needed to validate its clinical utility for personalised treatment planning.

PURPOSE: We conducted an assessment to investigate the impact of prostate volume 
on the recurrence of patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). 
Subsequently, we developed and validated nomograms to accurately evaluate 
recurrence in NMIBC patients. Additionally, we examined the potential 
improvement in predictive capability achieved by introducing prostate volume as 
a variable in the model.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis, enrolling 555 eligible patients 
from seven independent medical institutions across China. We first evaluate 
recurrence-free survival outcomes in patients with varying prostate volumes. 
Subsequently, we divided patients into a training cohort and an external 
validation cohort. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were 
conducted within the training cohort. Accordingly, two nomogram models with and 
without prostate volumes were developed. Their performance was compared by 
concordance index, calibration curves, receiver operating characteristics 
curves, and decision curve analysis. Furthermore, a risk classification model 
utilizing the nomogram incorporating prostate volume was developed.
RESULTS: The 3-year recurrence-free survival was markedly lower in patients with 
large prostate volumes (> 30 ml) compared to those with relatively small 
prostate volumes (< 30 ml) (p < 0.001). The AUC for the model incorporating 
prostate volume at 3 years in the training cohort and external validation cohort 
was 0.828 and 0.811, surpassing the AUC for the model excluding prostate volume 
at the corresponding intervals, which was 0.796 and 0.778. The 1- and 2-year AUC 
for the two models also exhibited similar differences. The decision curve 
analysis results demonstrated the significant superiority of the nomogram 
incorporating prostate volume over the one without it.
CONCLUSION: Our investigation revealed that prostate volume significantly 
influences recurrence in patients with NMIBC. We successfully developed a more 
accurate nomogram by introducing prostate volume as a variable and provided new 
insights to further guide clinical management and individualized treatment of 
NMIBC patients.

BACKGROUND: Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common renal tumor in children, with 
prognosis varying widely due to multiple factors. This study aims to identify 
key prognostic factors in WT, with a particular focus on pathological grade.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 186 WT patients diagnosed between 2000 and 
2021 using SEER database. Clinical and pathological factors such as age, tumor 
grade, and SEER stage were assessed for their impact on overall survival (OS) 
and cancer-specific survival using Cox regression models. The SEER stage was 
categorized as localized, regional, or distant. A nomogram was developed based 
on these factors to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS, and its predictive accuracy 
was evaluated.
RESULTS: Of the total, 94 patients had grade I-III tumors, while 92 had grade IV 
tumors. Univariate analysis revealed that older age (p < 0.001), higher grade 
(p = 0.011), distant metastasis (p < 0.001), and larger tumor size (p = 0.025) 
were associated with poorer prognosis. Multivariate analysis confirmed age at 
diagnosis (p < 0.001), tumor grade (p = 0.008), and stage (p = 0.004) as 
independent prognostic factors for OS. In the grade IV subgroup, patients had a 
higher rate of distant metastasis (37.0%), which significantly worsened their 
prognosis (p = 0.004). The nomogram demonstrated a strong predictive accuracy, 
with a C-index of 0.796 and AUC values of 0.886, 0.790, and 0.835 for predicting 
1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival, respectively. Calibration and decision 
curve analyses further validated the model’s reliability.
CONCLUSION: WT prognosis is closely associated with age, tumor grade, and SEER 
stage. The nomogram developed in this study serves as a reliable tool for 
predicting long-term survival in WT patients, aiding in clinical management and 
personalized treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide variants are important factors involved in lung 
cancer onset and prognosis. In Cuba, there are scarce studies evaluating the 
possible association between genetic variants and lung cancer. Here, we 
described the frequency distribution of genetic variants in DNA repair related 
genes and assessed their impact on lung cancer susceptibility and survival 
prognosis in a cohort of Cuban population METHODS: Case-Control study included 
300 lung cancer patients and 300 control subjects. Variants: rs1042522, 
rs11016879, rs13181, rs25487 and rs861539 were genotyped. The association 
analysis was evaluated by logistic regression and the impact on overall survival 
was estimated by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses.
RESULTS: Genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium except for 
rs1042522 in patients. The heterozygote of this variant was associated with low 
risk to lung cancer (Overdominant, OR: 0.53, p = 0.01). Conversely, rs25487 
showed trend to additive genotype risk (Additive model, OR:1.61, p = 0.01). 
Differences in genotype frequencies according to skin color of controls were 
detected for rs1042522 and rs861539 (p = 0.01). The rs11016879 and rs1042522 
showed joint protective effects with skin color. Interaction between rs25487 and 
cigarette smoking analysis revealed higher lung cancer risk (OR = 3.72, 
p = 0.03, p-interaction: 0.01). Interaction between alcohol consumption and 
rs13181 reached borderline significance for decreased risk of lung cancer 
(OR = 0.25, p = 0.03, p-interaction: 0.06). In addition, rs11016879 alternative 
allele was an independent factor for higher mean 5-years overall survival 
(log-rank test p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: The study provides the first data evaluating the relevance of 
genetic variants in DNA damage repair related genes for lung cancer management 
in Cuban population. Our findings indicate a significant contribution of the 
genetic variants to lung cancer susceptibility and highlights the importance of 
considering skin color within analyses for disease susceptibility in Cuban 
population.

BACKGROUND: Although the number of clinical trials on lung cancer is rapidly 
increasing, the clinical benefits have not received sufficient attention. This 
study aims to assess the clinical benefits and estimate the minimal clinically 
important differences (MCIDs) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free 
survival (PFS) to provide quantitative guidance for treatment decisions and 
study design in lung cancer trials.
METHODS: This study systematically searched lung cancer randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. The clinical 
benefits were estimated using the frameworks of the European Society for Medical 
Oncology - Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) and the American 
Society of Clinical Oncology - Value Framework (ASCO-VF). The MCIDs for OS and 
PFS were calculated using the distribution-based method. The differences in 
clinical benefits of lung cancer trials between the MCIDs and the two frameworks 
were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 319 lung cancer RCTs were included. The mean improved OS and 
PFS were 2.28 and 1.76 months between the interventional and control groups, 
respectively. Around 15.79% of trials with OS as the primary endpoint were rated 
as grades 4 or above, and only 6.02% of trials with PFS as the primary endpoint 
reached grade 4 by ESMO-MCBS. The overall MCIDs for OS and PFS in non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) were 7.66 and 3.11 months, while 2.29 and 1.13 months in 
small cell lung cancer (SCLC), respectively. A total of 79.61% of RCTs 
evaluating OS (5.92% with clinical benefits and 73.68% without clinical 
benefits) and 68.26% evaluating PFS (3.59% with clinical benefits and 64.67% 
without clinical benefits) were consistently identified as reaching clinical 
benefits by the MCIDs and two frameworks.
CONCLUSIONS: Although lung cancer RCTs showed statistically significant 
improvement in OS and PFS, most trials did not show clinical benefits, with a 
limited increase in survival months. A fair-to-moderate consistency of clinical 
benefits classification was observed between the MCIDs and the two frameworks. 
Further explorations into MCID are anticipated to deepen our understanding and 
promote its application in the future.

BACKGROUND: The interplay between nutritional and inflammatory status and 
sedentary behavior is intricate, and both are associated with the prognosis of 
cancer survivors. However, the combined effect of these factors on the mortality 
rate of cancer survivors remains unclear.
METHODS: We selected cancer survivors from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (2007-2018). The Naples Prognostic Score (NPS) was used as an 
integrated marker of inflammatory and nutritional status, while sedentary 
behavior was quantified based on self-reported daily sitting time. Multivariable 
Cox proportional hazards models were employed to examine the independent and 
combined associations of NPS and sedentary behavior with mortality outcomes in 
this population.
RESULTS: Among 2,411 cancer survivors followed for a median of 71 months, 554 
deaths occurred (cancer, 190; non-cancer, 364). High NPS correlated with higher 
all-cause, cancer-specific, and non-cancer mortality. Longer sedentary time was 
independently linked to higher all-cause and non-cancer mortality, with each 
additional hour of sitting per day conferring a significant rise in risk. 
Survivors exhibiting both high NPS and ≥ 6 h/day of sedentary behavior faced the 
greatest mortality risks: all-cause (hazard ratio [HR] 4.44, 95% CI: 2.66-7.42), 
cancer-specific (HR 1.92 95% CI: 1.11-3.32), and non-cancer (HR 2.81, 95% CI: 
1.76-4.50).
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that nutritional and inflammatory status 
and sedentary behavior collectively influence mortality risk in cancer 
survivors. Patients exhibiting concurrent poor nutrition, systemic inflammation 
(high NPS), and sedentary behavior may be at higher risk of death.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a crucial role in the 
progression and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). This study investigates 
the molecular mechanisms of EMT and its prognostic biomarkers in CRC.
METHODS: Multi-omics bioinformatics analyses were conducted using CRC 
transcriptomic datasets from GEO and TCGA. EMT-related differentially expressed 
genes (EMT-DEGs) were identified and subjected to pathway enrichment and machine 
learning-based prognostic modeling. COMP was selected as a hub gene for further 
validation. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were also analyzed to 
determine the cell-type-specific expression pattern of COMP and EMT-DEGs. 
Clinical CRC tissue samples were analyzed via RT-qPCR, Western blot, and 
histology. Functional assays in HT-29 cells assessed the effects of COMP 
knockdown on EMT markers, proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration.
RESULTS: EMT was significantly enriched in CRC, with 36 EMT-DEGs identified. 
These DEGs were enriched in pathways such as ECM-receptor interaction, focal 
adhesion, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Among the constructed machine 
learning models, the random survival forest (RSF) model demonstrated the 
strongest ability to predict CRC prognosis. This model stratified CRC patients 
into high-risk and low-risk groups, with poorer prognosis observed in the 
high-risk group. Cox regression forest plots and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
identified COMP as a top EMT-related prognostic gene enriched in pathways 
including ECM-receptor interaction and PI3K-Akt signaling. High COMP expression 
correlated with poor patient prognosis and EMT marker dysregulation in 
metastatic CRC tissues. In vitro, COMP knockdown significantly reduced 
mesenchymal markers, restored E-cadherin, and inhibited proliferation and 
invasion of CRC cells.
CONCLUSION: EMT plays a vital role in CRC progression and metastasis, with COMP 
identified as a key prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target. This 
study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms and intervention 
strategies for CRC metastasis.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women globally, 
with 2.3 million new cases in 2022. Advances in early detection and treatment 
have improved survival, but long-term complications like breast cancer-related 
lymphoedema (BCRL) remain underrecognized. Affecting 6-40% of patients following 
axillary lymph node dissection, BCRL leads to chronic swelling, pain, and 
reduced quality of life. The risk is heightened in low- and middle-income 
countries (LMICs), where delayed diagnosis and limited awareness necessitate 
more aggressive interventions. Despite its profound physical, psychosocial, and 
economic impact, BCRL remains understudied in LMICs, highlighting the need for 
region-specific data and preventive strategies.
METHODS: This prospective observational study, which was conducted in a tertiary 
care centre over 18 months (July 2022-December 2023), aimed to identify 
clinicopathological predictors of the development of early ipsilateral arm 
lymphoedema in patients undergoing Modified radical mastectomy (MRM). We 
diagnosed lymphoedema via circumferential measurements (≥ 10% increase in 
ipsilateral arm) at 1 day pre-surgery and followed up the patients at 1-, 3-, 
and 6-months post-surgery. Variables included patient demographics, tumour 
characteristics, and treatment factors.
RESULTS: We recruited 80 patients, and 21 of them (26.25%) developed lymphoedema 
in 6 month period, with significant predictors identified as BMI (mean 28.42 vs. 
26.04 kg/m2, p = 0.008), Left-sided tumours (40% vs. 18% for 
right-sided, p = 0.03), number of lymph nodes removed (mean 21.14 vs. 
13.49, p = 0.003), and positive lymph nodes (mean 3.81 vs. 1.15, p = 0.009), 
Axillary radiation (55% vs. 16.7%, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed 
BMI (aOR = 1.19, 95%CI:1.00-1.42; p = 0.045), total lymph nodes removed 
(aOR = 1.08, 95%CI:1.01-1.15; p = 0.027), and axillary radiation (aOR = 4.57, 
95%CI:1.37-15.26; p = 0.013) as independent predictors, while positive lymph 
nodes lost significance when adjusted for confounders (aOR = 1.04, p = 0.718). 
Age, hormone receptor status, and chemotherapy type showed no significant 
associations.
CONCLUSION: The study highlights the critical role of pre-operative risk 
stratification. These findings underscore the need for personalized surgical and 
adjuvant strategies to mitigate Lymphoedema risk, enhancing long-term 
survivorship care in breast cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer (TC) incidence is rapidly increasing, ranking as the 
third most common cancer in China. This study aimed to investigate the 
association between light at night (LAN), air pollutants, and TC risk among the 
rural population in Fujian Province, China, from 2012 to 2016.
METHODS: This study utilized 23,111 first reimbursement records of TC patients 
from the New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NRCMS) in Fujian Province between 
2012 and 2016 to calculate county-level hospitalization rates. The performance 
of geographically weighted regression (GWR), multiscale geographically weighted 
regression (MGWR), and geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) 
models were compared to identify the best model for investigating the effects of 
LAN, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), urbanization, and number of medical and 
technical personnel per 1000 population (NMTP) on the hospitalization rates of 
TC in 74 counties.
RESULTS: TC hospitalization rates exhibited an initial increase followed by a 
decline, with higher rates in eastern coastal and southern regions. Spatial 
clustering was observed (Global Moran's I: 0.152-0.284). The GTWR model 
performed best (R2 = 0.821), showing positive correlations between LAN, NMTP, 
and TC, while urbanization was negatively correlated. LAN had a strong effect on 
TC in the north, while NMTP had a strong effect in the east. NO2 and TC remained 
positively correlated in all regions except the south, and O3 was consistently 
positively correlated with hospitalization rates in the southern region and the 
eastern seaboard.
CONCLUSIONS: LAN, NO2, O3, urbanization, and NMTP exhibit significant 
spatiotemporal associations with TC risk in the rural population of Fujian 
Province. Targeted interventions are needed to reduce the TC burden based on 
regional risk factors.

OBJECTIVES: This study assesses the prognostic value of the controlling 
nutritional status score (CONUT) in colorectal cancer patients.
METHODS: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, 
and Cochrane databases until December 2024. The primary outcomes were overall 
survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and relapse-free survival (RFS). 
Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used for data 
synthesis. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were used to assess the results 
stability and heterogeneity sources. All statistical analyses were performed 
using Review Manager 5.4 and STATA 15.1.
RESULTS: Fifteen studies involving 9,258 colorectal cancer patients were 
included. Meta-analysis showed higher CONUT scores were linked to shorter OS 
(HR: 2.12; 95% CI: 1.70–2.65; P < 0.00001), DFS (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.11–2.64; 
P = 0.02), and RFS (HR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.39–2.20; P < 0.00001). Sensitivity 
analysis confirmed the stability of CONUT’s prognostic value for OS, DFS, and 
RFS. Subgroup analysis identified the CONUT cut-off value as a major factor 
contributing to OS heterogeneity.
CONCLUSIONS: CONUT appears to be associated with worse prognosis in colorectal 
cancer patients. However, due to potential publication bias, heterogeneity, and 
the retrospective study design, further large-scale, multicenter, prospective 
cohort studies are required to confirm its prognostic utility.

BACKGROUND: Conventional ultrasonography (cUS) and contrast-enhanced 
ultrasonography (CEUS) are used to evaluate breast cancer tumors and axillary 
lymph nodes (ALN), by which the treatment strategy for breast cancer is 
determined. A breast tumor size discrepancy on CEUS compared with cUS is often 
observed, for which the reasons are unclear. We hypothesized that this 
discrepancy reflects the metastatic potential, and this study investigated the 
association between size discrepancies on cUS and CEUS in relation to ALN 
metastasis in breast cancer.
METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 259 patients who underwent surgery 
for breast cancer after preoperative cUS and CEUS examinations. Patients were 
grouped into a DISCR (i.e., tumor size discrepancy ≥ 4.0 mm between CEUS and cUS 
measurements) and non-DISCR group. The primary outcome was ALN metastasis, 
defined by pathological evaluation. Secondary outcomes were the 5-year 
recurrence-free survival rates.
RESULTS: There were 94 patients in the DISCR and 165 in the non-DISCR groups. No 
tumor size differences measured by cUS were observed between two groups 
(p = 0.82), whereas the DISCR group had a significantly higher rate of ALN 
metastasis (p < 0.01). Multivariate analyses showed a discrepancy of ≥ 4.0 mm 
was a risk for ALN metastasis (odds ratio: 5.838, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
2.408-14.155). The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was lower in the DISCR 
(0.750, 95% CI: 0.632-0.868) than in the non-DISCR (0.924, 95% CI; 0.870-0.978) 
group.
CONCLUSION: An increase in contrast-enhanced ultrasonography tumor size is 
helpful for assessing axillary lymph node metastasis and prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the reproductive tract microbiota in patients with 
ovarian chocolate cysts (CC) and adenomyosis (AM) compared to controls (NC), and 
investigate the in vitro effects of representative differential bacteria on 
human endometrial stromal cells (T-HESC).
METHODS: Microbiota profiles from the cervical canal, posterior fornix, ascites, 
and endometrium of 20 CC, 20 AM, and 20 NC patients were analyzed using 16S rRNA 
sequencing. Bioinformatics analyses included diversity assessments and 
differential abundance testing using a robust consensus approach with LEfSe, 
ALDEx2, and ANCOM-BC to mitigate compositional bias. Representative bacteria 
from differential genera (Lactobacillus sp. (NC), Enterococcus sp. (AM), and a 
strain from the Enterobacteriaceae family (CC)) were co-cultured with T-HESCs. 
Cell viability (CCK-8) and transcriptomic changes (RNA-seq, GO/KEGG analysis) 
were assessed. Key DEGs were validated via qRT-PCR and ELISA.
RESULTS: Significant alterations in microbial composition and diversity were 
observed in CC and AM groups across different sites compared to NC. Our robust 
differential abundance analysis identified site-specific biomarkers, including 
Lactobacillaceae enrichment in the NC endometrium and the genus Enterococcus in 
the AM posterior fornix. RNA-seq revealed distinct transcriptomic reprogramming: 
CC co-culture altered genes like ADH1B, MYOM1, PTGFR, ACLY, enriching pathways 
like mismatch repair; AM co-culture affected CEBPB, SERPINE1, S100A1, CKS1B, 
enriching MAPK signaling and cancer pathways. Validation confirmed these changes 
at the mRNA and protein levels.
CONCLUSION: Endometriosis (CC and AM) is associated with distinct reproductive 
tract microbiota alterations. Specific bacteria linked to AM and CC impair 
endometrial stromal cell viability and induce unique transcriptomic changes in 
vitro, suggesting microbial dysbiosis contributes to endometriosis 
pathophysiology by affecting endometrial cell function.

BACKGROUND: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy originating from 
the bone marrow and affecting the germinal lymphoid B cells, resulting in 
abnormal plasma cells and end organ damage. Genetic profiling is necessary for 
risk stratification and optimized management. The genetics of MM patients in the 
Middle East, particularly in Lebanon, have been scarcely reported. This lack of 
data can adversely affect the decision-making process and the establishment of 
guidelines and standardized protocols.
METHODS: In this study, the cytogenetics of 258 Lebanese MM patients were 
analyzed using conventional karyotyping and/or Fluorescent in situ hybridization 
(FISH) technique, screening for common cytogenetic abnormalities.
RESULTS: Several abnormalities were detected on karyotypes, including complex 
karyotypes and hypodiploidy. By FISH, del(17)(p13) (10.9%) and the translocation 
t(4;14)(p16;q32) (10.9%) were the most common abnormalities observed. 
Interestingly, no t(14;16)(q32;q23) translocations were detected by FISH.
CONCLUSION: This study represents the first report on the cytogenetics of MM in 
Lebanon, highlighting both similarities and differences in the distribution of 
cytogenetic characteristics compared to other populations; and paving the way 
for more advanced cytogenomic and clinical studies. Furthermore, our study 
contributes to expanding the available data on cancer genomics in understudied 
populations, helping to bridge knowledge gaps and promote more inclusive 
precision oncology.

PURPOSE: The integration of artificial intelligence into dermatological research 
has underscored the need for robust and well-structured dermatological datasets. 
However, these datasets vary widely in their development processes, and there is 
currently no standard methodology to create such datasets. This work identifies 
three pressing needs for the building of dermatological datasets focus on skin 
tumor classification: the need for multimodal datasets, the definition of 
minimum metadata requirements, and the inclusion of underrepresented populations 
to address the scarcity of health data.
METHODS: We propose a practical methodology to create dermatological datasets 
from clinical records, incorporating both images and patient metadata. The 
process consists of four key stages: getting the institutional review board 
approval and analysis of clinical information sources, data recording and 
structuring, processing of clinical data and images, and quality assessment. 
This methodology was derived from hands-on experience in building two datasets 
from Chilean and Mexican populations, respectively.
RESULTS: The methodology allows the creation of well-structured datasets by 
simplifying data organization and enabling replication. Each step includes 
practical guidance for dealing with typical challenges, such as image metadata 
categorization and technical validation by dermatologists and computer

Post-translational modification is an important mechanism for regulating protein 
function and cell signaling networks. Among these modifications, ISGylation is a 
ubiquitin-like modification regulated by ISG15. In this review, we explore the 
role of ISGylation in a variety of related phenotypes in the tumor context, 
including apoptosis regulation, autophagy regulation, immune escape, metabolic 
reprogramming, cancer stem cell maintenance, and DNA damage repair. ISGylation 
plays a dual role in apoptosis, promoting either pro-survival or pro-death 
pathways depending on contexts. It also regulates autophagy by promoting tumor 
adaptation or by regulating immune responses. Moreover, ISGylation contributes 
to the immune escape mechanism by regulating the stability of PD-L1 and immune 
cell infiltration. In addition, ISGylation is involved in metabolic 
reprogramming, supporting tumor growth and therapeutic resistance by regulating 
key metabolic pathways. It also plays a key role in maintaining the properties 
of cancer stem cells by stabilizing essential metabolic and signaling proteins. 
In sum, this review examines the functions and mechanisms of ISG15 and 
ISGylation in various tumor-associated phenotypes, enhancing our understanding 
of their role in tumorigenesis and disease progression.

Breast cancer (BRCA) is a complex cancer with heterogeneous molecular 
mechanisms. This study aimed to identify prognostic genes related to T cell 
exhaustion and mitochondrial dysfunction in BRCA, and to construct a prognostic 
model. First, transcriptomic and clinical data for both tumor and normal samples 
were retrieved from public databases. Next, differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) were identified. These DEGs were then intersected with 2030 
mitochondrial-related genes and 683 T cell exhaustion-related genes obtained 
from relevant databases to pinpoint candidate genes. Moreover, regression 
analyses were carried out to refine the prognostic genes. A risk model was 
established to assess the risk score of BRCA patients. Cox regression analyses 
were utilized to determine the independent prognostic factors. Then a prognostic 
model was constructed. In addition, immune infiltration, drug sensitivity, and 
single-cell transcriptomics were integrated to dissect mechanisms. The 
expression of these genes in BRCA was validated by quantitative reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). From 5041 DEGs, regression 
identified 7 prognostic genes (BCL2A1, GZMB, IRF7, MTHFD2, TFRC, JUN, and 
PPP1R15A). The accurate risk model stratified patients: high-risk correlated 
with suppressed immunity (p < 2.2e-16), elevated TIDE (p = 5.4e-14), and higher 
CI.1040 IC50 (cor = 0.63, p < 0.0001). Single-cell analysis revealed 6 types and 
MIF-(CD74 + CD44) crosstalk. RT-qPCR confirmed MTHFD2, TFRC, IRF7, BCL2A1 
upregulation in tumor (p < 0.05). Risk score, age, race, N/M-stage were 
independent factors. Seven prognostic genes effectively predicted BRCA prognosis 
with independent prognostic factors.

Breast cancer remains the most prevalent malignancy among women worldwide, with 
its incidence steadily increasing. Cisplatin (Cis) is a widely used 
chemotherapeutic drug. Natural compounds such as propolis and chrysin may help 
mitigate the toxic side effects of Cis while enhancing its therapeutic efficacy. 
This study aimed to evaluate the anticancer potential of ethanolic extract of 
propolis (EEP) and chrysin (Chry) through niosomal encapsulation (Nio). The 
synergistic effects of Nio formulations in combination with low-dose Cis were 
also investigated in vivo. EEP was extracted and analyzed for its phytochemical 
composition using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Both EEP and 
Chry were loaded onto niosomes, which were then characterized by transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering, zeta potential, UV-Vis, and 
FTIR spectroscopy. Fifty adult female Swiss Albino mice were induced with 
Ehrlich carcinoma and randomly divided into ten treatment groups: control, Free 
Nio, Free EEP, Free Chry, Nio + EEP, Nio + Chry, Nio + EEP + low Cis, 
Nio + Chry + low Cis, low Cis, and high Cis groups. Treatments were administered 
intraperitoneally every three days. The study assessed the efficacy of cancer 
treatments by analyzing tumor histology, tracking growth, and tracking oxidative 
stress. In addition, the cytotoxicity of kidney and liver tissues was studied. 
Niosomes improved and enhanced the stability and encapsulation efficiency of EEP 
and Chry (90%). Combination treatments reduced tumor volume by about 90% 
compared to the control group and enhanced antioxidant activity. 
Histopathological evaluation of tumor tissue revealed that Nio + EEP + low Cis 
and Nio + Chry + low Cis significantly reduced mitotic figures and increased 
necrotic changes relative to the low and high cis groups. In the liver, these 
groups exhibited only mild necrobiotic changes and minimal vascular congestion, 
indicating a protective effect against cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity. In the 
kidney, mild interstitial nephritis, limited tubular degeneration, and reduced 
glomerular hypercellularity were observed. EEP and Chry-loaded niosomes 
effectively enhanced the antitumor efficacy of low-dose cisplatin while 
minimizing systemic toxicity. These findings suggest that Nio-based natural 
adjuvants could be promising nanocarriers for combination cancer therapy.

Accurate polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images is essential for the early 
detection and treatment of colorectal cancer. However, deep learning-based 
segmentation models often suffer performance degradation on data from unseen 
centers due to domain shift. To address this challenge, we propose a 
multi-source domain adaptation network based on Gaussian Mixture Model-guided 
Prototype Alignment (GMM-PA) for robust cross-domain polyp segmentation. First, 
an image preprocessing module is designed to visually mitigate domain 
discrepancies by applying color transformation in the LAB space and 
low-frequency spectral exchange via Fourier transform. Then, a hybrid CNN-Mamba 
architecture is introduced for feature extraction, combining the local modeling 
capacity of CNNs with the global context modeling of Mamba, offering lower 
computational cost compared to CNN-Transformer models. To better capture complex 
multimodal feature distributions, Gaussian mixture models are used to derive 
reliable class prototypes, addressing the limitations of previous unimodal 
assumptions. A cross-domain prototype feature refinement module further enhances 
representation quality by leveraging semantic relationships between features and 
prototypes. Additionally, an adversarial learning strategy is adopted to promote 
domain-invariant feature learning during training. Extensive experiments on 
three public polyp segmentation datasets demonstrate that the proposed GMM-PA 
method achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art 
approaches in cross-domain settings, achieving average Dice scores of 0.8396 and 
mIoU of 0.8449 across the datasets.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) 
computed tomography (CT), and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) are 
superior to conventional CT and bone scan imaging for detecting metastatic 
disease in patients with prostate cancer. While these higher-accuracy imaging 
methods have already shown the potential to enhance patient outcomes, a thorough 
understanding of the relationship between the treatment landscape and disease 
volume on conventional imaging, as well as the prognostic significance of the 
prostate-specific antigen response, is crucial for determining how they can be 
more effectively incorporated. Prospective clinical trials are required to 
evaluate whether PSMA-PET/CT and WB-MRI can genuinely improve clinically 
relevant endpoints for patients through precise treatment adaptations. In this 
paper, we explore the specific opportunities of PSMA-PET/CT and WB-MRI as 
biomarkers in multiple clinical domains, including metastasis detection and 
staging, disease characterisation and aggressiveness assessments, biopsy target 
selection, impacts on treatment planning, evaluation of therapeutic response, 
and theranostics. We highlight the central research questions that require 
attention. KEY POINTS: Question Can PSMA-PET/CT and WB-MRI, with their superior 
ability to detect metastases in prostate cancer, truly improve patient outcomes? 
Findings High-accuracy imaging improves metastasis detection, staging, 
assessment of disease aggressiveness, and enables more personalised treatment 
planning for advanced prostate cancer patients. Clinical relevance PSMA-PET/CT 
and WB-MRI have the potential to alter the management of men with advanced 
prostate cancer, but prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm benefits 
for survival or quality of life before recommending routine use.

Gastric cancer is a malignant tumor that seriously threatens human health. In 
this study, we explored the potential mechanism and immunomodulatory effects of 
gut microbiota (GM) metabolites on gastric cancer through network pharmacology 
and molecular docking. The GM metabolites, targets of GM metabolites and gastric 
cancer were obtained from the public databases. The cross-targets of GM 
metabolites and gastric cancer were analyzed and the common key targets were 
further got. GO function and KEGG analysis were conducted to identify potential 
functions and regulatory mechanisms. A GMMTGM network was built, and then the 
drug likeness and toxicity of obtained GM metabolites were screened. The 
molecular docking was employed to assess binding affinity between GM metabolites 
and corresponding targets. The expression of key targets was validated, and the 
relationship between key targets with immune cell infiltration levels and immune 
checkpoints was analyzed in gastric cancer. We identified eight overlapping key 
targets between GM metabolites and gastric cancer. HIF-1 and TNF signaling 
pathways were the main signaling pathways. Furthermore, nine GM metabolites were 
expected to be as drug‑likeness and low-toxicity compounds, and six GM 
metabolites had good binding affinity with corresponding protein, and their 
binding affinities under - 5 kcal/mol. The expressions of AKT1, CASP3, GAPDH, 
HIF1A and STAT3 in gastric cancer and normal sample were statistically 
significant (P < 0.01). Moreover, the results of immune-related analysis showed 
that key genes may mediate the occurrence and development of gastric cancer by 
influencing the immune cell infiltration levels and immune checkpoints. GM 
metabolites primarily exert their therapeutic effects on gastric cancer through 
multiple targets, pathways, immune cell infiltration levels and immune 
checkpoints. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to validate these 
findings.

Measuring protein abundance at the single-cell level can facilitate a 
high-resolution understanding of biological mechanisms in cellular processes and 
disease progression. However, current single-cell proteomic technologies face 
challenges such as limited coverage, constrained throughput and sensitivity, 
batch effects, high costs and stringent experimental operations. Inspired by the 
translation procedure in both natural language processing and the genetic 
central dogma, we propose a pre-trained, large generative model named 
single-cell translator (scTranslator). scTranslator can generate multi-omics 
data by inferring the missing single-cell proteome based on the transcriptome. 
Through systematic benchmarking and validation on independent datasets, we have 
confirmed the accuracy, stability and flexibility of scTranslator across various 
profiling techniques (for example, CITE-seq, spatial CITE-seq, REAP-seq, 
NEAT-seq), cell types (for example, monocytes, macrophages, T cells, B cells), 
tissues (for example, blood, lung, brain) and a wide range of disease contexts, 
including infectious, metabolic and oncologic conditions. Furthermore, 
scTranslator shows its superiority in assisting various downstream analyses and 
applications, including gene/protein interaction inference, perturbation 
prediction, cell clustering, batch correction and cell origin recognition in 
pan-cancer data.

PURPOSE: The number older patients with cancer who are terminally ill is 
expected to increase with global population aging. However, reports on the 
actual use of opioids for pain relief in patients aged ≥ 90 years with cancer at 
the end of life are limited.
METHODS: To investigate opioid use in older patients with cancer aged ≥ 90 years 
who died in a palliative care unit. Patients with cancer who died in the 
palliative care unit between August 2020 to August 2024 and were aged ≥ 90 years 
were included. We analyzed their data on opioid use, including opioid type and 
route of administration, and morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD), at the time 
of death.
RESULTS: Ninety-one patients with cancer were included in the study. Their 
median age was 92.0 years (interquartile range [IQR] 91.0-93.0). Seventy-six 
patients (83.5%) were administered opioids at the time of death, and 
hydromorphone delivered via continuous subcutaneous injection was the most 
common (41 patients). The median MEDD at the time of death for the 76 patients 
was 19.6 mg/day (IQR 12-42). Four patients were administered high doses of 
opioids (MEDD of > 120 mg/day) at the time of death.
CONCLUSION: Of the patients aged ≥ 90 years with cancer who were terminally ill, 
more than 80% had used opioids. Their median MEDD tended to be low at 
19.6 mg/day. Future studies are required to help appropriately use opioids for 
patients aged ≥ 90 years with cancer.

Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are pivotal in cancer progression, yet their role in 
metabolic reprogramming in gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) remains unclear. Here, 
we discover that highly expressed PSMD14 strengthens tumor stemness and drives 
tumor progression by increasing glycolysis and lactate accumulation, which 
activates H3K27 lactylation (H3K27la) and turns to enhance the expression of 
PSMD14 and SOX9. Mechanistically, PSMD14 deubiquitinates PFKFB2 at K355, 
facilitating SCYL2-mediated phosphorylation of PFKFB2 at S466/S483, which 
increases the generation of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, activating PFK1 and 
glycolysis. Additionally, the H3K27la/PSMD14/SCYL2/p-PFKFB2 axis correlates with 
increased glucose metabolic activity and poor prognosis in GAC patients. 
Notably, high-throughput screening of FDA-approved drugs reveals that 
Daclatasvir (DCV) exhibits high binding affinity for PSMD14 protein, disrupts 
the PSMD14-PFKFB2 interaction, reduces PFKFB2 activity and tumor burden. 
Collectively, our findings are the first to elucidate a positive feedback loop 
existing between PSMD14 and glycolysis in GAC progression, suggesting that 
PSMD14 blockade may represent a potential therapeutic approach for GAC.

BACKGROUND: Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHDS) is an autosomal dominant cancer 
predisposition syndrome, caused by pathogenic variants in FLCN, characterized by 
benign fibrofolliculomas, pulmonary cysts, pneumothorax, and increased risk for 
kidney tumors. To date, the risk of other solid tumors in individuals with BHDS 
remains unclear.
METHODS: We performed a register-based matched cohort study of 353 Swedish born 
individuals with verified pathogenic variants in FLCN to study the association 
between BHDS and other cancer types than kidney tumors. Each patient was matched 
to 50 comparisons, matched by birth year, birth county and sex. Associations 
were estimated using Cox Proportional Hazard models, expressed as Hazard Ratios 
with 95% Confidence Intervals.
RESULTS: Patients with BHDS exhibited a significantly elevated risk of adult 
cancer (adjusted HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.76-2.87), primarily driven by kidney tumors. 
Colorectal cancer and malignant melanoma were more prevalent in the BHDS cohort, 
reflected by a fivefold increase in risk of colorectal cancer (adjusted HR 5.44, 
95% CI 2.74-10.81) and an almost threefold risk of malignant melanoma (adjusted 
HR 2.67, 95% CI 1.17-6.07).
CONCLUSION: This study confirms the high risk of kidney tumors in BHDS and 
identifies increased risks for colorectal cancer and malignant melanoma, though 
the absolute risks remain low. Further research is needed to validate the 
colorectal cancer association and assess its implications for screening and 
management.

BACKGROUND: This study characterised the proteins from EVs in the serum from 
high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) compared to healthy controls.
METHODS: Serum EVs were isolated, followed by label-free liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify differentially 
expressed proteins. We validated the expression of 4 EV proteins increased in 
cancer serum (KRT4, MARCKS, SPP1/OPN, and UCHL1) in HGSOC tissues and normal 
ovarian tissues using online databases and independent HGSOC patient tissue 
cohorts. We additionally investigated the effects of the UCHL1 inhibitor, 
LDN-57444, on HGSOC cell metabolic activity, motility, invasion, and apoptosis 
in HGSOC tissues using patient-derived explant assays.
RESULTS: Proteomics analysis identified 28 EV proteins that were upregulated in 
HGSOC compared to healthy controls. We confirmed that UCHL1 protein levels were 
increased in HGSOC tissues compared to normal (OSE and FT) and benign 
epithelium. High stromal UCHL1 levels were associated with reduced 
progression-free survival in HGSOC. The UCHL1 inhibitor, LDN-57444, reduced the 
cell metabolic activity of ovarian cancer cell lines and primary ovarian cancer 
cells with high UCHL1 levels. LDN-57444 blocked the motility and invasion of 
OVCAR3 cells and promoted apoptosis in the HGSOC patient explant tissue assay.
CONCLUSION: UCHL1 has the potential to be used as a novel prognostic and 
therapeutic target for HGSOC.

BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation and inflammatory-related exposures have been 
implicated in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) prognosis. However, no studies 
have evaluated whether analgesic medication use impacts survival in Black women 
with EOC, an understudied population with poor survival.
METHODS: Leveraging data from the African American Cancer Epidemiology Study, we 
examined the association of pre-diagnostic analgesic medication use (aspirin, 
non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [naNSAIDs], and acetaminophen) 
with survival among self-identified Black women diagnosed with EOC (N = 541) 
using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Stratified analyses 
were conducted by comorbidities and histotype.
RESULTS: Acetaminophen use was associated with a higher risk of mortality 
overall (HR = 1.40; 95% CI = 1.00-1.97) and for frequent and chronic use (≥30 
days per month: HR = 1.62; 95% CI = 1.12-2.34; >5 years: HR = 1.57; 95% 
CI = 1.03-2.39). These associations were more pronounced among women with 
high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC)/carcinosarcoma and those with comorbidities. 
Among women with comorbidities, naNSAID use was associated with a decreased risk 
of mortality (HR = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.51-0.99), but no association was observed 
among women without comorbidities (HR = 0.99; 95% CI = 0.56-1.75). No 
associations with survival were observed for aspirin.
CONCLUSION: Chronic use of acetaminophen negatively impacted survival among 
Black women with EOC, while naNSAID use conferred a survival advantage only 
among women with comorbidities.

Language in clinical genetics is never neutral. The terms used to describe 
genetic concepts, like mutation or variant, sporadic or hereditary, patient or 
counselee not only shape scientific discourse but also profoundly affect how 
individuals understand their risks, experience counselling, and make decisions. 
Terminology carries ethical weight, influencing perceptions of identity, stigma, 
and inclusion. Precision and empathy in language are therefore central to 
ethical and effective care. We propose the use of consistent terminology in 
communication that integrates three ethical responsibilities, promoting 
inclusivity through careful terminology, fostering psychosocial awareness by 
recognising that words can evoke fear or stigma, or offer reassurance and 
communicative clarity. This can be achieved by standardising professional 
terminology (e.g., variant, sporadic/hereditary) while co-constructing meaning 
with counselees. We recommend avoiding ambiguous labels like positive or 
negative, using precise qualifiers for variants and harmonising language across 
professional disciplines. Communication itself can be a clinical intervention, 
as careful paraphrasing and clarification both enhance understanding and provide 
emotional support. As genetic testing becomes increasingly mainstream in 
oncology, empathetic, precise, and patient-centred communication is essential. 
By fostering clarity and reducing stigma, language can support informed 
decision-making, trust, and ultimately, the ethical integration of genetics into 
everyday healthcare.

The incidence of thyroid cancer, the most common endocrine malignancy, has 
increased by 313% in the past four decades and is now the seventh most common 
cancer worldwide. There is an urgent need for non-invasive diagnostic, 
prognostic, and surveillance biomarkers to improve patient outcomes. Given the 
promising role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as liquid biopsy biomarkers, a 
systematic review of the literature was conducted to evaluate their diagnostic 
and prognostic utility in thyroid cancer. We also assessed the quality of 
included studies giving special emphasis to methodology, reporting standards, 
and adherence to MISEV2018 guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted 
across Web of Science, Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Scopus, and Emcare for 
English-language studies published from inception to March 2025. Search terms 
included a combination of relevant keywords and subject Headings. A total of 40 
studies met the inclusion criteria. Most focused on papillary thyroid carcinoma, 
with relatively a minority investigating follicular thyroid carcinoma. The 
majority examined small EVs (exosomes), with microRNAs (miRNAs) being the most 
studied EV biomarkers, followed by proteins, circular RNAs, long non-coding 
RNAs, mRNAs, DNA, procoagulant phospholipids, and biophysical characteristics. 
No studies investigated EV lipids or metabolites as potential thyroid cancer 
biomarkers. This systematic review highlights the strong potential of EVs as 
diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in thyroid cancer. However, larger 
prospective patient cohorts are needed to validate current findings. Clinical 
translation will require standardised methodologies and robust comprehensive 
reporting aligned with MISEV2018 guidelines, enhancing reproducibility and 
paving the way for multicentre clinical trials.

patients pose a diagnostic challenge in distinguishing primary lung cancer (PLC) 
from pulmonary metastasis (PM). KRAS mutation analysis is a potential tool for 
distinguishing these entities.
METHODS: A retrospective study of 17 patients who underwent pulmonary resection 
after pancreatic cancer surgery was conducted. Paired pancreatic and pulmonary 
tumor samples were analyzed for KRAS mutations. PDX1 expression was assessed by 
immunohistochemistry. Preoperative clinical factors were evaluated using KRAS 
mutation-based classification as the reference.
RESULTS: KRAS mutations were discordant between pancreatic and pulmonary tumors 
in nine patients (53%), leading to a diagnosis of PLC. KRAS G12R concordance was 
observed in three cases, confirming PM. Five cases with KRAS G12D or G12V 
concordance could not be definitively classified. KRAS mutation analysis 
identified more PLC cases than pathological diagnosis. PDX1 expression was found 
in both PM and some PLC cases, as well as in lung invasive mucinous 
adenocarcinoma cases without pancreatic cancer history, limiting its diagnostic 
value. Lymphovascular invasion in the pancreatic tumor was significantly 
associated with PM.
CONCLUSIONS: KRAS mutation analysis of both pancreatic tumor and lung tumor is 
useful for distinguishing solitary pulmonary nodules in postoperative pancreatic 
cancer patients. KRAS mutation analysis identified PLC more frequently than 
conventional pathological diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex subunit 3 (EMC3) 
plays a critical role in protein translocation and processing and has been 
implicated in multiple cancer types. However, its specific function and clinical 
relevance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain poorly understood. This study 
aimed to investigate the molecular role and prognostic significance of EMC3 in 
HCC progression.
METHODS: Public datasets and clinical samples from HCC patients were analyzed to 
assess EMC3 expression and its association with prognosis. Genomic and immunomic 
profiles were evaluated to explore EMC3-related genomic instability and its 
regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Functional assays, 
including clone formation, CCK-8, EdU proliferation, wound healing, Transwell 
migration and invasion, and in vivo xenograft and lung metastasis models, were 
performed to examine the effects of EMC3 on HCC cell proliferation and 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistic studies involved RNA 
sequencing, pathway enrichment analysis, and rescue experiments using the PI3K 
inhibitor LY294002.
RESULTS: EMC3 was significantly overexpressed in HCC tissues and correlated with 
poor patient survival. Genomic analyses revealed EMC3-associated instability, 
and immunomic profiling indicated its role in shaping an immunosuppressive TIME. 
In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that EMC3 promotes HCC 
proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis. Mechanistically, EMC3 
activated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, and inhibition of this pathway 
reversed the oncogenic effects of EMC3.
CONCLUSIONS: EMC3 drives HCC progression by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway 
and modulating the TIME. It represents a novel prognostic biomarker and a 
potential therapeutic target for HCC, with implications for patient 
stratification and personalized treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: While multimodality therapy for locally advanced esophageal cancer 
evolves, neoadjuvant chemoradiation has been a longstanding treatment paradigm. 
Pathologic complete response (pCR) rates vary by histology: 25% for 
adenocarcinoma (AC) and up to 50% for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Long-term 
outcomes after pCR remain poorly understood but important to define as multiple 
treatment options emerge.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed patients with cT2+/N+M0 esophageal AC or SCC 
treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and resection from an institutional 
database. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed 
using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox models. A risk score for recurrence was 
developed and validated using National Cancer Data Base data.
RESULTS: Of 830 patients, 37.1% achieved pCR (n = 250/720, 34.2% for AC and n = 
58/100, 58.0% for SCC). pCR was associated with prolonged OS (5-year OS: 56.2% 
versus 35.0% for residual disease, p < 0.001). pCR remained an independent 
predictor of OS after adjustment for known predictors of OS (HR 0.58, p < 
0.001). Recurrence typically occurred within 2 years then plateaued, with 5-year 
RFS of 72.6% for AC and 83.0% for SCC. Clinical T3/T4, cN+, fewer lymph nodes 
examined, and AC histology were independently associated with worse RFS. A 
weighted risk score for recurrence was developed, which externally predicted OS 
after pCR in the NCDB (HR 1.12 per point, p < 0.001). Median OS was 7.8 years 
for cases with score 0-3 versus 5.7 years for cases with score 4-5.
CONCLUSIONS: pCR after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is a strong predictor of 
survival, but recurrence remains common. Further investigation into adjuvant 
therapies for high-risk pCR patients is needed.

BACKGROUND: Hospital systems must document adherence to strict quality standards 
to achieve specialty accreditation. Requirements often include completion of 
quality improvement (QI) projects. Because breast surgeons are often the leaders 
of the multidisciplinary teams, they are tasked with initiating these QI 
projects. Although they are comfortable interpreting data in their practices, 
most breast surgeons lack formal training in quality. This report aims to 
provide guidance for breast surgeons to initiate and navigate QI projects.
METHODS: The Patient Safety and Quality Committee of the American Society of 
Breast Surgeons reviewed the literature for relevant resources of surgical 
quality to establish a framework for surgeons to use when performing QI 
projects.
RESULTS: Review of the literature and online sources showed nine key principles 
breast surgeons should use when performing QI studies. Emerging data, a change 
in process, or patient/provider feedback can provide potential ideas for study. 
After creating a problem statement, the stakeholder team defines the current 
state by obtaining local data and comparing it with established benchmarks. Once 
a gap is identified, a root cause analysis is performed to determine potential 
interventions for improvement. Assessment of results after implementation can be 
used to measure success.
CONCLUSION: Quality improvement in breast surgery involves a combined effort 
between health care staff and stakeholders to improve the care provided to 
patients. Breast surgeons are well positioned to direct these projects as 
leaders of the care teams. This report provides a framework for common 
understanding of the key principles of QI in breast surgery.

Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide1. 
Here, in the Breast Cancer-Anti-Progestin Prevention Study 1 (BC-APPS1; 
NCT02408770 ), we assessed whether progesterone receptor antagonism with 
ulipristal acetate for 12 weeks reduces surrogate markers of breast cancer risk 
in 24 premenopausal women. We used multilayered OMICs and live-cell approaches 
as readouts for molecular features alongside clinical imaging and tissue 
micromechanics correlates. Ulipristal acetate reduced epithelial proliferation 
(Ki67) and the proportion, proliferation and colony formation capacity of 
luminal progenitor cells, the putative cell of origin of aggressive breast 
cancers2. MRI scans showed reduction in fibroglandular volume with treatment, 
whereas single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomics, histology and atomic force 
microscopy identified extracellular matrix remodelling with reduced collagen 
organization and tissue stiffness. Collagen VI was the most significantly 
downregulated protein after ulipristal acetate treatment, and we uncovered an 
unanticipated spatial association between collagen VI and SOX9high luminal 
progenitor cell localization, establishing a link between collagen organization 
and luminal progenitor activity. Culture of primary human breast epithelial 
cells in a stiff environment increased luminal progenitor activity, which was 
antagonized by anti-progestin therapy, strengthening this mechanistic link. This 
study offers a template for biologically informed early-phase therapeutic cancer 
prevention trials and demonstrates the potential for premenopausal breast cancer 
prevention with progesterone receptor antagonists through stromal remodelling 
and luminal progenitor suppression.

Emerging evidence indicates that cancer cells are susceptible to ferroptosis, a 
form of cell death that is triggered by uncontrolled lipid peroxidation1-3. 
Despite broad enthusiasm about harnessing ferroptosis as a novel anti-cancer 
strategy, whether ferroptosis is a barrier to tumorigenesis and can be leveraged 
therapeutically remains unknown4,5. Here, using genetically engineered mouse 
models of lung adenocarcinoma, we performed tumour-specific loss-of-function 
studies of two key ferroptosis suppressors, GPX46,7 and ferroptosis suppressor 
protein 1 (FSP1)8,9, and observed increased lipid peroxidation and robust 
suppression of tumorigenesis, suggesting that lung tumours are highly sensitive 
to ferroptosis. Furthermore, across multiple pre-clinical models, we found that 
FSP1 was required for ferroptosis protection in vivo, but not in vitro, 
underscoring a heightened need to buffer lipid peroxidation under physiological 
conditions. Lipidomic analyses revealed that Fsp1-knockout tumours had an 
accumulation of lipid peroxides, and inhibition of ferroptosis with genetic, 
dietary or pharmacological approaches effectively restored the growth of 
Fsp1-knockout tumours in vivo. Unlike GPX4, expression of FSP1 (also known as 
AIFM2) was prognostic for disease progression and poorer survival in patients 
with lung adenocarcinoma, highlighting its potential as a viable therapeutic 
target. To this end, we demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of FSP1 had 
significant therapeutic benefit in pre-clinical lung cancer models. Our studies 
highlight the importance of ferroptosis suppression in vivo and pave the way for 
FSP1 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for patients with lung cancer.

Ferroptosis has emerged as an actionable target to eliminate therapy-resistant 
and metastatic cancers1. However, which ferroptosis surveillance systems may 
offer a therapeutic window to leverage redox maladaptation in cancer remains 
unclear. In melanoma, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) impedes ferroptosis during 
haematogenous metastasis, but is dispensable during lymphatic metastasis2. Here, 
using a metastatic mouse melanoma model selected for lymph node metastasis, we 
show that lymph-node-derived metastatic cells exhibit markedly diminished 
expression of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) 
levels relative to their parental counterparts. This metabolic shift occurs 
within the hypoxic lymphatic niche. Under comparable low-oxygen conditions, GPX4 
undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In response, lymph node 
metastatic cells acquire increased reliance on ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 
(FSP1), which is localized with perinuclear lysosomes. These findings reveal 
that the reduced reliance on the GPX4 axis enables melanoma cells to shift 
toward FSP1 dependency. Notably, intratumoural monotherapy with selective FSP1 
inhibitors (viFSP1 and FSEN1) effectively suppresses melanoma growth in lymph 
nodes, but not in subcutaneous tumours, emphasizing a microenvironment-specific 
dependency on FSP1. Thus, targeting FSP1 in the lymph nodes holds strong 
potential for blocking melanoma progression.

BACKGROUND: Patients with a life-threatening disease often experience palliative 
care needs (symptoms and problems) before death, and those with the most complex 
needs should be those who get access to specialized palliative care. To examine 
if that is the case, studies are needed comparing palliative care needs of 
patients with life-threatening cancer and non-cancer diseases admitted to 
specialized palliative care to patients receiving basic palliative care.
AIMS: To compare palliative care needs among patients with a life-threatening 
disease admitted to specialized palliative care and patients receiving basic 
palliative care.
DESIGN: A secondary data analysis of symptoms/problems reported by patients in 
basic palliative care or at admittance to specialized palliative care in 
Denmark. Ordinal logistic regression was performed to study differences in the 
probability of experiencing each symptom/problem among patients receiving 
specialized palliative care vs. basic palliative care, controlled for possible 
confounders.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a life-threatening disease who completed the 
EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL questionnaire.
RESULTS: The study included 6367 patients. The odds of experiencing symptoms, 
impaired physical functioning, impaired emotional functioning, and poor quality 
of life were higher at admittance to specialized palliative care compared to an 
ongoing basic palliative care, especially impaired physical functioning (OR 8.3, 
95% CI 6.6-10.5) and fatigue (OR 5.1, 95% CI 4.1-6.5).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients in specialized palliative care had higher levels of 
symptoms and problems than patients with a life-threatening disease receiving 
basic palliative care, especially non-cancer patients. Future research should 
study changes in symptoms/problems during the disease trajectory among patients 
with life-threatening diseases to improve referrals to specialized palliative 
care.

Immunotherapy has revolutionized hematologic cancer treatment, yet responses 
remain unpredictable due to primary resistance, relapse, and life-threatening 
toxicities. Conventional biomarkers fail to capture the complexity of 
tumor-immune interactions, necessitating integrative approaches. This review 
explores how multi-omics technologies, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, 
metabolomics, spatial omics, and microbiome profiling, decode the molecular 
drivers of immunotherapy efficacy and adverse events in hematologic 
malignancies. We highlight key advances: genomics reveals neoantigen landscapes 
and HLA diversity shaping checkpoint inhibitor responses; transcriptomics 
identifies T-cell exhaustion signatures predictive of CAR-T failure; 
metabolomics uncovers lactate-driven immunosuppression in AML; and spatial omics 
maps immune architectures linked to Hodgkin lymphoma outcomes. Supervised 
machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forest, support vector machines) 
integrate these layers to build predictive models for cytokine release syndrome 
(CRS) and resistance, while longitudinal ctDNA monitoring enables dynamic 
therapy adaptation. Emerging frontiers like CRISPR-based epitope editing, 
digital twins for in silico clinical trials, and non-coding RNA biomarkers 
further refine precision strategies. Despite challenges in data integration, 
tumor plasticity, and ethical frameworks, multi-omics is accelerating 
biomarker-driven trial designs (e.g., basket trials with omics stratification) 
and patient-centric tools (wearable sensors for real-time metabolite tracking). 
This review distinguishes itself by synthesizing these rapid technological 
advances not only to predict outcomes but also to chart a forward-looking 
roadmap for their clinical translation, offering a unique perspective on 
overcoming the current barriers to precision immuno-oncology. Together, these 
advances promise to transform immunotherapy from empirical to precision 
medicine, optimizing outcomes for leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma patients.

Tragopogon dubius Scop. is consumed as a vegetable and is well known for its 
numerous ethnomedicinal properties to treat gastrointestinal, kidney, liver 
dysfunction, inflamed skin, wounds and certain cutaneous diseases. The present 
study aimed to determine the antioxidant potential, cytotoxicity towards 
different cancer cells, and genotoxic effect of essential oil of T. dubius 
(Trd-EO) obtained from stem and leaves through hydro distillation. Trd-EO 
exhibited moderate radical scavenging activity in all antioxidant assays, 
displayed an effective concentration (EC50) value of 153.77 μg/mL, 126.85 μg/mL, 
115.74 μg/mL, and 120.76 μg/mL, in DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and Superoxide radical 
scavenging assays respectively. Trd-EO has moderate phenolic (15.86 mg RE/gdw,) 
and flavonoid (19.88 mg GAE/g dw) contents. Single-cell gel electrophoresis 
(Comet assay) for genotoxicity of Trd-EO of T. dubius showed no significant 
genotoxic and cytotoxic signs at 25 μg/mL to 200 μg/mL in human lymphocytes. 
Results through MTT for cytotoxicity analysis showed that T. dubius obtained 
Trd-EO-possessed potent toxicity against human Breast (MCF-7), human 
glioblastoma (LN-18), human lung (A-549) and human colon (HCT-116) cancer cell 
lines in a dose-dependent manner. Trd-EO possessed the selective and highest 
cytotoxicity towards MCF-7 and LN-18 cancer cell lines, reduced over 50% cell 
growth at the concentration of 24.37 μg/mL and 36.72 μg/mL, and 
cytomorphological studies indicated the apoptotic effect of the essential oil. 
GCMS and GCGCTOFMS profiling of Trd-EO revealed 23 and 61 phytoconstituents 
belonged to fatty acids, aldehydes, alcohols, ketone derivatives, ester 
derivatives, alkanes and other fatty acid derivatives. As expected for oil 
extraction, fatty acid derivatives were majorly present.

Prior research shows that Akt-dependent phosphorylation of TopBP1 in S phase 
results in the switch of TopBP1/Treslin binding to TopBP1/E2F1 binding, which is 
important to prevent replication re-initiation in late S and G2 phases. Here, we 
demonstrate that contact, but not conformational, mutant p53 can override this 
switch by binding to both TopBP1 and Treslin, thereby facilitating persistent 
TopBP1/Treslin interaction in late S and G2 phases, which ultimately leads to 
over-firing of replication initiation. This increases micronuclei formation, 
which is further enhanced by genotoxic stressors such as doxorubicin, PARP 
inhibitors, or ATR inhibitors. Consequently, contact mutant p53 increases the 
sensitivity of cancer cells to a TopBP1-BRCT7/8 inhibitor combined with PARP or 
ATR inhibitors. Importantly, contact mutant p53 induces micronuclei formation 
and MRE11 expression, thereby activating cGAS-STING pathway and enhancing 
response to immune checkpoint inhibition. This finding is validated in murine 
mammary tumor allografts and further corroborated by clinical data.

The study of complex diseases has traditionally relied on reductionist methods, 
which, although informative, tend to overlook the dynamic interactions and 
systemic interconnectivity inherent in biological systems. Allostasis, a 
framework that focuses on physiological adaptations to stress and the 
maintenance of stability through change, provides a valuable perspective for 
understanding these diseases. This review summarizes how the allostasis 
framework defines the cumulative physiological burden-known as allostatic 
load-imposed by chronic stressors such as persistent psychosocial pressure, drug 
abuse, and chronic infections. It also explores how adaptive physiological 
shifts, or changes in allostatic state, contribute to disorders, particularly 
drug addiction, immune diseases, and cancer. We then review recent studies that 
uncover stress adaptation mechanisms using cutting-edge technologies, such as 
multi-omics approaches, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and organoid 
technology. This integrative approach, combining advanced technologies with the 
allostasis framework, can deepen our understanding of complex disease 
pathogenesis and inform the development of more effective diagnostic and 
therapeutic strategies.

This study aims to investigate the mechanism of action of BHLHE40 and its 
targeted drug, digoxin, in cervical cancer. The clinical significance of BHLHE40 
was evaluated in cervical cancer samples using the UALCAN and Human Protein 
Atlas databases. The effects of BHLHE40 on proliferation, migration, invasion, 
and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were then assessed through loss- and 
gain-of-function experiments coupled with CCK-8, wound healing, Transwell and 
Western blot analysis. A murine lung-metastasis model was further established to 
`validate the pro-metastatic role of BHLHE40 in vivo. JASPAR-based motif 
prediction, chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR (ChIP-qPCR), and luciferase 
reporter assays were employed to elucidate the transcriptional regulation of 
ANGPTL3 by BHLHE40. Molecular docking and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) 
were used to clarify the molecular interaction between digoxin and BHLHE40. 
BHLHE40 was markedly up-regulated in cervical cancer tissues and positively 
correlated with advanced tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis. 
Knockdown of BHLHE40 suppressed proliferation, colony formation, migration, 
invasion, and attenuated EMT. Consistently, silencing BHLHE40 reduced the number 
of pulmonary metastatic nodules in nude mice. Mechanistically, BHLHE40 bound 
directly to the ANGPTL3 promoter and enhanced its transcriptional activity. 
Knock-down ANGPTL3 reversed BHLHE40-induced increases in migratory and invasive 
capacities as well as EMT-related phenotypic changes. Digoxin bound to the 
conserved domain of BHLHE40, down-regulated both BHLHE40 and ANGPTL3, and 
suppressed EMT and cell motility. Overexpression of BHLHE40 rescued these 
inhibitory effects of digoxin. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that 
BHLHE40 promotes EMT and metastasis in cervical cancer by transcriptionally 
activating ANGPTL3, whereas digoxin exerts anti-EMT effects by targeting this 
axis. These data highlight the critical role of the BHLHE40-ANGPTL3 axis in 
cervical cancer progression and suggest that repurposing digoxin offers a novel 
therapeutic strategy for suppressing EMT in this disease.

The field of computational pathology has been transformed with recent advances 
in foundation models that encode histopathology region-of-interests (ROIs) into 
versatile and transferable feature representations via self-supervised learning. 
However, translating these advancements to address complex clinical challenges 
at the patient and slide level remains constrained by limited clinical data in 
disease-specific cohorts, especially for rare clinical conditions. We propose 
Transformer-based pathology Image and Text Alignment Network (TITAN), a 
multimodal whole-slide foundation model pretrained using 335,645 whole-slide 
images via visual self-supervised learning and vision-language alignment with 
corresponding pathology reports and 423,122 synthetic captions generated from a 
multimodal generative AI copilot for pathology. Without any fine-tuning or 
requiring clinical labels, TITAN can extract general-purpose slide 
representations and generate pathology reports that generalize to 
resource-limited clinical scenarios such as rare disease retrieval and cancer 
prognosis. We evaluate TITAN on diverse clinical tasks and find that it 
outperforms both ROI and slide foundation models across machine learning 
settings, including linear probing, few-shot and zero-shot classification, rare 
cancer retrieval, cross-modal retrieval and pathology report generation.

Resistance of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to EGFR tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs) limits the efficacy and leads to disease progression with 
mechanisms such as activation of autophagy in tumor cells, but the current 
therapeutic strategies are unable to intervene in this mechanism. Magnolin 
(Mag), a naturally derived compound, has garnered significant interest due to 
its potential antitumor properties. Through virtual screening methods, Mag was 
identified as a compound with potential to regulate molecular pathways closely 
related to drug resistance mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the 
ability of Mag to enhance EGFR TKI efficacy in resistant NSCLC. 
Afatinib-resistant cell line (HCC827AR) was established by continuously exposing 
HCC827 cells to afatinib (4 µM) for 6 months. Medium containing 4 µM afatinib 
was refreshed every 48 h. By conducting RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and exome 
sequencing on HCC827AR cells, NRG2 was identified as a core-enriched gene. We 
demonstrated that Mag directly bound to the TYR112 residue of NDRG1, stabilizing 
its expression and preventing its degradation. This interaction upregulated 
NDRG1, which in turn promoted its interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase 
HECW1, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of NRG2 at lysine 223 
(K223). By targeting the NDRG1-NRG2-HECW1 pathway, Mag uniquely inhibited 
autophagy and restored the sensitivity of HCC827AR cells to EGFR TKIs, thereby 
reversing resistance. In vivo, the combined treatment with Mag 
(30 mg· kg-1 ·d-1, i.g.) and Afa (10 mg· kg-1 ·d-1, i.g.) significantly reduced 
tumor growth in patient-derived xenografts without inducing major toxicity. This 
study unravels the intricate role of NDRG1 in modulating NRG2 via HECW1. The 
results not only illuminate Mag's promising potential as an adjunctive therapy 
to surmount EGFR TKI resistance, but also underscore the significant therapeutic 
potential of targeting the NDRG1-NRG2-HECW1 pathway as a novel strategy to 
reverse EGFR TKI resistance in NSCLC.

Lagoon systems in Nigeria serve as essential ecosystems for fisheries and local 
livelihoods, yet, they face increasing threats from industrial discharges, 
agricultural runoff, and urban pollution, which may degrade water quality and 
pose health risks to coastal communities. This study comparatively assesses how 
varying anthropogenic activities influence the physicochemical properties and 
heavy metal levels in surface waters of Nigeria's interconnected coastal lagoons 
and also evaluates the contamination indices, pollution sources, and human 
health risks. The physicochemical parameters were; pH (6.86-6.97), dissolved 
oxygen (4.39-5.91 mg/L), total suspended solids (20.81-21.74 mg/L), electrical 
conductivity (26.28-217.11 uS/cm), and total dissolved solids (61.82 mg/L) and 
were within the recommended limits, except for TDS. The distribution trends and 
average levels of heavy metals were as follows: Zn (1.98-4.60 mg/L) > Fe 
(0.59-3.79 mg/L) > Cu (0.18-3.10 mg/L) > Cr (0.02-0.785 mg/L) > Pb 
(0.30-0.50 mg/L) > Cd (0.15-0.41 mg/L) > As (0.05-0.06 mg/L) > Ni 
(0.02-0.06 mg/L). Heavy metal concentrations were highest during the dry season, 
and the spatial analysis revealed that the concentrations of Cd, Pb, and As were 
highest at stations LE6 and LE9 in Lekki Lagoon, indicating areas primarily 
influenced by agriculture, tourism, and dredging activities. In Lagos Lagoon, 
stations LA1, LA3, and LA5 presented the highest levels, mostly contaminated 
with Cd, Cr, and Pb, corresponding with locations dominated by industrial 
wastewater discharge, crude oil processing, shipping activities and leaching oil 
from abandoned power plants. The integrated pollution and water quality indices 
revealed that approximately 90% of the sampling stations of both lagoons 
presented moderate to extreme contamination levels, rendering the water 
unsuitable for drinking, with potential uptake, accumulation, and ecological 
risks for important ecosystem functions. Multivariate analysis revealed that the 
elevated heavy metal concentrations in both lagoons originated primarily from 
diverse anthropogenic activities. The health risk assessment revealed that 
ingestion of Cd, Cr, and As poses the highest threat to human health, with most 
of the sampling stations, especially in Lagos Lagoon, presenting potential 
non-cancer and carcinogenic health risks, with children being the most 
vulnerable group. Our findings showed that both lagoons are highly contaminated 
irrespective of the varying anthropogenic influences. Thus, we recommend

The androgen receptor (AR) is a critical driver of prostate cancer (PCa). Here, 
to study regulators of AR protein levels and oncogenic activity, we developed a 
live-cell quantitative endogenous AR fluorescent reporter. Leveraging this AR 
reporter, we performed genome-scale CRISPRi flow cytometry sorting screens to 
systematically identify genes that modulate AR protein levels. We identified and 
validated known AR protein regulators, including HOXB13 and GATA2, and also 
unexpected top hits including PTGES3-a poorly characterized gene in PCa. PTGES3 
repression resulted in loss of AR protein, cell-cycle arrest and cell death in 
AR-driven PCa models. Clinically, analysis of PCa data demonstrates that PTGES3 
expression is associated with AR-directed therapy resistance. Mechanistically, 
we show PTGES3 binds directly to AR, regulates AR protein stability and is 
necessary for AR function in the nucleus at AR target genes. PTGES3 represents a 
potential therapeutic target for overcoming known mechanisms of resistance to 
existing AR-directed therapies in PCa.

Immune system control is a principal hurdle in cancer evolution. The temporal 
dynamics of immune evasion remain incompletely characterized, and how 
immune-mediated selection interrelates with epigenome alteration is unclear. 
Here we infer the genome- and epigenome-driven evolutionary dynamics of 
tumor-immune coevolution within primary colorectal cancers (CRCs). We utilize a 
multiregion multiomic dataset of matched genome, transcriptome and chromatin 
accessibility profiling from 495 single glands (from 29 CRCs) supplemented with 
high-resolution spatially resolved neoantigen sequencing data and multiplexed 
imaging of the tumor microenvironment from 82 microbiopsies within 11 CRCs. 
Somatic chromatin accessibility alterations contribute to accessibility loss of 
antigen-presenting genes and silencing of neoantigens. Immune escape and 
exclusion occur at the outset of CRC formation, and later intratumoral 
differences in immuno-editing are negligible or exclusive to sites of invasion. 
Collectively, immune evasion in CRC follows a 'Big Bang' evolutionary pattern, 
whereby it is acquired close to transformation and defines subsequent 
cancer-immune evolution.

In this research, quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) regression 
along with multi criteria decision making (MCDM) approaches, including TOPSIS 
and Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), is deployed to rank the antihematological 
cancer drugs by structural and physicochemical attributes. Topological indices 
like zagreb, Randic and Atom Bond Connectivity (ABC) indices are calculated with 
the Maple program and chemspider was employed to obtain physicochemical 
descriptors such as boiling point; molar refraction; polarizability and molar 
volume which are both modeled using cubic and logarithm regression. The cubic 
model performed better than the logarithmic models, both in terms of correlation 
coefficients and predictive accuracy. In the present study, two compounds with 
more complexity of structure and greater connectivity, Carfilzomib and 
Zanubrutinib were ranked higher by QSPR and MCDM model considering the 
structural features compared to those with simpler molecular frameworks 
including Cyclophosphamide and Cytarabine which was placed lower. The above 
results suggest that compositing QSPR regression and MCDM is applicable towards 
computationally automatic, yet efficient process for screening drug candidates 
systematically at the beginning stages of hematologic cancer therapies.

Organoid models have significantly enhanced our understanding of adult stem cell 
function, however, uncovering regulatory mechanisms governing rare and often 
quiescent stem cells in glandular organs remains challenging. Here, we employ an 
integrative multi-omics approach, combining single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk 
ATAC and RNA sequencing, to profile the cellular populations and signaling 
pathways characterizing a mouse salivary gland organoid model across different 
temporal stages and after radiation-induced damage. Our findings identify Sox9- 
and Itgb1/Cd44-expressing cells as primitive adult stem/progenitor populations 
with a critical migratory role in tissue repair. Notch signaling is a key driver 
of self-renewal and migration in response to irradiation. Additionally, 
scRNA-seq analysis of irradiated salivary gland tissue confirms these findings 
in an in vivo setting. Extending these findings to murine and patient-derived 
salivary, mammary and thyroid gland organoids, we reveal the conserved role of 
Notch signaling in coordinating stem/progenitor cell-mediated regeneration 
across glandular tissues. These insights position Notch signaling as a central 
regulator of glandular stem cell-like populations and as a promising therapeutic 
target for enhancing glandular tissue regeneration following cancer therapies.

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a promising strategy in cancer 
therapy, enabling the targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents to tumor cells. In 
this study, we developed and characterized novel ADCs combining the anti-EGFR 
monoclonal therapeutic antibody Cetuximab (Cet) with two aminobisphosphonates 
(N-BPs) analogues of zoledronic acid (ZA): DC310 and the aminothiazole DC315. 
These conjugates aim to enhance antitumor efficacy of Cet in colorectal cancer 
(CRC) by both directly inhibiting tumor cell growth and activating Vδ2 T 
lymphocytes. We optimized the drug-antibody ratio (DAR), achieving significantly 
higher DARs compared to previously reported Cet-ZA conjugate, particularly with 
Cet-DC315 (DAR ≈ 23). Both ADCs retained selective EGFR binding in CRC cell 
lines and patient-derived organoids (PDO). Functionally, Cet-DC315 markedly 
inhibited proliferation of EGFR⁺ CRC cell lines in conventional cultures and 3D 
spheroids. Furthermore, Cet-DC-315 uniquely induced expansion and cytotoxic 
activation of Vδ2 T cells in co-cultures with CRC cell lines, PDO, and primary 
tumor samples. These findings suggest that ADCs incorporating novel N-BPs such 
as DC315 represent a potent approach for dual antitumor targeting through direct 
cytostatic effects and immune activation, offering a potential therapeutic 
advantage in the treatment of EGFR+ colorectal cancer.

Identifying the mechanisms of action (MOA) driving a drug's anti-cancer efficacy 
is critical for its clinical success, guiding the search for its best 
biomarkers, indications and combinations. Yet, systematically identifying MOAs 
remains challenging due to drugs often engaging multiple targets with varying 
affinities across different cellular contexts. Addressing this challenge, we 
present DeepTarget, a computational tool that integrates large-scale drug and 
genetic knockdown viability screens with omics data to predict a drug's MOAs 
driving its cancer cell killing. To test its performance, we curated eight 
datasets of high-confidence drug-target pairs focused on cancer drugs and 
benchmarked DeepTarget. We show that DeepTarget outperforms recent tools in 
predicting drug targets and their mutation-specificity, achieving strong 
predictive performance across diverse validation datasets. We experimentally 
validate DeepTarget's predictions in two case studies: (a) Demonstrating that 
pyrimethamine, an anti-parasitic drug, affects cellular viability through 
modulation of mitochondrial function, specifically the oxidative phosphorylation 
pathway, and (b) Confirming that T790-mutated EGFR mediates ibrutinib response 
in BTK-negative solid tumors. Additionally, we demonstrate that kinase 
inhibitors predicted by DeepTarget to have higher target specificity show 
increased progression in clinical trials. We provide DeepTarget as an 
open-source tool ( https://github.com/CBIIT-CGBB/DeepTarget ) along with 
predicted target profiles for 1,500 cancer-related drugs and 33,000 unpublished 
natural product extracts. DeepTarget represents a significant computational 
advancement among target discovery methods that complements the leading 
structure-based methods by considering cellular context and can potentially 
accelerate drug development and repurposing efforts in oncology.

Spatial transcriptomics has enabled the study of mRNA distributions within 
cells, a key aspect of cellular function. However, there is a dearth of tools 
that can identify and interpret functionally relevant spatial patterns of 
subcellular transcript distribution. To address this, we present CellSP, a 
computational framework for identifying, visualizing, and characterizing 
consistent subcellular spatial patterns of mRNA. CellSP introduces the concept 
of ""gene-cell modules"", which are gene sets with coordinated subcellular 
transcript distributions in many cells. It provides intuitive visualizations of 
the captured patterns and offers functional insights into each discovered 
module. We demonstrate that CellSP reliably identifies functionally significant 
modules across diverse tissues and technologies. We use the tool to discover 
subcellular spatial phenomena related to myelination, axonogenesis, and synapse 
formation in the mouse brain. We find immune response-related modules that 
change between kidney cancer and healthy samples, and myelination-related 
modules specific to mouse models of Alzheimer's Disease.

Elevated salinity in unconfined aquifers limits residents' use of groundwater 
for drinking in agricultural settings in KSA. The study developed a 
probabilistic dermal risk assessment methodology for heavy metals exposure 
through washing and bathing activities in farms across the Qassim Region, which 
addressed the uncertainties associated with limited data and vagueness in 
site-specific exposure factors, such as skin surface area and body weight. 
Groundwater monitoring established the probabilities of Ba, Cd, Cr, Mn, and Zn 
levels exceeding the maximum allowable concentrations (MAC) as 0.03 mg/L, 
0.003 mg/L, 0.15 mg/L, 0.01 mg/L, and 0.01 mg/L, respectively. A hazard index 
with a 0.99 probability of less than 1 indicates an insignificant non-cancer 
risk associated with dermal exposure. The study found an incremental lifetime 
cancer risk (ILCR) of 6E-5 for Cd and 8E-5 for Cr at median probability, less 
than the acceptable cancer risk of 1.0E-4. ILCR values of 3.2E-4 for Cd and 
2.2E-04 for Cr at 0.9 probability remained lower than the corresponding values 
of 9E-4 (Cd) and 3.1E-4 (Cr) estimated for the MAC values recommended for KSA. 
Monte Carlo simulations highlighted Zn (59.5%), Cr (18.1%), and exposure time 
(10.5%) as the primary contributors to variations in non-cancer health risks to 
infants. Cd (60.1%) and Cr (46.2%) concentrations, along with exposure time 
(12.6% for Cd and 25.8% for Cr), were identified as key contributors to ILCR 
variations. The estimated heavy metal pollution indices at 0.95 probability 
indicate non-contaminated groundwater. The study offers insights into the health 
risks and guidelines for treating raw water at the household level, promoting 
agricultural sustainability in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere.

Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a life-threatening complication in patients 
undergoing cancer chemotherapy. This multicentric retrospective study aimed to 
evaluate the microbiological profile and factors affecting 30-day mortality in 
FN patients with solid malignancies. FN defined as single episode of oral 
temperature of > 101 °F (≥ 38.3 °C), with an absolute neutrophil count 
(ANC) < 500cells/mm3 or ANC which is expected to decrease to < 500cells/mm3 over 
next 48 h. All episodes of FN data that occurred between May 2021 and April 2023 
were collected from three tertiary-care cancer centres and analysed. Among 710 
patients who received chemotherapy over two years, 70 (9.8%) experienced FN. 
Antibiotic therapy was administered according to published guidelines. Of the 
106 different cultures analysed, microbiological isolates were obtained from 23 
(21.6%) cultures. Gram-negative bacteria were predominant (60.8%), followed by 
Gram-positive bacteria (30.43%). On the last day of follow-up, 52 (74.28%) 
patients were alive and 18 (25.71%) were dead. The 30-day mortality was 
significantly higher in patients with ANC < 500 cells/mm3 at the time of 
presentation (p = 0.001), who had positive cultures (p = 0.001), who developed 
FN on first-line chemotherapy (p = 0.020) and patients who did not receive 
prophylactic G-CSF support (p = 0.001). FN is a serious complication in patients 
undergoing chemotherapy for solid malignancies. This study identifies 
microbiological patterns and factors associated with higher 30-day mortality in 
FN among solid malignancy patients, suggesting areas for improved early 
recognition and tailored management.

Accurate detection and classification of clinically significant prostate cancer 
remain critical challenges in medical imaging. Despite numerous studies focusing 
on feature extraction and classification, none have systematically assessed the 
impact of harmonization techniques on multicenter imaging data. This study aimed 
to improve diagnostic performance by integrating harmonization via unsupervised 
clustering with clinical variables into machine learning models, even when the 
source center is unknown. We extracted features from T2-weighted magnetic 
resonance images using two approaches: handcrafted radiomics and deep 
learning-based representations obtained via a 3D convolutional autoencoder 
architecture. To address inter-center variability, the data were harmonized 
using an unsupervised clustering approach that generated 19 distinct clusters, 
followed by ComBat harmonization. Machine learning classifiers were then trained 
with and without the inclusion of clinical variables (prostate-specific antigen 
levels and patient age). The models were evaluated using multiple metrics. 
Harmonization significantly improved classification performance. In particular, 
models based on 3D convolutional autoencoder-derived features achieved an 
accuracy of 75.33% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.74. The incorporation 
of clinical variables further enhanced model performance; the best model 
combining radiomics features with clinical data attained an accuracy of 77.67% 
and an AUC of 0.85. These performance metrics are concurrent with those reported 
in the literature for this challenge, demonstrating that our novel approach can 
effectively mitigate inter-center variability and enhance diagnostic accuracy. 
Our findings underscore the potential of harmonization via unsupervised 
clustering, combined with the inclusion of clinical variables, to significantly 
enhance the diagnostic performance of machine learning models for prostate 
cancer detection. This novel strategy not only addresses a gap in the current 
literature but also produces performance metrics comparable to those reported in 
multicenter studies, thereby supporting the development of robust, clinically 
applicable diagnostic tools.

COVID-19 severity is uneven between genders. A role for sex hormones is possible 
and has been postulated. Considering this idea, we hypothesized hormonal 
therapies might influence the severity of COVID-19 in breast cancer (BC) 
patients. We mined the Emilia-Romagna region (Italy) registries to compare the 
rates of hospitalization and mortality by COVID-19 in 2020 amongst 22,987 BC 
patients treated with tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors (AIs), fulvestrant, and 
anti-HER2 therapies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab) in 2020, the latter used as 
reference group. The hospitalization rate observed in 4719 tamoxifen-treated BC 
patients was the lowest (0.61%, OR, 0.38; 90% CI, 0.20-0.76; p = 0.03) among 
hormonal therapies. Importantly, only one COVID-19 fatality was observed in 
tamoxifen-treated BC patients, who showed a striking 0.02% COVID-19 death 
frequency as compared to 0.24% observed for the whole BC patients population. In 
addition, tamoxifen emerged in the sex and age adjusted analysis as the only 
agent significantly decreasing the standard mortality rate (SMR) by COVID-19 as 
compared to the regional population consisting of 2,296,559 female residents 
from the Emilia Romagna region in 2020. Our results show that BC patients are at 
increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and that COVID-19 mortality is 
hindered by SERM-based therapies like tamoxifen. These findings are relevant to 
choose adequate treatments in order to protect cancer patients from concomitant 
SARS-CoV-2 contagion and related symptoms and contribute to the idea that SERMs 
could be used as prophylactic agents and therapeutics to prevent the progression 
of severity of COVID-19.

Kaempferia parviflora (black ginger) is a tropical edible medicinal plant with 
valuable rhizome product used in the pharmaceutical industry for wide beneficial 
health effects in curing various diseases. The current study aims to analyse 
compounds present in rhizome oil using Gas Chromatography-Time of Flight-Mass 
Spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS). Hydro distillation was used to extract the essential 
oil from the plant rhizomes. 129 compounds were identified by GC TOF-MS 
analysis, with the main components being benzenepropanol, à-methyl-acetate 
(9.78 ± 0.01%), camphene (9.39 ± 0.01%), α-pinene (7.50 ± 0.01%), linalool 
(5.46 ± 0.01%), and camphore (5.04 ± 0.01%). Moreover, in this investigation, 
Benzenepropanol, à-methyl-, acetate, is Reported for the first time as a major 
constituent. The cytotoxic potential of the oil was assessed using the 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay against 
a broad spectrum of human cancer cell lines, including the IC50 value of A549 
(38.73 ± 0.01 µg/mL), A431 (68.33 ± 0.02 µg/mL), HCT-15 (68.33 ± 0.01 µg/mL), KB 
(88.57 ± 0.03 µg/mL), LN-18 (43.23 ± 0.01 µg/mL), Panc-1 (46.68 ± 0.01 µg/mL), 
and SKBR-3(11.79 ± 0.01 µg/mL). HEK293 (non-cancer cell line) was also included 
to check its cytotoxicity towards normal cells. Antimicrobial activities were 
assessed against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus 
epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans using disc diffusion 
method, showing highest zone of inhibition (ZOI) against Klebsiella pneumoniae, 
Candida albicans (30 ± 0.01 mm) and the lowest against Bacillus subtilis 
(16 ± 0.02 mm). The antioxidant activity revealed better IC50 values in both 
2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) as 0.50 ± 0.01 mg/ml and 
2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) as 
0.40 ± 0.01 mg/ml assays. Hence, the obtained cytotoxic, antimicrobial and 
antioxidant potential of the tested oil, proved the potent quality of the 
Kaempferia parviflora oil. Hence, it can be used as an alternative antibiotic as 
well as antioxidant agent in the field of medicine and its commercialization in 
the global market.

Circular single-stranded DNA (cssDNA), an emerging nucleic acid vector, exhibits 
significant clinical potential for treating genetic disorders, enabling gene 
editing, and advancing oncotherapy. Its unique attributes, including high 
stability, structural simplicity, conformational flexibility, and low molecular 
mass, establish it as a promising gene therapy tool. Our study reveals that 
cssDNA demonstrates superior expression efficiency over conventional plasmids 
across diverse tumor cell lines. Notably, cssDNA expression is enhanced under 
certain tumor microenvironment (TME) conditions (glucose deficiency, glutamine 
deficiency and hypoxia) compared to normal condition. Mechanistically, these TME 
conditions induce significant cell cycle perturbations, particularly pronounced 
G1 arrest. Intriguingly, transfected cssDNA expression peaks during the late 
G2/M phase, immediately preceding entry into the G1 phase. We further identify 
S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) as a critical regulator of cssDNA 
expression under TME conditions. SKP2 inhibition directly or indirectly notably 
enhances the expression levels of cssDNA. These findings confirm cssDNA's 
advantages as a gene expression vector and how specific TME conditions modulate 
its expression via cell cycle and SKP2-dependent mechanisms in vitro. This work 
provides a scientific foundation for cssDNA-based cancer therapy and opens new 
avenues for future clinical translation.

This retrospective study investigated the impact of preoperative comorbidities 
on postoperative complications and survival in 408 head and neck cancer (HNC) 
patients undergoing complete tumor resection for curative intent. The mean age 
was 62.5 ± 13.2 years; 58.6% were male, 32.4% had pT3-4 tumors, and 27.5% had 
pN1-3 disease. Comorbidities were present in 70.6%, primarily hypertension 
(36.8%), cardiac disease (24.5%), endocrine/metabolic diseases (21.6%), 
pulmonary diseases (13.2%), and cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs, 10.8%). The 
overall postoperative medical/surgical complications rate was 24.7% (medical: 
8.1%, surgical: 18.4%). Patients with comorbidities had higher complication 
rates (28.1% overall, 9.4% medical, 20.5% surgical). CVDs (20.5% vs. 6.6%), 
cardiac disease (14.0% vs. 6.2%), and endocrine/metabolic diseases (13.6% vs. 
6.6%) significantly increased medical complication risks. Multivariable analysis 
identified tumor located in oral cavity, ASA grade III-IV, prolonged operation 
(> 3 h), flap reconstruction, and tracheotomy as independent risk factors for 
complications. Survival analysis showed reduced overall survival in patients 
with higher ASA grades, cervical lymph node metastasis, or history of 
preoperative adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy). The findings highlight that preoperative CVDs, cardiac 
disease, or endocrine/metabolic disorders elevate medical complication risks by 
2-3 times, underscoring the need for thorough preoperative assessment to improve 
outcomes in HNC surgery.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of resection margins on 
rates of local control in patients with myxofibrosarcoma (MFS). We performed a 
retrospective cohort study of 135 patients with myxofibrosarcoma, treated at the 
Department of Orthopaedics of the Medical University of Vienna in Austria from 
December 1999 to October 2023. Resection margins were analysed with Enneking's 
established classification scheme as well as Union internationale contre le 
cancer (UICC) classification. Local recurrence (LR) was reported for 14 patients 
(10.37%). There was no statistically significance for the influence of width of 
resection margins (neither UICC classification system, nor Enneking's) on the LR 
rate, except for R1-dir status in the UICC-classification (p = 0.028), meaning 
there was microscopic tumour contamination of margins or resection alongside and 
macroscopic residual tumour in R2a status (p = 0.037). There was no statistical 
difference of resection with wide or marginal resection margins. We can 
carefully suppose that width of resection margins do not seem to be crucial for 
local recurrence in MFS, although there is a significant risk for local 
recurrence in R1 resections. Further investigations on the risk factors for 
local recurrence are needed.

The NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 trial represents a paradigm shift in breast cancer 
management, showing that patients achieving nodal clearance after neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy derive no added benefit from regional nodal irradiation. These 
results challenge long-standing practice, promotes de-escalation, and raise 
biologically significant questions, particularly regarding immunologic 
mechanisms and clinical subgroup variations.

Organelle-targeted drug delivery (OTDD) is an advanced strategy in the field of 
precision medicine, which delivers therapeutic agents to subcellular organelles. 
The OTDD provides a more targeted and efficient approach for neurodegenerative, 
cancer, and metabolic disorders, by addressing the root cause of diseases that 
are associated with organelle dysfunction. The recent advances in nanotechnology 
have enabled intelligent drug carriers, which have the potential to target 
organelles. This study aimed to explore the recent advancements in OTDD, 
emphasizing the role of nanocarriers, targeting approaches, and 
stimulus-responsive systems to enhance therapeutic accuracy and overcome major 
challenges in clinical translation. This review discusses advanced progress in 
OTDD, focusing on various nanocarriers. It discusses the function of targeting 
moieties, including peptides and ligands, as well as stimuli-responsive drug 
delivery systems that are activated by intracellular stimuli, like pH or 
reactive oxygen species, capable of targeting the delivery of the drug using 
organelles. Moreover, challenges in clinical translation, regulatory issues, and 
patient-specific factors are analyzed. OTDD advancements have shown promising 
preclinical and clinical outcomes in enhancing drug targeting and therapeutic 
efficiency. However, its clinical use involves barriers in standardization, 
regulatory approvals, and disease-specific variation, which primarily hinder its 
clinical application. Personalized strategies need to be employed to enhance the 
outcome of therapy. The OTDD has the potential to revolutionize subcellular 
precision medicine by providing specific drugs for different diseases. 
Interdisciplinary collaboration is required to address the existing challenges 
and facilitate clinical translation, thereby improving patient- specific 
therapeutic approaches.

Liver cancer is a highly aggressive malignancy, and bone metastasis is a severe 
complication that negatively affects prognosis and quality of life. However, the 
molecular mechanisms underlying liver cancer bone metastasis remain poorly 
understood. This review examined recent advances related to 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and 
liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs), with a focus on surface markers, interactions 
within bone marrow (BM) niche, and relevant signaling pathways. Liver cancer 
bone metastasis is driven by EMT activation, CTC dissemination, and LCSC 
colonization in BM niches. Surface markers such as CD133, CD44, CD90, CD13, 
EpCAM, and OV6 contribute to tumor heterogeneity, dormancy, and therapy 
resistance. Key processes such as BM homing, osteolysis, and immune suppression 
are regulated through the osteoblast-osteoclast-cancer stem cell (OB-OC-CSC) 
axis and CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling. Dormancy-regulating molecules, including 
Annexin II, GAS6, osteopontin, TSP-1, tenascin C, and fibronectin, further 
determine CSCs' quiescence or reactivation. These insights highlighted the 
complexity of liver cancer bone metastasis, and suggested potential therapeutic 
strategies targeting EMT, LCSCs, and OB-OC-CSC crosstalk. Future studies are 
encouraged to validate marker functions in clinical cohorts, elucidate 
dormancy-exit mechanisms, and explore immunomodulatory interventions to overcome 
microenvironment-mediated resistance.

Cancer is a widespread disease that often causes severe pain, significantly 
reducing patients' quality of life and increasing the overall burden of the 
illness. Managing cancer pain effectively remains a major clinical challenge. 
Metabolism is a fundamental biological process that involves both the breaking 
down of substances to produce energy (catabolism) and the building of complex 
molecules (anabolism). Cancer cells exhibit altered energy metabolism, including 
glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, glutaminolysis, and lipid metabolism. 
Emerging research suggests that these metabolic changes can amplify cancer pain 
through specific signalling pathways, such as AMPK and PI3K/AKT. Targeting these 
metabolic pathways offers a promising approach for pain relief. This review 
explores the link between cancer pain and energy metabolism, highlighting 
potential new therapeutic strategies aimed at metabolic targets.

<p> Introduction: Breast cancer remains a critical global health issue, 
particularly in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations, which lead to genomic 
instability and increased cancer susceptibility. While PARP inhibitors targeting 
PARP1 and PARP2 have shown clinical success through synthetic lethality, PARP15, 
a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase involved in DNA repair and tumour progression, 
remains largely understudied. </p><p> Method: A structure-based virtual 
screening approach was applied to identify potential PARP15 inhibitors. The 
screening was performed on a Bioactive Screening Compound Library consisting of 
over 12,200 druglike small molecules. Using the MTiOpenScreen platform, 1,500 
candidate compounds were initially shortlisted. Molecular docking was then 
conducted to identify top-binding compounds, followed by 500- nanosecond 
molecular dynamics simulations to assess complex stability. Principal component 
analysis (PCA), free energy landscape (FEL) evaluation, and absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profiling were also performed to 
characterise compound behaviour and drug-likeness. </p><p> Results: Three 
compounds, F2002-0551, F2028-0309, and F1495-1822, emerged with docking scores 
surpassing the known PARP15 inhibitor, Niraparib. Molecular dynamics simulations 
confirmed their structural stability with low RMSD values and favourable FELs. 
PCA revealed consistent ligand dynamics, and ADME analysis showed high 
gastrointestinal absorption and other drug-like characteristics. Superimposition 
analysis demonstrated minimal deviation in docked poses, indicating strong and 
stable interactions with PARP15. </p><p> Discussion: These results highlight the 
therapeutic potential of the selected compounds as novel PARP15 inhibitors. 
Their favourable binding stability and pharmacokinetic profiles support their 
candidacy for further development against BRCA-mutated breast cancer. </p><p> 
Conclusion: F2002-0551, F2028-0309, and F1495-1822 represent promising leads for 
PARP15 inhibition. This study offers a computational foundation for future 
experimental validation and therapeutic exploration in BRCA-associated breast 
cancer.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains a prevalent and aggressive 
malignancy, characterized by a lack of targeted therapies and limited clinical 
benefits. Here, we conducted an optimized whole-genome CRISPR screen across five 
HNSCC cell lines aimed at identifying actionable genetic vulnerabilities for 
rapid preclinical evaluation as novel targeted therapies. Given their critical 
role in cancer, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) were prioritized for further 
investigation. Among these, CDK7 was identified as an essential and targetable 
gene across all five cell lines, prompting its selection for in-depth functional 
and molecular characterization. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of CDK7 
significantly and consistently reduced tumor cell proliferation due to 
generalized cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. Additionally, CDK7 
knockout (KO) and selective inhibitors (YKL-5-124 and samuraciclib) demonstrated 
potent antitumor activity, effectively suppressing tumor growth in HNSCC 
patient-derived organoids (PDOs), as well as in both cell line- and 
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models with minimal toxicity. 
Mechanistically, CDK7 inhibition led to a broad downregulation of gene sets 
related to cell cycle progression and DNA repair, and significantly reduced the 
transcription of essential genes and untargetable vulnerabilities identified by 
our CRISPR screen. These findings highlight CDK7 as a promising therapeutic 
target for HNSCC. Our study provides strong evidence of the robust antitumor 
activity of CDK7-selective inhibition in disease-relevant preclinical models, 
strongly supporting its progression to clinical testing.

HERPUD1 is a protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that is sensitive to the 
unfolded protein response (UPR) induced during ER stress and has been linked to 
ER stress tolerance in cancer cells. Many tumors, including triple-negative 
breast cancer (TNBC), which lacks an effective treatment, display UPR activity 
as a malignancy trait. However, whether HERPUD1 provides an ER-dependent 
mechanistic link for tumorigenic agents and/or potential therapeutic targets 
remains unknown. To address these possibilities, we first analyzed HERPUD1 
expression in breast cancer (BC) biopsies via immunohistochemistry and 
immunofluorescence, revealing significantly higher levels in BC, including 
luminal A and TNBC, compared to non-malignant tissue. In TNBC, in addition to 
epithelial cells, HERPUD1 associated with inflammatory infiltrates, highlighting 
its potential role in tumor progression. Palmitic acid (PA), a dietary saturated 
fatty acid, is an obesity-associated tumor risk factor that induces ER stress 
and activates UPR. Interestingly, MDA-MB-231 cells, but not other BC cell lines, 
specifically upregulate HERPUD1 together with XBP1s and ATF4, key UPR factors, 
in response to PA, whereas TG treatment elevated HERPUD1 across all tested cell 
lines. HERPUD1 silencing reduced TNBC cell proliferation, migration, and 
invasion while enhancing doxorubicin (DOX) cytotoxicity, in both 2D and 3D cell 
culture models. HERPUD1 ablation also elevated UPR activation under TG. In 
contrast, PA-induced stress led to reduced UPR activation and lower IL-6 and 
IL-8 levels in the absence of HERPUD1 expression. We identified CK2 as a kinase 
that regulates HERPUD1 stability via Ser-59 phosphorylation. Strikingly, 
inhibition of CK2 with CX-4945 not only reduced HERPUD1 levels but also 
increased the sensitivity of BC cells to DOX. HERPUD1-S59D phosphomimetic 
mutants showed opposite effects.Our findings establish HERPUD1 as a key mediator 
of PA-driven aggressiveness, dependent on the lipid-handling capacity of TNBC 
cells and reveals a mechanistic to lipid stress and tumor progression.

Targeted therapies in cancer are limited by cells exhibiting drug tolerance. We 
aimed to target drug tolerance in order to delay the development of acquired 
resistance. In melanoma, tolerance to MAPK pathway inhibitors is associated with 
loss of SOX10 and an enhanced TEAD transcriptional program. We show that loss of 
SOX10 is sufficient to up-regulate TEAD targets with dependence on the 
co-activator, TAZ. Active TAZ is sufficient to mediate tolerance to BRAF 
inhibitors and MEK inhibitors. We develop two covalent inhibitors, OPN-9643 and 
OPN-9652, designed to target the central palmitate binding pocket of TEADs. In 
SOX10-deficient cells, OPN-9643 and OPN-9652 reduce TEAD-dependent reporter 
activity and expression of TEAD targets, CTGF and CYR61. OPN-9643 and OPN-9652 
treatment enhances the inhibitory effects of MAPK-targeted therapies in 2D and 
3D growth assays in SOX10 knockout cells and reverses tolerance mediated by 
active TAZ. In vivo, OPN-9652 delays the onset of acquired resistance to BRAF 
inhibitors and MEK inhibitors from minimal residual disease. Thus, TAZ-TEAD 
activity plays an important role in melanoma drug tolerance and the development 
of acquired resistance.

Reshaping metabolic compartmentalization is frequently observed in cancer cells, 
however, the underlying mechanisms and physiological implications are less 
known. Here, we show that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients with 
low integral membrane protein SMIM4 expression exhibits a poor prognosis and 
reduces oxidative stress in tumors, which can be confirmed in cultured human 
PDAC cells and mice Pdx1-Cre/KrasG12D/+/Trp53R172H/+ (KPC) cells. 
Mechanistically, SMIM4 interacts with and facilitates the assembly of 
SLC25A1-containing complexes, enabling SLC25A1-mediated malate/citrate exchange. 
Depleting SMIM4 has little effect on mitochondrial respiration but impairs the 
assembly of SLC25A1-containing complexes, thereby reshaping of malate 
compartmentalization. This shift promotes NADPH generation through increased 
cytosolic conversion of malate to pyruvate, protecting cells from glucose 
deprivation-induced apoptosis. Moreover, PDAC cells with low level of SMIM4 are 
resistant to RSL3-induced toxicity, indicating that PDAC tumors with high SMIM4 
expression are promising candidates for treatment with oxidative stress 
inducers.

SOLACE2 (ACTRN12618000686202) investigates whether 12-weeks of olaparib, or 
cyclophosphamide-olaparib priming, improves subsequent durvalumab-olaparib 
progression-free survival (PFS), and is superior to olaparib monotherapy without 
any priming, in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer (n = 114). We also 
evaluate the utility of CUP-CC assay, an immune signature of C-C chemokine 
receptor type 4 up-regulation, chemokines, and cytokines. Priming with olaparib, 
or cyclophosphamide-olaparib, followed by durvalumab-olaparib, are both 
associated with longer PFS compared to olaparib monotherapy, but do not reach 
the pre-specified primary endpoint of 36-week trial threshold (PFS36). PFS36 
rates are 47.4% (95% CI, 31.0-62.1; olaparib priming then olaparib-durvalumab), 
48.7% (32.5-63.2; olaparib-cyclophosphamide then olaparib-durvalumab) and 35.1% 
(20.4-50.3; olaparib monotherapy). PFS is significantly longer for the 
homologous recombination deficient (N = 71) as compared to the proficient (HRP) 
(N = 29) subgroups (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.55, 0.35-0.87). CUP-CC+ subgroup 
(N = 58) has a significantly longer PFS (HR 0.31, 0.19-0.49) than CUP-CC- 
(N = 46). Future studies should investigate whether CUP-CC has the potential to 
personalize poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor therapies for patients who 
are BRCA wild-type, including HRP patients.

AIM: To evaluate long-term colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and faecal 
immunochemical test (FIT) performance in patients with low-risk symptoms over 
5 years, and to examine factors influencing outcomes and mortality.
METHOD: We followed 3501 symptomatic patients who underwent FIT in primary care 
(October-December 2019) across 225 practices in England. Building on our 
18-month study, patients were tracked for 5 years using primary and secondary 
care records to identify new cancers and deaths.
RESULTS: Ten additional CRCs were diagnosed during extended follow-up 
(18-60 months), beyond the 45 identified in the first 18 months. Seven of these 
had initial negative FIT results. FIT sensitivity at ≥10 μg/g fell from 94.1% at 
18 months to 80.0% (95% CI 67.0-89.6%) at 5 years, while specificity was 80.8% 
(95% CI 79.4-82.1%). The positive predictive value was 6.2% (95% CI 5.4-7.2%) 
and the negative predictive value 99.6% (95% CI 99.3-99.8%). Patients with 
negative FITs experienced a significantly longer time to CRC diagnosis than 
those with positive FITs (median 28 vs 1 month, HR 16.4, p < 0.001). Positive 
FITs were also linked to higher overall cancer risk (HR 1.63, p = 0.0076) and 
greater 5-year mortality (24.9% vs 11.9%, HR 2.8, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: FIT performance decreases over longer follow-up, with 12.7% of CRCs 
detected after initially negative results. Positive FITs were associated with 
increased mortality and overall cancer risk. These findings highlight the 
importance of robust safety-netting strategies for patients with negative FIT 
results.

IntroductionDNA methylation has emerged as a promising tool for the early 
detection of ovarian cancer. Consequently, accurate and cost-effective methods 
for detecting DNA methylation are essential. Although the Infinium Methylation 
Array provides broad coverage, its high cost limits clinical utility. Bisulfite 
Sequencing (BS) represents a potential alternative for biomarker validation and 
diagnostic assay development, provided it can reliably reproduce array-based 
methylation profiles. This study aims to assess the concordance between BS and 
Infinium Methylation Array data in ovarian cancer tissues and cervical 
swabs.MethodsDNA from 55 ovarian cancer tissues and 25 cervical swabs underwent 
bisulfite conversion and was analyzed using the Infinium Methylation Array and a 
custom BS panel. We compared the results, focusing on overall methylation 
levels, Spearman correlation between beta values, and Bland-Altman analysis. We 
also assessed whether sample clustering patterns by diagnosis were consistent 
across methods.ResultsMethylation profiles generated by bisulfite sequencing 
were consistent with those obtained using the Infinium Methylation Array. We 
observed strong sample-wise correlation between platforms, particularly in 
ovarian tissue samples. Agreement was slightly lower in cervical swabs, likely 
due to reduced DNA quality. Diagnostic clustering patterns were broadly 
preserved across both methods.ConclusionOur results show that BS can reliably 
replicate results from the Infinium Methylation Array and presents a 
cost-effective option for analyzing larger sample sets. Moreover, our work may 
serve as a best-practice guide, as it highlights key challenges associated with 
working with sequencing library preparation.

Plain Language Summary: DNA methylation is a natural chemical modification of 
DNA that can influence how genes are switched on or off. Changes in methylation 
patterns are often seen in cancers, including ovarian cancer, which makes DNA 
methylation a promising marker for cancer detection. In this study, we compared 
two different laboratory methods for measuring DNA methylation: the Infinium 
Methylation Array (Illumina) and bisulfite sequencing. These techniques differ 
in cost, the amount of DNA required, and whether they focus on pre-selected or 
custom targets. We tested both methods using DNA from ovarian tissue samples and 
cervical swabs collected during routine cervical cancer screening. Our results 
show that the two methods produce comparable results, suggesting that bisulfite 
sequencing may offer a reliable and more affordable alternative for larger 
studies.

Low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC) is a rare and clinically distinct 
subtype of ovarian cancer, which presents unique challenges in diagnosis and 
treatment. LGSOC is characterized by low proliferation rates, high expression of 
hormone receptors, and frequent alterations in the mitogen-activated protein 
kinase (MAPK) pathway. Initial standard treatment includes cytoreductive surgery 
followed by platinum-based chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. However, high 
recurrence rates (~80%) and poor responses to chemotherapy underscore the urgent 
need for new treatment strategies. Endocrine therapy is being investigated in 
the upfront setting, and recent advances in targeted therapies, including MAPK 
pathway inhibitors and investigational agents such as cyclin-dependent kinase 4 
and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors, are shaping the evolving LGSOC treatment landscape. 
Notably, the recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of the 
avutometinib/defactinib combination for KRAS-mutated recurrent LGSOC marks a 
significant milestone in targeted therapy for this disease. Despite these 
advances, challenges remain in optimizing sequencing strategies and overcoming 
acquired resistance. This review addresses the importance of understanding the 
distinct pathophysiology of LGSOC, diagnostic challenges, limitations of 
conventional treatments, and evolving therapeutic approaches in LGSOC.

Thermal ablation has emerged as a frontline clinical intervention for treating 
various malignant tumors, yet its therapeutic efficacy in perivascular 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is severely limited owing to the indiscriminate 
thermal injury to critical vascular structures. In this study, we demonstrate a 
magnetothermodynamic strategy wherein intracellular magnetic hyperthermia (IMH) 
thermally enhances tumor-specific chemodynamic reactivity, generating a 
synergistic cytotoxic effect that selectively kills cancer cells while sparing 
critical normal tissue. Leveraging ferrimagnetic vortex-domain iron oxide 
nanorings (FVIOs) as mediators of this strategy, we show that IMH induces a 
2.16-fold greater susceptibility in Hepa1-6 cancer cells compared to AML-12 
hepatocytes (intracellular IC50: 21.26 vs 45.97 pg Fe/cell), as quantified by a 
modified selectivity index defined as the IC50 ratio of normal to tumor cells. 
Mechanistic studies revealed that the localized heating effect of IMH 
selectively amplifies Fenton reactivity in tumor cells, resulting in a 1.47-fold 
increase in cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals' generation compared to normal 
hepatocytes. Correspondingly, therapeutic selectivity was primarily 
redox-driven, with oxidative stress accounting for 72% of the total effect, as 
determined using γ-FVIOs controls that generate comparable heat but negligible 
hydroxyl radicals, while only 28% was attributable to thermal injury alone. In a 
rabbit VX2 perivascular HCC model, FVIO-mediated magnetothermodynamic therapy 
achieved an 88.47% tumor inhibition rate within 20 days, while preserving 
vascular integrity and sparing normal hepatocytes. This magnetothermodynamic 
paradigm leverages tumor-intrinsic redox vulnerabilities to overcome the 
anatomical limitations of thermal ablation, establishing a blueprint for 
precision treatment of vasculature-adjacent malignancies.

Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which is under the control of T cell factor/lymphocyte 
enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factors, plays a pivotal role during 
carcinogenesis through the regulation of cancer cell proliferation and 
differentiation. Thus, it is likely that an inhibitor against this pro-oncogenic 
pathway might be a promising anti-cancer drug candidate. In the present study, 
we have synthesized a novel polyamide (WNT-Chb) composed of N-methylpyrrole, 
N-methylimidazole, and DNA alkylator chlorambucil, and examined its anti-cancer 
effect on colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Based on our results, WNT-Chb 
preferentially bound to a consensus TCF/LEF-responsive element (5'-CCTTTGA-3'), 
and suppressed multiple Wnt-target gene expression. Consistent with these 
results, WNT-Chb attenuated in vitro proliferation and in vivo tumor growth of 
colon cancer cells with an aberrantly activated Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Together, 
these findings strongly suggest that the originally produced WNT-Chb might be a 
novel anti-cancer drug candidate against Wnt/β-catenin pathway-dependent colon 
cancers.

There are barriers to the clinical use of cisplatin-based neoadjuvant regimens 
in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), especially for patients with renal 
dysfunction, hearing loss, heart diseases, or other severe comorbidities. 
Favorable efficacy and safety of disitamab vedotin (DV), an antibody-drug 
conjugate targeting HER2, have recently been demonstrated in urothelial 
carcinoma. We explored neoadjuvant gemcitabine combined with RC48 in the MIBC 
setting. Initially, 26 patients with clinical stage T2-4a Nx M0 MIBC and a HER2 
immunohistochemical expression score of 2+/3+ were enrolled. The neoadjuvant 
regime comprised DV (2 mg/kg intravenous infusion, day 1) and gemcitabine 
(1000 mg/m2 intravenous infusion, day 2) in a 14-d cycle. Thirteen patients 
received three cycles, and the other 13 patients received four cycles, in a 
nonrandomized manner. Subsequently, 22 patients underwent radical cystectomy 
(RC). Postoperative pathology revealed a pathological complete response (pCR) 
rate of 59% (13/22) among RC patients, 40% (4/10) of whom had received three 
cycles and 75% (9/12), four cycles. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed pCR 
rates of 50% (13/26) overall, 31% (4/13) for the three-cycle group, and 69% 
(9/13) for the four-cycle group. At median follow-up of 16.9 mo, 25 patients 
remained event-free. Treatment-related adverse events primarily included 
aspartate aminotransferase elevation (35%), alanine aminotransferase elevation 
(38%), a decrease in appetite (23%), alopecia (23%), and sensory neuropathy 
(23%). Validation of the long-term efficacy of this regimen is required.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness of 
contemporary systemic treatment options across patients with metastatic 
hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) across clinically relevant prognostic 
subgroups (synchronous high [SHV] and low [SLV] volume, and metachronous high 
[MHV] and low [MLV] volume).
METHODS: This living network meta-analysis was conducted using the living 
interactive evidence (LIvE) synthesis framework. Phase 3 randomized controlled 
trials assessing treatment intensification with androgen receptor pathway 
inhibitors (ARPIs), docetaxel (D), or both were included. Mixed treatment 
comparisons were conducted for overall population and for each prognostic 
subgroup (SHV, SLV, MHV, and MLV). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free 
survival were assessed.
KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: The current report of a living systematic review 
includes a total of 11 trials (12 668 patients and 12 unique treatments). In the 
overall population, the results were consistent with those of a previous report. 
An analysis of OS by prespecified subgroups included nine clinical trials (8990 
patients and eight unique treatments). In the SHV subgroup (N = 5171; 57%), 
ARPI + D + androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) led to a statistically significant 
improvement in OS compared with D + ADT (hazard ratio: 0.72; 95% confidence 
interval: 0.62-0.83) and ARPI + ADT (0.71; 0.53-0.97). In the SLV subgroup 
(N = 2455; 27%), ARPI + ADT led to a statistically significant improvement 
compared with ADT alone (0.65; 0.52-0.80). There was no statistically 
significant difference between ARPI + D + ADT and ARPI + ADT (1.08; 0.65-1.79). 
In the MHV subgroup (N = 589; 6.5%), no statistically significant improvement 
was observed with ARPI + D + ADT compared with ARPI + ADT (0.89; 0.43-1.85) and 
D + ADT (0.90; 0.60-1.36). There was no statistically significant difference 
between ARPI + ADT and D + ADT (1.02; 0.45-2.28). In the MLV subgroup (N = 775; 
8.5%), ARPI + ADT led to a statistically significant improvement compared with 
ADT alone (0.43; 0.29-0.64) and D + ADT (0.41; 0.24-0.70). There was no 
statistically significant difference between ARPI + D + ADT and ARPI + ADT 
(1.56; 0.40-6.25). Inherent limitations of this analysis include the inability 
to account for all relevant variables such as the patient- and cancer-related 
factors that likely influenced the decision of physicians to offer docetaxel to 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Current evidence suggests that triplet 
systemic therapy is preferred for patients with SHV mHSPC who are fit for 
docetaxel. Androgen receptor pathway doublet therapy is preferred for all other 
patient subgroups compared with ADT alone. There is no role of docetaxel doublet 
in patients with access to ARPI therapy and if they are able to receive it.

INTRODUCTION: Data regarding outcomes for laparoscopic and robotic total 
gastrectomy with extended lymph node dissection is lacking. This study presents 
favorable outcomes for both laparoscopic and robotic total gastrectomy with 
extended lymphadenectomy in patients with gastric cancer treated at a 
single-surgeon center.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on all patients who underwent 
laparoscopic or robotic total gastrectomy for gastric cancer between January 
2017 and January 2023.
RESULTS: 26 patients were identified with 7 patients in the laparoscopic cohort 
and 19 patients in the robotic cohort. Median operative time was 4 ​h and 45 
​min. Median length of stay was 7 days. The median number of nodes retrieved was 
19.5. Two of the 26 (7.7 ​%) patients had an esophageal leak managed with 
esophageal stent placement. There were no deaths within 30 days. Three year 
survival and five year survival were favorable at 71.4 ​% and 58.6 ​%.
CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive total gastrectomy with extended lymphadenectomy 
is a safe approach for gastric cancer that results in a low rate of 
complications and adequate nodal dissection.

INTRODUCTION: Frail and older patients who develop prostate cancer (PCa), are at 
risk of overtreatment. Multiple general health assessment (GHA) tools have been 
validated in oncology. we aim to validate and compare the performance of the G8 
screening tool, age and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) as a predictor of 
overall survival (OS) in men older than 70 years with a newly diagnosed prostate 
cancer. Is it possible to identify a CCI cut-off indicative for frailty?
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2009 and 2015, a national multicenter initiative 
on geriatric screening and GHA's took place in Belgium. Baseline characteristics 
were collected on the date of inclusion on which a specialist nurse completed 
multiple GHA questionnaires for each patient. We performed a sub analysis on the 
prostate cancer (n = 182) cohort, ≥ 70 years old. GHA's were compared through 
multivariate-, Kaplan-Meier- and sensitivity analysis. If indicated, 
Case-control matching was applied to reduce variate heterogeneity. Ten-year OS 
is the primary endpoint.
RESULTS: Men with a G8-score of ≤14 points had a significantly worse OS both in 
the unmatched: 86.8 months (95% CI: 70.5-103.1) vs. 137.9 months (95% CI: 
129.4-146.4) (P < .001) and matched population: 99.3 months (95% CI 81.9-116.73) 
vs. 136.0 months (95% CI: 121.8-150.2) (P < .05). Defining frailty as the 
presence of comorbidities (CCI ≥ 1 point) shows inferior (HR:1.3, 95% CI: 
0.8-2.1-AUC: 0.583) accuracy compared to the G8-score (HR 2.9, 95% CI 
1.8-4.5-AUC: 0.715). If the frailty threshold of the CCI is raised to ≥ 2 
points, accuracy is matched (HR 4.9, 95% CI 2.8-8.4-AUC 0.735).
CONCLUSION: This multicenter analysis validates the predictive value of the 
G8-score and CCI on OS in newly diagnosed PCa in the older patient. Both GHA's 
appear more accurate than age. A CCI ≥ 2 points approximates the sensitivity of 
G8 defined frailty. External validation of these findings is needed.

BACKGROUND: ERBB2 mutations are oncogenic drivers in 2% to 4% of lung cancers 
and potentially actionable using HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced ERBB2-mutant lung cancer entered 2 
phase 2 studies (PUMA-NER-4201 [4201]; PUMA-NER-5201 [SUMMIT]). Patients 
received neratinib (monotherapy 4201; monotherapy SUMMIT), or neratinib with 
weekly temsirolimus (combination 4201), or trastuzumab every 3 weeks 
(combination SUMMIT). Protocol-defined endpoints common to both studies were 
analyzed. Exploratory genomic analyses were conducted.
CLINICALTRIALS: gov: NCT01827267; NCT01953926.
RESULTS: Sixty patients in 4201 (neratinib, n = 17; neratinib plus temsirolimus, 
n = 43) and 78 in SUMMIT (neratinib, n = 26; neratinib plus trastuzumab, n = 52) 
received study treatment. Objective response rates were 0% (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.0-19.5; 4201) and 3.8% (95% CI, 0.1-19.6; SUMMIT) with 
neratinib, 14.0% (95% CI, 5.3-27.9) with neratinib plus temsirolimus, and 9.6% 
(95% CI, 3.2-21.0) with neratinib plus trastuzumab. Five patients whose tumors 
harbored ERBB2 exon 20 insertion, L755P and D769Y missense mutations, and a 
novel ERBB2-SHC1 fusion had responses ≥ 1 year (neratinib monotherapy, n = 1; 
SUMMIT; neratinib plus temsirolimus, n = 2; neratinib plus trastuzumab, n = 2). 
Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 23.5% (4201) and 34.6% 
(SUMMIT) of neratinib-treated patients, 37.2% of patients treated with neratinib 
plus temsirolimus, and 48.1% of patients treated with neratinib plus 
trastuzumab.
CONCLUSION: Single-agent neratinib has limited activity in ERBB2-mutated lung 
cancers. Combinations with temsirolimus or trastuzumab did not markedly improve 
overall outcomes, producing durable responses in a limited subset of patients.

BACKGROUND: While substantial research has focused on first-line (1L) therapies 
for advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC), less is known about the 
effectiveness of second-line (2L) treatments following disease progression on 
1L. The poor prognosis after 1L progression, limited guidance for 2L treatment, 
and constraints of clinical trials in addressing these questions underscore the 
need for real-world comparative effectiveness research.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis to compare real-world overall 
survival (rwOS) associated with 2L treatments among patients with disease 
progression during 1L. Eligible patients were selected from Flatiron Health's 
nationwide electronic health record (EHR)-derived de-identified database. 1L and 
2L treatments were categorized as chemotherapy-only (Chemo-alone), combination 
chemo- and immunotherapy (Chemo + Immuno), immunotherapy-only (IO-alone), 
targeted-alone therapy, or targeted-plus therapy. We used inverse probability of 
treatment weighting to adjust for extensive static and longitudinal 
patient-level confounding and compared rwOS using Kaplan-Meier curves and 
restricted mean survival time (RMST).
RESULTS: Among patients previously treated with 1L Targeted therapy, those 
receiving 2L Targeted-alone therapy had longer life expectancies than those 
receiving a nontargeted (ΔRMST-36 + 2.61 months) or Targeted-plus regimen 
(ΔRMST-36 + 3.11 months). For patients progressing on 1L Chemo + Immuno, 2L 
Chemo + Immuno outperformed Chemo-alone (ΔRMST-36 + 2.98 months). Among patients 
progressing ≥1 year after initiating 1L IO-alone, 2L Chemo + Immuno again showed 
better life expectancy than Chemo-alone (ΔRMST-36 + 5.70 months).
CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal real-world data can enhance assessment of 2L therapy 
effectiveness. After confounder adjustment, we found clinically meaningful 
survival differences by 2L choice. These findings underscore the importance of 
2L treatment selection and the need for prospective validation.

This retrospective cohort study examined 4991 patients with the American Joint 
Commission on Cancer T1-2 classification who underwent primary anti-cancer 
surgery, including lymph node evaluation (sentinel lymph node biopsy n = 976, 
and lymphadenectomy n = 4015), identified in the National Cancer Database from 
2018 to 2022. In propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting, 
the sentinel lymph node biopsy group had a 2-fold higher rate of low-volume 
metastasis (isolated tumor cells or micro-metastasis) than the lymphadenectomy 
group (2.7% vs 1.3%, OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.27). When the low-volume 
metastasis was further stratified, sentinel lymph node biopsy was associated 
with increased odds of isolated tumor cells (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.30 to 4.17) 
compared with micro-metastasis (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.57). This association 
was consistent in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program data 
from 2018 to 2022 (n = 2973), and sentinel lymph node biopsy was associated with 
increased odds of isolated tumor cells (OR 3.31, 95% CI 1.65 to 6.64) compared 
with micro-metastasis (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.16) compared with 
lymphadenectomy. In conclusion, these data suggest that sentinel lymph node 
mapping and biopsy with ultra-staging can identify more isolated tumor cells in 
cervical cancer.

OBJECTIVES: The study includes the interpretation of hormonal disturbances 
resulting from the activation of Beta estrogen receptors, which leads to 
increased oxidative stress and its relationship to the development1and spread of 
ovarian1cancer in perimenopause women compared to healthy women.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from (12) perimenopause women with ovarian 
cancer immediately after diagnosis to be compared with (45) healthy women. 
Estrogen receptor beta and some hormones were assessed using ELISA and 
miniVIDAS, while spectrophotometric methods were used to evaluate variables 
associated with oxidative stress.
RESULTS: The results show a significant increase in the values of estrogen 
receptors beta for women with ovarian cancer (48.4±3.18) ng/mL compared to 
healthy women (36.20±2.44) ng/mL. Also, a significant increase was remark in the 
values of each estrogen, progesterone, DHEA-s, testosterone, AMH, and total 
oxidant status. In contrast, a significant1decrease in the concentrations of 
total antioxidant capacity. The results also show a positive1correlation 
between1the values of total oxidants and the hormones studied, compared to the 
negative correlation with total antioxidants.
CONCLUSION: The significant increase in the values of beta-estrogen receptors as 
well as the estrogen hormone that may be derived from adipose tissue in women 
with ovarian cancer in the perimenopause stage has multiple effects, for 
example, causing disturbances in some hormones such as progesterone, DHEA-s, 
testosterone, and AMH. These hormonal disturbances resulting from granulosa cell 
tumors (GCTs) play a role in increasing the metabolic rate and thus increasing 
the oxidative stress of the cells.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Only a minority of renal oncocytic tumors are 
aggressive. These tumors' behavior is difficult to predict by histopathological 
evaluation; consequently, many patients experience anxiety upon diagnosis and 
may undergo unnecessary treatment. Our aim was to derive genomic and epigenomic 
signatures to distinguish clinically indolent renal oncocytic tumors from 
aggressive chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC).
METHODS: We performed molecular profiling of nephrectomies from 68 patients: 44 
with indolent renal oncocytic tumors (19 renal oncocytoma, two oncocytic renal 
neoplasm of low malignant potential, and 23 indolent ChRCC) and 24 with 
aggressive ChRCC. We performed targeted exome sequencing, gene expression 
profiling, and whole-genome methylation sequencing of formalin-fixed, 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. We also analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas 
Kidney Chromophobe data from 66 ChRCC patients in silico. Genomic and epigenomic 
signatures linked to aggressive ChRCC-obtained from sampling morphologically 
nonsarcomatoid foci-from both cohorts were derived using the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator method.
KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Aggressive ChRCC was distinguished from indolent 
ChRCC and other indolent renal oncocytic tumors using a focused seven- to 
11-gene expression signature (ten-fold cross-validation [CV] area under the 
curve [AUC] = 0.77-0.85) with an external validation AUC of 0.88, and an 
eight-CpG methylation signature (ten-fold CV AUC = 0.86) with an external 
validation AUC of 0.91. TP53 and PTEN mutations substantially increased the 
probability of aggressive ChRCC. Limitations include the small sample size.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Focused genomic and epigenomic signatures 
from routinely processed FFPE tumor tissues can help distinguish aggressive 
ChRCC from indolent renal oncocytic tumors, including indolent ChRCC. This forms 
the basis for replication studies to inform appropriate patient management, 
provide reassurance, and guide follow-up.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: PROpel (NCT03732820) demonstrated a statistically 
significant radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) benefit with olaparib 
plus abiraterone (Ola + Abi) versus placebo plus abiraterone (P + Abi) in 
first-line metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We conducted 
exploratory analyses in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and subgroups 
stratified by homologous recombination repair gene mutation (HRRm) and BRCA1 
and/or BRCA2 mutation (BRCAm) status.
METHODS: In PROpel, patients with mCRPC, without selection by HRRm status, were 
randomised 1:1 to first-line treatment with Ola (300 mg twice daily; n = 399) or 
P (n = 397), each with Abi (1000 mg daily) and prednisone/prednisolone (5 mg 
twice daily). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed rPFS. Exploratory 
endpoints were the objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), 
confirmed ≥50 decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA50-RR), and time to PSA 
progression; post hoc subgroup analyses by HRRm and BRCAm status were conducted.
KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: In the ITT population, the ORR was 58.4% with Ola 
+ Abi versus 48.1% with P + Abi. The confirmed PSA50-RR was 79.3% with Ola + Abi 
and 69.2% with P + Abi. Median time to PSA progression in the ITT population was 
24.2 mo with Ola + Abi and 12.0 mo with P + Abi (HR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.49-0.71). In 
the HRRm, no-HRRm, BRCAm, and no-BRCAm subgroups, results for ORR, DoR, 
confirmed PSA50-RR, and time to PSA progression favoured Ola + Abi, but these 
analyses were not powered for statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Results for ORR, DoR, confirmed PSA50-RR, 
and time to PSA progression favoured Ola + Abi over P + Abi in the ITT 
population and biomarker subgroups. The data support consideration of Ola + Abi 
as first-line treatment for mCRPC.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Prostate cancer is typically a disease of older men. 
As patients age, they develop comorbidities and require more medications, which 
may adversely affect or be affected by prostate cancer treatments. We 
investigated whether the survival benefits and favorable safety profile of 
darolutamide in the phase 3 ARASENS trial could be seen regardless of age.
METHODS: Patients received darolutamide 600 mg or placebo orally twice daily 
plus androgen-deprivation therapy and docetaxel. Outcomes were assessed in 
subgroups of patients aged <75 yr (n = 1086) and ≥75 yr (n = 219).
KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Most patients in both age groups had comorbidities 
(<75 yr: 94%; ≥75 yr: 97%) and concomitant medications (median 8-9). In both age 
subgroups, compared with placebo, darolutamide increased overall survival 
(<75 yr: hazard ratio 0.70 [95% confidence interval 0.58-0.84]; ≥75 yr: 0.61 
[0.41-0.91]), delayed time to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
(<75 yr: 0.35 [0.30-0.43]; ≥75 yr: 0.42 [0.28-0.64]), and delayed time to 
initiation of subsequent therapy (<75 yr: 0.40 [0.34-0.48]; ≥75 yr: 0.35 
[0.22-0.54]). Treatment-emergent adverse events were similar in the 
darolutamide/placebo groups, with slightly higher incidences in older patients. 
This analysis is limited by its post hoc nature.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In the 219 patients aged ≥75 yr in 
ARASENS, darolutamide demonstrated improved efficacy versus placebo and 
favorable safety, consistent with the findings in patients aged <75 yr. Thus, 
darolutamide and androgen-deprivation therapy with docetaxel can be considered a 
standard of care triplet therapy for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate 
cancer regardless of patients' age.

INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer screening (LCS) is an evolving field with variations 
in its implementation worldwide. National LCS programmes are limited and 
preliminary data from national implementation are scarce.
AIM: An up-to-date overview of the available literature about 12 LCS-related 
topics that were identified as priorities by a multidisciplinary task force (TF) 
panel and patient representatives as well as synthesis of published evidence to 
inform clinical practice and health decision-making about LCS implementation. In 
specific areas where the scientific evidence is limited or mixed, the 
limitations are discussed and best practices based on available evidence are 
concluded.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidisciplinary TF expert panel collaborated with 
patient representatives, identified 12 areas of interest and incorporated 
patient priorities. A systematic literature search was conducted, followed by 
screening, review and synthesis of available evidence.
RESULTS: There is a lack of national LCS programmes in most countries worldwide. 
LCS benefits and potential risks are well established. Low-dose computed 
tomography (LDCT) combined with smoking cessation should be offered as part of a 
LCS strategy to ensure optimal clinical outcomes. Age and smoking status 
cut-offs as well as other inclusion criteria vary and should be based on 
national epidemiological data. Available LCS risk predictor models and 
biomarkers require further clinical validation prior to implementation across 
the entire spectrum of LCS candidates. LCS frequency remains controversial with 
biennial LDCT being supported by current evidence. Technical standards, quality 
assurance and LCS management protocols are essential in LCS implementation.
CONCLUSIONS: LCS benefits override potential risks. There is slim evidence for 
specific cut-off values for inclusion criteria, the optimal duration of LCS 
programmes and the application of LCS biomarkers in clinical practice. Smoking 
cessation should be integrated within LCS programmes. Ongoing scientific 
activity in the area is expected to provide answers in the near future.

High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is a highly lethal gynecologic 
malignancy in women. Women diagnosed with HGSOC initially respond to 
chemotherapy, but there is a >80% rate of relapse. There is thus a significant 
unmet need for new therapeutic targets for HGSOC. Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is a 
particularly attractive candidate, as ∼70% of HGSOC tumors stain positively for 
ERα and there are approved inhibitors that show limited toxicity. However, 
unlike the case for breast cancer, endocrine therapy for HGSOC has not shown 
consistently promising results. In this work, we show that missense mutant forms 
of p53, which occur in >60% of HGSOC, bind and inhibit ERα function and confer 
resistance to fulvestrant and elacestrant. Mechanistically, we show that mutant 
p53 predominantly inhibits one arm of the ERα pathway-the transactivation of 
jointly regulated ERα-SP1 target genes such as the mTOR regulator DEPTOR We show 
that silencing mutant p53 restores the ability of ERα to transactivate ERα-SP1 
target genes and renders HGSOC markedly more sensitive to endocrine therapy. 
Consistent with this premise, we show that the p53 mutant Y220C refolding 
compound rezatapopt enhances fulvestrant response in a Y220C mutant cell line.

BACKGROUND: The Urgent Referral Cancer Patient Pathway for Non-Specific Symptoms 
and Signs of Cancer (NSSC-CPP) was introduced in Denmark in 2012 to reduce delay 
in cancer diagnosis. In the Zealand region, it includes direct referral from GPs 
to contrast-enhanced CT of thorax, abdomen, and pelvis (ceCT-TAP). In 2013, the 
NSSC-CPP cancer prevalence was 20%, but easy access to CT may change referral 
patterns.
AIM: To examine cancer prevalence, diagnostic accuracy of ceCT-TAP, and changes 
in NSSC-CPP referral patterns.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective cohort study from the Zealand region of 
Denmark.
METHOD: We included patients referred by GPs with non-specific symptoms or signs 
of cancer from 1 July to 31 December 2019. Primary endpoints were cancer 
prevalence and diagnostic accuracy of ceCT-TAP. Secondary endpoints were cancer 
types, referral trends from 2012-2019, and prevalence of GP-reported symptoms 
and clinical findings. Patients were followed until cancer diagnosis or up to 12 
months after ceCT, whichever came first.
RESULTS: 729 referrals were recorded, a fivefold increase compared to 140 in the 
same period in 2013. Malignancy was diagnosed in 95 patients (13%). Twelve 
patients had a false-negative ceCT-TAP result, yielding a negative likelihood 
ratio for malignancy of 0.15.
CONCLUSION: Despite a fivefold increase in GP referrals for ceCT-TAP since 2012, 
it remains an important diagnostic tool, identifying malignancy in one in seven 
patients. However, as the negative likelihood ratio was>0.10, a normal ceCT-TAP 
does not convincingly rule out cancer and should not stand alone as the only 
decision-support tool.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between the billing (profit) margin and 
clinical benefit of cancer treatments and use by oncologists.
DESIGN: Retrospective population based cohort study SETTING: Population based 
sample using fee-for-service Medicare claims data.
PARTICIPANTS: Medicare beneficiaries with an incident cancer diagnosis from 2015 
to 2020; included all patients with cancer treatment indications for which the 
available treatment options varied in clinical benefit and billing margin.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the cancer treatment each 
patient received among treatment options recommended by the National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). The characteristics of interest were 
provider billing margin (defined at the patient treatment level, using Medicare 
reimbursement rates corresponding to the patient's diagnosis date) and a proxy 
measure of clinical benefit (rank order of treatments based on Evidence Blocks 
scores developed by the NCCN, corresponding to the patient's diagnosis date). 
The association between treatment received, billing margin, and clinical benefit 
was modeled using a conditional logit model with inverse 
probability-of-treatment weights applied at the patient treatment level to 
control for patient and provider characteristics.
RESULTS: Twelve cancer indications were examined comprising 19 397 individual 
patients. Provider billing margin ranged from $0 to $12 692 (£9440; €10 800) for 
each course of treatment. No association was found between a $100 increase in 
provider billing margin and the likelihood of treatment use (odds ratio 0.97, 
95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.03). Higher clinical benefit was associated 
with greater treatment use (1.62, 1.15 to 2.29).
CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study of Medicare beneficiaries, selection of 
cancer treatments was associated with the treatment's clinical benefit but not 
billing margin. Therefore, it is unlikely that policy and price changes that 
affect the billing margin of cancer treatments would shift patterns of use.

INTRODUCTION: Despite increasing palliative care capabilities in the USA, 
utilisation rates remain low for patients with advanced cancer, particularly 
among African American patients. To address this gap, a theory-driven, 
stakeholder-informed community health worker (CHW) palliative care intervention 
for African American patients with advanced cancer and their informal caregivers 
is currently being assessed through a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation 
trial at four cancer centres across the USA. To improve the quality and 
efficiency of palliative care delivery, inform resource allocation and guide 
broad-scale implementation, it is essential to generate evidence on the economic 
value of palliative care programmes. The objectives of this study are to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness and estimate the social value of a CHW 
palliative care intervention for African American patients with advanced cancer 
and their caregivers.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) and a 
social return-on-investment (SROI) analysis to assess the value of the CHW 
palliative care intervention compared with enhanced standard of care. Standard, 
extended and distributional CEAs will be performed from the perspectives of an 
adopting organisation or payer (eg, Medicaid), the US healthcare sector and 
society. An SROI analysis will also be conducted to assess the social value of 
the intervention. These analyses will focus on estimating the costs, health and 
distributional impacts of the intervention.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study protocol was approved by the Johns Hopkins 
Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB00372476). All methods will be carried 
out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Written informed 
consent will be obtained from all subjects prior to study participation. This 
manuscript does not contain participant-level data. The full protocol will be 
available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. The dissemination 
of findings from the clinical trial and accompanying economic evaluation 
outlined in this manuscript will be multifaceted to maximise reach and impact. 
Research findings will be presented at relevant scientific conferences, 
submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and shared with community 
stakeholders, including hospital leaders and administrators, providers, CHWs and 
patient advocacy groups.

BACKGROUND: Population screening can identify genomic risk for medically 
actionable conditions with onset across the lifespan. In pediatric patients, 
questions persist regarding the positive healthcare impact of screening for 
pediatric-onset results and the potential harms of returning adult-onset 
findings.
PURPOSE: The Pediatric Reporting of Genomic Results Study (PRoGRESS) included an 
observational cohort study of healthcare behaviors following genomic risk 
identification in pediatric participants, including completion of recommended 
management in individuals with pediatric-onset results and inappropriate care in 
participants with adult-onset findings.
METHODS: Study participants were recruited via the Geisinger MyCode biobank. 
Pediatric MyCode participants and at-risk pediatric relatives of adult MyCode 
participants with actionable genomic findings identified on their research exome 
were invited to participate in the study before receiving genomic results. 
Electronic health records of participants with pathogenic/likely pathogenic 
(P/LP) variants were reviewed for completion of and adherence to recommended 
care at least 6-month post-results disclosure.
RESULTS: Sixty-five participants (age 0.2-18 years) were identified with a P/LP 
variant in a medically actionable study gene. Thirty-one participants (48%) 
received a pediatric-onset result; 34 (52%) received an adult-onset result. 
Thirteen of the 27 participants with pediatric-onset results eligible for 
management (48%) were adherent to all care; an additional 6 (22%) completed some 
care. No participants with adult-onset results completed inappropriate care.
CONCLUSIONS: Most participants who received pediatric-onset results completed 
some management recommendations, though significant care gaps persisted, 
highlighting an opportunity to facilitate downstream care. Participants who 
received adult-onset results did not complete nonrecommended care, suggesting 
this theoretical harm is not being realized.
CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT03832985.

Plain Language Summary: Population screening for genetic variants that increase 
risk for disease can identify individuals with risk and prompt relevant 
downstream care to catch diseases early and improve outcomes. Although studies 
have examined population screening in adults, questions remain regarding the 
benefits and harms of identifying genetic risk in children. This study examined 
downstream care in children identified with genomic risk. We were interested in 
whether children with a pediatric-onset result, for which recommended care 
begins in childhood, had received recommended care. We also wanted to know 
whether children with an adult-onset result, for which care is not recommended 
until adulthood, had received care that would not yet be recommended. We 
reviewed the completion of recommended care in patients with pediatric-onset 
results and any inappropriate care in those with adult-onset results. Sixty-five 
pediatric participants were included in the study. Their medical records were 
reviewed for care leading up to and for at least 6 months following 
identification and return of the genetic result. Results demonstrated that 
pediatric-onset results prompted relevant care, but opportunities remain to 
ensure that all appropriate care is completed. Adult-onset results did not 
result in inappropriate care.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive liver cancer with 
poor prognosis. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are critical regulators of tumor 
progression, yet the functional significance of DUBs in HCC remains poorly 
understood.
METHODS: HCC patient-derived organoids (PDOs), HCC cell lines and animal models 
were used to evaluate the anticancer responses of ubiquitin-specific protease 
(USP)2 inhibition. We analyzed the correlation of USP2 expression and immune 
cells infiltration using single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry analysis. 
Mechanistically, we established an in vitro co-culture system and analyzed 
metabolic data to find out the bridge between tumor cell USP2 and macrophage in 
the microenvironment. Immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation, CUT&RUN, 
ELISA, and mass spectrometry were conducted to explore the molecular pathway.
RESULTS: We found that the inhibitor (ML364) targeting USP2 shows effective 
anticancer responses against HCC PDOs. Targeting USP2 significantly inhibits 
lipid metabolism of HCC and induces cell ferroptosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing 
analysis and multiplex immunohistochemistry analysis indicated that high 
expression of USP2 in HCC was associated with the infiltration of M2 macrophage. 
Mechanistically, USP2 deubiquitinates and stabilizes peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) via removing the K48-linked 
ubiquitin chain at the K142 site. PPARγ promotes the transcription of fatty acid 
biosynthesis-related genes (ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and ACSS2) 
and de novo synthesis of fatty acids including oleic acid. HCC cell-derived 
oleic acid promotes M2 macrophage polarization by enhancing the fatty acid 
oxidation of macrophages. Polarized M2 macrophages further secrete 
interleukin-10, which created an IL-10/STAT3/USP2 positive-feedback loop to 
activate USP2 expression continuously.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that USP2, a key molecule mediating the interaction 
between HCC cells and tumor-associated macrophages, may be a promising 
therapeutic target for HCC.

The proper functioning of the immune system requires an adequate balance between 
myeloid and lymphoid populations. Tumor growth alters this balance, also through 
the dramatic expansion of immunosuppressive myeloid populations, which block 
specific immunity, fueling tumor growth and dissemination and limiting the 
effectiveness of antitumor therapies, including immunotherapy. Tumors alter the 
expansion and functions of myeloid cells by acting locally in the tumor 
microenvironment, as well as on myeloid progenitors, through the manipulation of 
metabolic traits that govern their functions. The understanding of these 
metabolic alterations and their clinical translation is expected to offer new 
valid therapeutic options.

BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive form of cancer of the 
central nervous system. Despite advances in immunotherapies and standard-of-care 
treatments for GBMs, clinical outcomes remain limited-owing to the 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and the intrinsic resistance of GBM to 
conventional approaches. As a result, there is growing interest in rational 
combination strategies, particularly those pairing oncolytic viruses with 
immune-based therapies or established treatment modalities. Oncolytic viruses, 
by displaying conditionally enabled tumor cell-restricted replication, while 
stimulating antitumor immune responses and leaving healthy tissue unharmed, have 
the potential to reshape the therapeutic landscape in GBM and aid in achieving 
more durable benefits for patients. This study investigates the use of 
infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) as a potential virotherapy for GBM.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In vitro, IBDV infects and replicates within murine GBM 
cells and patient-derived GBM stem cells, inducing direct oncolysis and 
activating proinflammatory gene expression programs. IBDV also enhances the 
cytolytic activity of temozolomide (TMZ) in treated GBM cells, complementing TMZ 
chemotherapeutic activity. In vivo, treatment with IBDV in CT-2A GBM-bearing 
syngeneic mice significantly reduced tumor growth and improved survival compared 
with control mice. Intratumoral administration of IBDV induces a deep remodeling 
of the tumor immune microenvironment, reducing immunosuppressive M2-like 
macrophages and increasing the ratio of CD8+T cells to regulatory T cells. This 
reversion of immunosuppression linked to monocyte-derived macrophages has been 
confirmed on experimental ex vivo infections of explants derived from human GBM 
donors.
CONCLUSION: These findings support further consideration of IBDV as a novel 
virotherapeutic agent for GBM.

AIM: Transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) is the standard approach 
for diagnosing and staging non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Accurate staging 
depends on the presence of muscularis propria (MP) in resected tumour specimens, 
and inadequate MP sampling may necessitate repeat procedures. Non-linear 
microscopy (NLM), a laser-scanning, non-destructive imaging technique, enables 
real-time evaluation of fresh tissue and has the potential to improve staging 
accuracy intraoperatively.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively reviewed 94 TURBT pathology reports with 
high-grade urothelial carcinoma to assess MP sampling rates by tumour stage. MP 
was present in 55% (52/94) of cases, with variability across stages: 55% (23/42) 
in high-grade pTa, 39% (9/23) in pTis, 55% (11/20) in pT1 and 100% (9/9) in pT2. 
NLM was used to evaluate six fresh and 25 archived formalin-fixed, 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) TURBT specimens. Fresh tissues were stained and imaged 
in real time, while thick sections from FFPE specimens were deparaffinised, 
imaged using NLM and converted to a digital format analogous to whole-slide 
images. NLM provided high-resolution imaging of MP as distinct, thick smooth 
muscle bundles in fresh specimens. Furthermore, NLM images of deparaffinised 
sections closely resembled conventional H&E histology, and a blinded reader 
achieved a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 100% for MP detection.
CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study supports the feasibility of NLM for 
intraoperative MP assessment during TURBT. By providing rapid, high-resolution 
and non-destructive tissue evaluation, NLM has the potential to improve staging 
accuracy, optimise intraoperative surgical decision-making and reduce the need 
for repeat TURBT.

BACKGROUND: In the DREAMM-8 trial, belantamab mafodotin, pomalidomide, and 
dexamethasone demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the risk of 
progression or death compared with bortezomib, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone 
in lenalidomide-exposed patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. 
We present patient-reported outcomes from this trial.
METHODS: This phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial was done in 95 
sites in 18 countries. Eligible patients were adults aged 18 years or older with 
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma per International Myeloma Working Group 
criteria, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and 
previous treatment with at least one line of therapy that included lenalidomide. 
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a central interactive response 
technology system to receive 28-day cycles of intravenous belantamab mafodotin 
(2·5 mg/kg on day 1 of cycle 1 and 1·9 mg/kg on day 1 of cycle 2 onward) 
combined with oral pomalidomide (4 mg on days 1 to 21) and oral dexamethasone 
(40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; belantamab mafodotin group) or 21-day cycles of 
subcutaneous bortezomib (1·3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of cycles 1-8 and 
days 1 and 8 of cycle 9 onward) combined with pomalidomide and dexamethasone at 
the same doses and schedules as the belantamab mafodotin group; bortezomib 
group). Treatment continued until the occurrence of progressive disease, 
unacceptable adverse effects, withdrawal of consent, or death (whichever 
occurred first). Secondary patient-reported outcome endpoints were change from 
baseline in health-related quality of life (HRQOL), measured by the European 
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30, EORTC 
QLQ-MY20, and Patient-Reported Outcomes Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (PRO-CTCAE). Ocular Surface Disease Index and Functional Assessment of 
Chronic Illness Therapy-Item GP5 results were assessed similarly as exploratory 
endpoints. EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-MY20 disease symptom domain results were 
analysed in the intent-to-treat population, and PRO-CTCAE results were analysed 
in the safety population (patients who received at least one dose of study 
treatment). For all patient-reported outcome assessments, proportions included 
the number and percentage of patients with available data, and changes from 
baseline were summarised as means with 95% CIs at each timepoint. This trial was 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04484623, and is ongoing.
FINDINGS: Between Oct 12, 2020, and Dec 26, 2022, 382 patients were assessed for 
eligibility. 80 patients were excluded and 302 patients were enrolled and 
randomly assigned to either the belantamab mafodotin group (n=155) or bortezomib 
group (n=147). The median age in the whole population was 66·1 years (SD 9·31). 
181 (60%) of 302 patients were male and 260 (86%) were White. At the primary 
analysis data cutoff (Jan 29, 2024), median follow-up was 21·8 months (IQR 
13·2-27·6). For all patient-reported outcome assessments during treatment, 
compliance was at least 90% for most visits within the first year. Change from 
baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-MY20 domain scores remained stable in both 
treatment groups over time, with a consistently greater proportion of patients 
in the belantamab mafodotin group than in the bortezomib group experiencing 
meaningful improvement (≥10 points) at most visits. Side-effects were minimally 
bothersome in both groups within the first year of treatment. Blurred vision was 
the adverse event most commonly reported as severe or very severe (63 [43%] of 
146 patients in the belantamab mafodotin group and 13 [9%] of 139 patients in 
the bortezomib group), followed by fatigue (56 [38%] of patients in the 
belantamab mafodotin group and 49 [35%] of patients in the bortezomib group). No 
clear differences between groups were observed for other symptomatic adverse 
events.
INTERPRETATION: Patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma treated 
with belantamab mafodotin, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone or bortezomib, 
pomalidomide, and dexamethasone reported stable HRQOL. Self-reported ocular 
adverse events were generally manageable and minimally bothersome within the 
first year of treatment. These findings indicate that belantamab mafodotin, 
pomalidomide, and dexamethasone is well tolerated, with little detriment to 
HRQOL, supporting its use in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, with 905,677 new cases 
in 2020, and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of primary liver cancer 
and accounts for approximately 75% to 85% of cases. Ultimately, the management 
of HCC encompasses multiple disciplines including hepatologists, diagnostic 
radiologists, pathologists, transplant surgeons, surgical oncologists, radiation 
oncologists, and more. The development of a multidisciplinary clinic with 
dedicated tumor board review has been shown to increase survival in these 
patients with HCC. This document aims to guide the imaging of HCC, including 
screening, staging, active surveillance during liver-directed therapy, and in 
the setting of previously treated HCC. The American College of Radiology 
Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical 
conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The 
guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of 
the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology 
principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and 
Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA 
Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the 
appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical 
scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or 
equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate 
a recommendation.

Ovarian cancer remains the sixth most common cause of cancer mortality in women 
in the United States and is a leading cause of mortality among patients with 
gynecologic malignancies. Imaging plays an important role in pretreatment 
staging of epithelial ovarian cancers, the evaluation of posttreatment response, 
and follow-up. Accurate pretreatment imaging is integral to determine 
appropriate first-line therapy. By delineating the extent of disease, imaging 
can assist decision making regarding the likelihood of optimal primary 
cytoreduction or need for neoadjuvant chemotherapy when optimal cytoreduction is 
not felt to be achievable. Contrast-enhanced CT serves as a mainstay modality 
for the pretreatment assessment of ovarian cancer, with MRI, PET/CT, and, in 
some instances, PET/MRI used in the pretreatment setting. CT and PET/CT are also 
integral to assessing response, including in the suspected recurrence setting, 
with MRI and PET/MRI being used in select cases. The American College of 
Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific 
clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert 
panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic 
analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established 
methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment,

In rectal cancer, because of the need for high-resolution anatomic detail in 
determining local tumor extension, imaging for local staging and restaging of 
the primary tumor in the pelvis is considered separately from the evaluation of 
distant metastatic disease in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, often resulting in 
the need for a combination of modalities to fully stage the patient. The 
American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based 
guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a 
multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process

The role of imaging in initial staging of colon cancer, and in posttreatment 
restaging or surveillance, is most beneficial in identifying distant metastases 
in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, regardless of primary T or N stage. 
Appendiceal cancers are classified separately and managed differently than colon 
cancer; however, initial staging and postoperative surveillance is also 
primarily focused on detection of distant metastatic disease, usually in the 
abdomen and pelvis. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a highly lethal cancer that often presents 
with vague and indolent symptoms leading to advanced stage diagnosis. Imaging 
plays a crucial role in the diagnosis, assessment of locoregional and metastatic 
disease, surgical planning, and surveillance after neoadjuvant therapy and 
surgery. This document reviews available imaging modalities that are best used 
for these clinical scenarios, and a summary of current evidence is provided to 
support the use of the various modalities in each of the clinical contexts. The

Breast cancer screening recommendations have been established historically for 
women, but, have been less clearly outlined for men. For average-risk men and 
younger men less than 25 year of age, imaging is not usually appropriate as a 
screening test for breast cancer. For men of higher-than-average risk, screening 
with mammography as annual surveillance imaging is usually appropriate. The 
American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based 
guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a 
multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process

Routine screening substantially reduces the risk of mortality and morbidity of 
breast cancer with early detection. Multiple different imaging modalities may be 
used to screen for breast cancer. Screening recommendations differ based on an 
individual's risk of developing breast cancer. Numerous factors contribute to 
breast cancer risk, which is frequently divided into three major categories: 
average, intermediate, and high risk. For patients assigned female at birth with 
native breast tissue, mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis are 
recommended for breast cancer screening in all risk categories. In high-risk 
patients, screening with breast MRI is recommended starting as early as 25 to 30 
years of age and mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis with a variable 
starting age between 25 and 40 years of age, depending on the type of risk. The

There are physiologic and structural changes of the breast that occur during 
pregnancy that can make the clinical examination and imaging more challenging. 
Pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) is uncommon but increasing as more 
women postpone childbearing. PABC can present clinically as a palpable lump, 
focal pain, nipple discharge, or diffuse breast enlargement. Mammography is safe 
to perform during pregnancy. Both high- and normal-risk women should continue 
their routine screening mammography examinations during pregnancy. Diagnostic 
mammography and/or ultrasound is tailored to evaluate the clinical symptoms and 
for locoregional staging of newly diagnosed PABC. Breast MRI is not advocated 
for screening or diagnostic evaluation of the breast during pregnancy due to 
unknown safety of gadolinium exposure to the fetus. The American College of 
Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific 
clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert

BACKGROUND: Previous studies on the association between n-3 (ω-3) 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and risk of venous thromboembolism 
(VTE), mainly derived from self-reported dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs, have shown 
mixed results.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this cohort study was to investigate the association 
between measured serum n-3 PUFA concentrations and risk of first-ever VTE.
METHODS: The present cohort (N = 17,087) was derived from the third survey of 
the Trøndelag Health Study and consisted of individuals aged ≥20 y without 
previous VTE. Serum n-3 PUFA concentrations were measured in blood drawn at 
inclusion (2006-2008) using a nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomic platform 
(Nightingale), and participants were followed until an objectively verified 
first-ever VTE event, death, migration, or 31 December, 2019. Cox regression was 
used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 12 y, 340 experienced an incident VTE 
event. Participants with n-3 PUFA concentrations in the highest tertile had 28% 
lower relative risk of VTE (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.96) than those with n-3 
PUFAs in the lowest tertile in age-adjusted analysis. The inverse association 
was most pronounced for provoked VTE (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.87) and deep 
vein thrombosis (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.93). HRs remained virtually 
unaffected after further adjustment for sex, body mass index, and history of 
cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of an inverse association between serum n-3 PUFA 
concentrations and VTE suggest that a diet enriched with n-3 PUFAs might protect 
against future VTE.

INTRODUCTION: The emergency department (ED) serves as an entry point to the 
healthcare system for many patients, and the increased use of advanced imaging 
has resulted in identification of masses of unclear significance. We describe 
patients presenting to an ED who were referred to an undiagnosed mass clinic 
(UMC).
METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational cohort study of patients ≥16 
years of age presenting to Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, from October 
31, 2018-March 31, 2023, who were referred to the UMC.
RESULTS: There were 116 patients referred to the UMC with a median of 3.5 days 
from ED encounter to clinic date and a median of 14.5 days from ED encounter to 
biopsy. Using an analytic tool in the electronic health record, we estimated 
that of 16,872 patients, 116 (0.69%) Mayo Clinic Florida (MCF) ED patients ≥18 
years of age who received computed tomography and were discharged from the ED 
were referred to the UMC. Ultimately, 35 of 65 patients (53.8%) seen in the UMC 
received a cancer diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows a viable care path from ED encounter to undiagnosed 
mass clinic. Further research is needed to ensure timely transitions of care for 
patients who are uninsured or out of network.

INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is a malignant tumor that originates in breast 
tissue and the most common cause of malignant tumors-related death in women 
worldwide. Long noncoding RNA (LncRNA) is a transcribed RNA with more than 200 
nucleotides in length but has no notable potential for protein coding. Hypoxia 
is a common occurrence in tumor microenvironments due to an imbalance in oxygen 
supply and consumption by rapidly growing tumors. The aim of study is to analyze 
the gene expression of different types of lncRNAs (lnc.4.2, lnc.4.3) as a 
molecular tumor marker in relation with hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1α) 
gene and main clinic pathological characters for patients and healthy control 
group.
METHODS: The study included 100 newly diagnosed cases of bc divided into four 
groups: (n = 25) low grade before treatment (LBT), (n = 25) low grade after 
treatment (LAT), (n = 25) high grade before treatment (HBT), and (n = 25) high 
grade after treatment (HAT). In addition, (n = 25) as a control group.
RESULTS: The results of this study showed that lncRNA 4.2 and lncRNA 4.3 
exhibited strong discriminatory ability specifically in the LBT versus control 
and HAT versus control comparisons, with AUC values exceeding 0.70. This 
indicates that these lncRNAs may be particularly useful for distinguishing LBT 
and HAT samples indicate potential role in treatment response or the 
pretreatment state. HIF1A also exhibited moderate diagnostic potential in the 
HBT versus control and HAT versus control comparisons, with AUC values greater 
than 0.60. Its performance was notably better in the HBT group, where it 
achieved an AUC of 0.774, indicating good discriminatory ability in this 
specific context. This suggests that HIF1A may be a useful diagnostic marker for 
conditions associated with HBT samples, potentially reflecting its role in 
cellular stress response.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN) and 
chemotherapy delays (CD) due to neutropenia in chemotherapy cycles in which 
pegfilgrastim (PGF) was administered on the same day (D0) vs the following day 
(D+1), as treatment for solid tumours.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the number of 
chemotherapy cycles with PGF administration as the unit of analysis. PGF 
administration on D0 was compared with administration on D+1. The incidence of 
FN and CD was calculated for the entire cohort and for subgroups. Relative risk 
(RR) between groups was assessed, a p value <0.05 considered statistically 
significant.
RESULTS: A total of 1091 cycles with PGF administration on D0 were compared with 
1089 cycles on D+1. The incidence of FN was 1.6% in D0 and 0.5% in D+1 (RR=3.4; 
p=0.02), and CD was 2.2% and 2.6% in D0 and D+1, respectively (RR=0.9; p=0.67). 
The incidence of FN on breast cancer (BC) patients was 2.4% in D0 and 0.3% in 
D+1 (RR=7.0; p<0.01). No significant differences were identified in the 
incidence of FN among other tumours (OT) (RR=1.0; p=0.68).
CONCLUSION: Higher rates of FN were observed in the overall cohort when PGF was 
administered on D0, largely influenced by the subgroup of BC patients. Among OT, 
the day of PGF administration did not impact the outcome. These findings support 
the administration of PGF on D+1 of chemotherapy in BC patients when FN 
prevention is the objective. For patients with OT, administration of PGF on D0 
is considered appropriate.
