    "To develop an Information Retrieval system — specifically, a **binary text classifier** — to identify scientific articles in the PubMed database that are related to a given set of abstracts within a defined research topic. In this case, the focus is on a collection of 1,308 manuscripts containing information on the polyphenol composition of various foods."
