In this study the impact of achenes on polyphenolic compounds, ascorbic acids, 
and antioxidant activities in strawberry purees at production and after storage 
at 6 and 22 degrees C for 8 and 16 weeks was investigated. Strawberry purees 
were made from flesh, berry, and achene-enriched homogenate and contained 0, 
1.2, and 2.9% achenes, respectively. At production, strawberry purees made from 
flesh contained more anthocyanins, p-coumaroyl glycosides, and ascorbic acids, 
whereas increasing achene levels caused increasing levels of ellagic acid 
derivatives, proanthocyanidins, flavonols, total phenolics (TP), and antioxidant 
activities. In addition, the anthocyanins, TP, and ferric reducing ability power 
(FRAP) in purees with more achenes were better retained during storage. Ascorbic 
acids and anthocyanins declined rapidly during storage, whereas other 
polyphenols and antioxidant activities were more stable; that is, the 
contributions from anthocyanins and ascorbic acids to TP and antioxidant 
activities decreased. The findings that achenes contributed significantly to 
polyphenol content and stability of strawberry purees may be interesting in a 
nutritional and, thus, commercial, perspective.

Wheat grain is recognized as a good source of potentially health-enhancing 
components such as dietary fiber, phenolics, tocopherols, and carotenoids. 
Anthocyanins, another group of bioactive compounds, are found in blue and purple 
wheat grains. In the present study, a blue aleurone spring wheat line ""Purendo 
38"" with relatively high content of total anthocyanins was used to investigate 
the composition and stability of anthocyanins over three crop years. Commercial 
cultivars of purple (Konini) and red (Katepwa) wheats were included in the 
study. Separation of anthocyanins by high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) showed that each wheat had a distinct anthocyanin profile. Four major 
anthocyanins were separated from blue wheat extracts as compared to five 
anthocyanins in purple wheat. Cyanidin 3-glucoside was the predominant 
anthocyanin in purple wheat, whereas it was the second major anthocyanin in blue 
wheat. The predominant anthocyanin in blue wheat, making up approximately 41% of 
the total anthocyanin content, remains to be structurally unidentified. Blue 
wheat anthocyanins were thermally most stable at pH 1. Their degradation was 
slightly lower at pH 3 as compared to pH 5. Increasing the temperature from 65 
to 95 degrees C increased degradation of blue wheat anthocyanins. Addition of 
SO(2) during heating of blue wheat had a stabilizing effect on anthocyanin 
pigments. The optimal SO(2) concentrations were 500-1000 ppm for whole meals and 
1000-3000 ppm for isolated anthocyanins. Further studies are underway to 
identify and verify individual anthocyanins in blue wheat and their potential 
end uses.

Monomeric and oligomeric procyanidins present in cocoa liquors and chocolates 
were separated and quantified in four different laboratories using a 
normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with 
fluorescence detection. Procyanidin standards through decamers were obtained by 
extraction from cocoa beans, enrichment by Sephadex LH-20 gel permeation 
chromatography, and final purification by preparative normal-phase HPLC. The 
purity of each oligomeric fraction was assessed using HPLC coupled to mass 
spectrometry. A composite standard was then prepared, and calibration curves 
were generated for each oligomeric class using a quadratic fit of area sum 
versus concentration. Results obtained by each of the laboratories were in close 
agreement, which suggests this method is reliable and reproducible for 
quantification of procyanidins. Furthermore, the procyanidin content of the 
samples was correlated to the antioxidant capacity measured using the ORAC assay 
as an indicator for potential biological activity.

Epidemiologic studies revealed low mortality in hormone-dependent cancer in 
Japanese women and men consuming a traditional diet. We previously found that 
certain diphenolic food components, lignans and isoflavonoids, which are 
converted to biologically active hormone-like substances by intestinal 
microflora, may be cancer-protective agents. Therefore, we studied urinary 
excretion of these compounds (enterolactone, enterodiol, daidzein, equol, and 
O-desmethylangolensin) in 10 women and 9 men in a rural village south of Kyoto, 
Japan. The subjects consumed a typical low-fat diet with much rice and soy 
products, fish, and vegetables. An isotope-dilution gas chromatographic-mass 
spectrometric method was used for the assays. The urinary excretion of lignans 
was low but that of the isoflavonoids was very high. The excretion of 
isoflavonoids correlated with soybean-product intake. The low mortality in 
breast and prostate cancer of Japanese women and men, respectively, may be due 
to the high intake of soybean products.

The health-promoting effects of whole-grain consumption have been attributed in 
part to their unique phytochemical contents and profiles that complement those 
found in fruits and vegetables. Wheat is an important component of the human 
diet; however, little is known about the phytochemical profiles and total 
antioxidant activities of milled fractions of different wheat varieties. The 
objectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of phytochemicals 
(total phenolics, flavonoids, ferulic acid, and carotenoids) and to determine 
hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity in milled fractions (endosperm 
and bran/germ) of three different wheat varieties, two of which were grown in 
two environments. Grain samples of each of the wheat varieties were milled into 
endosperm and bran/germ fractions. Each fraction was extracted and analyzed for 
total phenolics, ferulic acid, flavonoids, carotenoid contents, and hydrophilic 
and lipophilic antioxidant activities. Total phenolic content of bran/germ 
fractions (2867-3120 micromol of gallic acid equiv/100 g) was 15-18-fold higher 
(p < 0.01) than that of respective endosperm fractions. Ferulic acid content 
ranged from 1005 to 1130 micromol/100 g in bran/germ fractions and from 15 to 21 
micromol/100 g in the endosperm fractions. The bran/germ fraction flavonoid 
content was 740-940 micromol of catechin equiv/100 g. On average, bran/germ 
fractions of wheat had 4-fold more lutein, 12-fold more zeaxanthin, and 2-fold 
more beta-cryptoxanthin than the endosperm fractions. Hydrophilic antioxidant 
activity of bran/germ samples (7.1-16.4 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g) was 
13-27-fold higher than that of the respective endosperm samples. Similarly, 
lipophilic antioxidant activity was 28-89-fold higher in the bran/germ fractions 
(1785-4669 nmol of vitamin E equiv/g). Hydrophilic antioxidant activity 
contribution to the total antioxidant activity (hydrophilic + lipophilic) was 
>80%. In whole-wheat flour, the bran/germ fraction contributed 83% of the total 
phenolic content, 79% of the total flavonoid content, 51% of the total lutein, 
78% of the total zeaxanthin, 42% of the total beta-cryptoxanthin, 85% of the 
total hydrophilic antioxidant activity, and 94% of the total lipophilic 
antioxidant activity. Our results showed that different milled fractions of 
wheat have different profiles of both hydrophilic and lipophilic phytochemicals. 
These findings provide information necessary for evaluating contributions to 
good health and disease prevention from whole-wheat consumption.

This study presents the effects of soaking, cooking, and industrial dehydration 
treatments on phenolic profile and also on antioxidant properties in Pardina 
lentil. HPLC-PAC and HPLC-MS (ESI) analysis identified a total of 35 phenolic 
compounds in raw and processed lentil flours, corresponding to catechins and 
procyanidins (69% of the total of identified phenolic compounds), flavonols 
(17%), flavones, and flavanones (5%), and hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic 
compounds (5 and 4%, respectively). During the industrial process, catechins and 
procyanidins, flavonols, flavones, and flavanones decreased, while 
hydroxybenzoic compounds exhibited an important increase. In addition, raw 
lentils showed high values of the antioxidant activity (66.97 μmol Trolox/g); 
although the thermal processing promotes decreased, the levels of antioxidant 
activity were still relevant. Thus, the significant occurrence of bioactive 
phenolic compounds along with the interesting antioxidant capacity of dehydrated 
lentil flours make them useful for daily inclusion in the human diet as 
ready-to-use for special meals to specific populations.

Fresh and sun-dried dates of three native varieties from Oman, namely, Fard, 
Khasab, and Khalas, were examined for their antioxidant activity and total 
contents of anthocyanins, carotenoids, and phenolics, as well as free and bound 
phenolic acids. All results are expressed as mean value +/- standard deviation 
(n = 3) on a fresh weight basis. Fresh date varieties were found to be a good 
source of antioxidants (11687-20604 micromol of Trolox equiv/g), total contents 
of anthocyanins (0.24-1.52 mg of cyanidin 3-glucoside equiv/100 g), carotenoids 
(1.31-3.03 mg/100 g), phenolics (134-280 mg of ferulic acid equiv/100 g), free 
phenolic acids (2.61-12.27 mg/100 g), and bound phenolic acids (6.84-30.25 
mg/100 g). A significant (p < 0.05) amount of antioxidants and carotenoids was 
lost after sun-drying of dates, whereas the total content of phenolics and free 
and bound phenolic acids increased significantly (p < 0.05). Anthocyanins were 
detected only in fresh dates. Date varieties had different levels and patterns 
of phenolic acids. Four free phenolic acids (protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, 
syringic acid, and ferulic acid) and nine bound phenolic acids (gallic acid, 
protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, 
syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and o-coumaric acid) were 
tentatively identified. Of the date varieties studied, Khalas, which is 
considered to be premium quality, had higher antioxidant activity, total 
carotenoids, and bound phenolic acids than other varieties. These results 
suggest that all date varieties serve as a good source of natural antioxidants 
and could potentially be considered as a functional food or functional food 
ingredient, although some of their antioxidant constituents are lost during 
sun-drying.

Four different colored carrots, orange, purple with orange core, yellow, and 
white, were examined for their content of phenolics, antioxidant vitamins, and 
sugars as well as their volatiles and sensory responses. A total of 35 volatiles 
were identified in all carrots, 27 positively. White carrot contained the 
highest content of volatiles, followed by orange, purple, and yellow. In total, 
11, 16, 10, and 9 phenolic compounds were determined for the first time in 
orange, purple, yellow, and white carrots, respectively. Of these, chlorogenic 
acid was the most predominant phenolic compound in all carrot varieties. 
Differences (p < 0.05) in relative sweetness, the contents of vitamin C and 
alpha- and beta-carotenes, and certain flavor characteristics were observed 
among the colored carrot varieties examined. Purple carrots contained 2.2 and 
2.3 times more alpha- and beta-carotenes (trace in yellow; not detected in 
white) than orange carrots, respectively. Purple carrot may be used in place of 
other carrot varieties to take advantage of its nutraceutical components.

The effect of roasting on taste-active components of 18 native hazelnut 
varieties, grown in the Giresun province of Turkey, was assessed. Samples were 
examined for their sugars, organic acids, condensed tannins, and free phenolic 
acids. Six sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose, myo-inositol, raffinose, and 
stachyose), seven organic acids (oxalic, maleic, citric, malic, lactic, 
succinic, and acetic), and one phenolic acid (gallic acid) were positively 
identified in natural and roasted hazelnut varieties; among these, sucrose, 
malic acid, and gallic acid predominated, respectively. Total sugars among 
hazelnut varieties ranged from 1.99 to 4.94 g/100 g, organic acids from 0.96 to 
2.72 g/100 g, condensed tannins from 3.99 to 40.56 mg of catechin equivalents/g, 
and gallic acid from 0.159 to 0.871 mg/100 g. Differences existed in the sugar 
and organic acid contents between natural and roasted hazelnut varieties, but 
they did not follow any particular trend. Significant losses (p < 0.05) in 
condensed tannins ( approximately 97.3%) and gallic acid ( approximately 66.7%) 
were noted when the hazelnuts were roasted. The present work suggests that 
roasting resulted in significant loss in condensed tannins and gallic acid due 
to the removal of the brown skin. The effect of roasting on sugars and organic 
acids was not noteworthy.

An analytical method based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) and followed by 
liquid chromatographic separation and ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) is 
proposed for the determination of 10 phenolic compounds which participate on 
beer stability and sensory properties in alcohol-free beers. Acetonitrile was 
found to be the most appropriate solvent for the elution of polyphenolic 
compounds adsorbed on C18 cartridges. The performance of the method was assessed 
by the evaluation of parameters such as absolute recovery (generally higher than 
60%), repeatability (lower than 10%), linearity (r2 higher than 0.993) and 
limits of quantitation (ranging from 1 to 37 microg/L); no matrix effects were 
observed. The polyphenol content of different Spanish alcohol-free beers is 
presented. Five phenolic compounds such as protocatechuic, p-coumaric, ferulic, 
caffeic acids, and (+)-catechin were identified at levels lower than 10 mg/L.

Polyphenols in the peel and pulp of 15 Basque cider apple varieties were 
determined by accelerated solvent extraction followed by reversed phase 
high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. It was 
observed that the polyphenolic composition in apple peel depended on varieties, 
whereas the main classes of phenolic compounds in apple pulp were flavan-3-ols 
and hydroxycinnamic acids in all cases, representing both together between 86 
and 95% of total polyphenols assayed.

The polyphenolic compositions of 31 Basque cider apple cultivars were determined 
in pulp, peel, and juice by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode 
array detection analysis of crude extracts and after thiolysis. Total 
polyphenols are distributed in a wide concentration range depending on the 
cultivar. Procyanidins are the class of polyphenols that present major 
concentrations in apple. Their average degrees of polymerization range from 4 to 
8 depending on the cultivar. Apple cultivars were technologically classified 
into bitter and nonbitter categories using different classification systems 
obtained by applying several pattern recognition techniques, such as principal 
component analysis, K-nearest neighbors, soft independent modeling of class 
analogy, partial least-squares, and multilayer feed-forward-artificial neural 
networks, to apple pulp, peel, or juice data (individual polyphenol 
concentrations, total procyanidin content, and the average degree of 
polymerization of procyanidins). Bitter apple cultivars present higher contents 
of flavan-3-ols and/or dihydrochalcones than nonbitter cultivars. Detailed 
knowledge of the polyphenolic profile of each apple cultivar affords information 
about their susceptibility to oxidation, their sensory properties (bitterness, 
astringency), and their possible influence on the characteristics and quality of 
the final product (juice, cider) when apples are processed.

Juices prepared from arils of 'Mollar' pomegranates were analysed for naturally 
occurring microorganisms, CIE Lab colour parameters, total phenols, anthocyanins 
and punicalagins, ellagic acid content and antioxidant capacity before and after 
low-, mild- and high-temperature pasteurisations (LTPs, MTPs and HTPs): 65, 80 
and 90 °C for 30 or 60s. Mean aerobic plate count (APC), yeast and mold count 
(YMC), and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) for fresh juices were 5.7, 5.36 and 4.0 
log CFU/mL, respectively. MTPs and HTPs were sufficiently effective to decrease 
APCs to nil or negligible levels. An increase in CIE a values and decrease in 
CIE b values were the characteristic colour changes in heat-treated juices. The 
effect of pasteurisations showed that total phenols, punicalagins and ellagic 
acid were not much affected by thermal processing. Total anthocyanin content and 
antioxidant capacity were substantially and significantly influenced by the heat 
treatment applied. A linear relationship was observed between Trolox equivalent 
antioxidant capacity (TEAC) values and total anthocyanins, suggesting that they 
contributed strongly to the antioxidant capacity of pomegranate juice.

Six selected phenolic aglycons (caffeic and ellagic acids, kaempferol, 
quercetin, myricetin, and morin) in nine types of berries, and their changes as 
influenced by jam processing, have been evaluated using optimized HPLC with 
diode-array detection. The berry samples, fresh and after jam processing, were 
analyzed, and the total amounts of selected phenolics as aglycons were 
identified and determined by acid hydrolysis. Their contents in fresh and jam 
samples did not indicate appreciable changes; therefore, the influence of jam 
processing on these selected phenolics in berries was suggested to be small, and 
was mostly present in berries as several conjugated forms that were 
glycosylated, esterified, etc., in the samples. The total phenolic content of 
each sample was also determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The three samples 
of each berry, namely fresh, jam, and acid hydrolysate of the berry, had similar 
total phenolic contents. On the other hand, the scavenging effect on the 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was measured, and acid hydrolysates 
showed stronger activity than that of the fresh and jam-processed samples for 
all of the berry types.

The ellagic acid, total phenolic, and vitamin C contents in four raspberry 
cultivars (Heritage, Autumn Bliss, Rubi, and Zeva) grown in Spain were detected 
and quantified by HPLC in fresh, just frozen, and stored fruits at -20 degrees C 
for a one year period. Ellagic acid [207-244 mg kg(-)(1) of fresh weight (fw)], 
total phenolic (137-1776 mg kg(-)(1) of fw), and vitamin C (221-312 mg kg(-)(1) 
of fw) contents in raw material were higher in the late cultivars Zeva and Rubi 
than in the early cultivars Autumn Bliss and Heritage. The freezing process 
slightly affected the values of extracted ellagic acid, total phenolic, and 
vitamin C content. At the end of long-term frozen storage (12 months), no 
significant change of total phenolic content extracted was observed, but 
significant decreases of 14-21% in ellagic acid and of 33-55% in vitamin C were 
quantified. Free radical scavenging capacity measured as antiradical efficiency 
(AE) depends on the seasonal period of harvest. Late cultivars, Rubi (6.1 x 
10(-)(4)) and Zeva (10.17 x 10(-)(4)), showed higher AE than early cultivars, 
Heritage (4.02 x 10(-)(4)) and Autumn Bliss (4.36 x 10(-)(4)). The freezing 
process produced a decrease of AE values in the four cultivars ranging between 4 
and 26%. During the frozen storage, the AE values reached after the freezing 
process remained unchanged.

The quantitative and qualitative evolution of the anthocyanins and volatile 
compounds of four raspberry cultivars (cvs. Heritage, Autumn Bliss, Zeva, and 
Rubi) growing in Spain were analyzed raw, just frozen, and during long-term 
frozen storage at -20 degrees C for a 1 year period. HS-SPME coupled with GC-MS 
and HPLC techniques were employed to study the evolution of the volatile 
compounds and the individual anthocyanins, respectively. The volatile aroma 
composition changes produced by the freezing process and long-term frozen 
storage were minimal. Only a significant increase in extraction capacity was 
obtained for alpha-ionone (27%) and for caryophyllene (67%) in Heritage at 12 
months of storage. The stability of anthocyanins to freezing and frozen storage 
depends on the seasonal period of harvest. Heritage and Autumn Bliss (early 
cultivars) were less affected by processing and long-term frozen storage (1 
year), and the total pigment extracted showed the tendency to increase 17 and 
5%, respectively. Rubi and Zeva (late cultivars) suffered a decreased trend on 
the total anthocyanin content of 4% for Rubi and 17.5% for Zeva. Cyanidin 
3-glucoside most easily suffered the degradative reactions that take place 
during processing and the storage period.

A number of potential antioxidants have been evaluated for their effect on 
formation of radicals in beer using the electron spin resonance (ESR) lag phase 
method. Sulfite was found to be the only compound that was able to delay the 
formation of radicals, whereas phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids, 
catechin, epicatechin, and proanthocyanidin dimers had no effect on the 
formation of radicals. Ascorbate, cystein, and cysteamin were on the other hand 
found to be prooxidants. It is suggested that antioxidants must be able to 
either scavenge peroxides or trap metal ions in order to be effective in beer. 
The effectiveness of sulfite is suggested to be a consequence of its 
two-electron nonradical producing reaction with peroxides.

Phenolic compounds are secondary plant metabolites which have long been 
associated with flavor and color characteristics of fruits and vegetables. These 
phenolic compounds attract great interest due to their postulated health 
protecting properties. However, adequate intakes and absorption rate of phenolic 
compounds are necessary for these beneficial effects. Until now, little is known 
about alterations of phenolic compounds content by the cooking process. In the 
present study, the influence of different volumes of cooking water on the amount 
of selected phenolic marker compounds resting in the vegetables was assessed. In 
zucchini, rutin was quantified as a marker for flavonoid glycosides. Chlorogenic 
acid, representative of phenolic acids was analyzed in carrots. In beans, rutin 
and quercitrin, both belonging to flavonoid glycosides, were investigated. In 
potatoes, chlorogenic and caffeic acid were determined. The cooking of zucchini, 
beans and carrots with smaller amounts of water resulted in significant higher 
content of phenolic phytochemicals in the vegetables compared to cooking with 
larger water volumes. For potatoes, which showed great variations in content of 
phenolic acids after cooking, no significant differences in phenolic acids was 
observed. It can be concluded from these observations, that real intakes of 
phenolic compounds from cooked vegetables are lower and that the amounts 
consumed are therefore overestimated.

The contents of pnenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers were quantified by 
HPLC analysis after alkaline hydrolysis in kernels of 17 rye (Secale cereale L.) 
varieties grown in one location in Denmark during 1997 and 1998. Significant 
variations (P < 0.05) with regard to the concentration of the analyzed 
components were observed among the different rye varieties and also between 
different harvest years. However, the content of phenolic acids in the analyzed 
rye varieties was narrow compared to cereals such as wheat and barley. The 
concentration of ferulic acid, the most abundant phenolic acid ranged from 900 
to 1170 microgram g(-1) dry matter. The content in sinapic acid ranged from 70 
to 140 microgram g(-1) dry matter, p-coumaric acid ranged from 40 to 70 
microgram g(-1) dry matter, and caffeic, p-hydroxybenzoic, protocatechuic, and 
vanillic acids were all detected in concentrations less than 20 microgram g(-1) 
dry matter. The most abundant ferulic acid dehydrodimer 8-O-4 -DiFA was 
quantified in concentrations from 130 to 200 microgram g(-1) dry matter followed 
by 8,5 -DiFA benzofuran form (50-100 microgram g(-1) dry matter), 5,5 -DiFA

alkalinization treatment ( Dutching), on the original content of these 
flavonoids has been studied. (-)-Epicatechin was in the range of 116.02-730.26 
microg/g, whereas (+)-catechin was in the range of 81.40-447.62 microg/g in the 
commercial cocoa products studied. Among flavonols, quercetin-3-arabinoside and 
isoquercitrin were the major flavonols in the cocoa powder products studied, 
ranging from 2.10 to 40.33 microg/g and from 3.97 to 42.74 microg/g, 
respectively, followed by quercetin-3-glucuronide (0.13-9.88 microg/g) and 
quercetin aglycone (0.28-3.25 microg/g). To our knowledge, these results are the 
first quantitative data in relation to the content of individualized flavonol 
derivatives in commercial cocoa powder products. The alkalinization treatment 
resulted in 60% loss of the mean total flavonoid content. Among flavanols, 
(-)-epicatechin presented a larger decline (67%, as a mean percentage 
difference) than (+)-catechin (38%), probably because of its epimerization into 
(-)-catechin, a less bioavailable form of catechin. A decline was also confirmed 
for di-, tri-, and tetrameric procyanidins. In the case of flavonols, quercetin 
presented the highest loss (86%), whereas quercetin-3-glucuronide, 
quercetin-3-arabinoside, and isoquercitrin showed a similar decrease (58, 62, 
and 61%, respectively). It is concluded that the large decrease found in the 
flavonoid content of natural cocoa powder, together with the observed change in 
the monomeric flavanol profile that results from the alkalinization treatment, 
could affect the antioxidant properties and the polyphenol biovailability of 
cocoa powder products.

Phenolic and orthodiphenolic compounds together with carotenoids, tocopherols, 
pigments, and fatty acids were tested for their antioxidant effect in 79 samples 
of virgin olive oils cv. Picual and Hojiblanca. A linear regression based on the 
oleic/linoleic ratio and the contents of phenols and tocopherols showed a good 
correlation (adjusted-R(2) = 0.91) with the stability measured by Rancimat, 
later verified with an external text set (adjusted-R(2) = 0.95). A tentative 
study on the percentage contribution of each chemical variable to stability is 
discussed. The contribution of phenolic and orthodiphenolic compounds was around 
51%, the composition of fatty acids 24%, and in less percentage 
alpha-tocopherol, carotenoids, and chlorophylls. No effect, or very little, was 
shown by beta- and gamma-tocopherols.

The objective of this work was to quantify the flavonoids present in foods most 
commonly consumed by the Brazilian population. The predominant flavonoids found 
in largest abundance in all of the analyzed vegetables were glycosides of 
quercetin. In lettuce, a small amount of luteolin was also detected. In sweet 
pepper, quercetin and luteolin were both present. White onion [48-56 mg/100 g of 
fresh weight (FW), expressed as aglycon], red onion (40-100 mg/100 g of FW), red 
lettuce (67-67.2 mg/100 g of FW), arugula (41-118 mg/100 g of FW), and chicory 
(18-38 mg/100 g of FW) were highest in total flavonoids. In fruits, the highest 
concentrations of flavonoids were found in the peel (125-170 mg/100 g of FW) and 
pulp (35-44 mg/100 g of FW) of oranges and in some apple varieties (14-36 mg/100 
g of FW). Variability in flavonoid content due to time of harvesting was high 
for leafy vegetables and red onions. The estimated ingestion by Brazilian 
population ranged from 60 to 106 mg/day.

(-)-epicatechin gallate (ECg), and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) in 24 
types of fruits, 27 types of vegetables and legumes, some staple foods, and 
processed foods commonly consumed in The Netherlands. Most fruits, chocolate, 
and some legumes contained catechins. Levels varied to a large extent: from 4.5 
mg/kg in kiwi fruit to 610 mg/kg in black chocolate. (+)-Catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin were the predominant catechins; GC, EGC, and ECg were detected 
in some foods, but none of the foods contained EGCg. The data reported here

The effects of product and preparation variables on the in-cup chemical 
composition of tea extracts is of interest because the appearance and taste 
characteristics and the possible health effects of a tea liquor arise from the 
chemical components extracted from the leaf during tea preparation. A 
comprehensive study was therefore undertaken to determine the contributions of 
product and preparation variables on the total soluble solids, caffeine, and 
polyphenol contents of tea extracts. The results of this study show that the 
variety, growing environment, manufacturing conditions, and grade (particle 
size) of the tea leaves each influence the tea leaf and final infusion 
compositions. In addition, the composition of the tea infusion was shown to be 
influenced by whether the tea was contained in a teabag and, if so, the size and 
material of construction of the bag. Finally, the preparation method, including 
the amounts of tea and water used, infusion time, and amount of agitation, was 
shown to be a major determinant of the component concentrations of tea beverages 
as consumed. An illustration of the variation introduced by these product and 
preparation factors is provided by comparing solids, caffeine, and polyphenol 
contents of green and black tea infusions when commercial products are prepared 
according to the instructions given on their packaging.

The major flavanone-7-O-glycoside constituents in citrus fruit juices (naringin, 
hesperidin, neohesperidin, narirutin, and eriocitrin) were separated as 
diastereomers by multidimensional liquid chromatography. The method consisted of 
coupling two HPLC columns: a reversed-phase (RP(18)) column was used for the 
separation of flavanone glycosides, which were, then, individually switched into 
a carboxymethylated beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD)-based column and resolved as the 
corresponding stereoisomers. The method was used for the full analysis of 
flavanone glycosides in fresh hand-squeezed and commercial fruit juices by 
combining the quantitative estimation with the diastereomeric analysis. 
Quantitative data were in general consistent with previously reported data in 
this field. CC-LC isomer analysis was carried out by coupling the beta-CD column 
with a mass spectrometer operated with negative ion electrospray ionization 
(ESI-MS). The results showed that hesperidin was present in orange juices almost 
exclusively as the 2S isomer, whereas narirutin had mainly the 2R configuration. 
In grapefruit juices (2S)-naringin prevailed with the respect to the 2R isomer, 
whereas the opposite was true for narirutin. Lemon juices contained eriocitrin 
stereoisomers in equal amount (50% each), but hesperidin was almost exclusively 
found as the 2S isomer. Significant differences of the diastereomeric ratios 
were observed between freshly squeezed juices and juices from commercial 
sources.

Sorghum procyanidins were characterized and quantified from two brown sorghum 
varieties and their processed products by normal phase HPLC with fluorescence 
detection. The DP of the procyanidins was determined by thiolysis. 
Quantification was done by using purified oligomeric and polymeric cocoa 
procyanidins as external standards. Sorghum procyanidins were composed mostly of 
high MW (DP > 10) polymers. Significant differences were observed in levels as 
well as distribution of the different MW procyanidins between the sorghums. 
Processing of the sorghum brans into cookies and bread significantly reduced the 
levels of procyanidins; this effect was more pronounced in the higher MW 
polymers. Cookies had a higher retention of procyanidins (42-84%) than bread 
(13-69%). Extrusion of sorghum grain resulted in an increase in the levels of 
procyanidin oligomers with DP </= 4 and decrease in polymers with DP >/= 6. This 
suggests a possible breakdown of the high MW polymers to the lower MW 
constituents during extrusion. Processing changes not only the content of 
procyanidins in sorghum products but also the relative ratio of the different 
molecular weights.

(-)-Epicatechin is a major polyphenol component of cocoa powder. The absorption 
and urinary excretion of (-)-epicatechin following administration of different 
levels of either cocoa powder (150, 750, and 1500 mg/kg) or (-)-epicatechin (1, 
5, and 10 mg/kg) were evaluated in rats. Both the sum of plasma (-)-epicatechin 
metabolites at 1 h postadministration and peak plasma concentrations increased 
in a dose-dependent fashion. The sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in urine, 
excreted within 18 h postadministration, also increased with dose. Moreover, the 
sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites excreted in urine reached the same level in 
both (-)-epicatechin and cocoa powder administration groups for equivalent 
amounts of (-)-epicatechin. These results suggest that, in the dose range 
examined in this study, bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin following 
administration of either (-)-epicatechin or cocoa powder shows dose dependence 
and that the various compounds present in cocoa powder have little effect on the 
bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin in cocoa powder.

We compared levels of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and their metabolites in 
rat plasma and urine after oral administration. Rats were divided into four 
groups and given (+)-catechin (CA group), (-)-epicatechin (EC group), a mixture 
of the two (MIX group) or deionized water. Blood samples were collected before 
administration and at designated time intervals thereafter. Urine samples were 
collected 0-24 h postadministration. (+)-Catechin, (-)-epicatechin and their 
metabolites in plasma and urine were analyzed by HPLC-mass spectrometry after 
treatment with beta-glucuronidase and/or sulfatase. After administration, 
absorbed (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were mainly present in plasma as 
metabolites, such as nonmethylated or 3'-O-methylated conjugates. In the CA and 
MIX groups, the primary metabolite of (+)-catechin in plasma was glucuronide in 
the nonmethylated form. In the EC and MIX groups, in contrast, the primary 
metabolites of (-)-epicatechin in plasma were glucuronide and sulfoglucuronide 
in nonmethylated forms, and sulfate in the 3'-O-methylated forms. Urinary 
excretion of the total amount of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in the EC group was 
significantly higher than the amount of (+)-catechin metabolites in the CA 
group. The sum of (+)-catechin metabolites in the urine was significantly lower 
in the MIX group than in the CA group, and the sum of (-)-epicatechin 
metabolites in the MIX group was also significantly lower than in the EC group. 
These results suggest that the bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin is higher than 
that of (+)-catechin in rats, and that, in combination, (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin might be absorbed competitively in the gastrointestinal tract of 
rats.

BACKGROUND: Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural polyphenolic substance contained 
in many Lamiaceae herbs such as Perilla frutescens. Previous studies have shown 
RA has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activity. However, little is known on 
the absorption, metabolism, degradation and excretion of RA.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study in healthy humans was to determine the 
absorption, metabolism, and urinary excretion of RA after a single intake of 
perilla extract (PE).
METHOD: Six healthy men (mean age 37.2 +/- 6.2 y and mean body mass index 22.0 
+/- 1.9 kg/m(2)) were enrolled in the study that was a crossover design 
involving single intakes of PE containing 200 mg RA and placebo with a 10 day 
interval between treatments. Blood samples were collected before intake and at 
designated time intervals, while urine samples were collected over the periods 
0-6 h, 6-24 h and 24-48 h after intake. RA and its related metabolites in plasma 
and urine were measured by LC-MS.
RESULTS: RA, methylated RA (methyl-RA), caffeic acid (CAA), ferulic acid (FA) 
and a trace of m-coumaric acid (COA) were detected in the urine after intake of 
PE. In plasma, RA, methyl-RA and FA were detected, with maximum levels obtained 
0.5, 2 and 0.5 h after intake of PE, respectively. The majority of these 
components in both plasma and urine were present as conjugated forms 
(glucuronide and/or sulfated). The proportion of RA and its related metabolites 
excreted in the urine was 6.3 +/- 2.2% of the total dose, with approximately 75% 
of these components being excreted within 6 h after intake of PE.
CONCLUSIONS: RA contained in PE was absorbed, conjugated and methylated 
following intake, with a small proportion of RA being degraded into various 
components, such as conjugated forms of CAA, FA and COA. These metabolites were 
then rapidly excreted in the urine.

BACKGROUND: Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols such as catechins and 
procyanidins and has been shown in various models to inhibit LDL oxidation and 
atherogenesis.
OBJECTIVE: We examined whether long-term intake of cocoa powder alters plasma 
lipid profiles in normocholesterolemic and mildly hypercholesterolemic human 
subjects.
DESIGN: Twenty-five subjects were randomly assigned to ingest either 12 g 
sugar/d (control group) or 26 g cocoa powder and 12 g sugar/d (cocoa group) for 
12 wk. Blood samples were collected before the study and 12 wk after intake of 
the test drinks. Plasma lipids, LDL oxidative susceptibility, and urinary 
oxidative stress markers were measured.
RESULTS: At 12 wk, we measured a 9% prolongation from baseline levels in the lag 
time of LDL oxidation in the cocoa group. This prolongation in the cocoa group 
was significantly greater than the reduction measured in the control group 
(-13%). A significantly greater increase in plasma HDL cholesterol (24%) was 
observed in the cocoa group than in the control group (5%). A negative 
correlation was observed between plasma concentrations of HDL cholesterol and 
oxidized LDL. At 12 wk, there was a 24% reduction in dityrosine from baseline 
concentrations in the cocoa group. This reduction in the cocoa group was 
significantly greater than the reduction in the control group (-1%).
CONCLUSION: It is possible that increases in HDL-cholesterol concentrations may 
contribute to the suppression of LDL oxidation and that polyphenolic substances 
derived from cocoa powder may contribute to an elevation in HDL cholesterol.

Kakkalide is a major isoflavonoid from the flowers of Pueraria lobata (Willd.) 
Ohwi, possessing the protective effect against ethanol-induced intoxication and 
hepatic injury. The metabolism of kakkalide was investigated in rats. Thirteen 
metabolites were isolated by using solvent extraction and repeated 
chromatographic methods and identified by using spectroscopic methods including 
UV, IR, mass spectrometry, NMR, and circular dichroism experiments. Four new 
compounds were identified as irisolidone-7-O-glucuronide (M-1), 
tectorigenin-7-O-sulfate (M-2), tectorigenin-4'-O-sulfate (M-3), and biochanin 
A-6-O-sulfate (M-4) together with nine known compounds identified as irisolidone 
(M-5), tectorigenin (M-6), tectoridin (M-7), 
5,7-dihydroxy-8,4'-dimethoxyisoflavone (M-8), isotectorigenin (M-9), biochanin A 
(M-10), genistein (M-11), daidzein (M-12), and equol (M-13). The metabolic 
pathway of kakkalide was proposed, which is important to understand its 
metabolic fate and disposition in humans.

Phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of extra-virgin olive oils 
extracted from several Italian varieties were studied at production and during 
storage. The antioxidant activity was measured according to the following tests: 
in the aqueous phase, by radical scavenging of the 
2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical cation; and 
in the lipid phase, using the beta-carotene bleaching method. The phenolic 
content was not correlated to the oxidation indices (peroxide value and 
spectrophotometric constants). The phenolic contents and profiles of the various 
cultivars showed remarkable differences. The phenolic content was strongly 
correlated with the antioxidant activity measured according to the beta-carotene 
test and weakly correlated with the radical scavenging ability.

Four trichothecene-producing strains of Fusarium graminearum were grown on three 
maize grain fractions, whole grain, degermed grain, and the germ, to determine 
the effect of natural substrates on mycotoxin production. Monitoring the 
ergosterol content after 25 days of incubation indicated that fungal growth on 
all grain fractions was comparable. Trichothecene (TCT) production was highest 
on degermed grain, less on whole grain, and very low or nondetectable on the 
germ; similar results were found with four different strains. It was concluded 
that inhibitor(s) of TCT biosynthesis were present in maize germ. The presence 
of phenolic compounds was investigated in the different fractions. The 
hydroxamate 4-acetylbenzoxazolin-2-one (4-ABOA), a known inhibitor of mycotoxin 
production, was found in the degermed and whole grain fractions but not in the 
germ. Therefore, the TCT inhibition observed on the maize germ fraction used in 
our study is clearly not linked to 4-ABOA. Other soluble phenolic compounds were 
found at a much higher concentration in the germ than in the two other 
fractions. The inhibition property of the soluble ester-bound extracts was 
tested in liquid culture. A possible role for these compounds is discussed.

Sage herb (Salvia officinalis L.) was extracted at supercritical fluid 
extraction (SFE) conditions with carbon dioxide at different parameters and the 
extracts tested on their antioxidant activity (AA). SFE of sage herb at 35 MPa 
pressure was found to be an effective method to obtain pure extracts. The yields 
of the extracts were substantially increased by using 1% of entrainer solvent 
ethanol. The fractionation of sage extract was a complex procedure in terms of 
extract distribution between separators operating at various pressure and 
temperature conditions. It was also proved by testing the AA of the extracts in 
rapeseed oil. The effect of the extracts on the rapeseed oil weight gain varied 
in a wide range (from 'very low' to 'high') depending on the fractionation 
conditions. Preliminary results showed that to obtain more effective antioxidant 
fractions separation steps should be started at 10 MPa lower pressure than that 
used for the extraction.

A novel gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) method was 
developed, using an ion trap mass spectrometer, for the simultaneous 
determination of olive oil bioactive components, elenolic acid, hydroxytyrosol, 
and tyrosol, in rat urine. Samples were analyzed by GC-MS/MS prior to and after 
enzymatic treatment. A solid phase extraction sample pretreatment step with 
greater than 80% analytical recoveries for all compounds was performed followed 
by a derivatization reaction prior to GC-MS/MS analysis. The calibration curves 
were linear for all compounds studied for a dynamic range between 1 and 500 ng. 
The limit of detection was in the mid picogram level for tyrosol and elenolic 
acid (300 pg) and in the low picogram level for hydroxytyrosol (2.5 pg). The 
method was applied to the analysis of rat urine samples after sustained oral 
intake of oleuropein or extra virgin olive oil as a diet supplement.

Oleuropein (OE) is the cardinal bioactive compound derived from Olea europaea 
and possesses numerous beneficial properties for human health. However, despite 
the plethora of analytical methods that have studied the biological fate of 
olive oil-derived bioactive compounds, no validated methodology has been 
published to date for the simultaneous determination of OE, along with all its 
major metabolites. In this study, a liquid chromatography-electrospray 
ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS/MS) method has been developed and 
validated for the quantification of OE, simultaneously with its main metabolites 
hydroxytyrosol, 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid, 
4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methoxy-phenol or homovanillyl alcohol, 
2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid or homovanillic acid, and elenolic acid 
in rat plasma matrix. Samples were analyzed by LC-ESI MS/MS prior to and after 
enzymatic treatment. A solid-phase extraction step with high mean recovery for 
all compounds was performed as sample pretreatment. Calibration curves were 
linear for all bioactive compounds over the range studied, while the method 
exhibited good accuracy, intra- and inter-day precision. The limit of detection 
was in the picogram range (per milliliterof plasma) for HT and OE and in the 
nanogram range (per milliliter of plasma) for the other analytes, and the method 
was simple and rapid. The developed methodology was successfully applied for the 
simultaneous quantification of OE and its aforementioned metabolites in rat 
plasma samples, thus demonstrating its suitability for pharmacokinetics, as well 
as bioavailability and metabolism studies.

A microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) method has been applied for the first time 
to the extraction of the main lignan, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), 
and the two most concentrated hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in flaxseed. The 
effects of microwave power, extraction time and alkaline treatment were 
investigated. It was shown that a 3 min MAE resulted in an SDG content of 
16.1+/-0.4 mg/g, a p-coumaric acid glucoside content of 3.7+/-0.2 mg/g and a 
ferulic acid glucoside content of 4.1+/-0.2 mg/g. These values were compared 
with those obtained using conventional extraction methods and the results 
demonstrated that MAE was more effective in terms of both yield and time 
consumption.

In this paper, the simultaneous separation of several polyphenols such as 
(+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin, theophylline, caffeine in 
green and black teas by capillary electrochromatography (CEC) was developed. 
Several experimental parameters such as stationary phase type, mobile phase 
composition, buffer and pH, inner diameter of the columns, sample injection, 
were evaluated to obtain the complete separation of the analysed compounds. 
Baseline resolution of the studied polyphenols was achieved within 30 min by 
using a capillary column (id 100 microm) packed with bidentate C(18) particles 
for 24.5 cm and a mobile phase composed of 5 mM ammonium acetate buffer pH 4 
with H(2)O/ACN (80:20, v/v). The applied voltage and the temperature were set at 
30 kV and 20 degrees C. Precision, detection and quantification limits, 
linearity, and accuracy were investigated. A good linearity (R(2) > 0.9992) was 
achieved over a concentration working range of 2-100 microg/mL for all the 
analytes. LOD and LOQ were 1 and 2 microg/mL, respectively, for all studied 
compounds. The CEC method was applied to the analysis of those polyphenols in 
green and black tea samples after an extraction procedure. Good recovery data 
from accuracy studies ranged between 90% and 112% for all analytes.

The variation in flavonoid concentration and composition was investigated in 
baby spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) cv. Emilia sown on three occasions, each 
harvested at three growth stages at 6-day intervals. After harvest, leaves were 
stored in polypropylene bags at 2 or 10 degrees C. Flavonoids were analyzed by 
reversed phase HPLC. Twelve flavonoid peaks were detected. The main flavonoid, 
making up on average 43% of the total flavonoid concentration, was identified as 
5,3',4'-trihydroxy-3-methoxy-6:7-methylenedioxyflavone-4'-glucuronide. Four 
other flavonoids each contributed 7-12% of the total flavonoid content. Total 
flavonoid content was relatively stable during normal retail storage conditions, 
although some of the individual flavonoid compounds showed considerable 
variation. The youngest plants had the highest flavonoid concentration, 
indicating that by harvesting the baby spinach a few days earlier than the 
current commercial stage of harvest, the flavonoid concentration in the product 
may be increased and the content of potentially health-promoting compounds 
enhanced.

Qualitative and quantitative differences among the constituents in various 
fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill., family Apiaceae) teas prepared by classical 
infusion, microwave decoction, and dissolution are reported. Different 
commercial starting materials, such as fruit (unbroken and crushed), four herbal 
teas, and two instant herbal teas were evaluated. Chlorogenic acid (1), 
quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide (2), p-anisaldehyde (3), and trans-anethole (4) 
were identified by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS as constituents of fennel teas. No 
coumarins, which are characteristic constituents of plants of Apiaceae family, 
were found. Trans-anethole (4), the main constituent of the essential oil, was 
present in all teas. In addition p-anisaldehyde (3), a degradation product of 
trans-anethole, was also identified in all teas with the exception of two 
samples. Chlorogenic acid (1) and quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide (2) were also 
present in all teas. In addition, minor unidentified flavonol constituents were 
found in two teas. Quality, activity, and safety of the content of the 
investigated preparations are also discussed.

All the pea varieties differed significantly (p < 0.05) in their phytic acid 
content. The field pea cultivars had significantly (p < 0.05) higher levels of 
phytic acid and polyphenols than those of vegetable pea varieties. All the 
domestic processing and cooking methods could reduce the contents of phytic acid 
and polyphenols but germination for 48 hours seemed to have a marked lowering 
effect on the levels of these antinutrients in peas.

Health-promoting properties such as antioxidative, anticarcinogenic, and 
cholesterol-lowering effects are described for mangiferin and hesperidin, the 
major phenolic compounds present in Cyclopia genistoides (honeybush). However, 
knowledge of their metabolic fate and their absorption from the gastrointestinal 
tract is very limited. The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations 
of mangiferin, hesperidin, and their metabolites in plasma, urine, and feces 
samples from pigs consuming an extract of Cyclopia genistoides. Pigs were 
administered up to 74 mg mangiferin per kilogram of body weight and 1 mg 
hesperidin per kilogram of body weight per day for 11 days. Plasma samples were 
collected at various time points on days 9 and 11 of the study and days 1 and 2 
after termination of extract administration. Urine and feces were collected in 
fractions for 24 hours. In the plasma samples, the aglycone of mangiferin 
(norathyriol) was detected. Mean plasma concentrations ranged from 7.8 to 11.8 
mumol/L. Six metabolites of mangiferin and hesperidin were detected in the 
urine, including methyl mangiferin, norathyriol, its monoglucuronide, 
hesperetin, hesperetin monoglucuronide, and eriodictyol monoglucuronide. Between 
26.0% and 30.8% of the administered dose of hesperidin and only between 1.4% and 
1.6% of mangiferin could be detected in the urine on days 9 and 11 of the study. 
Approximately 8.2% of the administered dose of mangiferin was determined in the 
feces. The main metabolite was norathyriol. Neither hesperidin nor metabolites 
ascribed to hesperidin intake were detected. The results suggest that formation 
of norathyriol from mangiferin occurs in vivo, and specific metabolites were 
identified in blood and excretion products in urine and feces. This study will 
aid in investigating the physiological functions of the parent compounds in 
vivo.

BACKGROUND: Despite decades of research on the relation between soy and breast 
cancer, questions regarding the absorption, metabolism, and distribution of 
isoflavones in breast tissue largely remain unanswered.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the potential health effects of isoflavone consumption 
on normal breast tissue; isoflavone concentrations, metabolites, and 
biodistribution were investigated and compared with 17beta-estradiol exposure.
DESIGN: In this dietary intervention study, healthy women were randomly 
allocated to a soy milk (n = 11; 16.98-mg genistein and 5.40-mg daidzein 
aglycone equivalents per dose), soy supplement (n = 10; 5.27-mg genistein and 
17.56-mg daidzein aglycone equivalents per dose), or control (n = 10) group. 
After a run-in period > or = 4 d, 3 doses of soy milk or soy supplements were 
taken daily for 5 d before an esthetic breast reduction. Blood and breast 
biopsies were collected during surgery and analyzed with liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: After soy administration, genistein and total daidzein concentrations, 
which were expressed as aglycone equivalents, ranged from 135.1 to 2831 nmol/L 
and 105.1 to 1397 nmol/L, respectively, in hydrolyzed serum and from 92.33 to 
493.8 pmol/g and 22.15 to 770.8 pmol/g, respectively, in hydrolyzed breast 
tissue. The major metabolites identified in nonhydrolyzed samples were 
genistein-7-O-glucuronide and daidzein-7-O-glucuronide, with an overall 
glucuronidation of 98%. Total isoflavones showed a breast adipose/glandular 
tissue distribution of 40:60, and their mean (+/-SEM) derived 17beta-estradiol 
equivalents toward estrogen receptor beta were 21 +/- 4-fold and 40 +/- 10-fold 
higher than the 17beta-estradiol concentrations in adipose (0.283 +/- 0.089 
pmol/g, P < 0.001) and glandular (0.246 +/- 0.091 pmol/g, P = 0.001) fractions, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: After intake of soy milk and soy supplements, isoflavones reach 
exposure levels in breast tissue at which potential health effects may occur.

Olive oil is the main source of fat in the Mediterranean diet, and its 
consumption has been related to a low incidence of coronary heart disease and 
certain cancers. Recent findings demonstrate that olive oil phenolics are 
powerful in vitro and in vivo antioxidants and display other biological 
activities that could partially account for the observed healthful effects of 
the Mediterranean diet. A detailed method optimization plan was carried out to 
separate the most popular phenols in olive oil for four separation parameters: 
buffer concentration, buffer pH, applied voltage and temperature. Consequently, 
an analytical method capable of separating 21 different phenols and polyphenols 
by capillary zone electrophoresis was developed; the separation was performed 
within 10 min, using a 40 cm x 50 microm capillary, with a 45 mM sodium 
tetraborate buffer (pH 9.60), at 27 kV and 30 degrees C. The optimized method 
was applied to methanolic extracts of several Italian extra-virgin olive oils 
obtained by different technologies in order to characterize and to compare their 
antioxidant profile. Positive correlations of phenolic compounds found by 
capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and two colorimetric indexes (total 
polyphenols and o-diphenols) were found and discussed.

Phenolic compounds are found in both free and bound forms in cereals. The 
majority is in the insoluble bound form, that is, bound to cell wall material, 
such as ferulic acid and its derivatives. The antioxidant properties of the 
phenolic compounds in grains are associated with the health benefits of grains 
and grain products. The extraction capacity of several solvent mixtures, for 
extracting free phenols from barley flours, and the possibility of employing a 
rapid automated solvent extraction method were studied. The extraction yield of 
each method was evaluated by correlating several spectrophotometric indices 
(absorption at 280, 320, and 370 nm and total phenolic compounds by the 
Folin-Ciocalteu method) with the antioxidant activities of the barley extracts 
(scavenging activity by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl method). Interesting 
results were obtained when ethanol and acetone-based extraction mixtures were 
employed to extract free phenols. A comparison was made between alkaline and 
acid hydrolysis. The extraction yield of bound phenolic compounds increased when 
the digestion time for alkaline hydrolysis was prolonged.

Capillary electrophoresis (CE) can be effectively used as a fast screening tool 
to obtain qualitative and semiquantitative information about simple and complex 
phenolic compounds of extra virgin olive oil. Three simple phenols (tyrosol, 
hydroxytyrosol, and vanillic acid), a secoiridoid derivative (deacetoxy 
oleuropein aglycon), and two lignans (pinoresinol and acetoxypinoresinol) were 
detected as the main compounds in extra virgin olive oils by high-performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). 
Spectrophotometric indices, radical scavenging activity, and oxidative stability 
of extra virgin olive oil samples obtained from olives hand-picked at different 
ripening degrees were statistically correlated with the CZE and HPLC 
quantification. The concentration of phenols in extra virgin olive oil decreased 
with ripeness of olive fruits. The high correlations found between CZE and the 
other analytical results indicate that CE can be applied as a rapid and reliable 
tool to routinely determine phenolic compounds in extra virgin olive oils.

The red grape constituent resveratrol possesses cancer chemopreventive 
properties in rodents. The hypothesis was tested that, in healthy humans, p.o. 
administration of resveratrol is safe and results in measurable plasma levels of 
resveratrol. A phase I study of oral resveratrol (single doses of 0.5, 1, 2.5, 
or 5 g) was conducted in 10 healthy volunteers per dose level. Resveratrol and 
its metabolites were identified in plasma and urine by high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and quantitated by high-performance 
liquid chromatography-UV. Consumption of resveratrol did not cause serious 
adverse events. Resveratrol and six metabolites were recovered from plasma and 
urine. Peak plasma levels of resveratrol at the highest dose were 539 +/- 384 
ng/mL (2.4 micromol/L, mean +/- SD; n = 10), which occurred 1.5 h post-dose. 
Peak levels of two monoglucuronides and resveratrol-3-sulfate were 3- to 8-fold 
higher. The area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) values for 
resveratrol-3-sulfate and resveratrol monoglucuronides were up to 23 times 
greater than those of resveratrol. Urinary excretion of resveratrol and its 
metabolites was rapid, with 77% of all urinary agent-derived species excreted 
within 4 h after the lowest dose. Cancer chemopreventive effects of resveratrol 
in cells in vitro require levels of at least 5 micromol/L. The results presented 
here intimate that consumption of high-dose resveratrol might be insufficient to 
elicit systemic levels commensurate with cancer chemopreventive efficacy. 
However, the high systemic levels of resveratrol conjugate metabolites suggest 
that their cancer chemopreventive properties warrant investigation.

A healthy diet involves eating fruit and vegetables on a daily basis, the 
benefits of which are in part linked to the ingestion of bioactive compounds 
including polyphenols. As a convenient means of delivering additional 
polyphenols to the diet, a polyphenol-rich (P-R) juice drink was prepared and 
the bioavailability of its diverse spectrum of constituents investigated. Ten 
human volunteers followed a low-flavonoid diet for 2 days before drinking 350 mL 
of the P-R beverage. Plasma and urine were collected for 24 h and analyzed by 
HPLC-PDA-MS. The plasma pharmacokinetics and recoveries of urinary metabolites 
of flavan-3-ols, flavanones, dihydrochalcones and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, both 
in terms of their identity and quantity, were, in most instances, not markedly 
different to those reported in other feeding studies with green tea, orange 
juice, apple cider and coffee. This indicates that the combination of 
polyphenolic compounds in the P-R beverage are absorbed and excreted to a 
similar extent whether fed individually or together in a single beverage. It is 
concluded that the P-R beverage can deliver the intended blend of bioavailable 
polyphenols, which would normally require consumption of several different 
plant-derived foods.

Three seeds of Turkish origin, flax, poppy and safflower were analyzed for their 
proximate, fatty acids, tocols (tocopherols and tocotrienols) and total phenolic 
composition, and oxidative stability of their oil. The major fatty acid in the 
flax oil was alpha-linolenic acid, comprising 58.3% of total fatty acids, 
whereas poppy and safflower oils were rich in linoleic acid at 74.5% and 70.5% 
level, respectively. The amount of total tocols was 14.6 mg/100g flax, 
11.0mg/100g poppy and 12.1mg/100g safflower seed. Flax and poppy oil were rich 
in gamma-tocopherol as 79.4 mg/100g oil and 30.9 mg/100g oil, respectively, 
while alpha-tocopherol (44.1g/100g oil) was dominant in safflower oil. Only 
alpha- and gamma-tocotrienol were found in the oils. Oxidative stability of oils 
was measured at 110 degrees C at the rate of 20 L/h air flow rate, and poppy oil 
(5.56 h) was most stabile oil followed by safflower oil (2.87 h) and flax oil 
(1.57). There were no correlation between oxidative stability and unsaturation 
degree of fatty acids and tocol levels of the oils. All of the seeds 
investigated provide a healthy oil profile and may have potential as a source of 
specialty oils on a commercial scale.

Eight avenanthramides, amides of anthranilic acid (1) and 5-hydroxyanthranilic 
acid (2), respectively, and the four cinnamic acids p-coumaric (p), caffeic (c), 
ferulic (f), and sinapic (s) acid, were synthesized for identification in oat 
extracts and for structure-antioxidant activity studies. Three compounds (2p, 
2c, and 2f) were found in oat extracts. As assessed by the reactivity toward 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), all avenanthramides except 1p showed 
activity. Initially, the antioxidant activity of the avenanthramides decreased 
in a similar order as for the corresponding cinnamic acids, that is: sinapic > 
caffeic > ferulic > p-coumaric acid. The avenanthramides derived from 2 were 
usually slightly more active than those derived from 1. All avenanthramides 
inhibited azo-initiated peroxidation of linoleic acid. 1c and 1s were initially 
the most effective compounds. The relative order of antioxidant activities was 
slightly different for the DPPH and the linoleic acid assays run in methanol and 
chlorobenzene, respectively.

Extraction methods to determine olive oil phenols are not exhaustive. A 
procedure to test their effectiveness, based on the treatment of the extracted 
oil with 2 N HCl followed by analysis of phenols in the aqueous phase, has been 
developed. It was concluded, using this test, that 15-40% of phenols remained 
unextracted when the liquid/liquid extraction method with 80% methanol was 
applied. Solid phase extraction (C(18) cartridge) succeeded in retaining most of 
the phenols in the cartridge, but the recovery yield from the sorbent material 
was low. However, a new extraction method, based on the use of 
N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as an extraction solvent, achieved a complete 
extraction of phenols from oils. The proposed method requires a lower amount of 
oil, solvents, energy, and labor than the traditional ones. Because of the low 
concentration of phenols in the DMF extract, the highly sensitive 
electrochemical detector (EC) technique was studied. All of the phenols detected 
by the traditional UV detectors were also detected by EC using a coulometric 
array system. A rapid and complete analytical methodology of phenols in olive 
oil has been proposed based on coupling DMF extraction and EC detection.

Oranges are rich sources of flavonoids that are bioactive and may protect 
against age-related diseases. The absorption of orange flavanones may be 
affected by factors such as processing and subject anthropometric variables, and 
the bioactivity of the absorbed phytochemicals depends on how they are 
metabolised during absorption. In a randomised cross-over study, twenty subjects 
consumed a single portion of orange fruit (150 g) or juice (300 g) that 
contained the flavanones narirutin and hesperidin, and an additional 109 
subjects across a broad age range (18-80 years) consumed the juice. Flavanone 
metabolites were measured in regularly collected samples of plasma and urine. 
After consumption of fruit or juice, flavanone conjugates, but not the 
aglycones, were detected in plasma and urine. The flavanone conjugates were 
shown to include the 7- and 4'-O-monoglucuronides of naringenin, the 7- and 
3'-O-monoglucuronides of hesperetin, two hesperetin diglucuronides and a 
hesperetin sulfo-glucuronide, but no aglycones or rutinosides. Analysis of the 
plasma pharmacokinetic and urinary excretion data on a dose-adjusted basis 
indicated no difference in absorption or excretion of either flavanone between 
the fruit and juice matrices. In the extended urinary excretion dataset the 
individual variation was very large (range 0-59 % urinary yield). There was a 
small but significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the excretion of hesperetin (but 
not naringenin) with increasing age (P < 0.05), but the effects of sex, BMI and 
contraceptive pill use were shown not to be associated with the variation in 
flavanone excretion.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data showed that tomato and tomato product (sauce, 
paste) consumption is associated with a protective effect against the 
development of some chronic-degenerative diseases. Tomato antioxidant bioactive 
molecules such as carotenoids and polyphenols could be responsible, at least in 
part, for the healthy effect observed. The bioavailability of these compounds is 
an essential requirement to sustain their in vivo role. While it is well known 
that many factors can influence the bioaccessibility of carotenoids from the 
food matrix, there is little information about the factors affecting phenolic 
compounds' bioaccessibility.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This investigation was carried out to evaluate the effect of 
domestic cooking on the bioavailability in humans of antioxidant molecules after 
the administration of a test meal containing cherry tomatoes.
METHODS: A cross-over design was conducted. Subjects (3 females and 2 males) 
consumed experimental meals containing fresh and cooked cherry tomatoes. Blood 
collection was performed at different time intervals (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h).
RESULTS: Carotenoid and phenol plasma concentrations were measured. Plasma 
levels of lycopene and beta-carotene were not significantly different with 
respect to the baseline after ingestion of both the test meals, while plasma 
concentrations of naringenin and chlorogenic acid increased significantly with 
respect to the baseline (P<0.05) after administration of cooked cherry tomatoes, 
but not after administration of fresh cherry tomatoes.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated that domestically cooked tomatoes 
significantly increase naringenin and chlorogenic acid plasma levels. 
Considering that both naringenin and chlorogenic acid are widely studied for 
their potential healthy properties, evidence of their bioavailability and of the 
factors influencing their bioaccessibility is an important tool to sustain the 
possibility that these polyphenols play a biological role in human physiology.

The carotenoid and phenolic acid contents in fresh, stored and processed 
(blanched, frozen and boiled) spinach were comparatively determined by 
spectrophotometric and HPLC analyses. The major carotenoids identified after 
HPLC analysis in saponified samples were lutein (37-53μg/kg), β-carotene 
(18-31μg/kg), violaxanthin (9-23μg/kg) and neoxanthin (10-22μg/kg). These 
carotenoids were all affected by storage and/or heating. The content of 
carotenoids was best preserved after storage for one day at 4°C. The total 
phenolic content in the fresh spinach was 2088mg GAE/kg FW. After LC-MS analysis 
three phenolic acids were identified and quantified. These being ortho-coumaric 
acid (28-60mg/kg FW), ferulic acid (10-35mg/kg) and para-coumaric acid 
(1-30mg/kg) depending on the sample type. After storage of spinach at different 
temperatures (4°C or -18°C) the amount of total phenolic compounds decreased by 
around 20%, while the amount of individual phenolic acids increased by four 
times on average.

Nutritional trials often yield inconsistent results due to the lack of 
standardised study designs, especially when evaluating the health benefits of 
fruits and vegetables. Apple phenolics, linked to various health benefits, have 
particular challenges in human nutritional studies due to compositional changes 
influenced by factors like fruit maturity, growing conditions, tissue type, and 
processing methods. This study applied an 'orchard-to-fork' approach to evaluate 
Monty's Surprise apple phenolics in the skin and flesh, controlling for harvest 
procedures, fruit maturity, and seasonal impact. It further assessed processing 
methods to preserve phenolic content, with the goal of developing a standardised 
material for dietary intervention trials. Monty's Surprise apples were collected 
over two seasons following standardised harvesting protocols and various fruit 
maturity parameters (firmness, starch pattern, and total soluble solids) were 
controlled and measured for various apple sizes. Phenolic content in the skin 
and flesh was analysed with LC-HRAM-MS and compared across seasons. The impacts 
of processing (pureeing, air drying, and slicing) on phenolic content were also 
evaluated. Cold storage for four weeks reduced maturity variability across apple 
sizes. Monty's Surprise apple skin (5270.49 ± 214.95 mg kg-1 FW) had 
significantly (p < 0.0001) higher phenolic concentrations than the flesh (863.69 
± 12.71 mg kg-1 FW), with procyanidins as the main phenolic group. No seasonal 
impact was observed. Pureed apples retained significantly higher phenolics 
compared to sliced or dehydrated samples. Monty's Surprise apple is a rich 
source of health-beneficial phenolics, and pureeing effectively preserves these 
compounds. This study offers guidance for the development of standardised apple 
material for dietary intervention trials to more accurately investigate the 
health benefits of apples.

PURPOSE: The flavones apigenin and tricin, which occur in leafy vegetables and 
rice bran, respectively, possess cancer chemopreventive properties in 
preclinical rodent models. Their pharmacology is only poorly understood. We 
compared their tissue levels in mice in vivo and their metabolism in liver 
fractions in vitro.
METHODS: Mice received apigenin or tricin (0.2%) with their diet for 5-7 days, 
and flavone levels were compared in the plasma, liver and gastrointestinal 
mucosa using HPLC-UV. Flavone metabolism was investigated in murine and human 
liver microsomes or cytosol in vitro co-incubated with uridine 
5'-diphosphoglucuronic acid or 3'-phosphoadenosine-5' phosphosulfate. Flavone 
metabolites were characterized by on-line HPLC-mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: After dietary administration of flavones for 7 days, levels of tricin 
in plasma, liver and mucosa exceeded those of apigenin by 350, 33 and 100%, 
respectively. Apigenin was more rapidly glucuronidated than tricin in liver 
microsomes, whilst tricin underwent swifter sulfonation than apigenin in liver 
cytosol. For either flavone the rate of glucuronidation was much faster than 
that of sulfonation. Flavone monoglucuronides and monosulfates were identified 
as metabolites in microsomal and cytosolic incubations, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: When consumed with the diet in mice tricin seems to be more 
available than apigenin in blood and tissues. Differences in their 
glucuronidation may account for their differential availability. Thus tricin may 
have a pharmacokinetic advantage over apigenin. This type of information may 
help decide which flavonoids to select for clinical development.

Although lettuce may provide relatively low levels of antioxidative 
phytochemicals which may contribute to human health, lettuce leaf extracts in 
fact contained compounds with high specific peroxyl radical scavenging 
activities. After determining the extraction conditions that minimized phenolic 
oxidation and produced the highest oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) 
values, the phenolic compounds from red leaf lettuce were separated by 
reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The primary 
phenolic compounds in the leaf tissue extracts were mono- and dicaffeoyltartaric 
acid (CTA and DCTA), mono- and dicaffeoylquinic acid (CQA and DCQA), quercetin 
3-malonylglucoside (QMG), quercetin 3-glucoside (QG), cyanidin 
3-malonylglucoside (CMG), and an unknown phenolic ester (UPE). Significant 
levels of DCQA were only found after wounding. Using the new fluorescein-based 
ORAC assay procedures, fractions from the HPLC analyses were assayed for peroxyl 
radical absorbance capacity. Using absorbance to estimate concentration, the 
decreasing order of contribution to the total ORAC value of an extract from 
wounded tissue was QMG > DCQA > CMG > DCTA > UPE > QG > CTA. The decreasing 
order of the specific peroxyl radical scavenging activities was CMG > QG > DCTA 
> DCQA > QMG > UPE > CQA > CTA. Since the concentrations of plant flavonoid and 
phenolic acid esters are sensitive to environmental factors, this information 
may be used to develop pre- and postharvest conditions which increase the 
dietary benefits of leaf lettuce.

BACKGROUND: Anthocyanins are potent antioxidants that are widely distributed in 
fruit, vegetables, and red wines. Anthocyanin products are also prescribed as 
medicines in many countries for treating various diseases. However, the 
pharmacokinetics of dietary anthocyanins are not known in humans because these 
glycosides were long considered nonabsorbable.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether anthocyanins can 
be absorbed as glycosides and to evaluate their pharmacokinetics in humans.
DESIGN: Four healthy elderly women consumed 720 mg anthocyanins. A series of 
blood and urine samples were collected before and after consumption of the 
anthocyanins. Anthocyanins were measured in plasma and urine by combining an 
octadecylsilane solid-phase extraction for sample preparation and an HPLC system 
with diode array for anthocyanin separation and detection. The structures of 
anthocyanins as glycosides in plasma and urine were further confirmed by using 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Anthocyanins were detected as glycosides in plasma and urine. The 
maximum plasma concentration of total anthocyanins varied from 55.3 to 168.3 
nmol/L, with an average of 97.4 nmol/L, and was reached within 71.3 min. The 
elimination of plasma anthocyanins appeared to follow first-order kinetics. The 
elimination half-life of plasma total anthocyanins was calculated to be 132.6 
min. Most anthocyanin compounds were excreted in urine during the first 4 h. The 
excretion rate of total anthocyanins was 77 microg/h during the first 4 h and 13 
microg/h during the second 4 h.
CONCLUSION: Anthocyanins are absorbed in their unchanged glycated forms in 
elderly women.

Oregano (Origanum vulgare L.) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) have long been 
known for their organoleptic properties. Both plants are widely used in cuisine 
worldwide in fresh and dried form and as a pharmaceutical raw material. The 
study aimed to assess if the type of cultivation influenced chosen chemical 
parameters (total polyphenols by Folin-Ciocalteu method; carotenoids and 
chlorophyll content by Lichtenthaler method), antimicrobial activity (with 
chosen reference microbial strains) and shaped cytotoxicity (with L929 mouse 
fibroblasts cell line) in water macerates of dry oregano and thyme. Polyphenols 
content and antimicrobial activity were higher in water macerates obtained from 
conventional cultivation (independently from herb species), unlike the pigments 
in a higher amount in macerates from organic herbs cultivation. Among all tested 
macerates stronger antimicrobial properties (effective in inhibiting the growth 
of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella enteritidis) and 
higher cytotoxicity (abilities to diminish the growth of L929 fibroblasts 
cytotoxicity) characterized the conventionally cultivated thyme macerate.

A capillary zone electrophoresis method has been carried out to determine and 
quantitate some compounds of the polyphenolic fraction of virgin olive oil which 
have never previously been determined before using capillary electrophoresis, 
such as elenolic acid, ligstroside aglycon, oleuropein aglycon, and 
(+)-pinoresinol. The compounds were identified using standards obtained by 
semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A detailed method 
optimization was performed to separate the phenolic compounds present in olive 
oil using a methanol-water extract of Picual extra-virgin olive oil, and 
different extraction systems were compared (C18-solid phase extraction (SPE), 
Diol-SPE, Sax-SPE and liquid-liquid extraction). The optimized parameters were 
30 mM sodium tetraborate buffer (pH 9.3) at 25 kV with 8 s hydrodynamic 
injection, and the quantitation was carried out by the use of two reference 
compounds at two different wavelengths.

The capabilities of spectrophotometric and electrochemical detection techniques 
were investigated for the high-performance liquid chromatographic determination 
of flavonoids. Liquid chromatographic analyses were performed on eleven 
compounds belonging to three different classes of flavonoids: flavanone 
glycosides, flavone and flavonol aglycones. Separation of all compounds examined 
was carried out under reversed-phase conditions on a C18 narrow-bore column for 
UV detection, whereas for electrochemical detection, a C18 standard-bore column 
was used. UV analyses were carried out at 280 nm for flavanones and at 265 nm 
for flavones and flavonols, whereas controlled-potential coulometric 
measurements were performed using a porous graphite electrode. Analytical 
performances of the methods were compared in terms of linearity, limits of 
detection (LODs) and precision. Linearity over two orders of magnitude and LODs 
at low-ppm levels (0.06-1 mg/l) were demonstrated for all techniques considered. 
Instrumental precision in terms of relative standard deviation was found to be 
between 0 and 5% for the liquid chromatography (LC)-UV system and between 0.6 
and 10% for the LC-electrochemical detection (ED) system. The methods developed 
were applied to the analysis of flavanones and flavonols in a real sample, such 
as an extract of orange juice. Even though quercetin glycoside is mostly present 
in orange juice as rutin, other different glycosides of this flavonol could be 
present; on this basis, the hydrolysis of all glycosides to aglycone allows one 
to obtain more accurate data on the flavonol concentration in orange juice. To 
avoid sample degradation and to increase extraction efficiency, quercetin 
hydrolysis was optimized using a central composite design to investigate the 
effects of acid concentration and hydrolysis time on extraction recovery.

The present study aims first to compare the antioxidant microconstituent 
contents between organically and conventionally grown tomatoes and, second, to 
evaluate whether the consumption of purees made of these tomatoes can 
differently affect the plasma levels of antioxidant microconstituents in humans. 
When results were expressed as fresh matter, organic tomatoes had higher vitamin 
C, carotenoids, and polyphenol contents (except for chlorogenic acid) than 
conventional tomatoes. When results were expressed as dry matter, no significant 
difference was found for lycopene and naringenin. In tomato purees, no 
difference in carotenoid content was found between the two modes of culture, 
whereas the concentrations of vitamin C and polyphenols remained higher in 
purees made out of organic tomatoes. For the nutritional intervention, no 
significant difference (after 3 weeks of consumption of 96 g/day of tomato 
puree) was found between the two purees with regard to their ability to affect 
the plasma levels of the two major antioxidants, vitamin C and lycopene.

High-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) coupled 
with electronspray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to detect the flavonoid 
profile in lemon juices obtained from the main Sicilian cultivars (Femminello 
comune, Monachello, and Interdonato). Significant amounts of an unusual 
constituent were found in the lemon juice of the above-mentioned cultivars 
together with eriocitrin, hesperidin, and diosmin. Following purification by 
preparative HPLC, the structure was assigned as 6,8-di-C-glucopyranosyldiosmetin 
by means of DAD-UV, ESI-MS-MS, and (1)H NMR analysis. Three other minor 
components were also detected. One of these presented a flavone nature, and 
spectral data and literature references both suggested a 
6,8-di-C-glucopyranosylapigenin structure. The different contents of eriocitrin, 
hesperidin, diosmin, and above minor components in the cultivars allow juices to 
be readily differentiated.

A clinical study was conducted to investigate the dose response and metabolism 
of strawberry anthocyanins. In a crossover study design, 12 healthy adults 
consumed each of 3 strawberry treatments. The treatments were 100 g, 200 g, and 
400 g of pureed strawberries, delivering 15 micromol, 30 micromol, and 60 
micromol anthocyanin, respectively. Urine samples were collected for 24 h after 
each dose and samples were analyzed by HPLC with diode array detection and ion 
trap MS. Pelargonidin 3-glucoside was the major anthocyanin form in the 
treatments, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside and 3 metabolites of pelargonidin 
3-glucoside (detected as monoglucuronides) were excreted in urine after 
ingestion. One predominant monoglucuronide form was detected in urine in masses 
10-fold higher than the other 2 monoglucuronide forms. Increasing dose resulted 
in increasing appearance of anthocyanins in urine, and the mass of each 
pelargonidin monoglucuronide increased in urine with increasing dose. These 
results suggest that pelargonidin 3-glucoside absorption and metabolism are not 
saturated at masses < or = 60 micromol, thus showing that more strawberry 
anthocyanin can be absorbed with increasing dose.

In this study the main chemical parameters, ascorbic acid and polyphenol 
content, and antioxidant activity of two varieties of prunes, dried by 
high-temperature (85 + 70 degrees C) and low-temperature (60 degrees C) 
procedures, were monitored during storage. Ascorbic acid content was higher in 
the prunes dried at 60 degrees C but significantly decreased in both varieties 
during storage. The different classes of polyphenols analyzed (cinnamates, 
anthocyanins, flavonols) showed different stabilities during storage. 
Neochlorogenic acid decreased only in the President variety, whereas chlorogenic 
acid increased in both varieties; anthocyanins, present only in the President 
prunes, disappeared in the first months of storage, and the flavonol content 
fell significantly in both cultivars during the year of the study. Drying 
temperature significantly affected the polyphenol content, with different 
effects according to the class of polyphenols. Antioxidant activity showed a 
significant increase at the end of the storage period and in the President 
variety was higher in the sample dried at the higher temperature.

Fourteen phenolic acids have been selectively determined in olive-oil samples 
using the co-electrosmotic capillary electrophoresis mode with UV detection 
after the LLE extraction system. A polycationic surfactant (hexadimetrine 
bromide, HDB), which dynamically coats the inner surface of the capillary and 
causes a fast anodic electroosmotic flow, was added to the electrolyte. The main 
factors affecting co-electroosmotic flow (EOF) such as type of modifier, 
concentration, and influence of organic solvents have been studied. Other 
parameters such as pH, type, and concentration of buffer, applied voltage, and 
injection time were also optimised using hydrodynamic injection for 8 s and UV 
detection at 210 nm. The composition optimum of the running buffer used was a 
20% 2-propanol, 0.001% HDB, and 50 mM sodium borate at a pH value of 9.6. The 
method has been applied to determination and quantification of fourteen phenolic 
acids at ppb levels in olive oil samples after a liquid-liquid extraction.

A rapid and reliable capillary zone electrophoresis method was used as a tool to 
obtain both qualitative and quantitative information about simple phenols, 
lignans, complex phenols (isomeric forms of secoiridoids), phenolic acids, and 
flavonoids in the solid-phase separation extracts from different Spanish 
extra-virgin olive oil in a short time (less than 6 min). Peak identification 
was done by using commercial and HPLC-isolated standards, studying the 
information of the electropherograms obtained at several wavelengths and also 
using the information previously reported. For the quantification of lignans and 
complex phenols (secoiridoid derivatives), we used a reference compound 
(oleuropein glucoside) at two different wavelengths (200 and 240 nm) and for the 
quantification of tyrosol and flavonoids, we used their commercially available 
standards.

In Asia, tea seed oils (seed oils from Camellia oleifera, C. chekiangoleosa, and 
C. sinensis) are used in edible, medicinal, and cosmetic applications. However, 
these oils differ in their fatty acid contents, and there is little known about 
their phenolic compounds. Here we analyzed the phenolic compounds of seed oils 
from three species gathered from 15 regions of China. Twenty-four phenolic 
compounds were characterized by HPLC-Q-TOF-MS, including benzoic acids (6), 
cinnamic acids (6), a hydroxyphenylacetic acid, flavanols (4), flavonols (3), 
flavones (2), and dihydroflavonoids (2). Some of these phenolic compounds had 
not previously been reported from C. sinensis (20), C. oleifera (15), and C. 
chekiangoleosa (24) seed oils. Quantification was done by HPLC-QqQ-MS using 24 
chemical standards. The total concentrations in the studied samples ranged from 
20.56 to 88.56μg/g. Phenolic acids were the most abundant class, accounting for 
76.2-90.4%, with benzoic acid, found at up to 18.87μg/g. The concentration of 
catechins, typical of tea polyphenols, ranged between 2.1% and 9.7%, while the 
other flavonoids varied from 4.2% to 17.8%. Although the cultivation region 
affected the phenolic composition of the Camellia seed oils, in our hierarchical 
clustering analysis, the samples clustered according to species. The phenolic 
composition of the seed oils from C. oleifera and C. chekiangoelosa were 
similar. We found that the phenolic categories in Camellia seed oils were 
similar to tea polyphenols, thereby identifying a source of liposoluble tea 
polyphenols and potentially accounting for some of the reported activities of 
these oils. In addition, this work provides basic data that allows distinction 
of various Camellia seed oils, as well as improvements to be made in their 
quality standards.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Punicalagin is an antioxidant ellagitannin of pomegranate 
juice. This compound is responsible for the high antioxidant activity of this 
juice. Nothing is known about the bioavailability and metabolism of punicalagin 
or other food ellagitannins. The present work aims to evaluate the 
bioavailability and metabolism of punicalagin in the rat as an animal model.
DESIGN: Two groups of rats were studied. One fed with standard rat diet (n = 5) 
and another with the same diet plus 6 % punicalagin (n = 5). Samples of urine 
and faeces were taken during 37 days and plasma every week. The different 
metabolites were analysed by HPLC-MS-MS.
RESULTS: The daily intake of punicalagin ranged from 0.6 to 1.2 g. Values around 
3-6 % the ingested punicalagin were excreted as identified metabolites in faeces 
and urine. In faeces, punicalagin is transformed to hydrolysis products and 
partly metabolites by the rat microflora to 6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one 
derivatives. In plasma, punicalagin was detected at concentrations around 30 
microg/mL, and glucuronides of methyl ether derivatives of ellagic acid were 
also detected. 6H-Dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one derivatives were also detected 
especially during the last few weeks of the experiment. In urine, the main 
metabolites observed were the 6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one derivatives, as 
aglycones or glucuronides.
CONCLUSION: As only 3-6 % of the ingested punicalagin was detected as such or as 
metabolites in urine and faeces, the majority of this ellagitannin has to be 
converted to undetectable metabolites (i. e. CO(2)) or accumulated in 
non-analysed tissues, however with only traces of punicalagin metabolites being 
detected in liver or kidney. This is the first report on the absorption of an 
ellagitannin and its presence in plasma. In addition, the transformation of 
ellagic acid derivatives to 6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one derivatives in the rat is 
also confirmed.

Ellagitannins (ETs) are dietary polyphenols, containing ellagic acid (EA) 
subunits, with antioxidant and cancer chemopreventive activities that might 
contribute to health benefits in humans. However, little is known about their 
metabolic fate. We investigate here the metabolism of different dietary ETs and 
EA derivatives in humans. Forty healthy volunteers were distributed in four 
groups. Each group consumed, in a single dose, a different ET-containing 
foodstuff, i.e., strawberries (250 g), red raspberries (225 g), walnuts (35 g), 
and oak-aged red wine (300 mL). After the intake, five urine fractions (F) were 
collected at 8 (F1), 16 (F2), 32 (F3), 40 (F4), and 56 (F5) h. Neither ETs nor 
EA were detected in urine after LC-MS/MS analysis. However, the microbial 
metabolite 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one (urolithin B) conjugated 
with glucuronic acid was detected along the fractions F3-F5 in all of the 
subjects, independently of the consumed foodstuff. The mean percentage of 
metabolite excretion ranged from 2.8 (strawberries) to 16.6% (walnuts) regarding 
the ingested ETs. Considerable interindividual differences were noted, 
identifying ""high and low metabolite excreters"" in each group, which supported 
the involvement of the colonic microflora in ET metabolism. These results 
indicate that urolithin B (a previously described antiangiogenic and 
hyaluronidase inhibitor compound) is a biomarker of human exposure to dietary 
ETs and may be useful in intervention studies with ET-containing products. The 
antioxidant and anticarcinogenic effects of dietary ETs and EA should be 
considered in the gastrointestinal tract whereas the study of potential systemic 
activities should be focused on the bioavailable urolithin B derivatives.

Stoichiometric and kinetic values of phenolics against DPPH 
(2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) were determined for Andean purple corn (Zea mays 
L.) and red sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas). Both crops had higher antioxidant 
capacity and antiradical kinetics than blueberries and higher or similar 
anthocyanin and phenolic contents. The second-order rate constant (k(2)) was 
1.56, 1.12, 0.57, and 0.26 (mg antiradical/mL)(-1) s(-1) for red sweetpotato, 
Trolox, purple corn, and blueberry, respectively. On the molar basis of active 
hydroxyl groups, k(2)' showed the same order as for k(2). Corn cob and 
sweetpotato endodermis contributed the most in phenolic compounds and 
antioxidant capacity. Both crops studied can be considered as excellent novel 
sources of natural antioxidants for the functional food and dietary supplement 
markets.

identified and quantified in two monovarietal champagnes, Chardonnay and Pinot 
Noir, by using a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
system coupled with diode array detection. The identification of four 
hydroxycinnamic tartaric esters (caftaric, coutaric, fertaric, and 
2-S-glutathionylcaftaric acids), two flavanonols (astilbin and engeletin), and 
some other compounds was confirmed by HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry. 
Caftaric acid and tyrosol were the major phenols. Hydroxybenzoic acids and 
flavonoids were present at low concentrations. The phenolic compositions of 2000 
and 2001 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir vary quantitatively according to the year and 
the variety, but the chemical natures of the molecules are the same. The total 
phenolic content determined by colorimetric measurement ranges from 176 to 195 
mg/L of gallic acid equivalent and is similar to that described in white wines.

The antioxidant potential of eight clingstone peach cultivars was investigated 
by determining phenolic compounds and inhibition of low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) oxidation. Cultivars low in polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were also selected to 
minimize enzymatic browning. Inhibition of LDL oxidation varied from 17.0 to 
37.1% in peach flesh extract, from 15.2 to 49.8% in whole peach extract, and 
from 18.2 to 48.1% in peel extract. Total phenols were 432.8-768.1 mg/kg in 
flesh extract, 483.3-803.0 mg/kg in whole extract, and 910.9-1922.9 mg/kg in 
peel extract. The correlation coefficient between relative LDL antioxidant 
activity and concentration of total phenols was 0.76. Peel PPO activity was 
higher than flesh activity in most cultivars. The lowest PPO and specific 
activities were found in the Walgant cultivar, followed by Kakamas and 18-8-23. 
These three cultivars combine the desirable characteristics of strong 
antioxidant activity, low PPO activity, and lower susceptibility to browning 
reactions.

Liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) 
with positive and negative ion detection was used for the identification of 
flavonoids in Hakmeitau beans, a black seed cultivar of cowpea (Vigna sinensis). 
Gradient elution with water and acetonitrile, both containing 2% formic acid, 
was employed in chromatographic separation. The peaks were identified by 
comparison of the retention times and the UV-vis spectroscopic and mass 
spectrometric data with authentic standards and/or literature data. The 
identified flavonoids included six anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-O-galactoside, 
cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, malvidin 3-O-glucoside, 
peonidin 3-O-glucoside, and petunidin 3-O-glucoside) and four flavonol/flavonol 
glycosides (kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, quercetin, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, and 
quercetin 3-O-6' '-acetylglucoside). The tentatively identified flavonoids 
included two anthocyanins (malvidin 3-O-acetylglucoside and peonidin 
3-O-malonylglucoside) and three flavonol glycosides (myricetin-3-O-glucoside, 
quercetin 7-O-glucoside, and quercetin-3-O-diglucoside). These flavonoids are 
present in seed coats, and the contents of anthocyanins and flavonol glycosides 
were 20.7 and 2.0 mg/g, respectively.

Nutritional compounds (phenolic compounds, L-ascorbic acid), antioxidant 
activities, and physicochemical characteristics (fruit weight, dry matter, 
soluble solids, pH, acidity, total and reducing sugars) of 33 different sour 
cherry cultivars were studied. Polyphenols were identified by LC-PDA-QTOF/MS and 
quantified by UPLC-PDA-FL. A total of 41 polyphenolic compounds found were 
identified and presented as 14 flavan-3-ols, 11 anthocyanins, 5 hydroxycinnamic 
acids, 10 flavonols, and 1 flavon. The content of total polyphenols (TPs) ranged 
from 2982.51 ('Wisok' cultivar) to 1539.43 mg/100 g dry weight ('Erdi 
Nagygyϋmϋscu'cultivar). Flavan-3-ols, the major class of sour cherry 
polyphenols, represented ∼ 40% of the TP compounds, whereas anthocyanins and 
hydroxycinnamic acids amounted for about 25% each. The content of l-ascorbic 
acid did not exceed 22.18 mg/100 g fresh matter. Some polish sour cherry 
cultivars (especially 'Agat', 'Ametyst', 'Wider', 'Winer', and 'Wisok') may be 
selected to promote the growth of cultivars with strong nutritional and 
phytochemical beneficial effects on human health.

Sour cherries fruits (Prunus cerasus L., syn P. cerasus var. austera) are 
locally known as ""visciola di Sezze"", due to the name of the city where they are 
traditionally cultivated in Lazio Region, Italy. Fruit samples from three 
harvesting years (June 2019, 2020 and 2021), were submitted to a protocol of 
analyses to detect the bioactive content based on year of harvest, freezing, 
homogenization and thermic treatments. Polyphenolic components, particularly 
anthocyanin compounds, were extracted, purified and analyzed by HPLC-DAD and 
DI-ESI-MS. An anthocyanin content between 0.24 and 21 mg/g fresh weight and a 
flavonols content between 0.04 and 0.2 mg/g fresh weight were found, depending 
on the harvest year and the applied procedures. Anthocyanins, besides being the 
principal components, were mainly represented by cyanidin-3-glucosyl-rutinoside 
(about 80%), a not particularly widespread molecule, mostly accounting for 
polyphenolic content. Color analysis and anti-radical activity of the different 
obtained extracts were performed with the aim to correlate organoleptic 
characters and health potential to the detected anthocyanins and flavanols 
content. Results show that immediate post-harvest freezing is the best way to 
preserve the bioactive content, the correlated color expression and anti-radical 
activity.

Recent studies indicate that anthocyanin intake conveys a variety of health 
benefits, which depend on absorption and metabolic mechanisms that deliver 
anthocyanins and their bioactive metabolites to responsive tissues. The 
anthocyanin bioavailability of red cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata) 
was evaluated as reflected by urinary excretion of anthocyanins and anthocyanin 
metabolites. Twelve volunteers consumed 100, 200, and 300 g of steamed red 
cabbage (containing 1.38 micromol of anthocyanins/g of cabbage) in a crossover 
design. Anthocyanin concentration in cabbage extract and urine was measured by 
HPLC-MS/MS. Six nonacylated and 30 acylated anthocyanins were detected in red 
cabbage, and 3 nonacylated anthocyanins, 8 acylated anthocyanins, and 4 
metabolites were present in urine. Mean 24 h excretion of intact anthocyanins 
increased linearly from 45 (100 g dose) to 65 nmol (300 g dose) for acylated 
anthocyanins and from 52 (100 g dose) to 79 nmol (300 g dose) for nonacylated 
anthocyanins. Urinary recovery of intact anthocyanins (percent of anthocyanin 
intake) decreased linearly from 0.041% (100 g dose) to 0.020% (300 g dose) for 
acylated anthocyanins and from 0.18% (100 g dose) to 0.09% (300 g dose) for 
nonacylated anthocyanins. Anthocyanin metabolites consisted of glucuronidated 
and methylated anthocyanins. The results show that red cabbage anthocyanins were 
excreted in both intact and metabolized forms and that recovery of nonacylated 
anthocyanins in urine was >4-fold that of acylated anthocyanins.

Absorption of cyanidin-based anthocyanins is not fully understood with respect 
to dose or anthocyanin structure. In feeding studies using whole foods, 
nonacylated anthocyanins are more bioavailable than their acylated counterparts, 
but the extent to which plant matrix determines relative bioavailability of 
anthocyanins is unknown. Using juice of purple carrots to circumvent matrix 
effects, a feeding trial was conducted to determine relative bioavailability of 
acylated and nonacylated anthocyanins and to assess dose-response effects. 
Appearance of anthocyanins in plasma was measured in 10 healthy adults for 8 h 
following consumption of purple carrot juice. Each subject consumed 50, 150, and 
250 mL of juice containing 76 micromol (65 mg), 228 micromol (194 mg), and 380 
micromol (323 mg) of total anthocyanins, respectively. Acylated anthocyanins 
comprised 76% of total anthocyanins in the juice, yet their bioavailability was 
found to be significantly less than that of nonacylated anthocyanins. Peak 
plasma concentrations of nonacylated anthocyanins were 4-fold higher than that 
for acylated anthocyanins. Absorption efficiency declined across the doses 
administered. Because the treatments were consumed as juice, it could be 
discerned that the difference in bioavailability of acylated versus nonacylated 
anthocyanins was not primarily caused by interactions with the plant matrix.

Understanding how the environment and production and cultivation practices 
influence the composition and quality of food crops is fundamental to the 
production of high-quality nutritious foods. In this 3-year study, total 
phenolics, percent soluble solids, ascorbic acid, and the flavonoid aglycones 
quercetin, kaempferol, and luteolin were measured in two varieties of tomato 
(Lycopersicon esculentum L. cv. Ropreco and Burbank) and two varieties of bell 
peppers (Capsicum annuum L. cv. California Wonder and Excalibur) grown by 
certified organic and conventional practices in a model system. Significantly 
higher levels of percent soluble solids (17%), quercetin (30%), kaempferol 
(17%), and ascorbic acid (26%) were found in Burbank tomatoes (fresh weight 
basis; FWB), whereas only levels of percent soluble solids (10%) and kaempferol 
(20%) were significantly higher in organic Ropreco tomatoes (FWB). Year-to-year 
variability was significant, and high values from 2003 influenced the 3-year 
average value of quercetin reported for organic Burbank tomatoes. Burbank 
tomatoes generally had higher levels of quercetin, kaempferol, total phenolics, 
and ascorbic acid as compared to Ropreco tomatoes. Bell peppers were influenced 
less by environment and did not display cropping system differences.

A HPLC method was developed for the separation and determination of flavonoid 
and phenolic antioxidants in cranberry juices. Free flavonoid and phenolic 
compounds were fractionated into neutral and acidic groups by means of a 
solid-phase extraction method, followed by subsequent HPLC separations. Combined 
flavonoids and phenolics were hydrolyzed by acid before HPLC analysis. This 
developed method provides a fast and high resolution of individual flavonoid and 
phenolic compounds. In cranberry fruit, flavonoids and phenolic acids exist 
predominantly in combined forms, such as glycosides and esters. A total of 400 
mg of total flavonoids and phenolic compounds/l of sample was found in a freshly 
squeezed cranberry juice, which was distributed as about 44% of phenolic acids 
and 56% of flavonoids. Benzoic acid was the major phenolic compound. Major 
flavonoids in the freshly squeezed cranberry juice were quercetin and myricetin.

In this work, liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem ion-trap mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) was used to investigate the in-vivo and in-vitro 
metabolism of tectoridin. After oral administration of a single dose (100 mg 
kg(-1)) of tectoridin to healthy rats, faeces and urine samples were collected 
for 0-48 h and 0-24 h, respectively. Tectoridin was also incubated with rat 
intestinal flora and rat liver microsomes. Samples from in-vivo and in-vitro 
metabolism studies were purified using a C(18) solid-phase extraction cartridge, 
then separated using a reverse-phase C(18) column with methanol/ water (30:70, 
v/v, adjusted to pH 10.0 with ammonia water) as mobile phase and detected by an 
on-line MS(n) system. The structure of the metabolites was elucidated by 
comparing their molecular weights, retention times and full-scan MS(n) spectra 
with those of the parent drug. The results revealed six metabolites of 
tectoridin in urine (tectorigenin, hydrogenated tectorigenin, mono-hydroxylated 
tectorigenin, di-hydroxylated tectorigenin, glucuronide-conjugated tectorigenin 
and sulfate-conjugated tectorigenin); three metabolites in faeces (tectorigenin, 
di-hydroxylated tectorigenin and sulfateconjugated tectorigenin); one metabolite 
in the intestinal flora incubation mixture (tectorigenin), and four in the liver 
microsomal incubation mixture (tectorigenin, hydrogenated tectorigenin, 
mono-hydroxylated tectorigenin and di-hydroxylated tectorigenin). Except for 
tectorigenin, all other metabolites of tectoridin are reported for the first 
time.

Peanuts are consumed mostly as processed products. Although the effect of 
processing on isoflavone composition of legumes has been extensively studied, 
there has been no such study on peanuts. The objective of this study was to 
evaluate the effect of processing (boiling, oil- and dry-roasting) on the 
phytochemical composition of peanuts. Boiling had a significant effect on the 
phytochemical composition of peanuts compared to oil- and dry-roasting. Boiled 
peanuts had the highest total flavonoid and polyphenol content. The biochanin A 
and genistein content of boiled peanut extracts were two- and fourfold higher, 
respectively. trans-Resveratrol was detected only in the boiled peanuts, with 
the commercial product having a significantly (p < or = 0.05) higher 
concentration. Ultraviolet and mass spectrometry chromatograms for the boiled 
peanut extracts show the presence of four additional peaks that were not 
observed in the raw peanut extracts.

Peanuts have been reported to contain bioactive phytochemicals, particularly 
isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, and biochanin A) and trans-resveratrol. 
Currently, limited data are available regarding the levels of these bioactive 
compounds in peanuts with variations in reported levels. The purpose of this 
study was to compare four methods of extraction [stirring, sonication, Soxtec, 
and microwave-assisted sonication (MAS)] for runner peanuts. Quantification of 
the selected compounds was conducted by reverse-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography (RP-HPLC). The results showed that the MAS and Soxtec methods 
extracted significantly higher amounts of the phytochemicals. Also, the defatted 
peanuts gave significantly higher amounts of the phytochemicals compared to the 
nondefatted peanuts. The high levels of the isoflavones may be attributed to 
heat-induced conversion of conjugate glycosides to aglycons. The MAS and Soxtec 
methods may be used for total isoflavone content quantitation, while sonication 
or stirring may be the method of choice for quantitation of isoflavone 
composition (aglycons and glycoside conjugates) in peanuts.

The effect of polyphenols among different varieties of plums on superoxide 
radical scavenging activity (SRSA) was studied by an enzymatic method and their 
IC(50) values were determined. We found that the SRSA levels of the polyphenols 
were closely related to their chemical structures; cyanidin showed the lowest 
IC(50) among the polyphenols examined, and aglycones are more effective than 
their glycosides. BY 69-339 cultivar exhibited the lowest IC(50) among the 
eleven plum cultivars, which means the highest antioxidant activity in 
scavenging superoxide radicals, followed by French Damson, Cacaks Best, 
Beltsville Elite B70197, Empress, Castleton, Stanley, NY 6, NY 101, Mirabellier, 
and NY 9. IC(50) values showed a higher correlation with total flavonoids (r (2) 
= 0.8699) than total phenolics (r (2) = 0.8355), which indicated that flavonoids 
might contribute to the total SRSA more directly than other polyphenols. 
Anthocyanins in plums appeared to be the major contributors to the total SRSA, 
except for two yellow cultivars having no anthocyanins. Chlorogenic acid was the 
predominant phenolic acid, and it also exhibited SRSA significantly in the range 
of 1.0 to 94.9%. Quercetins were the major flavonols in plums. However, they 
showed relatively low contribution to the total SRSA.

Determination of unusual soya and non-soya phytoestrogen sources in beer, fish

Fish and fish products (14 samples), Indian foods and meals (10 samples), spices 
(30 samples) and beers (10 samples) were analysed for their phytoestrogen 
content, and a number of significant non-soya sources of dietary phytoestrogens 
were identified. No isoflavones were detected in unprocessed, farmed or ocean 
fish, but some samples of processed fish products contained soya isoflavones, 
which are assumed to come from coatings or protein addition. Additionally, some 
processed fish products contained, genistein glycocongugates not derived from 
soya. Genistein was detected in Indian meals such that, for example, a single 
portion of a vindalooo curry contained 11 mg genistein. The origin was most 
likely from the spices used, since the analysis of curry powders, chilli powder, 
crushed red chillies, garam masala and tandoori powder revealed that some 
contained genistein at more than 100 mg kg(-1). Cumin was the most likely source 
material, although not all individual samples of cumin tested contained high 
levels of genistein. Prenylnaringenin phytoestrogens were determined in UK 
hop-based beers at mean concentrations of 0.21 mg(-1) 6-prenylnaringenin and 
0.06mg(-1) 8-prenylnaringenin. The beers also contained traces of daidzein, 
genistein and biochanin A. The significance of 'hidden soya' in processed foods 
and these non-soya sources of phytoestrogens is that UK dietary intake of 
phytoestrogens must be assumed to be higher than estimated previously and that 
some sources of phytoestrogens remain poorly characterized.

Phenolic acids (chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic, ellagic, and 
syringic acid) as well as syringaldehyde and juglone were identified in ripe 
fruits of 10 walnut cultivars: Adams, Cisco, Chandler, Franquette, Lara, Fernor, 
Fernette, Alsoszentivani 117 (A-117), Rasna, and Elit. Analyses were done using 
a high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a diode array detector. 
Significant differences in the contents of identified phenolics were observed 
among cultivars. Phenolics were determined separately in the kernel and in the 
thin skin of the walnut, termed the pellicle. Not only in the kernel but also in 
the pellicle did syringic acid, juglone, and ellagic acid predominate (average 
values of 33.83, 11.75, and 5.90 mg/100 g of kernel; and 1003.24, 317.90, and 
128.98 mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively), and the contents of ferulic and 
sinapic acid (average values of 0.06 and 0.05 mg/100 g of kernel and 2.93 and 
2.17 mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively) were the lowest in all cultivars. The 
highest differences in the sum of all identified phenolics were observed between 
Rasna and Fernette fruits; in Rasna there were >2-fold higher contents of 
identified phenolics in both kernel and pellicle. It was found that the walnut 
pellicle is the most important source of walnut phenolics. The ratio between the 
contents in pellicle and kernel varied by at least 14.8-fold for caffeic acid 
(cv. Adams) and by up to 752.0-fold for p-coumaric acid (cv. Elit).

Biotransformation of the phytoestrogen [14C]genistein was investigated in male 
and female rats by application of narrow-bore radio-HPLC-MSn (LCQ, Finnigan) to 
determine intermediates in metabolism. Urine contained five metabolites, 
Gm1-Gm5, 24 h after dosing by gavage with [14C]genistein (4 mg kg(-1)). 
Structural analysis following ESI revealed molecular ions [M+H]+ of m/z 447, 
449, 273, and 271 for metabolites Gm2, Gm3, Gm5 and genistein, respectively and 
an [M-H]- of m/z 349 for Gm4. Metabolite structure was deduced by evaluation of 
product ion spectra derived from unlabelled and [14C]-labelled ions and 
sensitivity to treatment with beta-glucuronidase. These studies indicated 
identity of metabolites with genistein glucuronide (Gm2), dihydrogenistein 
glucuronide (Gm3), genistein sulphate (Gm4) and dihydrogenistein (Gm5). 
Detection of the beta-glucuronidase resistant major metabolite Gm1 by ESI was 
poor and so was analysed by negative ion APCI; this revealed a deprotonated 
molecular ion of m/z 165 which had chromatographic and mass spectral properties 
consistent with authentic 4-hydroxyphenyl-2-propionic acid, a novel metabolite 
of genistein. In vitro metabolism studies with anaerobic caecal cultures derived 
from male and female rats revealed metabolism of genistein to Gm1 via Gm5 and an 
additional metabolite (Gm6) which was identified from product ion spectra as 
6'-hydroxy-O-desmethylangolensin. Biotransformation of genistein by both 
isolated hepatocytes and precision-cut liver slices was limited to 
glucuronidation of parent compound. Commonality of genistein metabolites found 
in rats with those reported in man suggest similar pathways of 
biotransformation, primarily involving gut micro-flora.

Chocolate and other cocoa-containing products are a rich source of polyphenols. 
This paper describes an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) method 
that can separate and quantify in 3 min six of the major chocolate polyphenols: 
catechin; epicatechin; B2 (epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin); B5 
(epicatechin-4beta-6-epicatechin); C1 
(epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin); and tetramer D 
(epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin). A 
survey of 68 chocolate samples indicated that there was a strongly predictive 
relationship between epicatechin and the other individual polyphenols, 
especially procyanidin B2 (R 2 = 0.989), even though the chocolates came from 
varied sources and manufacturers. The relationship was less strong with 
catechin, and so further work to explore the reasons for this difference was 
performed. Chiral analysis on a subset of 23 chocolates showed that 
(-)-epicatechin had a predictive relationship with (+)-catechin in line with the 
other polyphenols, but not with (-)-catechin (the predominant form). This 
indicates that (-)-catechin is the most affected by manufacturing conditions, 
possibly formed through epimerization from (-)-epicatechin during processing. 
The results show that epicatechin concentrations can be used to predict the 
content of other polyphenols, especially B2 and C1, and total polyphenols 
content. Finally, the (-)-catechin content is not predictable from the 
epicatechin content, and it is concluded that this is the main form of 
polyphenol that varies according to manufacturing conditions and cocoa origin.

The validation of a HPTLC-densitometric method for the determination of 
secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) in flaxseed was performed improving the 
reproducibility of a previously reported HPTLC densitometric procedure by the 
use of fully wettable reversed phase plates (silica gel 60 RP18W F(254S), 
10cmx10cm) with MeOH:HCOOH 0.1% (40:60, v/v) mobile phase. The analysis required 
only the alkaline hydrolysis in aqueous medium of undefatted samples and 
densitometry at 282nm of HPTLC runs. The method was validated following the 
protocol proposed by the Société Francaise des Sciences et Techniques 
Pharmaceutiques (SFSTP) giving rise to a dependable and high throughput 
procedure well suited to routine application. SDG was quantified in the range of 
321-1071ng with RSD of repeatability and intermediate precision not exceeding 
3.61% and accuracy inside the acceptance limits. Flaxseed of five cultivars of 
different origin was elected as test-bed.

Six strawberry cultivars grown on the same commercial plantation in Brazil were 
evaluated for their chemical composition and quality attributes at the ripe 
stage. The profiles of the main soluble sugars, ascorbic acid, and anthocyanins 
were also obtained during the developmental stages. Results showed significant 
differences among cultivars in all of the investigated parameters. Cv. 
Campineiro showed an average value for texture of 0.63 N, half the value found 
for cv. Oso Grande. Anthocyanin content ranged from 13 (cv. Campineiro) to 55 
(cv. Mazi) mg/100 g. Total ascorbic acid found for cv. Campineiro (85 mg/100 g) 
was twice the amount found in cv. Dover (40 mg/100 g). Fructose was the 
predominant soluble sugar in almost all cultivars. The proportion among the main 
soluble sugars (fructose, sucrose, and glucose) was similar for Oso Grande and 
Toyonoka cultivars. The flavonol content (quercetin plus kaempferol derivatives) 
ranged from 2.7 to 7.1 mg/100 g, with a mean value of 6.1 mg/100 g, whereas free 
ellagic acid ranged from 0.9 to 1.9 and total phenolics varied from 159 to 289 
(mean 221) mg/100 g.

BACKGROUND: The assessment of the relative contribution of genotype, environment 
and the genotype-by-environmental (G × E) interaction to the performance of 
varieties is necessary when determining adaptation capacity.
RESULTS: The influence of temperature, ultraviolet (UV)-irradiation and sunshine 
duration on the quality and the composition of fruits was investigated in nine 
strawberry cultivars grown at three different altitudes. The UV-radiation 
intensity affected both pH and sugar content, which were higher for most of the 
varieties at low altitudes, whereas total titratable acidity was less. Fruits 
from plants grown at low elevation generally had a higher benzoic acid 
derivative content. A significant correlation was found between phenylpropanoid 
content and UV-radiation and sunshine duration. The flavone class appeared to be 
affected most by the variety effect, in contrast to flavonols and ellagitannins, 
which were highly affected by the environment. The accumulation of a number of 
secondary metabolites in strawberry fruits grown in an unusual environmental 
condition highlighted the acclimation effects in terms of the response of plants 
to abiotic stress. Finally, the genetic factor only appears to be more 
influential for the varieties 'Sveva' and 'Marmolada' with respect to all of the 
parameters considered.
CONCLUSION: A 'plant environmental metabolomics' approach has been used 
successfully to assess the phenotypic plasticity of varieties that showed 
different magnitudes with respect to the relationship between environmental 
conditions and the accumulation of healthy compounds. © 2017 Society of Chemical

Simultaneous determination of alcohols, amines, amino acids, flavonoids, and 
purine and pyrimidine bases in bottled beer samples directly without any 
pre-treatment was carried out by capillary zone electrophoresis with diode-array 
detection. Electrolyte conditions such as pH, composition and concentration of 
the buffer, working voltage and type and time of injection were checked. The 
best separation of the cited analytes was achieved in 70 mM sodium borate 
solution and pH 10.25. The detection limits were from 2.1 to 5.6 mg L(-1) for 
the 18 compounds studied. The developed method is rapid, sensitive and 
quantitative and has been applied to seven types of international bottled beers 
of different origins bought locally.

Human bioavailability of the flavonoid dihydrochalcones is little understood, 
and no evidence exists for C-glycosyl flavonoid absorption in humans. The 
present study uses catechol-O-methyltransferase to generate methylated 
metabolites of aspalathin (a C-glycosyl dihydrochalcone from rooibos tea). One 
of the methylated forms, both with and without glucuronidation, was detected 
using LC-MS/MS in the urine of human subjects (n = 6), demonstrating that 
deglycosylation is not a prerequisite for C-glycosyl flavonoid absorption. 
Methylation is catalysed by both intestine and liver cytosolic extracts. The 
results show that flavonoid C-glycosides are methylated and glucuronidated in 
vivo in an intact form in humans.

Noncovalent complexes were used for structural determination and isomer 
differentiation of flavonoid glucuronides. Several flavonoid glucuronides 
including naringenin-7-O-glucuronide, synthesized here for the first time, were 
used as test compounds. Electrospray ionization quadrupole ion trap mass 
spectrometry with collision-induced dissociation (CID) was used to analyze 
complexes of the form [Co(II) (L-H) (Aux)]+ and [Co(II) (L-H) (Aux)2]+, in which 
L is the flavonoid glucuronide and Aux is a phenanthroline-based ligand. These 
complexes yielded characteristic fragmentation patterns that facilitated 
assignment of the substitution position of the glucuronides. The methods were 
adapted to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with 
postcolumn cobalt complexation and were tested on extracts from biological 
fluids. The metabolites naringenin-7-O-glucuronide and 
naringenin-4'-O-glucuronide were detected in human urine following the 
consumption of grapefruit juice. Isomeric quercetin glucuronides were identified 
and differentiated after spiking rat plasma at the 1 microM level, proving that 
the new methods are effective at biologically relevant concentrations.

A LC-MS method was developed for the determination of coumarin, vanillin, and 
ethyl vanillin in vanilla products. Samples were analyzed using LC-electrospray 
ionization (ESI)-MS in the positive ionization mode. Limits of detection for the 
method ranged from 0.051 to 0.073 microg mL(-1). Using the optimized method, 24 
vanilla products were analyzed. All samples tested negative for coumarin. 
Concentrations ranged from 0.38 to 8.59 mg mL(-1) (x =3.73) for vanillin and 
0.33 to 2.27 mg mL(-1) (x =1.03) for ethyl vanillin. The measured concentrations 
are compared to values calculated using UV monitoring and to results reported in 
a similar survey in 1988. Analytical results, method precision, and accuracy 
data are presented.

The phytochemical profiles (total phenolics, anthocyanins, ferulic acid, 
carotenoids) and antioxidant activities of five types of corn (white, yellow, 
high carotenoid, blue, and red) processed into masa, tortillas, and tortilla 
chips were studied. The nixtamalization process significantly (p < 0.05) reduced 
total phenolics and antioxidant activities when compared to raw grains. 
Nixtamalized grains exhibited higher concentration of free phenolics and soluble 
conjugated ferulic acid and had lower concentrations of bound phenolics and 
ferulic acid than unprocessed grains. Among processed products, there was little 
difference in the phytochemical contents and antioxidant activities. Among types 
of corn, the highest concentrations of total phenolics, ferulic acid, and 
antioxidant activity were observed in the high-carotenoid genotype followed by 
the regular yellow counterpart. The white corn contained the lowest amount of 
total phenolics and antioxidant activity. The pigmented blue corn had the 
highest anthocyanin concentration followed by the red counterpart. These 
findings suggest that lime-cooking significantly reduced the phytochemical 
content of nixtamalized products but released phenolics and ferulic acid.

A simple and reproducible method for qualitative and quantitative analysis of 
phenolic compounds in virgin olive oils by solid-phase extraction (SPE), high 
performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), and 
HPLC-mass spectrometry (MS) in tandem mode was developed. The polar fraction was 
obtained from samples of three different virgin olive oils. Detection and 
quantification were performed at 280, 240, and 320 nm. For identification 
purposes, HPLC-MS/MS was equipped with turbo ion spray source in the 
negative-ion mode. Twenty compounds of twenty-three detected and quantified were 
characterized. The method showed satisfactory linearity (r > 0.99), good 
recovery, satisfactory precision, and appropriate limits of detection (LOD) and 
quantification (LOQ).

In human LDL, the bioactivity of olive oil phenols is determined by the in vivo 
disposition of the biological metabolites of these compounds. Here, we examined 
how the ingestion of 2 similar olive oils affected the content of the metabolic 
forms of olive oil phenols in LDL in men. The oils differed in phenol 
concentrations as follows: high (629 mg/L) for virgin olive oil (VOO) and null 
(0 mg/L) for refined olive oil (ROO). The study population consisted of a 
subsample from the EUROLIVE study and a randomized controlled, crossover design 
was used. Intervention periods lasted 3 wk and were preceded by a 2-wk washout 
period. The levels of LDL hydroxytyrosol monosulfate and homovanillic acid 
sulfate, but not of tyrosol sulfate, increased after VOO ingestion (P < 0.05), 
whereas the concentrations of circulating oxidation markers, including oxidized 
LDL (oxLDL), conjugated dienes, and hydroxy fatty acids, decreased (P < 0.05). 
The levels of LDL phenols and oxidation markers were not affected by ROO 
consumption. The relative increase in the 3 LDL phenols was greater when men 
consumed VOO than when they consumed ROO (P < 0.05), as was the relative 
decrease in plasma oxLDL (P = 0.001) and hydroxy fatty acids (P < 0.001). Plasma 
oxLDL concentrations were negatively correlated with the LDL phenol levels (r = 
-0.296; P = 0.013). Phenols in LDL were not associated with other oxidation 
markers. In summary, the phenol concentration of olive oil modulates the 
phenolic metabolite content in LDL after sustained, daily consumption. The 
inverse relationship of these metabolites with the degree of LDL oxidation 
supports the in vivo antioxidant role of olive oil phenolics compounds.

Trypsin inhibitors (TI), tannins, and lectins appear to have a role in 
preventing chronic diseases in humans. The genetic variability of these traits 
in common bean needs to be ascertained in order to increase levels through 
breeding. The variability of TI, tannin, and lectins was determined in five bean 
cultivars grown at five locations in Mexico. TI and tannins contents in colored 
beans that belong to the Jalisco race were higher (11.1-11.9 trypsin units 
inhibited (TUI)/mg and 29.0-38.1 mg catechin equivalent (CE)/g, respectively) 
than cultivars of the Durango race (7.9-8.3 TUI/mg and 16.8-19.9 CE/mg, 
respectively). Bayo Victoria, a Durango race cultivar, had three times more 
lectins than levels reported for soybean. Cultivar influenced TI and tannins 
contents (p < 0.001), whereas site affected lectins (p < 0.001). An increase in 
levels of TI and tannins could be enhanced through breeding.

A rapid HPLC-diode array detection (DAD) method was developed for the routine 
analysis of 16 anthocyanins in wine. Direct injection of filtered wine samples 
followed by selective detection at 520 nm allowed quantitation of these 
compounds in red wines. The method was linear for malvidin-3-glucoside over the 
range 5-250ppm, and the limit of detection for this compound was 0.18 ppm. A 
volatile mobile phase is used, which enables hyphenation to mass spectrometry 
(MS). With HPLC-MS, a total of 44 pigments could be identified in South African 
wines. Obtained mass spectra are discussed for a series of representative wine 
constituents and results are compared with literature references. An attempt was 
made to differentiate between different cultivars according to the anthocyanin 
content using stepwise forward linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

The effect of wild blueberry consumption on anthocyanin (ACNs) distribution and 
metabolism in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was investigated. Thirty-two rats were 
fed for 4 or 8 weeks with a control (C) or a wild blueberry-enriched diet (8%) 
(WB). Anthocyanin profile in plasma, urine, feces, brain, and liver was 
evaluated by LC-MS/MS, and significantly increased in urine and not in feces 
after 8 weeks on the WB diet compared to that in 4 weeks, but no anthocyanins 
were detected in plasma, liver, and brain samples either in the C or WB groups. 
Metabolites of ACNs were detected in the plasma, urine, feces, and tissues of 
both the C and WB groups, but the urinary excretion of hippuric acid increased 
significantly after 4 and 8 weeks of WB consumption. Thus, it seems that ACNs 
are metabolized by the intestinal microflora to respective phenyl-alkyl acids, 
which can be further metabolized to benzoic acid. In conclusion, ACNs are 
bioavailable in rats, and the extent of their metabolism and excretion is based 
on diet duration. Additionally, urinary hippuric acid content could represent a 
potential biomarker of ACNs absorption and metabolism in the SD rat under the 
present experimental conditions.

We describe a liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation tandem mass 
spectrometry method for the qualitative and quantitative determination of the 
secoiridoid oleuropein and its bioactive metabolite hydroxytyrosol in rat plasma 
and urine. Samples were prepared by liquid-liquid extraction using ethyl acetate 
with a recovery for both compounds of about 100% in plasma and about 60% in 
urine. The chromatographic separation was performed with a RP-ODS column using a 
water-acetonitrile linear gradient. The calibration curve was linear for both 
biophenols over the range 2.5-1000 ng/ml (LOD 1.25 ng/ml) for plasma and 5-1000 
ng/ml (LOD 2.5 ng/ml) for urine. Plasma concentrations of oleuropein and 
hydroxytyrosol were measured after oral administration of a single dose (100 
mg/kg) of oleuropein. Analysis of treated rat plasma showed the presence of 
unmodified oleuropein, reaching a peak value of 200 ng/ml within 2 h, with a 
small amount of hydroxytyrosol, whereas in urine, both compounds were mainly 
found as glucuronides.

White, blue, red and purple corns (Zea mays L.) were lime-cooked to obtain masa 
for tortillas. The total phenolics and anthocyanins content, antioxidant 
activity expressed as total reducing power (TRP), peroxyl radical bleaching 
(PRAC), total antioxidant activity (TAA) and quinone reductase (QR) induction in 
the murine hepatoma (Hepa 1 c1c7 cell line) as a biological marker for phase II 
detoxification enzymes were investigated. Among the extracts prepared from raw 
corn varieties the highest concentration of total phenolics, anthocyanins, 
antioxidant index and induction of QR-inducing activity were found in the 
Veracruz 42 (Ver 42) genotype. The nixtamalization process (masa) reduced total 
phenolics, anthocyanins and antioxidant activities and the ability for QR 
induction when was compared to raw grain. Processing masa into tortillas also 
negatively affected total phenolics, anthocyanin concentration, antioxidant 
activities, and QR induction in the colored corn varieties. The blue variety and 
its corresponding masa and tortillas did not induce QR. Ver 42 genotype and 
their products (masa and tortilla) showed the greatest antioxidant activity and 
capacity to induce QR.

Determination of free phenolic compounds in potato samples was optimized using a 
high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with on-line diode array 
detection. This method was applied to samples of four cultivars of potatoes 
harvested in Tenerife (Canary Islands). The free phenolic compounds found in the 
potato samples were (+)-catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric 
acid, and ferulic acid. Potato samples belonging to Colorada cultivar, ssp. 
andigena, had mean concentrations of total phenolic compounds and chlorogenic 
acid higher than those found for Kerr's Pink and Cara cultivars, ssp. tuberosum, 
and for Negra cultivar, S. x chaucha. In contrast, p-coumaric acid was not 
detected in any potato samples of the Colorada cultivar. Traditional potatoes 
presented a higher mean concentration of ferulic acid than recently imported 
potatoes. A significant and negative correlation was established between 
(+)-catechin and p-coumaric acid. A considerable contribution to the daily 
intake of flavonoids was observed with the actual consumption of potatoes.

Common bean effects on health have been related to its dietary fiber content and 
other active compounds. This study assessed the content of flavonoids, 
coumestrol, phenolic acids, galactooligosaccharides, and phytic acid in wild and 
cultivated Mexican common bean seeds (raw and cooked) and that of flavonoids, 
coumestrol, and phenolic acids in germinated bean seeds. The presence of 
isoflavones in raw bean seeds was not confirmed by the UV spectra. Quercetin, 
kaempferol, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and vanillic 
acid mean contents were 10.9, 52.3, 10.1, 9.6, 5.4, and 18.2 microg/g, 
respectively; raffinose, stachyose, verbascose, and phytic acid mean contents 
were 8.5, 56.3, 5.5, and 11.5 mg/g, respectively, in raw seeds. All compounds 
were affected by autoclaving, and germination resulted in a de novo synthesis of 
flavonols, phytoestrogens, and phenolic acids. The impact on health of common 
bean seed is affected by dietary burden, specific compounds content, and 
processing. On the other hand, germinated bean seed or beans sprouts may be 
sources of antioxidants and phytoestrogens.

In this work, a new CE method with diode array detection (DAD) was developed for 
the monitoring and quantitation of flavonoids in different beans treated and 
untreated with UV-B radiation. Flavonoid concentration was monitored in 
UV-B-treated and untreated sprouts of three common beans (Zolfino ecotype, cv. 
Verdone, cv. Lingua di Fuoco) and one soybean (cv. Pacific). After acid 
hydrolysis of extracts, the CE-DAD method provides reproducible quantitative 
determinations of daidzein, glycitein, genistein, and kaempferol at ppm level in 
these natural matrices within a relatively short time (less than 16 min). Total 
flavonoid content determined by CE-DAD was 159 +/- 8, 26 +/- 2, 13 +/- 1, and 
1.3 +/- 0.3 microg/g fresh weight for untreated sprouts of Pacific soybean, 
Verdone bean, Zolfino bean, and Lingua di Fuoco bean, respectively. UV-B 
treatment caused no significant quantitative effect on Pacific soybean sprouts, 
whereas it enhanced the total isoflavone content by 1.5, 1.8, and 3.2-fold in 
Verdone, Zolfino, and Lingua di Fuoco beans, respectively. The proposed method 
shows (i) the potentialities of bean sprouts as a natural source of bioactive 
compounds (antioxidants); (ii) the technological role of UV-B treatment for 
sprout isoflavone enrichment; and (iii) the good capabilities of CE-DAD to 
monitor this process.

Column liquid chromatography on a C18-bonded silica column with 
water-methanol-acetic acid as eluent was used to determine polyphenols and 
caffeine in tea. Without any pretreatment, catechin, epicatechin gallate, 
epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epicatechin and caffeine were 
separated successfully within 15 min. The detection limits (S/N = 3) of 
polyphenols studied were 1.8-24 mg/l at a detection wavelength 270 nm. The 
linear range of the peak area calibration curves for the analytes were over two 
orders of magnitude with a correlation coefficient of 0.996-0.999. Using this 
method, some Chinese tea samples were analyzed with a good reproducibility (RSD

The possibility of proving the undeclared addition of pumpkin puree in apricot 
nectars and jams has been investigated by using the phenol compound fingerprint 
and sensory evaluation. The cheaper pumpkin admixtures in apricot nectars and 
jams could not be detected by the sensory evaluation, particularly if present in 
quantities of <15%. The lower admixtures of pumpkin puree in apricot nectars and 
jams could be detected by the presence of syringic acid, a phenolic compound 
characteristic of the investigated pumpkins (Cucurbita pepo cv. Gleisdorff and 
Table Gold, Cucurbita maxima cv. Turkinja, and Cucurbita moschata cv. Argenta). 
Syringic acid was isolated from pumpkin puree and determined by using HPLC with 
diode array detection. By using the phenolic profile, undeclared pumpkin 
admixture (> or =5%) in the apricot nectars and jams could be proven.

(Pisum sativum L.).

BACKGROUND: Consumption of pulse crops, including field pea, is considered 
effective for a healthy diet. Hulls (seed coats) play an important role for 
protection of the cotyledon and embryo, but also as mediating positive effects 
on health outcomes. The biochemical attributes of field pea hulls were thus 
assessed to determine the occurrence of specific phytochemicals and their 
genotypic variability.
RESULTS: Sequestered bioproducts in mature hulls predominantly consisted of 
trans-lutein and chlorophylls a and b. Trace amounts of other carotenoid and 
pheophytin metabolites were identified. In developing hulls, violaxanthin, 
neoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, chlorophylls a and b and β-carotene were 
detected. Genotypic differences in the accumulation of lutein and chlorophylls a 
and b were observed over years and locations. Polyphenolics and hydroxybenzoic 
acids were detected in the 'dun' and 'maple' field pea types-the only genotypes 
to have pigmented hulls. Unextractable patches of condensed tannin influenced 
the visual uniformity of the maple and dun genotypes, CDC Rocket and CDC 
Dundurn.
CONCLUSIONS: Within the yellow and green market classes, carotenoid and 
chlorophyll accumulation was consistent. Green cotyledon varieties sequestered 
higher concentrations of lutein than the yellow cotyledon varieties. Maple and 
dun types were more variable, reflective of different selection criteria. The 
occurrence of flavonoid-related compounds was correlated only with pigmented 
seed coat genotypes. The dietary potential of the chlorophylls and carotenoids 
that accumulated in the hulls split from the green and yellow field pea types is 
discussed as a value-added prospect in food supplements.

Anthocyanins and derived components of red wines were determined by microHPLC 
using a 1 mm ID HPLC column coupled on-line with an MS detector equipped with an 
ESI (ElectroSpray Ionisation) source. The use of microcolumn HPLC greatly 
enhanced detection performance, allowing direct identification of components 
present in the fraction. Nineteen anthocyanins were detected. Fifteen were 
identified, two were tentatively identified, and only the aglycon of the 
remaining two components was certainly identified. Six anthocyanin-derived 
pigments, supposedly formed during wine maturation, were also investigated and 
found in a wine sample. The analysis of red wine anthocyanins was also carried 
out by injecting a large sample volume onto a 0.32 mm ID HPLC column, using the 
column focusing technique, in order to decrease the limit of detection and 
quantification of components present in a very small amounts.

Four high yielding and early maturing cultivars of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) 
namely UPAS-120, ICPL-87, ICPL-151 and, especially, Manak, contained significant 
amounts of polyphenols (1075 to 1328 mg/100g), which may limit their 
utilization. The effectiveness of soaking (6, 12 and 18 h, 30 degrees C), 
soaking and dehulling, ordinary cooking, pressure cooking and germination (24, 
36, 48 h, 30 degrees C) in reducing the levels of polyphenols was investigated. 
A decrease in the polyphenolic contents varying from 4 to 26 percent in 
different pigeon pea cultivar was achieved. Pressure cooking of soaked-dehulled 
seeds was found to be the most effective method, followed by sprouting for 48 h, 
ordinary cooking of soaked-dehulled seeds, and pressure cooking of soaked whole 
seeds followed by sprouting for 36 h.

Eight varieties of lettuce (Lactuca sativum) and three varieties of endive 
(Cichorium endivia) were analyzed for flavonoid composition and content. Total 
flavonoid contents, expressed as units of aglycon for fresh material, were in 
the ranges of 0.3-229 microg/g for lettuce and 44-248 microg/g for endive. Five 
quercetin conjugates [quercetin 3-O-galactoside, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, 
quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, quercetin 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside, and quercetin 
3-O-rhamnoside] and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide were measured in the green-leafed 
lettuce and an additional two cyanidin conjugates [cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and 
cyanidin 3-O-[(6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] in the red-leafed varieties. Three 
kaempferol conjugates [kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-glucuronide, and 
kaempferol 3-O-[6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] were measured in each of the endive 
varieties. The presence and identity of kaempferol 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside in 
endive was shown for the first time. Shredding of lettuce leaf followed by 
exposure to light produced significant losses of the flavonoid moiety in the 
green oak leaf (94%), red oak leaf (43%), iceberg (36%), green batavia (25%), 
lollo biondo (24%), and lollo rosso (6%) samples, whereas cos and green salad 
bowl samples did not show an overall loss. Shredding of endive also produced 
loss of the flavonoid moiety in escarole (32%), fine frisee (13%), and coarse 
frisee (8%). Significant demalonation was observed for both the quercetin and 
cyanidin glucosides in lettuce, whereas a similar degradation of the kaempferol 
analogue was found in endive tissue. Storage of whole heads of both lettuce and 
endive in the dark at 1 degrees C and 98% humidity for 7 days resulted in losses 
of total flavonol glycosides in the range of 7-46%. The identification of the 
amounts, position of substitution, and nature of the sugars is important for 
understanding the potential bioavailability and biological activities of 
flavonoids in salads.

We determined the uptake and excretion of low doses of polyphenols in six 
subjects who each consumed 1.1 L of an alcoholic cider beverage. Over a 24-h 
period, no phloretin was detected in plasma (detection limit = 0.036 
micromol/L), but 21 +/- 5% of the dose (4.8 mg) was excreted in the urine. In 
contrast, from a low dose of 1.6-mg quercetin equivalents, no quercetin was 
found in urine or plasma, but 3'-methyl quercetin was detected in plasma [C(max) 
(maximum concentration) = 0.14 +/- 0.19 micromol/L; range: 0 to 0.44 
micromol/L]. No flavanol monomers (dose of free (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin 
= 3.5 mg) were detected in urine or plasma (detection limit: 0.01 micromol/L). 
Caffeic acid (total dose including esters = 11 mg) was detected only in plasma 
within 2 h, with C(max) = 0.43 +/- 0.3 micromol/L (range: 0.18 to 0.84 
micromol/L). An almost 3-fold increase in hippuric acid was detected in 24-h 
urine (74 +/- 29 micromol/L; range: 38-116 micromol/L), compared with a prestudy 
value of 19 +/- 9 micromol/L. These data show that polyphenols are taken up from 
cider, that phloretin is excreted in the urine and suggest that low doses of 
quercetin are extensively methylated in humans.

Berries are known to contain phenolic substances (i.e., flavonoids and phenolic 
acids), which comprise two large and heterogeneous groups of biologically active 
nonnutrients. This investigation evaluated the content and profile of the 
phenolic compounds present in six different berries found in Northern Europe. 
The latter included bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), cowberry (Vaccinium 
vitis-idaea), cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccus), strawberry (Fragaria ananassa), 
black currant (Ribes nigrum), and red currant (Ribes rubrum). The study was 
focused on two areas. The first involved the extraction and analysis of berries 
for total phenolic content and determination of their antioxidant activity. The 
total phenolic level of berries was correlated with their antioxidant activity. 
Second, the berry extracts were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis to 
determine the content and profile of selected bioactive compounds. The analytes 
of interest included trans-resveratrol, cinnamic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric 
acid, quercetin, and morin.

Antioxidant capacity, as measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), 
and total phenolic and total anthocyanin contents were evaluated in fruit 
tissues of 87 highbush blueberry (Vacciniumcorymbosum L.) and 
species-introgressed highbush blueberry cultivars. ORAC and phenolic levels were 
evaluated in leaf tissues of the same materials. Average values for ORAC, 
phenolics, and anthocyanins in fruit were 15.9 ORAC units, 1.79 mg/g (gallic 
acid equivalents), and 0.95 mg/g (cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents), 
respectively. Cv. Rubel had the highest ORAC per gram of fresh weight values, at 
31.1 units, and cv. Elliott had the highest values on the basis of ORAC per 
square centimeter of surface area. In leaf tissue, values for both ORAC and 
phenolics were significantly higher than in fruit tissue, with mean values of 
490 ORAC units and 44.80 mg/g (gallic acid equivalents), respectively. Leaf ORAC 
had a low, but significant, correlation with fruit phenolics and anthocyanins, 
but not with fruit ORAC. An analysis of ORAC values versus calculated midparent 
values in 11 plants from the 87-cultivar group in which all parents were tested 
suggested that, across cultivars, ORAC inheritance is additive. An investigation 
of ORAC values in a family of 44 cv. Rubel x Duke seedlings showed negative 
epistasis for ORAC values, suggesting Rubel may have gene combinations 
contributing to ORAC that are broken up during hybridization.

Citrus flavonoids have been investigated for their biological activity, with 
both anti-inflammatory and -carcinogenic effects being reported. However, little 
information is known on the bioavailability of these compounds in vivo. The 
objectives of this study were to determine the tissue distribution of naringenin 
after gastric gavage of [3H]-naringenin to rats. Unlabelled naringenin was also 
used to quantify the levels of naringenin and its major metabolites in tissues 
and eliminated in the urine and faeces. Significant radioactivity was detected 
in the plasma as well as all tissues examined 2h post-gavage. After 18h, higher 
levels of radioactivity were retained in plasma and tissues (55% of the 
administered radioactivity). Investigation of the nature of metabolites, using 
unlabelled naringenin, revealed that the glucuronides were the major components 
in plasma, tissues and urine, in addition to the colonic metabolite 
3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid, detected in the urine. The aglycone was the 
form extensively retained in tissues after 18h post-gavage. Total identified 
metabolites detected after 18h in most tissues were only 1-5% of the levels 
detected after 2h. However, the brain, lungs and heart retained 27, 20 and 11%, 
respectively, relative to the total metabolites detected at 2h. While 
radioactive detection suggests increased levels of breakdown products of 
naringenin after 18 h versus 2 h, the products identified using unlabelled 
naringenin are not consistent with this, suggesting that a predominant 
proportion of the naringenin breakdown products at 18 h are retained as smaller 
decomposition molecules which cannot yet be identified.

Recent reports have demonstrated various cardiovascular and neurological 
benefits associated with the consumption of foods rich in anthocyanidins. 
However, information regarding absorption, metabolism, and especially, tissue 
distribution are only beginning to accumulate. In the present study, we 
investigated the occurrence and the kinetics of various circulating pelargonidin 
metabolites, and we aimed at providing initial information with regard to tissue 
distribution. Based on HPLC and LC-MS analyses we demonstrate that pelargonidin 
is absorbed and present in plasma following oral gavage to rats. In addition, 
the main structurally related pelargonidin metabolite identified in plasma and 
urine was pelargonidin glucuronide. Furthermore, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, a ring 
fission product of pelargonidin, was detected in plasma and urine samples 
obtained at 2 and 18 h after ingestion. At 2 h post-gavage, pelargonidin 
glucuronide was the major metabolite detected in kidney and liver, with levels 
reaching 0.5 and 0.15 nmol pelargonidin equivalents/g tissue, respectively. 
Brain and lung tissues contained detectable levels of the aglycone, with the 
glucuronide also present in the lungs. Other tissues, including spleen and 
heart, did not contain detectable levels of pelargonidin or ensuing metabolites. 
At 18 h post-gavage, tissue analyses did not reveal detectable levels of the 
aglycone nor of pelargonidin glucuronides. Taken together, our results

However, the amounts recovered dropped to 1.2 % only 18 h post-gavage, with the 
urine and faecal content constituting almost 90 % of the total recovered 
pelargonidin.

The effects of cooking treatments (boiling, autoclaving and microwave cooking) 
and germination on the nutritional composition and antinutritional factors of 
chickpeas were studied. Cooking treatments and/or germination caused significant 
(p < 0.05) decreases in fat, total ash, carbohydrate fractions, antinutritional 
factors, minerals and B-vitamins. Germination was less effective than cooking 
treatments in reducing trypsin inhibitor, hemagglutinin activity, tannins and 
saponins; it was more effective in reducing phytic acid, stachyose and 
raffinose. Cooking treatments and germination decreased the concentrations of 
lysine, tryptophan, total aromatic and sulfur-containing amino acids. However, 
cooked and germinated chickpeas were still higher in lysine, isoleucine and 
total aromatic amino acid contents than the FAO/WHO reference. The losses in 
B-vitamins and minerals in chickpeas cooked by microwaving were smaller than in 
those cooked by boiling and autoclaving. Germination resulted in greater 
retention of all minerals and B-vitamins compared to cooking treatments. In 
vitro protein digestibility, protein efficiency ratio and essential amino acid 
index were improved by all treatments. The chemical score and limiting amino 
acid of chickpeas subjected to the various treatments varied considerably, 
depending on the type of treatment. Based on these results, microwave cooking 
appears to be the best alternative for legume preparation in households and 
restaurants.

A HPLC method was developed for the analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside 
(SDG) and hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in milled defatted flaxseed flour. 
Direct extraction by 1 M NaOH for 1 h at 20 degrees C resulted in a higher yield 
than that obtained by hydrolysis of alcoholic extracts. An internal standard, 
o-coumaric acid, was used and the method was found to be easy, fast, and with 
good repeatability. On dry matter basis, different samples of flaxseeds varied 
considerably in their content of (+)-SDG (11.9-25.9 mg/g), (-)-SDG (2.2-5.0 
mg/g), p-coumaric acid glucoside (1.2-8.5 mg/g), and ferulic acid glucoside 
(1.6-5.0 mg/g).

Oat milling fractions were examined for concentrations of total phenolics, 
tocols, and phenolic acids and in vitro antioxidant activity to determine their 
potential as dietary antioxidants. Methanolic extracts of pearling fractions, 
flour and aspirations from flaking, and trichomes had high, intermediate, and 
low antioxidant activities, respectively, evaluated by the beta-carotene 
bleaching method. Pearling fractions were also highest in total phenolics and 
tocols. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, vanillin, p-coumaric 
acid, and ferulic acid were identified and quantified by HPLC. Three 
avenanthramides and an unidentified ferulate derivative were also detected. 
Total phenolic content was significantly correlated with antioxidant activity, 
and regression equations that predicted antioxidant activity from phenolic and 
tocol concentrations were calculated. Antioxidant activity, evaluated by 
beta-carotene bleaching, was correlated with measures of oxygen radical 
absorbance capacity and low-density lipoprotein oxidation. These data indicate a 
potential for oat products, especially those enriched in outer layers of the 
groat, to contribute to dietary intakes of antioxidant phytonutrients.

University, No 2, Beining Rd., Keelung City 20224, Taiwan.

Coffee is one of the top ten most adulterated foods. Coffee adulterations are 
mainly performed by mixing other low-value materials into coffee beans after 
roasting and grinding, such as spent coffee grounds, maize, soybeans and other 
grain products. The detection of adulterated coffee by high performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) is recognized as a targeted analytical method, which 
carbohydrates and other phenolic compounds are usually used as markers. However, 
the accurate qualitation and quantitation of HPLC analyses are time consuming. 
This study developed a chemometric analysis or called non-targeted analysis for 
coffee adulteration. The HPLC chromatograms were obtained by direct injection of 
liquid coffee into HPLC without sample preparation and the identification of 
target analytes. The distinction between coffee and adulterated coffee was 
achieved by statistical method. The HPLC-based chemometric provided more 
characteristic information (separated compounds) compared to photospectroscopy 
chemometric which only provide information of functional groups. In this study, 
green Arabica coffee beans, soybeans and green mung beans were roasted in 
industrial coffee bean roaster and then ground. Spent coffee ground was dried. 
Coffee and adulterants were mixed at different ratio before conducting HPLC 
analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) toward HPLC data (retention time 
and peak intensity) was able to separate coffee from adulterated coffee. The 
detection limit of this method was 5%. Two models were built based on PCA data 
as well. The first model was used to differentiate coffee sample from 
adulterated coffee. The second model was designed to identify the specific 
adulterants mixed in the adulterated coffee. Various parameters such as 
sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), reliability rate (RLR), positive likelihood 
(+LR) and negative likelihood (-LR) were applied to evaluate the performances of 
the designed models. The results showed that PCA-based models were able to 
discriminate pure coffee from adulterated sample (coffee beans adulterated with 
5%-60% of soybeans, green mung beans or spent coffee grounds). The SE, SP, RLR, 
+LR and -LR for the first model were 0.875, 0.938, 0.813, 14.1 and 0.133, 
respectively. In the second model, it can correctly distinguish the adulterated 
coffee from the pure coffee. However, it had only about a 30% chance to 
correctly determine the specific adulterant out of three designed adulterants 
mixed into coffee. The SE, RLR and -LR were 0.333, 0.333 and 0.667, 
respectively, for the second model. Therefore, HPLC-based chemometric analysis 
was able to detect coffee adulteration. It was very reliable on the 
discrimination of coffee from adulterated coffee. However, it may need more work 
to tell discern which kind adulterant in the adulterated coffee.

The polyphenolic composition of 62 wild and weedy Mexican bean collections from 
diverse origins, grouped by their seed coat color, was assessed. According to 
spectrophotometric analysis, the range of total phenols, condensed tannins, and 
total anthocyanins presented wide differences. Furthermore, the phenolic acid, 
flavonoid, and anthocyanin profiles were analyzed using HPLC. Ferulic was the 
main phenolic acid. Kaempferol and quercetin were the main flavonoids, and the 
isoflavones daidzein and coumestrol were found in only low levels in few 
collections. Delphinidin was the main anthocyanidin found, followed by 
petunidin, cyanidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, and peonidin. The wide variation 
observed in polyphenolic contents was more related to their genotype than to the 
color factor. These results show that some wild and weedy beans are good sources 
of phenolic compounds for use in breeding programs focused on nutrition and 
health.

Isoflavone phytoestrogens found in soybeans are the most widely studied 
phytochemicals in human diets and soy infant formulas. The health benefits of 
the isoflavones daidzein and genistein have been reported, and concerns about 
potential adverse effects have also been raised. However, the results of direct 
analysis of isoflavones and their metabolites in biological fluids after 
consumption of soy-containing diets are scarce. This study describes an LC/MS/MS 
method for the analysis of isoflavones and their metabolites in the urine of 
female rats fed diets made with soy protein isolate. Five isoflavones (daidzein, 
genistein, glycitein, dihydrodaidzein, and O-desmethylangolensin) were 
identified by comparison with authentic standards. Seventeen conjugates of 
isoflavones were characterized in the urine, the most unusual being genistein 
5-glucuronide and four glucuronide conjugates of reductive metabolites of 
daidzein. The application of LC/MS/MS to analyze isoflavone metabolites is 
simple and sensitive, and appears to be an excellent method for determining the 
bioavailability and metabolism of food phytochemistry.

Naringin is a flavonoid that exists in many plants and traditional Chinese 
medicines. In this study, a highly sensitive and specific electrospray 
ionization (ESI) liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) 
method was developed for quantification of naringin and its two metabolites, 
naringenin and naringenin glucuronide. Naringin and naringenin were extracted 
from rat plasma with ethyl acetate, using hesperidin as an internal standard. 
Components in the extract were separated on a 100 mm x 2.0 mm Betabasic 5 microm 
C18 ODS column by isocratic elution with 70% methanol. The components were 
analyzed in the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode in the precursor/product 
ion pair of m/z 581.3/273.4 for naringin, m/z 273.4/153.1 for naringenin and m/z 
611.5/303.4 for hesperidin, respectively. Linear calibration curves were 
obtained in the range of 5-1000 ng/ml, using 0.1 ml rat plasma. The within-day 
coefficients of variation (CVs) were 3.1, 1.8 and 2.2% for naringin, 3.0, 3.3, 
3.1% for naringenin at 5, 50 and 500 ng/ml (n=5). The between-day CVs were 3.4, 
1.7 and 4.9% for naringin and 4.0, 3.0, 4.6% for naringenin (n=5) at 5, 50 and 
500 ng/ml respectively. A formulation based on PEG400 was used and orally 
administered to Sprague-Dawley male rats. Plasma drug concentrations were 
measured by this method and the pharmacokinetics was analyzed by WinNonlin 
computer software. Plasma concentration-time profiles of naringin were found to 
increase quickly and decline rapidly within 2 h and could not be detected after 
24 h. Naringenin and naringenin glucuronide occurred slower and the T(max) were 
about 9 and 7.5 h later, respectively.

The market for decaffeinated coffees has been increasingly expanding over the 
years. Caffeine extraction may result in losses of other compounds such as 
chlorogenic acids (CGA) and, consequently, their 1,5-gamma-quinolactones (CGL) 
in roasted coffee. These phenolic compounds are important for flavor formation 
as well as the health effects of coffee; therefore, losses due to decaffeination 
need to be investigated. The present study evaluates the impact of 
decaffeination processing on CGA and CGL levels of green and roasted arabica 
coffees. Decaffeination produced a 16% average increase in the levels of total 
CGA in green coffee (dry matter), along with a 237% increase in CGL direct 
precursors. Different degrees of roasting showed average increments of 5.5-18% 
in CGL levels of decaffeinated coffee, compared to regular, a change more 
consistent with observed levels of total CGA than with those of CGL direct 
precursors in green samples. On the other hand, CGA levels in roasted coffee 
were 3-9% lower in decaffeinated coffee compared to regular coffee. Although 
differences in CGA and CGL contents of regular and decaffeinated roasted coffees 
appear to be relatively small, they may be enough to affect flavor 
characteristics as well as the biopharmacological properties of the final 
beverage, suggesting the need for further study.

Unbalanced diets generate oxidative stress commonly associated with the 
development of diabetes, atherosclerosis, obesity and cancer. Dietary flavonoids 
have antioxidant properties and may limit this stress and reduce the risk of 
these diseases. We used a metabolomic approach to study the influence of 
catechin, a common flavonoid naturally occurring in various fruits, wine or 
chocolate, on the metabolic changes induced by hyperlipidemic diets. Male Wistar 
rats ( n = 8/group) were fed during 6 weeks normolipidemic (5% w/w) or 
hyperlipidemic (15 and 25%) diets with or without catechin supplementation (0.2% 
w/w). Urines were collected at days 17 and 38 and analyzed by reverse-phase 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF). Hyperlipidic diets led to a 
significant increase of oxidative stress in liver and aorta, upon which catechin 
had no effect. Multivariate analyses (PCA and PLS-DA) of the urine fingerprints 
allowed discrimination of the different diets. Variables were then classified 
according to their dependence on lipid and catechin intake (ANOVA). Nine 
variables were identified as catechin metabolites of tissular or microbial 
origin. Around 1000 variables were significantly affected by the lipid content 
of the diet, and 76 were fully reversed by catechin supplementation. Four 
variables showing an increase in urinary excretion in rats fed the high-fat 
diets were identified as deoxycytidine, nicotinic acid, dihydroxyquinoline and 
pipecolinic acid. After catechin supplementation, the excretion of nicotinic 
acid was fully restored to the level found in the rats fed the low-fat diet. The 
physiological significance of these metabolic changes is discussed.

Anthocyanins are phenolic compounds widely distributed in fruits and vegetables. 
Their consumption has been shown to prevent some chronic diseases. Anthocyanin 
metabolism, however, is still not fully understood. The aim of this work was to 
evaluate the bioavailability of anthocyanins in humans consuming a meal 
containing strawberries and to identify possible metabolites in urine. Six 
healthy volunteers (three women and three men) consumed a meal containing 200 g 
strawberries (providing 179 micro mol pelargonidin-3-glucoside). Urine samples 
were collected before and after the meal and rapidly treated by solid-phase 
extraction. Identification and quantification of anthocyanin metabolites were 
carried out by HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC with UV-visible detection, respectively. 
In addition to pelargonidin-3-glucoside, five anthocyanin metabolites were 
identified in urine: three monoglucuronides of pelargonidin, one sulfoconjugate 
of pelargonidin and pelargonidin itself. Total urinary excretion of strawberry 
anthocyanin metabolites corresponded to 1.80 +/- 0.29% (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) of 
pelargonidin-3-glucoside ingested. More than 80% of this excretion was related 
to a monoglucuronide. Four hours after the meal, more than two-thirds of 
anthocyanin metabolites had been excreted, although urinary excretion of the 
metabolites continued until the end of the 24-h experiment. This study 
demonstrated that anthocyanins were glucuro- and sulfo-conjugated in humans and 
that the main metabolite of strawberry anthocyanins in human urine was a 
monoglucuronide of pelargonidin.

The consumption of anthocyanins has been shown to prevent certain chronic 
diseases. However, anthocyanin metabolism has not yet been fully elucidated. The 
aim of this study was to evaluate anthocyanin urinary excretion in humans 
receiving a meal containing blackberries and to identify possible metabolites in 
urine. Five healthy volunteers were fed 200 g of blackberries (960 mumol of 
anthocyanins). Urine samples were collected and rapidly treated by solid-phase 
extraction. Anthocyanin metabolites were identified and quantified by 
HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC with UV-vis detection, respectively. In addition to 
native cyanidin 3-glucoside, several other anthocyanin metabolites were 
identified in the urine: methylated glycosides, glucuronides of anthocyanidins 
and anthocyanins, a sulfoconjugate of cyanidin, and anthocyanidins. Total 
urinary excretion of blackberry anthocyanin metabolites was 0.160 +/- 0.020% (n 
= 5) of the amount of anthocyanins ingested. Monoglucuronides of anthocyanidins 
represented >60% of this excretion. Urinary excretion of anthocyanins was 
maximal between 2 and 4 h after the meal, but continued during the 24 h of the 
experiment. This study highlighted the influence of aglycon structure on 
anthocyanin urinary excretion. It demonstrated that anthocyanins are not only 
methylated but also glucuroconjugated and sulfoconjugated in humans and that the 
main metabolites of blackberry anthocyanins in human urine were anthocyanidin 
monoglucuronides.

Anthocyanins are natural pigments that could be involved in various health 
effects. Red oranges are an important dietary source of anthocyanins, including 
cyanidin 3-glucoside (Cy 3-glc) and an acylated derivative, cyanidin 
3-(6''-malonyl)-glucoside (Cy 3-malglc). The aim of this study was to evaluate 
the absorption and metabolism of red orange anthocyanins in rats fed an 
anthocyanin-enriched diet for 12 d (approximately 2.8 micromol anthocyanins/d). 
Furthermore, the absorption of these anthocyanins was studied in both the 
stomach and intestine using in situ models in rats. Anthocyanin metabolites were 
identified and quantified by HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem MS and 
HPLC-diode array detection, respectively. The red orange anthocyanins, Cy 3-glc 
and Cy 3-malglc, as well as their respective methylated derivatives, were 
recovered in urine after red orange juice intake. The 24 h urinary excretion of 
total anthocyanins was low (0.081 (SEM 0.009) % of the ingested amount). 
However, a high proportion (about 20 %) of red orange anthocyanins was absorbed 
from the stomach. More Cy 3-malglc than Cy 3-glc was absorbed in the intestine. 
This study thus indicated that red orange juice anthocyanins were rapidly 
absorbed from both stomach and small intestine, and then excreted in the urine 
as intact and methylated forms. Moreover, the absorption and metabolism of 
acylated anthocyanins and non-acylated anthocyanins were similar.

In this study, the effects of three common cooking practices (i.e., boiling, 
steaming, and frying) on the artichoke phenolic compounds pattern were evaluated 
by LC-MS/MS analysis. The variation of carotenoids, antioxidant capacity, and 
artichoke physical properties after cooking was also investigated. The major 
phenolic compounds present in the raw sample were 5- O-caffeoylquinic and 
1,5-di- O-caffeoylquinic acids; after cooking treatments, an increase of the 
overall caffeoylquinic acids concentration due to the formation of different 
dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers was observed. Steamed and fried samples showed 
similar patterns of dicaffeoylquinic concentrations, which were higher with 
respect to the boiled samples. On the other hand, all cooking practices, 
particularly frying, decreased flavonoid concentration. The antioxidant capacity 
of cooked artichokes, measured by three different assays, enormously increased 
after cooking, particularly after steaming (up to 15-fold) and boiling (up to 
8-fold). The observed cooking effect on the artichoke antioxidant profile is 
probably due to matrix softening and increased extractability of compounds, but 
the increase of antioxidant capacity is much higher than the increase of 
antioxidant concentration. These results suggest that some common cooking 
treatments can be used to enhance the nutritional value of vegetables, 
increasing bioaccessibility of health-promoting constituents.

The present study explored the bioavailability and brain deposition of a grape 
seed polyphenolic extract (GSPE) previously found to attenuate cognitive 
deterioration in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma 
pharmacokinetic response of major GSPE phenolic components was measured 
following intragastric gavage of 50, 100, and 150 mg GSPE per kg body weight. 
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis identified gallic acid 
(GA), catechin (C), and epicatechin (EC) in plasma of rats gavaged acutely with 
GSPE. Additionally, 4-methylgallic acid (4-OMeGA), 3'-methylcatechin (3'-OMeC), 
and 3'-methylepicatechin (3'-OMeEC) were identified as circulating metabolites 
of GSPE phenolic constituents. Cmax for individual GSPE constituents and their 
metabolites increased in a dose-dependent fashion (with increasing GSPE oral 
dose). Repeated daily exposure to GSPE was found to significantly increase 
bioavailability (defined as plasma AUC0-8h) of GA, C, and EC by 198, 253, and 
282% relative to animals receiving only a single acute GSPE dose. EC and C were 
not detectable in brain tissues of rats receiving a single GSPE dose but reached 
levels of 290.7 +/-45.9 and 576.7 +/- 227.7 pg/g in brain tissues from rats 
administered GSPE for 10 days. This study suggests that brain deposition of GA, 
C, and EC is affected by repeated dosing of GSPE.

The simultaneous determination of 19 phenolic compounds was performed directly 
in wort and beer by a combination of reverse-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography coupled with coulometric array detection. Chromatographic 
separation was achieved with an appropriate gradient of flow and a binary 
solvent based on phosphate buffer, methanol, and acetonitrile in a 45-min run. 
Eight serial coulometric detectors were used for on-line generation of 
voltammetric data to resolve coeluting compounds. The method was reliable and 
sensitive, the regression coefficient of standard calibration curves is 0.972 < 
or = r < or = 1.000, and the standard deviation value ranges from 0.010 to 0.129 
mg/L for wort and from 0.002 to 0.332 mg/L for beer. The mean concentrations of 
phenolic acids were 22.1 and 33.8 mg/L, respectively, in worts and beers 
produced in Italy. These amounts represent 5 and 10% of the non-tannic, 
non-flavonoid phenols in wort and beer, respectively.

In vitro studies show that some individual minor polar phenolic compounds (MPC) 
present in virgin olive oil prevent oxidation of human low-density lipoproteins 
(LDL), but few data are available on the antioxidant effect of whole oil 
extract. Thus, whole virgin olive extracts were studied to determine whether 
they maintain the antioxidant activity and whether this last is linked to MPC 
composition of a single virgin oil. Using HPLC-DAD the MPC content in Taggiasca 
and Seggianese virgin olive oils was measured. Taggiasca oil was less rich in 
total MPC (208.5 mg/L) than Seggianese oil (441.9 mg/L). In addition, the major 
compounds of Taggiasca oil were lignan derivatives, whereas the major compounds 
in Seggianese oils were secoiridoid derivatives. Moreover, Taggiasca oil was 
practically free of 5-hydroxytyrosol and 5-hydroxytyrosol derivatives, 
deacetoxy-oleuropein aglycone and oleuropein aglycone. The antioxidant activity 
of the oils on human LDL was evaluated by measuring malondialdehyde and 
conjugate diene generation induced by copper ions. In both tests, the oil 
extracts dose-dependently reduced malondialdehyde and conjugate diene 
generation. Moreover, antioxidant potency correlated with total MPC; thus, 
Seggianese extract was more active. The two oils differed quantitatively and 
qualitatively, and these differences influenced their biological activities; 
thus clinical trials focused on studying the effects of olive oils should 
specify the oils used.

A fast, precise and selective diode array HPLC method is presented for the 
extraction and analysis of soy isoflavonoids from foods and from human urine, 
plasma, and breast milk in support of mechanistic and epidemiologic studies 
assessing the potential cancer protective role of soya or isoflavones. Solid 
phase or solvent extraction was chosen for isolation, and enzymatic or acid 
hydrolysis procedures were used for aglycone production depending on the matrix 
to be analyzed. C-18 reversed-phase HPLC was applied to selectively separate and 
quantitate daidzein (1), glycitein (3), and genistein (4), including their 
malonyl (a) and acetyl (b) esters, and their mammalian metabolites equol (6) and 
O-desmethylangolensin (7), as well as formononetin (2), biochanin-A (5), and 
coumestrol (8) using a gradient elution system. UV absorbance scans and 
authentic standards were applied for identification purposes, additional to 
fluorometric monitoring, electrochemical detection, and GC/ MS analysis after 
trimethyl silylation. Detection limits of 20-microl injections were found to be 
1.09, 0.53, 3.28, and 1.00 pmoles for daidzein, genistein, equol, and 
O-desmethylangolensin (DMA), respectively, by monitoring at the individual 
compound's absorption maximum. The proposed method was applied to monitor 
isoflavone levels in soy foods and in human plasma, urine and breast milk after 
challenge with roasted soybeans. Implications of the presented results on the 
potential activity of isoflavones to prevent cancer by exposing newborn infants 
to these agents are discussed.

Concentrations and glucosidic conjugation patterns of isoflavones were 
determined in soy foods consumed by multiethnic populations in Singapore and 
Hawaii. Six raw and 11 cooked food groups traditionally consumed in Singapore 
and 8 food groups consumed in Hawaii were analyzed by reversed-phase 
high-pressure liquid chromatography with diode array detection. Mean total 
isoflavone levels varied between 35 and 7500 ppm, with the lowest values found 
in soy milk and burgers and the highest levels observed in soybean and its seeds 
and in supplements. Total isoflavone levels and conjugation patterns varied as a 
function of soybean variety, storage conditions, and food processing. A large 
contribution to the differences in total isoflavone content between food groups 
was due to the water content in foods and to leaching of polar analytes into the 
water phase during boiling. Soy protein drinks and traditional soy foods were 
found to possess very similar isoflavone amounts considering usual serving 
sizes.

years. Dietary intake of isoflavones (genistein and daidzein) and lignans 
(secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol) were estimated by a 53-item 
interviewer-administered FFQ on two occasions, reflecting 'habitual' (previous 2 
months) and 'recent' (previous 2 days) dietary intake. Isoflavone (genistein, 
daidzein) and lignan (enterolactone, enterodiol and secoisolariciresinol) 
concentrations were measured in 24-hour urine samples by gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry. Correlations between FFQ (habitual and recent, separately) and 
urinary metabolite values were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients.
RESULTS: Mean habitual isoflavone and lignan intakes were 13.7 mg/day and 13.8 
mg/day, respectively. Mean urinary concentrations of isoflavones and lignans 
were 17.4 micromol/day and 20.6 micromol/day, respectively. Recent and habitual 
isoflavone intakes were correlated with urinary excretion of metabolites (r = 
0.64, p < 0.001 and r = 0.54, p = 0.004, respectively). Urinary excretion of 
lignans was also modestly correlated with recent and habitual lignan intakes (r 
= 0.46, p = 0.02 and r = 0.40, p = 0.05, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of this FFQ as a measure of dietary 
isoflavone and lignan intake in epidemiological studies.

The aim of the presented work was to study the effect of pressing method, 
pasteurization, cultivar, and vintage on the content of (+)-catechin, 
(-)-epicatechin, and nine procyanidins in grape juice. The results showed that 
the concentration of these flavan-3-ols in the juice was influenced, in 
decreasing order of importance, by pressing method, cultivar, pasteurization, 
and vintage. Cold pressing without maceration was the least and hot pressing 
after maceration at 60 degrees C for 60 min the most effective method for 
extracting the flavan-3-ols. Pasteurization increased the concentration of 
catechins in cold-pressed juices, but it decreased concentrations in hot-pressed 
juices. The concentration of most procyanidins was increased by pasteurization. 
Among the white cultivars, Seyval and Niagara were highest in procyanidins and 
Elvira and Chardonnay were highest in catechins. Vincent, Foch, and Baco were 
the red cultivars highest in catechins, and Vincent also had the highest content 
of procyanidins.

Seed coats and cotyledons from 25 Brazilian and 3 Peruvian bean cultivars were 
investigated in relation to their phenolic profiles and antioxidant capacity. 
Condensed tannins, anthocyanins, and flavonols such as kaempferol and quercetin 
glycosides were mostly found in seed coats. Cotyledons were rich in phenolic 
acids, such as ferulic, sinapic, chlorogenic, and other hydroxycinnamic acids. 
In general, the seed coat color pattern and the type of cultivar showed an 
important influence on the variability of phenolic profiles and levels, 
respectively. Total phenolics and antioxidant capacity assessed by the DPPH 
method were higher in seed coats than in cotyledons. The antioxidant capacity 
had a significant correlation with condensed tannins for all samples and with 
total anthocyanins in black and red seed coats, whereas in cotyledons, it was 
more related to the total phenolic content.

Analysis of phenolics and flavonoids in juice beverages using reversed-phase 
HPLC with coulometric array detection is described. Sixteen serial coulometric 
detectors were used for on-line resolution of co-eluting compounds and 
generation of voltammetric data. Within each class of compounds, oxidation 
potential corresponded to specific substitution patterns where: catechol < 
methoxycatechol < monohydroxyl < methoxyl. Twenty-seven standard compounds were 
resolved in a 45-min run. The limits of detection were in the low ng/ml range 
with a linear response range of at least three orders of magnitude. Intra-run 
retention time variation was < 1% (R.S.D.) and adjacent sensor response ratios 
varied by < 5% (R.S.D.). The utility of this technique in generating 
multivariate data for differentiation of juices and juice mixtures is shown.

The study of the chemical composition of wines is nowadays a topic of great 
interest because of the importance of this market, especially in Italy, and also 
considering the numerous cases of falsification of famous and very expensive 
wines. The present paper focused on the analysis of metals and polyphenols in 
Italian wines belonging to different provenance and types. At this purpose 20 
elements were quantified by inductively coupled plasma optical emission 
spectrometry (ICP-OES) and ICP mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Regarding 
polyphenols, a total of 32 were quantified, among 6 were anthocyanins. 
Furthermore, in 4 samples (1 rosè and 3 red wines) 42 anthocyanins and related 
compounds were identified by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography 
(UHPLC)-Orbitrap MS technique (among these, 6 were also quantified). 
Non-anthocyanins were determined using UHPLC coupled with a diode array detector 
and triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (UHPLC-DAD-QqQ-MS). Total phenolic 
content (TPC) and radical scavenging activity (RSA) were measured using 
spectrophotometric methods. The results obtained by elemental techniques were 
submitted to principal components analysis (PCA) allowing to get information on 
both geographical and botanical origin of the examined wine samples. Some 
polyphenols have been detected in higher concentrations only in a certain type 
of wine, as for example in the case of Grechetto wine. Most of the identified 
anthocyanin derivatives (pyranoanthocyanins) are formed during the aging of wine 
by reaction with the other wine components.

The concentrations of trans-resveratrol, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and 
quercetin were evaluated by means of high-performance liquid 
chromatography-diode array detection in red wines obtained from Aglianico, 
Piedirosso, and Nerello Mascalese grapes. The trans-resveratrol and epicatechin 
concentrations did not differ significantly between experimental wines. The 
concentration of quercetin in Nerello Mascalese wines was more than twice that 
observed in Aglianico and Piedirosso wines. Nerello Mascalese wines also 
significantly differed from other wines in the (+)-catechin content, which was 
significantly higher than those found in the other two wines. During maceration, 
the maximum extraction of trans-resveratrol was reached after 12 days for 
Aglianico and Piedirosso, after which a decline was observed. On the contrary, 
in the case of Nerello Mascalese, the concentration of trans-resveratrol 
increased steadily throughout the whole maceration process. After 2 days of 
maceration, the maximum concentration of quercetin was observed in Aglianico 
must, whereas the maximum quercetin extraction was reached after 12 days for 
Piedirosso and 17 days for Nerello Mascalese. The maximum levels of (+)-catechin 
and (-)-epicatechin were generally observed after 12 days of maceration for all 
wines, although a decline of (-)-epicatechin occurred after maximum extraction 
in Aglianico and Piedirosso wines. Following marc pressing, a significant 
increase in the concentration of trans-resveratrol for Aglianico, (+)-catechin 
and (-)-epicatechin for Piedirosso, and (-)-epicatechin for Nerello Mascalese 
was observed.

A simple, rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy 
(LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of ethyl 
gallate, a pharmacologically active constituent isolated from Lagerstroemia 
speciosa (Linn.) Pers. This method was used to examine the pharmacokinetics of 
ethyl gallate and its major metabolite gallic acid in rat plasma using propyl 
gallate as an internal standard. After precipitation of the plasma proteins with 
acetonitrile, the analytes were separated on a Zorbax SB-C(18) column (3.5 
microm, 2.1 x 50 mm) with an isocratic mobile phase consisted of 
methanol-acetonitrile-10 mM ammonium acetate (10 : 25 : 65, v/v/v) containing 
0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. The Agilent G6410A triple 
quadrupole LC/MS system was operated under the multiple-reaction monitoring mode 
using the electrospray ionization technique in negative mode. The lower limits 
of quantification of gallic acid and ethyl gallate of the method were 0.5 and 
1.0 ng/mL. The intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision of the assay were 
less than 8.0%. This method has been applied successfully to a pharmacokinetic 
study involving the intragastric administration of ethyl gallate to rats.

Epidemiological studies suggest that a moderate consumption of anthocyanins may 
be associated with protection against coronary heart disease. The main dietary 
sources of anthocyanins include red-coloured fruits and red wine. Although 
dietary anthocyanins comprise a diverse mixture of molecules, little is known 
how structural diversity relates to their bioavailability and biological 
function. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the absorption and 
metabolism of the 3-monoglucosides of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin 
and malvidin in humans and to examine both the effect of consuming a red wine 
extract on plasma antioxidant status and on monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 
production in healthy human subjects. After a 12-h overnight fast, seven healthy 
volunteers received 12 g of an anthocyanin extract and provided 13 blood samples 
in the 24 h following the test meal. Furthermore, urine was collected during 
this 24-h period. Anthocyanins were detected in their intact form in both plasma 
and urine samples. Other anthocyanin metabolites could also be detected in 
plasma and urine and were identified as glucuronides of peonidin and malvidin. 
Anthocyanins and their metabolites appeared in plasma about 30 min after 
ingestion of the test meal and reached their maximum value around 1.6 h later 
for glucosides and 2.5 h for glucuronides. Total urinary excretion of red wine 
anthocyanins was 0.05+/-0.01% of the administered dose within 24 h. About 94% of 
the excreted anthocyanins was found in urine within 6 h. In spite of the low 
concentration of anthocyanins found in plasma, an increase in the antioxidant 
capacity and a decrease in MCP-1 circulating levels in plasma were observed.

Wheat bran contains several ester-linked dehydrodimers of ferulic acid, which 
were detected and quantified after sequential alkaline hydrolysis. The major 
dimers released were: 
trans-5-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-7-methoxy-2, 3- 
dihydrobenzofuran-3-carboxylic acid (5-8-BendiFA), 
(Z)-beta-[4-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-methoxyphenoxy]-4-hydroxy-3-methox ycinnamic 
acid (8-O-4-diFA) and (E,E)-4,4'-dihydroxy-5,5'-dimethoxy-3,3'-bicinnamic acid 
(5-5-diFA). trans-7-hydroxy-1-(4-hydroxy-3methoxyphenyl)-6-methoxy-1,2-dihydro - 
naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (8-8-diFA cyclic form) and 
4,4'-dihydroxy-3,3'-dimethoxy-beta,beta'-bicinnamic acid (8-8-diFA non cyclic 
form) were not detected. One of the most abundant dimers, 8-O-4-diFA, was 
purified from de-starched wheat bran after alkaline hydrolysis and preparative 
HPLC. The resultant product was identical to the chemically synthesised 
8-O-4-dimer by TLC and HPLC as confirmed by 1H-NMR and mass spectrometry. The 
absorption maxima and absorption coefficients for the synthetic compound in 
ethanol were: lambda max: 323 nm, lambda min: 258 nm, epsilon lambda max (M-1 
cm-1): 24,800 +/- 2100 and epsilon 280 (M-1 cm-1): 19,700 +/- 1100. The 
antioxidant properties of 8-O-4-diFA were assessed using: (a) inhibition of 
ascorbate/iron-induced peroxidation of phosphatidylcholine liposomes and; (b) 
scavenging of the radical cation of 2,2'-azinobis 
(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) relative to the water-soluble 
vitamin E analogue, Trolox C. The 8-O-4-diFA was a better antioxidant than 
ferulic acid in both lipid and aqueous phases. This is the first report of the 
antioxidant activity of a natural diferulate obtained from a plant.

The application of hydrostatic high pressure on an industrial line of nectarine 
(Prunus persica L.) purées was assessed in comparison with the traditional 
thermal treatment of pasteurization. Changes after thermal processing (85 °C, 5 
min) and after high-pressure processing (HPP: 450 or 600 MPa for 5 or 10 min) 
and during the refrigerated storage (60 d) of an industrially produced nectarine 
purée were evaluated. Conventional heat pasteurization as well as HPP showed 
similar microorganisms' inactivation and maintained the microbial stability of 
purées until the end of the refrigerated storage (60 d). In general, thermally 
treated purée and HP-treated purée at 600 MPa showed more intense color changes 
after processing than the other treatment. In addition, thermally treated purée 
showed more intense color changes during storage than HPP. The highest 
carotenoids extractability was found in those purées treated at the lowest 
high-pressure-treatment intensity and holding time (450 MPa/5 min), but at the 
end of the storage (day 60), no differences in individual or total carotenoid 
levels were found between the purées. HPP at 600 MPa/10 min showed the highest 
polyphenols content after the treatment and during the storage. At day 0, 
significantly higher values were found of total antioxidant activity in purée 
HP-treated at 450 MPa/10 min than in untreated purée; while at the end of the 
storage, HP-treated purée at 600 MPa/10 min had the highest antioxidant 
activity. Hydrostatic high-pressure application in the industrial line of 
nectarine purée presented some advantages compared to the thermal treatment; 
however, some of the changes found were lessen during the storage period. In 
addition, more studies need to be carried out for HP-treatment intensity 
optimization.

The current study evaluated the key characters of aroma composition in 
diversified red wines (Cinsaut, Grenache, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Cabernet 
Sauvignon, Nielluccio, Tempranillo, Syrah, Merlot and Caladoc). Out of hundreds 
of volatile compounds 64 compounds were considered for study. Different groups 
consisting of fatty acids, volatile alcohols, aldehydes, esters, volatile 
phenols and terpenes were analysed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry 
coupled with thermal desorption (TD-GC-MS). Among all these diversified classes, 
alcohols were found as the most dominant group followed by esters and acids 
whereas aldehydes, phenols and terpenes were found to be minor compounds. Among 
the varieties, Nielluccio wine recorded highest concentration of total volatile 
compounds (191.53 mg/L) while, it was least in Caladoc wines (15.45 mg/L). The 
principal component analysis clearly differentiated Grenache wines based on 
their relationships between scores and their aroma composition followed by 
Nielluccio and Cinsuat wines. Out of sixty four compounds, only six aromatic 
compounds viz. butanediol, isoamyl actate, γ-Terpene, butanol, acetic acid and 
furfural have satisfying aroma descriptors with floral and fruity nuances and 
contribute to differentiate the Grenache wines from other varieties which have 
similar scores in PC1 analysis. The cluster analysis also suggested that the 
wines in the same group (Cinsaut, Tempranillo and Syrah), (Cabernet Franc, 
Cabernet Sauvignon, Caladoc and Merlot) and (Nielluccio and Petit Verdot) had 
similar aroma characterization. Grenache wines were well differentiated from the 
sub group formed by other red varieties.

Effects of ripeness (nearly ripe, ripe, fully ripe) and cultivar ('Blink', 
'Polka' and 'Senga Sengana') on colour and chemical composition of strawberry 
fruits and their suitability for jam production, evaluated as stability during 
storage at 4 and 20°C for 3 and 6months, were investigated. Quality traits of 
fruits and jams were significantly affected by both ripeness stage and cultivar. 
However, after 6months of storage, particularly at 20°C, the effects of fruit 
ripeness and cultivar were considerably reduced. During jam storage, 
anthocyanins, ascorbic acid, chroma and hue were least stable in jams made from 
the least ripe fruits. Quality traits in jams made from 'Senga Sengana' were 
best preserved during storage, while quality and chemical composition in jams 
made from 'Blink' changed the most. In conclusion, fully ripe fruits were best 
suited for jam processing. Storage at low temperature was preferable and 'Senga 
Sengana' was the most and 'Blink' the least suitable cultivar for processing.

Propolis has various biological activities such as antibacterial, antiviral, 
antioxidant, immunostimulating and antiinflammatory, which are generally 
ascribed to the polyphenolic fraction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
absorption of the main polyphenols [caffeic acid (CA), pinobanksin-5methyl ether 
(P-5ME), pinobanksin (Pb), chrysin (C), pinocembrin (P), galangin (G), 
pinobanksin-3-acetate, pinobanksin esters and caffeic acid phenylethyl ester 
(CAPE)] from a dewaxed and standardized extract of propolis (EPID). Fifteen 
healthy volunteers consumed 5 mL EPID in water, corresponding to 125 mg of 
flavonoids. Blood samples were collected before, each hour for 8 h and 24 h 
after EPID intake. After deconjugation by beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase the 
plasma samples were analyzed by a selective liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method using morin as internal standard (I.S.). A 
kinetic profile characterized by two t(max), respectively at 1 h and about 5 h 
post-ingestion, was observed in all the subjects. The two peaks may be due to 
enterohepatic cycling. Among the various polyphenols ingested, only P-5ME, Pb, 
C, P and G were detected in plasma and C(max)t(1h) were 65.7 +/- 13.3, 46.5 +/- 
12.7, 79.5 +/- 18.6, 168.1 +/- 16.3 and 113.7 +/- 16.8 ng/mL, respectively. 
These levels decreased significantly after 8 h and were no longer detectable 24 
h after EPID intake. The recovery of the extraction for CA, Pb, C, P, G and I.S. 
from spiked plasma was 95.2 +/- 3.1, 93.1 +/- 3.6, 91 +/- 2.5, 96.4 +/- 4.2, 
93.4 +/- 2.4 and 85.5 +/- 2.4%, respectively. The results of this study evidence 
that flavonoids from EPID are absorbed, metabolized and Pb-5ME and G seem to 
have apparent absorption, measured as (AUC/dose), higher than C, P and Pb.

In the extracts of fresh raw and frozen broccoli, caffeic, ferulic, sinapinic 
acids and kaempferol were identified. Boiling reduced the amounts of caffeic 
acid and kaempferol in both samples. The concentration of polyphenols was 
2.69mg/g fresh mass and 0.96mg/fresh mass in fresh raw broccoli and frozen raw 
broccoli, respectively. Boiling significantly decreased the amounts of phenolic 
compounds in fresh broccoli (1.58mg/g of fresh mass). In the case of frozen 
broccoli, boiling increased the concentration of polyphenols by 38%. Fresh 
broccoli extract neutralized free radicals by 19.87%. Boiling significantly 
reduced its antiradical activity (to 15.06%). Samples of frozen broccoli had a 
27.06% antiradical ability. Boiling did not change the antiradical activity in 
frozen broccoli case. Hydrothermal processing significantly influenced on the 
ability of the extracts to inhibit the decolorization of β-carotene emulsion. 
The extract of fresh broccoli had a higher activity when uncooked. Boiling 
seemed to increase this activity in the case of frozen broccoli samples. The 
results of the studies on the ability of broccoli extracts to inhibit linoleic 
acid autooxidation were ambiguous and depended on the method applied. No 
correlation was found between the content of phenolic compounds and the 
antioxidant activity of the extracts, regardless of the experimental variant and 
technique used.

The content of anthocyanins, flavonols, and carbohydrates of Tropea red onions 
(Allium cepa L.) was determined by HPLC and HPLC-MS. Cyanidin derivatives 
constitute >50% of total anthocyanins, but delphinidin and petunidin 
derivatives, which have not been reported in red onions thus far, were also 
detected. The flavonoid distribution in the different layers of the bulbs 
indicates that, after homelike peeling, the edible portion contains 79% of the 
total content of quercetin 4'-glucoside but only 27% of the anthocyanins. 
Storage of onions for 6 weeks in different conditions, all of them mimicking 
home storage habits, resulted in a decrease to 64-73% of total anthocyanins. The 
same trend was verified for the total antioxidant activity, which was reduced to 
29-36%. A decrease in glucose and fructose content correlated with anthocyanin 
degradation was also observed. Storage at low temperature seems to better 
preserve the onion anthocyanins.

Using liquid/liquid extraction, three fractions were obtained from an Italian 
red wine containing single polyphenolic subfractions: (1) phenolic acids and 
quercetin-3-glucuronide, (2) catechins and quercetin-3-glucoside, and (3) 
anthocyanins. Beside the scavenging capacity of the different fractions against 
hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals, the in vitro inhibition of low density 
lipoprotein oxidation and platelet aggregation (two main events in the 
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis) were tested. The antioxidant activity of the 
fractions has been compared with that of the original red wine before and after 
dealcoholization. The anthocyanin fraction was the most effective both in 
scavenging reactive oxygen species and in inhibiting lipoprotein oxidation and 
platelet aggregation. This higher activity can be explained by both its high 
concentration in red wine and its antioxidant efficiency, which, at least for 
peroxyl radical scavenging, was three times as high as that of the other two 
fractions. Our results suggest that anthocyanins could be the key component in 
red wine in light of the protection against cardiovascular diseases, although 
this hypothesis needs in vivo evidence.

BACKGROUND: Aqueous extracts of most medicinal plants traditionally employed in 
Portugal (at the ratio of 1 g plant: 110 mL water) have been assayed for total 
antioxidant capacity and phenol content, in order to elucidate their claimed 
medicinal features.
RESULTS: The antioxidant activity was assessed by the ABTS(•+) method; the 
ascorbic acid equivalent values ranged from 1.4280 ± 0.1261 g L(-1) for avocado 
(Persea americana (Lauraceae)) obtained by infusion of powder, down to 0.0027 ± 
0.0012 g L(-1) for olive (Olea europaea (Oleaceae)) obtained by infusion of 
leaves. Total phenol content was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure; 
the gallic acid equivalent values ranged from 0.5541 ± 0.0289 g L(-1) for 
avocado obtained by infusion of powder, down to 0.0053 ± 0.0014 g L(-1) for 
olive obtained by boiling leaves. A good correlation between total antioxidant 
capacity and total phenol content was found.
CONCLUSION: The method of powder infusion should be chosen if high concentration 
of antioxidants are sought. On the other hand, a high antioxidant capacity and a 
high phenol content correlate well with the empirically established (and widely 
publicised) capacity to treat respiratory infections. Copyright © 2007 Society

The effect of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) and cooking on the flavonoids 
and vitamin C content (ascorbic + dehydroascorbic acid; AA + DHAA) of fresh-cut 
spinach was evaluated. The total flavonoid content (approximately 1000 mg 
kg(-)(1) f.w.) remained quite constant during storage in both air and MAP 
atmospheres, while vitamin C (750 mg kg(-)(1)f.w.) was better preserved in 
MAP-stored spinach. AA was transformed to DHAA during storage, and its 
concentration was higher in MAP-stored tissues. The free-radical scavenging 
activity of the isolated flavonoids was tested, and only those flavonoids with 
either a dihydroxyl grouping or acylated with ferulic acid showed significant 
activity. A decrease in the total antioxidant activity was observed during 
storage, particularly important in MAP-stored spinach. The higher content of 
DHAA and lower content of both AA and antioxidant flavonoids in the MAP-stored 
samples could explain this antioxidant activity decrease. Boiling extracted 50% 
of total flavonoids and 60% vitamin C in the cooking water. However, flavonoid 
glucuronides were extracted more in the cooking water than the other glycosides. 
The vitamin C content of the cooked tissue was higher in those samples stored in 
MAP.

Orange juice manufactured at industrial scale was subjected to digestion under 
in vitro gastrointestinal conditions (pH, temperature, and enzyme and chemical 
conditions) to evaluate the influence of individual industrial processing 
treatments on flavanone solubility, stability, and ability to permeate through a 
membrane under simulated physiological conditions. Four industrial processes 
including squeezing, standard pasteurization, concentration, and freezing were 
evaluated. Hand squeezing was compared with industrial squeezing. After in vitro 
gastrointestinal digestion of the orange juices, the flavanones able to permeate 
through a dialysis membrane, and those remaining in the retentate were evaluated 
by HPLC as were those present in the insoluble fraction. In all of the assayed 
orange juices, a high content of precipitated chalcones ( approximately 70% of 
the total flavanones) was formed under the physiological conditions of the 
gastrointestinal tract. Hand squeezing provided a higher concentration of 
flavanones in the permeated fraction and lower transformation to chalcones than 
industrial squeezing. Standard pasteurization did not influence the solubility 
and permeability of the orange juice flavanones and chalcones. Industrial 
concentration did not affect the amount of flavanones able to permeate but 
decreased the chalcones produced. Juices produced from frozen orange juice 
contained considerably smaller amounts of both soluble flavanones and insoluble 
chalcones.

We describe a reversed-phase HPLC method that uses gradient elution and diode 
array detection to quantitate eight biologically active phenolic constitutions 
of wine: the cis and trans isomers of resveratrol and their glucosides, 
catechin, epicatechin, quercetin, and rutin. ODS Hypersil served as the 
stationary phase; the gradient was formed by acetic acid, methanol and water. 
Each analysis required an equilibration period of ten minutes and a run time of 
fourty minutes for completion. Satisfactory peak resolution was achieved 
following direct injection of a 20-muL sample, and validation was accomplished 
by on-line spectral comparisons with known standards. Excellent linearity was 
obtained for all constituents, and the detection limits ranged from 30 mug/L 
(trans-resveratrol) to 1.5 mg/L (catechin). Recoveries approximated 100% range 
(95.2-105.5%), and the method provided good precision, with coefficients of 
variation between 1.17 and 3.38%. All of the phenolics measured were reasonably 
stable in opened wines protected against sunlight for up to 1 week at room 
temperature or 4 degrees C, but most showed losses of 10-40% when stored for 6 
weeks at either temperature.

The concentrations of 11 phenols and 5 furans were measured in 12 categories of 
distilled spirits by HPLC methodology, together with the total antioxidant 
status (TAS) of the same beverages. Ellagic acid was the phenol present in 
highest concentration in all beverages. Moderate amounts of syringaldehyde, 
syringic acid, and gallic acid, as well as lesser amounts of vanillin and 
vanillic acid, were measurable in most samples of whiskey, brandy, and rum but 
were largely undetectable in gin, vodka, liqueurs, and miscellaneous spirits. 
5-(Hydroxymethyl)furfural was the predominant furan in the former three 
beverages, notably cognac, with 2-furaldehyde the next highest, but these were 
undetectable in most of the latter beverages. Highest TAS values were given by 
armagnac, cognac, and bourbon whiskey, all three of which tended toward the 
highest concentrations of phenols. Negative TAS values were exhibited by rum, 
vodka, gin, and miscellaneous spirits in line with the low or undetectable 
phenol concentrations in these beverages. Wood aging is the most likely source 
of phenols and furans in distilled spirits. Those beverages exposed to this 
treatment contain significant antioxidant activity, which is between the ranges 
for white and red wines, with the potential to augment the antiatherosclerotic 
functions attributable to the ethanol that they contain.

This study investigated the effect of both the degree of ripening of the olive 
fruit and irrigation management-rain-fed, two different regulated deficit 
irrigations (RDI), the method proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations (known as FAO), and 125 FAO (125% FAO)-on the phenolic and 
volatile composition of Cornicabra virgin olive oils obtained during two crop 
seasons. Secoiridoid phenolic derivatives greatly decreased upon increase of 
both irrigation and ripening, for example, the 3,4-DHPEA-EDA content decreased 
from 770 to 450 mg/kg through fruit ripening under rain-fed conditions and from 
676 to 388 mg/kg from rain-fed conditions to FAO irrigation treatment (at a 
ripeness index of approximately 4). Moreover, secoiridoid derivatives of 
hydroxytyrosol decreased more than those of tyrosol. The levels of major 
volatile components decreased in the course of ripening but were higher in 
irrigated olive oils: for example, the E-2-hexenal content ranged between 4.2 
and 2.6 mg/kg (expressed as 4-methyl-2-pentanol) over fruit maturation under 
rain-fed conditions and between 8.0 and 3.5 mg/kg under FAO scheduling. It is 
important to note that where water was applied only from the beginning of August 
(RDI-2), when oil begins to accumulate in the fruit, the resulting virgin olive 
oil presented a phenol and volatile profile similar to those of the FAO and 125 
FAO methods, but with a considerable reduction in the amount of water supplied 
to the olive orchard.

The phenolic compounds hydroxycinnamates, anthocyanins, flavonols, and 
flavan-3-ols of sweet cherry cultivars Burlat, Saco, Summit, and Van harvested 
in 2001 and 2002 were quantified by HPLC-DAD. Phenolics were analyzed at 
partially ripe and ripe stages and during storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C (room 
temperature) and 1-2 degrees C (cool temperature). Neochlorogenic and 
p-coumaroylquinic acids were the main hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, but 
chlorogenic acid was also identified in all cultivars. The 3-glucoside and 
3-rutinoside of cyanidin were the major anthocyanins. Peonidin and pelargonidin 
3-rutinosides were the minor anthocyanins, and peonidin 3-glucoside was also 
present in cvs. Burlat and Van. Epicatechin was the main monomeric flavan-3-ol 
with catechin present in smaller amounts in all cultivars. The flavonol rutin 
was also detected. Cultivar Saco contained the highest amounts of phenolics [227 
mg/100 g of fresh weight (fw)] and cv. Van the lowest (124 mg/100 g of fw). 
Phenolic acid contents generally decreased with storage at 1-2 degrees C and 
increased with storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C. Anthocyanin levels increased at 
both storage temperatures. In cv. Van the anthocyanins increased up to 5-fold 
during storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C (from 47 to 230 mg/100 g of fw). Flavonol 
and flavan-3-ol contents remained quite constant. For all cultivars the levels 
of phenolic acids were higher in 2001 and the anthocyanin levels were higher in 
2002, which suggest a significant influence of climatic conditions on these 
compounds.

Chlorogenic acid, the ester of caffeic acid with quinic acid, is one of the most 
abundant polyphenols in the human diet with coffee, fruits and vegetables as its 
major sources. Its antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties have been well 
established in animal studies. However, little is known about its gut absorption 
and metabolism. In the present work, four groups of rats (n = 8) were fed a diet 
supplemented with chlorogenic, caffeic or quinic acids (250 micromol/d) or an 
unsupplemented diet for 8 d. Parent compounds and their metabolites were 
estimated in urine (24-h collection) and plasma by HPLC-electrospray 
ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Significant differences in their levels 
were observed among the groups. The recovery of chlorogenic acid in urine was 
low (0.8%, mol/mol), and the total urinary excretion of caffeic acid liberated 
by hydrolysis of chlorogenic acid and its tissular methylated metabolites 
(ferulic and isoferulic acids) did not account for >0.5% (mol/mol) of the dose 
ingested. On the other hand, the metabolites of microbial origin, namely, 
m-coumaric acid and derivatives of phenylpropionic, benzoic and hippuric acids, 
represented the major compounds in both urine and plasma. Hippuric acid largely 
originated from the transformation of the quinic acid moiety, and all other 
metabolites from the caffeic acid moiety. These microbial metabolites accounted 
for 57.4% (mol/mol) of the chlorogenic acid intake. Such a high abundance of 
microbial metabolites shows that the bioavailability of chlorogenic acid depends 
largely on its metabolism by the gut microflora. Their potential importance in 
explaining the biological effects of dietary polyphenols is emphasized.

The fate of anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and ellagitannins was studied following 
the consumption of 300 g of raspberries by healthy human volunteers and subjects 
with an ileostomy. Postingestion plasma and urine from the former and ileal 
fluid and urine from the latter group were collected and analyzed by 
HPLC-PDA-MS(2). Plasma from the healthy volunteers did not contain detectable 
quantities of either the native raspberry polyphenolics or their metabolites. 
The three main raspberry anthocyanins were excreted in urine in both healthy and 
ileostomy volunteers 0-7 h after ingestion, in quantities corresponding to <0.1% 
of intake. This indicates a low level of absorption in the small intestine. With 
ileostomy volunteers 40% of anthocyanins and 23% of the ellagitannin sanguiin 
H-6 were recovered in ileal fluid with the main excretion period being the first 
4 h after raspberry consumption. The recovery of ellagic acid in ileal fluid was 
241%, indicating hydrolysis of ellagitannins in the stomach and/or the small 
intestine. Urinary excretion of ellagic acid and an ellagic acid-O-glucuronide 
was <1% of intake. No intact or conjugated forms of ellagitannins were detected 
in urine from either healthy subjects or ileostomy volunteers. However, in 
healthy subjects, but not the ileostomists, ellagitannins were catabolized with 
the appearance of urolithin A-O-glucuronide, two of its isomers, and urolithin 
B-O-glucuronide in urine collected 7-48 h after raspberry consumption. There was 
marked variation in the urolithin profile of individual volunteers, indicating 
differences in the colonic microflora responsible for ellagitannin degradation.

Recent studies have shown that dietary fiber and polyphenols of vegetables and 
fruits improve lipid metabolism and prevent the oxidation of low density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which hinder the development of 
atherosclerosis. The goal of this study was to measure the total polyphenol and 
dietary fiber contents of some tropical fruits (i.e., pineapple, wax apple, 
rambutan, lichi, guava, and mango) and compare the results to the content of 
these substances in the better characterized persimmon. It was found that lichi, 
guava, and ripe mango (cv. Keaw) have 3.35, 4.95, and 6.25 mg of total 
polyphenols in 100 g fresh fruit, respectively. This is significantly higher 
than in persimmon, pineapple, wax apple, mature green mango, and rambutan [P < 
0.0005 for pineapple (Smooth Cayene variant), wax apple, persimmon, rambutan, 
mature green mango (cv. Keaw); the value of P < 0.001 is found only for 
pineapple (Phuket, Queen variant)]. The same relationship was observed for the 
contents of gallic acid and of dietary fiber. It can be supposed that among the 
studied fruit, lichi, guava, and ripe mango may be preferable for dietary 
prevention of atherosclerosis.

Mg, Ca, Fe, and Mn in whole persimmons, their pulps, and peels were 
significantly higher than in whole apples, pulps, and peels (P < 0.01-0.0025). 
Conversely, the contents of Cu and Zn were higher in apples than in persimmons. 
In persimmons and apples all of the above components were higher in their peels 
than in whole fruits and pulps. The relatively high contents of dietary fibers, 
total and major phenolics, main minerals, and trace elements make persimmon 
preferable for an antiatherosclerotic diet.

Polish garlic and white and red onions were subjected to blanching, boiling, 
frying, and microwaving for different periods of time, and then their bioactive 
compounds (polyphenols, flavonoids, flavanols, anthocyanins, tannins, and 
ascorbic acid) and antioxidant activities were determined. It was found that 
blanching and frying and then microwaving of garlic and onions did not decrease 
significantly the amounts of their bioactive compounds and the level of 
antioxidant activities ( P > 0.05). The HPLC profiles of free and soluble ester- 
and glycoside-bound phenolic acids showed that trans-hydroxycinnamic acids 
(caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic) were as much as twice higher in 
garlic than in onions. Quercetin quantity was the highest in red onion among the 
studied vegetables. The electrophoretic separation of nonreduced garlic and 
onion proteins after boiling demonstrated their degradation in the range from 50 
to 112 kDa.

Late-season berry dehydration (LSD) is a common occurrence in Shiraz grapes, 
particularly those grown in hot climates. LSD results in significant yield 
reductions; however, the effects on wine composition and sensory characteristics 
are not well-documented. Wines made of 100% nonshriveled clusters (control) were 
related to red fruit flavors by the sensory panel, whereas wines made of 80% 
shriveled clusters (S-VCT) were perceived as more alcoholic and associated with 
dark fruit and dead/stewed fruit characters. The latter wines also resulted in 
higher concentrations of massoia lactone and γ-nonalactone, compounds known to 
contribute to prune and stewed-fruit aromas. Wines made of shriveled grapes were 
also characterized by an increase in C6-alcohols and a decrease in esters, 
whereas wine terpenoids were altered compound-specific. An increase in orange 
pigments and wine chemical age in S-VCT wines indicated faster oxidative aging 
compared to the control. LSD appeared to alter final wine composition directly 
but also appeared to influence yeast metabolism, potentially due to an 
alteration of the composition of lipids in the grape juice. This study 
emphasized the relevance of sorting shriveled and nonshriveled berries for final 
wine chemical composition and wine style.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the present work was to evaluate the phytochemical 
profile and the antioxidant activity of strawberry fruit (cv. Camarosa) upon 
postharvest ripening at room temperature (20 °C) and to correlate them with 
qualitative attributes.
RESULTS: 'Camarosa' fruit retained an appreciable postharvest performance for up 
to 1 day shelf life; thereafter substantial quality deterioration was observed. 
An increased phenolic content, mainly attributed to hydroxycinnamic acids, 
flavonols and anthocyanins, was monitored after 3 days maintenance at 20 °C. The 
chromatographic fingerprint of athocyanins showed that pelargonidin-3-glucoside 
was the major anthocyanin, which increased with the increase of shelf life 
period, while cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside were found at 
lower concentrations. The potent radical scavenging activity, evaluated with 
four in vitro assays, showed a higher antioxidant capacity after 3 and 1 days of 
shelf life. In addition, the antioxidant effect of strawberry fruit extracts on 
lipid substrates and on an emulsion system showed a significant inhibition in 
the formation of conjugated diene hyperoxides. Interestingly, no direct 
correlation between the phytochemical profile and the quality attributes exist.
CONCLUSION: 'Camarosa' fruit had acceptable quality attributes for fresh 
consumption and at the same time a high phytochemical content up to 1 day shelf 
life. The over-ripe fruit continued to be an excellent reservoir of natural 
antioxidants, pointing to its potential use as food antioxidant and nutritional 
supplement.

Quercetin-4'-glucoside is a major flavonol in onions, and this study 
investigated the absorption and fate of radiolabeled quercetin-4'-glucoside in 
rats. Rats ingested [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside and the distribution of 
radioactivity throughout the body was determined after 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 h. The 
gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, and plasma were extracted, and 
radiolabeled components were identified and quantified using high-performance 
liquid chromatography with on-line radioactivity detection and tandem mass 
spectrometry. Two hours after dosing, all the [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside 
had been metabolized. More than 85% of the ingested radioactivity was present in 
the gastrointestinal tract at all time points with approximately 6% being 
absorbed and present in blood and internal organs, primarily the liver and 
kidneys. More than 95% of the absorbed radioactivity was in the form of >20 
different methylated glucuronated and/or sulfated quercetin conjugates. Five 
hours after ingestion, the main radiolabeled metabolites were quercetin 
diglucuronides in the gut, liver, and kidneys and glucuronyl sulfates of 
methylated quercetin in plasma. The main site of quercetin metabolism seemed to 
be the gastrointestinal tract. Quercetin metabolites may have a major influence 
on the gut mucosal epithelium and on colonic disease.

BACKGROUND: Kiwifruit is nutrient-rich but prone to postharvest spoilage. 
Conventional juicing results in a significant loss of bioactive compounds, which 
limits its functional value.
RESULTS: Xuxiang kiwifruit juice was fermented using three lactic acid bacterial 
strains: Limosilactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Weissella. 
The highest fermentation performance was observed in juice fermented with L. 
acidophilus: the viable cell count in the L. acidophilus group was significantly 
higher by 3.54% compared to the Weissella-fermented group, reaching 
(2.8 ± 0.5) × 109 CFU mL-1 (P < 0.001). The total acidity increased by 87.01% 
relative to the unfermented sample, achieving 20.59 ± 0.01 g L-1 (P < 0.001). 
After 32 h of fermentation, the total phenolic content increased by 28.94% 
compared to the control, reaching 3.03 ± 0.03 g L-1 (P < 0.001), while the 
vitamin C content represented a 3.22% improvement over the Weissella group 
(P < 0.001). The succinic acid content increased by 24.32% compared to the 
unfermented control, reaching 1.12 ± 0.01 mg mL-1 (P < 0.0001). Notably, ethyl 
palmitate was produced during fermentation with L. acidophilus, contributing to 
a creamy aroma. During fermentation with Weissella, the contents of glutamate 
and glycine were increased, and the ABTS radical scavenging activity increased 
by 27.89% compared to the unfermented control, reaching 95.06 ± 1.22% 
(P < 0.0001). During fermentation with L. fermentum, the flavonoid content 
increased dramatically by 135.29% relative to the unfermented control, reaching 
0.8 ± 0.05 g L-1 (P < 0.0001). After in vitro digestion, the ABTS radical 
scavenging capacity increased by 11.90% compared to the control, reaching 
83.19 ± 1.27% (P < 0.01), and superoxide dismutase activity increased by 3.82%, 
reaching 30 736 U mL-1 (P < 0.05). Fermentation with L. fermentum elevated key 
aroma compounds, including (E)-2-hexen-1-ol (22.54 ± 0.03%), 1-nonanol 
(1.32 ± 0.02%) and (E)-1-(2,6,6-trimethyl-1,3-cyclohexadien-1-yl)-2-buten-1-one 
(4.06 ± 0.02%). This resulted in an enriched flavor profile characterized by 
grassy, floral and citrus, rose and honey notes, along with an enhanced 
perception of berry-like sweetness.
CONCLUSION: The three lactic acid bacterial strains exhibited distinct 
functional advantages during kiwifruit juice fermentation, and L. fermentum 
demonstrated superior overall performance in both flavor compatibility and 
functional preservation. These results provide a technical basis for the 
development of high-quality probiotic kiwifruit beverages. © 2025 Society of

Proanthocyanidins (PAs) have been shown to have potential health benefits. 
However, no data exist concerning their dietary intake. Therefore, PAs in common 
and infant foods from the U.S. were analyzed. On the bases of our data and those 
from the USDA's Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII) of 
1994-1996, the mean daily intake of PAs in the U.S. population (>2 y old) was 
estimated to be 57.7 mg/person. Monomers, dimers, trimers, and those above 
trimers contribute 7.1, 11.2, 7.8, and 73.9% of total PAs, respectively. The 
major sources of PAs in the American diet are apples (32.0%), followed by 
chocolate (17.9%) and grapes (17.8%). The 2- to 5-y-old age group (68.2 
mg/person) and men >60 y old (70.8 mg/person) consume more PAs daily than other 
groups because they consume more fruit. The daily intake of PAs for 4- to 
6-mo-old and 6- to 10-mo-old infants was estimated to be 1.3 mg and 26.9 mg, 
respectively, based on the recommendations of the American Academy of 
Pediatrics. This study supports the concept that PAs account for a major 
fraction of the total flavonoids ingested in Western diets.

A validated method was developed for the simultaneous determination of the 
hydroxycinnamates caffeic acid (CA), dihydrocaffeic acid (DHCA), ferulic acid 
(FA), dihydroferulic acid (DHFA), and isoferulic acid (IFA) in human plasma as 
metabolites derived from coffee consumption. The method includes a protein 
precipitation step prior to enzymatic hydrolysis of the conjugated metabolites 
(sulfate, glucuronide, and/or ester) back to their aglycone forms. After 
liquid-liquid extraction, the reconstituted extract was analysed by 
high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to negative electrospray 
ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. Calibration curves were constructed from 
spiked human plasma samples in the range of 0-4800 nM for each of the targeted 
analytes. Two internal standards, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid (500 nM) 
and 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid (200 nM), were spiked at the beginning of the 
sample preparation and before analysis, respectively. Good performance data were 
obtained with limits of detection and quantification of the five 
hydroxycinnamates ranging between 1-15 nM and 3-50 nM, respectively. Within and 
between-days precisions were respectively calculated between 8-18% and 8-30% (at 
50 nM added initially), between 6-9% and 6-12% (at 200 nM), and between 5-9% and 
5-9% (at 500 nM). Precision calculated from different analysts ranged from 18% 
to 44% (at 50 nM), from 8% to 16% (at 200 nM), and from 4% to 8% (at 500 nM). 
Using this method, we determined plasma levels in humans and measured the 
efficiency of deconjugation using our enzymatic cocktail.

Processing and storage effects on the ellagitannin composition of processed 
blackberry products.

Changes in blackberry ellagitannin composition in response to juicing (clarified 
and nonclarified), pureeing, canning (in water or syrup), and freezing as well 
as changes in processed products during 6 months of storage were investigated. 
Canning, pureeing, and freezing had little effect on ellagitannins, but 
processing berries into nonclarified and clarified juices resulted in total 
ellagitannin losses of 70 and 82%, respectively, due to removal of 
ellagitannin-rich seeds in the presscake. Minimal changes in total ellagitannin 
content were observed during storage of thermally processed products, but 
compositional changes indicative of ellagitannin depolymerization were apparent. 
The ellagitannin content and composition of frozen berries remained stable over 
6 months of storage. Ellagitannins are well retained in canned, pureed, and 
frozen blackberries, but methods are needed to prevent losses during juice 
processing and/or exploit the ellagitannin-rich coproducts.

The steryl ferulate contents of rye and wheat grains and their milling fractions 
were analyzed using a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic 
(HPLC) method. HPLC-mass spectrometry was used for identification. In addition, 
steryl ferulates of some selected milling byproducts were determined. The total 
steryl ferulate contents of rye and wheat grains were 6.0 and 6.3 mg/100 g, 
respectively. Uneven distribution of steryl ferulates in the grains led to 
considerable differences in the milling products; their steryl ferulate contents 
ranged from trace amounts in flours with low ash content to 20 and 34 mg/100 g 
in rye and wheat brans, respectively. Campestanyl ferulate and sitostanyl 
ferulate were the main components, followed by campesteryl ferulate and 
sitosteryl ferulate, whereas sitosterol was the main component in total sterols. 
Among the other samples, a byproduct of rice milling (pearling dust) was the 
best source of steryl ferulates, its total steryl ferulate content being 119 
mg/100 g, whereas no measurable amounts of steryl ferulates were measured in oat 
bran or pearling dust of barley. The results indicated that rye and wheat and 
especially their bran fractions are comparable to corn as steryl ferulate 
sources.

The amounts of quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol aglycons in 25 edible 
berries were analyzed by an optimized RP-HPLC method with UV detection and 
identified with diode array and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry 
detection. Sixteen species of cultivated berries and nine species of wild 
berries were collected in Finland in 1997. Quercetin was found in all berries, 
the contents being highest in bog whortleberry (158 mg/kg, fresh weight), 
lingonberry (74 and 146 mg/kg), cranberry (83 and 121 mg/kg), chokeberry (89 
mg/kg), sweet rowan (85 mg/kg), rowanberry (63 mg/kg), sea buckthorn berry (62 
mg/kg), and crowberry (53 and 56 mg/kg). Amounts between 14 and 142 mg/kg of 
myricetin were detected in cranberry, black currant, crowberry, bog 
whortleberry, blueberries, and bilberry. Kaempferol was detected only in 
gooseberries (16 and 19 mg/kg) and strawberries (5 and 8 mg/kg). Total contents 
of these flavonols (100-263 mg/kg) in cranberry, bog whortleberry, lingonberry, 
black currant, and crowberry were higher than those in the commonly consumed 
fruits or vegetables, except for onion, kale, and broccoli.

Effects of domestic processing and storage on the flavonols quercetin, 
myricetin, and kaempferol in five berries were studied using an optimized 
RP-HPLC method with UV and diode array detection after an acid hydrolysis of the 
corresponding glycosides. In fresh berries, the total content of flavonols was 
highest in lingonberry (169 mg/kg) and black currant (157 mg/kg), intermediate 
in bilberry (41 mg/kg) and strawberry (17 mg/kg), and lowest in red raspberry 
(9.5 mg/kg). Cooking strawberries with sugar to make jam resulted in minor 
losses (quercetin 15%, kaempferol 18%). During cooking of bilberries with water 
and sugar to make soup, 40% of quercetin was lost. Traditional preservation of 
crushed lingonberries in their own juice caused a considerable (40%) loss of 
quercetin. Only 15% of quercetin and 30% of myricetin present in unprocessed 
berries were retained in juices made by common domestic methods (steam-extracted 
black currant juice, unpasteurized lingonberry juice). Cold-pressing was 
superior to steam-extraction in extracting flavonols from black currants. During 
9 months of storage at 20 C, quercetin content decreased markedly (40%) in 
bilberries and lingonberries, but not in black currants or red raspberries. 
Myricetin and kaempferol were more susceptible than quercetin to losses during 
storage.

We evaluated the absorbability of anthocyanins in humans and rats administered 
with a beverage prepared from an extract of the tuber of purple sweet potato 
(Ipomoea batatas Cultivar Ayamurasaki), or with an anthocyanin concentrate. Two 
major anthocyanin components, cyanidin 
3-O-(2-O-(6-O-(E)-caffeoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside)-5-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside) 
and peonidin 
3-O-(2-O-(6-O-(E)-caffeoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside)-5-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside), 
were detected in the plasma and urine of both rats and humans by HPLC or liquid 
chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The plasma concentration of 
anthocyanins in humans reached a maximum 90 minutes after ingestion, and the 
recovery of anthocyanins in the urine was estimated as 0.01-0.03%. These results 
indicate that acylated anthocyanins could be selectively absorbed after 
ingesting food.

Purification of polar fractions from cacao liquor extracts gave 17 phenolics 
including four new compounds. The new compounds were characterized as a 
C-glycosidic flavan, an O-glycoside of a dimeric and two O-glycosides of 
trimeric A-linked proanthocyanidins, on the basis of spectroscopic data. 
Isolated polyphenols showed inhibitory effects on nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate-dependent lipid peroxidation in microsomes and on the 
autoxidation of linoleic acid. These effects were attributed to the 
radical-scavenging activity in the peroxidation chain reactions, based on the 
findings that the cacao polyphenols effectively scavenged the 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical.

Cassia bark or cortex cinnamomi, the dried stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia Presl. 
(Lauraceae), is a popular natural spice and a commonly used herb in traditional 
Chinese medicine. However, adulterants are frequently found in the market. In 
this study, 44 samples of Cassia bark including bark from seven related 
Cinnamomum species were collected from fields and market. Four characteristic 
components, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, and coumarin were 
determined by RP-HPLC, and a fingerprint comprised of five markers was 
established. These results showed that cassia barks contained high contents of 
cinnamaldehyde (13.01-56.93 mg/g). The highest content of cinnamaldehyde (up to 
93.83 mg/g) was found in debarked cortex, which is traditionally regarded as 
having the best quality in local herb shops. In contrast, the adulterants from 
the other Cinnamomum species, C. wilsonii Camble, C. japonicum Sieb., C. mairei 
Levl. and C. burmanii (Nees) Blume, contained low contents of cinnamaldehyde 
(<2.00 mg/g). The content of cinnamaldehyde in C. loureirii Nees was comparable 
to that in C. cassia. It is suggested that five characteristic peaks by HPLC are 
suitable for distinguishing genuine cassia bark from the adulterants and could 
be applied in the quality control of this commodity.

The antiradical activity of dry beans was evaluated in order to assess the 
validity of this test and to correlate the results with those achieved with the 
Folin-Ciocalteu method and with a rapid spectrophotometric method for the 
analysis of total flavonoids. Four landraces (12 samples) of common beans 
(Phaseolus vulgaris L.), collected in two regions of Italy (Tuscany and 
Basilicata) in three different years, were analyzed. The EC50 values ranged from 
39 to 2810 mg sample/mg 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazil radical. The phenolic 
content of each sample was expressed as gallic acid equivalents; it changed from 
1.17 to 4.40 mg/g. The flavonoid content, expressed as mg of (+)-catechin per g 
of dry seeds, ranged from 0.24 to 1.43 mg/g. The qualiquantitative composition 
of polyphenols has been also elucidated by means of high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC)-diode array detection and HPLC/MS. These investigations 
showed that rapid tests can contribute to assessing the quality of functional 
food.

Soy isoflavones have recently gained considerable interest due to their possible 
health benefits. However, detailed studies on the metabolism of isoflavones are 
lacking. The aims of the investigation presented here were (1) to study the in

characterize the structures of some earlier identified urinary metabolites of 
soy isoflavones, for which no authentic reference compounds have been available. 
Isoflavone standards (1-2 mg) were fermented with human fecal flora (16.7%) for 
24 h. Metabolites formed during the fermentation were tentatively identified by 
interpretation of the mass spectra of trimethylsilylated compounds obtained by 
GC-MS. Compounds having hydroxyl groups at 5-position (i.e., genistein and 
3'-OH-genistein) were completely converted to metabolites that could not be 
detected by the methods used in this study. The metabolism of daidzein and its 
hydroxylated analogues, 3'-OH-daidzein, 6-OH-daidzein, and 8-OH-daidzein, 
occurred to a much lesser extent. Minor amounts of reduced metabolites (i.e., 
isoflavanones and alpha-methyldeoxybenzoins) of these compounds were tentatively 
identified in fermentation extracts. The retention times and the mass spectra of 
reduced isoflavone metabolites, obtained from in vitro fermentations of pure 
compounds, were utilized to identify unknown urinary metabolites of soy 
isoflavones. Four novel isoflavone metabolites were identified in human urine 
collected after soy supplementation: 3' '-OH-O-desmethylangolensin, 
3',4',7-trihydroxyisoflavanone, 4',7,8-trihydroxyisoflavanone, and 
4',6,7-trihydroxyisoflavanone.

Strawberries are known to contain antioxidants, but the significance of 
ingesting antioxidant-rich fruits remains to be established. In order to 
determine whether the consumption of strawberries impacted measures of in vivo 
antioxidant capacity, frozen strawberries (250 g) were administered daily for 3 
weeks to 21 healthy female volunteers. Compliance was confirmed by quantitating 
pelargonidin-glucuronide, urolithin A-glucuronide, and 
2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3-[(2)H]furanone-glucuronide in plasma and urine by 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and antioxidant capacity in serum 
measured by the increase in lag phase of low-density lipoprotein after copper 
sulfate exposure, DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes, and activity of phase II 
enzymes. Among these measures lipid peroxidation lag time increased by 20% (P < 
.01), whereas other measures did not change significantly. The potent 
antioxidant defenses in humans make determination of changes due to dietary 
ingestion in healthy individuals difficult. In summary, daily consumption of 
strawberries resulted in a modest but significant increase in antioxidant 
capacity in a healthy population.

We determined whether nine common herbs (basil, chili, cilantro, dill, garlic, 
ginger, lemongrass, oregano, and parsley) and one herb mixture (Italian Herbs) 
retain the antioxidant capacity (AC) and content of phenolics and characteristic 
marker compounds during processing to dry and paste forms. Oregano exhibited the 
highest AC among the herbs tested in dry and fresh forms. Compared with fresh 
herbs, the AC in dry form was decreased in garlic, chili, dill, oregano and 
parsley and paste form of oregano and basil. With the exception of dried garlic 
and lemongrass in fresh and paste form, all herbs in dry, paste, and fresh form 
contained significant AC. The AC was correlated significantly to the total 
phenolic content in both dry and fresh form. However, there was no significant 
correlation between the AC and the concentration of chemical marker compounds. 
In summary, processed herbs contribute significant amounts of AC to the diet.

Catechins, compounds that belong to the flavonoid class, are potentially 
beneficial to human health. To enable an epidemiological evaluation of 
catechins, data on their contents in foods are required. HPLC with UV and 
fluorescence detection was used to determine the levels of (+)-catechin, 
(-)-epicatechin, (+)-gallocatechin (GC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), 
(-)-epicatechin gallate (ECg), and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) in 8 
types of black tea, 18 types of red and white wines, apple juice, grape juice, 
iced tea, beer, chocolate milk, and coffee. Tea infusions contained high levels 
of catechins (102-418 mg of total catechins/L), and tea was the only beverage 
that contained GC, EGC, ECg, and EGCg in addition to (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin. Catechin concentrations were still substantial in red wine 
(27-96 mg/L), but low to negligible amounts were found in white wine, 
commercially available fruit juices, iced tea, and chocolate milk. Catechins 
were absent from beer and coffee. The data reported here provide a base for the 
epidemiological evaluation of the effect of catechins on the risk for chronic 
diseases.

The phenolic profile of strawberry fruits (Fragaria x ananassa Duch., Rosaceae) 
was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array 
detection. A peak displaying retention time and UV spectral data identical to 
those of phloridzin (phloretin 2'-O-beta-d-glucoside), a dihydrochalcone 
glucoside so far considered characteristic of apples, was monitored. For further 
characterization, crude extracts of strawberries were purified on polyamide, and 
the target compound was isolated by preparative and analytical HPLC. Structure 
elucidation was performed on the basis of APCI- and ESI-MS in the negative ion 
mode as well as by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy using authentic phloridzin for 
comparison. The d-configuration of the sugar moiety was established by HPLC 
analysis of the corresponding acyclic 
1-deoxy-1-(N-acetyl-alpha-methylbenzylamino)alditol acetate. Apart from its 
chemotaxonomic relevance, this first report on the occurrence of phloridzin in 
strawberries is of particular interest for the authenticity control of 
strawberry products such as juices, jams, and fruit preparations since 
phloridzin has so far been used for the detection of fraudulent admixtures.

The flavonoids, naringin and naringenin and the furanocoumarin, bergapten 
(5-methoxypsoralen), were detected in some fresh grapefruit and commercial 
grapefruit juices but were not detected in other fruit juices tested (orange; 
orange with apple base; dark grape; orange and mango with apple base; orange, 
peach, passion fruit juice). The contents of these three grapefruit constituents 
in commercial juice and fresh grapefruit varied from brand to brand and also 
from lot to lot. Juice was prepared from the fresh fruit via different methods 
(by hand, squeezer or blender). The naringin content, after hand-squeeze, ranged 
from 115 to 384 mg/l. With hand-squeeze juice production, bergapten was not 
detected (less than 0.5 mg/l) in two varieties of grapefruit, and naringenin was 
usually not in detectable levels (less than 2 mg/l) in three varieties. All 
three constituents were present in New Zealand grapefruit preparations 
(including juice by hand-squeeze) and different lots showed variation in content 
(1.5-, 2.3- and 4.7-fold for naringin, naringenin and bergapten, respectively). 
Differences in the concentrations of these three constituents, which have 
potential for drug interaction, may contribute to the variability in 
pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 drugs and some contradictory results of drug 
interaction studies with grapefruit juice.

There is considerable interest in coloured fruits and berries as sources of 
biologically active anthocyanins. To examine the relationship between the oral 
dose and the amount excreted for anthocyanins from a food source across a 
physiological range of doses, volunteers were fed, in random order, four 
portions (100-400 g) of fresh strawberries as part of a standard breakfast. 
Urine was collected at 2 h intervals up to 8 h, and for the period 8-24 h. Fresh 
strawberries contained pelargonidin-3-glucoside as the major anthocyanin with 
smaller amounts of cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside. 
Anthocyanins were detected in the urine of all volunteers for all doses, 
predominantly as pelargonidin glucuronide and sulphate metabolites. There was a 
strong, linear relationship between oral dose and anthocyanin excretion 
(Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient = 0.692, p < 0.001, n = 40) 
which indicated that on an average, every additional unit of dose caused 0.0166 
units of excretion. Within individuals, dose -- excretion data fitted a linear 
regression model (median R(2) = 0.93). We conclude that strawberry anthocyanins 
are partially bioavailable in humans with a linear relationship between oral 
dose and urinary excretion for doses up to 400 g fresh fruit.

The effect of fruit maturation on changes in carotenoids, flavonoids, total 
soluble reducing equivalents, phenolic acids, ascorbic acid, and antioxidant 
activity (AOX) in different pepper types (Capsicum annuum, Capsicum frutescens, 
and Capsicum chinese) was determined. Generally, the concentration of these 
chemical constituents increased as the peppers reached maturity. Peppers 
contained high levels of L-ascorbic acid and carotenoids at maturity, 
contributing 124-338% of the RDA for vitamin C and 0.33-336 RE/100 g of 
provitamin A activity, respectively. Levels of phenolic acids, capxanthin, and 
zeaxanthin generally increased during maturation, whereas the level of lutein 
declined. Flavonoid concentrations varied greatly among the pepper types 
analyzed and were negatively correlated to AOX under the conditions of the 
beta-carotene-linoleic assay. Model systems were used to aid in understanding 
the relationship between flavonoids and AOX. Significant increases in AOX were 
observed in pepper juice models in response to increasing dilution factors and 
the presence of EDTA, indicating a pro-oxidant effect due to metal ions in the 
system. In vitro models demonstrated that increasing levels of flavonoids in 
combination with constant levels of caffeic and ascorbic acid gave a resultant 
AOX that was either additive of the two compounds or competitive in their 
ability to scavenge peroxyl radicals. The model systems were in good agreement 
with the chemical composition of the pepper cultivars and reflected the 
interactions affecting AOX. More research is needed to understand the complex 
interactions that occur among various antioxidants present in pepper extracts.

Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of 11 commercial cultivars and 
15 advanced breeding lines of spinach were determined over two growing seasons 
known to vary in biotic and abiotic stresses. Flavonoid composition and content 
of fall-grown commercial cultivars and advanced breeding lines were also 
determined. Over-winter spinach, which was planted in late fall and harvested in 
the spring, had much higher levels of total phenolics and antioxidant capacity 
than spinach planted in early fall and harvested in late fall, indicating that 
growing conditions, as well as biotic and abiotic stresses, influenced phenolic 
metabolism. Genotype also appeared to play an important role in affecting 
phenolic metabolism and antioxidant capacity in spinach. Advanced breeding lines 
of spinach, which show increased disease resistance, had higher levels of total 
phenolics, individual and total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity than 
commercial cultivars. Our results indicate that plant breeders can select for 
increased phenolic content to increase antioxidant capacity in spinach 
cultivars, or the crops can be grown in different seasons or under certain 
stress conditions to elevate levels of antioxidants.

Fresh blueberries were processed into sugar and sugar-free jams and stored for 6 
months at 4 and 25 degrees C. The jams were analyzed immediately after 
processing and over 6 months of storage for polyphenolic content, percent 
polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity. Processing resulted in losses of 
anthocyanins, procyanidins, chlorogenic acid, and ORAC in both jam types, but 
flavonols were well retained. Marked losses of anthocyanins and procyanidins 
occurred over 6 months of storage and were accompanied by increased polymeric 
color values. Chlorogenic acid levels also declined during storage, but 
flavonols and ORAC changed little. Jams stored at 4 degrees C retained higher 
levels of anthocyanins, procyanidins, and ORAC and had lower polymeric color 
values than jams stored at 25 degrees C. Sugar-free jams retained higher levels 
of anthocyanins and had lower polymeric color values than sugar jams late during 
storage. Blueberry jams should be refrigerated to better retain polyphenolics 
and antioxidant capacity.

Several recent reports have been published indicating that the antioxidant 
activity of olive oil and tea leaves is not stable over product shelf lives of 
about one year. We have measured the antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, 
flavan-3-ols monomers, and procyanidin levels in milk and dark chocolate, in 
cocoa powder, and in cocoa beans. Results show that for the cocoa products 
studied, antioxidant activity, and flavan-3-ol levels are stable over typical 
shelf lives of one year under controlled storage and over 2 years in ambient 
storage in the laboratory. We also show that 80 year old cocoa powder and 116 
year old cocoa beans still show very high levels of antioxidant activity and 
flavan-3-ol content.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of consumption of fermented and unfermented 
soy products on excretion of urinary isoflavonoid phytoestrogens and lignans in 
healthy men.
DESIGN: A randomized, crossover trial consisting of two 9-day feeding periods 
following 5 days of baseline data collection.
SUBJECTS: Healthy men, aged 20 to 40 years, were recruited from the University 
of Minnesota Twin Cities community. Of the 22 subjects who began the study, 17 
completed all feeding periods.
INTERVENTIONS: Fermented soy product (112 g tempeh) or unfermented soy (125 g 
soybean pieces) was consumed during each controlled feeding period.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Urine samples collected while subjects consumed their 
habitual diets and on the last 3 days of each feeding period were analyzed for 
isoflavonoid and lignan content by isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED: Comparisons of isoflavonoid and lignan excretion 
were analyzed using the general linear model procedure. Orthogonal contrasts 
were used to determine treatment differences of interest.
RESULTS: Urinary excretion of isoflavonoids (equol, O-desmethylangolensin 
[O-DMA], daidzein, genistein) was higher and excretion of lignans (enterodiol, 
enterolactone) was lower when subjects consumed soy-supplemented diets than when 
they consumed their habitual diets (P < .05). Urinary isoflavonoid excretion and 
lignan excretion were similar when subjects consumed tempeh and soybean pieces 
diets; however, recovery of daidzein and genistein was significantly higher when 
subjects consumed the tempeh diet than when they consumed the soybean pieces 
diet (P < .002). When fed soy, 5 of 17 subjects excreted high amounts of equol. 
These five subjects tended to excrete less O-DMA and daidzein than the 12 
subjects who excreted low amounts of equol (P < .06).
CONCLUSIONS: Fermentation of soy decreased the isoflavone content of the product 
fed but increased the urinary isoflavonoid recovery. This finding suggests that 
fermentation increases availability of isoflavones in soy.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of vegetable, fruit, and legume consumption on 
urinary isoflavonoid phytoestrogen and lignan excretion.
DESIGN: After 4 days of data collection, during which subjects consumed their 
habitual diets, subjects were randomly placed on four 9-day controlled 
experimental diets with each subject receiving each diet in a random order.
SUBJECTS: Seven men and three women, aged 20 to 35 years, were recruited from 
the University of Minnesota Twin Cities community.
INTERVENTIONS: All subjects consumed four experimental diets in an assigned 
random order: a controlled basal diet, a legume/allium diet (containing garbanzo 
beans, garlic, and onions), and diets low or high in vegetables and fruits 
(containing apples, pears, potatoes, and carrots).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Urine samples that were collected while subjects consumed 
their habitual diets and during the last 3 days of each feeding period were 
analyzed for isoflavonoid and lignan content using isotope dilution gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED: The effect of vegetable and fruit intake on 
urinary isoflavonoid and lignan excretion was analyzed using the general linear 
model procedure. Post hoc comparisons were made using Duncan's multiple range 
test.
RESULTS: Subjects excreted more of the lignan enterodiol on the high 
vegetable/fruit diet compared with the basal and legume/allium diets (P = .03); 
more of the isoflavonoids O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA), genistein, and sum of 
isoflavonoids on the legume/allium diet compared with the other controlled diets 
(P < .05); and more of the isoflavan equol on the basal and legume/allium diets 
compared with the high vegetable/fruit diet (P < .01). Subjects who excreted 
higher levels of equol on the basal and legume/allium diets also consumed more 
of the milk-based pudding provided as part of the controlled diets.
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary lignan and isoflavonoid excretion changed in response to 
alterations in vegetable, fruit, and legume intake under controlled dietary 
conditions.

The study focused on the effects of processing and storage on the stability of 
flaxseed-derived secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) added to various bakery 
products. The SDG concentration of doughs, baked rye breads, graham buns, and 
muffins was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array 
detection; the baked products were analyzed immediately after baking and upon 
storage at room temperature for 1 week and at -25 degrees C for 1 and 2 months, 
respectively. Added SDG was found to withstand normal baking temperatures in all 
bakery products. SDG also was a relatively stable compound during storage. 
Similarly, the content of SDG in flax buns containing fat-free flaxseed meal was 
unaffected by storage. We conclude that cereal-based bakery products can be 
supplemented with flaxseed-derived SDG.

Peanut and its derivatives, especially peanut butter, are extensively consumed 
in many countries, mainly in the United States, which is also the major exporter 
of these products. trans-Resveratrol is present in peanuts, and recently this 
compound has been quantified in peanut butter. It is well-known that there are 
beneficial effects of trans-resveratrol and its glucoside, the piceid, in 
health. The absorption of trans-resveratrol has been proven in animals, and 
certain studies show that the absorption of some phenols is enhanced by 
conjugation with glucose, so that it could be possible that trans-piceid would 
be more absorbed than its aglycon (trans-resveratrol). In our work, we have 
identified the presence of trans-piceid in peanut butter with a new method to 
quantify trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid (3-beta-glucose of 
trans-resveratrol). This fact is very interesting because the glucosilated form 
could be more easily absorbed by the intestinal gut; in this way trans-piceid 
would exercise its beneficial function more efficiently than trans-resveratrol. 
To our knowledge, this is the first time that trans-piceid has been quantified 
in peanut butter. Resveratrol and piceid contents in natural peanut butters were 
found to be significantly higher than those in blended peanut butters.

We previously determined that five rather hydrophobic metabolites appeared in 
blood plasma after oral administration of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 
but a group of hydrophilic metabolites still remained unidentified. In the 
present study, 12 hydrophilic metabolites found were collected from urine and 
plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and then 
analyzed by tandem MS spectrometry. From the MS spectra, four metabolites out of 
12 were assigned as glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and six 
out of 12 were glucuronides of the primary metabolites of cyanidin 
3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside). 
Extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and O-methyl 
cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside showed their maximum plasma concentrations 
at 15 and 60 min (or 30 min) after oral administration, respectively. Their 
maximum plasma concentrations ranged from 15 to 70 nM. From the profile of 
urinary-excreted anthocyanins after intravenous administration, it was deduced 
that extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and O-methyl 
cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside were mainly produced in the liver rather 
than by intestinal flora. The area under the plasma concentration curve was 0.25 
micromol min/L for extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside 
and 0.14 micromol min/L for O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 
respectively, when evaluated as cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside equivalent, 
indicating that extended glucuronidation is a critical pathway in cyanidin 
3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside metabolism in rats.

Total and free phenolic contents of 16 commonly consumed fruits (comprising 9 
apples, 4 pears, and one each of peach, plum, and kiwi fruit cultivars) were 
measured by Folin-Ciocalteu assay. Total phenol contents varied from 272 to 475 
mg of CtE/100 g of fresh weight. Of the apple cultivars studied, Braeburn and 
Empire had the highest and lowest total phenol content, respectively. The apple 
cultivars ranked in the following decreasing order: Braeburn > Red Delicious > 
Crisp Pink > Granny Smith > Royal Gala > Bramley > Golden Delicious > Fuji > 
Empire. Among pear cultivars, the order was Forelle > Taylor's > Peckham's > 
Conference. Peach and plum equally had high contents. The percentage of 
conjugated phenolics ranged between 3 (Red Delicious) and 77% (Empire) of the 
total phenols. Comparison of different cultivars of the same fruit and between 
different fruits showed broad variations in both phenolic content and in vitro 
antioxidant activity; a weak correlation (R(2) = 0.58) was observed between the 
phenolic content of the fruits and the total antioxidant activity, as estimated 
by the FRAP assay. The calculated dietary intake of total, free, and conjugated 
phenols from average per capita consumption of apples and pears in different 
regions of the U.K. varied between 104-126, 53-64, and 51-62 mg of CtE/day, 
respectively.

BACKGROUND: Dry beans and chickpeas are nutritionally valuable legumes widely 
consumed worldwide. This study examines the impact of oven roasting (110 °C for 
70 min) on the phytochemical, antioxidant, fatty acid and saponin profiles of 12 
pulses, including 11 common beans and 1 chickpea.
RESULTS: Roasting significantly affected the phytochemical composition and 
antinutritional factors with distinct variations among samples. Cranberry bean 
CRAN-1 exhibited the highest total phenolic content in raw samples (19.12 g kg-1 
GAE g-1 DW), which decreased by 6.79% post-roasting. Pigmented beans including 
dark red kidney and CRAN-2 showed strong antioxidant activities pre-roasting 
(DPPH scavenging: 73.94% and 50.16%, respectively). CRAN-2 also had the highest 
anthocyanin content (0.057 to 0.036 g kg-1 DW) among pigmented cultivars, which 
decreased slightly after roasting. Non-extractable polymeric proanthocyanins 
remained stable, while saponin content significantly decreased (up to 77% in 
some cultivars), suggesting improved flavor. Stigmasterol and β-sitosterol were 
the predominant phytosterols with enhanced availability after roasting. Fatty 
acid analysis revealed that saturated fatty acids are predominant, ranging from 
54.7% (Manteca) to 70% (Great Northern), while the fatty acid composition was 
similar across all cultivars.
CONCLUSION: These findings underscore that roasting under mild controlled 
conditions retains and improves key bioactive compounds in common bean flours. 
Pigmented varieties, in particular, offer superior antioxidant and phytochemical 
properties. This research provides a foundation for incorporating roasted pulses 
into functional formulations with both dietary and industrial applications. ©

Fresh aerial parts of different chicory varieties: green chicory (c.v. 
""Catalogna""), two red chicory varieties (""radicchio rosso di Chioggia"" and 
""radicchio rosso di Treviso""), and Witloof or Belgian endive were analyzed by 
HPLC/DAD/MS. The chromatographic fingerprint was diagnostic for each variety. A 
monocaffeoyl tartaric acid, chlorogenic acid, and chicoric acid were detected in 
all the varieties, while cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-(6'' malonyl) 
glucoside, and cyanidin 3-O-(6'' malonyl) glucoside were the main phenolic 
compounds in the red varieties. The flavonoidic compounds, quercetin 
3-O-glucuronide and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide, were absent in the Witloof sample. 
The phenolic compounds from total leaves were the same as those obtained from 
only the colored parts; nevertheless, the total amount was remarkably lower with 
a decrease of up to 80% for Belgian endive. Chemical stability at high 
temperature was observed for the phenolic fraction from the green variety after 
decoction at 100 degrees C for 30 min.

Sterol ferulate, free sterol, and 5-alk(en)ylresorcinol constituents of wheat, 
rye, and corn bran oils were studied. Among the sterol ferulates, one novel 
compound, 24-methylenecholestanol ferulate (7), along with six known compounds, 
namely, 24-methylcholestanol ferulate (1), 24-methylcholesterol ferulate (2), 
2-methyllathosterol ferulate (3), stigmastanol ferulate (4), sitosterol ferulate 
(5), and schottenol ferulate (6), were isolated and characterized. Five known 
free sterols, namely, 24-methylcholesterol (8), stigmastanol (9), sitosterol 
(10), schottenol (11), and stigmasterol (12), were isolated and identified. 
5-Alk(en)ylresorcinols were found in wheat and rye bran oils but not in corn 
bran oil. Of these, one new compound, 5-n-(2'-oxo-14'-Z-heneicosenyl) resorcinol 
(19), and seven known compounds, namely, 5-n-heptadecyl- (13), 5-n-nonadecyl- 
(14), 5-n-heneicosyl- (15), 5-n-tricosyl- (16), 5-n-pentacosyl- (17), 
5-n-(14'-Z-nonadecenyl)- (18), and 5-n-(2'-oxoheneicosyl)resorcinols (20), were 
isolated and characterized. These compounds were evaluated with respect to their 
inhibitory effects on the induction of Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) 
by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells, which is known to 
be a primary screening test for antitumor promoters. Four compounds, 1, 2, 4, 
and 11, showed potent inhibitory effects on EBV-EA induction.

Methods were developed for the analysis of natural antioxidants including 
phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beverages and plant extracts using gradient 
HPLC with multi-channel electrochemical coulometric detection. Suitability of 
various reversed-phase columns for this purpose was compared; pH and mobile 
phase gradients were optimized with respect to the separation selectivity and 
sensitivity of detection. Because of different target compounds in various 
sample types, the overlapping resolution maps and the normalized resolution 
product approaches described earlier were used to select optimum columns and 
gradients to suit the analysis of the individual sample types. The methods were 
applied to the analysis of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beer, wine, tea, 
and yacon extracts. 32 phenolic compounds were identified and determined, 
including derivatives of benzoic and cinnamic acids, flavones, and a few related 
glycosides. Eight-channel CoulArray detection offers high selectivity and 
sensitivity with limits of detection in the low microg L(-1) range, at least an 
order of magnitude lower than single-channel coulometric detection using the 
Coulochem detector. No special sample pretreatment is necessary and, because of 
the compatibility of the CoulArray detector with gradient elution, phenolic 
antioxidants of different polarities can be determined in a single run. In 
addition to the retention times, the ratios of the areas of the pre-dominant and 
post-dominant peaks to the area of the dominant peak can be used for improved 
identification of natural antioxidants.

The metabolic fate of the dietary isoflavones daidzein and genistein was 
investigated in human volunteers challenged with soya. Urinary diphenols, 
isolated by partition chromatography on Sephadex LH-20, were characterized and 
identified by profile capillary gas chromatography (GC) and electron ionization 
mass spectrometry (GC-EIMS) analysis of the trimethylsilyl ether (TMS) 
derivatives. Novel isoflavonic phytoestrogens found in the urine of volunteers 
were those of tetrahydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, 
6'-hydroxy-O-demethylangolesin and 2-dehydro-O-demethylangolensin. Other known 
diphenols identified were those of equal, dehydrodaidzein, O-demethylangolensin, 
daidzein, genistein, glycitein, and the lignan enterolactone. Two other urinary 
isomers with a fragmentation pattern closely resembling that of the persilylated 
TMS ethers of cis/trans-isomers of tetrahydrodaidzein, were characterized based 
on the elucidation of fragments associated with the loss of a non-phenolic-OTMS 
functional group in ring-C. These are fragments presented in the persilylated 
mass spectra of isoflavan-4-ols and isoflav-3-ene-4-ols, demonstrated here by a 
combination of simple and tandem mass spectrometry study of the deuterated 
persilylated TMS ethers of dihydrodaidzein. In a similar study we also present 
the data on the structural identification and fragment elucidation of the 
keto/enol tautomers of the TMS ether derivatives of the dihydro derivatives of 
daidzein and genistein, observed in the urine of volunteers and considered 
probable products of the derivatization process. Finally, the GC and GC-MS data 
of two unknown isoflavonoids and that of a lignan-like compound are presented 
together with those of dihydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, tetrahydrodaidzein and 
2-dehydro-O-demethylangolensin. The latter four were obtained here as products 
of small scale chemical synthesis in a preliminary study on the tentative 
identification of urinary isoflavonoids in human volunteers challenged with 
soya.

A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separation method with 
photo-diode array (PDA) and mass spectrometric (MS) detection was developed to 
determine and quantify flavonols, flavones, and flavanones in fruits, vegetables 
and beverages. The compounds were analysed as aglycones, obtained after acid 
hydrolysis of freeze-dried food material. Identification was based on retention 
time, UV and mass spectra by comparison with commercial standards, and the UV 
peak areas were used for quantitation of the flavonoid contents. Examples of 
HPLC-MS, analyses of orange pulp, tomato, and apple are presented. The method 
has been used to screen foods on the Danish market, and the contents of 
flavones, flavonols, and flavanones were measured.

A field experiment and two oxidation experiments in the laboratory were carried 
out. The content of the major anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-G) and 
cyanidin-3-sambubioside (Cy-3-Sa), in the fresh fruits from the 13 cultivars 
were from 361 to 1266 and from 269 to 656 mg/100 g, respectively. The two minor 
anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-sambubioside-5-glucoside (Cy-3-Sa-5-G) and 
cyanidin-3.5-diglucoside (Cy-3.5-dG), occurred in concentrations between 5 and 
47 mg/100 g. The content of ascorbic acid and quercetin in the fresh fruits of 
the cultivars varied from 6 to 25, and from 29 to 60 mg/100 g, respectively. 
Purging of the elderberry juice with N2 and/or addition of ascorbic acid reduced 
the oxidative degradation rate of the two major anthocyanins and quercetin. 
Ascorbic acid protected the anthocyanins, but not quercetin from oxidative 
degradation. Mixing of fruits with air during processing and even a low content 
of oxygen in the juice before tapping must be avoided by appropriate steps 
during processing. Improvement of the nutritional value of the elderberry juice 
and increased protection of anthocyanins against oxidative degradation may 
potentially be obtained by selection of cultivars with a high content of 
ascorbic acid.

Fresh strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.), raspberries (Rubus idaeus 
Michx.), highbush blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum L.), and lowbush blueberries 
(Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton) were stored at 0, 10, 20, and 30 degrees C for 
up to 8 days to determine the effects of storage temperature on whole fruit 
antioxidant capacity (as measured by the oxygen radical absorbing capacity 
assay, Cao et al., Clin. Chem. 1995, 41, 1738-1744) and total phenolic, 
anthocyanin, and ascorbate content. The four fruit varied markedly in their 
total antioxidant capacity, and antioxidant capacity was strongly correlated 
with the content of total phenolics (0.83) and anthocyanins (0.90). The 
antioxidant capacity of the two blueberry species was about 3-fold higher than 
either strawberries or raspberries. However, there was an increase in the 
antioxidant capacity of strawberries and raspberries during storage at 
temperatures >0 degrees C, which was accompanied by increases in anthocyanins in 
strawberries and increases in anthocyanins and total phenolics in raspberries. 
Ascorbate content differed more than 5-fold among the four fruit species; on 
average, strawberries and raspberries had almost 4-times more ascorbate than 
highbush and lowbush blueberries. There were no ascorbate losses in strawberries 
or highbush blueberries during 8 days of storage at the various temperatures, 
but there were losses in the other two fruit species. Ascorbate made only a 
small contribution (0.4-9.4%) to the total antioxidant capacity of the fruit. 
The increase observed in antioxidant capacity through postharvest phenolic 
synthesis and metabolism suggested that commercially feasible technologies may 
be developed to enhance the health functionality of small fruit crops.

Olive oil and fruit samples from six cultivars sampled at four different 
maturity stages were discriminated into cultivars and maturity stages. The 
variables-volatile and phenolic compounds-that significantly (p < 0.01) 
discriminated cultivars and maturity stage groups were identified. Separation by 
stepwise linear discriminant analysis revealed that Manzanilla olive cultivar 
was separated from cultivars Leccino, Barnea, Mission, Corregiola, and Paragon, 
whereas cultivars Corregiola and Paragon formed a cluster. The volatile 
compounds hexanol, hexanal, and 1-penten-3-ol were responsible for the 
discrimination of cultivars. All maturity stages were discriminated, with the 
separation of early stages attributed to oil phenolic compounds, tyrosol and 
oleuropein derivatives, whereas the volatile compounds (E)-2-hexenal, hexanol, 
1-penten-3-ol, and (Z)-2-penten-3-ol characterized the separation of all 
maturity stages and in particular the late stages. Hexanol and 1-penten-3-ol 
characterized the separation of both cultivars and maturity stages.

Virgin olive oils produced at wide ranges of malaxation temperatures (15, 30, 
45, and 60 degrees C) and times (30, 60, 90, and 120 min) in a complete 
factorial experimental design were discriminated with stepwise linear 
discriminant analysis (SLDA) revealing differences with processing conditions. 
Virgin olive oils produced at 15 and 60 degrees C for 30 min showed the most 
significant (p < 0.01) differences. Discrimination was based upon volatile and 
phenolic compounds detected in olive oils, peroxide value (PV), free fatty acids 
(FFA), ultraviolet (UV) absorbances, and oil yield. There were different 
discriminating variables for processing conditions illustrating the dependence 
of virgin olive oil quality on malaxation time and temperature. Volatile 
compounds were the dominant discriminating variables. Common oxidation 
indicators of olive oil (PV, K232, and K270) were not among the variables that 
significantly (p < 0.01) changed with malaxation time and temperature. Variables 
that discriminated both malaxation time and temperature were hexanal, 
3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ethyl alcohol-decarboxymethyl elenolic acid dialdehyde 
(3,4-DHPEA-DEDA) and FFA, whereas 1-penten-3-ol, E-2-hexenal, octane, tyrosol, 
and vanillic acid significantly (p < 0.01) changed with temperature only and 
Z-2-penten-1-ol, (+)-acetoxypinoresinol, and oil yield changed with time only. 
Virgin olive oil quality was significantly influenced by malaxation temperature, 
whereas oil yield discriminated malaxation time. This study demonstrates the two 
modes of hexanal formation: enzymatic and nonenzymatic during virgin olive oil 
extraction.

Rice grain is widely consumed as a staple food, providing essential nutrition 
for households, particularly marginalized families. It plays a crucial role in 
ensuring food security, promoting human nutrition, supporting good health, and 
contributing to global food and nutritional security. Addressing the diverse 
quality demands of emerging diverse and climate-risked population dietary needs 
requires the development of a single variety of rice grain that can meet the 
various dietary and nutritional requirements. However, there is a lack of 
concrete definition for rice grain quality, making it challenging to cater to 
the different demands. The lack of sufficient genetic study and development in 
improving rice grain quality has resulted in widespread malnutrition, hidden 
hunger, and micronutrient deficiencies affecting a significant portion of the 
global population. Therefore, it is crucial to identify genetically evolved 
varieties with marked qualities that can help address these issues. Various 
factors account for the declining quality of rice grain and requires further 
study to improve their quality for healthier diets. We characterized rice grain 
quality using Lancastrians descriptor and a multitude of intrinsic and extrinsic 
quality traits. Next, we examined various components of rice grain quality 
favored in the Asia-Pacific region. This includes preferences by different 
communities, rice industry stakeholders, and value chain actors. We also 
explored the biological aspects of rice grain quality in the region, as well as 
specific genetic improvements that have been made in these traits. Additionally, 
we evaluated the factors that can influence rice grain quality and discussed the 
future directions for ensuring food and nutritional security and meeting 
consumer demands for grain quality. We explored the diverse consumer bases and 
their varied preferences in Asian-Pacific countries including India, China, 
Nepal, Bhutan, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, 
Bangladesh, Indonesia, Korea, Myanmar and Japan. The quality preferences 
encompassed a range of factors, including rice head recovery, grain shape, 
uniform size before cooking, gelatinization, chalkiness, texture, amylose 
content, aroma, red-coloration of grain, soft and shine when cooked, unbroken 
when cooked, gelatinization, less water required for cooking, gelatinization 
temperature (less cooking time), aged rice, firm and dry when cooked (gel 
consistency), extreme white, soft when chewed, easy-to-cook rice (parboiled 
rice), vitamins, and minerals. These preferences were evaluated across high, 
low, and medium categories. A comprehensive analysis is provided on the 
enhancement of grain quality traits, including brown rice recovery, recovery 
rate of milled rice, head rice recovery, as well as morphological traits such as 
grain length, grain width, grain length-width ratio, and grain chalkiness. We 
also explored the characteristics of amylose, gel consistency, gelatinization 
temperature, viscosity, as well as the nutritional qualities of rice grains such 
as starch, protein, lipids, vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and 
bio-fortification potential. The various factors that impact the quality of rice 
grains, including pre-harvest, post-harvest, and genotype considerations were 
explored. Additionally, we discussed the future direction and genetic strategies 
to effectively tackle these challenges. These qualitative characteristics 
represent the fundamental focus of regional and national breeding strategies 
employed by different countries to meet consumer preference. Given the 
significance of rice as a staple food in Asia-Pacific countries, it is primarily 
consumed domestically, with only a small portion being exported internationally. 
All the important attributes must be clearly defined within specific parameters. 
It is crucial for geneticists and breeders to develop a rice variety that can 
meet the diverse demands of consumers worldwide by incorporating multiple 
desirable traits. Thus, the goal of addressing global food and nutritional 
security, and human healthy can be achieved.

The bioavailability of polyphenols in human and rodents has been discussed 
regarding their biological activity. We found different metabolite profiles of 
quercetin in rat plasma between two administration procedures. A single 
intragastric administration (50 mg/kg) resulted in the appearance of a variety 
of metabolites in the plasma, whereas only a major fraction was detected by free 
access (1% quercetin). The methylated/non-methylated metabolites ratio was much 
higher in the free access group. Mass spectrometric analyses showed that the 
fraction from free access contained highly conjugated quercetin metabolites such 
as sulfo-glucuronides of quercetin and methylquercetin. The metabolite profile 
of human plasma after an intake of onion was similar to that with intragastric 
administration in rats. In vitro oxidation of human low-density lipoprotein 
showed that methylation of the catechol moiety of quercetin significantly 
attenuated the antioxidative activity. These results might provide information 
about the bioavailability of quercetin when conducting animal experiments.

Anthocyanins are reported to have many ""health promoting"" properties; however, 
despite numerous reports of their bioactivities, their absorption and metabolism 
in humans are poorly understood. The objective of this research was to detail 
the pharmacokinetic parameters of anthocyanins after the administration of a 
721-mg oral dose of cyanidin 3-glycosides from chokeberry extract to human 
subjects. Solid-phase extraction, preparative-HPLC, preparative-TLC, HPLC-diode 
array detection, HPLC-MS, and NMR were utilized to isolate, identity, and 
quantify anthocyanins in 0- to 7-h (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 h) serum and 0- to 
24-h urine samples (total individual urine voids over 24 h). The cumulative 
concentration of total anthocyanins (parent and metabolites) detected in the 
serum (0-7 h) was 376.65 +/- 16.20 (nmol x h)/L (area under the concentration 
time curve), reaching a maximum concentration (C(max) = 96.08 +/- 6.04 nmol/L) 
within 2.8 h. The parent anthocyanins represented only 32.0% [120.63 +/- 2.85 
(nmol x h)/L] of the total anthocyanins detected with 68.0% [256.02 +/- 5.23 
(nmol x h) identified as conjugated metabolites. Additionally, the total urinary 
excretion of anthocyanins over 24 h was 1071.54 +/- 375.46 microg, reaching a 
maximal rate of excretion (R(max) = 202.74 +/- 85.06 microg/h) at 3.72 +/- 0.83 
h. Parallel to the serum data, only 32.5% (347.85 +/- 60.61 microg) of the 
anthocyanins excreted in the urine (total 24 h) were the parent compounds with 
67.5% (723.69 +/- 92.59 microg) occurring as conjugated metabolites. The 
metabolites were identified as glucuronidated and methylated derivatives of the 
parent cyanidin 3-glycosides. The above results indicate that cyanidin 
3-glycosides are rapidly absorbed and metabolized extensively following a 
moderate-to-high oral dose in humans.

Levels of total phenol, catechins, and caffeine in teas commonly consumed in the 
United Kingdom have been determined using reversed phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography. Tea bags or tea leaves were purchased from local supermarkets 
and extracted in boiling water for 5 min. The resulting data showed considerable 
variability in both total phenols [80.5-134.9 mg/g of dry matter (DM) in black 
teas and 87-106.2 mg/g of DM in green teas] and catechins (5.6-47.5, 51.5-84.3, 
and 8.5-13.9 mg/g of DM in black, green, and fruit teas, respectively); this was 
most probably a result of differing agronomic conditions, leaf age, and storage 
during and after transport, as well as the degree of fermentation. Caffeine 
contents of black teas (22-28 mg/g of DM) were significantly higher than in less 
fermented green teas (11-20 mg/g of DM). The relative concentration of the five 
major tea catechins ranked EGCG > ECG > EC > EGC > C. The estimated U.K. dietary 
intakes of total tea catechins, calculated on the basis of an average tea 
consumption of three cups of tea (200 mL cup, 1% tea leaves w/v), were 61.5, 
92.7, and 405.5 mg/day from fruit teas, black teas, and green teas, 
respectively. The coefficients of variation were 19.4, 88.6, and 17.3%, 
respectively, indicating the wide variation in these intakes. The calculated 
caffeine intake ranged between 92 and 146 mg/day. In addition, many individuals 
will consume much larger quantities of tea, of various strengths (as determined 
by the brewing conditions employed). This broad spread of U.K. daily intakes 
further emphasizes the need for additional research to relate intake and effect 
in various population groups.

Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) contains abundant lignans including lipid-soluble 
lignans (sesamin and sesamolin) and water-soluble lignan glycosides (sesaminol 
triglucoside and sesaminol diglucoside) related to antioxidative activity. In 
this study, near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to develop a 
rapid and nondestructive method for the determination of lignan contents on 
intact sesame seeds. Ninety-three intact seeds were scanned in the reflectance 
mode of a scanning monochromator. This scanning procedure did not require the 
pulverization of samples, allowing each analysis to be completed within minutes. 
Reference values for lignan contents were obtained by high-performance liquid 
chromatography analysis. Calibration equations for lignans (sesamin and 
sesamolin) and lignan glycosides (sesaminol triglucoside and sesaminol 
diglucoside) contents were developed using modified partial least squares 
regression with internal cross-validation (n = 63). The equations obtained had 
low standard errors of cross-validation and moderate R2 (coefficient of 
determination in calibration). The prediction of an external validation set (n = 
30) showed significant correlation between reference values and NIRS predicted 
values based on the SEP (standard error of prediction), bias, and r2 
(coefficient of determination in prediction). The models developed in this study 
had relatively higher values (more than 2.0) of SD/SEP(C) for all lignans and 
lignan glycosides except for sesaminol diglucoside, which had a minor amount, 
indicating good correlation between the reference and the NIRS estimate. The 
results showed that NIRS, a nondestructive screening method, could be used to 
rapidly determine lignan and lignan glycoside contents in the breeding programs 
for high quality sesame.

Ready to drink (RTD) teas are a growing segment in the beverage category, 
brought about by improvements in the flavor of these products and healthy market 
trends driven by consumers. The presented results evaluated the antioxidant 
phytochemical stability of RTD teas from aqueous infusions of traditional green 
tea (Camellia sinensis) and a botanical tea from yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria) 
as influenced by packaging materials during cold storage. Two common packaging 
materials for RTD products are glass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and 
have been compared to a retortable pouch (RP), an emerging packaging material 
for various types of food since it is durable, inexpensive, lightweight, and 
easy to sterilize. Storage stability was then evaluated for each aqueous 
infusion prepared at 10 g/L at 90 °C for 10 min and evaluated at 3 °C in the 
absence of light over 12 weeks. Analyses included quantification and 
characterization of individual polyphenolics by high-performance liquid 
chromatography-photodiode array and liquid chromatography-electrospray 
ionization-mass spectrometry as well as changes in total antioxidant capacity. 
For green tea, concentrations of the three major flavan-3-ols, epigallocatechin 
gallate, epigallocatechin, and epicatechin gallate were better retained in glass 
bottles as compared to other packages over 12 weeks. In yaupon holly, 
chlorogenic acid and its isomers that were the predominant compounds were 
generally stable in each packaging material, and a 20.6-fold higher amount of 
saponin was found as compared to green tea, which caused higher stability of 
flavonol glycosides present in yaupon holly during storage. The antioxidant 
capacity of green tea was better retained in glass and PET versus RP, whereas no 
differences were again observed for yaupon holly. Results highlight the 
superiority of oxygen-impervious glass packaging, but viable alternatives may be 
utilizable for RTD teas with variable phytochemical compositions.

Two methods were developed for the quantitative analysis of phenolic acids in 
herb extracts. The methods were based on liquid chromatography-time-of-flight 
mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). 
The methods were compared in terms of their linearity, repeatability, 
selectivity, sensitivity and the speed of the analysis. The sensitivity was good 
for both methods, with limits of detection of <80 ng/ml for most of the 
compounds. The relative standard deviations (RSD) of the peak areas were on 
average 7.2% for the LC-TOFMS method and 1.4% for the GC-MS method. Both methods 
were found to be suitable for the determination of the target analytes, although 
GC-MS was better suited to the quantitative determination of compounds present 
at low concentrations.

A fast and effective dynamic sonication assisted ethanol extraction method was 
developed for extracting phenolic acids from basil, oregano, rosemary, sage, 
spearmint and thyme of the Lamiaceae family. The results were compared with 
results obtained by conventional solvent extraction techniques. A comprehensive 
two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC x LC) system interfaced to 
electrospray ionisation time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry was then 
optimised for analysis and quantification of the herb extracts. The optimised LC 
x LC system employed a combination of C18 and cyano columns. The relative 
standard deviations for the retention times were better than 0.05% (rosmarinic 
acid 0.1%) and those for the peak areas 2-14% (2 mg/l, n=3). Limits of detection 
were 18-90 ng/ml. The LC x LC-MS method was applied to the quantitative analysis 
of phenolic acids, and the results were compared with those obtained with 
conventional LC-MS.

Isoflavones are biologically active compounds occurring naturally in a variety 
of plants, with relatively high levels found in soybeans. Twelve laboratories 
participated in a collaborative study to determine the aglycon isoflavone 
content of 8 test samples of soy and foods containing soy. The analytical method 
for the determination of isoflavones incorporates a mild saponification step 
that reduces the number of analytes measured and permits quantitation versus 
commercially available, stable reference standards. Test samples were extracted 
at 65 degrees C with methanol-water (80 + 20), saponified with dilute sodium 
hydroxide solution, and analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography with UV 
detection at 260 nm. Isoflavone results were reported as microg/aglycon/g or 
microg aglycon equivalents/g. The 8 test samples included 2 blind duplicates and 
4 single test samples with total isoflavone concentrations ranging from 
approximately 50 to 3000 microg/g. Test samples of soy ingredients and products 
made with soy were distributed to collaborators with appropriate reference 
standards. Collaborators were asked to analyze test samples in duplicate on 2 
separate days. The data were analyzed for individual isoflavone components, 
subtotals of daidzin-daidzein, glycitin-glycitein, and genistin-genistein, and 
total isoflavones. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for repeatability was 
1.8-7.1%, and the RSD for reproducibility was 3.2-16.1% for total isoflavone 
values of 47-3099 microg/g.

BACKGROUND: The effects of industrial tomato paste processing and long-term (12 
months) ambient storage on the content and stability of quercetin, kaempferol, 
ascorbic acid (AA), dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA), β-carotene and lycopene were 
evaluated in a commercially produced tomato paste.
RESULTS: The initial thermal treatment (hot break; 93 °C for 5 min) resulted in 
significant reductions in quercetin (54%), kaempferol (61%), AA (63%) and 
β-carotene (30%), whereas subsequent processing steps (e.g. evaporation and 
sterilization) did not result in marked changes in these compounds. Lycopene was 
stable during hot break but decreased by 20% through evaporation and 
sterilization. The ratio of DHAA:vitamin C increased during hot break to 23%, 
whereas the ratio of DHAA:vitamin C remained relatively low in subsequent 
processing steps, indicating that AA was not oxidized. AA decreased with 
prolonged storage, with only 13% remaining at 12 months. The carotenoids and 
quercetin remained stable through 12 months of ambient storage.
CONCLUSIONS: Tomato pomace contained significant amounts of carotenoids and 
flavonoids, indicating that it may be an underutilized processing byproduct.

After intravenous administration of (-)-epicatechin gallate to Wistar male rats, 
its biliary metabolites were examined. Deconjugated forms of (-)-epicatechin 
gallate metabolites were prepared by beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase treatment and 
purified by HPLC. Five compounds were subjected to FAB-MS and NMR analyses. 
These metabolites were shown to be (-)-epicatechin gallate, 
3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, 4' 
'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, and 3',4' '-di-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin 
gallate. After oral administration, five major metabolites excreted in rat urine 
were purified in their deconjugated forms and their chemical structures 
identified. They were degradation products from (-)-epicatechin gallate, 
pyrogallol, 5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, 
4-hydroxy-5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)valeric acid, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic 
acid, and m-coumaric acid. Time course analysis of the identified 
(-)-epicatechin gallate metabolites showed that (-)-epicatechin gallate and its 
conjugate appeared in the plasma with their highest levels 0.5 h after oral 
administration; their levels rapidly decreased, and then they disappeared by 6 
h. The degradation products, mainly in their conjugated forms, emerged at 6 h, 
peaked at 24 h, and disappeared by 48 h. In urine samples, (-)-epicatechin 
gallate and its methylated metabolites were hardly detected and the degradation 
products began to be excreted in the 6-24 h period, peaked in the 24-48 h 
period, and then began to disappear. The most abundant metabolite in both the 
plasma and the urine was found to be the conjugated form of pyrogallol. On the 
basis of these results, a possible metabolic route of (-)-epicatechin gallate 
orally administered to the rat is proposed.

Tree nuts are rich in polar (phenolic compounds) and non-polar (tocols) 
antioxidants, with recognized effects in the prevention of diseases such as 
cancer. These biomolecules possess antiproliferative activity on cancer cells; 
however, the combined effect of both types of compounds has been scarcely 
studied, and this approach could give valuable information on the real 
anticancer potential of tree nuts. In the present study, the antiproliferative 
activity of pure tocols and phenolic compounds, tocol- and phenolic-rich 
extracts (TRE and PRE, respectively) from tree nuts and the extracts 
combinations, was evaluated in four cancer (HeLa, MCF7, PC3, A549) and one 
control (ARPE) cell lines. The most sensible cell lines were HeLa and MCF7. TRE 
and PRE from nuts were chemically characterized; γ and δ tocopherols, total 
tocols, total tocopherols and total phenolic compounds were negatively 
correlated with cell viability in MCF7 cells. In HeLa cells, only δ and total 
tocopherols were negatively correlated with cell viability. TRE and PRE had a 
low effect in reducing cell viability of the cancer cell lines, the most 
effective extracts were those of emory oak acorn (EOA), pecan nut (PEC) and 
walnut (WAL), and these were further studied for their pharmacological 
interactions, using the combination index and the isobologram methods. 
Combinations of both extracts showed a synergistic and strongly synergistic 
behavior in the three nuts (EOA, PEC and WAL), with combination indexes between 
0.12 and 0.55. These results highlight the need to understand the interactions 
among components found in complex natural extracts or food products in order to 
fully understand their bioactivities.

The effects of maturation (green, pink, and ripe) on phenolic composition of 
strawberry cultivars Camarosa, Dorit, Chandler, and Osmanli and their hybrids 
were investigated using a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. 
p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, ellagic acid, cyanidin-3-glucoside, 
pelargonidin-3-glucoside, kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin were individually 
quantified for each stage. The highest amounts of anthocyanins were obtained 
from ripe fruits whereas ellagic acid was found as the main phenolic in the 
green fruits. Phenolic concentrations were found statistically different in 
green and ripe fruits. One hybrid was found to have higher phenolic contents 
than the other genotypes. The p-hydroxybenzoic and p-coumaric acid levels 
changed during maturation, but no differences in contents of flavonoids in green 
and ripe fruit were detected.

A wide range of phenolic compounds participate in oilseed growth, regulate 
oxidative stability of corresponding vegetable oil, and serve as important minor 
food components with health-promoting effects. Composition distribution of 
phenolic compounds varied in oilseeds. Isoflavones, sinapic acid derivatives, 
catechin and epicatechin, phenolic alcohols, chlorogenic acid, and lignans were 
the main phenolic compounds in soybean, rapeseed, peanut skin, olive, sunflower 
seed, sesame and flaxseed, respectively. Among which, the total isoflavones 
content in soybean seeds reached from 1,431 to 2,130 mg/100 g; the main phenolic 
compound in rapeseed was sinapine, representing 70-90%; chlorogenic acid as the 
predominant phenolic compound in sunflower kernels, represented around 77% of 
the total phenolic content. With the rapid development of analytical techniques, 
it is becoming possible for the comprehensive profiling of these phenolic 
compounds from oilseeds. This review aims to provide recently developments about 
the composition distribution of phenolic compounds in common oilseeds, advanced 
technologies for profiling of phenolic compounds by the metabolomics approaches 
based on mass spectrometry. As there is still limited research focused on the 
comprehensive extraction and determination of phenolics with different 
bound-forms, future efforts should take into account the non-targeted, 
pseudo-targeted, and spatial metabolomic profiling of phenolic compounds, and 
the construction of phenolic compound database for identifying and quantifying 
new types of phenolic compounds in oilseeds and their derived products.

Sample preparation is often overlooked and is frequently considered as ""a means 
to an end"". This systematic study with a phenolic-enriched substrate, eggplant 
(Solanum melongena L.), was undertaken to evaluate the substantial variations in 
the extraction techniques, solvents, and parameters as described in the 
published literature. Direct comparison of over 10 extraction procedures or 
conditions was performed to show the importance and influence of sample 
preparation on the assay of phenolic compounds. Chlorogenic acid (CA) was the 
most abundant phenolic acid accounting for >75% of the total phenolic acids 
content extracted from the eggplant sample. Optimum extraction of CA and total 
phenolics (TP) from Black Bell cultivar of eggplant were obtained when 
extractions were performed with a mixture of MeOH/H2O at a ratio of 80:20% v/v 
using a pressurized liquid extractor (PLE) at 100 degrees C. The amount of CA 
and TP extracted from eggplant by the previously reported procedures using a 
wrist shaker, rotary shaker, stirring, sonication, or reflux with different 
extraction solvents (acetone or varying composition of MeOH/H2O solvent 
mixtures) varied significantly between 5 and 95% as compared to PLE. The 
predominant phenolic acids in the free phenolic acid fraction of Black Beauty 
cultivar of eggplant were CA isomers. However, caffeic acid isomers were the 
major phenolic acids extracted from the base-hydrolyzed fraction. The total 
amount of caffeic acid extracted from the Italian Neon cultivar was more that 
twice that of four other eggplant cultivars (Orient Express, Calliope Zebra 
Stripe, Orient Charm Neon, and Black Beauty).

A HPLC method coupled with coulometric electrode array detection for the 
determination of matairesinol in flax seed is described. The defatted sample was 
spiked with bisphenol A (internal standard), refluxed for 75 min in a mixture of 
ethanol-bidistilled water-12 M hydrochloric acid (2:2:1, v/v/v) to extract 
matairesinol conjugates and to hydrolyze them simultaneously. The extract was 
diluted with mobile phase [250 ml acetonitrile-750 ml buffer (730 ml bidistilled 
water, 20 ml glacial acetic acid adjusted to pH 3 with 5 M sodium hydroxide)] 
and injected into the HPLC system. Matairesinol was separated from other 
compounds on a reversed-phase column (Lichrospher 60 RP-Select B, 250 x 4 mm, 5 
micro m) and detected in a coulometric electrode array detector using a 
flow-rate of 0.8 ml/min. The potentials of the eight electrodes were set on 
+150, +200, +250, +300, +350, +400, +550 and +600 mV against modified palladium 
electrodes. The content of matairesinol determined in seven samples varies 
between 7 and 28.5 micro g/g. The limit of quantitation is 5 micro g/g.

Aspalathin, a dihydrochalcone and C-glycoside, is the most abundant flavonoid in 
rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which is well known as an herbal tea in many 
countries. Aspalathin appears to have in vitro antioxidative and antimutagenic 
effects. To understand the effects of aspalathin in the body, research on the 
absorption in the intestinal tract, metabolism in the body, and identification 
of circulating metabolites in vivo is required. We investigated the metabolism 
of aspalathin to identify the parent compound and related metabolites in urine 
and plasma after orally administering a rooibos extract (16.3% aspalathin by 96 
g rooibos extract, which equates to 1.1 kg dried rooibos material), produced 
from unfermented rooibos plant material, to pigs over a period of 11 days (oral 
dosage, 157-167 mg aspalathin per kg body weight daily). On days 7 and 11 of the 
study and days 1 and 2 after termination, urine was collected in 24-hour 
fractions, and plasma samples were collected at various time points. To our 
knowledge, this is the first time aspalathin metabolites have been identified in 
vivo, by presenting evidence of the absorption of aspalathin. Six substances 
identified in the urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were 
identified; these represent aspalathin and the metabolites methylated 
aspalathin, glucuronidated aspalathin glucuronidated and methylated aspalathin, 
a glucuronidated aglycone of aspalathin, as well as a metabolite of eriodictyol. 
The latter compound was methylated and contained 2 glucuronic acid moieties. 
This study showed that aspalathin can be absorbed by the intestine as 
C-glycoside as well as being cleaved in an aglycone and sugar moiety. The major 
metabolite in the enzymatically treated samples was methylated aspalathin. 
Between 0.1% and 0.9% of the administered dose of aspalathin could be detected 
in the urine on days 7 and 11 of the feeding study. No metabolites or aspalathin 
were found in plasma samples. The identification of the metabolites in vivo 
enables investigations to determine the biological potential of rooibos 
extracts.

The bioavailability and urinary excretion of three dietary flavonoids, 
quercetin, hesperetin and naringenin, were investigated. Ten healthy men were 
asked to consume a 'juice mix' containing equal amounts of the three flavonoids, 
and their urine and plasma samples were collected. The resulting mean plasma 
area under the curve (AUC)(0-48 h) and C(max) values for quercetin and 
hesperetin were similar, whereas the AUC(0-48 h) of naringenin and, thus, the 
relative bioavailability were higher after consumption of the same dose. The 
study consolidates a significantly lower urinary excretion of quercetin 
(1.5+/-1%) compared with hesperetin (14.2+/-9.1%) and naringenin (22.6+/-11.5%) 
and shows that this is not due to a lower bioavailability of quercetin, but 
rather reflects different clearance mechanisms.

Phytoestrogens are a group of polyphenolic plant metabolites that can induce 
biological responses. Their bioactivity is based on their similarity to 
17beta-estradiol and their ability to bind to the beta-estrogen receptor. 
Although epidemiological data are inconclusive, phytoestrogens are considered to 
be beneficial for a variety of conditions, for example, hormone-related cancers 
like breast and prostate cancer. To investigate the biological effects of these 
compounds and to assess the exposure of larger cohorts or the general public, 
reliable data on the phytoestrogen content of food is necessary. Previously, 
food analysis for phytoestrogens was performed using either HPLC-UV or GC/MS. 
Here, we describe the development of the first generic method for the analysis 
of phytoestrogens in food, using automated solid-phase extraction and liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The presented method shows a good 
reproducibility and can be easily adapted to other phytoestrogens if required.

Phytoestrogens are secondary plant metabolites that have received increasing 
attention for their bioactivity, in particular due to their structural and 
functional similarity to 17beta-estradiol. Although urinary and plasma 
phytoestrogens can be used as biomarkers for dietary intake, this is often not 
possible in large epidemiological studies or in the assessment of general 
exposure in free-living individuals. Accurate information about dietary 
phytoestrogens is therefore important, but there are very limited data 
concerning food contents. In this study was analyzed a comprehensive selection 
of tea, coffee, alcoholic beverages, nuts, seeds, and oils for their 
phytoestrogen content using a newly developed sensitive method based on LC-MS 
incorporating (13)C 3-labeled standards. Phytoestrogens were detected in all 
foods analyzed, although the contents in gin and bitter (beer) were below the 
limit of quantification (1.5 microg/100 g). Lignans were the main type of 
phytoestrogens detected. Tea and coffee contained up to 20 microg/100 g 
phytoestrogens and beer (except bitter) contained up to 71 microg/100 g, mainly 
lignans. As these beverages are commonly consumed, they are a main source of 
dietary lignans. The results published here will contribute to databases of 
dietary phytoestrogen content and allow a more accurate determination of 
phytoestrogen exposure in free-living individuals.

Dietary phytoestrogens may be involved in the occurrence of chronic diseases. 
Reliable information on the phytoestrogen content in foods is required to assess 
dietary exposure and disease risk in epidemiological studies. However, there is 
little information on isoflavone, lignan, and coumestrol content of cereals and 
cereal-based foods, leading to an underestimation of intake. This is the first 
study of phytoestrogens (isoflavones: biochanin A, daidzein, formononetin, 
genistein, glycitein; lignans: matairesinol, secoisplariciresinol; coumestrol) 
in a comprehensive selection of 101 cereals and cereal-based foods-including 
breads, breakfast cereals, biscuits, pasta and rice-consumed in the UK using a 
sensitive LCMS technique with 13C-labelled internal standards. Phytoestrogens 
were detected in all foods analyzed; bread contained the highest amount of 
phytoestrogens-many as isoflavones-with an average content of 375 +/- 67 
microg/100 g wet weight (excluding soya-linseed bread with 12,000 microg/100 g). 
Most other foods contained less than 100 microg/100 g, many as lignans. Our 
study shows that all foods analyzed contained phytoestrogens, with the highest 
amount found in breads, making them one of the main sources of dietary 
phytoestrogens in the UK. These results will allow a more accurate estimation of 
exposure to dietary phytoestrogens.

The distribution of total phenolics and main betacyanins in red beetroot (Beta 
vulgaris) root was determined. Also, the subsequent effects of cold storage on 
the content of total phenolics, main betacyanins (betanin and isobetanin), and 
the main known ferulic acid ester 
(beta-D-fructofuranosyl-alpha-D-(6-O-(E)-feruloylglucopyranoside) were 
determined in the peel, which is the root part containing the largest amount of 
total phenolics. The content of total phenolics in the red beetroot water 
extracts was determined according to a modification of the Folin-Ciocalteu 
method and expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE). The compounds of interest 
were identified by HPLC-ESI-MS and NMR techniques, and the contents of compounds 
were determined by HLPC analyses. The total phenolic contents in various root 
parts were found to decrease in the order peel, crown, flesh. Significant 
differences in the contents of total phenolics and individual compounds were 
found when the effect of cold storage (5 degrees C, 0-196 days) on the 
constituents of the peel from intact roots was examined. In addition to the 
betacyanins of red beetroot peel found in our earlier study, tentative 
identifications of betanidin and feruloylamaranthin were made.

Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of two tree spinach species 
(Cnidoscolus chayamansa McVaugh and C. aconitifolius Miller.) were determined in 
raw and cooked leaf extracts. Antioxidant capacity was assessed by the oxygen 
radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, and flavonoid glycoside composition 
was quantified by HPLC and identified by GC. Total phenolics and antioxidant 
capacity were higher in raw than in cooked leaf extracts. The ORAC values were 
strongly correlated with total phenolic content (r = 0.926) in all leaf 
extracts. The major flavonoids isolated from the leaf extracts were 
kaempferol-3-O-glycosides and quercetin-3-O-glycosides. C. aconitifolius leaves 
contained more varieties of the flavonoid glycosides than C. chayamansa. Cooking 
reduced antioxidant activity and phenolic content and resulted in losses of some 
kaempferol glycoside and quercetin glycoside residues in leaf extracts. The 
results of this study indicate that tree spinach leaves are a rich source of 
natural antioxidants for foods.

Lignans and isoflavonoid phytoestrogens, produced from plant precursors by 
colonic bacteria, may protect against certain cancers. We examined the effects 
of flaxseed consumption on urinary lignans and isoflavonoids. Eighteen women 
consumed their usual omnivorous diets for three menstrual cycles and their usual 
diets supplemented with flaxseed powder (10 g/d) for three cycles in a 
randomized crossover design. Three-day urine samples from follicular and luteal 
phases were analyzed for lignans and isoflavonoids by isotope-dilution gas 
chromatography--mass spectrometry. Excretion of the lignans enterodiol and 
enterolactone increased with flaxseed from 1.09 +/- 1.08 and 3.16 +/- 1.47 to 
19.48 +/- 1.10 and 27.79 +/- 1.50 mumol/d, respectively (P < 0.0002). Enterodiol 
and enterolactone excretion varied among subjects in response to flaxseed (3- to 
285-fold increase). There were no differences in excretion of isoflavonoids 
(daidzein, genistein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin) or the lignan 
matairesinol with flaxseed. Excretion was not altered by phase of menstrual 
cycle or duration of flaxseed consumption.

The total alkylresorcinol (AR) content and relative homologue composition of 21 
durum wheat (Triticum durum) kernel samples, as well as 5 pasta products and the 
corresponding flour mixtures, were determined. Durum wheat contained on average 
455 microg/g ARs, and the average relative homologue composition was C17:0 
(0.4%), C19:0 (14%), C21:0 (58%), C23:0 (21%), and C25:0 (6.5%). The homologue 
composition was found to be relatively consistent among samples, with durum 
wheat being different from common wheat by having a higher proportion of the 
longer homologues. No differences in content or homologue composition were 
observed in pasta products compared to flour ingredients, showing that 
alkylresorcinols are stable during pasta processing. The ratio of the homologues 
C17:0 to C21:0 was < or =0.02 for whole grain durum wheat products, which is 
different from those of common wheat (0.1) and rye (0.9).

Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and 
development of atherosclerosis. Levels of phenolics, major catechins 
[(+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, procyanidin dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4], phenolic 
acids (gallic acid and caffeic acid), caftaric acid, malvidin-3-glucoside, 
peonidin-3-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-glucoside were quantified by HPLC with UV 
detection for 54 French varietal commercial wines taken from southern France to 
study the antioxidant capacity and the daily dietary intake of these compounds 
for the French population. The highest antioxidant capacity was obtained with 
red wines and ranged from 12.8 mmol/L (Grenache) to 25.2 mmol/L (Pinot Noir). 
For white wines, Chardonnay enriched in phenolics by special wine-making was 
found to have an antioxidant capacity of 13.8 mmol/L, comparable to red wine 
values. For red wines classified by vintages (1996-1999) antioxidant capacities 
were approximately 20 mmol/L and then decreased to 13.4 mmol/L for vintages 
1995-1991. Sweet white wines have 1.7 times more antioxidant capacity (3.2 
mmol/L) than dry white wines (1.91 mmol/L). On the basis of a still significant 
French wine consumption of 180 mL/day/person, the current daily intake of 
catechins (monomers and dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4) averaged 5 (dry white wine), 
4.36 (sweet white wines), 7.70 (rosé wines), 31.98 (red wines), and 66.94 (dry 
white wine enriched in phenolic) mg/day/resident for the French population. Red 
wine, and particularly Pinot Noir, Egiodola, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, and 
Merlot varieties, or Chardonnay enriched in phenolics during wine-making for 
white varieties contribute to a very significant catechin dietary intake.

Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and 
development of atherosclerosis. Stilbenes have been shown to have cancer 
chemopreventive activity and to protect lipoproteins from oxidative damage. A 
method for the direct determination of stilbene oligomers (viniferin and 
pallidol) as well as astilbin in different types of wine using high-performance 
liquid chromatography with UV detection is described. In a survey of 21 
commercial wines from the south of France, levels of pallidol and viniferin are 
reported for the first time in different types of wines. Viniferin was found to 
be present only in red and botrytized sweet white wines with levels between 0.1 
and 1.63 mg/L; pallidol was not found in dry and sweet white wines but only in 
wines made by maceration with stems, with levels between 0.38 and 2.22 mg/L. 
Highest levels of astilbin were found in Egiodola (15.13 mg/L), Merlot (11.61 
mg/L), and Cabernet Sauvignon (8.24 mg/L) for red wines and in Sauvignon (5.04 
mg/L) for white varietal wines. Astilbin levels are highest for recent vintages, 
but pallidol is not found in older vintages. During noble rot development in 
Sauvignon or Sémillon grapes from the Sauternes area, levels of trans-astringin, 
trans-resveratrol, trans-piceid, and pallidol are quite low (<0.5 mg/kg of 
grapes). Viniferin and astilbin levels become optimum at 2 and 30 mg/kg, 
respectively, during spot grape and speckle grape stages.

A straightforward stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) for the quantitative 
determination of the di- and trihydroxybenzenes catechol (1), pyrogallol (2), 
3-methylcatechol (3), 4-methylcatechol (4), and 4-ethylcatechol (5) in foods by 
means of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed. With or 
without sample preparation involving phenylboronyl solid phase extraction, the 
method allowed the quantification of the target compounds in complex matrices 
such as coffee beverages with quantification limits of 9 nmol/L for 
4-ethylcatechol, 24 nmol/L for catechol, 3-methyl-, and 4-methylcatechol, and 31 
nmol/L for pyrogallol. Recovery rates for the analytes ranged from 97 to 103%. 
Application of the developed SIDA to various commercial food samples showed that 
quantitative analysis of the target compounds is possible within 30 min and gave 
first quantitative data on the amounts of di- and trihydroxybenzenes in coffee 
beverage, coffee powder, coffee surrogate, beer, malt, roasted cocoa powder, 
bread crust, potato crisps, fruits, and cigarette smoke and human urine. Model 
precursor studies revealed the carbohydrate/amino acid systems as well as the 
plant polyphenols catechin and epicatechin as precursors of catechol and 
5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, caffeic acid as a precursor of catechol and 
4-ethylcatechol, and gallocatechin, epigallocatechin, and gallic acid as 
precursors of pyrogallol.

Maize bran heteroxylan samples were extracted in various conditions of severity. 
Their ferulate and diferulate content was investigated by GC-MS of methyl 
ester-TMSi derivatives. When extracted by 0.5 M NaOH in mild conditions, the 
heteroxylan sample contained a low level of ferulic acid (0.032% by wt.) and the 
main diferulate surviving alkaline extraction was found to be the 8-8' 
diferulate. On peroxidase treatment, this sample nevertheless produced a firm 
and brittle gel without any change in the diferulate profile. Typical lignin 
structures, mainly comprising syringyl units interconnected through beta-O-4, 
beta-1 and beta-beta interunit bonds, were evidenced in the maize bran sample. 
More importantly, these lignin structures were found to be tightly associated 
with the alkali-extracted heteroxylans. Thioacidolysis revealed the occurrence 
of 0.1-0.5% (by wt.) lignin structures in heteroxylan fractions extracted in 
mild or severe conditions, before and after purification of the polysaccharides. 
The gelling potential of the heteroxylan fractions was not only dependent on 
their ferulate level, but also influenced by associated lignin structures. These 
results argue for the occurrence of covalent linkages between heteroxylan chains 
and lignin structures which could participate in the peroxidase-driven gelation 
of feruloylated polysaccharides. They demonstrate the role of low lignin levels 
in the organization of native or reconstructed polysaccharide networks.

Spectrophotometric determination of tannins in tea and beer samples with 
iron(III) and 1,10-phenanthroline as reagents.

Lau OW, Luk SF, Huang HL.

A simple and accurate spectrophotometric method is proposed for the 
determination of tannins in tea and beer samples based on the reduction of 
iron(III) to iron(II) by tannins at 80 degrees C for 20 min. The iron(II) was 
then reacted with 1,10-phenanthroline at pH 4.4 to form a coloured complex. 
Background correction could be effected by precipitating the tannins in the 
sample solution twice with gelatin and kaolin. Absorbance measurements were made 
at 540 nm and the calibration graph was linear from 0 to 5.5 micrograms ml-1 of 
tannic acid with a slope of 0.213 A p.p.m.-1. The precision for the 
determination of tannins in a tea sample containing 9.45% of tannins was 1.8%. 
Most of the ingredients commonly found in tea and beer samples do not interfere 
with the determination. Several tea and beer samples were analysed for their 
tannin content using the proposed method.

The effect of olive stone removal before processing on the degradation level, 
secoiridoid and tocopherol contents, and antioxidant activity of monovarietal 
extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) was studied. EVOOs were extracted from olives of 
the Leccino, Moraiolo, Frantoio, Pendolino, Taggiasca, and Colombaia varieties 
both in the presence and in the absence of the stones. The degradation level of 
EVOOs was evaluated by acidity, peroxide number, and spectroscopic indices 
K(232) and K(270), according to EU regulation. The secoiridoid compounds typical 
of EVOO, namely, the oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives, hydroxytyrosol, 
tyrosol, and tocopherols were analyzed by HPLC. The antioxidant activity was 
evaluated by the xanthine oxidase/xanthine system, generating superoxide radical 
and hydrogen peroxide, and by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl 
test. Results showed that EVOOs obtained from both stoned and destoned olives 
had a very low degradation level, which was not affected by destoning. Destoning 
lowered slightly the alpha-tocopherol content in EVOOs but increased the total 
secoiridoid content and the antioxidant activity of EVOOs (up to 3.5-fold). 
However, these effects were variety-dependent and negligible in some conditions. 
It was concluded that a better knowledge of the reactions occurring during olive 
processing, and particularly on the involvement of endogenous pulp and stone 
enzymes, is essential to predict the effect of destoning on EVOO quality.

The degradation of secoiridoid, tocopherol, and antioxidant activity in extra 
virgin olive oils (EVOOs) was studied during 8 months of storage in closed 
bottles in the dark, at 40 and 25 degrees C. Picual, Arbequina, Taggiasca, and 
Colombaia monovarietal EVOOs possessing quite different fatty acid and 
antioxidant contents were used. The secoiridoid aglycones, namely, the 
oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives, and alpha-tocopherol decreased following 
pseudo-first-order kinetics. In all EVOOs oleuropein derivatives were less 
stable than the corresponding ligstroside derivatives and alpha-tocopherol. 
Accordingly, overall antioxidant activity decreased following pseudo-first-order 
kinetics, with rate constants ranging from 0.85 x 10(-)(3) to 4.1 x 10(-)(3) 
days(-)(1) at 40 degrees C and from 0.8 x 10(-)(3) to 1.5 x 10(-)(3) days(-)(1) 
at 25 degrees C. According to both the antioxidant activity and the hydrolysis 
and oxidation indices established by EU regulation to assess EVOO quality, 
Colombaia oil was the least stable, followed by Taggiasca, Arbequina, and Picual 
oils. Despite antioxidant degradation, EVOOs with high antioxidant contents were 
still ""excellent"" after 240 days of storage at 40 degrees C. These data led to 
the conclusion that the beneficial properties of EVOOs due to antioxidant 
activity can be maintained throughout their commercial lives.

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with photodiode array detection 
was applied for the characterization of anthocyanins in red-fleshed Budd Blood 
(Citrus sinensis) orange. More than seven anthocyanin pigments were separated 
within 30 min by using a binary gradient (0.1% H(3)P0(4) in water and 0.1% 
H(3)PO(4) in acetonitrile) elution on a Prodigy ODS column. Separations by 
reversed-phase HPLC and semipreparative HPLC on a Prodigy 10-microm ODS Prep 
column, and acid and alkali hydrolyses were used for identification of 
anthocyanins. The primary anthocyanins in Budd Blood orange grown in Florida 
were cyanidin-3-(6""-malonylglucoside) (44.8%) followed by cyanidin-3-glucoside 
(33.6%). Two other minor pigments were also acylated with malonic acid. 
Malonated anthocyanins represented the major proportion (>51%) of anthocyanins 
in Budd Blood orange. Total anthocyanin contents and juice color parameters (CIE 
L,a,b) were compared with six other Florida-grown blood oranges.

This study investigated the functional compounds, including isoflavones, 
phenolics, soyasapogenols, and tocopherols, that were detected in 204 soybean [ 
Glycine max (L.) Merrill] germplasms. The soybean samples were divided into 
three groups according to origin: America, China, and Korea. The soybean samples 
were also classified into three groups on the basis of 100-seed weight: small 
(<13 g), medium (13-24 g), and large (>24 g). Among the soybean germplasms, 
CSRV121 (Bosukkong) had the highest level of isoflavone content (4778.1 μg 
g(-1)), whereas CS01316 had the lowest isoflavone content (682.4 μg g(-1)). Of 
the soybeans from the three different countries of origin, those from Korea 
showed the highest average concentration of total isoflavones (2252.6 μg g(-1)). 
The small seeds had the highest average total isoflavone concentration (2520.0 
μg g(-1)) of the three different seed sizes. Among the 204 soybean germplasms, 
CS01405 had the highest content of total phenolics (5219.6 μg g(-1)), and 
CSRV017 (Hwangkeumkong) had the lowest phenolic content (654.6 μg g(-1)). The 
mean concentrations of total phenolic compounds were 2729.1 μg g(-1) in American 
soybean seeds, 1680.4 μg g(-1) in Chinese soybean seeds, and 1977.6 μg g(-1) in 
Korean soybean seeds. Of the soybean seeds from the three different countries of 
origin, American soybean seeds had the highest average concentration of total 
phenolic compounds, and Korean varieties showed the second highest value. Small 
soybean seeds had the highest average content of total phenolic compounds 
(2241.7 μg g(-1)), whereas medium-sized (1926.8 μg g(-1)) and large (1949.9 μg 
g(-1)) soybeans had lower concentrations of phenolic compounds. In whole soybean 
germplasms, the level of total soyasapogenols was higher in CS01173 (1802.3 μg 
g(-1)) and CS01346 (1736.8 μg g(-1)) than in the other types of soybeans. The 
mean concentrations of total soyasapogenol were 1234.0 μg g(-1) in American, 
1294.5 μg g(-1) in Chinese, and 1241.5 μg g(-1) in Korean soybean varieties. 
Chinese soybean varieties showed the highest mean concentration of total 
soyasapogenol, and Korean soybean seeds showed the second highest level. The 
medium-seed group had the highest soyasapogenol content (1269.3 μg g(-1)) of the 
seeds that were grouped by size. A larger amount of soyasapogenol B than 
soyasapogenol A was detected. In whole soybeans, CS01202 showed the highest 
level of total tocopherols (330.5 μg g(-1)), whereas CSRV056 (Pungsannamulkong) 
had the lowest content (153.3 μg g(-1)). Chinese soybeans had the highest 
average concentration of total tocopherols (255.1 μg g(-1)). By comparison, the 
medium-sized Chinese soybean group had the highest (256.1 μg g(-1)) average 
total tocopherol content.

In vitro trials have indicated various potential health effects of lingonberries 
( Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.). Most of these studies have been performed with 
berry extract or juice, and the detailed chemical structures of active compounds 
in these products have not been elucidated. Lingonberry contains 
cyanidin-3-galactoside as its main anthocyanin. Absorption and metabolism of the 
compound is not fully understood, and no studies of anthocyanin metabolism have 
been performed with lingonberries. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
urinary excretion of cyanidin-3-galactoside and its metabolites in young and 
healthy subjects receiving a breakfast containing 300 g of lingonberries. A 
fast, selective, and sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (uHPLC-MS/MS) method was optimized for 
the analysis of the anthocyanin metabolites in urine. Both intact 
cyanidin-3-galactoside and its methylated and glucuronidated metabolites were 
identified from urine samples. The two metabolites represented >50% of cyanidin 
excreted in urine. Maximal excretion appeared between 4 and 8 h after the meal. 
Also, the compounds were absorbed more slowly than reported previously in 
several studies.

The aim of this study was to compare some bioactive compounds in apples, peaches 
and pears and their influence on lipids and antioxidant capacity in rats. The 
content of total polyphenols (g/100g) was 0.23 +/- 0.03; 0.22 +/- 0.03 and 0.68 
+/- 0.1 in peeled fruits and 0.48 +/- 0.04, 0.47 +/- 0.04 and 1.2 +/- 0.12 in 
peels of peaches, pears and apples, respectively. Caffeic, p-coumaric and 
ferulic acids and the total radical-trapping antioxidative potential (TRAP) 
values in peeled apples and their peels were significantly higher than in 
peaches and pears, respectively. Contrarary, no significant differences in the 
content of dietary fiber among the studied fruits were found. The content of all 
studied indices in peels was significantly higher than peeled fruits (p < 0.05 
). A good correlation between the total polyphenols and the TRAP values was 
found in all fruits. Diets supplemented with apples and to a less extent with 
peaches and pears have improved lipid metabolism and increased the plasma 
antioxidant potential especially in rats fed with added cholesterol. The highest 
content of biologically active compounds and the best results in the experiment 
on rats makes apple preferable for dietary prevention of atherosclerosis and 
other diseases.

Flavanone glycosides (FGs) and polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) have been 
studied in pigmented orange (Citrus sinensis) juices and second-pressure 
extracts (SPEs) by high-performance liquid chromatography and diode array 
detector. Detection was performed simultaneously at two different wavelengths: 
278 nm (for determination of FGs) and 325 nm (for determination of PMFs). 
Qualitative distribution patterns of FGs and PMFs in juices and SPEs were 
similar, although the quantitative results are quite different. An increased 
narirutin/hesperidin ratio after centrifugation and the presence of high amounts 
of PMFs in SPEs, which remain unchanged after centrifugation, were observed. 
Therefore, a simple and affordable procedure to distinguish an orange juice from 
SPEs was proposed.

To identify and quantify biologically active components in rat serum after 
orally administrating the decoction of Bulpleurum falcatum L. and Fractus 
aurantii, one of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and 
validated. The HPLC separation was carried out on a Waters Nova Pak C(18) column 
using acetonitrile and water as mobile phase after the sample of rat serum was 
cleaned up with solid-phase extraction. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization 
in the negative ion mode and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) method was 
developed to determine the active components. Three flavonoids of hesperidin, 
neohesperidin and naringin were identified in the serum by comparing their 
retention times and three independent SRM precursor/product ion transitions with 
those of corresponding reference standards. The concentrations of naringin, 
hesperidin and neohesperidin in rat serum determined by SRM measurement were 
16.3, 11.9 and 14.3 ng/ml, respectively, after orally administrating the 
decoction of B. falcatum L. and F. aurantii. This method was validated in terms 
of recovery, linearity, accuracy and precision (intra- and interday variation). 
The recoveries from spiked control samples were 93.0, 89.3 and 91.2% for 
hesperidin, neohesperidin and naringin, respectively. Linearity in rat serum was 
observed over the range of 2.0-50.0 ng/ml. Percent bias (accuracy) and precision 
were well within the acceptable range and the relative standard deviation 
(R.S.D.) of the measured rat serum samples was less than 10% (n=5).

The polyphenolic compositions of three heartnut (Juglans ailanthifolia var. 
cordiformis) varieties (Imshu, Campbell CW1, and Campbell CW3) were examined and 
compared with those of two Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.) varieties (Combe 
and Lake). The nuts were defatted, extracted, and separated into three different 
fractions, the free phenolic acid (FPA), acid-hydrolyzable phenolic acid (AHPA), 
and bound phenolic acid (BPA) fractions. The total phenolic contents (TPCs) in 
both FPA and AHPA of the Persian walnuts were significantly higher (P < 0.001) 
than those of the heartnuts, but not in the BPA (P = 0.20). LC-ESI-MS(n)() 
studies revealed that except for the FPA fraction, the major polyphenolics in 
both heartnut and Persian walnut were ellagic acid and valoneic acid dilactone. 
Persian walnuts contained an average of 0.29 and 1.31 mg of ellagic acid/g nut 
in the 80% methanol extractable fractions FPA and AHPA, respectively. Heartnuts 
contained an average of 0.16 and 0.60 mg of ellagic acid/g nut in the respective 
fractions. Bound ellagic acid in the residue was 0.93 and 0.70 mg/g of nut in 
the Persian walnut and in the heartnut, respectively. Valoneic acid dilactone 
was tentatively identified and quantified as milligrams of ellagic acid 
equivalent per gram of nut. These components were found to contribute to the 
strong total antioxidant activities measured using ferric reducing antioxidant 
power and photochemiluminescence methods.

Flaxseed contains the largest amount of lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside 
(SDG) oligomers and is the richest dietary source of SDG. SDG oligomers in the 
flaxseed extract are often hydrolyzed to break the ester linkages for the 
release of SDG and the glycosidic bonds for the release of secoisolariciresinol 
(SECO). The hydrolysates of SDG oligomers are complicated because of the 
production of esters in an alcohol-containing medium. In this study, a new 
gradient reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has 
been developed to be suitable for the separation and determination of: (1) SDG 
oligomers extracted from the defatted flaxseed powder by a 70% aqueous methanol 
solution; (2) SDG oligomers and their alkaline hydrolysates, including SDG, 
p-coumaric acid glucoside and its methyl ester, ferulic acid glucoside and its 
methyl ester in an alkaline hydrolytic solution; and (3) the succedent acid 
hydrolysates, including secoisolariciresinol monoglucoside (SMG), SECO, 
anhydrosecoisolariciresinol (anhydro-SECO), p-coumaric acid and its methyl 
ester, ferulic acid and its methyl ester, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (HMF) and 
its degradation product in an acid hydrolytic solution. The content of SDG 
oligomers in a defatted flaxseed powder was found to be 38.5 mg/g on a dry 
matter basis, corresponding to a SDG content of 15.4 mg/g, which was determined 
after alkaline hydrolysis. Furthermore, this study presented a major reaction 
pathway for the hydrolysis of SDG oligomers.

A new analytical approach based on gas chromatography coupled to atmospheric 
pressure chemical ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry was evaluated for 
its applicability for the analysis of phenolic compounds from extra-virgin olive 
oil. Both chromatographic and MS parameters were optimized in order to improve 
the sensitivity and to maximize the number of phenolic compounds detected. We 
performed a complete analytical validation of the method with respect to its 
linearity, sensitivity, precision, accuracy and possible matrix effects. The 
LODs ranged from 0.13 to 1.05ppm for the different tested compounds depending on 
their properties. The RSDs for repeatability test did not exceed 6.07% and the 
accuracy ranged from 95.4% to 101.5%. To demonstrate the feasibility of our 
method for analysis of real samples, we analyzed the extracts of three different 
commercial extra-virgin olive oils. We have identified unequivocally a number of 
phenolic compounds and obtained quantitative information for 21 of them. In 
general, our results show that GC-APCI-TOF MS is a flexible platform which can 
be considered as an interesting tool for screening, structural assignment and 
quantitative determination of phenolic compounds from virgin olive oil.

LC-DAD-ESI/MS was used to identify 23 flavonoids in the extract of Mexican 
oregano (Lippia graveolens H.B.K.), a spice and herb, used in the USA and 
Mexico. The identification of luteolin-7-O-glucoside, apigenin 7-O-glucoside, 
phloridzin, taxifolin, eriodictyol, scutellarein, luteolin, quercetin, 
naringenin, pinocembrin and galangin was confirmed by direct comparison with 
standards. Identification of 6-hydroxyluteolin, two 6-hydroxyluteolin 
7-O-glycosides, three pentahydroxyflavanone hexosides, scutellarein 
7-O-hexoside, 3-hydroxyphloretin hexoside, and three other flavones, was made by 
detailed analysis of their UV and mass spectral data. The identification of the 
flavonoid glycosides was further confirmed through detection of their aglycones

A screening method using LC-DAD-ESI/MS was applied to the analysis of flavonoids 
in celery, Chinese celery, and celery seeds (Apium graveolens L. and varieties). 
Fifteen flavonoid glycosides were detected in the three celery materials. They 
were identified as luteolin 7-O-apiosylglucoside, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, 
apigenin 7-O-apiosylglucoside, chrysoeriol 7-O-apiosylglucoside, chrysoeriol 
7-O-glucoside, and more than 10 malonyl derivatives of these glycosides. The 
identification of the malonyl derivatives was confirmed by their conversion into 
glycosides upon heating and by comparison of some of the malonates with 
malonates that had previously been identified in red bell pepper and parsley. 
The concentrations of the glycosides and the malonyl glycosides in the three 
materials were estimated by comparison to aglycone standards. This is the first 
report of the presence of these glycosylated flavonoid malonates in celery.

The major flavonoids in rat serum after oral administration of Dalbergia 
odorifera extract were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by high 
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and its coupling to mass spectrometry 
(HPLC-MS). Utilizing HPLC-MS technique, 18 flavonoids including five 
isoflavones, four isoflavanones, four neoflavones, two flavanones, two 
chalcones, one isoflavanonol were identified in free form in serum sample based 
on comparison with the authentic standards. Furthermore, the amounts of the four 
prominent flavonoids, (3R)-4'-methoxy-2',3,7-trihydroxyisoflavanone, vestitone, 
formononetin and sativanone were determined in serum by HPLC-UV with internal 
standard method. The method was validated and utilized in pharmacokinetic 
studies of these four analytes. This is the first report on identification and 
determination of the major flavonoids in rat serum after oral administration of 
D. odorifera extract and the results provided a firm basis for clarifying the 
pharmacological effect of D. odorifera and evaluating the clinical applications 
of this medicinal herb.

Two commercial samples of soft (70% Canadian Eastern soft red spring and 30% 
Canadian Eastern soft white winter) and hard (90% Canadian western hard red 
spring and 10% Canadian Eastern hard red winter) wheats were used to obtain 
different milling fractions. Phenolics extracted belonged to free, soluble 
esters and insoluble-bound fractions. Soluble esters of phenolics and 
insoluble-bound phenolics were extracted into diethyl ether after alkaline 
hydrolysis of samples. The content of phenolics was determined using 
Folin-Ciocalteu's reagent and expressed as ferulic acid equivalents (FAE). The 
antioxidant activity of phenolic fractions was evaluated using Trolox equivalent 
antioxidant capacity, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging, reducing 
power, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, inhibition of oxidation of human 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and DNA, Rancimat, inhibition of 
photochemilumenescence, and iron(II) chelation activity. The bound phenolic 
content in the bran fraction was 11.3 +/- 0.13 and 12.2 +/- 0.15 mg FAE/g 
defatted material for hard and soft wheats, respectively. The corresponding 
values for flour were 0.33 +/- 0.01 and 0.46 +/- 0.02 mg FAE/g defatted sample. 
The bound phenolic content of hard and soft whole wheats was 2.1 (+/-0.004 or 
+/-0.005) mg FAE/g defatted material. The free phenolic content ranged from 0.14 
+/- 0.004 to 0.98 +/- 0.05 mg FAE/g defatted milling fractions of hard and soft 
wheats examined. The contribution of bound phenolics to the total phenolic 
content was significantly higher than that of free and esterified fractions. In 
wheat, phenolic compounds were concentrated mainly in the bran tissues. In the 
numerous in vitro antioxidant assays carried out, the bound phenolic fraction 
demonstrated a significantly higher antioxidant capacity than free and 
esterified phenolics. Thus, inclusion of bound phenolics in studies related to 
quantification and antioxidant activity evaluation of grains and cereals is 
essential.

Cocoa-phytochemicals have been related to the health-benefits of cocoa 
consumption. Metabolomics has been proposed as a powerful tool to characterize 
both the intake and the effects on the metabolism of dietary components. Human 
urine metabolome modifications after single cocoa intake were explored in a 
randomized, crossed, and controlled trial. After overnight fasting, 10 subjects 
consumed randomly either a single dose of cocoa powder with milk or water, or 
milk without cocoa. Urine samples were collected before the ingestion and at 
0-6, 6-12, and 12-24-h after test-meals consumption. Samples were analyzed by 
HPLC-q-ToF, followed by multivariate data analysis. Results revealed an 
important effect on urinary metabolome during the 24 h after cocoa powder 
intake. These changes were not influenced by matrix as no global differences 
were found between cocoa powder consumption with milk or with water. Overall, 27 
metabolites related to cocoa-phytochemicals, including alkaloid derivatives, 
polyphenol metabolites (both host and microbial metabolites) and 
processing-derived products such as diketopiperazines, were identified as the 
main contributors to the urinary modifications after cocoa powder intake. These 
results confirm that metabolomics will contribute to better characterization of 
the urinary metabolome in order to further explore the metabolism of 
phytochemicals and its relation with human health.

The aim of this study was to compare the amount and activity of phytonutrients 
in raw, grilled, and boiled eggplant fruit using chemical measures and a 
biological assay of oxidative bursts in human neutrophils. The thermally treated 
samples showed various changes in their chemical composition (dry matter, 
soluble solids, acidity, and the amount of alcohol insoluble substances) due to 
the cooking processes and were much richer in the main phenolic compounds such 
as chlorogenic and caffeic acids, which are known to be antioxidants. 
Consequently, their free radical scavenging activity was significantly higher, 
especially that of superoxide anion. The biological assay of oxidative bursts 
from human neutrophils in the presence of 
N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine confirmed the greater activity of 
extracts of the cooked eggplants with respect to raw eggplants. Successive 
extract dilutions showed a significant activity up to 1.25 microg/mL after 
cooking, while raw fruits resulted in an activity up to 10.00 microg/mL. These 
results showed that the thermal treatment commonly used before consumption can 
increase the content and biological activity of antioxidant compounds of 
eggplants.

White, blue, red and purple corns (Zea mays L.) were lime-cooked to obtain masa 
for tortillas. The total phenolics and anthocyanins content, antioxidant 
activity expressed as total reducing power (TRP), peroxyl radical bleaching 
(PRAC), total antioxidant activity (TAA) and quinone reductase (QR) induction in 
the murine hepatoma (Hepa 1 c1c7 cell line) as a biological marker for phase II 
detoxification enzymes were investigated. Among the extracts prepared from raw 
corn varieties the highest concentration of total phenolics, anthocyanins, 
antioxidant index and induction of QR-inducing activity were found in the 
Veracruz 42 (Ver 42) genotype. The nixtamalization process (masa) reduced total 
phenolics, anthocyanins and antioxidant activities and the ability for QR 
induction when was compared to raw grain. Processing masa into tortillas also 
negatively affected total phenolics, anthocyanin concentration, antioxidant 
activities, and QR induction in the colored corn varieties. The blue variety and 
its corresponding masa and tortillas did not induce QR. Ver 42 genotype and 
their products (masa and tortilla) showed the greatest antioxidant activity and 
capacity to induce QR.

High-performance liquid chromatography/diode-array detection (HPLC/DAD), 
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC/TOFMS) and quadrupole ion trap mass 
spectrometry (HPLC/QIT-MS) were used for separation, identification and 
structural analysis of lignans in Schisandra chinensis and rat plasma after oral 
administration of the herbal extract. Six lignans in Schisandra chinensis 
extract were identified unambiguously by comparing the retention time, their 
characteristic ultraviolet (UV) absorption and accurate mass measurement. A 
formula database of known lignans in Schisandra chinensis was established, 
against which the other 15 lignans were identified effectively based on the 
accurate extract masses and formulae acquired by HPLC/TOFMS. In order to 
distinguish the isomers, multi-stage mass spectrometry (ion trap mass 
spectrometry, MSn) was also used. The fragmentation behavior of the lignans in 
the ion trap mass spectrometer was studied by the six lignan standards, and 
their fragmentation rules in MSn spectra were summarized. These deduced 
fragmentation rules of lignans were successfully implemented in distinguishing 
the three groups of isomers in Schisandra chinensis by HPLC/QIT-MS. By using the 
three different analytical techniques, 21 lignans in Schisandra chinensis were 
identified within 30 min. After oral administration of the extract, 11 lignans 
in rat plasma were detected and identified by comparing their retention time, 
characteristic UV absorption and accurate mass measurement of peaks in 
HPLC/TOFMS chromatograms of the herbal extract. Finally, HPLC/TOFMS fingerprints 
of Schisandra chinensis in vitro and rat plasma in vivo were established. It is 
concluded that a rapid and effective method based on three analytical techniques 
for identification of chemical components was established, which is useful for 
rapid identification of multiple components in Schisandra chinensis in vitro and 
in vivo. In addition, it can provide help for further pharmacology and action 
mechanism study of lignans in Schisandra chinensis.

Phlorin (3,5-dihydroxyphenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside), an orange peel marker, has 
been searched in 45 species and varieties of Citrus. The phlorin content was 
determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography in juices and aqueous peel 
extracts of these different fruits. The phlorin content in C. reticulata peel 
extract varies from 0 to 1012 mg L(-)(1) with a mean of 162 mg L(-)(1). On the 
contrary, phlorin was not found in mandarin and clementine juices except for 
mandarin ""Commune"" and ""Beauty"" (33 and 30 mg L(-)(1), respectively). In the 14 
species of oranges and varieties, phlorin was detected in juices and peel 
extracts with a mean of 22 and 492 mg L(-)(1), respectively, while for 
grapefruits, means were 108 mg L(-)(1) in juices and 982 mg L(-)(1) for peel 
extracts. Tangors and tangelos which are hybrids (C. reticulata x C. sinensis 
and C. reticulata x C. paradisi, respectively) are characterized by the 
systematic presence of phlorin in peels (mean: 406 and 659 mg L(-)(1), 
respectively) while in juices its presence could be variable (0-73 mg L(-)(1)). 
These heterogeneity and values may be explained by the genetic variability of 
these hybrids and the phlorin content of their parentage group.

Sample preparation is often overlooked and is frequently considered as ""a means 
to an end"". This systematic study with a phenolic-enriched substrate, eggplant 
(Solanum melongena L.), was undertaken to evaluate the substantial variations in 
the extraction techniques, solvents, and parameters as described in the 
published literature. Direct comparison of over 10 extraction procedures or 
conditions was performed to show the importance and influence of sample 
preparation on the assay of phenolic compounds. Chlorogenic acid (CA) was the 
most abundant phenolic acid accounting for >75% of the total phenolic acids 
content extracted from the eggplant sample. Optimum extraction of CA and total 
phenolics (TP) from Black Bell cultivar of eggplant were obtained when 
extractions were performed with a mixture of MeOH/H2O at a ratio of 80:20% v/v 
using a pressurized liquid extractor (PLE) at 100 degrees C. The amount of CA 
and TP extracted from eggplant by the previously reported procedures using a 
wrist shaker, rotary shaker, stirring, sonication, or reflux with different 
extraction solvents (acetone or varying composition of MeOH/H2O solvent 
mixtures) varied significantly between 5 and 95% as compared to PLE. The 
predominant phenolic acids in the free phenolic acid fraction of Black Beauty 
cultivar of eggplant were CA isomers. However, caffeic acid isomers were the 
major phenolic acids extracted from the base-hydrolyzed fraction. The total 
amount of caffeic acid extracted from the Italian Neon cultivar was more that 
twice that of four other eggplant cultivars (Orient Express, Calliope Zebra 
Stripe, Orient Charm Neon, and Black Beauty).

Resveratrol in the fruits of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.), the lowbush 
""wild"" blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton), the rabbiteye blueberry 
(Vaccinium ashei Reade), and the highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) 
were measured using a new assay based on high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The LC-MS/MS assay provided 
lower limits of detection than previous methods for resveratrol measurement, 90 
fmol of trans-resveratrol injected on-column, and a linear standard curve 
spanning >3 orders of magnitude. The recoveries of resveratrol from blueberries 
spiked with 1.8, 3.6, or 36 ng/g were 91.5 +/- 4.5, 95.6 +/- 6.5, and 88.0 +/- 
3.6%, respectively. trans-Resveratrol but not cis-resveratrol was detected in 
both blueberry and bilberry samples. The highest levels of trans-resvertatrol in 
these specimens were 140.0 +/- 29.9 pmol/g in highbush blueberries from Michigan 
and 71.0 +/- 15.0 pmol/g in bilberries from Poland. However, considerable 
regional variation was observed; highbush blueberries from British Columbia 
contained no detectable resveratrol. Because blueberries and bilberries are 
often consumed after cooking, the effect of baking on resveratrol content was 
investigated. After 18 min of heating at 190 degrees C, between 17 and 46% of 
the resveratrol had degraded in the various Vaccinium species. Therefore, the 
resveratrol content of baked or heat-processed blueberries or bilberries should 
be expected to be lower than in the raw fruit. Although blueberries and 
bilberries were found to contain resveratrol, the level of this chemoprotective 
compound in these fruits was <10% that reported for grapes. Furthermore, cooking 
or heat processing of these berries will contribute to the degradation of 
resveratrol.

A highly sensitive and specific electrospray ionization (ESI) liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method for quantitation of 
naringenin (NAR) and an explanation for the double peaks phenomenon was 
developed and validated. NAR was extracted from rat plasma and tissues along 
with the internal standard (IS), hesperidin, with ethyl acetate. The analytes 
were analyzed in the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode as the 
precursor/product ion pair of m/z 273.4/151.3 for NAR and m/z 611.5/303.3 for 
the IS. The assay was linear over the concentration range of 5-2500 ng/mL. The 
lower limit quantification was 5 ng/mL, available for plasma pharmacokinetics of 
NAR in rats. Accuracy in within- and between-run precisions showed good 
reproducibility. When NAR was administered orally, only little and predominantly 
its glucuronidation were into circulation in the plasma. There existed double 
peaks phenomenon in plasma concentration-time curve leading to the relatively 
slow elimination of NAR in plasma. The results showed that there was a linear 
relationship between the AUC of total NAR and dosages. And the double peaks are 
mainly due to enterohepatic circulation.

High-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode array and 
electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (MS) detection was used to study 
phenolic compounds in berries of black, green, red, and white currants (Ribes 
spp.). UV-visible spectrometry was a valuable tool for the identification of the 
class of the phenolic compound, whereas MS and MS-MS fragmentation data were 
useful for further structural characterization. Distinct similarities were found 
in the relative distribution of conjugated forms of phenolic compounds among the 
four currants. Phenolic acids were found mainly as hexose esters. Flavonol 
glycosides and anthocyanin pigments were mainly found as 3-O-rutinosides and 
second as 3-O-glucosides. However, cyanidin 3-O-sambubioside and quercetin 
hexoside-malonate were notable phenolic compounds in red currant. Flavonol 
hexoside-malonates were identified and quantified in the berries of currants for 
the first time.

High-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode array and 
electrospray ionization mass spectrometric detection was used to study soluble 
and insoluble forms of phenolic compounds in strawberries, raspberries (red and 
yellow cultivated and red wild), arctic bramble, and cloudberries. 
Hydroxycinnamic acids were present as free forms in cloudberries and mainly as 
sugar esters in the other berries. Quercetin 3-glucuronide was the typical 
flavonol glycoside in all of the berries studied. The composition of the 
predominant anthocyanins can be used to distinguish the studied red Rubus 
species from each other since cyanidin was glycosylated typically with 
3-sophorose (56%) in cultivated red raspberry, with 3-sophorose (30%) and 
3-glucose (27%) in wild red raspberry, and with 3-rutinose (80%) in arctic 
bramble. Ellagic acid was present as free and glycosylated forms and as 
ellagitannins of varying degrees of polymerization. Comparable levels of 
ellagitannins were obtained by the analysis of soluble ellagitannins as gallic 
acid equivalents and by the analysis of ellagic acid equivalents released by 
acid hydrolysis of the extracts.

A method was developed to determine the flavanols prodelphinidin B3, procyanidin 
B3, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin by high-performance liquid chromatography, 
using dual-channel electrochemical detection. This method was especially suited 
to the direct analysis of beer samples and to analysis of acetone extracts of 
barley samples, and was capable of determining proanthocyanidins and catechins 
at levels of 0.1-5.0 mg l-1. The use of dual-channel electrochemical detection 
also enabled unambiguous peak identification by measurement of collection 
efficiencies. This method offered improved sensitivity and selectivity compared 
with ultraviolet detection, and sample preparation procedures were greatly 
simplified. The method was applied to the comparison of stabilized and 
unstabilized lagers, and to the analysis of different barley varieties grown in 
Ireland.

Three espresso coffee (EC) samples of different botanical varieties and types of 
roast were prepared in standard conditions using an experimental EC prototype: 
Arabica coffee, Robusta Natural blend, and Robusta Torrefacto blend (a special 
roast by adding sugar). The ECs were characterized with regard to the physical 
parameters, amount of total solids, total solids on filtrate, lipids, caffeine, 
trigonelline, and chlorogenic acids by HPLC, and sensory descriptive analysis 
related to foam appearance, taste, and mouthfeel. Principal component analysis 
(PCA) was applied to differentiate the EC samples. Arabica and Robusta samples 
were separated successfully by principal component 1 (55.3% of variance) 
including physicochemical and sensory parameters related to foam and taste of 
ECs. Torrefacto and Robusta Natural EC samples were separated by principal 
component 2 (20.7% of total variance) including mouthfeel and other attributes 
of color foam. Some interesting correlations among sensory and physicochemical 
variables were found. A very simple discriminate function was obtained by 
discriminate analysis allowing the classification of each EC sample into its 
respective group with a success rate of 100%.

Malt is known to have an impact on beer flavor stability mainly due to the 
presence of antioxidants. In this study, five barley varieties were malted at 
industrial and micro scale, and quality parameters of the resulting malts were 
measured (diastatic power, friability, beta-glucan content, antiradical power, 
reducing power, lipoxygenase activity, and nonenal potential) and correlated 
with the sensory data obtained for the corresponding fresh and forced aged 
beers. A statistical strategy using multiple linear regressions was applied to 
explore relationships between the malt chemical parameters and beer sensory 
data, showing antiradical power as the major contribution of malt to beer flavor 
stability. Additionally, the measured antiradical power, which is well 
correlated with the polyphenolic content, was found to be very similar for malt 
and barley, emphasizing the key role of barley endogenous polyphenols.

Two commonly consumed plant foods, onion bulbs and asparagus spears, were 
subjected to typical domestic processing, including chopping, maceration, and 
boiling. The impact of these processes on flavonol content was assessed. 
Further, the consequences of these processes on the antioxidant capacity of the 
tissues were evaluated with the beta-carotene bleaching method. Chopping 
significantly affected rutin content in asparagus, yielding an 18.5% decrease in 
60 min; but in onions, quercetin 3,4'-diglucoside (Q(DG)) and quercetin 
4'-glucoside (Q(MG)) were virtually unaffected by chopping. Boiling for 60 min 
had more severe effects, as it caused overall flavonol losses of 20.6 and 43.9% 
in onions and asparagus, respectively. Chopping of tissues did not considerably 
influence the antioxidant capacity, but boiling did provoke notable changes.

Our study reports the triglyceride (triacylglycerol, TAG) composition of five 
new Tunisian virgin olive oil cultivars obtained through controlled crossings of 
the cultivar (cv.) Chemlali Sfax. These cultivars have been selected among a 
progeny of 500 olive descendants, based on an evaluation of the fatty-acid (FA) 
composition of their oils. Among these samples, two were derived from the 
crossing with the cv. Sigoise as pollinator (SM634) or pollen acceptor (SM1110) 
and the others from the crossing with the cv. Meski as pollen acceptor (SM513, 
SM514, and SM517). The five descendants were characterized by a good fat value, 
a balanced FA composition, and a high content of triolein, varying between 26.9 
(SM514) and 45.46% (SM1110). They had an improved FA composition as compared to 
that of the cv. Chemlali Sfax and their fruits were slightly bigger. The 
principal component analysis suggested that the TAG variables were more suitable 
than the total FAs for an optimum classification of the cultivar samples 
analyzed. The cultivars obtained through the crossing with the cv. Sigoise (as 
pollen acceptor or pollinator) had a more favorable composition of FAs and TAG 
than those obtained through the crossing with the cv. Meski, which indicated 
that genetic factors had the most important influence on the quality of the 
virgin olive oils.

rules were obtained by both LDA and PLS-1. LDA achieved 91.3 and 85.7% correct 
classification respectively, for internal and external evaluation of the model.

PURPOSE: Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), an anthocyanin component of fruits and 
berries, possesses cancer chemopreventive properties in mouse models of 
carcinogenesis. Its pharmacokinetics and metabolism in mice have hitherto not 
been studied.
METHODS: C57BL6J mice received C3G by either gavage at 500 mg/kg or tail vein 
injection at 1 mg/kg. Blood, urine, bile and heart, lung, kidney, liver, 
prostate, brain and gastrointestinal (gi) mucosal tissues were obtained up to 2 
h after administration. Levels of C3G and its anthocyanin metabolites were 
determined by HPLC with visible detection. Metabolites were identified by 
LC/MS/MS.
RESULTS: After oral administration peak concentrations of anthocyanins occurred 
within 30 min after administration. Levels were highest in the urine and gi 
mucosa. In the gi mucosa and liver the predominant flavonoid species after oral 
administration was C3G, whilst after iv dosing the majority of anthocyanins was 
C3G metabolites. After oral or iv administration, C3G half-lives in the 
different biofluids and tissues ranged from 0.7 to 1.8 h and 0.3 to 0.7 h, 
respectively. Systemic bioavailabilities for parent C3G and total anthocyanins 
were 1.7 and 3.3%, respectively. The major metabolites of C3G were products of 
methylation and glucuronidation. Cyanidin was a minor metabolite in the gut.
CONCLUSION: C3G and its metabolites were recovered from murine tissues which may 
be targets for cancer chemopreventive intervention. Anthocyanin levels achieved 
in the gi mucosa, prostate and the kidneys were of an order of magnitude 
consistent with pharmacological activity.

Pharmacokinetics of trans-resveratrol in its aglycone (RES(AGL)) and glucuronide 
(RES(GLU)) forms were studied following intravenous (15 mg/kg i.v.) and oral (50 
mg/kg p.o.) administration of trans-resveratrol in a solution of 
beta-cyclodextrin to intact rats. In addition, the enterohepatic recirculation 
of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) was assessed in a linked-rat model. Multiple plasma and 
urine samples were collected and concentrations of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) were 
determined using an electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
spectrometry method. After i.v. administration, plasma concentrations of 
RES(AGL) declined with a rapid elimination half-life (T(1/2), 0.13 h), followed 
by sudden increases in plasma concentrations 4 to 8 h after drug administration. 
These plasma concentrations resulted in a significant prolongation of the 
terminal elimination half-life of RES(AGL) (T(1/2TER), 1.31 h). RES(AGL) and 
RES(GLU) also displayed sudden increases in plasma concentrations 4 to 8 h after 
oral administration, with T(1/2TER) of 1.48 and 1.58 h, respectively. RES(AGL) 
bioavailability was 38% and its exposure was approximately 46-fold lower than 
that of RES(GLU) (AUC(inf), 7.1 versus 324.7 micromol.h/l). Enterohepatic 
recirculation was confirmed in the linked-rat model since significant plasma 
concentrations of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) were observed in bile-recipient rats at 
4 to 8 h. The percentages of the exposures of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) that were 
due to enterohepatic recirculation were 24.7 and 24.0%, respectively. The 
fraction of drug excreted in the urine over a period of 12 h was negligible. 
These results confirm that RES(AGL) is bioavailable and undergoes extensive 
first-pass glucuronidation, and that enterohepatic recirculation contributes 
significantly to the exposure of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) in rats.

Sweet peppers (Capsicum annuum L.) cv. Vergasa have been studied at four 
maturity stages (immature green, green, immature red, and red). The individual 
phenolics (hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids), vitamin C (ascorbic acid and 
dehydroascorbic acid), and individual carotenoids were characterized and 
quantified. Five hydroxycinnamic derivatives and 23 flavonoids were 
characterized and quantified from the pericarp of sweet pepper by 
high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray 
ionization-mass spectrometry. Identification was carried out by their UV 
spectra, chromatographic comparisons with authentic markers, identification of 
hydrolysis products, and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Hydroxycinnamic 
derivatives, O-glycosides of quercetin, luteolin, and chrysoeriol, and a large 
number of C-glycosyl flavones have been characterized. Some of these compounds 
were found for the first time in nature. Clear differences in the individual and 
total phenolic content were detected between the different maturity stages. 
Immature green pepper had a very high phenolic content while green, immature 
red, and red ripe peppers showed a 4-5-fold reduction. Ascorbic acid was the 
main form of vitamin C, and its content increased as the pepper reached 
maturity. The red ripe stage had a relevant impact on the carotenoids content. 
Thus, immature green peppers showed the highest content of polyphenols, while 
red ripe fruits had the highest content of vitamin C and provitamin A.

The phloretin-O-glycosides, phloretin-2'-O-glucoside and 
phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside, are thought to be unique to apples and 
apple products. To investigate the metabolism and bioavailability of these 
compounds, nine healthy and five ileostomy human subjects consumed 500 mL of 
Thatchers Redstreak apple cider containing 46 micromol of 
phloretin-O-glycosides. Over the ensuing 24 h period, plasma, urine, and ileal 
fluid were collected prior to analysis by high-performance liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The sole metabolite present in 
quantifiable amounts in plasma was phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, which reached a 
peak concentration (C(max)) of 73 nmol/L and 0.6 h after ingestion (T(max)) with 
the healthy subjects, and statistically similar values were obtained with the 
ileostomy volunteers. Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide was also detected in urine 
along with two additional phloretin-O-glucuronides and a 
phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate. The quantity of phloretin metabolites 
excreted in urine represented 5.0 + or - 0.9% of intake in healthy volunteers 
and 5.5 + or - 0.6% in ileostomy volunteers. The similarity in the excretion 
levels of the two groups and the rapid plasma T(max) indicate absorption of the 
dihydrochalcones in the small intestine. Of the two major phloretin-O-glycosides 
in cider, only phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside was recovered in ileal 
fluid in quantities corresponding to 22% of intake. The absence of 
phloretin-2'-O-glucoside in ileal fluid suggests that it is more readily 
absorbed than phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside. 
Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, two other phloretin-O-glucuronides, one 
phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate, two phloretin-O-sulfates, and the aglycone 
phloretin were also detected in the ileal fluid. This implies that the wall of 
the small intestine contains beta-glycosidase, sulfuryltransferase, and 
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities and that, as well as being absorbed, 
sizable amounts of the phloretin metabolites that are formed efflux back into 
the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. The overall recovery of the 
dihydrochalcones and their metabolites in the ileal fluid was equivalent to 
38.6% of intake.

Potato is one of the most commonly consumed non-grain staple food crops in the 
world therefore, the mineral nutrient content of the potato is extremely 
important for human nutrition. The lack of mineral nutrients causes significant 
health problems, thus, many of these nutrients are often taken as supplements. 
This study was carried out to investigate the effects of potato flesh color and 
location on different mineral nutrient contents under Niksar, Kazova and Artova 
locations in Tokat Province, Turkey, during 2013 and 2014 potato growing 
seasons. The experimental design in each location was randomized blocks with 
three replications. In this study, a total of 67 clones (including varieties and 
advanced breeding selections) with nine white, 10 cream, 30 light yellow, and 18 
dark yellow flesh colors were used. Potatoes with cream flesh colors had the 
highest K (23.81 g kg-1), P (0.31 g kg-1), Mg (1.20 g kg-1), Zn (27.26 mg kg-1), 
Cu (8.28 mg kg-1) and Mn (7.21 mg kg-1) contents, and the lowest Ca (45.6 mg 
kg-1) content. The mineral contents (except K and Cu) of potatoes grown in 
Artova were higher compared to the other two locations. The results clearly 
suggested that Artova is the most suitable location to produce potatoes with a 
high mineral composition, and Kazova is suitable to cultivate potatoes with high 
K and Cu contents. In addition, the knowledge of nutrient rich potato accessions 
is valuable for developing biofortified potato genotypes.

The present study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of three different grapefruit 
flavanone forms in dog plasma and demonstrated their absorption after an oral 
intake of a grapefruit extract; pharmacokinetic parameters of these forms were 
also determined. Ten healthy beagles were administered 70 mg citrus flavonoids 
as a grapefruit extract contained in capsules, while two additional dogs were 
used as controls and given an excipient. The grapefruit flavanone naringin, 
along with its metabolites naringenin and naringenin glucuronide, was detected 
in dog plasma. Blood samples were collected between 0 and 24 h after 
administration of the extract. Naringin reached its maximun plasma concentration 
at around 80 min, whereas naringenin and naringenin glucuronide reached their 
maximun plasma concentrations at around 20 and 30 min, respectively. Maximum 
plasma concentrations of naringin, naringenin and naringenin glucuronide 
(medians and ranges) were 0.24 (0.05-2.08), 0.021 (0.001-0.3) and 0.09 
(0.034-0.12) micromol/l, respectively. The areas under the curves were 23.16 l 
(14.04-70.62) min x micromol/for nariningin, 1.78 (0.09-4.95) min x micromol/l 
for naringenin and 22.5 (2.74-99.23) min x micromol/l for naringenin 
glucuronide. The median and range values for mean residence time were 3.3 
(1.5-9.3), 2.8 (0.8-11.2) and 8.0 (2.3-13.1) h for naringin, naringenin and 
naringenin glucuronide, respectively. The results of the present study 
demonstrate the absorption of grapefruit flavanones via the presence of their 
metabolites in plasma, thus making an important contribution to the field since 
the biological activities ascribed to these compounds rely on their specific 
forms of absorption.

To study the potential hepatic metabolism of olive oil phenols, human hepatoma 
HepG2 cells were incubated for 2 and 18 h with hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and 
hydroxytyrosyl acetate, three phenolic constituents of olive oil. After 
incubation, culture media and cell lysates were hydrolyzed with 
beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase and analyzed by LC-MS. In vitro methylation, 
glucuronidation, and sulfation of pure phenols were also performed. Methylated 
and glucuronidated forms of hydroxytyrosol were detected at 18 h of incubation, 
together with methylglucuronidated metabolites. Hydroxytyrosyl acetate was 
largely converted into free hydroxytyrosol and subsequently metabolized, yet 
small amounts of glucuronidated hydroxytyrosyl acetate were detected. Tyrosol 
was poorly metabolized, with <10% of the phenol glucuronidated after 18 h. Minor 
amounts of free or conjugated phenols were detected in cell lysates. No sulfated 
metabolites were found. In conclusion, olive oil phenols can be metabolized by 
the liver as suggested by the results obtained using HepG2 cells as a hepatic 
model system.

Four cultivars (Bronowicka Ostra, Cyklon, Tornado, and Tajfun) of pepper fruit 
Capsicum annuum L. were studied for phenolics contents and antioxidant activity. 
Two fractions of phenolics, flavonoids (with phenolic acids) and capsaicinoids, 
were isolated from the pericarp of pepper fruit at two growth stages (green and 
red) and were studied for their antioxidant capacity. Both fractions from red 
fruits had higher activities than those from green fruits. A comparison of the 
capsaicinoid fraction with the flavonoid and phenolic acid fraction from red 
fruit with respect to their antioxidant activity gave similar results. Phenolic 
compounds were separated and quantified by LC and HPLC. Contents of nine 
compounds were determined in the flavonoid and phenolic acid fraction: 
trans-p-feruloyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, 
trans-p-sinapoyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, quercetin 
3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside-7-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside, trans-p-ferulyl 
alcohol-4-O-[6-(2-methyl-3-hydroxypropionyl] glucopyranoside, luteolin 
6-C-beta-d-glucopyranoside-8-C-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside, apigenin 
6-C-beta-d-glucopyranoside-8-C-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside, lutoeolin 
7-O-[2-(beta-d-apiofuranosyl)-beta-d-glucopyranoside], quercetin 
3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside, and luteolin 
7-O-[2-(beta-d-apiofuranosyl)-4-(beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-6-malonyl]-beta-d-glucopyranoside. 
The main compounds of this fraction isolated from red pepper were sinapoyl and 
feruloyl glycosides, and the main compound from green pepper was 
quercetin-3-O-l-rhamnoside. Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were the main 
components of the capsaicinoid fraction. A high correlation was found between 
the content of these compounds and the antioxidant activity of both fractions. 
Their antioxidant activities were elucidated by heat-induced oxidation in the 
beta-carotene-linoleic acid system and the antiradical activity by the 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) decoloration test. The highest antioxidant 
activity in the beta-carotene-linoleic acid system was found for 
trans-p-sinapoyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, which was lower than the activity of 
free sinapic acid. Quercetin 3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside had the highest 
antiradical activity in the DPPH system, which was comparable to the activity of 
quercetin. The activities of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were similar to that 
of trans-p-feruloyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside in the DPPH model system.

Hesperidin is a biologically effective flavonoid. Several studies have reported 
that dietary hesperidin was converted to conjugated metabolites, such as 
hesperetin-glucuronides and sulfoglucuronides, during absorption and metabolism. 
However, the chemical structures of the conjugated metabolites, especially the 
sites of glucuronidation and sulfoglucuronidation in plasma, were unconfirmed. 
Therefore, the concentrations of the metabolites conjugated at various sites in 
plasma could not be individually quantified. In the present study, we identified 
the chemical structures and concentrations of the major conjugated metabolites 
in rat plasma after oral administration of hesperidin. Two 
hesperetin-glucuronides were prepared and identified as 
hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Using 
these authentic compounds, the concentrations of 
hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide in rat 
plasma were individually determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
In rat plasma, hesperetin-glucuronides were primarily comprised of 
hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. The 
concentration of hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide was slightly higher than that 
of hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Furthermore, not only hesperetin 
conjugates but also homoeriodictyol conjugates were observed in rat plasma. The 
present study is the first report elucidating the chemical structures and 
changes in individual concentrations in rat plasma of glucuronides derived from 
orally administered hesperidin.

Anthocyanins (ACs) are phenolic compounds that are distributed widely in fruits 
and vegetables. Although consumption of these compounds has been shown to 
improve visual function, the distribution of ACs in ocular tissue has not been 
examined in detail. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the ocular 
distribution of blackcurrant anthocyanins (BCAs) in rats and rabbits after oral, 
intravenous (i.v.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration. Identification and 
quantification of ACs were carried out using high-performance liquid 
chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) and 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV-visible detection, 
respectively. BCAs were identified in the plasma and whole eye after oral and 
i.p. administration in rats. No other peaks were detected in either plasma or 
ocular tissues after administration when the absorbance of the eluate was 
monitored at 520 nm. This finding indicates that intact forms of ACs were 
present in rats after administration of BCA. In rats given i.p. administration, 
the concentration of total ACs in the whole eye and some ocular tissues was 
higher than that measured in plasma. These results suggested that ACs detected 
in the ocular tissues were not due to residual blood. Following i.v. 
administration in rabbits, four ACs were identified in the plasma and several 
ocular tissues including the aqueous humor, cornea, sclera, choroid, ciliary 
body, iris and retina. A small amount of ACs was also detected in the vitreous 
and lens. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that BCAs were absorbed and 
distributed in ocular tissues as intact forms. Our data show clearly that intact 
forms of BCAs pass thorough the blood-aqueous barrier and blood-retinal barrier 
in both rats and rabbits.

A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with diode-array 
detection (DAD) was used to identify and quantify free and total phenolic acids 
(m-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, gallic acid, 
vanillic acid, syringic acid, o-coumaric acid, m-coumaric acid, p-coumaric acid, 
caffeic acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, chlorogenic acid, and ellagic acid) in 
plant foods. Free phenolic acids were extracted with a mixture of methanol and 
10% acetic acid. Bound phenolic acids were liberated using first alkaline and 
then acid hydrolysis followed by extraction with diethyl ether/ethyl acetate 
(1:1). All fractions were quantified separately by HPLC. After HPLC 
quantification, results of alkali and acid hydrolysates were calculated to 
represent total phenolic acids. Ellagic acid was quantified separately after 
long (20 h) acid hydrolysis. The methods developed were effective for the 
determination of phenolic acids in plant foods. DAD response was linear for all 
phenolic acids within the ranges evaluated, with correlation coefficients 
exceeding 0.999. Coefficients of variation for 4-8 sample replicates were 
consistently below 10%. Recovery tests of phenolic acids were performed for 
every hydrolysis condition using several samples. Recoveries were generally good 
(mean >90%) with the exceptions of gallic acid and, in some cases, caffeic acid 
samples.

The contents of free and total phenolic acids and alk(en)ylresorcinols were 
analyzed in commercial products of eight grains: oat (Avena sativa), wheat 
(Triticum spp.), rye (Secale cerale), barley (Hordeum vulgare), buckwheat 
(Fagopyrum esculentum), millet (Panicum miliaceum), rice (Oryza sativa), and 
corn (Zea mays). Avenanthramides were determined in three oat products. Free 
phenolic acids, alk(en)ylresorcinols, and avenanthramides were extracted with 
methanolic acetic acid, 100% methanol, and 80% methanol, respectively, and 
quantified by HPLC. The contents of total phenolic acids were quantified by HPLC 
analysis after alkaline and acid hydrolyses. The highest contents of total 
phenolic acids were in brans of wheat (4527 mg/kg) and rye (4190 mg/kg) and in 
whole-grain flours of these grains (1342 and 1366 mg/kg, respectively). In other 
products, the contents varied from 111 mg/kg (white wheat bread) to 765 mg/kg 
(whole-grain rye bread). Common phenolic acids found in the grain products were 
ferulic acid (most abundant), ferulic acid dehydrodimers, sinapic acid, and 
p-coumaric acid. The grain products were found to contain either none or only 
low amounts of free phenolic acids. The content of avenanthramides in oat flakes 
(26-27 mg/kg) was about double that found in oat bran (13 mg/kg). The highest 
contents of alk(en)ylresorcinols were observed in brans of rye (4108 mg/kg) and 
wheat (3225 mg/kg). In addition, whole-grain rye products (rye bread, rye flour, 
and whole-wheat flour) contained considerable levels of alk(en)ylresorcinols 
(524, 927, and 759 mg/kg, respectively).

Flavonoids continue to attract wide attention as possible very useful agents for 
combating free radical pathologies, i.e. the pathological states associated with 
free radical overproduction. Commonly used methods for the analysis of plant 
flavonoids include high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary 
electrophoresis (CE). On the other hand, the soft-ionization approach based on 
electrospray ionization (ESI-MS) permits highly selective analysis of complex 
matrices. In this work, we examined firstly the ESI-MS behaviour of 
representative aglycones and glycosides of flavonols, flavones and isoflavones 
with the aim of suggesting a possible relationship between structure and mass 
spectra. Using HPLC coupled to a diode array detector (DAD) for on-line UV 
spectra acquisition, and in parallel to ESI-MS for mass spectra (LC/DAD-ESI-MS), 
we have developed methodology to observe flavonols directly in tomato puree 
extract. In this way, it has been possible to detect intact flavonol glycosides 
in tomato extracts and to characterize a flavonol trisaccharide. For the first 
time, using LC/ESI-MS, it has been possible to detect intact flavonol glycosides 
in plasma of healthy volunteers and to provide further evidence on the 
absorption of flavonoid glycosides after consumption of common vegetables like 
tomatoes.

We present a method for the quantitative determination of the phytoestrogens 
formononetin, biochanin A, daidzein, genistein, and coumestrol and 
simultaneously the lignans secoisolariciresinol (SECO) and matairesinol in 
plant-derived foods. These compounds are measured by isotope dilution gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring mode 
(ID/GC/MS/SIM) using synthesized deuterated internal standards for the 
correction of losses during the procedure. A three-step hydrolysis--a 
rehydration with distilled H2O, followed by enzymatic and acid hydrolysis--has 
been applied in order to convert the diphenolic glycosides into their respective 
aglycones. Purification and separation are carried out in two ion-exchange 
chromatographic steps followed by derivatization and GC-MS. The within-assay 
imprecision values vary 3.1-9.6% and the between-assay imprecision 7.0-21.2%. 
The mean recovery of authentic standards processed through the whole procedure 
varied from 95.5 to 105.5%. Values for some different food samples are 
presented. The simultaneous determination of the biologically most interesting 
phytoestrogens and lignans in foods has not been carried out previously and the 
method will be useful for screening of important foods in populations with 
different risk of cancer and coronary heart disease, and for metabolic studies.

Tea is a beverage consumed widely throughout the world. The existence in tea of 
chemopreventing compounds possessing antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic and 
antioxidative properties has been reported. High intakes of tea and foods 
containing flavonoids have recently been shown to be negatively correlated to 
the occurrence of CHD. However, tea may contain other compounds with similar 
activities. Using a new gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method we 
measured lignans and isoflavonoids in samples of twenty commercial teas (black, 
green and red varieties) and, for comparison, six coffees. Both unbrewed and 
brewed tea were investigated. The analysis of the teas yielded relatively high 
levels of the lignans secoisolariciresinol (5.6-28.9 mg/kg; 15.9-81.9 mumol/kg) 
and matairesinol (0.56-4.13 mg/kg; 1.6-11.5 mumol/kg) but only low levels of 
isoflavonoids. Because the plant lignans, as well as their mammalian metabolites 
enterolactone and enterodiol, have antioxidative properties and these mammalian 
lignans occur in high concentrations in plasma, we hypothesize that lignan 
polyphenols may contribute to the protective effect of tea on CHD.

Gradient reversed-phase HPLC was used to obtain quantitative estimates of the 
levels of free and conjugated myricetin and quercetin in 65 red wines from 
Italy, Chile, France, California, Australia, Bulgaria, Spain, Romania, New 
Zealand, Brazil, Morocco, and Hungary. The concentrations of total flavonols 
ranged from 4.6 to 41.6 mg L(-1). High total flavonol levels appear to be 
associated with the use of thick-skinned grape varieties, such as Cabernet 
Sauvignon, with a high skin:volume ratio, which were left to ripen fully in 
sunny conditions before harvest and which were extracted efficiently by modern 
methods of vinification. Some Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon wines contained up to 
40 mg of total flavonols L(-1), which was higher than the levels detected in 
Cabernet Sauvignon from France, California, and Australia. The flavonol content 
of 1989 and 1990 Cabernet Sauvignon from Bulgaria was <6 mg L(-1). Chilean 
Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Pinot Noir all contained consistently higher 
concentrations of flavonols than their counterparts from different geographical 
regions.

Anthocyanins, the red/blue pigments found in plants, are polyphenolic compounds 
consumed by humans and are part of a normal diet. Recent studies have shown that 
anthocyanins have substantial bioactivity including antioxidant activity and 
therefore may have beneficial effects on human health. Anthocyanins are a group 
of over 500 compounds of diverse structures containing different core phenolic 
aglycons and conjugated with sugars in a variety of glycosylation patterns. In 
this study, we have investigated the bioabsorption of 15 anthocyanins with 
structures containing different aglycons and conjugated sugars extracted from 
blueberry, boysenberry, black raspberry, and blackcurrant in both humans and 
rats. Intact and unmetabolized anthocyanins were detected in urine of rats and 
humans following dosing for all molecular structures investigated, thus 
demonstrating that anthocyanins with diverse molecular structure and from 
different dietary sources are bioavailable at diet relevant dosage rates. In 
addition, the relative concentrations of anthocyanins detected in urine 
following dosing varied, indicating that differences in bioavailability are due 
to variations in chemical structure. Our results suggest that the nature of the 
sugar conjugate and the phenolic aglycon are both important determinants of 
anthocyanin absorption and excretion in rats and humans.

The possible beneficial effects of tea consumption have attracted a great deal 
of attention. Many of the biological effects have been attributed to tea 
catechins, but the metabolic fate of these compounds is not clear. In the 
present study, a major metabolite observed in human blood and urine samples 
after green tea administration was identified as a O-methylated derivative of 
(-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) by comparison with products from chemical and 
enzymatic O-methylation of EGC. The structure of this metabolite was elucidated 
as 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epigallocatechin (4'-O-MeEGC) by (1)H and (13)C NMR and 
heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity experiment. The human plasma level of 
4'-O-MeEGC reached its peak value within the first 2 h following tea ingestion. 
Its maximum concentration was 4 to 6 times higher than that of EGC. The 
half-lives of EGC and 4'-O-MeEGC in the blood were 1.02 +/- 0.07 and 4.39 +/- 
1.14 h, respectively. The amount of 4'-O-MeEGC excreted in urine was about 3 
times higher than that of EGC, and 88% of 4'-O-MeEGC was excreted in urine 
within 8 h. The present structural information and concentration-time profile of 
this metabolite provide the basis for understanding the biotransformation of EGC 
and for future elucidation of its biological activities.

(-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant tea catechin, has been 
proposed to be beneficial to human health based on its strong antioxidative and 
other biological activities in vitro. Inadequate knowledge regarding the 
bioavailability and biotransformation of EGCG in humans, however, has limited 
our understanding of its possible beneficial health effects. In this study, 
4',4' '-di-O-methyl-EGCG (4',4' '-DiMeEGCG) was detected in human plasma and 
urine by LC/MS/MS following green tea ingestion. Both 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and EGCG 
reached peak plasma values (20.5 +/- 7.7 and 145.4 +/- 31.6 nM, respectively, in 
4 subjects) at 2 h after the dose. The half-lives of 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and EGCG 
were 4.1 +/- 0.8 and 2.7 +/- 0.9 h, respectively. The cumulative urinary 
excretion of 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG during a 24 h period was 140.3 +/- 48.6 microg, 
about 5-fold higher than that of EGCG, but the excreted 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and 
EGCG in urine only accounted for about 0.1% of ingested EGCG. 
(-)-5-(3',4',5'-Trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4) and 
(-)-5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6), along with another 
possible ring-fission metabolite, 
(-)-5-(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6'), were detected in human 
urine after green tea ingestion. The cumulative excretion of M4, M6', and M6 
during a 24 h period ranged from 75 microg to 1.2 mg, 0.6 to 6 mg, and 0.6 to 10 
mg, respectively. The combined excretion of all three ring-fission metabolites 
accounted for 1.5-16% of ingested catechins. M4, M6', and M6 were all observed 
after the ingestion of pure EGCG or EGC by human subjects, whereas only M6 was 
produced after EC ingestion. These metabolites as well as monomethylated EGCG 
were detected in mice and rats after tea or EGCG administration, and the tissue 
levels reflected the rather low bioavailability of EGCG in rats. The presently 
characterized methylated EGCG metabolites and ring-fission products exist in 
substantial quantities and may contribute to the biological activities of tea.

The present study investigates the bioavailability of resveratrol and quercetin 
in humans, mice, and rats after oral ingestion of grape juice preparations or 
pure aglycones. Oral administration of resveratrol and quercetin to humans 
yielded detectable levels of resveratrol, quercetin, and their derivatives in 
the plasma and urine. Urinary levels of resveratrol, quercetin, and their 
metabolites were observed in human subjects receiving 600 and 1200 mL of grape 
juice, whereas quercetin metabolites were identified in urine samples even after 
receiving 200 mL of grape juice. The cumulative amounts of resveratrol and 
quercetin excreted in the urine of mice receiving concentrated grape juice for 4 
days were 2.3 and 0.7% of the ingested doses, respectively. After i.g. 
administration of resveratrol to rats (2 mg/kg), up to 1.2 microM resveratrol 
was observed in the plasma. The study demonstrates that the glycoside forms of 
resveratrol and quercetin in grape juice are absorbed to a lesser extent than 
the aglycones.

OBJECTIVE: Estimation of dietary intake of polyphenols is difficult, due to 
limited availability of food composition data and bias inherent to dietary 
assessment methods. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether we 
could detect polyphenols and their metabolites in a spot urine sample in a 
free-living human population and whether it was related to those observed in 
24-h urine samples, for potential use as a biomarkers of polyphenol intake.
SUBJECTS: Four 24-h urine samples and two spot urine samples were collected from 
154 participants of the SU.VI.MAX cohort (a randomized primary-prevention trial 
evaluating the effect of daily antioxidant supplementation on chronic diseases) 
in two separate studies over, respectively, a 7- and 2-day periods. Thirteen 
polyphenols and metabolites (chlorogenic acid (CGA), caffeic acid (CA), 
m-coumaric acid (mCOU), gallic acid (GA), 4-O-methylgallic acid (MeGA), 
quercetin (Q), isorhamnetin (MeQ), kaempferol (K), hesperetin (HESP), naringenin 
(NAR), phloretin (PHLOR), enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) were measured 
using HPLC-ESI-MS-MS.
RESULTS: Correlations between the urinary excretion levels were observed. The 
most significant were explained by metabolic filiations (CGA/CA, CA/mCOU, 
GA/MeGA, Q/MeQ, NAR/PHLOR, ENL/END) or co-occurrence in a same food source 
(NAR/HESP). Concentrations in spot samples correlated with those in 24-h urine 
sample (P<0.02, except for CA and for MeQ). Intra-individual variations were 
smaller than inter-individual variations for all polyphenols (P<0.01) except for 
MeGA and for PHLOR.
CONCLUSION: These results show that these polyphenols and metabolites are useful 
biomarkers for polyphenol intake.

The intake of polyphenols has been demonstrated to have health-promoting and 
disease-preventive effects. The pomegranate (Punica granatum L.), which is rich 
in several polyphenols, has been used for centuries in ancient cultures for its 
medicinal purposes. The potential health benefits of pomegranate polyphenols 
have been demonstrated in numerous in vitro studies and in vivo experiments. 
This study investigated the absorption and antioxidant effects of a standardized 
extract from pomegranate in healthy human volunteers after the acute consumption 
of 800 mg of extract. Results indicate that ellagic acid (EA) from the extract 
is bioavailable, with an observed C(max) of 33 ng/mL at t(max) of 1 h. The 
plasma metabolites urolithin A, urolithin B, hydroxyl-urolithin A, urolithin 
A-glucuronide, and dimethyl ellagic acid-glucuronide were identified by HPLC-MS. 
The antioxidant capacity measured with the oxygen radical absorbance capacity 
(ORAC) assay was increased with a maximum effect of 32% after 0.5 h, whereas the 
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was not affected. The inflammation 
marker interleukin-6 (IL-6) was not significantly affected after 4 h after the 
consumption of the extract. Overall, this study demonstrated the absorbability 
of EA from a pomegranate extract high in ellagitannin content and its ex vivo 
antioxidant effects.

Studies were conducted on the flavonoids (myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, 
luteolin, and apigenin) contents of 62 edible tropical plants. The highest total 
flavonoids content was in onion leaves (1497.5 mg/kg quercetin, 391.0 mg/kg 
luteolin, and 832.0 mg/kg kaempferol), followed by Semambu leaves (2041.0 
mg/kg), bird chili (1663.0 mg/kg), black tea (1491.0 mg/kg), papaya shoots 
(1264.0 mg/kg), and guava (1128.5 mg/kg). The major flavonoid in these plant 
extracts is quercetin, followed by myricetin and kaempferol. Luteolin could be 
detected only in broccoli (74.5 mg/kg dry weight), green chili (33.0 mg/kg), 
bird chili (1035.0 mg/kg), onion leaves (391.0 mg/kg), belimbi fruit (202.0 
mg/kg), belimbi leaves (464.5 mg/kg), French bean (11.0 mg/kg), carrot (37.5 
mg/kg), white radish (9.0 mg/kg), local celery (80.5 mg/kg), limau purut leaves 
(30.5 mg/kg), and dried asam gelugur (107.5 mg/kg). Apigenin was found only in 
Chinese cabbage (187.0 mg/kg), bell pepper (272.0 mg/kg), garlic (217.0 mg/kg), 
belimbi fruit (458.0 mg/kg), French peas (176.0 mg/kg), snake gourd (42.4 
mg/kg), guava (579.0 mg/kg), wolfberry leaves (547.0 mg/kg), local celery (338.5 
mg/kg), daun turi (39.5 mg/kg), and kadok (34.5 mg/kg). In vegetables, quercetin 
glycosides predominate, but glycosides of kaempferol, luteolin, and apigenin are 
also present. Fruits contain almost exclusively quercetin glycosides, whereas 
kaempferol and myricetin glycosides are found only in trace quantities.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of three common 
cooking practices (i.e., boiling, steaming, and frying) on phytochemical 
contents (i.e., polyphenols, carotenoids, glucosinolates, and ascorbic acid), 
total antioxidant capacities (TAC), as measured by three different analytical 
assays [Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), total radical-trapping 
antioxidant parameter (TRAP), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)] and 
physicochemical parameters of three vegetables (carrots, courgettes, and 
broccoli). Water-cooking treatments better preserved the antioxidant compounds, 
particularly carotenoids, in all vegetables analyzed and ascorbic acid in 
carrots and courgettes. Steamed vegetables maintained a better texture quality 
than boiled ones, whereas boiled vegetables showed limited discoloration. Fried 
vegetables showed the lowest degree of softening, even though antioxidant 
compounds were less retained. An overall increase of TEAC, FRAP, and TRAP values 
was observed in all cooked vegetables, probably because of matrix softening and 
increased extractability of compounds, which could be partially converted into 
more antioxidant chemical species. Our findings defy the notion that processed 
vegetables offer lower nutritional quality and also suggest that for each 
vegetable a cooking method would be preferred to preserve the nutritional and 
physicochemical qualities.

Considerable epidemiological evidence suggests a link between the consumption of 
diets rich in fruits and vegetables and a decreased risk of cardiovascular 
disease and cancers. Anthocyanins have received attention as important dietary 
constituents that may provide health benefits and contribute antioxidant 
capacity beyond that provided by essential micronutrients such as ascorbate, 
tocopherols, and selenium. The emergence of renewed interest by industrial 
countries in traditional herbal medicines and the development of 'functional 
foods' are stimulating the need for more information regarding the 
bioavailability and efficacy of plant polyphenols. Flavonoids represent a 
numerous group of secondary plant metabolites based on the structure of a pyran 
ring flanked by two or more phenyl rings and varying subtly in the degree of 
unsaturation and the pattern of hydroxylation or methylation. Flavonoids also 
vary in the type of sugar attached or the degree of polymerization. 
Anthocyanins, potent flavonoid antioxidants widely distributed in fruits, 
vegetables and red wines, normally occur in nature as glycosides, a form not 
usually considered as bioavailable. We have examined the bioavailability and 
pharmacokinetics of anthocyanins in humans. Anthocyanins were detected as 
glycosides in both plasma and urine samples. The elimination of plasma 
anthocyanins appeared to follow first-order kinetics and most anthocyanin 
compounds were excreted in urine within 4 h after feeding. The current findings 
appear to refute assumptions that anthocyanins are not absorbed in their 
unchanged glycosylated forms in humans.

In the United States, commercially available foods, including cocoa and 
chocolate, are being marketed with statements referring to the level of 
antioxidant activity and polyphenols. For cocoa-containing foods, there has been 
no comprehensive survey of the content of these and other chemistries. A survey 
of cocoa and chocolate-containing products marketed in the United States was 
conducted to determine antioxidant activity and polyphenol and procyanidin 
contents. Commercially available samples consisted of the top market share 
products in each of the following six categories: natural cocoa, unsweetened 
baking chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet baking chips, milk chocolate, and 
chocolate syrup. Composite samples were characterized using four different 
methods: oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), vitamin C equivalence 
antioxidant capacity (VCEAC), total polyphenols, and procyanidins. All composite 
lots were further characterized for percent nonfat cocoa solids (NFCS) and 
percent fat. Natural cocoas had the highest levels of antioxidant activities, 
total polyphenols, and procyanidins followed by baking chocolates, dark 
chocolates and baking chips, and finally milk chocolate and syrups. The results 
showed a strong linear correlation between NFCS and ORAC (R (2) = 0.9849), total 
polyphenols (R (2) = 0.9793), and procyanidins (R (2) = 0.946), respectively. On 
the basis of principal component analysis, 81.4% of the sample set was 
associated with NFCS, antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, and procyanidins. 
The results indicated that, regardless of the product category, NFCS were the 
primary factor contributing to the level of cocoa antioxidants in the products 
tested. Results further suggested that differences in cocoa bean blends and 
processing, with the possible exception of Dutching, are minor factors in 
determining the level of antioxidants in commercially available cocoa-containing 
products in the United States.

An automated on-line method for the determination of the isoflavones, daidzein 
and genistein, was developed using in-tube solid-phase microextraction coupled 
to high-performance liquid chromatography (in-tube SPME-HPLC). In-tube SPME is a 
new extraction technique for organic compounds in aqueous samples, in which 
analytes are extracted from the sample directly into an open tubular capillary 
by repeated draw/eject cycles of sample solution. Daidzein, genistein and their 
glucosides tested in this study were clearly separated within 8 min by HPLC 
using an XDB-C8 column with diode array detection. In order to optimize the 
extraction of these compounds, several in-tube SPME parameters were examined. 
The glucosides daidzin and genistin were analyzed as aglycones after hydrolysis 
because the glucosides were not concentrated by in-tube SPME. The optimum 
extraction conditions for daidzein and genistein were obtained with 20 
draw/eject cycles of 40 microl of sample using a Supel-Q porous layer open 
tubular capillary column. The extracted compounds were easily desorbed from the 
capillary by mobile phase flow, and carryover was not observed. Using the 
in-tube SPME-HPLC method, the calibration curves of these compounds were linear 
in the range 5-200 ng/ml, with a correlation coefficient above 0.9999 (n = 18), 
and the detection limits (S/N = 3) were 0.4-0.5 ng/ml. This method was 
successfully applied to the analysis of soybean foods without interference 
peaks. The recoveries of aglycones and glucosides spiked into food samples were 
above 97%.

Eriocitrin, a flavonoid glycoside present in lemon fruit, is metabolized in vivo 
to a series of eriodictyol, methylated eriodictyol, 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic 
acid, and their conjugates. Plasma antioxidant activity increased following oral 
administration of aqueous eriocitrin solutions to rats. Eriocitrin metabolites 
were found in plasma and renal excreted urine through HPLC and LC-MS analyses. 
Eriocitrin was not detected in plasma and urine, but eriodictyol, 
homoeriodictyol, and hesperetin in their conjugated forms were detected in 
plasma of 4.0 h following administration of eriocitrin. In urine for 24 h, both 
nonconjugates and conjugates of these metabolites were detected. 
3,4-Dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, which is metabolized from eriodictyol by 
intestinal bacteria, was detected in slight amounts with each form in 4.0-h 
plasma and 24-h urine. Eriocitrin was suggested to be metabolized by intestinal 
bacteria, and then eriodictyol and 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic of its metabolite 
were absorbed. Following administration of eriocitrin, plasma exhibited an 
elevated resistance effect to lipid peroxidation. Eriocitrin metabolites 
functioning as antioxidant agents are discussed.

A new lignan glucoside was isolated from defatted sesame seed flour and its 
structure was established as sesamolinol diglucoside 
[2-(3-methoxy-4-(O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl 
(1-->6)-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside)phenoxyl)-6-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-cis-3,7-dioxabicyclo-(3.3.0)-octane] 
by mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A quantitative analysis of 
65 sesame seed samples showed that this sesamolinol diglucoside ranged from <5 
to 232 mg/100 g of seeds (98+/-57 mg/100 g) with no difference between white and 
black sesame seeds.

The monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric flavan-3-ol composition of wines, grape 
seeds, and skins from Vitis vinifera L. cv. Graciano, Tempranillo, and Cabernet 
Sauvignon has been studied using (1) fractionation by polyamide column 
chromatography followed by HPLC/ESI-MS analysis, (2) fractionation on C(18) 
Sep-Pak cartridges followed by reaction with vanillin and acid-catalyzed 
degradation in the presence of toluene-alpha-thiol (thiolysis). The content of 
monomers ((+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin), procyanidin dimers (B3, B1, B4, and 
B2), trimers (T2 and C1), and dimer gallates (B2-3-O-gallate, B2-3'-O-gallate, 
and B1-3-O-gallate) ranged from 76.93 to 133.18 mg/L in wines, from 2.30 to 8.21 
mg/g in grape seeds, and from 0.14 to 0.38 mg/g in grape skins. In wines, the 
polymeric fraction represented 77-84% of total flavan-3-ols and showed a mean 
degree of polymerization (mDP) value of 6.3-13.0. In grapes, the polymeric 
fraction represented 75-81% of total flavan-3-ols in seeds and 94-98% in skins 
and showed mDP values of 6.4-7.3 in seeds and 33.8-85.7 in skins. All the 
monomeric flavan-3-ols and oligomeric procyanidins found in wines were also 
present in seeds, although differences in their relative abundances were seen. 
The skin polymeric proanthocyanidins participated in the equilibration of the 
wine polymeric proanthocyanidin fraction, especially contributing to the polymer 
subunit composition and mDP.

Quercetin is a typical flavonoid present mostly as glycosides in plant foods; it 
has attracted much attention for its potential beneficial effects in disease 
prevention. In this study, we examined human volunteers after the short-term 
ingestion of onion, a vegetable rich in quercetin glucosides. The subjects were 
served diets containing onion slices (quercetin equivalent: 67.6-93.6 mg/day) 
with meals for 1 wk. Quercetin was only found in glucuronidase-sulfatase-treated 
plasma, and its concentration after 10 h of fasting increased from 0.04 +/- 0.04 
microM before the trial to 0.63 +/- 0.72 microM after the 1-wk trial. The 
quercetin content in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) after glucuronidase-sulfatase 
treatment corresponded to <1% of the alpha-tocopherol content. Human LDL 
isolated from the plasma after the trial showed little improvement of its 
resistance to copper ion-induced oxidation. It is therefore concluded that 
conjugated metabolites of quercetin accumulate exclusively in human blood plasma 
in the concentration range of 10(-7) approximately 10(-6) M after the short-term 
ingestion of vegetables rich in quercetin glucosides, although these metabolites 
are hardly incorporated into plasma LDL.

The intake of alkylresorcinols and lignans in Spain is unknown due to the lack 
of information on the content of these compounds in particular foods. This paper 
describes the development of the first alkylresorcinol and lignan database 
adapted to the Spanish diet, including foods items especially relevant for this 
population. The values of alkylresorcinols and lignans in common foods and 
beverages were collected from scientific publications in refereed journals, and 
other foods particularly consumed in Spain, for which values were not available, 
were analyzed by standardized protocols and included into the database. The 
Alignia database presents the content of alkylresorcinols in 88 food items and 
the lignan content of 593 foods and beverages. Using the database, the intake of 
lignans in Spain, calculated using data from the Food Composition Panel based on 
household consumption, was estimated to be 0.76 mg/day.

The presence of stilbenes in wine is becoming an important issue due to their 
claimed relation to a low incidence in coronary diseases and their increasing 
implication as cancer chemopreventive and neuroprotective agents. Total 
resveratrol content, quantified as glucoside and aglycone forms of resveratrol, 
has been determined in a survey of 45 Monastrell monovarietal Spanish red wine 
types (around 135 wine samples), belonging to Alicante and Bullas appellations. 
The average between ratio glucoside/aglycone forms of resveratrol in these wines 
was considerably high, ranging from 82 to 91% of resveratrol in its glycosidic 
form. This characteristic was observed in a high percentage of the studied 
wines, which were made under different winemaking procedures, and from different 
vintages (1995-2002). In addition, wines made using macerative fermentations 
with double amount of solid parts (""doble pasta"") reached the highest levels of 
total stilbene content expressed as resveratrol equivalent, i.e., 30 mg/L 
(average of 18.8 mg/L). It can be concluded that high resveratrol glucoside 
concentration and low free isomer content can be considered characteristics of 
the Monastrell variety, as it happens to red wines deriving from other varieties 
grown at warm climates. This fact, also observed for other French and Portuguese 
red varieties, might play an important role in food habits involving these types 
of wines.

We present a simultaneous liquid chromatographic method for the separation of 
two flavonoid compound families, flavanone glycosides (FGs) and polymethoxylated 
flavones (PMFs), which are usually found in citrus fruits species and varieties. 
This technique permits the quantitation of six FGs (narirutin, naringin, 
hesperidin, neohesperidin, didymin, poncirin) and six PMFs (sinensetin, 
hexamethoxyflavone, nobiletin, scutellarein, heptamethoxyflavone and 
tangeretin). This technique, to be used to characterize a citrus juice by its 
polyphenolic profile, has been applied to the determination of flavonoid 
compounds in grapefruit- and orange juice. Differentiation of orange juice 
varieties and mixtures containing tangor juice using polyphenolic profiles and 
flavonoid content has been achieved.

Fruits from 107 genotypes of Vaccinium L., Rubus L., and Ribes L., were analyzed 
for total anthocyanins (ACY), total phenolics (TPH), and antioxidant capacities 
as determined by oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC) and ferric reducing 
antioxidant power (FRAP). Fruit size was highly correlated (r = 0.84) with ACY 
within Vaccinium corymbosum L., but was not correlated to ACY across eight other 
Vaccinium species, or within 27 blackberry hybrids. Certain Vaccinium and Ribes 
fruits with pigmented flesh were lower in ACY, TPH, ORAC, and FRAP compared to 
those values in berries with nonpigmented flesh. ORAC values ranged from 19 to 
131 micromol Trolox equivalents/g in Vaccinium, from 13 to 146 in Rubus, and 
from 17 to 116 in Ribes. Though ACY may indicate TPH, the range observed in 
ACY/TPH ratios precludes prediction of ACY from TPH and vice versa for a single 
genotype. In general, TPH was more highly correlated to antioxidant capacity 
than ACY was. This study demonstrates the wide diversity of phytochemical levels 
and antioxidant capacities within and across three genera of small fruit.

The health-promoting effects of whole-grain wheat likely derive from phenolic 
compounds and other antioxidants that also make wheat a potential source of 
functional food ingredients. The objective of this study was to determine the 
effects of genotype and growing environment on the phenolic contents and 
antioxidant activities of alcohol-soluble extracts from commercial wheat 
cultivars. Total phenolic contents (TPCs), antioxidant activities (AOAs), and 
concentrations of six phenolic acids were measured in six red- and white-grained 
hard spring wheat genotypes grown at four diverse locations in Western Canada 
during the 2003 crop year. There were significant differences among genotypes 
and environments for TPC, AOA, and concentrations of all the phenolic acids 
measured. The predominant indicators of antioxidant potential, i.e., TPC, AOA, 
and ferulic acid (FA) concentration were highly intercorrelated (r > 0.72). For 
these indices, the Canada Western (CW) Red Spring wheat cultivars Neepawa and AC 
Elsa had the highest levels, whereas an analogous CW hard white spring wheat 
cultivar, AC Snowbird, had the lowest levels. Grain color did not appear to be a 
factor in the expression of antioxidant-related parameters. For both TPC and 
AOA, as well as for vanillic acid, syringic acid, and ferulic acid, 
environmental effects were considerably larger than genotype effects. Neither 
growing temperature nor rainfall from anthesis to maturity appeared to be 
related to the environmental variation that was observed. Genotype x environment 
interaction was small for all parameters compared with genotype and location 
effects and was significant only for TPC. Genotype variation for antioxidant 
properties indicates that it would be possible to select for these quantitative 
traits in a breeding program. However, the significant environmental variation 
observed would delay and/or complicate this process.

A HPLC-MS procedure for the sensitive and specific analysis of the black tea 
flavonoid theaflavin in human plasma and urine was developed. Levels were 
measured after enzymatic deconjugation, extraction into ethyl acetate, and 
separation by HPLC, using tandem mass spectrometry as a detecting system. Two 
healthy volunteers consumed 700 mg theaflavins, equivalent to about 30 cups of 
black tea. The maximum concentration detected in blood plasma was 1.0 microg 
l(-1) in a sample collected after 2 h. The concentration in urine also peaked 
after 2 h at 4.2 microg l(-1). Hence, only minute amounts of theaflavins can be 
detected in plasma and urine samples of healthy volunteers after ingestion.

Epidemiological studies suggest that consumption of flavonol-rich diets 
decreases the risk of developing heart disease and certain cancers. Recent 
studies have detected flavonol conjugates in blood and urine following various 
dietary interventions. To assess to what extent flavonols also accumulate in 
tissues, where they might be expected to exert anti-carcinogenic and 
anti-atherogenic effects, [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside was synthesized and 
fed to rats. After 60 min, 93.6% of the ingested radioactivity was recovered 
from the intestine, incorporated into 18 metabolites that had undergone 
deglycosylation followed by varying degrees of glucuronidation, methylation, 
and/or sulfation. [(14)C]Quercetin, the aglycon of the radiolabeled substrate, 
was present in the intestine and in trace amounts in the liver but was not 
detected in the plasma and kidneys. The original [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside 
was detected exclusively in the intestine, where it accounted for only 26.2% of 
the radioactivity. The remainder of the recovered radioactivity was located 
mainly in the plasma, liver, and kidneys as (14)C-labeled metabolites. However, 
compared to the quantities in the gastrointestinal tract, the levels of 
metabolites in plasma and body tissues were very low, indicating only limited 
absorption into the blood stream. The data demonstrate that 
quercetin-4'-glucoside, which is a major flavonol in onions, undergoes rapid and 
extensive metabolism in the intestine, and this appears not to be associated to 
any extent with transport across the gut wall into the blood stream.

Scottish-grown red raspberries are a rich source of vitamin C and phenolics, 
most notably, the anthocyanins cyanidin-3-sophoroside, 
cyanidin-3-(2(G)-glucosylrutinoside), and cyanidin-3-glucoside, and two 
ellagitannins, sanguiin H-6 and lambertianin C, which are present together with 
trace levels of flavonols, ellagic acid, and hydroxycinnamates. The antioxidant 
capacity of the fresh fruit and the levels of vitamin C and phenolics were not 
affected by freezing. When fruit were stored at 4 degrees C for 3 days and then 
at 18 degrees C for 24 h, mimicking the route fresh fruit takes after harvest to 
the supermarket and onto the consumer's table, anthocyanin levels were 
unaffected while vitamin C levels declined and those of elligitannins increased, 
and overall, there was no effect on the antioxidant capacity of the fruit. It is 
concluded, therefore, that freshly picked, fresh commercial, and frozen 
raspberries all contain similar levels of phytochemicals and antioxidants per 
serving.

Bioavailability and metabolism of orange juice flavanones in humans: impact of a

The bioavailability of dietary phytochemicals may be influenced by the food 
matrix in which they are consumed. In this study the impact of a full-fat yogurt 
on the bioavailability and metabolism of orange juice flavanones was 
investigated. Human plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period after the 
consumption of 250 mL of orange juice containing a total of 168 micromol of 
hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside and 12 micromol of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside, with and 
without 150 mL of full-fat yogurt. The juice also contained 1 g of paracetamol 
and 5 g of lactulose. HPLC-MS(2) analysis revealed the accumulation of 
hesperetin-7-O-glucuronide, and an unassigned hesperetin-O-glucuronide 
metabolite in plasma reached a peak concentration (C(max)) of 924 +/- 224 
nmol/L, 4.4 +/- 0.5 h (T(max)) after orange juice ingestion. The T(max) is 
indicative of absorption in the colon. When the juice was consumed with yogurt, 
neither the C(max) at 661 +/- 170 nmol/L nor the T(max) at 5.1 +/- 0.4 h were 
significantly different from those obtained with juice alone. The two hesperetin 
glucuronides were also excreted in urine along with a third 
hesperetin-O-glucuronide, two hesperetin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfates, a 
hesperetin-O-diglucuronide, a naringenin-O-diglucuronide, and, tentatively 
identified, naringenin-7-O-glucuronide and naringenin-4'-O-glucuronide. This 
indicates the occurrence of substantial, postabsorption, phase II metabolism 
prior to urinary excretion. The quantity of flavanone metabolites excreted 0-5 h 
after orange juice ingestion was significantly reduced by yogurt, but over the 
full 0-24 h urine collection period, the amounts excreted, corresponding to ca. 
7.0% of intake, were not affected by the addition of yogurt to the drink. Nor 
did yogurt have a significant effect on gastric emptying, as determined by 
plasma paracetamol levels, or on the mouth to cecum transit time of the head of 
the meal, assessed by measurement of lactulose-derived breath hydrogen. There is 
also a discussion of the merits of studies of the absorption and metabolism of 
flavanones based on direct analysis of metabolites by HPLC-MS and the more 
traditional indirect approach where samples are treated with a mollusc 
glucuronidase/sulfatase preparation prior to HPLC analysis of the released 
aglycones.

Plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period after the consumption by 
humans of 200 g of strawberries, containing 222 micromol of pelargonidin-3- 
O-glucoside, with and without cream. The main metabolite, a pelargonidin- 
O-glucuronide, reached a peak plasma concentration ( C max) of 274 +/- 24 nmol/L 
after 1.1 +/- 0.4 h ( t max) when only strawberries were ingested. When the 
strawberries were eaten with cream, the C max was not statistically different 
but the t max at 2.4 +/- 0.5 h was delayed significantly ( p < 0.001). The 
pelargonidin- O-glucuronide, along with smaller quantities of other metabolites, 
was also excreted in urine in quantities corresponding to ca. 1% of anthocyanin 
intake. The quantities excreted over the 0-24 h collection period were not 
influenced significantly by cream. However, the 0-2 h excretion of anthocyanin 
metabolites was significantly lower when the strawberries were eaten with cream, 
whereas the reverse occurred during with the 5-8 h excretion period. In keeping 
with these observations, measurement of plasma paracetamol and breath hydrogen 
revealed that cream delayed gastric emptying and extended mouth to cecum transit 
time.

A national sampling plan was developed to select the most widely used 
isoflavone-containing foods in the United States. Foods were selected based on 
their retail volume and sampled in five geographical areas representing seven 
metropolitan areas. Isoflavones were analyzed from composite samples, raw and 
cooked, and reported by brand. Quality control measures were evaluated 
throughout the study. Isoflavone levels ranged from 1 microg/g in soy sauces to 
540 microg/g in tempeh. Soymilk and tofu represented the major portion of soy 
foods evaluated. These data will appear in the electronic version of USDA 
Handbook No. 8 of Food Composition Data in 1999.

Neochlorogenic acid (3-CQA) and cryptochlorogenic acid (4-CQA), isolated from 
prune (Prunus domestica L.), were identified by NMR and MS analyses. In 
addition, the quantity of chlorogenic acid isomers in prune were measured by 
HPLC. These isomers, 3-CQA, 4-CQA, and chlorogenic acid (5-CQA), were contained 
in the ratio 78.7:18. 4:3.9, respectively. 4-CQA was identified and quantified 
in prune for the first time, and relatively high amounts of this isomer were 
characteristic. Antioxidative activities of the chlorogenic acid isomers, such 
as scavenging activity on superoxide anion radicals and inhibitory effect 
against oxidation of methyl linoleate, were also evaluated. Each isomer showed 
antioxidative activities which were almost the same.

The antioxidant polyphenols in cacao liquor, a major ingredient of chocolate and 
cocoa, have been characterized as flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidin oligomers. 
In this study, various cacao products were analyzed by normal-phase HPLC, and 
the profiles and quantities of the polyphenols present, grouped by molecular 
size (monomers to approximately oligomers), were compared. Individual cacao 
polyphenols, flavan-3-ols (catechin and epicatechin), and dimeric (procyanidin 
B2), trimeric (procyanidin C1), and tetrameric (cinnamtannin A2) 
proanthocyanidins, and galactopyranosyl-ent-(-)-epicatechin (2alpha-->7, 
4alpha-->8)-(-)-epicatechin (Gal-EC-EC), were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC 
and/or HPLC/MS. The profile of monomers (catechins) and proanthocyanidin in dark 
chocolate was similar to that of cacao liquor, while the ratio of flavan-3-ols 
to the total amount of monomeric and oligomeric polyphenols in the case of pure 
cocoa powder was higher than that in the case of cacao liquor or chocolate.

(-)-epicatechin is one of the most potent antioxidants present in the human 
diet. Particularly high levels are found in black tea, apples, and chocolate. 
High intake of catechins has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular 
diseases. There have been several reports concerning the bioavailability of 
catechins, however, the chemical structure of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in 
blood, tissues, and urine remains unclear. In the present study, we purified and 
elucidated the chemical structure of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in human and 
rat urine after oral administration. Three metabolites were purified from human 
urine including (-)-epicatechin-3'-O-glucuronide, 
4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-3'-O-glucuronide, and 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-5 
or 7-O-glucuronide, according to 1H- and 13C-NMR, HMBC, and LC-MS analyses. The 
metabolites purified from rat urine were 3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin, 
(-)-epicatechin-7-O-glucuronide, and 
3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-7-O-glucuronide. These compounds were also detected 
in the blood of humans and rats by LC-MS. The presence of these metabolites in 
blood and urine suggests that catechins are metabolized and circulated in the 
body after administration of catechin-containing foods.

Catechins are polyphenolic plant compounds (flavonoids) that may offer 
significant health benefits to humans. These benefits stem largely from their 
anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, and antimutagenic properties. Recent 
epidemiological studies suggest that the consumption of flavonoid-containing 
foods is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Chocolate is a 
natural cocoa bean-based product that reportedly contains high levels of 
monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric catechins. We have applied solid-liquid 
extraction and liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical 
ionization-mass spectrometry to the identification and determination of the 
predominant monomeric catechins, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin, in a baking 
chocolate Standard Reference Material (NIST Standard Reference Material 2384). 
(+)-Catechin and (-)-epicatechin are detected and quantified in chocolate 
extracts on the basis of selected-ion monitoring of their protonated [M + H](+) 
molecular ions. Tryptophan methyl ester is used as an internal standard. The 
developed method has the capacity to accurately quantify as little as 0.1 
microg/mL (0.01 mg of catechin/g of chocolate) of either catechin in chocolate 
extracts, and the method has additionally been used to certify (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin levels in the baking chocolate Standard Reference Material. This 
is the first reported use of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry for the 
quantitative determination of monomeric catechins in chocolate and the only 
report certifying monomeric catechin levels in a food-based Standard Reference 
Material.

Two varieties of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. crispa and capitata) and one 
variety of escarole (Cichorium endivia var. latifolium) were chosen due to their 
different browning sensitivity during storage as minimally processed products. 
The changes in the compositions and contents of the primary polyphenolic 
compounds were investigated during the first few hours of storage and then after 
1, 2, 3, and 6 days of storage at 6°C and revealed sharp variations. Browning 
development, activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase, and concentration of 
ascorbic acid were also examined during storage. The content of chicoric acid, 
which was the most abundant phenolic compound, varied substantially during the 
first 24 hr of storage and between the different varieties. Oak leaf lettuce, 
which was the most sensitive variety to browning, was characterized by a higher 
maintained chicoric acid level with a constant decreased chlorogenic acid level 
during the storage period. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Browning development is 
responsible for the short shelf life of minimally processed vegetables, such as 
lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Polyphenolic compounds, as substrates of enzymatic 
reactions, are involved in the browning susceptibility of leaves. Comparisons of 
the profiles and contents of these compounds in different leaves showed dramatic 
variations during storage. This study provides additional information to better 
control, optimize minimally processed produce and select more suitable leaves 
for the fresh-cut industry.

Hesperidin is the predominant polyphenol consumed from citrus fruits and juices. 
However, hesperidin is proposed to have limited bioavailability due to the 
rutinoside moiety attached to the flavonoid. The aim of this study was to 
demonstrate in human subjects that the removal of the rhamnose group to yield 
the corresponding flavonoid glucoside (i.e., hesperetin-7-glucoside) will 
improve the bioavailability of the aglycone hesperetin. Healthy volunteers 
(n=16) completed the double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Subjects 
randomly consumed hesperetin equivalents supplied as orange juice with natural 
hesperidin (""low dose""), orange juice treated with hesperidinase enzyme to yield 
hesperetin-7-glucoside, and orange juice fortified to obtain 3 times more 
hesperidin than naturally present (""high dose""). The area under the curve (AUC) 
for total plasma hesperetin of subjects consuming hesperetin-7-glucoside juice 
was 2-fold higher than that of subjects consuming the ""low"" dose hesperidin 
juice [3.45+/-1.27 vs. 1.16+/-0.52 mmol/(L.h), respectively, P>0.0001]. The AUC 
for hesperetin after consuming the hesperetin-7-glucoside juice was improved to 
the level of the ""high"" dose hesperidin juice [4.16+/-1.50 mmol/(L.h)]. The peak 
plasma concentrations (C(max)) of hesperetin were 4-fold higher (2.60+/-1.07 
mmol/L, P<0.0001) after subjects consumed hesperetin-7-glucoside juice compared 
with those consuming ""low"" dose hesperidin juice (0.48 +/- 0.27 mmol/L), and 
1.5-fold higher than those consuming ""high"" dose hesperidin juice (1.05+/-0.25 
mmol/L). The corresponding T(max) was much faster (0.6+/-0.1 h, P<0.0001) after 
subjects consumed hesperetin-7-glucoside juice compared with ""low"" dose 
(7.0+/-3.0 h) and ""high"" dose (7.4+/-2.0 h) hesperidin juices. The results of 
this study demonstrated that the bioavailability of hesperidin was modulated by 
enzymatic conversion to hesperetin-7-glucoside, thus changing the absorption 
site from the colon to the small intestine. This may affect future interventions 
concerning the health benefits of citrus flavonoids.

Recent studies have shown that the mammalian lignans enterodiol (END) and 
enterolactone (ENL) are biotransformed in vitro by hepatic microsomes from rats 
and humans to various metabolites carrying one additional hydroxy group either 
at the aromatic or at the aliphatic moiety. To clarify whether these metabolites 
are also formed in vivo, each lignan was administered intraduodenally at a dose 
of 10 mg/kg of bw to bile duct-catheterized female Wistar rats and the 6 h bile 
analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS. With END-dosed rats, three products of aromatic and 
two of aliphatic monohydroxylation were found, whereas six aromatic and five 
aliphatic monohydroxylated biliary metabolites were detected after 
administration of ENL. The metabolites hydroxylated at the aromatic rings were 
unequivocally identified by comparison with synthetic reference compounds. The 
structures of the in vivo metabolites arising from aliphatic hydroxylation could 
not be completely elucidated; they were identical with some of the formerly 
reported microsomal products according to GC retention times and mass spectra. 
Significant amounts of most of the metabolites of the mammalian lignans 
identified in bile were also found in the urine of female rats after oral 
administration of 10 mg/kg of bw END or ENL and in the urine of female and male 
Wistar rats after they had been fed a diet containing 5% flaxseed. Thus, the 
mammalian lignans END and ENL give rise to several hydroxylated metabolites in 
vivo, which may contribute to the biological effects of these important food 
constituents.

The phenolic and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values have been 
measured in six fresh and frozen vegetables (beet green, spinach, broccoli, 
carrot, onion, and celery) from the same cultivar by analyzing the whole juice 
(WJ) and the acetonic extract of the squeezed pulp. To exploit the effect of the 
acid environment on the stability and recovery of the phenolics, perchloric acid 
(PCA) was added directly to WJ and to the pulp before the extraction with 
acetone. In both fresh and frozen vegetables, PCA markedly increased the 
recovery of phenolics extracted from the pulp, but PCA had no effect on the WJ. 
Four of six frozen vegetables showed lower phenolic and ORAC values than the 
fresh vegetables, whereas in the other two cases, values were significantly 
higher compared to fresh samples. Among the fresh vegetables, beet green showed 
the highest ORAC and phenolic values; however, when measured in two different 
cultivars of beet green, the ORAC value showed as much as 4.5-fold variation, 
whereas total phenolics and flavonoids showed 1.2- and 3.5-fold variations, 
respectively. The results show that total phenolics and ORAC, compared in fresh 
and frozen vegetables, represent an index of the mildness of blanching in the 
industry of frozen vegetables and provide a measure of the gap in antioxidants 
in the diet of people who consume frozen instead of fresh vegetables. The plant 
genotype is an important source of variability in the ORAC value, which can be 
conveniently used to increase the intake of antioxidants from vegetables.

Vegetables are the most important sources of phenolics in the Mediterranean 
diet. Phenolics, especially flavonoids, are suggested as being essential 
bioactive compounds providing health benefits. In this study, twenty-seven 
vegetables, fifteen aromatic herbs and some spices consumed in Central Italy 
(the Marches region) were studied to reveal total phenolic, flavonoid and 
flavanol content as well as their antioxidant capacity measured by the oxygen 
radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. A comparison in terms of antioxidant 
capacity was made between different salads, as well as between salads to which 
aromatic herbs had been added. Lemon balm and marjoram at a concentration of 1.5 
% w/w increased by 150 % and 200 % respectively the antioxidant capacity of a 
salad portion. A 200 g portion of a salad enriched with marjoram corresponded to 
an intake of 200 (SD 10) mg phenolics and 4000 (SD 300) ORAC units (micromol 
Trolox equivalents). Olive oils and wine or apple vinegars were the salad 
dressings that provided the highest increase in antioxidant capacity. Among the 
spices tested, cumin and fresh ginger made the most significant contribution to 
the antioxidant capacity. The results are useful in surveying the antioxidant 
parameters of vegetables, herbs and spices produced and consumed in our 
geographical area as well as in quantifying the daily intake of phenolics and 
ORAC units. The results can be used in public health campaigns to stimulate the 
consumption of vegetables able to provide significant health protection in order 
to prevent chronic diseases.

A mandarin-type citrus fruit, ponkan (Citrus reticulata), was processed by 
in-line, chopper pulper, and hand-press extractions to investigate the effect of 
extraction method on the concentrations of bioactive compounds in processed 
juice. Concentrations of polymethoxylated flavones (tangeretin, nobiletin, and 
sinensetin) and beta-cryptoxanthin in juice, and inhibitory activities against 
arachidonate cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenases of the juice extract were 
analyzed. The juice processed by hand-press extraction contained the largest 
amounts of nobiletin (3.56 mg/100 mL), tangeretin (4.10 mg/100 mL), and 
sinensetin (0.13 mg/100 mL). Concentrations of beta-cryptoxanthin were 0.66, 
0.59, 0.55, and 0.50 mg/100 mL in chopper pulper, in-line (5/64 in.), in-line 
(8/64 in.) and hand-press juices, respectively. Both extracts of in-line juices 
showed greater inhibitory activity toward platelet 12-lipoxygenase than the 
others. The inhibitory effect of hand-press juice extract on platelet 
cyclooxygenase activity was remarkable among juice extracts. All juice extracts 
effectively inhibited polymorphonuclear 5-lipoxygenase activity at nearly the 
same rate.

High-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) and mass spectrometric (MS) 
procedures were developed to determine lignans in flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) 
and chaparral (Larrea tridentata). Flaxseed contains high levels of 
phytoestrogens. Chaparral has been associated with acute nonviral toxic 
hepatitis and contains lignans that are structurally similar to known estrogenic 
compounds. Both flaxseed and chaparral products have been marketed as dietary 
supplements. A mild enzyme hydrolysis procedure to prevent the formation of 
artifacts in the isolation step was used in the determination of 
secoisolariciresinol in flaxseed products. HPLC with ultraviolet spectral (UV) 
or MS detection was used as the determinative steps. HPLC procedures with UV 
detection and mass spectrometry were developed to characterize the phenolic 
components, including lignans and flavonoids, of chaparral and to direct 
fractionation studies for the bioassays.

Cranberry, which is rich in polyphenols, including anthocyanins and 
proanthocyanidins, has been found to have various effects beneficial to human 
health, including prevention of urinary tract infections. These effects have 
been associated with polyphenols in the fruit. We investigated the excretion of 
anthocyanins in human urine after ingestion of cranberry juice. Eleven healthy 
volunteers consumed 200 ml of cranberry juice containing 650.8 microg total 
anthocyanins. Urine samples were collected within 24 h before and after 
consumption. Six of 12 anthocyanins identified in cranberry were quantified in 
human urine by HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization and tandem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS-MS). Among these, peonidin 3-O-galactoside, the second 
most plentiful anthocyanin in the juice, was found most abundantly in urine 
within 24 h, corresponding to 41.5 nmol (56.1% of total anthocyanins). The 
urinary levels of anthocyanins reached a maximum between 3 and 6 h after 
ingestion, and the recovery of total anthocyanins in the urine over 24 h was 
estimated to be 5.0% of the amount consumed. This study found high absorption 
and excretion of cranberry anthocyanins in human urine.

Changes occurring in the concentrations of alpha-tocopherol, total phenols, and 
complex phenols linked to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol (fractions FII and FIV) and 
p-hydroxyphenylethanol (FIII) during storage of virgin olive oil under 
environmental conditions were studied. Under diffused light, alpha-tocopherol 
was decomposed by 79% in 4 months, whereas <45% of the phenols were lost during 
the same period. Among the phenols, FII showed the least stability, and 
decreased by 72% in 6 months. Total phenols, FIII, and FIV recorded reductions 
in the range of 57-63% in 6 months. When the oil was stored in the dark, 
alpha-tocopherol, total phenols, FIII, and FIV exhibited similar profiles of 
degradation, reducing by 39-45% in the first 6 months and 50-62% in 12 months. 
FII was the least stable compound in the dark and recorded a loss of 64% in 6 
months and 79% in 12 months. The levels of the above antioxidants were further 
related to peroxide formation. Remaining levels of these compounds at PV = 20 
meq/kg ranged between 50 and 73% under diffused light and between 40 and 62% in 
the dark.

Four cultivars of strawberries (Senga Sengana, BFr77111, Elsanta, and Honeoye) 
were studied for their content of antioxidants, total antioxidant capacity, and 
low molecular weight carbohydrates in relation to harvest year, ripening stage, 
and cold storage. For ascorbic acid, chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, and total 
antioxidative capacity, measured in both water-soluble and water-insoluble 
extracts, there was a 2-5-fold variation among cultivars. Unripe berries 
contained lower concentrations of chlorogenic acid and p-coumaric acid and also 
quercetin and kaempferol compared with riper berries. During cold storage for up 
to 3 days, relatively few changes in the concentration of the different 
antioxidants occurred. The concentrations of several investigated parameters 
were interrelated, for example, for ascorbic acid and water-soluble antioxidant 
capacity and for ellagic acid and water-insoluble antioxidant capacity. The 
dominating sugars in strawberries were fructose and glucose, but considerable 
amounts of sucrose were also present, and their contents varied among cultivars, 
giving a predicted glycemic index of approximately 81. Verbascose, raffinose, 
and stachyose were found in only minor amounts. The study shows that the 
concentration of a number of bioactive compounds in strawberries varied 
according to cultivar, ripening stage, and storage. This information should make 
it possible to select strawberries with an optimal content of bioactive 
compounds.

Dietary phenols are antioxidants, and their consumption might contribute to the 
prevention of cardiovascular disease. Coffee and tea are major dietary sources 
of phenols. Dietary phenols are metabolized extensively in the body. Lack of 
quantitative data on their metabolites hinders a proper evaluation of the 
potential biological effects of dietary phenols in vivo. The aim of this study 
was to identify and quantify the phenolic acid metabolites of chlorogenic acid 
(major phenol in coffee), quercetin-3-rutinoside (major flavonol in tea) and 
black tea phenols in humans, and determine the site of metabolism. Healthy 
humans (n = 20) with an intact colon participated in a dietary controlled 
crossover study, and we identified and quantified approximately 60 potential 
phenolic acid metabolites in urine. Half of the ingested chlorogenic acid and 
43% of the tea phenols were metabolized to hippuric acid. Quercetin-3-rutinoside 
was metabolized mainly to phenylacetic acids, i.e., 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid 
(36%), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (8%) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic 
acid (5%). In contrast, in seven humans without a colon, we found only traces of 
phenolic acid metabolites in urine after they had ingested chlorogenic acid and 
quercetin-3-rutinoside. This implies that the colonic microflora convert most of 
these dietary phenols into metabolites that then reach the circulation. 
Metabolites of dietary phenols have lower antioxidant activity than their parent 
compounds; therefore, the contribution of dietary phenols to antioxidant 
activity in vivo might be lower than expected from in vitro tests.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the morphogenetic efficiency of the 
new flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) cultivar Silesia. The plant material consisted 
of five ecotypes of Silesia seeds selected by determining the fatty acid 
composition in individual plants. Thus, five ecotypes with different fatty acid 
compositions were applied for germination, and the resulting seedlings were used 
for callus induction. The observed in vitro morphogenic response of explants to 
the used callus induction medium was 100%, followed by varying development of 
shoots, with the highest value being 17 shoots per callus, with an average 
length of 7.15 cm (for ecotype 1). The biochemical analyses showed 
photosynthetic pigments were significantly affected by the tested ecotypes. The 
main conclusion is that the selection of plant material as a source of tissue 
cultures is crucial for efficient regeneration and organogenesis. One factor 
potentially influencing these processes is fatty acid composition and the ratio 
of linoleic to α-linolenic acid. A ratio ranging from 1.36 to 1.68 in the source 
material (seeds) used for initiation of tissue cultures resulted in the highest 
efficiency of shoot regeneration and number of obtained shoots per callus. A 
strong negative correlation (-0.78) was observed between shoot regeneration 
efficiency and the ratio of linoleic to α-linolenic acid in seeds from which the 
explants were obtained. Moreover, an efficient protocol of micropropagation from 
callus tissue was established for the new flax cultivar Silesia. An interesting 
insight into the metabolism of the obtained regenerants allowed us to determine 
the relationship between the content of chlorophyll and rhizogenesis efficiency. 
For these two parameters, the calculated correlation coefficient was 0.66. A 
strong relationship (high correlation coefficient: 0.79) was also established 
between flavonoid content and length of obtained regenerants, pointing to the 
developmental role of flavonoids.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the phenolic antioxidant and squalene 
content in a range of olive and seed oils. A mean of 290 +/- 38 (SEM) mg 
squalene/100 g was detected. However, while there was a weak significant 
difference between extra virgin (424 +/- 21 mg/kg) and refined virgin (340 +/- 
31 mg/100 g; P<0.05) olive oils, highly significant differences were evident 
between extra virgin olive oils (P<0.0001) refined virgin olive oils (P<0.0001) 
and seed oils (24 +/- 5 mg/100 g). While seed oils were devoid, on average, the 
olive oils contained 196 +/- 19 mg/kg total phenolics as judged by HPLC 
analysis, but the value for extra virgin (232 +/- 15 mg/kg) was significantly 
higher than that of refined virgin olive oil (62 +/- 12 mg/kg; P<0.0001). 
Appreciable quantities of simple phenols (hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol) were 
detected in olive oils, with significant differences between extravirgin (41.87 
+/- 6.17) and refined virgin olive oils (4.72 +/- 215; P<0.01). The major linked 
phenols were secoiridoids and lignans. Although extra virgin contained higher 
concentrations of secoiridoids (27.72 +/- 6.84) than refined olive oils (9.30 
+/- 3.81) this difference was not significant. On the other hand, the 
concentration of lignans was significantly higher (P<0.001) in extra virgin 
(41.53 +/- 3.93) compared to refined virgin olive oils (7.29 +/- 2.56). All 
classes of phenolics were shown to be potent antioxidants. In future 
epidemiologic studies, both the nature and source of olive oil consumed should 
be differentiated in ascertaining cancer risk.

Because olives represent an important component of the Mediterranean diet, it is 
necessary to establish unequivocal identification and quantitation of the major 
potential antioxidant phenolic compounds they contain. The major phenolic 
antioxidants in two types of brined olives were isolated and purified by 
semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography. Structural analysis was 
conducted using UV spectrophotometry, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy. In particular, completely assigned 1H and 13C NMR data 
are presented and errors in literature data are corrected. The data show that 
tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, 3-(3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid (dihydrocaffeic 
acid), dihydro-p-coumaric acid (phloretic acid), the phenylpropanoid glucosides 
acteoside (verbascoside) and isoacteoside, along with the flavonoids luteolin 
and apigenin are major components of the phenolic fraction of brined black 
olives. Brined green olives contain only hydroxytyrosol and traces of other 
minor phenolics. Brined olives contain even higher concentrations of phenolic 
antioxidants than olive oil and may, therefore, be more important modulators of 
cancer chemopreventive activity.

A valid method using liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray 
ionization (ESI) ion trap mass spectrometry was established for the study of the 
absorbed and metabolic components of a Chinese medicine 'Shuangdan' granule in 
rat plasma after oral administration. The plasma samples were acidified with 1M 
hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) of two-fold volume 
for three times. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a Zorbax 
SB-C18 column with a linear gradient whereas 0.1% acetic acid/water/acetonitrile 
was used as mobile phase. Mass spectra were acquired in both negative and 
positive modes. More than 20 components including 16 components from 'Shuangdan' 
granule and 5 metabolites were simultaneously identified by comparing their mass 
spectra and retention behavior with reference compounds or literature data. The 
results proved that the established method could be used to identify the 
structure of active components responsible for the pharmacological effects of 
'Shuangdan' granule.

Spinach leaves harvested at three maturity stages from eight commercial 
cultivars (CC) and eight advanced breeding lines (ABL) were evaluated for oxygen 
radical absorbing capacity (ORAC), total phenolics, and flavonoid composition 
and content. ABL had higher levels of total phenolics, total flavonoids, and 
ORAC than CC. Midmaturity spinach leaves had higher levels of total phenolics, 
total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity than immature and mature leaves. The 
contents of individual flavonoids varied in response to maturation, with the 
predominant glucuronated flavones decreasing and patuletin and spinacetin 
derivatives increasing. Both total phenolics and total flavonoids correlated 
well with ORAC (r(xy)() = 0.78 and 0.81, respectively) demonstrating that 
flavonoids were major contributors to antioxidant capacity. Our results indicate 
that spinach genotypes should be harvested at the midmaturity stage for 
consumers to benefit from elevated levels of health promoting flavonoids present 
in the leaves. Additionally, plant breeders can select for increased phenolic 
content to increase antioxidant capacity of spinach genotypes.

The effects of genetic, pre-harvest (season of harvest, spear diameter, spear 
portion and spear tip color) and post-harvest factors (storage and domestic 
preparation practices, e.g., peeling and cooking) on total phenolic, flavonoid 
and ascorbic acid content of white asparagus spears and their correlation with 
antioxidant capacity (DPPH and FRAP) were studied. Results showed that genetic 
material was important for the total phenolic content but not season of harvest, 
spear diameter or storage. Violet spear tips and apical spear portions showed 
the largest amount of total phenolics. Peeling did not affect total phenolics in 
fresh asparagus, whereas it reduced their content in stored asparagus, while 
cooking resulted in an increase in both fresh and stored asparagus. However, the 
soluble extract of total phenolics and flavonoids were minor and the missing 
significance of phenolics and flavonoids in antioxidant capacity of white 
asparagus spears depends on these small amounts.

An HPLC method, using detection after postcolumn derivatization with 
p-dimethylaminocynnamaldehyde (DMACA), was developed for the quantitative 
analysis of individual flavanols in food. This method was applied to flavanol 
determination in 56 different kinds of Spanish food products, including fruit, 
vegetables, legumes, beverages (cider, coffee, beer, tea, and wine), and 
chocolate. The determined compounds corresponded to the catechins and 
proanthocyanidin dimers and trimers usually present in food and, therefore, they 
were representative of the flavanols of low degree of polymerization consumed 
with the diet. The data generated could be used for calculation of the dietary 
intake of either individual or total flavanols, which would allow the further 
establishment of epidemiological correlations with the incidence of chronic 
diseases. Similar flavanol profiles were found in the different samples of a 
similar type of product, even though important variations could exist in the 
concentrations of total and individual flavanols among them. This was attributed 
to factors such as sample origin, stage of ripeness, post-harvesting 
conservation, and processing. Total flavanol contents varied from nondetectable 
in most of the vegetables to 184 mg/100 g found in a sample of broad bean. 
Substantial amounts were also found in some fruits, such as plum and apple, as 
well as in tea and red wine. Epicatechin was the most abundant flavanol, 
followed by catechin and procyanidin B2. In general, catechins were found in all 
the flavanol-containing products, but the presence of gallocatechins was only 
relevant in pomegranate, broad bean, lentil, grape, wine, beer, and tea, and 
most of the berries. Galloyled flavanols were only detected in strawberry, 
medlar, grape, and tea.

The aim of this study was to quantify the contents of individual quercetin 
glycosides in red, yellow and chartreuse onion by High Performance Liquid 
Chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Acid hydrolysis of individual quercetin 
glycosides using 6 M hydrochloric acid guided to identify and separate quercetin 
7,4'-diglucoside, quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin 4'-glucoside, and quercetin. 
The contents of total quercetin glycosides varied extensively among three 
varieties (ranged from 16.10 to 103.93 mg/g DW). Quercetin was the predominant 
compound that accounted mean 32.21 mg/g DW in red onion (43.6% of the total) and 
127.92 mg/g DW in chartreuse onion (78.3% of the total) followed by quercetin 
3-glucoside (28.83 and 24.16 mg/g DW) respectively. Quercetin 3-glucoside levels 
were much higher in yellow onion (43.85 mg/g DW) followed by quercetin 
30.08 mg/g DW. Quercetin 4'-glucoside documented the lowest amount that 
documented mean 2.4% of the total glycosides. The varied contents of glycosides 
present in the different onion varieties were significant.

Grape pomace is commonly considered a waste product of monovarietal red wine 
production. Methods: HPLC-DAD analysis was performed to determine the polyphenol 
and flavonoid contents of all the extracts obtained from Montepulciano d'Abruzzo 
red wine and grape skins whereas, GC-MS was applied to the determination of 
fatty acid composition in grape seeds oil. Biological characterization involves 
antioxidant and antimicrobial assays for all the extracts and seeds oil; Their 
ability to inhibit α-glucosidase, α-amylase, α-tyrosinase, and ChE enzymes was 
also detected, together with anti-inflammatory activity on wine, grape skin 
extracts, and seeds oil by lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and LPS-stimulated macrophage 
release assays. Data indicate significative polyphenols content (199.31 ± 7.21 
mgGAE/g), antioxidant (CUPRAC assay (1036.98 mgTE/g)), enzymatic inhibition 
(α-tyrosinase: 151.30 ± 1.20 mgKAE/g) and anti-inflammatory activities for 
wine-organic extract 2, while the antimicrobial activity of grape skin decoction 
is higher than those reported by wine extracts on three bacterial strains. 
Interestingly only dealcoholized wine and wine-aqueous extract exerts inhibitory 
effects on α-glucosidase (20.62 ± 0.23 mmolACAE/g and 19.81 ± 0.03 mmolACAE/g, 
respectively), while seeds oil is rich in oleic and linoleic acids. These 
results confirm the strong antioxidant properties of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo 
grape pomace, suggesting the potential use of this waste product as functional 
food supplements in the human diet and in cosmeceutics.

The health-relevant functionality of 10 thermally processed Peruvian Andean 
grains (five cereals, three pseudocereals, and two legumes) was evaluated for 
potential type 2 diabetes-relevant antihyperglycemia and antihypertension 
activity using in vitro enzyme assays. Inhibition of enzymes relevant for 
managing early stages of type 2 diabetes such as hyperglycemia-relevant 
alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase and hypertension-relevant angiotensin 
I-converting enzyme (ACE) were assayed along with the total phenolic content, 
phenolic profiles, and antioxidant activity based on the 
1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical assay. Purple corn (Zea mays L.) (cereal) 
exhibited high free radical scavenging-linked antioxidant activity (77%) and had 
the highest total phenolic content (8 +/- 1 mg of gallic acid equivalents/g of 
sample weight) and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity (51% at 5 mg of sample 
weight). The major phenolic compound in this cereal was protocatechuic acid (287 
+/- 15 microg/g of sample weight). Pseudocereals such as Quinoa (Chenopodium 
quinoa Willd) and Kañiwa (Chenopodium pallidicaule Aellen) were rich in 
quercetin derivatives (1,131 +/- 56 and 943 +/- 35 microg [expressed as 
quercetin aglycone]/g of sample weight, respectively) and had the highest 
antioxidant activity (86% and 75%, respectively). Andean legumes (Lupinus 
mutabilis cultivars SLP-1 and H-6) inhibited significantly the 
hypertension-relevant ACE (52% at 5 mg of sample weight). No alpha-amylase 
inhibitory activity was found in any of the evaluated Andean grains. This in 
vitro study indicates the potential of combination of Andean whole grain 
cereals, pseudocereals, and legumes to develop effective dietary strategies for 
managing type 2 diabetes and associated hypertension and provides the rationale 
for animal and clinical studies.

Eight commercial Italian vini novelli (red wines prepared by carbonic maceration 
and supposed to be consumed within three months from their wine-making) were 
evaluated for their total antioxidant activity. The wines had an average total 
phenol content (1605.4 +/- 337.4 mg/L gallic acid equivalents) lower than that 
of wines prepared by traditional maceration and consumable after aging (2057. 3 
+/- 524.0 mg/L gallic acid equivalents). The average flavanol content (424.7 +/- 
121.3 mg/L catechin equivalents) and the total antioxidant activity (16.8 +/- 
3.8 mmol/L Trolox equivalents) of vini novelli were higher than the 
corresponding values (382.7 +/- 174.5 mg/L catechin equivalents and 12.3 +/- 3.3 
mmol/L Trolox equivalents) found for aged wines. Three couples of experimental 
wines were prepared from the same grapes by traditional or carbonic maceration. 
These wines showed a different phenolic pattern, anthocyanins being more 
abundant in vini novelli. However, the average total antioxidant activities of 
the wines were similar, suggesting that aging (and not the wine-making 
technique) is the main factor influencing the antioxidant activity of red wines.

The optimization and validation of a protocol for the quantification of six 
dietary lignans, i.e., secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, lariciresinol, 
pinoresinol, medioresinol, and syringaresinol, in food are presented. The method 
incorporates isotope dilution to ensure correct accuracy and precision, 
introducing the utilization of individual stable 13C3-labeled lignans. To 
demonstrate the potential of this new method, preliminary results of the levels 
of dietary lignans in selected foods are presented. It is concluded that the 
method fulfils the reliability criteria and can be applied to the analysis of 
the most common lignans in human food, being an essential asset to establish the 
intake of lignans in a determined population and their relation with disease 
prevention.

The influence of 2 weeks and 3 months of dark storage upon light-induced 
chlorogenic acid accumulation within tuber tissue of four potato cultivars and 
upon 5-, 4-, and 3-caffeoylquinic acid concentrations within cv. King Edward was 
determined. Storage period significantly affected (P < 0.05) the magnitude of 
the light-induced chlorogenic acid response with accumulation rates 3-4 times 
higher in tubers exposed to light after 2 weeks compared with those placed under 
light after 3 months. Comparison of chlorogenic acid concentrations in controls 
after 2 and 3 months of dark storage indicated that tuber chlorogenic 
concentrations decline during prolonged cold store at 5 degrees C. Rates of 
accumulation in response to light were cultivar-dependent with cv. Fianna the 
most light-sensitive and cv. Maris Piper relatively light-insensitive. In 
virtually all cases exposure to sodium and fluorescent light promoted higher 
rates of accumulation than did exposure to high-pressure mercury light sources. 
Chlorogenic acid values steadily increased over 15 days of illumination with, in 
the majority of cases, no indication of cessation. Light exposure increased 5-, 
4-, and 3-caffeoylquinic acid accumulation rates in cv. King Edward. 
Irrespective of storage period and light source, ratios of 
5-:4-:3-caffeoylquinic acid were ca. 85:15:0 at day 0 and 52:42:6 by day 15.

Apple fruit processing is not variety specific in India, which affect the 
overall quality of the final processed product. The present study was aimed at 
elucidation of the nutritive value, phenolic content, antioxidant activity and 
bioactive phenolic constituents of five widely used apple varieties (Royal 
Delicious, Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Red Chief and Red Gold) of western 
Himalayas. The pomace obtained from different varieties was evaluated to assess 
the fruit quality. Royal Delicious pomace had significantly high (p < 0.05) 
total dietary fibre content (42.63 ± 1.26%) together with soluble (8.25 ± 0.95%) 
and insoluble fibre (32.90 ± 0.89%), as compared to other apple varieties. The 
pomace samples were extracted with 70% aqueous methanol to obtain polyphenol 
enriched extracts. The results of Folin-Ciocalteau assay showed that 
hydroalcoholic extract of Royal Delicious pomace exhibit higher phenolic content 
as compared to other varieties and ranged between 2.19 ± 0.09 and 4.59 ± 0.47 mg 
GAE/g. Royal Delicious pomace also possess higher antioxidant capacity i.e. 
3.35 ± 0.10 mg/g, 2.71 ± 0.10 mg/g and 4.67 ± 0.03 mg/g as measured by DPPH, 
ABTS free radical scavenging assay and FRAP reducing assay, respectively. The 
higher phenolic content in Royal Delicious pomace was also confirmed by 
RP-HPLC-DAD analysis. Results of HPLC analysis revealed the presence of 
phloridzin (487.07 ± 0.04 µg/g), quercetin (241.18 ± 0.03 µg/g), quercitrin 
(178.34 ± 0.02 µg/g) and quercetin-3-glucoside (195.21 ± 0.05 µg/g) as major 
constituents. Present results indicate that Royal Delicious variety is rich in 
dietary fibre and phenolic compounds that might be used by the food sector as a 
source of bioactive health promoting constituents/dietary supplements.

Several recent articles have reported a significant antioxidant capacity of 
cereal products, determined in methanolic and ethanolic extracts. The aim of 
this work was to conduct an assessment of the antioxidant capacity of cereals 
using both chemical and in vitro digestive enzymatic extraction of antioxidants. 
Ferric reducing power (FRAP) and free radical scavenging capacity (DPPH) methods 
were used to determine the antioxidant capacity in wheat flour, bread, raw and 
boiled rice, wheat bran, and oat bran. The most efficient antioxidant extraction 
was achieved by using successively acidic methanol/water (50:50 v/v, pH 2) and 
acetone/water (70:30 v/v). The antioxidant capacity in these extracts ranged 
from 1.1 to 4.4 micromol Trolox/g dw. A significant amount of hydrolyzable 
phenolics with a high antioxidant capacity (from 5 to 108 micromol Trolox/g dw) 
was found in the residues of this aqueous-organic extraction. The antioxidant 
capacities of these nonextractable polyphenols are usually ignored in the 
literature, although they may have an antioxidant role in the gastrointestinal 
tract, especially after colonic fermentation, and may be fermentated to active 
metabolites. On the other hand, in vitro digestive enzymatic extracts obtained 
by enzymatic treatments that mimic conditions in the gastrointestinal tract 
showed that the amount of antioxidants released by the cereal matrix into the 
human intestine may be higher than the one that can be expected from 
measurements in the usual aqueous-organic extracts.

Prunes, which are industrially obtained by dehydrating fresh plums at 85-90 
degrees C for 18 h, contain higher levels of phenolic compounds than most other 
fruits. Prune phenolics have shown beneficial effects on human health. Reports 
are available in the literature on ascorbic acid, phenol composition, and 
antioxidant activity of fresh plums and prunes, but there is a lack of 
publications on the influence of drying parameters on the phenolic compounds and 
antioxidant activity. A study was carried out on two plum cultivars using two 
sets of air-drying temperatures: (i) air temperature at 85 degrees C until 50% 
of prune moisture level and then the temperature was lowered to 70 degrees C; 
(ii) air temperature at 60 degrees C. Whole fresh and dried fruits were assessed 
for phenolics (catechins, hydroxycinnamic acids, anthocyanins, and flavonols), 
ascorbic acid, and antioxidant activity (all parameters were calculated on a dry 
matter basis). Analysis of data shows that chlorogenic and neochlorogenic acid 
changes were affected by both process parameters and cultivar. Drying destroyed 
anthocyanins, and there was a significant decrease in flavonols. Ascorbic acid 
was drastically reduced in relation to process temperature. The most striking 
result was that drying at 85 degrees C doubled antioxidant activity in both 
cultivars, while contradictory results were found for 60 degrees C processed 
plums.

Puerarin (daidzein-8-C-glucoside) is the major bioactive isoflavone of kudzu 
root (the root of Pueraria lobata). Its metabolic fate, however, is not 
well-known. In this study, a sensitive and specific LC-ESI-MS/MS method for the 
determination of puerarin and its metabolites daidzein, dihydrodaidzein, and 
equol was developed for their analysis in biological samples. Two new 
metabolites of puerarin, mono- and dihydroxylated derivatives, were detected in 
the urine and feces of rats after oral administration. The persistence of 
puerarin in blood and urine as the principal metabolic form for the period of 
4-72 h after oral administration suggested that puerarin is rapidly absorbed 
from the intestine without metabolism. Its presence in organs such as the brain 
suggests that this glucoside may enter tissues by specific transport pathways. 
Study of these metabolites may provide further understanding of the health 
beneficial effects of puerarin in kudzu dietary supplements.

Proanthocyanidin rich plant extracts derived from grape seed extract (GSE), 
hawthorn and cranberry are on markets for their preventive effects against 
cardiovascular diseases and uroinfections in woman. However, the importance of 
these health beneficial effects of these botanicals remains elusive due to 
incomplete understanding of uptake, metabolism and bioavailability of 
proanthocyanidins in vivo. In the present study rats were given GSE orally (300 
mg/kg, twice a day) and blood and urine were collected over a 24 h period. 
Monomeric catechins and their methylated metabolites, and proanthocyanidins up 
to trimers were detected in blood samples treated with GSE using LC-MS/MS 
operating in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. A new tetramethylated 
metabolite of dimeric proanthocyanidin (m/z 633) in GSE-treated urine was 
tentatively identified. Using LC-MS/MS, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were 
identified in the brain conclusively. These data suggested that GSE catechins 
cross the blood brain barrier and may be responsible for the neuroprotective 
effects of GSE.

Extracts of aromatic plants of Greek origin were examined as potential sources 
of phenolic compounds. RP-HPLC with UV detection was employed for the 
identification and quantification of the phenolic antioxidants, present in 
methanolic extracts. The most abundant phenolic acids were ferulic acid (1.1-280 
mg/100 g of dry sample) and caffeic acid (1.2-60 mg/100 g of dry sample). 
(+)-Catechin and quercetin were the most abundant flavonoids. Apigenin and 
luteolin were detected in high amounts in Menta pulegium and Thymus vulgaris, 
respectively. The antioxidant capacity was determined, in dried ground plants 
and in their methanol extracts, with the Rancimat test using sunflower oil as 
substrate. Both pulverized plants and extracts showed antioxidant capacity. 
Total phenolic content in the extracts was determined spectrometrically 
according to the Folin-Ciocalteu assay and ranged from 1 to 21 mg of gallic 
acid/100 g of dry sample. Antimicrobial activity of the extracts against 
selected microbes was also conducted in this study.

Extraction, resolution, and determination of the trans-hydroxycinnamic acids 
(caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic) were performed in 82 orange juices 
derived from the most important blood and blond varieties grown in Italy. 
Soluble solids, acidity, and anthocyanins were also determined. Hydroxycinnamic 
acids were more abundant in blood orange than in blond juices. Ferulic acid was 
the major component in all cases, but the distribution of the four acids was 
typical in each variety. Discriminant analysis of the experimental results 
showed that these acids could be used as markers of blood and blond varieties. 
The statistical model was used to recognize some mixtures of blood and blond 
juices.

Several fresh orange juices, obtained from five different Citrus sinensis (L.) 
Osbeck varieties (three pigmented varieties, Moro, Sanguinello, and Tarocco, and 
two blond varieties, Valencia late and Washington navel), were subjected to 
antioxidant profile determination (including total polyphenols, flavanones, 
anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, and ascorbic acid). The antioxidant 
activity of these juices was then assessed by means of different ""in vitro"" 
tests (bleaching of the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical; 
peroxidation, induced by the water-soluble radical initiator 
2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride, on mixed 
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/linoleic acid unilamellar vesicles; scavenging 
activity against nitric oxide; total antioxidant status). All orange juices 
tested showed an evident antioxidant effect. Our findings indicate the 
following: (1) the antioxidant efficiency of orange juices may be attributed, in 
a significant part at least, to their content of total phenols, (2) while 
ascorbic acid seems to play a minor role; (3) the antioxidant activity of orange 
juices is related not only to structural features of phytochemicals contained in 
them, but also to their capability to interact with biomembranes; (4) finally, 
as to pigmented juices, their antioxidant efficiency appears to be widely 
influenced by the anthocyanin level. One could speculate that the supply of 
natural antioxidant phenols through daily consumption of orange juice might 
provide additional protection against in vivo oxidation of cellular 
biomolecules.

Quantitative analysis of anthocyanins was performed on a series of blood orange 
juices according to various spectrophotometric and HPLC methods, and the causes 
for different concentration resulting from the application of such procedures 
were investigated. Spectrophotometric methods utilizing aqueous ethanol as a 
solvent provided an anthocyanin content higher than that determined by HPLC. 
Discrepancies were ascribed to the use of impure standards and/or unsuitable 
calibration lines. The most consistent results with the HPLC findings were 
obtained by a method utilizing water as a solvent and cyanidin-3-glucoside as a 
standard. Actual concentration of anthocyanins in blood orange juice was 
remarkably lower than that currently determined by procedures used in the juice 
producing factories.

Petit Verdot grape skins by solid-phase extraction using a combination of 
reverse-phase and ion-exchanging materials. This procedure allowed us to 
separate a fraction of anthocyanin-free flavonol 3-O-glycosides that was further 
split into neutral and acidic subfractions, thus facilitating flavonol 
identification. By means of semipreparative reverse-phase high-performance 
liquid chromatography, we isolated several of these flavonol 3-O-glycosides for 
structural elucidation. The identification of different flavonol 3-O-glycosides 
was based on liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray 
ionization-tandem mass spectrometry and NMR data when available. The results 
suggest that red grape flavonol 3-O-glycosides comprise three different complete 
series, according to the nature of the sugar moiety linked to the C-3 position. 
The 3-O-glucosides were the main derivative of the six possible flavonol 
aglycones (kaempferol, quercetin, isorhamnetin, myricetin, laricitrin, and 
syringetin), whereas the 3-O-galactoside derivatives were found as minor 
compounds for all of the flavonol aglycones. The 3-O-glucuronides are the third 
kind of red grape flavonol derivatives and normally account as minor compounds 
for all of the flavonol aglycones, with the exception of quercetin 
3-O-glucuronide, which was as abundant as quercetin 3-O-glucoside. In addition, 
the presence of quercetin 3-O-(6""-rhamnosyl)-glucoside (rutin) was also detected 
as a trace compound in the skins of Petit Verdot grapes.

Stilbenes have been shown to have cancer chemopreventive activity and to protect 
lipoproteins from oxidative damage. A method is described for their direct 
determination in different types of wine using high-performance liquid 
chromatography with ultraviolet detection. In a survey of 120 commercial wines 
from Portugal and France, the highest concentrations of stilbenes were found in 
red wines. The glucosides of resveratrol were present in higher concentrations 
than the free isomers. Isolation from wine and characterization of 
trans-astringin in a large quantity are described for the first time.

A study was conducted to determine the presence of resveratrol, pterostilbene, 
and piceatannol in Vaccinium berries. Samples representing selections and 
cultivars of 10 species from Mississippi, North Carolina, Oregon, and Canada 
were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Resveratrol was found in 
Vaccinium angustifolium (lowbush blueberry), Vaccinium arboretum (sparkleberry), 
Vaccinium ashei (rabbiteye blueberry), Vaccinium corymbosum (highbush 
blueberry), Vaccinium elliottii (Elliott's blueberry), Vaccinium macrocarpon 
(cranberry), Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry), Vaccinium stamineum (deerberry), 
Vaccinium vitis-ideae var. vitis-ideae (lingonberry), and Vaccinium vitis-ideae 
var. minor (partridgeberry) at levels between 7 and 5884 ng/g dry sample. 
Lingonberry was found to have the highest content, 5884 ng/g dry sample, 
comparable to that found in grapes, 6471 ng/g dry sample. Pterostilbene was 
found in two cultivars of V. ashei and in V. stamineum at levels of 99-520 ng/g 
dry sample. Piceatannol was found in V. corymbosum and V. stamineum at levels of 
138-422 ng/g dry sample. These naturally occurring stilbenes, known to be strong 
antioxidants and to have cancer chemopreventive activities, will add to the 
purported health benefits derived from the consumption of these small fruits.

Tea is a complex mixture containing a range of compounds from simple phenolics 
to complex thearubigins, many of which have well-recognized antioxidant 
properties. This paper describes the application of high-performance liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS(n)) methods for the rapid and routine 
analysis of more than 30 phenolics in tea. Green and black tea infusions were 
injected directly onto a reversed phase HPLC column, and the phenolics eluted 
using two different mobile phase gradients, one optimized to resolve catechin 
derivatives and the other, flavonols and theaflavins. Compounds, identified on 
the basis of their retention time, absorbance spectrum, and MS fragmentation 
pattern, included (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, theaflavin and their various 
gallate derivatives, quercetin and kaempferol mono-, di-, and triglycosides, 
quinic acid esters of gallic acid and hydroxycinnamates, and the purine 
alkaloids, caffeine and theobromine.

BACKGROUND: Proanthocyanidins, the most abundant polyphenols in chocolate, are 
not depolymerized in the stomach and reach the small intestine intact, where 
they are hardly absorbed because of their high molecular weight. In vitro and in 
vivo studies using pure compounds as substrates suggest that proanthocyanidins 
and the related catechin monomers may be degraded into more bioavailable 
low-molecular-weight phenolic acids by the microflora in the colon.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the amounts of phenolic acids 
formed by the microflora and excreted in the urine of human subjects after 
consumption of polyphenol-rich chocolate.
DESIGN: After consumption of a polyphenol-free diet for 2 d and a subsequent 
overnight fast, 11 healthy subjects (7 men and 4 women) consumed 80 g chocolate 
containing 439 mg proanthocyanidins and 147 mg catechin monomers. All urine was 
collected during the 24 h before chocolate consumption and at 3, 6, 9, 24, and 
48 h after chocolate consumption. Aromatic acids were identified in urine by gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry and were quantified by HPLC-electrospray 
ionization tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Chocolate intake increased the urinary excretion of the 6 following 
phenolic acids: m-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, ferulic acid, 
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, m-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, vanillic acid, and 
m-hydroxybenzoic acid.
CONCLUSION: The antioxidant and biological effects of chocolate may be explained 
not solely by the established absorption of catechin monomers but also by the 
absorption of microbial phenolic acid metabolites.

Beers are a source of dietary flavonoids; however, there exist differences in 
composition, alcohol concentration, and beneficial activities. To characterize 
these differences, three kinds of lager beer of habitual consumption in Spain, 
dark, blond, and alcohol-free, were assayed for total phenolic content, 
antioxidant activity, superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities, and 
in vitro inhibitory effect on DNA oxidative damage. Furthermore, their 
melanoidin content and correlation with antioxidant activity were evaluated. 
Dark beer contained the highest total phenolic (489 +/- 52 mg/L) and melanoidin 
(1.49 +/- 0.02 g/L) contents with a 2-fold difference observed when compared to 
the alcohol-free beer. For the three kinds of beer, the antioxidant activity 
measured as N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride concentration was 
strongly correlated with the total polyphenol content (R(2) = 0.91102, p < 
0.005) and with the melanoidin content (R(2) = 0.7999, p < 0.05). The results 
support a positive effect of beers on the protection of DNA oxidative damage, by 
decreasing the deoxyribose degradation, DNA scission (measured by 
electrophoresis), and inhibition of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) formation. 
Furthermore, a correlation between the total melanoidin content (R(2) = 0.7309, 
p < 0.01) and inhibition of 8-OH-dG was observed.

A quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection 
method separating 16 phenolic acids was achieved. Six columns and several mobile 
phases were investigated. Resolution was achieved with a high-purity silica 
Phenomenex Luna C18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm) and a binary gradient 
consisting of CH3OH-water (with 0.1% formic acid) and flow rate set at 0.7 
ml/min. Acids were detected and quantitation performed at wavelength 
representing the lowest energy lambda(max) for individual acids. Extraction 
procedure from wine was optimized and yields ranged from 79 to 87% based on 
internal standard recovery. To confirm our quantitative results, identical 
samples were analyzed both in-house and by a collaborating laboratory. 
Correlation of two data sets generated linear regression equations that 
approached unity (0.93-0.98) and R2 values ranging from 0.990 to 0.999.

Phenolic compounds including phenolic aldehydes, acids and flavonoids are 
separated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with analysis time 
shorter than described in the literature. The use of a fluorescence detector in 
series with absorbance detector allowed increasing selectivity and sensitivity 
for the determination of catechin, vanillic acid, syringic acid, epicatechin and 
trans-resveratrol in wine samples. An optimised sample preparation method using 
liquid-liquid extraction with diethyl ether at pH 2.0 was used. The optimised 
method was applied to analyse wine samples with good results.

In this study polyphenolic compounds extracted from olive fruits of five 
registered cultivars were analyzed. A solid-liquid extraction (LSE) procedure 
with Extrelut cartridge (diatomaceous earth) using different eluents was 
developed to obtain polyphenolic compounds. HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS methods were 
applied for the quali-quantitative analysis of each fraction obtained from LSE. 
The results of this work show that the LSE procedure with diatomaceous earth 
cartridge supplies a rapid and reproducible fractioning method able to obtain a 
quantitative recovery of all compounds and to collect fractions directly 
analyzed by HPLC. A comparison among different cultivars shows significant 
quantitative differences in some polyphenols, such as verbascoside, anthocyanic 
compounds, and oleuropein derivatives.

The flavonoid composition of three phenotypes of ""Zolfino"" landraces, a typical 
bean grown in Tuscany, has been elucidated by means of HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS 
analysis. Flavonols, isoflavones, and anthocyanins have been separated and 
determined in the different samples chosen on the basis of their seed coat 
color. A flavonol that has not been previously found in Phaseolus vulgaris L. 
seeds has been characterized. The quantitative data show the presence of 
flavonols (ranging from 709 to 118 mg/kg of fresh weight), isoflavones (ranging 
from 14 to 2 mg/kg of fresh weight), and anthocyanins, in black beans only. 
These results show that this genotype could be very interesting from a 
nutritional point of view.

The levels of trans-piceid, cis-piceid, trans-resveratrol, and cis-resveratrol 
have been measured in 36 grape juices using an HPLC system with spectral 
analysis of eluting peaks. The piceid (glucosides) were the major component in 
the grape juices. In red grape juices the average concentrations were 3.38 mg/L 
for trans-piceid, 0.79 mg/L for cis-piceid, 0.50 mg/L for trans-resveratrol, and 
0.06 mg/L for cis-resveratrol. In white grape juices the levels were, on 
average, 0.18 mg/L for trans-piceid, 0.26 mg/L for cis-piceid, and 0.05 mg/L for 
trans-resveratrol, and cis-resveratrol was not detected in any sample. Levels of 
total resveratrol (trans- and cis-resveratrol and -piceid) found in red and in 
white grape juices are similar to those described in Spanish red and white 
wines. Due to their resveratrol content, as well as other phenolics, grape 
juices may have a beneficial health effect of interest to those who cannot drink 
wine.

Human urine was collected over a 24 h period after the consumption of 250 mL of 
(i) water, (ii) orange juice, and (iii) orange juice plus 150 mL of full fat 
natural yoghurt. The orange juice contained 168 micromol of 
hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside and 18 micromol of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside. GC-MS 
analysis of the urine identified nine phenolic acids, five of which, 
3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylhydracrylic acid, dihydroferulic 
acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylhydracrylic acid and 3-hydroxyhippuric acid, were 
associated with orange juice consumption indicating that they were derived from 
colonic catabolism of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside. The overall 0-24 h excretion of 
the five phenolic acids was 6.7 +/- 1.8 micromol after drinking water and this 
increased significantly (p < 0.05) to 62 +/- 18 micromol, equivalent to 37% of 
the ingested flavanones, following orange juice consumption. When the orange 
juice was ingested with yoghurt excretion fell back markedly to 9.3 +/- 4.4 
micromol. This was not due to a difference in mouth to caecum transit time, as 
measured with breath hydrogen production, though possibly there may have been a 
slowing of the bulk of the meal reaching the large intestine which may then have 
altered the catabolism of the flavanones to phenolic acids by the colonic 
microbiota.

Nine commercial brands of grapefruit juice were analyzed for their flavonoid 
content by HPLC to determine if significant brand-to-brand variance in 
grapefruit juice flavonoid content exists. Flavonoid glycosides narirutin, 
naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, didymin, and poncirin have been identified 
in all the grapefruit juices examined. The aglycone quercetin was detected in 
only two brands. All the juices were free from methoxylated flavonoid aglycones. 
There was a significant difference in the amounts of total flavonoids and 
individual flavonoids in the nine brands. The concentration of total flavonoids 
ranged between 19.44 and 84.28 mg/100 ml juice. Naringin was found to be the 
major flavonoid followed by narirutin and hesperidin. Their concentrations 
ranged from 14.56 to 63.8; 2.25 to 12.20; and 0.24 to 3.12 mg/100 ml juice, 
respectively.

Interindividual variation in metabolism of soy isoflavones and lignans: 
influence of habitual diet on equol production by the gut microflora.

The soy isoflavones, daidzein and genistein, and the lignans, matairesinol and 
secoisolariciresinol, are phytoestrogens metabolized extensively by the 
intestinal microflora. Considerable important evidence is already available that 
shows extensive interindividual variation in isoflavone metabolism, and we have 
investigated the extent of this variation in a crossover study of a 
soy-containing food low or high in isoflavones (each treatment period lasted for 
17 days, and the 2 treatment periods were separated by a 25-day washout period) 
in 24 healthy subjects [19 women and 5 men, mean age 30 yr, range 19-40, mean 
body mass index 22.5 +/- 3.5 (SD) kg/m2]. There was a 16-fold variation in total 
isoflavonoid excretion in urine after the high-isoflavone treatment period. The 
variation in urinary equol excretion was greatest (664-fold), and subjects fell 
into two groups: poor equol excretors and good equol excretors (36%). A 
significant negative correlation was found between the proportion of energy from 
fat in the habitual diet and urinary equol excretion (r = -0.55; p = 0.012). 
Good equol excretors consumed less fat as percentage of energy than poor 
excretors (26 +/- 2.3% compared with 35 +/- 1.6%, p < 0.01) and more 
carbohydrate as percentage of energy than poor excretors (55 +/- 2.9% compared 
with 47 +/- 1.7%, p < 0.05). Interindividual variation in the urinary excretion 
of O-desmethyl-angolensin (O-DMA) was also apparent (76-fold after the 
high-isoflavone treatment period), but there was no relationship between equol 
excretion and O-DMA excretion. Enterolactone was the major lignan metabolite in 
urine and plasma but showed less interindividual variation than equol and O-DMA. 
It is suggested that the dietary fat intake decreases the capacity of gut 
microbial flora to synthesize equol.

This investigation was designed to characterize phenolic metabolism of the olive 
cultivar, Hardy's Mammoth, by examining its constitutive tissues. The phenolic 
profiles of pulp, seed, stone, and new and old season leaves were monitored over 
two fruiting seasons, to investigate possible relationships between tissues and 
phenol content and to determine the impact of alternate fruit bearing. No major 
qualitative differences in phenolic composition were found between the various 
tissues; however, distinct differences between the tissues with respect to 
quantifiable phenols were established. Relationships between 
2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl (3E,4E)-4-formyl-3-(2-oxoethyl)hex-4-enoate ester, 
oleuropein, and hydroxytyrosol in pulp and leaf were identified and found to be 
related to alternate bearing. Concentrations of 5-caffeoylquinic acid in old 
season leaves differed dramatically between seasons, confirming earlier studies.

Arabinoxylans (AXs) are widely distributed in various cereal grains, such as 
wheat, corn, rye, barley, rice, and oat. The AX molecule contains a linear 
(1,4)-β-D-xylp backbone substituted by α-L-araf units and occasionally t-xylp 
and t-glcpA through α-(1,2) and/or α-(1,3) glycosidic linkages. Arabinoxylan 
shows diversified functional and bioactive properties, influenced by their 
molecular mass, branching degree, ferulic acid (FA) content, and the 
substitution position and chain length of the side chains. This Review 
summarizes the extraction methods for various cereal sources, compares their 
structural features and functional/bioactive properties, and highlights the 
established structure-function/bioactivity relationships, intending to explore 
the potential functions of AXs and their industrial applications.

Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a naturally occurring 
polyphenol with cancer chemopreventive properties in preclinical models of 
carcinogenesis, including those of colorectal cancer. Recently, a variety of 
analogues of resveratrol have been synthesised and investigated in in vitro 
assays. One analogue, 3,4,5,4'-tetramethoxystilbene (DMU 212), showed 
preferential growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic properties in transformed cells, 
when compared with their untransformed counterparts. As part of a 
chemoprevention drug development programme, the pharmacokinetic properties of 
DMU 212 were compared with those of resveratrol in the plasma, liver, kidney, 
lung, heart, brain and small intestinal and colonic mucosa of mice. DMU 212 or 
resveratrol (240 mg kg(-1)) were administered intragastrically, and drug 
concentrations were measured by HPLC. Metabolites were characterised by 
cochromatography with authentic reference compounds and were identified by mass 
spectrometry. The ratios of area of plasma or tissue concentration vs time 
curves of resveratrol over DMU 212 (AUC(res)/AUC(DMU212)) for the plasma, liver, 
small intestinal and colonic mucosa were 3.5, 5, 0.1 and 0.15, respectively. 
Thus, resveratrol afforded significantly higher levels than DMU 212 in the 
plasma and liver, while DMU 212 exhibited superior availability compared to 
resveratrol in the small intestine and colon. Resveratrol was metabolised to its 
sulphate or glucuronate conjugates, while DMU 212 underwent metabolic 
hydroxylation or single and double O-demethylation. DMU 212 and resveratrol 
inhibited the growth of human-derived colon cancer cells HCA-7 and HT-29 in 
vitro with IC(50) values of between 6 and 26 microM. In the light of the 
superior levels achieved in the gastrointestinal tract after the administration 
of DMU 212, when compared to resveratrol, the results provide a good rationale 
to evaluate DMU 212 as a colorectal cancer chemopreventive agent.

Tea is rich in polyphenols and has a variety of biological activities. In order 
to better understand the biological effects of tea constituents on human health, 
markers for their exposure and their metabolic fates are needed. Previously, we 
have characterized several catechin metabolites in the blood and urine, but more 
information on the metabolite profile of tea polyphenols is needed. In the 
present study, the human urinary metabolite profile of tea polyphenols was 
investigated using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass 
spectrometry with data-dependent acquisition. With data-dependent MS/MS analysis 
by collecting the MS2 and MS3 spectra of the most intense ions in the sample, we 
identified more than twenty metabolites of tea polyphenols from human urine 
samples. (-)-Epigallocatechin (EGC) glucuronide, methylated EGC glucuronide, 
methylated EGC sulfate, (-)-epicatechin (EC) glucruronide, EC sulfate, 
methylated EC sulfate, as well as the glucuronide and sulfate metabolites of the 
ring-fission metabolites of tea catechins, 
5-(3',4',5'-trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4), 
5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6) and 
5-(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6'), were the major human 
urinary metabolites of tea polyphenols. To our knowledge, this is the first 
report of the direct simultaneous analysis of the human urinary metabolite 
profile of tea polyphenols using single sample analysis. This method can also be 
used for thorough investigations of the metabolite profiles of many other 
dietary constituents.

(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant and most biologically 
active polyphenolic compound in tea, has been proposed to have many health 
beneficial effects. The metabolic fate of EGCG, however, is not well understood. 
In the present study, we identified a novel EGCG metabolite, 
7-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-EGCG-4''-O-beta-D-glucupyranoside, in a mouse urine 
sample using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass 
spectrometry. The structure of this metabolite was confirmed by analyzing the 
MSn (n = 1-4) spectra as well as comparing the MS/MS spectra of its product ions 
with those from EGCG and EGCG-4''-O-beta-D-glucupyranoside standards. To our 
knowledge, this is the first report of the identification of a glucoside 
metabolite of EGCG in mammals. Our results indicate that glucosidation 
represents a novel pathway in the metabolism of EGCG in mice.

The cortex of 14 French apple varieties (12 cider and 2 juice varieties), one 
English cider variety, and one dessert apple (i.e., Golden Delicious) were 
studied for their polyphenol composition. Total polyphenols were assayed by the 
Folin-Ciocalteu method, and the precise polyphenolic composition (monomeric 
catechins, proanthocyanidins, hydroxycinnamic acids, and dihydrochalcones) was 
obtained by HPLC following thiolysis. ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS analyses showed that 
chlorogenic acid and p-coumaroylquinic acid were methylated under the conditions 
of thiolysis. Depending on the variety, the global polyphenol concentration 
varied from 1 to 7 g per kilogram of fresh cortex. Cider varieties globally 
showed a higher polyphenol concentration than the dessert apple Golden 
Delicious, bitter varieties being the more concentrated. The proportion of the 
polyphenol classes varied greatly from one cultivar to another. For all 
varieties, procyanidins were always the predominant class. They were mainly 
constituted of (-)-epicatechin units with a small proportion of (+)-catechin as 
a terminal unit. The average degree of polymerization ranged between 4.2 and 7.5 
depending upon the variety with an exception for the sharp varieties Guillevic 
and Avrolles which showed significant concentrations of procyanidins with DPn of 
40 and 50, respectively.

The presence of resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) and its beta-glucoside, 
piceid (resveratrol-3-beta-D-glucopyranoside), together with their isomers in 
wine appears to be one of the beneficial factors conferring a protective effect 
against cardiovascular disease through red wine ingestion. A total of 42 red and 
white wines was collected in areas from Hokkaido to Kyushu in Japan. The wines 
were fractionated with a C18 Sep-pak cartridge, and the active principles were 
eluted with ethyl acetate. Crude trans- and cis-piceid were extracted from a 
Chinese medicine, 'Kojohkon' (Polygonum cuspidatum), and their retention times 
and UV absorption were confirmed by HPLC. trans- and cis-Resveratrol, and trans- 
and cis-piceid were analyzed in a short C18 HPLC column, and cis-resveratrol was 
quantified from the amount of cis-isomer converted from authentic 
trans-resveratrol that had been treated by UV irradiation. The content of piceid 
is shown as the resveratrol equivalent. The average content of total stilbene 
compounds was 4.37 mg/liter in red wines, while only 0.68 mg/liter in white 
wines. Red wines made from Pinot noir, Merlot, and Zweigeltrebe grapes all had a 
high resveratrol content.

Chemical composition and the effects of domestic processing and storage were 
studied in organically cultivated or wild growing berries, harvested in 
certificated area in Serbia. The total phenolics content in fresh berries ranged 
from 380 to 1660 mg GAE/100 g. The phenolic content decreased during the 
processing to jams, and storage in almost all samples, except in black currant. 
Among fresh berries, the highest amount of total anthocyanins was found in 
bilberry (0.61 +/- 0.03 %). Processing and storage caused decrease in 
anthocyanin content. The most ubiquitous anthocyanin aglycone was found to be 
cyanidin. Ellagic acid was detected in fresh and frozen black raspberries and 
related jams, and its content increases during thermal processing to jam. Among 
fresh berries, bilberry showed the strongest DPPH radical scavenging activity 
with an IC(50) value of 0.82 mg/ml. However, frozen as well as processed berries 
in our study still showed comparable high values of radical scavenging activity. 
After 9 months of storage all investigated jams were microbiologicaly correct. 
Regardless of the losses in the amount of total phenolics, total anthocyanins 
and radical scavenging activity, frozen berries and related jams are still 
excellent sources of nutritional substances with antioxidant potential.

Due to the lack of one universally applicable and commonly used reference 
method, sample preparation in isoflavone (IF) analysis has been performed by 
many different methods which renders comparison and quality assessment of 
published IF contents in foodstuffs difficult. In the present work, the impact 
of different experimental parameters on the IF concentrations determined in 
soybeans, tofu, soy drink and textured vegetable protein by different extraction 
and hydrolysis methods was assessed and IF contents obtained by optimized 
orthogonal methods were compared. Chromatographic analysis was performed by 
HPLC-UV-ESI-MS. If possible sources of error - which are also pointed out in 
this work - are avoided, IF contents obtained by extraction, acid-, base- and 
enzymatic hydrolysis are similar. However, these sample preparation methods 
differ in the amount of time, standard compounds and instruments required, 
ruggedness, and in their applicability to analysis of complex composite samples 
containing soy as minor ingredient. Enzymatic hydrolysis with Helix pomatia 
juice after extraction by sonication with first 50, then 80% aqueous 
acetonitrile in the presence of zinc sulfate heptahydrate and after adjustment 
to </=10% organic solvent turned out to be the method of choice if only aglucone 
equivalent contents are required. The advantages of this method are short 
chromatographic run times, smallest danger of coelution, lowest achievable 
limits of quantitation and therefore best suitability for work-up of complex 
composite samples and that only aglucone standards are needed for quantitation.

Pinotage red wines were found to contain a reaction product of malvidin 
3-glucoside and caffeic acid, the so-called pinotin A. A total of 50 Pinotage 
wines from the vintages 1996-2002 were analyzed for the content of pinotin A, 
malvidin 3-glucoside, caffeic acid, and caftaric acid. Statistical analyses were 
performed to reveal variations in the content of these compounds and to 
determine the factors that influence pinotin A formation during wine aging. An 
exponential increase of the concentration of this aging product was observed 
with prolonged storage time. The most rapid synthesis of pinotin A was observed 
in 2.5-4 year old wines, although at this age malvidin 3-glucoside is already 
degraded to a large extent. This phenomenon is explained by the increased ratio 
of caffeic acid/malvidin 3-glucoside, which strongly favors the formation of 
pinotin A and makes side reactions less likely. Pinotin A formation proceeds as 
long as a certain level of malvidin 3-glucoside is maintained in the wines. In 
wines >5-6 years old degradation or polymerization of pinotin A finally exceeds 
the rate of its de novo synthesis.

Pistachio shells split naturally prior to maturity leading to their unique 
crack-shell form. Within 24 h of harvest, hull-trapped moisture may cause shell 
staining. The illegal process of bleaching has been used to restore a desirable 
white color to pistachio shells. It is not known whether bleaching adversely 
affects phytochemical levels in pistachios. Therefore, we identified for the 
first time multiple pistachio skin phenolics as quercetin (14.9 microg/g), 
luteolin (10.0 microg/g), eriodictyol (10.2 microg/g), rutin (1.6 microg/g), 
naringenin (1.2 microg/g), apigenin (0.2 microg/g), and the anthocyanins, 
cyanidin-3-galactoside (696 microg/g) and cyanidin-3-glucoside (209 microg/g). 
We investigated the effects of bleaching (0.1-50% hydrogen peroxide) on phenolic 
levels and antioxidative capacities in raw and roasted nuts. Because of their 
flavylium cation structures, anthocyanins were the most sensitive to bleaching. 
Bleaching decreased total anthocyanin levels [mug/g of skins (% hydrogen 
peroxide)]: 905 and 549 (0%); 653 and 145 (0.1%); 111 and 18.4 (5%); 6.1 and 3.2 
(25%); 0 and 0 (50%) for raw and roasted nuts, respectively. Bleaching also 
reduced antioxidative capacity [microM/g of Trolox (% hydrogen peroxide)]: 945 
and 725 (0%); 940 and 472 (0.1%); 930 and 455 (5%); 433 and 370 (25%); 189 and 
173 (50%), for raw and roasted nuts, respectively. Raw nuts preserved phenolic 
levels and antioxidant capacity better than roasted nuts, suggesting 
contributing effects of other substances and/or matrix effects that are 
destroyed by the roasting process. The destruction of bioactive phenolics in 
pistachio skins may negatively impact the potential health benefits arising from 
pistachio consumption.

The effects of Trametes hirsuta laccase and Pentopan Mono BG xylanase and their 
combination on oat, wheat, and mixed oat-wheat doughs and the corresponding 
breads were investigated. Laccase treatment decreased the content of 
water-extractable arabinoxylan (WEAX) in oat dough due to oxidative 
cross-linking of feruloylated arabinoxylans. Laccase treatment also increased 
the proportion of water-soluble polysaccharides (WSNSP) apparently due to the 
beta-glucanase side activity present in the laccase preparation. As a result of 
the laccase treatment, the firmness of fresh oat bread was increased. Xylanase 
treatment doubled the content of WEAX in oat dough and slightly increased the 
amount of WSNSP. Increased stiffness of the dough and firmness of the fresh 
bread were detected, probably because of the increased WEAX content, which 
decreased the amount of water available for beta-glucan. The combination of 
laccase and xylanase produced slight hydrolysis of beta-glucan by the 
beta-glucanase side activity of laccase and enhanced the availability of AX for 
xylanase with concomitant reduction of the amount and molar mass of WSNSP. 
Subsequently, the volume of oat bread was increased. Laccase treatment tightened 
wheat dough, probably due to cross-linking of WEAX to higher molecular weight. 
In oat-wheat dough, laccase slightly increased the proportion of WSNSP between 
medium to low molecular weight and increased the specific volume of the bread. 
Xylanase increased the contents of WEAX and WSNSP between medium to low 
molecular weight in oat-wheat dough, which increased the softness of the dough, 
as well as the specific volume and softness of the bread. The results thus 
indicate that a combination of laccase and xylanase was beneficial for the 
textures of both oat and oat-wheat breads.

Vidalia onion varieties Nirvana, DPS 1032, Yellow 2025, King-Midas, and SBO 133 
grown at Vidalia, Georgia, were analyzed for flavonoid content. A 
high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with photodiode array 
detection was used for quantification. Compounds were analyzed as aglycons after 
acid hydrolysis with 1.2 M HCl. Identification of each compound was based on 
comparison of its retention time and UV spectra with those of pure commercial 
standards. Three major flavonoids, kaempferol, myricetin, and quercetin, were 
identified and quantified. Quercetin was the major flavonoid (7.70-46.32 mg/100 
g fresh weight, FW) present in all varieties, followed by myricetin (2.77-4.13 
mg/100 g FW). Minor quantities of kaempferol (1.10-1.98 mg/100 g FW) were also 
detected. The total polyphenols and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity 
(TEAC) ranged from 73.33 to 180.84 mg/100 g FW and 0.92-1.56 microM TEAC/g FW, 
respectively. A positive but weaker correlation was obtained for total 
polyphenols versus antioxidant capacity. Nevertheless, a stronger correlation 
(r(2) = 0.34) was obtained between flavonoid content versus antioxidant 
capacity. The data indicate that Vidalia onions are a rich source of quercetin, 
and they also contain myricetin and kaempferol.

Blueberries and blackberries grown at various locations in Georgia were 
collected and analyzed for flavonoids, total anthocyanins, total polyphenols, 
and Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). Each sample was analyzed for 
phenolic acids (gallic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, 
and ellagic acid) and flavonoids (catechin, epicatechin, myricetin, quercetin, 
and kaempferol). A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with 
photodiode array detection was used for analysis. Compounds were analyzed as 
aglycons after acid hydrolysis with 1.2 M HCl. Identification of each compound 
was based on retention time and UV spectra by comparison with pure commercial 
standards. Phenolic acids ranged from 0.19 to 258.90 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW), 
and flavonoids ranged from 2.50 to 387.48 mg/100 g FW. Total polyphenols ranged 
from 261.95 to 929.62 mg/100 g FW, and total anthocyanins ranged from 12.70 to 
197.34 mg/100 g FW. TEAC values varied from 8.11 to a maximum of 38.29 microM/g 
FW. A linear relationship was observed between TEAC values and total polyphenols 
or total anthocyanins. The data indicate that blueberries and blackberries are 
rich sources of antioxidants.

Hydrophilic phenols are the most abundant natural antioxidants of virgin olive 
oil (VOO), in which tocopherols and carotenes are also present. The prevalent 
classes of hydrophilic phenols found in VOO are phenyl alcohols, phenolic acids, 
secoiridoids such as the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid 
linked to (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol or (p-hydroxypheny1)ethanol 
(3,4-DHPEA-EDA or p-HPEA-EDA) and an isomer of the oleuropein aglycon 
(3,4-DHPEA-EA), lignans such as (+)-1-acetoxypinoresinol and (+)-pinoresinol, 
and flavonoids. A new method for the analysis of VOO hydrophilic phenols by 
direct injection in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with the use 
of a fluorescence detector (FLD) has been proposed and compared with the 
traditional liquid-liquid extraction technique followed by the HPLC analysis 
utilizing a diode array detector (DAD) and a FLD. Results show that the most 
important classes of phenolic compounds occurring in VOO can be evaluated using 
HPLC direct injection. The efficiency of the new method, as compared to the 
liquid-liquid extraction, was higher to quantify phenyl alcohols, lignans, and 
3,4-DHPEA-EA and lower for the evaluation of 3,4-DHPEA-EDA and p-HPEA-EDA.

An off-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) and ultra-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and 
validated for determining procyanidins, catechin, epicatechin, dimer, and trimer 
in plasma samples. In the validation procedure of the analytical method, 
linearity, precision, accuracy, detection limits (LODs), quantification limits 
(LOQs), and the matrix effect were studied. Recoveries of the procyanidins were 
higher than 84%, except for the trimer, which was 65%. The LODs and LOQs were 
lower than 0.003 and 0.01 microM, respectively, for all the procyanidins 
studied, except for the trimers, which were 0.8 and 0.98 microM, respectively. 
This methodology was then applied for the analysis of rat plasma obtained 2h 
after ingestion of grape seed phenolic extract. Monomers (catechin and 
epicatechin), dimer and trimer in their native form were detected and quantified 
in plasma samples, and their concentration ranged from 0.85 to 8.55 microM. 
Moreover, several metabolites, such as catechin and epicatechin glucuronide, 
catechin and epicatechin methyl glucuronide, and catechin and epicatechin 
methyl-sulphate were identified. These conjugated forms were quantified, in 
reference to the respective unconjugated form, showing concentrations between 
0.06 and 23.90 microM.

BACKGROUND: The nonsteroidal estrogen equol occurs as diastereoisomers, 
S-(-)equol and R-(+)equol, both of which have significant biological actions. 
S-(-)equol, the naturally occurring enantiomer produced by 20-30% of adults 
consuming soy foods, has selective affinity for estrogen receptor-beta, whereas 
both enantiomers modulate androgen action. Little is known about the 
pharmacokinetics of the diastereoisomers, despite current interest in developing 
equol as a nutraceutical or pharmaceutical agent.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare the pharmacokinetics of S-(-)equol and 
R-(+)equol by using [13C] stable-isotope-labeled tracers to facilitate the 
optimization of clinical studies aimed at evaluating the potential of these 
diastereoisomers in the prevention and treatment of estrogen- and 
androgen-dependent conditions.
DESIGN: A randomized, crossover, open-label study in 12 healthy adults (6 men 
and 6 women) compared the plasma and urinary pharmacokinetics of orally 
administered enantiomeric pure forms of S-(-)[2-13C]equol, R-(+)[2-13C]equol, 
and the racemic mixture. Plasma and urinary [13C]R-equol and [13C]S-equol 
concentrations were measured by tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Plasma [13C]equol concentration appearance and disappearance curves 
showed that both enantiomers were rapidly absorbed, attained high circulating 
concentrations, and had a similar terminal elimination half-life of 7-8 h. The 
systemic bioavailability and fractional absorption of R-(+)[2-13C]equol were 
higher than those of S-(-)[2-13C]equol or the racemate. The pharmacokinetics of 
racemic (+/-)[2-13C]equol were different from those of the individual 
enantiomers: slower absorption, lower peak plasma concentrations, and lower 
systemic bioavailability.
CONCLUSIONS: The high bioavailability of both diastereoisomers contrasts with 
previous findings for the soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein, both of which 
have relatively poor bioavailability, and suggests that low doses of equol taken 
twice daily may be sufficient to achieve biological effects.

The soy isoflavone metabolite, S-(-)equol, has selective affinity for estrogen 
receptor (ER)beta and also antagonizes in vivo the action of 
dihydrotestosterone. It is therefore of interest as a potential new therapeutic 
agent in hormone-dependent conditions and is under development as a 
nutraceutical. Our objective in this study was to define the pharmacokinetics of 
natural S-(-)equol after administration of SE5-OH, a newly developed S-(-)equol 
supplement made by incubation of the equol-producing bacterium Lactococcus 
garvieae with soy germ isoflavones. In a single-center, open-label, randomized, 
2-period crossover design study, the pharmacokinetics of S-(-)equol administered 
as single-bolus oral doses of 10 and 30 mg in the form of SE5-OH tablets was 
determined in 12 healthy postmenopausal women. S-(-)equol was measured in plasma 
and urine collected at timed intervals over a 48-h period postdosing using 
tandem MS. Equol-producer status was also determined after a soymilk challenge 
conducted after the pharmacokinetic sampling was complete. S-(-)equol was 
rapidly absorbed after oral administration and attained high plasma 
concentrations, with a plasma elimination half-life of 8 h. The maximum plasma 
concentration/dose, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 
to infinity/dose, and the fraction of dose excreted in urine (%f(e,u)) were 
similar for the 2 doses, indicating a dose-proportional response in total 
S-(-)equol pharmacokinetics. The systemic bioavailability of S-(-)equol was very 
high, as the %f(e,u) was 82% for both doses, which is greater than published 
data for the soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein. Three participants were 
determined to be equol-producers, representing a 25% frequency, and 
equol-producer status had no effect on natural S-(-)equol pharmacokinetics.

Total equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and phenolic content of 26 common 
spice extracts from 12 botanical families were investigated. Qualitative and 
quantitative analyses of major phenolics in the spice extracts were 
systematically conducted by reversed-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography (RP-HPLC). Many spices contained high levels of phenolics and 
demonstrated high antioxidant capacity. Wide variation in TEAC values 
(0.55-168.7 mmol/100 g) and total phenolic content (0.04-14.38 g of gallic acid 
equivalent/100 g) was observed. A highly positive linear relationship (R2= 0.95) 
obtained between TEAC values and total phenolic content showed that phenolic 
compounds in the tested spices contributed significantly to their antioxidant 
capacity. Major types of phenolic constituents identified in the spice extracts 
were phenolic acids, phenolic diterpenes, flavonoids, and volatile oils (e.g., 
aromatic compounds). Rosmarinic acid was the dominant phenolic compound in the 
six spices of the family Labiatae. Phenolic volatile oils were the principal 
active ingredients in most spices. The spices and related families with the 
highest antioxidant capacity were screened, e.g., clove in the Myrtaceae, 
cinnamon in the Lauraceae, oregano in the Labiatae, etc., representing potential 
sources of potent natural antioxidants for commercial exploitation. This study 
provides direct comparative data on antioxidant capacity and total and 
individual phenolics contents of the 26 spice extracts.

The beneficial effects of red, yellow and white onion extracts have been 
assessed by antioxidant activity and antimutagenic activity. And the effects 
compared to BHT and ascorbic acid. Total phenolic compounds and flavonoids in 
onion extracts were determined. Yellow onion extract had more organic acid and 
free sugar than those detected in the white and red onion extract. The 
scavenging activity of DPPH radical and H(2)O(2) were increased depending on the 
concentration. The antioxidant activities using beta-carotene-linoleate system 
and reducing power were increased but the effect was small to that of BHT and 
ascorbic acid. After digested, extracts showed antimutagenic activities, and it 
seems that they inhibit the mutagenicity for digesting. This study demonstrated 
that the antimutagenicities and antioxidant properties of ethyl acetate extract 
against mutagens were related to their phenols and flavonoids, which are heat 
stable and losses digestive juices are relatively low.

Flavanones, the main polyphenols of citrus fruits, are thought to contribute to 
the protective effects of these fruits against cardiovascular diseases and 
cancer. The metabolism of naringin (naringenin 7-O-neohesperidoside) is studied 
here in healthy (sham-operated, ShO) and tumor-bearing (TuB) rats. The tumor was 
induced by implanting Yoshida's sarcoma in hindlimb. Both groups received for 7 
days a semi-synthetic diet containing 0.5% naringin in per feeding conditions. 
Flavanones were analyzed in plasma, liver, kidney and urine by tandem mass 
spectrometry. Naringenin conjugates (essentially glucuronides) accounted for up 
to 98% of the total flavanones in plasma. Low amounts of hesperetin (4'-O-methyl 
naringénine) and isosakuranetin (3'-hydroxy-4'-O-methylnaringenin) were also 
detected in all biological samples and accounted for 2% of the total flavanones 
in plasma. They were largely present as aglycones. The in vivo hydroxylation of 
flavanones is described here for the first time. Total concentrations of 
naringenin metabolites reached 17.3+/-2.7 microM in plasma 6 hours after the 
beginning of the meal in healthy rats and only 10.6+/-1.3 microM in TuB rats. 
The nature of metabolites was similar in both healthy and TuB rats and in 
plasma, tissues and urine. The lower concentration of flavanones in the TuB rats 
suggests that disease and more particularly cancer, may affect the 
bioavailability of flavonoids.

The phenolic compounds present in 17 samples of Portuguese commercial and three 
homemade quince jams were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, to determine 
their authenticity. Two different extraction methods were needed for the 
complete definition of quince jams profiles, one of them including an Amberlite 
XAD-2 cleaning step. These analyses showed that all the samples presented a 
similar profile composed of at least eight identified phenolic compounds, 
several unidentified characteristic procyanidin polymers, and sodium benzoate as 
preservative of quince jams. Several samples also contained arbutin, suggesting 
that these quince jam samples were fraudulently adulterated with pear puree.

Isoflavones and carotenoids in four experimental genotypes and Hutcheson 
cultivar soybeans were evaluated as a function of processing treatments and 
maturity. Total isoflavone and carotenoid contents were affected by genotypes 
and maturity stages (p < 0.0001). Total isoflavones ranged from 472 microg/g (in 
NTCPR93-40) to 2280 microg/g (in Hutcheson). Lutein contents ranged from 895 (in 
NTCPR93-286) to 2119 (in Honey Brown), and beta-carotene ranged from 291 (in 
Hutcheson) to 491 (in NICPR92-40) microg/100 g. Mean total isoflavone retention 
percentages in immature Hutcheson soybeans were 46% (boiling), 53% (freezing), 
and 40% (freeze-drying). Mean retentions of lutein and beta-carotene, 
respectively, were 92 and 73% in frozen, 62 and 62% in boiled, and 34 and 27% in 
freeze-dried soybeans. Boiling caused a substantial increase in daidzin, 
genistin, and genistein. The results show that post-harvest changes in total 
isoflavones and carotenoids in soybeans are influenced by processing methods, 
but genotype has an effect on isoflavone and carotenoid profiles during seed 
development.

This study evaluates and compares the milled fractions of buckwheat (Fagopyrum 
esculentum) for their physical, functional properties and nutritional 
composition. Four samples of buckwheat from the Indian Himalayan regions were 
roller-milled into five fractions: fine-flour, grits, bran, hull-1 and hull-2. 
The water activity of the grains lies between 0.77 and 0.83%. The L* values were 
in the range of 22.77 ± 0.36 to 24.46 ± 0.37 for the four buckwheat grains. 
Water binding capacity and oil binding capacity showed an increasing pattern of 
fine flour > grits > bran > hull-1 whereas the swelling power exhibited a 
reverse trend. The maximum (20.03 ± 1.82%) and the minimum (3.19 ± 0.12%) 
protein content were found in bran and fine-flour fractions respectively. 
Highest starch content was detected in fine-flour (73.19 ± 2.00-76.32 ± 2.36%) 
and lowest in hull-1 (11.02 ± 2.00-17.54 ± 2.36%) with no significant (p > 0.05) 
difference between different samples. Fine-flour exhibited the lowest phytates 
content (0.59 ± 0.00-0.62 ± 0.01%) whereas bran has highest tannins 
(0.06 ± 0.03-1.39 ± 0.02). Milled fractions with specific functional properties 
and nutrients composition have potential for different food applications.

Apples are an important source of flavonoids in the human diet. The effect of 
processing apples into juice on polyphenolic antioxidant content and activity is 
described. Raw juice obtained from Jonagold apples by pulping and straight 
pressing or after pulp enzyming had an antioxidant activity that was only 10 and 
3%, respectively, of the activity of the fresh apples. The levels of flavonoids 
and chlorogenic acid in the juice were reduced to between 50% (chlorogenic acid) 
and 3% (catechins). Most of the antioxidants were retained in the pomace rather 
than being transferred into the juice. Apparently, most of the antioxidant 
compounds are absorbed to the solid matter of the pomace. In apple juice, 45% of 
the total measured antioxidant activity could be ascribed to the analyzed 
antioxidants. For three apple cultivars tested (Elstar, Golden Delicious, and 
Jonagold), the processing methods had similar effects. The results indicate that 
processing can have a major impact on the bioactivity of products.

The difference in urinary excretion of mammalian and plant lignans in rats was 
determined after oral administration of equivalent doses (25 mg/kg of body 
weight) of 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR), lariciresinol (LAR), matairesinol (MR), 
and secoisolariciresinol (SECO). Twenty-four hours-urine samples were collected 
after a single dose and after administration of one dose/day for 10 days. Eight 
lignans were analysed in urine extracts using a high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method showing good sensitivity and 
repeatability. After a single dose of HMR, LAR, MR, and SECO, the main 
metabolites were 7-hydroxyenterolactone (HENL), cyclolariciresinol (CLAR), 
enterolactone (ENL), and enterodiol (END), respectively, but after 10-day 
exposure ENL was the main metabolite of all the tested lignans, showing a 
considerably higher excretion than after a single dose. Metabolic 
transformations of plant lignans into each other could also be observed.

Twenty-four plant lignans were analyzed by high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in bran extracts of 16 cereal species, 
in four nut species, and in two oilseed species (sesame seeds and linseeds). 
Eighteen of these were lignans previously unidentified in these species, and of 
these, 16 were identified in the analyzed samples. Four different extraction 
methods were applied as follows: alkaline extraction, mild acid extraction, a 
combination of alkaline and mild acid extraction, or accelerated solvent 
extraction. The extraction method was of great importance for the lignan yield. 
7-Hydroxymatairesinol, which has not previously been detected in cereals because 
of destructive extraction methods, was the dominant lignan in wheat, triticale, 
oat, barley, millet, corn bran, and amaranth whole grain. Syringaresinol was the 
other dominant cereal lignan. Wheat and rye bran had the highest lignan content 
of all cereals; however, linseeds and sesame seeds were by far the most 
lignan-rich of the studied species.

In seed extracts of five oilseed species, in bran extracts of three cereal 
species, and in seed and/or whole berry extracts of 10 berry species, the 
concentrations of a large number of lignans and the enantiomeric composition of 
selected lignans were determined. In the case of sesame and hemp seeds, the 
lignan content and composition of the whole seeds was compared to that of the 
hulled seeds. The results showed that cloudberry seeds are the third most 
lignan-rich food source after linseeds and whole sesame seeds, and that most of 
the berry species analysed were more lignan-rich than the cereal brans. The 
lignans are concentrated in the hull of the oilseeds and in the seeds of the 
berries. In most samples, secoisolarici-, pino-, medio-, and syringaresinol were 
present as a mixture of two enantiomers.

Fig fruit has been a typical component in the health-promoting Mediterranean 
diet for millennia. To study the potential health-promoting constituents of fig 
fruits, six commercial fig varieties differing in color (black, red, yellow, and 
green) were analyzed for total polyphenols, total flavonoids, antioxidant 
capacity, and amount and profile of anthocyanins. Using reversed-phase liquid 
chromatography (RP-LC), various concentrations of anthocyanins but a similar 
profile was found in all varieties studied. Hydrolysis revealed cyanidin as the 
major aglycon. Proton and carbon NMR confirmed cyanidin-3-O-rhamnoglucoside 
(cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside; C3R) as the main anthocyanin in all fruits. Color 
appearance of fig extract correlated well with total polyphenols, flavonoids, 
anthocyanins, and antioxidant capacity. Extracts of darker varieties showed 
higher contents of phytochemicals compared to lighter colored varieties. Fruit 
skins contributed most of the above phytochemicals and antioxidant activity 
compared to the fruit pulp. Antioxidant capacity correlated well with the 
amounts of polyphenols and anthocyanins (R2 = 0.985 and 0.992, respectively). In 
the dark-colored Mission and the red Brown-Turkey varieties, the anthocyanin 
fraction contributed 36 and 28% of the total antioxidant capacity, respectively. 
C3R contributed 92% of the total antioxidant capacity of the anthocyanin 
fraction. Fruits of the Mission variety contained the highest levels of 
polyphenols, flavonoids, and anthocyanins and exhibited the highest antioxidant 
capacity.

A phytochemical study was undertaken on tronchuda cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. 
var. costata DC) cultivated under conventional and organic practices and 
collected at different times. Six organic acids (aconitic, citric, ascorbic, 
malic, shikimic, and fumaric acids) were identified and quantified by HPLC-UV. 
Qualitative and quantitative differences were noted between internal and 
external leaves. Analysis of the phenolics of the internal leaves was achieved 
by HPLC-DAD, and the phenolic profile obtained was revealed to be distinct from 
that of the external leaves. By this means were identified and quantified 11 
compounds: 3-p-coumaroylquinic acid, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, 
kaempferol 3-O-(caffeoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 
3-O-(sinapoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 
3-O-(feruloyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside, two 
isomeric forms of 1,2-disinapoylgentiobiose, 1-sinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose, 
1,2,2'-trisinapoylgentiobiose, and 1,2'-disinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose. In 
general, internal leaves exhibited more constant chemical profiles.

The aim of the study was to characterize physical and chemical composition of 
four highbush blueberry cultivars (""Bluecrop,"" ""Late Blue,"" ""Chandler,"" and 
""Elliot""). The assessment of ultrasound influence at the osmotic dehydration 
step and during hybrid drying on mass transfer and the nutritional quality of 
all cultivars was also done. The experiment consisted of two stages: (1) 
initial: optimization of osmotic dehydration procedure, (2) the main experiment 
including all stages of dried blueberry production (pretreatment, osmotic 
dehydration chosen in the initial stage, and drying). In both parts, the effect 
of US and cultivar were considered as factors influencing the most important 
quality indices. The osmotic dehydration, in the mixture (1:1) of sucrose 
solution and apple juice concentrate (65°Bx) at a fruit to syrup ratio 1:4, was 
carried out in water bath fitted with ultrasonic transducers (25 kHz, 27.8 W/L) 
at a temperature of 40°C for 150 min. After pretreatment osmo-dehydrated fruits 
were subjected to drying in hybrid (microwave-ultrasound-convective) drum dryer. 
Regardless of the cultivar US had positive influence on mass transfer (up to 22% 
for intact and 12% for mechanically scratched) at the osmotic dehydration stage. 
Unfavorably, its action tend to decrease phenolic compounds content. The final 
effect, however, was strongly influenced by the choice of cultivar. With regard 
to ultrasound applied at the drying step, no explicit effect, either on the 
drying process efficiency or on final product quality, was identified. In the 
same processing conditions ""Elliot"" turned out to be the most promising to 
produce ready-to-eat fruit snacks in terms of the final product stability and 
bioactives content.
PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Hybrid drying was proposed as a novel approach in 
blueberry drying. Ultrasound application as a part of abovementioned drying 
technique is considered an efficient way of shortening drying time due to mass 
transfer intensification and the interaction with dehydrated tissue. However, no 
experiments studying the impact of ultrasound on various cultivars within one 
species were carried out. This study contributes to the understanding that 
appropriate cultivar selection in the production of ready-to-eat dried blueberry 
fruit is just as important as process parameters in obtaining an attractive 
product with a high level of natural bioactive compounds.

Seed coat, cotyledon and embryonic axe fractions of chickpea (Cicer arietinum 
L.) and horse gram (Macrotyloma uniflorum L.) were evaluated for their phenolic 
composition in relation to antioxidant activities. Compositional analysis of 
phenolics by HPLC revealed a wide variation in the distribution of flavonols, 
isoflavones, phenolic acids and anthocyanins among these legume fractions. 
Although cotyledon fractions of both the legumes were rich in phenolic acids, 
the concentrations of flavonols such as quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin 
were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than the embryonic axe and seed coat 
fractions. Ferulic, chlorogenic, caffeic, and vanillic acids were the principal 
phenolic acids found in cotyledons. The most striking difference was the 
predominance of isoflavones in embryonic axe fractions. Although the isoflavone 
genistein was detected in all three fractions of chickpea, it was present 
exclusively in the embryonic axe fraction of horse gram at levels greater than 
daidzein. Furthermore, cyanidin, petunidin, and delphinidin were detected in 
seed coat and embryonic axe fractions but not in cotyledons. In addition to 
these three anthocyanins, malvidin was found only in the horse gram seed coat 
fraction. Seed coat fractions having higher total phenolic indexes were found to 
be the most active 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavengers 
(IC(50) 13.1 to 18.6 microg/mL) followed by embryonic axe and cotyledon 
fractions (IC(50) 15.4 to 34.2 microg/mL). Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) 
scavenging capacities of cotyledons, embryonic axe and seed coats were 12.3, 
34.1 and 78.6% for chickpea and 15.1, 56.8 and 92.6% for horse gram, 
respectively. The multiple antioxidant activity of horse gram and chickpea 
fractions was evident, as they also possessed reducing power and ferrous 
ion-chelating potency. These results contributed to the understanding of the 
relationships between major phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities of 
legumes and provided useful information for effective utilization of 
legume-milled fractions as functional food ingredients for promoting health.

Ten healthy human subjects consumed 500 mL of Choladi green tea, containing 648 
mumol of flavan-3-ols after which plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h 
period and analysed by HPLC-MS. Plasma contained a total of ten metabolites, in 
the form of O-methylated, sulphated and glucuronide conjugates of (epi)catechin 
and (epi)gallocatechin, with 29-126 nM peak plasma concentrations (C(max)) 
occurring 1.6-2.3 h after ingestion, indicative of absorption in the small 
intestine. Plasma also contained unmetabolised (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate 
and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate with respective C(max) values of 55 and 25 nM. 
Urine excreted 0-24 h after consumption of green tea contained 15 metabolites of 
(epi)catechin and (epi)gallocatechin, but (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate and 
(-)-epicatechin-3-gallate were not detected. Overall flavan-3-ol metabolite 
excretion was equivalent to 8.1% of intake, however, urinary (epi)gallocatechin 
metabolites corresponded to 11.4% of (epi)gallocatechin ingestion while 
(epi)catechin metabolites were detected in amounts equivalent to 28.5% of 
(epi)catechin intake. These findings imply that (epi)catechins are highly 
bioavailable, being absorbed and excreted to a much greater extent than most 
other flavonoids. It is also evident that flavan-3-ol metabolites are rapidly 
turned over in the circulatory system and as a consequence C(max) values are not 
an accurate quantitative indicator of the extent to which absorption occurs.

Human subjects drank coffee containing 412 mumol of chlorogenic acids, and 
plasma and urine were collected 0 to 24 h after ingestion and were analyzed by 
high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Within 1 h, some of 
the components in the coffee reached nanomole peak plasma concentrations 
(C(max)), whereas chlorogenic acid metabolites, including caffeic 
acid-3-O-sulfate and ferulic acid-4-O-sulfate and sulfates of 3- and 
4-caffeoylquinic acid lactones, had higher C(max) values. The short time to 
reach C(max) (T(max)) indicates absorption of these compounds in the small 
intestine. In contrast, dihydroferulic acid, its 4-O-sulfate, and dihydrocaffeic 
acid-3-O-sulfate exhibited much higher C(max) values (145-385 nM) with T(max) 
values in excess of 4 h, indicating absorption in the large intestine and the 
probable involvement of catabolism by colonic bacteria. These three compounds, 
along with ferulic acid-4-O-sulfate and dihydroferulic acid-4-O-glucuronide, 
were also major components to be excreted in urine (8.4-37.1 mumol) after coffee 
intake. Feruloylglycine, which is not detected in plasma, was also a major 
urinary component (20.7 mumol excreted). Other compounds, not accumulating in 
plasma but excreted in smaller quantities, included the 3-O-sulfate and 
3-O-glucuronide of isoferulic acid, dihydro(iso)ferulic acid-3-O-glucuronide, 
and dihydrocaffeic acid-3-O-glucuronide. Overall, the 119.9 mumol excretion of 
the chlorogenic acid metabolites corresponded to 29.1% of intake, indicating 
that as well as being subject to extensive metabolism, chlorogenic acids in 
coffee are well absorbed. Pathways for the formation of the various metabolites 
within the body are proposed. Urinary dihydrocaffeic acid-3-O-sulfate and 
feruloylglycine are potentially very sensitive biomarkers for the consumption of 
relatively small amounts of coffee.

Sensory-guided decomposition of roasted cocoa nibs revealed that, besides 
theobromine and caffeine, a series of bitter-tasting 2,5-diketopiperazines and 
flavan-3-ols were the key inducers of the bitter taste as well as the astringent 
mouthfeel imparted upon consumption of roasted cocoa. In addition, a number of 
polyphenol glycopyranosides as well as a series of N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino 
acids have been identified as key astringent compounds of roasted cocoa. In the 
present investigation, a total of 84 putative taste compounds were quantified in 
roasted cocoa beans and then rated for the taste contribution on the basis of 
dose-over-threshold (DoT) factors to bridge the gap between pure structural 
chemistry and human taste perception. To verify these quantitative results, an 
aqueous taste reconstitute was prepared by blending aqueous solutions of the 
individual taste compounds in their ""natural"" concentrations. Sensory analyses 
revealed that the taste profile of this artificial cocktail was very close to 
the taste profile of an aqueous suspension of roasted cocoa nibs. To further 
narrow down the number of key taste compounds, finally, taste omission 
experiments and human dose/response functions were performed, demonstrating that 
the bitter-tasting alkaloids theobromine and caffeine, seven bitter-tasting 
diketopiperazines, seven bitter- and astringent-tasting flavan-3-ols, six 
puckering astringent N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino acids, four velvety astringent 
flavonol glycosides, gamma-aminobutyric acid, beta-aminoisobutyric acid, and six 
organic acids are the key organoleptics of the roasted cocoa nibs.

To investigate probable health benefits of flavonoids and stilbenes in red wine 
a new reversed-phase (RP) high-performance liquid-chromatographic (HPLC) method 
with enhanced separation efficiency and improved selectivity, sensitivity, and 
speed has been established for determination of the flavonoids quercetin, 
myricetin and kaempferol and the stilbenes cis- and trans-resveratrol, in a 
single run . UV-absorbance, fluorescence (FLD), and mass-spectrometric (MS) 
detection were also evaluated. UV-absorbance detection at 320 nm for stilbenes 
and 377 nm for flavonoids enables their determination up to the nanogram range 
with a linearity of R2>0.9999 (linear range 50 ng mL(-1)-50 microg mL(-1)). 
Calculated values of average recoveries were between 95 and 105% for all 
analytes. For resveratrol, fluorescence detection was highly selective and twice 
as sensitive as UV detection, and linearity was satisfactory (R2>0.9996; linear 
range see UV detection). For the detection of the hydrophilic glycosidic 
compounds piceid and rutin, which are coeluted with other hydrophilic 
ingredients, the validated RP HPLC system was coupled to a quadrupole ion-trap 
mass-spectrometer (MS) via an electrospray interface (ESI) with 25% ammonia 
solution as sheath liquid. MS detection was, highly linear (R2>0.9878; linear 
range 50 ng mL(-1)-50 microg mL(-1)) for all investigated analytes and the 
limits of detection were in the low nanogram range. Compared with UV detection 
MS detection resulted in a 200% increase in signal intensity for myricetin and 
400% increases for quercetin and kaempferol, but equal signal intensity for 
resveratrol. Calculated values of average recoveries were 102% for myricetin and 
79% for piceid. Collision induced dissociation (CID) was also used to obtain 
characteristic fragmentation fingerprints to facilitate qualitative and 
quantitative analysis even in complex matrices. Finally, this hyphenated 
HPLC-ESI-MS method was highly suitable and an essential improvement compared 
with UV- and fluorescence detection.

The flavonol contents of 20 varieties of tomato fruit were investigated in 
relation to variety, size, season, and country of origin. Ten commonly consumed 
tomato-based food products were also assessed. Free and conjugated flavonols 
were identified and quantified using reversed-phase HPLC. Ninety-eight percent 
of flavonols detected in tomatoes were found to occur in the skin. Tomatoes 
contained, primarily as conjugates, quercetin and kaempferol. The main quercetin 
conjugate was identified as rutin (quercetin 3-rhamnosylglucoside) by LC-MS. The 
total flavonol content of the different varieties of tomato that were analyzed 
varied from 1.3 to 22.2 microgram/g of fresh weight (fw). Smaller cherry tomato 
fruits originating from warm sunny climates, such as Spain and Israel, were 
found to contain the highest concentration of flavonols. Among the tomato-based 
products investigated, tomato juice and tomato purée were rich in flavonols, 
containing 14-16 microgram/mL and 70 microgram/g fw, respectively. In contrast 
to fresh tomatoes, most tomato-based products contained significant amounts of 
free flavonols.

Eleven subjects completed a clinical trial to determine the safety/tolerability 
of freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB) and to measure, in plasma and urine, 
specific anthocyanins-cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-sambubioside, 
cyanidin-3-rutinoside, and cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside, as well as ellagic 
acid. Subjects were fed 45 g of freeze-dried BRB daily for 7 days. Blood samples 
were collected predose on days 1 and 7 and at 10 time points postdose. Urine was 
collected for 12 hours predose on days 1 and 7 and at three 4-hour intervals 
postdose. Maximum concentrations of anthocyanins and ellagic acid in plasma 
occurred at 1 to 2 hours, and maximum quantities in urine appeared from 0 to 4 
hours. Overall, less than 1% of these compounds were absorbed and excreted in 
urine. None of the pharmacokinetic parameters changed significantly between days 
1 and 7. In conclusion, 45 g of freeze-dried BRB daily are well tolerated and 
result in quantifiable anthocyanins and ellagic acid in plasma and urine.

An extract from flaxseed containing oligomeric structures of the phenolic 
glucosides secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), p-coumaric acid glucoside and 
ferulic acid glucoside was fractionated into three oligomeric fractions (F50, 
F60 and F70) by reversed phase liquid chromatography and further subfractionated 
by Sepharose CL-6B. The F50 fraction, which had the highest proportion of 
hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides, was also fractionated on Sephadex LH-20 
according to hydrophobicity and size. The different separations resulted in 
complex profiles of UV-absorbing molecules. HPLC analyses indicated that 
reversed-phase chromatography separated the oligomers according to composition 
of the phenolic glucosides, while the subfractionation revealed that other 
structural features of the oligomers were also important. Using the DPPH 
radical, SDG and oligomeric fractions showed similar hydrogen-donating abilities 
comparable to ferulic acid but higher than α-tocopherol, which suggests that SDG 
was the only active antioxidant.

Three phenolic glucosides, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, p-coumaric acid 
glucoside and ferulic acid glucoside, were analyzed in commercial breads 
containing flaxseed. The total phenolic glucoside content ranged from 15 to 
157mg/100g dry bread. Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside was the dominating 
phenolic glucoside with an average relative content of 62%, followed by 
p-coumaric acid glucoside (20%) and ferulic acid glucoside (18%). Strong 
positive correlations between the phenolic glucosides were found, indicating no 
major effect of raw material or bread-making process on the relative content of 
the phenolic glucosides in flaxseed.

BACKGROUND: Hepatic diseases are one of the chief reasons for worldwide 
morbidity and mortality. The increased incidence in Asian countries is driving 
researchers to explore preventive ways from nature. It is more practical to go 
with healthy routine edibles like vegetable oils to avoid environmental and 
chemical hepatic injuries. With the use of thermally oxidized oils 
overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with overwhelmed cellular 
antioxidants defense system results in oxidative stress, the known cause of 
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Little 
is investigated about the effect of daily used oxidized cooking oils on hepatic 
function changes with oxidative stress especially in the animal model that 
mimics the human situation.
METHODS: In this study, healthy adult male rabbits of local strain were divided 
into 4 groups (n = 12). First, two sets of rabbits were treated with 1 and 
2 ml/kg/day of repeatedly heated mix vegetable oils (RHMVO) respectively. The 
third set of rabbits was given 1 ml/kg/day of single time heated mix vegetable 
oils (STHMVO) and the fourth set of rabbits served as controls and fed with 
normal rabbit diet to for 16 weeks. Serum liver function markers including 
total-protein, albumin, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum 
glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) along with 
the activity of hepatic antioxidant-enzymes including superoxide dismutase 
(SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and malondialdehyde (MDA) 
for lipid peroxidation were compared among different groups of rabbits. 
Histopathological examination was performed for all four groups.
RESULTS: Significantly (p < 0.05) elevated hepatic enzymes and MDA levels, with 
lower total protein, serum albumin, GPx, SOD and CAT levels were found in high 
and low doses RHMVO treated groups, in comparison to control. In the STHMVO 
group, all mentioned markers were insignificantly changed. Accumulation of liver 
fat in low and high dose oil-treated groups was further confirmed under the 
microscopic examination of liver tissues, presented significant fat accumulation 
in liver tissues, in addition, 40-60% increased oxidative stress compared to 
control, in a dose-dependent manner.
CONCLUSIONS: These results conclude that consumption of thermally oxidized mix 
vegetable oils for longer duration can impair the liver function and destroy its 
histological structure significantly through fat accumulation and oxidative 
stress both in high as well as low doses.

BACKGROUND: Consumer demand for products rich in phytochemicals is increasing as 
a result of greater awareness of their potential health benefits. However, 
processed products are stored for long-term and the phytochemicals are 
susceptible to degradation during storage. The objective of this study was to 
assess the storage effects on phytochemicals in thermally processed blueberries. 
Thermally processed canned berries and juice/puree were analysed for 
phytochemicals during their long-term storage.
RESULTS: The phytochemical retention of thermally processed blueberries during 
storage was not influenced by production system (conventional versus organic). 
During 13 months of storage, total anthocyanins, total phenolics and total 
antioxidant activity in canned blueberry solids decreased by up to 86, 69 and 
52% respectively. In canned blueberry syrup, total anthocyanins and total 
antioxidant activity decreased by up to 68 and 15% respectively, while total 
phenolic content increased by up to 117%. Similar trends in phytochemical 
content were observed in juice/puree stored for 4 months. The extent of changes 
in phytochemicals of thermally processed blueberries during storage was 
significantly influenced by blanching.
CONCLUSION: Long-term storage of thermally processed blueberries had varying 
degrees of influence on degradation of total anthocyanins, total phenolics and 
total antioxidant activity. Blanching before thermal processing helped to 
preserve the phytochemicals during storage of blueberries.

Anthocyanins are present in human diet due to their wide occurrence in fruits 
and beverages. They possess antioxidant activities and could be involved in 
several health effects. The aim of this study was to investigate anthocyanin 
metabolism and distribution in the digestive area organs (stomach, jejunum and 
liver) and kidney, as well as a target tissue (brain) in rats fed with a 
blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.) anthocyanin-enriched diet for 15 days. 
Identification and quantification of anthocyanin metabolites was carried out by 
HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC-DAD, respectively. The stomach exhibited only native 
blackberry anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-pentose), while 
in other organs (jejunum, liver, and kidney) native and methylated anthocyanins 
as well as conjugated anthocyanidins (cyanidin and peonidin monoglucuronides) 
were identified. Proportions of anthocyanin derivatives differed according to 
the organ considered, with the liver presenting the highest proportion of 
methylated forms. Jejunum and plasma also contained aglycone forms. In the 
brain, total anthocyanin content (blackberry anthocyanins and peonidin 
3-O-glucoside) reached 0.25 +/- 0.05 nmol/g of tissue (n = 6). The urinary 
excretion of total anthocyanins was low (0.19 +/- 0.02% of the ingested amount). 
Thus, organs of the digestive area indicated a metabolic pathway of anthocyanins 
with enzymatic conversions (methylation and/or glucurono-conjugation). Moreover, 
following consumption of an anthocyanin-rich diet, anthocyanins enter the brain.

Physicochemical analysis of processed strained product was performed on 10 
carrot genotypes grown in Texas (TX) and Georgia (GA). Carrots from GA 
experienced hail damage during growth, resulting in damage to their tops. 
Measurements included pH, moisture, soluble phenolics, total carotenoids, 
sugars, organic acids, and isocoumarin (6-MM). Sensory analysis was conducted 
using a trained panel to evaluate relationships between chemical and sensory 
attributes of the genotypes and in carrots spiked with increasing levels of 
6-MM. Preharvest stress conditions in GA carrots seemed to elicit a phytoalexic 
response, producing compounds that impacted the perception of bitter and sour 
flavors. Spiking 6-MM into strained carrots demonstrated the role bitter 
compounds have in lowering sweetness scores while increasing the perception of 
sour flavor. Screening fresh carrots for the phytoalexin 6-MM has the potential 
to significantly improve the sensory quality of processed products.

This investigation evaluated the content and profile of flavanoid and phenolic 
acid compounds present in nine Vaccinium species that included domestic 
blueberry cultivars and sample collections from undomesticated colonies. The 
study was focused in two areas of inquiry. The first involved extracting and 
analyzing the berries for total phenolics (TPH), total anthocyanins (ACY), and 
the antioxidant capacity. Vaccinium species differ in their polyphenolic 
content, and these high TPH and ACY levels are correlated to their antioxidant 
capacity. Second, berry extracts were analyzed by high-performance liquid 
chromatography equipped with photodiode array and mass spectrometric detectors 
to determine the content and profile of selected bioactive compounds. The 
flavanoid analytes of interest included the anthocyanidins, flavan-3-ols, and 
flavonol aglycons, as well as specific phenolic acid components. This 
semicomprehensive analysis begins to characterize the phytochemical profiles and 
illustrates the differences in the content of polyphenolic compounds present 
within these Vaccinium species.

Phytoestrogens may play a role in hormone-related diseases such as cancer, but 
epidemiological and clinical data are conflicting in part due to inadequate 
databases used in intake estimation. A database of nine phytoestrogens in foods 
relevant to Western diets was developed to more accurately estimate intakes. 
Foods (N = 121) available in Ontario, Canada were prepared as commonly consumed 
and analyzed for isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, glycitein, formononetin), 
lignans (secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, pinoresinol, lariciresinol), and 
coumestan (coumestrol) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. Data 
were presented on an as is (wet) basis per 100 g and per serving. Food groups 
with decreasing levels of total phytoestrogens per 100 g are nuts and oilseeds, 
soy products, cereals and breads, legumes, meat products, and other processed 
foods that may contain soy, vegetables, fruits, alcoholic, and nonalcoholic 
beverages. Soy products contain the highest amounts of isoflavone, followed by 
legumes, meat products and other processed foods, cereals and breads, nuts and 
oilseeds, vegetables, alcoholic beverages, fruits, and nonalcoholic beverages. 
Decreasing amounts of lignans are found in nuts and oilseeds, cereals and 
breads, legumes, fruits, vegetables, soy products, processed foods, alcoholic, 
and nonalcoholic beverages. The richest sources of specific phytoestrogens, 
including coumestrol, were identified. The database will improve phytoestrogen 
intake estimation in future epidemiological and clinical studies particularly in 
Western populations.

Anthocyanins are the most abundant phenolic compounds, widely distributed in 
fruits and vegetables, and exhibit potent antioxidant capacity. Humans ingest a 
significant amount of anthocyanins in the daily diet. The objective of the 
current study was to examine human absorption and metabolism of black raspberry 
anthocyanins when administered at high doses (2.69 +/- 0.085 g/day). Ten healthy 
men consumed 45 g of freeze-dried black raspberries daily for 1 week. Urine 
samples were collected over a 12 h period in 4 h intervals at day 1 and day 7. 
Urinary anthocyanins were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography 
coupled to a photodiode array detector and a tandem mass spectrometer using 
precursor ion and product ion analyses. Anthocyanins were excreted in intact 
forms and metabolized into methylated derivatives in human urine. The urinary 
excretion of anthocyanins reached a maximum concentration (1091.8 +/- 1081.3

compared to the anthocyanin distribution in black raspberries, urinary cyanidin 
3-xylosylrutinoside was detected at a higher concentration than that of 
cyanidin-3-rutinoside.

This study reports tannin contents of various tea (19), beer (6) and wine (6) 
samples, produced or sold in Turkey under different brand names. Determinations 
were carried out by employing a previously reported UV-vis spectrophotometric 
method. The standard addition procedure was also compared to the direct 
determination procedure and found to be more reliable. The tannin contents of 
hot water extracts of tea, tea bag and herbal tea samples ranged between 
6.20-8.33, 8.03-6.59 and 2.76-6.54 percent (w/w) respectively. Tannin contents 
of beer and wine samples determined without extraction were found ranging 
between 66.36-77.26 and 67.18-107.62 micrograms/mL respectively. Iron contents 
of analysed wine samples were also found ranging between 0.36 and 10.33 ppm by 
AAS and no relation is found between tannin and iron contents.

The phenolic profile of strawberry fruits (Fragaria x ananassa Duch., Rosaceae) 
was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array 
detection. A peak displaying retention time and UV spectral data identical to 
those of phloridzin (phloretin 2'-O-beta-d-glucoside), a dihydrochalcone 
glucoside so far considered characteristic of apples, was monitored. For further 
characterization, crude extracts of strawberries were purified on polyamide, and 
the target compound was isolated by preparative and analytical HPLC. Structure 
elucidation was performed on the basis of APCI- and ESI-MS in the negative ion 
mode as well as by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy using authentic phloridzin for 
comparison. The d-configuration of the sugar moiety was established by HPLC 
analysis of the corresponding acyclic 
1-deoxy-1-(N-acetyl-alpha-methylbenzylamino)alditol acetate. Apart from its 
chemotaxonomic relevance, this first report on the occurrence of phloridzin in 
strawberries is of particular interest for the authenticity control of 
strawberry products such as juices, jams, and fruit preparations since 
phloridzin has so far been used for the detection of fraudulent admixtures.

The phenolic compounds of 25 peach, nectarine, and plum cultivars were studied 
and quantified by HPLC-DAD-ESIMS. Hydroxycinnamates, procyanidins, flavonols, 
and anthocyanins were detected and quantified. White and yellow flesh nectarines 
and peaches, and yellow and red plums, were analyzed at two different maturity 
stages with consideration of both peel and flesh tissues. HPLC-MS analyses 
allowed the identification of procyanidin dimers of the B- and A-types, as well 
as the presence of procyanidin trimers in plums. As a general rule, the peel 
tissues contained higher amounts of phenolics, and anthocyanins and flavonols 
were almost exclusively located in this tissue. No clear differences in the 
phenolic content of nectarines and peaches were detected or between white flesh 
and yellow flesh cultivars. There was no clear trend in phenolic content with 
ripening of the different cultivars. Some cultivars, however, had a very high 
phenolic content. For example, the white flesh nectarine cultivar Brite Pearl 
(350-460 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 430-550 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) and 
the yellow flesh cv. Red Jim (180-190 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 210-330 mg/kg 
procyanidins in flesh), contained 10 times more phenolics than cultivars such as 
Fire Pearl (38-50 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 23-30 mg/kg procyanidins in 
flesh). Among white flesh peaches, cultivars Snow King (300-320 mg/kg 
hydroxycinnamates and 660-695 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) and Snow Giant 
(125-130 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 520-540 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) showed 
the highest content. The plum cultivars Black Beaut and Angeleno were especially 
rich in phenolics.

Cocoa is a food rich in polyphenols, mainly the flavonoid procyanidins and 
flavan-3-ols. The improvement of the cardiovascular function in humans upon 
cocoa consumption has been specifically linked to the presence of flavan-3-ol 
derived metabolites in plasma, especially epicatechin glucuronide. In this 
context, a flavonoid-enriched cocoa-derived product could potentially exert 
stronger health benefits. The aim of the present study was to obtain a cocoa 
powder with a higher flavonoid content (mainly enriched in monomer compounds) 
and assess its flavonoid bioavailability in humans. For this purpose, an 
unfermented, nonroasted, and blanch-treated cocoa powder (A) was obtained. The 
powder contained four times more procyanidins than a conventional (B) cocoa 
powder. Powder A contained eight times more epicatechin and procyanidin B2 than 
powder B. Cocoa milk drinks were prepared with powder A (MDA) and B (MDB). The 
bioavailability of flavonoids in both drinks was assessed in a crossover 
intervention with healthy volunteers. The content of epicatechin glucuronide, 
the main metabolite detected in plasma, was five-fold higher upon consumption of 
MDA as compared with MDB. The urinary excretion of metabolites, mainly methyl 
epicatechin sulfate, was higher upon MDA consumption as compared with MDB, 
ranging from two- to 12-fold higher depending on the metabolite. These results, 
together with previous reports regarding the cardiovascular benefits linked to 
the presence of procyanidin metabolites in plasma, suggest that further clinical 
trials to validate the health benefits of a flavonoid-enriched cocoa powder are 
warranted.

Biostimulants help plants cope with environmental stresses and improve vegetable 
yield and quality. This study was conducted to determine the protein hydrolysate 
(PH) effect of three different durations (weekly applications: three, six, or 
nine times plus an untreated control) in factorial combination with four soil 
electrical conductivities (EC: 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, or 6.0 mS·cm-1) on yield, fruit 
quality, and elemental composition of tomato 'miniplum' grown in a greenhouse. 
Fruit yield was best affected, during the summer, by six and nine biostimulant 
applications at EC 3.0 mS·cm-1, and in the same season, the six treatments led 
to the highest fruit number with no difference compared to nine applications; 
during the winter, the three and six treatments improved the mentioned variables 
at each EC level. Fruits' dry residue and Brixo were positively affected by 
biostimulation both in summer and winter. In summer, the 6.0 mS·cm-1 EC led to 
the highest dry residue and Brixo values, though the latter did not show any 
significant difference compared to 4.5 mS·cm-1; in winter, the best results 
corresponded to 4.5 and 6.0 mS·cm-1. A higher beneficial effect of PH on fruit 
antioxidant status, i.e., lycopene, polyphenols, ascorbic acid levels, and 
lipophilic (LAA) and hydrophilic (HAA) activity, was recorded in winter compared 
with summer. Positive correlations between polyphenols and LAA, as well as 
ascorbic acid content and HAA were found for all EC and PH treatments. Most of 
the mineral elements tested demonstrated concentration stability, whereas the 
highest EC decreased P, Mg, Cu, and Se accumulation. The opposite effect was 
shown by PH application on Se and Mn levels, with P tending to increase. The 
concentrations of Fe, Zn, and Cu were the lowest under the longest duration of 
PH supply. These results further confirm the essential role of plant 
biostimulation in enhancing tomato yield and quality, with a particular focus on 
the treatment duration.

Consumption of flavonoid-rich foods and beverages is thought to reduce the risk 
of cardiovascular diseases. Whereas the biological activities of flavonoids have 
been characterized in vitro, there are no clear experimental data demonstrating 
that chronic dietary intake and intestinal absorption of flavonoids actually 
protects the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury. We tested whether 
long-term consumption of specific flavonoids (anthocyanins) included in normal 
food could render the heart of rats more resistant to myocardial infarction. 
Maize kernels that differed specifically in their accumulation of anthocyanins 
were used to prepare rodent food in which anthocyanins were either present or 
absent. Male Wistar rats were fed the anthocyanin-rich (ACN-rich) or the 
anthocyanin-free (ACN-free) diet for a period of 8 wk. Anthocyanins were 
significantly absorbed and detected in the blood and urine of only rats fed the 
ACN-rich diet. In Langendorff preparations, the hearts of rats fed the ACN-rich 
diet were more resistant to regional ischemia and reperfusion insult. Moreover, 
on an in vivo model of coronary occlusion and reperfusion, infarct size was 
reduced in rats that ate the ACN-rich diet than in those that consumed the 
ACN-free diet (P < 0.01). Cardioprotection was associated with increased 
myocardial glutathione levels, suggesting that dietary anthocyanins might 
modulate cardiac antioxidant defenses. Our findings suggest important potential 
health benefits of foods rich in anthocyanins and emphasize the need to develop 
anthocyanin-rich functional foods with protective activities for promoting human 
health.

Rats were fed a grape seed extract (GSE) containing (+)-catechin, 
(-)-epicatechin and dimers, trimers, tetramers and polymeric procyanidins. 
Liver, kidney, brain and gastrointestinal (GI) tract together with plasma, urine 
and faeces were collected over a 24 h period and their flavan-3-ol content was 
analysed by HPLC with tandem mass spectrometry and diode array detection. Small 
amounts of the GSE flavan-3-ols moved out of the stomach and into the 
duodenum/jejunum, and to a greater extent the ileum 1 h after ingestion, and 
into the caecum after 2 h with relatively small amounts being detected in the 
colon after 3 h. The GI tract contained the parent GSE flavan-3-ols and 
procyanidins with only trace amounts of metabolites and there were no 
indications that proanthocyanidins were depolymerised in the GI tract releasing 
monomeric flavan-3-ols. Plasma contained exclusively catechin glucuronides and 
methylated glucuronide metabolites which were also detected in the liver and 
kidneys. These metabolites were also present in urine together with sulphated 
metabolites and low amounts of the procyanidin dimers B1, B2, B3 and B4 as well 
as the trimer C2 and an unknown GSE trimer. The amounts of (+)-catechin and 
(-)-epicatechin metabolites excreted in urine relative to the quantity of the 
monomers ingested were 27 and 36 %, respectively, after 24 h. This is similar to 
the levels of urinary excretion reported to occur by other investigators after 
feeding (-)-epicatechin to rats and provides further, albeit indirect, evidence 
that the procyanidin oligomers in the GSE were not depolymerised to monomers to 
any extent after ingestion. No convincing analytical data were obtained for the 
presence of flavan-3-ol metabolites in the brain.

Polyphenolic compounds of apple may play an important role in physiologic 
functions related to human health. Different polyphenolics may have varied 
biological activities including antioxidant activity. The objective of this 
study was to investigate the profiles of polyphenolic compounds in different 
apple varieties and different parts of an apple. The total and individual 
polyphenolics differed significantly among the eight apple cultivars grown in 
Ontario, and the peels had higher concentrations than the flesh. Among the 
tested cultivars, Red Delicious and Northern Spy had the highest concentrations 
and Empire the lowest. Five major polyphenolic groups with a total of 16 
identified individual compounds were found, among which the dihydroxycinnamic 
acid esters, phloretin glycosides, and flavan-3-ols were found in both flesh and 
peel, whereas quercetin glycosides were almost exclusively found in the peel. 
Cyanidin 3-galactoside was unique to and found only in red apple peels. In both 
apple peel and flesh, the predominant group of polyphenolics was the 
procyanidins, followed by quercetin glycosides in the peel and hydroxycinnamic 
acid esters in the flesh. 3-Hydroxyphloretin 2'-xyloglucoside was newly 
identified in apple. The results obtained in this study will further the 
understanding of the polyphenolic composition of apples and their roles in 
health-promoting physiological functions.

Hydroxytyrosol is quantitatively and qualitatively the principal phenolic 
antioxidant in olive oil. Recently it was shown that hydroxytyrosol and five 
metabolites were excreted in urine when hydroxytyrosol was dosed intravenously 
or orally in an olive oil solution to rats. The conclusive identification of 
three metabolites of hydroxytyrosol by MS/MS as a monosulfate conjugate, a 
3-O-glucuronide conjugate, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid 
(homovanillic acid) has been established in this investigation. The structural 
configurations of the glucuronide conjugate and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic 
acid were confirmed by (1)H NMR. The radical scavenging potencies of 
homovanillic acid, homovanillic alcohol, hydroxytyrosol, and the metabolites 
were examined with the radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. These studies 
showed them to be potent antioxidants with SC(50) values of 14.8 and 11.4 microM 
for homovanillic acid and homovanillic alcohol, respectively. The 
3-O-glucuronide conjugate was more potent than hydroxytyrosol, with an SC(50) of 
2.3 in comparison to 11.0 microM, and the monosulfate conjugate was almost 
devoid of radical scavenging activity.

The effect of fresh-cutting and subsequent cold storage on phenolic compounds 
from five long-term-stored potato cultivars (Agria, Cara, Liseta, Monalisa, and 
Spunta) was studied. Fresh-cutting induced the biosynthesis of three flavonols, 
which were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESIMS as quercetin 3-rutinoside, quercetin 
3-diglucoside, and quercetin 3-glucosylrutinoside. The flavonols were detected 
after a lag period of 3 days of cold storage. The content ranged from 6 to 14 
mg/100 g of fresh weight depending on the cultivar after 6 days of storage. 
Chlorogenic acid as the main caffeic acid derivative and the amino acids 
tyrosine and tryptophan were also quantified. The effect of cold storage under 
light or in dark was studied with new-season-harvested Monalisa potatoes. The 
flavonol induction was higher in fresh-cut potatoes stored under light than in 
the dark. However, caffeic acid derivatives were not affected. Domestic cooking 
such as boiling, microwaving, and frying provoked a partial loss of the 
flavonols, which were retained in the range of 4-16 mg per serving (213 g). 
Steam-cooking resulted in the highest retention of caffeic acid derivatives and 
aromatic amino acids compared with the other cooking methods studied. This means 
that due to the large amount of potatoes consumed in the Western diet, fresh-cut 
potatoes can be a significant source of health-promoting phenolics.

BACKGROUND: As set out in Sustainable Development Goal 3.3, the target date for 
ending the HIV epidemic as a public health threat is 2030. Therefore, there is a 
crucial need to evaluate current epidemiological trends and monitor global 
progress towards HIV incidence and mortality reduction goals. In this analysis, 
we assess the current burden of HIV in 204 countries and territories and 
forecast HIV incidence, prevalence, and mortality up to 2050 to allow countries 
to plan for a sustained response with an increasing number of people living with 
HIV globally.
METHODS: We used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) 2021 analytical framework to compute age-sex-specific HIV mortality, 
incidence, and prevalence estimates for 204 countries and territories 
(1990-2021). We aimed to analyse all available data sources, including data on 
the provision of HIV programmes reported to UNAIDS, published literature on 
mortality among people on antiretroviral therapy (ART) identified by a 
systematic review, household surveys, sentinel surveillance antenatal care 
clinic data, vital registration data, and country-level case report data. We 
calibrated a mechanistic simulation of HIV infection and natural history to 
available data to estimate HIV burden from 1990 to 2021 and generated forecasts 
to 2050 through projection of all simulation inputs into the future. Historical 
outcomes (1990-2021) were simulated at the 1000-draw level to support 
propagation of uncertainty and reporting of uncertainty intervals (UIs). Our 
approach to forecasting utilised the transmission rate as the basis for 
projection, along with new rate-of-change projections of ART coverage. 
Additionally, we introduced two new metrics to our reporting: prevalence of 
unsuppressed viraemia (PUV), which represents the proportion of the population 
without a suppressed level of HIV (viral load <1000 copies per mL), and period 
lifetime probability of HIV acquisition, which quantifies the hypothetical 
probability of acquiring HIV for a synthetic cohort, a simulated population that 
is aged from birth to death through the set of age-specific incidence rates of a 
given time period.
FINDINGS: Global new HIV infections decreased by 21·9% (95% UI 13·1-28·8) 
between 2010 and 2021, from 2·11 million (2·02-2·25) in 2010 to 1·65 million 
(1·48-1·82) in 2021. HIV-related deaths decreased by 39·7% (33·7-44·5), from 
1·19 million (1·07-1·37) in 2010 to 718 000 (669 000-785 000) in 2021. The 
largest declines in both HIV incidence and mortality were in sub-Saharan Africa 
and south Asia. However, super-regions including central Europe, eastern Europe, 
and central Asia, and north Africa and the Middle East experienced increasing 
HIV incidence and mortality rates. The number of people living with HIV reached 
40·0 million (38·0-42·4) in 2021, an increase from 29·5 million (28·1-31·0) in 
2010. The lifetime probability of HIV acquisition remains highest in the 
sub-Saharan Africa super-region, where it declined from its 1995 peak of 21·8% 
(20·1-24·2) to 8·7% (7·5-10·7) in 2021. Four of the seven GBD super-regions had 
a lifetime probability of less than 1% in 2021. In 2021, sub-Saharan Africa had 
the highest PUV of 999·9 (857·4-1154·2) per 100 000 population, but this was a 
64·5% (58·8-69·4) reduction in PUV from 2003 to 2021. In the same period, PUV 
increased in central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia by 116·1% 
(8·0-218·2). Our forecasts predict a continued global decline in HIV incidence 
and mortality, with the number of people living with HIV peaking at 44·4 million 
(40·7-49·8) by 2039, followed by a gradual decrease. In 2025, we projected 1·43 
million (1·29-1·59) new HIV infections and 615 000 (567 000-680 000) HIV-related 
deaths, suggesting that the interim 2025 targets for reducing these figures are 
unlikely to be achieved. Furthermore, our forecasted results indicate that few 
countries will meet the 2030 target for reducing HIV incidence and HIV-related 
deaths by 90% from 2010 levels.
INTERPRETATION: Our forecasts indicate that continuation of current levels of 
HIV control are not likely to attain ambitious incidence and mortality reduction 
targets by 2030, and more than 40 million people globally will continue to 
require lifelong ART for decades into the future. The global community will need 
to show sustained and substantive efforts to make the progress needed to reach 
and sustain the end of AIDS as a public threat.

BACKGROUND: Nutritional biomarkers are alternatives to traditional dietary 
assessment tools. We sought to develop a method for nutritional analysis of 
resveratrol, a phenolic compound with purported health-promoting properties, and 
to determine all resveratrol metabolites.
METHODS: We obtained LDL and urine samples from 11 healthy male volunteers who 
had consumed 250 mL of Merlot red wine. We measured resveratrol and its 
metabolites with 96-well solid-phase extraction plates coupled with HPLC-tandem 
mass spectrometry. Hexestrol was used as the internal standard. Gradient 
chromatography in multiple reaction monitoring mode was performed on a Luna 
C(18) column, maintained at 40 degrees C; m/z transitions were as follows: 
resveratrol, 227/185; resveratrol glucosides, 389/227; resveratrol glucuronides, 
403/227; resveratrol sulfates, 307/227; taxifolin, 303/285; and hexestrol, 
269/134.
RESULTS: Standard calibration curves were linear at 4.4-3289.5 nmol/L. Residual 
analyses were 100% (3.2) for trans-resveratrol and 100% (11.1) for trans-piceid. 
In both matrices, imprecision (CV) was <10.8% at all concentrations. Detection 
limits for resveratrol were 0.2 nmol/L (LDL), 0.3 nmol/L (synthetic urine), and 
4.0 nmol/L (blank urine). Resveratrol and metabolites were checked for 
stability, and no degradation was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry method enabled us to identify 
resveratrol sulfates in human LDL and to characterize the complete profile of 
resveratrol metabolism in human LDL and urine. This method provides an accurate 
index of exposure to resveratrol and its metabolites, which can be used as 
nutritional biomarkers for evaluating the biological effects of moderate wine 
intake on human health.

When discovered in the 50's, isoflavones were suspected to provoke infertility 
syndrome in sheep grazing on clover. Many others effects of these phytoestrogens 
have been documented afterwards. To determine the distribution of isoflavone 
metabolites in ewe tissues and look for a link with their physiological impact, 
two ewes were fed a diet containing 50% red clover silage (variety Pawera) for 
one month with a daily intake of 157.6 mg/kg bw of total isoflavones. Only 
aglycones were fed due to the fermentation stage of the silage. At the 
sacrifice, isoflavone metabolites and aglycones were analyzed in blood, liver, 
kidney, lung, heart, muscle, ovaries, uterus, mammary glands, suprarenal glands, 
thymus, aorta, thyroid, pituitary gland, cerebellum, olfactory lobes, and brain 
hemispheres using HPLC-Coularray and LC-MS-MS. The major compounds recovered in 
tissues were equol and daidzein, present as glucuronides. Kidney concentrations 
were 10-fold higher than in other tissues. Penetration in brain was very 
limited. Reproductive organs contained higher concentrations of isoflavones than 
heart, muscle, or thymus. Distribution of isoflavones in ewe tissues is unequal 
and may reflect specific impact in some target tissues.

Proanthocyanidins, flavonoids exhibiting cardiovascular protection, constitute a 
major fraction of the flavonoid ingested in the human diet. Although they are 
poorly absorbed, they are metabolized by the intestinal microbiota into various 
phenolic acids. An analytical method, based on an optimized 96-well plate 
solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure and liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS) for the analysis of 19 phenolic microbial 
metabolites and monomeric and dimeric flavanols in urine samples, was developed 
and validated. Human urine samples were obtained before and after ingestion of 
an acute consumption of 40 g of soluble cocoa powder and rat urines before and 
after the prolonged administration (2 weeks) of different diets composed of 
natural cocoa powder. The mean recovery of analytes using the new SPE-LC-MS/MS 
method ranged from 87% to 109%. Accuracy ranged from 87.5% to 113.8%, and 
precision met acceptance criteria (<15% relative standard deviation). 
Procyanidin B2 has been detected and quantified for the first time in human and 
rat urine after cocoa consumption. Changes in human and rat urinary levels of 
microbial phenolic acids and flavanols were in the range of 0.001-59.43 nmol/mg 
creatinine and of 0.004-181.56 nmol/mg creatinine, respectively. Major 
advantages of the method developed include reduction of laboratory work in the 
sample preparation step by the use of 96-well SPE plates and the sensitive 
measurement of a large number of metabolites in a very short run time, which 
makes it ideal for use in epidemiological studies.

Nut skins are considered to be a rich source of polyphenols and may be partially 
responsible for the numerous health effects associated with nut consumption. 
However, more bioavailability studies of nut skin polyphenols are needed to 
understand the health effects derived from nut consumption. The aim of the 
present study was to determine the profiles of both phase II and 
microbial-derived phenolic metabolites in plasma and urine samples before and 
after the intake of almond skin polyphenols by healthy human subjects (n = 2). 
Glucuronide, O-methyl glucuronide, sulfate, and O-methyl sulfate derivatives of 
(epi)catechin, as well as the glucuronide conjugates of naringenin and 
glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of isorhamnetin, were detected in plasma and 
urine samples after consumption of almond skin polyphenols. The main 
microbial-derived metabolites of flavanols, such as 
5-(dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 
5-(hydroxymethoxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, were also detected in their 
glucuronide and sulfate forms. In addition, numerous metabolites derived from 
further microbial degradation of hydroxyphenylvalerolactones, including 
hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, hydroxycinnamic, hydroxybenzoic, 
and hydroxyhippuric acids, registered major changes in urine after the 
consumption of almond skin polyphenols. The urinary excretion of these microbial 
metabolites was estimated to account for a larger proportion of the total 
polyphenol ingested than phase II metabolites of (epi)catechin, indicating the 
important role of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism of highly polymerized 
almond skin polyphenols. To the authors' knowledge this study constitutes the 
most complete report of the absorption of almond skin polyphenols in humans.

The biological properties of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) polyphenols are strictly 
dependent on their bioavailability. A long-term cocoa feeding trial was 
performed with subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Subjects (n=42) 
received two sachets of 20 g of cocoa powder/day with 250 mL of skimmed milk 
each, or only 500 mL/day of skimmed milk, both for two 4-week periods. The 
phenolic metabolic profile including phase II conjugated metabolites and 
phenolic acids derived from the intestinal microbiota was determined by LC-MS/MS 
in both 24-h urine and fasting plasma. The analysis of 24-h urine revealed 
significant increases of phase II metabolites, including glucuronides and 
sulfate conjugates of (-)-epicatechin, O-methyl-epicatechin, 
5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 
5-(3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, after regular cocoa intake. 
In the case of plasma, only glucuronide conjugates of 
dihydroxyphenylvalerolactones increased. Regular consumption of cocoa also 
resulted in a significant increase in the urinary excretion of colonic 
microbial-derived phenolic metabolites, including vanillic, 
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acids, and particularly 
5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, whereas only the two latter 
metabolites showed a significant increase in fasting plasma. The results found 
herein indicate that 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 
hydroxyphenylacetic acids could be good biomarkers of the regular consumption of 
cocoa and therefore, of flavanol-rich foods.

Health effects of cocoa flavonols depend on their bioavailability, which is 
strongly influenced by the food matrix and the degree of flavanol 
polymerization. The effect of milk on the bioavailability of cocoa flavanoids 
considering phase II metabolites of epicatechin has been the subject of 
considerable debate. This work studies the effect of milk at the colonic 
microbial metabolism level of the nonabsorbed flavanol fraction that reaches the 
colon and is metabolized by the colonic microbiota into various phenolic acids. 
Twenty-one human volunteers followed a diet low in polyphenols for at least 48 h 
before taking, in a random order, 40 g of cocoa powder dissolved either in 250 
mL of whole milk or in 250 mL of water. Urine samples were collected before the 
intake and during three different periods (0-6, 6-12, and 12-24 h). Phenolic 
acids were analyzed by LC-MS/MS after solid-phase extraction. Of the 15 
metabolites assessed, the excretion of 9 phenolic acids was affected by the 
intake of milk. The urinary concentration of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, 
protocatechuic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, 4-hydroxyhippuric, hippuric, caffeic, and 
ferulic acids diminished after the intake of cocoa with milk, whereas urinary 
concentrations of vanillic and phenylacetic acids increased. In conclusion, milk 
partially affects the formation of microbial phenolic acids derived from the 
colonic degradation of procyanidins and other compounds present in cocoa powder.

A reversed-phase HPLC procedure is proposed for the determination of seven 
flavonoids (luteolin, nepetin, hispidulin, jaceosidin, cirsimaritin, 
cirsilineol, and eupatorin) in vervain samples. A simple extractive technique 
was developed, involving only extraction with ethyl ether, which allowed the 
elimination of phenolic acids, yielding a sufficiently purified flavonoid 
fraction. All of the analyzed vervain samples showed a common flavonoid pattern, 
in which hispidulin and jaceosidin were the major compounds and nepetin was the 
minor compound.

Total aliphatic and indole glucosinolates, phenolic compounds (flavonoids and 
hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives), and vitamin C contents were evaluated in freshly 
harvested broccoli (Brassica oleracea L., var. italica, cv. Marathon) 
inflorescences. These were film-wrapped and stored for 7 days at 1 degrees C to 
simulate a maximum period of commercial transport and distribution. After cold 
storage, inflorescences were kept for 3 days at 15 degrees C to simulate a 
retail sale period. For wrapping, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) of 11 microm 
thickness was used. Gas composition was about 17% O(2) and 2% CO(2) during cold 
storage and about 16% O(2) and 3-4% CO(2) during shelf life within packages. The 
predominant glucosinolates were 4-methylsulfinylbutyl-glucosinolate 
(glucoraphanin), 3-indolylmethyl-glucosinolate (glucobrassicin), and 
1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl-glucosinolate (neoglucobrassicin). The predominant 
hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives were identified as 1,2,2'-trisinapoylgentiobiose, 
1,2-diferuloylgentiobiose, 1,2'-disinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose, and 
3-O-caffeoyl-quinic (neochlorogenic acid). Results showed major losses at the 
end of both periods, in comparison with broccoli at harvest. Thus, the 
respective losses, at the end of cold storage and retail periods, were 71-80% of 
total glucosinolates, 62-59% of total flavonoids, 51-44% of sinapic acid 
derivatives, and 73-74% caffeoyl-quinic acid derivatives. Slight differences in 
all compound concentrations between storage and retail sale periods were 
detected. Distribution and retail periods had minimal effects on vitamin C. 
Weight loss was monitored at the end of both periods.

Orange juice is a very rich source of dietary flavanones. The effect of 
flavanone concentration and solubility of orange beverages on their 
bioavailability has been studied in a crossover study with 10 healthy 
volunteers. Five different beverages with different flavanone concentrations 
were evaluated. Commercial orange juices (29.2-70.3 mg of flavanones/100 mL) 
were compared with experimental orange beverages in which the flavanone 
concentration was enhanced (110.2 mg/100 mL). Hesperetin and naringenin 
glucuronides and sulfates were detected and quantified in plasma and urine. The 
study shows that the solubility of the flavanones, and particularly that of 
hesperidin, in the juice is a key factor for the bioavailability as flavanone 
excretion and the C(max) in plasma correlate well with the soluble flavanone 
concentration in the juice, whereas it has no correlation with the total 
flavanone intake. In addition, a large interindividual variation was observed, 
this being consistent for each individual after the intake of the different 
beverages, suggesting that flavanone bioavailability is also dependent on the 
occurrence of specific microbiota that is able to remove the rutinosides from 
the juice glycosides, which results in aglycones that are then absorbed from the 
gut.

Tomatoes and tomato-based products are rich in antioxidants such as carotenoids, 
vitamin C and polyphenols. The industrial processing of diced tomatoes involves 
heat treatments in which these antioxidant compounds may be potentially 
affected. In this study, we evaluate the effect of each separate step in the 
dice-making process. Three technological processes were investigated: Hot, Cold 
and Cold treated with calcium salt (CaCl2). Four stages were monitored in each 
process: (1) fresh tomatoes; (2) peeled tomatoes; (3) diced tomatoes; and (4) 
final product after sauce addition. The main tool for minimising or 
counteracting the eventual processing damage was the strategy of 
'reconstitution', achieved by adding a sauce rich in seeds and peels with high 
levels of antioxidants and phenolics to the diced tomatoes. Different analyses 
were carried out in order to evaluate the effect of each processing step. First, 
total polyphenols (TP) were evaluated using Folin-Ciocalteau (F-C) assay and 
antioxidant activity using ABTS(+) and DPPH assays. Flavonols, flavanones, 
hydroxycinnamic and phenolic acids were then quantified using liquid 
chromatography/electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry 
(HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). The combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that each processing step induces 
alterations in the antioxidant and phenolic profile, and in particular sauce 
addition and calcium treatment significantly affected the levels of antioxidants 
and phenolics during the dice-making process.

Information on phyto-oestrogen intake in various populations has been scanty 
until now, primarily because data on the content of these compounds in foods 
were lacking. We report here on expansion of the Finnish National Food 
Composition Database (Fineli) with values for the plant lignans matairesinol and 
secoisolariciresinol and the isoflavones daidzein and genistein. The values, 
expressed as aglycones, were based on food analyses (mainly GC-MS) or imputed 
from analytical data for 180 foods for lignans and 160 foods for isoflavones; 
additionally, over 1000 values were derived from the recipe database of Fineli. 
Average intake of these phyto-oestrogens was calculated using food consumption 
data of the National Dietary Survey FINDIET 1997, which was carried out in a 
random sample of the adult population in five areas in Finland. The dietary data 
were collected by 24 h recall =2862). The mean lignan intake was 434 (standard 
deviation (SD) 1575) microg/d and the mean isoflavone intake was 788 (SD 673) 
microg/d. Women had a higher lignan density (microg lignans/MJ) in their diet 
than men (P<0.05). Men had a higher mean daily isoflavone intake, 902 (SD 368) 
microg, than women, 668 (SD 963) microg (P<0.05). The sources of lignans were 
many: seeds, cereals, fruit, berries and vegetables. The main sources of 
isoflavones appeared to be processed meat products/sausages containing soya as 
an ingredient, and legumes as such. The average intake of lignans and 
isoflavones in Finland seems to be low, but intake varies throughout the 
population.

Consumers' increasing interest in the relationship between diet and health is a 
sign for food producers to pay more attention to potential health-protecting 
compounds in new product development and food processing. From a production 
chain perspective the choice of the raw material that is used is important for 
the health-protecting potential of the end product. Four apple cultivars 
(Jonagold, Golden Delicious, Cox's Orange, and Elstar), which can be used as 
fresh apples or in processed apple products, were compared with regard to 
flavonol, catechins, phloridzin, and chlorogenic acid concentrations and 
antioxidant activity. Jonagold apples possessed the highest flavonoid 
concentration and the highest antioxidant activity. To study seasonal 
differences, apples from three different harvest years were analyzed, but in 
three cultivars no effect on flavonoid concentration and antioxidant activity 
was observed. Long-term storage, both at refrigerator temperature and under 
controlled atmosphere conditions, was found not to influence flavonoid 
concentration or antioxidant activity.

The suitability of a simple and rapid isocratic RP-HPLC method with amperometric 
electrochemical detection for the simultaneous detection and quantification of 
hydroxycinnamic acids and their corresponding aroma-active volatile phenols in 
wort and beer is reported. The technique gives good specificity and sensitivity, 
and can therefore be used for routine monitoring of hydroxycinnamic acids in 
wort and the development of volatile phenolic flavour compounds during the beer 
production process and subsequent conservation.

Chestnut (Castanea sativa) is an important basic food in rural diets and a major 
starch crop used in a similar way to potatoes. Chestnuts are a fundamental 
economic resource in the ""chestnut regions"" not only for the fruit but also for 
the chestnut wood. Chestnuts have become increasingly important with respect to 
human health, for example, as an alternative gluten-free flour source. Chestnuts 
are also a rich source of other beneficial compounds, but there have been few 
studies on the composition during processing. In this study, we analyzed the 
chemical composition of three Portuguese cultivars at different stages of 
industrial processing. The chestnut cultivars were Longal, Judia, and Martaínha. 
All three cultivars had high moisture contents but were low in ash, crude fat, 
and crude protein contents, with high starch and low fiber contents. The free 
amino acid contents, including various essential amino acids, varied depending 
on the cultivar. All three cultivars also had a significant content of 
polyphenolics with gallic acid; ellagic acid was predominant among hydrolyzable 
and condensed tannins. Many of these compounds are known to exert significant 
positive effects on human health. The one-way analysis of variance for fresh 
chestnut shows significant differences among the three cultivars for most of the 
studied parameters. The same statistical analysis applied to each one of the two 
cultivars (Judia and Longal) sampled for the four processing steps analyzed 
indicates a significant effect of this factor in practically all of the 
constituents. On the other hand, the two-way analysis of variance shows that, 
besides the residual, the processing step and the interaction cultivar x 
processing step were the factors that more contributed for the total variation 
observed in the constituents analyzed, while the contribution of cultivar was 
much less significant.

Hydroxytyrosol is the most potent phenolic antioxidant of olive oil and olive 
mill waste water (OMWW) and its biological activities have stimulated research 
on its potential role in cardiovascular protection. However, evidence of the 
absorption of OMWW phenolics and on their possible in vivo activity has, until 
now, never been provided. Three groups male Sprague-Dawley rats were 
administered 1, 5, or 10 mg/Kg of the OMWW extract, respectively, providing 
41.4, 207, and 414 microg/Kg of hydroxytyrosol, respectively. Urine was 
collected for 24 h and the urinary levels of hydroxytyrosol were quantified by 
mass spectrometry. Hydroxytyrosol was dose-dependently (R(2) = 0.95) absorbed 
and excreted in the urines mostly as a glucuronide conjugate. Further, the 
administration of an hydroxytyrosol-rich OMWW extract (10 mg/kg) to the rats was 
also associated with an increase of their plasma antioxidant capacity. Future 
experiments will eventually further clarify its metabolic fate and its in vivo 
actions.

Interest in the in vivo biological activities of olive oil phenolics is rapidly 
growing, and different models and vehicles of administration are used worldwide. 
Matters of practicality determine the use of rats rather than humans as the 
model of choice. Also, growing interest in nutraceuticals is leading to the 
formulation of compounds containing olive oil phenols. In this study, we 
compared metabolism and urinary excretion of hydroxytyrosol [(HT), the most 
representative phenol of olive oil] between rats and humans by evaluating 
excretion of HT and its major metabolite, homovanillyl alcohol. Also, we 
compared human excretion of HT when consumed as a natural component of extra 
virgin olive oil, when added to refined olive oil, or when added to yogurt (as 
an approximation of functional food). Urinary excretion of HT was greater in 
humans than in rats, a species with a high basal excretion of HT and its 
metabolites. The high (234% of HT administered) excretion of free HT suggests 
that hydrolysis of oleuropein administered in humans (still an unresolved issue) 
occurs in vivo. Moreover, human HT excretion was much higher after its 
administration as a natural component of olive oil (44.2% of HT administered) 
than after its addition to refined olive oil (23% of HT administered) or yogurt 
(5.8% of dose or approximately 13% of that recorded after virgin olive oil 
intake). These data suggest that the rat is not the appropriate model for the 
study of HT metabolism and that HT-containing functional foods should be 
carefully formulated.

Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and 
development of atherosclerosis. Stilbenes have been shown to protect 
lipoproteins from oxidative damage and to have cancer chemopreventive activity. 
We describe a method for the direct determination of stilbenes in several red 
wines using high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. In a 
survey of 12 commercial wines from the south of Brazil (Rio Grande del Sul), 
levels of delta-viniferin are reported for the first time in different varieties 
of red wines. Brazilian red wine contains trans-astringin, trans-piceid, 
trans-resveratrol, cis-resveratrol (in high quantity: 5 times more than the 
trans form), epsilon-viniferin, and a compound isolated for the first time in 
wine, trans-delta-viniferin. Isolation and identification of delta-viniferin was 
achieved by NMR after extraction and fractionation of red wine phenolics. 
delta-Viniferin contributes, as well as cis-resveratrol and trans-piceid, to a 
significant proportion of stilbenes in wine dietary intake, particularly with 
Merlot varieties containing an average level of 10 mg/L for delta-viniferin, 15 
mg/L for cis-resveratrol, and 13 mg/L for trans-piceid. The total stilbene 
intake from wine origin was estimated for the Brazilian population as 5.3 mg/day 
per person (on the basis of a regular wine consumption of 160 mL/day). 
delta-Viniferin can contribute to around 20% of total stilbenes in wine (average 
of 6.4 mg/L in red Brazilian wines). It would be important in the future to 
investigate the origins of the differences in wine stilbene levels in relation 
to the vine varieties, and the bioavailability of the newly extracted stilbene 
delta-viniferin in plasma after consumption of different types of wines.

The amounts of myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol were analyzed in 16 red and 
2 white berry and grape wines after acid hydrolysis using an RP-HPLC method with 
diode array detection. The red berry wines analyzed were made mainly from black 
currant, crowberry, and bog whortleberry, i.e., berries rich in flavonols. The 
red grape wines were made mainly from Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot grapes in 
several countries. The white wines studied were gooseberry and white currant 
wines and Chardonnay and Riesling wines. The amount of myricetin ranged from 3.8 
to 22.6 mg L(-1) in red berry wines and from 0 to 14.6 mg L(-1) in red grape 
wines. The amount of quercetin was from 2.2 to 24.3 mg L(-1) red berry wines and 
from <1.2 to 19.4 mg L(-1) in red grape wines. Low levels of kaempferol were 
found in all red berry wines and in 9 red grape wines. The total concentration 
of these flavonols was from 6 to 46 mg L(-1) (mean 20 mg L(-1)) in red berry 
wines and from 4 to 31 mg L(-1) (mean 15 mg L(-1)) in red grape wines. Small 
amounts of quercetin were found in white currant and gooseberry wines, whereas 
no flavonols were detected in white grape wines. These results demonstrate that

Five types of caneberries [evergreen blackberries (Rubus laciniatus), 
marionberries (Rubus ursinus), boysenberries (Rubus ursinus x idaeus), red 
raspberries (Rubus idaeus), and black raspberries (Rubus occidentalis)] were 
analyzed for antioxidant activity by measuring their oxygen radical absorbance 
capacity (ORAC). In addition, the berries were analyzed for total phenolics, 
anthocyanins, procyanidins, and ellagic acid content. All of the berries had 
high ORAC activity ranging from 24 to 77.2 micromol of Trolox equiv/g of fresh 
berries. Anthocyanin content ranged from 0.65 to 5.89 mg/g, and phenolics ranged 
from 4.95 to 9.8 mg/g. Black raspberries had the highest ORAC and anthocyanin 
and phenolic contents. Only red raspberries had detectable amounts of 
procyanidin oligomers (monomer, dimers, and trimers). All berries had high 
levels of ellagic acid (47-90 mg/g), but boysenberries had the highest level 
prior to hydrolysis. The results from this study indicate that these caneberries 
were high in antioxidant activity and were rich sources of anthocyanins and 
phenolics.

Dietary factors affecting polyphenol bioavailability.

While many epidemiological studies have associated the consumption of 
polyphenols within fruits and vegetables with a decreased risk of developing 
several chronic diseases, intervention studies have generally not confirmed 
these beneficial effects. The reasons for this discrepancy are not fully 
understood but include potential differences in dosing, interaction with the 
food matrix, and differences in polyphenol bioavailability. In addition to 
endogenous factors such as microbiota and digestive enzymes, the food matrix can 
also considerably affect bioaccessibility, uptake, and further metabolism of 
polyphenols. While dietary fiber (such as hemicellulose), divalent minerals, and 
viscous and protein-rich meals are likely to cause detrimental effects on 
polyphenol bioaccessibility, digestible carbohydrates, dietary lipids 
(especially for hydrophobic polyphenols, e.g., curcumin), and additional 
antioxidants may enhance polyphenol availability. Following epithelial uptake, 
polyphenols such as flavonoids may reduce phase II metabolism and excretion, 
enhancing polyphenol bioavailability. Furthermore, polyphenols may act 
synergistically due to their influence on efflux transporters such as 
p-glycoprotein. In order to understand polyphenol bioactivity, increased 
knowledge of the factors affecting polyphenol bioavailability, including dietary 
factors, is paramount.

Fruits and leaves from different cultivars of thornless blackberry (Rubus sp.), 
red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.), black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis L.), and 
strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa D.) plants were analyzed for total antioxidant 
capacity (oxygen radical absorbance capacity, ORAC) and total phenolic content. 
In addition, fruits were analyzed for total anthocyanin content. Blackberries 
and strawberries had the highest ORAC values during the green stages, whereas 
red raspberries had the highest ORAC activity at the ripe stage. Total 
anthocyanin content increased with maturity for all three species of fruits. 
Compared with fruits, leaves were found to have higher ORAC values. In fruits, 
ORAC values ranged from 7.8 to 33.7 micromol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g of 
fresh berries (35. 0-162.1 micromol of TE/g of dry matter), whereas in leaves, 
ORAC values ranged from 69.7 to 182.2 micromol of TE/g of fresh leaves 
(205.0-728.8 micromol of TE/g of dry matter). As the leaves become older, the 
ORAC values and total phenolic contents decreased. The results showed a linear 
correlation between total phenolic content and ORAC activity for fruits and 
leaves. For ripe berries, a linear relationship existed between ORAC values and 
anthocyanin content. Of the ripe fruits tested, on the basis of wet weight of 
fruit, cv. Jewel black raspberry and blackberries may be the richest source for 
antioxidants. On the basis of the dry weight of fruit, strawberries had the 
highest ORAC activity followed by black raspberries (cv. Jewel), blackberries, 
and red raspberries.

Tea is a popular beverage almost all over the world. Many studies show that tea 
consumption is closely associated with positive health impact. Most of the HPLC 
methods used for the determination of tea constituents include gradient elution 
systems which involve expensive instrumentation. The objective of this study was 
to develop a simple, rapid precise and low cost HPLC method for the separation 
and quantification of catechins and caffeine in tea (Camellia sinensis). The 
method utilizes a phenyl column (2.1 × 150 mm) with a UV-detector (280 nm) where 
excellent chromatographic separation of tea components i.e. gallic acid (GA), 
caffeine (Caf), epicatechin (EC) and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was 
achieved. The isocratic elution system of acetonitrile, glacial acetic acid and 
deionized water (8:1:91 v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min was involved. This 
method produced excellent accuracy and precision. Within run and between run 
precision was less than 7.5 %. The equations for calibration curves were 
y = 0.117 (±0.010)x + 0.173 (±0.024), y = 0.100 (±0.003)x + 0.045 (±0.019), 
y = 0.016 (±0.001)x + 0.006 (±0.004), y = 0.025 (±0.001)x-0.025 (±0.007) for GA, 
Caf, EC and EGCG respectively. The method validation parameters prove that the 
method is efficient, a simple and adequate for the quantitative determination of 
principal components in tea samples.

Cultural system [hill plasticulture (HC) versus matted row (MR)] and genotype 
interactions affected strawberry fruit quality. In general, fruit soluble solids 
content, total sugar, fructose, glucose, ascorbic acid, titratable acid, and 
citric acid contents were increased in the HC system. Fruit from HC also had 
higher flavonoid contents and antioxidant capacities. Strawberry fruit contains 
flavonols as well as other phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins and phenolic 
acids. Pelargonidin-based anthocyanins such as pelargonidin 3-glucoside, 
pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside-succinate were the 
predominant anthocyanins in strawberry fruit. The content of cyanidin-based 
anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, was much 
lower than that of pelargonidin-based anthocyanins in either system. Strawberry 
fruit from the HC system had significantly higher amounts of p-coumaroylglucose, 
dihydroflavonol, quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin 3-glucuronide, kaempferol 
3-glucoside, kaempferol 3-glucuronide, cyanidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 
3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, and 
pelargonidin 3-glucoside-succinate. Fruits from plants grown in the MR system 
generally had the lowest contents of phenolic acids, flavonols, and 
anthocyanins. Strawberry fruit grown under HC conditions had significantly 
higher peroxyl radicals (ROO*) absorbance capacity (ORAC).

Distillation wastewaters (DWWs) are generated during the essential oil steam 
distillation from aromatic herbs. Despite of growing interest on novel source of 
natural antioxidant compounds as food additives, studies on DWWs are scarse. 
Herein, the potential of DWWs produced by the distillation of packaged fresh 
basil, rosemary and sage wastes was evaluated by chemical and antioxidant 
characterization. HPLC-DAD-HRMS profiling revealed that DWWs contain 
water-soluble phenolic compounds, mainly caffeic acid derivatives and flavonoid 
glycosides, with rosmarinic acid (RA) as predominant components 
(29-135mg/100mL). DWWs demonstrated high levels of total phenolic compounds 
(TPC, 152-443mg GAE/100mL) and strong antioxidant capacities, in ORAC, DPPH and 
ABTS assays (1101-4720, 635-4244 and 571-3145μmol TE/100mL, respectively). 
Highly significant correlations of TEAC values with TPC and RA contents revealed 
that phenolic compounds and high RA content were responsible of DWWs antioxidant 
properties.Thus, DWWs are proposed as a new promising source of natural food 
additives and/or functional ingredients for cosmetic, nutraceutical and food 
applications.

To identify the major metabolites of resveratrol in rat, rat urine samples were 
pretreated by using solid-phase extraction technique (SPE) with polyamide 
cartridges. And a LC-MS/MS method with electrospray ionisation (ESI), negative 
ion mode and collision induced dissociation (CID), was used to elucidate the 
structures of the major metabolites of resveratrol. According to the results of 
our experiment, we found that the main metabolites of resveratrol were 
resveratrol monoglucuronide (M1), dihydroresveratrol monosulfate (M2), 
resveratrol monosulfate (M3) and dihydroresveratrol (M4).

PURPOSE: Polygonum cuspidatum extract as a traditional Chinese medicine is 
extracted from the dried rhizome and root of Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb.et Zucc. 
Resveratrol is one of its active components. Studies were performed in rats to 
define the tissue distribution and excretion of resveratrol in urine and bile, 
and to characterize (if possible) any metabolites of resveratrol observed in 
tissues after ig 20mg/kg Polygonum cuspidatum extract.
METHOD: For tissue distribution studies, tissues (300 mg) were homogenized and 
centrifuged with methanol, and metabolites found in selected tissue extract were 
identified by LC/MS/MS. For urinary and biliary excretion experiments, urine and 
bile samples were cleaned up by using solid-phase extraction (SPE) with 
polyamide cartridges. All the concentrations of resveratrol in these biological 
samples were determined by HPLC with UV detection.
RESULT: After a single oral dose of 20mg/kg PCE in rats, resveratrol was mainly 
distributed in stomach, duodenum, liver and kidney with detectable metabolites 
resveratrol monoglucuronide and resveratrol monosulfate. The majority of the 
resveratrol was excreted as metabolites, only 0.59% and 0.027% of the dosage 
were excreted in urine and bile respectively as unchanged drug within 24h.

A sensitive ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method has 
been developed and validated for the quantification of taxifolin in rat plasma. 
Following liquid/liquid extraction by ethyl acetate, the analytes were separated 
on a Sunfire (2.1 mm x 50 mm, 3.5 microm) column and analyzed in the selected 
ion recording with a negative electrospray ionization mode. The method was 
linear over the concentration range of 6-6750 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-day 
precisions were all within 8% and accuracy ranged from 92.9% to 105.1%. The 
lower limit of quantification was 6 ng/mL. The present method was successfully 
applied to the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin 
following intravenous and oral administration to rats. The absolute 
bioavailability of taxifolin was 0.17% in rat.

To take advantage of the various pharmacologic activities of soy bean 
isoflavones, more detailed studies of the absorption and excretion rates of 
these compounds in humans and subsequent evaluation of their bioavailabilities 
are required. We conducted a pharmacokinetic study of soybean isoflavones in 
seven healthy male volunteers. After ingestion of 60 g of kinako (baked soybean 
powder, containing 103 micromol daidzein and 112 micromol genistein), changes of 
the isoflavone and metabolite concentrations in plasma, urine and feces were 
measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The plasma concentration of 
genistein increased after 2 h and reached its highest value of 2.44 +/- 0.65 
micromol/L 6 h later. The plasma concentration of daidzein peaked at 1.56 +/- 
0.34 micromol/L at the same time, but it was always lower than that of 
genistein. Peak plasma concentration of O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) and equol 
appeared after the daidzein peak in four and two subjects, respectively. In 
contrast with plasma, daidzein was the main component in urine. Urinary daidzein 
excretion started to increase shortly after the rise in its plasma concentration 
and reached 2.4 micromol/h 8 h after ingestion of kinako. Genistein excretion in 
urine paralleled that of daidzein, but the value at 6 h was about half (1.1 
micromol/h). The majority of ingested isoflavones after ingestion of kinako were 
recovered on d 2 or 3 in the feces. Total recovery of daidzein, O-DMA and equol 
from urine and feces was 54.7%, calculated from daidzein intake; 20.1% of 
administered genistein was recovered as genistein. The half-lives of plasma 
genistein and daidzein were 8.36 and 5.79 h, respectively. The individual plasma 
and urinary concentrations of equol and O-DMA were quite variable; subjects were 
classified as high and low metabolizers. The high plasma concentration of 
isoflavones for at least several hours after a single ingestion of soy protein 
suggests that these compounds may interact with macromolecules and have 
biological effects.

The consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains rich in antioxidative 
phytochemicals is associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as 
cancer, coronary heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, cataract, and 
aged-related functional decline. For example, phenolic acids are among the main 
antioxidative phytochemicals in grains that have been shown to be beneficial to 
human health. Corn (Zea mays L.) is a major staple food in several parts of the 
world; thus, the antioxidant activity of several corn types was evaluated. The 
2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl free radical (DPPH*) scavenging activity, total 
phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant capacity of lipid-soluble substances (ACL), 
oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and phenolic acid compositions of 
typical and mutant genotypes (typical-1, waxy, typical-2, and high-amylose) were 
investigated. The DPPH* scavenging activity at 60 min was 34.39-44.51% in 
methanol extracts and 60.41-67.26% in HCl/methanol (1/99, v/v) extracts of corn. 
The DPPH* scavenging activity of alkaline hydrolysates of corn ranged from 48.63 
to 64.85%. The TPC ranged from 0.67 to 1.02 g and from 0.91 to 2.15 g of ferulic 
acid equiv/kg of corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. The 
TPC of alkaline hydrolysates ranged from 2.74 to 6.27 g of ferulic acid equiv/kg 
of corn. The ACL values were 0.41-0.80 and 0.84-1.59 g of Trolox equiv/kg of 
corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. The ORAC values were 
10.57-12.47 and 18.76-24.92 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn in methanol and 
HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. ORAC values of alkaline hydrolysates ranged 
from 42.85 to 68.31 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn. The composition of phenolic 
acids in alkaline hydrolysates of corn was p-hydroxybenzoic acid (5.08-10.6 
mg/kg), vanillic acid (3.25-14.71 mg/kg), caffeic acid (2.32-25.73 mg/kg), 
syringic acid (12.37-24.48 mg/kg), p-coumaric acid (97.87-211.03 mg/kg), ferulic 
acid (1552.48-2969.10 mg/kg), and o-coumaric acid (126.53-575.87 mg/kg). Levels 
of DPPH* scavenging activity, TPC, ACL, and ORAC in HCl/methanol extracts were 
obviously higher than those present in methanol extracts. There was no 
significant loss of antioxidant capacity when corn was dried at relatively high 
temperatures (65 and 93 degrees C) postharvest as compared to drying at ambient 
temperatures (27 degrees C). Alkaline hydrolysates showed very high TPC, ACL, 
and ORAC values when compared to methanol and HCl/methanol extracts. 
High-amylose corn had a better antioxidant capacity than did typical (nonmutant) 
corn genotypes.

Crude extracts of evening primrose meal were prepared in 56% (v/v) acetone and 
separated into six fractions (I-VI) using a Sephadex LH-20 column. Qualitative 
tests for phenolic and vanillin positive compounds produced positive results for 
all fractions. Silica gel thin-layer chromatography of fractions III and V 
allowed the location and isolation of two spots containing moderate to strong 
antioxidative compounds. High-performance liquid chromatography of the spot 
isolated from fraction III showed the resolution of two structurally related 
compounds, whereas that of the spot from fraction V showed the presence of one 
compound. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electron impact mass 
spectrometry produced sufficient evidence to identify the isolated compounds as 
(+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and gallic acid. These compounds accounted for 
about 10.5 and 1.7% of the dry mass of the crude extracts and meal, 
respectively.

The lipophilic character of quercetin suggests that it can cross enterocyte 
membranes via simple diffusion. Therefore, it should be more bioavailable than 
its glucosides, which require preliminary hydrolysis or active transport for 
absorption. However, the published human studies show that quercetin is less 
bioavailable than its glucosides. Assuming that low bioavailability of quercetin 
aglycone provided to humans as a pure substance is the result of its low 
solubility in the digestive tract, we studied its bioavailability from dietary 
sources in which quercetin was dispersed in the food matrix. In a randomized 
crossover study, 9 volunteers took a single dose of either shallot flesh (99.2% 
quercetin glucosides and 0.8% quercetin aglycone) or dry shallot skin (83.3% 
quercetin aglycone and 16.7% quercetin glucosides), providing 1.4 mg quercetin 
per kg of body weight. Blood samples were collected before and after consumption 
of shallot preparations. Plasma quercetin was measured on HPLC with 
electrochemical detection after plasma enzymatic treatment. The maximum plasma 
quercetin concentration of 1.02 +/- 0.13 micromol/L was reached at 2.33 +/- 0.50 
h after shallot flesh consumption compared with 3.95 +/- 0.62 micromol/L at 2.78 
+/- 0.15 h after dry skin consumption. The area under the concentration-time 
curve after dry skin consumption was 47.23 +/- 7.53 micromol x h(-1) x L(-1) and 
was significantly higher than that after shallot flesh intake (22.23 +/- 2.32 
micromol x h(-1) x L(-1)). When provided along with dietary sources, quercetin 
aglycone is more bioavailable than its glucosides in humans. Results point to 
the food matrix as a key factor.

BACKGROUND: Little information is currently available on the role of the gut 
microflora in modulating isoflavone bioavailability or on sex differences in 
isoflavone metabolism and bioavailability.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether chronic soy consumption influences 
isoflavone bioavailability as judged by plasma isoflavone concentrations and 
modified gut microflora activities [beta-glucoside hydrolysis and equol and 
O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) production]. We also examined whether sex 
differences in isoflavone metabolism exist.
DESIGN: A randomized, parallel, controlled study design was used to compare a 
high-soy diet (104 +/- 24 mg total isoflavones/d) with a low-soy diet (0.54 +/- 
0.58 mg total isoflavones/d) in 76 healthy young adults for 10 wk.
RESULTS: Concentrations of isoflavones and their gut microflora metabolites in 
the plasma, urine, and feces were significantly higher in the subjects who 
consumed the high-soy diet than in those who consumed the low-soy diet. 
Concentrations of O-DMA in plasma and urine were higher in the men than in the 
women. Fecal bacteria from subjects consuming both diets could convert daidzein 
to equol ex vivo. Fecal beta-glucosidase activity was significantly higher in 
the subjects who consumed the high-soy diet than in those who consumed the 
low-soy diet.
CONCLUSIONS: Although interindividual variation in isoflavone metabolism was 
high, intraindividual variation was low. Only concentrations of O-DMA in plasma 
and urine appeared to be influenced by sex. Chronic soy consumption does not 
appear to induce many significant changes to the gut metabolism of isoflavones 
other than higher beta-glucosidase activity.

Anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins were characterized by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS coupled 
with a diode array and/or fluorescent detector in seven cultivars of Ribes 
nigrum (black currant) and Ribes rubrum (red currant, Red Lake), six cultivars 
of Ribes grossularia (gooseberries), Aronia melanocarpa(chokeberry), and 
Sambucus nigra (elderberry). Thirty-one different anthocyanins were detected in 
these berries, but not every anthocyanin was observed in each berry. A number of 
minor anthocyanins were identified from these berries for the first time. The 
concentrations of individual anthocyanins in all of the berries were quantified 
using relevant anthocyanidin 3-glucoside standards. Among the berries studied in 
this paper and in berries in general, chokeberry has the highest total 
anthocyanin concentrations [1480 mg/100 g of fresh weight (FW)], whereas the 
lowest total anthocyanin concentration in the berries studied was found in the 
gooseberry cv. Careless, which contained only 0.07 mg/100 g of FW. Two cultivars 
of gooseberries (Marigold and Leveller) did not contain any anthocyanins. Total 
proanthocyanidin concentrations in the berries studied ranged from 23 to 664 
mg/100 g of FW in elderberry and chokeberry, respectively. Procyanidin or 
prodelphinidin polymers were the predominant components (>65% w/w) in most of 
the berries. The lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities were measured 
by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC(FL)) procedure. The total 
antioxidant capacity varied from 21 micromol of TE/g of FW in Careless 
gooseberry to 161 micromol of TE/g of FW in chokeberry. Total phenolics in the 
berries in general paralleled hydrophilic antioxidant capacity.

Weaning pigs (7.9 +/- 1.7 kg) were fed a freeze-dried powder of marionberry (MB) 
by stomach tube to study the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins. Four 
major anthocyanins (ACNs) were found in MB: cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-glc, 
78%), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (Cy-3-rutin, 20%), pelargonidin-3-glucoside 
(Pg-3-glc, 0.4%), and 1 unknown acylated cyanidin-based ACN (UACy, 1.5%). In the 
urine, the 4 original ACNs and 11 metabolites were identified and quantified. 
The main metabolites were glucuronidated and/or methylated forms of the original 
anthocyanins. Total recovery of the 4 original ACNs plus their related 
metabolites was 0.087 +/- 0.034% for Cy-3-glc, 0.084 +/- 0.026% for Cy-3-rutin, 
0.583 +/- 0.229% for Pg-3-glc and 0.036 +/- 0.011% for UACy (mean +/- SD, n = 
3), respectively. For the individual ACNs, the amount of metabolites recovered 
from Cy-3-rutin was lower than that of the original intact Cy-3-rutin, whereas 
the amounts of metabolites from Cy-3-glc and Pg-3-glc in the urine were much 
higher than their original forms. In pig plasma, the 2 original ACNs, Cy-3-glc 
and Cy-3-rutin, and a trace of 1 metabolite (cyanidin monoglucuronide) were 
detected. The plasma concentration:dose ratio of Cy-3-rutin was higher than that 
of Cy-3-glc. Different aglycones and/or sugar moieties may influence the 
absorption and metabolism of ACNs. Cy-3-glc and Cy-3-rutin had similar apparent 
excretion rates relative to dose, whereas Pg-3-glc had a much higher total 
urinary excretion than cyanidin-based anthocyanins. Most of Cy-3-glc and 
Pg-3-glc were excreted in the form of metabolites, whereas most of the 
Cy-3-rutin was excreted in its original unmetabolized form. Urinary recovery of 
the acylated anthocyanin was lower than that of nonacylated anthocyanins.

To investigate the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins (ACNs) with 
different aglycones and sugar moieties, weanling pigs (11.4 +/- 3.8 kg) were 
fed, in a single meal, a freeze-dried powder of chokeberry, black currant, or 
elderberry at a single dose of 229, 140, or 228 mumol total ACN/kg body weight 
(BW), respectively. These berries provided ACNs with differences in aglycone as 
well as some unique differences in the sugar moieties. The relative proportions 
of the different metabolites depended upon concentrations, quantities consumed, 
and types of glycoside of ACNs in the berry. Delphinidin ACNs were not 
metabolized to any measurable extent. Cyanidin ACNs were metabolized via 
methylation and glucuronidation as well as by formation of both derivatives on 
the same ACN molecule. ACNs with either a di- or trisaccharide attached to them 
were excreted in the urine primarily as the intact form. Over 80% of the ACN 
compounds containing rutinose or sambubiose, which were excreted in the urine 
from black currant, elderberry, or Marion blackberry, were excreted as the 
intact molecule. The limited metabolism of these ACNs that did occur was via 
methylation. ACN monoglycosides other than the glucoside were metabolized via 
methylation and/or glucuronide formation. The monoglucuronide that formed 
represented a small proportion of the metabolites relative to the methylated or 
the mixed methylated and glucuronide forms of ACNs. The data clearly demonstrate 
that the aglycone and the sugar moieties can alter the apparent absorption and 
metabolism of ACNs.

Breviscapine, is the total flavonoid components (the content of scutellarin > or 
=85%) extracted from the dried whole plant of Erigeron breviscapus (VANT.) 
HAND.-MAZZ, and its preparations are generally used in the clinic for the 
treatment of cerebral and cardio-vascular diseases in China. In this paper, the 
metabolites of breviscapine in the urine of rats after oral administration were 
investigated. The ten metabolites were isolated by open-column chromatography 
and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography, and their structures 
were elucidated by MS, NMR spectroscopy including (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, and NOESY 
(nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy), enzymatic hydrolysis and chemical 
evidence. The ten metabolites were identified as 
scutellarein-6,7-di-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-1), scutellarein (M-2), 
6-O-methyl-scutellarin (M-3), 6-O-methyl-scutellarein (M-4), 
scutellarein-6-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-5), scutellarein-5-O-beta-D-glucuronide 
(M-6), scutellarin (M-7), scutellarein-7-O-sulfate (M-8), 
apigenin-5-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-9), and apigenin-4'-O-beta-D-glucuronide 
(M-10) respectively. The results of this study indicated that the metabolites of 
brevisvapine were excreted in rats urine as glucuronidated, sulfated or 
methylated forms, as well as the aglycone of scutellarin-scutellarein after oral 
administration, and the metabolic pathways were also proposed.

Canned and bottled tea drinks contain not only green tea epicatechins (GTE), 
namely (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECG), 
(-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and (-)-epicatechin (EC), but also four GTE epimers, 
namely (-)-gallocatechin gallate (GCG), (-)-catechin gallate (CG), 
(-)-gallocatechin (GC) and (-)-catechin (C). In the present study we examined 
the antioxidant activity and bioavailability of these epimers compared with 
their corresponding precursors. The epimerisation reaction was induced by 
autoclaving GTE extract derived from longjing green tea at 120 degrees C for 20 
min. Isolation and purification of each GTE and epimer were accomplished by 
various column chromatographic and semi-preparative HPLC techniques. The 
antioxidant activity of each epimer with its corresponding GTE precursor was 
conducted in the three in vitro systems, namely human LDL oxidation, ferric 
reducing-antioxidant power (FRAP), and anti-2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) 
free radical assays. The results of all three assays demonstrated that CG had 
similar antioxidant activity with its precursor ECG, while GC was less potent as 
an antioxidant than its precursor EGC. Regarding EGCG and GCG, the antioxidant 
potency was similar for both LDL oxidation and DPPH free radical assays, but GCG 
was statistically less effective than EGCG in the FRAP assay. For EC and C, the 
latter had less anti-free radical activity in the DPPH assay, but in LDL 
oxidation and FRAP assays the antioxidant activity was similar. Oral and 
intravenous dosing of GTE-epimer mixture led to increase in total plasma 
antioxidant capacity in rats. In general, both epicatechins and epimers had low 
bioavailability (0.08-0.31) and most of the observed differences between 
epicatechins and their corresponding epimers were small, even if they were 
statistically significant in some cases. It was concluded that the epimerisation 
reaction occurring in manufacturing canned and bottled tea drinks would not 
significantly affect antioxidant activity and bioavailability of total tea 
polyphenols.

The effects of soaking, boiling and steaming processes on the total phenolic 
components and antioxidant activity in commonly consumed cool season food 
legumes (CSFL's), including green pea, yellow pea, chickpea and lentil were 
investigated. As compared to original unprocessed legumes, all processing steps 
caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH free 
radical scavenging activity (DPPH) in all tested CSFL's. All soaking and 
atmospheric boiling treatments caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in oxygen 
radical absorbing capacity (ORAC). However, pressure boiling and pressure 
steaming caused significant (p<0.05) increases in ORAC values. Steaming 
treatments resulted in a greater retention of TPC, DPPH, and ORAC values in all 
tested CSFL's as compared to boiling treatments. To obtain cooked legumes with 
similar palatability and firmness, pressure boiling shortened processing time as 
compared to atmospheric boiling, resulted in insignificant differences in TPC, 
DPPH for green and yellow pea. However, TPC and DPPH in cooked lentils differed 
significantly between atmospheric and pressure boiling. As compared to 
atmospheric processes, pressure processes significantly increased ORAC values in 
both boiled and steamed CSFL's. Greater TPC, DPPH and ORAC values were detected 
in boiling water than that in soaking and steaming water. Boiling also caused 
more solid loss than steaming. Steam processing exhibited several advantages in 
retaining the integrity of the legume appearance and texture of the cooked 
product, shortening process time, and greater retention of antioxidant 
components and activities.

The effects of soaking, boiling, and steaming processes on the phenolic 
components and antioxidant activity of black beans were investigated. All 
processed beans exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) lower antioxidant activities 
than raw beans in total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH free radical scavenging 
activity (DPPH), and oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC). Steaming 
processes resulted in a greater retention of TPC and ORAC values than the 
boiling processes. Pressure boiling shortened processing time compared to 
regular boiling, resulted in insignificant differences in TPC, but significantly 
increased in ORAC as compared to the regular boiling method. Pressure steaming 
resulted in significant decreases in TPC, DPPH, while significantly increased in 
ORAC compared to regular steaming. Greater TPC, DPPH, and ORAC values were 
detected in boiling water than in the soaking and steaming water. Mass balance 
analysis showed that boiling caused more dry solid loss than steaming. All of 
these results indicated that processing methods significantly changed contents 
and activities of antioxidant components of black beans. Steam processing 
exhibited several advantages in appearance and texture of the cooked product, 
shortening processing time, and in greater retention of TPC and antioxidant 
activities. Steam processing may be used to develop high-quality 
health-promoting black bean products.

Potatoes in the diet contribute significantly to antioxidant daily intake 
worldwide. The influence of different domestic cooking conditions, boiling, 
microwaving, and baking, on total phenolics (TP), antioxidant capacity, phenolic 
composition, and tryptophan content was studied using eight commercial potato 
varieties. The antioxidant capacity was detected by the methods of oxygen 
radical absorbance capacity assay (ORAC) and the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 
free radical (DPPH(*)) assay. The phenolic composition and tryptophan content 
were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a 
diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), whereas phenolics and tryptophan were 
identified by means of HPLC-mass spectrometry, HPLC-DAD, and authentic 
standards. Antioxidant capacity was influenced by potato variety and cooking 
conditions; however, cooked potatoes retained 68-97% ORAC value depending on 
cooking procedure and variety. Chlorogenic acid and its isomers dominated the 
phenolic composition of each variety involved in this study. ORAC and TP were 
highly and positively correlated (r = 0.9119). Norkotah ranked highest in 
chlorogenic acid content and antioxidant value. Principal component analysis 
showed different cooking processes did not influence the trend of the 
antioxidant profile of the eight potato varieties, but specific compounds exert 
influence on the antioxidant capacity. The results imply that the potato 
varieties rich in antioxidant components could be good antioxidant sources as 
activities are not greatly affected by different cooking conditions.

Epidemiological studies have indicated that the consumption of fruits and 
vegetables is associated with a reduced risk for the development of chronic 
diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Phytochemicals, including 
phenolics and flavonoids, are suggested to be the major bioactive compounds 
contributing to the health benefits of fruits and vegetables. Onions are a major 
source of dietary flavonoids; however, there may exist varietal differences in 
composition, concentration, and beneficial activities. To characterize these 
differences, shallots and 10 onion (Allium cepa L.) varieties commonly available 
in the United States (Western Yellow, Northern Red, New York Bold, Western 
White, Peruvian Sweet, Empire Sweet, Mexico, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley Sweet, 
and Vidalia) were evaluated for total phenolic and flavonoid contents and 
antioxidant and antiproliferative activities. Shallots contained the highest 
total phenolic content (114.7 +/- 10.0 mg/100 g of sample) among the varieties 
tested, with a 6-fold difference observed when compared to the variety with the 
lowest phenolic content (Vidalia, p < 0.05). Western Yellow onion variety 
exhibited the highest total flavonoid content (69.2 +/- 3.7 mg/100 g of onion) 
of the varieties tested, with an 11-fold difference when compared to the variety 
with the lowest flavonoid content (Western White, p < 0.05). Shallots exhibited 
the highest total antioxidant activity (45.5 +/- 2.1 micromol of vitamin C 
equiv/g of onion), followed by Western Yellow, New York Bold, Northern Red, 
Mexico, Empire Sweet, Western White, Peruvian Sweet, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley 
Sweet, and Vidalia. For all varieties, both total phenolic and flavonoid 
contents were strongly correlated with total antioxidant activity (R (2) = 
0.9668, p < 0.05; and R (2) = 0.7033, p < 0.05, respectively). The proliferation 
of HepG(2) and Caco-2 cells was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent 
fashion after exposure to the Western Yellow, shallots, New York Bold, and 
Northern Red extracts, with Western Yellow, shallots, and New York Bold 
exhibiting the highest antiproliferative activity against HepG(2) cells and New 
York Bold and Western Yellow exhibiting the highest antiproliferative activity 
against Caco-2 cells. However, the varieties of Western White, Peruvian Sweet, 
Empire Sweet, Mexico, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley Sweet, and Vidalia 
demonstrated weak antiproliferative activity against both HepG(2) and Caco-2 
cells. These results may influence consumers toward purchasing onion varieties 
exhibiting greater potential health benefits and may significantly affect future 
breeding efforts to enhance onion nutritional qualities.

The impacts of conventional oven roasting at different temperatures and for 
different times on the physicochemical attributes of sesame seeds obtained from 
different regions was assessed. The color characteristics (a*, b*, and L* 
values), ash, moisture, protein, oil, total phenolic, and antioxidant activity 
of raw sesame seeds and the peroxide value, p-anisidine, fatty acids, and 
tocopherols of sesame oil varied with source. Oven roasting temperature and time 
significantly affected the physicochemical properties and bioactive components 
of sesame seeds and the oil quality from different countries. Roasting variably 
increased the a* value, antioxidant activity, protein, oil, total phenolic, and 
tocopherol content, and p-anisidine and peroxide values, whereas it reduced b* 
and L* values, moisture, and linolenic acid content of sesame seeds from 
different countries. Roasting conditions and growing locations affected the 
physiochemical composition and bioactive compounds of seeds. Such factors can 
influence the quality attributes of sesame seeds and oil and should be 
considered during processing.

Naringenin chalcone is the main active component of tomato skin extract, which 
has an antiallergic activity. In this study, naringenin chalcone was orally 
administered to rats, and the chemical structures and levels of the major 
metabolites in the plasma and urine of rats were determined. HPLC analysis 
indicated the presence of three major metabolites in the urine. LC-MS and NMR 
analyses tentatively identified these as naringenin 
chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide, naringenin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide, and 
naringenin-4'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Naringenin chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide 
was the only metabolite detected in the plasma, and its peak plasma level was 
observed 1 h after naringenin chalcone administration. Naringenin 
chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide also inhibited histamine release from rat 
peritoneal mast cells stimulated with compound 48/80. This activity might 
contribute to the antiallergic activity of naringenin chalcone in vivo. To the 
best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to report determination 
of naringenin chalcone metabolites in rat plasma and urine.

From red raspberries, ellagic acid, its 4-arabinoside, its 4' (4' '-acetyl) 
arabinoside, and its 4' (4' '-acetyl)xyloside, as well as quercetin and 
kaempferol 3-glucosides, were identified. In addition, two unidentified ellagic 
acid derivatives were detected. The free radical scavenging activity of the 
ellagic acid derivatives was evaluated by using the DPPH method and compared to 
that of Trolox. All of the isolated compounds showed antioxidant activity. The 
effect of processing to obtain jams on raspberry phenolics was evaluated. The 
flavonol content decreased slightly with processing and more markedly during 
storage of the jams. The ellagic acid derivatives, with the exception of ellagic 
acid itself, remained quite stable with processing and during 6 months of jam 
storage. The content of free ellagic acid increased 3-fold during the storage 
period. The initial content (10 mg/kg of fresh weight of raspberries) increased 
2-fold with processing, and it continued increasing up to 35 mg/kg after 1 month 
of storage of the jam. Then a slight decrease was observed until 6 months of 
storage had elapsed. The increase observed in ellagic acid could be explained by 
a release of ellagic acid from ellagitannins with the thermal treatment.

Polyphenol content, free radical scavenging capacity, and changes during storage 
over 7 months in the dark were studied in ecological and conventional red and 
white wines. In red wines, the most changeable components during storage were 
the anthocyanins since during storage anthocyanins content decreased 88% in 
conventional wine and 91% in ecological wine. Initially, the total flavonol 
contents of the conventional and ecological red wines were 163.88 +/- 2.69 and 
153.58 +/- 1.71 mg/L, respectively, and no significant variations occurred 
during storage. No differences in hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives content 
between conventional and ecological red and white wines were observed. The 
flavonol level in white wines was very low, as expected since these compounds 
are found in grape skin. The initial antioxidant activity was 5.37 +/- 0.14 and 
5.82 +/- 0.31 mM equivalents Trolox for conventional and ecological red wines, 
respectively; no significant differences were observed (p = 0.2831), and these 
values were 7-8 times higher than the antioxidant activity observed in 
conventional and ecological white wine. In contrast with other studies, the 
total concentrations of phenolic compounds in conventional and ecological red 
and white wines were not related to antioxidant activity (p > 0.05). In red 
wines, no significant differences were observed in the antioxidant activity of 
ecological and conventional red wine (p = 0.28), while in white wine significant 
differences were observed in the antioxidant activity between conventional and 
ecological white wine (p = 0.006).

BACKGROUND: Nutritional biomarkers may be better measures of dietary exposure 
than self-reported dietary data. We evaluated resveratrol metabolites, potential 
biomarkers of wine consumption, in humans after moderate consumption of 
sparkling, white, or red wines.
METHODS: We performed 2 randomized, crossover trials and a cohort study. In the 
first study, 10 healthy men consumed 30 g of ethanol/day as sparkling wine or 
gin for 28 days. In the second trial, 10 healthy women consumed 20 g of 
ethanol/day as white or red wine for 28 days. We also evaluated 52 participants 
in a study on the effects of a Mediterranean diet on primary prevention of 
cardiovascular disease (the PREDIMED Study). We used liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to analyze urinary total resveratrol 
metabolites (TRMs) and predictive values and ROC curve analyses to assess the 
diagnostic accuracy.
RESULTS: We observed significant increases in TRMs [72.4 (95% confidence 
interval, 48.5-96.2; P = 0.005), 211.5 (166.6-256.3; P = 0.005), and 560.5 
nmol/g creatinine (244.9-876.1; P = 0.005)] after consumption of sparkling, 
white, or red wine, respectively, but no changes after the washout or gin 
periods. In the cohort study, the reported daily dose of wine consumption 
correlated directly with TRMs (r = 0.654; P < 0.001). Using a cutoff of 90 
nmol/g, we were able to use TRMs to differentiate wine consumers from abstainers 
with a sensitivity of 72% (60%-84%); and a specificity of 94% (87%-100%).
CONCLUSIONS: Resveratrol metabolites in urine may be useful biomarkers of wine 
intake in epidemiologic and intervention studies.

The study was aimed at verification of the following hypothesis: differences in 
antioxidant capacity of diets consisting of different cereals and byproducts 
affect the antioxidant status of the consumers of these diets. To validate that 
hypothesis this study investigated the contents of polyphenols and 
alpha-tocopherol as well as the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in vitro of 
cereals and their fractions (barley, husked and naked oat, oat bran, and 
triticale); the nutritional and antioxidant properties of diets containing these 
cereals, applied in a 4-week feeding experiment on rats, were also assessed. 
Among the cereals examined, the highest TAC was reported for barley (13.16 
micromol of Trolox/g) and the lowest for naked oat (3.84 micromol of Trolox/g). 
Compared with cereals, the TAC of buckwheat waste was 2-3 times higher (25.2 
micromol of Trolox/g). The antioxidant capacity of diets, calculated in vitro, 
ranged from 6.35 micromol of Trolox/g for naked oat type diet to 10.51 micromol 
of Trolox/g for barley type diet. Results of an in vitro study were confirmed in 
changes of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and the level of 
thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in the serum of rats fed diets 
with the highest and lowest antioxidant capacities in vitro; the barley diet 
increased the activity of GPx (37.63 units/mL) and decreased the level of TBARS 
(4.82 microg/g), whereas the naked oat diet had an opposite effect (31.16 
units/mL and 5.91 microg/g, respectively).

The main flavonoids in grapefruit juice, naringin and narirutin, were quantified 
by LC-MS with structural differentiation by LC-MS/MS. After human consumption of 
grapefruit juice, urine samples were collected for 24 hours and screened for 
flavonoid metabolites by LC-MS. The metabolite structures (glucuronides, 
sulfates, and glucuronide sulfates) were then confirmed via their unique 
fragmentation patterns by LC-MS/MS. To further verify the identity of the common 
aglycon (naringenin) shared by the metabolites, enzymatic hydrolysis was 
performed and the resulting products were analyzed. This work demonstrates that 
LC-MS and LC-MS/MS techniques can be used for fast metabolite screening without 
extensive sample preparation.

This is a report about the identification of key metabolites of tectorigenin in 
rat urine using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization 
ion trap tandem mass spectrometric method (HPLC-ESI-MS(n)). Six healthy rats 
were administered a single dose (80 mg/kg) of tectorigenin by oral gavage. Urine 
was sampled for 0-24 h and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the 
supernatants, then the supernatants were purified by solid-phase extraction with 
a C(18) cartridge. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a 
reversed-phase C(18) column with a gradient elution program whereas 
acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid water was used as mobile phase. Mass spectra were 
acquired in negative ionization mode and a data-dependant scan was used for the 
identification of the key metabolites of tectorigenin in the urine samples. As a

Phenolic acids (PAs) have been shown to be beneficial to human health and are 
found most abundantly in corn bran ( approximately 4%, w/w), one of the main 
dietary fibers. This study therefore evaluated the bioavailabilities of phenolic 
antioxidants ferulic acid (FA) and p-coumaric acid (PCA) in refined corn bran 
(RCB) by determining their recovery in the plasma, urine, and feces of rats fed 
a single meal of a RCB diet containing 5% RCB or adapted to the RCB diet for 10 
days. In both studies, 0.4-0.5% of ingested FA and 1.2-2.3% of ingested PCA were 
recovered in rat urine. By contrast, approximately 81% of FA and approximately 
64% of PCA ingested with the single meal were excreted through the rat feces 
within 3 days after the ingestion. On the other hand, after rats were fed the 
RCB diet, total FA (all forms of FA) was recovered in plasma at a concentration 
of 35.0 +/- 2.0 microg/L, total FA and total PCA were excreted through urine at 
levels of 155.4 +/- 5.8 and 50.9 +/- 6.6 microg/day, respectively. These 
parameters showed no significant change (P = 0.93, 0.09, and 0.66, respectively) 
after rats were fed the RCB diet continuously for up to 10 days. These results 
suggest that the PAs in RCB are bioavailable in rats. Their bioavailabilities, 
however, are relatively low compared with their high content in RCB and not 
improved by the adaptation for 10 days to the enriched RCB diet. Additionally, 
comparison with the results of other studies revealed that high contents of FA 
and, especially, diferulic acids in cereal bran, which act as cross-links 
between bran cell wall polysaccharides, may not improve but, rather, limit the 
bioavailabilities of PAs in vivo.

Plant lignans occur in many foods, with flaxseed presently recognized as the 
richest source. Some plant lignans can be converted by intestinal microbiota to 
the mammalian lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, which may have protective 
effects against hormone-related diseases such as breast cancer. This study 
determined whether plant lignans in sesame seed, particularly sesamin, could be 
metabolized to the mammalian lignans. The total plant lignan concentration in 
sesame seed (2180 micromol/100 g) was higher than that in flaxseed (820 
micromol/100 g). In vitro fermentation with human fecal inoculum showed 
conversion of sesamin to the mammalian lignans, although at a lower rate (1.1%) 
compared with that of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (57.2%). However, when 
fed to female Sprague-Dawley rats for 10 d, sesamin (15 mg/kg body weight) and a 
10% sesame seed diet resulted in greater (P < 0.05) urinary mammalian lignan 
excretion (3.2 and 11.2 micromol/d, respectively), than the control (< 0.05 
micromol/d). We conclude that sesame seed is a rich source of mammalian lignan 
precursors and sesamin is one of them. From intermediate metabolites of sesamin 
identified in rat urine by GC-MS, a tentative metabolic pathway of sesamin to 
mammalian lignans is suggested.

The antioxidant activity of phenolics in fruits of blueberry (Vaccinium 
corymbosum cv. Sierra), cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon cv. Ben Lear), wild 
chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa), and lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea cv. 
Amberland) was determined in this study. The phenolic constituents and contents 
among the different berries varied considerably. Anthocyanins were found to be 
the main components in all these berries. Chlorogenic acid in blueberry, 
quercetin glycosides in cranberry and lingonberry, and caffeic acid and its 
derivative in chokeberry were also present in relatively high concentrations. 
Chlorogenic acid, peonidin 3-galactoside, cyanidin 3-galactoside, and cyanidin 
3-galactoside were the most important antioxidants in blueberry, cranberry, wild 
chokeberry, and lingonberry, respectively. The contribution of individual 
phenolics to the total antioxidant capacity was generally dependent on their 
structure and content in the berries. Phenolics such as quercetin and cyanidin, 
with 3',4'-dihydroxy substituents in the B ring and conjugation between the A 
and B rings, had highly effective radical scavenging structures in blueberries, 
cranberries, chokeberries, and lingonberries. Phenolic acids such as caffeic 
acid also showed high antioxidant activity, probably due to its dihydroxylation 
in the 3,4 positions as hydrogen donors.

The purpose of this study was to examine the antioxidant properties of water and 
80% methanolic extracts of cereal grains and their different morphological 
fractions. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. Almari and cv. Henika, barley 
(Hordeum vulgare L.) cv. Gregor and cv. Mobek, rye (Secale cereale L.) cv. 
Dańkowskie Zlote, oat (Avena sativa L.) cv. Slawko and buckwheat (Fagopyrum 
esculentum Moench) cv. Kora were used. PC (L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine) liposome 
system and spectrophotometric assay of total antioxidant activity (TAA) were 
used to evaluate the antioxidative activity of extracts. Among the water 
extracts, only the one prepared from buckwheat exhibited antioxidant activity at 
the concentration analyzed. The following hierarchy of antioxidant activity was 
provided for 80% methanolic extracts originated from whole grain: buckwheat > 
barley > oat > wheat congruent with rye. The antioxidant activity was observed 
in extract prepared from separated parts of buckwheat and barley. In respect to 
hulls, the antioxidant hierarchy was as follows: buckwheat > oat > barley. The 
correlation coefficient between total phenolic compounds and total antioxidative 
activity of the extracts was -0.35 for water extracts and 0.96, 0.99, 0.80, and 
0.99 for 80% methanolic extracts originated from whole grains, hulls, pericarb 
with testa fractions and endosperm with embryo fractions, respectively.

The seeds of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench L.) were dehulled and then, 
following milling, extruded on a counter rotating, twin-screw extruder with the 
different barrel temperature profiles: 120, 160, and 200 degrees C. After 
extrusion cooking process, the following compounds were analyzed: free and 
conjugated phenolic acids, total polyphenols (TPC), tocopherols (T) and 
tocotrienols (T3), inositol phosphates (IP), reduced glutathione (GSH), and 
melatonin (MLT). The antioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase-like activity 
(SOD-like activity) were determined in the groats and extrudates. Extrusion 
caused a significant decrease in all the compounds tested, except for phenolic 
acids. The content of IP decreased by 13%, that of GSH by 42%, and that of T + 
T3 by 62%. A three-fold lower level of MLT and TPC was noted whereas the 
SOD-like activity disappeared when compared to the nonextruded material. A 
two-fold higher content of phenolic acids (free and released from ester bonds) 
was observed. In spite of the clear decrease in the investigated antioxidants, 
the extruded dehulled buckwheat seeds contained still significant content of 
bioactive compounds, which resulted in as little as an average 10% decrease of 
the antioxidant capacity.

A GC-MS method is reported for separation and characterization of widely 
different amounts of benzoic and phenolic acids as their trimethylsilyl 
derivatives simultaneously in cranberry. Fifteen benzoic and phenolic acids 
(benzoic, o-hydroxybenzoic, cinnamic, m-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxybenzoic, 
p-hydroxyphenyl acetic, phthalic, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic, vanillic, 
o-hydroxycinnamic, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic, p-coumaric, ferulic, caffeic, and 
sinapic acid) were identified in cranberry fruit in their free and bound forms 
on the basis of GC retention times and simultaneously recorded mass spectra. 
Except for benzoic, p-coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, and sinapic acids, 10 other 
phenolic acids identified have not been reported in cranberry before. The 
quantitation of the identified components was based on total ion current (TIC). 
The experimental results indicated cranberry fruit contains a high content of 
benzoic and phenolic acids (5.7 g/kg fresh weight) with benzoic acid being the 
most abundant (4.7 g/kg fresh weight). The next most abundant are p-coumaric 
(0.25 g/kg fresh weight) and sinapic (0.21 g/kg fresh weight) acid. Benzoic and 
phenolic acids occur mainly in bound forms and only about 10% occurs as free 
acid.
