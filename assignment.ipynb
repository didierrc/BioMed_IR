Strawberry purees \nwere made from flesh, berry, and achene-enriched homogenate and contained 0, \n1.2, and 2.9% achenes, respectively. At production, strawberry purees made from \nflesh contained more anthocyanins, p-coumaroyl glycosides, and ascorbic acids, \nwhereas increasing achene levels caused increasing levels of ellagic acid \nderivatives, proanthocyanidins, flavonols, total phenolics (TP), and antioxidant \nactivities. In addition, the anthocyanins, TP, and ferric reducing ability power \n(FRAP) in purees with more achenes were better retained during storage. Ascorbic \nacids and anthocyanins declined rapidly during storage, whereas other \npolyphenols and antioxidant activities were more stable; that is, the \ncontributions from anthocyanins and ascorbic acids to TP and antioxidant \nactivities decreased. The findings that achenes contributed significantly to \npolyphenol content and stability of strawberry purees may be interesting in a \nnutritional and, thus, commercial, perspective.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf070467u\nPMID: 17550269 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

In the present study, a blue aleurone spring wheat line \"Purendo \n38\" with relatively high content of total anthocyanins was used to investigate \nthe composition and stability of anthocyanins over three crop years. Commercial \ncultivars of purple (Konini) and red (Katepwa) wheats were included in the \nstudy. Separation of anthocyanins by high-performance liquid chromatography \n(HPLC) showed that each wheat had a distinct anthocyanin profile. Four major \nanthocyanins were separated from blue wheat extracts as compared to five \nanthocyanins in purple wheat. Cyanidin 3-glucoside was the predominant \nanthocyanin in purple wheat, whereas it was the second major anthocyanin in blue \nwheat. The predominant anthocyanin in blue wheat, making up approximately 41% of \nthe total anthocyanin content, remains to be structurally unidentified. Blue \nwheat anthocyanins were thermally most stable at pH 1. Their degradation was \nslightly lower at pH 3 as compared to pH 5. Increasing the temperature from 65 \nto 95 degrees C increased degradation of blue wheat anthocyanins. Addition of \nSO(2) during heating of blue wheat had a stabilizing effect on anthocyanin \npigments. The optimal SO(2) concentrations were 500-1000 ppm for whole meals and \n1000-3000 ppm for isolated anthocyanins. Further studies are underway to \nidentify and verify individual anthocyanins in blue wheat and their potential \nend uses.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf021043x\nPMID: 12670152 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

We previously found that \ncertain diphenolic food components, lignans and isoflavonoids, which are \nconverted to biologically active hormone-like substances by intestinal \nmicroflora, may be cancer-protective agents. Therefore, we studied urinary \nexcretion of these compounds (enterolactone, enterodiol, daidzein, equol, and \nO-desmethylangolensin) in 10 women and 9 men in a rural village south of Kyoto, \nJapan. The subjects consumed a typical low-fat diet with much rice and soy \nproducts, fish, and vegetables. An isotope-dilution gas chromatographic-mass \nspectrometric method was used for the assays. The urinary excretion of lignans \nwas low but that of the isoflavonoids was very high. The excretion of \nisoflavonoids correlated with soybean-product intake. The low mortality in \nbreast and prostate cancer of Japanese women and men, respectively, may be due \nto the high intake of soybean products.\n\nDOI: 10.1093/ajcn/54.6.1093\nPMID: 1659780 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

This work evaluated the physicochemical properties, carbohydrate, and \nlipids profile, as well as nutraceutical properties of sorghum and maize \nvarieties used for obtaining popped grains. Proximate composition, carbohydrate \nprofiles, fatty acids, and phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity were \nevaluated. Sorghum and maize shared traits, but white sorghum had higher amylose \n(27%) while Palomero maize 2 had the lowest (18%). Sucrose accounted for 87% of \nthe low molecular weight carbohydrates (LMWC), followed by raffinose (up to 10%) \nand fructose (up to 7%). As for monomeric carbohydrates, maize contained more \nxylose and arabinose, while sorghum had a higher glucose content. The fatty acid \nprofile was similar among varieties, but maize show high contents of total, \nunsaturated, and saturated fatty acids. Conversely, red sorghum exhibited \nsignificantly higher levels of palmitoleic and cis-vaccenic acids compared to \nthe other varieties. Red sorghum showed the highest content of phenolic \ncompounds, including free and bound phenols, condensed and hydrolyzed tannins, \nflavonoids (bound), and antioxidant capacity (ABTS and DPPH). While Palomero \nmaize 2 exhibited a higher proportion of free flavonoids. These findings provide \nvaluable information for selecting and using these varieties in different \nagricultural and industrial sectors.\n\n© 2025.

Wheat is an important component of the human \ndiet; however, little is known about the phytochemical profiles and total \nantioxidant activities of milled fractions of different wheat varieties. The \nobjectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of phytochemicals \n(total phenolics, flavonoids, ferulic acid, and carotenoids) and to determine \nhydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity in milled fractions (endosperm \nand bran/germ) of three different wheat varieties, two of which were grown in \ntwo environments. Grain samples of each of the wheat varieties were milled into \nendosperm and bran/germ fractions. Each fraction was extracted and analyzed for \ntotal phenolics, ferulic acid, flavonoids, carotenoid contents, and hydrophilic \nand lipophilic antioxidant activities. Total phenolic content of bran/germ \nfractions (2867-3120 micromol of gallic acid equiv/100 g) was 15-18-fold higher \n(p < 0.01) than that of respective endosperm fractions. Ferulic acid content \nranged from 1005 to 1130 micromol/100 g in bran/germ fractions and from 15 to 21 \nmicromol/100 g in the endosperm fractions. The bran/germ fraction flavonoid \ncontent was 740-940 micromol of catechin equiv/100 g. On average, bran/germ \nfractions of wheat had 4-fold more lutein, 12-fold more zeaxanthin, and 2-fold \nmore beta-cryptoxanthin than the endosperm fractions. Hydrophilic antioxidant \nactivity of bran/germ samples (7.1-16.4 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g) was \n13-27-fold higher than that of the respective endosperm samples. Similarly, \nlipophilic antioxidant activity was 28-89-fold higher in the bran/germ fractions \n(1785-4669 nmol of vitamin E equiv/g). Hydrophilic antioxidant activity \ncontribution to the total antioxidant activity (hydrophilic + lipophilic) was \n>80%. In whole-wheat flour, the bran/germ fraction contributed 83% of the total \nphenolic content, 79% of the total flavonoid content, 51% of the total lutein, \n78% of the total zeaxanthin, 42% of the total beta-cryptoxanthin, 85% of the \ntotal hydrophilic antioxidant activity, and 94% of the total lipophilic \nantioxidant activity. Our results showed that different milled fractions of \nwheat have different profiles of both hydrophilic and lipophilic phytochemicals. \nThese findings provide information necessary for evaluating contributions to \ngood health and disease prevention from whole-wheat consumption.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf048456d\nPMID: 15769171 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

A high number of scientific data have demonstrated that it \nexerts a variety of beneficial effects on human health due to its peculiar \nchemical composition including fatty acids (98-99%) and other active compounds \neven if found in a very low percentage (1-2%). Among them, minor polar compounds \n(MCPs), represented mainly by phenolic compounds, are relevant for their healthy \nproperties, as stated by the European Food Safety Authority's (EFSA) claims. In \nthis paper, we described the results obtained from a pilot in vivo study, \nfocused for the first time on the evaluation of the possible beneficial effects \nof two EVOOs on chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients after the consumption of \n40 mL per day for 9 weeks. The selected EVOOs, traced in the production chain, \nand characterized by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC-DAD-MS) \nanalysis, resulted rich in MCPs and satisfied the EFSA's claim for their content \nof hydroxytyrosol and derivatives. The results obtained by this in vivo study \nappear to highlight the potential beneficial role in CKD patients of these EVOOs \nand are promising for future studies.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/molecules25204757\nPMCID: PMC7587576\nPMID: 33081292 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest."

All results are expressed as mean value +/- standard deviation \n(n = 3) on a fresh weight basis. Fresh date varieties were found to be a good \nsource of antioxidants (11687-20604 micromol of Trolox equiv/g), total contents \nof anthocyanins (0.24-1.52 mg of cyanidin 3-glucoside equiv/100 g), carotenoids \n(1.31-3.03 mg/100 g), phenolics (134-280 mg of ferulic acid equiv/100 g), free \nphenolic acids (2.61-12.27 mg/100 g), and bound phenolic acids (6.84-30.25 \nmg/100 g). A significant (p < 0.05) amount of antioxidants and carotenoids was \nlost after sun-drying of dates, whereas the total content of phenolics and free \nand bound phenolic acids increased significantly (p < 0.05). Anthocyanins were \ndetected only in fresh dates. Date varieties had different levels and patterns \nof phenolic acids. Four free phenolic acids (protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, \nsyringic acid, and ferulic acid) and nine bound phenolic acids (gallic acid, \nprotocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, \nsyringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and o-coumaric acid) were \ntentatively identified. Of the date varieties studied, Khalas, which is \nconsidered to be premium quality, had higher antioxidant activity, total \ncarotenoids, and bound phenolic acids than other varieties. These results \nsuggest that all date varieties serve as a good source of natural antioxidants \nand could potentially be considered as a functional food or functional food \ningredient, although some of their antioxidant constituents are lost during \nsun-drying.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf050579q\nPMID: 16159191 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Box 21, 41470 \nGebze-Kocaeli, Turkey. cesarettin.alasalvar@mam.gov.tr\n\nThe effect of roasting on taste-active components of 18 native hazelnut \nvarieties, grown in the Giresun province of Turkey, was assessed. Samples were \nexamined for their sugars, organic acids, condensed tannins, and free phenolic \nacids. Six sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose, myo-inositol, raffinose, and \nstachyose), seven organic acids (oxalic, maleic, citric, malic, lactic, \nsuccinic, and acetic), and one phenolic acid (gallic acid) were positively \nidentified in natural and roasted hazelnut varieties; among these, sucrose, \nmalic acid, and gallic acid predominated, respectively. Total sugars among \nhazelnut varieties ranged from 1.99 to 4.94 g/100 g, organic acids from 0.96 to \n2.72 g/100 g, condensed tannins from 3.99 to 40.56 mg of catechin equivalents/g, \nand gallic acid from 0.159 to 0.871 mg/100 g. Differences existed in the sugar \nand organic acid contents between natural and roasted hazelnut varieties, but \nthey did not follow any particular trend. Significant losses (p < 0.05) in \ncondensed tannins ( approximately 97.3%) and gallic acid ( approximately 66.7%) \nwere noted when the hazelnuts were roasted. The present work suggests that \nroasting resulted in significant loss in condensed tannins and gallic acid due \nto the removal of the brown skin. The effect of roasting on sugars and organic \nacids was not noteworthy.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf101039f\nPMID: 20681657 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Epub 2006\n Oct 18.\n\nPharmacokinetics of the citrus flavanone aglycones hesperetin and naringenin \nafter single oral administration in human subjects.\n\nKanaze FI(1), Bounartzi MI, Georgarakis M, Niopas I.\n\nAuthor information:\n(1)Department of Pharmacy, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, \nGreece.\n\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hesperetin and naringenin, the aglycones of the \nflavanone glycosides hesperidin and naringin, occur naturally in citrus fruits. \nThey exert interesting pharmacological properties such as antioxidant, \nanti-inflammatory, blood lipid and cholesterol lowering and are considered to \ncontribute to health benefits in humans. However, no information is available on \nthe pharmacokinetics of the citrus flavanones hesperetin and naringenin after \ntheir oral administration to humans as pure aglycones. Therefore, the objective \nof the present investigation was the evaluation of the pharmacokinetic \nparameters of hesperetin and naringenin in plasma and urine, after their single \noral administration in humans in the form of solid dispersion capsules, and also \nto improve the absorption rate of flavanones by using aglycones rather than the \nnaturally occurring glycosides.\nDESIGN: Six healthy volunteers received orally 135 mg of each compound, \nhesperetin and naringenin, under fasting conditions. Blood samples were \ncollected at 14 different time points over a 12 h period. Urine was collected \nover 24 h, in five sequential timed intervals. Plasma and urine hesperetin and \nnaringenin concentrations, after enzymatic hydrolysis of their conjugated forms, \nwere measured using validated high-pressure liquid chromatography methods. \nPharmacokinetic parameters for hesperetin and naringenin, such as C(max), \nT(max), AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity), CL/F, V/F, t(1/2), MRT, A(e), A(e)((0-24)), \nand R(max) were calculated from their plasma or urine concentrations.\nRESULTS: Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that both hesperetin and naringenin \nwere rapidly absorbed and their concentrations in plasma observed 20 min after \ndosing and reached a peak in 4.0 and 3.5 h, respectively. The mean peak plasma \nconcentration (C(max)) for hesperetin and naringenin were 825.78+/-410.63 ng/ml \n(2731.8+/-1358.4 nmol/l) and 2009.51+/-770.82 ng/ml (7386.6+/-2833.4 nmol/l), \nrespectively and the mean AUC(0-infinity) values were 4846.20+/-1675.99 ng h/ml \nand 9424.52+/-2960.52 ng h/ml for hesperetin and naringenin, respectively. The \nelimination half-life for hesperetin was found to be 3.05+/-0.91 h and for \nnaringenin 2.31+/-0.40 h, respectively. The mean values of the relative \ncumulative urinary excretion, as percentage of the administered dose, for \nhesperetin and naringenin, were found to be 3.26+/-0.44 and 5.81+/-0.81%, \nrespectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of the flavanone aglycones, hesperetin and \nnaringenin, lead to their rapid absorption as their conjugated forms. The \ncumulative urinary recovery data indicated low bioavailability for both \nflavanone aglycones, owing to extensive first-pass metabolism partly by cleavage \nof the C-ring by the enzymes of intestinal bacteria leading to degradation \nproducts such as phenolic acids.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602543\nPMID: 17047689 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Sulfite was found to be the only compound that was able to delay the \nformation of radicals, whereas phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids, \ncatechin, epicatechin, and proanthocyanidin dimers had no effect on the \nformation of radicals. Ascorbate, cystein, and cysteamin were on the other hand \nfound to be prooxidants. It is suggested that antioxidants must be able to \neither scavenge peroxides or trap metal ions in order to be effective in beer. \nThe effectiveness of sulfite is suggested to be a consequence of its \ntwo-electron nonradical producing reaction with peroxides.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf000354+\nPMID: 10956077 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Int J Vitam Nutr Res. 2003 Mar;73(2):152-9. doi: 10.1024/0300-9831.73.2.152.\n\nInfluence of cooking process on phenolic marker compounds of vegetables.\n\nAndlauer W(1), Stumpf C, Hubert M, Rings A, Fürst P.\n\nAuthor information:\n(1)Institute for Biological Chemistry & Nutrition, University of Hohenheim, \nD-70593 Stuttgart, Germany. Wilfried.Andlauer@hevs.ch\n\nPhenolic compounds are secondary plant metabolites which have long been \nassociated with flavor and color characteristics of fruits and vegetables. These \nphenolic compounds attract great interest due to their postulated health \nprotecting properties. However, adequate intakes and absorption rate of phenolic \ncompounds are necessary for these beneficial effects. Until now, little is known \nabout alterations of phenolic compounds content by the cooking process. In the \npresent study, the influence of different volumes of cooking water on the amount \nof selected phenolic marker compounds resting in the vegetables was assessed. In \nzucchini, rutin was quantified as a marker for flavonoid glycosides. Chlorogenic \nacid, representative of phenolic acids was analyzed in carrots. In beans, rutin \nand quercitrin, both belonging to flavonoid glycosides, were investigated. In \npotatoes, chlorogenic and caffeic acid were determined. The cooking of zucchini, \nbeans and carrots with smaller amounts of water resulted in significant higher \ncontent of phenolic phytochemicals in the vegetables compared to cooking with \nlarger water volumes. For potatoes, which showed great variations in content of \nphenolic acids after cooking, no significant differences in phenolic acids was \nobserved. It can be concluded from these observations, that real intakes of \nphenolic compounds from cooked vegetables are lower and that the amounts \nconsumed are therefore overestimated.\n\nDOI: 10.1024/0300-9831.73.2.152\nPMID: 12747223 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Epub 2014\n Dec 30.\n\nSoluble and cell wall-bound phenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers in rye \nflour and five bread model systems: insight into mechanisms of improved \navailability.\n\nDynkowska WM(1), Cyran MR, Ceglińska A.\n\nAuthor information:\n(1)Department of Plant Biochemistry and Physiology, Plant Breeding and \nAcclimatization Institute - National Research Institute, Radzikow, PL-05-870, \nBlonie, Poland.\n\nBACKGROUND: The bread-making process influences bread components, including \nphenolics that significantly contribute to its antioxidant properties. Five \nbread model systems made from different rye cultivars were investigated to \ncompare their impact on concentration of ethanol-soluble (free and ester-bound) \nand insoluble phenolics.\nRESULTS: Breads produced by a straight dough method without acid addition (A) \nand three-stage sourdough method with 12 h native starter preparation (C) \nexhibited the highest, genotype-dependent concentrations of free phenolic acids. \nDough acidification by direct acid addition (method B) or by gradual production \nduring prolonged starter fermentation (24 and 48 h, for methods D and E) \nconsiderably decreased their level. However, breads B were enriched in soluble \nester-bound fraction. Both direct methods, despite substantial differences in \ndough pH, caused a similar increase in the amount of insoluble ester-bound \nfraction. The contents of phenolic fractions in rye bread were positively \nrelated to activity level of feruloyl esterase and negatively to those of \narabinoxylan-hydrolysing enzymes in wholemeal flour.\nCONCLUSION: The solubility of rye bread phenolics may be enhanced by application \nof a suitable bread-making procedure with respect to rye cultivar, as the \nmechanisms of this process are also governed by a response of an individual \ngenotype with specific biochemical profile.\n\n© 2014 The Authors.

Joan XXIII s/n, Barcelona 08028, Spain.\n\nMajor brands of cocoa powder products present in the Spanish market were \nanalyzed for monomeric flavanols [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] and \nflavonols [quercetin-3-glucuronide, quercetin-3-glucoside (isoquercitrin), \nquercetin-3-arabinoside, and quercetin]. In addition, the influence of the \nmanufacturing process of cocoa powder products, in particular, the \nalkalinization treatment ( Dutching), on the original content of these \nflavonoids has been studied. (-)-Epicatechin was in the range of 116.02-730.26 \nmicrog/g, whereas (+)-catechin was in the range of 81.40-447.62 microg/g in the \ncommercial cocoa products studied. Among flavonols, quercetin-3-arabinoside and \nisoquercitrin were the major flavonols in the cocoa powder products studied, \nranging from 2.10 to 40.33 microg/g and from 3.97 to 42.74 microg/g, \nrespectively, followed by quercetin-3-glucuronide (0.13-9.88 microg/g) and \nquercetin aglycone (0.28-3.25 microg/g). To our knowledge, these results are the \nfirst quantitative data in relation to the content of individualized flavonol \nderivatives in commercial cocoa powder products. The alkalinization treatment \nresulted in 60% loss of the mean total flavonoid content. Among flavanols, \n(-)-epicatechin presented a larger decline (67%, as a mean percentage \ndifference) than (+)-catechin (38%), probably because of its epimerization into \n(-)-catechin, a less bioavailable form of catechin. A decline was also confirmed \nfor di-, tri-, and tetrameric procyanidins. In the case of flavonols, quercetin \npresented the highest loss (86%), whereas quercetin-3-glucuronide, \nquercetin-3-arabinoside, and isoquercitrin showed a similar decrease (58, 62, \nand 61%, respectively). It is concluded that the large decrease found in the \nflavonoid content of natural cocoa powder, together with the observed change in \nthe monomeric flavanol profile that results from the alkalinization treatment, \ncould affect the antioxidant properties and the polyphenol biovailability of \ncocoa powder products.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf0728754\nPMID: 18412367 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Strawberry purees \nwere made from flesh, berry, and achene-enriched homogenate and contained 0, \n1.2, and 2.9% achenes, respectively. At production, strawberry purees made from \nflesh contained more anthocyanins, p-coumaroyl glycosides, and ascorbic acids, \nwhereas increasing achene levels caused increasing levels of ellagic acid \nderivatives, proanthocyanidins, flavonols, total phenolics (TP), and antioxidant \nactivities. In addition, the anthocyanins, TP, and ferric reducing ability power \n(FRAP) in purees with more achenes were better retained during storage. Ascorbic \nacids and anthocyanins declined rapidly during storage, whereas other \npolyphenols and antioxidant activities were more stable; that is, the \ncontributions from anthocyanins and ascorbic acids to TP and antioxidant \nactivities decreased. The findings that achenes contributed significantly to \npolyphenol content and stability of strawberry purees may be interesting in a \nnutritional and, thus, commercial, perspective.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf070467u\nPMID: 17550269 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

In the present study, a blue aleurone spring wheat line \"Purendo \n38\" with relatively high content of total anthocyanins was used to investigate \nthe composition and stability of anthocyanins over three crop years. Commercial \ncultivars of purple (Konini) and red (Katepwa) wheats were included in the \nstudy. Separation of anthocyanins by high-performance liquid chromatography \n(HPLC) showed that each wheat had a distinct anthocyanin profile. Four major \nanthocyanins were separated from blue wheat extracts as compared to five \nanthocyanins in purple wheat. Cyanidin 3-glucoside was the predominant \nanthocyanin in purple wheat, whereas it was the second major anthocyanin in blue \nwheat. The predominant anthocyanin in blue wheat, making up approximately 41% of \nthe total anthocyanin content, remains to be structurally unidentified. Blue \nwheat anthocyanins were thermally most stable at pH 1. Their degradation was \nslightly lower at pH 3 as compared to pH 5. Increasing the temperature from 65 \nto 95 degrees C increased degradation of blue wheat anthocyanins. Addition of \nSO(2) during heating of blue wheat had a stabilizing effect on anthocyanin \npigments. The optimal SO(2) concentrations were 500-1000 ppm for whole meals and \n1000-3000 ppm for isolated anthocyanins. Further studies are underway to \nidentify and verify individual anthocyanins in blue wheat and their potential \nend uses.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf021043x\nPMID: 12670152 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

We previously found that \ncertain diphenolic food components, lignans and isoflavonoids, which are \nconverted to biologically active hormone-like substances by intestinal \nmicroflora, may be cancer-protective agents. Therefore, we studied urinary \nexcretion of these compounds (enterolactone, enterodiol, daidzein, equol, and \nO-desmethylangolensin) in 10 women and 9 men in a rural village south of Kyoto, \nJapan. The subjects consumed a typical low-fat diet with much rice and soy \nproducts, fish, and vegetables. An isotope-dilution gas chromatographic-mass \nspectrometric method was used for the assays. The urinary excretion of lignans \nwas low but that of the isoflavonoids was very high. The excretion of \nisoflavonoids correlated with soybean-product intake. The low mortality in \nbreast and prostate cancer of Japanese women and men, respectively, may be due \nto the high intake of soybean products.\n\nDOI: 10.1093/ajcn/54.6.1093\nPMID: 1659780 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

This work evaluated the physicochemical properties, carbohydrate, and \nlipids profile, as well as nutraceutical properties of sorghum and maize \nvarieties used for obtaining popped grains. Proximate composition, carbohydrate \nprofiles, fatty acids, and phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity were \nevaluated. Sorghum and maize shared traits, but white sorghum had higher amylose \n(27%) while Palomero maize 2 had the lowest (18%). Sucrose accounted for 87% of \nthe low molecular weight carbohydrates (LMWC), followed by raffinose (up to 10%) \nand fructose (up to 7%). As for monomeric carbohydrates, maize contained more \nxylose and arabinose, while sorghum had a higher glucose content. The fatty acid \nprofile was similar among varieties, but maize show high contents of total, \nunsaturated, and saturated fatty acids. Conversely, red sorghum exhibited \nsignificantly higher levels of palmitoleic and cis-vaccenic acids compared to \nthe other varieties. Red sorghum showed the highest content of phenolic \ncompounds, including free and bound phenols, condensed and hydrolyzed tannins, \nflavonoids (bound), and antioxidant capacity (ABTS and DPPH). While Palomero \nmaize 2 exhibited a higher proportion of free flavonoids. These findings provide \nvaluable information for selecting and using these varieties in different \nagricultural and industrial sectors.\n\n© 2025.

Wheat is an important component of the human \ndiet; however, little is known about the phytochemical profiles and total \nantioxidant activities of milled fractions of different wheat varieties. The \nobjectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of phytochemicals \n(total phenolics, flavonoids, ferulic acid, and carotenoids) and to determine \nhydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity in milled fractions (endosperm \nand bran/germ) of three different wheat varieties, two of which were grown in \ntwo environments. Grain samples of each of the wheat varieties were milled into \nendosperm and bran/germ fractions. Each fraction was extracted and analyzed for \ntotal phenolics, ferulic acid, flavonoids, carotenoid contents, and hydrophilic \nand lipophilic antioxidant activities. Total phenolic content of bran/germ \nfractions (2867-3120 micromol of gallic acid equiv/100 g) was 15-18-fold higher \n(p < 0.01) than that of respective endosperm fractions. Ferulic acid content \nranged from 1005 to 1130 micromol/100 g in bran/germ fractions and from 15 to 21 \nmicromol/100 g in the endosperm fractions. The bran/germ fraction flavonoid \ncontent was 740-940 micromol of catechin equiv/100 g. On average, bran/germ \nfractions of wheat had 4-fold more lutein, 12-fold more zeaxanthin, and 2-fold \nmore beta-cryptoxanthin than the endosperm fractions. Hydrophilic antioxidant \nactivity of bran/germ samples (7.1-16.4 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g) was \n13-27-fold higher than that of the respective endosperm samples. Similarly, \nlipophilic antioxidant activity was 28-89-fold higher in the bran/germ fractions \n(1785-4669 nmol of vitamin E equiv/g). Hydrophilic antioxidant activity \ncontribution to the total antioxidant activity (hydrophilic + lipophilic) was \n>80%. In whole-wheat flour, the bran/germ fraction contributed 83% of the total \nphenolic content, 79% of the total flavonoid content, 51% of the total lutein, \n78% of the total zeaxanthin, 42% of the total beta-cryptoxanthin, 85% of the \ntotal hydrophilic antioxidant activity, and 94% of the total lipophilic \nantioxidant activity. Our results showed that different milled fractions of \nwheat have different profiles of both hydrophilic and lipophilic phytochemicals. \nThese findings provide information necessary for evaluating contributions to \ngood health and disease prevention from whole-wheat consumption.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf048456d\nPMID: 15769171 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

During the industrial process, catechins and \nprocyanidins, flavonols, flavones, and flavanones decreased, while \nhydroxybenzoic compounds exhibited an important increase. In addition, raw \nlentils showed high values of the antioxidant activity (66.97 μmol Trolox/g); \nalthough the thermal processing promotes decreased, the levels of antioxidant \nactivity were still relevant. Thus, the significant occurrence of bioactive \nphenolic compounds along with the interesting antioxidant capacity of dehydrated \nlentil flours make them useful for daily inclusion in the human diet as \nready-to-use for special meals to specific populations.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf102222t\nPMID: 20735138 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

All results are expressed as mean value +/- standard deviation \n(n = 3) on a fresh weight basis. Fresh date varieties were found to be a good \nsource of antioxidants (11687-20604 micromol of Trolox equiv/g), total contents \nof anthocyanins (0.24-1.52 mg of cyanidin 3-glucoside equiv/100 g), carotenoids \n(1.31-3.03 mg/100 g), phenolics (134-280 mg of ferulic acid equiv/100 g), free \nphenolic acids (2.61-12.27 mg/100 g), and bound phenolic acids (6.84-30.25 \nmg/100 g). A significant (p < 0.05) amount of antioxidants and carotenoids was \nlost after sun-drying of dates, whereas the total content of phenolics and free \nand bound phenolic acids increased significantly (p < 0.05). Anthocyanins were \ndetected only in fresh dates. Date varieties had different levels and patterns \nof phenolic acids. Four free phenolic acids (protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, \nsyringic acid, and ferulic acid) and nine bound phenolic acids (gallic acid, \nprotocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, \nsyringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and o-coumaric acid) were \ntentatively identified. Of the date varieties studied, Khalas, which is \nconsidered to be premium quality, had higher antioxidant activity, total \ncarotenoids, and bound phenolic acids than other varieties. These results \nsuggest that all date varieties serve as a good source of natural antioxidants \nand could potentially be considered as a functional food or functional food \ningredient, although some of their antioxidant constituents are lost during \nsun-drying.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf050579q\nPMID: 16159191 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Box 21, 41470 \nGebze-Kocaeli, Turkey. cesarettin.alasalvar@mam.gov.tr\n\nThe effect of roasting on taste-active components of 18 native hazelnut \nvarieties, grown in the Giresun province of Turkey, was assessed. Samples were \nexamined for their sugars, organic acids, condensed tannins, and free phenolic \nacids. Six sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose, myo-inositol, raffinose, and \nstachyose), seven organic acids (oxalic, maleic, citric, malic, lactic, \nsuccinic, and acetic), and one phenolic acid (gallic acid) were positively \nidentified in natural and roasted hazelnut varieties; among these, sucrose, \nmalic acid, and gallic acid predominated, respectively. Total sugars among \nhazelnut varieties ranged from 1.99 to 4.94 g/100 g, organic acids from 0.96 to \n2.72 g/100 g, condensed tannins from 3.99 to 40.56 mg of catechin equivalents/g, \nand gallic acid from 0.159 to 0.871 mg/100 g. Differences existed in the sugar \nand organic acid contents between natural and roasted hazelnut varieties, but \nthey did not follow any particular trend. Significant losses (p < 0.05) in \ncondensed tannins ( approximately 97.3%) and gallic acid ( approximately 66.7%) \nwere noted when the hazelnuts were roasted. The present work suggests that \nroasting resulted in significant loss in condensed tannins and gallic acid due \nto the removal of the brown skin. The effect of roasting on sugars and organic \nacids was not noteworthy.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf101039f\nPMID: 20681657 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Epub 2006\n Oct 18.\n\nPharmacokinetics of the citrus flavanone aglycones hesperetin and naringenin \nafter single oral administration in human subjects.\n\nKanaze FI(1), Bounartzi MI, Georgarakis M, Niopas I.\n\nAuthor information:\n(1)Department of Pharmacy, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, \nGreece.\n\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hesperetin and naringenin, the aglycones of the \nflavanone glycosides hesperidin and naringin, occur naturally in citrus fruits. \nThey exert interesting pharmacological properties such as antioxidant, \nanti-inflammatory, blood lipid and cholesterol lowering and are considered to \ncontribute to health benefits in humans. However, no information is available on \nthe pharmacokinetics of the citrus flavanones hesperetin and naringenin after \ntheir oral administration to humans as pure aglycones. Therefore, the objective \nof the present investigation was the evaluation of the pharmacokinetic \nparameters of hesperetin and naringenin in plasma and urine, after their single \noral administration in humans in the form of solid dispersion capsules, and also \nto improve the absorption rate of flavanones by using aglycones rather than the \nnaturally occurring glycosides.\nDESIGN: Six healthy volunteers received orally 135 mg of each compound, \nhesperetin and naringenin, under fasting conditions. Blood samples were \ncollected at 14 different time points over a 12 h period. Urine was collected \nover 24 h, in five sequential timed intervals. Plasma and urine hesperetin and \nnaringenin concentrations, after enzymatic hydrolysis of their conjugated forms, \nwere measured using validated high-pressure liquid chromatography methods. \nPharmacokinetic parameters for hesperetin and naringenin, such as C(max), \nT(max), AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity), CL/F, V/F, t(1/2), MRT, A(e), A(e)((0-24)), \nand R(max) were calculated from their plasma or urine concentrations.\nRESULTS: Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that both hesperetin and naringenin \nwere rapidly absorbed and their concentrations in plasma observed 20 min after \ndosing and reached a peak in 4.0 and 3.5 h, respectively. The mean peak plasma \nconcentration (C(max)) for hesperetin and naringenin were 825.78+/-410.63 ng/ml \n(2731.8+/-1358.4 nmol/l) and 2009.51+/-770.82 ng/ml (7386.6+/-2833.4 nmol/l), \nrespectively and the mean AUC(0-infinity) values were 4846.20+/-1675.99 ng h/ml \nand 9424.52+/-2960.52 ng h/ml for hesperetin and naringenin, respectively. The \nelimination half-life for hesperetin was found to be 3.05+/-0.91 h and for \nnaringenin 2.31+/-0.40 h, respectively. The mean values of the relative \ncumulative urinary excretion, as percentage of the administered dose, for \nhesperetin and naringenin, were found to be 3.26+/-0.44 and 5.81+/-0.81%, \nrespectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of the flavanone aglycones, hesperetin and \nnaringenin, lead to their rapid absorption as their conjugated forms. The \ncumulative urinary recovery data indicated low bioavailability for both \nflavanone aglycones, owing to extensive first-pass metabolism partly by cleavage \nof the C-ring by the enzymes of intestinal bacteria leading to degradation \nproducts such as phenolic acids.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602543\nPMID: 17047689 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

HS-SPME coupled with GC-MS \nand HPLC techniques were employed to study the evolution of the volatile \ncompounds and the individual anthocyanins, respectively. The volatile aroma \ncomposition changes produced by the freezing process and long-term frozen \nstorage were minimal. Only a significant increase in extraction capacity was \nobtained for alpha-ionone (27%) and for caryophyllene (67%) in Heritage at 12 \nmonths of storage. The stability of anthocyanins to freezing and frozen storage \ndepends on the seasonal period of harvest. Heritage and Autumn Bliss (early \ncultivars) were less affected by processing and long-term frozen storage (1 \nyear), and the total pigment extracted showed the tendency to increase 17 and \n5%, respectively. Rubi and Zeva (late cultivars) suffered a decreased trend on \nthe total anthocyanin content of 4% for Rubi and 17.5% for Zeva. Cyanidin \n3-glucoside most easily suffered the degradative reactions that take place \nduring processing and the storage period.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf990747c\nPMID: 10725166 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Sulfite was found to be the only compound that was able to delay the \nformation of radicals, whereas phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids, \ncatechin, epicatechin, and proanthocyanidin dimers had no effect on the \nformation of radicals. Ascorbate, cystein, and cysteamin were on the other hand \nfound to be prooxidants. It is suggested that antioxidants must be able to \neither scavenge peroxides or trap metal ions in order to be effective in beer. \nThe effectiveness of sulfite is suggested to be a consequence of its \ntwo-electron nonradical producing reaction with peroxides.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf000354+\nPMID: 10956077 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Wilfried.Andlauer@hevs.ch\n\nPhenolic compounds are secondary plant metabolites which have long been \nassociated with flavor and color characteristics of fruits and vegetables. These \nphenolic compounds attract great interest due to their postulated health \nprotecting properties. However, adequate intakes and absorption rate of phenolic \ncompounds are necessary for these beneficial effects. Until now, little is known \nabout alterations of phenolic compounds content by the cooking process. In the \npresent study, the influence of different volumes of cooking water on the amount \nof selected phenolic marker compounds resting in the vegetables was assessed. In \nzucchini, rutin was quantified as a marker for flavonoid glycosides. Chlorogenic \nacid, representative of phenolic acids was analyzed in carrots. In beans, rutin \nand quercitrin, both belonging to flavonoid glycosides, were investigated. In \npotatoes, chlorogenic and caffeic acid were determined. The cooking of zucchini, \nbeans and carrots with smaller amounts of water resulted in significant higher \ncontent of phenolic phytochemicals in the vegetables compared to cooking with \nlarger water volumes. For potatoes, which showed great variations in content of \nphenolic acids after cooking, no significant differences in phenolic acids was \nobserved. It can be concluded from these observations, that real intakes of \nphenolic compounds from cooked vegetables are lower and that the amounts \nconsumed are therefore overestimated.\n\nDOI: 10.1024/0300-9831.73.2.152\nPMID: 12747223 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Five \nbread model systems made from different rye cultivars were investigated to \ncompare their impact on concentration of ethanol-soluble (free and ester-bound) \nand insoluble phenolics.\nRESULTS: Breads produced by a straight dough method without acid addition (A) \nand three-stage sourdough method with 12 h native starter preparation (C) \nexhibited the highest, genotype-dependent concentrations of free phenolic acids. \nDough acidification by direct acid addition (method B) or by gradual production \nduring prolonged starter fermentation (24 and 48 h, for methods D and E) \nconsiderably decreased their level. However, breads B were enriched in soluble \nester-bound fraction. Both direct methods, despite substantial differences in \ndough pH, caused a similar increase in the amount of insoluble ester-bound \nfraction. The contents of phenolic fractions in rye bread were positively \nrelated to activity level of feruloyl esterase and negatively to those of \narabinoxylan-hydrolysing enzymes in wholemeal flour.\nCONCLUSION: The solubility of rye bread phenolics may be enhanced by application \nof a suitable bread-making procedure with respect to rye cultivar, as the \nmechanisms of this process are also governed by a response of an individual \ngenotype with specific biochemical profile.\n\n© 2014 The Authors.

Joan XXIII s/n, Barcelona 08028, Spain.\n\nMajor brands of cocoa powder products present in the Spanish market were \nanalyzed for monomeric flavanols [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] and \nflavonols [quercetin-3-glucuronide, quercetin-3-glucoside (isoquercitrin), \nquercetin-3-arabinoside, and quercetin]. In addition, the influence of the \nmanufacturing process of cocoa powder products, in particular, the \nalkalinization treatment ( Dutching), on the original content of these \nflavonoids has been studied. (-)-Epicatechin was in the range of 116.02-730.26 \nmicrog/g, whereas (+)-catechin was in the range of 81.40-447.62 microg/g in the \ncommercial cocoa products studied. Among flavonols, quercetin-3-arabinoside and \nisoquercitrin were the major flavonols in the cocoa powder products studied, \nranging from 2.10 to 40.33 microg/g and from 3.97 to 42.74 microg/g, \nrespectively, followed by quercetin-3-glucuronide (0.13-9.88 microg/g) and \nquercetin aglycone (0.28-3.25 microg/g). To our knowledge, these results are the \nfirst quantitative data in relation to the content of individualized flavonol \nderivatives in commercial cocoa powder products. The alkalinization treatment \nresulted in 60% loss of the mean total flavonoid content. Among flavanols, \n(-)-epicatechin presented a larger decline (67%, as a mean percentage \ndifference) than (+)-catechin (38%), probably because of its epimerization into \n(-)-catechin, a less bioavailable form of catechin. A decline was also confirmed \nfor di-, tri-, and tetrameric procyanidins. In the case of flavonols, quercetin \npresented the highest loss (86%), whereas quercetin-3-glucuronide, \nquercetin-3-arabinoside, and isoquercitrin showed a similar decrease (58, 62, \nand 61%, respectively). It is concluded that the large decrease found in the \nflavonoid content of natural cocoa powder, together with the observed change in \nthe monomeric flavanol profile that results from the alkalinization treatment, \ncould affect the antioxidant properties and the polyphenol biovailability of \ncocoa powder products.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf0728754\nPMID: 18412367 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Tissue levels of RES were studied after i.v. and \noral administration of trans-resveratrol (t-RES) to rabbits, rats, and mice. \nHalf-life of RES in plasma, after i.v. administration of 20 mg t-RES/kg b.wt., \nwas very short (e.g., 14.4 min in rabbits). The highest concentration of RES in \nplasma, either after i.v. or oral administration (e.g., 2.6 +/- 1.0 microM in \nmice 2.5 min after receiving 20 mg t-RES/kg orally), was reached within the \nfirst 5 min in all animals studied. Extravascular levels (brain, lung, liver, \nand kidney) of RES, which paralleled those in plasma, were always < 1 nmol/g \nfresh tissue. RES measured in plasma or tissues was in the trans form (at least \n99%). Hepatocytes metabolized t-RES in a dose-dependent fashion (e.g., 43 nmol \nof t-RES/g x min in the presence of 20 microM tRES), which means that the liver \ncan remove circulating RES very rapidly. In vitro B16 melanoma (B16M) cell \nproliferation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was inhibited by \nt-RES in a concentration-dependent fashion (100% inhibition of tumor growth was \nfound in the presence of 5 microM t-RES). Addition of 10 microM H(2)O(2) to B16M \ncells, cultured in the presence of 5 microM t-RES, reactivated cell growth. Oral \nadministration of t-RES (20 mg/kg twice per day; or included in the drinking \nwater at 23 mg/l) did not inhibit growth of B16M inoculated into the footpad of \nmice (solid growth). However, oral administration of t-RES (as above) decreased \nhepatic metastatic invasion of B16M cells inoculated intrasplenically. The \nantimetastatic mechanism involves a t-RES (1 microM)-induced inhibition of \nvascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in the hepatic sinusoidal \nendothelium (HSE), which consequently decreased in vitro B16M cell adhesion to \nthe endothelium via very late activation antigen 4 (VLA-4).\n\nDOI: 10.1016/s0891-5849(02)00911-5\nPMID: 12126761 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

The results of this study show that the \nvariety, growing environment, manufacturing conditions, and grade (particle \nsize) of the tea leaves each influence the tea leaf and final infusion \ncompositions. In addition, the composition of the tea infusion was shown to be \ninfluenced by whether the tea was contained in a teabag and, if so, the size and \nmaterial of construction of the bag. Finally, the preparation method, including \nthe amounts of tea and water used, infusion time, and amount of agitation, was \nshown to be a major determinant of the component concentrations of tea beverages \nas consumed. An illustration of the variation introduced by these product and \npreparation factors is provided by comparing solids, caffeine, and polyphenol \ncontents of green and black tea infusions when commercial products are prepared \naccording to the instructions given on their packaging.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf010759+\nPMID: 11714326 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Box \n10, 00016 Monterotondo Stazione, Rome, Italy.\n\nThe major flavanone-7-O-glycoside constituents in citrus fruit juices (naringin, \nhesperidin, neohesperidin, narirutin, and eriocitrin) were separated as \ndiastereomers by multidimensional liquid chromatography. The method consisted of \ncoupling two HPLC columns: a reversed-phase (RP(18)) column was used for the \nseparation of flavanone glycosides, which were, then, individually switched into \na carboxymethylated beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD)-based column and resolved as the \ncorresponding stereoisomers. The method was used for the full analysis of \nflavanone glycosides in fresh hand-squeezed and commercial fruit juices by \ncombining the quantitative estimation with the diastereomeric analysis. \nQuantitative data were in general consistent with previously reported data in \nthis field. CC-LC isomer analysis was carried out by coupling the beta-CD column \nwith a mass spectrometer operated with negative ion electrospray ionization \n(ESI-MS). The results showed that hesperidin was present in orange juices almost \nexclusively as the 2S isomer, whereas narirutin had mainly the 2R configuration. \nIn grapefruit juices (2S)-naringin prevailed with the respect to the 2R isomer, \nwhereas the opposite was true for narirutin. Lemon juices contained eriocitrin \nstereoisomers in equal amount (50% each), but hesperidin was almost exclusively \nfound as the 2S isomer. Significant differences of the diastereomeric ratios \nwere observed between freshly squeezed juices and juices from commercial \nsources.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf0400967\nPMID: 15315361 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Rats were orally administered 1 g cocoa \npowder/kg body weight, containing 7.80 mg EC, and their blood was collected \nbefore administration and at designated time intervals thereafter. The EC and \nits metabolites in plasma were treated with beta-glucuronidase and/or sulfatase, \nthen analysed by HPLC and by liquid chromatography-MS. Several EC-related \ncompounds were detected in plasma such as free EC, and glucuronide, sulfate, and \nglucuronide-sulfate conjugates of non-methylated or methylated EC. All EC \nmetabolites showed a maximum concentration in plasma at 30-60 min \npost-administration. Glucuronide conjugates of both non-methylated and \nmethylated EC were found in high concentration in plasma. Moreover, \nadministration of cocoa powder significantly reduced the accumulation of lipid \nperoxides in plasma and significantly reduced the consumption of \nalpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with \n2,2'-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH (25 mmol/l)) or CuSO(4) \n(100 micromol/l) compared with that in the case of plasma obtained before \nadministration. The total EC concentration in plasma was negatively correlated \nwith the level of accumulation of lipid peroxides in plasma oxidized by \ntreatment with AAPH (25 mmol/l) and was positively correlated with the level of \nresidual alpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with CuSO(4) (100 \nmicromol/l). These results indicate that EC in cocoa powder was absorbed from \nthe digestive tract, that various conjugated forms of EC were generated in the \ndigestive tract and distributed to the plasma, and that these enhanced the \nantioxidative activity of plasma.\n\nPMID: 11177180 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Previous studies have shown \nRA has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activity. However, little is known on \nthe absorption, metabolism, degradation and excretion of RA.\nAIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study in healthy humans was to determine the \nabsorption, metabolism, and urinary excretion of RA after a single intake of \nperilla extract (PE).\nMETHOD: Six healthy men (mean age 37.2 +/- 6.2 y and mean body mass index 22.0 \n+/- 1.9 kg/m(2)) were enrolled in the study that was a crossover design \ninvolving single intakes of PE containing 200 mg RA and placebo with a 10 day \ninterval between treatments. Blood samples were collected before intake and at \ndesignated time intervals, while urine samples were collected over the periods \n0-6 h, 6-24 h and 24-48 h after intake. RA and its related metabolites in plasma \nand urine were measured by LC-MS.\nRESULTS: RA, methylated RA (methyl-RA), caffeic acid (CAA), ferulic acid (FA) \nand a trace of m-coumaric acid (COA) were detected in the urine after intake of \nPE. In plasma, RA, methyl-RA and FA were detected, with maximum levels obtained \n0.5, 2 and 0.5 h after intake of PE, respectively. The majority of these \ncomponents in both plasma and urine were present as conjugated forms \n(glucuronide and/or sulfated). The proportion of RA and its related metabolites \nexcreted in the urine was 6.3 +/- 2.2% of the total dose, with approximately 75% \nof these components being excreted within 6 h after intake of PE.\nCONCLUSIONS: RA contained in PE was absorbed, conjugated and methylated \nfollowing intake, with a small proportion of RA being degraded into various \ncomponents, such as conjugated forms of CAA, FA and COA. These metabolites were \nthen rapidly excreted in the urine.\n\nDOI: 10.1007/s00394-004-0482-2\nPMID: 15309457 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Blood samples were collected before the study and 12 wk after intake of \nthe test drinks. Plasma lipids, LDL oxidative susceptibility, and urinary \noxidative stress markers were measured.\nRESULTS: At 12 wk, we measured a 9% prolongation from baseline levels in the lag \ntime of LDL oxidation in the cocoa group. This prolongation in the cocoa group \nwas significantly greater than the reduction measured in the control group \n(-13%). A significantly greater increase in plasma HDL cholesterol (24%) was \nobserved in the cocoa group than in the control group (5%). A negative \ncorrelation was observed between plasma concentrations of HDL cholesterol and \noxidized LDL. At 12 wk, there was a 24% reduction in dityrosine from baseline \nconcentrations in the cocoa group. This reduction in the cocoa group was \nsignificantly greater than the reduction in the control group (-1%).\nCONCLUSION: It is possible that increases in HDL-cholesterol concentrations may \ncontribute to the suppression of LDL oxidation and that polyphenolic substances \nderived from cocoa powder may contribute to an elevation in HDL cholesterol.\n\nDOI: 10.1093/ajcn/85.3.709\nPMID: 17344491 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Monitoring the \nergosterol content after 25 days of incubation indicated that fungal growth on \nall grain fractions was comparable. Trichothecene (TCT) production was highest \non degermed grain, less on whole grain, and very low or nondetectable on the \ngerm; similar results were found with four different strains. It was concluded \nthat inhibitor(s) of TCT biosynthesis were present in maize germ. The presence \nof phenolic compounds was investigated in the different fractions. The \nhydroxamate 4-acetylbenzoxazolin-2-one (4-ABOA), a known inhibitor of mycotoxin \nproduction, was found in the degermed and whole grain fractions but not in the \ngerm. Therefore, the TCT inhibition observed on the maize germ fraction used in \nour study is clearly not linked to 4-ABOA. Other soluble phenolic compounds were \nfound at a much higher concentration in the germ than in the two other \nfractions. The inhibition property of the soluble ester-bound extracts was \ntested in liquid culture. A possible role for these compounds is discussed.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf020957g\nPMID: 12696980 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

In \nparticular, several components present in EVOO, such as tocopherols, carotenoids \nand phenolic compounds, play an important protective role in mitigating \ninflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. \nThe protective effect exerted by EVOO was proposed to be accounted for by its \nantioxidant, anti-inflammatory or anti-proliferative properties. The present \nreview will focus on the interactions among EVOO's components and \npro-inflammatory cytokines, aiming to reveal the mechanisms potentially involved \nin the anticancer action of EVOO. Cancer patients very frequently develop a \ndevastating syndrome known as cachexia, which negatively impinges on their \noutcome. The main features of cachexia include progressive body weight loss, fat \nand muscle wasting, and dysmetabolism, all of which partially result from the \nonset of systemic inflammation. In this regard, the possibility that EVOO could \nbe beneficial to cancer patients by mitigating cachexia will be reviewed, \nfocusing on the skeletal muscle.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/nu17142334\nPMCID: PMC12299991\nPMID: 40732959 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: On behalf of all the authors, the corresponding \nauthor states that there are no conflicts of interest.

         "1. Toxicol Sci. 2001 Aug;62(2):205-11. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/62.2.205.\n\nDisposition and biotransformation of the estrogenic isoflavone daidzein in rats.\n\nBayer T(1), Colnot T, Dekant W.\n\nAuthor information:\n(1)Institut für Toxikologie, Universität Würzburg, Versbacher Str. 9, 97078 \nWürzburg, Germany.\n\nDaidzein is an estrogenic isoflavone present in many plants and therefore \nconsumed in relatively high doses by humans. Daidzein has a low affinity for the \nestrogen receptor (3 orders of magnitude lower than estradiol) and has been \ndemonstrated to have estrogenic effects in rodents after administration of high \ndoses. We have studied the disposition and biotransformation of daidzein in rats \nfed a diet low in isoflavone content. Four male and four female Fischer 344 rats \nwere orally administered 100 mg/kg daidzein; excreted urine and feces were \ncollected for 96 h and unchanged daidzein as well as formed metabolites were \nquantified by HPLC. In urine of male rats, daidzein, daidzein-glucuronide, and \ndaidzein-sulfate were excreted; in females, only unchanged daidzein and \ndaidzein-glucuronide were present. Total urinary excretion of daidzein accounted \nfor < 10% of dose in both males and females. The major pathway of daidzein \nelimination was excretion of unchanged daidzein with feces. Reductive \ndaidzein-metabolites likely formed by intestinal microflora (equol, \nO-desmethylangolensin) were excreted with feces in small amounts (< 5% of dose). \nExcretion of daidzein and metabolites with urine and feces was rapid with \nelimination half-lives of less than 12 h; daidzein concentrations in urine and \nfeces were below the limit of detection 36 h after daidzein administration. The \nresults suggest that daidzein is only poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal \ntract in rodents. Absorbed daidzein is rapidly eliminated both unchanged and as \nconjugates with urine. The inefficient absorption of daidzein from the \ngastrointestinal tract and the rapid excretion may explain the weak \nestrogenicity of daidzein seen in vivo in rodents when compared to other \nestrogenic chemicals with comparatively low affinity to the estrogen receptor.\n\nDOI: 10.1093/toxsci/62.2.205\nPMID: 11452132 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

Samples were analyzed by GC-MS/MS prior to and after \nenzymatic treatment. A solid phase extraction sample pretreatment step with \ngreater than 80% analytical recoveries for all compounds was performed followed \nby a derivatization reaction prior to GC-MS/MS analysis. The calibration curves \nwere linear for all compounds studied for a dynamic range between 1 and 500 ng. \nThe limit of detection was in the mid picogram level for tyrosol and elenolic \nacid (300 pg) and in the low picogram level for hydroxytyrosol (2.5 pg).

Biomed Chromatogr. 2010 May;24(5):506-15. doi: 10.1002/bmc.1319.\n\nSimultaneous quantification of oleuropein and its metabolites in rat plasma by \nliquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.\n\nBazoti FN(1), Gikas E, Tsarbopoulos A.\n\nAuthor information:\n(1)Department of Pharmacy, University of Patras, Panepistimiopolis, Rio, Greece.\n\nOleuropein (OE) is the cardinal bioactive compound derived from Olea europaea \nand possesses numerous beneficial properties for human health. However, despite \nthe plethora of analytical methods that have studied the biological fate of \nolive oil-derived bioactive compounds, no validated methodology has been \npublished to date for the simultaneous determination of OE, along with all its \nmajor metabolites. In this study, a liquid chromatography-electrospray \nionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS/MS) method has been developed and \nvalidated for the quantification of OE, simultaneously with its main metabolites \nhydroxytyrosol, 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid, \n4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methoxy-phenol or homovanillyl alcohol, \n2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid or homovanillic acid, and elenolic acid \nin rat plasma matrix. Samples were analyzed by LC-ESI MS/MS prior to and after \nenzymatic treatment. A solid-phase extraction step with high mean recovery for \nall compounds was performed as sample pretreatment. Calibration curves were \nlinear for all bioactive compounds over the range studied, while the method \nexhibited good accuracy, intra- and inter-day precision. The limit of detection \nwas in the picogram range (per milliliterof plasma) for HT and OE and in the \nnanogram range (per milliliter of plasma) for the other analytes, and the method \nwas simple and rapid. The developed methodology was successfully applied for the \nsimultaneous quantification of OE and its aforementioned metabolites in rat \nplasma samples, thus demonstrating its suitability for pharmacokinetics, as well \nas bioavailability and metabolism studies.\n\n2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/bmc.1319\nPMID: 19795379 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

This method was especially suited \nto the direct analysis of beer samples and to analysis of acetone extracts of \nbarley samples, and was capable of determining proanthocyanidins and catechins \nat levels of 0.1-5.0 mg l-1. The use of dual-channel electrochemical detection \nalso enabled unambiguous peak identification by measurement of collection \nefficiencies. This method offered improved sensitivity and selectivity compared \nwith ultraviolet detection, and sample preparation procedures were greatly \nsimplified. The method was applied to the comparison of stabilized and \nunstabilized lagers, and to the analysis of different barley varieties grown in \nIreland.\n\nDOI: 10.1039/an9941900863\nPMID: 8067536 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

To address these needs, a 6-week \nvirtual program called Inspire Now was developed, integrating yoga, education, \nand group support. The primary objective of this mixed-methods observational \nstudy was to evaluate the program's impact on quality of life (QOL). Secondary \nobjectives included changes in participant-identified concerns, participants' \nqualitative experiences, and acceptability of virtual delivery.\nMETHODS: Eligible participants included people with primary lung cancer enrolled \nin the program. Questionnaires were administered at baseline and program \ncompletion. QOL and patient-identified concerns were evaluated by within-person \nchanges in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung (FACT-L) and Measure \nYourself Concerns and Wellbeing (MYCaW). Qualitative experiences and feasibility \nof virtual delivery were obtained by MYCaW and an internally developed \nquestionnaire. FACT-L and MYCaW were analyzed using paired t-tests, and \nqualitative data was evaluated by an inductive thematic analysis.\nRESULTS: Forty-five participants were enrolled and 31 were eligible for \nanalysis. Most were female (87%), had stage IV disease (68%), and were on active \ntreatment (74%). Significant improvements were observed in FACT-General and Lung \nscores (mean changes: +6.1, 95% CI 2.2- 10.0, P = .003; +5.9, 95% CI 1.1-10.7, \nP = .02, respectively). MYCaW concerns and overall wellbeing were significantly \nimproved. Participants viewed the virtual format favorably. Emotional support \nand connection were the most valued aspects of the program.\nCONCLUSIONS: A 6-week virtual program of yoga, education, and group support \nimproved QOL, patient-specific concerns, and wellbeing for those with lung \ncancer.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/15347354251385246\nPMID: 41174974 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe authors \ndeclared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, \nauthorship, and/or publication of this article."

The hypothesized relations were explored using structural equation \nmodeling via the bootstrapping approach. The study methods were compliant with \nthe STROBE checklist.\nRESULTS: Nearly half (42.51%, n = 190) of the participants experienced financial \ntoxicity. Negative emotions were negatively associated with perceived social \nsupport (r = -0.13) and negatively associated with financial toxicity scores (r \n= -0.50) (Note: COST is a reverse scoring scale, lower COST scores illustrate \nsevere financial toxicity). Perceived social support was positively correlated \nwith financial toxicity scores (r = 0.26). Financial toxicity scores negatively \npredicted negative emotions (β = -0.504). Social support and financial toxicity \ncould explain 25.3% of the variance in patients' negative emotions. Social \nsupport positively predicted financial toxicity (β = 0.257) and explained 6.60% \nof the variance in financial toxicity. Furthermore, financial toxicity \ncompletely mediated the association between perceived social support and \nnegative emotions (b = -0.124; 95% confidence interval: -0.182, -0.086).\nCONCLUSION: The high prevalence of financial toxicity demonstrates its crucial \nrole in patient outcomes. Our findings reveal that social support indirectly \ninfluences negative emotions through financial toxicity, establishing a clear \npathway linking psychosocial and financial aspects of cancer care. These results \nsuggest that integrated interventions targeting both financial burden and social \nsupport networks may be particularly effective in improving psychological \noutcomes among lung cancer patients in China's high-middle income regions. \nFuture healthcare policies should prioritize comprehensive support systems that \naddress this complex interplay of socioeconomic and psychological factors.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

This review focuses on the signaling pathways \n(Hedgehog, Hippo, Notch, Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK/ERK pathways) that \nare implicated in the development of drug resistance mechanisms in CRC, such as \nDNA repair systems, tumor microenvironments, autophagy, metabolic reprogramming, \nevasion of apoptosis, and efflux pumps. Furthermore, recent advancements in \ntargeted and combinatorial diagnostic-therapeutic approaches are highlighted. \nThis review delineates the significance of signaling cascades and their clinical \nrelevance, offering novel perspectives on the formulation of therapeutic \nstrategies to mitigate drug resistance.

An \nalternative therapy involving natural products with least toxicity can show \npromising results in cancer therapeutics. A bioactive alkaloid Piperlongumine \n(PIP), found in our culinary spice, exhibits potential pharmacological \nrelevance, especially regarding its anticancer effects. This study is an \noriginal research work examining the anticancer efficacy of PIP and its related \nmolecular mechanisms in human colon cancer cells. The results revealed that PIP \ninduces selective cytotoxicity against colon cancer cells while inhibiting \nproliferation, migration and invasion. PIP also builds up reactive oxygen \nspecies (ROS) that increase the oxidative stress of the cells leading to \ndisruption of the mitochondrial membrane and loss of mitochondrial membrane \npotential. In addition, PIP induces cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase of the \ncell cycle and impedes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in colon cancer \ncells. Further, PIP-mediated elevated intracellular ROS induces DNA damage and \nactivates the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway in colon cancer cells. PIP \nalso reports an anti-tumorigenic effect on the multicellular tumor spheroids of \ncolon cancer cells. Collectively, these findings validate that PIP shows \npromising anticancer potential towards colon cancer cells and is a potential \ncandidate for use in combination with existing anticancer drugs.\n\n© 2025 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/biof.70050\nPMID: 41174888 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"

This phase 2 trial \nevaluated camrelizumab (anti-PD-1) combined with chemotherapy in locally \nadvanced immunomodulatory TNBC (CD8+ T-cell infiltration ≥ 10%). From October \n2022 to September 2023, 90 stage II-III TNBC patients were randomized to receive \nneoadjuvant chemotherapy ± camrelizumab (200 mg biweekly). The \ncamrelizumab-chemotherapy group (n = 45) achieved a pathological complete \nresponse (pCR) rate of 62.2% (95% CI:46.5-76.2%) versus 42.2% (27.7-57.8%) in \nthe chemotherapy-alone group (n = 45), with a 20.0% absolute increase (P = \n0.059). Grade ≥ 3 adverse events occurred in 88.9% (40/45) and 82.2% (37/45) of \npatients, respectively. Multi-omics analyses demonstrated significantly elevated \nCD8+T-cell infiltration in camrelizumab-treated pCR patients, alongside strong \ncorrelations between PD-L1 expression, stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes \n(sTILs), and CD8+ density. These results indicate that CD8-guided \nimmunochemotherapy with camrelizumab improves pCR rates in high tumor burden \nTNBC with manageable toxicity, supporting CD8+ T-cell levels as a predictive \nbiomarker for immunotherapy response.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Author(s).

Metabolic \nadaptation fuels this plasticity by supplying energy and molecular building \nblocks for growth. RUNX2, the master regulator of bone morphogenesis, is \nectopically expressed in epithelial cancer, promoting metastasis through \ntrans-differentiation processes like Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) \nand osteomimicry. By combining omics data with functional validation, we \ndemonstrated that RUNX2 drives cancer cell metabolic rewiring by repressing \nmitochondrial respiration while promoting anabolic processes. We showed that \nRUNX2 upregulates key genes of lipid biosynthesis by regulating and cooperating \nwith SREBP1. In vivo expression analysis in thyroid and breast cancer patients \nconfirmed that lipid metabolism and SREBF1 expression are associated with \nincreased metastatic potential and clinical aggressiveness.

Emerging evidence underscores the crucial interplay between \nregulated cell death (RCD) pathways and immune activation, particularly \nimmunogenic cell death (ICD). ICD refers to a specific form of regulated cell \ndeath in which tumor cells undergo death and release damage-associated molecular \npatterns (DAMPs) and other signaling molecules, thereby reshaping the tumor \nimmune microenvironment (TIME). While the canonical RCD pathways are \nwell-established, the inducers of ICD, the spatiotemporal regulation of TIME \ndynamics, and the functional states of immune cells remain incompletely \nunderstood. We thoroughly evaluated contemporary therapeutic approaches that \nexploit the mechanisms of RCD-driven immunomodulatory effects, including \nstrategies to potentiate ICD and amplify antitumor immune responses. The novelty \nof this review lies in its dual perspective: delineating how tumor-intrinsic \ndeath programs reprogram the tumor TIME and how immune-cell death directly \ndictates its polarization toward immunostimulatory versus immunosuppressive \nstates, ultimately shaping therapeutic outcomes. We analyzed in depth how \ndifferent forms of RCD shape antigen presentation, guide immune cell \ninfiltration, and affect checkpoint signaling, underscoring their dual potential \nto support or hinder antitumor responses. Furthermore, we summarized the current \nlandscape of ICD-inducing interventions, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, \noncolytic viruses, tumor vaccines, and nanotechnology-based platforms, \nunderscoring their potential to convert immunologically \"cold\" tumors into \"hot\" \nones and to synergize with immune checkpoint blockade. In addition, we \nhighlighted promising combination strategies aimed at directly modulating immune \ncell death pathways to sustain effector cell function and overcome exhaustion, \noffering novel insights for the development of next-generation precision \nimmunotherapies. By delineating the crosstalk between tumor/immune cell death \npathways, this study provides a roadmap for developing precise immunotherapies \nthat exploit RCD-TIME interactions to overcome treatment resistance.\n\n© 2025.

Early postoperative \nhyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) may enhance intraperitoneal \ncytotoxic exposure and improve recurrence control. We evaluated whether \nprophylactic HIPEC administered within one week of surgery improves outcomes in \npathologic T4 (pT4) CRC.\nMETHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study of consecutive \npatients with pathologically confirmed pT4 colorectal adenocarcinoma \n(2018-2022). Prophylactic HIPEC consisted of intraperitoneal 5-fluorouracil \n(650 mg/m2) perfused for 60 min at 43.0 ± 0.1 °C within one postoperative week. \nA 1:2 propensity score match yielded a balanced cohort (99 HIPEC; 198 \nnon-HIPEC). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS); secondary \nendpoints included overall survival (OS) and site-specific recurrence. \nRobustness of findings was examined with sensitivity analyses.\nRESULTS: Among 690 screened patients, 471 were eligible (155 HIPEC; 316 \nnon-HIPEC). In the matched cohort, Kaplan-Meier comparisons were not \nstatistically significant for DFS (log-rank p = 0.074) or OS (p = 0.460). In \nmultivariable Cox models, HIPEC was associated with improved DFS (hazard ratio \n[HR] = 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-0.88; p = 0.012) but not OS \n(HR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.41-1.24; p = 0.237). Peritoneal, hepatic, and pulmonary \nrecurrence rates were comparable between groups, while other-site recurrence was \nlower with HIPEC (5.1% in HIPEC and 13.1% in non-HIPEC; p = 0.032). Results were \ndirectionally consistent across sensitivity analyses.\nCONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic HIPEC delivered within one postoperative week was \nassociated with improved DFS, without an observed OS advantage over the study \ninterval, in patients with pT4 CRC. These data support selective use of early \npostoperative HIPEC as an adjunct to curative resection, with patient counseling \nfocused on anticipated gains in recurrence control and the current uncertainty \nregarding long-term survival.\n\n© 2025.

However, \npatients may develop resistance to treatment over time, and currently, there are \nno validated predictive biomarkers for this resistance. A differential analysis \nof the transcriptome and DNA methylome of colorectal cancer cell lines, \nclassified by their varying IC50 values for oxaliplatin, revealed that genes \nassociated with resistance were enriched for interferon regulatory factor \npathways. In contrast, sensitive genes showed enrichment for transcription, \namino acid metabolism, development, and binding motifs of c-MyC:Max, AP1 and \nothers. In univariate Cox's proportional hazard model analysis, it was found \nthat UBE2H expression is linked to shorter survival time in the TCGA dataset and \nwas further validated across five GEO datasets of colorectal cancer. The \ntranscription of UBE2H, along with its gene body methylation, and copy number \nvariation was found to be higher in resistant cell lines compared to sensitive \nones. Additionally, UBE2H levels were higher in cancer samples than in control \nsamples, while the promoter methylation is lower in cancer samples than in \ncontrol samples. In groups with high UBE2H, there was an increased infiltration \nof eight cell types, including CD8+ T cells and type 2 T helper cells. \nConversely, only T helper 17 cells showed reduced infiltration. Moreover, UBE2H \nexpression was positively correlated with checkpoint inhibitors, CTLA4 and \nPDCD1, along with immune regulatory genes, such as FOXP3, IL10, IGFB1, CD274, \nand LAG3, etc. Analysis of single cell RNA-sequencing data revealed that UBE2H \nexpression is elevated in undifferentiated and proliferative cells located at \nthe base of intestinal crypts in normal colon tissue. Our findings suggest that \nUBE2H could serve as a resistance marker to oxaliplatin, as it is associated \nwith methylation, the presence of proliferative and undifferentiated cancer \ncells, and immune exhaustion. The proposed analytical pipeline may also be \napplicable to other cancers and diseases.\n\n© 2025.

As an emerging hallmark of cancer, the contribution \nof circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) to this side-specific heterogeneity is \nunclear. By integrating single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses, this \nstudy shows that tumor cells in right-sided CRC exhibit significantly higher CRD \nscores and identifies the emergence of a NONO-positive tumor-cell subpopulation \n(NONO⁺ TC) as a key molecular feature of this phenotype. Spatial analysis \nfurther confirms that this NONO⁺ TC forms a tightly co-localized \nmicroenvironment with fibroblasts in situ. Notably, cell-cell communication \nanalyses indicate that NONO expression does not augment the signal-sending \ncapacity of tumor cells but instead reprograms them into highly efficient signal \nreceivers. These augmented incoming signals predominantly originate from the \nmore pro-tumorigenic myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblast (myCAF) \nsubtype, indicating that NONO⁺ TC are particularly sensitive to malignant \nstromal inputs. In conclusion, our study delineates the dual role of NONO as \nboth a circadian regulator and a pro-tumorigenic signaling hub. By enhancing \ntumor-cell reception of CAF-derived signals, NONO links CRD to the formation of \nNONO⁺ TC niches and a malignant microenvironment in right-sided CRC, providing \nnew mechanistic insight into the spatial heterogeneity of tumors.\n\n© 2025.

Given the rising global \nincidence of breast cancer, high recurrence/drug resistance rates in Luminal A \npatients, and limited research on ferroptosis in this subtype, we analyzed 421 \nLuminal A subtype breast cancer samples and 113 adjacent normal tissues from The \nCancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Differential expression analysis (log₂|fold \nchange|>1, p < 0.05) and univariate Cox regression for overall survival (OS) \nidentified 12 ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with \nprognostic value. Using Lasso-Cox regression (10-fold cross-validation to avoid \noverfitting), we further optimized these into a 9-gene prognostic model. \nUnivariate and multivariate Cox regression confirmed the model-derived risk \nscore as an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR = 3.896, 95% \nCI = 2.195-6.916, p < 0.001) in TCGA. External validation in the Molecular \nTaxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) cohort (584 \nLuminal A samples) demonstrated consistent prognostic performance (log-rank \np < 0.001), confirming the model's robustness. Functional enrichment analysis \nshowed these genes were enriched in ferroptosis-related pathways, including \n\"lipid biosynthetic process\"(Gene Ontology) and \"FoxO signaling pathway\" (Kyoto \nEncyclopedia of Genes and Genomes). Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis \nrevealed high-risk groups had increased infiltration of immunosuppressive cells \n(mast cells, neutrophils, regulatory T cells) and elevated type II interferon \nresponse, while low-risk groups had higher type I interferon response. \nSpearman's correlation analysis identified ENPP2 as a key mediator of immune \nescape, with a strong positive correlation with PD-1 (r = 0.46, p = 8.7e-24). \nThis 9-gene ferroptosis-related model provides a robust tool for OS prediction \nin Luminal A subtype breast cancer and highlights ENPP2 as a potential target \nfor combining ferroptosis inducers with immune checkpoint inhibitors-offering a \nnovel strategy for endocrine-resistant patients.\n\n© 2025.

After applying Propensity Score Matching (PSM), the matched cohort \nconsisted of 118 patients, with 59 individuals in each of the TRTG and RATG \ngroups. The study then compared the short-term and long-term outcomes between \nthese two groups.\nRESULTS: Post-matching, there were no significant baseline differences between \nthe groups. Surgery duration and anastomosis duration were both longer in the \nTRTG group than in the RATG group. However, TRTG was associated with \nsignificantly reduced intraoperative blood loss, shorter times to postoperative \nmobilization, flatus, and eating, decreased hospital stay, smaller incision \nsizes, and lower postoperative stress responses compared to RATG. The RATG group \nharvested a higher number of lymph nodes. No significant differences were \nobserved between the two groups regarding postoperative complications, proximal \nand distal margins, nerve invasion, vascular cancer thrombus, postoperative \ndrainage output, and hospitalization costs. The three-year overall survival and \ndisease-free survival rates were similar between both groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: TRTG offers a safer and more advantageous surgical option regarding \nshort-term outcomes compared to RATG and may be considered a preferable choice \nfor total gastrectomy.\n\n© 2025.

Despite advances in treatment, chemoresistance and associated \nmorbidity remain significant challenges. This study aims to elucidate the role \nof acetate-dependent acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) in ovarian cancer \nprogression under hypoxic conditions, identifying its potential as a therapeutic \ntarget.\nRESULTS: Immunohistochemistry revealed that ACSS2 was overexpressed and \npredominantly localized to the nucleus in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma \n(HGSOC) tissues, with significantly higher H-scores compared to low-grade and \nnormal tissues. Functional assays conducted on ovarian cancer cell lines (Skov-3 \nand PA-1) demonstrated that ACSS2 inhibition reduced proliferation, colony \nformation, and three-dimensional spheroid growth, with greater sensitivity \nobserved under hypoxic conditions. Migration and invasion assays further \nindicated that ACSS2 inhibition significantly impaired cellular motility and \ninvasiveness, particularly in hypoxia. Mechanistic studies, including Western \nblotting and RT-qPCR, showed that ACSS2 inhibition modulated the PI3K pathway \nand downregulated Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 2 (HIF-2) levels as well as \nHIF-2-responsive genes expression under hypoxic conditions. These findings \nhighlight the role of ACSS2 in metabolic adaptation, tumor progression, and its \npotential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in ovarian cancer.\nCONCLUSIONS: ACSS2 is a critical regulator of ovarian cancer growth and \ninvasiveness under hypoxic stress. Targeting ACSS2 may represent a promising \ntherapeutic strategy for managing ovarian cancer. Further studies are warranted \nto explore its clinical potential.\n\n© 2025.

Although HPV vaccination and \nscreening programs are available, public awareness remains limited. Social media \nplatforms have become major sources of health information; however, the quality \nof content varies considerably. This study assesses the quality, reliability, \nand dissemination patterns of cervical cancer-related videos on YouTube, \nBilibili, and TikTok, with a focus on how uploader characteristics influence \ninformation accuracy.\nMETHODS: On February 21, 2025, we retrieved the top 100 videos using the keyword \n\"cervical cancer\" on YouTube, and its Chinese equivalent \"\" on Bilibili and \nTikTok. Two independent reviewers evaluated video quality using the Global \nQuality Score (GQS), Video Information and Quality Index (VIQI), modified \nDISCERN (mDISCERN), and Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT). \nInter-rater agreement was assessed, and statistical analysis was performed using \nnon-parametric tests and Spearman correlation.\nRESULTS: A total of 84 YouTube videos, 82 Bilibili videos, and 91 TikTok videos \nwere included. TikTok videos showed significantly higher user engagement than \nthose on other platforms (p<0.001), but scored significantly lower in GQS, VIQI, \nmDISCERN, and PEMAT evaluations (p<0.001). Videos uploaded by professionals \nconsistently received higher quality scores than those from non-professionals. \n(p<0.001) Although TikTok had higher uploader activity, its content was largely \nbased on personal experiences, lacking scientific rigor and practical guidance. \nThe video quality on TikTok and Bilibili is negatively correlated with their \ninteractivity.\nCONCLUSIONS: The three platforms show distinct differences in how cervical \ncancer-related health information is disseminated. TikTok demonstrates superior \ndissemination and engagement performance, whereas YouTube provides higher \ncontent quality and credibility. These findings underscore the importance of \nleveraging each platform's strengths to promote evidence-based health \ncommunication.\n\n© 2025.

However, the mechanism is not well understood. The aim \nof this study was to investigate the characteristics of gene mutation in small \ncell lung cancer patients and the differences in HLA-I alleles between small \ncell lung cancer patients and healthy controls, and to explore the effects of \ngene mutations and specific HLA-I alleles on small-cell lung cancer from the \nperspective of immune regulation.\nMETHODS: Differences in HLA-I allele frequencies between the two groups were \nanalyzed in a case-control study. Genetic testing was performed using target \ngene capture and sequencing method. The association between small cell lung \ncancer, HLA-I alleles, and gene mutation was analyzed by statistical methods.\nRESULTS: The small cell lung cancer group showed significantly higher \nHLA-A*11:02 (p < 0.001, OR = 4.693, 95%CI = 1.737-12.677), B*40:01 (p = 0.020, \nOR = 1.916, 95%CI = 1.101-3.333), and B*55:02 (p = 0.037, OR = 2.565, \n95%CI = 1.027-6.408) and significantly lower B*44:03 (p = 0.015, OR = 0.196, \n95%CI = 0.046-0.843) and C*06:02 (p = 0.005, OR = 0.369, 95%CI = 0.178-0.765) \nthan the control group. Haplotype analysis results showed that \nHLA-A*11:01-B*51:01 (p = 0.044, OR = 3.433, 95%CI = 0.959-12.292), \nA*02:06-C*07:02 (p = 0.005, OR = 11.459, 95%CI = 1.331-98.689), A*11:01-C*07:02 \n(p = 0.007, OR = 3.040, 95%CI = 1.311-7.047), and B*46:01-C*01:02 (p = 0.048, \nOR = 2.310, 95%CI = 0.986-5.415) frequencies significantly increased and \nA*02:01-B*13:02 (p = 0.036, OR < 0.001, 95%CI = 0.000-0.918) and B*13:02-C*06:02 \n(p = 0.009, OR = 0.108, 95%CI = 0.014-0.810) frequency significantly decreased \nin small cell lung cancer patients. Three-locus haplotype analysis showed that \nthe differences between small cell lung cancer patients and controls were not \nstatistically significant.\nCONCLUSION: HLA-A*11:01, B*40:01, and B*55:02 may be the immune modulators \nassociated with susceptibility and HLA-B*44:03 and C*06:02 act as the immune \nmodulators associated with resistance of small cell lung cancer. Haplotypes \nHLA-A*11:01-B*51:01, A*02:06-C*07:02, A*11:01-C*07:02, and B*46:01-C*01:02 are \npositively associated with small cell lung cancer.

Patients were \ndivided into a training set (n = 196) and a validation set (n = 84) at a ratio \nof 7:3. Influencing factors were screened using univariate, Least Absolute \nShrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and multivariate logistic regression \nanalyses in the training set. A nomogram was constructed, and the predictive \nperformance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves \nand calibration curves. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the \nclinical value.\nRESULTS: The incidence of poor prognosis was comparable between training \n(43.88%) and validation set (34.52%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis \nidentified miR-1246, HMGB-1, A1AT, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and \nHelicobacter pylori infection as independent risk factors for poor prognosis \n(All P < 0.05). The nomogram demonstrated acceptable discriminative ability, \nwith AUC of 0.789 (95% CI: 0.701-0.877) in the training set and 0.735 (95% CI: \n0.638-0.835) in the validation set. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.625 \nand 0.841 for the training set, and 0.481 and 0.786 for the validation set, \nrespectively. Calibration curves indicated good agreement between predicted and \nobserved probabilities.\nCONCLUSION: The proposed prognostic model offers a practical tool for \nindividualized risk assessment post-ESD.

Multivariable \nanalysis revealed that D-dimer > 1.2 µg/mL independently predicted recurrent VTE \n(OR 3.501; 95% CI 1.012-12.112; P = 0.048), whereas cancer metastasis portended \nrecurrent stroke (OR 3.155; 95% CI 1.423-6.995; P = 0.005), and anticoagulant \ntherapy was associated with an increased bleeding risk (OR 9.458; 95% CI \n1.158-77.267; P = 0.036).\nCONCLUSIONS: In this Chinese cohort of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) \nand cancer, routine screening revealed venous thromboembolism (VTE) in roughly \none-fifth of participants at baseline, most of whom were asymptomatic. \nExploratory multivariable analyses indicated that cryptogenic stroke subtype and \nD-dimer > 1.2 µg/mL were associated with prevalent VTE, while \nD-dimer > 1.2 µg/mL also predicted recurrent VTE. These findings suggested that \nD-dimer guided VTE screening might be considered at the time of stroke \npresentation, even in the absence of symptoms. Cancer metastasis showed an \nassociation with recurrent stroke, whereas anticoagulant therapy was linked to a \nhigher bleeding risk.\n\n© 2025.

This \nstudy aims to comprehensively analyze magnesium homeostasis across 33 cancer \ntypes, exploring its role in tumorigenesis, immune regulation, and therapeutic \npotential. Key magnesium homeostasis-related genes (e.g., ANK3, CNNM2) were \nsignificantly downregulated in most tumors, correlating with improved prognosis. \nMagnesium homeostasis scores (MHS) were reduced in cancers and linked to lower \ntumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), immune \ndysfunction, and checkpoint gene expression. Single-cell sequencing revealed \nelevated MHS in CD8 + T cells, suggesting immune modulation roles.\nCONCLUSION: These findings highlight magnesium homeostasis as a regulator of \ntumor progression and immunity, with MHS serving as a prognostic biomarker. \nTargeting magnesium pathways may offer novel therapeutic strategies, warranting \nfurther clinical validation to advance personalized cancer therapies.\n\n© 2025.

Data from selected studies were \nextracted, including study design, data sources, outcome definitions, sample \nsize, predictive factors, model development, and performance indicators. The \nrisk of bias in prediction models was assessed using the Prediction model Risk \nOf Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) checklist.\nRESULTS: Fifty articles were included in this meta-analysis. Most studies used \nLogistic Regression (LR) to establish risk prediction models. The training \nmodel's overall c-statistic was 0.85 (95% CI (0.81-0.89)), whereas the \nvalidation model's overall c-statistic was 0.82 (95% CI (0.80-0.83)). The \noverall pooled accuracy rate for the training group model was 0.80 [95% CI \n(0.72-0.87)], and the overall accuracy rate for model validation was 0.71 [95% \nCI (0.61-0.79)]. Tumor size was the most common risk predictive factor. All \nstudies had a high risk of bias, primarily due to inappropriate data sources.\nCONCLUSION: Based on the results of the PROBAST analysis, it was determined that \nall of the studies were highly biased. Models with bigger samples, more \nstringent research methods, inclusion of multicenter samples, and external \nvalidations should be the focus of future studies.\n\n© 2025.

Our study explores Australian general practice \nstakeholders' current involvement in supporting organised CRC screening through \nthe National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) and their views of the \nfeasibility and applicability of evidence-based intervention components.\nMETHODS: A qualitative study was undertaken using focus groups (n = 12) with 45 \nparticipants that included General Practitioners (GPs), practice nurses, \npractice staff and program support staff from across Australia. The Consolidated \nFramework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used as a guiding framework for \ndeductive thematic content analysis.\nRESULTS: The findings indicated that proactive GP involvement in the NBCSP is \nchallenged by clinical information system limitations, time constraints, and \ncompeting priorities. Participants expressed a willingness to support CRC \nscreening activities, understood the effectiveness of screening, but placed \nlittle focus on using the NBCSP as the primary method of CRC screening. An \nintervention to increase NBCSP participation involving a risk assessment tool, \nelectronic reminder prompt, clinical information system and workflow \nenhancement, and education was viewed as feasible and applicable to practice if \nidentified implementation challenges in the inner setting and individuals CFIR \ndomains were addressed.\nCONCLUSIONS: General practice stakeholders acknowledge their potential for a \nmore enhanced role in supporting the NBCSP and contributing to reducing the \nimpact of CRC. A multi-component general practice-led intervention to promote an \nenhanced role was perceived as acceptable. To improve feasibility and \napplicability, the intervention needs to be integrated, straightforward, \ntime-efficient, and supported by incentives and a whole-of-practice approach.\n\n© 2025.

Their expression varies \nsignificantly across tissues and tumour types, reflecting the metabolic \nheterogeneity of cancers. Understanding these variations is critical for \ndeveloping targeted therapies, optimizing drug efficacy, and minimizing \ntoxicity. This study aimed to comprehensively profile CYP450 expression across \ncolorectal cancer (CRC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), breast \ncancer, and hepatic cancer models using proteomic techniques.\nMETHODS: We analysed various cancer models (cell lines, xenografts, and patient \ntissue biopsies) using gel electrophoresis coupled with liquid \nchromatography-mass spectrometry (GEL-LC-MS). Equal amounts of protein were \nseparated by gel electrophoresis, and the 45-65 kDa molecular weight range was \nanalysed on the Orbitrap Fusion Mass Spectrometer.\nRESULTS: Distinct CYP450 expression profiles were observed across cancer types. \nIn CRC, CYP2W1 and CYP2S1 were highly expressed, while CYP1B1 and CYP2W1 were \nprominent in HNSCC, highlighting their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic \ntargets. Breast cancer models predominantly expressed CYP2J2 and CYP2S1, whereas \nCYP3A and CYP2C subfamily members were enriched in hepatic cancer, underscoring \ntheir roles in xenobiotic metabolism and drug clearance.\nCONCLUSION: This study provides the first comprehensive semi-quantitative \nproteomic map of CYP450 isoforms across multiple cancer models. The findings \nreveal metabolic heterogeneity and identify clinically relevant targets, \noffering a foundation for future functional studies and personalized therapeutic \nstrategies.\n\n© 2025.

This study explores the \nanti-cancer nutraceutical potential of Eutrema japonicum-derived ELNs (EJ-ELNs) \nthrough immune modulation and tumor suppression. EJ-ELNs were isolated using \ndifferential ultracentrifugation, tangential flow filtration, and cushioned \nultracentrifugation, and characterized by transmission electron microscopy and \nnanoparticle tracking analysis. The isolated EJ-ELNs demonstrated excellent \ncolloidal stability, maintaining structural integrity under simulated \ngastrointestinal fluid, enzymatic degradation (DNase, RNase, Proteinase K) and \nacidic conditions (pH 2), and diverse storage conditions (25 °C, 4 °C, -80 °C, \nand lyophilization). In vitro, EJ-ELNs promoted dendritic cell (DC) maturation \nby upregulating surface molecules and enhancing the secretion of Th1-polarizing \ncytokine, while suppressing antigen uptake via MAPK and NF-κB pathways. These \nactivated DCs facilitated the differentiation of naïve T cells into \nIFN-γ-producing Th1 cells and promoted the activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. \nIn vivo, oral administration of EJ-ELNs restored DC function and expanded \npolyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells co-expressing CD107a, IFN-γ, IL-2, and \nTNF-α, ultimately leading to significant tumor suppression. Lipidomic and \nmetabolomic profiling identified ceramide, Hex1Cer, naringenin, and genistein as \nkey immunostimulatory constituents. These findings position EJ-ELNs as a novel \nanti-cancer nutraceutical candidate, offering a promising strategy for immune \nactivation and tumor suppression in functional food applications.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

While the root is \nthe most consumed part, the leaves, often discarded, are rich in nutrients and \nbioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds. These compounds have shown \nefficacy against cancer, including colorectal cancer, a leading cause of global \nmorbidity and mortality. However, for these compounds to be effective, they must \nremain bioavailable and bioactive after gastrointestinal digestion. This study \ninvestigated beet leaves' antioxidant capacity and anticancer effects on the \ncolorectal cancer cell line HCT116 after in vitro digestion. The digested beet \nleaf sample showed antioxidant capacity through in vitro tests (ORAC, ABTS, and \nDPPH) and also maintained DNA supercoil despite the presence of the oxidizing \nagent. There was a significant reduction in HCT116 cell's proliferation and \ncolony formation, with the number and size of colonies decreasing after \ntreatment with the digested material. Additionally, the digested material \nreduced the phosphorylation of S6, S6K1 and S6K2 proteins, which are important \neffectors in the mTOR pathway. Isolated apigenin significantly influenced S6 \nprotein activity, and while it did not reduce the number of colonies, it \ndecreased their size. Thus, this study confirms that beet greens retain their \nantioxidant capacity after gastrointestinal digestion and may have potential \nanticancer effects against colorectal cancer.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we found that HDAC4 is degraded \nby the proteasome in cancer cells with impaired DNA repair by homologous \nrecombination and after oxaliplatin (OXPT) treatment. Genetic screening \nidentified FBXW7 as the E3 ligase responsible for HDAC4 degradation. FBXW7 \nloss-of-function mutations are frequently found in patients with colorectal \ncancer (CRC) and were found associated with the development of resistance to \nOXPT. Forced degradation of Class IIa HDACs using a PROTAC-based compound \nrestored OXPT sensitivity in FBXW7-mutated CRC cells, patient-derived organoids \n(PDOs), and mice. Mechanistically, removal of HDAC4 in FBXW7-mutated CRC treated \nwith OXPT recreated an epigenetic state comparable to OXPT-sensitive cells. \nFurthermore, patient profiling based on the epigenetic state of the \nsuper-enhancers controlled by HDAC4 successfully identified a priori CRC \npatients resistant to platinum. This study supports HDAC4 as a key mediator of \noxaliplatin resistance in FBXW7-mutated CRC and highlights the remodeling of a \nwell-defined super-enhancer repertoire as part of the process of OXPT \nresensitization.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

Here, we present a novel approach, \nintegrative methylation mapping, which overcomes this, enabling identification \nof functionally relevant methylation-regulated genes in cancer.\nMETHODS: Comparison of genome-wide DNA methylation across multiple B-lymphocyte \nderived malignant/normal samples (total n = 995), enabled delineation of changes \nrelated to normal or cancer cell functions. Chromatin structure profiling \n(SeSAMe) analysis delineated different properties characterising the different \ncategories of methylation change and lentiviral based re-expression enabled \nfunctional assessment of identified candidate genes.\nRESULTS: This analysis determined that only 2-3% of DNA methylation changes in \nB-cell cancers are disease driven, with the overwhelming majority driven by \nnormal processes, predominantly proliferation. Methylation changes associated \nwith specific cancer or normal cell processes exhibited unique patterns of \nsequence context, chromatin structure and associated transcription factors. \nFurthermore, the low level of true disease-specific changes simplifies \nidentification of functionally relevant methylation changes, illustrated here by \nidentification and functional confirmation of SLC22A15 as a tumour suppressor in \nacute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\nCONCLUSIONS: This approach leads to a clearer understanding of the role of \naltered DNA methylation in haematological cancer, facilitates identification of \ncancer-relevant DNA methylation targeted genes and novel therapeutic targets.\n\n© 2025.

All patients received a molecular tumour board (MTB) \nrecommendation for GMT based on predefined druggable targets (DT). The main \nobjective was to identify clinicopathological variables associated with DT.\nRESULTS: Analysis included 340 tissue samples from 307 patients, 51% of samples \nwere newly biopsied. Valid results were generated in 84% (76% new, 92% archived; \nP < 0.01). DT were identified in 39% of the patients, with PI3K-AKT (26%) and \nHomologous Recombination (HR; 21%) pathways most frequently affected. Metastatic \ntissue, especially from mCRPC setting (P < 0.01), yielded higher GMT \nrecommendations than primary tissue (P = 0.03). HR-associated genes were linked \nwith shorter ADT-to-CRPC time (OR 3.77, 95%CI 1.62-10.32, P < 0.01). PI3K-AKT \nalterations were associated with metachronous metastatic disease (OR 0.48, 95%CI \n0.26-0.89, P = 0.021) and longer time to CRPC (OR 0.47, 95%CI 0.25-0.87, \nP = 0.017). No distinct variables predicted DT genotypes.\nCONCLUSION: Molecular tumour testing should preferably be done on metastatic \nmCRPC tissue. No combination of features could robustly identify druggable \ngenotypes; therefore, reflex molecular characterisation should be routine for \nevery mCRPC patient.\n\n© 2025.

The process to \ndevelop new anti-cancer drugs is long and arduous. Therefore, additional \nstrategies for drug development could involve drug repositioning, i.e., \nidentifying new uses for already approved medications that have been deemed \nexpendable in the oncologic treatment realm. Indeed, there are already drugs \nthat have proven that they are extendable into oncology and are now Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) approved for malignancies, though they were initially \ndeveloped for other conditions.\nRECENT FINDINGS: These drugs include: all-trans retinoic acid, first approved as \na topical agent for photo-aging, with dramatic activity in acute promyelocytic \nleukemia (APL); arsenic, a compound known for its use as a homicidal poison with \nremarkable activity in APL; thalidomide, a drug with a scandalous past as it was \ngiven to pregnant women and resulted in severe fetal limb deformities, which is \nnow approved for multiple myeloma; and the antibiotics amoxicillin, \nclarithromycin, and metronidazole, which can result in total regression of MALT \nlymphomas (triggered by Helicobacter pylori infections). There is also a wealth \nof compounds that could be repositioned including, but not limited to \nanti-inflammatory drugs, anti-infectious compounds (anti-bacterial, anti-viral, \nanti-fungal, anti-parasitic agents), autonomic system regulators, and commonly \nused drugs such as statins or metformin, which have anti-cancer properties, \ndemonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies. With improvement in \nmolecular technologies as well as in our understanding of cancer biology, drug \nrepositioning may be exploitable for target-defined anti-neoplastic compounds \nthat are already in use for non-malignant disease.\n\n© 2025.

Most \nwere conducted in high-income countries (81.7%, n = 371), with 93.8% focused on \nadult populations. Across 438 quantitative studies, 164 distinct financial \ntoxicity questionnaires comprising 1,104 questions were identified. The \nCOmprehensive Score for financial Toxicity (COST) was the most frequently used \ntool (40.4%). Only 48.2% of questionnaires had undergone validation in cancer \npopulations. The majority of questions addressed material domains (51.3%), \nfollowed by behavioral (29.9%) and psychosocial (18.8%) aspects. The most common \nsubdomains identified were health expenditure within the material domain (9.6%), \ndelaying or forgoing healthcare services within the behavioral domain (12.6%), \nand perceived financial burden of healthcare costs within the psychosocial \ndomain (12.8%). Findings from 32 qualitative studies aligned with these \npatterns, highlighting healthcare costs and employment loss as key concerns. \nMost studies of financial toxicity in cancer care are conducted among adults in \nhigh-income countries and measure material domains. Greater attention is needed \nto expand financial toxicity research in low- and middle-income countries and \namong pediatric, adolescent, and caregiver populations.\n\n© 2025.

Gaining insight into patient experiences during this phase can offer \nvaluable information for developing programs aimed at promoting health-related \nbehaviors among patients. This study aimed to explore the experience of patients \nwith differentiated thyroid cancer from the perspectives of healthcare providers \nand patients using symptom management theory (SMT).\nMETHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with DTC patients and \nhealthcare personnel. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and \nanalyzed using content analysis and Colaizzi analysis. The NVivo 20 software was \nused.\nRESULTS: The following five themes and associated categories were identified: \n(1) dual nature of psychological symptoms; (2) perception of somatic symptoms; \n(3) the relationship and impact of psychological and physical symptoms; (4) \nactive management attempts; and (5) realistic barriers to symptom management.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that DTC patients face complex and fluctuating \nphysical and mental symptoms during the initial treatment phase. These symptoms \ninteract with each other and significantly reduce the patients' quality of life. \nAlthough some patients attempt to cope actively, common barriers such as \ninsufficient awareness of symptoms, unscientific management methods, and passive \ncoping result in poor symptom management outcomes. There is an urgent need to \nestablish a systematic symptom management support system.\n\n© 2025.

Real-world evidence on treatment \npatterns and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses of relugolix, especially \nas a function of race, remain limited. This study assessed these outcomes and \ncompared differences between Black and White patients.\nMETHODS: Veterans Health Administration data were analyzed to identify male \nadults with PC who initiated relugolix between December 2020 and December 2023. \nAdherence to relugolix was assessed for up to 1 year after treatment initiation \nand was compared between races using generalized linear models. Discontinuation \nof relugolix, switching to another ADT, and initiating an add-on PC treatment \nwere assessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses and compared between races using Cox \nregressions. PSA responses during relugolix treatment, including ≥ 50% and ≥ 90% \ndecline from baseline and achieving < 0.2 ng/mL, were assessed among ADT-naïve \npatients.\nRESULTS: A total of 507 patients were identified (141 Black and 313 White \npatients). During the first 12 months of treatment, both races had > 90% \nadherence to relugolix with no significant differences between them. During \nfollow-up (median 10.7 and 12.6 months for Black and White patients, \nrespectively), 27.0% Black and 21.1% White patients discontinued relugolix; 9.2% \nBlack and 3.8% White patients switched to another ADT; and 11.3% Black and 10.5% \nWhite patients initiated an add-on PC treatment. Among ADT-naïve patients, 87.2% \nBlack and 87.2% White patients achieved PSA decline ≥ 50% from baseline; 69.2% \nand 64.1% achieved ≥ 90% decline; 51.3% and 47.4% achieved PSA < 0.2 ng/mL.\nCONCLUSION: Adherence to relugolix was very high during the first year of \ntreatment. These data support that in the real world, patients can adhere to \nrelugolix with PSA responses on par with clinical trials regardless of race. \nBlack patients were more likely to discontinue or switch to another ADT than \nWhite patients, but the reasons for this require further study.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT06462014.\n\n© 2025.

Currently available \ncancer treatment methods not only increase the chances of survival, but also \nchallenge patients to return to their pre-disease lifestyle. This means that a \npatient's functioning both during and after the disease consists not only of \nsatisfaction in the spheres of family life and work life, but also sexual \nfunctioning. The primary objective of the presented study was to assess the \nsexual functioning of female patients, taking the type of treatment, quality of \nlife domains and sociodemographic factors into account.

The types of \nincisions vary, and the best method remains a topic of debate. In this study, we \nevaluate the impact of the incision type on complication outcomes. A \nretrospective analysis was conducted, considering all conserving mastectomies \nand dividing them into groups based on the incision type. A total of 290 \npatients were enrolled: 34 (11.7%) had a radial incision, 95 (32.8%) transverse \nincision with skin or NAC excision, 48 (16.6%) inframammary fold incision, 39 \n(13,4%) omega incision, 37 (12.8%) periareolar incision, and 37 (12.8%) \nWise-pattern incision. Flap ischemia, NAC necrosis, and skin necrosis had a \nhigher incidence rate in patients who underwent the Wise-pattern incision and \nperiareolar incision, with relative p values of <0.001, 0.041, and 0.035, \nrespectively. Considering only nipple-sparing mastectomies in breast cancer \npatients, overall complications, skin necrosis, and delay in adjuvant treatments \nshowed a higher incidence in patients who underwent Wise-pattern incisions. The \nrelative p values were 0.001, 0.004, 0.054, and 0.001, respectively. In \nmultivariate analysis, inframammary fold incision reduced the risk of nipple \nnecrosis, while Wise-pattern incision increased the risk (OR 0.656; 3.611-fold \nand p value were, respectively, 0.026 and 0.038). Wise-pattern incision and \nperiareolar incision increase the incidence of complications as nipple areola \ncomplex (NAC) and skin necrosis but do not affect reconstruction failure. \nInframammary fold incision reduces the risk of complications. The incision \nshould be customized based on the tumor location, biology and extent, breast \nvolume, ptosis, type of reconstruction, and risk factors.\n\n© 2025.

However, a comprehensive understanding of mHealth applications in \nbreast cancer care remains limited.\nMETHODS: We retrieved 615 articles published between 1991 and 2025 from the Web \nof Science database and performed a bibliometric analysis using CiteSpace \nV6.4.R1. The analysis included a detailed review of publication trends, \ngeographic distribution, institutional contributions, authorship patterns, and \nkeyword analysis.\nRESULTS: The USA was the leading country in terms of publication volume, \nfollowed by PR China and Australia. Research hotspots included \"breast cancer\", \n\"quality of life\", and \"physical activity\". Initially, research focused on \nscreening and diagnosis, but it has since shifted towards emerging technologies \nlike mobile apps and patient-centered care, including a focus on \npatient-reported outcomes.\nCONCLUSION: This analysis reveals the trends, impacts, and future directions of \nmHealth in breast cancer care.

Data were \ncollected at: before the first chemotherapy (T0), 1 month (T1), 3 months (T2), \n6 months (T3), and 9 months (T4) after the first chemotherapy. Latent class \ngrowth model (LCGM) was applied to identify heterogeneous trajectories of \nsubjective cognitive function. Multiple logistic regression was used to explore \nthe related factors of different classes. Generalized estimated equation (GEE) \nwas employed to explore the trends of psycho-behavioral modes among \nparticipants.\nRESULTS: Four heterogeneous trajectories were identified: the \"no impairment \nclass\" (n = 158, 55.8%), the \"impair-recover class\" (n = 64, 22.9%), the \n\"delayed recovery class\" (n = 48, 17.2%), and the \"persistent impaired class\" \n(n = 12, 4.1%). These four classes exhibited a distinct trend of subjective \ncognitive function from T0 to T4.

Whole-body tumor segmentation on \nPET/CT and standard laboratory values were acquired before treatment initiation. \nPrimary endpoint was partial response (PR), defined as either a decline in \nprostate specific antigen of ≥ 50% (according to prostate cancer clinical trial \nworking group) or PET-based response according to Response Evaluation Criteria \non PSMA PET/CT. Safety assessment included renal and hematological side effects \nfollowing common terminology criteria of adverse events version 5.\nRESULTS: Following two cycles of tandem RLT, 11 patients (48%) achieved a PR. \nThe treatment was generally tolerated well. Grade 3 events included renal \nimpairment in two (9%) and grade 3 anemia in five (22%) patients, while no Grade \n4/5 events occurred. Patients with increased PSMA expression on pretherapeutic \nPET (defined by the average mean standardized uptake value of all tumor lesions \n[SUVmean]) had a higher response rate (86%; 6 out of 7) compared to those with \ndecreased SUVmean (31%; 5 out of 16). In Cox regression analysis, SUVmean was \nsignificantly associated with PR with a hazard ratio of 1.34 (95% CI, 1.01-1.77; \nP = 0.042). PSMA-tumor volume (P = 0.036) and total lesion-PSMA (P = 0.041) were \nalso significant predictors, whereas none of the clinical parameters showed \npredictive value. Kaplan-Meier analysis further confirmed SUVmean as the \nstrongest PR (P = 0.003).\nCONCLUSION: [177Lu]Lu/[225Ac]Ac-PSMA tandem RLT may offer a safe, effective \ntreatment option. Assessment of PSMA expression on pretherapeutic PET predicts \nresponse, supporting its use in guiding personalized treatment.\n\n© 2025.

The aim of the study was \nto analyse these relationships in order to suggest thresholds that may guide \ndiagnostic decision-making regarding the appropriate use of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA \nSPECT/CT imaging.  METHODS: A total of 143 patients with recurrent prostate \ncancer were treated with 664.0 ± 43.9 MBq of [99mTc]Tc-MIP-1404 and imaged by \nSPECT/CT. Comparisons with PSA serum level, ISUP grade, PSA doubling time and \nPSA velocity were performed. It was ensured that a familywise error rate of α \nwas maintained in multiple-group comparisons.  RESULTS: Stratifying patients by \nISUP grade revealed distinct PSA-dependent detection profiles. For patients with \nISUP grade 1-3, the PSA-dependent detection rates at PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/ml, \n> 0.2-0.5 ng/ml,> 0.5-1.0 ng/ml, > 1.0-2.0 ng/ml,> 2.0-5.0 ng/ml and > 5.0 ng/ml \nwere 15%, 25%, 50%, 60%, 60% and 94%, respectively. For patients with ISUP grade \n4-5, these were 29%, 75%, 83%, 86%, 90%, and 100%. PSA velocity did not result \nin a sharper risk stratification for using [99mTc]Tc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT.  \nCONCLUSIONS: [99mTc]Tc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT is a valuable diagnostic option for \npatients with recurrent prostate cancer and ISUP grades 4-5 at PSA >0.2 ng/ml or \nPSA-DT ≤ 12 months and ISUP grades 1-3 at PSA > 0.5 ng/ml or PSA-DT ≤ 6.0 \nmonths. If PSMA PET/CT is available, it should be preferred at ISUP grade 1 or \nPSA < 0.2 ng/ml.\n\n© 2025.

Evaluating new markers is an unmet need. \nAnhydrase carbonic-IX (CA-IX), a hypoxia-mediated breast tumor growth regulator, \nis important for maintaining BC stem cells within a hypoxic region. This pilot \nprospective study \"OPALESCENCE\" assessed [89Zr]Zr-DFO-89Zr-girentuximab \n(TLX250-CDx) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), in \ncomparison with [18F]F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) PET/CT in mTNBC patients \n(NCT04758780).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients underwent FDG and TLX250-CDx PET/CT and \nconventional imaging (CI) if needed. Intravenous administration of 37±10% MBq \nTLX250-CDx was performed, The PET/CT was acquired at Day 3 or 5 post injection. \nGold standard composite was based on FDG PET/CT, CI and follow-up. Tumor \nstandard uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean) were measured, and tumor burden \nanalyzed using total tumor volume (TTV). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was \nperformed with a Bond RX (Leica) fully automated research stainer with CA-IX \nantibody (clone EP161).\nRESULTS: Twelve mTNBC patients were included. Of 273 lesions confirmed with the \ngold standard, 231 were detected by TLX250-CDx and 264 by FDG PET/CT. Overall \nsensitivity of TLX250-CDx PET/CT was 87.5% with 100% sensitivity for breast, \nskin, and adrenal gland, and 88.0% and 91.9% for node and bone lesions \nrespectively. In contrast to FDG PET/CT, TLX250-CDx PET/CT revealed brain \nmetastases. Tumor burden evaluated with TTV was equivalent between both PET/CT \nmethods. For 7/12 patients, IHC analyses showed CA-IX expression lesions from \n100% to 10% with an intensity from 3+ to 2+. No safety issue was reported after \nTLX250-CDx injection.\nCONCLUSION: [89Zr]Zr-girentuximab PET/CT is a sensitive imaging method and \noffers promise for novel theranostics for mTNBC patients.\nTHE TRIAL REGISTRY: Clinical trial.gov, the unique identifying number: \nNCT04758780, date of registration: 16/02/2021.\n\n© 2025.

This study aimed to develop expert-led \nrecommendations to address unmet needs in the management of persistent severe \ncancer pain in Europe.\nMETHODS: An online questionnaire on cancer pain management was used to identify \ncontroversies in the clinical practice of European oncologists. A series of \nrecommendations to address these controversies was then proposed and validated, \nusing a Delphi-like methodology, by a joint expert panel of pain specialists and \noncologists.\nRESULTS: Consensus was reached on 13 recommendations. Key agreements focused on \nthe following: (i) collaboration: establishing cancer pain committees (87% \nagreement) and shared protocols (100%), (i) education: implementing telematic \nconsultations (100%) and training sessions for oncologists (100%) and (iii) \nreferral: establishing clear referral criteria (100%) for patients with poor \nquality of life (QoL) (100%) or persistent pain, regardless of aetiology \n(87-100%), to ensure timely access to specialist care.\nCONCLUSION: Effective cancer pain management necessitates enhanced collaboration \nbetween specialties, targeted education for oncologists, and locally co-created \nprotocols with clear referral criteria. These measures are essential to ensure \nthat patients are referred to pain specialists in a timely and appropriate \nmanner, which is crucial for improving their QoL.\n\n© 2025.

We developed a \nprehabilitation class to improve patient preparedness in reducing and managing \nacute radiation side effects. The study also aimed to improve patient knowledge \nof availability and access to support services offered at our institution.\nMETHODS: We included head and neck cancer patients that underwent radical \nradiotherapy at our institution. The prehabilitation class was an interactive, \nmulti-disciplinary virtual format focusing on patients' nutritional needs, \nsymptom management, exercise, and psychosocial support. Patients were invited to \nfill out a survey at their 4-6-week post-treatment follow-up appointment. \nDescriptive statistics were used to determine differences in survey responses \nbetween the groups, and qualitative responses were analyzed.\nRESULTS: From 2020 to 2024, we surveyed 51 patients prior to implementation of a \nprehabilitation class (control group, n = 51) and 51 patients who attended the \nclass (prehab group, n = 51). In both groups, patients reported a high level of \npreparedness in managing common radiation side effects. Qualitative responses \nindicated patient praise for the multidisciplinary team and available resources. \nRespondents highlighted the need for more patient education on dysgeusia and \nxerostomia.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of implementing a \nprehabilitation class for head and neck cancer patients. Patient responses \nhighlight gratitude for the care received and the need for more focus on \nspecific side effects. This data continues to inform changes in the ongoing \nprehabilitation classes.\n\n© 2025.

Here we engineered liposomal nanoparticles carrying a \npoly-ʟ-arginine/poly-ʟ-glutamate coating that promotes their binding and \nretention on the surface of ovarian cancer cells. Covalent anchoring of the \npotent immunostimulatory cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) to phospholipid \nheadgroups of the liposome core enabled the polymer-coated particles to \nconcentrate IL-12 in disseminated ovarian cancer tumours following \nintraperitoneal administration. Shedding of the layer-by-layer coating and \nserum-protein-mediated extraction of IL-12-conjugated lipids from the liposomal \ncore over time enabled IL-12 to disseminate in the tumour bed following rapid \nnanoparticle localization in tumour nodules. Optimized IL-12-polymer-coated \nnanoparticles promoted robust T cell accumulation in ascites and tumours in \nmouse models, extending survival compared with free IL-12 and sensitizing \ntumours to immune checkpoint inhibitors, eliciting strong immune responses and \nimmune memory. Overall, these findings support the potential of these \npolymer-coated nanoparticles for the sustained delivery of IL-12 to disseminated \nmetastatic ovarian cancer.\n\n© 2025.

While steric repulsion-based entropic stabilization-such \nas PEGylation-has long been the dominant strategy for designing stealth \nnanomaterials, its inherent softness and susceptibility to dynamic deformation \nand external forces often result in only moderate stealth performance. Here we \nreport a distinct approach to achieving stealthiness by harnessing an ion-pair \nnetwork, rather than maximizing steric repulsion. Using model polyion complex \nnanoparticles composed of equimolar charge ratios of polycations and polyanions, \nwe demonstrate that increasing crosslinks between the constituent polyions \nbeyond a critical threshold effectively reduces protein adsorption and \nmacrophage uptake, enabling prolonged circulation with a half-life exceeding \n100 hours. Building on this, we develop an asparaginase-loaded vesicular \nnanoreactor enveloped by a semi-permeable ion-pair network sheath for asparagine \nstarvation therapy. The extended circulation of these nanoreactors enables \nsustained depletion of asparagine, leading to improved therapeutic outcomes for \nmetastatic breast and pancreatic cancers. Our findings open an avenue for \nimproving the pharmacokinetics of nanomaterials for therapeutic delivery through \ndelicately engineering stable intermolecular structures with holistic \ncooperativity.\n\n© 2025.

Here, we identify DL78 as a \npotent antimitotic agent with selective anticancer activity through its \nregulation of Myc. DL78 demonstrated broad efficacy by inhibiting growth across \nnine cancer types and significantly reducing tumor burden in an in vivo model of \nplatinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer, with no overt toxicity. \nDL78 preferentially targets chromosomally unstable, MYC-overexpressing cancer \ncells, a hallmark of high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Mechanistically, DL78 \nexploits Myc's role in mitotic entry by disrupting its interaction with \nα-tubulin, leading to sustained mitotic arrest, mitotic catastrophe, and \napoptosis while sparing nonmalignant cells. This study establishes a novel \nparadigm for Myc-targeted therapy by introducing DL78, which induces \ncancer-selective mitotic catastrophe by disrupting Myc's interaction with \nα-tubulin rather than its transcriptional activity.\n\n© 2025.

Strawberry purees \nwere made from flesh, berry, and achene-enriched homogenate and contained 0, \n1.2, and 2.9% achenes, respectively. At production, strawberry purees made from \nflesh contained more anthocyanins, p-coumaroyl glycosides, and ascorbic acids, \nwhereas increasing achene levels caused increasing levels of ellagic acid \nderivatives, proanthocyanidins, flavonols, total phenolics (TP), and antioxidant \nactivities. In addition, the anthocyanins, TP, and ferric reducing ability power \n(FRAP) in purees with more achenes were better retained during storage. Ascorbic \nacids and anthocyanins declined rapidly during storage, whereas other \npolyphenols and antioxidant activities were more stable; that is, the \ncontributions from anthocyanins and ascorbic acids to TP and antioxidant \nactivities decreased. The findings that achenes contributed significantly to \npolyphenol content and stability of strawberry purees may be interesting in a \nnutritional and, thus, commercial, perspective.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf070467u\nPMID: 17550269 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

In the present study, a blue aleurone spring wheat line \"Purendo \n38\" with relatively high content of total anthocyanins was used to investigate \nthe composition and stability of anthocyanins over three crop years. Commercial \ncultivars of purple (Konini) and red (Katepwa) wheats were included in the \nstudy. Separation of anthocyanins by high-performance liquid chromatography \n(HPLC) showed that each wheat had a distinct anthocyanin profile. Four major \nanthocyanins were separated from blue wheat extracts as compared to five \nanthocyanins in purple wheat. Cyanidin 3-glucoside was the predominant \nanthocyanin in purple wheat, whereas it was the second major anthocyanin in blue \nwheat. The predominant anthocyanin in blue wheat, making up approximately 41% of \nthe total anthocyanin content, remains to be structurally unidentified. Blue \nwheat anthocyanins were thermally most stable at pH 1. Their degradation was \nslightly lower at pH 3 as compared to pH 5. Increasing the temperature from 65 \nto 95 degrees C increased degradation of blue wheat anthocyanins. Addition of \nSO(2) during heating of blue wheat had a stabilizing effect on anthocyanin \npigments. The optimal SO(2) concentrations were 500-1000 ppm for whole meals and \n1000-3000 ppm for isolated anthocyanins. Further studies are underway to \nidentify and verify individual anthocyanins in blue wheat and their potential \nend uses.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf021043x\nPMID: 12670152 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The total anthocyanin contents varied significantly \nand exhibited a range of 7-3276 microg/g. Some grains, such as red rice and \nblack rice, contained a limited number of pigments, whereas others, such as \nblue, pink, purple, and red corns, had complex anthocyanin profiles. Of the 42 \nanthocyanin compounds observed, 9 were characterized by comparison of the \nspectroscopic and chromatographic properties with those of authentic standards. \nThe remaining compounds were tentatively identified on the basis of \nspectroscopic properties and electrospray ionization mass spectra. The most \nabundant anthocyanins were cyanidin 3-glucoside in black and red rices and in \nblue, purple, and red corns, pelargonidin 3-glucoside in pink corn, and \ndelphinidin 3-glucoside in blue wheat.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf0606609\nPMID: 16787017 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Procyanidin standards through decamers were obtained by \nextraction from cocoa beans, enrichment by Sephadex LH-20 gel permeation \nchromatography, and final purification by preparative normal-phase HPLC. The \npurity of each oligomeric fraction was assessed using HPLC coupled to mass \nspectrometry. A composite standard was then prepared, and calibration curves \nwere generated for each oligomeric class using a quadratic fit of area sum \nversus concentration. Results obtained by each of the laboratories were in close \nagreement, which suggests this method is reliable and reproducible for \nquantification of procyanidins. Furthermore, the procyanidin content of the \nsamples was correlated to the antioxidant capacity measured using the ORAC assay \nas an indicator for potential biological activity.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf990317m\nPMID: 10552788 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

We previously found that \ncertain diphenolic food components, lignans and isoflavonoids, which are \nconverted to biologically active hormone-like substances by intestinal \nmicroflora, may be cancer-protective agents. Therefore, we studied urinary \nexcretion of these compounds (enterolactone, enterodiol, daidzein, equol, and \nO-desmethylangolensin) in 10 women and 9 men in a rural village south of Kyoto, \nJapan. The subjects consumed a typical low-fat diet with much rice and soy \nproducts, fish, and vegetables. An isotope-dilution gas chromatographic-mass \nspectrometric method was used for the assays. The urinary excretion of lignans \nwas low but that of the isoflavonoids was very high. The excretion of \nisoflavonoids correlated with soybean-product intake. The low mortality in \nbreast and prostate cancer of Japanese women and men, respectively, may be due \nto the high intake of soybean products.\n\nDOI: 10.1093/ajcn/54.6.1093\nPMID: 1659780 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Proximate composition, carbohydrate \nprofiles, fatty acids, and phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity were \nevaluated. Sorghum and maize shared traits, but white sorghum had higher amylose \n(27%) while Palomero maize 2 had the lowest (18%). Sucrose accounted for 87% of \nthe low molecular weight carbohydrates (LMWC), followed by raffinose (up to 10%) \nand fructose (up to 7%). As for monomeric carbohydrates, maize contained more \nxylose and arabinose, while sorghum had a higher glucose content. The fatty acid \nprofile was similar among varieties, but maize show high contents of total, \nunsaturated, and saturated fatty acids. Conversely, red sorghum exhibited \nsignificantly higher levels of palmitoleic and cis-vaccenic acids compared to \nthe other varieties. Red sorghum showed the highest content of phenolic \ncompounds, including free and bound phenols, condensed and hydrolyzed tannins, \nflavonoids (bound), and antioxidant capacity (ABTS and DPPH). While Palomero \nmaize 2 exhibited a higher proportion of free flavonoids.

Wheat is an important component of the human \ndiet; however, little is known about the phytochemical profiles and total \nantioxidant activities of milled fractions of different wheat varieties. The \nobjectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of phytochemicals \n(total phenolics, flavonoids, ferulic acid, and carotenoids) and to determine \nhydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity in milled fractions (endosperm \nand bran/germ) of three different wheat varieties, two of which were grown in \ntwo environments. Grain samples of each of the wheat varieties were milled into \nendosperm and bran/germ fractions. Each fraction was extracted and analyzed for \ntotal phenolics, ferulic acid, flavonoids, carotenoid contents, and hydrophilic \nand lipophilic antioxidant activities. Total phenolic content of bran/germ \nfractions (2867-3120 micromol of gallic acid equiv/100 g) was 15-18-fold higher \n(p < 0.01) than that of respective endosperm fractions. Ferulic acid content \nranged from 1005 to 1130 micromol/100 g in bran/germ fractions and from 15 to 21 \nmicromol/100 g in the endosperm fractions. The bran/germ fraction flavonoid \ncontent was 740-940 micromol of catechin equiv/100 g. On average, bran/germ \nfractions of wheat had 4-fold more lutein, 12-fold more zeaxanthin, and 2-fold \nmore beta-cryptoxanthin than the endosperm fractions. Hydrophilic antioxidant \nactivity of bran/germ samples (7.1-16.4 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g) was \n13-27-fold higher than that of the respective endosperm samples. Similarly, \nlipophilic antioxidant activity was 28-89-fold higher in the bran/germ fractions \n(1785-4669 nmol of vitamin E equiv/g). Hydrophilic antioxidant activity \ncontribution to the total antioxidant activity (hydrophilic + lipophilic) was \n>80%. In whole-wheat flour, the bran/germ fraction contributed 83% of the total \nphenolic content, 79% of the total flavonoid content, 51% of the total lutein, \n78% of the total zeaxanthin, 42% of the total beta-cryptoxanthin, 85% of the \ntotal hydrophilic antioxidant activity, and 94% of the total lipophilic \nantioxidant activity. Our results showed that different milled fractions of \nwheat have different profiles of both hydrophilic and lipophilic phytochemicals. \nThese findings provide information necessary for evaluating contributions to \ngood health and disease prevention from whole-wheat consumption.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf048456d\nPMID: 15769171 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

HPLC-PAC and HPLC-MS (ESI) analysis identified a total of 35 phenolic \ncompounds in raw and processed lentil flours, corresponding to catechins and \nprocyanidins (69% of the total of identified phenolic compounds), flavonols \n(17%), flavones, and flavanones (5%), and hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic \ncompounds (5 and 4%, respectively). During the industrial process, catechins and \nprocyanidins, flavonols, flavones, and flavanones decreased, while \nhydroxybenzoic compounds exhibited an important increase. In addition, raw \nlentils showed high values of the antioxidant activity (66.97 μmol Trolox/g); \nalthough the thermal processing promotes decreased, the levels of antioxidant \nactivity were still relevant. Thus, the significant occurrence of bioactive \nphenolic compounds along with the interesting antioxidant capacity of dehydrated \nlentil flours make them useful for daily inclusion in the human diet as \nready-to-use for special meals to specific populations.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf102222t\nPMID: 20735138 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

All results are expressed as mean value +/- standard deviation \n(n = 3) on a fresh weight basis. Fresh date varieties were found to be a good \nsource of antioxidants (11687-20604 micromol of Trolox equiv/g), total contents \nof anthocyanins (0.24-1.52 mg of cyanidin 3-glucoside equiv/100 g), carotenoids \n(1.31-3.03 mg/100 g), phenolics (134-280 mg of ferulic acid equiv/100 g), free \nphenolic acids (2.61-12.27 mg/100 g), and bound phenolic acids (6.84-30.25 \nmg/100 g). A significant (p < 0.05) amount of antioxidants and carotenoids was \nlost after sun-drying of dates, whereas the total content of phenolics and free \nand bound phenolic acids increased significantly (p < 0.05). Anthocyanins were \ndetected only in fresh dates. Date varieties had different levels and patterns \nof phenolic acids. Four free phenolic acids (protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, \nsyringic acid, and ferulic acid) and nine bound phenolic acids (gallic acid, \nprotocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, \nsyringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and o-coumaric acid) were \ntentatively identified. Of the date varieties studied, Khalas, which is \nconsidered to be premium quality, had higher antioxidant activity, total \ncarotenoids, and bound phenolic acids than other varieties. These results \nsuggest that all date varieties serve as a good source of natural antioxidants \nand could potentially be considered as a functional food or functional food \ningredient, although some of their antioxidant constituents are lost during \nsun-drying.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf050579q\nPMID: 16159191 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

A total of 35 volatiles \nwere identified in all carrots, 27 positively. White carrot contained the \nhighest content of volatiles, followed by orange, purple, and yellow. In total, \n11, 16, 10, and 9 phenolic compounds were determined for the first time in \norange, purple, yellow, and white carrots, respectively. Of these, chlorogenic \nacid was the most predominant phenolic compound in all carrot varieties. \nDifferences (p < 0.05) in relative sweetness, the contents of vitamin C and \nalpha- and beta-carotenes, and certain flavor characteristics were observed \namong the colored carrot varieties examined. Purple carrots contained 2.2 and \n2.3 times more alpha- and beta-carotenes (trace in yellow; not detected in \nwhite) than orange carrots, respectively. Purple carrot may be used in place of \nother carrot varieties to take advantage of its nutraceutical components.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf000595h\nPMID: 11312873 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Box 21, 41470 \nGebze-Kocaeli, Turkey. cesarettin.alasalvar@mam.gov.tr\n\nThe effect of roasting on taste-active components of 18 native hazelnut \nvarieties, grown in the Giresun province of Turkey, was assessed. Samples were \nexamined for their sugars, organic acids, condensed tannins, and free phenolic \nacids. Six sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose, myo-inositol, raffinose, and \nstachyose), seven organic acids (oxalic, maleic, citric, malic, lactic, \nsuccinic, and acetic), and one phenolic acid (gallic acid) were positively \nidentified in natural and roasted hazelnut varieties; among these, sucrose, \nmalic acid, and gallic acid predominated, respectively. Total sugars among \nhazelnut varieties ranged from 1.99 to 4.94 g/100 g, organic acids from 0.96 to \n2.72 g/100 g, condensed tannins from 3.99 to 40.56 mg of catechin equivalents/g, \nand gallic acid from 0.159 to 0.871 mg/100 g. Differences existed in the sugar \nand organic acid contents between natural and roasted hazelnut varieties, but \nthey did not follow any particular trend. Significant losses (p < 0.05) in \ncondensed tannins ( approximately 97.3%) and gallic acid ( approximately 66.7%) \nwere noted when the hazelnuts were roasted. The present work suggests that \nroasting resulted in significant loss in condensed tannins and gallic acid due \nto the removal of the brown skin. The effect of roasting on sugars and organic \nacids was not noteworthy.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf101039f\nPMID: 20681657 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Total \npolyphenols are distributed in a wide concentration range depending on the \ncultivar. Procyanidins are the class of polyphenols that present major \nconcentrations in apple. Their average degrees of polymerization range from 4 to \n8 depending on the cultivar.

The berry samples, fresh and after jam processing, were \nanalyzed, and the total amounts of selected phenolics as aglycons were \nidentified and determined by acid hydrolysis.

However, no information is available on \nthe pharmacokinetics of the citrus flavanones hesperetin and naringenin after \ntheir oral administration to humans as pure aglycones. Therefore, the objective \nof the present investigation was the evaluation of the pharmacokinetic \nparameters of hesperetin and naringenin in plasma and urine, after their single \noral administration in humans in the form of solid dispersion capsules, and also \nto improve the absorption rate of flavanones by using aglycones rather than the \nnaturally occurring glycosides.\nDESIGN: Six healthy volunteers received orally 135 mg of each compound, \nhesperetin and naringenin, under fasting conditions. Blood samples were \ncollected at 14 different time points over a 12 h period. Urine was collected \nover 24 h, in five sequential timed intervals. Plasma and urine hesperetin and \nnaringenin concentrations, after enzymatic hydrolysis of their conjugated forms, \nwere measured using validated high-pressure liquid chromatography methods. \nPharmacokinetic parameters for hesperetin and naringenin, such as C(max), \nT(max), AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity), CL/F, V/F, t(1/2), MRT, A(e), A(e)((0-24)), \nand R(max) were calculated from their plasma or urine concentrations.\nRESULTS: Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that both hesperetin and naringenin \nwere rapidly absorbed and their concentrations in plasma observed 20 min after \ndosing and reached a peak in 4.0 and 3.5 h, respectively. The mean peak plasma \nconcentration (C(max)) for hesperetin and naringenin were 825.78+/-410.63 ng/ml \n(2731.8+/-1358.4 nmol/l) and 2009.51+/-770.82 ng/ml (7386.6+/-2833.4 nmol/l), \nrespectively and the mean AUC(0-infinity) values were 4846.20+/-1675.99 ng h/ml \nand 9424.52+/-2960.52 ng h/ml for hesperetin and naringenin, respectively. The \nelimination half-life for hesperetin was found to be 3.05+/-0.91 h and for \nnaringenin 2.31+/-0.40 h, respectively. The mean values of the relative \ncumulative urinary excretion, as percentage of the administered dose, for \nhesperetin and naringenin, were found to be 3.26+/-0.44 and 5.81+/-0.81%, \nrespectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of the flavanone aglycones, hesperetin and \nnaringenin, lead to their rapid absorption as their conjugated forms. The \ncumulative urinary recovery data indicated low bioavailability for both \nflavanone aglycones, owing to extensive first-pass metabolism partly by cleavage \nof the C-ring by the enzymes of intestinal bacteria leading to degradation \nproducts such as phenolic acids.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602543\nPMID: 17047689 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Wilfried.Andlauer@hevs.ch\n\nPhenolic compounds are secondary plant metabolites which have long been \nassociated with flavor and color characteristics of fruits and vegetables. These \nphenolic compounds attract great interest due to their postulated health \nprotecting properties. However, adequate intakes and absorption rate of phenolic \ncompounds are necessary for these beneficial effects. Until now, little is known \nabout alterations of phenolic compounds content by the cooking process. In the \npresent study, the influence of different volumes of cooking water on the amount \nof selected phenolic marker compounds resting in the vegetables was assessed. In \nzucchini, rutin was quantified as a marker for flavonoid glycosides. Chlorogenic \nacid, representative of phenolic acids was analyzed in carrots. In beans, rutin \nand quercitrin, both belonging to flavonoid glycosides, were investigated. In \npotatoes, chlorogenic and caffeic acid were determined. The cooking of zucchini, \nbeans and carrots with smaller amounts of water resulted in significant higher \ncontent of phenolic phytochemicals in the vegetables compared to cooking with \nlarger water volumes. For potatoes, which showed great variations in content of \nphenolic acids after cooking, no significant differences in phenolic acids was \nobserved. It can be concluded from these observations, that real intakes of \nphenolic compounds from cooked vegetables are lower and that the amounts \nconsumed are therefore overestimated.\n\nDOI: 10.1024/0300-9831.73.2.152\nPMID: 12747223 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Five \nbread model systems made from different rye cultivars were investigated to \ncompare their impact on concentration of ethanol-soluble (free and ester-bound) \nand insoluble phenolics.\nRESULTS: Breads produced by a straight dough method without acid addition (A) \nand three-stage sourdough method with 12 h native starter preparation (C) \nexhibited the highest, genotype-dependent concentrations of free phenolic acids. \nDough acidification by direct acid addition (method B) or by gradual production \nduring prolonged starter fermentation (24 and 48 h, for methods D and E) \nconsiderably decreased their level. However, breads B were enriched in soluble \nester-bound fraction. Both direct methods, despite substantial differences in \ndough pH, caused a similar increase in the amount of insoluble ester-bound \nfraction. The contents of phenolic fractions in rye bread were positively \nrelated to activity level of feruloyl esterase and negatively to those of \narabinoxylan-hydrolysing enzymes in wholemeal flour.\nCONCLUSION: The solubility of rye bread phenolics may be enhanced by application \nof a suitable bread-making procedure with respect to rye cultivar, as the \nmechanisms of this process are also governed by a response of an individual \ngenotype with specific biochemical profile.\n\n© 2014 The Authors.

Joan XXIII s/n, Barcelona 08028, Spain.\n\nMajor brands of cocoa powder products present in the Spanish market were \nanalyzed for monomeric flavanols [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] and \nflavonols [quercetin-3-glucuronide, quercetin-3-glucoside (isoquercitrin), \nquercetin-3-arabinoside, and quercetin]. In addition, the influence of the \nmanufacturing process of cocoa powder products, in particular, the \nalkalinization treatment ( Dutching), on the original content of these \nflavonoids has been studied. (-)-Epicatechin was in the range of 116.02-730.26 \nmicrog/g, whereas (+)-catechin was in the range of 81.40-447.62 microg/g in the \ncommercial cocoa products studied. Among flavonols, quercetin-3-arabinoside and \nisoquercitrin were the major flavonols in the cocoa powder products studied, \nranging from 2.10 to 40.33 microg/g and from 3.97 to 42.74 microg/g, \nrespectively, followed by quercetin-3-glucuronide (0.13-9.88 microg/g) and \nquercetin aglycone (0.28-3.25 microg/g). To our knowledge, these results are the \nfirst quantitative data in relation to the content of individualized flavonol \nderivatives in commercial cocoa powder products. The alkalinization treatment \nresulted in 60% loss of the mean total flavonoid content. Among flavanols, \n(-)-epicatechin presented a larger decline (67%, as a mean percentage \ndifference) than (+)-catechin (38%), probably because of its epimerization into \n(-)-catechin, a less bioavailable form of catechin. A decline was also confirmed \nfor di-, tri-, and tetrameric procyanidins. In the case of flavonols, quercetin \npresented the highest loss (86%), whereas quercetin-3-glucuronide, \nquercetin-3-arabinoside, and isoquercitrin showed a similar decrease (58, 62, \nand 61%, respectively). It is concluded that the large decrease found in the \nflavonoid content of natural cocoa powder, together with the observed change in \nthe monomeric flavanol profile that results from the alkalinization treatment, \ncould affect the antioxidant properties and the polyphenol biovailability of \ncocoa powder products.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf0728754\nPMID: 18412367 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The predominant flavonoids found \nin largest abundance in all of the analyzed vegetables were glycosides of \nquercetin. In lettuce, a small amount of luteolin was also detected. In sweet \npepper, quercetin and luteolin were both present. White onion [48-56 mg/100 g of \nfresh weight (FW), expressed as aglycon], red onion (40-100 mg/100 g of FW), red \nlettuce (67-67.2 mg/100 g of FW), arugula (41-118 mg/100 g of FW), and chicory \n(18-38 mg/100 g of FW) were highest in total flavonoids. In fruits, the highest \nconcentrations of flavonoids were found in the peel (125-170 mg/100 g of FW) and \npulp (35-44 mg/100 g of FW) of oranges and in some apple varieties (14-36 mg/100 \ng of FW). Variability in flavonoid content due to time of harvesting was high \nfor leafy vegetables and red onions. The estimated ingestion by Brazilian \npopulation ranged from 60 to 106 mg/day.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf0499525\nPMID: 14995109 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Tissue levels of RES were studied after i.v. and \noral administration of trans-resveratrol (t-RES) to rabbits, rats, and mice. \nHalf-life of RES in plasma, after i.v. administration of 20 mg t-RES/kg b.wt., \nwas very short (e.g., 14.4 min in rabbits). The highest concentration of RES in \nplasma, either after i.v. or oral administration (e.g., 2.6 +/- 1.0 microM in \nmice 2.5 min after receiving 20 mg t-RES/kg orally), was reached within the \nfirst 5 min in all animals studied. Extravascular levels (brain, lung, liver, \nand kidney) of RES, which paralleled those in plasma, were always < 1 nmol/g \nfresh tissue. RES measured in plasma or tissues was in the trans form (at least \n99%). Hepatocytes metabolized t-RES in a dose-dependent fashion (e.g., 43 nmol \nof t-RES/g x min in the presence of 20 microM tRES), which means that the liver \ncan remove circulating RES very rapidly. In vitro B16 melanoma (B16M) cell \nproliferation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was inhibited by \nt-RES in a concentration-dependent fashion (100% inhibition of tumor growth was \nfound in the presence of 5 microM t-RES). Addition of 10 microM H(2)O(2) to B16M \ncells, cultured in the presence of 5 microM t-RES, reactivated cell growth. Oral \nadministration of t-RES (20 mg/kg twice per day; or included in the drinking \nwater at 23 mg/l) did not inhibit growth of B16M inoculated into the footpad of \nmice (solid growth). However, oral administration of t-RES (as above) decreased \nhepatic metastatic invasion of B16M cells inoculated intrasplenically. The \nantimetastatic mechanism involves a t-RES (1 microM)-induced inhibition of \nvascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in the hepatic sinusoidal \nendothelium (HSE), which consequently decreased in vitro B16M cell adhesion to \nthe endothelium via very late activation antigen 4 (VLA-4).\n\nDOI: 10.1016/s0891-5849(02)00911-5\nPMID: 12126761 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

A \ncomprehensive study was therefore undertaken to determine the contributions of \nproduct and preparation variables on the total soluble solids, caffeine, and \npolyphenol contents of tea extracts. The results of this study show that the \nvariety, growing environment, manufacturing conditions, and grade (particle \nsize) of the tea leaves each influence the tea leaf and final infusion \ncompositions. In addition, the composition of the tea infusion was shown to be \ninfluenced by whether the tea was contained in a teabag and, if so, the size and \nmaterial of construction of the bag. Finally, the preparation method, including \nthe amounts of tea and water used, infusion time, and amount of agitation, was \nshown to be a major determinant of the component concentrations of tea beverages \nas consumed.

Box \n10, 00016 Monterotondo Stazione, Rome, Italy.\n\nThe major flavanone-7-O-glycoside constituents in citrus fruit juices (naringin, \nhesperidin, neohesperidin, narirutin, and eriocitrin) were separated as \ndiastereomers by multidimensional liquid chromatography. The method consisted of \ncoupling two HPLC columns: a reversed-phase (RP(18)) column was used for the \nseparation of flavanone glycosides, which were, then, individually switched into \na carboxymethylated beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD)-based column and resolved as the \ncorresponding stereoisomers. The method was used for the full analysis of \nflavanone glycosides in fresh hand-squeezed and commercial fruit juices by \ncombining the quantitative estimation with the diastereomeric analysis. \nQuantitative data were in general consistent with previously reported data in \nthis field. CC-LC isomer analysis was carried out by coupling the beta-CD column \nwith a mass spectrometer operated with negative ion electrospray ionization \n(ESI-MS). The results showed that hesperidin was present in orange juices almost \nexclusively as the 2S isomer, whereas narirutin had mainly the 2R configuration. \nIn grapefruit juices (2S)-naringin prevailed with the respect to the 2R isomer, \nwhereas the opposite was true for narirutin. Lemon juices contained eriocitrin \nstereoisomers in equal amount (50% each), but hesperidin was almost exclusively \nfound as the 2S isomer. Significant differences of the diastereomeric ratios \nwere observed between freshly squeezed juices and juices from commercial \nsources.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf0400967\nPMID: 15315361 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Rats were orally administered 1 g cocoa \npowder/kg body weight, containing 7.80 mg EC, and their blood was collected \nbefore administration and at designated time intervals thereafter. The EC and \nits metabolites in plasma were treated with beta-glucuronidase and/or sulfatase, \nthen analysed by HPLC and by liquid chromatography-MS. Several EC-related \ncompounds were detected in plasma such as free EC, and glucuronide, sulfate, and \nglucuronide-sulfate conjugates of non-methylated or methylated EC. All EC \nmetabolites showed a maximum concentration in plasma at 30-60 min \npost-administration. Glucuronide conjugates of both non-methylated and \nmethylated EC were found in high concentration in plasma. Moreover, \nadministration of cocoa powder significantly reduced the accumulation of lipid \nperoxides in plasma and significantly reduced the consumption of \nalpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with \n2,2'-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH (25 mmol/l)) or CuSO(4) \n(100 micromol/l) compared with that in the case of plasma obtained before \nadministration. The total EC concentration in plasma was negatively correlated \nwith the level of accumulation of lipid peroxides in plasma oxidized by \ntreatment with AAPH (25 mmol/l) and was positively correlated with the level of \nresidual alpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with CuSO(4) (100 \nmicromol/l). These results indicate that EC in cocoa powder was absorbed from \nthe digestive tract, that various conjugated forms of EC were generated in the \ndigestive tract and distributed to the plasma, and that these enhanced the \nantioxidative activity of plasma.\n\nPMID: 11177180 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

However, little is known on \nthe absorption, metabolism, degradation and excretion of RA.\nAIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study in healthy humans was to determine the \nabsorption, metabolism, and urinary excretion of RA after a single intake of \nperilla extract (PE).\nMETHOD: Six healthy men (mean age 37.2 +/- 6.2 y and mean body mass index 22.0 \n+/- 1.9 kg/m(2)) were enrolled in the study that was a crossover design \ninvolving single intakes of PE containing 200 mg RA and placebo with a 10 day \ninterval between treatments. Blood samples were collected before intake and at \ndesignated time intervals, while urine samples were collected over the periods \n0-6 h, 6-24 h and 24-48 h after intake. RA and its related metabolites in plasma \nand urine were measured by LC-MS.\nRESULTS: RA, methylated RA (methyl-RA), caffeic acid (CAA), ferulic acid (FA) \nand a trace of m-coumaric acid (COA) were detected in the urine after intake of \nPE. In plasma, RA, methyl-RA and FA were detected, with maximum levels obtained \n0.5, 2 and 0.5 h after intake of PE, respectively. The majority of these \ncomponents in both plasma and urine were present as conjugated forms \n(glucuronide and/or sulfated). The proportion of RA and its related metabolites \nexcreted in the urine was 6.3 +/- 2.2% of the total dose, with approximately 75% \nof these components being excreted within 6 h after intake of PE.\nCONCLUSIONS: RA contained in PE was absorbed, conjugated and methylated \nfollowing intake, with a small proportion of RA being degraded into various \ncomponents, such as conjugated forms of CAA, FA and COA. These metabolites were \nthen rapidly excreted in the urine.\n\nDOI: 10.1007/s00394-004-0482-2\nPMID: 15309457 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Blood samples were collected before the study and 12 wk after intake of \nthe test drinks. Plasma lipids, LDL oxidative susceptibility, and urinary \noxidative stress markers were measured.\nRESULTS: At 12 wk, we measured a 9% prolongation from baseline levels in the lag \ntime of LDL oxidation in the cocoa group. This prolongation in the cocoa group \nwas significantly greater than the reduction measured in the control group \n(-13%). A significantly greater increase in plasma HDL cholesterol (24%) was \nobserved in the cocoa group than in the control group (5%). A negative \ncorrelation was observed between plasma concentrations of HDL cholesterol and \noxidized LDL. At 12 wk, there was a 24% reduction in dityrosine from baseline \nconcentrations in the cocoa group. This reduction in the cocoa group was \nsignificantly greater than the reduction in the control group (-1%).\nCONCLUSION: It is possible that increases in HDL-cholesterol concentrations may \ncontribute to the suppression of LDL oxidation and that polyphenolic substances \nderived from cocoa powder may contribute to an elevation in HDL cholesterol.\n\nDOI: 10.1093/ajcn/85.3.709\nPMID: 17344491 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The metabolism of kakkalide was investigated in rats. Thirteen \nmetabolites were isolated by using solvent extraction and repeated \nchromatographic methods and identified by using spectroscopic methods including \nUV, IR, mass spectrometry, NMR, and circular dichroism experiments. Four new \ncompounds were identified as irisolidone-7-O-glucuronide (M-1), \ntectorigenin-7-O-sulfate (M-2), tectorigenin-4'-O-sulfate (M-3), and biochanin \nA-6-O-sulfate (M-4) together with nine known compounds identified as irisolidone \n(M-5), tectorigenin (M-6), tectoridin (M-7), \n5,7-dihydroxy-8,4'-dimethoxyisoflavone (M-8), isotectorigenin (M-9), biochanin A \n(M-10), genistein (M-11), daidzein (M-12), and equol (M-13). The metabolic \npathway of kakkalide was proposed, which is important to understand its \nmetabolic fate and disposition in humans.\n\nDOI: 10.1124/dmd.109.028555\nPMID: 19910516 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The antioxidant activity was measured according to the following tests: \nin the aqueous phase, by radical scavenging of the \n2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical cation; and \nin the lipid phase, using the beta-carotene bleaching method. The phenolic \ncontent was not correlated to the oxidation indices (peroxide value and \nspectrophotometric constants). The phenolic contents and profiles of the various \ncultivars showed remarkable differences. The phenolic content was strongly \ncorrelated with the antioxidant activity measured according to the beta-carotene \ntest and weakly correlated with the radical scavenging ability.\n\nDOI: 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2009.01072.x\nPMID: 19323733 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Color attributes, \nphytopigments, proximate, minerals, and AC of A. gangeticus significantly varied \nacross the accessions.

Monitoring the \nergosterol content after 25 days of incubation indicated that fungal growth on \nall grain fractions was comparable. Trichothecene (TCT) production was highest \non degermed grain, less on whole grain, and very low or nondetectable on the \ngerm; similar results were found with four different strains. It was concluded \nthat inhibitor(s) of TCT biosynthesis were present in maize germ. The presence \nof phenolic compounds was investigated in the different fractions. The \nhydroxamate 4-acetylbenzoxazolin-2-one (4-ABOA), a known inhibitor of mycotoxin \nproduction, was found in the degermed and whole grain fractions but not in the \ngerm. Therefore, the TCT inhibition observed on the maize germ fraction used in \nour study is clearly not linked to 4-ABOA. Other soluble phenolic compounds were \nfound at a much higher concentration in the germ than in the two other \nfractions. The inhibition property of the soluble ester-bound extracts was \ntested in liquid culture. A possible role for these compounds is discussed.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/jf020957g\nPMID: 12696980 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

In \nparticular, several components present in EVOO, such as tocopherols, carotenoids \nand phenolic compounds, play an important protective role in mitigating \ninflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. \nThe protective effect exerted by EVOO was proposed to be accounted for by its \nantioxidant, anti-inflammatory or anti-proliferative properties. The present \nreview will focus on the interactions among EVOO's components and \npro-inflammatory cytokines, aiming to reveal the mechanisms potentially involved \nin the anticancer action of EVOO. Cancer patients very frequently develop a \ndevastating syndrome known as cachexia, which negatively impinges on their \noutcome. The main features of cachexia include progressive body weight loss, fat \nand muscle wasting, and dysmetabolism, all of which partially result from the \nonset of systemic inflammation. In this regard, the possibility that EVOO could \nbe beneficial to cancer patients by mitigating cachexia will be reviewed, \nfocusing on the skeletal muscle.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/nu17142334\nPMCID: PMC12299991\nPMID: 40732959 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: On behalf of all the authors, the corresponding \nauthor states that there are no conflicts of interest.

Daidzein has a low affinity for the \nestrogen receptor (3 orders of magnitude lower than estradiol) and has been \ndemonstrated to have estrogenic effects in rodents after administration of high \ndoses. We have studied the disposition and biotransformation of daidzein in rats \nfed a diet low in isoflavone content. Four male and four female Fischer 344 rats \nwere orally administered 100 mg/kg daidzein; excreted urine and feces were \ncollected for 96 h and unchanged daidzein as well as formed metabolites were \nquantified by HPLC. In urine of male rats, daidzein, daidzein-glucuronide, and \ndaidzein-sulfate were excreted; in females, only unchanged daidzein and \ndaidzein-glucuronide were present. Total urinary excretion of daidzein accounted \nfor < 10% of dose in both males and females. The major pathway of daidzein \nelimination was excretion of unchanged daidzein with feces. Reductive \ndaidzein-metabolites likely formed by intestinal microflora (equol, \nO-desmethylangolensin) were excreted with feces in small amounts (< 5% of dose). \nExcretion of daidzein and metabolites with urine and feces was rapid with \nelimination half-lives of less than 12 h; daidzein concentrations in urine and \nfeces were below the limit of detection 36 h after daidzein administration. The \nresults suggest that daidzein is only poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal \ntract in rodents. Absorbed daidzein is rapidly eliminated both unchanged and as \nconjugates with urine. The inefficient absorption of daidzein from the \ngastrointestinal tract and the rapid excretion may explain the weak \nestrogenicity of daidzein seen in vivo in rodents when compared to other \nestrogenic chemicals with comparatively low affinity to the estrogen receptor.\n\nDOI: 10.1093/toxsci/62.2.205\nPMID: 11452132 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
